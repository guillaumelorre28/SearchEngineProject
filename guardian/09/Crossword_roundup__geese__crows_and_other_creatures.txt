16ac Slip during PE – danger in loose seat fixing (14)
[ synonym for “slip” in synonym for “PE”, then anag. of “danger in” ]
[ ERR inside GYM, then ANDERING ]

... GERRYMANDERING being a portmanteau of “salamander” and Elbridge Gerry, the 
American politician to whose benefit a district became snake-shaped. It’s a 
practice from bygone times and far-off lands. Here and now, a million voters 
only disappearwhen the registration system changes

3d Ban blocks Partridge becoming a star (9)
[ synonym for “ban” inside first name of a Partridge ]

... hence Alan Partridge helping to clue the orange giant

ALDEBARAN. Being fictional has its advantages and seemingly no downsides, as

Latter patter

That same puzzle 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/b6649b05495163d1014bd9d6ca9a01ae/print_solution/3>
 has a perfect showcase for how naturally a word which needs jumbling can be 
placed with one suggesting that an anagram is to take place ...

16d Doctor Seuss following headless corpse to see hero (8)
[ anag. of “Seuss”, after synonym for “corpse” without first letter ]
[ SSEUS, after BODY without B ]

... “Doctor Seuss” operating, perhaps uniquely, as an instruction en route to 
ODYSSEUS rather than as a name.

Seuss is a contender for the person whose name is pronounced least often by 
others (usually rhyming with “juice”)the way he said it himself 
<http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/12/23/cat-people?currentPage=all> (like 
“Joyce” with a Z instead of a J).

Mangling German words and phrases is easily done, and usually fun. The OED 
pours cold water on the notion that our “gooseberry” comes fromKrausbeere 
(curly berry), effectively arguing that lots of things get named after animals 
for no good reason and there’s little point asking why after so long (and to be 
fair, this applies even to other animals: I’m looking at you, “guinea pig”, 
neither porcine nor Guinean).

It’s more upbeat about the prefix “horse-” coming from the German Rosz-, to 
denote a large, strong, or coarse version of something, from where we get 
horseradish, horse mackerel, the obsolete horse cucumber and possibly the 
subject of our next challenge.

Whether people administered it to coughing horses because of the name or vice 
versa, the question remains: reader, how would you clue HORSE CHESTNUT?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for BIGWIGGERY 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/mar/09/crossword-roundup-bananas-in-race-and-comedy#show-all>
. Of those which used “wigger”, I especially enjoyed yungylek’s “Trustafarian 
entering into business internship with gap year starts showing off”.

Alberyalbery was charmingly allusive with “Shocking example of pomposity”; 
likewise ousgg was both blunt and sharp in “Self-serving attitude of Louis XIV, 
cured by guillotine!” while hectorthebat conjured a cacophony with “Biggy, Geri 
and West mashup being number one”.

Robinjohnson stayed topical with “Top Gear’s Jeremy finally a goner, getting 
reprimand for bombastic display”; despite “a goner”, it’s schroduck gets the 
audacity award for the use of “iPad” in “Mobile 3G by wire with iPad? 
Antiquated extravagance!”

The runners-up are Middlebro’s “Astoundingly, Gigi grew by display of 
pomposity” and Ambush’s “Large and sinewy with egg thrown back in,á la 
Prescott?”; the winner is harlobarlo’s “Hefty rebuke very good for opposing 
acts of snobbery”.

Kudos to Harlo; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

9ac Opener of window used in plunder into saloon? (7)
[ first letter of “window” inside synonym for “plunder” inside what a saloon 
is an example of ]
[ W inside ROB inside CAR ]

... for CROWBAR, which I’m happy to hear is not racist 
<http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/crowbar.asp>. Another mysterious animal 
etymology, do you reckon, or does the end resemble the beak of a crow more than 
that of any other bird?
