When I arrived at London’s Unity Theatre as an enthusiastic young would-be 
performer in the mid-1960s,Liz Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/dec/26/liz-smith-obituary> was one of 
a group of professionals lending their experience to a regular repertoire of 
drama and entertainment who quickly taught me discipline and stagecraft. We 
were together inFrank Wagland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/05/frank-wagland-obituary>’s music 
hall troupe – I remember her Why Am I Always The Bridesmaid? vividly – and I 
was the juvenile lead to her Mrs Lovett in Sweeney Todd, withDeclan Mulholland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jul/27/guardianobituaries1> as an 
eccentric demon barber.

Later, when I’d swapped the greasepaint for the producer’s chair in TV and 
film, I bumped into her occasionally and we cheerfully reminisced.

She was a wonderfully talented actress with a fine sense of comedy and of 
pathos, often delivered together with great effect.
