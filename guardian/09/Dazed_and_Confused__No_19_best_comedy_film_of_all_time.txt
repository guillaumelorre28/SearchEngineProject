Richard Linklater's love letter to his 70s high-school days doesn't even 
seem like a comedy. That's not to say it isn't funny; it's just that it seems 
so real, so natural. Set on the last day of term, school kids of all ages are 
all looking forward to the annual beer-keg blowout. But they must first undergo 
some rather unpleasant, pointless rituals: the senior boys go after the juniors 
with wooden sticks and paddles to give them a beating, the older girls 
humiliate the younger ones, making them roll around in the filth. The only 
other joy on the horizon is the promise of Aerosmith tickets – Aerosmith will 
make everything all right.

Full of quotable lines that are very handy in real life ("You are an 
embarrassment to the game of pool and should be glad I even let you play at my 
table"), they are all delivered by an incredible ensemble cast, with standouts 
such as Ben Affleck's held-back bully, Parker Posey's ultra-bitchy queen bee 
and, best of all, Matthew McConaughey's sleazy stoner loser, who still seems 
impossibly cool to the naive teens.
