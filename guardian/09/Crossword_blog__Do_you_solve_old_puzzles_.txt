Our ongoing Meet the Setter series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/meet-the-setter> gives glimpses 
of the people behind the puzzles. But what about the men behind the men who 
work the soft machine,as Mick Jagger might have put it 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3qgmVb4-kU> – not to mention the women?

There are two new interviews with puzzle editors for solvers to work on 
between grids. TheGloucestershire Echo meets Richard Rogan 
<http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/Big-Interview-Times-crossword-editor-Richard/story-26798562-detail/story.html>
, editor of the Times puzzle, who discloses that it was a different paper’s 
puzzle that hooked him:

I got into crosswords watching my father. My dad did the Daily Telegraph 
crossword. It’s surprising how many people say they started by doing the 
Telegraph crossword. It’s an unseen force that leads you into the Daily 
Telegraph crossword.

Rogan recalls, from his setting days, the hurdles to getting published and his 
new-found understanding of the response times that often meet unsolicited 
solicitations.

Meanwhile, the Canadian Globe and Mail chats to the puzzle editor of a 
different Times 
<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/new-york-times-puzzle-master-will-shortz-on-creating-crosswords/article25414735/>
: Will Shortz, who says that, while the New York Times only publishes a cryptic 
puzzle every couple of months, the British-style crossword is his “favourite 
type of puzzle”.

Shortz describes an editorial line that distinguishes the New York Times from 
many UK broadsheets: his take is that puzzles “should include what’s going on 
in the world today”, balanced with another consideration:

I try to edit the crosswords to be timeless. Someone recently sent me a puzzle 
with ‘Grexit’ as one across. I don’t think ‘Grexit’ is going to last. It’s 
something that’s current, but I think six months from now that might sound 
dated, and I like the New York Times crossword to be timeless so that it can be 
reprinted for five or 10 years. So I rejected that puzzle.

In some British puzzles, you positively expect to find, sooner or later, fresh 
coinages, some of which might stick around and others of which may not. For me, 
these include theGuardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/cryptic>, the Telegraph Toughie 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/word_puzzles> and especially the 
Independent <http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/puzzles/crosswords/>, like with
Knut’s witty puzzle last week 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/independent.co.uk/editorial/xword/c_070715.bin>, 
which used ...

19ac She excites all adult Greek men (6,6)
[ anagram of ‘all’, abbrev. for ‘adult’ and ‘Greek men’ ]
[ anagram of ALLAGREEKMEN ]

... to put ANGELA MERKEL in the clue and had her fellow, um, negotiator in a 
clue ...

16d ‘I’m no lap-dog!’ snarled Alexis Tsipras, initially enraged (5,4)
[ anagram of initials of ‘Alexis Tsipras’ with ‘enraged’ ]
[ anagram of ATENRAGED ]

... for GREAT DANE. And of course, right next to DRACHMA at 27 across, there 
appeared a clue ...

28ac Fool the king into leaving currency for 27? (6)
[ synonym for ‘king’ inside synonym for ‘fool’ ]
[ REX inside GIT ]

... for GREXIT. 

Both positions are strong (I’m talking here about the topicality of 
crosswords). Some solvers think of the puzzle page as respite from the 
dispiriting bulk of the newspaper; others enjoy findingTWERK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/dec/09/crossword-roundup-topical-twerking>
 andOMNISHAMBLES 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/apr/23/crossword-roundup-ed-lights>
 in a grid before they’ve made it into the dictionary.

Shortz’s ambition that a puzzle remains valid for a decade prompts some 
questions for you, dear reader.

First, do you dig into the archives <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords> 
and solve puzzles from one, two or 10 years back? And if so, is this in moments 
of desperation, when all the day’s puzzles have been solved and the itch 
remains unscratched?

Second, does the possibility of encountering a now-forgotten public figure or 
piece of slang affect the way you solve?

And for those who enjoy the Guardian’s books of puzzles 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=guardian+crosswords&order=relevance&dir=desc>
, what are the times and places where a book is better than newsprint or online 
solving?
