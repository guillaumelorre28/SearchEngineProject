Solaise, one of the two main mountains in Val d’Isère, his just finishing a 
two-year, €16m redevelopment. The final phase is a new gondola, which opens in 
December, increasing capacity by 40%, carrying 3,600 passengers an hour and 
taking just seven minutes to reach the summit. A new day lodge at the top has 
great views and welcomes picknickers – so no more overpriced resort food. There 
is also a new beginners’ area, which means novices can enjoy learning at the 
top of the mountain. Finally, there is a new €35-a-day lift pass for green and 
blue runs.

 Skyfly Ischgl operates all year. Photograph: Stefan Kuerzi 
Skyfly, a 2km twin zipwire from mountain to valley in Ischgl, is a new way to 
reach the après-ski pronto, after a hard day on the slopes. It starts at the 
Silvretta gondola mid-station and lands on the valley station of the 
Pardatschgrat gondola; cables are 50m above the ground and riders can reach 
speeds of up to 84kmph (52mph). Ski and snowboard gear can be hooked up to fly 
down with the owners; it beats queueing for the gondola.
