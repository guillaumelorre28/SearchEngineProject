The recipe

Peel and roughly chop an onion, then soften it in a pan with 3 crushed cloves 
of garlic and 2 tbsp of olive oil. When the onions start to brown, add 1 tbsp 
of tomato pur√©e, a 400g can of chopped tomatoes, half a stick of cinnamon, 2 
bay leaves and pepper and salt. Simmer for 15 minutes.

Consider other pasta shapes, but only short ones

Bring a deep pan of water to the boil, salt it, then use it to cook 100g of 
macaroni for 9 minutes, until tender. Drain the macaroni. Drain a 400g can of 
chickpeas and stir both into the tomato sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes, then stir 
in 250ml of cream.

In a frying pan, cook a peeled and finely sliced onion with a finely sliced 
green chilli in a little oil. When they are lightly crisp, add a handful of 
chopped parsley.

Divide the pasta and chickpeas between 2 or 3 deep bowls and finish with the 
fried onion and chilli. Serves 2 or 3.

The trick

Timing. While the tomato sauce simmers get the pasta cooking, slice and fry 
the onion and chilli, chop the parsley and drain the chickpeas. The tomato 
sauce can wait, over a gentle heat, until you are ready.

Use other pasta shapes, but avoid the long ribbon pastas, such a fettucine, 
which are always tricky to eat with chickpeas. Stir 1-2 tbsp of basil pesto 
into the tomato sauce as you toss it with the other ingredients. Use butter 
beans instead of chickpeas.
