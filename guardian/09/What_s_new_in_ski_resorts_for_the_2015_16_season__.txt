More off-piste in Japan

The archaic ban on off-piste skiing in many Japanese resorts (Niseko aside) 
typically sees ski patrols chasing skiers who dare leave marked runs, and 
confiscating their lift passes. This is changing. Furano, in Hokkaido, has 
until now been very strict, but going off-piste is now tolerated, and piste 
exit point signs have been added to indicate backcountry areas. Contact a local 
guide atjourneyintojapan.com.au/furano

Two of the US’s premium resorts are joining together in holy matrimony this 
winter to create America’s biggest ski area. FunkyPark City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/20/utah-skiing-park-city-salt-lake-snowboarding>
 (which hosts the Sundance film festival in January and has a wild west base 
with saloon bars) and nearby The Canyons (extensive and varied but with a 
soulless purpose-built resort village) are both inUtah and both owned by Vail 
Resorts. Together they’ll be known just as Park City (parkcity.com 
<http://www.parkcity.com>) and will have a new interconnecting gondola.

resorts easier this winter. The direct train runs on Saturdays through the

In the Spanish Pyrenees, the budget-friendly resort of Baqueira-Beret is among 
many resorts turning 50 this winter (also Jackson Hole and Whistler). To 
celebrate it has added 21 runs to its ski area, increasing the total pistes 
from 120km to 146km. Even its only five-star hotel, the Val de Neu, offers good 
value, and has a champagne bar, kids’ restaurant, spa and pool. Carrier (
carrier.co.uk/destinations 
<http://www.carrier.co.uk/destinations/ski-snow/baqueira-beret-spain/hotel-val-de-neu/,>
) has a week there from £740pp low season (early December and April), including 
flights and breakfast. Smaller Catalonian resortLa Molina 
<http://www.lamolina.cat/en/winter/>, which was Spain’s first and connects to 
Masella to offer 122km of slopes, also has new runs, and the biggest half-pipe 
in the Pyrenees.

If all this Alpine/Rockies talk has you itching for more exotic climes, a new 
3,000-square-metre indoor real-snow ski slope and play area,Snow Town 
<http://snowtown.co.th/> , on the fifth floor of Bangkok’s Gateway Ekamai 
shopping mall, may be more up your alley. It’s the city’s second sub-zero 
attraction afterHarbin Ice Wonderland 
<http://www.harbin-icewonderland.com/index.php> opened in 2014, with ice 
sculptures based on China’s Harbin festival. Sometimes an ice-cream just isn’t 
enough.
