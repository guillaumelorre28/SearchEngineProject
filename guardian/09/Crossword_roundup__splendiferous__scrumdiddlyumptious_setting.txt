The news in clues

How many Roald Dahl anniversary puzzles did you tackle? Some almost certainly 
await. As a brief comparison of styles,Nutmeg in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26988#14-across> went with ...

14ac Chump or pork pie served after fish (7)
[ meaning of slang ‘pork pie’, after type of fish ]
[ LIE after CHAR ]

... while Gaff (Meet the Setter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/feb/10/puzzles>) in 
the Financial Times 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/17b67c14-7116-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926.pdf>
 opted for ...

18d Angel’s chief character on radio (7) 
[ boss of TV ‘Angels’ or character in phonetic alphabet ] 

... and Radian in the Independent 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160913#!201609>
 had ...

18d Children are being injected with £1 drug (7)
[ abbrev. for ‘children’ + ARE, surrounding abbrev. for ‘£’ + synonym for 
‘one’ ]
[ CH + ARE, surrounding L + I ]

... all of them delicious recipes for the chocoholic CHARLIE.

Latter patter

On that topic, there’s a new Oxford dictionary looking for a place on solvers’ 
reference shelves:the Roald Dahl Dictionary 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/oxford-roald-dahl-dictionary.html>, “a real 
dictionary of everyday and extra-usual words”.

Dahl invented some words and popularised others. I was not surprised to learn 
that GREMLINS is in the “popularised” set: RAF slang for the imaginary 
creatures that damage aircraft. Iwas surprised to learn that SPLENDIFEROUS and 
even SCRUMDIDDLYUMPTIOUS both preceded Dahl (c1475 and 1942 at the latest).

One which does seem to be definitely Dahl’s is a term that can now be used to 
describe short people, and people perceived to have orangey skin, even though, 
in the first edition of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, things were 
different:

[He] bowed and smiled ... His skin was almost pure black, and the top of his 
fuzzy head came just above the height of Mr. Wonka’s knee.

So, reader: how would you clue OOMPA LOOMPA?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/sep/12/crossword-roundup-when-puzzles-accidentally-report-the-news>
 in honour of the excellent Sunday Times setter DAVID McLean. What a 
collection, especially the many political surfaces, inter alia Schroduck’s 
“‘Germany overzealous!’ – Cameron and Davis have that in common”, Leveret1’s 
“This Miliband, late, could be validated”, Asinjon’s “Top Tory departed, 
insatiable on the trail of old money” and Thebrasselephant “Key feature of 
Nick’s essay on government that starts out describing avaricious vain 
incompetent dealings”.

Chrisbeee gets the ingenuity award for the definition in “Deputy head turned 
opera singer, catapulted to fame”, facing off opposition from HipsterPriest’s 
effective “King appearing in propaganda video?” and Jimdubya’s “Infected, I’d a 
venereal disease after I slept with someone else’s wife”.

The runners-up are Gleety’s “Old King Coleman?” and ComedyPseudonym’s “Larry 
King”; the winner is Hectorthebat’s gorgeous “Essex boy?”

Kludos to Hector; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

This down clue, from Donk in the Independent 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160917#!201609>
 ...

3d Shocking when there’s no top lip (3)
[ synonym for ‘shocking’ missing first letter ]
[ GRIM - G ]

... is as good (and gruesome) a way as any of indicating GRIM, but if you 
haven’t completed that puzzle, it too awaits you (online 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/feb/15/crossword-blog-what-next-for-the-independent-crossword>
).

(If you have solved it, you too will have marvelled at how RIM was used as 
part of the wordplay for EMIR (jumble and add an E), then EMIR as part of the 
wordplay for MINER (now add an M and jumble), and so on via REMAIN, SEMINAR, 
MISLEARN, NORMALISE, IMPERSONAL to TRAMPOLINES. Honky-tonk, Donk.)
