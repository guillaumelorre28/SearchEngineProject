Billy Kidd and Nelson, Carmichael Steamboat, Colorado, US

It's with good reason that Steamboat, Colorado, goes by the nickname of Ski 
Town USA. Fifty years ago this season, the Rocky Mountains resort's director of 
skiing, Billy Kidd, became the first American to win an Olympic medal for 
alpine skiing, and he gives free clinics at 1pm, at least once a week, on the 
resort's Heavenly Daze run, as announced by the sign at the top of the gondola. 
Plus, on selected Sundays throughout the season, Nelson Carmichael, Olympic 
bronze medallist from 1992, helps guests brush up their bumps technique on the 
mogul run named for him. Need any more Olympic-standard inspiration? No fewer 
than six other former Games competitors also work for the resort's ski school.

Nancy Greene, Sun Peaks, British Columbia, Canada

Named Canada's Female Athlete of the Century in 1999, Nancy Greene raised the 
bar of her country's competitive expectations with Olympic gold and silver in 
giant slalom and slalom at the 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble, and 
an unparalleled 13 World Cup wins in two years. Today, she's the director of 
skiing at Sun Peaks and leads free visitor tours most Saturdays and Sundays at 
1pm. You'll find her at the top of the Sunburst Express chairlift.

The most recognisable skier on the planet, thanks to his dayglo mohican, 
freeskiing icon Glen Plake can often be spotted on the slopes of his 
state-straddling home ski area. Every April, he hosts the Gunbarrel 25, 
a gruelling 25 lap-race of a mogul-covered run; the second target is to 
complete the most laps in a six-hour time limit. This year's event is open to 
all, though the exact date and price haven't been confirmed (entry last year 
cost $35 with a valid lift pass).
