Great runs, remote backcountry, superb chalets … we want to hear about your 
favourite skiing and snowboarding experiences the world over.We’re looking for 
tips on specific places rather than whole regions, so tell us about great 
resorts you’ve visited, the quality of their snow, scenery, lifts and 
accommodation, and whether they are suitable for beginners and families or are 
the preserve of the experienced and adventurous.

Send us your tips via GuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57ebedd4e4b01b56deffc4f5>, with as 
much detail as you can (including website and prices etc, if possible) inaround 
100 words.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromUK.hotels.com <https://uk.hotels.com/>, allowing you to stay in more than 
260,000 places worldwide. Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using 
the text tab.

You’re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it – but it’s the 
text we’ll be judging.
