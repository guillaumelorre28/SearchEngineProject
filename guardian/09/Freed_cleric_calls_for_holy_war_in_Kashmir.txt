 A Pakistani Muslim cleric released last month by India in return for hostages 
on a hijacked plane threatened yesterday to recruit half a million men to fight 
a holy war against Indian rule in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
"We are going to organise a 500,000 [strong] mojahedin force to fight against 
the Indians," Mohammed Massoud Azhar told thousands during an address in 
Bhawalpur, Punjab province. He said the force would be recruited from all over
Pakistan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan>, but gave no details.

Last week, in an address outside a mosque in a Karachi suburb, Mr Azhar called 
for a holy war inKashmir <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir>. He has 
denied reports of his Karachi speech that quoted him calling for aggression 
against the US.

Mr Azhar was freed from an Indian jail along with two other militants on 
December 31 and traded for 155 hostages held on a hijacked Indian Airlines 
plane.

Relations between India and Pakistan, which fought over Kashmir this summer, 
have deteriorated since the hijacking, withIndia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> accusing Pakistan of being involved 
in the drama which began on Christmas Eve when the plane was hijacked on its 
way to New Delhi from the Nepal. Pakistan has denied any involvement.

Another of the freed militants, Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, a Kashmiri, is said to 
have returned to Pakistan-controlled Kashmir but has not been seen. The third, 
Syed Ahmed Sheikh, who holds a British passport, is thought to be in Pakistan. 
The whereabouts of the five hijackers is not known.
