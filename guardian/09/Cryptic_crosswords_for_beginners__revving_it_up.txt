From Afrit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2009/jul/06/crossword-editor-update> 
(Prebendary of Wells Cathedral) toAraucaria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2013/nov/26/araucaria-john-graham> 
(former rector of Houghton and Wyton), the Anglican clergy is not 
underrepresented in the world of crossword setting.

Cryptics might have shaken off their establishment trappings over the past 
eight decades, but the exegetical skills of the curate still lend themselves to 
wordplay.

The church is also a culture whose abbreviations have seeped into everyday 
usage; so it is that the crossword solver needs to recognise a few frequently 
used devices to reach the moment of revelation.


Most importantly, what’s the most common abbreviation for “Church of England”? 
Outside of crosswords, it might well be “C of E”, but in cryptics, “church” is 
usually enough to indicate the alternative CE.Here’s Paul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/24884> ...

1ac Bearer of wine giving a service in church (6)
[A + abbrev. for one of the services, inside abbrev. for “church”]
[A+RAF, inside CE]

... with a clue for CARAFE. New solvers become familiar just as quickly with 
consubstantiating “books” into an abbreviation for either the Old or the New 
Testament.Here’s Chifonie <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/24055>
 ...

4ac Desert traveller books into legendary English town (7)
[means of transport in desert + abbrev. for Old Testament]
[CAMEL + OT]

... clueing CAMELOT and here’s Nutmeg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/665> ...

16ac Reckless devil’s dirty books (9)
[word for “devil” + word for “rude” + abbrev. for New Testament]
[IMP + RUDE + NT]

... clueing IMPRUDENT using OT and NT respectively. Chifonie gets extra 
deviousness points for making “books” read as a verb in his clue.

The people who read from those books are seen in their fair share of clues, 
too. A word such as “clergyman”, for example, makes me immediately consider 
whether REV might be in the answer;here’s Chifonie again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26397> ...

16d Clergyman having fool in church is in a deep hole (8)
[abbrev. for a clergyman + word for “ass”, in abbrev. for church]
[REV + ASS, in CE]

... clueing CREVASSE. Failing REV, there’s also DEAN, PAPA and ABBE (via 
“abbé”). And while a “bishop” might, via chess notation, indicate a B, he or 
she might also have picked up a Doctor of Divinity (DD) or, as in the case of
Audreus’ clue <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25767> ...

5d Bishop holds one captivated by “Primate With Sword” (6)
[abbrev. for a bishop, surrounding word for “one” inside a primate]
[RR, surrounding I inside APE]

... for RAPIER, you might be looking at the letters for Right Reverend. 

Finally for now, a word even more misleading than “books”. “See” can indicate 
a V (via the Latinvide), the archaic LO or LA, or the letter it sounds like. 
But a “see” in the C of E can also, via the Latinsedere for “seat”, be a 
diocese.

Let’s finish with a clue from Araucaria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/23971>. It’s another down, so 
the “rising” at the end means we need to write upwards the name of a diocese ...

14d Writer opposed, with love, to see rising (5,5)
[word for “opposed” + synonym for “and” + value of “love” in tennis, then a 
diocese spelled backwards]
[CON + AND + O + reversal of ELY]

namely, ELY, to end up with CONAN DOYLE. It’s fair to say that Ely has proved 
itself more useful to setters than, say, St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, or even 
Sodor and Man.

Newcomers, any questions? And seasoned solvers, any other C of E tricks you 
tend to be on guard for?
