In my life, and maybe in yours, seasonal crosswords form piles.

The Jumbo from a relative’s Saturday Times, a bank-holiday special found on a 
train, printouts of the increasingly sighted 25 December online-only puzzles. 
“That’ll be a good ’un,” I mutter: and the pile grows.

Then, usually around 6 January: an epiphany. Just as you find yourself itching 
to tear the now-limp streamers from a cafe ceiling, the idea of a seasonal 
puzzle is suddenly horrendous. It’sover, people. Let’s get on with our lives.

This year, though, there was an exception: Phi’s New Year’s Day puzzle in the 
Independent 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160101>
. Once you’ve been away to solve it, you’ll agree that while it may kick off 
with now-obsolete topicality ...


1ac Seasonal activity potentially applicable to 9, 11, 12 (yes, really), 19, 
21A, 24, 1D, 7, 20, 22 and 23? (5-7)

... the idea of converting FIRST-FOOTING to an instruction which can be 
applied, to take the first three examples ...

9ac Unimportant fellow abandoning attempt at escape (5)
[ synonym for ‘attempt at escape’ - abbreviation for ‘fellow’ ]

[ FLIGHT - F ]

11ac Military man convinced one group of engineers should retreat (7)
 [ slang for ‘convinced’ + synonym for ‘one’ + backwards abbreviation for 
‘group of engineers’ ]

[ SOLD + I + backwards RE ]

12ac Debussy piece including bass and tenor (British musician) (7)
[ Debussy composition, surrounding abbreviation for ‘bass’ + abbreviation for 
‘tenor’ ]

[ LA MER, surrounding B + T ]

... and to make them into FOOTLIGHT, FOOTSOLDIER and the luminance unit 
FOOTLAMBERT – it’s great fun long after the tall dark stranger has left his 
coal behind.

Latter patter

I have a couple of questions for you. Here’s Chifonie in a recent Guardian 
puzzle <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26773#18-across>:

18ac Tell one all we arranged and, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it (3,4,5)
[ anagram of TELLONEALLWE ]

First, what’s your go-to paraphrase of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”? In 
this, as in so many ways, I’m very much like TS Eliot (“Leave well alone / Or 
your goose may be cooked and eaten to the bone”). Others, and who can blame 
them, prefer LET WELL ALONE. Is there a regional or class divide here? 
Certainly LEAVE seems to be winning the evolutionary race:

LET really ruled for a while there; then during the second world war no one 
seemed to want to express such thoughts; now I’m sticking with the majority’s 
LEAVE.

Second, it was only on solving Chifonie’s clue that I twigged: “well” means 
“not broke”. The well is something you leave (or let) alone. I’d always read it 
as an adverb: that I knew and knew full well. Anyone else care to admit to 
same, or is this a source of shame I should have kept well private?

And since WELL is a word with so many senses (Oxford goes into the triple 
figures), it offers our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue WELL WELL 
WELL?

Clueing competition

Many thanks for your clues for REPARTEE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/dec/21/crossword-roundup-wordfights-and-fighting-swords#comments>
. I was partly drawn to the word because it begins with a REP and my favourite 
corresponding outcome was JollySwagman’s “A salesman with skill nearly always 
generates a quick response”.

It also held anagram promise, fulfilled by GeoScanner’s “Dynamic exchange 
rate: peer-reviewed”, machiajelly’s curious “When father’s not around, prepare 
tea, stewed in retort” and ComedyPseudonym’s inspired “In revolutionary street 
rap, Erik B & Rakim displayed this”.

I also enjoyed the unexpected surfaces of harlobarlo’s “About to break up? 
Improve romance ultimately with witty wordplay” and Peshwari’s B-moviesque 
“Grim Reaper captures alien for banter”. That poor alien.

The runners-up are alberyalbery’s depressingly plausible “Awkward repeater of 
badinage” and schroduck’s “Riposte shows right skill in swordplay”; the winner 
could only be Middlebro’s “Agile épée art fencing in Connor’s ‘Latter Patter’”.

Kudos to Middlebro; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.


Clue of the fortnight

When setters include other setters’ noms de guerre, it’s best if a) the solver 
needs no knowledge of crosswording culture to interpret the clue and b) the 
apparent meaning is utterly scurrilous. Both boxes ticked in a quiptic –the 
Guardian’s stepping-stone from quick to cryptic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quiptic> – from Pan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/842#18-down>:

18d Naughty Paul getting into bed with Enigmatist’s first mate (8)
[ anagram of PAUL inside a kind of ‘bed’ + first letter of ENIGMATIST ]
[ PULA inside COT + E ]

And so COPULATE it is. I never even knew Enigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/13/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-enigmatist>
 had a merchant vessel. Aye aye!
