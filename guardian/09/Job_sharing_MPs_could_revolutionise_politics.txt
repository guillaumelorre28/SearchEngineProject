John McDonnell, before he became shadow chancellor, presented a bill to the 
Commons in support of job-sharing for MPs. The solution to Rachel Reeves’ 
concern about how voting would work is for each job-share MP to have half a 
vote. When they agree, either MP could cast the vote. When they disagree, both 
could vote. Disputes between job-share MPs over votes are likely to be rare.

We badly need to modernise the working conditions in the Commons and 
job-sharing provides a much-needed way to bring politics into the 21st century.
