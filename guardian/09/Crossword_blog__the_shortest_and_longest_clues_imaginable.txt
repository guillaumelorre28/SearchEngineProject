The print version of a recent Everyman puzzle appeared to have the shortest 
crossword clue possible:

I must say, 19 across is a bit tricky. pic.twitter.com/ZFZw7NBw1E

A gnomic, clueless clue? What could it mean? In fact, as confirmed by the 
online version <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/everyman/3599>, the clue 
is simply missing ...

 The missing 19 across. 
… and, as the published answer reveals, should lead to SELF-IMPORTANT. Solvers 
could be forgiven for thinking that something more baroque might be afoot:
Orlando 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2006/jan/02/how-to-solve-crosswords> and
Paul <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/24668> are among the 
setters to have produced clues along the lines of this one ...

? (1,6,3,1,4) 

... for I HAVEN’T GOT A CLUE, which fits snugly into the 15-cell dimensions of 
a typical cryptic. That’s how short clues can go – but what’s their maximum 
length?

Have a look at a new puzzle set by Buzzfeed’s Caleb Madison (online here 
<http://www.buzzfeed.com/calebmadison/buzzfeed-crossword-puzzle-submission-guidelines#.vbOjjkPYGx>
, or in.puz format <https://www.dropbox.com/s/amg7ccv6b6l6zq8/Buzzle1.puz?dl=0> 
if you have software such as the freeCrossword Solver 
<http://www.crosswordsolver.info/>). Some of the clues are unnecessarily long – 
and by “unnecessarily”, I don’t mean “regrettably”.

“Wilfully”, perhaps:

17ac Instrument from the 2010 World Cup and my nightmares

32d Ancient female oracle of Greece that inspired Professor Trelawney’s first 
name in ‘Harry Potter’

9d Awards that are obviously kind of a joke since Modern Family and the guy 
from The Big Bang Theory win every goddamn year while 11-down and 52-across 
have never won once

 As you can see, entries which would conventionally be clued with something 
terser such as “wind instrument” or “World Cup fan horn” are indicated with 
many more words, often straying into the purely – and, for me, amusingly – 
subjective.

A century ago, when crosswords began, ink and space were not to be squandered, 
so the ideal-type clue was short – often, as short as possible. Once cryptics 
began to appear, this real-world constraint meshed well with an editorial 
imperative: fewer words give the solver more of a chance of finding a foothold. 
So, as with the prose in the journalism surrounding the puzzles, less was more.

During the paper shortages of the second world war, it was suggested that the 
Times should make its clues shorter. The paper’s first puzzle editor, Ronald 
Carton considered them quite short enough already:

That is what makes them bright and pungent. To cut down what is already 
succinct is to impair the general quality of the work.

But the physical constraints don’t apply to puzzles which appear in web pages 
or in Crossword Solver. It’s that latitude that Caleb Madison is indulging – 
and he is encouraging other setters to do the same. His puzzle is given as an 
example at the submissions page for Buzzfeed’s new “buzzle”: “Original 
crossword puzzles with a modern pop sensibility.”

It seems likely that, before long, the British broadsheet puzzle will be 
likewise liberated from its soy-ink-on-pulped-tree form. Long cryptic clues 
already exist, of course – such asPuck’s elaborate imagery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/25340> ...

2d/17d Number of people admitted to empty carriage on Metropolitan Line 
includes first to exit after drunkremains there (8,8) 
[ synonym for ‘number of people admitted’ + first & last letters of (‘empty’) 
CARRIAGE + abbrev. for ‘Metropolitan’ + abbrev. for (railway) ‘Line’, around 
first letter of EXIT, all after synonym for ‘drunk’ ]
[GATE + CE + MET + RY, around E, all after HIGH]

 ... in which only the last two words give the definition for HIGHGATE 
CEMETERY, but brevity remains the norm.

Would you welcome verbosity (and arrant subjectivity) in British puzzles, 
cryptic <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/cryptic> or quick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quick>? And do you have any 
favourites from the existing catalogue of Very Long Cryptic Clues?
