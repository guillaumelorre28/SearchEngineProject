Edelweiss Ski Chalet, Zell am See, Austria

In August, Ingrid and Anthony Beardmore, and their two children, packed up 
their belongings in Derbyshire and moved to the Austrian Alps. They bought a 
large house in the village of Uttendorf, which they've transformed into a B&B 
chalet. Opening on 1 December, it has four bedrooms – think pale grey walls, 
cream bed throws and orchids – a children's corner, with a Nintendo Wii and 
board games, and a spa treatment room (Ingrid is a trained beauty therapist). 
Within 15 minutes (driving) you can reach the skiing at Zell am See, Kitzbühel, 
Kaprun and Kitzsteinhorn.

Hotel Chalet Dolomites, Alpe di Siusi, Italy

This new ski-in/ski-out chalet is located on the slopes of Alpe di Siusi and 
reached by cable car. It opens on 19 December and has 14 bedrooms, all with a 
balcony or terrace, and a spa with a sauna and steam room for kicking back 
after a day on the mountain. Alpe di Siusi, on the "sunny side" of the 
Dolomites (around 300 days of sunshine a year), has 60km of groomed slopes – 
almost double that of Courmayeur – and there is a cross-country track just five 
minutes' walk from the chalet.

Hotel Spitzhorn, Gstaad, Switzerland


Once exclusively the playground of the glitterati, Gstaad still has a full 
house of five-star hotels, but it's trying to shake off its "cash-rich" 
reputation with the introduction of some more affordable accommodation. Opening 
in December, the 50-room Hotel Spitzhorn in Saanen-Gstaad has been rebuilt with 
an eco-friendly focus: solar panels heat the water in your plush bathroom and 
in the spa (featuring an indoor pool, steam bath and Kneipp water-treading 
basin), while an electric shuttle takes you to the slopes. The small village is 
a five-minute drive (or 25-minute walk) from the centre of Gstaad, where the 
regional lift pass covers 250km of slopes.

Refuge du Christ, Méribel, France

Chalets don't get more "away from it all" than this one, accessible via a 
one-hour walk, or snowshoe, from Le Villard in Méribel Les Allues. New for this 
winter, it was designed to be entirely self-sufficient in energy – a wood 
pellet-fired boiler provides heating, solar panels provide electricity and 
rainwater supplies the toilets. It sleeps 13 people in two simple but airy 
dormitories and two double bedrooms, and the windows offer views of Mont Blanc, 
Grande Casse and Mont Vallon. Hike to find untracked powder, or walk/snowshoe 
to Le Villard and catch the ski bus to the lifts of Méribel.

Villa Americana, Champoluc, Italy


This house in Ayas, a few kilometres from Champoluc, was built by the owners' 
grandfather, who emigrated from America in the 50s. Following two years of 
renovations, it is opening this winter as a B&B with six simple but spacious en 
suite bedrooms, some of which have views of the Monte Rosa massif. Take the 
shuttle bus to the lifts of Champoluc, part of the Monterosa ski area, which is 
home to the most underrated skiing in the Alps – both on-piste and off. If the 
kids still have excess energy at the end of the day, let them loose in Villa 
Americana's huge garden.

Myrkdalen Hotel, Voss, Norway

Opened last winter, this hotel ticks all the right boxes: smart bedrooms (the 
biggest suite has beds for 10 guests) that mix funky fabrics with old 
black-and-white photos of Myrkdalen folk; three restaurants, including one that 
serves Swiss-style fondue, and it is right on the slopes of the Myrkdalen 
Mountain Resort (a new six-seater chairlift, opening in December, will double 
the capacity of the resort). Voss, the largest ski resort in western Norway, is 
just a short drive away, and the hotel runs free ski shuttles there.

has solar-powered heating. There are 32 rooms, with big beds boasting Tempur 
mattresses and smart en suite bathrooms, while breakfast is a spread of organic

Hôtel Les Cimes, Le Grand-Bornand, Chinaillon, France

Here's one for weekend jet-setters. Les Cimes is located in the centre of Le 
Grand-Bornand, just a holdall's throw from the slopes and under an hour's drive 
from Geneva airport. Each of its 10 bedrooms and suites has been newly 
renovated in classic Savoyard style: lots of wood, checked fabric, fur throws 
and heavy antiques. It also has a new spa with a hammam, steam room and sauna – 
perfect for thawing out after a day exploring the area's 220km of ski terrain 
and extensive network of cross-country ski tracks.

La Luge, Cervinia, Italy


Tough as it is to find budget accommodation in Zermatt, over the border in 
Cervinia there are some great-value places to stay, with a new addition this 
winter in the form of La Luge. Located just outside Cervinia (there is a 
private ski bus for guests), it has five rooms decorated in classic Italian 
alpine style: pine floors, walls and ceilings, big beds. There's also a sauna 
for warming your cockles after a day on the hill: Cervinia has some of the 
finest red-rated pistes in the Alps, including the 8km-long Ventina run.

L'Ours Blanc, Les Deux Alpes, France

Here's one for skiers looking to live on baguettes and Beaufort all week (ie, 
self-catering), but who still want something with a bit of style. Renovated 
from top to bottom, L'Ours Blanc has 66 apartments sleeping between two and 
six, furnished with dark-wood floors, funky lighting and sleek, fully equipped 
kitchens. There's an indoor pool and on-site spa, though it's likely you'll 
spend most of your time on the slopes: L'Ours Blanc is 100m from the Diable 
chairlift, from where you can access the resort's many powder-filled gullies.
