The news in clues

Gaff’s most recent puzzle in the Financial Times 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/28cd0ec2-241e-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d.pdf>
 was headed “A birthday tribute”. When he dropped in here, Gaff told us ofhis 
propensity for topical and anniversary cryptics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/feb/10/puzzles>; 
this time, the anniversary was a 125th: the birth of Cole Porter.

It turns out that, while he may have intended merely to find the precise 
combinations of syllable and melody to move the heart in moments, Porter was 
also inadvertently creating wonderful wordplay.

And so this High Society 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76900/high.society> number ...
 Cole Porter’s True Love, in High Society, starring Bing Crosby and Grace 
Kelly. 
... becomes, in Gaff’s hands ...

13ac Understood True Love (6)
[ synonym for ‘true’ + value of ‘love’ in tennis ]
[ RIGHT + O ]

... ‘far above par’ wordplay for RIGHTO. 

Likewise, this one from Kiss Me Kate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jun/28/kiss-me-kate-chichester-review> …
 Cole Porter’s So in Love, in Kiss Me Kate, starring Kathryn Grayson and 
Howard Keel. 
... becomes part of the wordplay ...

7d So In Love? On the contrary with spiritual leader of many (9)
[ value of ‘love’ in tennis, inside synonym for ‘so’ + synonym for ‘with’ + 
first letter (‘leader’) of SPIRITUAL ]
[ O in THUS + AND + S ]

... for THOUSANDS. C’est magnifique, and, indeed, de-lovely.

Latter patter

Thank you to Guardian setter Imogen for giving a well concealed 
definition-by-example 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26904#14-across> ...

14ac Yob, for one, supports Fritz (4,5)
[ synonym for ‘supports’ + film-maker Fritz ]
[ BACKS + LANG ]

... of a way of inventing new words. In back slang, speakers pronounce some 
words to each other as if their written forms were spelled backwards, for a 
spot of secrecy.The peerless Jonathan Green writes 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/371715/> ...

Coined around the same time as was rhyming slang, and confined mainly to 
market-traders, it was created to be deliberately confusing.

... that is, to prevent customers from knowing when they were being ripped 
off. And so in back slang a “boy”, especially a loutish one, becomes a YOB.

Because of the secrecy thing, it’s not always clear whether some newish word 
was once back slang: Oxford writes that the suggestion that NERD “is back slang 
for ‘drunk’ is also unsupported by the spellings”, but entertains the notion of 
NAFF (as in “naff off”) being back slang for “fanny”, and gives some space to a 
back-slang explanation for the subject of our next challenge.

Just as a NEWT was once an EWT, so was a NICKNAME once an EKE-NAME. Try saying 
that backwards a few different ways and then consider, reader: how would you 
clue MONIKER?
