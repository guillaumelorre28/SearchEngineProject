This week we’re hunting for the best tips on Swiss cities. From buzzy hotspots 
in Zurich to iconic museums in Basel and picture perfect Geneva – we want to 
know all about your experiences.

Send us your tips via GuardianWitness <https://witness.theguardian.com/> – 
including as much detail as you can (with website and prices if possible) and 
you could win a £200 hotel voucher.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
from Hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. 
Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using the text tab.

You’re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it – but it’s the 
text we’ll be judging!

Your tip should be around 100 words long. Terms and conditions
