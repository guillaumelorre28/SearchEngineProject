All-male panels are a particularly emotive subject for me. I’ve written about 
them 
<http://aidnography.blogspot.se/2016/04/development-aid-allmalepanels-not-just-about-absence-of-women.html>
 and I follow the #allmalepanel hashtag for updates on the topic. But recently 
I’ve noticed three developments that add more nuances to the debate on gender 
and panel diversity – and more broadly on howwe meet and talk. I’ve also 
noticed that three new academic articles have been published in the
International Feminist Journal of Politics 
<http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rfjp20/18/3>.

Why so many men/people on a single panel?

Even though this requires a bit more research, it really seems that seven has 
become some kind of magic number.

Maybe people only share panels with a particularly large number of men, but in 
general I have a gut feeling that panels seem to grow in different surroundings 
such as academia, policy and other public events. So even if we assume that 
these panels could be more diverse, that does not answer the more strategic 
question: “What do you expect from a six, seven or eight-person panel? Even if 
everybody only speaks for five minutes and you add a little time for 
transitions or Q&A that automatically turns a seven-person panel into an 
hour-long affair. So you may well have invited seven people to get five-10 
minutes out of them. Even if they do other things at the conference or speak on 
a second panel it still looks like showing off and dropping names for the sake 
of it.

‘Ethnographic’ representations of power and policy-making 

In addition to actual panels, a lot of roundtables are also shared under 
#allmalepanel. Often in connection with EU policy-making, these images come 
with a context of how policy-making “takes place” in poorly-lit conference 
rooms, or traditional, masculine rooms with flags and wood-panelling.

Chair next to chair, men sit around big tables, no breathing space in their 
suits, nothing that provides inspiration in the room – it is hard to imagine 
how this provides a space for “thinking outside the box” or finding innovative 
solutions to the complex worldwide problems.

Defending #allmalepanel

The German sustainability award spent quite a lot of time on Twitter to 
convince critics that a picture with 17 men was not all that bad – “It’s not 
the men who were awarded prices – they are just representatives for 17 amazing 
projects”. Be that as it may, 17 men representing projects from the private and 
public sectors are still quite telling. As long as the bosses, supervisors or 
project leaders are all male we need to discuss structural issues, and not just 
responding with the “maybe more women can apply next year” line.

And even though this hardly warrants a reply any more, there is the “I’d 
rather see qualified people on the panel even if it makes them less diverse” 
line. I do not doubt that many of the men on the panels are qualified, but as I 
point out regularly, the question is not about some artificial quota, but about 
diversity of opinions and the visible gender binaries are only one aspect of 
many others.

So what’s next for 2017 (and beyond)? 

In most cases, the organisations, forums and organisers that are pointed out 
via the #allmalepanel hashtag do not respond, let alone engage in a discussion 
on how to avoid #allmalepanel in the future. Someconference organisers make 
promises 
<http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/male-speakers-boycott-allmale-panels-to-protest-lack-of-female-representation-20160428-gohb4k.html>
, butthe mega-conferencing industry 
<http://aidnography.blogspot.se/2016/06/how-to-avoid-awful-panel-discussions-organnize-attend-fewer-events.html>
 is already such a flawed enterprise that simply adding more women will hardly 
change produce better annual meetings of some association or other.

How can we create more diverse and creative spaces for exchanges that can 
break at least some of the rituals of howwe get together? As with most 
behaviour, change initiatives it starts with us.Owen Barder’s pledge 
<http://www.owen.org/pledge> to never appear on an all-male panel is important, 
but maybe we need to go further and pledge to attend fewer panels in general, 
fewer conferences in global chain hotels, fewer meetings in traditional spaces 
and more meetings that are family or pet-friendly and that generally are 
organised in a more thoughtful way other than giving business to the conference 
facility and schedule three coffee breaks.
