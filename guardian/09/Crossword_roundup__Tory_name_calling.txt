The news in clues

The crossword desk has never known such a sustained stream of actual breaking 
news: no sooner hadJeremy Morse’s obituaries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/feb/08/crossword-blog-farewell-to-jeremy-morse>
 been published thanthe print closure at the Independent brought into question 
the very future of the puzzle itself 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/feb/15/crossword-blog-what-next-for-the-independent-crossword#comments>
.

Morse’s death reminded us of the overlap between the worlds of the whodunnit 
and the crossword. If you’re a fan of both, and you haven’t yet solveda certain 
recent puzzle by Gaff 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/b086449c-b2ee-11e5-8358-9a82b43f6b2f.pdf>
, look away until you have.

As he told us when he took part in our Meet the Setter series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/feb/10/puzzles>, 
Gaff enjoys marking anniversaries and this crossword had the rubric “A 40th 
anniversary puzzle”. But whose? One across was a clue which narrowed things 
down a little ...

1ac Crows about National success (6)
[ the name of a Grand National winner, turned about ]

... once you remembered that the collective noun for crows is said to be a 
MURDER. And who was ordering these killings? A flurry of definitions led to a 
revealing seventh row ...

16ac Determine position of Asia (6) 
17ac Certain to mean rapid discharge (7)

... as various senses of ORIENT and EXPRESS confirmed that the anniversary was 
Agatha Christie’s. The puzzle marked 40 years since Christie died, leaving 
unpublished her autobiography and a final Marple case, Sleeping Murder.

Lucy Mangan has alluded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/01/agatha-christie-getting-away-with-murder>
 to the way in which fans of crime novels are often solvers, too; Christie 
memorably expressed one similarity between the creators of whodunnits and 
crossword setters. InWhy Didn’t They Ask Evans? 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/why-didn-t-they-ask-evans.html>, the sleuths 
Bobby and Frankie consider the title phrase:

‘“Why didn’t they ask Evans?”’ Bobby repeated the phrase thoughtfully. ‘You 
know, I can’t see what on earth there can be in that to put the wind up 
anybody.’
‘Ah! that’s because you don’t know. It’s like making crossword puzzles. You 
write down a clue and you think it’s too idiotically simple and that everyone 
will guess it straight off, and you’re frightfully surprised when they simply 
can’t get it in the least. “Why didn’t they ask Evans?” must have been a most 
frightfully significant phrase to them, and they couldn’t realize that it meant 
nothing at all to you.’
‘More fools they.’

This is wisdom that every novice setter should print out and paste to the 
front of his or her thesaurus.

Latter patter

Here’s a clue from last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26811#20-down> by Paul (read the
Meet the Setter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/22/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-paul>
):

20d Con PM’s other half goes in — here?  (3,3)
[ the counterpart to a day’s PM in a word for ‘con’ ]
[ AM in SCAM ]

It looks to me as if the sobriquet SAM CAM was first applied to Mrs Cameron in 
these very pages – a decade agoin a piece by Polly Vernon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/nov/05/fashion.features10>:

I want to be Samantha Cameron. Or at least, I think I should want to be 
Samantha Cameron. We’re the same age, Sam Cam and me; we’re both 35. And yet 
Sam Cam is the epitome of what I am not.

And our next challenge is another rhyming Conservative nickname. This one, it 
seems, began in a 2001 Glasgow Herald review of the campaign diary Friends, 
Voters, Countrymen. Barclay McBain writes:

In the manner of tabloid hacks, Johnson enjoys conflating the names of public 
figures into something shorter, snappier and headline space-fitting. Thus, 
Heseltine becomes Hezza. Jeremy Paxman [becomes] Jezza or Paxo. Let us 
reciprocate on their behalf.

So, reader: how would you clue McBain’s coinage BOJO?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for HOMO SUPERIOR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/jan/25/crossword-roundup-cryptic-world-says-bye-to-david-bowie-tributes>
. The science-fiction ambience continued in clues like Alberyalbery’s “Horse or 
opium mix for Nietzsche’s Übermensch”. Schroduck was more down-to-earth – “Our 
Homer Simpson: a fool, not man’s next evolutionary stage” – and Chrisbeee 
appeared equally impressed with our new overlords (“Pour moi, hero’s incorrect: 
he’s better”).

Encota would have got the audacity award for adopting verse form:

“Superman: ‘Oh! You Pretty Things, 
 Oh! Our promise to be driven insane’”

...but it must go to ID2155366, not least for describing his or her clue 
(“=>”) as “emoticonic”.

The runners-up are GeoScanner’s grimly topical “Zero-hour promise broken by 
Topman” and Steveran’s persuasive “New order could make us poorer IMHO”; the 
winner is the bold compound anagram of ComedyPseudonym’s “‘A better man than I 
am, Gunga Din’, taken from a poem honouring guardsman I hit roughly”.

Kudos to ComedyPseudonym; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick 
of the broadsheet cryptics below.


Clue of the fortnight

What a start to a puzzle from Vlad, with this at one across 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26808#1-across> ...

1ac Controversial candidate wanting power … and nearly becoming president? (6)
[ a presidential candidate minus an abbreviation for ‘power’ but plus almost 
all of the word AND (‘and nearly’) ]
[ TRUMP - P + AN ]

... a clue that, we hope, we shall one day look back at with a nervous 
chuckle. “Do you remember that time Donald Trump nearly became the president?”

Finally, if you’ve ever wanted to see gathered together a collection of the 
crossword editors for national newspapers,many of them have left stimulating 
and touching comments at the petition to save the Independent crossword
