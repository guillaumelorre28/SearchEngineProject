The news in clues

In the 1990s, it was BLAIRMANIA 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/european-leaders-smitten-by-blairmania-1263060.html>
, before BLAIRITE assumed the first of its many senses. We have no way yet of 
knowing whether CORBYNISM will enter the dictionaries, or what definition might 
follow.

Its precursor, though, following its appearance in Collins Dictionary’s July 
Words in the News 
<http://www.collinsdictionary.com/words-and-language/blog/corbynmania-gig-economy-and-operation-stack-julys-words-in-the-news,236,HCB.html>
, is now a common enough coinage that setters expect solvers to know it – 
setters including Knut (a relatively recent addition to the Independent 
stable), who evokesbriefing-room panic

13d It’s nonsense to bash ladder at random (10)
[ anagram of BASHLADDER ]

... this time to the splendid BALDERDASH. One thing that word-hunters are 
agreed on is that BALDERDASH has nothing to do with ladders, but pretty much 
every other theory for its origins has been considered.

There was once, for example, a dialect word BALDER (“swearing”). The Dutch use 
BALDEREN to mean “roar”. Welsh has BALDORDDUS for “idle talk”, while various 
Scandinavian languages denote a clatter with similar words.

Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/brewer-s-dictionary-of-phrase-and-fable-2.html>
 says reckons that ...

... the most plausible source may be the practice of barbers ‘dashing’ their 
‘balls’ (spherical pieces of soap) backwards and forwards in hot water to make 
a froth for shaving.

Perhaps. Oxford considers similar unpalatable froths and broths, including 
milk and beer, beer and wine. As with many of the best words, we shall probably 
never know. Based on precisely nothing, I had always presumed it survived as a 
handy option for those who have got as far as the L in “balls” before realising 
that their company is more refined than that.

That is, at least, what Eric Partridge reckons is going on in the “Aus. 
cultured” variant BALDERDASH, POPPYCOCK AND PIFFLE. The middle one of these 
itself contains rudeness, though not in the way you might think: it came to 
1860s America via the Dutch for “doll excrement”, which gives it something in 
common with the subject of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue 
CACK-HANDED?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for THE THE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/aug/17/crossword-roundup-corbynmania-and-trump-fever>
. I enjoyed the trail around various European words for “the”, like in 
Asinjon’s hilarious “In France, might they have been the La’s?” and the 
grammatical thinking-points, like Ojisan’s terse wordplay “AA definitely”.

The musical references were a treat, such as schroduck’s devious “He follows 
leader of to-die-for German New Wave band” and cmiall’s evocative “H with new 
teeth makes for a pop sensation”.

The runners-up are harlobarlo’s fair “Rock band essentially bothers mothers” 
and steveran’s delightful “They sing and then they suddenly stop”; the winner 
is yungylek’s direct “Article twice mentioned musicians”.

Kudos to yungylek; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
