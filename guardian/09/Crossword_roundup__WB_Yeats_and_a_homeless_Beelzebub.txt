The news in clues

We don’t tend to look at Easter-themed crosswords here, as they’re often prize 
puzzles – our policy forbids us from discussing prize puzzles until the 
solution has been printed and the prize despatched, and no one wants to hear 
about Easter fully three weeks after the 14th day of the ecclesiastical full 
moon,or however it is they work these things out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/15/easter-justin-welby-christian-attempt-fix-date>
.

Easter anniversaries, though, are different. If you haven’t completed today’s 
Guardian cryptic <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26843>, please 
skip to the end of this section! Crucible ties various strands together inthis 
clue <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26843#5-down>:

5d Oxymoron born in 18: 26 1916 (1,8,6) 

So, first we look at 18 across ...

18ac Author marks work by Yeats (4)
[ name of an author + abbrev. for ‘marks’ ]
[ POE + M]

... and then at 26 across ...

26ac/10ac ‘Erin is great!’ — slogan originally spread by its leaders? (6,6)
[ anagram (‘spread’) of ERINISGREAT with first letter of SLOGAN ]

... and since, looking back at five down, we see that there is no 1,916 across 
or 1,916 down, we don’t need to cross-referencethat number, and we understand 
the oxymoron as coming from some ‘poem Easter 1916’. As suggested by 18 across,
it’s Yeats’s refrain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/easter-rising-century-ireland-1916>
 ...

MacDonagh and MacBride
And Connolly and Pearse
Now and in time to be,
Wherever green is worn,
Are changed, changed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.

... and a reminder that the rising began on Easter Monday.

Latter patter

There was more reason than usual to look for Easter eggs (in the sense of 
hidden messages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/apr/06/crossword-blog-who-is-ate-1-april-cryptic-pranking>
) inFriday’s Independent 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/#!20160325>
. It was Good Friday, the setter was Phi – and, crucially, it wasthe last 
weekday print edition of the Indy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/feb/15/crossword-blog-what-next-for-the-independent-crossword>
.

But according to Phi 
<http://www.fifteensquared.net/2016/03/25/independent-9187-phi/#comment-302033>
, circumstances did not favour a themed farewell and so we search in vain for a 
valediction. And we have no reason to suspect otherwise.

As we say goodbye to the dead-tree Independent cryptic, the auguries seem well 
forsome of that paper’s crosswording family: we are told that the daily cryptic 
willlive on online <http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/category/crosswords> and 
that the splendid Inquisitor will move to the paper called the i – no word, 
though, has reached me ofthe fate of its venerable Sunday toughie 
<http://phionline.net.nz/2016/03/the-beelzebub-crossword-update-20-march/>, 
which is a worry and which brings us to our next challenge: reader, how do you 
clue BEELZEBUB?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for PEOPLE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/mar/14/crossword-roundup-emigres-and-emigrants-immigrants-and-migrants>
.

In keeping with the humane thinking which prompted the contest, 
DameSweeneyEggblast offered “Heads of particular ethnicities, or perhaps 
literally everyone”.

Others went for surface readings which took us to unexpected places, such as 
physical injury (baerchen’s “Folk legend in Brazil hampered by minor surgery”), 
the sex industry (ixioned’s “Plebs pole dancing in gym class”) and arbitrarily 
tough questions (ComedyPseudonym’s “What’s the population of Settle?”).

The runners-up are harlobarlo’s topical “Lastly, keep Bernie so Trump will 
lose race” and steveran’s terse “Race relations?”; since we love a quadruple 
definition round here, the winner is alberyalbery’s “Public bodies race hoi 
polloi”.


Kudos to Albery; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

The first entry in our Cryptics for beginners series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners>
 was onhidden answers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/06/cryptic-crosswords-beginners-hidden-answers>
 – because the solver can usually find such answers without much trouble. On 
occasion, though,the setter manages to hide even an eight-letter word 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26834#18-down> and disguise the 
definition slyly enough that the penny takes a while to drop ...

18d Rise as one, delighted to welcome veteran (8)
[ hidden (‘to welcome’) in RISEASONEDELIGHTED ]

... even for a SEASONED solver. Thank you, Arachne
