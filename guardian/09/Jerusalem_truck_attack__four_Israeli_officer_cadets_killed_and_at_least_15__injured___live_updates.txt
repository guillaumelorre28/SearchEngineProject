Our correspondent Peter Beaumont has sent in an updated report from the scene. 
The full version of this piece is here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/truck-rammed-into-pedestrians-jerusalem>
.

Four Israeli officer cadets were killed and a dozen wounded when a Palestinian 
driving a truck ploughed into them deliberately.

Police said the dead, three women and one man, were all in their twenties, 
without identifying them. Among the wounded three were described as in a 
serious condition.

The attack took place during a visit by a large group of Israeli soldiers to a 
scenic outlook overlooking Jerusalem and the Old City.

The scene of the attack is also a few blocks from the American consulate in 
the city which speculation has suggested could be controversially re-designated 
as a future US embassy by Donald Trump’s administration if he moves the embassy 
to Jerusalem although there was no immediate indication what motivated the 
driver.

Police later identified the driver as a Palestinian from Jabel Mukaber, an 
nearby area of Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem located not far from the scene 
of the attack with some media reports suggesting the Israeli licence plates on 
the vehicle had been stolen.

The driver was shot dead by other soldiers and one of the tour guides with the 
group that was hit as the driver reversed back towards the dead and injured.

Graphic security camera footage shot from a distance showed truck racing 
towards a group of soldiers standing by their bus and then driving through the 
group, scattering bodies. After a gap of a few seconds the truck is visible 
reversing into them again.

“In a fraction of a second during which I was speaking with one of the 
officers, I saw the truck plowing into us,” the guide, Eitan Rod, toldIsrael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> Army Radio on of those who shot at 
the driver.

“After a few rolls on the grass I saw the truck start to reverse and then I 
already understood that this was not an accident. I felt that my pistol was 
still on me, so I ran up to him and started emptying my clip. He went in 
reverse and again drove over the injured.”

According to the AP news agency, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, has 
praised the truck attack but did not claim responsibility.

In a statement the group’s spokesman Abdul-Latif Qanou called it a “heroic” 
act and encouraged other Palestinians to do the same and “escalate the 
resistance”.

Qanou said it proved the wave of Palestinian violence has not ended, adding: 
“It may be quiet, it may linger, but it will never end.”

CCTV video has emerged showing the moment the truck ploughed into a group of 
Israeli soldiers as they stood outside a bus. It’s not gruesome but it is 
shocking, and we’ve decided not to embed it here.

The truck slams into the large group at speed, driving straight through them. 
Bystanders, including soldiers standing in separate groups scatter in panic, 
with some clearly trying to intercept the vehicle as it appears to turn. It 
then reverses over the bodies before coming to a halt.

Here’s footage of the aftermath filmed by the Times of Israel:

'Do not let terror win' says mayor of Jerusalem

The city’s mayor, Nir Barkat, has issued a statement calling on residents of 
Jerusalem to “not let terror win”.

According to the Jerusalem Post 
<http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Jerusalem-mayor-sends-unifying-message-of-peace-after-terror-attack-477782?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>
 he said: “To our dismay, there is no limit to the cruelty of the terrorists 
who are willing to use any means possible to murder Jews and to damage the 
daily life of Israel’s capital.”

He added: “Those who incite and fan the flames and those who support terror 
must pay a heavy price. I call on the residents of Jerusalem and the country at 
large to be alert and, despite this difficult terror attack, to carry on with 
your daily routines and do not let terror win.”

Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Peter Beaumont, is on the scene and has been 
speaking to Leah Schreiber, a witness, who was leading a group of new soldiers 
on an orientation tour when the attack happened.

“I was with a group of soldiers when a terrorist attacker drove into the 
solders,” she said. “People shouted ‘What’s happening’ and he reversed the 
truck.”

The driver was shot dead. Groups of soldiers who had been on the orientation 
tour were sat on the ground as the bodies were removed.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the truck veered off course and struck a 
group of soldiers who had just disembarked from a bus.


“It is a terrorist attack, a ramming attack,” a police spokeswoman said on 
Israel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> Radio, which reported that 
bodies were “strewn on the street”. The report said the driver of the vehicle 
was shot.

A truck has rammed into pedestrians in Jerusalem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/truck-rammed-into-pedestrians-jerusalem>
, reportedly killing four and injuring at least 15 in what a police spokeswoman 
has described as a terrorist attack.

The incident took place on a popular promenade overlooking Old Jerusalem, 
leaving bodies “strewn on the street”, according to local radio. Nobody has yet 
claimed responsibility.

If it does turn out to be a terrorist attack, this will be the third to use 
this simple, hard to foil method in less than a year.

Last month Islamic State claimed responsibility for the truck attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/28/berlin-truck-attack-christmas-market-tunisian-man-detained-german-prosecutors>
 on a Christmas market in Berlin, in which 12 were killed and scores of others 
injured. The man believed to have been at the wheel, Anis Amri, was later 
killed in a shootout in a Milan suburb.

Isis also claimed to have directed the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-nice-truck-attack>
, which killed 84 people and injured over 200.

We’ll be following the situation as it develops.

Here is a summary:

 * Four Israeli officer cadets were killed and a dozen wounded when a truck 
drove into them in Jerusalem 
 * The dead, three men and one woman have, not been identified. Three of the 
wounded are in a serious condition 
 * The driver of the truck was a Palestinian from Jabel Mukaber, a nearby area 
of Israeli occupied East Jerusalem. He was shot dead by other soldiers and a 
tour guard at the scene. 
 * Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, praised the attack but did not claim 
responsibility. In a statement its spokesman Abdul-Latif Qanou called it a 
“heroic” act and encouraged other Palestinians to do the same and “escalate the 
resistance.”  
Our correspondent Peter Beaumont has sent in an updated report from the scene. 
The full version of this piece is here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/truck-rammed-into-pedestrians-jerusalem>
.

Four Israeli officer cadets were killed and a dozen wounded when a Palestinian 
driving a truck ploughed into them deliberately.

Police said the dead, three women and one man, were all in their twenties, 
without identifying them. Among the wounded three were described as in a 
serious condition.

The attack took place during a visit by a large group of Israeli soldiers to a 
scenic outlook overlooking Jerusalem and the Old City.

The scene of the attack is also a few blocks from the American consulate in 
the city which speculation has suggested could be controversially re-designated 
as a future US embassy by Donald Trump’s administration if he moves the embassy 
to Jerusalem although there was no immediate indication what motivated the 
driver.

Police later identified the driver as a Palestinian from Jabel Mukaber, an 
nearby area of Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem located not far from the scene 
of the attack with some media reports suggesting the Israeli licence plates on 
the vehicle had been stolen.

The driver was shot dead by other soldiers and one of the tour guides with the 
group that was hit as the driver reversed back towards the dead and injured.

Graphic security camera footage shot from a distance showed truck racing 
towards a group of soldiers standing by their bus and then driving through the 
group, scattering bodies. After a gap of a few seconds the truck is visible 
reversing into them again.

“In a fraction of a second during which I was speaking with one of the 
officers, I saw the truck plowing into us,” the guide, Eitan Rod, toldIsrael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> Army Radio on of those who shot at 
the driver.

“After a few rolls on the grass I saw the truck start to reverse and then I 
already understood that this was not an accident. I felt that my pistol was 
still on me, so I ran up to him and started emptying my clip. He went in 
reverse and again drove over the injured.”
 
According to the AP news agency, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, has 
praised the truck attack but did not claim responsibility.

In a statement the group’s spokesman Abdul-Latif Qanou called it a “heroic” 
act and encouraged other Palestinians to do the same and “escalate the 
resistance”.

Qanou said it proved the wave of Palestinian violence has not ended, adding: 
“It may be quiet, it may linger, but it will never end.”
 
CCTV video has emerged showing the moment the truck ploughed into a group of 
Israeli soldiers as they stood outside a bus. It’s not gruesome but it is 
shocking, and we’ve decided not to embed it here.

The truck slams into the large group at speed, driving straight through them. 
Bystanders, including soldiers standing in separate groups scatter in panic, 
with some clearly trying to intercept the vehicle as it appears to turn. It 
then reverses over the bodies before coming to a halt.

Here’s footage of the aftermath filmed by the Times of Israel: 
 
The suspected attacker has been named by Times of Israel 
<http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-january-8-2017/> and others as Fadi 
al-Qanbar, a 28-year-old from the Palestinian Jabel Mukaber area of Jerusalem.

The city’s mayor, Nir Barkat, has issued a statement calling on residents of 
Jerusalem to “not let terror win”.

According to the Jerusalem Post 
<http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Jerusalem-mayor-sends-unifying-message-of-peace-after-terror-attack-477782?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>
 he said: “To our dismay, there is no limit to the cruelty of the terrorists 
who are willing to use any means possible to murder Jews and to damage the 
daily life of Israel’s capital.”

He added: “Those who incite and fan the flames and those who support terror 
must pay a heavy price. I call on the residents of Jerusalem and the country at 
large to be alert and, despite this difficult terror attack, to carry on with 
your daily routines and do not let terror win.”
 
Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Peter Beaumont, is on the scene and has been 
speaking to Leah Schreiber, a witness, who was leading a group of new soldiers 
on an orientation tour when the attack happened.

“I was with a group of soldiers when a terrorist attacker drove into the 
solders,” she said. “People shouted ‘What’s happening’ and he reversed the 
truck.”

The driver was shot dead. Groups of soldiers who had been on the orientation 
tour were sat on the ground as the bodies were removed.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the truck veered off course and struck a 
group of soldiers who had just disembarked from a bus.


“It is a terrorist attack, a ramming attack,” a police spokeswoman said on 
Israel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> Radio, which reported that 
bodies were “strewn on the street”. The report said the driver of the vehicle 
was shot.

 andother local media <https://twitter.com/ynetnews/status/818066855193640960> 
have reported.

The crash took place at the Armon Hanatziv promenade

, which overlooks the walled city.

The truck reportedly hit a group of young people as they got off a coach. 
“About ten people were lying on the ground near the street. Some of them were 
trapped under the truck,” MDA paramedic Landay Sharon told the Jerusalem Post.
 
The truck attack hit a group of soldiers, according to local news sources, the 
BBC reports <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38546740>. 

The death toll has risen to four, Jerusalem Post reports 
<http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Suspected-vehicular-terror-attack-in-Jerusalem-multiple-injured-477779>
, adding that police have said the presumed attacker has been “neutralised”. 
The paper shared photographs from social media showing a Mercedes vehicle with 
the windscreen riddled with bullets.
 
A truck has rammed into pedestrians in Jerusalem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/truck-rammed-into-pedestrians-jerusalem>
, reportedly killing four and injuring at least 15 in what a police spokeswoman 
has described as a terrorist attack.

The incident took place on a popular promenade overlooking Old Jerusalem, 
leaving bodies “strewn on the street”, according to local radio. Nobody has yet 
claimed responsibility.

If it does turn out to be a terrorist attack, this will be the third to use 
this simple, hard to foil method in less than a year.

Last month Islamic State claimed responsibility for the truck attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/28/berlin-truck-attack-christmas-market-tunisian-man-detained-german-prosecutors>
 on a Christmas market in Berlin, in which 12 were killed and scores of others 
injured. The man believed to have been at the wheel, Anis Amri, was later 
killed in a shootout in a Milan suburb.

Isis also claimed to have directed the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-nice-truck-attack>
, which killed 84 people and injured over 200.

We’ll be following the situation as it develops.
