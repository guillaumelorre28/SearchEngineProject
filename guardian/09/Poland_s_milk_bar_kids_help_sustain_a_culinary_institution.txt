I’m so intimidated by the 60 menu items at Bar Mleczny Żak in Krakow that I 
order the milk bar’s pensioners’ special. This daily two-course meal costs 
zł9.95 (£1.90), and today it’szupa szpinaku (spinach soup) followed by pierogi 
ruskie (potato-cheese dumplings). By God it’s good. The spinach soup I carry to 
my Formica table is laced with teardrops of sour cream. The Russian-stylepierogi
 are soft pillows stuffed with floury potato, and they slip down a treat.

Using Google Translate, I work my way though the entire menu over the course 
of a week.Placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes with mushrooms, £1.10). Gołąbki 
(cabbage rolls filled with barley, onions and pork, £1.55). There are four 
types ofborscht soup (from 65p). I see the same faces in the milk bar all the 
time – sleepy students and pensioners. We can all afford to eat here every day.

And that’s the whole point. Bar mleczny (milk bars) started life in 1896 in 
Warsaw and became very popular in the depression era. But they really took off 
across socialist postwar Poland in the guise of workers’ canteens – 
government-subsidised cafes where workers could get a good, nutritious and 
affordable meal. They sold traditional Polish staples, and snacks such as 
cheese cutlets – good meat was hard to come by in the 1950s – along with other 
dairy products, hence the moniker.

Poland’s milk bars predate the fad for locally sourced cuisine by serving 
whatever is cheap and seasonal. Everything on the menu at Bar Mleczny Żak, down 
to my plastic beaker of crushed raspberry juice, hails from Krakow’s hinterland.

While still popular among some groups of Poles – the aforesaid students and 
pensioners – the nation’s milk bars are facing a make-or-break moment. Today, 
fewer than 150 milk bars exist across Poland, down from 40,000 in their heyday. 
Many closed after the collapse of communism when the newly affluent started 
clamouring for finer dining or western fast-food chains.

 The interior of Milkbar Tomasza. 
The government is also reducing its subsidy and many bar mleczny can’t compete 
with the accoutrements demanded by today’s diners – table service and a beer 
would be nice, but these “bars” are self-service and booze-free.

However, recent years have seen a mini-revival driven by several influences: 
the novelty factor for those too young to know about communism’s deprivations; 
the nostalgia of the older generation; and a revamping of old milk bars such as
Milkbar Tomasza <https://www.facebook.com/Milkbar-Tomasza-298550616857031/> and 
Bar Gornik <https://www.facebook.com/barmleczny.gornik> in Krakow.

Tomasza was bought as a rundown milk bar in 2011 at public auction. “There was 
only one other bidder,” says its Irish co-owner, Tom Naughton. His friends 
thought he was crazy to want to reinvent a restaurant scene scorned by most 
modern Poles. “But by sourcing ingredients daily fromStary Kleparz 
<http://www.starykleparz.com/> market, and by cooking classic dishes to order, 
we are still welcoming older diners.”

And this time they’re bringing their grandkids for platters of pierogi, too.
