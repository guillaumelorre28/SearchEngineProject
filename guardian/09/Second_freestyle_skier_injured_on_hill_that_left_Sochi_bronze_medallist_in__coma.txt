A second Swedish freestyle World Cup skier has been injured in Italy following 
two incidents on the same hill in a three-day span.

Anna Holmlund was seriously injured on Monday after crashing during training 
for a World Cup event in Innichen. The Sochi bronze medallist is now in a 
medically-induced coma. Her compatriot Sandra Naslund was injured during a race 
on Wednesday and was also taken to the hospital. Naslund’s injuries are less 
serious and she is set to have x-rays on her elbow.

The 29-year-old Holmlund lost consciousness after hitting her head during the 
crash and was flown by helicopter to Bolzano, where she underwent brain surgery.

Jakob Swanberg, the Swedish ski cross federation doctor, indicated a bleak 
prognosis on Tuesday, saying that Holmlund’s brain test results were 
“unfortunately disappointing”.

“Injuries that we were not able to see previously show now and now we see the 
damage is unfortunately widespread. It is still difficult to make any forecast 
but generally speaking, damage of this type usually leaves considerable injury.”

Holmlund is a three-time ski-cross World Cup champion and won a bronze medal 
at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She is currently second in the ski-cross 
standings, one place ahead of Naslund.
