Terminal Neige Totem, Flaine, France

With a similar theme to Le Taos, the Totem has a look inspired by Native 
American tribal patterns and the 1970s, with beautiful colourful armchairs, 
antlers and woven furnishings. It’s the first of the three-star Terminal Neige 
brand, a new venture from Hotels Sibuet, which has higher-end hotels across the 
Alps. The architecture is bold stark concrete, in keeping with the rest of the 
Flaine Forum development, at 1,600-1,800 metres. There are 96 rooms, plus a spa 
with sauna, outdoor Jacuzzi, ski shop, bar and restaurant and fitness centre.

Le Taos, Tignes, France

Taking its inspiration from the New Mexico ski resort, this stylish hotel has 
just opened in the Rosset area of Tignes le Lac, right on the Lavachet piste. 
With feather-pattern wallpapers, tribal-style blankets and sandstone colours, 
it evokes the American west in each of its 54 rooms. There’s also a wellness 
centre with a pool and the usual steamy stuff, and its Mesa Verde restaurant 
will focus on steaks and French cuisine rather than tacos.

Adeo Alpin, St Johann in Tirol, Austria


Hermann Maier, the former ski racing champ, is opening his hotel on 15 January 
and says he knows what skiersreally need. Apparently that’s cheap rates, your 
own ski locker, bathrooms with rain showers, and free Wi-Fi – and not welcome 
cocktails, porters or butler service, which he’s not bothering with. He and 
partner (and former team-mate) Rainer Schönfelder, aim to open more of these 
affordable family hotels across Austria.

Villa Rose, Samoëns, France

Leather, fur and velvet bring luxury to a grand belle époque villa in this 
charming town (handy for Geneva and linking to several resorts). Skiers can 
take just a room, and use it as a hotel, or book out the whole place for a 
catered stay.
• Doubles from €310 B&B, or rent the whole place, sleeping 12, for a week from 
€8,400,villarosesamoens.com/villa <http://www.villarosesamoens.com/> 

Chalet du Friolin, near La Plagne, France


To be sure of first tracks on powder days, skiers can now sleep right where 
the off-piste begins, at 1,800 metres beside the Montchavin-Les Coches slopes 
in the Paradiski ski area. Chalet Friolin was (and is) a mountain restaurant, 
but has added five guest rooms, offering half-board stays (minimum seven nights 
in the ski season). Guests can travel to the chalet on snowshoes, snowmobile or 
sledge.
