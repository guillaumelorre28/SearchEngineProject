Be positive

With its dire warnings about the evaporation of pension funds, catastrophic 
job losses and a looming business exodus fromScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> in the event of a yes vote, the 
pro-union campaign group Better Together became quickly known as “Project Fear”.

Even within the no camp, there were complaints that one of the great misses of 
the referendum campaign was the failure to make a positive and upbeat case for 
the union.

In purely campaigning terms, the full-throated gloom of Alistair Darling and 
Gordon Brown was no match for the sometimes giddying positivity of the yes 
movement, with its flashmob ceilidhs in Glasgow’s George Square.

Indeed, Scotland Stronger in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> made direct reference to this 
when it launched in Edinburgh last week, with its chief spokesman, John Edward, 
insisting the pro-Europe campaign would instead describe itself as “Project 
Cheer”.

Elsewhere, however, threats with iffy undertones have been seeping out from 
both sides, withDavid Cameron suggesting that Brexit could lead to migrant 
camps at Dover 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/feb/08/jungle-will-there-be-kent-migrant-camps-if-britain-leaves-eu>
 because the UK would no longer be able to police its border at Calais. And on 
Sunday,Iain Duncan Smith suggested that remaining within the EU could make the 
UK more vulnerable to Paris-style terrorist attacks

It’s the economy, stupid

Even the most devoted of independence activists will accept that the reason 
they lost was because the yes side failed to make a convincing argument about 
what would happen to Scotland’s currency if it separated from the rest of the 
UK.

A number of subsequent studies 
<http://file:///Users/libbybrooks/Downloads/Briefing%202%20Campaign%20Dynamics.pdf>
 have found that people’s attitude to risk was the biggest determinant in how 
they voted, and those who rejected independence did so because of the economic 
risks, although their attachment to a national identity that was British rather 
than Scottish followed closely behind.

With the markets already experiencing a severe anxiety attack at the prospect 
of a no vote, the pro-EU campaign would do well to recall how – despite the 
aforementioned lack of cheer – the previous referendum’s status quo camp held 
its nerve and waited for the silent majority, as Darling confidently described 
them, to make their mark at the polling booth.

Beware strange bedfellows

As with the effects of the French Revolution, it’s too early to say what the 
long-term consequences will be of September 2014’sScottish independence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence> referendum.

But on the doorsteps leading up to last year’s general election, the 
short-term effect on Scottish Labour was clear enough, as voter after voter 
expressed their rage and disappointment that the party had shared a platform 
with the Tories during the referendum campaign.

For many on the Scottish left, making common cause with the Conservatives – a 
party with just one Westminster MP and a poisonous legacy north of the border – 
was always a political bridge too far and the electorate’s verdict last May was 
devastating.

It’s not surprising, then, that both Labour and the Scottish National party 
are treading carefully this time, with Scotland’s remaining Labour MP telling a 
Brussels audience that his party will campaign “distinctly”.

Meanwhile, Cameron has already had some fun warning Boris Johnson against 
“linking arms with Nigel Farage and George Galloway and taking a leap in the 
dark”.

Celebrity endorsements can change headlines, but probably not minds

By the end of the Scottish campaign, it felt to some weary reporters that the 
appearance of a squirrel on the lawn might merit coverage if it signalled it 
was planning to promote one campaign or the other.

But the avalanche of hinting tweets, side swipes and whole-hearted 
endorsements – fromthe Pope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/13/pope-scottish-independence-warning-division>
 tothe Proclaimers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/02/proclaimers-donate-scotland-yes-campaign>
 – did little to sway voters, according to pollster John Curtice, of 
Strathclyde University.

He told the Guardian at the time: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/11/celebrity-endorsement-sway-yes-no-scotland-analysis>
 “The Scottish referendum is not on a subject which people know very little 
about and are therefore looking for people to give them cues: this is a serious 
debate which touches on people’s values and have been arguing about for 40 
years.”

In pitching his “big, public reach-out” to persuade British voters to stay 
inside the EU, Barack Obama might do well to consider howhis intervention in 
the UK’s last referendum was greeted

A shorter campaign favours the status quo

According to ESRC’s Scottish referendum study 
<http://file:///Users/libbybrooks/Downloads/Briefing%202%20Campaign%20Dynamics.pdf>
, the majority of voters decided which way to vote on Scottish independence 
relatively early in the campaign, with 65.2% of respondents deciding as far 
back as March 2013.

But a far smaller proportion of yes voters had made up their minds early in 
the campaign, with around a third waiting until the final month or weeks to 
make their decision. This suggests that voters who were previously undecided 
began to move towards a yes vote in the final stages of the campaign.

With current polling 
<http://survation.com/the-eu-referendum-where-the-uk-stands-today-should-the-united-kingdom-remain-a-member-of-the-european-union/>
 finding upwards of 20% undecided on the EU referendum, this is good news for 
the remain campaign.

You can lose and still win

The surge in support for the SNP which began immediately after the yes 
campaign lost the referendum has confounded predictions and fundamentally 
altered the political landscape of the UK as a whole. Winning 56 out of 59 
seats in last year’s Westminster general election, the SNP is on course to 
repeat the landslide at this May’s Holyrood elections.

Observers would credit their extraordinary success to the way that they 
remained focused and united post-referendum, whilst the no camp immediately 
fell back to its previous divisions, with Cameron infamously using his first 
comment after his side’s victory to proclaim the need for English votes for 
English laws.

The Scottish experience also shows how individuals can benefit from campaign 
exposure: Nicola Sturgeon, who had previously struggled with her public image, 
was transformed into one of the most popular, trusted and impressive 
politicians of her generation.
