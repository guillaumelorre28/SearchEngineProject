 The American-sponsored peace talks between Syria and Israel will resume next 
week after a break during which the two governments will test domestic 
reactions to a "working document" drafted by the US.
The latest phase of talks at Shepherdstown in West Virginia, came to an end 
yesterday with the announcement of "a short recess" and President Bill Clinton 
warning of "a time of great tension".

The US state department said that Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the 
Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara'a, would be returning on January 19 
"to continue the negotiations and work further towards a peace agreement".

Mr Barak left Shepherdstown yesterday morning. Mr Shara'a was expected to 
leave soon after.

Mr Clinton, who joined the talks on five occasions in the course of six days, 
was characteristically upbeat about progress when he addressed Muslim Americans 
at a White House ceremony to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

"These people really talked about the substance of their differences for the 
first time," he said. "They were very open. They were very candid. They broke a 
lot of new ground."

But Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, said as he left Shepherdstown: "We 
did not reach agreement. We did not even get near.

"We began a discussion. I believe it will continue. The sides will make 
efforts, with a consciousness that peace will serve both sides and the entire 
region."

A source close to the Syrian delegation told the Associated Press that the 
current round of talks had not succeeded in its aim of winning an Israeli 
commitment to withdraw to its pre-1967 border with Syria - the issue which is 
at the heart of the current diplomatic effort. Martin Kettle, Washington
