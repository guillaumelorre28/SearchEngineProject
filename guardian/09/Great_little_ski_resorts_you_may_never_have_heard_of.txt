Good for beginners

St Johann, Tyrol, Austria
Where Most people have heard of St Johann’s more famous neighbour, Kitzbühel. 
What they don’t know is that this Tyrolean town has a similar medieval centre, 
with frescoed buildings and old coaching inns, but lower prices. It has 43km of 
pistes and 17 lifts.
Why This is a good destination for beginners and intermediates, with nursery 
slopes on the gentle meadows behind the station. There’s a good choice of ski 
schools and those who fancy a day off the slopes can try hot-air-ballooning.
Book A week at Pension Mair costs £469pp B&B including flights from Gatwick:

.

Les Saisies, France
Where The village is in the beautiful Beaufortain valley, 30km from the town 
of Albertville. It has 192km of pistes and 81 lifts.
Why It’s known as a cross-country resort, but the downhill skiing is mainly 
gentle and ideal for beginners. This is a great place to find your legs on 
pistes that aren’t too steep and hairy.
Book Hameau du Beaufortain flats cost from £245pp based on six sharing:

.

Peyragudes, France
Where This purpose-built ski area in the Pyrenees is close to the Spanish 
border, with 60km of pistes and 17 lifts. It has an ultramodern lift system, 
comprising mostly fast chairlifts, with a few draglifts. 
Why It’s a great place to learn because everything is geared to convenience, 
with lifts rather than steps from the car parks to the snow – a blessing when 
you’re getting to grips with clumping along in ski boots and carrying skis.
Book Le Hameau de Balestas costs from £108pp based on five sharing a 
two-bedroom flat, including Eurotunnel crossing:pyreneescollection.co.uk

Good for families 
 Geilo, Norway 
Geilo, Norway
Where In the Hallingdal valley, north-west of Oslo, Norway’s oldest ski resort 
is reachable by train and shuttle bus from Bergen and Oslo airports.
Why The slopes are quiet and unintimidating, and the ski school is 
award-winning, making it a great place to learn, especially as all the ski 
instructors speak good English. Children will also love the off-slope options, 
from horse-sleigh rides to ice fishing to a new treetop walk.
Book From £555pp self-catering in Geilolia forest cabins, based on four 
sharing:skisafari.com

.

Ardent, France
Where This small village of wooden chalets is two lifts away from Avoriaz and 
provides a back door into the Portes du Soleil area (372km of pistes, 194 
lifts). You can ski back to the village, and the crèche is within a few 
minutes’ walk.
Why Avoriaz may have a bigger choice of ski schools and kindergartens but it 
doesn’t have the family-friendly ambience of Ardent.
Book Chalet Plagnat, a 200-year-old sole-use pad for 12 costs from £539pp 
(children £439) half-board, including transfers; flights are extra:

 Chalet Katie 1, Reberty 2000 
Reberty 2000, France
Where The 1960s purpose-built resort of Les Menuires is no looker, so the 
newer, more traditional-style hamlet of Reberty is a welcome alternative. It’s 
200m above its plainer neighbour in the Trois Vallées, so has links to one of 
the Alps’ biggest ski areas, which boasts 495km of pistes and 180 lifts.
Why It’s become a family-friendly enclave, complete with kindergarten. La 
Ferme de Reberty <http://www.lafermedereberty.com/restaurant-menuires.html>(+33 
4 79 00 77 01) is where everyone heads for lunch.

Gressoney, Italy
Where Gressoney is part of a group of unsung resorts in the Aosta valley, 
sharing a ski area with Champoluc and Alagna. Gressoney-La-Trinité, with its 
cobbled streets and wooden chalets, provides the most convenient base from 
which to explore the linked Monterosa ski area, which has 150km of pistes and 
44 lifts.
Why Families will love the quiet pistes and lack of queues, and little ones 
will wolf down the Italian food.
Book Chalet Hotel Valverde in Gressoney-La-Trinité costs £2,019 half-board for 
a family of four:espritski.com <http://www.espritski.com/ski-chalets/valverde/>.

Arinsal, Andorra
Where In western Andorra, Arinsal is part of the Vallnord ski area, where your 
ski pass gives access also to the resorts of Arcalis and Pal.
Why Under-12s get free lift passes, and prices are lower than in the Alps. The 
ski school comes highly recommended and the safe, enclosed slopes are great for 
kids and first-time skiers.
Book Central Hotel Princesa Parc offers free childcare for 3-11-year-olds and

Good for off-piste
 Some piste and quiet … Solitude, Utah. Photograph: Jay Dash 
Solitude, Utah, US 
Where Just 30 minutes from Salt Lake City, this attractive little village with 
1,200 acres of slopes and eight lifts is a good place to escape the crowds.
Why Even during the busiest weeks, the lifts and slopes remain uncrowded, and 
there is a vast swathe of backcountry to explore. Honeycomb Ridge is where 
off-piste connoisseurs head for cliffs, hanging snowfields and gradients often 
exceeding 50 degrees. It’s easy to visit other Utah resorts from here, too.

Orelle, France
Where This charming little resort in the Maurienne valley is made up of 10 
hamlets of slate-roofed stone houses, and has some of the area’s best-value 
accommodation.
Why The skiing is linked by lift over the Col de Rosael to Val Thorens, so you 
can enjoy the slopes of the Trois Vallées at a fraction of the price of staying 
there – and enjoy the off-piste opportunities around the quieter Maurienne 
area, too.
Book Residence Le Hameau des Eaux d’Orelle costs £485 for four people in a 
one-bedroom flat. Price includes Eurotunnel crossing, flights to Geneva extra:

Engelberg, Switzerland
Where It is the nearest resort to Lake Luzern, 1h20m from Zurich airport.
Why This is one of the first resorts in the Alps to get new snow from the 
north or north-west, so conditions are reliable. There’s a glacier and two 
world-class off-piste descents – the Laub and the Galtiburg – as well as 82km 
of pistes and 25 lifts.Prime Ski School <http://www.prime-engelberg.ch/en/home/>

gorgeous little village leading to another on a network of runs. La Villa

.

Madesimo, Italy
Where The small resort is close to the Swiss border and north of Lake Como. 
Why Holidays here are some of the least expensive in the Italian Alps, so

the old customs house, has tasty first courses such ascappellacci pasta parcels

excellent skiing (250km of pistes, 57 lifts), friendly locals and reasonable 
prices. Serre Che comprises a dozen villages, including Le Monêtier-les-Bains, 
a spa town since the 19th century.
Why It’s home to the sort of restaurants you hope to find (a tiny traditional 
chalet, hidden next to a chapel in the woods, log fire, wood-panelled walls, 
warm atmosphere) in a French ski resort but seldom do. They include Le Peyra 
Juana (+33 6 81 11 40 26), which serves delicious pasta, hearty mountain dishes 
and salads.

Good for nightlife
 Ice Q, Sölden 
Sölden, Austria 
Where This resort couldn’t be more different from smaller, quieter neighbour 
Obergurgl. The busy main street buzzes with bars, restaurants and shops. The 
two glaciers mean snow is pretty much guaranteed and the views are spectacular.
Why There are 40 places to eat in town and 30 up the mountain, but the star is 
glass-and-steelIce Q

swim and ski on the same day: the beach and the slopes are less than two hours 
apart, and there’s 95km of pistes, with 32 lifts.

Where Scandinavia’s top resort is close to the Norwegian border and its 100km 
of pistes and 47 lifts are almost deserted midweek. The friendly locals speak 
fluent English and the views are spectacular.
