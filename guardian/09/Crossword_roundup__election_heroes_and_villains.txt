... though you’d have to pay attention to other entries such as PHINEAS, FINN 
and PILLAR BOX to twig that BEVERLEY is the Yorkshire borough contested by 
Anthony TROLLOPE in 1868.

There are parliamentary elections in at least 10 Trollope novels, the 
campaigning usually taking place in the rain, but it’s Ralph the Heir who is 
modelled on the author’s real-life attempt to fight Conservative corruption in 
the form of real-life sitting MP Sir Henry Edwards, the town’s biggest 
employer. Over a third of the electorate took bribes; Trollope finished up at 
the bottom of the poll and later declared the campaign ‘the most wretched 
fortnight of my manhood’.

Still, you can’t blame him for trying, and the experience prompted memorable 
passages, like when the local Tory Mr Pile considers the idea of a politician 
refusing to bribe:
 From Trollope’s Ralph the Heir, p17. Photograph: Google Books 
I’d like to imagine that the creators of the Netflix version of House of Cards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards> might have had 
Trollope’s Sir Thomas Underwood in mind, rather than Democratic House whip 
Oscar Underwood, when re-naming their antihero, Frank Underwood. And that 
brings us to our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue URQUHART?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for SWINGOMETER 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/apr/13/crossword-roundup-swinging-from-the-polls#show-all>
. It seemed right that Peter Snow’s name lent itself so well to the answer, as 
demonstrated by Neijygof’s elaborate “Election Night feature, 2001: Peter Snow 
starts gesticulating wildly, MP walks out” and croquemonsieur’s “Gee Mr. Snow – 
it is complex!”

Among the other lovely anagrams were hectorthebat’s “Shows changes to town’s 
regime” and Middlebro got us in mood for after-hours viewing, however 
uninformative that might be this time, with “It shows where the parties are 
throughout the night.”

Away from politics, alberyalbery went deep inside baseball with “Gnome writes 
anagram indicator” and baerchen was pleasingly misleading with “Debut of 
Wallace and Gromit seen revolutionising outmoded technology used on TV”.

The runners-up are ketmando’s “Spinner of public opinion for proportional 
representation” and MaleficOpus’s “Digital power shower?”; the winner is 
harlobarlo’s flattering acrostic “Started with indicator needle, giving 
objective, mathematical extrapolations towards election results”.

Kudos once more to Harlo; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick 
of the broadsheet cryptics below.


Clue of the Fortnight

Reader Gleety nominated this clue, from Redshank in the FT 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/3a8533d4-e3be-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.pdf>
:

1ac Bottomless caldera melted the young rock in it (6)
[ anagram of ‘caldera’ without the final ‘a’ ]

If you’re already au fait with a caldera as a basin-shaped crater atop a 
volcano, the clue is all the better; if you’re not, the clue is a good reminder 
that you needn’t be put off by not knowing what a word might mean, since you 
might only need to know what letters it contains – an unarguably easier task.

Best of all, though, the use of boldface above obscures how well hidden that 
definition of CRADLE is. Night night, and turn off the lights.
