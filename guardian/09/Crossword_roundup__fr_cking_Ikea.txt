The news in clues

As we get another glimpse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/live/2015/feb/09/hsbc-files-global-reaction#block-54d87080e4b0ac31457e631d>
 of the revolting revolving doors ushering the kleptocratic spirit through 
ministry lobbies,a clue 
<http://independent.co.uk/independent.co.uk/editorial/xword/c_290115.bin> from 
the ever-topicalMorph

 ...

1ac Company to hire a Conservative partner? (11)
[ abbrev. for “Company” + synonym for “hire” + “a” + synonym for “Tory” ]
[ CO + SIGN + A + TORY ]

... for COSIGNATORY seems still more timely.

Latter patter

A newish (well, 1950s) term in a down clue from the Times 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/30a26c96495259da014b02ba256b010f/print_solution/3>
 ...

16d Expressed regret over attempts to extract fuel for car parts (4,5)
[ soundalike for “regret” + soundalike for “attempts to extract fuel” ]
[ soundalike for RUE FRACKS ] 

... takes us to ROOF RACKS. In the modern sense, FRACK is a stunted substitute 
for “fracturing”.

Even the most ardent paid-up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/21/owen-paterson-urgent-meeting-fracking-cuadrilla-lord-browne>
proponents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/17/fracking-lobbyists-matt-damon-promised-land>
 of shale-gas extraction must concede that “fracking” is a word only a lobbyist 
could love: starting out with that “sad and horrid letter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/sep/27/crossword-blog-meet-letter-f>
” and almost getting to that blasted “ck”. Not for nothing is its soundalike

<https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jun/13/whyidontwatchbattlestarga>
’s bowdlerism of choice.

It won’t surprise you to hear that the term predates both these senses. South 
of the border, we have a spin on “fracas”, fromPartridge’s Dictionary of Slang 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/new-partridge-dictionary-of-slang-and-unconventional-english.html>
:

frack. A noisy quarrel, an assault: Soho, London: since ca 1920 (EJ Oliver, 
Not Long to Wait, 1948.)

And from Scotland, we have meanings including gluttonous, and a rare positive 
sense. Here’s William Dunbar in the 16th century ...

 From William Dunbar’s The Agnews of Lochnaw. Photograph: Google Books 
... with FRACK as “lusty”, “strong” or perhaps “vigorous”. In Sweden, it’s 
more loveable still: with a little umlaut-like adornment, FRÄCK means “cheeky”. 
That still doesn’t explain why it’s the name for a perfectly complaisantshaving 
mirror in Ikea <http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/38006200/>. I had 
been given to understand that bathroom fittings weregenerally named after lakes 
and rivers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/feb/04/shopping.retail>. 

But it does bring us, via my favourite Ikea brand name 
<http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/img/local_store_info/ashton/ftp_site_images/Easter_FY13_news.pdf>
, to our next challenge. Meaning “candy foam”, reader, how would you clue GODIS 
SKUM?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for the poker term BLUE-CHIP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/jan/26/crossword-roundup-when-we-all-talk-poker#show-all>
 and especially to alberyalbery for pointing out a few days after we started 
work,the Times had 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/30a26c96495259da014b02badaa60111/print_solution/3>
 “Conservative fast food, thoroughly reliable (4-4)” at 16 down. We enjoy a 
coincidence round these parts.

I was made peckish by ixioned’s tip “This stock should go well with frozen 
fish” and thereby by Truth101’s “Top stock is down a notch”, though not as 
hungry as the protagonist of cmiall’s “Depression followed by one hundred 
joints. High? Quality!”


I also enjoyed the mercantile surfaces in jamesfarrier’s “Apparently spent a 
wedge to make a wedge”, and schroduck’s “As aristocratic blood pouring in Home 
Counties, heads rolling of Wall Street elite”.

The runners-up are Middlebro’s “Low golf shot which is unlikely to fail” and 
yungylek’s “High-quality, low-energy power”; the winner is jonemm’s censorious 
“Rip off the public dodging 33% of tax, like Google and Amazon.” Kudos to Jon; 
please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics 
below.

Clue of the fortnight

In the competition above, Croquemonsieur issued a fine tribute to a local 
setter in “Brendan’s first cryptic clue is stylish and of the highest quality.”

Brendan <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crosswords+profile/brendan> – 
also known as Brian Greer – can be relied on for style, as evidenced bythis 
devious clue <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26479> ...

7d Tin contracted, then expanded as metal (8)
[ truncated version of the word “Tin” treated as a chemical symbol ]

... which recalls the bewilderment in chemistry class regarding why, say, “Ti” 
does not signify TITANIUM.
