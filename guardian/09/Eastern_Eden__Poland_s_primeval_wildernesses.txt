The Polish border with Belarus, on the eastern edge of the EU, may not seem an 
obvious holiday destination but there, largely unknown to British travellers, 
lie two amazing destinations for nature lovers.Białowieża forest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/09/poland-wildlifeholidays>, which 
straddles the border, is the last extensive stretch of the primeval forest that 
once covered all of north-east Europe, while, 100km to the north, the Biebrza 
marshes are among the continent’s most important wetlands.

These two national parks are almost the only places where Europe’s original 
landscape and wildlife can be seen. ButBiałowieża forest has become a new kind 
of front line 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/26/poland-approves-large-scale-logging-in-europes-last-primeval-forest>
, between environmentalists and the Polish government, which this week gave the 
go-ahead to large-scale logging.

Wild bison, which once roamed the continent, are now found only in Białowieża 
(around 300 on the Polish side; 500 in Belarus) along with 58 other species of 
mammals, including wolves and lynx. While almost 142,000 hectares are a Unesco 
world heritage site (stretching over both countries), the forest extends much 
further, and it’s in these unprotected parts that the controversy about logging 
rages, with fears of wider impact on the region’s wildlife.

 Białowieża forest is a mysterious land of fallen trees and abundant wildlife 
In the past, UK visitors to the area were mainly birdwatchers, but several 
companies now cater for people interested in travelling to wild places, 
especially those where top predators still roam. I joined a seven-night spring 
trip withWild Poland <http://wildpoland.com/>, led by its founder, Łukasz 
Mazurek, naturalist and author of thedefinitive guide to wildlife in the forest 
<http://wildpoland.com/shop/bialowieza-site-guide/>.

This is a trip for early birds: we set out from Wejmutka manor hotel 
<http://www.wejmutka.pl/eng/accommodation.php>, a traditional wooden 
guesthouse, at 4am. Łukasz took us to the forest edge, where we watched bison 
emerge, somewhat timidly for such mighty beasts, from the mist – a primitive 
cave painting come to life.

Visitors enter the protected forest through a high wooden gate on which Steven 
Spielberg modelled his entrance to Jurassic Park. Once inside, initial 
resemblances to English woodland dissolve. This untouched forest is dominated 
by oak, lime, bog alder and hornbeam. Much of the area is swampy and feels 
mysterious, especially when we spot black storks skulking in dark pools. Three 
wolf packs live here too, and Łukasz quickly found fresh prints and 
distinctively rank-smelling faeces.

 Both Białowieża and Biebrza are home to wolf packs 
This area has never been exploited or managed, and a unique feature is the 
dead wood decomposing into the forest floor. It looks picturesque, with moss 
and flowers covering fallen trunks, and voles scampering along them, but it is 
also key to the forest’s exceptional biodiversity: the dead wood hosts millions 
of organisms, which in turn sustain incredible numbers of, often rare, birds. 
Numerous species of woodpeckers, flitting about and drumming on the trunks, are 
entirely dependent on standing dead trees.

But outside the strictly-protected zone, state-employed foresters are still 
busily logging, and havesuccessfully campaigned to be allowed to greatly 
increase felling and clearing dead wood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/26/poland-approves-large-scale-logging-in-europes-last-primeval-forest>
 in a bid to fight bark beetle infestation. Environmentalists would like to see 
the whole forest protected: dead wood is key to its ecology, and birds and 
other wildlife move around, and depend on, the whole forest, not just the 
protected area.

 Dead wood provides habitats for birds and mammals 
A trip to Białowieża can be combined with spectacular Biebrza marshes two 
hours’ drive away. The Biebrza and Narew rivers form a mystical, watery 
landscape of meandering waterways, vast reed beds and flooded fields. Distant 
shapes on the horizon resolve into groups of elk or huge flocks of cranes.

You need wellies here for walks through flooded fields, forests of alder 
swamps and peat bogs where a stick disappears up to two metres. You need 
torches, too, for nighttime spotting of fire-bellied toads or beavers on the 
banks of the Narew. These mammals are present in large numbers and it’s easy to 
watch by torchlight as they go about their slightly bonkers-looking business.

As in Białowieża, accommodation is in simple guesthouses aimed at walkers and 
wildlife watchers. We stayed at comfortableDwór Dobarz 
<http://www.dwordobarz.pl/>. To describe its food as hearty is an 
understatement. The breakfast spreads provide your daily calorie count in one 
go, but are irresistible – fresh bread, cheeses and endless varieties of 
sausage. Traditional evening meals are big on wild mushrooms and stuffed 
cabbage. Most of it is organic because areas like this never became otherwise.

 Elk are numerous in Biebrza national park 
Like Białowieża, Biebrza has astonishing biodiversity: again there are lynx 
and several wolf packs, and a strong chance of seeing them. The iconic animal 
here is the elk, which are hard to miss: we stumbled across a new calf. Rather 
comically for an already comic beast, elk calves are born bright orange.

Biebrza is another bird lovers’ paradise: each evening our group of seven 
would bond over vodka and bird lists. White storks nest on village houses and 
are abundant in fields, bitterns boom continuously, and corncrakes and ruffs 
are common. Europe’s rarest passerine bird, the aquatic warbler, has its only 
stronghold here – and with novice twitcher’s luck, I caught a glimpse.

If you tire of wildlife, there’s plenty of (rather dark) history in eastern 
Poland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland>, including Treblinka 
concentration camp, its rail tracks disappearing into forest. Białystok city 
was once mostly Jewish and has a ghetto heritage trail. Villages are mostly 
Belarusian-style, with houses made of wood.

Conservationists are keen to develop sustainable tourism here, to help locals 
realise the value of their environment. Their case couldn’t be more urgent. 
There aren’t many places to glimpse Europe’s wild past.
