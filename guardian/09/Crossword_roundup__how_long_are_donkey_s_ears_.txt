The news in clues

In 1961, Punch magazine opined:

When may a young man be said to have arrived? Adam Faith got a double accolade 
last week, recognition in two fields outside his art: (i) Having a signed 
column in the biggest circulation Sunday paper; (ii) Having his name used as a 
pun in a quality Sunday paper’s erudite crossword puzzle.

Indeed. Featuring unobtrusively in a cryptic clue or expectantly as an answer 
suggests that a setter – whose job it is to judge such things – thinks that the 
general public will be familiar enough with you that you can be part of the 
wordplay without causing alarm.

In the good times, then, you might form part of a hidden answer

, as withEnigmatist’s much-loved clue

[ found within VOLKSWAGENDAIMLER ]

... for HIDDEN AGENDA. If you’re the topic of a theme, you might be much

click here for a rewarding Q&A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/nov/03/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-picaroon>
) offered a reasonable clue ...

4d After climbing, broadcaster screens running for ages (5)
 [ three-letter broadcaster name, surrounding synonym for ‘running’, all 
reversed (‘after climbing’) ]
[ SKY, surrounding ON, all reversed ]

... to a mysterious word, YONKS. It’s of more recent coinage than I’d thought: 
some references go back to “I haven’t seen him for yonks”, in Peter York’s 1982 
Sloane Ranger Handbook; others to the 60s, specifically to an interview quote 
from Julie Driscoll, she who was known for the cover of This Wheel’s on Fire.

As for why “yonks”... Paul Beale (collaborator of slang nabob Eric Partridge) 
remembered having heard it inCyprus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/27/brutality-british-forces-1950s-cyprus>
 back in 1957 and reckoned it had spread from the army, via undergraduates, to 
widespread use:

I propose ex. ‘years, months and weeks’; my contemporary at the Signals 
Regiment in Cyprus, Capt. E. W. Bishop, prefers a telescoping ofdonkey’s years

It’s certainly more colloquial than I had presumed; neither was I aware that 
DONKEY’S YEARS itself had a haw-haw as well as a hee-haw: it’s apparently funny 
because some people didn’t pronounce the “y” when referring to a donkey’s 
undeniably lengthy ears.

Your challenge is another rendering of same: reader, how would you clue the 
18th-century A MONTH OF SUNDAYS, which, it might interest you to know, has not 
always been used solely in the negative ...
 From The Life and Real Adventures of Hamilton Murray, Written by Himself 
(1759). 
... and which briefly mutated into the less-satisfying Victorian A WEEK OF 
SUNDAYS?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for WALLOP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/oct/12/crossword-roundup-putting-someones-lights-out#comments>
. I enjoyed the little trip around the southern reaches of England: jimdubya’s 
“In Cornwall, optimists get the lash”, diplocaulobium’s “Pound initially for 
Westies and Labradors lazing outside Parliament” and ousgg’s clever “Soundly 
beat at one of three Test venues?”

At times like this, you realise how many senses a word like “hit” can have, as 
seen in JollySwagman’s “That’ll be a hit with everyone at work”, baerchen’s 
“Hit the booze” and croquemonsieur’s “Without merit, another Marti Pellow hit?”

Some of my favourite surfaces were Poorsub’s intriguing “Smack after I removed 
a pillow by mistake”, jonemm’s lip-smacking “Fishes dipped in tripe batter” and 
Peshwari’s finger-wagging “Facebook page needs work to make an impact”.

TwoDarrinStephens’ “Allow irregular rapid heartbeat” was pipped for the 
audacity award by ketmando’s idiosyncratic anagram indicator in “Stuff Tinky 
Winky first, Lala (not second) and Po”.

Among a wonderful and bountiful selection, the runners-up are Ojisan’s “Mrs 
Simpson is off work, getting crack” and harlobarlo’s “Swallow inner pride at 
first defeat”; the winner is steveran’s devious “Good hiding places in 
Hampshire”.

Kudos to Steve – please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
