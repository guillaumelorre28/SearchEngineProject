Since we launched our new website in January, we’ve slowly been moving all of 
our content to the new format. We’re now looking at the crosswords section and 
have switched theCrosswords blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog> and Editor’s update 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/crossword-editor-update> to the 
new design, with the puzzles themselves following soon.


Our new crosswords section is a work in progress, and has the following 
features:

 * Optimised for any screen size 
 * Autosaves as you type 
 * Cleaner layout for desktop 
 * Better indication of which puzzles you’ve started from the crosswords front 
We’ll continue to add features as we go. We’re still designing and building 
the following, so they aren’t working just yet:

 * Blind & PS version 
 * AZED crosswords 
 * Archive search 
If you would like to try the new crosswords, click here to opt in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/optin>. It is easy to opt out again by 
clicking the ‘opt out’ link. (This will appear at the top of the crosswords 
section once you’ve opted in to the new version.)

Please let us know what you think or if you spot any defects by dropping us an
