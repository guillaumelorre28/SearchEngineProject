Kersti Kaljulaid, a European Union accountant, won Monday’s vote 81-0, with 20 
members absent or abstaining. Her selection follows two failed votes and weeks 
of heated debate.

Kaljulaid, 46, will succeed the current president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who 
is stepping down next week after two five-year terms in the ceremonial post.

The choice of Kaljulaid, who works at the European court of auditors, became 
possible after the six parliamentary parties agreed to propose a political 
outsider as a single candidate.

Her election came after the failure of an electoral college to choose a 
president from five candidates last month. Politicians were unable to pick a 
president from four candidates in August.
