AWB’s former chairman did not know about $US223m in secret kickbacks to Saddam 
Hussein’s regime

 but could have discovered the truth and stopped the sham payments, a judge has 
ruled.

After a nine-year legal battle, Trevor Flugge has been found guilty of a 
single breach of his duties as a director but cleared of knowing about AWB’s 
payments to Iraq in contravention ofUnited Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations> sanctions, as was former 
senior AWB officer Peter Geary.

AWB’s contracts with the Iraqi Grain Board under the UN oil-for-food program 
were inflated by disguised inland transportation fees, a scandal uncovered 
after the US-led invasion ofIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> that 
toppled Saddam in 2003.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission failed to convince a 
judge that Flugge and Geary knew AWB was making payments to Iraq contrary to UN 
sanctions or that it was well known within AWB that the payments were not 
authorised by the UN.

AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg expressly told Flugge and the board 
about the payments in mid-2000 and that they were authorised by the UN, Justice 
Ross Robson said on Thursday.

But, the judge said, that did not relieve Flugge from the obligation to make 
inquiries when told at a March 2000 meeting in Washington that the UN was 
looking into whether AWB was making improper payments to Iraq, following a 
complaint from the Canadian government.

“The fact that the complaint was being pursued by the UN should have alerted 
him to question whether the UN had knowingly approved what AWB was doing,” 
Robson said.

The judge said had Flugge made inquiries, he would have discovered the UN, 
despite authorising AWB’s wheat sales to Iraq, had not knowingly approved of 
the payments in circumstances where neither Iraq nor AWB had any responsibility 
to deliver wheat within Iraq.

“Flugge would have found the true nature of the trucking payments and that AWB 
was flouting, on a large scale, UN resolutions which, if disclosed, would 
severely damage AWB’s good name and reputation,” Robson said.

He said he was satisfied Flugge, acting with the reasonable degree of care and 
diligence required of him as a director and chairman, would have discovered the 
true state of affairs.

“I am satisfied that if Flugge had done so, he should have brought these 
matters to the attention of the board and if he had done so, the conduct in 
breach of UN sanctions would have been stopped.”

Flugge had maintained he did nothing wrong, with the nine-week trial that 
ended a year ago hearing he believed the UN had approved the payment of the 
inland transportation fees to the Iraqi Grain Board.

Asic had alleged Geary, AWB’s former group general manager trading, breached 
his duties as an officer by not taking reasonable steps to prevent AWB acting 
contrary to the UN sanctions.

But Robson said he was not satisfied Asic had established that Geary acted 
other than reasonably and in accordance with his duties, and dismissed the case 
against him.

Flugge, who faces a fine of up to $200,000 and disqualification from managing 
a corporation, was not in court and Geary left without commenting.

Asic is reviewing the decision, which marks the end of its long-running case 
against former officers of AWB.
