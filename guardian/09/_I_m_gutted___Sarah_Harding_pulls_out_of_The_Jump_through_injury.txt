The 34-year-old said she was “gutted” to be told she could not continue in the 
show after six weeks of training but was proud to “make it this far ... despite 
the ups and downs”.

The Olympic swimming medallist Rebecca Adlington, 27, withdrew from the show 
on medical advice after a shoulder injury. She told the host, Davina McCall, 
that the pain of the fall was “the worst thing that has ever happened to me, it 
was worse than childbirth”.

The Holby City actor Tina Hobley, 44, also left after dislocating her elbow 
and sustaining two fractures to her arm.

The Made In Chelsea cast member Mark-Francis Vandelli, 26, left after 
fracturing his ankle, while the former sprinter Linford Christie, 55, pulled 
out because he was unable to recover in time from a hamstring injury.

The former England rugby player Ben Cohen, 37, who was drafted in after others

Channel 4 said that 46 celebrities had taken part “successfully” in the show’s 
three series, but admitted that the nature of the Alpine competition meant 
there was always an “element of risk”.

Legal experts said that the network may not decide to recommission the show 
following this series.


The first season in 2014 was won by former X Factor winner Joe McElderry, with 
The Only Way Is Essex personality Joey Essex emerging victorious in the second 
series last year.

Contestants have included Heather Mills, Phil Tufnell, Anthea Turner, Steve 
Redgrave and Mike Tindall.


The first episode of the current series had 2.3m viewers – down from the 2.8m 
who tuned in for the debut of the second series.


The penultimate episode of The Jump is broadcast on Sunday at 8pm on Channel 4.
