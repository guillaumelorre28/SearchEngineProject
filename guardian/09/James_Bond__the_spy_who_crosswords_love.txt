The news in clues

Crosswords are not prominent in James Bond’s world. 

Unlike John Le Carré’s cerebral spooks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/08/celebrating-100-years-crossword> 
andtheir real-life counterparts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/may/12/crossword-unsolved-mystery-d-day-puzzles-leonard-dawe>
, Fleming’s/Broccoli’s spies don’t tend to take time out from boozing and 
killing for a puzzle. In Licence Renewed, Bond listens to his targets planning 
their evil ...

‘But with radio signals of that strength – covering Europe and the United 
States – they’ll pinpoint you faster than you can do your Times crossword, 
which is fast.’
‘I told you, Franco. Let me worry.’

... but this is from John Gardner’s official revival of the novels, published 
in 1981. The only crosswords mentioned by Fleming that I know of are in The Spy 
Who Loved Me ...

I made tea for the staff, attended the funerals and got the lists of the 
mourners right, wrote spiky paragraphs for the gossip page, ran the competition 
column, and even checked the clues of the crossword before it went into type.

... where the narrator Vivienne Michel describes her newspaper job while the 
reader wonders whether Bond will ever show up.

The froideur is not, though, mutual. Bond’s boss, Vice Admiral Sir Miles 
Messervy, has long provided setters with a way of indicating the letter M which 
allows for a spot of espionage in a clue’s surface reading. Here’s Beamin a 
recent Telegraph Toughie

there’s been more. Here’sanother Telegraph Toughie

15d Manspreading, perhaps, blighting men’s igloo? (9)
[anagram of MENSIGLOO]

And if you’re not familiar with the NEOLOGISM that begins the clue, here’s a 
primer:

Just as MANSPREADING (Macquarie’s Aussie Word of 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2015/feb/05/mansplain-is-australian-word-of-the-year>
) identifies the practice ofmoving one’s legs  
<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/nyregion/MTA-targets-manspreading-on-new-york-city-subways.html?_r=1http://>
“into a sort of V-shaped slouch, effectively occupying two, sometimes even 
three, seats” on public transport as one that is primarily carried out by 
males, so have other anti-social activities been gendered.

Aggressive walking can now be referred to as MANSLAMMING, while in speech, 
there’s MANTERRUPTING (or BROPROPRIATION). In this paper’sMind Your Language 
series <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language>, Liz Cookman feels
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2015/feb/12/allow-me-to-explain-why-we-dont-need-words-like-mansplain>
 while these neologisms describe real behaviour, and are at first fun to say, 
they’re not ultimately helpful:

They serve to polarise people rather then unite us against gender-based social 
discrepancies and invite absolutism.

“[B]efore we go smooshing any more man-words together,” she concludes, “it 
might be worth remembering that a prat is a prat, whatever their gender.” The 
MAN- prefix seems to have started with a word which is the subject of our next 
challenge.

In 2003, the non-fiction writer Rebecca Solnit went to a party in Aspen 
<http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175584/rebecca_solnit_the_archipelago_of_ignorance>
, where “an imposing man who’d made a lot of money” pompously described a book 
to her, a book that he had not read, but one that she happened to have written. 
Solnit described the experience as one where ...

... forces that are usually so sneaky and hard to point out slither out of the 
grass and are as obvious as, say, an anaconda that’s eaten a cow or an elephant 
turd on the carpet.

And once a phenomenon starkly identifies itself, it tends to get a name. So, 
reader: how would you clue MANSPLAIN?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for A MONTH OF SUNDAYS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/oct/26/crossword-roundup-how-long-are-donkeys-ears>
. I hadn’t anticipated quite how well the phrase lent itself to plausible 
anagrams, such as HipsterPriest’s “Famous, shy and not mad, for a while at 
least” and robinjohnson’s “Of youths and man’s bewildered age”.

Also anagrammatical were steveran’s “amounts of shandy drunk in mega session” 
and alberyalbery’s suggestive “Playing with manhood stays fun for a long time”. 
And my favourite of the sweeter clues was yungylek’s decidedly non-puddingy 
“May perhaps speak about ice creams for far too long”.

The runners-up are Middlebro’s “Many thousands of dire days and days” and 
jonemm’s “Famous Tony: hands cuffed for a long time”, the latter of which was a 
kind of sequel to JollySwagman’s topical “After which Chilcot might report: 
Tony’s a sham – found out”.

Kudos to Swagman; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
