A strong scent of nature wafts through the inexpensive yet stylish corridors 
of the South Tyrol's new Dolomit B&B.

All neutral colours and clean lines, the rooms are individually named after 
herbs, flowers and fruit, and the sauna is engulfed by forest.

Balconies offer Box Brownie views of the mountains and transport is provided 
to nearby slopes.

B&B from £25pp per night.
