How much progress are women really making as public leaders? We’ve gleaned the 
statistics to find out where women are getting to the top, as both public 
officials and parliamentarians.

According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union 
<http://www.ipu.org/english/home.htm>, as of 1 January 2015, there were 152 
heads of state around the globe. Of those, just 10 (6.6%) were women.

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina
Dilma Rousseff, Brazil
Michelle Bachelet, Chile
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia
Dalia Grybauskaitė, Lithuania
Park Geun-hye, South Korea
Atifete Jahjaga, Kosovo
Catherine Samba-Panza, Central African Republic
Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, Malta
Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, Croatia

(Switzerland does not have a single head of state, but Simonetta Sommaruga is 
president of the Swiss confederation and will serve for one year in that 
capacity).

Women in parliaments

Since 1995, when the Beijing Platform for Action on women’s empowerment was 
adopted, the global average of women in parliament has increased from 11.3% to 
22.1%. The number of single or lower houses of parliament where women have more 
than 40% of seats has jumped from one to 13, while the number of all-male 
parliaments has dropped from 10 to five.

The IPU called this “encouraging”, but IPU secretary general Martin Chungong 
also acknowledged that progress had stalled in 2014. The union is calling for 
higher quotas.

Rwanda, where 51 of the 80 parliamentarians in the country women, heads the 
list. The UK, where women hold 148 of the 650 seats in parliament, is 56th in 
the list, just below Kyrgyzstan, and the US is joint 72nd with Panama.

Regional facts 

 * The Americas in the lead. The region has seen the percentage of female MPs 
rise from 12.7% in 1995 to 26.4% in 2015

 * Sustained progress in Europe. There has been a rise in female MPs across 
Europe from 13.2% in 1995 to 25% in 2015. The only country in Europe with fewer 
women MPs in 2015 than in 1995 is Hungary, which saw a 1.3 percentage point 
drop. 
 * Breakthroughs in Africa. Sub-Sahara Africa has achieved some of the most 
dramatic breakthroughs in the past 20 years, often in post-conflict situations. 
The number of female MPs has risen from 9.8% in 1995 to 22.3% in 2015. 
 * Asia at a standstill. Asia has failed to keep pace with the rest of the 
world on this issue. The number of female MPs has risen from 13.2% in 1995 to 
18.5% 
 * Arab region yet to deliver. The region made gains in women’s political 
rights during the past 20 years with women gaining suffrage in Kuwait, Oman, 
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates in that time. These gains have not 
been reflected in political representation, although the number of female 
parliamentarians has risen to 16.1% since 1995. 
 * Pacific still resistant to change. The Pacific remains the region with the 
lowest average for women in parliament in 2015, with just 15.7% female 
parliamentarians - progress due largely to gains in Australia and New Zealand. 
Female public leaders in the G20 countries

Canada remains at the top of EY’s index of female public sector leaders in G20 
countries 
<http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Newsroom/News-releases/News-EY-women-remain-underrepresented-in-senior-public-sector-leadership-across-g20>
. The index includes politicians, public servants and women on private boards. 
Women account for 45.9% of leaders in the Canadian public sector.

South Africa’s framework of targets and affirmative action has placed the 
country’s women relatively high in all three areas – public sector, 
parliamentary representation and private boards. South Korea and Japan perform 
poorly in all three.
