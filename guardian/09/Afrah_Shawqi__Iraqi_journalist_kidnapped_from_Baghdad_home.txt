Gunmen have kidnapped an Iraqi journalist after posing as members of the 
security forces and bursting into her home in Baghdad, according to authorities.


Afrah Shawqi was abducted on Monday at around 10pm from her home in a southern 
neighbourhood of the capital, said Ziad al-Ajili, head of the Journalistic 
Freedoms Observatory.

“Eight armed men burst into her house in Saidiya dressed in plain clothes and 
entered by pretending to belong to the security forces,” he said.

“They tied up her son and stole mobile phones, computers and cash before 
kidnapping Afrah and fleeing.”

The report was confirmed by a source in Iraq’s interior ministry who spoke on 
condition of anonymity.

Shawqi, 43, is employed by Asharq al-Awsat, a London-based pan-Arab newspaper, 
as well as a number of news websites, including Aklaam.

On Monday she published an article criticising armed groups that “act with 
impunity” inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.

The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, condemned her abduction and ordered 
the security services to do their utmost find her and track down those 
responsible.

Press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) voiced concern and urged 
Abadi to make good on his pledge to find her “as soon as possible”.

“We are extremely concerned and firmly condemn this abduction,” said the RSF 
chief editor Virginie Dangles.

“We urge the prime minister to keep his word to do everything possible to find 
Afrah Shawqi and those responsible for taking her.

“We also point out that the government has a duty to improve the safety of 
journalists in Iraq.”

The watchdog gave Shawqi’s age as 38 and said she was also the “head of 
women’s issues for the Iraqi culture ministry and is active in the defence of 
human rights”.

Seven journalists have been killed in the country in 2016, according to RSF,

Freedom Index.
