Iraqi troops backed by US-led airstrikes have pushed deeper into eastern Mosul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mosul> in a multi-pronged assault after a 
two-week lull in the operation to retake the Islamic State-held city.

Elite special forces pushed into the Karama and Quds neighbourhoods, while 
army troops and federal police advanced into the nearby areas of Intisar, Salam 
and Sumor. Smoke rose across the city as explosions and machine gun fire echoed 
through the streets.

Stiff resistance by the militants, civilians trapped inside their houses and 
bad weather have slowed advances in the more than two-month-old offensive to
recapture Iraq’s second largest city

Iraqi military operation since the 2003 US-led invasion.

Lt Gen Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, commander of the special forces in eastern Mosul, 
said on Tuesday that his forces had been bolstered by reinforcements and were 
now less than two miles from the Tigris river which divides the city. A 
coalition airstrike this week destroyed the last remaining bridge over the 
river.

The special forces, officially known as the Counter Terrorism Service, have 
done most of the fighting, pushing in from the east. Regular army troops on the 
city’s south-east and northern edges, as well as militarised federal police 
further west, have not moved in weeks, unable to penetrate the city.

The troops have faced gruelling urban fighting, often going house to house 
against Isis militants who have had more than two years to dig in and prepare. 
Even in districts that have been recaptured, Iraqi troops have faced surprise 
attacks, shelling and car bombs. The extremists have launched more than 900 car 
bombs against Iraqi troops in and around Mosul.

Saadi said he expected Iraqi forces would drive Isis from Mosul and the rest 
of Nineveh province within three months. Iraqi leaders had previously vowed to 
drive the extremists from Mosul by the end of 2016.

Isis captured Mosul in the summer of 2014 when it swept across much of 
northern and centralIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> and the 
group’s leader declared the establishment of its self-styled caliphate from the 
pulpit of a Mosul mosque.

The city is still home to about a million people but roughly 120,000 have fled 
since the operation began on 17 October, according to the United Nations.
