Next in our toolkit for the cryptic-curious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners>
, a device that benefits us all, setter and solver alike.

When a clue uses a word like “I” or “she”, the little cryptic recipe that we 
call a clue can have the feel of a diary entry, even the start of a short 
story. Good news for the solver.

And for the setter – well, we’ll see. 


Newcomers: do remember, as you read what follows, that a cryptic clue normally 
has a definition of the answer (indicated inbold) at either the beginning or 
the end of the clue. The rest is wordplay.

How does it work?

Here is a clue so concise that it works as an introduction to cryptics in 
general. Two routes to the same answer:

12ac Man’s going to fire (4)
[ synonym for “man’s going to” ]

Araucaria <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/24467> gives us a 
paraphrase of “he’ll”, followed by another word for fire, and indeed the 
answer: HELL.

If we switch gender – and I hope you’re ahead of me – we get this from the 
Times Jumbo 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/30a26c9643bffced014570a569a900c0/print_solution/3>
 ...

3d The lady is going to Hull (5)
[ synonym for “the lady is going to” ]

... where “she’ll” helps us see that to hull a walnut is the same as to SHELL 
one. Not Hell, but Hull.

It’s not always that simple

If every clue used only one device, then cryptics wouldn’t be as popular as 
they are. More often, you’ll find that the “he”s and “she”s are combined with 
something else.Here’s Pasquale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25810> ...

1ac Affair makes the woman explode (7)
[ synonym for “the woman” + synonym for “explode” ]

... adding SHE to BANG to get the answer: an affair, a SHEBANG. 

Or the rest of the clue might involve one of the other tricks we’ve been 
looking at in this series. Philistinedeploys an anagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25379> ... 

19d The woman’s in a tizzy, causing rupture (6)
[ synonym for “the woman” + anagram (“tizzy”) of “in a” ]
[ HER + anagram of INA ]

... and adds it to HER for the answer HERNIA. Rapture!

What to look out for

In the English language, a lot of words begin with that variant of “in-”, 
“im-”. And plenty of others end with a familiar suffix indicating inclination 
or quality: “-ive”.

These might be “I’m” and “I’ve” in the crossword world. Or – as we saw when we 
talked about setters talking about themselves 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/nov/18/crossword-blog-cryptic-beginners-myself>
 – this might be expressed as “the setter is”, “one has” or any number of 
natural-sounding pieces of language. Here’sone, from Enigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26450>:

17ac Showing admiration, Enigmatist is doing Mr Rusbridger’s job! (9)
[ synonym for “Engimatist is” + jocular description of the Guardian editor ]
[ I’M + “PRESS ED” ]

IMPRESSED?

It’s fair to say that YOUVE, for example, and THEYLL crop up less often – but 
once you’ve got into the habit of contracting things down to a HES (via “he’s”) 
or a HIS, more and more clues will satisfyingly yield their secrets.


And watch out for ...

Every so often, the setter will draw on some dustier pronouns. From the 
Times’s quick cryptic <http://feeds.thetimes.co.uk/timescrossword/20141024/297> 
...

22ac Shop you had with a number of floors (8)
[ synonym for “shop” + synonym for “you had” ]
[ STORE + YE’D ]

... it’s an archaic “you had” that leads us to STOREYED. Sometimes the setter 
will indicate that obsolete language is in play, but not always – so if all 
else fails, consider whether a THEE or a THOU might make something happen.

Over to you

Beginners: any questions? Seasoned solvers: any favourite examples? I was 
impressed by this, from Commoner:

1d That woman’s in bed, rising with energy, one expects (6-2-2)
[ synonym for “that woman” inside a synonym for “bed” backwards + abbrev. for 
“energy” ]
[ HER inside MOTTOB + E]

It’s a down clue, so the “bed, rising” is BOTTOM (as in the sea bed) written 
upwards, with HER inside and an E on the end. MOTHER-TO-BE. Radiant!
