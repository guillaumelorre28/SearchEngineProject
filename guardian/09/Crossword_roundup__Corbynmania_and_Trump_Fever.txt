The news in clues

He is derided, even despised, by his party’s senior machinery, which can only 
make him more popular with the many party members who rage against that machine.

We could be talking about one of two men 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/08/2020-president-donald-trump-visits-prime-minister-jeremy-corbyn-here-s-what-happens>
 who have had crosswording cameos. Ina Telegraph Toughie 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=26530>, Sparks (
known locally as Monk <http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~mark/crosswords/>) 
deployed as much misdirection as could possibly be considered fair in a clue …

21d Best businessman in America (5)
[synonym for the verb “best”]

… using Donald TRUMP. Other definitions are of course available:

@TheDailyShow <https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow> You know "Trump" means "to 
fart" in England, right?

Meanwhile in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26643>, Picaroon (read our Q&A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/nov/03/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-picaroon>
) had some jocose advice for Liz Kendall and her fellow travellers:

24ac An attempt is ultimately futile to defend New Labour (7)
[paraphrase “an attempt” + “is” + last letter of “futile”, containing 
abbreviation for “new”]
[A GO + IS + E, containing N]

… that they are right to AGONISE over one of Collins Dictionary’s July Words 
in the News 
<http://www.collinsdictionary.com/words-and-language/blog/corbynmania-gig-economy-and-operation-stack-julys-words-in-the-news,236,HCB.html>
: not the national problem of the GIG ECONOMY, but the more local issue of 
CORBYNMANIA.

Latter patter

“The Donald” also featured in Eimi’s recent Independent clue …

3d Be encouraged by Trump, perhaps (4,5)
[example of how one may trump when playing cards]

… for TAKE HEART. The rest of the puzzle took as its theme bringing people 
together, rather thandriving them apart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/jul/14/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-immigrants-us-mexico-video>
 and gave us a tour around various social networks. Had you ever noticed that 
“Instagram” is an anagram of the diagnostic test GRAM STAIN? You have now.

 Thirteen across was in fact SOCIAL NETWORK, which meant that it could be used 
to help evoke a malodorous sense …


16d 13 confront personal hygiene problem well (8)
[synonym for “confront” + abbrev for “personal hygiene problem” + synonym for 
“well”]
[FACE + BO + OK]

… of FACEBOOK. It also reminded us of the saddest of URLs: the social networks 
whose moment in the sun has passed, such as MYSPACE, once said to gather more 
page impressions than Google. Also evocative of that era is the address
thefacebook.com <http://thefacebook.com/>, which first adopters can still 
happily use. Facebook is hardly the first body to undergo such a rebrand. Robin 
Lane Fox has urged his readers to take note:

Let us then stand up for “the”

… noting the tendency of institutions such as the Tate, the National Trust and 
the Chelsea flower show to mislay their definite articles. In pop music, this 
can be loaded with baffling significance:the Madness

 were more sombre than Madness, butSweet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/01/20-best-glam-rock-songs-all-time>

With one band, the subject of our next challenge, it is enjoyably hard to work 
out the effect of adding or subtracting a “the”: reader, how would you clue the

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for POLYORCHID 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/aug/03/crossword-roundup-why-are-blue-moons-getting-more-frequent>
, and what a lot of question marks and exclamation marks. Lovely.

The term lent itself well to allusive descriptions, such as alberyalbery’s 
“Extra seedy ballroom”, jimdubya’s “As nutty as Hitler and Goring combined?” 
and ousgg’s “Multiple flowers, perhaps, resulting from excessive seeding?”

It also offered plenty of wordplay promise, met by ixioned’s “Hung like Uncle? 
Lordy! Chop one off!” and ComedyPseudonym’s “Awfully poorly and got bollocked? 
Excessively so!”

Schroduck seemed oddly well matched to the challenge across various clues and 
gets the audacity award either for a well-placed reference tomy other day job 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lskhg>, or for the baroque “Oddly poor, 
oddly rich, oddly heartless, oddly accommodating, and perhaps oddly nutty”.

The runners-up are ID2155366’s prim-sounding “Porch has doily set for extra 
nuts” and alberyalbery’s delicious “Having a threesome in the sack, say”; the 
winner is steveran’s smart “Case of crotch droopily misshapen”.

Kudos to steveran; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

The solver did not need to know about Bob Monkhouse’s renowned (and pilfered) 
catalogue of funnies to appreciate theTimes setter’s
