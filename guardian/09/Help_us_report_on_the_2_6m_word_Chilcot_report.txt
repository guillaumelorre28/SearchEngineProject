While we have some of the Guardian’s top people inside the lock-in to get 
through as much of the Chilcot report (or at least its summary) as possible in 
three hours, the full publication is about 2.6m words long, or almost 
four-and-a-half times as long as War and Peace. It will take days to read 
properly. And so we’re hoping you could help.

The entire report will be published online <http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/> on 
Wednesday once Sir John Chilcot has finished his public statement. If you’re 
reading through the report and you spot an interesting fact or snippet you 
think we’ve missed, it would be great if you could let us know – we’ve set up a 
form below for contributions.

What sort of things might be interesting? You can probably guess, but there’s 
also a few pointersin our article from this morning about six questions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/six-questions-the-chilcot-report-must-answer>
 Chilcot must answer. Any assistance we can get to understand the report and 
its implications as fast as possible will be hugely appreciated.


When filling in the form please include the relevant page number and paragraph 
that you are referring to.


We’ll let you know as we go along if there’s anything more specific we’d like 
you to help us with.
