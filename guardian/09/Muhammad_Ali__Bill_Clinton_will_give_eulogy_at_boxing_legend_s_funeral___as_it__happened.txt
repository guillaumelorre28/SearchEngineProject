We’re going to close our rolling coverage of reaction to the death of Mohammad 
Ali, aged 74, late Friday.

 * The legendary boxer died of septic shock after several days in the hospital 
with a severe respiratory illness, his family said through a spokesperson. He 
did not suffer, they said. Ali’s daughter Hana said that her father’s heart 
kept beating 30 minutes after his other organs failed, “Our hearts are 
literally hurting,” she wrote. “But we are so happy daddy is free now.”

 * Ali’s funeral will be held Friday in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, 
the family said, and be preceded by a public procession. Former president Bill 
Clinton, Billy Crystan and Bryant Gumbel will deliver eulogies. 
 * Barack Obama led tributes to Ali from around the world, saying that Ali’s 
battle against Parkinson’s “ravaged his body but couldn’t take the spark from 
his eyes. Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We 
are all better for it.” 
 * Former opponents also memorialized the late boxer. George Foreman said he 
found Ali “one of the greatest human beings I’ve ever met in my life. I got 
beat up in the jungle. We never had any arguments until we met in the ring that 
night. I hit him with everything and I had, and all he would say is, ‘That all 
you got, George?’ What a night. Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and myself were one 
guy – we lived through each other. A big piece of me died when he passed away, 
and I call it the greatest piece.”

Yet another historical episode largely forgotten in the sheer scope of Ali’s 
life: his 1990 trip to Iraq, after the invasion of Kuwait, in which he 
negotiated the release of 15 American hostages held by Saddam Hussein.

ESPN produced a short documentary in its 30-for-30 series on the remarkable 
episode, during which Ali visited schools, prayed at a Baghdad mosque and met 
Hussein. “We hope and pray there is not a war,” he told Iraqi officials. “And 
with the little authority from the fame that I have I’ll show the real side of 
Iraq.”

The White House of George HW Bush disapproved of the meeting but Ali managed 
to bring the Americans back to the US. “God works through people,” Ali told a 
former hostage. “It’s not me.”

A little more than a month later the US invaded in Operation Desert Storm, in 
what became the first Iraq war.

And a historical note on the cemetery where Ali will be buried this week in 
his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.

Cave Hill Cemetery is so named because of the cave from which a spring flowed 
that helped feed into a creek in the larger Louisville area, during the city’s 
early years in the mid-19th century. The cemetery is the burial site of 
Revolutionary war hero George Rogers Clark, the man who designed the original 
Confederate flag (Nicola Marshall), and two 20th century sculptors: Enid 
Yandell and Jeptha Barnard Barney Bright IV.

Also interred in Cave Hill is Joshua Fry Speed, Abraham Lincoln’s close friend 
and law partner. The friends disagreed about slavery: Speed believed it was an 
issue for states to decide. But he remained Lincoln’s friend through the 
presidency, and held a memorial in Louisville after his assassination.
Jonathan M. Katz (@KatzOnEarth) 
Ali getting buried at Cave Hill is amazing. He'll be next to Louisville's 
founders, Union & Confederate soldiers, and Lincoln's law partner.

Barack Obama has called Lonnie Williams, Ali’s wife, “to offer his family’s 
deepest condolences for the passing of her husband”, the White House has said 
in a statement.
Per Deputy Press Secretary Jennifer Friedman:

The President expressed to Lonnie how fortunate he and the First Lady felt to 
have met Muhammad, and noted that the outpouring of love since his death is a 
true testament to his remarkable life. He recounted how special it was to have 
witnessed “The Champ” change the arc of history.
President Obama (@POTUS) 
He shook up the world, and the world's better for it. Rest in peace, Champ.

Another rarely seen side of Ali: the astute film critic. He sat down with late 
critic Roger Ebert to watch Rocky II in 1979.

“A great movie,” he said. “A big hit. It has all the ingredients. Love, 
violence, emotion. The excitement never dulled.”

What do you think about the way the fight turned out?

“For the black man to come out superior,” Ali said, “would be against 
America’s teachings. I have been so great in boxing they had to create an image 
like Rocky, a white image on the screen, to counteract my image in the ring. 
America has to have its white images, no matter where it gets them. Jesus, 
Wonder Woman, Tarzan and Rocky.”

You can read the whole interview/review here 
<http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/watching-rocky-ii-with-muhammad-ali>, and 
see what Ali was talking about in the clip below.

In an episode largely forgotten among the many other outsize moments of his 
life and career,Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> 
once coaxed a suicidal man down from a ninth-story ledge in Los Angeles.

The man had climbed out from a window and was shouting “I’m no good, I’m going 
to jump.”

“Police, a psychologist and a minister had all but given up,” the CBS anchor 
said that day in January 1981, “When Mohammad Ali, who happened to be nearby, 
volunteered to talk to him.”

The report said that Ali, from a nearby window, told the man: “I’m your 
brother, I want to help you.”

Funeral on Friday in Louisville, Bill Clinton to speak – spokesman

Martin Pengelly

The Ali family spokesman Bob Gunnell has been speaking in Scottsdale, Arizona, 
discussing arrangements for the great boxer’s funeral.

All of Ali’s family members had a day to say their final goodbyes, Gunnell 
said, adding that it was “a beautiful thing to watch which displayed all that 
was good about Muhammad Ali”.

“The Champ would have been very proud of his family,” he added.

Ali was hospitalized on Monday night, Gunnell said, in fair condition. That 
was expected to continue as it had before, leading to improvement, only for it 
to become clear “in the last 24 hours” that he would not improve. Ali’s 
official time of death, Gunnell said, was 9.10pm MST on Friday, and the cause 
of death was septic shock due to unspecified natural causes. He did not suffer.

Before discussing Ali’s death, Gunnell detailed plans for Ali’s funeral, which 
was planned with Ali’s involvement and will be an interfaith service lead by a 
Muslim imam.

“Muhammad Ali was truly the people’s champion,” Gunnell said, adding that the 
celebration will therefore be open to everyone. “Lonnie [Ali’s wife] and the 
entire family invite everyone to join them for the celebration in Muhammad 
Ali’s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.”

Ali’s body will return to Kentucky from Arizona in 24- to 48-hours time, 
Gunnell said, with family members accompanying him. The celebration of his life 
will begin on Thursday with a private family ceremony. The next morning, 
Friday, the family will gather at the funeral home, where they will be joined 
by the imam presiding.

There will then be a procession through streets of Louisville, he continued, 
“to allow anyone who is there from the world to celebrate with him”. Ali’s body 
will pass by the Muhammad Ali Center and the procession will then travel down 
the street named after him,Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> Boulevard. It will follow the 
route of the parade that greeted Ali, then Cassius Clay, home from the Rome 
Olympics in 1960, and end at Cave Hill cemetery for a private interment 
ceremony.

At 2pm a memorial service will begin. It will be interfaith, directed by an 
imam but including clerics from a number of religions. The “funeral plans were 
done years ago by Mr Ali, who discussed them personally”, Gunnell said.

Former senator Orrin Hatch will represent the Mormon faith, Gunnell said, and 
President Bill Clinton, Bryant Gumbel and Billy Crystal will give eulogies. A 
private reception will follow at the Muhammed Ali Center.

Basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has written a Facebook tribute to his 
“friend and mentor” Muhammad Ali: “I may be 7’2’’ but I never felt taller than 
when standing in his shadow.”

During my more than 50 years in the public eye, I have met hundreds of 
renowned celebrities, artists, athletes, and world leaders. But only a handful 
embodied the self-sacrificing and heroic qualities that defined my friend and 
mentor,Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>.

A master of self-promotion, he declared early in his boxing career, I am the 
greatest! This kind of boasting enraged many people, just as he’d hoped, 
ensuring a large audience that just wanted to see this upstart boy taught a 
lesson. But it was Muhammad who taught the lesson because, as he once said, 
It’s not bragging if you can back it up. And back it up, he did. Again and 
again. And not just in the ring.

Part of Muhammad’s greatness was his ability to be different things to 
different people. To sports fans he was an unparalleled champion of the world, 
faster and smarter than any heavyweight before. To athletes, he was a model of 
physical perfection and shrewd business acumen.

To the anti-establishment youth of the 1960s, he was a defiant voice against 
the Vietnam War and the draft. To the Muslim community, he was a pious pioneer 
testing America’s purported religious tolerance.

To the African-American community, he was a black man who faced overwhelming 
bigotry the way he faced every opponent in the ring: fearlessly.

At a time when blacks who spoke up about injustice were labeled uppity and 
often arrested under one pretext or another, Muhammad willingly sacrificed the 
best years of his career to stand tall and fight for what he believed was 
right. In doing so, he made all Americans, black and white, stand taller. I may 
be 7’2” but I never felt taller than when standing in his shadow.

Today we bow our heads at the loss of a man who did so much for America. 
Tomorrow we will raise our heads again remembering that his bravery, his 
outspokenness, and his sacrifice for the sake of his community and country 
lives on in the best part of each of us.

Ali's daughter: his heart kept beating after organs failed

Hana Ali, daughter of the legendary boxer, has posted a brief statement 
<https://twitter.com/Hanayali/status/739138206524805122> online. 

“Our hearts are literally hurting,” she writes. “But we are so happy daddy is 
free now.”

We all tried to stay strong and whispered in his ear, “You can go now. We will 
be okay. We love you. Thank you. You can go back to God now.”

All of us were around him hugging and kissing him and holding his hands, 
chanting the Islamic prayer. All of his organs failed but his HEART wouldn’t 
stop bearing. For 30 minutes … his heart just keep beating. No one had ever 
seen anything like it. A true testament to the strength of his Spirit and Will!

Thank you all for your love and support!

The family is due to deliver a statement at 3pm ET today.

Former president George W Bush has also released a statement honoring Ali. It 
reads:

Laura and I are saddened by the death of Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>, The Greatest of All Time. I 
gave Ali the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 and wondered aloud how he 
stayed so pretty throughout so many fights.

“It probably had to do with his beautiful soul. He was a fierce fighter adn 
he’s a man of peace, just like Odessa and Cassius Clay Sr believed their son 
could be.”

Muhammad Ali was an iconic and historic figure who thrilled entertained, 
influenced and inspired millions. Americans will always be proud to have been 
in his corner and called him one of our own.

Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Muhammad Ali’s family and 
friends.

Cassius Clay is a boxer who can throw the jive better than anybody you will 
probably ever meet anywhere. And right there is why I will meet Sonny Liston 
for the heavyweight championship of the world next week in Miami Beach. And 
jive is the reason also why they took my picture looking at $1 million in cold 
cash. That’s how much money my fists and my mouth will have earned by the time 
my fight with Liston is over. Think about that. A southern colored boy has made 
$1 million just as he turns 22. I don’t think it’s bragging to say I’m 
something a little special.”

was unable to attend the late February launch of the I Am the Greatest 
exhibition, which features his most famous TV interviews along with items such 
as the “fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee” robe and the split gloves he 
used to defeat British champ Henry Cooper at 1963 Wembley stadium in 1963.

Cooper felled the then Cassius Clay in the fourth round with his trademark 
left hook and appeared on the verge of victory, but Ali’s trainer, Angelo 
Dundee, argued that one of Ali’s gloves was torn and required replacement. The 
referee refused, but their argument bought Ali several extra seconds to 
recover. He then won a technical knockout of Cooper by opening a gash in the 
lighter, slower fighter’s forehead.


Cooper lost to Ali again in London in 1966 and died in 2011. Ali later 
recalled how Cooper’s left hook that felled him was so hard, “my ancestors in 
Africa felt it”.

Haye: Ali showed 'anything's achievable'
 David Haye. Photograph: Steve Paston/PA 
David Haye, the former two-weight British world champion, said he would not 
have taken up boxing if it wasn’t forMuhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> - and even named his eldest 
son, Cassius Haye, after him.

“I wanted to have what Muhammad Ali had, he was the pinnacle of what a boxer 
could be. I came from humble beginnings as he did, and he showed that hard 
work, focus, dedicating your life to something, anything’s achievable,” he told 
the BBC.

Haye said that when faced Nikolai Valuev in 2009 in a world championship 
fight, he adopted Ali’s tactics of moving quickly and avoiding punches to 
defeat his 7ft opponent and win the title Ali once heldHJ, an achievement he 
called a “lifelong ambition”.

Haye said he admired Ali for “putting his life on the line” for his political 
beliefs - particularly his stance on the Vietnam war - and for “changing 
boxing” with his ringside showmanship.

More tributes for the boxer have been coming in. 

A spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said:

Mr Ali was far more than a legendary boxer; he was a world champion for 
equality and peace. With an incomparable combination of principle, charm, wit 
and grace, he fought for a better world and used his platform to help lift up 
humanity.”

Rev Jesse Jackson, a longtime friend, said: 

He sacrificed the heart of his career and money and glory for his religious 
beliefs about a war he thought unnecessary and unjust. His memory and legacy 
lingers on until eternity. He scarified, the nation benefited. He was a 
champion in the ring, but, more than that, a hero beyond the ring. When 
champions win, people carry them off the field on their shoulders. When heroes 
win, people ride on their shoulders. We rode on Muhammad Ali’s shoulders.”

There is a fascinating piece from the Hollywood bible, Variety 
<http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/muhammad-ali-dead-74-media-star-variety-1201788843/>
, about the publication’s coverage of Muhammad Ali. His first mention came in 
the 1 December, 1961 edition, but Ali did not make it to page one until 30 
January, 1963. That edition featured a dispatch from Pittsburgh on “the 
colorful young heavyweight” and his knockout of Charlie Powell.

Variety declared: “Never in the history of the city has a public figure 
dominated the news media as Brassius Cassius.” Ali made the rounds of local TV 
and public events and caused a stir simply by walking down the street. The 
story features generous examples of Ali’s verse including this gem: “If I say a 
mosquito can pull a plow/Just hitch him up and don’t ask how.”

But the highlight without a doubt is: 

Variety even gave a good review to Ali’s one and only comedy album, I Am the 
Greatest, released by Columbia Records in 1963, months before he claimed his 
first heavyweight championship title.

Flags lowered in Louisville

Flags in Louisville, Kentucky, Muhammad Ali’s hometown, have been lowered to 
half mast following a short ceremony led by the city’s mayor, during which he 
warmly remembered the former heavyweight champion’s childhood in the city.


“Muhammad Ali belongs to the world but he only has one hometown,” said Mayor 
Greg Fischer, as a small crowd applauded. “The Louisville Lip spoke to 
everyone, but we heard him in a way that no-one else could, as our brother, our 
uncle and our inspiration.”

The Mayor’s office said flags will remain at half mast until Ali is laid to 
rest in the city, which is home to theMuhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> Center, a museum and cultural 
facility dedicated to his legacy and where he made his last formal appearance 
in October 2015.

Fischer paid tribute to the local institutions that helped forge Ali’s early 
identity, reminding the crowd Ali had graduated from Louisville central high 
school in 1960 and was born in the local hospital on 17 January 1942.


“Imagine that day, that little boy, eyes wide open looking around the room at 
the old Louisville general hospital, not knowing the life that awaited him. The 
life he would make. The world he would shake up, and the people he would 
inspire.”


Fischer also recalled an anecdote from Ali’s early adolescence when his red 
bicycle was stolen in front of a downtown gym. “[He] told police officer Joe 
Martin that he wanted to ‘whoop’ whoever took it. And Martin said: ‘you better 
learn to box first’”.

As three Louisville metro police officers lowered the stars and stripes 
outside the Mayor’s office, a young boy in the crowd could be seen saluting.

 Sello Hatang, head of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, has issued a statement  
<https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/statement-from-the-nelson-mandela-foundation-on-the-death-of-muhammad-ali>
following Muhammad Ali’s death:

Nelson Mandela, a boxing enthusiast most of his life, acknowledged Ali as his 
boxing hero. Madiba had great respect for his legacy and spoke with admiration 
of Ali’s achievements.”

A photograph of Ali and Mandela together sat next to the former president’s 
desk at his foundation, Hatang said, and Mandela’s favourite book at the office 
in his later years was an autographed copy of the Ali biography Greatest of All 
Time.

The statement included a comment Mandela made at an event in Washington DC in 
1990: “There is one regret I have had throughout my life: that I never became 
the boxing heavyweight champion of the world.”

Obama pays tribute

US president Barack Obama has paid tribute to Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/barack-obama-pays-tribute-to-muhammad-ali>
 in a heartfelt statement:

Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we’re 
also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a 
while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time.

In my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves on 
display, just under that iconic photograph of him - the young champ, just 22 
years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston.

I was too young when it was taken to understand who he was - still Cassius 
Clay, already an Olympic gold medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual 
journey that would lead him to his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his 
power, and set the stage for his return to greatness with a name as familiar to 
the downtrodden in the slums of South East Asia and the villages of Africa as 
it was to cheering crowds in Madison Square Garden.”

James Lawton has written this lovely piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/commentisfree/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-physical-decline-extraordinary-spirit>
 on Ali’s enduring spirit in the face of physical decline:

We are mourning not just the passing of the greatest fighter in history but a 
presence in our lives which, however haltingly, never ceased to speak of the 
possibilities of the human spirit.

Anyone who happened to be around him in the climactic phase of his career had 
to be aware of the dangers that he was courting. But almost to the end, on a 
chilly night in the Nevada desert in 1980 when he was pounded to a cruel defeat 
by his former sparring partner Larry Holmes, there was a belief, however 
irrational, that somehow he would find a way to beat the attrition of the 
years. He was, after all, a miracle of his species.

Ali's physical decline could not mask his extraordinary spirit

Muhammad Ali dead at 74 – summary

 * The world is mourning the death of boxing legend, Muhammad Ali, who has 
died aged 74 after being admitted to a hospital in Pheonix on Thursday. Ali had 
suffered from Parkinson’s syndrome since 1984. His condition was complicated by 
a respiratory illness. An announcement over funeral arrangements will be made 
late on Saturday. Ali will be buried in Louisville, according to local media. 
 * President Obama released a statement with his wife Michelle Obama, saying: 
“Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it.” Bill Clinton 
described Ali’s talent as “a blend of beauty and grace, speed and strength that 
may never be matched again.” 
 * The world of boxing has paid tribute. His great rival George Foreman put it 
beautifully: “You know what, I found Muhammad Ali to be one of the greatest 
human beings I’ve ever met in my life. I got beat up in the jungle. We never 
had any arguments until we met in the ring that night. I hit him with 
everything and I had, and all he would say is, ‘That all you got, George?’ What 
a night. Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and myself were one guy – we lived through 
each other. A big piece of me died when he passed away, and I call it the 
greatest piece.” 
 * Frank Bruno said Ali was an “inspiration, mentor, my friend, an Earthly god 
of humanity, simply the greatest”. YorkshiremanRichard Dunn, who lost to Ali in 
1976, said: “When we’ve long gone they’ll still be talking about him and it’ll 
be worthwhile as well.” 
 * Carl Froch paid tribute, saying “generations later people are still 
watching his fights and are still mesmerised by the way he worked,” andPrince 
Naseemadded: “He deserves to be put on a platform which couldn’t be built by 
human hands.”Amir Khan said: “No fighter or sportsman will ever reach the level 
of Ali, whose name will continue to echo through the ages.” 
 * Other sporting icons have paid tribute, including his friend Pele: “The 
sporting universe has just suffered a big loss.Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> was my friend, my idol, my 
hero. The sadness is overwhelming.” Tiger Woods posted on Twitter: “You’ll 
always be The Greatest for more than just what you did in the ring.”Sachin 
Tendulkar said: “My hero since childhood. I always had a wish to meet you some 
day but now it will never happen. RIP The Greatest.”

 * Interviewer Michael Parkinson said: “He was the most extraordinary man I’ve 
ever met, and I’ve met a few. His charisma was palpable.” Facebook

The former world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan: 

He was 6ft 3in and 18 stone and he was walking round the ring like he was 
floating on air. He brought style and artistry to the game.

What he did was magnificent. He offered himself up for the African-American 
people to make a difference. He had courage in the ring and he had courage 
outside of it. For a number of reasons he is the greatest boxer of all time, 
arguably one of the greatest athletes of all time, and certainly one of the 
greatest individuals that there’s ever been.

As a person he was just lovely. You knew that he was gorgeous man, a really 
lovely man from the inside out. I loved him as a human being, loved him as a 
sportsman.

Readers’ tributes

Nasim Chowdhury: “Muhammad Ali was exactly my father’s age so I missed his 
legendary sporting achievements, but I relived them through VHS video cassettes 
and copious reading. I also got to meet my hero in person at a shopping centre 
in London in the autumn of 1993 where he signed my copy of Thomas Hauser’s
Muhammad Ali, His Life and Times. I found him to be just as handsome and noble 
in real life as he was on TV; perhaps even more so.


“The greatest thing about him for me though was not his sporting achievements 
as such, but how he used all the skills and talents he had - oral, physical, 
looks - to propagate his faith, and how beautifully he showed it as one of 
justice, dignity and equality.

“Being a young, black, American Muslim who was one of the greatest sportsmen 
(if not the greatest) of all time was a very potent combination, especially at 
a time when injustice and turmoil was at its height. It took a very brave soul 
to stand up to this and put a glittering career and reputation at stake, and 
yet he did it unflinchingly.


“Quite simply, he was the very best example of Islam in practice for millions 
of young Muslims all over the world. A true citizen of the world and a 
universal example. May he rest in peace.”

Ajay Patta: “That thing about John Lennon saying they were more famous than 
Jesus? Well, growing up in India in the 70s, we knew of Ali. Didn’t know 
anything about the Beatles. Make of that what you will. But I bet that can be 
safely applied to many of us from the subcontinent. I followed his career on 
the sports pages. Probably my first sporting hero.”

One of basketball’s greatest, LeBron James, on Muhammad Ali: 

“The reason why he’s the GOAT [greatest of all time] is not because of what he 
did in the ring, which was unbelievable. It’s what he did outside of the ring, 
what he believed in, what he stood for, along with Jim Brown and Oscar 
Robertson, Lew Alcindor – obviously who became Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] – Bill 
Russell, Jackie Robinson. Those guys stood for something. He’s part of the 
reason why African-Americans today can do what we do in the sports world. We’re 
free. They allow us to have access to anything we want. It’s because of what 
they stood for, andMuhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>
 was definitely the pioneer for that.

“People forget what you did as a professional. People forget the championships 
and all the other things you were able to accomplish. But they will never 
forget how you made them feel. That’s a Maya Angelou quote, but I’ll transcend 
that into what Muhammad Ali was able to do.”

Yorkshireman Richard Dunn, who lost to Ali in Hamburg when challenging for his 
WBA and WBC titles in May 1976, told Sky Sports News:

“I think his legacy will last forever. When we’ve long gone they’ll still be 
talking about him and it’ll be worthwhile as well. He was such a fantastic 
champion. (If young boxers) watch his fights and see what a great athlete he 
was and they want to be the same then it’s there for them. He’s a good example. 
He was a hell of a fighter.”

Other sporting icons have paid tribute. Pele said: “The sporting universe has 
just suffered a big loss.Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> was my friend, my idol, my 
hero. We spent many moments together and always kept a good connection 
throughout the years. The sadness is overwhelming. I wish him peace with God. 
And I send love and strength to his family.”

And Tiger Woods posted on Twitter: “You’ll always be The Greatest for more 
than just what you did in the ring. A champion to so many people in so many 
ways.”

From one showman to another, Yorkshire’s former featherweight world champion 
Prince Naseem has paid this tribute to Ali:

I studied Ali growing up, for all of us in the gym there was only one focus: 
Ali was the only person to copy.

My thoughts and my prayers go out to his family. Muhammad Ali will never be 
forgotten. He was everything. He was bigger than the sport. He deserves to be 
put on a platform which couldn’t be built by human hands. There will never, 
ever be anotherMuhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>.

I love the guy, I’ve got more pictures with Ali that with my own father. There 
was one video I always use to watch calleda.k.a. Cassius Clay, I watched him 
religiously every day for 15 years. That’s what made me want to be a showman, 
be a champion the way that I was, speak the way that I did. It all goes back to 
Muhammad Ali.

“Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it”

President Obama and the first lady Michelle Obama have released a statement on 
the death of Muhammad Ali:


Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> was The 
Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he’d tell you. He’d tell you he was 
the double greatest; that he’d “handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail.”

... In my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves 
on display, just under that iconic photograph of him – the young champ, just 22 
years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston. I was too young when 
it was taken to understand who he was – still Cassius Clay, already an Olympic 
Gold Medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual journey that would lead him to 
his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his power, and set the stage for his 
return to greatness with a name as familiar to the downtrodden in the slums of 
Southeast Asia and the villages of Africa as it was to cheering crowds in 
Madison Square Garden.

“I am America,” he once declared. “I am the part you won’t recognize. But get 
used to me – black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not 
yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.”

That’s the Ali I came to know as I came of age – not just as skilled a poet on 
the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was 
right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when 
it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn’t. His fight outside the ring would 
cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the 
left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali 
stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we 
recognize today.

He wasn’t perfect, of course. For all his magic in the ring, he could be 
careless with his words, and full of contradictions as his faith evolved. But 
his wonderful, infectious, even innocent spirit ultimately won him more fans 
than foes – maybe because in him, we hoped to see something of ourselves. 
Later, as his physical powers ebbed, he became an even more powerful force for 
peace and reconciliation around the world. We saw a man who said he was so mean 
he’d make medicine sick reveal a soft spot, visiting children with illness and 
disability around the world, telling them they, too, could become the greatest. 
We watched a hero light a torch, and fight his greatest fight of all on the 
world stage once again; a battle against the disease that ravaged his body, but 
couldn’t take the spark from his eyes.

Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We are all 
better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and 
we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace.

We’re going to close our rolling coverage of reaction to the death of Mohammad 
Ali, aged 74, late Friday.

 * The legendary boxer died of septic shock after several days in the hospital 
with a severe respiratory illness, his family said through a spokesperson. He 
did not suffer, they said. Ali’s daughter Hana said that her father’s heart 
kept beating 30 minutes after his other organs failed, “Our hearts are 
literally hurting,” she wrote. “But we are so happy daddy is free now.”

 * Ali’s funeral will be held Friday in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, 
the family said, and be preceded by a public procession. Former president Bill 
Clinton, Billy Crystan and Bryant Gumbel will deliver eulogies. 
 * Barack Obama led tributes to Ali from around the world, saying that Ali’s 
battle against Parkinson’s “ravaged his body but couldn’t take the spark from 
his eyes. Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We 
are all better for it.” 
 * Former opponents also memorialized the late boxer. George Foreman said he 
found Ali “one of the greatest human beings I’ve ever met in my life. I got 
beat up in the jungle. We never had any arguments until we met in the ring that 
night. I hit him with everything and I had, and all he would say is, ‘That all 
you got, George?’ What a night. Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and myself were one 
guy – we lived through each other. A big piece of me died when he passed away, 
and I call it the greatest piece.”

Yet another historical episode largely forgotten in the sheer scope of Ali’s 
life: his 1990 trip to Iraq, after the invasion of Kuwait, in which he 
negotiated the release of 15 American hostages held by Saddam Hussein.

ESPN produced a short documentary in its 30-for-30 series on the remarkable 
episode, during which Ali visited schools, prayed at a Baghdad mosque and met 
Hussein. “We hope and pray there is not a war,” he told Iraqi officials. “And 
with the little authority from the fame that I have I’ll show the real side of 
Iraq.”

The White House of George HW Bush disapproved of the meeting but Ali managed 
to bring the Americans back to the US. “God works through people,” Ali told a 
former hostage. “It’s not me.”

A little more than a month later the US invaded in Operation Desert Storm, in 
what became the first Iraq war.
 
And a historical note on the cemetery where Ali will be buried this week in 
his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.

Cave Hill Cemetery is so named because of the cave from which a spring flowed 
that helped feed into a creek in the larger Louisville area, during the city’s 
early years in the mid-19th century. The cemetery is the burial site of 
Revolutionary war hero George Rogers Clark, the man who designed the original 
Confederate flag (Nicola Marshall), and two 20th century sculptors: Enid 
Yandell and Jeptha Barnard Barney Bright IV.

Also interred in Cave Hill is Joshua Fry Speed, Abraham Lincoln’s close friend 
and law partner. The friends disagreed about slavery: Speed believed it was an 
issue for states to decide. But he remained Lincoln’s friend through the 
presidency, and held a memorial in Louisville after his assassination.

Ali getting buried at Cave Hill is amazing. He'll be next to Louisville's 
founders, Union & Confederate soldiers, and Lincoln's law partner.

Barack Obama has called Lonnie Williams, Ali’s wife, “to offer his family’s 
deepest condolences for the passing of her husband”, the White House has said 
in a statement.
Per Deputy Press Secretary Jennifer Friedman:

The President expressed to Lonnie how fortunate he and the First Lady felt to 
have met Muhammad, and noted that the outpouring of love since his death is a 
true testament to his remarkable life. He recounted how special it was to have 
witnessed “The Champ” change the arc of history.

Another rarely seen side of Ali: the astute film critic. He sat down with late 
critic Roger Ebert to watch Rocky II in 1979.

“A great movie,” he said. “A big hit. It has all the ingredients. Love, 
violence, emotion. The excitement never dulled.”

What do you think about the way the fight turned out?

“For the black man to come out superior,” Ali said, “would be against 
America’s teachings. I have been so great in boxing they had to create an image 
like Rocky, a white image on the screen, to counteract my image in the ring. 
America has to have its white images, no matter where it gets them. Jesus, 
Wonder Woman, Tarzan and Rocky.”

You can read the whole interview/review here 
<http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/watching-rocky-ii-with-muhammad-ali>, and 
see what Ali was talking about in the clip below.
 
In an episode largely forgotten among the many other outsize moments of his 
life and career,Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> 
once coaxed a suicidal man down from a ninth-story ledge in Los Angeles.

The man had climbed out from a window and was shouting “I’m no good, I’m going 
to jump.”

“Police, a psychologist and a minister had all but given up,” the CBS anchor 
said that day in January 1981, “When Mohammad Ali, who happened to be nearby, 
volunteered to talk to him.”

The report said that Ali, from a nearby window, told the man: “I’m your 
brother, I want to help you.”
 
The Ali family spokesman Bob Gunnell has been speaking in Scottsdale, Arizona, 
discussing arrangements for the great boxer’s funeral.

All of Ali’s family members had a day to say their final goodbyes, Gunnell 
said, adding that it was “a beautiful thing to watch which displayed all that 
was good about Muhammad Ali”.

“The Champ would have been very proud of his family,” he added.

Ali was hospitalized on Monday night, Gunnell said, in fair condition. That 
was expected to continue as it had before, leading to improvement, only for it 
to become clear “in the last 24 hours” that he would not improve. Ali’s 
official time of death, Gunnell said, was 9.10pm MST on Friday, and the cause 
of death was septic shock due to unspecified natural causes. He did not suffer.

Before discussing Ali’s death, Gunnell detailed plans for Ali’s funeral, which 
was planned with Ali’s involvement and will be an interfaith service lead by a 
Muslim imam.

“Muhammad Ali was truly the people’s champion,” Gunnell said, adding that the 
celebration will therefore be open to everyone. “Lonnie [Ali’s wife] and the 
entire family invite everyone to join them for the celebration in Muhammad 
Ali’s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.”

Ali’s body will return to Kentucky from Arizona in 24- to 48-hours time, 
Gunnell said, with family members accompanying him. The celebration of his life 
will begin on Thursday with a private family ceremony. The next morning, 
Friday, the family will gather at the funeral home, where they will be joined 
by the imam presiding.

There will then be a procession through streets of Louisville, he continued, 
“to allow anyone who is there from the world to celebrate with him”. Ali’s body 
will pass by the Muhammad Ali Center and the procession will then travel down 
the street named after him,Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> Boulevard. It will follow the 
route of the parade that greeted Ali, then Cassius Clay, home from the Rome 
Olympics in 1960, and end at Cave Hill cemetery for a private interment 
ceremony.

At 2pm a memorial service will begin. It will be interfaith, directed by an 
imam but including clerics from a number of religions. The “funeral plans were 
done years ago by Mr Ali, who discussed them personally”, Gunnell said.

Former senator Orrin Hatch will represent the Mormon faith, Gunnell said, and 
President Bill Clinton, Bryant Gumbel and Billy Crystal will give eulogies. A 
private reception will follow at the Muhammed Ali Center.
 
“Are you shocked?”


“No. You scared me when you came over.”

“I heard you wanted to arm wrestle. Let’s get going.”

Basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has written a Facebook tribute to his 
“friend and mentor” Muhammad Ali: “I may be 7’2’’ but I never felt taller than 
when standing in his shadow.”

During my more than 50 years in the public eye, I have met hundreds of 
renowned celebrities, artists, athletes, and world leaders. But only a handful 
embodied the self-sacrificing and heroic qualities that defined my friend and 
mentor,Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>.

A master of self-promotion, he declared early in his boxing career, I am the 
greatest! This kind of boasting enraged many people, just as he’d hoped, 
ensuring a large audience that just wanted to see this upstart boy taught a 
lesson. But it was Muhammad who taught the lesson because, as he once said, 
It’s not bragging if you can back it up. And back it up, he did. Again and 
again. And not just in the ring.

Part of Muhammad’s greatness was his ability to be different things to 
different people. To sports fans he was an unparalleled champion of the world, 
faster and smarter than any heavyweight before. To athletes, he was a model of 
physical perfection and shrewd business acumen.

To the anti-establishment youth of the 1960s, he was a defiant voice against 
the Vietnam War and the draft. To the Muslim community, he was a pious pioneer 
testing America’s purported religious tolerance.

To the African-American community, he was a black man who faced overwhelming 
bigotry the way he faced every opponent in the ring: fearlessly.

At a time when blacks who spoke up about injustice were labeled uppity and 
often arrested under one pretext or another, Muhammad willingly sacrificed the 
best years of his career to stand tall and fight for what he believed was 
right. In doing so, he made all Americans, black and white, stand taller. I may 
be 7’2” but I never felt taller than when standing in his shadow.

Today we bow our heads at the loss of a man who did so much for America. 
Tomorrow we will raise our heads again remembering that his bravery, his 
outspokenness, and his sacrifice for the sake of his community and country 
lives on in the best part of each of us.

Hana Ali, daughter of the legendary boxer, has posted a brief statement 
<https://twitter.com/Hanayali/status/739138206524805122> online. 

“Our hearts are literally hurting,” she writes. “But we are so happy daddy is 
free now.”

We all tried to stay strong and whispered in his ear, “You can go now. We will 
be okay. We love you. Thank you. You can go back to God now.”

All of us were around him hugging and kissing him and holding his hands, 
chanting the Islamic prayer. All of his organs failed but his HEART wouldn’t 
stop bearing. For 30 minutes … his heart just keep beating. No one had ever 
seen anything like it. A true testament to the strength of his Spirit and Will!

Thank you all for your love and support!

The family is due to deliver a statement at 3pm ET today.

Former president George W Bush has also released a statement honoring Ali. It 
reads:

Laura and I are saddened by the death of Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>, The Greatest of All Time. I 
gave Ali the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 and wondered aloud how he 
stayed so pretty throughout so many fights.

“It probably had to do with his beautiful soul. He was a fierce fighter adn 
he’s a man of peace, just like Odessa and Cassius Clay Sr believed their son 
could be.”

Muhammad Ali was an iconic and historic figure who thrilled entertained, 
influenced and inspired millions. Americans will always be proud to have been 
in his corner and called him one of our own.

Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Muhammad Ali’s family and 
friends.

Cassius Clay is a boxer who can throw the jive better than anybody you will 
probably ever meet anywhere. And right there is why I will meet Sonny Liston 
for the heavyweight championship of the world next week in Miami Beach. And 
jive is the reason also why they took my picture looking at $1 million in cold 
cash. That’s how much money my fists and my mouth will have earned by the time 
my fight with Liston is over. Think about that. A southern colored boy has made 
$1 million just as he turns 22. I don’t think it’s bragging to say I’m 
something a little special.”

Thousands of people have been remembering the boxer at the O2 arena in east 
London, where an exhibition about Ali’s life and career is being staged. Ali 
was unable to attend the late February launch of the I Am the Greatest 
exhibition, which features his most famous TV interviews along with items such 
as the “fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee” robe and the split gloves he 
used to defeat British champ Henry Cooper at 1963 Wembley stadium in 1963.

Cooper felled the then Cassius Clay in the fourth round with his trademark 
left hook and appeared on the verge of victory, but Ali’s trainer, Angelo 
Dundee, argued that one of Ali’s gloves was torn and required replacement. The 
referee refused, but their argument bought Ali several extra seconds to 
recover. He then won a technical knockout of Cooper by opening a gash in the 
lighter, slower fighter’s forehead.


Cooper lost to Ali again in London in 1966 and died in 2011. Ali later 
recalled how Cooper’s left hook that felled him was so hard, “my ancestors in 
Africa felt it”.

David Haye, the former two-weight British world champion, said he would not 
have taken up boxing if it wasn’t forMuhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> - and even named his eldest 
son, Cassius Haye, after him.

“I wanted to have what Muhammad Ali had, he was the pinnacle of what a boxer 
could be. I came from humble beginnings as he did, and he showed that hard 
work, focus, dedicating your life to something, anything’s achievable,” he told 
the BBC.

Haye said that when faced Nikolai Valuev in 2009 in a world championship 
fight, he adopted Ali’s tactics of moving quickly and avoiding punches to 
defeat his 7ft opponent and win the title Ali once heldHJ, an achievement he 
called a “lifelong ambition”.

Haye said he admired Ali for “putting his life on the line” for his political 
beliefs - particularly his stance on the Vietnam war - and for “changing 
boxing” with his ringside showmanship.

More tributes for the boxer have been coming in. 

A spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said:

Mr Ali was far more than a legendary boxer; he was a world champion for 
equality and peace. With an incomparable combination of principle, charm, wit 
and grace, he fought for a better world and used his platform to help lift up 
humanity.”

Rev Jesse Jackson, a longtime friend, said: 

He sacrificed the heart of his career and money and glory for his religious 
beliefs about a war he thought unnecessary and unjust. His memory and legacy 
lingers on until eternity. He scarified, the nation benefited. He was a 
champion in the ring, but, more than that, a hero beyond the ring. When 
champions win, people carry them off the field on their shoulders. When heroes 
win, people ride on their shoulders. We rode on Muhammad Ali’s shoulders.”
 
There is a fascinating piece from the Hollywood bible, Variety 
<http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/muhammad-ali-dead-74-media-star-variety-1201788843/>
, about the publication’s coverage of Muhammad Ali. His first mention came in 
the 1 December, 1961 edition, but Ali did not make it to page one until 30 
January, 1963. That edition featured a dispatch from Pittsburgh on “the 
colorful young heavyweight” and his knockout of Charlie Powell.

Variety declared: “Never in the history of the city has a public figure 
dominated the news media as Brassius Cassius.” Ali made the rounds of local TV 
and public events and caused a stir simply by walking down the street. The 
story features generous examples of Ali’s verse including this gem: “If I say a 
mosquito can pull a plow/Just hitch him up and don’t ask how.”

But the highlight without a doubt is: 

Variety even gave a good review to Ali’s one and only comedy album, I Am the 
Greatest, released by Columbia Records in 1963, months before he claimed his 
first heavyweight championship title.

Flags in Louisville, Kentucky, Muhammad Ali’s hometown, have been lowered to 
half mast following a short ceremony led by the city’s mayor, during which he 
warmly remembered the former heavyweight champion’s childhood in the city.


“Muhammad Ali belongs to the world but he only has one hometown,” said Mayor 
Greg Fischer, as a small crowd applauded. “The Louisville Lip spoke to 
everyone, but we heard him in a way that no-one else could, as our brother, our 
uncle and our inspiration.”

The Mayor’s office said flags will remain at half mast until Ali is laid to 
rest in the city, which is home to theMuhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> Center, a museum and cultural 
facility dedicated to his legacy and where he made his last formal appearance 
in October 2015.

Fischer paid tribute to the local institutions that helped forge Ali’s early 
identity, reminding the crowd Ali had graduated from Louisville central high 
school in 1960 and was born in the local hospital on 17 January 1942.


“Imagine that day, that little boy, eyes wide open looking around the room at 
the old Louisville general hospital, not knowing the life that awaited him. The 
life he would make. The world he would shake up, and the people he would 
inspire.”


Fischer also recalled an anecdote from Ali’s early adolescence when his red 
bicycle was stolen in front of a downtown gym. “[He] told police officer Joe 
Martin that he wanted to ‘whoop’ whoever took it. And Martin said: ‘you better 
learn to box first’”.

As three Louisville metro police officers lowered the stars and stripes 
outside the Mayor’s office, a young boy in the crowd could be seen saluting.

 Sello Hatang, head of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, has issued a statement  
<https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/statement-from-the-nelson-mandela-foundation-on-the-death-of-muhammad-ali>
following Muhammad Ali’s death:

Nelson Mandela, a boxing enthusiast most of his life, acknowledged Ali as his 
boxing hero. Madiba had great respect for his legacy and spoke with admiration 
of Ali’s achievements.”

A photograph of Ali and Mandela together sat next to the former president’s 
desk at his foundation, Hatang said, and Mandela’s favourite book at the office 
in his later years was an autographed copy of the Ali biography Greatest of All 
Time.

The statement included a comment Mandela made at an event in Washington DC in 
1990: “There is one regret I have had throughout my life: that I never became 
the boxing heavyweight champion of the world.”
 
US president Barack Obama has paid tribute to Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/barack-obama-pays-tribute-to-muhammad-ali>
 in a heartfelt statement:

Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we’re 
also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a 
while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time.

In my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves on 
display, just under that iconic photograph of him - the young champ, just 22 
years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston.

I was too young when it was taken to understand who he was - still Cassius 
Clay, already an Olympic gold medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual 
journey that would lead him to his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his 
power, and set the stage for his return to greatness with a name as familiar to 
the downtrodden in the slums of South East Asia and the villages of Africa as 
it was to cheering crowds in Madison Square Garden.”

James Lawton has written this lovely piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/commentisfree/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-physical-decline-extraordinary-spirit>
 on Ali’s enduring spirit in the face of physical decline:

We are mourning not just the passing of the greatest fighter in history but a 
presence in our lives which, however haltingly, never ceased to speak of the 
possibilities of the human spirit.

Anyone who happened to be around him in the climactic phase of his career had 
to be aware of the dangers that he was courting. But almost to the end, on a 
chilly night in the Nevada desert in 1980 when he was pounded to a cruel defeat 
by his former sparring partner Larry Holmes, there was a belief, however 
irrational, that somehow he would find a way to beat the attrition of the 
years. He was, after all, a miracle of his species.

Ali's physical decline could not mask his extraordinary spirit

 * The world is mourning the death of boxing legend, Muhammad Ali, who has 
died aged 74 after being admitted to a hospital in Pheonix on Thursday. Ali had 
suffered from Parkinson’s syndrome since 1984. His condition was complicated by 
a respiratory illness. An announcement over funeral arrangements will be made 
late on Saturday. Ali will be buried in Louisville, according to local media. 
 * President Obama released a statement with his wife Michelle Obama, saying: 
“Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it.” Bill Clinton 
described Ali’s talent as “a blend of beauty and grace, speed and strength that 
may never be matched again.” 
 * The world of boxing has paid tribute. His great rival George Foreman put it 
beautifully: “You know what, I found Muhammad Ali to be one of the greatest 
human beings I’ve ever met in my life. I got beat up in the jungle. We never 
had any arguments until we met in the ring that night. I hit him with 
everything and I had, and all he would say is, ‘That all you got, George?’ What 
a night. Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and myself were one guy – we lived through 
each other. A big piece of me died when he passed away, and I call it the 
greatest piece.” 
 * Frank Bruno said Ali was an “inspiration, mentor, my friend, an Earthly god 
of humanity, simply the greatest”. YorkshiremanRichard Dunn, who lost to Ali in 
1976, said: “When we’ve long gone they’ll still be talking about him and it’ll 
be worthwhile as well.” 
 * Carl Froch paid tribute, saying “generations later people are still 
watching his fights and are still mesmerised by the way he worked,” andPrince 
Naseemadded: “He deserves to be put on a platform which couldn’t be built by 
human hands.”Amir Khan said: “No fighter or sportsman will ever reach the level 
of Ali, whose name will continue to echo through the ages.” 
 * Other sporting icons have paid tribute, including his friend Pele: “The 
sporting universe has just suffered a big loss.Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> was my friend, my idol, my 
hero. The sadness is overwhelming.” Tiger Woods posted on Twitter: “You’ll 
always be The Greatest for more than just what you did in the ring.”Sachin 
Tendulkar said: “My hero since childhood. I always had a wish to meet you some 
day but now it will never happen. RIP The Greatest.”

 * Interviewer Michael Parkinson said: “He was the most extraordinary man I’ve 
ever met, and I’ve met a few. His charisma was palpable.”  Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls)

The former world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan: 

He was 6ft 3in and 18 stone and he was walking round the ring like he was 
floating on air. He brought style and artistry to the game.

What he did was magnificent. He offered himself up for the African-American 
people to make a difference. He had courage in the ring and he had courage 
outside of it. For a number of reasons he is the greatest boxer of all time, 
arguably one of the greatest athletes of all time, and certainly one of the 
greatest individuals that there’s ever been.

As a person he was just lovely. You knew that he was gorgeous man, a really 
lovely man from the inside out. I loved him as a human being, loved him as a 
sportsman.

Readers’ tributes

Nasim Chowdhury: “Muhammad Ali was exactly my father’s age so I missed his 
legendary sporting achievements, but I relived them through VHS video cassettes 
and copious reading. I also got to meet my hero in person at a shopping centre 
in London in the autumn of 1993 where he signed my copy of Thomas Hauser’s
Muhammad Ali, His Life and Times. I found him to be just as handsome and noble 
in real life as he was on TV; perhaps even more so.


“The greatest thing about him for me though was not his sporting achievements 
as such, but how he used all the skills and talents he had - oral, physical, 
looks - to propagate his faith, and how beautifully he showed it as one of 
justice, dignity and equality.

“Being a young, black, American Muslim who was one of the greatest sportsmen 
(if not the greatest) of all time was a very potent combination, especially at 
a time when injustice and turmoil was at its height. It took a very brave soul 
to stand up to this and put a glittering career and reputation at stake, and 
yet he did it unflinchingly.


“Quite simply, he was the very best example of Islam in practice for millions 
of young Muslims all over the world. A true citizen of the world and a 
universal example. May he rest in peace.”

Ajay Patta: “That thing about John Lennon saying they were more famous than 
Jesus? Well, growing up in India in the 70s, we knew of Ali. Didn’t know 
anything about the Beatles. Make of that what you will. But I bet that can be 
safely applied to many of us from the subcontinent. I followed his career on 
the sports pages. Probably my first sporting hero.”
 
There are many tributes to Ali from the world of football, another 
illustration if it was needed of just how his influence spread above and beyond 
boxing. Here are a few from thePremier League:

One of basketball’s greatest, LeBron James, on Muhammad Ali: 

“The reason why he’s the GOAT [greatest of all time] is not because of what he 
did in the ring, which was unbelievable. It’s what he did outside of the ring, 
what he believed in, what he stood for, along with Jim Brown and Oscar 
Robertson, Lew Alcindor – obviously who became Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] – Bill 
Russell, Jackie Robinson. Those guys stood for something. He’s part of the 
reason why African-Americans today can do what we do in the sports world. We’re 
free. They allow us to have access to anything we want. It’s because of what 
they stood for, andMuhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>
 was definitely the pioneer for that.

“People forget what you did as a professional. People forget the championships 
and all the other things you were able to accomplish. But they will never 
forget how you made them feel. That’s a Maya Angelou quote, but I’ll transcend 
that into what Muhammad Ali was able to do.”

Yorkshireman Richard Dunn, who lost to Ali in Hamburg when challenging for his 
WBA and WBC titles in May 1976, told Sky Sports News:

“I think his legacy will last forever. When we’ve long gone they’ll still be 
talking about him and it’ll be worthwhile as well. He was such a fantastic 
champion. (If young boxers) watch his fights and see what a great athlete he 
was and they want to be the same then it’s there for them. He’s a good example. 
He was a hell of a fighter.”

Other sporting icons have paid tribute. Pele said: “The sporting universe has 
just suffered a big loss.Muhammad Ali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> was my friend, my idol, my 
hero. We spent many moments together and always kept a good connection 
throughout the years. The sadness is overwhelming. I wish him peace with God. 
And I send love and strength to his family.”

And Tiger Woods posted on Twitter: “You’ll always be The Greatest for more 
than just what you did in the ring. A champion to so many people in so many 
ways.”

From one showman to another, Yorkshire’s former featherweight world champion 
Prince Naseem has paid this tribute to Ali:

I studied Ali growing up, for all of us in the gym there was only one focus: 
Ali was the only person to copy.

My thoughts and my prayers go out to his family. Muhammad Ali will never be 
forgotten. He was everything. He was bigger than the sport. He deserves to be 
put on a platform which couldn’t be built by human hands. There will never, 
ever be anotherMuhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>.

I love the guy, I’ve got more pictures with Ali that with my own father. There 
was one video I always use to watch calleda.k.a. Cassius Clay, I watched him 
religiously every day for 15 years. That’s what made me want to be a showman, 
be a champion the way that I was, speak the way that I did. It all goes back to 
Muhammad Ali.

President Obama and the first lady Michelle Obama have released a statement on 
the death of Muhammad Ali:


Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> was The 
Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he’d tell you. He’d tell you he was 
the double greatest; that he’d “handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail.”

... In my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves 
on display, just under that iconic photograph of him – the young champ, just 22 
years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston. I was too young when 
it was taken to understand who he was – still Cassius Clay, already an Olympic 
Gold Medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual journey that would lead him to 
his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his power, and set the stage for his 
return to greatness with a name as familiar to the downtrodden in the slums of 
Southeast Asia and the villages of Africa as it was to cheering crowds in 
Madison Square Garden.

“I am America,” he once declared. “I am the part you won’t recognize. But get 
used to me – black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not 
yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.”

That’s the Ali I came to know as I came of age – not just as skilled a poet on 
the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was 
right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when 
it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn’t. His fight outside the ring would 
cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the 
left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali 
stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we 
recognize today.

He wasn’t perfect, of course. For all his magic in the ring, he could be 
careless with his words, and full of contradictions as his faith evolved. But 
his wonderful, infectious, even innocent spirit ultimately won him more fans 
than foes – maybe because in him, we hoped to see something of ourselves. 
Later, as his physical powers ebbed, he became an even more powerful force for 
peace and reconciliation around the world. We saw a man who said he was so mean 
he’d make medicine sick reveal a soft spot, visiting children with illness and 
disability around the world, telling them they, too, could become the greatest. 
We watched a hero light a torch, and fight his greatest fight of all on the 
world stage once again; a battle against the disease that ravaged his body, but 
couldn’t take the spark from his eyes.

Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We are all 
better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and 
we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace.
