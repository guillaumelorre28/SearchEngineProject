Tidal originally negotiated exclusive streaming rights to Prince’s music in 
2015, but now his estate claims that the company “is exploiting many 
copyrighted Prince works” and may have breached exclusivity agreements and 
copyright in a suit filed inMinnesota 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota>.


Roc Nation countered <https://www.scribd.com/document/331086218/Prince-Tidal> 
by claiming to have “the right to exclusively stream [Prince’s] entire 
catalogue of music, with certain limited exceptions”, and cited written and 
oral licenses to stream Prince’s music.

The handling of Prince’s musical rights has intrigued many. After his death in 
April 2016, it was confirmed that the star’s legendary “vault” of music existed 
and contained unreleased tracks, which could constitute as much as 70% of his 
recorded music.

Last month Warner Bros confirmed they would released a deluxe version of 
Purple Rain, and it was estimated that Prince’s unreleased music could be worth 
$100m.

Paul Mason described Prince as the inventor of “post-death capitalism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/24/gett-off-why-princes-archive-is-an-act-of-defiance-against-pop-industry-capitalism>
”, adding: “He created scarcity, interest and quality in the unpublished work – 
but showed no interest in how it would be exploited.”

Prince’s estate and record label are seeking unspecified damages and also want 
an injunction to stop Tidal from streaming Prince’s back catalogue.
