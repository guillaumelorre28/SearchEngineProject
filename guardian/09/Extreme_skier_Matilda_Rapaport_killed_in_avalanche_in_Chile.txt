Bull said on Monday.


 Rapaport, who was 30 years old, was skiing in a film shoot outside the resort 
town of Farellones on Thursday after a major snowstorm when the avalanche 
occurred. She died later in hospital after suffering oxygen deprivation and 
brain damage.

 “Matilda was an extraordinary athlete, traveling the world to find her 
passion, ride steep terrain and share her bright smile,” Red Bull said in a 
statement.

 Rapaport was an established part of the freeride skiing circuit, in which 
athletes rapidly descend steep, rocky mountain faces, and she had appeared in 
many ski films and magazines.

 Her death occurred nearly two years after the Chilean avalanche deaths

of famed extreme skiers Jean-Philippe Auclair, a Canadian, and Carl Andreas 
Fransson, a Swede.

 It also comes during a time of reflection within the extreme skiing community 
regarding the dangers of the sport. In December, skiing magazine Powder 
published a feature article asking if professional skiers were taking too many 
risks. Rapaport appeared on the cover.
