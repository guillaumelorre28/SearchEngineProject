Klammer express ... a fine line between disaster and success

It is one of the defining moments in the history of the Winter Olympics, one 
of the most exhilarating 100 seconds of sporting bravery: Innsbruck 1976 and 
22-year-old Franz Klammer's on-the-edge, disaster-defying run to win the gold 
medal in his home country. Klammer didn't so much hammer the icy and bumpy 
3,145m Patscherkofel course as fly over it - arms flailing, skis askew - 
looking at any moment as though he would crash through the barriers and into 
the screaming crowds of his countrymen lining the slopes. But he always managed 
to regain his balance just in the nick of time and he snatched victory from 
under the nose of the Swiss leader Bernhard Russi by 0.33 seconds. Here's what 
he has to say on "that race".

 Klammer dominated downhill skiing in the 1970s, winning four consecutive 
overall World Cup victories (and adding a further one in 1983) and 25 
individual World Cup races. Today, he works with ski manufacturer Head, as an 
ambassador for the Carinthia tourist board in Austria, and as a motivational 
speaker. Who better to ask for tips on how to improve your skiing? Let's do the 
Klammer:

What makes a good skier?

Thirty-three years after his do-or-die run, The Klammer Express, as he came to 
be known, claims that controlling your speed is the key to good skiing.

What's the best way to prepare for the slopes?

 Go for a bike ride - we're assuming that he doesn't mean a gentle pedal - all 
summer long preferably.

First days on the slopes

Start slowly - don't do a jump start, advises Franz.

Choose the right skis

Guess what? Racing skis are hard to control - even Franz doesn't use them 
these days, preferring gentler carving on more traditional skis.

How to ski difficult runs

You're a once-a-season skier and your friends are egging you on at the top of 
vertiginous, icy black run. What do you do? Follow these zen-like tips, and 
you'll be fine.

Just have fun

Even legends slow down - so ski within yourself and the take time to enjoy it.
