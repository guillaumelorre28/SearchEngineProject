From Paisley Park to First Avenue, Minneapolis was a city deep in mourning on 
Thursday for its hometown heroPrince <https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince>
, as the surprise news of the music icon’s death inside his Paisley Park home 
slowly set in.


Outside First Avenue, a historic downtown Minneapolis club where much of the 
film Purple Rain was famously filmed, thousands of fans congregated around the 
venue to try to gain entry into an all-night dance party, the ultimate farewell 
to their beloved Prince.

Prince broke all the rules about what black American men should be

Bob Mould, Paul Westerberg and Bob Dylan may have been products of Minnesota 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota>. But Prince was “truly 
Minnesota’s favorite son”, said Francine Verskotzi, dressed in a golden jacket.

“He is our hometown hero on so many levels,” she said, following an evening 
block party outside the club, which secured a special permit to host the dance 
party until the early hours of Friday so fans could celebrate the life of a 
diminutive figure who towered over the music industry for decades.

Verskotzi’s husband, Joey, said that as a musician, Prince was important to 
him because he “never put out the same thing”. He said his answer to the 
age-old question of whose records you’d want to listen to on a desert island 
was simple: Prince.


Prince “put Minneapolis on the map”, Verskotzi said.

“As far as music goes, I mean, music has always been happening here, but he 
legitimized it, if you will, and music continues on because of it,” she said. 
“He’s like our favorite son.”

She added: “This is somebody that we love. His music lives on. It’s a legacy, 
and we’re here for that reason.”

Standing nearby, Cornelius Williams appreciated simply being around others who 
were reeling from the aftershocks of Prince’s death.

“I’ve been listening to Prince since 1978,” he said. “And I love all the 
music, it’s inspirational.” Williams first heard Prince when he was 12, and his 
death has shook him in a way comparable to only a few previous incidents.

“I’ll put it to you like this: I’m 6-foot-4, 280 pounds,” he said. “And it 
hurt me to hear that Prince fucking passed away.”

He added: “It just broke me down. The only time I ever cried is when one of my 
brothers died, and when my grandmother died. And today I cried at least three 
or four times.”

Inside First Avenue, the mood was electric, as the roughly 1,500 fans 
fortunate to make it inside the ultimate Prince farewell party danced the night 
away, appreciating the special permit secured by the club, which allowed it to 
stay open until 6 or 7am on Friday.

Juan Garcia and Elspeth Lucas, roommates who live in nearby Columbia Heights, 
drove into Minneapolis for the outdoor block party. The pair managed to make it 
inside before First Avenue hit capacity.

“Prince is one of the greatest musicians ever,” Garcia said along the second 
floor wall, while the music blared around him. “He’s talented at everything – a 
phenomenal guitarist. He plays everything to his best, and he just makes such a 
difference in people’s lives. And the way he touched me, when I was younger (I 
heard) Purple Rain … it was amazing.”

The diverse room buzzed as DJs played classic Prince songs, spliced with 
tracks by artists the legend wrote songs for. Shortly after midnight Friday, 
partygoers belted Purple Rain together, a notably moving moment amid a sullen 
day. Moments later, the video of Nothing Compares to You, performed by Sinead 
O’Connor – and written by Prince – appeared and again prompted the room to 
croon along. Couples slow-danced and kissed, while others waved cigarette 
lighters about.

Lucas recalled memories as a five-year-old dancing around her living room to 
When Doves Cry.

“I grew up with his music,” she said.

Soon after, the medley of slower-paced tunes ended, and the DJ segued into the 
uptempo Little Red Corvette, while the room returned to dancing into the early 
hours of the morning.

‘It was one of the coolest things of my life’

Prince was found collapsed in an elevator at his house, located outside 
Minneapolis, on Thursday morning andwas pronounced dead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/21/prince-dead-music-superstar-57> 
at around 10am. Throughout the day, local radio stations had highlighted the 
vast capabilities of the venerable 57-year-old throughout his broad catalog, 
featuring diverse cuts of R&B, funk, pop and rock.


A postmortem examination of his body is scheduled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/22/prince-postmortem-after-death-of-singer-paisley-park-minneapolis>
 for Friday, but fans of the beloved superstar took to Minneapolis’s streets as 
soon as news of his death broke.

Gus Sorenson visited Paisley Park twice on Thursday, and brought his mother 
along during the second stop. Paisley was a place he previously frequented to 
watch Prince play intimate shows in front of a small, club-size crowd. He 
watched Prince perform last May in front of about 500 people.

“We got here at 9 o’clock at night and waited until 2am, and he finally came 
out,” Sorenson said. “It was one of the coolest things in my life.” A 
particular line from Prince that night stuck with him, something the superstar 
uttered in the wake of a spate of terrorists attacks: “We should love each 
other.”

He helped bring attention to this city’s music, and more people have been 
affected by this than we could count
Lowell Pickett, owner, Dakota jazz club 
As a sea of news trucks hummed along Audubon road, outside the compound, 
Sorenson added: “I just kind of felt like I needed to come back and pay my 
respects.” He regretted not taking the chance to attend a recent dance party at 
Paisley only last Saturday, where Prince made a brief appearance. Still, he 
feels fortunate, having had the opportunity to witness a small show with 
Prince, unlike what most fans of the legend have ever experienced.

“I’m so glad I did that,” he said. 

Later in the evening, a half-hour drive away, a quiet memorial of sorts 
unfolded at the Dakota jazz club in downtown Minneapolis, a place Prince 
frequented once a month, according to the venue’s owner. He had a private table 
on Dakota’s second floor that would often be cordoned off by a curtain upon his 
party’s arrival.

On Thursday, a small purple flower was placed on his table - #299 - in front 
of a placard that plainly read: “Rest in peace, Prince.” Soft purple lights 
shined across the stage before the club’s main act began their set Thursday 
night.

Prince remembered by fans across America

. 
The typically shy hometown hero of Minneapolis was at Dakota, where he had 
previously played a four-night stand, as recently as Tuesday.

“He was an international musical treasure whose combined talents only come 
along in many years,” Dakota owner Lowell Pickett told the Guardian. “He was a 
masterful songwriter, a virtuosic multi-instrumentalist, a brilliant producer, 
a perfectionist as an engineer, and a talent scout whose vision enveloped 
masters who preceded him as well as young artists.”

Pickett said Prince meant “so much” to Minneapolis - “more than words can ever 
express”. Prince, he said, particularly helped the Dakota in a way “we can 
never repay”: in January 2013, when he sought to do several shows at the club, 
and in becoming a “gracious guest” over the years.

“He stayed here,” he said. “And in doing so, he helped bring attention to this 
city’s music and its musicians, and more people have been affected by this than 
we could count.”
