Skins


It’s not like you don’t turn me on.
Every time you walked past
I thought, She’s fit.
Come-to-bed eyes.
We both want to
feel my skin

against your skin.
It’s not like you’re on
or I’m changing into
a woman. It’s my past.
Look into my eyes.
I just wanted to fit

in. A misfit.
Mixed race but light-skinned,
brown hair, blue eyes,
bootboy with a hard-on.
I passed.
I had to.


Then I got this tattoo.
I did it in a fit
of rage. It soon passed.
You want to read my skin?
Whatever turns you on.
I closed my eyes

and put my soul on ice,
denied a black dad, too
terrified to let on.
I wore the outfit,
marched with the skins.
I don’t like to talk about the past,

I hate my past.
My big lie reflected in their eyes,
their hatred in my skin.
With this tattoo
I’m a walking Photofit.
That’s why I keep my clothes on.

It’s past midnight. I’ll call a cab if you want me to.
But your eyes know how to fit
a condom like a second skin. Come on…


Patience Agbabi’s most recent collection, Telling Tales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/23/funky-chaucer-reboot-patience-agbabi-canterbury-tales>
 was a radical re-voicing of Chaucer and the Canterbury pilgrims, ablaze with 
the “rum ram ruf and rym <https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/3561>
” of modern London. This week’s poem comes from an earlier collection,Bloodshot 
Monochrome <http://www.canongate.tv/bloodshot-monochrome-paperback.html>, a 
miscellany of themes and styles but also featuring lively-witted exchanges with 
literary traditions. In Agbabi’s “Problem Pages” series of sonnets, for 
example, worried famous poets – ranging from Henry Howard to June Jordan – 
write “agony” letters to “Dear Patience”, to which she judiciously replies. 
Agbabi characteristically makes poetry an opportunity for conversation with the 
past, not swamping it but setting new lexical terms.

Skins, from the “Monologues” section of Bloodshot Monochrome, marries the 
free-style of dramatic monologue with fixed form. Giving it an idiom which is 
oral rather than literary, Agbabi enjoyably reconnects the sestina with its 
“performance” origins in troubadour poetry and song.

 Skins is a kind of spoken-word sestina, with a fast, edgy, colloquial 
rhetoric that ripples off the page. The vocabulary is crucial, and the six 
repetands are versatile little shape-shifters: “on”, “past”, “fit”, “eyes,” 
“to” and “skin”. Even the most change-resistant noun – “eyes” – turns up in the 
guise of “ice” in stanza five, with a revealing nod to Eldridge Cleaver’s book
Soul on Ice <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_On_Ice_(book)>. “Skins” in the 
same stanza, and in the title, importantly identifies the speaker and his 
culture: he’s a (reformed?) bootboy, a skinhead.

 The star performers are the prepositions, “to” and “on” – especially the 
latter: “turns me/you on”, “it’s not like you’re on” (perhaps menstruating?), 
“hard-on”, “let on,” etc. Little or large, the shifts of meaning in the 
repetands contribute as much to the poem’s pace as the brisk rhythms, but the 
importance of the syntax in sustaining the idiomatic pitch and tempo shouldn’t 
be overlooked. Those repetands are curled up, like stones or feathers, in the 
stream of rhetoric. All its twists and turns (flattery, explication, 
exclamation, direct address, inner monologue) are enhanced by the 
triple-pattern of word-repetition, line-ending and sentence-flow.

'It’s not like you don’t turn me on,' he protests in answer to an unheard 
accusation, maybe an uneasy self accusation.

 The poem seems to start in the middle of a conversation – one that has 
provoked the speaker from cheap chat-up line to costlier persuasion tactics. 
“It’s not like you don’t turn me on,” he protests in answer to an unheard 
accusation, maybe an uneasy self accusation. The speaker’s seduction plan 
hasn’t got far, and, as the one-sided dialectic flows on, most of the trouble 
will be shown to be with his relationship with himself.

 Skins increasingly becomes one Skin’s confession. He has “denied a black dad 
…” (the most powerful of his admissions) and he has “passed” (that is, an 
end-note tells us, he has been “mistakenly accepted as a white person”) and 
“worn the outfit” and “marched with the skins”. These self-descriptions, 
without being over-specific, denote and acknowledge a racist and perhaps 
violent past.

 The sestina inevitably functions as a form of hide-and-seek. Here, it helps 
the narrator’s psychological complexity to emerge. Glimpses appear, only to 
vanish in his disguises. The “walking Photofit” is a particularly telling 
image. With the help of his genetic inheritance (light skin, blue eyes), he has 
put himself together like a jigsaw of other people’s suspicions and 
stereotypes. His all-important tattoo is left to the imagination, but we learn 
he had it done “in a fit / of rage” and it shames him, although he makes a joke 
of it (“That’s why I keep my clothes on”).

 Self-revelation in a dramatic monologue is usually inadvertent, and part of 
the reader’s uncomfortable fun is that it incriminates the speaker without his 
knowledge. Here the protagonist is in on his own secrets: he’s candid with us 
about what he knows and hates about his past. The sixth stanza could be faking 
the anger, but somehow, I don’t think it is. The diction is too blunt for 
pretence. He has got over the denial, felt others’ hatred, and recognised his 
own. He could be self-deluded, if he’s thinking sex can save him, but who’s to 
say the woman he fancies – “fit” in various senses of the word, and clearly an 
unusually good listener – would not help deliver him into his identity? The 
wonderful phrase, “read my skin,” resonates on many levels. It’s what the 
speaker most desires, though in the last three lines of stanza four, he 
disguises his need by pretending it is the woman’s. His worries over identity 
are compound; related to gender and sexual performance as well as race. See his 
earlier, mock-comic assertion: “I’m not changing into a woman.” After all, it’s 
the “bootboy” who boasts the “hard-on”: his alter ego might not be so sure. But 
his fears, by the end of the poem, seem unfounded.

The man’s tone in the envoi is both sexy and gentle. He’s increasingly 
likeable, especially when he says “I’ll call a cab if you want me to” (as long 
as he means it) and, finally, in the reference to the condom, which he imagines 
will be fitted on lovingly, “like a second skin”. If he’s turning into a woman, 
it’s in a good way, and maybe we readers of all genders and skins should be 
woman enough to trust him.
