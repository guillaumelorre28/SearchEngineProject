This is my favourite book ever! It’s about different types of dragons, how 
they behave, and how to find them!

It’s really interesting and as I am a dragonologist (also known as a 
dracologist), I find this book very handy! I would suggest this book a great 
one to start with, when learning about dragons.

I say ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ out of ten! I adore this book so much that I 
couldn’t stop reading it! I was lucky enough to have it signed, by Cressida 
Cowell, and she is one of my favourite authors (or translators, in this case, 
as it was written in runes by Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third!)
