The handwritten will of a Scottish woman who died in Auschwitz after refusing 
to abandon Jewish girls in her care at a missionary school in Budapest has been 
discovered in church archives.

Jane Haining is the only Scot named as “righteous among the nations” – 
non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews from the Nazis – by Yad Vashem, 
Israel’s Holocaust memorial.

 Detail from Haining’s will 
Her will, which bequeaths “money left after meeting funeral expenses” along 
with her wireless, typewriter, fur coat and watches, was found in a box in the 
archives of the Church of Scotland’s World Mission Council in Edinburgh.


The box also held about 70 photographs of Haining with her young charges, and 
documents revealing efforts to secure her release from the Nazi death camp. The 
material is to be handed over to the National Library ofScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>.


The Rev Ian Alexander, secretary of the World Mission Council, said Haining’s 
story was “one of heroism and personal sacrifice”. The discovery of a will 
“gives a sense she was fully aware of the risks she was taking”, he said.

“Scottish missionaries were advised to return home from Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> during the dark days of the 
second world war, but Jane declined and wrote: ‘If these children need me in 
days of sunshine, how much more do they need me in days of darkness?’” She 
“embodies so much of the internationalist spirit”, he added.

Haining moved to Budapest in the early 1930s to work as a matron in a 
church-run school after a sheltered childhood on a farm and 10 years working as 
a secretary. Many of the 315 pupils at the school were girls from the city’s 
growing Jewish population.


In 1939, when war broke out, Haining was on holiday in Cornwall but 
immediately returned to Budapest and her charges. A year later she was ordered 
by the church to return to Scotland, but refused.

A Hungarian bishop, László Ravasz, later reported that “her superiors three 
times ordered her home, but she always replied that the Hungarian people were 
so true-hearted, honourable and chivalrous that among them not a hair on her 
head would be touched. ‘I shall continue to do my duty,’ she declared, ‘and 
stick to my post.’”

 Pupils at Haining’s missionary school. 
When Nazi troops entered Budapest in March 1944, she again rejected entreaties 
to leave, instead sewing yellow stars on to the clothes of Jewish girls on 
Gestapo orders.


Within weeks, the Gestapo arrested her on suspicion of spying, giving her 15 
minutes to gather her belongings. Haining was charged with eight offences, 
including listening to news broadcasts on the BBC.


By May she was in Auschwitz, working in the labour camps, and by August she 
was dead. Her British citizenship meant the Nazis sent a death certificate to 
the Church of Scotland; it said Haining had died of “cachexia following 
intestinal catarrh”.


More than a million people died in the Auschwitz concentration camps before 
they were liberated by Russian troops in January 1945.

As well as being honoured by Yad Vashem in 1997, after a 10-year 
investigation, Haining was posthumously awarded a Hero of the Holocaust medal 
by the UK government in 2010. Two glass windows bear tribute to her “service 
and sacrifice” at her former church in Queen’s Park, Glasgow. A street in 
Budapest is named after her.

Rev Susan Brown of the World Mission Council said: “The previously unseen 
documents and photographs have, for me, evoked fresh feelings of awe about this 
already tremendously moving, inspiring and important story. To hear of Jane’s 
determination to continue to care for ‘her’ girls, even when she knew it put 
her own life at risk, is truly humbling.”
