The news in clues

Our usual business here is to mention topics and pieces of culture after they 
have appeared in crosswords, but sometimes the puzzle gods decide that it will 
go the other way. Take David Nobbs: we recently described how the creator of 
Reginald Perrinlet crosswords bleed into his writing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/aug/10/crossword-blog-david-nobbs-crosswordings-funniest-commentator>
; the setter Nimrod, knownlocally as Enigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/13/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-enigmatist>
, went in the other direction.

Nimrod 9,009 in the Independent was a tribute to Nobbs, including this 
apposite anagram ...

 24d/13ac/18d Tired Now, I’m Dead at Eighty – alternative title? 
(1,5,3,5,1,2,5)
[ anagram of TIREDNOWIMDEADATEIGHTY ]

... of the boast frequently crowed by Perrin’s boss, I DIDN’T GET WHERE I AM 
TODAY. Also feted by Nimrod, in 9,034, was George Cole,whose contribution to 
the dictionaries we recently noted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/sep/28/crossword-roundup-why-are-there-so-few-slang-words-for-husband>
. Amid the CV-as-puzzle was an entry for ...

8ac Here there’s instant suffering involving tormented Sir (2,8)
[ anagram of INSTANT containing anagram of SIR ]

 ... ST TRINIAN’S, the school visited by Cole’s spiv character Flash Harry. If 
there are any other passing or ongoing concerns from the crossword blog that 
you had hoped might serendipitously appear in puzzle form, please mention them 
below.


Latter patter

Clues rarely make the solver wince. Their surfaces might be fanciful, surreal, 
even poetic. Occasionally, though, the solver’s eye waters before the solving 
kicks in: here’sMonk in the Financial Times 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/fc52fb26-6362-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.pdf>
 ...

28ac Punches male in bits below the belt? (5) 
[ abbrev. for ‘male’ inside synonym for ‘bits below the belt’ ]
[ M inside LAPS ]

And it’s not one of those answers which has a completely different tang to its 
clue: it’s LAMPS, that fierce word which has nothing to do gaslights. Via LAM, 
the sense here seems to go back to the sort of language Vikings would use to 
describe making someone LAME.

When it comes to words for hitting someone, I tend to prefer the onomatopoeic 
smack of a THWACK or even THUMP. Best of all is the term with a tale to tell of 
two brothers, their father the old northern French word for running well, 
“waloper”. One brother cultivated airs and developed graces in the 16th century 
and became the equestrian’s preferred way of referring to, say, a Canterbury 
GALLOP.

The other fell in with a rowdier lot and came to mean a heavy defeat, strong 
ale, the throbbing of blood – or another way of saying lamp, thwack and all the 
rest of it. And this brings us to our next challenge: reader, how would you 
clue WALLOP?

. Of the romantic clues, I enjoyed cmiall’s delightfully soppy “In the 
highlands at the tail of Blencathra you’ll find your love” and schroduck’s 
“Wife’ll always embrace him?” – but also the less appealing domestic scenario 
in steveran’s “Making husband iron flipping everything”.

Away from the “romantic-commitment” surfaces, ketmando suggested goings-on in 
“Outdated measure taken by the Football Association’s sleeping partner?”, and 
harlobarlo was on the topical ball with “Jeremy, say, is part of radical left 
comeback”.

The runners-up are croquemonsieur’s “‘He’s a lumberjack’ is on the radio” and 
Clueso’s snappy “Bo Derek perhaps”, and we return to romance with the winner: 
jonemm’s charming “Swooned over a suitor?”


Kudos to Jon – please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

One of the most pleasing ways the penny may drop for a solver is when it 
becomes apparent that what appeared to be an adjective is in fact a noun, or 
what have you. So it waswith Arachne

 inher Guardian clue <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26691> ...

16d Loose bowels voided, Englishman likely to run ahead (8)
[ first & last letters (‘bowels voided’) of ENGLISHMAN, after synonym for 
‘likely to run’ ]
[ EN after UNFAST ]

... for UNFASTEN, where “loose” turns out to be a potentially malodorous verb. 
Very Arachne – and now wash your hands.
