David Cameron sings tune after statement on Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jul/11/david-cameron-hums-tune-after-statement-on-theresa-may-video>
. 
Do-DOO-do-do. The outgoing prime minister hummed idly for the nation. Nothing 
doing here. No affairs that are current; nothing new to be seen in the news.

And the same goes on the crossword pages. In the absence of anything topical 
to provide a theme, recent puzzles have taken to looking backwards.

In the Financial Times, Gaff (you can read our Meet the Setter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/feb/10/puzzles> Q&A 
here)took us back exactly one year 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/a8d2290c-5026-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc.pdf>
, to a time when Labour leadership frontrunner Andy Burnham waspromising to 
renationalise the railways 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/05/andy-burnham-renationalise-railways-labour-leadership>
, David Cameron was“delighted” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/25/david-cameron-set-to-go-to-referendum-without-eu-ratifying-treaty-changes>
 that EU reform was “properly under way” and Donald Trump had rendered himself 
unelectable byreferring to women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/06/donald-trump-misogyny-republican-debate-megyn-kelly>
 as fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. And there was one of those 
rare moments where we lost a national treasure ...

1ac Clear picture? (5,3,5)
[ adjective meaning ‘clear’ and a noun for a type of photograph ]

... who was BLACK AND WHITE in that she was born Priscilla White but became 
known as Cilla Black, the topic of Gaff’s puzzle.

In the Guardian, Crucible (Meet the Setter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/jun/23/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-crucible>
)looked back further 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26948#1-across>, to a birth 
rather than a death:

1ac/12ac Writer, illustrator, top farceur and snooker player (7,6)
[ verb meaning ‘top’ + farce actor Brian + term for a snooker player ]
[ BEAT + RIX + POTTER ]

One hundred and fifty years young, BEATRIX POTTER. And both the FT and the 
Independent split the anniversary difference. Skitnica’s (Meet the Setter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/dec/01/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-tramp>
) clues includedthis one 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/93d8f4e4-4d43-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc.pdf>
:

27ac Fantastic Hurst ultimately is an icon; he led players (9)
[ anagram (‘fantastic’) of the last letter of HURST and ISANICON ]
[ anagram of TISANICON ]

... for TOSCANINI, and Jambazi (Meet the (same) Setter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/dec/01/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-tramp>
) offered wordplaysuch as this 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160730#!201607>
:

9ac Recognised opportunity at the end – brothers Jack and Bobby both shot (7)
[ Scottish word for ‘recognised’ + last letter of OPPORTUNITY ]
[ KENNED + Y ]

...for KENNEDY, in a pair of puzzles marking 50 years since a certain World 
Cup final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/29/1966-world-cup-england-50th-anniversary>
.

Latter patter

A search in Google’s Ngram Viewer shows a surge through the 1980s 
<https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=lorra&year_start=1982&year_end=1990&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Clorra%3B%2Cc0>
 of use of the term LORRA. Yet Cilla Black – the most visible ambassador for 
LORRA, outside of the Keep Liverpool Tidy anti-litter slogan “Norra Lorra Fun” 
– remains absent from the Oxford English Dictionary (as does LORRA itself, 
despite the presence of LOTTA, LOTTER and even LOTTUH). Let’s do what we can to 
change that, the only way we know how: reader, how would you clue LORRA?

Clueing competition

 Thanks for your clues for UGANDA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/jul/25/crossword-blog-from-estonia-to-uganda>
, and for tolerating my owncovert definition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/jul/25/crossword-blog-from-estonia-to-uganda>
 (“the other”). I enjoyed those which referred to Private Eye, including 
TrickyJoe’s sly “Subject of steamy discussions: you see, we hear” and 
Mojoseeker’s more direct “Gnome sex in Africa”. And ID2155366 managed a 
one-word clue, for those who remember Mike Judge’s 2006 film, in “Idiocracy?”

The runners-up are Alberyalbery’s acrostic “At first Ulysses Grant 
appropriated North Dakota – Apache country” and Phitonelly’s elegant “Huge land 
Idi ran, repressing all sides”, which would probably have taken the laurels 
were it not for Jonemm’s startling “Missing the R and a vowel, Grauniad 
unfortunately misspells ‘country’”.

Kludos to Jon; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

Not all setters foreswore the current: in the Independent, Knut gamely kept up 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160725#!201608>
 with various actual and attempted political decapitations. The whole puzzle is 
highly recommended, so look away now if you’re going to solve.

Since 11ac was ROD, this allowed Knut to clue ... 

4ac 11’s song Girls at No.10 (6,3)

 ... MAGGIE MAY and refer to both of the UK’s female PMs using the kind of 
outdated language associated with Rod Stewart’s heyday.
