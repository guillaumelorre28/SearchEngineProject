The 2008 Simpsons episode Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_and_Lisa_Exchange_Cross_Words> contains a 
jaw-dropping surprise. But it shouldn't be a surprise that the best show on TV 
comes at number one in our countdown of fictional crosswords.

Not that The Simpsons <http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/the-simpsons> is 
infallible, as testifies any of the episodes where the family travels abroad. 
But the writers of the 20th season knew their crosswords. Inspired by the 2006 
documentary about the New York Times puzzle,Wordplay 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/29/crossword-blog-nyt-puzzle>
, Simpsons producer James L Brooks approached the NYT's puzzle editor Will 
Shortz and asked if he would provide some grids for an episode with a crossword 
tournament.

As it turned out, the collaboration went much further: Shortz had a cameo as 
himself, is namechecked by Grampa Simpson - "will and shorts: two things I'm no 
longer allowed to change by myself" - and as we'll see below, also made an 
inspired suggestion.

It is of course Lisa Simpson who becomes hooked on crosswords and the story 
plays out with an attention to detail that never resorts to ridicule. We see 
how Lisa begins to find wordplay everywhere, a syndrome familiar to solvers and 
to some of the setters we've talked to inour Meet The Setter series 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords/series/meet-the-setter>: 

LISA: Bart, I've fallen in love with crosswords.
BART: It's finally happened - you've gone completely fruit loops.
LISA: Froot Loops! That's the answer to 38 down, 'Toucan's delight'.
BART: No, I mean you're loco in the coco.
LISA: Cocoa! 'Ice rink drink'.
BART: You're losing it.
LISA: Losin' It! 'Risqué 80s teen flick'.
BART: Fine. Go nuts. See if I care.
LISA: Eye care! 'Optician's concern'. Thanks for your help, Bart. BART! 'San 
Francisco people mover'.

We've seen in this series some fine examples of scriptwriters using a group 
solve for lively dialogue, and this is as good as any:

LISA: 'Bartenders serve them "dirty"'.
MOE: Ham sandwiches!
LISA: No, martinis.
MOE: Oh, right.

Lisa becomes a crossword convert...

LISA: Guess what, mom? I'm a cruciverbalist!
MARGE: Another religion? You know, you're just gonna drop the whole thing when 
you go to college and get a Jewish boyfriend.

...is later inspired by a school superintendent to enter the Citywide 
Crossword Tournament and of course reaches the final. Homer, gambling in a 
nearby bar, bets against her; when Lisa discovers his treachery, he's at a loss 
how to make it up to his daughter. Towards the end of the episode, Marge 
suggests that Lisa cheer herself up...

MARGE: Look, why don't you cheer up by doing a New York Times crossword 
puzzle, huh?
LISA: I'm through with crosswords. My innocence died in those four hundred and 
forty-one little boxes.
MARGE: It might be a fun way to kill a couple of hours?
LISA: A couple of hours?! I can do the Sunday puzzle in less than one hour. 
'Couple of hours'!

...and on completing the puzzle in record time, notices something unusual 
hidden in the main diagonal.

Yes, a chastened Homer has persuaded Will Shortz to publish a puzzle with an 
apology in the form of what crossword buffs call a "nina", a message not 
indicated by any of the clues.

We've deducted points in this countdown for some programmes and books because 
of inaccuracy - having puzzles that wouldn't actually appear in the real world. 
Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words can't be faulted in that category, because 
that fictional puzzle is actuallyan actual puzzle 
<http://select.nytimes.com/premium/xword/Nov1608.puz>, printed in the same 
day's real-world New York Times.

This is where Will Shortz went one better than the Simpsons team's ambitions. 
He commissioned Merl Reagle, one of the NYT's more playful setters, to 
construct the grid, and both appear towards the end in a cameo that pokes 
gentle fun at the relationship between a paper's puzzle editor and its setters:

HOMER: Well, I had a little help from this guy: New York Times crossword 
editor, Will Shortz. And master puzzle constructor, Merl Reagle.
REAGLE: I actually wrote that crossword.
SHORTZ: And I edited it. Now get back to crosswording!
REAGLE: Yes, sir.

Three decades before <http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/simpsons/>, 
Reagle had approached the LA Reader and suggested they publish his puzzles, 
hoping to meet their then little-known cartoonist, Matt Groening:

The day I went into their office the first thing I asked was if Matt was there 
and the secretary said, '[you] just passed him in the hall.' If I had arrived 
just 15 seconds sooner I would've had the chance to meet him and tell him how 
much I liked his comic and I've always imagined that we would've been at least 
casual friends from that day on. I can't tell you how often I've thought about 
those 15 seconds.

Reagle made up for this in spades, designing all the puzzles in the episode, 
including one Lisa makes out of hopscotch squares in the school playground: 
"You don't see them for very long, [but] when crossword fans watch this show… 
we want them to think that we got it right."

At one point in the script, Lisa's tournament rival announces: "I think I'll 
warm up with a bunch of Qs" and dots his competition grid with Qs. A gag, of 
course,admits Reagle 
<http://web.archive.org/web/20090225112015/http://media.wildcat.arizona.edu/media/storage/paper997/news/2008/11/14/News/Ua.Alum.Gets.Animated-3544418.shtml>
, "but I had to put the Qs in there where they threw them."

Everyone involved was also aware 
<http://www.sundaycrosswords.com/TheSimpsonsBehindtheScenes.pdf> that the 
reveal would be incredible for any viewers who had solved that day's New York 
Times:

I originally thought it would be a chance to hide a lot of character names 
throughout the puzzle - like 'Lisa' in 'palisade,' 'Moe' in 'amoeba,' etc - but 
the more that we talked about it the more it felt like the puzzle should be a 
totally normal Sunday Times crossword (or as normal as I get) and that the 
'Simpsons' parts should be thoroughly hidden so that most solvers wouldn't 
realize they were there until they watched the show.

It's fair to say that there's probably an overlap between those who solve the 
NYT on Sundays and Simpsons viewers, and minds were undoubtedly fried,like this 
solver's 
<http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?action=showall&boardid=40&threadid=38446#msg192962>
:

I had zero idea it was going to happen. It was a little bit scary, actually. 
Like 'did I eat mushrooms and forget about it?' scary.

You can see the completed grid at fan site XWord Info 
<http://www.xwordinfo.com/ShowPuzzle.aspx?date=11/16/2008>, but in the absence 
of the "live" experience, it's better to watch the episode first, as it has a 
final extra reveal that, like the penny-drop moments inthe Listener puzzle 
<http://www.listenercrossword.com/>, ties everything together and leaves you 
marvelling at the audacity of the construction.
