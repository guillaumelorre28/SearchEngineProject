Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>, the three-time 
heavyweight champion who proclaimed himself “the Greatest”, defied the US 
government over the Vietnam war, and later became one of the most well-known – 
and loved – sportsmen in history has died. He was 74.

Ali died late on Friday at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, the family’s 
spokesperson Bob Gunnell said. His funeral will take place in his home town of 
Louisville, Kentucky.

Ali was admitted to hospital on Thursday with a respiratory problem – a move 
that was described at the time as “a precaution”. However, reports emerged 24 
hours later which said he had been placed on a life support machine and his 
family “feared the worst”.

Ali had become increasingly frail since being diagnosed with Parkinson’s 
disease in 1984 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/20/parkinsons-disease-muhammad-ali>
, aged 42, and in recent years had limited his public appearances. Earlier this 
month his brother Rahman Ali revealed that the condition was so advancedhe 
could barely speak or leave his house

Paying tribute after his death, Foreman wrote: “Ali, Fraser and Foreman we 
were one guy. A part of me slipped away.”

He told the BBC: “Muhammad Ali was one of the greatest human beings I have 
ever met. No doubt he was one of the best people to have lived in this day and 
age.”

Another former world heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, wrote: “God came for 
his champion. So long great one.”

Tributes flooded in from the world of boxing, the wider sporting community and 
well beyond them. The former US president Bill Clinton described him as 
“courageous in the ring, inspiring to the young, compassionate to those in 
need, and strong and good-humoured in bearing the burden of his own health 
challenges”.

In 1967, still unbeaten and with no obvious challenger in sight, Ali was 
stripped of his titles and for three-and-a-half years had to scrape a living 
making campus speeches and appearing on Broadway. He lost his best years as a 
fighter yet as the opposition to Vietnam war grew, so did Ali’s popularity. By 
the mid 1970s he was the biggest sports star on the planet.

Grace and speed

In his physical prime, a decade earlier, Ali had such grace and foot speed 
that watching him perform almost became an extension of the balletic arts. He 
won Olympic light-heavyweight gold as an 18-year-old at the Rome Olympics and 
four years later, in 1964, he won the heavyweight title for the first time by 
stopping Liston in a major upset. Challengers were dispatched with a surgical 
beauty, although there was a vicious streak to him too: when Ernie Terrell 
called him by his birth name, Cassius Clay, Ali shouted at him “What’s my name?”

In 1971, within five months of his return in 1970, he earned a shot at his old 
title against Frazier, but no longer was he as elusive or brilliant.A thrilling 
contest ended with Ali suffering his first defeat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier-muhammad-ali-1971>, 
on points, after being dropped by a left hook in the 15th round.

A loss to the fit but limited Ken Norton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/19/ken-norton-jaw-breaking-fighter>
 appeared to confirm Ali’s decline – until, in 1974, he knocked out Foreman 
after using what he called“rope-a-dope” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/15/10-sporting-gambles>; lying on 
the ropes to conserve energy as his opponent punched himself out. Later, when 
Ali was asked when he should have retired, he admitted it was after that fight.

But he ploughed on, to a desperately gruelling decider with Frazier in Manilla 
which he won after Frazier’s trainer Eddie Futch pulled his man out before the 
15th round. Ali would later call it the closest thing to dying he could imagine.

Retired

In 1978, after winning the title for a third time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/11/boxing> by avenging a loss 
to Leon Spinks, Ali retired. When he dragged himself back into the ring in 1980
to face his old sparring partner Larry Holmes, aged 38 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/07/boxing.features>, he was 
probably in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. Tests carried out by the 
Mayo Clinic found he couldn’t hop on one foot well and had trouble 
co-ordinating his speech.

After a final fight, against Trevor Berbick in 1981 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2011/dec/11/boxing-muhammad-ali>, he 
retired but three years later Parkinson’s disease was diagnosed. By the end of 
the decade the speech of the man once dubbed “the Louisville Lip” for brash 
predictions before fights was reduced to a mumble.

Ali was well enough to light the torch to start the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, 
though his hands shook as a result of the disease taking further hold. After 
that there was further retreat into privacy and prayer.

But even in death his legacy burns on.
