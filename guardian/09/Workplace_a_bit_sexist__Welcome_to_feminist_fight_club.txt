Every month or so, a dozen of us – women in our 20s and 30s – would gather and 
talk about our jobs. It was a fight club, except without the fighting and 
without the men.

The rules were simple: what was said in the group stayed in the group. 
Membership was based not on merit but on vagina. Once you were in, you were in: 
embraced and respected, encouraged with fist bumps and cat videos, but no 
cattiness.


We were smart, ambitious women striving to “make it” in New York, a city that 
eats the soft alive. We had grown up in the era of girl power, when it was 
expected that girls could be and do whatever they wanted. The gender war, we 
thought, was a battle won long ago. And yet each of us was stumbling into 
gender landmines at seemingly every turn, often ones we didn’t even know 
existed.

There were times we’d gather in smaller, informal settings as needed: if one 
of us had a crisis, an upcoming job interview, an impending mental breakdown, 
or looming unemployment – which nearly every one of us had faced at one point 
or another.

But usually we simply hung out, ate, shot the shit, and talked about work.

There was Nola, a project manager at an advertising agency, who was leading a 
top-level client meeting when one of her male colleagues asked if she wouldn’t 
mind grabbing some coffee for the group. Stunned, she found herself trudging to 
the kitchen to complete the task. She returned to the meeting with a coffee 
stain down the front of her blouse and daggers in her eyes. There was 
documentary film-maker Tanya, whose idea was handed to a male colleague to 
produce. She was livid, but stayed quiet, not wanting to be viewed as too 
“emotional” or a poor team player.

It’s being talked over in a group setting, or having your idea attributed to 
someone else – more often than not a man

I was working at Tumblr <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tumblr> at the 
time. I’d been hired along with another editor; we would be co-editors, I was 
told. Which was sort of true, except that I had accepted the job before we had 
finalised my title. I was informed, casually, that he’d chosen the title of 
editor-in-chief. As in: the highest possible title a person in our field could 
hold. (I’d gone for “executive editor”.) I had been sneak-attacked with a 
surprise boss, and that boss was a dude. People looked at him, not me, in 
meetings.

Recognising sexism is harder than it once was. Like the micro-aggressions that 
people of colour endure daily – racism masked as subtle insults or dismissals – 
today’s sexism is insidious, casual, even friendly. It is a kind of 
can’t-put-your-finger-on-it behaviour that isn’t necessarily intentional or 
conscious. Sometimes women exhibit it, too. None of that makes it any less 
damaging.

On a day-to-day level, it’s being mistaken for the admin when you’re actually 
the one in charge. It’s being talked over in a group setting, over and over 
again, or having your idea attributed to someone else (more often than not a 
man). It’s following all the rules, leaning all the way in, and still having to 
worry about being perceived as “too aggressive” when you display the behaviour 
required of a person in charge. It’s having to work twice as hard to prove 
you’re once as good, or three, four, five times as hard if you happen to be 
female and of colour. It is the fact that women are still more likely than men 
to feel like imposters and that, when women rise up through the ranks, we like 
them less. Some call this form of sexism Death By A Thousand Cuts. Taken 
individually, the affronts don’t seem like that big a deal. But over time, and 
collectively, they are fatal.

In an ideal scenario, we’d have policies in place to ensure that our 
workplaces are equal – and hopefully we’ll get there. But even if we are 
working on a political level toward systemic change (wage equality for 
instance), even if every pop star in the world proclaims herself a feminist 
(thank you,Bey <https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce>), most of us still 
have to roll out of bed each morning feeling relatively powerless and face the 
mundane, subtle bullshit that confronts us on a daily basis. Diversity training 
doesn’t solve being the default “coffee girl”. We need weapons of our own, 
then. We must be armed with tactics to chip away at it from the outside and the 
inside. We need skills, hacks, battle tactics to fight for ourselves while also 
advocating for wider change. But this is not a solo task. We need other women 
by our side. So let’s start by linking arms.




He is not necessarily stealing your ideas outright, but in repeating them he 
gets the credit




Know the enemy: behaviour to watch out for

The enemy: the Himitator
He’s the guy in your creative writing class who restates your interpretation 
of a poem in an attempt to clarify what you said, but the teacher remembers him 
as the one who said it; the colleague who echoes your lesson plan, but then 
somehow gets seen as the innovator. He is not necessarily stealing your ideas 
outright, but in repeating them he gets the credit for them anyway.

The fight move: confront
Don’t be afraid to confront your Himitator – maybe he actually thinks he’s 
doing you a favour. If he’s your boss, try asking for advice on how you could 
convey your ideas better on the first round, because you’ve noticed he tends to 
restate them. If he’s a colleague, tell him you’re worried his attempt to help 
you might be backfiring. At the end of the day, giving rightful credit doesn’t 
just help you: it makes your creditor look good, too.

The fight move: shimitate
Move a preposition and a noun, and let the games begin.

You: “Given our first-quarter performance, I think it’s important we devote 
more resources to marketing.”

Bro: “You, know, Bob – marketing did really well in Q1. We should spend more 
money there.”

You: “Yup. As I said three seconds ago, it makes sense to increase our 
marketing budget.”

Bro: “Blah blah blah – my recommendation is that we double down on our spend.”

You: “I’m glad you’re in agreement with me, Dan. Since we’re all on the same 
page here, I’m going to let the marketing team know we’ll be increasing their 
budgets.”

Nope, Paul, I’m not on my period, but your sales reports look to be bleeding 
this company dry

The enemy: the menstruhater
The menstruhater assumes that any time a direct assertion comes out of a 
woman’s mouth it must be “that time of the month.” The Menstruhater isDonald 
Trump to Megyn Kelly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/megyn-kelly-donald-trump-interview-reality-tv-election>
, when he suggested that the Fox News anchor must have been “bleeding out of 
her whatever” because she’d dared ask about his verbal attacks on women. But he 
also goes as far back as the early days of space flight, when menstruation was 
part of the official Nasa argument – in the 1960s – for why women shouldn’t 
become astronauts. These days, he’s also likely to emerge in the form of that 
mostly likable guy who comes up to you after a meeting where you expressed 
displeasure with something, and asks, “Are you OK? You seemed really upset.”

The fight move: call him out
“Nope, Paul, I’m not on my period, but your sales reports look to be bleeding 
this company dry.”

“Oh, wait, Sam, I’m confused. Do you mean the time of the month when I conduct 
your performance review?”

The fight move: keep calm and carry on
Men gain professional status when they act angry, viewed as “passionate” about 
the job, while women lose status. So take a deep breath. Speak deliberately. 
Your anger is valid, but channel it into strategic manoeuvres. Don’t give him 
an easy way to say, “See?”

The Hoverer is a neutered version of the creepy Mad Men–era ass-grabber – he's 
always minutes away from asking you out

The enemy: the Hoverer
Like clockwork, he would appear at my desk – the boss who could come up with 
any number of reasons to talk to me. As far as I could tell, his main objective 
was to casually stare down my shirt. The Hoverer is a neutered version of the 
creepy Mad Men–era ass-grabber that your mother or grandmother had to contend 
with, and while he may not actually cross a line, he’s always about two minutes 
away from asking you out (and if it weren’t for HR departments and sexual 
harassment policies, he probably would). He makes you uncomfortable – and you 
want him gone.

The fight move: the brush-off
Do not make yourself available for conversation. Plug in headphones. Look 
away. Call your own voicemail. If you must engage, keep your conversations 
short and say you have to get back to work.

The fight move: see something, say something
Keep a record of each and every creepy interaction, with the time, date and 
circumstances. If it continues, report him to HR.




I watched the guys in my intern class get promoted into staff writing jobs, 
while I was still a part-time temp

Know thyself: female self-sabotage

It’s a strange feeling to believe at your very core that you’re good at 
something, yet simultaneously doubt that very thing is true. I never remembered 
feeling that way in school, but six months into my first job, doubt crept in 
and became a constant voice in the back of my head. Soon, it seemed to be 
taking over.

It began as I watched the guys in my intern class get promoted into staff 
writing jobs, while I was still a part-time temp, babysitting for my editor’s 
kid on weekends and working nights at a bar. It continued after I was hired on 
staff, even as I outpaced those same guys. It caused me to stumble over my 
words in meetings, certain I sounded like an idiot, or offer to get the coffee 
or take the notes, so that at least I’d be visibly contributing.

Amanda, a research assistant at a nonprofit organisation, was told she was 
doing an amazing job in her review, which would have conceivably been followed 
by a salary bump had she not interrupted her boss to say, “If you’re happy, 
then that’s all the raise I need.” (Yes, really.) Maybe it’s a sense that we 
still don’t deserve to have careers. It’s that little voice of self-doubt that 
chips away at your confidence; the feeling that even when you get the 
promotion, you’re undeserving, unprepared; or the sense that one mistake means 
you should probably just give up.

Everyone gets in their own way sometimes – men, too. What is essential is 
recognising when it’s happening and becoming aware of it, so that we can find a 
solution – or talk ourselves off the ledge.

Research shows having someone boast on your behalf is effective even if that 
person is clearly biased – like your mother

The saboteur: the Humble Bragger
She’s #blessed to have been granted a full scholarship, “grateful” (and 
“surprised!”) to have been promoted, and feels #lucky – not proud – to have won 
a prestigious award. What she’s trying to do is inform the world of her 
achievements – or, in other words, self-promote. The problem with the Humble 
Bragger is that she hesitates to brag directly, instead masking her pride in 
faux humility. She may not even be conscious of it, but the Humble Bragger 
knows that nobody likes a woman who boasts. But she also knows that too much 
modesty will undermine her. So she’s come up with a system to attribute her 
accomplishments to luck, so that we still like her. Which might be OK if it 
worked, but it doesn’t.

The fight move: don’t deprecate
One study found that people who bragged openly (“I’m the life of the party”) 
were actually more likable than those who made self-deprecating claims (“I’m 
never the life of the party”).Women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> are deprecated enough already. 
Leave the self-deprecation to the men who can afford it.

The fight move: just the facts
State facts, not opinions, when you’re talking about yourself. As in, “I 
programmed 79,387 lines of code this month”, not, “I’m a really good 
programmer”. While you’re at it, try to frame your accomplishments in a way 
that compare you with you, not with somebody else. So: “I programmed 79,387 
lines of code, which is 10,000 more lines than I programmed last quarter”, not, 
“I programmed 79,387 lines of code, which is 10,000 more than Sasha.”

The fight move: find a boast bitch
She’s your female hype man. She boasts for you, you boast for her; boasting 
for each other makes you both look better, yet neither of you is perceived as 
bragging about yourself. And no, I’m not making this up: research shows that 
having someone boast on your behalf is effective even if it’s clear that person 
is biased (like your mother).

Just consider asking for what it actually is that you want. A raise! An extra 
day of holiday!

The saboteur: the Ever-Faithful
The workplace isn’t a convent, or even a Scientology centre. Last time I 
checked, faith wasn’t paying the bills or buying your next round. And yet the 
Ever-Faithful is real: that person who believes that by putting her head down 
and doing a great job, by being loyal to the company, by simply having faith in 
the system, she will succeed. She’s the employee who doesn’t pursue another job 
offer because she wants to show her commitment, but then never gets that 
promotion she was hoping for. The merit system can work. But let’s be clear: 
there is no divine providence in the workplace.

The fight move: ask for what you want
Not the neutered, self-compromised version you think you can get. People, 
especially women, often don’t ask for what they want, which is one reason the 
wage gap still exists. Just consider asking for what it actually is that you 
want (a raise! An extra day of holiday! A new chair because your back is 
fucking killing you!) exactly as you want it.

The fight move: faith no more
Track your accomplishments so you’re relying on facts, not faith, when you ask 
for what you want. Even if you aren’t ready to quit, keep a log, so you have it 
when that blind faith runs out.

For women with children, when the first shift ends, the second one begins: 
kids, laundry, dinner, homework

The saboteur: the Burnout
The Burnout exists in a world in which superhuman-like stamina is often 
required of women. Men burn out, too, but not as much:in one study 
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6214a5.htm?s_cid=mm6214a5_w> of 18- 
to 44-year-olds, women were almost twice as likely as men to say they felt very 
tired, exhausted or worn out most days. And for women with children? When the 
first shift ends, the second one begins: kids, laundry, dinner, homework – all 
things that still disproportionately fall on women’s shoulders.

The fight move: phone-free zone
“Work will happen 24 hours a day, 365 days a year if you let it,” the 
Hollywood showrunnerShonda Rhimes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonda_Rhimes> 
has said. So set boundaries: when you’ll leave the office, the time you stop 
checking email. If you have the ability to do so, state these limits publicly 
so they set a precedent for others. Here’s what Rhimes’s email signature 
states: “Please note: I will not engage in work emails after 7pm or on 
weekends. IF I AM YOUR BOSS, MAY I SUGGEST: PUT DOWN YOUR PHONE.”

The fight move: max’n’relax
The less time you give yourself to recuperate, just to relax, the greater your 
burnout risk. Stop feeling guilty for going for a walk on your lunch break. 
Make time for you, and for the things that will help you keep your stress 
levels in check.

Booby traps: office stereotypes and how to hack ’em

Being a boss of any kind is hard, but being a boss as a woman is like an 
obstacle course, a maze of stereotypes, landmines and invisible booby traps 
surprising you at every turn. Oh, she asked you twice for something? What a 
nag. She made a demand? She’s such a diva. Then there are the challenges of 
simply trying to find a leadership style that works: not too authoritative, or 
you’ll be deemed unfeminine, but not too feminine, or you’re suddenly soft, not 
capable of making the tough calls.

And on and on and on . . .

The best thing we can do is sharpen our eyes to spot the traps and the hidden 
biases we are statistically almost guaranteed to face.

The catch-22 of women and power: to be successful, a woman must be liked; but 
to be liked, she mustn't be too successful

The trap: “Bitchy, bossy, too ambitious”
In early 2016, if you were to google “Bernie Sanders 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders>” and “ambition”, you would have 
found a host of articles about his “ambitious plans” and other posts commending 
his professional determination. But in the same web search forHillary Clinton 
<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/>, the top hits would focus on her “lifelong” 
personal ambition: “unbridled”, even “pathological”. Behold the catch-22 of 
women and power. To be successful, a woman must be liked; but to be liked, she 
must not be too successful. We may all know that women are perfectly capable as 
leaders. Yet on a deep, unconscious level we still find the image of an 
ambitious woman hard to swallow. For hundreds of years, it’s been culturally 
ingrained in us that men lead and women nurture. So when a woman turns around 
and exhibits “male” traits – ambition, assertion, sometimes even aggression– we 
somehow see her as not ladylike enough, and thus we like her less.

The hack: get your sexism in check
All of us – yes, really – are a little bit sexist (racist, too). It’s what 
scholars call “unconscious bias”, and each of us has it, the result of 
cognitive shortcuts made by our brains. If we acknowledge our inner sexist, we 
can check it. So, the next time an ambitious woman rubs you up the wrong way, 
ask yourself: would I dislike her if she were a man?

The hack: make female power the norm
Use sweetness, ambition or a combination of the two to get the fuck in power. 
Make ambition a female trait. Chip away at that glass ceiling and don’t 
apologise for it. And when you’ve trailblazed your way to the top, remember to 
bring other women with you.

Use niceness to your advantage by being nice and tough at once. Cloak your 
demands in sweetness, but make the demand

The trap: “She’s too nice to lead the team”
Ebonee was everything a political campaign might want in an intern. She was 
smart, committed, unwavering. Yet when it was announced that the campaign would 
hire one internfor a staff position, she didn’t get the job. As the campaign 
manager put it, “Ebonee is too nice. She can’t be taken seriously.”

Being nice shouldn’t undermine the perception of a person’s competence, yet 
when it comes to women, we tend to view the two traits as inversely related – a 
surplus of one leading to the belief you’re deficient in the other.

The hack: sweet like arsenic
Use niceness to your advantage by mastering the art of being nice and tough at 
once. Cloak your demands in sweetness, but make the demand.

The hack: watch your words
Cut the word “nice” from your vocabulary, along with all those other nurturing 
words we use to describe women (“kind”, “helpful”, “a team player”). Research 
has found that those words cause people to be viewed as less qualified. Next 
time you have the urge to describe your female colleague as “sympathetic”, try 
one of these “male” words instead: independent, confident, intelligent, fair.

Writing affirmations is one way to boost confidence and improve performance

The trap: “Am I confirming the stereotype?”
So you get hired by a company that likes to tout its commitment to 
“diversity”, yet you are one of just a few women on the team. You start to 
wonder if they’re looking at you funny, scrutinising you because you’re the 
only “other” in the room. One of them questions your work. Another asks, either 
innocently or not, “Where are you from?”

The pressure builds up and you start to second-guess yourself. You’re angry 
but you’re also anxious: you simply cannot fuck this up or you will prove the 
stereotype right. Then you make a small mistake and suddenly you begin to 
spiral. It’s a combination of imposter syndrome (that phenomenon where 
high-achieving women and minorities feel like they don’t belong) and stereotype 
threat (the fear that you will confirm the worst stereotypes about yourself– 
performing worse as a result), with actual sexism and racism thrown in (yes, 
often women and minorities really are held to a higher standard– their mistakes 
noticed more and remembered longer).

The hack: believe your own hype
Writing affirmations is one way to do this – they’re shown to boost confidence 
and improve performance. Writing down your successes is another method: so you 
can look back on them every time you feel a hint of self-doubt coming on.

The hack: underest-him-ation
Use any underestimation of your talent to your gain. Slay the assignment, win 
the negotiation, run intellectual circles around your opponent while they sit 
there trying to catch their breath. Then swivel around in your chair and say, 
ever so politely, “Boom.” (Also, keep a record of all the assignments you’ve 
slayed, so that when your boss expresses hesitation about your readiness for a 
promotion, you can attach it in an email to him. Subject line: Bitches get shit 
done.)

The beauty of Fight Club was we relied on each other for support if things 
were good and commiserated if things were bad

There was a brief period in 2014 when a few of us in the Fight Club seemed to 
hit rock bottom at once. I had been dumped after an eight-year relationship, 
gone freelance, and was now working out of my apartment, AKA my bed. There was 
one particular afternoon when I was coaxed out of my house by some Fight Club 
members for a sanity check. Three of us met at a cafe in the East Village, and 
spent 10 minutes talking about our bowel movements (we all had stress-induced 
IBS).

Amanda, a comedy writer, had – after months of searching for a new job while 
she toiled in a shitty one – quit without another one lined up. She was “free,” 
finally – but also not living for “free,” and so she was desperate for work. 
Asie, a set makeup artist and stylist, was four months pregnant and struggling 
to muster that enthusiastic “soooo excited, the gift of motherhood!” grin 
you’re apparently supposed to have. She was happy, but she was also terrified 
of what a baby meant for her career. Already she was too nauseated to work. We 
bought Amanda lunch, and Amanda fanned Asie with a menu when she thought she 
might vomit all over our table. Asie told me I needed to wash my hair. And then 
we burst out laughing.

This was the beauty of the Fight Club. Just as we could rely on one another 
for support when things were good, we could commiserate when things were bad. 
Many in the group were successful – but nobody is successful all the time.

Six years after it started, we could see that there was a lot of shit, but 
there were also a lot of victories. Negotiating raises. Boasting on one 
another’s behalf. We realised that the thing we were complaining about was 
actually doable – even conquerable – with the right support. Sometimes we just 
needed to vent, to laugh, and to go back to work a little lighter the next day. 
“That was the air in our lungs,” explained Asie, now with a 10-month-old 
daughter, the Fight Club’s youngest member. “It was going to a bar and 
laughing. Texting when ill or poor or disappointed. Or paying for someone’s 
lunch, because she quit her miserable sexist job.

“It was knowing we were not alone.”

Cry too much, and you’re too emotional. But if something sad happens and you 
don’t cry: stone cold bitch

Finally, embrace the tears

Here are a few places I have recently cried:

 * In bed.

 * In the bathroom of my office, crouched on the floor.

 * In a payphone that reeked of pee.

 * In front of the mirror trying to put on makeup, but crying every time the 
mascara wand hit my eye, resulting in black streaks that looked sort of sexy.

 * While watching a YouTube clip I later realised was branded content for 
Microsoft. Now I’m more depressed.

 * On every form of public transport: planes, cars, trains, subways, the bus, 
taxi. Also walking and cycling.

 * Outside my therapist’s office, which is next door to an STD clinic, which 
always felt like a very public statement.

 * In the shower, sitting down, wondering if I was going to get some kind of 
terrible vaginal infection from touching the porcelain.

Naturally, because I am apparently not only a frequent crier (I had a bad 
breakup, OK?), but also a professional journalist, I started keeping notes on 
everything I could find out about crying. There’s a whole lot of advice out 
there on the topic, most of it speculative, telling you to avoid the tears.


Cry too much, and you’re too emotional, your intellect and business acumen 
clouded by emotion. But if something sad happens and you don’t cry: stone cold 
bitch.

There’s plenty of advice on how to allegedly stop yourself crying: jutting out 
your jaw, drinking water, pinching yourself (really?), or even doing push-ups.

What that actually means is that we end up crouching in the stairs, blaming 
our allergies. Or we simply run outside and do what my friend Alfia calls 
“blinking one out” before walking back in and pretending like nothing happened.

Or… here’s a wild idea: we could just cry.

We could cry, because sometimes it happens, because everyone can get over it, 
because we’re grown-ass professional women who have good work to stand on, and 
because the other women in our office have most definitely cried, too.

We could cry because crying is good for you: it lowers cholesterol and helps 
high blood pressure, boosting your immune system and your mood.

We could cry because – guess what? – our tear ducts are anatomically 
shallower, leading to spillover, which makes our crying more visible.

Or we could cry because crying is sometimes our way of expressing frustration, 
and because work can be frustrating, and because, when men get frustrated at 
work, they get angry – and nobody writes articles about that. So, yes cry I 
tell you. Cry publicly.
