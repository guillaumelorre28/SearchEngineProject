The news in clues

Other newspapers may sprinkle hidden messages like confetti, but the Times 
retains moderation and consistency, conceding every thousand crosswords or so 
and allowing the number of the puzzle to appear in Roman numerals around the 
perimeter or similar.

Sometimes the solver feels like Miss Kenton considering the inscrutable Mr 
Stevens inThe Remains of the Day 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/remains-of-the-day.html>: does this reliable 
figure of bluffness secretly enjoy “a sentimental love story”?

Last week, we found out that it does.

For most solvers, last Tuesday’s puzzle 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/b6649b054c37f182014dbee692070139/print_solution/3>
 was the usual Times challenge, though some might have wondered why it kicked 
off with a relatively uncommon first name ...

1ac Pretty Welsh girl widely thought not to be all there (6)
[ some of the letters of WIDELYTHOUGHT ]

... perhaps requiring the __E__Y__H before seeing the answer; the Oxford 
Dictionary of First Names explains the “Pretty” part:

Delyth ♀ (Welsh)
Modern: composed of del ‘pretty, neat’ + the ending -yth, formed on the 
analogy of names such as Gwenyth

For one solver, though – Delyth Hughes, on her birthday, during a holiday in 
Cornwall <http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/puzzles/article4472164.ece> – it meant 
a little more. BIRTHDAY and WISHES at 28 and 29 across made for delicious 
misdirection: it might have looked for a moment as if the Times had unbuttoned 
its collar to wish one solver many happy returns, but it was the second clue, 
five across, that should have rung bells (and hopefully not alarm bells):

5ac ‘Will you marry me’, say, that’s forward also rude! (8)
[ type of rugby forward, then anagram (‘rude’) of ALSO ]
[ PROP + OSAL ]

In the words of her suitor, who had arranged the PROPOSAL puzzle with 
crossword editor Richard Rogan, then arranged it again among her presents, and 
who had the ring in his pocket:

She looked so surprised and didn’t say anything for about 30 seconds, before 
then saying ‘No’, which she thought was hilarious. But she did then say ‘Yes’ 
and I had to tell her this was the real Times crossword, not something I had 
printed out myself.

To my knowledge, the last time the paper did something like this was in 1967, 
when it received a letter from a colleague of a maths teacher named Alfred 
Bately, explaining that he was a devoted solver and was about to retire, and 
asking whether a clue might acknowledge this on his last day.

The reply said that “the crossword was certainly not the place for passing on 
personal messages”, but the puzzle at the end of term said otherwise, including 
GOODBYE MR CHIPS, MATHEMATICS, and ALF for good measure. The Thunderer, 
recalled Mr Bately’s friend, “was not as stony-hearted as [the] letter had led 
us to believe”.

So is this tickling tale the start of a Times trend? One would hope not. I am 
very partial to a themed puzzle, but there’s more variety in the crossword 
world if there’s a paper that eschews variety. In The Remains of the Day, Miss 
Kenton discovered that Mr Stevens did indeed enjoy a sentimental love story, 
after “[prising a] book away” from him, “practically one finger at a time”:


I cannot recall precisely what I said, but I remember showing Miss Kenton out 
of my pantry quite firmly and the episode was thus brought to a close.

 And the Times crossword editor told his paper 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/puzzles/article4472164.ece>:

This is a one-off. We won’t be doing it again.

Ah, good. As for you, dear reader, how would you clue HIDDEN MESSAGE?

Clueing competition

Ixioned can rest assured that his flattery got him everywhere when he created 
the teetering imagery of “Bloomin’ h**k, Alan’s sexy in stilettos!”

I enjoyed the playful definitions such as alberyalbery’s “shoddy type”, 
ketmando’s “Schumann recital” and jimdubya’s “Fancy footwork”, and hope one day 
to wear the fictional brands of thebrasselephant’s “’La Ankh’? Bloomin 
pretentious cobblers!” and especially Truth101’s “I’m Hank Balloon, fashion 
designer”.

The runners-up are ID2155366’s “Well-heeled fellow from low, dull and backward 
family” and phitonelly’s “Bill, Hank, Mona and Oscar resplendent in designer 
footwear”; the winner is steveran’s pithy “Designer shoes look boring in all 
but the extremes of womankind sadly.”

Kudos to Steve; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.


Clue of the fortnight

In a recent puzzle by Anax, aka Dean Mayer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/nov/10/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-anax>
, it seemed for a moment as if there was something personal in this clue, which 
had me wondering about what happens at the end of February for far too long ...

6d Dean intends to be naughty during last part of February (2,10,3)
[ synonym for ‘Dean’ + anagram of INTENDS, both inside synonym for ‘last’ ]
[ VALE + NTINESD, both inside STAY ]

... before realising it couldn’t be anything other than ST VALENTINE’S DAY. 
And the real personal touch here was hidden in the perimeter, in a classic of 
the Independent / Anax form: HAPPY SIXTEENTH MY GORGEOUS XANA – Xana, of 
course, beingthe inspiration for Anax’s nom de guerre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/nov/10/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-anax>
