 that have recently experienced misadventures.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

You have been told that the defendant in this trial is a vandal, a philistine 
and a daffy old rhino. It has been suggested that scribbling upon a piece of 
art on a gallery wall is something of which the defendant should be ashamed.

I put it to you that it should be a source of undying pride.

If I may, a little history lesson is in order.

The first crossword appeared in 1913 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2013/dec/20/100-years-crosswords-first-new-york>
, in an age that saw Duchamp plonking a bicycle wheel on a stool and Picasso 
taking a guitar to pieces. The crossword was the product of an age of 
dismantling, repurposing and playful disruption. If a crossword puzzle is not 
itself an avant-garde act, an intervention and deconstruction of language, then 
it is nothing.

And can you say the same of other puzzles: of dot-to-dots, or spot the ball 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/shortcuts/2015/jan/14/how-to-spot-the-ball-in-spot-the-ball>
? The very idea is preposterous.

More than that, though, the crossword invites participation. Since that first 
puzzle appeared 103 years ago, it has been the only part of a newspaper that we 
are invited to interact with, to scrawl upon, to make marks to express the 
workings of our minds.

Ah! We are not merely invited to do so. We are obliged to do so. A work of art 
is nothing unless it is seen. A work of art that takes the form of a crossword 
puzzle is nothing until it is written upon, until its desolate empty squares 
have been filled with letters. In pencil or in pen. Accurately or inaccurately.

In closing, I ask you to consider this. In galleries around the world, we 
stand in our millions, before the works, as mere gawpers. Ovine fools who fail 
utterly to respond. In the minds of most, the thought of whipping out a Biro 
and scrawling on the art never even occurs.

Who, then, are the real criminals?

I rest my case.
