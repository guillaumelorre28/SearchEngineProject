The news in clues

The solution has been published for Gaff’s weekend cryptic in the Financial 
Times 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/f931b6a6-8a56-11e5-9f8c-a8d619fa707c.pdf>
, which had the rubric “An anniversary puzzle”. There was an inadvertent red 
herring at 23 across ...

23ac Clinging and maybe well content in secret (6) 
[ something which may be the content of a well, inside a synonym for ‘secret’]
[ INK inside SLY ]

... in that the SLINKY spring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/dec/13/classicsofeverydaydesignno26>
 recently celebrated 70 years of walking down stairs, alone or in pairs. But 
even the unstintingly ingenious Gaff (read our Q&A with him here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/feb/10/puzzles>) 
couldn’t construct a whole broadsheet cryptic from that single toy, could he? 
Maybe fora Listener puzzle <http://www.listenercrossword.com/>, where a set of 
misprints would slink their stepwise way down the grid or something similarly 
mind-blowing, but not in a normal one.

And in fact, as other entries ...

14ac In revolution, French nobility run with the wind (4)
[ the French for ‘dukes’, spelled backwards ]

... such as SCUD revealed, this was not about a single toy, but a whole 
storyful. In the clue context, when a cloud SCUDs, it moves along swiftly and 
smoothly; in the theme, SCUD is the vicious terrier who lives next door to 
Woody, Buzz and the other characters inToy Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/toy-story>.

Depending on your age, the realisation that Toy Story was released 20 years 
ago may induce nostalgia for childhood, or a panic that two decades have passed 
so quickly. Either way, if you’ve seen any of the films in the franchise,the 
puzzle is well worth your time 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/f931b6a6-8a56-11e5-9f8c-a8d619fa707c.pdf>
, even with my having spoilered the theme.

Latter patter

I enjoyed one clue in particular from Pasquale (Q&A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/02/crossword-blog-meet-setter-pasquale>
)’srecent Guardian puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26744#15-down>:

15d More than one old vagabond manages to pinch precious material (9)
[ synonym for ‘manages’, containing a metal that can be precious ]
[ RUNS containing AGATE ]

A variant on “renegades”, RUNAGATES is a splendid obsolete word for those who 
have renounced their faith, for restless roving folk, or a general way of 
conveying bad-assery. Rafael Sabatini, creator ofthe fearsome pirate Captain 
Blood <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/captain-blood.html>, used it as 
recently as 1922 ...

 From Rafael Sabatini’s Captain Blood: His Odyssey. 
... but it was in another puzzle that I first encountered the idea of a 
RUNAGATE. It’s a Saturday cryptic from the Times, in October 1966, and the clue 
was:

14d Make off with a gem, the vagabond (8)
[ synonym for ‘make off’ + a kind of gem ]
[ RUN + AGATE ]

The reason I wanted to solve such an old puzzle was that it also contained 
“This provides the stop in a sentence (4)” for GAOL, as well as ARTILLERY and 
various other entries that seemed entirely unremarkable for two days. But on 
the Monday, the convicted double agent (andTimes crossword 
<http://crosswordclub.co.uk/crosswords/cryptic/> devotee) George Blake became a 
RUNAGATE (it also means “runaway”) from gaol, and the Soviets had their getaway 
car waiting around the corner from the Scrubs, in Artillery Lane.

And so, two decades after the great D-day puzzle mystery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/may/12/crossword-unsolved-mystery-d-day-puzzles-leonard-dawe>
, military intelligence found itself again interrogating a broadsheet setter 
about whether he was using his puzzle to disseminate treasonous plans. This one 
seems as likely as any to be down to coincidence, but it’s another fantastic 
crosswording tale, andthe setter’s son, David Akenhead, tells it well 
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.puzzles.crosswords/C2XY8-OilyM>:

My father was a magician, but his veritable Houdini act in convincing the men 
in grey suits of his innocence in the affair was truly remarkable – walls have 
ears and I was there – in typical fashion he said little and listened!

The life of the vagabond, like most lives where people have to disguise what 
they’re saying, is a rich source of the slang that’s beloved of crossword 
setters. And that includes words for “vagabond” itself, which brings us to our 
next challenge.

In his book on American English, Made in America 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/made-in-america.html>, Bill Bryson muses on a 
piece of slang that appeared without trace.

Among the theories: that it is a contraction of ‘homeward bound’ or that it 
has something to do with the salutation ‘Ho! Beau!’, which sounds a trifle 
refined for vagrants, but in fact was a common cry among railway workers in the 
19th century and would certainly have been familiar to those who rode the rails.

So, reader: how would you clue HOBO?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for PANOPTICON 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/nov/23/crossword-roundup-the-all-seeing-eye>
. There’s something Borgesian about this institution that lends itself to 
splendid allusive descriptions, such as steveran’s “Vicious circle?”, ousgg’s 
“Building held together by one central screw” and, taking the audacity award, 
Middlebro’s “All around the watchtower”.

Also, please contrast and compare alberyalbery’s “I cannot pop out to get 
cooler?” and TwoDarrinStephens’ “I cannot pop off, Nick – that’s inescapable”. 
It’s hard to say which is more pleasing.

There was a sense in Ojisan’s “Can fantastic piper decide on representation?” 
that suggested Borges meets Del Toro, perhaps; a surface reading that’s hard to 
shake.

The runners-up, though, are yungylek’s clever “Round container to take a 
prisoner” and harlobarlo’s poignant “Can’t poop in dilapidated building which 
offers no privacy”; the winner is diplocaulobium’s topi-acrosti-cal “Bentham’s 
ideal prison arrangement now only punishes those internet ‘criminals’ offending 
national leaders”.

Kudos to Diplo; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

Alberyalbery nominated a Sunday Times clue by Tim Moorey 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/b6433bf14c37f0a70150f6adc8e40229/print_solution/3>
 ...

13ac Impression made by TV lexicographer? (4)
[ surname of a lexicographer seen on TV ]

... which should bring unconfined joy to any solver who owns a television, 
since it paid small tribute to the longest-serving and very best member of an 
anagram-friendly show: Susie DENT.
