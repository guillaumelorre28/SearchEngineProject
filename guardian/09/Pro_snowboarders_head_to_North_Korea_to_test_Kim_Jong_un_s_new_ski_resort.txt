“The riders are really excited about it. These guys have a sense of adventure 
and they’re always down to go to far flung locales so they were eager to ride 
Masik Pass,” Tom Monterosso, the magazine’s editor, said in a press release.

Running from 9-16 January and costing $2,400, the trip includes a helicopter 
flight to Masikryong from Pyongyang and a chance to ride alongside “the best 
snowboarders who have ever lived”, according toa statement by Uri Tours 
<http://uritours.com/tours>, the company organising the trip.

The company’s CEO, Andrea Lee, said: “We have found that sports is an 
effective avenue for engagement and interaction between foreign travellers and 
local people, particularly where language can be a barrier.”

Sport focus

Leader Kim Jong-un <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un> has made it 
clear he wants to put the DPRK at the centre of the international sporting 
stage, with the January tour just one of a number initiatives aimed at 
promoting the DPRK’s facilities.


This year saw the completion of an ambitious restoration of Pyongyang’s 
flagship May Day stadium

, apparently as part of the regime’s wish to host both the football World Cup 
and the Olympic Games in future.

In addition, a variety of new venues have appeared across the country, 
including roller-skating facilities, a horse-riding centre, a surf centre near 
the eastern city of Hamhung and a brand new football academy,built with an 
$800,000 grant

Revenue

The Masikryong resort is one of the larger scale construction projects built 
at the behest of DPRK leader in recent years, thought to have cost an estimated 
$30m to build.

Charging $50 per person entry, the People’s Committee in Kangwon Province and 
DPRK Ministry of Sportsreportedly anticipate a net revenue  
<http://www.nknews.org/2013/08/north-korean-ski-resort-anticipates-5000-customers-per-day/>
of $62.5m from the ski resort per year, of which $43.75m will be profit.

“North Korea is trying to cover their revenue through those kinds of tours and 
events. In the past, they got a lot of money by running the [Mount] Kumgang 
tours,” says Shin Yong-seok, a researcher at the Korea Culture and Tourism 
Institute.

But Shin is sceptical the resort will reach its targets. “I think Masikryong 
is not an attractive ski resort because for Chinese visitors, skiing is not a 
familiar sport. And for the Americans and Europeans, [though] they are more 
familiar with skiing they have domestic resorts. So, it seems it has not paid 
for itself until now.”

A Uri Tours press release also mentions the construction of new facilities at 
Masikryong. “The total area of the resort is 1412 hectares, with 10 runs, 4 
chairlifts and a new gondola installed this year,” the statement reads.
