Welcome back to our ongoing effort to demystify cryptic clueing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/mar/21/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-capital-letters>
 and entice the cautious but curious to crosswords based on wordplay.

A quick reminder that a cryptic clue typically has a definition of the answer 
(either at its beginning or its end and indicated inbold below), and a little 
recipe for the letters that spell out that answer. (The names of the setters 
whose clues are cited generally link to Q&As, if you want to try to get inside 
the head of each.)

A neat way of giving that recipe is to use abbreviations that can be combined 
or meddled with, and so solvers get to know the lingo used in various areas of 
life that have a lot of abbreviations. The British army, for example.

The most important thing you need to know – and the soldier that you encounter 
most often when solving – is the GI. This priapic nylons-sporting visitor might 
behistory now <http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20160819>, and it’s of at least 
mild interest to note that the letters may have originally stood for 
“galvanized iron” rather than “government issue”, but all the solver needs to 
remember is that “soldier” in a clue might indicate GI in the answer.Here’s

13ac Musical soldiers (4)
[ abbrev. for a soldier, twice ]

It’s “soldiers” plural here, so you take GI twice and you’ve got yourself the 
title ofa Lerner/Loewe musical 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/aug/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview20>
, GIGI.

Not so hard, is it?

Except that it’s not always that simple ...

... in the military, or in cryptic clueing. If GI gets you nowhere, perhaps 
the setter has some other soldiers in mind.Here’s

19ac Blunt character soldiers follow? (7)
[ synonym for ‘character’, ‘followed’ by abbrev. for some ‘soldiers’ ]
[ TRAIT followed by OR ]

These soldiers are the Other Ranks, abbreviated to OR and whacked after TRAIT 
to give such a TRAITOR as(Anthony) Blunt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/apr/11/crossword-roundup-covert-spies-and-cats-whiskers>
. Oh yes, and those soldiers might also indicate the letters NCO 
(non-commissioned officers) as part of ENCORE, INCOME or indeed COMMON COLD.

Those in the higher ranks tend to be clued with the more respectful “officer”, 
and the one to keep in mind is the colonel.Nutmeg

16ac Officer slow to check everything’s in order (7)
[ abbrev. for an ‘officer’ + synonym for ‘late’ ]
[ COL + LATE ]

And that’s it. Oh, except that of course, “soldiers” might equally indicate a 
corps.Here’s <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26161> Rufus

1ac To fall back, a mistake made by soldiers (7)
[ synonym for ‘mistake’ after (‘by’) abbrev. for ‘Royal Engineers’ 
(‘soldiers’) ]
[ RE + LAPSE ]

The RE’s colleagues in the Regiment of Artillery, by the way, tend to be clued 
by “gunners”, requiring an RA.

And that really is it. Um, except to say that since “men” is a way of 
referring to soldiers, “men” in a clue might be doing the same job, or MEN 
might be part of the answer to a clue describing military matters, except that 
“men” might also have something to do with chessmen (which we’ll return to).

Ah yes, and thanks to the existence of the existence of belligerent termites, 
“soldier” might also mean something that’s not even a person.Here’s

6d Soldier shackling a young rogue, one solving others’ problems? (5,4)
[ what a ‘soldier’ might be, going around (‘shackling’) an anagram (‘rogue’) 
of AYOUNG ]
[ ANT around GONYAU ]

... with a clue for AGONY AUNT which uses “soldier”, like other puzzles use 
“worker”, to give ANT. I know, it’s a minefield. Happily, only in metaphor.
