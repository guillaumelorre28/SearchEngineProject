The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> is struggling to meet its own 
targets on increasing the diversity of its workforce, with a tiny increase in 
minority employees over the past year and an actual decline in the number of 
disabled employees.

The number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff employed by the 
BBC rose by just 42 to 2,405, an increase from 11.9% to 12.2%, according to
figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Broadcast magazine 
<http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/bbc-fails-to-make-strides-in-boosting-staff-diversity/5100975.article>
.

This percentage is below the BBC’s own targets of 14.2% of its workforce being 
from diverse backgrounds by 2017 as well as the national average in the UK 
where 12.9% of residents identified themselves as non-white in the 2011 census. 
This proportion is higher in London, where most BBC employees work.

Using the same data, just 733, or 3.7% of the workforce, staff identified 
themselves as having a disability in 2015, 35 fewer BBC than in 2014. The BBC’s 
target is 5.3% by 2017. There were also more disabled people leaving the BBC. 
Some 143 disabled staff exited the broadcaster last year, compared with 52 in 
2014.

On Wednesday, Trevor Phillips, the former Equality and Human Rights Commission 
chair,criticised the BBC for failing to attract minority audiences

.

He accused BBC2 of being “Britain’s whitest TV station” after analysis that 
that the channel enjoyed 5.7% share of the total audience but just 3.3% of 
black, Asian and ethnic minority viewers. In comparison, the state-owned 
commercially funded Channel 4 attracted a far higher percentage of BAME viewers.

In June 2014, BBC director general Hall announced new diversity targets both 
on and off air and said: “My aim is for the BBC to be the number one 
destination for talented people, regardless of their background.”

With more BAME employees leaving that the total workforce average, there are 
signs that 2017 targets will be even harder to reach this year.

The number of BAME staff leaving the BBC jumped from 173 in 2014 to 379 last 
year, an increase of 120%, according to the FoI data, when the broadcaster’s 
total workforce was down only 0.5% to 19,644.

The total number of leavers growing increased from 1,224 to 3,143 year on 
year, however.

A BBC spokeswoman pledged to do more and said: “We want an open and diverse 
BBC, which is why we have implemented ambitious plans and targets to improve on 
and off-air representation of BAME and disabled people.”
