Loft, Bourg-Saint-Maurice, France

It may be a hostel offering budget accommodation with great access to the 
Paradiski <http://en.paradiski.com/> area of Les Arcs, La Plagne and 
Peisey-Vallandry, but don't expect Loft to scrimp on style. With big lounge 
areas, Sky TV, a pool table, Wi‑Fi, primary colours and well-thought-out 
storage, it's a very fresh take on cheap and cheerful. Plus it's just become a 
test centre for Ride Snowboards, so this season you can try the latest gear for 
free.

Vert Hotel, Chamonix, France

There's a lot you can achieve with fairy lights, and the Vert demonstrates 
this with panache in its bar and restaurant. Rooms are decorated with Alpine 
simplicity and all are en suite with free Wi-Fi. Despite being a 15‑minute walk 
from town, the Vert hosts some incredibly popular nights and has a friendly, 
lively après ski dotted with famous extreme sports athletes.

Rudechalets, Avoriaz, France

Avoriaz has one of the best snowparks in Europe for freestyle skiing and 
snowboarding. But if you lack the skills to look cool on the slopes, at least 
with Rude you've got somewhere to retire to that can up your trendiness quota. 
Their two self-catering apartments are slick white with colourful touches, 
flatscreen TVs, Xboxes and funky sofas to rest those bruised limbs on.

Mooser Hotel, St Anton, Austria

Attached to one of the world's greatest and wildest après-ski bars, the new 
Mooser is a total contrast to the dancing on tables and beer swilling that goes 
on next door at the MooserWirt bar. Instead, it's a peaceful and uber-stylish 
bolthole, with a bar that overlooks the slopes, amazing food and a spa with an 
outdoor pool. Rooms come with iPod docks, giant flatscreen tellies and glass 
cube bathrooms with blinds.
• Book through Kaluma Ski (01730 260263, kalumatravel.co.uk

Hôtel Ormelune, Val d'Isère, France 

It don't come cheap, but it sure is pretty – the Hôtel Ormelune is heaven for 
design lovers. Spot a fireplace with flames poking up through smooth pebbles, 
reindeer-shaped coathooks, piles of vintage suitcases, and red or feathered 
chandeliers, or find the life‑sized colourfully painted cows – all were added 
in a revamp two years ago that replaced the Alpine-chintz look with colourful 
craziness.
