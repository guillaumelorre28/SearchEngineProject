The last time I went to Ischgl, I went out every night. I had boozy lunches in 
mountain restaurants, indulged in wild and gloriously unhip Austrian après- ski 
sessions and at the end of the night often ended up in Pacha nightclub, which 
was then in the basement of the Hotel Madlein.

It was almost a decade ago but even in my younger days that wasn’t normal 
practice for me in the mountains. Ischgl was most definitely a party town, the 
“Ibiza of the Alps”, and the slopes were sunny and mellow, with very little to 
challenge a powder-loving snowboarder, so I figured I had little to stay sober 
for.

The trip I made recently could not have been more different. I found Ischgl to 
be snowboard heaven. I rode powder all day, on long, varied and at times 
technical runs, with plenty of off-piste. And I went to bed early every night, 
because all I could think about was the next day’s snowboarding.

“Can this really be the same resort?” I asked my freeride guide Michael 
Zangerl from theIschgl ski school <http://www.skischule-ischgl.at/>, while 
brushing a beard of fresh snow off my face. “Of course. You obviously weren’t 
looking hard enough,” he laughed.

Back then, this wasn’t a side Ischgl was showing to the world. Party-lovers 
flocked here to hear Paris Hilton on the decks and join crowds of 25,000 at the 
outdoor Top of the Mountain concerts with big-name acts.

“We’re proud of our entertainment heritage,” said Zangerl, “but we also want 
to promote our active side – from off-piste skiing and snowboarding to 
cross-country skiing or even winter hiking and running. We want people to 
explore the mountain more, to have an adventure.”

With this in mind, the ski school has expanded its freeride offering, with 
individual and group guided sessions which include avalanche training and 
rescue techniques, plus women-only clinics and ski hut safaris.

The biggest boon for those wanting to ski and snowboard off the beaten track 
here came three seasons ago when the Piz Val Gronda lift opened up a fantastic 
freeride area previously accessible only via a long, steep hike.

Despite it being a powder day, and one of the best spots on the mountain, 
there was no queue when I headed out to put it to the test – an unimaginable 
scenario in a more well-known freeride resort, such as Chamonix or even nearby 
St Anton.

From the top of the Piz Val Gronda there is a great red piste, but the real 
excitement lies on either side of a majestic ridge to the left as you’re 
looking down the mountain. We let a GoPro-toting group leave ahead of us then 
walked along the flat top of the ridge for about 10 minutes enjoying views of 
unending white peaks. The only sound was the snow, still fresh enough to squeak 
under our feet.

One side had a series of mouthwatering chutes. I counted at least eight, which 
joined back up with the red piste from the top. But we dropped off the other 
side to Nederberg, a notional “Neverland” according to my guide, which was apt 
given its curves and deep hidden pockets of fresh snow.

It’s a treat to have so much off-piste terrain so close to the lifts without 
the need for a tough hike on splitboard or touring skis. And while it’s best to 
tackle the Piz Val Gronda ridge with a guide, there are plenty of top-quality 
black runs and off-piste terrain as well as a few good lines through the trees. 
We spent the next afternoon exploring, often tracing out first tracks.

Ischgl is a relatively high resort, and has a good snow record, with the 
season running until May. Zangerl told me that seasonal workers from St Anton 
often come here to beat the crowds, and also because the fresh snow stays 
untracked for far longer than it does at their home resort.

Of course, there are still plenty of visitors who come to this smart former 
farming village for the bonkers oompah-style après-ski at places such asTrofana 
Alm <http://www.trofana-alm.at/> and Kuhstall <http://kuhstall.at/>. Others 
come for glitzy restaurants including the Michelin-starredPaznaunerstube 
<http://www.trofana-royal.at/en/gourmethotel-ischgl/paznaunerstube.html> at the 
Hotel Trofana Royal or the award-winningStüva 
<http://www.yscla.at/en/restaurant-ischgl/>, though there are also plenty of 
affordable options such as the pizzeriaLa Candela 
<http://victoria-ischgl.at/de/pizzeria-in-ischgl.html>. Many hotels, including 
Hotel Antony <http://www.antony-ischgl.com/> (from €95pp half-board) where I 
stayed, do good-value half-board deals, with tasty and energy-replenishing 
Tyrolean set menus. Highlights includekäsespätzle, a kind of superior macaroni 
cheese, andspinatknödel (spinach dumplings).

Because of all the partying, the resort attracts a lot of beginners and 
intermediates, and they tend to stick to the pistes, leaving ample fresh snow 
elsewhere for those who want it. An added bonus is that the off-piste scene is 
not intimidating, as it can be in places like Chamonix, where hardcore locals 
carry giant powder skis, with ice axes swinging from their backpacks – so 
skiers or snowboarders who haven’t done much off-piste can happily test the 
waters.

And after all, if you give it a go and find it’s not for you, there’s no 
excuse not to dive head-first into some of the most extreme and amusing après 
ski you’ll ever see. And on my last night, with no more mountain days ahead of 
me, I did just that.
