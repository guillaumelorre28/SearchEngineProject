Krakow culture in five words

Progressive spirit within medieval frame. 

Sound of the city


Pigeons – impossible to avoid (unless you duck) when you enter the main square.

Everyone’s tuning into … 


OFF Radio Krakow <http://off.radiokrakow.pl/>, a new online sub-station of 
local Radio Krakow, curated by music journalists and DJs who are passionate 
about the medium. It keeps pace with the city and offers a unique, varied 
soundtrack, from crate-digger’s treasures to future beats and metal, echoing 
the best traditions of Polish alternative radio.

Best current venue
 The beach by the river at Hotel Forum, Krakow. 
FORUM Przestrzenie <http://www.forumprzestrzenie.com/> (ul. Konopnickiej 28, 
Kraków). Built in the 1980s, Hotel Forum, with its imposing brutalist/modernist 
silhouette, rises above the banks of the Vistula. Unused for a decade, it 
increasingly came to resemble a haunted concrete castle. In 2012 it began its 
second life during Unsound festival, and from that moment on succumbed to the 
local creative spirit.

The former hotel currently hosts a cafe/club with a small beach by the river, 
and organises regular club events, concerts, creative meetings, workshops, 
food, fashion and music fairs.


Who’s top of the playlist? 


Sympli Romatikó are a well-known trio on the experimental and improvisation 
scene. Denis Kolokol (electronics), Ernest Ogórek (bass) and Tomek Chołoniewski 
(drums) describe their sound as “inhuman music made by humans for humankind”, 
and draw from electroacoustic music and algorhythmic composition. During live 
performances, however, the human element takes over, with gesture-controlled 
electronics and a powerful rhythm section building a space-rock atmosphere.

Krakow is a city of the arts, and this bohemian spirit colours its street 
style. New pieces from local designers and vintage treasures – the result of 
forages in the city’s numerous second-hand shops – are both common. More 
mainstream Krakowians prefer international urban-casual: parkas, sneakers, 
beanies and big scarves.Streetfashionincracow <http://streetfashionincracow.pl> 
is a great blog.

Kabaret (comedy) is one of the most popular forms of entertainment in Poland, 
usually performed by troupes. 7 Minut Po are one from Krakow, whose style is 
simultaneously absurd and poetic: typically Krakowian. Their live rendering of
French group Oldelaf’s animation Le Cafe 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGtKGX8B9hU> went viral. 

For the bookworm


Karakter publishing house <http://www.karakter.pl/> successfully pursues the 
idea of “publishing what it likes most”. This includes both fiction and 
non-fiction, mainly from African, Caribbean and Asian authors, as well as 
writings about the visual arts and architecture. But perhaps the most 
interesting thing about Karakter is that it continues an excellent tradition of 
Polish book-cover design, fighting against the wave of visual blandness that 
took over in the 1990s.

Filip Kuźniarz’s mural, commissioned by the Conrad festival, quotes Stanisław 
Lem’s Dialogues: “In the end, humans will be reduced to brainless servants of 
iron geniuses and perhaps will start worshipping them as gods …”

 Grzegorz Turnau’s poetic song Bracka 
Piosenka poetycka (poetic song) is a specific musical genre in which dramatic 
lyrics are set to mild, acoustic music and delivered with extreme 
theatricality. Grzegorz Turnau is one of its biggest stars. In his songBracka 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuW6Pvwj4I> he talks of rolling up wet 
carpets: “Wet not with rain, but with tears.”

Moment in history
 Wanda Warska & Trio Jazzowe Andrzeja Kurylewicza playing at the Helikon club, 
Krakow 
The launch of the Helikon club in 1959 was a milestone in the history of 
Polish jazz. After a “catacomb” period, when the music was outlawed by the 
authorities who considered it a decadent western form and musicians played only 
in private houses, there was an explosion of jazz. The Helikon club helped 
launch the careers of Krzysztof Komeda, Tomasz Stańko, Adam Kurylewicz and many 
others who shaped the Polish scene.
