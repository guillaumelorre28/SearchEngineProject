Paisley Park, which has a concert venue and bank vault in its grounds, has 
long been a source of myth and intrigue among Prince fans, many of whom had 
been invited inside to watch the musician perform during one of his regular 
lengthy shows.
According to Prince’s first manager, Owen Husney

the singer was planning to turn Paisley Park into a Graceland-style public 
space for fans in the months leading up to his death.
