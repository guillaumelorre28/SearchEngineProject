Donald Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner and not exactly friend 
of women

, was expected to say some confrontational things at the first Republican 
presidential debate on Thursday.

But when his machismo went up against Megyn Kelly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/megyn-kelly>, the Fox News personality, 
debate moderator and nonstop voice for women’s issues, he didn’t stand a 
chance. In fact, Kelly spent most of the debate grilling Jeb Bush, Scott Walker 
and more candidates with surprisingly tough questions over reproductive rights 
and beyond.

“You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting 
animals,” Kelly began her question, about as directly as you can.


“Only Rosie O’Donnell,” Trump interrupted with a sneer, earning cheers from 
the crowd.


Kelly wasn’t having it. Any of it.


“For the record, it was way beyond Rosie O’Donnell,” Kelly said – before 
launching into a laundry list Trump’s most misogynistic moments:

Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women’s looks. You 
once told a contestant on the Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture 
to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man 
we should elect as president? And how do you answer the charge from Hillary 
Clinton – that you are part of the war on women?

Trump, unchastened, responded with a misdirect: “I think the big problem this 
country has is being politically correct.”

Then he made a veiled threat at Kelly herself. 

“What I say is what I say, and honestly, Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m 
sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based 
on the way you’ve treated me, but I wouldn’t do that.”

O’Donnell herself fired off a tweet shortly after the exchange, in an apparent 
rebuke to Trump.

Twitter was quick to cheer Kelly’s taking Trump to task for his comments.

Is someone going to tell Megyn Kelly she's not judging an episode RuPaul's 
Drag Race, with all that shade?

Even liberals backed Kelly, the longtime prime-time Fox star. Guardian 
columnist Jessica Valenti wrote

: “I’m not generally a Fox News fan, but I may have to turn in more often if 
I’m going to see Kelly be such a bad-ass.”

Kelly earned praise again with her blunt question on abortion to Governor 
Scott Walker, who recentlyenacted restrictive anti-choice legislation in 
Wisconsin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/09/scott-walker-abortion-20-week-ban-wisconsin>
. “Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion?” she asked.

Later in the debate, Jeb Bush bragged that he had defunded Planned Parenthood 
as governor of Florida and “defended a culture of life”. He looked on the 
defensive after asking earlier this weekif it was worth spending half a billion 
dollars on women’s health issues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/05/jeb-bush-planned-parenthood-pro-life-womens-health>
. It was Kelly, once again, putting him there.

Kelly then pushed Rubio on his position on a rape-and-incest exception for 
abortion.

Then Kelly turned back to Trump, once again, on women’s issues.

“When did you actually become a Republican?” she asked.

“I am pro-life,” Trump said. He said he had evolved on abortion – that he used 
to “hate abortion” but that he had seen a child who had “become a superstar”.

Then Trump turned to a rambling answer about Bush, Obama and ... well, Megyn 
Kelly turned back to a question referring to a report about Bush reportedly 
calling Trump a “clown”, “a buffoon” and something that “couldn’t be repeated 
on television”:“asshole”
