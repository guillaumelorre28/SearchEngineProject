In the past couple of years my snowboarding has very much become a “get it 
where you can” affair. With time and funds in short supply, week-long holidays 
have given way to a few days here and there. So whenever snow hits England I’m 
motivated to try to get involved here.

In recent years, snow even at sea level has made it possible for me to enjoy 
riding rails on the mean streets of Leeds. So far this year, however, snow has 
been limited to the highest places. Last Wednesday (21 January), it was looking 
good in the hills so my friends and I planned a jaunt up to Yad Moss, a small 
ski area with a button lift on the very top, 90 miles away on the border 
between County Durham and Cumbria. As that plan was being hatched on social 
media, a friend sent a message saying that we should check out West Yorkshire’s 
very own ski resort, Ogden, a few miles north of Halifax. On itsAnother World 
website <http://a42240.wix.com/another-world-skiing>, I could see rope tows, 
jumps, a tree run and even a boardercross course. Within two minutes we changed 
our plan. Out with the four-hour round trip and in with a 40-minute one for a 
Yorkshire shred!

 A few minutes out of Halifax the road felt like Narnia. 
Wednesday was grey and wet in Leeds, but we set off for Ogden at midday. Even 
in Halifax there was little snow, but the road to Another World climbs a proper 
Yorkshire mountain, so after a few miles we had been transported from 
industrial West Yorkshire to Narnia. It looked like an alpine powder day! 
Fortunately, the turning into Moss Farm is directly off an A-road and the lane 
is kept clear using a tractor, so access wasn’t a problem. We pulled up outside 
the farmhouse and could immediately see a rope tow.

Another World is a family business with a background story that neatly 
describes the history of snow sports in the UK. The house and land is owned by 
Ralph Smith, a nurseryman and old-school skier. He built the first outdoor rope 
tow in England, here at Moss Farm, in 1985. His son, Andrew, got into 
snowboarding in the late 1980s and developed and expanded the ski area. Then, 
with his own son, Alex, built the boardercross and jump courses (which are used 
primarily by mountain boarders in the summer), and added other activities to 
make a year-round, all-conditions outdoor pursuits centre.

We all had our own kit, so we paid just £15 a head for up to four hours on the 
hill: twice the time for half the cost of an indoor snow dome. Conditions were 
almost perfect, with virtually no wind and around 15cm of fresh snow. We rode 
the nursery rope tow a few times, sent it down the boardercross course and then 
went into the far field to ride the other rope tow. Half way up, it stopped. I 
thought we had broken it until Alex appeared with a watering can that he used 
to fill the engine running the rope with red diesel, and off we went again.

We spent several hours on the slopes that afternoon and were so stoked that we 
gave Alex a snowboard in return for a free shred on the Friday, when we rode 
again until the snow got too wet and slow. A Norwegian friend once told me that 
the thing he liked most about riding in Oslo was going home for dinner and 
sleeping in his own bed. He is right.

Another World also boasts a bar/chalet/shed with hot drinks, booze, and comfy 
seating next to a wood-burner, so you can finish the day properly. In short, 
it’s a belting day out.
