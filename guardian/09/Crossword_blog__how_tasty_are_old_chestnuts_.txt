What is it, to be a crossword solver?

It is, we learn 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/21/crossword-solvers-dont-like-words-and-are-usually-scientists-res/>
, to pursue something with “no real point”. Certainly, it’s to take part in a 
game that, as often as not, leaves no benefit other thanfiring some unexpected 
connections

 and enjoying the sensation.

It helps, though, if they actually are unexpected.


Back in March 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/mar/07/the-great-us-crossword-plagiarism-mystery>
, we looked at how USA Today’s crosswords were showinga mathematically 
startling similarity 
<http://www.slate.com/articles/life/gaming/2016/03/how_to_spot_a_plagiarized_crossword.html>
 to those previously published in the New York Times. “To me,” suggested the 
man in charge of the deja-vu puzzles, “it’s just mere coincidence”.


Well, the coppers have not been called. More quietly, the man in charge has 
been toldhe will no longer be editing USA Today’s puzzle 
<http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/timothy-parker-out-as-editor-of-usa-todaygannett-crossword/>
, although his services are retained by the press syndicate that supplies 
various publications with their challenges.


Whatever the paper, it appears, there’s a sense that solvers would prefer to 
go into battle believing that today’s puzzle is a new challenge – a fresh and 
authored combination of linguistic ambiguity and coincidence, concocted for 
that day and that paper’s readership alone. Amen.


All this is as it should be. 


Let’s look, then, at something different. On this side of the Atlantic, for 
reasons we’ve seen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/mar/07/the-great-us-crossword-plagiarism-mystery>
, deja vu is more usually down to some irresistible anagram occurring 
independently to one setter once and other another time.


But, solver, what’s the difference between wearily spotting another demand 
that you make a “knackered carthorse” into an ORCHESTRA, and excitedly feeling 
that you’ve been fooled once before by some trick from another solver and are 
this time ahead of the game?

Put another way: what makes a gnarly old chestnut tasty, and when does it 
leave a stale tang?
