“Don’t worry, I’ll be back by lunch.” Those were the last words of a Scottish 
teacher who wasmurdered at Auschwitz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust> for protecting Jewish 
schoolgirls, as revealed by the students who watched her being taken away to 
her death.

Jane Haining <http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/haining.asp> 
was a missionary at a Church of Scotland-run school in Budapest when she was 
arrested by the Gestapo in 1944, having repeatedly refused to leave Hungary 
because she wanted to stay with her pupils. The frightened schoolgirls who 
watched her led away never saw her again.

Haining died at the concentration camp later that year at the age of 47. She 
is the only Scot to be honoured as “righteous among the nations” – the term 
used for non-Jews who risked their lives to protect Jews from extermination – 
by theYad Vashem Holocaust memorial centre <http://www.yadvashem.org/> in 
Jerusalem.

At a memorial event in Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/world/hungary> 
this week, a group of the missionary’s former pupils recalled her brave efforts 
to protect them. Within hours of Haining’s arrest, concerned fellow teachers 
sent many of the girls back to their families, while some Jewish students were 
dispersed, hidden and given new names for their protection.

Agnes Rostas, now 80, was among the group of distraught primary school 
children who looked on as secret police arrested Haining on eight charges, 
including working among Jews, listening to news broadcasts on the BBC and 
sending parcels to British prisoners of war.

She said: “On the morning of that day, German officers were visiting Miss 
Haining and from our bedroom window across the hall we could see her room. 

“After hours of questioning we could see that the two officers were taking her 
away and as they were going down one set of stairs, we hurried to another set 
to follow them down.

“We were sitting at the foot of the stairs crying and she looked back and said 
to us, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back by lunch.’ That was the last time I saw her 
and I found out 40 years later she had died in Auschwitz.”

Eight other former students, aged between 80 and 91, were also present at the 
event. Another pupil, Judit Beck, now 87, was also taken to Auschwitz and was 
the only family member to survive.

Earlier this month, an archive of the murdered woman’s papers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/jane-haining-scotland-will-auschwitz-jewish-girls-holocaust-nazis-budapest>
, including her will and photographs with her students, was discovered in the 
attic of the Church of Scotland’s World Mission Council.

 Jane Haining’s ‘girls’ remember their heroine, 72 years on. 
Also among the documents was a report by a Hungarian bishop, László Ravasz, 
who later reported that “her superiors three times ordered her home, but she 
always replied that the Hungarian people were so true-hearted, honourable and 
chivalrous that among them not a hair on her head would be touched. ‘I shall 
continue to do my duty,’ she declared, ‘and stick to my post.’”

Haining, who moved to Budapest in the early 1930s to work as a matron in the 
church-run school, had been on holiday in Cornwall during the outbreak of war 
in September 1939, but chose to return to her 315 students, many of whom were 
from the city’s growing Jewish population.

“If these children need me in days of sunshine, how much more do they need me 
in days of darkness?” she wrote.

The Rev Ian Alexander, secretary of the World Mission Council, was one of 26 
Church ofScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> ministers and 
members to attend this week’s event in Budapest, which also marked 175 years of 
the church’s mission in the city. He told the Guardian it was “phenomenal” to 
meet Haining’s former pupils “and to hear these hair-raising stories of life at 
the last minutes before her arrest.

“Much of their story was of the normality of the mission up until [her arrest 
in] 1944. It was almost like a haven.” He said one of the elderly women had 
told him Haining had helped the Jewish children to sew their yellow stars onto 
their clothing, but had cried when she saw them wearing them. “She made them 
take it off so they were all the same. One woman said she didn’t know who was 
Jewish and who was Christian.”

“You cannot have anything other than tremendous awe for her commitment to the 
girls and to the school,” added Alexander. “It’s an absolutely phenomenal story 
of dedication and commitment.”
