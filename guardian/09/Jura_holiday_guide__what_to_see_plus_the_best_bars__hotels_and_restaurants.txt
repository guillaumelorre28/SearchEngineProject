If it is still possible for France to have an undiscovered region, the Jura 
can lay a serious claim, as the lush valleys, thick forests, lakes and 
mountains of this rural landscape are still very much off the beaten track, 
even for the French. I should know – my wife comes from around there. After 
many years spending the sacred month of August on family holidays, I can highly 
recommend it as a destination to enjoy both the great French pursuits of eating 
and drinking, plus relaxed biking, hiking, sailing and fishing.

Squeezed between Burgundy, Alsace and the Swiss border, the Jura has no big 
industrial cities, no famous sights and an economy that essentially revolves 
around producing outstanding cheese and wine. The market towns of Arbois and 
Poligny are the foodie capitals, and here you can visit a traditional fruitière 
– nothing to do with fruit, but a co-operative for making wine and cheese, 
especially delicious comté.

The Jura is tiny, compared with many of France’s better-known regions, and its 
countryside rapidly transforms from rural medieval hamlets, surrounded by 
grazing cows and rolling vineyards, to dramatic Alpine scenery and family ski 
stations, such as Les Rousses. And for those who come to spend more than just a 
lazy weekend, there is even theGrandes Traversées du Jura 
<http://www.gtj.asso.fr>, 300km of trails that can be followed on foot, 
horseback and mountain bike in spring and summer, or on cross-country skis in 
winter.

What to do

Winemaker villages

 Photograph: Jura Tourisme 
Winemaking in the Jura is still practised on a human scale, with small, mainly 
organic vineyards run by enthusiastic youngvignerons who welcome anyone passing 
by to taste their very distinctive wines. Create your own wine route through 
the bucolic villages from Arbois down to Revermont, but be sure to visit 
Château-Chalon, precariously perched on a clifftop, and Arlay, with its 
imposing chateau. It’s worth planning a trip at the end of January when these 
villages take it in turns to hostLa Percée du Vin Jaune 
<http://www.percee-du-vin-jaune.com>, a riotous festival celebrated by 35,000 
people to unveil the new vintage of straw-yellow local tipple –vin jaune.


Les Salines de Salins
Don’t bother with the nondescript spa town of Salins-les-Bains, but be sure to 
visit the Unesco-listed maze of vast underground caverns and galleries, where 
salt has been mined in frightening conditions for 1,200 years. It’s amazing to 
learn that the search for “white gold” only ended 50 years ago.

La Maison de la Vache Qui Rit

In the centre of Lons-le-Saunier, capital of the Jura, this brilliant modern 
museum is irresistible for kids – and for anyone interested in food and design. 
Dedicated to Laughing Cow, France’s famous processed cheese, the interactive 
museum has a wonderful collection of posters and advertising, dating back to 
1921.

Pays des Lacs
The Jura’s own lake district, in the Petite Montagne nature reserve, is 
perfect for biking and rambling, swimming and fishing. Within an hour’s drive 
are the wild ice-age lakes of Bonlieu and Narlay, the 60-metre-high Hérisson 
waterfalls, and the sandy beaches and turquoise waters of Lac de Chalain.

Poligny’s town square is dotted with dairies and wine bars offering tastes of 
their famousvins et fromages, and both feature prominently on the menu of the 
casual Sergenterie restaurant. Steep stairs lead to a 17th-century vaulted 
cellar, a comfortable locale for a relaxed and lengthy meal ofcuisine de terroir

comté sauce, orrösti with juicy morteau sausage smothered with hot 
cancoillotte, a naturally runny, low-fat cheese.

Le Grapiot, Pupillin 
With its stunning avant garde wooden exterior, the Grapiot is quite a shock in 
this sleepy vineyard village, and the innovative cuisine of talented young chef 
Samuel Richardet is even more of a surprise. The five-course tasting menu at 
€50 (€60 with wine pairing) is brilliant value and might include trout sushi 
stuffed with fresh goat’s cheese, slow-cooked saddle of rabbit, and chocolate 
“spring rolls” with a tangy lychee sorbet.

Le Bistrot des Terrasses, Plaisia
It is not easy to find this bright, modern wooden chalet, off a narrow country 
road near the Jura lake district. But young, dynamic owners Isabelle and Eric 
Giudici – who only opened two years ago – have won a faithful following with 
their enthusiasm for healthy zero-carbon food, sourced solely from surrounding 
farms. The menu features locally fished trout, organic seasonal vegetables and 
morbier, comté and goat’s cheeses from the village fruitière.

two-Michelin-star chefJean-Paul Jeunet’s eponymous gastronomic temple 
<http://www.jeanpauljeunet.com/fr/index.php>. For a more rustic experience, 
there’sLa Finette <http://www.finette.fr/fr/restaurant-la-finette/>, a tavern 
specialising in succulent chicken braised in vin jaune, cream and morels. But 
the best deal in town is at the delightfully retro Claquets, serving genuine
cuisine du marché (market cooking). A self-service buffet of healthy starters, 
such as lentil salad and carrot and lemon terrine, is followed by aplat du jour 
and homemade fruit tart for dessert.

Maison des Vins, L’Etoile

L’Etoile is tucked away at the foot of an idyllic valley lined with vineyards, 
but visitors tend to pass over the Maison des Vins because it looks like a 
tacky, modern convenience store. Inside, though, the bar is always buzzing, as 
this is the village’s favourite watering hole. More than a wine bar, it stocks 
local artisan beer Rouget de Lisle, a craft cider, and lethal fruit brandies.

Authentic village bistrots like this one are disappearing fast but la patronne 
here, Madame Dédé, makes sure nothing changes, from her vintage table football 
to the battered leather sofa, rickety oak tables – where villagers like to sit 
and discuss their wine production – and the all-important summer pétanque 
competition she organises.

Le Bistrot de la Tournelle, Arbois

Each summer, the crowds get bigger at Arbois. From 20 June to the end of 
August, eco-vignerons Evelyne and Pascal Clairet transform their waterside 
garden into what the French call aguinguette, a lively outdoor cafe where they 
serve their excellent organic wines, alongside specialities from Jura food 
producers. Each afternoon turns into a long, lazy picnic.
