I first went to Breckenridge with the British ski team five years ago and 
discoveredCuppa Joe 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cuppa-Joe-Breckenridge/239439926067220> about 
two years ago.

Breckenridge is a quaint town with trendy shops and good cafes. But Cuppa Joe 
stands out for me. It’s a cosy place a little off the beaten track with a 
friendly local vibe. And the food is outstanding. My top tip is to order the 
sweet potato burrito for breakfast. It’s huge. Eat half and then wrap up the 
other half and take it up the mountain for lunch. If you eat the whole thing 
for breakfast there is no way you will be able to move. Also grab a smoothie – 
with all fresh ingredients, it’s the bomb, and the perfect breakfast for a day 
on the mountain.

Breckenridge has one of the best freestyle parks in the world, so there is no 
chance you are not going to eat that second half of the burrito following a 
morning on the mountain. There is also a giant freestyle academy that you can 
use for reduced-risk training, with trampolines and foam pits, which take the 
edge off trying that new trick.
