What is the seven-letter name of James Bond’s ailurophile nemesis?

Sometimes an answer – whether it has been clued concisely or cryptically – 
refuses to come to mind. There is, we should all agree, little honour or 
satisfaction in leaving a crossword grid only partly filled. But if the brain 
can’t do it, how are those squares going to get the right letters?

One Staffordshire solver thought that she had the answer when she didn’t have 
the answer:she rang her local council to see if they could help 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/31/bake-off-bond-quirky-queries-council-call-centres>
.

This is not like those “he called 999 to order a pizza” stories: we can be 
proud that enough civic spirit remains that ratepayers (as we were once termed) 
think of their council as an institution that’s happy to help (and, if you 
enjoyed the other queries in the linked-to piece, you should spend a day at the 
BBC’s switchboard).

Crossword Blog has attained a recording of the conversation and offers it here 
in the hope that the advice might be more generally applicable.

Helper: You’re through to Staffordshire County Council. How may I help you 
today?

Solver: Well, they said “press one for this” and “press two for that”, but my 
question wasn’t covered by any of the options.

Helper: If it’s to do with closing down the libraries, that’s option three, 
Big Society.

Solver: No, it’s to do with the crossword. 

Helper: Can I stop you there, caller? I don’t want to just give you the 
answer. It’s always more satisfying to find it for yourself.

Solver: But I don’t want to look it up – that’s cheating.

Helper: You really think so, caller? Listen, it was the former New York Times 
puzzle editor Will Weng, I think, who used to say:“It’s your puzzle. Solve it 
any way you want.” <http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/08/magazine/08PUZZLE.html>

Solver: OK: well, what I want is to get it without looking it up. Plus I can’t 
use the Leslie Halliwell in the library because there isn’t one. I’m not 
blaming you.


Helper: Understood on both counts. And does that include using services like 
One Across <http://oneacross.com/> or the “wildcard” function in apps like 
Chambers Dictionary? I ask because sometimes the answer comes to you just as 
you’re on the point of being given it by the machine.

Solver: I know exactly what you mean: when you realise that you didn’t know 
you knew it.

Helper: Just that moment, yes, caller. Wonderful, isn’t it? So perhaps you 
could try ...

Solver: It is. But, yes, I don’t want to use those today. Too cold. 

Helper: How about a middle ground? A solvers’ blog might do the job. There’s 
Big Dave <http://bigdave44.com/introduction/about/> for the Telegraph, Times 
for the Times <http://times-xwd-times.livejournal.com/profile> ...

Solver: ... for the Times ...

Helper: ... Yes, for the Times, and Fifteensquared 
<http://www.fifteensquared.net/about-2/> for the other cryptics. They’ll tell 
you a little more than just the answer: how the wordplay works, say, which I 
find makes me a better solver for the next puzzle. It’s like the “cheat” 
function combined with anannotated solution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/prize-crossword-annotated-solutions>
 and anAzed slip 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2015/aug/07/azed-slip-no-2250>.

Solver: Those are all fine blogs, but I really do prefer the personal touch 
for this clue.

Helper: A lot of people do. I mean, a lot of couples like to solve together. 
Did you readthat thing last week about that Canadian chap who got his favourite 
paper to sneak a hidden marriage proposal into their crossword 
<http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1311525-lovestruck-bridgewater-man-proposes-by-crossword-puzzle>
?

Solver: I did, but those proposal puzzles aren’t exactly rare occurrences now, 
are they? There was evenone in a British paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/jun/22/crossword-roundup-an-unusual-proposition-from-the-times>
 this year.

Helper: So do you solve with your husband, if you have one?

Solver: What a daft question. Of course I’ve got a husband. I don’t solve with 
him, though. He’s a nincompoop. That’s why I always ask my daughter.

[Pause.]

Helper: It’s Blofeld, mum.
