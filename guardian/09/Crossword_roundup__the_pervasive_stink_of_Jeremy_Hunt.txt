The news in clues

June 2006, and the shadow leader of the House has some fun with Jack Straw 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060629/debtext/60629-0004.htm>
:

May I congratulate the leader of the House on the signal distinction of being 
the answer to 10 across in the crossword in the Daily Telegraph yesterday? The 
clue however was ‘Foreign Secretary no longer clutches at it’, which may be a 
description of his performance.

For non-political celebrities, being the answer to a crossword clue is 
typically a source of ring-your-mum pride: the setter, after all, believes that 
what you – your name and what you do – is as familiar to solvers as the words 
in the dictionary.

This is less often the case for politicians. Setters are rarely roused to 
construct a puzzle around political figures they admire; maybe it’s a shame 
that there aren’t more puzzles such as the oneAraucaria

 created to mark South Africa’s first democratic elections intribute to Ruth 
First, Steve Biko and Chris Hani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/25/features.weekend>. If you’re in 
politics, it ispossible for you to appear in an arcane and affecting accolade.

More often, it’s because you’re a git.

And the tendency towards celebrity pride doesn’t always hold either, which is 
all that you or I shall say aboutKnut’s recent themed puzzle in the Independent

:

6d Enjoy a furore very much (4,5)
[ synonym for ‘enjoy’ + synonym for ‘a furore’ ]
[ LIKE + STINK ]

LIKE STINK is one of those nifty – or niffy – expressions whose origin (a 
German term for a bad smell) is wholly unnecessary to understand its meaning in 
context: if you run like stink, you’re running fast; if it rains like stink, 
there’s plenty of water, and so graspably on. The New Partridge Dictionary of 
Slang and Unconventional English (J-Z) listsSam Wollaston’s review in these 
pages of a Ducati vehicle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/sep/10/motoring> as a case in 
point:

This bike goes like stink and handles like a dream.

Our next challenge involves a possible mutation of this fine old image. 
Reader, how would you clue LIKE STINK ON A PIG?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for SYMBLOMATIC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/may/16/crossword-roundup-cryptic-obituaries>
 and my apologies for demanding clues for, well, a non-word. Hats off to 
everyone who alluded to the neologistic demagogue in the interest of fairness, 
especially the twin tonsorial whammies of DameSweeneyEggblast’s “My A-list 
comb-over – created by Donald Trump” and GeoScanner’s “Smooth your mysterious 
barnet – Leaders ostensibly marvel at Trump’s incoherent construction”.

The runners-up are Chrisbeee, who valiantly concocted “Original sayings you 
must ban: list of muddled adjectives Trump inadvertently coined” and Robi23, 
who almost hinted at the impossible definition with “Trumpery claim by most 
aggrieved”; the winner is ComedyPseudonym’s elaborate “Crazy campaigner with 
batty neologism; unexpected generation gap eliminated representative”.

Kudos to Comedy; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
