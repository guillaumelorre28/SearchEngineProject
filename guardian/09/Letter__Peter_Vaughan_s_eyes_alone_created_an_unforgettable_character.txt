May I add to the record of Peter Vaughan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/06/peter-vaughan-obituary>’s 
unforgettable stage villainy his portrayal of Schmitz in Ronald Eyre’s 
production of Max Frisch’s The Fire Raisers on BBC television in December 1963? 
I can see his eyes now, 53 years on.
