The history of crosswords is one where they become less and less like quizzes.

The puzzle began as a test of knowledge rather than of wordplay. The solver of 
the first crossword 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/08/celebrating-100-years-crossword>
, published in the New York World newspaper in 1913, needed a spot of Russian 
geography, some familiarity with aromatic plants and the term for “the fiber of 
the gomuti palm”.


When British broadsheets began to dabble with the form, they added elements 
such as literary quotations and wordplay. As today’s solvers know, only one of 
those persisted. Today’s cryptics will not ask you to recall the word missing 
from a line plucked out of Horace’s Odes – and they’re all the better for it.

Indeed, some of the best cryptics operate as abstract exercises, floating 
serenely above the world of facts. The answers might be pieces of language so 
simple and straightforward that the most accessible daytime quiz show would 
consider them a bit easy, but disguised with enough cryptic ingenuity to make 
their recovery a challenge. Nowadays, the general-knowledge crossword, as found 
in Prospect magazine and this paper’s Weekend magazine, comes across as an 
entirely different beast.

There’s still an overlap, if not in the content of these two very different 
pastimes, then in their devotees. Disclosure: when I’m not thinking about 
crosswords here, I can be found editing the questions for the BBC quiz showOnly 
Connect <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lskhg>.

So I took keener interest than probably anyone else in the appearance last 
Thursday ofa puzzle <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26517> by 
Tramp (interviewed here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/dec/01/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-tramp>
) with clues such as this ...

6d Look, the woman’s following Only Connect’s introduction (8)
[ synonym for “the woman’s” after synonym for “but” + first letter of 
“Connect” ]
[ HERS after BUT + C ]

... for BUTCHERS, celebrating as it does that same show and its host, Victoria 
Coren Mitchell <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/victoriacoren>. It’s a 
witty, inventive challenge whichyou should go to now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26517> if you haven’t solved it 
already – and it isn’t even the first Connect-themed challenge I’ve encountered.

Earlier this year, the New Statesman announced its theme with “Quiz inspired 
by Forster? (4, 7)” and included in its answers the show’s Egyptian hieroglyphs 
(a graphical device which followed a complaint that the show’s previous use of 
Greek letters was too recherche). And you’re also directed tothe crossword 
magazine Magpie <http://www.piemag.com/2013/08/12/ro-od-only-connect/>, and a 
Listener puzzle by The Tall’n 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/30a26c9646be285a0148405799390130/play_ni>
 for increasingly, um, involved, variations on this theme.

(Without wanting to give much away, Columba’s wonderful recent Spectator puzzle
 <http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/crossword/9420352/2195-in-question/> is 
relevant here too.)

 Dave Tilley answers questions about crosswords on Mastermind 
Factor in the sterling performances by self-declared crossworders on Only 
Connect and other programmes, and the inventive quizzes devised by setters such 
asEnigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/13/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-enigmatist>
, and you’re forced to ponder these activities – remembering names and numbers, 
usually at speed and unlocking encrypted language, often at a leisurely pace – 
and bundle them together.

What about you? I presume anyone reading this has at least a casual interest 
in crosswords. Do any of you hate quizzes? Are any of you prepared to admit to 
being terrible at them, but a dab hand at wordplay?

And to those who love both: is the “hit” the same, or are they complementary 
addictions?

Or is it merely that both lend themselves well to the pub?
