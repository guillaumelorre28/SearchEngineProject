You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point 
of view ... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.

You can choose your friends but you sho’ can’t choose your family, an’ they’re 
still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge ‘em or not, and it makes you 
look right silly when you don’t.

Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I’d have the facts.

Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love 
breathing.

Things are never as bad as they seem.

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin 
to kill a mockingbird.

I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that 
courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It’s when you know you’re licked 
before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.

People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.

The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.

I think there’s just one kind of folks. Folks.
