Chalet Sonne, Maria Alm, Austria

The Hochking ski circuit is 150km of trails linking five villages with 
generous helpings of green and blue runs, as well as some steeper stuff for 
those of stronger thigh. Chalet Sonne is in Maria Alm, 300 metres from the 
nursery slopes and a ski bus service taking you to the nearest high-speed 
gondola. The chalet is wood and a bit more wood, with a table tennis table, a 
sauna, plus two double rooms, a triple and a quad.

Chalet Vallon Blanc, La Tania, France

Part of the mammoth Trois Vallées ski area, La Tania can easily be overlooked 
as you swing from the expensive heights ofCourchevel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jan/19/courchevel-france-children-family-skiing-holiday>
 to the boutique luxe of Meribel. But it is possible to enjoy the terrain 
without selling your soul. Chalet Vallon Blanc is cute, cosy and has a sauna. 
Its interior design won’t blow your mind but it is situated among the trees and 
benefits from a lot of light, giving a sense of airiness. There’s also a games 
room and a wood-burning stove for all your “I’m in a Wham video on a budget” 
fantasies.

Rude Lodge, Morzine, France

Morzine already has a reputation as a resort that embraces snowboarding and 
snowboarding culture, so it was only a matter of time before a boarders’ lodge 
opened above a newly revamped nightclub. Both are owned by Rude Chalets, 
purveyor of funky and stylish snowboarding accommodation and holidays since 
2002. Accommodation is in dorms or twins, there’s a cafe for breakfast and 
dinner, a communal lounge area, a movie and media centre and free access to the 
club,Le Paradis <http://www.discotheque-morzine.com/>, for all guests. Which 
will either go horribly right or horribly wrong – probably depending on your 
age.

Le Petit Hotel, Zermatt, Switzerland

Finding budget accommodation in Switzerland isn’t easy at the best of times 
and recent changes to the national minimum wage look set to make it harder. 
However, Le Petit Hotel (and some of the rooms are indeed petite) is good value 
and minutes from the centre of Zermatt, a town not known for being light on the 
wallet. It’s a no-frills establishment but prices include breakfast and views 
of the Matterhorn. Zermatt is car-free so it helps on the luggage front that Le 
Petit Hotel is a very short hop from the station.

Chalet Bianca, Bardonecchia, Italy

Chalet holidays aren’t the norm in Italy, where accommodation tends to be in 
hotels or self-catering apartments. Sempre Ski, however, offers a great- value 
half-board chalet stay in the mellow resort of Bardonecchia, which has 140km of 
pistes itself and is close to a number of other resorts. The chalet is 
brightly, some would say uniquely, decorated, sleeping up to 18 guests – and 
staff are full of Italian lust for life.

It does take something of a leap of faith to let a stranger stay in your 
house, but then you’ll be staying in theirs at the same time and when you knock 
out the cost of accommodation, suddenly a ski trip can becomes more affordable. 
Homeexchange.com is one of a few websites where you can swap your home with 
someone who, presumably, has much better mountain views. Sign up, list your 
house, search for your preferred ski town and arrange a swap. It’s a great way 
to not only save money but really get a feel for what life is like as a local.

Hucksters Lodge, Vallandry, France

By dispensing with things such as towels and complimentary toiletries (bring 
your own) and guaranteed en suite bathrooms, Hucksters has managed to create 
accommodation that is definitely communal and cheap but in that no-frills way 
that makes you feel pretty smug at the money you are saving. It has lodges in 
four resorts, and itsw Mont Blanc lodge in Vallandry, close to Les Arcs, sits 
right next to the piste. With a large lounge area where groups can mix, the 
atmosphere is friendly and laid-back without being manic.

Possibly the best motel in the ski world? The Rossland Motel gives you access 
to Red Mountain, a place where the terrain is spectacular for powder and 
off-piste but where the temperatures can fall so low your face feels like it’s 
on fire. Luckily, the Rossland Motel has boot warmers in every room as well 
locally roasted organic coffee (Rossland takes its coffee very seriously), an 
outdoor hot tub and an external living space with firepit so you can always 
warm up and dry off on your return. The on-site ski wax room and storage means 
you’ll always be prepared for round two. Or three. Or four … For the 2014/15 
season there are also free shuttles to the ski area, which is 4km away.

Owashi Lodge, Niseko, Japan

means you spend your nights listening to 11 other people snore, Owashi Lodge is 
a great place to conserve your pennies in pricey Japan. You’re within 
whispering distance of the lift, allowing quick access to Niseko’s legendary 
powder, and the lodge will help arrange guidin. A large communal kitchen, games

Chalet Martina, Westendorf, Austria

It’s a big chalet (sleeping 26) in a small Austrian skiing village, but Chalet 
Martina has great access to the 279km of piste of the Brixental-Kitzbüheler 
Alpen region – which includes the resorts of Söll and Elmau. The chalet itself 
isn’t going to win any design awards – there is a lot of pine – and there 
aren’t any frills to speak of but you’re close to some happy après-ski and its 
proximity toInnsbruck 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/dec/20/a-day-in-innsbruck-austria> 
makes it easy to get to.
