Cheers for Fighters’ and A.A. Successes
German bombers and escorting fighters were sent crashing yesterday in fierce 
air fighting over the South-east and the London area during two daylight raids. 
Londoners saw them falling at Victoria, Kennington, and Streatham. In the first 
attack, which developed at noon, at least fifty planes were zooming in battle 
high overLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>. Thousands in the 
centre of the capital cheered wildly as they watched the Spitfires send a big 
German bomber hurtling to destruction. Roof-watchers reported that they saw 
fragments of one or two raiders, blown to pieces apparently by A.A. fire.

As the fight went on at least three Nazis were seen to “bale out” and descend 
in the inner London area. One who drifted down in a London suburb was watched 
by a large crowd. When soldiers had taken him away men and women tore his 
parachute to pieces – for souvenirs.


Another Nazi airman who landed near a small police station had his arms 
outstretched and was shouting, “Kamerad, kamerad.” He could speak little 
English, but he repeatedly murmured to the police and soldiers who formed a 
cordon round him, “I am an officer.” He had been wounded in the battle and was 
taken to hospital.

CROWDS CHEER
As one raider, aided by cloud-banks, wormed its way over Central London a 
fierce A.A. barrage opened up, but ceased as the clouds drifted away. Then a 
flight of six Spitfires were seen. One attacked the Nazi plane, which, like a 
sitting bird, seemed incapable of attempting escape. The Spitfire poured a 
deadly lead stream into the raider and it spiralled down, smoke pouring from 
its tail. The Spitfire rolled victoriously and the crowds below cheered madly 
and danced with joy as the bomber fell.

One eye-witness of the dog fights said: “I saw a Spitfire attack a formation 
of enemy bombers. The fighter fastened on to one of the enemy and fought a hot 
duel. Presently the German began to leave a trail of black smoke behind him. 
One of the crew ‘baled out’ and then the bomber went into a steep dive and 
burst into flames. Suddenly it broke into a thousand pieces in mid-air.”


About a dozen high-explosive bombs dropped in one south-western suburb, 
considerably damaging house and shop property, bursting gas mains, and starting 
small fires, but there were no serious casualties. Some casualties, at least 
one of them fatal, were caused by half a dozen high-explosive bombs dropped in 
another part of the same district. Several shops, a public-house, and some 
private houses were demolished. A bomb which exploded in another residential 
area made a number of houses uninhabitable and caused some fatal casualties.

THE SECOND ATTACK
It took our fighters and guns just over an hour to clear the skies, and the 
‘‘All clear’’ sounded at 12 56 p.m. But at 2 15 the sirens wailed again, and a 
few minutes later the heavy drone of the German bombers could again be heard in 
the London area.

Again our fighters roared up and ripped into the enemy formations, their guns 
blazing. One watcher said, “Two planes certainly came down and I saw one 
parachutist descending.”


About 400 German planes are believed to have crossed the East Coast heading 
for London. At one point in South-east England 36 German planes flew over in 
formations of six and were immediately engaged by A.A. guns.

The first two squadrons broke up. One of the planes dived to earth and two 
parachutes floated down after the crew had “baled out.” Two planes from another 
squadron, surrounded by bursting shells, were also seen to fall to the ground, 
evidently as the result of A.A. fire. A German bomber which dropped two bombs 
in a London district made a forced landing and burst into flames. The clouds 
were low at the time, and the presence of the machine was first indicated by 
two falling bombs. Shortly afterwards the bomber – a large black machine – 
appeared from the clouds, flew in a slow half-circle, and dived straight to the 
ground. A few seconds later it burst into flames. Immediately after other 
German aircraft dropped bombs in the same neighbourhood.

 Manchester Guardian, 16 September 1940. 
Just before the German bomber crashed A.A. guns had put up an intense barrage, 
but it was not known whether the machine fell to the anti-aircraft gunners or 
to Spitfires, which had been wheeling round.


BRITISH PILOT “BALES OUT” AFTER A VICTORY
One British sergeant pilot “baled out” over a London district and landed at 
the back of a house where a pressman has his home. He told the reporter, “I 
managed to get him before they got me.”

The reporter introduced himself and shook hands. The airman exclaimed: “I am a 
pressman, too, in civil life. Tell my father I am all right. He is your 
correspondent at —’’ [naming a famous seaport city].


The airman telephoned to his home aerodrome, and when he emerged into the 
street a great cheer went up from the crowd, many of whom rushed forward to 
shake him by the hand.


The machine which the sergeant pilot is believed to have shot down was a 
bomber, which watchers saw falling to pieces in the air. The two wings were 
seen floating down separately. Seconds afterwards the fuselage followed the 
wings, descending surprisingly slowly in the same direction. The wreckage was 
strewn over an area of about two hundred yards. The fuselage burst into flames, 
but there was no explosion. During the fight a number of parachutes were seen 
descending some distance away.
