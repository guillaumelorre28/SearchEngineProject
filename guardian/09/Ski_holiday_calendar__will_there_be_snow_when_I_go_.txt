In these troubled climatic times, skiers and snowboarders can no longer rely 
on adequate snow cover throughout the season. So planning is vital. In 
particular, anyone arranging an early or late holiday should choose somewhere 
at high altitude, then even if there’s insufficient natural stuff, the sub-zero 
temperatures – at least at night – should ensure that artificial snowmaking can 
take place.
• Prices below are per person for one week, including half-board, flights and 
transfers, unless stated otherwise

DECEMBER AND CHRISTMAS

For a trip in early December, pick a high-altitude destination with a glacier 
– just to be certain. Over the holiday period there should ideally be a white 
Christmas at village level, too. Go for a resort that’s over 1,800 metres high 
and snow cover won’t be a worry.

Val Thorens, France, 2,300-3,230m, 169 lifts, 495km of piste, glacier

 Val Thorens, France, from Montagnes. 
From late November to early May, snow cover is rarely a problem in Val Thorens 
– it’s the highest ski village in Europe, with 99% of it above 2,000m. The 
excellent choice of independent ski schools here includes New Generation (
skinewgen.com <http://www.skinewgen.com/ski-schools/val-thorens/>). The resort 
has benefitted from new, attractive buildings, and a great collection of 
restaurants.

Val d’Isère is one of the Alps’ best-known resorts, which means it’s not the 
cheapest. But this is the one place that has plenty of snow at Christmas – 
especially as it has the largest snowmaking operation in Europe. It can pump 
out enough snow to cover Wembley stadium in a metre of snow in less than an 
hour.
• £710pp in traditional Chalet La Moraine (sleeps 12) on 18 December (or 
£950pp starting 26 December), travel extra. The chalet is in the farming hamlet

 Obergurgl, Austria. Photograph: HORAK 
Obergurgl has been popular with British families for more than half a century, 
with a mainly easy ski area linked by gondola to the higher village of 
Hochgurgl. The climate is snow-sure, so this is one of the first major resorts 
to open for the winter, normally in mid-November.
• £2,499pp (£625pp) for a family of four (two adults, two children aged two to 
10), staying at Chalet Verwall on 23 December. Extras: nursery £319pp for six

street and has a sauna.espritski.com

JANUARY: LOW-SEASON SKIING


Height isn’t so important in January because there should have been decent 
snowfall by now. It’s low season and therefore the month to find good-value 
holidays and slopes that are much emptier. Temperatures can be low, too, so 
wrap up in plenty of layers.

 La Grange aux Fées, Valmorel. Photograph: Peak Retreats 
This compact village is purpose built, but the centre looks as though it could 
be 100 years old. The attractive wood-and-stone buildings, with their slate 
roofs, are in keeping with the typical style of the Savoie area. There are 
loads of wide and gentle slopes, perfect for beginners and improvers, with 43% 
of the pistes graded blue (easy).

This is a really big ski area with a wide variety of slopes. Austrian resort 
prices are relatively reasonable and Saalbach is also known for its good 
mountain restaurants and lively après-ski. Last season, it linked up with

the biggest ski areas in the country.

Champoluc has a real mountain-village atmosphere – you won’t spot any glitzy 
boutiques or expensive restaurants here, or crowds. The Ski 2 British ski 
school has mainly native English-speaking instructors, so there’s no language 
barrier either.
• From £947 per adult, £420 first child, £320 second child (under 11) in a

FEBRUARY: HIGH SEASON AND HALF-TERM 


Half-term week is the single most expensive time of year to ski. The upside is 
there’s usually plenty of snow.

Les Menuires is a resort usually known as the plain sister of Les Trois 
Vallées but Reberty, one of its satellites, is much more attractive. A handful 
of canny chalet companies base themselves here, a minute’s walk from the blue 
piste running past the village. Dotted between the chalets are some pleasant 
restaurants with sun decks overlooking the piste.
• £1,549 per adult, £1,239 per child at Chalet Imogen (sleeps 13), transfers,

also a mini-boardercross course for little ones, featuring small bumps.

 Chalet Nicole, La Plagne. 
Ten villages make up La Plagne, and many of the high-altitude centres are ski 
in-ski out. Each has its own nursery slope and lots of wide and gentle pistes 
for confidence building. It’s possible to commute up the mountain from the 
hamlets of Les Coches, Montalbert and Champagny. About 70% of the pistes are 
above 2,000m. Plagne 1800 is set below Plagne Centre and, despite its 
traditional-looking chalets, most of the buildings have been built recently. 
Ski Famille has classes for children aged three to 12 and for adults.

MARCH: FOR SPRING SKIING


It’s low season again, so the crowds have gone, prices are lower, and the snow 
should be good – along with some warmer spring days, when there’s ample 
opportunity to sit outside for a long lunch in the sun.

Several villages, each linked to the piste, makes up Serre Chevalier. It’s a 
quiet area with tree-lined slopes that tend to hold their snow well. The 
weather pattern can be quite different from the resorts further north, so there 
may be plenty of snow here when there’s little elsewhere, and vice versa.

which in turn links the St Anton and Lech ski areas. It’s been discussed for 
over half a century and now it’s really happening. As a result, the Arlberg

This is where all three of my children learnt to ski and it was a wonderful 
place to start. The village has virtually no traffic and is very 
family-friendly. Goats and hens may roam around at Easter, but there’s always 
snow high up. Alpe d’Huez built lifts on its glacier – not for summer skiing, 
but to ensure good cover at the start and end of each season. As a result, Alpe 
d’Huez, and the linked village of Vaujany, offer excellent spring skiing.
