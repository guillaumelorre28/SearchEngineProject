St Moritz, Switzerland

Where The ski world has no rival to this resort for the rich and famous. It is 
set around the shores of a beautiful lake that – when frozen – hosts sports 
such as golf, cricket, show-jumping and horse-racing. The skiing isn’t bad 
either. To save money, stay in a small, family-run place rather than one of the 
landmark hotels.

is 350km of piste.

Courchevel, France

 Where To make a stay in the Gallic alternative to St Moritz more affordable, 
you’d normally be advised to steer clear of glittering 1850 and pick one of the 
lower villages, but I’ve found an exception. If you’re driving from the UK stop 
for the basics in one of the valley supermarkets, and for a meal that won’t 
require a second mortgage, take the bus down to Courchevel Moriond or Le Praz.
