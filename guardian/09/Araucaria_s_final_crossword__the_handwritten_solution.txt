himself? AsGuardian crossword editor Hugh Stephenson

If you fancy a further challenge, Philistine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jan/31/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-philistine>
 – the friend who completed the puzzle – says that one of the solutions fits 
the “25” theme, but is not clued in that way. “I decided to keep the non-themed 
clue, he says, “as I felt it was the most Araucarian of the lot.”

But which is it?

Finally, a mention for 1 Across, the monthly crossword magazine co-founded by 
Araucaria in 1984. Full details and a sample issue are available by sending a 
C5 SAE to 1 Across, The Old Chapel, Middleton Tyas, Richmond, North Yorkshire 
DL10 6PP.

The results of the most recent clueing competition

 will appear on 8 December.
