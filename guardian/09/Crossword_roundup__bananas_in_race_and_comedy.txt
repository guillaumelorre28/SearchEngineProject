 usingnom de guerre Screw with a puzzle including this clue ...

11ac Cuckoo family in trouble, potentially (6,4)
[ synonym for adj. “cuckoo” + synonym for “family” ]
[ BANANAS + KIN ] 

... for BANANA SKIN. Russell T Davies aside 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/27/channel-4s-cucumber-just-got-brilliant-if-youre-not-watching-start-now>
, the banana doesn’t have as racy a slang life as, say, melons and plums, but 
Screw picks up on a couple of its figurative senses: madness when pluralised 
(as with “go ape”, apparently because of the behaviour of our fellow primates) 
and pratfall peril from the skin.

We also have the derogatory terms about people from the BANANA BELT, such as 
BANANA BOAT and BANANA REPUBLIC. Staying with race, just as OREO and,for John 
Terry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/17/choc-ice-rio-ferdinand-ashley-cole>
, CHOC ICE are used to describe someone deemed to be black on the outside and 
white on the inside, so has the BANANA found itself misused, with Oxford 
summarising matters:

N. Amer. (chiefly Canad.) slang (depreciative). A person of Asian birth or 
descent who subscribes to typically western values and attitudes; an oriental 
person regarded, esp. by other orientals, as adopting or identifying with white 
culture.

The banana is funnier by far when on the stage: the pantomime peel or the 
phrase we’ve inherited from vaudeville. The trouper Phil Silvers tells of an 
old skit in which three comedians competed for two bananas. Then burlesque king 
Harry Steppe (who, the story goes, introduced himself out of job when he showed 
Lou Costello to his then-partner Bud Abbott) took the phrases TOP BANANA and 
SECOND BANANA into more general use. And now the TOP BANANA doesn’t have to be 
a top-billed comedian and can denote any KING PIN or BIG SHOT... which brings 
us to our next challenge. Over toMr Brewer 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/brewer-s-dictionary-of-phrase-and-fable-2.html>
:

The term alludes to the large wigs that in the 17th and 18th centuries 
encumbered the head and shoulders of the aristocracy of England and France. 
They are still worn by the LORD CHANCELLOR, judges and (until 2000) the SPEAKER 
of the HOUSE OF COMMONS.

So, reader: how would you clue BIGWIGGERY?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for GOOGLY 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/feb/23/crossword-roundup-batman-encounters-a-googly#show-all>
. I of course enjoyed the apparent match summaries and snatches of commentary, 
such as SemperFi’s “Goughy would never bowl one; his disgust might give way to 
a snippy leer”, andyknott’s “Hilarity heard after Gatting’s first-ball duck – a 
deceptive delivery” and WoodSmoke “Gazunder on Oval ground? Lolly Yorker’s 
first delivery?”

JollySwagman, by contrast, took us to the world of politics with the down clue 
“Veering sharply to the left Greens leader messes up. ‘Flu essentially, that’s 
why,’ she said”. And Middlebro got Google in early with the amusing “Wrong’un – 
like an internet search engine?”

ID2155366 devised a new way of disguising a spoonerism in “Stick of butter 
spooned into finger bowl” and Neijygof gets the pushing-it audacity award for 
“Gorgeously unsure about how to bowl a maiden over”.

The runner-up is steveran’s off-putting “Reason for duck leg being off?”; the 
cheeky winner is Clueso, playing ball with “Good penetrating ball”.

Kudos to Clueso; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
