The foreign trade boom has sparked a significant uptick in Malta’s 
cross-border activity. Imports and exports have surged from €3,117.2 million 
and €1,959.1 million respectively in 2005 to €6,391 million and €3,736.9 
million in 2014, and managing that growth has required capacity expansion at 
Malta Freeport, which privatised in 2004 and saw ship calls increase from 1,483 
in 2005 to 2,108 in 2014. Throughput (TEUs) rose from 1.32 million to 2.90 
million in same period, powered by a major programme of investment in new 
equipment and yard facilities. Designed to accommodate larger container 
vessels, the programme also increased container stacking capacity and reduced 
vessel turnaround times.

In response, two alliances – the ‘2M’ (Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping 
Company) and ‘Ocean Three’ (CMA CGM, China Shipping Container Lines, and United 
Arab Shipping Company) – named Malta Freeport their main Central Mediterranean 
transhipment hub. And the country has demonstrated a commitment to innovation 
along with investment, as when Transport Malta announced the registration under 
the Malta flag of the MV Barzan, the world’s most environmentally friendly, 
ultra-large container vessel.

Aaron Farrugia, Malta Freeport’s CEO, sees prospects for further growth driven 
by opportunities to deliver added value. For example, many ships that originate 
in the Far East make their first port of call at the island nation, where their 
containers can be discharged and placed on smaller feeders for distribution 
throughout Europe and North Africa.

“We can provide pre-customs clearance, so the moment the container arrives in 
its destination country, it can move out of the port in a couple of minutes,” 
he says. “We can also add value, for example in doing labelling in Arabic for 
goods destined for North Africa, or the certification of Halal food. All these 
things can be done in our free trade zone.” Looking ahead, the ministry for 
economic affairs is doing the preliminary work necessary for Malta to play a 
future role in the bunkering industry.

Malta International Airport (MIA) is experiencing similar growth in passenger 
traffic, and has just experienced its best summer on record, with 1.6 million 
passengers passing through its facilities. The main growth comes from the 
traditional markets of Italy and the UK, although new markets such as 
Switzerland and Poland are also contributing. In total, MIA says it expects to 
see 4.5 million passengers by year-end 2015, up nearly 70 percent since 2005, 
noting that “this is equivalent to over 1,100 Boeing 737 aircraft at full 
capacity.” With these gains comes a rise in international flights: during the 
2015 summer season, Finnair, Jet2, Transaero, Aegean, and SwissAir inaugurated 
service to Malta.

Located 10km south of the Port of Valletta, Malta Freeport has quickly become 
one of Europe’s busiest ports and a bustling transhipment hub for the 
Mediterranean. Aaron Farrugia, CEO of Malta Freeport Corporation, which 
regulates the Freeport zone, is eyeing further expansion.

How will you be able to expand the free trade zone?
We don’t have any space which is presently unoccupied. Malta needs a bigger 
free trade zone where a number of warehouses, a logistics park, and an 
industrial park can be accommodated. Then, of course, you can add ancillary 
services such as an exhibition centre, so a German entrepreneur wanting to 
purchase Chinese machinery can visit this exhibition centre in Malta and 
purchase the goods without having to go to Shanghai. We could add a financial 
centre, a conference centre, a hotel, and all these things together can make 
Malta Europe’s and the Mediterranean’s logistics hub. This would be similar to 
what is happening in Singapore or in Jebel Ali.

This vision is doable. We have a national logistics policy and the government 
is exploring ways to accommodate additional free trade zones and also to make 
use of the potential proximity between the airport and the Freeport. There is 
only six kilometres between the two, so you can have material coming in by ship 
and leaving by air. We need to expand and we need to keep working on this 
challenge.

What further opportunities are you focusing on?
There is a potential in bunkering. The ministry for economic affairs are 
working on that and we might be involved as some sort of regulator.

Also, Libya has been used for many years as a logistics hub where people can 
store their goods and move freely into North Africa. However, with the 
difficulties there now and the security threats, many companies are moving out 
of Libya. We would like to fill that gap, accommodating those companies that 
were using Libya for their storage. We don’t have large amounts of land here in 
Malta, so we have to work wisely. We cannot store oil rigs on land, for 
example. We have to attract high value products.

With a base connecting Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East along 
main Mediterranean trading routes, Malta has long been a logistics centre. 
Charles Schiavone, DHL Malta’s country manager, takes a glimpse at the 
competition and the future.


To what extent do you believe Malta can become a hub for the entire region?
Malta has an ideal position. I see this as very likely to happen in the years 
to come. The airport and the port are very close to each other, so this is a 
big opportunity for many companies and entrepreneurs in Malta.

How does Malta’s infrastructure compare to the surrounding region in terms of 
technology and innovation, and what is the overall cost breakdown in Malta 
compare with that in other countries where DHL is present?
Malta has a pretty good infrastructure and DHL, for its part, is continuously 
investing. With us, we see things happening first in the big countries and then 
it will filter down to us. Malta, being so small, is always at the end of the 
project implementation but we always benefit.

Thinking ahead, the convergence stage is designed to make our business, our 
technology and our people work together, as one, in order to make our company 
more agile and responsive to customers, and changes in the global economy.

How would you assess the competition?
Competition plays a big role, especially in pricing. We were at the top in 
terms of pricing. In recent years, in order to remain competitive, we had to 
bring down our prices. Now we are more competitive and gaining customers even 
from the competition.

We have the widest operational window versus the competition. The operational 
window is the time from the arrival of new material in the warehouse and after 
how many minutes you can do your first delivery, and what is the last time you 
can go to a customer who wants an item exported so that it will reach its 
destination in Europe the following day. This is an advantage for the exporter, 
who can prepare his documents up to a certain time and we can accommodate, 
collect them and send them.

How important is it for DHL to diversify?
There is a demand for warehousing, but for us as DHL Malta, we are not looking 
at that for now. We have to focus on the time definite international express 
delivery, because it is our core business.

What are your goals?
We have to focus on the expansion of our warehouse, and of course we have to 
try to increase our market share. My intention is to conduct market research in 
the coming months so we will have a clear view of the trends.

For now, the trend shows that B2C is still growing. I need to cater for the 
greater inflow of parcels for local delivery. On the other side, with exports, 
my main source of revenue, potentially, there is more business we can gain both 
from the competition and new set-up companies coming from abroad. There are a 
lot of SMEs coming from Italy and Cyprus.
