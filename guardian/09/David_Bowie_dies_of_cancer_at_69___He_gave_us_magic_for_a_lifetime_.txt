David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie>, the iconic rock 
star whose career spanned more than half a century and whose influence 
transcended music, fashion and sexuality, has died aged 69.


The singer’s death was confirmed in a Facebook post on his official page: 
“David Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 
18-month battle with cancer. While many of you will share in this loss, we ask 
that you respect the family’s privacy during their time of grief.”

Writing on Twitter <https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/686441083648212992>
, Bowie’s son, the film director Duncan Jones, 44, said: “Very sorry and sad to 
say it’s true.” The news came as a shock to some, who were initially sceptical, 
but Bowie’s publicist, Steve Martin, told the Reuters news agency: “It’s not a 
hoax.”

Bowie’s 25 albums produced a string of hits including Changes, Life on Mars 
and Ashes to Ashes. He was known for experimenting across diverse musical 
genres, and for his alter egos Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane and the Thin White 
Duke. He also had a notable acting career.

His latest album, Blackstar, was released last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/david-bowie-blackstar-review-a-spellbinding-break-with-his-past>
 to coincide with his 69th birthday, and had received widespread critical 
acclaim.

Blackstar was the first Bowie release not to feature a picture of him on the 
cover: instead, a stylised black star heralded a darker work. On 
re-examination, there is much in Blackstar to suggest Bowie was saying goodbye, 
particularly in Lazarus, and the video for the title track, which opens with the
image of a dead spaceman <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kszLwBaC4Sw>.

Tributes were paid on social media. In a heartfelt Facebook post, Tony 
Visconti, 
<https://www.facebook.com/tony.visconti1/posts/10208522003550232?fref=nf> who 
produced a series of Bowie’s albums, including Young Americans and his seminal 
Berlin trilogy, Low, Heroes and Lodger, wrote: “He always did what he wanted to 
do. And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His 
death was no different from his life – a work of art.

“He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the 
way it would be. I wasn’t, however, prepared for it. He was an extraordinary 
man, full of love and life. He will always be with us. For now, it is 
appropriate to cry.”

An hour after the news broke, fans began to gather near his apartment on 
Lafayette Street in the Soho district of New York. The first, Kate Corman, left 
a candle and flowers. “First Lou Reed, now David Bowie. It’s so sad. 
Unbelievable. New York is really over now,” she said.

‎At Puckfair, a bar across the street from Bowie’s apartment andfrequented by 
the singer, the barman played a string of his hits – Jean Genie, Let’s Dance 
and Heroes. “It’s hard to put into words what he gave us in his songs,” said 
late-night drinker Bill Marlborough. “If you don’t feel it, I can’t explain.”

Flowers and tributes were also laid at a mural on a wall in Brixton, south 
London, where the singer was born, and a candle was placed outside a property 
in Stansfield Road, thought to be his childhood home.


Bowie had been absent from public view for a decade. After a heart attack 
while touring in 2004 there were only a few low-key live appearances – his last 
at a charity show in New York in 2006 when he performed alongside Alicia Keys – 
and an acting role in the film The Prestige the same year.


He was said to sit quietly in his apartment, or at the house in upstate New 
York near Woodstock, which he purchased with the supermodel Iman, whom he 
married in 1992 and with whom he had a daughter, Alexandria, 15.


Paul Trynka, his biographer, told the Press Association the decade between his 
23rd album Reality in 2003 and The Next Day in 2013 gave Bowie time to be “a 
family man”. “He walked Lexi [his daughter] to school every day – something he 
had missed with Duncan [his son] which was something he deeply regretted”.

Ricky Gervais, the comedian and actor who convinced the famously private Bowie 
to star as himself in an episode of the 2006 sitcom Extras, wrote: “I just lost 
a hero. RIP David Bowie

Bowie in his own words: highlights from his TV interviews

The rock guitarist Joel Madden, quoting Changes, wrote simply: “Turn and face 
the strange <https://twitter.com/JoelMadden/status/686445570873950209>”.  
<https://twitter.com/JoelMadden/status/686445570873950209>

The rapper Kanye West said 
<https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/686449257767776256>: “David Bowie was one 
of my most important inspirations, so fearless, so creative, he gave us magic 
for a lifetime.”


Mick Jagger said: “David was always an inspiration to me and a true original. 
He was wonderfully shameless in his work. We had so many good times together 
... He was my friend. I will never forget him.”

Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, south London, 
to mother Margaret “Peggy”, a waitress, and charity worker Haywood “John” 
Jones. His older brother’s record collection introduced him to rock music at an 
early age.

The family moved to south-east London and he graduated from Bromley technical 
high school at 16, when he was busy forming a number of bands and leading a 
group. He called himself Davy Jones, later changing his name to David Bowie to 
avoid confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees. The name was reportedly 
inspired by a knife developed by the 19th century American pioneer Jim Bowie.

He released three singles as a solo artist for Pye Records, and a debut album 
David Bowie, but did not achieve huge success and retreated to a Buddhist 
monastery in Scotland in 1967.


After returning to London he started the arts troupe Feathers in 1968, then 
helped organise the Free Festival, a day-long free music event in Beckenham, 
southeast London, in 1969. That same year he released Space Oddity, which went 
on to be his first UK No 1. The release the following year of The Rise and Fall 
of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars made him an international star, and 
he conquered the US with his theatrical stage show.

He produced albums for Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, as well as writing All the Young 
Dudes, which he gave to Mott The Hoople who had a massive hit with it. In the 
late 1970s he produced a three-album collaboration with Brian Eno, known as the 
Berlin trilogy.

Bowie combined his rock career with appearances in films. His acting career 
took off with his performance in Nicolas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth, 
followed by roles in films such as Labyrinth, The Last Temptation of Christ and 
Absolute Beginners. More recently, he appeared as himself in the film Zoolander.

Bowie officially retired Ziggy Stardust in 1973, making the announcement 
during a London gig. But the hits kept coming, with albums including Aladdin 
Sane, Diamond Dogs and Pin Ups.


He changed direction with the soul-inspired Young Americans. His first US No 1 
was a collaboration with John Lennon on Fame, which topped the charts in 1975.

He continued to sell millions of albums and pack out stadiums with the rise of 
the New Romantic scene in 1980s Britain. He embraced pop, finding chart success 
with songs such as Let’s Dance and Queen collaboration Under Pressure.

Friend and collaborator Iggy Pop described him on social media as “the light 
of my life”, while singer Madonna tweeted: “Talented. Unique. Genius. Game 
Changer”.

The Rolling Stones hailed his as “an extraordinary artist and a true 
original”. The rock group Queen, with whom he collaborated on Under Pressure, 
tweeted a link to the video of the song, with the words: “This is our last 
dance....”


Prime minister David Cameron, speaking on an engagement in north London, said: 
“Musically, creatively, artistically David Bowie was a genius”.

Bowie once said that he was bisexual, although he later suggested that his 
sexual interactions with men should be seen in the context of his wider 
cultural experimentation. “I was always a closet heterosexual,” he told Rolling 
Stone magazine in 1993.


In 1970 he married Angie Bowie, and the couple had a son named Zowie Bowie, 
now known as Duncan Jones. They split in 1980. He settled in New York one year 
after marrying Iman.

 Bowie continued to record and tour until 2003, when he released Reality, his 
23rd album, which many assumed to be his last.


“I am not a natural performer,” Bowie said in a rare interview in 2002. “I 
don’t enjoy performing terribly much. Never have. I can do it and, if my mind’s 
on the situation, do it quite well. But, five or six shows in, I’m dying to get 
off the road and go back to the studio.”

In the same interview, he said: “My entire career, I’ve only really worked 
with the same subject matter. The trousers may change, but the actual words and 
subjects I’ve always chosen to write with are things to do with isolation, 
abandonment, fear and anxiety, all of the high points of one’s life.”
