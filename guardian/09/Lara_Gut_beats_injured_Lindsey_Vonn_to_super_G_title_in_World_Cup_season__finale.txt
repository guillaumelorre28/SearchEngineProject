Lara Gut won the season-long super-G title on Thursday, finishing second 
behind Tina Weirather at the World Cup finals and overtaking the injured 
Lindsey Vonn for the crystal globe.

The overall champion from Switzerland was only 19 points behind Vonn heading 
into the final race and needed to finish at least sixth to surpass the 
American, whoinjured her knee in a crash

 in a super-G in Andorra in February.

Gut finished 0.41 seconds behind Weirather on the Corviglia slope, with 
Cornelia Hütter third, 0.59 seconds off the pace.

Hütter finished fourth in the super-G standings, just behind Vonn, who was in 
St Moritz after flying in to pick up her downhill title on Wednesday.

The men’s Super-G crown went to Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, the first globe of 
the 23-year-old’s career.

In the men’s race, the home favourite Beat Feuz chalked up his second victory 
in two days after also winning the downhill on Wednesday.
