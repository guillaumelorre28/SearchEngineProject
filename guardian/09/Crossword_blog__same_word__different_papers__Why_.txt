There’s an experience familiar to anyone for whom one puzzle a day is not 
enough. We particularly enjoy it at Crossword Blog: the Cluing Coincidence.

Recently, for example, Raich in the Independent had this clue ...

12ac Self-disciplined – sure, ate differently (7)
[Anagram of “sure ate”]

... on the same day that the Times cryptic 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/b6433bf14c37f0a7014e1a8fb33700b5/print_solution/3>
 had this one ...

4d Severe features relaxed — not feminine (7)
[Anagram of “features” without abbreviation for “feminine”][Anagram of EATURES]

... both of them asking for AUSTERE. As sober sorts, we rarely suspect the 
kind of skullduggeryuncovered by Will Travers in the aborted TV thriller Rubicon
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/jul/12/top-10-crosswords-fiction-rubicon>
, where keywords to a seditious plot appear simultaneously in the US’s posh 
papers.

In that fictional world, Will’s boss is circumspect: 

I’ve seen this before. Crossword editors, quirky sense of humour. Probably 
some kind of inside joke.

In other words, a harmless conspiracy. But, for both of them, the coincidence 
is evidence of agency (as in intended action, not necessarily on the part of 
the CIA), whether in the name of pranking or murderous treason.

What are the chances, though, of such concurrences being merely happenstance?

The Times’s archive editor and feedback nabob Rose Wild has tackled this head 
on <http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/feedback/article4501460.ece>, in 
response to a reader who solves theTimes2 quick crossword 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/crosswords/concise/> and that of another, 
unidentified, paper that he gets free at the gym. Not cryptics in this case, 
but the same thing is happening: “Over the course of a week or so, both puzzles 
include a number of the same answers.”

Wild asked Times2 crossword editor John Grimshaw (also feared by solvers of 
the Listener <http://www.listenercrossword.com/>, the Enigmatic Variations 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/article_full_details?article_id=1> and the 
Magpie <http://www.piemag.com/> as the puckish Dimitry) for an explanation, and 
it’s compelling 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/feedback/article4501460.ece>: 

Each puzzle selects about 25 words from, say, about 80,000 suitable for such a 
puzzle, leading to a probability of a particular word in one puzzle appearing 
in another of 25/80,000.

But, Grimshaw goes on, the odds of a coincidence are much higher in practice, 
because,as we saw here in some wonderful data journalism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/feb/08/crossword-blog-word-puzzle-setters-love>
, some words appear much more often in crosswords than they do in what 
non-solvers might call “real life”.

There are lots of Is and Os knocking about in words, whether in puzzles or the 
written word, but puzzles need words to intersect with these letters. So, 
crossword English has far more words that end in I or O than does the normal 
version of the language. Grimshaw expands:

There are similar effects that probably mean the selection is very much biased 
towards some types of words cropping up more often, especially where there are 
few possibilities to match crossing letters in longer words that can’t be 
changed as easily.

For example, he says, a setter will sooner or later get to a point in a grid 
where he or she needs a word of the form __T__H, and so ITCH and ETCH come into 
play – or indeed UTAH,which alarmed MI5 quite so much when it appeared in the 
Telegraph puzzle in 1944 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/may/12/crossword-unsolved-mystery-d-day-puzzles-leonard-dawe>
.

This considerably changes the probability of coincidences, although it’s still 
low — but not so low that one wouldn’t expect them to occur on occasion.

And, of course, if a word is topical (as AUSTERE surely is), the chances are 
higher still.

To my mind, this is a feature of crosswords, rather than a bug. In his 
Chambers Crossword Manual 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/chambers-crossword-manual.html>, Don Manley (
meet him here in our Q&A with Pasquale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/02/crossword-blog-meet-setter-pasquale>
) gives further examples of “crosswordy” words. We should “learn to regard 
them”, he says, “as old friends”.

And, for the beginner, coincidences can be instructive. Looking at the same 
word clued in different ways is as good a way as any of getting to grips with 
the styles of different setters. The many shades of meaning in the English 
language, and the limitless possibilities of the cryptic toolkit, mean we can 
take many routes to the same destination. Here’sHectence in a recent quiptic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/785>, the Guardian’s 
stepping-stone puzzle for those wanting to leap from quick to cryptic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quiptic>: 

8ac Jane’s brief religious education is puritanical (7)
[Truncated surname of a “Jane” plus abbreviation for “religious education”]
[AUSTEN - N + RE]

So, as well as being topical and having great letters, AUSTERE is also a word 
with a range of meanings (self-disciplined, severe, puritanical) – and that’s
before the world of politics adds its own nuance and spin
