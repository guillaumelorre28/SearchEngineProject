Gone are the dark days of 2014, when Tesco admitted a spreadsheet cock-up had 
inflated its figures by a couple of hundred mill. For a second, it seemed it 
might stop being an ever-expanding capitalist hydra with enough money to buy, 
mince, breadcrumb and aggressively discount every woman and child in the UK. 
But it’s all better now. Tesco is back.

 If being able to pay Ruth Jones and Ben Miller a squazillion pounds each to 
bring unnecessarily good comic timing to a flippant ad campaign wasn’t enough 
of a crow about revived profits, now it’s trying to goad us into vexatious 
customer services interactions. In the latest spot, Ruth and Ben regret buying 
a watermelon. Rather than grimly endure a week of enforced melony afters, as 
any normal householder would, Ruth goes back and changes it for a pineapple. 
The lady behind the desk, which seems to have its own pineapple supply, smiles 
– and the voiceover says exchanges can be made “for any reason”. You heard 
them: if your coconuts are too hairy, your Chelsea buns aren’t square enough or 
you suspect your Granny Smiths voted Brexit, demand alternatives. Tesco can 
afford it.
