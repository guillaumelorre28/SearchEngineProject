John Berger <https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-berger>, the 
Booker-prize-winning novelist and visionary writer who helped transform the way 
a generation looked at and perceived art, has died aged 90.

Berger had a profound effect on how visual art was appreciated with his book 
Ways of Seeing andthe 1972 BBC television series

The actor and director Simon McBurney tweeted his reaction to Berger’s death:

Listener, grinder of lenses, poet, painter, seer. My Guide. Philosopher. 
Friend. John Berger left us this morning. Now you are everywhere.

Art <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art> and the wider world seemed 
to make more sense after watching Berger on the BBC, with his piercing blue 
eyes, steady delivery and groovy seventies shirt, eloquently explain 
perspective or the idealisation of the nude.

Susan Sontag once described Berger as peerless in his ability to make 
“attentiveness to the sensual world” meet “imperatives of conscience”.Jarvis 
Cocker <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jarvis-cocker>, to mark a recent book 
of essays about Berger, said: “There are a few authors that can change the way 
you look at the world through their writing and John Berger is one of them.”

In reaction to the news of his death, artist David Shrigley called Berger “the 
best ever writer on art”, and author Jeanette Winterson praised him as “an 
energy source in a depleted world”.

Goodbye John Berger. You will be greatly missed. The ever best writer on art.

John Berger gone. That is hard. He was an energy source in a depleted world.

Berger lived for many years in a remote farmhouse in the French Alps, to where 
the British Library’s Jamie Andrews had to travel when the institution acquired 
Berger’s literary archive in 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/20/british-library-john-berger-archive>
.

More recently he lived in Antony, a suburb of Paris. It was from there he gave 
one of his final interviews with the Observer’s Kate Kellaway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/30/john-berger-at-90-interview-storyteller>
, giving his view, among other things, on the bigger picture around the Brexit 
vote. “It seems to me that we have to return, to recapitulate what 
globalisation meant, because it meant that capitalism, the world financial 
organisations, became speculative and ceased to be first and foremost 
productive, and politicians lost nearly all their power to take political 
decisions – I mean politicians in the traditional sense. Nations ceased to be 
what they were before.”

Berger was a lifelong Marxist, a vehement critic of capitalism. He began his 
career as a painter before turning to writing, becoming an art critic for the
New Statesman <https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-statesman>. He published 
his first novel, A Painter of our Time, in 1958.

His picaresque novel G won the Booker prize in 1972. Subsequent winners of the 
prize are routinely asked what they are going to do with the generous prize 
money and no-one has been able to better what Berger did. Disdainful of Booker 
McConnell’s historical association with indentured labour in the Caribbean, he 
said he would donate half the cash to the British Black Panthers, who were “the 
black movement with the socialist and revolutionary perspective that I find 
myself most in agreement with in this country”.

He kept the other half to support his work on a study of migrant workers which 
became the book with photographer Jean Mohr, A Seventh Man.

• This article was amended on 3 January 2017. An earlier version said the 
television series Ways of Seeing was based on John Berger’s book. It was the 
other way around.
