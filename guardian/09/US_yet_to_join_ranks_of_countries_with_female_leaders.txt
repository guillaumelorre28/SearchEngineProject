After 240 years of men in the job, the United States will have to wait at 
least another four years to hear the words “Madam President” afterHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was defeated by 
Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

But outside the US, history looks very different.

In 50 countries around the world, citizens have already seen a female head of 
government – and of those, 46 have had a female head of state who wasn’t a 
monarch.

Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was the first country in the world to elect a female 
head of government, in July 1960. Indira Gandhi became the first female prime 
minister of India in 1966, and three years later Golda Meir became Israel’s 
first female head of government. Elisabeth Domitien came next, appointed first 
female prime minister of the Central African Republic over 40 years ago, in 
1975.

The Central African Republic, like 33 other countries, has yet to have a 
second female head of government. A clear exception to the “one and done” rule 
is Bangladesh, where citizens have democratically elected a female head of 
state four times in the country’s history.

Overall counts of female leaders vary, though. The World Economic Forum 
estimates that 52 countries have had a female head of state before the US, but 
it appears they occasionally confuse the role with a female head of government 
– as several readerspointed out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/jul/28/women-leaders-female-head-of-state-history-data>
 in July.

For example, the United Kingdom and its constituent nations have had female 
heads of state for centuries, among them Queen Anne, Queen Victoria and the 
current Queen Elizabeth. Buttable C14 
<http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR16/WEF_Global_Gender_Gap_Report_2016.pdf> of 
their 2016 Global Gender Gap suggests the UK has had a female head of state for 
only 12 years (which is actually the total number of years that Margaret 
Thatcher and the current prime minister, Theresa May, have been in office).
