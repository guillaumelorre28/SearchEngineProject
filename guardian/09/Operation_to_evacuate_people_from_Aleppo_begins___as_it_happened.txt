Assad hails historical turning point

Kareem Shaheen

Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad has hailed the fall of Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> as a historical turning point. In a 
video released by his office he says: “What is happening today is the writing 
of history.”

In philosophical and whimsical, message he talks about the fall of Aleppo in 
the context of the birth of Christ the fall of the USSR. The reclaiming of 
Aleppo will be something of similar historical significance, and a key turning 
point in the conflict, he says.

Here’s a summary of the latest on the evacuation of eastern Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>.

 * Hundreds of people have been evacuated from eastern Aleppo after a 
long-awaited operation to evacuate people from besieged districts got underway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/syria-ambulances-on-the-move-as-aleppo-evacuation-operation-begins>
 .State media said 951 people had been escorted out of the area. 
 * The International Committee of the the Red Cross confirmed that 13 
ambulances and 20 buses carrying civilians and the wounded left east Aleppo. A 
second convoy is expected to depart later on Thursday. 
 * A Turkish official said that 50,000 people are expected to evacuated in the 
next three days.The UN’s Jan Egeland says there may be 30,000 people left in 
besieged pockets ofAleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>, after 
50,000 people have fled. 
 * Russia told the UN that the evacuation would be quick and peaceful. The UN 
is monitoring the process but has not brokered the deal. 
 * A convoy of aid trucks and ambulances is also travelling to the besieged 
Shia villages of Fua and Kefraya as part of a ceasefire deal.The inclusion of 
villages was a concession toIran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/iran-aleppo-syria-shia-militia>, 
which reportedly opposed the previous ceasefire deal negotiated by Turkish 
intelligence and the Russian military. 
 * The evacuation was initially delayed amid reports that Syrian government 
fighters opened fire on a convoy as it prepared to leave rebel-held areas. At 
least three people were wounded according to the rescue service. 
 * Later the ICRC said its teams were “safe” and doing all they could to help 
save lives. 
 * Under the terms of the deal a ceasefire went into effect at 2.30am 
(00.30GMT) Aleppo time. The new ceasefire agreement came a day after a previous 
evacuation deal appeared to unravel in the face of Iranian opposition.

 * The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep 
Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a joint statement on Wednesday night urging an end to 
the ceasefire violationsand “reaffirmed their commitment to start the 
evacuation of civilians and the opposition through safe corridors as soon as 
possible”. 
 * The evacuation of rebel-held eastern Aleppo would mean the opposition would 
cede the city, the last significant urban stronghold where it maintained an 
active presence. Civilians left in the opposition districts have been posting 
farewell messages on walls in eastern Aleppo.

Lord Michael Williams, former UN under secretary general and UN special 
coordinator for Lebanon, said events inAleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> had left the authority of the UN “in 
tatters”.


Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme he said: “The pictures of the 
last several days from Aleppo, personally I found extraordinarily disturbing. 
They were all too redolent of the Nazi evacuation of the Jews from the Warsaw 
ghetto in the 1940s or Bosnia Serb evacuations of Muslim enclaves such as 
Srebrenica in 1995/96. To see this happening 20 years later on the eve of 
Christmas is deeply shocking. And is an indictment of the international system.”

Williams, now a fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said the crisis in 
Aleppo was also a “terrible indictment of Obama”:

He has done nothing. When grave crimes of humanity have occurred again. They 
[the US] alone could have made a military intervention. The ghosts of Iraq, 
Afghanistan and Libya have haunted the war inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, but something might have been done, 
not so much in terms of a dramatic grand peace plan ... but an attempt to 
momentarily stabilise the situation around Aleppo and provide for the 
evacuation of women and children and the injured.”

Kareem Shaheen

A teacher in east Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>, who is 
waiting to be evacuated, said there were mixed feelings among the residents, 
writes Kareem Shaheem.

He said some were angry that they are being forced to leave and others happy 
that they the violence will stop. He said some locals were burning their 
belongings in their homes so they aren’t looted by pro-regime forces when they 
enter the besieged districts.

Syrian officials said the first convoy to leave eastern Aleppo took out women, 
children and the wounded.

The mayor of eastern Aleppo, Brita Hagi Hasan, says he fears 50,000 civilians 
in easternAleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> “are about to be 
victims of a general massacre”.

 Speaking in Brussels at an EU summit he called for “a courageous position 
from the European Union, a position of sending of sending some forces to 
monitor the evacuation of civilians”.

 “We never asked any country to go to war ... we only ask to save civilians 
and secure some corridors for their evacuation,” Hasan said.

 Speaking as civilians began to be escorted from the city, he said more than 
800 wounded people in eastern Aleppo need evacuating urgently and over 5,000 
others who are hurt should also leave.

 Hasan was invited into the EU summit, and sat alongside the European council 
president Donald Tusk as he opened the meeting.

 In private talks with Hasan, Tusk acknowledged that “the last thing your 
people in Aleppo need today is more words of sympathy”.

 “The only thing you need today is real and effective assistance,” a visibly 
emotional Tusk said.

Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad has hailed the fall of Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> as a historical turning point. In a 
video released by his office he says: “What is happening today is the writing 
of history.”

In philosophical and whimsical, message he talks about the fall of Aleppo in 
the context of the birth of Christ the fall of the USSR. The reclaiming of 
Aleppo will be something of similar historical significance, and a key turning 
point in the conflict, he says.

Russia’s defence ministry says rebels have been driven out of all areas of 
Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>. It says it is winding up its 
military campaign after the last 3,000 rebels left the city, according to the 
news agency Tass.

It also claimed it has not bombed Aleppo since 18 October. RIA Novosti says 
108,000 civilians have moved to secure areas.
 
Here’s a summary of the latest on the evacuation of eastern Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>.

 * Hundreds of people have been evacuated from eastern Aleppo after a 
long-awaited operation to evacuate people from besieged districts got underway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/syria-ambulances-on-the-move-as-aleppo-evacuation-operation-begins>
 .State media said 951 people had been escorted out of the area. 
 * The International Committee of the the Red Cross confirmed that 13 
ambulances and 20 buses carrying civilians and the wounded left east Aleppo. A 
second convoy is expected to depart later on Thursday. 
 * A Turkish official said that 50,000 people are expected to evacuated in the 
next three days.The UN’s Jan Egeland says there may be 30,000 people left in 
besieged pockets ofAleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>, after 
50,000 people have fled. 
 * Russia told the UN that the evacuation would be quick and peaceful. The UN 
is monitoring the process but has not brokered the deal. 
 * A convoy of aid trucks and ambulances is also travelling to the besieged 
Shia villages of Fua and Kefraya as part of a ceasefire deal.The inclusion of 
villages was a concession toIran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/iran-aleppo-syria-shia-militia>, 
which reportedly opposed the previous ceasefire deal negotiated by Turkish 
intelligence and the Russian military. 
 * The evacuation was initially delayed amid reports that Syrian government 
fighters opened fire on a convoy as it prepared to leave rebel-held areas. At 
least three people were wounded according to the rescue service. 
 * Later the ICRC said its teams were “safe” and doing all they could to help 
save lives. 
 * Under the terms of the deal a ceasefire went into effect at 2.30am 
(00.30GMT) Aleppo time. The new ceasefire agreement came a day after a previous 
evacuation deal appeared to unravel in the face of Iranian opposition.

 * The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep 
Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a joint statement on Wednesday night urging an end to 
the ceasefire violationsand “reaffirmed their commitment to start the 
evacuation of civilians and the opposition through safe corridors as soon as 
possible”. 
 * The evacuation of rebel-held eastern Aleppo would mean the opposition would 
cede the city, the last significant urban stronghold where it maintained an 
active presence. Civilians left in the opposition districts have been posting 
farewell messages on walls in eastern Aleppo.   Syrian Red Crescent staff and people from east Aleppo on a bus during

A Syrian official has told Reuters that a second convoy of 15 buses could soon 
leave easternAleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> after the first 
convoy escorted 951 people.

“The initial information is that the operation will continue today. Around 15 
new buses are being prepared to evacuate the second group from the areas under 
the militants’ control,” its source said.

Meanwhile, a Turkish official told the agency that 50,000 people are expected 
to evacuated in the next three days.

Lord Michael Williams, former UN under secretary general and UN special 
coordinator for Lebanon, said events inAleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> had left the authority of the UN “in 
tatters”.


Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme he said: “The pictures of the 
last several days from Aleppo, personally I found extraordinarily disturbing. 
They were all too redolent of the Nazi evacuation of the Jews from the Warsaw 
ghetto in the 1940s or Bosnia Serb evacuations of Muslim enclaves such as 
Srebrenica in 1995/96. To see this happening 20 years later on the eve of 
Christmas is deeply shocking. And is an indictment of the international system.”

Williams, now a fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said the crisis in 
Aleppo was also a “terrible indictment of Obama”:

He has done nothing. When grave crimes of humanity have occurred again. They 
[the US] alone could have made a military intervention. The ghosts of Iraq, 
Afghanistan and Libya have haunted the war inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, but something might have been done, 
not so much in terms of a dramatic grand peace plan ... but an attempt to 
momentarily stabilise the situation around Aleppo and provide for the 
evacuation of women and children and the injured.”

Almost a thousand people have left eastern Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>, according to a Syrian official.

The official told Reuters that 951 people left eastern Aleppo on Thursday in 
the first convoy to depart from the rebel enclave. The convoy included women, 
children and the wounded, the official said.

A teacher in east Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>, who is 
waiting to be evacuated, said there were mixed feelings among the residents, 
writes Kareem Shaheem.

He said some were angry that they are being forced to leave and others happy 
that they the violence will stop. He said some locals were burning their 
belongings in their homes so they aren’t looted by pro-regime forces when they 
enter the besieged districts.

Syrian officials said the first convoy to leave eastern Aleppo took out women, 
children and the wounded.

The mayor of eastern Aleppo, Brita Hagi Hasan, says he fears 50,000 civilians 
in easternAleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> “are about to be 
victims of a general massacre”.

 Speaking in Brussels at an EU summit he called for “a courageous position 
from the European Union, a position of sending of sending some forces to 
monitor the evacuation of civilians”.

 “We never asked any country to go to war ... we only ask to save civilians 
and secure some corridors for their evacuation,” Hasan said.

 Speaking as civilians began to be escorted from the city, he said more than 
800 wounded people in eastern Aleppo need evacuating urgently and over 5,000 
others who are hurt should also leave.

 Hasan was invited into the EU summit, and sat alongside the European council 
president Donald Tusk as he opened the meeting.

 In private talks with Hasan, Tusk acknowledged that “the last thing your 
people in Aleppo need today is more words of sympathy”.

 “The only thing you need today is real and effective assistance,” a visibly 
emotional Tusk said.
