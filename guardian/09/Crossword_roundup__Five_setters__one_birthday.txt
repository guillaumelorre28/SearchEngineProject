The news in clues

The veteran solver’s curiosity is instinctively pricked by the sight of a grid 
whose edges, rather than having longish entries broken up by the occasional 
black square, boast instead a checkerboard. What words, the solver wonders, 
will appear in the perimeter? Unhinted at by any of the clues, but appearing as 
the regular clues yield their secrets?

In last Tuesday’s Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26587>, a hint came from the Q, 
and the knowledge that the setter was Pasquale. And so it was ...
 Solution to Guardian 26,587. 
... that we learned that PASQUALE IS SEVENTY TODAY. Happy birthday, Pasquale! 
We’veinterviewed Pasquale here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/02/crossword-blog-meet-setter-pasquale>
, of course, and he told us that:

Pasquale is probably the hardest of my daily disguises. As Quixote in the 
Independent, I try to produce something that might be a very quick solve for 
the experienced setter. When I set a puzzle, I am very aware of who it is for 
and what the crossword editor will and won’t tolerate.

And those other daily disguises were on duty the same day. In the Independent 
...
 Solution to Independent 8,933 (please ignore and forgive the misleading 
italics: they are this solver’s ‘pencil marks’ for letters he had been unsure 
of). 
... the perimeter instead read MY SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY. So happy birthday, 
Quixote! Andin the Financial Times 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/35c87708-ffc4-11e4-bc30-00144feabdc0.pdf>
 (happy birthday, Bradman!), we had a pair of clues ...

14ac Great sportsman in Brazil, promoter of products (7) 
[ abbrev. for Brazil + term for advertising person ]
[ BR + AD-MAN ]

15ac Number in uniform in place of debauchery (7)
[ synonym for “uniform” inside word for a debauched place ]
[ EVEN inside STY ]

... which gave us BRADMAN and SEVENTY across a prominent row. Lest I commit 
spoilers for all the birthday puzzles, there’s a more sneakily hidden message in
the Telegraph Toughie 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=26085> (happy 
birthday, Giovanni!) and an encoded announcement inthe Times Quick Cryptic 
<http://feeds.thetimes.co.uk/timescrossword/20150602/5441/> (happy birthday, 
Izetti!). And, as far as the daily papers go, that makes it a 350th, and is 
surely your lot ... unless you know better?

Latter patter

How far can you trust the coiner of a word? In the Independent puzzle 
mentioned above, Quixote asked us ...

17d Young rebel once defeated prominent Lib Dem but not Conservative (7)
[ synonym for “defeated” + name of a prominent Lib Dem without abbrev. for 
“Conservative” ]
[ BEAT + NICK - C ]

... to find a BEATNIK. And why are beatniks beatniks? The “nik” part is easy 
enough: it’s a Yiddish/Russian suffix that denotes membership of a group, from 
Kibbutznik to Sputnik, the latter of which seems to have appeared shortly 
before the new wave of Beat Generation rebels found themselves described as 
“beatniks”. So what about the “beat” bit?

The most obvious association is the one Quixote uses in his clue: being 
defeated by, or at least excluded from, the world of work and consumerism.When 
we looked at SWINGOMETER recently 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/apr/13/crossword-roundup-swinging-from-the-polls>
, we were pleased to find that it was coined by a single named person. Beat 
Generation, too, has an “onlie begetter”, but unfortunately he’s Jack Kerouac. 
And so we have to rely on his own account of his thinking; this is tricky not 
because of the state of Kerouac’s mind but because, unlike with “swingometer”, 
“beatnik” is a political term: in coining and accounting for it, Kerouac is 
making a point.

So when he insists 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vHBeCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT52&dq=%22Beat%20means%20beatitude%2C%20not%20beat%20up%22&pg=PT52#v=onepage&q&f=false>
 that ...

Beat means beatitude, not beat up. You feel this. You feel it in a beat in 
jazz real cool jazz or a good gutty rock number.

... it’s impossible to dismiss revisionism and ruefully file BEATNIK under “we 
will never, etymologically, know”.

Meanwhile, -NIK had a good time making up the end of words like PEACENIK, 
REFUSENIK and more jocose experiments like the anti-beatnik, the NEATNIK. Its 
Slavonic legacy persists in surnames, which leads us to our next challenge. 
Reader, how would you clue MANOLO BLAHNIK?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for SPARROW FACE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/may/25/crossword-blog-is-it-a-selfie-when-someone-else-takes-it#show-all>
. As ever, there were some surprising surfaces, such as schroduck’s 
state-of-the-nation “Eyes wide and mouth agape when somewhere like Tunbridge 
Wells suffering race row – Farage’s first to dive in?” and MaleficOpus’s grim 
“Fear cow running wild after individual starts to shoot poor animal with rifle 
– the solution is a headshot”.

There were also some ingenious defintions, like JollySwagman’s “New substitute 
for cheese causes a row at a Pret’s café. Let’s not have tea there” and 
harlobarlo’s “Prof’s war over best way to make an impression”.

The runners-up are alberyalbery’s “Look, Rev Spooner has room for litter of 
pigs” and ousgg’s “Countenance a birdie: hit straight to hole for one!”; the 
winner is robinjohnson’s insightful “Posturing: ‘Fight, fight, fight!’”

Kudos to Robin; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.


Clue of the fortnight

What a treat to find, in Pasquale’s birthday puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26587> mentioned above ...

10 Tree of gold in curve by a narrow inlet (9)
[ symbol for gold inside synonym for “curve” + synonym for “a narrow inlet” ]
[ AU inside ARC + A RIA ]

... a striking and succinct piece of mythological geography, which also brings 
to mind another setting stalwart. (But did we remember to wish Pasquale a happy 
birthday?)
