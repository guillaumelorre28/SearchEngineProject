British snowboarder Billy Morgan has landed the sport’s first ever 1800 
quadruple cork. The rider, who represented Great Britain at the 2014 Winter 
Olympics in Sochi, was in Livigno,Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, when he achieved the manoeuvre. It 
involves flipping four times, while the body also spins five complete rotations 
on a sideways or downward-facing axis.

The trick had long been considered unachievable by some. However, as long ago 
as 2013, snowboard fans online had beenpegging Morgan as the rider capable of 
landing it

.

Afterwards, Morgan revealed his relief, having spent some time building up to 
the attempt. For riders at his level, this usually involves starting off with a 
huge inflated crash pad to land on, in order to perfect the momentum and speed 
required for a trick before trying to ride out of it. He also said the trick 
could have been cleaner, because he put a hand down to steady his landing.

Bigger and bigger jumps have allowed riders to push for tricks that were 
considered impossible. However, this has also led to increased danger. In 2009, 
US Olympic hope Kevin Pearce suffered a traumatic brain injury that ended his 
career on a snowboard halfpipe with walls 6.7m (22ft) high.

Then in 2013, Icelandic snowboarder Halldór Helgason was knocked unconscious 
on a mega ramp similar to the one Morgan rides in this video. Helgason was 
attempting the less technical feat of a straight triple backflip.
