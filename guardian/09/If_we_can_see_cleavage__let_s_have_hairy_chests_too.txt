It isn’t just the important question of skirt length for a female prime 
minister (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/nov/06/age-appropriate-clothing-and-food-for-people-over-55>
, 7 November) that is of national concern. What does a woman of state do about 
cleavage? I speak not as a geologist thinking about cleavage in slates: but the 
question of how bosoms and cleavage are “dressed” (disguised) in the largely 
male world of international politics.

Revelations of décolletage, cleavage, a sneak of ample breasts, have caught 
out other former home secretaries. Such glimpses of femininity in our prime 
minister should surely be matched by open-necked shirts showing a tantalising 
glimpse of hairy chests from international men of state. Let’s see some 
equality.
