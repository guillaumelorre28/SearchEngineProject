Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> militants have launched 
a commando raid on the Iraqi city of Kirkuk in an apparent attempt to distract 
Iraqi and Kurdish forces converging on the group’s stronghold of Mosul.


The attack was repelled by local security forces, who said six of the 
militants had been killed in the operation.

Isis claimed responsibility for the assault on its news agency service, Aamaq.


“Security forces, the peshmerga and the counter-terrorism forces have 
established complete control over the security situation in Kirkuk,” Najmeddine 
Karim, the city’s governor, said. “Daesh [Isis] sleeper cells carried out 
attacks against security sites and headquarters this morning in Kirkuk.”


Kirkuk, 146 miles (236km) north of Baghdad, is an oil-rich town that has 
emerged as a potential source of tension in a post-IsisIraq

In another attack reported by AFP on Friday, three bombers infiltrated a power 
plant being built by an Iranian company near Dibis, a town about 25 miles 
north-west of Kirkuk.

“Three suicide bombers attacked the power plant at around 6am, killing 12 
Iraqi administrators and engineers and four Iranian technicians,” Dibis mayor 
Abdullah Nureddin al-Salehi told AFP.

Iraqi forces, alongside Sunni tribal fighters, Kurdish peshmerga 
paramilitaries and Shia militias, this weeklaunched a long-awaited campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul>
 to wrest back control of Mosul, the largest urban centre under Isis control. 
The arrayed forces have made steady advances in clearing militants from 
surrounding towns and villages, before what is likely to be a protracted street 
battle to reclaim the embattled city from up to 6,000 Isis fighters.

Kirkuk is a town with a mixed Shia, Sunni and Kurdish population, and there are 
fears that once Isis is defeated the vacuum could become a flashpoint for power 
and territory struggles over its oilfields.

The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, announced the launch of the Mosul 
operation last weekend. He has since said that the offensive was going faster 
than planned.

But as Iraqi forces and allied militias advanced, concerns mounted over the 
fate of hundreds of thousands of civilians still trapped in and outside Mosul.

The UN human rights office said it was investigating multiple reports of 
abuses against civilians by Isis, including the killing of 40 civilians in a 
village near Mosul, and another incident in which 550 families were said to 
have been moved by the terror group from the surrounding villages into the city 
to prevent them from escaping.

Allegations have mounted in recent days of Isis using civilians as human 
shields as airstrikes and ground force advances continued. The UN believes as 
many as 200,000 civilians could attempt to flee the approaching offensive on 
the city.

Meanwhile, Turkish aid officials said they believed as many as 400,000 people 
could be displaced, contributing to a “large migration wave”.

Turkey borders northern Iraq and has already taken in thousands of Iraqi 
refugees and more than 2 million Syrians. The Turkish Red Crescent said it had 
sent a convoy of 20 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies from Ankara to the 
villages around Mosul.

“In the first stage, we are sending this aid to the nearly 30 villages around 
Mosul that have been liberated. There are 3,000 to 4,000 people on the move 
from those villages, the trucks aim to reach them,” Kerem Kinik, the head of 
the Turkish Red Crescent, told Reuters.
