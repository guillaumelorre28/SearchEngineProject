The news in clues

If you’ve started a prize puzzle from the weekend just gone and haven’t yet 
puzzled out its theme, a glance at the papers might provide what the Countess 
of Rousillon in All’s Well That Ends Well would describe as “a goodly clew”.

Setters have been limbering up for Shakespeare 400 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/23/who-said-it-william-shakespeare-or-miguel-de-cervantes-quiz>
 with references, cameos and quotations. Here’sone from the Sunday Telegraph 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=28695> ...

21d About tragic role that’s easily interpreted (5)
[ abbrev. indicating circa (‘about’) + a tragic theatrical role ]
[ C + LEAR ] 

... which is CLEAR enough, while a Telegraph Toughie 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=28772> required 
familiarity with the less exalted part ...

 16ac Weapon for Falstaff’s follower (6)
[ standard bearer to Falstaff ]

... of the big knight’s standard bearer, Ancient PISTOL, and Chifonie’s 
Guardian puzzle appeared to be doing likewise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26855#16-down> ...

16d Prelate finds new character in Othello (9)
[ abbrev. for ‘new’ + synonym for ‘character’, both inside description of 
Othello ]
[ N + SIGN, both inside MOOR ]

... but in fact required the titular MOOR only en route to MONSIGNOR. 

Of those puzzles for which the solutions have been printed, the bardiest is 
Phi’s in the Independent 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160423#!201604>
 (well worth solving before reading on), where five down is referred to in 
various other clues such as these ...


13ac 5 fine to slip out of dress (4)
[ abbrev. for ‘fine’ removed from synonym for ‘dress’ ]
[ F removed from FROCK ]

 9ac 5 run into farm (5)
[ abbrev. for ‘run’ inside synonym for verb ‘farm’ ]
[ R inside TILL ]

... since ROCK, TRILL and the rest are all words for SHAKE, while 24 down 
popped up time and again ...

 19ac 24 days are mentioned in the Bible (4)
[ abbrev. for ‘days’ + ‘are’ as the word appears in the Bible ]
[ D + ART ]

 6d 24 January will include live broadcast (7)
[ abbrev. for ‘January’ around anagram (‘broadcast’) of ‘live’ ]
[ JAN around VELI ]

... in various types, including DART and JAVELIN, of SPEAR.

As far as I can see, no puzzle – this weekend or otherwise – has used a 
quotation fromHenry IV Part 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/14/best-shakespeare-production-henry-iv>
, which I would have thought would be catnip to those who construct those 
intricate weekend challenges such as theListener 
<http://www.listenercrossword.com/> and Enigmatic Variations 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/article_full_details?article_id=1>. 

It’s a term for a shady individual used by swindlers as a decoy, or by robbers 
as a spy – as used, following some fart gags by Falstaff and before some 
highway robbery, by Hal’s pal Ned Poins:

O! ’tis our setter: I know his voice.

In honour, then, of Shakespeare’s using the word to describe low characters 
who give one impression while having quite another in mind: reader, how would 
you clue SETTER?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for MALARKEY 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/apr/11/crossword-roundup-covert-spies-and-cats-whiskers#comments>
. Alberyalbery presaged the above with “King Lear playing in May – farce?” and 
for surfaces, I was tickled by schroduck’s apostatic “Monk almost U-turns on 
legend of Genesis: ‘Extremely early fairy tale!’” and Poorsub’s demotic “Bird 
takes ecstasy in spring? That’s nonsense talk!”

I admit that I also enjoyed my cameo in ixioned’s “Mr Connor offended blocking 
clue ... ‘Things you say that are not true’”.

The audacity award, for different reasons to usual, has to go to steveran for 
“Newspaper finally gets involved with YMA leak nonsense”.

The runners-up are jonemm’s reassuring “False alarm chief, carry on!” and 
Peshwari’s intriguing “Gas main goes after alarm sabotaged”; the winner is 
DameSweeneyEggblast’s ornate “PM’s financial data extracted from leaky Panama 
firm – IT scandal possibly creating a lot of hot air!”


Kudos to Sweeney; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

What follows is technically neither, but if you have a subscription to the New 
York Times puzzles, I nimbly and sweetly recommendDavid J Kahn’s recent puzzle 
titled In Character 
<http://www.nytimes.com/svc/crosswords/v2/puzzle/daily-2016-03-06.puz>. Eight 
of the entries turn out to be clues, of a sort: some of the letters of each are 
circled, and the circled entries spell out the “real” answers:

COMRADE OF MERCUTIO (5 circles)
BANQUET GHOST (6 circles)
ELDERLY MONARCH (4 circles)
SCHEMER AGAINST CAESAR (5 circles)
LOVE INTEREST OF OLIVIA (5 circles)
EVIL ANTAGONIST (4 circles)
MACABRE THANE (7 circles)
UNHAPPY MALCONTENT (6 circles)

All is revealed at the Wordplay blog 
<http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/in-character/> and it is my most 
sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the setter.
