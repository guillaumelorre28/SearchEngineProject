Occasions in the crossword calendar

If you have read anything written here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/oct/20/crossword-blog-watching-a-champion-solver-at-work>
 about the Times national crossword championship, or paid even the slightest 
attention to it over the last decade, Saturday’s winner will come as scant 
surprise.

And, also from the Times crosswords Twitter account, @timescrosswords 
<https://twitter.com/timescrosswords>, an intriguing possibility for today:

I’m going to be there and be squared – wherever “there” is.

The news in clues

If you haven’t yet solved Radian’s Independent puzzle of last week, you can 
find it here 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20161014#!201610>
. It had at its core one of those pairs of clues that refer to each other ...

16d Port holds baggage abandoned by 20 originally (8)
[ paraphrase of ‘holds baggage’ minus (‘abandoned by’) the first letter of 20d 
]
[ HAS THINGS minus H ]

20d/15ac Dragoons win and hold ground he lost at 16  (6,9)
[ anagram (‘ground’) of DRAGOONS, WIN and HOLD ]

... and which, once unpicked, recall that it was HAROLD GODWINSON who lost at 
HASTINGS. Other clues referred to “20”, not always to HAROLD but certainly so 
in a gruesome depiction of his blue blood.

A 950th anniversary, such as the Battle of Hastings (also the topic of, among 
others, a splendidTimes Two concise puzzle 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/crosswords/concise/#crossword/b6649b054c37f1820157664e9af207cc/open>
), feels a little like Adrian Mole’s declared age of 13¾, but perhaps it’s 
worth getting in some decent celebrations now in case 2066 is a world without 
enough keen historical re-enactors, or indeed one that itself resembles a 
medieval battleground.

Latter patter

In the Telegraph Toughie, MynoT is getting technical 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=9962>:

25ac Mark policeman getting series recast (8)
[ abbrev. for a police rank + anagram (‘recast’) of SERIES ]
[ DI + ERESIS ]

Ah, yes: the DIERESIS, or DIÆRESIS, or as the Guardian prefers it, via 
Collins, DIAERESIS, a word that tempts us to adorn it with itself.

In this paper, we find it in BRONTË, but not in NAIVE; in NOËL Coward but 
never in NOEL Edmonds. In general, it seems to be present here in names of 
people who themselves used diaereses, but never as a warning about how to 
pronounce the second of some pair of vowels.

Not so at the New Yorker, where there is no danger of readers reading NAÏVE as 
sounding like “knave”; likewise COÖPERATE and even REËLECT, due to a ruling in 
the magazine’s youth that CO-OPERATE and RE-ELECT would apparently look 
ridiculous.

According to one of the New Yorker’s proof-readers 
<http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-curse-of-the-diaeresis>, the 
style editor Hobie Weekes tipped off a colleague in 1978 that he had resolved 
to stop infuriating the readers with diaereses ...

... in the elevator, he told her he was on the verge of changing that style 
and would be sending out a memo soon. And then he died.

The subject of our next challenge is a word that, as recently as 227 years 
ago, was seen to sport an diaeresis:
 The title page of John Gilborne’s De Regis Convalescentia (1789). 
Reader, how would you clue POEM?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for NO-MARK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/oct/10/crossword-roundup-brookside-v-happy-mondays#comments>
. My favourites of the real-life Marks were Owen (ComedyPseudonym’s “Failure of 
Gary, Howard, Jason and Robbie”); Phillips (Ousgg’s “Worthless, like Anne’s 
marital status”) Twain (GeoScanner’s “Forgotten Never the Twain?”) and Thatcher 
(TinyTinyMouse’s “As Maggie had to tell her son, the worthless shit”); the 
successor of the last also enabling Hectorthebat’s “Ketamine found in messed-up 
Norma (not Major)”.

I laughed often, especially at ID2155366’s “Lemon pudding?”, Peshwari’s “Ship 
for pixies is reportedly trash”, Alberyalbery’s “Unproductive doctor lies back 
in grass” and Robinjohnson’s “Insignificant, like Germany since adopting Euro”.

The runners-up are Chrisbeee’s acrostic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/jan/27/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-initial-letters>
 “Person to whom ‘charisma’ or ‘work’ apply last of all” and Thebrasselephant’s
triple(?)-definition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/nov/17/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-double-definitions>
 “Zero”; the winner is AriadneOliver’s charming “Love fool”.

Kludos to AriadneOliver; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick 
of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

Nominated by Schroduck, the setter <http://www.eddiejames.co.uk/> known 
locally as Brummieis on form as Cyclops in Private Eye 
<http://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1428/crossword> with a clue ...

10ac Encouragement to tennis player, having balls (7)
[ what one might shout to the world number six ]
[ ‘GO, NADAL!’ ]

... for a word that you might not know you knew. And for clarity, that’s 
Rafael, not Raphaël.
