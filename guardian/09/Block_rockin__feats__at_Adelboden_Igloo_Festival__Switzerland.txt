It’s 10am and I am on a Swiss mountain holding a saw. My mission is to help 
build an igloo by 5pm, sleep in it and – most importantly – wake up next 
morning. It is the fourth annual Igloo Festival in the ski resort of in 
Adelboden, and teams of enthusiasts and novices gather at an altitude of 2,000m 
on the Engstligenalp plateau to spend their Saturday competing to see who can 
build the best igloo. Engstligenalp is the perfect location, since it’s large 
enough to accommodate hundreds of igloos, if need be, and one of the few places 
that can guarantee an abundance of snow in March.

While fancy igloos have become popular as overnight options in ski resorts, 
the Igloo Festival is a chance to build and sleep in the real deal (unless you 
can rustle up a glass-roofed designer igloo with fur bedding in eight hours). 
Anyone can participate and there’s no limit on team numbers … but the igloo has 
to be big enough to sleep the entire team. The well-heated Berghotel is within 
trudging distance for showering, storing luggage and, if your igloo-building 
skills prove inadequate, for sleeping.

The ideal for the Igloo Festival came from its former sponsor, outdoor 
clothing firm Transa. In 2012, it attempted to set a Guinness world record in 
igloo building: 200 igloos with 400 participants. It only managed 60 igloos and 
125 participants, but everyone had such a good time that the festival simply 
continued.

There’s already a circle of fledgling igloos when our five-strong team arrive 
at 10am, and experts and volunteers fromThe Alpine School 
<http://www.alpinschule-adelboden.ch/de/Sommer>, clothing specialist Sherpa 
Outdoor and the tourism office dart around offering guidance. An igloo with 
worryingly neat bricks is being built next to our spot by a father-and-son 
team. Bruno Schaub from the tourist office translates: “He’s here because he 
wants to have a good time with his son.”

The participants are mainly Swiss, though British, French, Italian and German 
teams have taken part. Many have built igloos before. A love of outdoor 
activities and the desire to do something different are common themes in 
today’s igloo village.

The best places to stay in the Alps in summer: hotels, chalets and campsites

To begin, we draw a circle on the ground using a stick and string as a giant 
compass. Sawing into the snow, we cut 20cm-thick bricks about the size of an A3 
sheet, and place them in a circle, leaning slightly inwards. Rachel Rosser, 
events executive for theSki Club of Great Britain <http://www.skiclub.co.uk/>, 
and Bruno saw the tops off the bricks on a diagonal so that the bricks will 
stack in a spiral. While we pack snow into the cracks, Bruno places the bricks 
until he has built himself into the igloo. Now the job is to dig an entrance 
(or, for Bruno, an exit). An igloo’s entrance has to sit below the sleeping 
platform so the cold air sinks and the space stays cosy.

In an attempt to earn “creativity points” we make a snowman head for the top 
of the igloo, with oranges for eyes, a pear nose and a Twix mouth. But thing go 
awry: Rachel loses her grip and drops the head on the igloo, which leaves a 
gaping hole in the side. After howling and rending our garments, we manage to 
repair it before the 5pm deadline.

Night falls, and we gather around the igloo bar, a small wall of snow bricks 
in the centre of the circle of igloos. Participants are served a nightcap of 
glühwein (mulled wine), and as we drink we guess which igloo will snag the 
prizes: Sherpa Outdoor outfits, ski passes, bottles of wine, dinner in the 
Fondue Igloo and tickets to theAdelboden Adventure Park 
<http://www.alpinschule-adelboden.ch/adventurepark>. Most bet on the 
preposterously huge double igloo with an adjoining corridor, built by a team 
celebrating a birthday, but I’m rooting for the one made to look like a giant 
turtle.

With trepidation, Rachel and I (the only two to brave a night in our igloo) 
get ready for “bed”. I’m by the wall that we had to rebuild after “Head Gate”. 
It’s caving in and looks like it would collapse if a pigeon landed on it. I 
give it a test poke – it’s frozen solid.

Our hooded sleeping bags have a fleece bag, a synthetic down sack and a 
plastic outer layer. I zip up, hood up, and wriggle in. Rachel’s bleatings 
about the cold are muffled, but her snoring soon comes loud and clear. I feel 
like I’m cowering in a snowman’s armpit. I’m not sleeping; I’m playing dead.

Sealed inside the sleeping bag, I find my oxygen supply runs out fast. I start 
panting and get a headache, and figure that poking my head out for a few gulps 
of the thin alpine air are worth a blast of cold. And a blast is what I get: 
our slapdash packing left cracks between some of the bricks and the wind is 
blowing through. Then claustrophobia kicks in. The once blue-and-sparkly igloo 
ceiling is now grey and black and closing in. The wind gusts through the 
cracks. I wipe snowflakes off my cheek.

At 3:54am, I nudge the other body bag, “Rachel. It’s snowing on my face.”

“Yeah, I can’t stop shivering,” she says through chattering teeth, “can we 
leave?”

We pull on our boots and layers and headtorches, before fireman-crawling 
through the tunnel into -20C windchill. We make the 15-minute walk back to 
Berghotel, but don’t have the heart to crash into the dorm and wake our 
teammates for the sake of two hours’ sleep, so we settle ourselves the empty 
hotel bar, take dark-eyed selfies for posterity, and wait for the sun to come 
up. We may as well get an incredible sunrise out of this.

At 6:40am that’s just what we get. We stand by the ski lift as it delivers 
early morning skiers, our bloodshot eyes widening at the blue mist over the 
village below, the fading crescent moon, and the red skies rising over the 
mountains. Worth five hours trying to sleep in a windy freezer? Yes.

construction. Photograph: Tom Fakler 
At breakfast with our well-rested teammates, we’re sleep-deprived and thawing 
more slowly than a turkey in the fridge, but our spirits are high. At 9am, 
we’re awarded 14th place out of 22. The turtle igloo comes second, pipped at 
the post by the double with the corridor. No matter: plans for next year’s 
well-packed igloo, with infinity pool, are already in place.
