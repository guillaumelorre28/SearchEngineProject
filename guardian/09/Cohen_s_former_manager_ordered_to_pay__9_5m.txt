 Singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen may never see $9.5m (Â£5.4m) a court ordered 
his former business manager to pay after she failed to respond to allegations 
of stealing from his retirement savings, Cohen's attorney said yesterday.
A judge granted Cohen, 71, the default judgment against Kelley Lynch in 
response to a lawsuit alleging she siphoned $5m from the musician's personal 
accounts and investments.

His attorney, Scott Edelman, said Lynch, who worked for Cohen for 17 years 
until he fired her, also refused to return photographs, records and 
memorabilia, despite a court order.
