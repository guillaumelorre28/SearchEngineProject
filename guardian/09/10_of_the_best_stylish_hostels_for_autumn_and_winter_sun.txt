Jack Sprat Shack, Treasure Bay, Jamaica

On an island better known for all-inclusive resorts than cool independent 
hotels, the Jack Sprat Shack, opening in late October, is a departure from the 
Caribbean norm. The wood-clad hostel takes its name and look from the Jack 
Sprat restaurant (pictured), and will have 40 dorm beds, 12 twin/double rooms 
and a brightly-painted communal kitchen. It is part ofJakes boutique hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/feb/21/jamaica-farm-dining-treasure-beach>
, a stylish collection of cottages and villas popular with the boho set. The 
Jack Sprat Shack will be entirely solar powered and its guests will have access 
to most of the resort’s facilities – from a yoga deck with sea views to a 
waterside restaurant serving dishes made local produce and fresh-picked fruit.

Goli + Bosi, Split, Croatia

For most people, Split is the jumping-off point for the Dalmatian coast and 
Croatian archipelago. The Goli + Bosi hostel makes it worth adding a city stay 
to your trip. Looking out across Split’s crumbling terracotta rooftops from the 
hostel’s diminutive terrace, it’s hard to imagine that below is an ultra modern 
hostel – all clean white lines with cheery splashes of yellow. It’s clean, 
functional and contemporary rather than homely; downstairs has an urban feel, 
with a black-walled pizza and burger restaurant lit by bare bulbs.

Ipoh isn’t the best-known of Malaysia’s historic cities. Many tourists pass 
straight through en route to the Cameron Highlands, which makes the presence of 
this stark design-focused hostel more of a surprise. A former shop, the 
building has retained its industrial feel with bare concrete pillars, exposed 
beams and mesh screens. The furniture and fittings are as minimalist as the 
backdrop with mattresses set on wire bases, concrete basins and copper piping 
for showers and taps. The ground floor houses the best coffee shop in town.

All mid-century furniture and minimalist monochrome styling, We looks like 
it’s come straight from the pages of Wallpaper*, only with Lonely Planet 
prices. Dorms are pared down but come with a QR code by the door for accessing 
local guides, music playlists (including songs by local folk and hip hop 
musicians) and maps. Spacious communal areas in the early-20th-century mansion 
are furnished with old sideboards and stylish seating. The early part of the 
southern hemisphere spring brings longer days for exploring the leafy streets 
of the elegant Vila Mariana district, one of the city’s wealthiest areas.

Until recently backpackers on KS stayed in unremarkable three-stars or basic 
beach bungalows. Ibed is the town’s first proper hostel and a smart option that 
shares more with a four-star hotel than a hostel. The hulking modern building 
houses 38 cosy, curtained dorm beds, each with private TV, in scrupulously 
clean rooms, a short walk from the shore at Lamai. Its location means its quiet 
enough, but just moments away from the beach and booze vibe that makes KS a 
perennial autumn/winter sun favourite.

The Portuguese capital has more good-value hostels than most southern European 
cities, which makes it an excellent spot for an affordable autumn break – and 
it stays warm into October. The two-year old Home Hostel has been voted one of 
the world’s best, and it’s not hard to see why – handy location in the central 
Baixa region, hotel-like amenities including free breakfasts and a lovely 
restaurant, and Mamma’s Dinner, overseen by the owner’s mother. The period 
features of the beautiful building chime well with the smartly renovated mixed- 
and single-sex dorm rooms where beds come with their own lights and under bed 
storage.

nod to the destination – free Malay cookies available all day and the lovely 
old building, once a meeting hall for migrants, is now a gathering point that 
shows artworks provided by local art therapy charities. Beds are pod-style, 
with curtains to pull across for more privacy.

Sunny until October, Tahoe is an underrated spot for an autumn escape. 
Basecamp is a new hotel five minutes from the water with a 
summer-camp-meets-posh-hotel vibe, and motel-like prices. Many of the bedrooms 
are private but find a group to go in on one of two shared rooms – sleeping six 
or eight, with wood cladding, oil lamps, smart beds and private balcony – and 
the price per person is hard to beat. Firepits and rooftop Jacuzzis add to the 
outdoor-luxury feel; the downside is that you can’t book the dorm rooms as an 
individual, only as a group.

Downtown Beds, Mexico City

Habita is well-established as Mexico’s most stylish hotel chain and its first 
hostel, in the capital’s Centro Histórico, reflects all the design details that 
have made its hotels so popular – heritage buildings, busy public areas, sleek

actually shares a building with one of the brand’s hotels, though its rooms are 
in the old service quarters of the 17th-century palace. Bunks are framed with 
lattice brickwork, the kitchen serves Mexican street snacks and “artisan” 
cocktails are served by the picturesque rooftop pool and in the garden. A new 
hostel in Oaxaca is in the pipeline.
