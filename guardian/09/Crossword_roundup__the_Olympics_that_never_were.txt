The news in clues

As Rio braces itself for life after the games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/21/rio-2016-olympic-games-brazil-legacy-party>
, where were the Olympic puzzles?

Nutmeg <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quiptic+profile/nutmeg> 
teased us witha puzzle 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=29443> in the 
Telegraph’s tricky Enigmatic Variations series titled Record Holders, but the 
record holders she had in mind were diarists both fictional (Adrian Mole; 
Charles Pooter) and factual (Anne Frank; Tony Benn). Ingenious setting, but no 
citius, altius or fortius.

And the only other references that I’ve noticed – let me know if I’ve missed 
some podium-worthy themed puzzles and we’ll list and link in the comments – are 
also in the Telegraph.One of the unnamed Saturday setters used 
<http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=29533> an athlete 
whose name is a regular word …

[ abbrev. for ‘second’ + piece of office machinery ]
[ S + PRINTER ]

24ac Ex-Olympic hurdler working classes at track maintains keen edge (5,6)
[ demographic grades for ‘working classes’ + abbrev. for railway ‘track’, both 
surrounding synonym for ‘keen’ + synonym for ‘edge’ ]
[ D,E + RY, both surrounding AVID + HEM ]

... all the way back, in fact, to Mexico 1968’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/apr/27/stunning-olympic-moments-david-hemery>
 DAVID HEMERY. But that seemed to be about it. Did setters presume that other 
setters would have bagsied the theme? Did exhaustion follow our having hosted 
the previous Olympiad? Was there a boycott ofthe charming people at the IoC

?

Latter patter

In the last roundup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/aug/08/crossword-roundup-a-lorra-lorra-anniversaries#comments>
, I suggested the setters were likewise taking a break from topical crosswords 
based on this year’s tumult. As if to gently upbraid me, we have had at least 
two more corking political puzzles. If you haven’t yet tackledJulius’s witty FT 
puzzle 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/027911ec-5dbe-11e6-bb77-a121aa8abd95.pdf>
, you should do so now.

And in the Independent 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160809#!201608>
, Hob featured the main players in our current geopolitical drama, along with a 
nonce word ...

11ac E.g. Boris the Boy King, one at time of pregnancy getting end away (10) 
[ short version of a male name (as might be assigned to a boy) + Latin for 
‘king’ + Roman numeral for ‘one’ + term for a period of pregnancy missing its 
final letter (‘getting end away’) ]
[ REG + REX + I + TERM missing final letter ]
[ REG + REX + I + TER ]

... one which I wager is unlikely to stick around for long because it’s just a

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for LORRA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/aug/08/crossword-roundup-a-lorra-lorra-anniversaries#comments>
. I enjoyed the salacious (HipsterPriest’s “Bachelor ratbag had many on blind 
date”; Alberyalbery’s “Loads of oral with right mess”), the scurrilous 
(Poorsub’s “Loads in Liverpool off the back of a lorry – dubiously”) and the 
evocative (Brigster’s “Ample scouse bishop blocking leave of absence”).

The runners-up are Magumboots’ terse “Masses held in Heswall or Raby” and 
Bingybing’s match report “Good grief, Gunners get a hatful at Anfield”; the 
winner is Schroduck cryptic recipe “Scouse: plenty of lamb and onions first, 
then peeled carrot and potato going to pot”.
