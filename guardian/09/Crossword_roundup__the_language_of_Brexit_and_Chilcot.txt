The news in clues

What would the direct equivalent be to the ambiguous referendum puzzle by 
Boatman and Crew 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/jun/24/crossword-blog-boatmans-referendum-puzzle>
: a puzzle regarding the ultimate “long read”, the Chilcot report? A grid 
designed to contain2.6m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/we-need-your-help-reporting-on-chilcot>
 entries? A set of clues that couched their damning meaning in diplomatic 
wordplay? What we had on Wednesday wasa superb Independent cryptic by Knut 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20160706#!201607>
.

Once you’ve solved it, I’m certain you’ll agree that it deftly mixed on-topic 
entries such as RUSH TO WAR and SEXED-UP with poignant analysis, such as this 
pair of clues ...

23ac Put in family member no longer left standing (10)
[ PUT inside ‘family member’, without abbrev. for ‘left’ ]
[ PUT inside RELATION, minus L ]

28ac Nattiest dresser’s last to go out like this! (2,7)
[ anagram (‘to go out’) of NATTIEST with last letter of DRESSER ]
[ anagram of NATTIESTR ]

... for REPUTATION, IN TATTERS.

Latter patter

Last year, we pondered whether GREXIT was a term that would stick around 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/jul/13/crossword-blog-do-you-solve-old-puzzles>
. It is perhaps more likely to now. But the word it inspired, already a shoo-in 
for any anglophone dictionary’s word of 2016 award, has far surpassed it. Oxford
reckons <http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/brexit> it was 
coined as BRIXIT, presumably inthis 2012 Economist piece 
<http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2012/06/britain-and-eu-0>; others have 
pointed at this tweet ...

... although it’s certainly clear that the Economist piece had more reach and 
put BRIXIT on more lips. What language has Chilcot gifted us?

Appropriately for a report about a war steeped in euphemism (“conflict”, 
“regime change”, the “chaff” of David Kelly, “rendition” and of course 
“sexed-up”), Chilcot has given us some brand-new ways of describing some 
age-old things, notably “a very long way from success” (a cataclysm) and 
“presented with a certainty that was not justified” (you know what that means). 
Perhaps the name of the report will itself become a euphemism for euphemistic 
excoriation, which brings us to our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue 
CHILCOT?
