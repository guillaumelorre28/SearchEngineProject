The news in clues

Following last week’s addition (on the use of cricket lingo) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/nov/16/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-howzat#comments>
 to ourCryptics for Beginners series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners>
,here’s a supremely leather-and-willow puzzle 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20151112>
 from Knut in the Independent.

The surface readings demonstrate some more words that solvers need to remember 
might have a sporting sense ...

26ac One on board in international trial (4,3)
[ an achievement that would be marked on the scoreboard in a Test match ]

... like the “test” of TEST RUN and ...

7d More wide, perhaps (5)
[ what a “wide” is an example of ]

... the word EXTRA. The whole puzzle comes highly recommended; even if you’re 
not a cricket buff, it’s witty and it marks an event from September with a 
supremely personal touch.

Latter patter

 Here’s a modern phrase, used in a puzzle by Vlad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26732#25-across> ...

25ac Bugged car so there’s no privacy from the outset, right — with this (8,7)
[ anagram of CARSOTHERESNO with first letter of “privacy” and abbreviation for 
“right” ]
[ anagram of CARSOTHERESNOPR ] 

... a SNOOPERS’ CHARTER. At least I thought it was new. Nowadays, it’s used to 
describe the draft communications data bill. I became aware of it when it was 
used to describe its predecessor, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, 
back when internet service providers were a little more robust.

As it turns out though, the phrase goes back at least as far as 1957. Lord 
Lucas of Chilworth took a look at the cinematograph films bill, which wanted to 
levy charges from cinemas to fund British films, train young people and the 
like. He spotted a clause which allowed “the Commissioners of Customs and 
Excise” to require cinema owners to furnish “returns or other information as 
may be so specified”, anddidn’t like what he saw 
<http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1957/feb/05/cinematograph-films-bill-hl>
:

I hope the noble lord will do something for me here, because subsection (1) of 
clause 4 seems to me to be a 100% snoopers’ charter.

And this was merely the prospect of the taxman keeping paper records relating 
to the business of cinema owners. Imagine what Lord Lucas of Chilworth would 
make ofconstant surveillance of all our communications 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/may/27/snoopers-charter-business-public-communications-data>
. This brings us to our next challenge, which is derived from the Greek ὀπτικόν.


If that’s not enough to identify the word, it was originally used to describe 
a wholesome variety of the peep show that offered views of European capitals; 
but for Jeremy Bentham, it described his ideal kind of prison, where all 
inmates could be seen at all times.


Such a penitentiary was planned for Millbank in 1794; nowadays, there would be 
no need for a physical site. Reader, how would you clue PANOPTICON?


The Annotated Alex

Across at Alex Bellos’s Monday puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/series/alex-bellos-monday-puzzle>, there’s 
a different kind of crossword.
 Self-enumerating crossword 
There are no clues. Instead, there’s a rule for what form the entries take:

Each of the six vertical and six horizontal entries gives you the number of 
times a letter is used in the puzzle, and is of the form:
[NUMBER][SPACE][LETTER](S)

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for MANSPLAIN 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/nov/09/james-bond-the-spy-who-crosswords-love>
, a new term that doesn’t seem to have quite established consensus on what part 
of speech it is.

I enjoyed a couple of cameos: Peshwari’s spooky “Spin Alan around to follow 
spy chief’s talk, specially for women” and DameSweeneyEggblast’s lurid “MP in 
Alan’s bizarre male sex lesson”.

And for offbeat clueing, there was some misleading spacing from Ojisan with 
“Tell the little woman about inconsequential stupid plans”; just a pair of 
definitions in jonemm’s “Masculine condescension (that means when a man is 
talking down to you luv)” and Diplocaulobium didn’t stray far from the entry in 
the wordplay of “Ego is evident in man’s plan to set her straight”.

The runners-up are ID2155366’s “Lianna has PMS trouble. Go on – tell her all 
about it” and TwoDarrinStephens’ “A condescending way to describe Sarkozy, 
perhaps: small and simple”; the winner is Truth101 (who also offered “The 
Descent of Man?”) with a sneakily forgivable definition-by-example in 
“Unhelpfully advise Sarah Palin’s man to reform”.
