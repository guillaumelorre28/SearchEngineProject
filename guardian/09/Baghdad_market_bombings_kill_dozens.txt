Two bombs claimed by Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> 
have killed at least 28 people and injured at least 54 in central Baghdad, 
according to police and medical officials. The attack happened as fighting 
intensified in the northern city of Mosul, where government forces are 
attempting to expel the jihadis from their last major stronghold in Iraq.


The blasts, reportedly the work of suicide bombers, tore through a busy market 
in district of al-Sinak on Saturday, police said.

A pro-Isis news agency said the attackers had targeted Shia Muslims. Isis has 
continued to launch attacks in the heavily fortified capital, even after losing 
most of the northern and western territory it seized in 2014.

The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for Isis’s self-styled 
caliphate, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a 
guerrilla-style insurgency inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> and 
plotting or inspiring attacks on the west. The second phase of a US-backed 
offensive on the city, launched on Thursday following weeks of deadlock, has 
encountered fierce resistance.

Conventional US forces deploying more extensively in this phase are now 
visible very close to the front lines.

The third day of the renewed push saw heavy clashes on the south-eastern and 
northern fronts. An elite interior ministry unit continued to push through the 
Intisar district, where a US-trained army unit had struggled to advance after 
entering the south-east district last month.

A Reuters cameraman said heavy gunfire was audible and attack helicopters 
fired overhead as hundreds of civilians fled from their homes. In the north, a 
separate army unit pressed towards the border of Mosul after recapturing 
several outlying villages in the past two days.

“There is a battle in Argoob area, which is considered the gateway to Hadba,” 
Lt Col Abbas al-Azawi said by phone, referring to a strategic northern 
neighbourhood.

Since the offensive began on 17 October, elite forces have retaken a quarter 
of Mosul in the biggest ground operation there since the 2003 US-led invasion 
that toppled Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has 
said the group would be driven out of the country by April.

Although the militants are vastly outnumbered, they have embedded themselves 
among Mosul’s residents, hindering Iraqi forces who are trying to avoid 
civilian casualties. Despite food and water shortages, most civilians have 
stayed in their homes.

One resident reached by phone late on Friday said a rocket had landed on a 
house in the eastern Mithaq district, killing six members of one family. “We 
have not seen Daesh since the Iraqi forces restarted their offensive,” he said. 
“We hear the sounds of large car bombs. Today I heard no fewer than 10 huge 
explosions.”
