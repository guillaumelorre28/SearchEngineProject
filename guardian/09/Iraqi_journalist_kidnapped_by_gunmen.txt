Gunmen have kidnapped an Iraqi journalist after posing as members of the 
security forces and bursting into her home in Baghdad, according to authorities.

Afrah Shawqi Hammudi was abducted on Monday at about 10pm (1900 GMT) from her 
home in a southern neighbourhood of the capital, said Ziad al-Ajili, the head 
of the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory.

“Eight armed men burst into her house in Saidiya dressed in plain clothes and 
entered by pretending to belong to the security forces,” he told Agence 
France-Presse. “They tied up her son and stole mobile phones, computers and 
cash before kidnapping Afrah and fleeing.”

The report was confirmed by a source in Iraq’s interior ministry who spoke on 
condition of anonymity.

Hammudi, 43, is employed by Asharq al-Awsat, a London-based pan-Arab 
newspaper, as well as a number of news websites, including Aklaam. On Monday, 
she published a stinging article on the website in which she hit out at the 
armed groups that “act with impunity” inIraq

The prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, condemned her abduction and ordered the 
security services to do their utmost to find her and track down those 
responsible.

Iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. 
Seven were killed in the country in 2016, the press freedom group Reporters 
Without Borders said last week.
