The organisation said it had apologised and made an “appropriate payment”, 
adding that the musician and her entourage “did not in any way fix, contrive or 
improperly influence the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect” of 
qualifying races in Slovenia.

Vanessa-Mae, 37, finished last in 67th place in the giant slalom event in 
Sochi, representing Thailand, but was initially banned for four years after the 
International Ski Federation panel ruled that results in the hastily arranged 
qualifying races, in January 2014 in Slovenia, were manipulated.

Vanessa-Mae was successful in her appeal to the court of arbitration for sport

 last year, and the International Olympic Committee decided not to annul her 
result. She returned to competitive skiing in March, and is now set to attempt 
to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Speaking in January, when the IOC confirmed her Sochi 2014 result would stand, 
she told the BBC: “I was so relieved to have completed both runs at the Winter 
Olympics, even if it was only to claim last place. I’m over the moon that I’m 
still an Olympian – it’s fantastic news and such a positive start to 2016.”
