 Despite five visits from President Bill Clinton, Israeli-Syrian negotiations 
on a land-for-peace treaty appeared to be nearing a close yesterday without 
even a tentative agreement.
Preparing to return home from the US today, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud 
Barak, described the week-long, US-mediated talks on territory, peace, water 
and security as "complex and difficult".

Diplomatic sources said Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, was likely 
to follow tomorrow.

On the sensitive issue of establishing a new border once Israel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> pulls back on the Golan Heights, 
Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, said: "Nothing has been agreed upon."

Yet the talks were reported to have surmounted a hurdle when a "borders" 
committee - on charting Israeli withdrawal - met yesterday for the first time.

Mr Clinton intervened in the talks four times before yesterday. "He's going 
for meetings. The process continues," a White House official said.

The state department spokesman, James Rubin, said the two sides responded 
positively to a statement presented by the US on Friday. The seven-page summary 
of points of accord and discord could become the basis for an eventual core 
agreement, he said. But Israel and Syria still faced "enormous decisions".

Lower-level Israeli and Syrian officials were expected to remain, but Mr Rubin 
said there was no decision on how their talks would proceed. AP
