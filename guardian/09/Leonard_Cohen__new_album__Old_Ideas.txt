Leonard Cohen has released his first new song since 2004, taken from his 
forthcoming albumOld Ideas <http://www.leonardcohen.com/ca/oldideas>. Show Me 
the Place is one of 10 tracks that will appear on the LP, due 31 January.

It seems Cohen has not traded in his famous blue raincoat. Show Me the Place 
shows all the hallmarks of his latest music, especially 2004's Dear Heather: 
synth strings, keening backing vocals, Cohen's baritone moan. It's a religious 
song typical of "[Cohen's] most overtly spiritual" record, according to a press 
release. "The album's 10 songs poetically address some of the most profound 
quandaries of human existence â€“ the relationship to a transcendent being, love, 
sexuality, loss and death."

Cohen had lots of time to consider these issues during his comeback world 
tour, from early 2008 to late last year. Two songs, Lullaby and Darkness, were 
performed during these dates, while other tracks were "in the works for years". 
Recording did not take place until January 2011, but Cohen had help from a 
broad range of producers. These include the 77-year-old's partner, singer 
Anjani Thomas, Cohen's touring saxophonist, Dino Soldo, the Fugs' Ed Sanders, 
and veteran producer Patrick Leonard, known for his role on Madonna's Like a 
Prayer and La Isla Bonita.

The artwork for Old Ideas was designed by Cohen, incorporating several of his 
drawings. One of these sketches is included as a numbered lithograph in the
deluxe version of the album

, now available for pre-order.

Old Friends will be Cohen's 12th studio album.
