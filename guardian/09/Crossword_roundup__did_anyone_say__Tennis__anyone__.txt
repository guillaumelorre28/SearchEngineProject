The news in clues

Towards the end of June, some solvers keep an eye on the Financial Times, 
hoping to see one of the sporadic appearances of the setter Courtier. He wasn’t 
with us last year, buthe was this time 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/ab7e18b2-146f-11e5-9bc5-00144feabdc0.pdf>
. If clues like this one ...

5ac The starting point in court proceedings (8)
[ cryptic definition ]

... for BASELINE didn’t give away the theme, then the appearance of names ...

19d A leading racketeer who dined with the Queen a couple of times (7)
[ synonym for ‘dined’ + abbrev. for ‘the Queen’, twice ]
[ FED + ER + ER ]

... such as FEDERER made the dropshot drop. Courtier’s identity was revealed a 
few years agoat solvers’ blog Fifteen Squared 
<http://www.fifteensquared.net/2011/06/28/financial-times-13731-courtier/#comment-162748>
:

Courtier is happy to be revealed as John Barrett, Davis Cup and Wimbledon 
player in the 1950s and 1960s, TV commentator for the BBC and other networks, 
now retired, author of several books on tennis and for many years the FT’s 
tennis correspondent.

Tennis is a language with its own language, baffling to the newcomer; the 
crossword solver needs mainly to remember that ‘love’ in a clue might indicate 
an O (via zero). But compared to other sports, it has contributed little to the 
language as a whole. I reckonbasketball’s MY BAD 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/nov/26/crossword-roundup-whose-bad>
 may outlive tennis’s YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS.

The stars of the game, of course, are further immortalised in rhyming slang: 
if you had spent your ARTHUR ASHE on getting a bit ADRIAN QUIST, you might need 
to take a PAT CASH in a nearby ILIE NASTASIE, possibly using your BORIS BECKER 
(depending on gender), all of which can be decoded in Partridge’s Dictionary of 
Slang and Unconventional English.

And then there’s a mysterious, elusive phrase. In 1957, Alistair Cooke wrote 
in this paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/century/1950-1959/Story/0,,105487,00.html>: 

Thirty years ago, towards the end of the first act of one of those footling 
country-house comedies that passed in the 1920s for social satire, a juvenile 
in an Ascot and a blue blazer loped through the french windows and tossed off 
the immortal invitation: ‘Tennis, anyone?’

The actor in question is Humphrey Bogart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/humphreybogart>, whose roles would presently 
place him in a world characterised by another kind of racketeering. Without 
wishing to undermine Mr Cooke, Bogart is, from “Play it again, Sam” to “Drop 
the gun, Louie”, one of the most misquoted actors of the golden age of 
Hollywood.William Safire recalled asking Bogey about it in the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/magazine/on-language-drop-the-gun-louie.html?pagewanted=2&pagewanted=all>
:

I had just turned 21 years old, but my bosses had taught me enough about 
reporting to cause me to put the question to the source directly: did he, 
Humphrey Bogart, ever use the words ‘Tennis, anyone?’ on stage? His unequivocal 
reply: ‘The lines I had were corny enough, but I swear to you, never once did I 
have to say Tennis, anyone?’

Unfortunately, Bogey also told other people that he did say it, so it’s one of 
those quotations. No one seems to have found “Tennis, anyone?” or indeed 
“Anyone for tennis?” in a script (though Shaw’s Misalliance has “Anybody on for 
a game of tennis?” and Somerset Maugham’s The Circle has a character called 
Teddie appear in flannels with the line “I say, what about this tennis?”).

Much more obliging, for the origin of the word that makes up our next challenge
is Elisabeth Beresford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/26/elisabeth-beresford-obituary>
:

My daughter Kate came up to me and said, ‘Ma, isn’t it great on Wombledon 
Common’ and I thought, that’s it, that’s where the Wombles come from.

It’s actually not a million miles from the old name, Wimbedounyng

; so, reader: how would you clue WOMBLE?

semi-clothed” were all lovely, and the phrase lent itself to such unexpected 
anagrams asalberyalbery
