The news in clues

750th anniversaries don’t come around very often. When they do, they should be 
cherished, if possible, in cryptic form. Io – known locally asEnigmatist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/13/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-enigmatist>
 – gave me the opportunity to do just that ina Financial Times puzzle 
<http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/723ae784-f371-11e4-8141-00144feab7de.pdf>
. A pair of neighbouring down clues gave the theme:

19d Long to drink Beaujolais, possibly the best (6)
[ synonym for ‘long’ (as in yearn) containing what Beaujolais is an example of 
]
[ DIE surrounding VIN ] 

16d Form of entertainment served up in illusory democracy (6)
[ part of ‘illusory democracy’, reading ‘upwards’ ]
[ YDEMOC backwards ]

Yes, the DIVINE COMEDY poet and star of four down, DANTE, would have been 750 
this year. The puzzle gave all the thematic material you’d expect of Io: 
HEAVEN, PURGATORY, HELL (plus its synonyms DIS and INFERNO), VIRGIL and so on. 
It also had a related crosswords-about-crosswords gag in these clues ...

6d Demanding large starters make cook fry bacon and black ginger? (6)
[ what cook, fry, bacon and black are examples of when first letter 
capitalised ]
[ first name of a well-known Cook, Fry, Bacon and Black ]

8d Taking the second note needs quite a bit of paper (6)
[synonym for ‘needs’ without the name of the second do-re-mi note ]
[ REQUIRES without RE ]

... since adding ROGERS to QUIRES gives you Roger Squires 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/feb/22/meet-the-setter-rufus>
, who sets for this paper as Rufus, but can also be found in the FT using a 
name inspired bya fellow magician <http://www.kingofmagicians.com/>. He’s 
another DANTE.

It’s a puzzle so rich that barely any setter could have caught all the detail. 
Roger Squire’s wife is present, for example, and three further clues gave YORK, 
KNAVES and MIRE. If the relevance of that escapes you, then wait until you hear 
that the topical peg for the puzzle was not that 750th anniversary, butthe 
first day of the Dante Festival at Knavesmire in York

... a cryptic definition of SELFIE STICK. Spare some fellow feeling for the 
lexicographer who has to pin down what SELFIE means.

Pinning down the earliest use is tricky enough: for a while, the tale was told 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/10459115/Australian-man-invented-the-selfie-after-drunken-night-out.html>
 that ‘selfie’ was coined by an accident-prone Australian to describe a picture 
taken of a facial injury incurred while drunk. The Australian in question, one 
“Hopey”, had indeed used the termin an online forum in 2002 
<http://www2b.abc.net.au/science/k2/stn/archives/archive32/newposts/169/topic169861.shtm>
 – but Hopey was happy todisappoint reporters 
<http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/11/22/selfie_etymology_an_australian_man_takes_a_photo_of_his_lip_after_falling.html>
:

It was not a word I coined. It’s something that was just common slang at the 
time, used to describe a picture of yourself. Fairly simple.

But is it that simple?

It would appear not. 

If a selfie can be taken by someone else, what makes it a selfie? Is it to do 
with the image: the type of camera, the background, and its being a portrait? 
Is it to do with the intention: to document the presence of the subject, or to 
capture a moment in his or her life? Or should we be thinking about the age of 
the subject, and/or his or her level of comfort with the counterintuitive?

Or some muzzy cloud of all of those? How glad I am that all this is (to use a 
clearer coinage)nomfup

. As for the sticks, I presume they will always be called selfie sticks, 
whatever they’re used to capture. Personally, I prefer the Swedish EGOBILD; you 
may go for thefacetious 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/business/media/selfies-on-a-stick-and-the-social-content-challenge-for-the-media.html?_r=0>
 NARCISSISTICK. I’m also taken with the developing terminology for the various 
types of gurning which selfie-subjects use to conceal chins and/or appear happy.

Oxford Dictionaries mentions 
<http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2014/11/selfie-one-year/> the exaggerated 
pout of a DUCK FACE and what they describe as “a wide-eyed look combined with 
slightly pursed lips”.

Reader, how would you clue SPARROW FACE?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for TORY 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/may/12/crossword-roundup-turncoats-brigands-and-kippers#show-all>
. It was an opportunity for some eye-wateringly topical surfaces, such as 
yungylek’s “Fudged majority? Not half!”, ixioned’s “Cameron’s party: my, it’s 
bolder without the pesky Lib Dems” and newmarketsausage’s ominous “Hear nothing 
will stop George Osborne”.

Audacity City was well-populated this week, with ketmando’s substitution 
cipher in “Swing of six points to the right makes Nils a member” and Neijygof’s 
use of “proto-capitalist” to suggest that you do with “Proto-capitalist fox 
hunt burns heath with brazier: parish may grant sturdy young shepherd cash for 
major party” what I did with the ROGERS clue above. Andyknott was relatively 
on-the-nose with “Rightwing zealot, pro nuclear energy”.

Understandably, some clues strayed close to abuse. I’m thinking of ID2155366’s 
“It’s truly rotten having him back”, robinjohnson’s “Eton-centric and really 
heartless”, phitonelly’s “Rubbish returned. Why?” and Truth101’s terse “Blue 
tit”.

The runners-up are JollySwagman’s “Blue blood essentially wants to cut tax” 
and harlobarlo’s “From the heart of Eton, extremely reactionary politician”; 
the winner is jonemm’s fine summary: “Blue triumphs, ousting Red and Yellow 
leaders”.

Kudos to Jon; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

vice versa, andScrew managed both in five words
