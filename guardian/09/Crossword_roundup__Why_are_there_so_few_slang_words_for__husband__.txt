The news in clues

What’s your favourite part of the Proms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/proms-2015>? Not the Last Night, obviously, 
but if it’s not one of the staples of the schedule, perhaps it’s the
experimental evenings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/11/wireless-nights-prom-jarvis-cocker-review-royal-albert-hall-london>
, or the 20-odd-minutetalks and chats 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06384s5/episodes/player> on such subjects as 
Elgar’s relationship with bicycles <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pmhl7>?

For me, it’s the near-institution of the Guardian’s proms puzzle from Crucible 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/crucible> (who has taken part in one of 
our Q&As 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/jun/23/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-crucible>
).

This year’s <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/26675> was another 
treat, with its musical clues sending that cycling Elgar to the insalubrious 
destination ...

8ac Is Elgar distracted by love in rooms for wags? (8)
[ anagram of ISLEGAR + ‘love’ in tennis ]
[ SERAGLI + O ]

... of a SERAGLIO (as featured in Prom 39 
<http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/2015/prom-39-mozart-the-abduction-from-the-seraglio/>
) and a clue ...


1d Note: Brahms overture always turns up (5)
[ first letter (‘overture’) of ‘Brahms’ + reversed synonym for ‘always’ ]
[B + backwards EVER ]

... for BREVE which was borne out by, among others, Prom 62 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e9nrzc#b0680xc0>. The annotated solution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2015/sep/18/annotated-solutions-for-prize-26675>
 for this prize puzzle is now available.

Latter patter

Under a different nom de guerre, the same setter had an elusive, allusive 
definition in the Independent:

16ac Sexist’s wife here lives around New Cross, facing west (7)
[ synonym for ‘lives’, surrounding abbrev. for ‘new’ + reversed synonym for 
‘cross’ ]
[ IS, containing N + backwards ROOD ]

Yes, Radian was looking for INDOORS, as in the unflattering uxorial monicker 
HER (or indeed ‘ER) INDOORS. Oxford’s first citation of the phrase is from 1979:

That’s what her indoors doesn’t understand Terry. A young bird keep[s] you 
feeling young.

Yes, the Terry is Terry McCann, and the wisdom-imparter is Arthur Daley: it’s 
from episode three of the first series ofMinder

In fact, it seems that it was Minder that took the phrase (along with “drink” 
for bribe) into wide usage, though the writer Leon Griffiths said he had heard 
it from the lips of “a taxi-driver drinking companion”. (When George Cole died,
one report 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3187442/The-family-rift-haunted-Arfur-Daley-Given-away-mother-George-Cole-adored-public-never-got-daughter-rejected-him.html>
 claimed that Prince Philip, a fan of the show, has a cushion with the motto E 
II R INDOORS.)

The lexicon was not short of words for “wife” in 1979, even if ones like 
WHITHER-GO-YE had passed away – but it gained another. It remains a mystery to 
me whether the relative scarcity in dictionaries of slang expressions, fond or 
derisory, for “husband” is down to there not being many or their not being 
recorded.

Of those I know, I like the recent TELLYTUBBY, but not nearly so much as 
UMBRELLA, as cited in Partridge’s Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional 
English. Before I realised that it, like TELLYTUBBY, was rhyming slang, I 
thought it had a note of fond dismissiveness; perhaps it still does, but the 
word it rhymes with is the subject of our next challenge. Reader, how would you 
clue FELLA?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for CACK-HANDED 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/sep/14/crossword-roundup-corbynism-labour-leader>
. I enjoyed the spoonerisms, like alberyalbery’s “Clumsy journalist and honest 
spooning” – so much classier thanthe same reader’s reference to my smalls 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/59457719>, though it’s 
Ojisan who gets the audacity award for “And he’d be inept?”

The letters proved more promising than I’d thought for anagrams, such as 
Peshwari’s “Flipping heck! Dad can be clumsy” and Clueso’s “Clumsy? Desperate 
Dan? Check The Dandy first for the answer!”

The runners-up are ousgg’s stark “Liable to drop one, as you might be in the 
absence of toilet paper”, and steveran’s smooth “Incompetent motion gets 
passed”; the winner is JollySwagman’s topical “It’s about Corbyn’s leadership – 
grand given Ed’s performance?”

Kudos to Swagman; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

We’re back in Elgar’s seraglio for the surface reading of this clue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26684> from Picaroon (here’s 
his Q&A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/nov/03/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-picaroon>
) in which the definition and the word indicating an anagram are devilishly 
disguised ...

8d Where City workers look for sex and hire models (5,5)
[ anagram (‘models’) of SEXANDHIRE ]

... and point our direction away from the SHARE INDEX. Bonuses all round?
