The case of Elor Azaria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/04/israeli-soldier-guilty-manslaughter-shooting-palestinian-elor-azaria-abdel-fattah-al-sharif>
 – the “Hebron shooter” – has cast a long shadow over Israel over the past 10 
months. The baby-faced, diminutive soldier who fatally shot a wounded 
Palestinian attacker in the head exposed multiple faultlines in a country that 
itself seemed at times to be on trial.

For the military, whose senior officers pushed for a prosecution, the case and 
the international attention that it drew appeared clear cut from the beginning, 
not least with the threat of action againstIsrael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> in the international criminal court.

Commenting after Azaria’s conviction for manslaughter, the military prosecutor 
Nadav Weisman reiterated this point, saying the verdict was “important, clear, 
decisive and speaks for itself”.

For the right, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who 
wavered between condemning Azaria’s acts in the immediate aftermath and phoning 
his family, Azaria represented something else: an object of sympathy.

His supporters relentlessly played up the image of Azaria, who was often 
pictured in court with his mother’s arms around him, not just as a son but as a 
young and immature soldier who could have been any Israeli’s child.

It was a representation rejected by the Israeli army’s chief of staff, Gadi 
Eisenkot, speaking at a conference the day before the verdict.

“An 18-year-old man serving in the army is not ‘everyone’s child’,” Eisenkot 
commented sharply. “He is a fighter, a soldier, who must dedicate his life to 
carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this.”

The three-judge military panel also rejected the idea. “One cannot use this 
type of force, even if we’re talking about an enemy’s life,” said the presiding 
judge Maya Heller, reiterating a key principle of human rights law in conflict.

Instead, the judgment made clear Azaria was a serial liar who changed his 
stories about the circumstances of the killing on multiple occasions. His 
defence team – as the judges pointed out – were little better in arranging 
their case.

So confident were they that he would be viewed as the victim, they did not 
even bother squaring the many glaring and impossible contradictions in their 
defence, which were pulled apart in the judgment.

Accusing his commanders, politicians and even the judges of bias, their 
narrative was one that has become familiar among Israel’s vocal right and far 
right: that they are the perpetual victims, of the left, the media, human 
rights groups and international opinion.

Despite appeals from some politicians to keep the verdict “out of the 
political arena”, far-right ministers in Netanyahu’s coalition immediately 
demanded a pardon for Azaria, with the culture minister, Miri Regev, telling 
Israeli television the soldier should not have faced a criminal trial. Where 
they led, Netanyahu followed and on Wednesday evening joined calls for a 
pardon. “The soldiers of the IDF are our sons and daughters, and they need to 
remain above dispute,” he said in a statement.

The question now is what the verdict will mean. A pardon remains a possibility.

Human rights groups were quick to point out that the focus on Azaria masked a 
wider problem of impunity.

Welcoming the verdict, Sari Bashi, the Israel advocacy director at Human 
Rights Watch, said: “Today’s conviction is a positive step toward reining in 
excessive use of force by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians.”

Amnesty said the conviction offered “a glimmer of hope that soldiers who 
commit unlawful killings may no longer go unpunished”.

But despite the conviction, other questions have not been addressed: why, for 
instance, was no medical aid given to the badly wounded Abdel Fattah al-Sharif?

Indeed, why did no medical personnel approach the wounded and incapacitated 
Sharif apart from Azaria, a military medic, whose duty should have been to 
deliver aid but who instead had in mind to kill him?
