A British man has been found dead in the French Alps following the first night 
of the Oxford and Cambridge universities’ ski trip.

The 22-year-old, who has yet to be publicly identified, was confirmed dead by 
police after he was found unconscious in a holiday flat in the ski resort of 
Val Thorens on Sunday morning.

Thousands of Oxbridge students arrived at the French ski resort, the highest in
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, at the weekend but 
officers did not confirm if he attended either university.

According to a Swiss newspaper, Le Matin, the man’s friends were unable to 
revive him after finding him at about 8am on Sunday, prompting them to call the 
emergency services. Paramedics were also unable to save him and he is suspected 
of having suffered a heart attack. Gendarmes have said an autopsy will be 
carried out later in the week.

It is understood that he had arrived in Val Thorens by coach with a group of 
friends from the UK on Saturday.

The annual varsity trip is a fixture on the social calendars of both 
universities, with publicity for this year’s event billing it as the biggest 
ski party in the world. Its advertising reads: “Those lucky enough to attend 
can ski all day on the slopes of one of the best ski areas in the world, and 
party all night.”

A spokesman for Nuco Travel, which organised this year’s event, told the 
Varsity student newspaper that “sadly one of our passengers passed away on 
Sunday 4th December 2016. At this time, to respect their family’s and friends’ 
privacy, we will not be commenting further.”

The first varsity ski trip was held in Switzerland in 1922 and attracts more 
than 3,000 young people a year, with a standard self-catering package costing 
£339.
