The news in clues

If you first joined us last week for the “drugs” instalment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/dec/14/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-drugs>
 in ourCryptics for Beginners series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners>
, good news! For this is the ideal time of year to buy a bundle of broadsheets 
and become addicted to cryptics.


There are plenty of gentler puzzles around, you may have more time and a more 
freely associating brain to ponder them – and, best of all, there are themes 
and topical references.

By topical, I mean seasonal; these range from upfront single clues, such as 
this from Chifonie <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26750#7-down>
 ...

7d House name put up for Christmas (4)
[ a zodiac house + abbrev. for ‘name’, all written upwards ]
[ LEO + N, reversed ] 

... for NOEL, to more baroque fare, such as this Independent puzzle by Phi 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20151218>
, which you might apparently complete, noticing nothing unusual, and only 
later, from a distance, garner its peripheral extra festivities.

Clueing coincidence

Also of interest to beginners might be a little spot of jolly self-reference. 
Chifonie, again, offereda clue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26750#11-across> where most of 
the cryptic part was staring the solver in the face ...

11ac Puzzles about son’s dispute (5,6)
[ type of puzzle around abbreviation for ‘son’ ]
[ CROSSWORDS around S ]

... for the answer CROSS SWORDS. From his stablemate Picaroon, pleasingly, we 
combined those same worlds to different effect ina clue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26756#11-across> ...

11ac Battling with foremost of setters and their art (9)
[ first letter of SETTERS + word for ‘setters’ art’ ]
[ S + WORDPLAY ]

... for SWORDPLAY (incidentally, you can find out more about Picaroon’s 
philosophy of wordplay, if not swordplay,in this Q&A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/nov/03/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-picaroon>
).

So, en garde. The subject of our next challenge also combines the ideas of 
verbal sparring and actual, proper hurty violence. Like “riposte” (a 
counterattack made immediately after a successful parry), and what you might 
howl when the victim of one – “touché” – this is a fencing term that has 
emigrated from a kind of SWORDPLAY and now lives, often happier, as part of the 
language of WORDPLAY.


Apparently once “an answering thrust”, and in its modern sense defined in a 
bon mot dubiously attributed to Mark Twain as “something we think of 24 hours 
too late” – reader, how would you clue REPARTEE? (And would anyone like to make 
a case for the “reppar-TAY” pronunciation offeredhere 
<http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/repartee> but not here 
<http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/repartee>?)

Clueing competition

Many thanks for your clues for BOHO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/dec/07/crossword-roundup-did-a-puzzle-help-the-spy-george-blake-flee-to-russia#comments>
. There was something of the feeling of a Captain Swing / Arkansas Traveler in 
GeoScanner’s headlinesque “Itinerant worker spotted in Idaho boxcar” and 
mojoseeker’s disingenuous-sounding “New Jersey town has no knowledge of this 
traveller”.

The word offered ruder possibilities than I had foreseen, including Peshwari’s 
topical “Santa’s first word? Stink-bum”, gleety’s similarly stark “Prostitute 
smells like a tramp” and ousgg’s mindlessly Viz-ish and excellent “Bum hole – 
orifice blowing off endlessly”.

More refined surfaces included alberyalbery’s timely “Economic migrant has 
only beneficial objectives to start with” and cmiall’s plaintive “Who bombs 
without end a displaced people?”; culturally, the tone was further lifted by 
Clueso’s plausible “Covered by the Who, Bowie and one of the Drifters” and 
schroduck’s definition-in-the-middle “Swapping pencil leads would make this 
transient artistic style”.

The runners-up are ixioned’s devious down clue “A derelict building old boy, 
it denotes pain and sorrow” and steveran’s lewd “Cry of delight about grabbing 
a glimpse of builder’s bum”; the rare spoonerism winner is ComedyPseudonym’s 
delightful and effective “Spooner’s bohemian tramp”.

Kudos to whoever ComedyPseudonym really is; please leave new fortnight’s 
entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

Unastonishingly, Tim Moorey offered a masterclass in ingenuity, architecture 
and humour inhis final Sunday Times puzzle 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/b6649b054c37f1820151814fe6010411/print_solution/3>
. If you can get to a copy, you must solve it – and then you can come back and 
say whether you agree with my choice of ...

17ac Having taken Bush’s lead, former PM’s in retreat (4)
[ first letter of BUSH taken from name of a former prime minister ]
[ BLAIR minus B ]

... LAIR as the entry to be treasured. He will be missed. (I’m talking about 
Tim Moorey here, for the avoidance of doubt.)

Good/will
