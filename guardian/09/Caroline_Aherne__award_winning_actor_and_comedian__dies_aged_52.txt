Aherne created some of British comedy’s best-loved characters: lazy daughter 
Denise inThe Royle Family 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/23/how-we-made-the-royle-family>
, acerbic chat show host Mrs Merton – which first aired on BBC2 in 1995 – and 
memorable Fast Show characters such as the Checkout Girl and Poula Fisch, a TV 
weather girl in an unnamed country where the sun was always “scorchio!”

The Royle Family was created after she and friend Craig Cash, who played 
gormless Dave Best in the show, threw themselves into their work after a 
suicide attempt by Aherne, which she described as her lowest ebb. The show won 
four gongs at the 1999 BritishComedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy> Awards including best actress for 
Aherne.

The Mrs Merton Christmas Show won the best talk show Bafta in 1997, while The 
Royle Family collected best sitcom award in 2000 and 2007. Aherne was nominated 
for Baftas for her performance in both shows, as well as her directing of The 
Royle Family in 2001.

Tributes from those Aherne worked with have been flooding in.

Sue Johnston, who played Aherne’s character’s mother, Barbara, in The Royle 
Family, said: “I am devastated at her passing and I am numb with grief.”

Ralf Little, who starred alongside Aherne as brother Antony in the hit sitcom, 
tweeted:

Debbie McGee, the widow of magician Paul Daniels, said that Aherne’s death was 
“very sad news”. McGee was on the receiving end of one of Mrs Merton’s most 
famous lines, when she was asked in a 1995 episode: “What first attracted you 
to the millionaire Paul Daniels?”


McGee tweeted: “Just heard the very sad news about Caroline Aherne, she was 
wonderful especially as Mrs Merton. My interview will be a treasured memory 
RIP.”

BBC director general Tony Hall said: “She was a brilliant, award winning 
comedy writer and performer, much loved by audiences – especially for The Royle 
Family and Mrs Merton and for her wonderful voicing of many shows. Our thoughts 
are with her family and friends.”

Noel Gallagher of Oasis, whose song Half the World Away was used as The Royle 
Family’s theme tune, posted his tribute on Instagram.

The daughter of Irish immigrants Bert and Maureen, Aherne grew up on a council 
estate in Wythenshawe, Manchester, and her first job was answering phones at 
BBC offices in the city.

Both Aherne and her older brother Patrick were born with the rare form of 
retina cancer which she was treated for into her 20s. She then underwent 
treatment for bladder cancer, the same disease that later took the life of her 
boyfriend Matt Bower in 1997.

The actor’s illness first came to light in 2014 when she agreed to take part 
in an appeal in Manchester that was asking patients and carers to help improve 
standards of care. In pledging her support she said: “I’ve had cancer and my 
brother’s had cancer and we know how it affects people.”

Aherne, who had been a smoker, also spoke of her battles with depression and 
alcohol, following the breakdown of her marriage to former New Order member 
Peter Hook, the death of her father, and struggles with fame. She spent time at 
the Priory clinic before moving to Australia to escape the public eye.

She made her return to TV in 2014 as the narrator of popular Channel 4 show 
Gogglebox. She was forced to take time off from narrating the show earlier this 
year while she received treatment for the disease.
