The beginning of the year saw Rita Ora lambasted for showing too much cleavage 
on The One Show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/jan/08/complaints-rita-ora-cleavage-lead-to-cover-up-at-bbc-one-show>
 (as reported by the same publications that routinely publish entire articles 
about cleavage). Nigel Farage made a boob of himself bydemanding that 
breastfeeding mums should sit in the corner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/dec/05/nigel-farage-breastfeeding-mothers-corner-ukip-video>
, and the Sunsuccumbed to the No More Page 3 campaign 
<http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/01/23/sun-pr-head-dylan-sharpe-apologises-winking-page-3-return-tweet-which-saw-twitter>
 with all the grace of a toddler throwing a screaming tantrum.

February

The trailer for Magic Mike XXL gave columnists the opportunity to declare that 
“men are now objectified more than women 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11395576/Men-are-now-objectified-more-than-women.html>
”. Feminists might have responded with any one of a million recent examples 
suggesting otherwise, had they been able to stop laughing long enough.

March

Rachel Reeves threw the world into confusion and disarray when she said she 
wouldkeep her ministerial job if Labour were elected, despite being pregnant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/01/maternity-leave-not-all-women-are-created-equal>
.MPs fretted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/mar/13/seven-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-judging-a-pregnant-colleague>
 that she wouldn’t be able to give the job her “full attention” and columnists 
accused the “stupid woman” of treating motherhood like “a hobby” (unlike all 
those multitasking professional fathers).

general election. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian 
As the general election approached, the media decided the best way to critique 
female politicians’ policies was toPhotoshop their heads onto scantily clad 
models, create cartoons of their cleavage 
<http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity-interviews/elaine-c-smith-insists-nicola-5368543>
 and devotemore column inches to their shoes than their views 
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/focus/article1548641.ece>. Strangely, 
their male colleagues’ wardrobes went largely undiscussed.

May

EA Sports announced it would be adding women’s teams to its new Fifa video 
game and the male gamosphere went into ablind panic 
<https://twitter.com/EverydaySexism/status/603937660378488832>. Comments ranged 
from: “Don’t break my balls with this bullshit,” to the totally proportionate: 
“Women have ruined the earth and now they are ruining Fifa.”

June saw football frenzy continue with the advent of the Women’s World Cup, 
or, as I like to call it, the World Cup. The England team reached the 
semi-finals, despitepatronising twaddle such as the FA tweeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/06/england-women-twitter-world-cup-mothers-partners-daughters>
 “Our Lionesses go back to being mothers, partners and daughters today…” andone

: “A woman’s place is not on a foreign field playing second-rate football.”

July

Serena Williams triumphed at Wimbledon, overcoming not only her opponents but 
also a wave ofsexist and racist commentary 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3154121/The-bitter-cat-fight-tennis-One-s-human-volcano-s-ice-queen-loved-man-duel-Centre-Court-today-venomous-truth-Serena-Williams-Maria-Sharapova.html>
. Meanwhile, US Glamour magazine published amind-blowingly patronising article 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3177014/Glamour-magazine-fire-Twitter-misogynistic-list-revealing-13-things-make-man-fall-love-you.html>
 entitled: “13 Little Things That Can Make a Man Fall Hard for You”, including 
such gems as opening the door naked and letting him “solve your petty work 
problem”.

August

“Not doing enough housework is ‘making women fat’,” proclaimed the Daily Mail, 
inan ingenious headline 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3211814/Lack-housework-making-women-fat-time-working-time-scrubbing-contributed-obesity-crisis-study-claims.html>
 that managed to both put women down and put them in their place at the very 
same time.

September

As Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader, appointing Diane Abbott shadow 
secretary of state for international development, sexist jibes focused on their
past relationship 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11870739/Jeremy-Corbyn-and-Diane-Abbott-were-lovers.html>
. As one Twitter usersuccinctly pointed out 
<https://twitter.com/mitchbenn/status/644818739796537344>, “Abbott’s been WAY 
more famous than Corbyn the last 20 years but nobody’s suggesting HE shagged 
his way to prominence.”  
<https://twitter.com/mitchbenn/status/644818739796537344>Meanwhile, lawyer 
Charlotte Proudman waslabelled a feminazi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/01/feminazi-feminists-women-rights-feminism-charlotte-proudman>
 for outing sexist behaviour on LinkedIn.

October

The Spectator chose to proclaim feminism dead 
<http://new.spectator.co.uk/2015/10/the-decline-of-feminism/> a mere three days 
beforeFeminism in London <http://www.feminisminlondon.co.uk/>, the largest 
feminist conference in the capital with over 1,000 attendees. #Awkward

November

George Osborne mistook women for kittens when he tried to distract them from 
the fact that he wouldn’t axe the sexist tampon tax bydangling rape counselling 
services in front of them at the same time

 From a “Rape us now” sale slogan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/dec/08/rapenot-punchline-sell-christmas-presents-tasteless-advertising>
, to seasonal safety campaigns encouraging women to “know your limits 
<http://www.buryfreepress.co.uk/news/local/latest-news/norfolk-police-re-launch-rape-campaign-for-festive-season-1-7099372>
”, festive rape jokes and victim-blaming are already afoot. We’re waiting for 
the “Don’t rape” campaign that tells men to stay in well-lit areas, so lots of 
people can see them if they begin to act inappropriately, or to have a 
designated driver, who can make them leave immediately if they start harassing 
someone.

like peaches. This was stated to have occurred in November 2015 when it
