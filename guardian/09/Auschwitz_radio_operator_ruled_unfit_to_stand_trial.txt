said on Friday that the woman, identified only as Helma M, was almost blind and 
deaf, and that a serious illness this year had left her physically, mentally 
and emotionally unfit to be put on trial.

In June a German court sentenced Hanning to five years in prison after it 
branded him a “willing and efficient henchman” in the Holocaust and convicted 
him of being an accessory to the murder of at least 170,000 people.

 The trials are likely to be Germany’s last linked to the Holocaust, when the 
Nazis killed more than 6 million people, mostly Jews.
