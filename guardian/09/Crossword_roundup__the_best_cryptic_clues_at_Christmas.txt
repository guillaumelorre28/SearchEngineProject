The news in clues

Around this time of year, crossword setters furnish us not just with puzzles 
but also with seasonal references and even, through allusion and reference, a 
festive playlist.

 Another answer in musical form 
And the least cockle-warming allusion so far is surely from Moley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/moley>’s quiptic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/788>, published today. Look 
away if you haven’t solved it yet, and if you don’t know the “answer” to the 
mystery in the ballad itself, then watch and wait.


18,10,12ac Most elite ensemble in a particular branch to produce a Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> ballad (3,9,5)

 And Jim Lawton sings the answer to the Moley’s clue 
That tale of bride and seek – alluded to in Hitchcock’s Rope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/27/my-favourite-hitchcock-rope>
 – was written by Thomas Haynes Bayly, or more likely adapted by Bayly from a 
folk tale. This is an unflattering summary of Bayly’s work from the Oxford 
Companion to English Literature:

The author of many verses, including I’d Be A Butterfly and She Wore A Wreath 
of Roses which have been the subject of some ridicule. He also wrote at great 
speed many pieces for [the stage].

But let’s celebrate Bayly, not merely for titling a play You Can’t Marry Your 
Grandmother, but also for one of his entries in the Oxford English Dictionary – 
a kind of Grumpy Old Balladeer piece from 1839, Men Are All Clubbing Together:
 From Fifty Lyrical Ballads, 1829. Photograph: Internet Archive 
Bayly is the second citation, after Lamb, for the splendidly italicised phrase 
which is also our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue PARTY SPIRIT?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/dec/08/crossword-roundup-an-astonishing-lord-archer-themed-tribute-to-araucaria-and-the-best-3d-puzzles#show-all>
 for PHILANTHROPY.

Reticulated was pleasingly concise in “Giving American doctor, worker at 
hospital, in poor health”, while TwoDarrinStephens intrigued with “Hip-hop’s 
the only art form without those generous acts”.

Middlebro sustained interest across a 12-letter acrostic in “Humanitarianism 
primarily provides help in living, advancing new technology, health research or 
promising youngsters” and JollySwagman took stock of the Duke of Edinburgh in 
“The Queen’s consort’s part of a double act – not even Harry takes on half the 
amount of work for charity”.

schroduck gets the audacity award for a clue almost as long as Atlas Shrugged: 
“Heartless posh immoral Ayn Rand-following enthusiast lacking it, uses an 
outrageous partial facsimile of human generosity”.

The runners-up are Robi23’s extraordinary subtractive contraption “Doing good 
– helping others to be happy begets hope regardless of disposition” and 
ID2155366, who decided that Lord Archer could do with a kicking for his 
literary as well as his private life in “Lord Archer’s first, the ultimate 
rubbish, located under ‘Hip Novel’? For the love of humanity!” And the winner 
is jonemm’s coalition-evoking, Scrooge-like “’Money for the poor’? Control thy 
lip, orphan!”

Kudos to Jone, a merry Christmas to all setters and solvers, and see you back 
here on 12 January.
