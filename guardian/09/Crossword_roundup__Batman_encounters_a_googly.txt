The news in clues

A new setter in the Independent, Knut, debuted with an excitingly topical 
puzzle <http://independent.co.uk/independent.co.uk/editorial/xword/c_100215.bin>
 that featured a cameo fromdemocracy’s latest hope, Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras> ...

26ac Tsipras – an unknown quantity to fix economic woe (8)
[anagram of “Tsipras” with a mathematical symbol for “unknown”]
[anagram of TSIPRASY]

... in clue for SPARSITY, as well as some homegrown politicians, among them 
the chancellor of the exchequer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/12/escort-agency-boss-george-osborne>
 ...

25ac Doing ecstasy drunk, George Osborne name dropped (6)
[anagram of “Doing” with a slang term for “ecstasy”]
[anagram of DOINGE]

... in the kind of image that only cryptic clues can throw up. The answer is, 
of course <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/28/real-george-osborne>
, the name given to and dropped by Mr Osborne, GIDEON.

Latter patter

Cryptic newcomers are directed to a recent puzzle from Puck (interviewed here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/apr/26/meet-the-setter-puck>
),Guardian 26,500 <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26500>. The 
theme is CHESTNUTS, and, as well as allusion toAesculus hippocastanum, some of 
the best loved “old chestnuts” of crosswording get an airing. If, on seeing the 
words “cart horse” or “Czechoslovakia”, your mind doesn’t immediately focus on 
some particular answers, you’re in for a treat.

That goes as much for seasoned solvers. Take this clue:

22d Cricketer that’s second out – Wayne, the night watchman? (6)
[cricketing position minus an abbreviation for “second”]
[BATSMAN – S]

The BATMAN here neither carries a bat, nor is the kind of batman who tends to 
a sumpter-beast, also known as a bât-horse (where a bât is a saddle and the 
horse carries the officers’ baggage) and latterly a generic servant.

No, this is the Batman who, the young me was crushed to learn, was not bitten 
by a radioactive bat and is not even part-chiroptera. The use of “night 
watchman” is deliciously devious, since the cricketing theme of the surface 
leads you to think of, as the Wisden Dictionary of Cricket has it, the batsman 
who ...

has the most reliable defence of all the non-specialist batsmen and his 
function is to stay in until the close and thus protect the wickets of players 
higher in the order until the next day’s play


That book is, as you might expect, most circumspect as to the origin of 
another cricketing term, GOOGLY. Oxford, Collins and Chambers leave it at 
“Origin unknown”, “unknown origin” and “Ety dubious”. Fowler’s mentions, at 
arm’s length, “an unspecified Maori dialect term”. Wisden, though, is having 
none of it:

The suggestion that it derives from a Maori word, and got its name during an 
MCC tour of New Zealand in 1902–3, can almost certainly be ruled out because 
the word “googly” already existed in Australia in the 1890s, when it was 
apparently applied to any high, teasing slow delivery.

“As close as we are likely to get”, the book insists, is that such a delivery 
makes the batsman, well, goggle. You will have anticipated by now the subject 
of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue GOOGLY?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for GODIS SKUM 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/feb/09/crossword-roundup-fracking-ikea#show-all>
.

High-fives to all those who put the word “Ikea” to work, especially 
hectorthebat’s “No pear in Ikea’s gumdrops pick-and-mix” while robinjohnson 
kept it local with the billet-doux “Ms Ulrika’s top and ski pants are beyond 
divine – I’m sweet for her!” And Moaljodad kept it topical with “‘Flat-packed 
marshmallow,’ Stephen Fry overheard?”

Among the anagrams, I enjoyed yungylek’s “Kim’s got Doug’s fizzy sweets” and 
Middlebro’s “God’s musik – confused in translation, dolce”.

The runners-up are steveran’s bewitching “Order this brand for absurd kingdoms 
of marshmallow sheep” and harlobarlo’s exhausted “Must kids go crazy (needing 
time-out) for IKEA candy?”; the winner is alberyalbery’s nutritious “Sweet 
variety of Swede?”.

Kudos to Albery; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
