The Dasht-e Lut desert, one of the Earth’s hottest and driest places, is a 
(hardy) trekker’s dream, with incredible rock formations, sand dunes, salt 
plains and the Valley of Meteorites – imposing landscapes that enchanted Marco 
Polo and, 700 years later, Wilfred Thesiger.

on a budget. The guide must accompany travel across country but you can roam 
freely in each location. TheBorders of Adventure website

sound advice on travel in the country.

It takes four days to reach the summit of the country’s highest mountain, a 
5,671-metre volcano. Base camp is two hours from Tehran, making Damavand one of 
the most accessible 5,000-metre-plus mountains in the world. If all goes to 
plan, this seven-day trip includes two days’ recovery in Larijan’s thermal 
spring and Tehran.
