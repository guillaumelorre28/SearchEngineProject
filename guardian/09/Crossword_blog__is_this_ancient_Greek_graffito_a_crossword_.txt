Here’s a cracker of a clue from Azed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2015/apr/05/azed-2235>:

24d Many remains, excavated, can be seen in ——, I mean (6)
[ anagram of MANYREMAINS without the letters of IMEAN ]
[ anagram of MANYRS ]

Now, in under-reported news, the ancient Greek city of SMYRNA is laying claim 
to crosswording history. We tend to think of the crosswordas knocking on for 
103 years old

 ona story seen in the Turkish Daily Sabah 
<http://www.dailysabah.com/history/2016/10/11/ancient-crossword-discovered-on-wall-of-basilica-in-smyrna>
, which tries to re-date the first crossword a couple of millennia further back.

Here’s another Azed clue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2008/mar/09/azed-1867>, with a similar 
structure:

28d Grecian locale: —— l-licence is required for flogging in it? (5)
[ anagram of GRECIANLOCALE without the letters of LLICENCE ]
[ anagram of GRAOA ]

And it was in the once-Grecian locale of the market place (or, as they called 
it, the AGORA) that archaeology professor Akın Ersoy has found, among the many 
remains, a bunch of Greek letters on the basilica wall, arranged so that you 
can read words both horizontally and vertically.

Is it, as reported, a crossword? Just like in a cryptic clue, you have to work 
out your definition first. The Daily Sabah quotes Ersoy:

There are scientists and historians who claim that the Christian community of 
the time was heavily pressured by the Roman authorities, and they invented 
these kinds of crosswords to communicate among themselves. However, we consider 
this as just a crossword because it’s very out in the open.

Back then, hiding your meaning from those who would do you harm was one reason 
for arranging words in inventive ways; another was the belief that words that 
fitted together did so for a reason, and so word-squares and the like revealed 
divine intention.

Ersoy is considering the idea that the graffito in the Smyrna agora is neither 
of those: that it was created for the fun of it, which – while lacking clues 
and a competitive element – would make it closer to today’s crosswords in terms 
of why anyone bothered to assemble it.

To test that interesting theory: can anyone make sense of any of the words

 (apart from ΛÓΓOΣ)? It’s all ελληνικά to με.
