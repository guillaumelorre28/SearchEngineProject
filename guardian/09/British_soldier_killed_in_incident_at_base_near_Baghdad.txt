A British soldier has been killed in Iraq following an “incident”, the 
Ministry of Defence <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ministry-of-defence> has 
confirmed.

The soldier, from the 2nd Battalion the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, did not 
die as a result of enemy fire, the MoD said. Its statement said: “The death 
occurred in Taji,Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>, following an 
incident that is currently under investigation, but we can confirm that it was 
not as a result of enemy activity.”

Officials have informed the soldier’s family, who requested a period of grace 
be given before the name is released.


Earlier on Monday, the US-led coalition in Iraq, which is trying to tackle 
Islamic State announced that a service member had been killed on 2 January. The 
statement from the Combined Joint Task Force said: “The service member’s name 
and the circumstances surrounding the death will be released at the discretion 
of the pertinent national authorities. The incident is under investigation.”

Taji is a town close to Baghdad where the British army has a training and 
advisory operation: Camp Taji is a coalition forces base also known as Camp 
Cooke.

It is thought the soldier was there in a training capacity as opposed to 
actually fighting Islamic State, according to Sky News.
