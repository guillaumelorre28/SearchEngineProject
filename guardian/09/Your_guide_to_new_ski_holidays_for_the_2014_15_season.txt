FAMILY HOLIDAYS … THAT ARE FUN FOR PARENTS TOO

Vallorcine, France

Family skiing’s fun, but if you want to be sure of some adult downtime – or 
slope time – you need a holiday where children are entertained. A ski trip that 
includes a seven-day circus camp with La Source in the Chamonix valley over New 
Year should do the trick. Circus skills classes include juggling and plate 
spinning, in a venue accommodating up to 22 families. There’s daily yoga and 
other activities, along with generous discounts on ski school and ski hire. The 
price is for fully catered accommodation, with each family sharing a 
six-bedroom en suite dorm room, and also includes a Mont Blanc Unlimited 
six-day ski pass worth €280.
• 27 Dec-3 Jan, adult £655, child £525 (7-11) and £395 (3-6), flights extra.

Kandahar Snowsport festival promises to be a blast for all the family, 
featuring daily races for all ages and abilities, training clinics with ski

barbecues, live music, skating and tobogganing.

Panorama, Canada


The Canadians do family skiing very well, and the relatively petite resort of 
Panorama in British Columbia is one of the best. Its Pano kids’ camps will take 
the little treasures off your hands for three days of instruction, and its 
Discover programmes take first-time skiers through their paces. There’s even an 
on-slope nanny for youngsters needing more personalised care. Oh, and the 
resort benefits from piste-side hot pools, which make the perfect après for any 
family.
• Seven nights room-only at Panorama Mountain Village, including flights from 
London to Calgary from £899pp with Canadian Affair. 020-7616 9184,

few frills but lots of steep couloirs. Hotel Terra in Teton Village, adds a 
refreshing splash of contemporary design – using natural materials on the walls 
gives an appropriate wild-west feel. Among other initiatives Terra uses 
recycled glass, offsets its electricity usage and recycles all its water runoff 
– which will make you feel better about using the heated rooftop hot tub.

basement, a neon-lit multicoloured swimming pool, a wellness centre with 
massage rooms, hammam and sauna, and even an archery and rifle shooting range.

 A ‘learn to tour’ course in the Silvretta Alps, Austria 
The Sierra High Route, California, US


Touring between basic mountain huts sounds like a gruelling challenge to most, 
but for an even wilder long-distance traverse, experienced backcountry skiers 
might be tempted by the Sierra High Route in California, which involves camping 
(tents provided) each night. The 37-mile, six-night journey crosses the Sierra 
Nevada range, entailing around 4km of ascent, a little more of descent and 
unmeasurable amounts of whooping through deep powder.
• From $1,295pp, including all food, guiding, avalanche equipment, van 
shuttles and tents for six nights, starting at Shepherd and ending at 
Wolverton, based on a group of five. Flights to the starting point of 
Independence, California, are not included. +1 760 873 8526,

Silvretta Alps, Austria

Making the transition from regular skier to backcountry ski tour adventurer 
requires new techniques, equipment and a fair amount of knowledge of snow and 
safety. Cut to the chase on a gentle “learn to tour” course in Ischgl, run by 
the people behind Scotland’s Glenmore Lodge, who are taking their skills to the 
Alps for the week. The five-day trip is hut-to-hut, so the experience is 
authentically no-frills, but the terrain is gentle and suitable for 
intermediate skiers.
• The course starts 8 March 2015 and costs £1,025pp including half-board 
accommodation, guiding, equipment and in-resort transport but excluding flights 
to Innsbruck. 01479 861256,glenmorelodge.co.uk

Andermatt, Switzerland

Off-radar for many British skiers but loved by powder hounds and pros for its 
fantastic, lift-accessible backcountry terrain and cracking day tours, 
Andermatt is the setting for a six-day course from Jagged Globe that focuses 
more on off-piste descent than ascent, though there are some short skinning 
sections. Towards the end of the week there’s a longer tour, with two nights 
spent in mountain huts. 
• £1,095pp, including seven nights’ half-board accommodation. 0114 276 3322,

Queyras Traverse, France

With backcountry ski touring booming, classic tours such as the Haute Route 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/dec/31/skiing-haute-route-adventure> 
from Mont Blanc to the Matterhorn in the French Alps are increasingly clogged 
with skiers. For 2015, British operator Mountain Tracks has introduced a 
six-day hut-to-hut tour in the lesser-known Queyras natural park, starting and 
ending in the town of Guillestre. Each day includes around three hours of 
ascent but the views and empty powder fields are worth the sweat.
• £995pp for seven nights half-board in hotels and mountain huts, flights to 
Grenoble or Marseilles and guiding. Departs 31 January. Equipment not provided.

Zugspitze, Germany

Dismissed by many as a poor alternative to better-known resorts in Austria and 
Switzerland, Bavaria has, it is claimed by local expert Francis Kelsey, some of 
the best off-piste runs in the entire Alps. Ski Club of Great Britain has a new 
touring weekend in the Zugspitz Arena, close to the Austrian border, including 
three days with a mountain guide. Zugspitze, Germany’s highest mountain at 
2,962 metres, has 20km of runs, eight lifts and vertical drops of nearly 2,000 
metres. Basic touring skills are required as there is some challenging steep 
skiing.

• A four-night trip from 22-26 January costs £599, including half-board 
accommodation and guide, but not flights (to Innsbruck, just over the border).
