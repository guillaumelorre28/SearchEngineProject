The Rumble in the Jungle remains one of the most compelling stories in sport. 
A trawl through this newspaper's archive throws up a vast collection of 
memories, meanings and, if you go back to the morning after that sweltering 
night in Zaire, a poem on the leader page of the Observer.

The fight

If you case you haven't seen the fight, or would like to relive it again, here 
is David Frost presenting "from the heartland of Africa, live and direct from 
ringside in Kinshasa, Zaire".

The memories

The Rumble in the Jungle continues to intrigue sports writers and fans alike. 
The shock of Foreman losing, the bravery of Ali's counter-attacking style and 
the significance of holding the bout in Zaire make it one of the most eulogised 
nights in sporting history.

Here's Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali> speaking 
in 1975 about the importance of the venue:

"When I first heard the fight would be in Africa, I just hoped it would go off 
right, being in a country that was supposed to be so undeveloped. Then, when we 
went down to Zaire, I saw they'd built a new stadium with lights and that 
everything would be ready and I started getting used to the idea and liking it. 
And the more I thought about it, the more it grew on me how great it would be 
to win back my title in Africa. Being in Zaire opened my eyes.

"I saw black people running their own country. I saw a black president of a 
humble black people who have a modern country. When I was in training there 
before the fight, I'd sit on the riverbank and watch the boats going by and see 
the 747 jumbo jets flying overhead and I'd know there were black pilots and 
black stewardesses in 'em and it just seemed so nice.

"In Zaire everything was black - from the train drivers and hotel owners to 
the teachers in the schools and the pictures on the money. It was just like any 
other society, except it was all black and, because I'm black oriented and a 
Muslim, I was home there. I'm not home here [in the United States]. I'm trying 
to make it home, but it's not.

"It was a rich black man who paid me and George Foreman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/george-foreman>, and he did it because he 
wanted some publicity for his little country, and he got it. For 15 years after 
the white Belgians had to get out of there, no one - including me - ever heard 
of Zaire. No one knew it was a country of more than 22 million people, but now 
we do."

When remembering the rumble in 2005, Les Roopanarine recalled the unlikeliness 
of Ali's victory 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2005/oct/31/boxing?INTCMP=SRCH>. Ali is now 
remembered as a great joker and raconteur whose confidence must have 
intimidated opponents. But at the time, his optimism was seen as folly: 
"Branding Foreman 'The Mummy,' he playfully portrayed the champion as slow and 
lumbering, emphasising his own contrasting speed with the immortal lines: 
'Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee; his hands can't hit what his eyes 
can't see.' Many saw it as gallows humour. What Foreman lacked in speed, he 
made up for with prodigious power. In training sessions, he would leave a deep 
indentation in the heavy bag; observers shuddered to think what would happen if 
Ali were on the receiving end of similar treatment."

Speaking some time after the fight, Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's doctor, explained 
the extent of Ali's bravery on the night: "What Ali did was truly inspired. The 
lay-off [his 3-year exile after refusing the draft] had taken away his first 
set of gifts, so in Zaire he developed another. The man had the greatest chin 
in the history of the heavyweight division. He had as much courage as anyone 
who ever fought. He could think creatively and clearly with bombs flying around 
him. And he showed it all when it mattered most that night with the most 
amazing performance I've ever seen."

Here's Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, on his man's famous counter-attacking 
style:

"I remember everything about Zaire so incredibly vividly. It was such a thrill 
to have been a part of it. He was such a pleasure to work with. He always had 
time for everybody, but when it came to the fight I thought he was crazy with 
his 'rope-a-dope', lying on the ropes while George hit him. People thought we 
had worked on it as a tactic but no. They were saying I'd loosened the ropes to 
let Muhammad lean back. But I had gone round the ring tightening them and they 
were still loose as a goose because of the heat.

"I thought Foreman was killing him, but now we know what happened which is why 
he was the greatest. It was beautiful. The time I had with Muhammad were the 
happiest days of my life. I still try to see him as much as I can because we 
will be buddies for ever.

Two years ago, the Guardian's boxing writer, Kevin Mitchell tried to sum up 
the greatness of the fight 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2009/oct/30/muhammad-ali-george-foreman>: 
"Those fortunate enough to be there reckon was the most memorable night of 
their lives," he wrote. "None of the attendant writers I have spoken to down 
the years could compare the fight and all that surrounded it with anything else 
they'd covered, before or since."

The reporting of the fight has kept it alive. When the Observer complied a 
list of the best 50 sports books of all time,Norman Mailer's account of the 
Rumble, The Fight, came second 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2005/may/08/sportandleisurebooks.features?INTCMP=SRCH>
. To explain the popularity of the book, Jason Cowley wrote: "The Fight has the 
complexity of a mosaic as well as a wonderful simplicity. A lot of work and 
considerable talent disguise the artistry of a book that can be read, quickly, 
as a dramatic first-hand account of one of the greatest of all sporting events 
of last century, and then again, more slowly, for the detail and acuity of its 
psychological insights and for the forceful fluency of its rhetorical, 
endlessly inventive style."

The memory of the fight remains impressively versatile in the minds of those 
who watched it. It has featured on lists of thegreat sporting gambles of all 
time <http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/nov/15/10-sporting-gambles>, the 
great pieces of commentary of all time

Boxing translates well to the silver screen and the Rumble is no different. 
When We Were Kings <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118147/>, the documentary film 
of the fight, was released in 1996 and went on to win an Oscar for best 
documentary feature. Ali and Foreman joined the filmmakers at the presentation, 
with Foreman even helping Ali up the stairs. Foreman later said of Ali: "He is 
one of the greatest human beings I've ever met and I pray for him every day 
because I know that when he dies there will be a little less love in the world."

The fighters

Ali's words speak for themselves 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2002/jan/17/boxing?INTCMP=SRCH>.

George Foreman was interviewed by Nick Greenslade in 2006 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2006/jan/08/features.sport14?INTCMP=SRCH> for 
the Observer. But the man who went from Thriller to Griller is much more 
interesting when captured by the words of others. In his last essay for the 
Observer in 2003, the great sports journalistGeorge Plimpton explained how 
Foreman became an unlikely American icon 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/oct/05/boxing.features?INTCMP=SRCH>.

The poem

Here is the Observer's leader article from October 31, 1974:


Lines upon a Louisville Lip 
Nine years ago, they said. 
Before Liston the Bear Muhammad Ali would be dead. 
But he went out. In just this way and with no fear, 
Ali did the same trick to Foreman the Bull, 
but this time in Zaire. 
While you were waiting for George Foreman's eye to mend
You said "Muhammad Ali's reached his end. 
He is too old, and has got slower, 
And Foreman the Bull will bowl him over." 
When I said I was still the best
The suckers said: "He will never pass this test." 
But I pulled the wool over everybody's eyes 
And in round eight it was Foreman who was looking at the skies. 
I float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, 
But this time I showed my brain was the fastest part of me. 
People said: "You can only win by slipping his fists," 
So I took them on and he could not resist, 
For when the Bull began to slow
Muhammad Ali showed his punches, 
by Allah, could land the blow. 
Five million dollars is a lot to pay two men to fight, 
And George's showing is proof that this is robbery, not right. 
Sure you need against him doublehitting power, 
But Ali the Genius was the man of the hour. 
Foreman's a fighter of no great merit. 
It is I who should receive the full five million credit. 
Whipping George has made my day, 
There is no nicer way I know of earning my pay. 
But because this time I get one half the price I'm worth, 
Next time Ali dances round the ring he's asking twice the purse. 
So next time 'don't match Bull and Master, 
Because Muhammad Ali has shown he is much the faster. 
I was perfect and Allah showed, 
He'd realised, For as soon as I won 
His lightning shot across the skies.
