The extraordinary warmth through December in the UK was also felt much further 
afield. EasternEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> was 
frequently bathed in mild Atlantic air. Over Christmas Warsaw reached 14C 
(57F), some 12C above its average.

However, last week there was a dramatic turnaround as polar air surged 
southwards, and temperatures tumbled to -18C (-0.4F) in parts ofPoland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland>.

The sudden switch to freezing conditions has been blamed for the deaths of at 
least 21 people, many of whom reportedly succumbed to hypothermia.

Last week also brought a dramatic change in fortunes to the Alps. The high 
temperatures during December had left many ski resorts short of snow. Many runs 
only remained open due to the huge investment in snow cannons made in recent 
years.

However, low pressure and colder air brought heavy snow to much of the Alps 
earlier in the week, especially in the west. Parts of France andSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland> caught more than 50cm (20in) of 
new snow, transforming the slopes but also leading to avalanche warnings. 
Reports said two people had been killed by an avalanche above the Grands 
Montets ski area over the weekend.

By contrast, South Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica> has 
been enduring another heatwave and began the new year with temperatures already 
smashing 40C in the Western Cape and 43C in the Northern Cape.

This comes just months after a previous heatwave when temperatures reached 
48.4C in Vredendal in October. However, somewhat of a respite will come in the 
next few days, with showers and cooler air expected.
