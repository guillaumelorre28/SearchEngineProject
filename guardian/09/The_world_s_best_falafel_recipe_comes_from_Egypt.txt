A few years ago, I set out to discover who made the world’s best falafel. The 
dish had been a staple on the Leon menu in one form or another since we opened, 
but I felt we had yet to perfect the recipe.

I started my quest by calling the great culinary anthropologist Claudia Roden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/claudia-roden>, who declared with 
refreshing certainty that the best falafel was to be found in Egypt. They made 
it with fava beans (a kind of broad bean which is also grown in Britain), she 
explained, which made it lighter and moister than the falafel made from 
chickpeas elsewhere in the Middle East. In Egypt, she said, the best falafel 
were widely acknowledged to be found in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. 
So that is where I went.

Once a cosmopolitan city filled with louche Europeans, Alexandria is no longer 
a place of beauty. Its neo-classical and art deco villas, in melancholy decay 
since the Westerners fled during the Suez crisis in 1956, are now squeezed 
between the square shoulders of concrete high-rises. But man, can the 
Alexandrians cook.

From the chargrilled corn-on-the-cob sold by street vendors on the Corniche 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corniche_%28Alexandria%29> to the delicate broth 
of crab and clams I slurped at an upmarket restaurant behind the boatyards, 
everything was cooked with a rare love and attention to detail. And everyone I 
spoke to agreed: the best place for falafel was the bustling fast-food 
institution Mohamed Ahmed.

Here, for under a pound, I ate until my innards begged for mercy: great 
pyramids of piping hot falafel – light and crispy on the outside, creamy on the 
inside, flecked green with fresh coriander and spring onion.

I asked to speak to the chef, and they led me into the street and round the 
corner to an imposing wooden door. It opened on to a dark, high-ceilinged room, 
lit only by the flame from a gas burner under a huge vat of oil. Sitting beside 
the vat was the chef, repetitively forming falafel in the bowl of his hand and 
tossing them with a flick of his thumb into the oil at a rate of about 30 a 
minute. Every now and then he would scoop them out with a huge slotted spoon 
and pass them to a runner, who would sprint back to the restaurant to place 
these perfect golden nuggets on to the Formica tables.

I got the feeling he had been there, flicking perfect falafel into a vat, for 
at least 100 years. You and I will never match his expertise, but it’s worth a 
try. This recipe will take you as close to falafel perfection as you can get 
without a plane ticket.

 Serve with a simple minty yoghurt sauce and some flatbread. Photograph: Jill 
Mead for the Guardian 
1 Drain the split fava beans well in a sieve or colander. Tip them into a food 
processor, along with the rest of the ingredients, except for the sesame seeds. 
Blitz the ingredients to a rough paste and tip it out on to a clean surface.

2 Divide the mixture into 12-16 pieces, each about the size of a small golf 
ball. Press them down with your fingers to make small patties.

3 Sprinkle around 3 tbsp sesame seeds on to a plate and coat each side of the 
falafels roughly with the seeds. Transfer them to the fridge for at least 10 
minutes.

4 To cook the falafel, fill a small pan with oil to a depth of about 3cm. Heat 
the oil – it will be ready when a piece of bread dropped in sizzles and turns 
brown quickly. Turn the heat down and start to cook the falafel in batches. I 
cooked mine 4 at a time and kept them warm on a baking tray in a low oven. Cook 
each side for 2-3 minutes, or until it is golden brown then flip them over and 
fry the other side.

5 Serve with a minty yoghurt sauce (see below), flatbreads and spiced 
aubergine (recipes below).

Yoghurt sauce

250ml plain yoghurt
3 tbsp tahini
1 garlic clove, crushed
Juice of ½ lemon
Salt and black pepper
2 tbsp chopped mint

1 Whisk all the ingredients together, then thin the sauce down to a suitable 
pouring consistency with a little cold water.

Spiced aubergine and tomato 

Serves 4-6 as a side
3 tbsp olive oil
1 aubergine, cut into 1cm square dice
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
400g tin of chopped tomatoes
½ tsp sugar
A pinch of ground allspice
A pinch of cayenne pepper
A splash of balsamic vinegar
Salt and black pepper
Chopped coriander, mint or parsley

1 In a large frying pan, heat up the olive oil and saute the diced aubergine 
until golden brown. Drain on with a slotted spoon on to kitchen paper.

2 Add the sliced garlic to the remaining oil in the pan. Cook for a few 
minutes on a low heat. Before the garlic turns brown, add the tinned tomatoes 
with the sugar, allspice and cayenne.

3 Turn the heat up and reduce the sauce for about 10 minutes, or until very 
thick. Add the aubergine back to the pan. Heat through gently and add a splash 
of balsamic vinegar. Season well. Finish with fresh herbs.
