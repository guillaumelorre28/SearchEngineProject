Lifetime achievement award judge and human rights campaigner and former head 
of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, summed up the massive impact Judith Kerr’s 
writing has had on our society: “Judith Kerr represents the best of Britain, 
Europe, literature and the enduring power of storytelling and the written word. 
A young refugee who fled the Nazis, she grew up to make the most enormous 
contribution to children’s’ writing in the UK. As long as people read When 
Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, there will be hope for our world”.
