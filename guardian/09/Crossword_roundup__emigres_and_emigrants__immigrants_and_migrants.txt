Warring Tories! A splendidly devious clue from Knut in the Independent

…

9ac Reckless, perhaps, for one to have left bird behind (2-3)
[ someone no longer doing ‘bird’ ]

... used the defector Mark RECKLESS as a cryptically definitive example of a 
EX-CON. The same puzzle evoked other troubles on the right, such as this 
trenchant clue ...

3d Migrant rhetoric? Must be Tories / NF, I suspect (8,7)
[ anagram (‘suspect’) of MUSTBETORIESNFI ]

12ac Refugees regimes maltreated (7)
[ anagram (‘maltreated’) of REGIMES ]

... recalled one of the many words we no longer seem to use to describe people 
who have crossed borders: EMIGRES. It’s an irresistible anagram, and recalls a 
passage from Sandy Balfour’s wonderful crossword memoirPretty Girl in Crimson 
Rose (8) <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/356004/>, 
where he confronts the idea that your choice of the Guardian puzzle is, as a 
fellow solver describes it, “a matter of attitude, and of how you understand 
the world”:

That night I look again at Rufus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/feb/22/meet-the-setter-rufus>
. I am armed with two things: one is the knowledge that he is one of ‘the 
easiest’; the other is that, if you know the setter, you are halfway there.
A clue catches my eye. ‘Émigré beaten up by the authorities (6)’. By now I 
know enough to recognise an anagram.
‘REGIME,’ I say to myself, as I fall asleep.

This is where I date my beginning.

Latter patter 

The Latin migrare has given us what David Cameron would call “a swarm” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2015/aug/03/cameron-swarm-plague-god-migrants-calais>
 of words for moving people:Tristram Shandy 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tristram-shandy-4.html> spoke of a “sudden 
demigration”; we have also in the past transmigrated and commigrated.

EMIGRANT sounds more modern and less ooh-la-la than EMIGRE, but it’s not used 
in the modern age. No word, in fact, sticks around for long: today’s attempt at 
a neutral coinage (ASYLUM-SEEKER, say) is tomorrow’s term of abuse. So has it 
been with another word from the same root, MIGRANT.

As David Marsh <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidmarsh>, the editor of 
the Guardian style guide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a>, puts it:

Newspapers such as the Guardian have been using ‘migrant’ in recent years in 
part because something similar happened to the word ‘immigrant’, when it became 
increasingly used by racists to mean something like ‘a black person in Britain 
who should go back home’.

This piece is headed “We deride them as ‘migrants’. Why not call them people?” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/28/migrants-people-refugees-humanity>
 and leads us to our next clueing challenge. Reader, how would you clue PEOPLE?

Clueing competition

Many thanks for your clues for BOJO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/feb/22/crossword-roundup-tory-name-calling>
. Of those that took a Johnson-free surface, I especially enjoyed baerchen’s 
“With his fees paid by Barclays, Jack got into Radley”, ComedyPseudonym’s 
“Ambitious blond bohemian loses his head for Juliet” and ID2155366’s judgmental 
“This clown takes Jay Z out”.

The sobriquet is a gift to acrosticians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/jan/27/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-initial-letters>
, such as alberyalbery (“Hairy biker - being only just overtaken at the start”) 
and ousgg (“Buffoon offered job of leadership) and to users ofthe hidden answer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/06/cryptic-crosswords-beginners-hidden-answers>
, such as cmiall (“Dumbo journalist endlessly makes up quotes”) and indeed 
GeoScanner (“Some yobbo journalist gets a clue in the Telegraph Toughie”).

The ingenuity award goes to harlobarlo, for the ciphering “Politician has an 
‘in’, moving on to next position”. Gosh.

The runners-up are Robi23’s ticklingly topical “One wishing to leave union 
starts to bicker over job opportunities” and Peshwari’s ambiguous “Exit leader? 
He hopes so”; the winner is DameSweeneyEggblast’s short story “Leading Brexit 
opponent joins ‘Out’”.

Kudos to Sweeney; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
