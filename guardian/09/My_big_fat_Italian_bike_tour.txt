I’m at the top of a steep, snowy slope wondering how on earth I’m going to get 
down. This is a feeling I’d long forgotten. I’ve been snowboarding for almost 
20 years now. But today, I’m not on my board, I’m riding a fat bike – a 
mountain bike with plump tyres, which make it possible to ride stably on snow. 
In theory, at least.

I try to take it slowly, hands heavy on the brakes, but the snow is fresh and 
light and I slide about all over the place. My guide, Raniero Campigotto, 
reminds me to get my weight back as you would when riding downhill on a 
mountain bike. Then he smiles and karate chops his hand down the slope. I think 
he means I need to straight-line it. So, with a deep breath, I do.

Fat bikes, with tyres twice as wide as those on regular mountain bikes, were 
born in America out of a desire to cycle in Alaskan snow and ice, but 
transferred well to Mississippi river banks and the sand dunes of New Mexico. 
Their use in US ski towns has surged of late. And this winter they’ve become 
big news in Europe, too, with many resorts offering them for hire.

I was in the beautiful, craggy Dolomites earlier this season to go 
snowboard-touring above glitzy Cortina D’Ampezzo. But, thanks to El Niño, there 
was no off-piste at all, so I gave fat biking a go instead.

Fat biking has parallels with the adventure ethos and fitness elements of 
backcountry ski and snowboard touring, so appealed more than other recent 
alternative snowsports fads, like ridiculous snow scooters.

Last winter, Raniero, owner of the Rifugio Col Gallina in the Lagazuoi Cinque 
Torri section of the Cortina ski area, was one of the first Europeans to start 
running fat-bike tours. “I saw it in the US and thought it would suit this area 
perfectly,” he says, “as we have lots of grassy slopes and natural trails.”

And this winter he added electric motors to some of them. I was a bit sniffy 
about these detracting from the challenge, but Raniero assured me I’d be able 
to access terrain I might not otherwise reach.

Stubbornly, I start the day with my motor on zero, but it’s very unstable 
pedalling hard up a snowy slope, so I turn on the power. It’s a lot less 
wobbly, but still a good workout – the slope has a pitch of over 2,000m.

Towards the top we take a tour of first world war barracks built into the 
cliffside. Raniero has been restoring them to give a glimpse of the remote and 
cramped conditions of this key battle-front between the Austro-Hungarian and 
Italian armies. Along with fat-bike tours, he also runs snowshoe, speck and 
wine tours with guides dressed in historic uniforms.


And then, the ride down. Floating and making fresh tracks felt amazing, a 
lighter feeling than a mountain bike descent, akin to snowboarding, and then an 
easy cycle across some hard-packed, ice-crusted snow. Many fat-bike tours only 
ride on this type of terrain as, in most resorts, they are banned from the ski 
pistes; most only allow them on the winter hiking trails.

As well as the more relaxed rules in the Lagazuoi Cinque Torri area, its 
appeal is that it’s near three other distinct ski areas around Cortina, which 
it is linked to by bus.

Raniero’s refuge was full so I stayed at the nearby Rifugio Scoiattoli, 
accessed by hiking or chairlift, and got back on my board to explore pistes 
clearly benefiting from the Dolomites-wide investment in snowmaking equipment, 
before ending the day in the outdoor wood-fired hot tub, watching the dramatic 
Cinque Torri sunset. There are places you visit and like a lot, then there are 
places so breathtakingly beautiful you hope to return one day. The Dolomites 
felt like such a place. I may even bring a bike.
