Dignitaries and celebrities, security services and admirers flooded into 
Muhammad Ali’s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday to begin a 
memorial for the great boxer that was fit for a head of state.

The two-day remembrance began on Thursday with a traditional Islamic prayer 
service at the Freedom Hall arena. Before he died last week at 74, Ali himself 
had requested that the service be open to all. So alongside Ali’s famous 
friends such as Sugar Ray Leonard, Lennox Lewis, Don King and others, more than 
14,000 admirers attended.

A black Cadillac hearse, with a police escort, brought Ali’s body to the 
service with his widow, children, and two ex-wives.

Imam Zaid Shakir, a leading US Muslim scholar, greeted the crowd with an 
introduction that encompassed Ali’s open worldview: “We welcome all of you here 
today. We welcome the Muslims, we welcome the members of other faith 
communities, we welcome the law enforcement community,” he said.

“We welcome our sisters, our elders, our youngsters. All were beloved to

After the service, the civil rights campaigner and former presidential 
candidate the Rev Jesse Jackson went to the Muhammad Ali Center, where a 
memorial sprang up in the hours after Ali’s death and has since grown into a 
mountain of flowers, photos, cards and drawings.

Jackson kneeled to sign a banner proclaiming Ali “the Greatest Forever”.

Ali’s most impressive accomplishment, Jackson said, was to exercise “the 
proper use of fame”.

“He turned scars into stars. Instead of getting bitter, he got better,” 
Jackson said. The minister grew up in South Carolina, the son of a professional 
boxer, and said Ali had always inspired him – especially his penchant for 
rhythm and rhyme.

“You’ve got to be southern to talk that stuff,” Jackson said, smiling.

As a young man, Jackson was an aide to Martin Luther King Jr, and he recalled 
4 April 1967, when King was in a New York City hotel preparing to give a famous 
speech against the Vietnam war, “and in walked Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali”. It 
was a bold statement for Ali, who was then at the pinnacle of his athletic 
career.

Just a few days later, Ali would upend that career, and much of the world’s 
opinion, when he refused to be drafted by the US army.

“But he went from being reviled and rejected to being revered,” Jackson said.

On Friday, Ali’s main public memorial will take place at the KFC Yum! Center 
in downtown Louisville. Organizers said on Thursday they expected the sports 
arena – named after the KFC restaurant chain and its parent company – to be 
fully packed, with at least 15,000 attendees. The entire floor of the arena, 
they said, would be reserved for celebrities and other notable people from 
Ali’s life.

Speakers at Friday’s service will range from Bill Clinton to the comedian 
Billy Crystal. Some high-profile foreign leaders – Jordan’s King Abdullah, and 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan – were cut from the program at the last 
moment, to make room for two other, as yet unnamed, speakers, according to Ali 
family spokesman Bob Gunnell.

The US secret service is organizing security at the center, and planned to 
sweep for bombs before the service. Throughout downtown Louisville, police and 
security vehicles jostled Thursday with tour buses full of fans. The heavy 
security presence reinforced the sense that Ali’s ability to rile opponents did 
not end with his death, especially in a time of increased attacks on mosques 
and Muslims after terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, 
and during a presidential campaign in which a leading candidate has suggested 
banning all Muslim immigrants for a time.

Before the service, starting about 9 am local time, Ali’s hearse will lead a 
procession throughout Louisville that will visit some of the places that bear 
his name: the Ali Center museum, his childhood home, and the boulevard named 
for him. The route takes in Broadway, where Cassius Clay, as he was then known, 
joined a parade celebrating his gold medal when he returned from the 1960 
Olympics, to a city that greeted him as a hero but remained divided on racial 
lines.

Jesse Jackson harkened back to that victory at the Olympics in Rome when he 
talked about the procession. “Last time he took that route, he had a gold medal 
but couldn’t buy a hamburger at diners in downtown Louisville,” he said. “But 
he used his mastery in the ring to reject the inequality among humanity.”


The funeral service will start about 1pm central time, and will be 
livestreamed onthe Ali Center’s web site <http://alicenter.org/>.
