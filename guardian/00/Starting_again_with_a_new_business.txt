"In some homes, your immediate friend is your husband," says 43-year-old 
Pamela Anyango, who lives in Kibera. After 26 years of marriage, she lost her 
husband to stomach cancer. Without a source of income, she turned to different 
people for loans but her failure to repay them resulted in death threats and 
beatings from thugs. Eventually she managed to start a small business, which 
was later destroyed by rioters in the post-election violence that gripped 
Kibera for several months.

She sought help from the Institute for Development and Welfare Services and it 
linked her to one of its groups. "I was a little discouraged at first, right 
after the violence, but then I realised I had to start again." Some three years 
later, she runs a fish stall in the market and can afford to keep her children 
in school and off the streets, where they could easily become involved with 
drugs or join gangs.

Anyango hopes to be able to secure her children a way out of the slums through 
education, because the other alternatives have been exhausted. "My husband left 
me a plot of land after he died, but his relatives took it away from me. I 
tried to report this but nothing happened. I went to the chief there but he 
said the land is theirs and so am I. In order to get justice, I would have to 
travel to my village and that's difficult because I don't have money."
