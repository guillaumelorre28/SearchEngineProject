The Hawaiian crow is the latest animal to be added to the elite group of 
species that use tools, afterscientists documented it 
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v537/n7620/full/nature19103.html> 
employing sticks to extract hard-to-reach morsels of food from crevices in a 
log in less than one minute.

Its cousin, the New Caledonia crow, was already known 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/21/new-caledonian-crow-bird-editorial>
 to be a master toolmaker and user, and scientists believe that the similar 
features shared by both species – large, mobile eyes and unusually straight 
bills – are evolutionary adaptations to enable them to use tools, much like 
humans having opposable thumbs.

However these remarkable skills are in danger of being lost: the Hawaiian crow 
is the most endangered corvid species and isalready extinct in the wild 
<http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22706052/0> due to habitat loss and 
persecution.


While there is no definitive number of species that use tools and there remains
some debate about what constitutes tool use 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals#Definitions_and_terminology>
, here are just some of the best-documented examples of non-human species using 
tools:


Sea otters

Each of these marine mammals carries a personal stone in the loose pouch of 
skin under its foreleg, and uses it to break open hard-shelled prey such as sea 
urchins, mussels, abalones, clams and snails. It either uses the stone as an 
anvil by lying on its back and hitting the shell against the stone on its 
chest, or as a hammer by smashing the stone against abalone to break them free 
from rocks. Sea otters also employ a range of other tools including driftwood, 
broken glass and empty shells.

Dolphins

The intelligence of dolphins is well-known, but in 2005 a pod 
<https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7475-dolphins-teach-their-children-to-use-sponges/>
 of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia, was seen 
tearing off pieces of conical sponges to use as tools. By wrapping the sponges 
over their beaks, they protected themselves from abrasions while stirring the 
sandy ocean floor to uncover prey. The researchers also believe that this 
behaviour ispassed from parents to their young 
<https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7475-dolphins-teach-their-children-to-use-sponges#.U1kzvK1dUQg>
 along mother-daughter lines.

Octopuses

Veined octopus off the coast of Indonesia 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8408233.stm> have been seen using coconut 
shells as tools – scooping up halves, stacking them and transporting them up to 
20m across the seafloor where they reassembled them to use as a shelter when 
needed. The blanket octopus – immune to the sting of the Portuguese man o’war – 
isknown to tear off <http://science.sciencemag.org/content/139/3556/764> their 
stinging tentacles and wield them as a weapon against predators.

Chimpanzees

There have been numerous examples of tool use among chimpanzees since Jane 
Goodall observed them using sticks to fish termites out of mounds in the 1960s. 
Sharpening sticks to use as weapons, using stones to crack open nuts and sticks 
to extract honey are just some of the behaviours scientists have witnessed.

Egyptian vultures

One of this species’ favourite foods is the ostrich egg, which has a hard 
shell. These vulturestake rocks in their beak 
<http://www.arkive.org/egyptian-vulture/neophron-percnopterus/video-08b.html>, 
rear their head and throw the rock repeatedly at the eggs until the shell 
breaks. They have been seen selecting round rather than jagged rocks as tools.

Elephants

Elephants have demonstrated their ability to manufacture and use tools with 
their trunk and feet.Wild Asian elephants 
<http://www.onekind.org/education/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_elephants/>
 use branches to swat flies or scratch themselves, sometimes modifying the tool 
to make it more effective. Captive elephants have been seenproblem-solving by 
moving boxes 
<http://planetsave.com/2011/08/23/zoologists-observe-elephants-aha-moment-in-problem-solving-test-video/>
 to reach food ordropping rocks on to electric fences 
<http://natureinstitute.org/pub/ic/ic5/elephant.htm> to cut supply. One 
elephant in South Africa was observed digging holes, ripping bark from a tree, 
chewing it into the shape of a ball, filling the hole with water, covering over 
it with sand to avoid evaporation, then later going back for a drink.

Woodpecker finch

This finch from the Galapagos Islands has a short beak and tongue, and when 
faced with prey that is inaccessible, flies off to finda cactus spine to prise 
insects <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkdZSemE7gQ> out of tree branches. It 
carries the spine from branch to branch and modifies its tools for use in 
different scenarios.
