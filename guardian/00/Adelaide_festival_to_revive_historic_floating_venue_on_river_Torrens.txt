Riverdance will take on a new meaning when a massive, floating entertainment 
venue is launched for theAdelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> festival in March 2017.

The two-storey, purpose-built Riverbank Palais will open in March on the River 
Torrens, inspired by the Palais de Danse – a floating dance hall popular in 
Adelaide in the 1920s and known as the “Taj Mahal of the Torrens”. The Palais 
de Danse sank in 1928, following mysterious explosions.

Festival co-director Rachel Healy told ABC radio the venue would float on the 
river throughout the festival, hosting live music, DJs and special events. Food 
and wine will be curated by Gill Minervini (Dark Mofo Winter Feast), with the 
surrounding precinct in Elder Park hosting bespoke local food and beverage 
pop-ups.

It’s been two years since the festival had an official hub. “[The Riverbank 
Palais] will be, we hope, a kind of beacon for everyone here,” Healy said.

“It’s an enormous project and the most challenging project of all of the 
festival hubs that the Adelaide festival has created in its history.”

The full Adelaide festival program, under the artistic direction of Healy and 
theatre and film director Neil Armfield, will be released at midday.
