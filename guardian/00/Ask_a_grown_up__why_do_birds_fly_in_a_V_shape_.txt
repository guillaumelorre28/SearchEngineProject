Many birds fly thousands of miles during migrations. Bird flight is hard work, 
and their hearts beat very fast, so it can be exhausting. When birds 
fly together in a V-shape, they reduce the amount of effort they have to make. 
When a bird flaps its wings as it flies, little bits of air come off the end of 
its wings, trailing behind it like an invisible footprint in the sky. Any birds 
following behind can sit in this footprint and get a free lift, which means 
they are do not have to work as hard.

Imagine you were walking in the snow and following someone's footsteps – you 
would have an easier time following the path they left behind, becayse you 
would not have to work hard to crunch through the snow yourself. This is 
similar to what the birds are doing when they are flying in a V – though, 
of course, they are doing it in the sky instead.
