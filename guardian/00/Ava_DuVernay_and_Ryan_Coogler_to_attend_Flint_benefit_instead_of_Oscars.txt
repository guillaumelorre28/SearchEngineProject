Directors Ava DuVernay <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ava-duvernay> (Selma) 
and Ryan Coogler (Creed) have not officially boycotted this year’s Oscars 
ceremony on 28 February as a result of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy – but the 
pair will not be attending.

The duo, along with actor/activist Jesse Williams, comedian Hannibal Buress 
and singer Janelle Monáe are instead slated to participate in a concurrent free

The gathering, dubbed #JUSTICEFORFLINT <https://twitter.com/unitedblackout>, 
is open to the public and presented byBlackout for Human Rights 
<http://www.blackoutforhumanrights.com/>, an activist collective founded by 
Coogler which is devoted to addressing human rights violations in the US. In 
November, the group boycotted Black Friday by hosting a number of events in 
different cities across the US to protest against race-based and class-based 
acts of hate.

Coogler told Buzzfeed 
<http://www.buzzfeed.com/jaimieetkin/ryan-coogler-justice-for-flint-event#.wx1dwloPje>
 that the date of #JUSTICEFORFLINT is just a coincidence – despite the fact 
that he is largely considered snubbed for his work on Creed. The film’s sole 
Oscar nomination went to Sylvester Stallone, who is tipped to win the best 
supporting actor Oscar for his performance. DuVernay was similarly ignored by 
the Academy last year for directing Selma. Coogler stressed that 
#JUSTICEFORFLINT is occurring on Oscar night to coincide with the last weekend 
of Black History month.

“With the #JUSTICEFORFLINT benefit event we will give a voice to the members 
of the community who were the victims of the choices of people in power who are 
paid to protect them, as well as provide them with a night of entertainment, 
unity, and emotional healing,” Coogler said in a statement.

The event will also be live-streamed on revolt.tv <https://revolt.tv/> – 
donations will be collected at the event and via text. Coogler has also invited 
the Flint community to share their stories with the audience.


Coogler is next set to direct Marvel’s Black Panther, while DuVernay has just 
been announced as thedirector 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/ava-duvernay-to-direct-disney-fantasy-a-wrinkle-in-time-from-frozen-writers-script>
 of Disney’s big-budget adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time.
