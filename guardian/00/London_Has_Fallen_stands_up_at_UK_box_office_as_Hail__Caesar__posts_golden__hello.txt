The winner: London Has Fallen

Critics may have queued up to aim punches at the film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/02/london-has-fallen-review-gerard-butler-bromance-brews-as-big-ben-blows>
, but London Has Fallen shrugged off the blows, with a robust UK opening of 
£3.23m from 513 cinemas, including £511,000 in previews. That compares with 
£2.25m, including £652,000 in previews, for predecessorOlympus Has Fallen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/18/olympus-has-fallen-review>, just 
under three years ago. Gerard Butler returns as presidential bodyguard Mike 
Banner, this time saving his POTUS buddy from an ingenious set of terrorist 
attacks that wipe out five world leaders attending the funeral of the British 
prime minister.

Lionsgate’s announcement makes a cheeky sleight of hand by comparing the new 
film’s previews-inclusive total (ie £3.2m) with the first film’s weekend number 
minus previews (£1.6m), thus making the claim thatLondon Has Fallen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/london-has-fallen> “takes home more than 
double its predecessor”. While that’s not really the case, London is a healthy 
44% ahead of Olympus, if the previews-inclusive totals are compared, or 70% 
ahead if the actual weekend grosses are considered. London Has Fallen’s 
MetaCritic score of 28/100 is notably lower than IMDb users’ rating of 6.5/10, 
so it’s clear that critical and popular taste are adrift on this film. Rotten 
Tomatoes tells a similar story, with critics rating it 26% fresh, and 63% of 
users liking it.

The indie winner: Hail, Caesar!

By far the top attraction in indie cinemas nationwide, the Coen brothers’ 
Hail, Caesar! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/hail-caesar-review-george-clooney-bigger-broader-zanier-in-classic-coen-caper>
 has opened with a healthy £1.52m, including modest previews of just under 
£80,000. That’s well up on the Coens’ predecessor, Inside Llewyn Davis, which 
began in January 2014 with £758,000 including previews of £45,000. It is, 
however, down on the debuts of True Grit (£1.82m) and Burn After Reading 
(£2.05m). Their best UK lifetime total so far comes courtesy of True Grit 
(£8.46m).

Hail, Caesar! <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hail-caesar> enjoyed 
particular penetration of the boutique indie chains, playing at every 
Picturehouse, Everyman and Curzon cinema, and was also present in virtually all 
of the other top indie venues. The sector was crying out for a commercially 
appealing title now that awards season is sputtering to a close.

The flops: The Other Side of the Door, The Choice and Truth

Opening at a collective 650 cinemas, three studio releases failed to entice 
many cinema-goers. Opening widest of the trio is Fox’sThe Other Side of the Door
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/the-other-side-of-the-door-review-ghost-thriller>
, a supernatural horror about a child ghost wreaking havoc on his surviving 
family members. The unremarkable genre film began with a poor £263,000 from 335 
cinemas.

That result puts its screen average ahead of Lionsgate’s The Choice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/05/the-choice-review-nicholas-sparks>
, the latest romantic drama adapted from a Nicholas Sparks novel. The Choice 
kicked off with a weak £140,000 from 205 venues. UK grosses for Sparks films 
have been spiralling downwards for a while now. His last effort, The Longest 
Ride, kicked off with £419,000, and before that there were The Best of Me 
(£488,000 plus previews of £149,000), Safe Haven (£812,000) and The Lucky One 
(£830,000 plus previews of £329,000). Back in 2010, Dear John, starring 
Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried, began its UK run with just under £2m, 
including previews of £722,000.

Warner Bros released Truth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/06/truth-review-cate-blanchett-60-minutes-george-w-bush-war-record>
, starring Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford, with little marketing support, 
and a feeble debut of just under £27,000 from 113 sites resulted. This title 
was presumably greenlit with an awards positioning in mind. After it became 
evident that Truth was not going to make headway with voters – and that any 
push on Blanchett this year would be for Carol instead – the film’s fate was 
pretty much sealed.

Secret Cinema rears its head

The latest event from Secret Cinema: Tell No One began its run on 17 February 
and has now enjoyed three weekends of play. Official data gatherer comScore 
didn’t initially include box-office data for the event, but it has suddenly 
popped into the official chart at No 12, with weekend takings of £188,000 from 
a single venue, 2% down on the previous frame, and with a total to date of 
£816,000. Secret Cinema doesn’t run on Monday or Tuesday, so that’s a 15-day 
figure, yielding a daily average of £54,000. The name of the film will be 
revealed after the run ends on 20 March.

£64.50 (standard) and £129 (VIP ticket).

 Why Spotlight should win best picture at the 2016 Oscars 
The best picture Oscar win for Spotlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/spotlight> had a measurable effect on the 
film’s fortunes, with sixth-weekend takings growing by 70% on the previous 
frame to £333,000. The total to date is £5.41m. The Revenant, in contrast, 
dropped by 22% from the previous session – although that decline would 
typically be viewed as a healthy hold. Despite the drop, The Revenant actually 
grossed a bit more at the weekend than Spotlight, and now stands at a stunning 
£22.5m. The top grosser among the best picture Oscar nominees remains The 
Martian with £23.58m, so The Revenant needs to haul in another £1m or so to 
catch it. Both films are from Fox, so the studio has bragging rights this 
awards season either way.

Overall, takings are 2% down on the previous frame, but a handy 11% up on the 
equivalent weekend from 2015, when a very weak session for new releases saw an 
unchanged top three (The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Focus, Fifty Shades 
of Grey). Now cinemas have hopes pinned on the arrival this weekend of Kung Fu 
Panda 3 – which already played solid previews on Saturday and Sunday.Allegiant
