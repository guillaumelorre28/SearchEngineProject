Q I bought a second-hand car four months ago from a local dealer. Since then 
I've had the car in the garage for repairs every month, and the mechanic who 
fixes it has told me it has been in an accident previous to my buying it - he 
could tell this from the framework. Is it the law that the dealer selling me 
the vehicle should have made me aware it had been in a crash previous to the 
purchase? If so, he didn't mention anything to me. Where do I stand with 
getting all or part of my money back? Would the fact I've had the car for four 
months have an effect on this? The repairs I've had done are nothing to do with 
the framework itself - they've been issues with the air conditioning, power 
steering and head gasket.

A If the dealer knew the car had previously been in an accident it should have 
made you aware of this before you bought the car. Its failure to warn you of 
this amounts to a misrepresentation and you are within your rights to return 
the car and claim a full refund on the strength of this alone.

However, the fact the car has been in the garage for repairs for each of the 
four months you have owned it indicates it was not of a satisfactory quality at 
the time of sale. This means you can ask for a refund or replacement on the 
basis of your rights under the Sale of Goods Act. Your right to a refund is not 
prejudiced by the fact you have attempted to get the defects repaired.
