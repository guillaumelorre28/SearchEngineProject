For many of us who are involved in the family justice system, the news that 
the number of adoptions has fallen 12% is not surprising (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/29/adoption-numbers-drop-steeply-as-governments-flagship-policy-falters>
, 30 September). However, for the blame to be laid at the door of local 
authorities is wholly inaccurate. Decisions of the supreme court and the court 
of appeal in 2013 caused judges in the lower courts to be more reluctant to 
approve plans for the adoption of children. More recent court decisions have 
moved the goalposts again, leaving local authorities trying to make sense of it 
all and protect children in the process.

• I note that among the predicted 20 future football stars at Premier League 
clubs (Next generation 2016

, Sport, 5 October) there are virtually no summer births. None were born from 
May through to 30 August (notwithstanding that some may have been born in the 
southern hemisphere). Perhaps summer births are only destined to become cricket 
stars?

• Jamie Oliver seems to have stirred up a storm by calling his chicken, rice 
and chorizo recipe “paella” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/jamie-olivers-paella-chorizo-brings-fractured-spain-together-against-him>
, 5 October). The same ingredients form the basis of one of Delia Smith’s most 
popular recipes, Chicken Basque, published in her Summer Collection in 1993 
without adverse Spanish reaction. It is delicious regardless of what it is 
called.

• Fiji’s rugby sevens coach Ben Ryan (‘Base a Fiji team here in Cornwall – 
they would love it’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/04/ben-ryan-fiji-rugby-rio-olympics-nba-premiership>
, Sport, 5 October) overlooks the small matter that the Fiji climate runs from 
26C to 31C all year. Still, the Cornish rain is good for the complexion, 
allegedly.
