Angela Eagle has warned that politicians must take great care in their use of 
language as she argued that Labour’s leadership candidate,Owen Smith, was right 
to apologise

 after suggesting he would like to “smash” the prime minister back on her heels.

In an interview with the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/29/angela-eagle-theres-no-point-being-sore-labour-leadership>
, the Labour MP who stepped aside to allow Smith the opportunity to challenge 
Jeremy Corbyn alone, said she hadn’t had a chance to discuss the incident with 
Smith, but added: “He should have and has apologised.”

Asked if politicians needed to be more careful with language, she replied: “As 
someone that has heard cruel words spoken about me, I know that language 
matters. And we’ve all got a responsibility to be sensitive with our use of 
language.

“Owen has shown a capacity to recognise and apologise for insensitivity and 
that’s important.”

Owen Smith: Labour should ‘smash’ Theresa May ‘back on her heels’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jul/27/owen-smith-labour-proposes-3-billion-wealth-tax-fund-nhs-theresa-may-video>
However, she called it “extraordinarily disingenuous” for a Corbyn spokesman 
to “cloak Jeremy in the mantle of feminism by saying that we have to be 
sensitive about our use of language, especially around women MPs”.

Eagle said she remembered the controversy in 2014 around comments from 
Corbyn’s campaign chair, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and claims that he 
talked about people wanting to“lynch” then Conservative MP Esther McVey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/11/speaker-apologises-to-tory-minister-for-comparing-her-to-washing-machine>
.

In a wide-ranging interview, Eagle also hit out at McDonnell for failing to 
reach out across the party during her time asshadow business secretary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/14/labour-shadow-cabinet-angela-eagle-extra-title-women-row>
. “I was in the second most important economic ministry – the highest woman, 
because of the shadow first secretary of state job – and I scheduled a meeting 
every week with John McDonnell to talk about economics,” she said. “Every 
single one of them except one, in nine months, was cancelled. Just turned up in 
the diary cancelled.”

A spokesman for McDonnell insisted that he had never called for violence 
against McVey, saying he was reporting comments shouted out by one of her 
constituents during an event. “It’s something he condemned at the time and he 
condemns all threats of violence against MPs,” the spokesman said.

He did not deny, however, that meetings had been cancelled, arguing that “like 
most busy politicians, events in their diaries were regularly being 
rescheduled”. But he claimed the shadow chancellor had an “open-door policy” to 
shadow cabinet colleagues, and made his staff available to Eagle and her office.

“In contrast, her office did not always show a willingness to work 
constructively,” the spokesman added.

Eagle told the Guardian that she was reluctant to talk about abuse and 
intimidation,including one death threat that resulted in an arrest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/man-arrested-angela-eagle-death-threats>
, since she chose to trigger the contest against Corbyn in the first place, 
before stepping aside for Smith.

“I don’t want to dwell on it, partially because if I dwell on it too much, or 
I talk about it too much, I just get a load more,” she said, arguing that much 
of it had passed, and that she wanted to stay “positive”. She responded to 
accusations over social media that she and her team had fabricated the details 
of threats and harassment, suggesting people just needed to look at the 
internet.

Eagle responded directly to the torrent of abuse about one specific allegation 
that abrick had been put through her constituency office window 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/21/angela-eagle-stops-walk-in-surgeries-amid-security-concerns>
 on the night after she launched her campaign against Corbyn.The incident has 
triggered a YouTube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppnKHmuVA1s> 
demonstrating that the window was on a stairwell in a communal part of the 
building, with some questioning if it happened at all.

“I’ve been in that building for a lot of my 24 years as an MP, it was the 
night of my launch, we’d never had a brick through the window before. People 
can draw their own conclusions,” said Eagle. “I didn’t actually say anything. 
It was reported in my local news and now if you look at Twitter I’m meant to 
have done it myself, ordered it to be done ... It is a joke. It’s post-truth 
politics and it’s nonsensical. I’m not a liar.”

Eagle said she was not taking the decision of colleagues to back Smith over 
her to heart, arguing that taking things too personally could turn a person 
into a “completely screwed-up individual that hates the world, and I don’t 
think that is the definition of me”.

Eagle praised Smith for the policy-packed speech earlier in the week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/owen-smith-pledges-to-smash-austerity-in-pitch-to-labours-left>
, during which he made the gaffe about Theresa May, and spoke about her desire 
to rebalance the economy in an interview that suggests she could be in line for 
the shadow chancellorship if Corbyn is beaten.

“The economic circumstances demand that we seek more fundamental solutions 
than tinkering with the edges of capitalism. We need to fundamentally recast 
the role of the state in how it supports people throughout their lives, because 
our lives, our economic lives in particular, are changing at such a rate of 
knots,” she said.

“He’s not pushing it to the left per se; he’s trying to do what all social 
democratic parties need to do, which is rebalance our economies and politics to 
reflect changing times.”
