Lleyton Hewitt survived a stiff examination from Swedish qualifier Magnus 
Larsson to win 6-3 3-6 6-1 6-7 6-2 this morning and avoid the humiliation of a 
second consecutive first round loss at the Australian Open.

The world's finest was knocked out of last year's Melbourne tournament after 
suffering a bout of chickenpox and almost suffered the same fate again after a 
surprisingly tough encounter from the Swede, a former top 10 player now ranked 
108th in the world.

Having survived, however, Hewitt has insisted his performaces will go from 
strength to strength.

"There was still a sour taste left in my mouth after last year and it was good 
to come out today and finally get rid of it," he reflected afterwards."I'm just 
going to get better and better from now on.

"There's always ways to get out of tough situations and I've been in enough 
now that I've got confidence," he added.

"I don't hit the panic button as much as I would have a few years ago and that 
just comes with experience and being out there playing the big matches. It's 
something I think I've handled well, the five-setters I've played.

Larsson had broken Hewitt's serve for the only time in the match to take the 
second set, then snatched the fourth in a tiebreak to force a deciding fifth 
set.

Jolted into action, Hewitt quickly regained control by breaking the Swede 
twice to seal victory after three-and-a-quarter hours and set up a second round 
encounter with fellow Australian Todd Larkham.

Hewitt won the US Open in 2001 and Wimbledon last year but says his main aim 
this year is to win the Australian Open. The last Aussie to win the title was 
Mark Edmondson in 1976.

He took last week off to save his energy for the Open after a mixed 
performance at the Hopman Cup where he helped Australia reach the final but 
lost singles matches to Jiri Novak and James Blake.
