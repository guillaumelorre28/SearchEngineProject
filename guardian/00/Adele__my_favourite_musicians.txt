As a band I love their vibe, the way they look and interact – all with their 
own little character going on. But I’m obsessed with [lead singer]Brittany 
Howard <https://twitter.com/blkfootwhtfoot?lang=en>. There’s something about 
Brittany that puts fire in my soul. She reminds me of Etta James, Ann Peebles – 
she’s so fucking full of soul, overflowing, dripping, that I almost can’t 
handle it. On their most recent album [Sound & Color 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/19/alabama-shakes-sound-and-color-review>
], there’s a song calledDon’t Wanna Fight 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5OX7CO26c>. Brittany comes in with a scream: 
“YOOOOOOOOOOOW!” I’d love to experiment more with my own voice like that. She’s 
exceptional, she blows my mind. I almost want to start playing the electric 
guitar, just to be more like her. Back in 2013, she was in the next-door 
dressing room at the Grammys. We were both getting ready – I think I was 
putting on my Spanx – and we met. It turned out she’d brought her grandmother 
to the Grammys. My love went even deeper for her at that point.
Check out: Don’t Wanna Fight <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5OX7CO26c> – 
when I first heard that in my car, I almost had to pull over… blew my mind.

 Karen Dalton. 
When I was making 19, my manager suggested I cover a Bob Dylan song, Make You 
Feel My Love <http://www.youtube.com/watch?vu003d0put0_a--Ng>. I didn’t really 
know much about Dylan at the time, but I suddenly got interested, got into his 
back history – and that’s how I foundKaren Dalton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/23/folk>. She used to open for 
Dylan back in the day in Greenwich Village. There’s not a lot of her music out 
there, she died quite young. But her voice! Something haunting there, even 
eerie. The tone is amazing – it reminded me a lot of Amy Winehouse. They both 
have almost a slur in their voice, which is so charismatic.

Check out: Little Bit Of Rain <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auiJPav_aPo> is 
the song, from an album of the same name. Listen to this and you’ll understand.

When we were growing up, we had mutual friends. I used to go and watch them 
play at the Bug Bar in Brixton when I was 14… I remember them getting signed to 
Fiction and how exciting that was. I’ve still got one of their demo CDs, in a 
photocopied and stapled-together packet, which had their early songLatchmere 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?vu003dfaMEnZQT2f8> on it. Latchmere was a 
swimming pool we all went to; it had a really good wave machine. That’s how 
their song goes: “Latchmere’s/ Got a wave machine.” When I watched the 
Maccabees play at Glastonbury this year, it was so moving – seeing all those 
random people singing their song back at them, about a little swimming pool 
that was a huge part of my youth. It took me back… I’d say they’re the most 
consistent band in the UK right now. Without fail, they deliver with their 
songs, and I find them very inspiring for that. They know who they are; as 
individuals, as friends, as a band. They’re lovely boys – and with their new 
record,Marks to Prove It 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/30/the-maccabees-marks-to-prove-it-review-muddles-the-brain-like-a-hangover>
, they had their first No 1 album.

Check out: Toothpaste Kisses <http://www.youtube.com/watch?vu003d8SJmWSWQgdM>, 
from the first album. It’s just so comforting; I feel like I’m being cuddled 
every time I hear that song.

My favourite video of all time is actually for James Blake’s A Case Of You, 
the one that has Rebecca Hall in it – I can’t watch it without my entire body 
shaking. But, for what a video really, really should be, for pure Thriller-like 
entertainment value, you can’t get much better than the video by Macklemore and 
Ryan Lewis forDowntown <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhoLcsr8GA>. The 
dancing! The marching! The mopeds! The chariots! You have to give in to that 
video – how ridiculous it is. It played a lot with hip-hop culture – and I love 
hip-hop culture, I love the bigness, the grandness, the showing-off-ness of it, 
I appreciate it and I revel in it. But there’s something about these guys 
mocking the extravagance of it that I really responded to. It really made me 
laugh – I was in tears watching it. And actually I think you can see Macklemore 
pissing himself laughing at the end… Ryan Lewis, who produces the records, 
produced and directed the video. Epic.
