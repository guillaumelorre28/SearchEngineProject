Has ITV chief Adam Crozier struck gold in the search for a new hit 
entertainment format? Asked about the now-legendaryboardroom bust-up between 
Sir Alan Sugar and Richard Desmond 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/mar/01/lord-sugar-richard-desmond-bust-up>, 
Crozier told Television magazine for RTS grandees: "I've talked about the need 
for new entertainment shows. I've often wondered that if I had had a camera in 
there, we might have solved our entertainment problem. It was certainly fun 
while it lasted. Most times it was probably my most entertaining meeting of the 
month." Only "probably"?! A fly-on-the-wall doco set in ITV's boardroom would 
surely be ratings dynamite.
