Stand-up comic and part-time music hack

Stewart Lee will curate an ATP event in 2016. The second of the ATP 2.0 
festivals will take place atPontins camp in Prestatyn 
<http://www.pontins.com/holiday-parks/prestatyn-sands-holiday-park/>, north 
Wales, from 15-17 April, featuring a lineup handpicked by the revered comedian.

The bill has not been announced yet, but the following statement from Lee 
should provide some hints as to his musical preference:

Of all the ATPs I’ve attended, the 2001 weekend, when Tortoise curated it and 
laid American free jazz, European improv noise, alternative country rock, 
alienating stand-up comedy, ambient electronica, eighties hardcore, seventies 
CBGBs nostalgia, smart-arse post punk, Dutch anarcho-jazz and all manner of 
unexpected cross-currents on curious young people remains a pivotal point in my 
musical education. It’s a great honour to be allowed to attempt something 
similar. Bring a bucket, spade, swimwear and an open mind.

Although the festival is normally overseen by musicians, Lee joins a select 
number of alternative cultural figures who’ve curated ATP, including the 
Simpsons’ Matt Groening and theChapman Brothers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/chapman>, the latter hosting the 
first of these all-new ATP 2.0 festivals in November 2015.
