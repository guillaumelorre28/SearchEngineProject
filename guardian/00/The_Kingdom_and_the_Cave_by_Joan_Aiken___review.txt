What an amazing, heart warming novel. The Kingdom and the Cave is a unique, 
beautifully crafted story of friendship adventure with a touch of magic and 
fantasy. As I read this book I simply could not stop smiling, I felt as if I 
were in the story with the characters. The story is set in the days of Kings 
and Queens and the originality paints a perfect picture in your mind. The story 
is based around a talking cat named Mickle and a young Prince named Michael as 
well as an old but wise horse, Minerva. The friendship around the animals and 
the prince is beautiful to watch as the writer creates unique behaviours for 
each character.


The plot and how the story is set up is excellent and Joan Aiken has put in 
nice twists and turns when you least expect it. The story always has an 
engaging event happening that keeps you enthralled and interested. Joan Aiken 
has also used descriptive words and has worked hard to paint a picture in your 
mind for every scene and character. As I read this book it was like there was a 
movie of the book going on in my head.

I recommend this book for ages 9 and up. This is a book for people who like 
adventure, mystery, kidnap, magic, fantasy, talking animals and a friendship so 
amazing that by the end of the book you will be connected to the characters 
like they are to each other.
