The ABC and SBS will be forced to remove themselves from the “goat’s cheese 
curtain” by holding community forums under a deal struck between the government 
and SenatorDavid Leyonhjelm <https://www.theguardian.com/world/david-leyonhjelm>
.

Leyonhjelm announced the deal for his vote on the Australian Building and 
Construction Commission bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/28/coalition-juggles-crossbench-deals-on-abcc-and-water-in-final-sitting-week>
 on Monday, in addition to a promise that the federal government lead a reform 
process to loosen suppression orders on court reporting.

But the deal could still be torn up if the government agrees to further water 
buybacks in its horse trading with theNick Xenophon Team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon-team>, Leyonhjelm 
warned.

Coalition juggles crossbench deals on ABCC and water in final sitting week

At a press conference in Canberra, Leyonhjelm confirmed that the government 
had agreed to removethe reverse onus of proof in the ABCC bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/21/behind-the-industrial-relations-bills-that-could-trigger-a-double-dissolution-election>
, which would have required employees and unions to prove they took action 
because of a reasonable concern about an imminent safety concern, rather than 
to coerce employers.

“Employees should not be wondering about their legal position like this when 
it comes to matters of safety,” he said.

The second plank of the deal requires that the ABC and SBS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sbs> hold open community board forums after 
at least half their board meetings each year, with at least two of these to be 
held in regional areas.

The public broadcasters must pay for the meetings from their current budgets 
and, if they refuse to hold them, the government will direct them to, or force 
them with legislation.

Leyonhjelm said the changes were “not necessarily” directed at their coverage 
but he said there was a perception that “the ABC and SBS live inside the goat’s 
cheese curtain”, as Bernard Salt, a writer for the Australian, put it.

“I hear a lot of feedback, I hear it all the time, that the ABC in particular 
and SBS to a lesser extent are unrepresentative,” he said.

Leyonhjelm said the public broadcasters tended to be “self-referencing”, 
catered to an innercity urban audience and did not reflect the views of people 
in regional areas.

“This has been said a lot in relation to the vote that One Nation attracts and 
the vote that Donald Trump attracts in the US,” he said.

The final plank of the deal is that the federal government will push for 
states and territories to consider reforming suppression order regimes to 
ensure they:

 * Specify the topic to which they relate and only suppress such information 
that is necessary to achieve the order’s purpose. 
 * State a time limit on their duration. 
 * Give media an express right to seek a review of the order’s scope or 
duration. 
Asked whether that was too weak a bargain, Leyonhjelm said the commonwealth 
could not bind the states to modify their suppression order regimes.

“What it can do is improve its own suppression regimes and make them open as a 
model to the states, and it can also pursue this via the [Council of Australian 
Governments] system – and that is the undertaking the commonwealth has given 
me.”

On Saturday Leyonhjelm had warned that if the government “caved in” to 
Xenophon on theMurray-Darling Basin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/murray-darling-basin> plan it would 
lose his vote on the ABCC.

On Monday Leyonhjelm said if the government promised further water buybacks to 
achieve 450 extra gigalitres for the river in return for Xenophon’s votes, he 
would vote down the ABCC bill.

He said there was “still a question mark” over whether the government would do 
that but said it had given him assurances it would go no further than the 2013 
Murray-Darling Basin agreement.

That agreement set a non-binding target of a further 450 gigalitres for the 
river provided it was economically and socially responsible.

Xenophon has still not come to an agreement with the government on the ABCC 
bill and the water plan, in part because the government has not agreed to all 
his proposed amendments on procurement of goods from Australian industry.

At a press conference on Monday, Xenophon suggested a deal could be struck by 
Tuesday but rated the chance of the ABCC bill passing at only 50-50.

Xenophon said his negotiations on water were about “a fundamental promise 
being met” and he was just insisting on “progress” on the 2013 Murray-Darling 
agreement.

He said the Murray-Darling Basin plan had mechanisms to achieve the 450 
gigalitres through water efficiency measures. Up to 650 gigalitres could be 
achieved through projects at Menindee Lakes, Barmah Choke and Yarrawonga Weir, 
he said.

At a press conference with his Nationals colleagues on Monday, the agriculture 
and water minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the first two were already underway and 
the last was not eligible under the Murray-Darling plan.

Leyonhjelm said he would criticise the government if it found extra funding 
for water efficiency measures but it wouldn’t constitute a breach of his deal, 
only further water buybacks.

Joyce did not explain how the government could satisfy both Xenophon and 
Leyonhjelm on water policy, instead emphasising the need for “works and 
measures” to return water to the river.

Senator Derryn Hinch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/22/abcc-bill-stands-good-chance-of-passing-derryn-hinch-says>
 said a deal on the ABCC in the next 24 hours was possible and rated the bill’s 
odds at 70-30 or 60-40.

Hinch renewed his call for the building code attached to the ABCC bill not to 
be applied retrospectively.
