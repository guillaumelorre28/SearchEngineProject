An Australian surgeon kidnapped by jihadists in Burkina Faso 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/burkina-faso> nearly a year ago, and whose 
whereabouts remain unknown, has been declared a citizen of the west African 
nation, an official decree announced on Wednesday.

Ken Elliott was abducted along with his wife Jocelyn

, 76, an Australian humanitarian worker, in January 2016 by al-Qaida-linked 
jihadists from Djibo, a dusty town near the border with Mali and Niger. The 
couple had run the sole medical clinic there since 1972.

Jocelyn Elliott was released by her captors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/australian-woman-jocelyn-elliott-freed-by-al-qaida-kidnappers-in-burkina-faso>
 in February, but her husband has not been seen and it is believed he is being 
held outside Burkina.


The kidnapping – claimed by the Islamist group Ansar Dine – prompted an 
outpouring of support for the Elliotts. The people of Djibo pleaded for the 
couple’s release on Facebook and hundreds of students with placards reading 
“Free Elliott” took to the streets of the town with their teachers.

Djibo residents have launched an internet petition demanding that Elliott be 
freed.

“Arthur Kenneth Elliott, born 11 November 1934 in Perth, in Australia ... a 
surgeon” has been naturalised Burkinabe, according to the decree, with a list 
of 84 people who obtained the nationality.

The couple’s abduction coincided with a jihadist assault on an upmarket hotel 
in Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/security-forces-battle-suspected-jihadists-in-burkina-faso-capital>
, that left at least 30 people dead, including many foreigners.

Jocelyn Elliott has refused to leave Burkina Faso, vowing to wait for her 
husband’s return to continue their medical work.

• This article was amended on 27 December 2016. Ken Elliott has been missing 
since January 2016, not January 2015 as an earlier version said.
