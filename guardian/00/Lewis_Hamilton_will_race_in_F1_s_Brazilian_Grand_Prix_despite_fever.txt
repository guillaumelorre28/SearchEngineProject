Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> will be fit 
to contest this weekend’s Brazilian Grand Prix despite suffering from a fever.

The newly crowned triple world champion travelled to São Paulo on Wednesday – 
a day later than planned – on medical advice. He was forced to cancel a 
sponsors’ event, leading to reports locally that his participation at the 
penultimate race of the season was under threat.

A Mercedes spokesperson, however, has confirmed Hamilton, who sealed his third 
titleat the US Grand Prix last month

, will race on Sunday.

Earlier this week, the 30-year-old said a win in Brazil would be a “salute” to 
Ayrton Senna <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ayrton-senna>. Hamilton has 
never won at Interlagos in eight previous attempts.

He finished second

 behind his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg last year and, in his final race 
for McLaren in 2012, was vying for the lead with Nico Hülkenberg before a 
race-ending collision. Hamilton is hopeful of ending his winless streak at the 
Brazilian Grand Prix this weekend.

“This was the home race for Ayrton, so it was a dream of mine to race in São 
Paulo when I was younger and I always feel his presence when I’m there,” said 
Hamilton, who has spoken of “carrying the baton” for the Brazilian after 
surpassing his number of career wins and emulating him with a hat-trick of 
titles.

“He was such a huge hero in Brazil and it’s humbling that I always get such a 
warm response there. It’s amazing to think that it took Ayrton eight attempts 
to win this race and it’s one of the few I haven’t yet won myself. If I can 
change that this weekend it would be a salute to him and another highlight to 
add to this amazing year, so I’ll be going all out to make that happen.”
