Blue Monday had inauspicious beginnings: depending on which of New Order's 
myth-puncturing stories you believe, it was written either to test out a new 
drum machine or in order to have a piece of music that would in effect play 
itself live, allowing the encore-shy band to leave the stage early. But 
whatever the reason, it was a defining point in their career. For some time 
they had been inching away from Joy Division's gloomy shadow towards a new 
sound, influenced by early 80s Italian electronic disco, but this was the 
moment when everything clicked: a song without a chorus, on which the closest 
thing to a recognisable hook was the juddering drum machine pattern, which 
proved commercially unstoppable. Not even a flatly dreadful Top of the Pops 
performance could stop it becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch single of all 
time. But it symbolised something more thanNew Order

sleeves cost so much to manufacture that their label Factory lost money on 
every copy sold: in that tale was seen proof that some indie labels really did
