I don’t think that this, like Italy’s win over Belgium yesterday, was the 
victory of a united team against a bunch of disparate individuals. Austria were 
OK, rather than wretched.Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> 
overperformed, and took one of few chances. Five minutes later Austria went 
down to 10 men, and the die was cast.

What a fantastic result for Hungary, the rank outsiders in Group F. And what a 
massive optimism-deflator for Austria and the “euphoria” that was reportedly 
being experienced in their home nation. It was not the finest game of the 
tournament, butHungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> 
definitely exceeded expectations, in the quality of their passing, defending 
and, ultimately, finishing. I’m not sure they should be booking any mid-July 
open-top bus tours quite yet, but still, very nicely done.

90+3 mins: Alaba takes a free kick on the right, and Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> work it well to leave Arnautovic 
free on the edge of the area. His shot, through a heavily congested box, flies 
straight into Kiraly’s stomach.

GOAL! Austria 0-2 Hungary (Stieber, 87 mins)

Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> have won a game! 
Austria commit seven players to an attack and then lose the ball. Priskin, 35 
yards from his own goal, plays the ball into Austria half and Stieber hares 
after it, sprints into the box and then chips past Almer!

85 mins: It’s all getting a bit testy now. Fiola goes down after a tackle from 
Fuchs – another horribly twisted ankle, it turns out –Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> play on, and then Nagy flies in 
late on the touchline, fortunately without making much contact.

82 mins: It has, surprisingly, taken nearly 82 minutes for Franz Ferdinand to 
get a mention. “I’m surprised that neither the Austrians nor Hungarians have 
Archduke Ferdinand in goal,” writes Ben Bamford. “He would have been eligible 
to play for both and historically proved to be an excellent shot-blocker.”

80 mins: Nemeth runs into Schöpf in midfield when really there was no need. 
Both players go down for a while, and when the referee eventually helps Nemeth 
to his feet he shows him a yellow card for his troubles.

Aleksandar Dragovic is sent off!

67 mins: The reason the whistle went was that Dragovic, in desperately trying 
to get the ball in the penalty area, had hit Tamas Kadar in the shin. The 
referee thought this worth a second caution. To me it looked like a foul, but 
no more.
 Dragovic is shown the second yellow card by referee Clement Turpin.

into another thicket of players, gets it back again, and then slams into the

64 mins: Scalai and several of his team-mates leap into the crowd to 
celebrate. After 18 months without a goal, that’s got to feel good. There 
appears to be no automatic caution for doing so, either.

@Simon_Burnton <https://twitter.com/Simon_Burnton> Could use better defending 
there, like Rio and Beckenbauer. You know, Franz... Ferdinand...

GOAL! Austria 0-1 Hungary (Szalai, 63 mins)

He’s only gone and scored! Three good touches from him, first a chest down to 
Kleinheisler, then a lay-off to the same player, and then he collects the 
through ball, looks like he might have miscontrolled it, but then flings out a 
leg to stab the ball beyond the advancing Almer and into the net!

Bye!

Right then, I’m off. It’s been memorable. I leave you with a parting gift, in 
the shape of Stuart James’s match report:

for Yeovil:

I don’t think that this, like Italy’s win over Belgium yesterday, was the 
victory of a united team against a bunch of disparate individuals. Austria were 
OK, rather than wretched.Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> 
overperformed, and took one of few chances. Five minutes later Austria went 
down to 10 men, and the die was cast.

What a fantastic result for Hungary, the rank outsiders in Group F. And what a 
massive optimism-deflator for Austria and the “euphoria” that was reportedly 
being experienced in their home nation. It was not the finest game of the 
tournament, butHungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> 
definitely exceeded expectations, in the quality of their passing, defending 
and, ultimately, finishing. I’m not sure they should be booking any mid-July 
open-top bus tours quite yet, but still, very nicely done.
 
As he comes to terms with that defeat, Arnautovic is doing a mighty one-man 
strop in the middle of the pitch.

90+5 mins: Okotie’s cross is headed clear, and the referee blows his whistle – 
it’s over!
 
90+3 mins: Alaba takes a free kick on the right, and Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> work it well to leave Arnautovic 
free on the edge of the area. His shot, through a heavily congested box, flies 
straight into Kiraly’s stomach.
 
90+1 mins: Schöpf, with Arnautovic running into the area and into space to his 
left, chooses instead to blast a shot wide.
 
90+1 mins: Into stoppage time we go, and there’ll be at least five minutes of 
it!
 
89 mins: Fantasztikus góljával! I have not put that phrase through any kind of 
translation software, but I think I can work it out. In other news, Pinter 
comes on to replace Nemeth.

Hungary <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> have won a game! 
Austria commit seven players to an attack and then lose the ball. Priskin, 35 
yards from his own goal, plays the ball into Austria half and Stieber hares 
after it, sprints into the box and then chips past Almer!

85 mins: It’s all getting a bit testy now. Fiola goes down after a tackle from 
Fuchs – another horribly twisted ankle, it turns out –Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> play on, and then Nagy flies in 
late on the touchline, fortunately without making much contact.
 
84 mins: Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> work the ball 
to Alaba, running into the area from the right, and his left-foot shot deflects 
over. Kiraly collects the corner.
 
82 mins: It has, surprisingly, taken nearly 82 minutes for Franz Ferdinand to 
get a mention. “I’m surprised that neither the Austrians nor Hungarians have 
Archduke Ferdinand in goal,” writes Ben Bamford. “He would have been eligible 
to play for both and historically proved to be an excellent shot-blocker.”
 
80 mins: Nemeth runs into Schöpf in midfield when really there was no need. 
Both players go down for a while, and when the referee eventually helps Nemeth 
to his feet he shows him a yellow card for his troubles.
 
79 mins: A change for the leaders – Kleinheisler goes off, and Stieber comes 
on.
 
79 mins: Austria have the ball for a while in front of Austria’s defence – all 
nine men of it – but find no way through the ranks, and when they try to go 
over them Kiraly collects.
 
77 mins: Harnik off, Schöpf on for Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria>, their final substitution.
 
76 mins: Gera nips in to steal the ball in midfield, for the nth time today. 
He hasn’t lost the magic.
 
75 mins: Szalai’s goal was his first for 59 matches and Hungary’s first in a 
European Championship finals for 16,068 days.
 
73 mins: A chance for Austria! Fuchs crosses low from the left and Sabitzer 
runs onto it, slamming high and wide from 15 yards.
 
71 mins: Oooh! Nemeth shoots across goal from the edge of the area, left to 
right, and the ball was arrowing towards the bottom corner before Almer tipped 
it wide!
 
70 mins: Austria continue to push forward, but increasingly it is Hungary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hungary> who are profiting from their 
ambition. Priskin had a glimpse of goal from his first touch though nothing 
came of it, and Nagy just slammed a shot over the bar from 20 yards.
 
69 mins: The goalscorer goes off, and Tamas Priskin, who I once saw have an 
extremely good game against, I think, Wigan, though the match was rained off in 
the second half.
 
68 mins: Austria attack, Sabitzer crosses, and Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> to a man go wild as it hits 
Kadar, demanding a penalty for handball. The referee says no, and this is one 
call he gets right.
 
67 mins: The reason the whistle went was that Dragovic, in desperately trying 
to get the ball in the penalty area, had hit Tamas Kadar in the shin. The 
referee thought this worth a second caution. To me it looked like a foul, but 
no more.

66 mins: Hinteregger shoots into a thicket of players, gets it back, shoots 
into another thicket of players, gets it back again, and then slams into the 
bottom corner – but the whistle has already gone!
 
65 mins: Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> make a 
substitution, taking off Janko and bringing on Rubin Okotie.
 
64 mins: Scalai and several of his team-mates leap into the crowd to 
celebrate. After 18 months without a goal, that’s got to feel good. There 
appears to be no automatic caution for doing so, either.
Tom Price (@sixstringtom) 
@Simon_Burnton <https://twitter.com/Simon_Burnton> Could use better defending 
there, like Rio and Beckenbauer. You know, Franz... Ferdinand...

He’s only gone and scored! Three good touches from him, first a chest down to 
Kleinheisler, then a lay-off to the same player, and then he collects the 
through ball, looks like he might have miscontrolled it, but then flings out a 
leg to stab the ball beyond the advancing Almer and into the net!

60 mins: A howler in Austria’s defence presents Szalai with the ball – albeit 
only just beyond the centre circle – but his first touch is cataclysmically 
awful, andAustria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> get it back.
 
59 mins: Marcel Sabitzer comes on for Junuzovic.
 
57 mins: A bit of a delay while a couple of injuries are dealt with. Janko 
doesn’t stay down long – he lost a header and went down with what appeared to 
be wounded pride – but Junuzovic, who turned his ankle in the first half, is 
coming off.
 
55 mins: Now that’s a shot! Dzsudzsak collects the ball 30 yards out, advances 
a few paces and fair wallops the ball goalwards, only for Almer to tip it round 
the post. The corner comes to nought.
