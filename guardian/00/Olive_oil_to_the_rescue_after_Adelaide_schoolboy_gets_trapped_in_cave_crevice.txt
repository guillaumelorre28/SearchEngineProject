Olive oil helped free a schoolboy who spent several hours stuck in the crevice 
of a South Australian cave.

Police say the 12-year-old Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> boy was on a school tour 
of the Naracoorte cave on Thursday when he became wedged in a crevice about 3pm.

Emergency service crews were called at 5.30pm to help pry him out of the spot, 
about 15 metres underground, after several failed attempts from others.

The crews chipped away at the rock and used a harness and some olive oil to 
free the boy by about 8pm.

He was assessed at the local Naracoorte hospital, where he stayed overnight, 
and had only minor grazes.

A spokeswoman for his Aberfoyle Park primary school, the Pilgrim school, said 
his teachers had been impressed by his bravery and the efforts of the emergency 
workers.

She said the cave tour was part of a school camp, which the boy is expected to 
rejoin on Friday.
