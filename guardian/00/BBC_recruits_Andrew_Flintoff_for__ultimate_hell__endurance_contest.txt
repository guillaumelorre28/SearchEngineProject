Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff will front a new BBC2 show, Special Forces: Ultimate 
Hell Week, in which contestants will be put through SAS and navy Seal tasks to 
find Britain’s “toughest recruit”.


Having tried his hand as a boxer and a panel game team captain on Sky’s 
Bafta-winning A League of Their Own, Flintoff’s next challenge will be fronting 
the BBC2 show, which sounds like a special forces version of The Apprentice.

Flintoff said: “I have always had an interest in the armed forces and what it 
takes, both physically and mentally.

“The contestants are going to be pushed to their very limits and it is going 
to be a great insight into what our armed forces go through on a daily basis.”

The six-part series will put participants “under intense pressure” and “push 
their physical and mental endurance to the limit” by drill sergeants who will 
presumably do a lot of screaming like this.

 Not the new BBC2 show. Features language not for the faint-hearted 
It promises “physical and mental challenges designed to break the most 
hardened soldiers”, reflecting the selection process used by the US navy Seals, 
the Philippines’ Navsog (Naval Special Operations Group), the Russian Spetsnaz 
(Special Purpose Forces) as well as the UK’s SAS.

BBC2 controller Kim Shillinglaw said it was a “lively new format”. “It will be 
fascinating to see what sort of person survives to the end,” she added.

It certainly will. The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc>, announcing 
the show on Wednesday, said “each new day will bring a new living nightmare”, 
with participants “having to endure constant exercise drills, impossible mind 
‘games’, lonely enforced marches, escape, interrogation drills and pain.

“The series will give a unique insight into who will endure and why. Viewers 
will discover what kind of person makes it through and who walks away.”

It will broadcast on BBC2 in the autumn.
