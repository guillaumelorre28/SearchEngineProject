Avatar sequels 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sigourney-weaver-avatar-sequels-as-710546>
, despite having been killed off in the 2009 box-office behemoth.

However, Cameron said in a statement that Weaver would portray a new character 
in the trio of follow-up films, which are expected to begin production later 
this year.

"Sigourney and I have a long creative history, dating back to 1985 when we 
made Aliens," said the Canadian film-maker. "We're good friends who've always 
worked well together, so it just feels right that she's coming back for the
Avatar <https://www.theguardian.com/film/avatar> sequels.

"Her character of Grace Augustine, as fans know, died in the first movie, so 
she's playing a different and in many ways more challenging character in the 
upcoming films. We're both looking forward to this new creative challenge, the 
latest chapter in our long and continuing collaboration."

Weaver hinted in September 2012 that chain-smoking exobiologist Augustine 
might be returning for future films. "Jim says no one ever dies in science 
fiction," she told ComingSoon.net. "He's told me the stories for the next two 
movies, and I have to say that they're absolutely wonderful and there's a real 
treat in store. Now we just have to make them."

It won't be the first time Weaver has risen from the dead on film. She 
returned as an alien-human clone of her character Ellen Ripley in 1997's Alien: 
Resurrection, and said earlier this month thatshe would consider further films 
in the long-running sci-fi/horror saga

The US actor is also expected to reprise her role as musician Dana Barrett in a 
forthcomingthird Ghostbusters movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/09/ghostbusters-3-sigourney-weaver-son>
 in which her on-screen son will battle the series' trademark spooky miscreants.

Weaver won't be alone in returning to Avatar despite her character's apparent 
demise.Stephen Lang is also expected to be back

as musclebound villain Colonel Quaritch in all three sequels, despite having 
ended the first movie with two Na'avi arrows through the chest.

Avatar 2, 3 and 4 will also feature returning stars Sam Worthington, as 
disabled soldier turned swashbuckling Na'avi rebel Jake Sully, and Zoe Saldana 
as his alien paramour Neytiri.

Released in 2009, Avatar has made $2.7bn (Â£1.6bn) worldwide and is the 
highest-grossing film of all time.
