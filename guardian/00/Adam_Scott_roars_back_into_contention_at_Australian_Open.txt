Adam Scott <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-scott> has charged to 
within two shots of the lead midway through his second round of the Australian 
Open in Sydney.

After a disappointing three-over-par 74 on Thursday left him in danger of 
missing the halfway cut for the first time in his 15-year professional career, 
Scott picked up four shots on his opening nine on Friday.

Starting from the 10th tee, the world No 3 ignited his round with a brilliant 
eagle on the 459-metre par-5 14th hole.

He split the fairway with a huge drive, struck a mid-iron to about four metres 
and drained the putt to apply the pressure on playing partner and first-round 
leader Jordan Spieth.

Scott backed up his eagle with birdies on the 16th and 18th holes to reach the 
turn in 31 to surge to one under for the championship.

Spieth bogeyed the 11th and 13th holes to allow Sydney’s Aron Price to claim a 
share of the lead before he had even teed off for his second round.

Rod Pampling was another big mover on Friday, four straight birdies on his 
outward nine briefly vaulting the veteran into a tie for the lead.

All players will wear a black ribbon during the second round to honour Phillip 
Hughes.

The former Australian Test batsman’s death on Thursday shocked all at the 
AustralianGolf <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf> Club and, to honour 
their fellow sportsman, players will be given the ribbons before teeing off on 
Friday.

Championship director Trevor Herden said it was a sign of solidarity in the 
sporting community as the nation grieved the loss of one of its top 
professional sportsmen.

“Not just as athletes, but as a community, the loss hit hard today and we feel 
it’s the right thing to do to show our tournament and the players are right 
behind the Hughes family and the cricket community,” Herden said.

“It’s the best way we can show our respect at this time.”
