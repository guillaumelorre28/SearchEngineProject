Getting the perfect brow

True story: when I was 15, I couldn’t find an eyebrow pencil in my local Boots 
for black hair. Their light brown was invisible on my skin, so I did what any 
wily teenager would do, and used black eyeliner pencil instead. Later that 
evening, bathed in sweat at our local rock club, I realised that I had made a 
mistake. My brows had become smudges down my face, in comical Alice-Cooper 
smears of black.
By this point, I was too tanked on Tesco Value vodka to care (the joys of 
youth), but lesson learned: if you want your brows to stay put (and I’m 
assuming you do) you’ve got to get the right product. But it’s more than that 
though – they’ve got to look great too. Since my teenage years, I’ve tried 
almost every brow definer on the market, and for me, these are the winners.

The finest pencil …


Brows a little on the sparse side? You need an ultra-thin pencil stroke to 
mimic the appearance of natural hair and fill in any gaps, especially if you’re 
growing them back in. Enter the best brow pencil ever, and it comes in black – 
hurrah! Seriously, you wont use another one ever again.

The big easy …

Frankly, if anything can make my brows look good with a minimal amount of 
effort, then I’m in. This nifty little wand adds a dark brown hit of colour and 
also adds volume to your brows so they look a thicker. It’s the best and 
easiest to use gel-brow product I’ve used, byFAR.

The game-changer …

There was a brow moment that changed my life. It was when makeup artist David 
Horne <http://www.houseofglamdolls.com> showed me that using a smidge of 
concealer underneath and above my brows gives a cleaner finish – I’ve done it 
ever since. This concealer is one of the best I’ve used and the slim wand means 
you can apply it straight to the brow area without messing about with brushes.

The all-night brow powder

What can’t Color Wow do? Primarily it’s a hair powder used to mask roots, 
cover grey or disguise areas of thinning hair. But, it also makes the best brow 
shadow. While regular eyeshadows can disintergrate or smear during the day, 
especially if you have oily skin, Color Wow’s powder adheres to the hair, not 
the skin so has real staying power. It’s also waterproof, so even if you get 
your sweat on, your brows won’t abandon you. If only I’d had this 15 years ago.
