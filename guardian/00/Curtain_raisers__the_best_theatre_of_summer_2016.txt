On Corporation Street

Twenty years ago, the provisional IRA launched a devastating attack on 
Manchester in the largest bombing ever seen in mainland Britain. The event is 
recalled in a piece that is largely the work of the acclaimedexperimental Irish 
company ANU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/09/irish-theatre-women-abbey-programme>
. Using personal memories and mixing live action, visual art and film footage, 
it promises to be both painful and provocative.

<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/24/john-osborne-a-natural-dissenter-who-changed-the-face-of-british-theatre>
’s titular hero. It is far and way Osborne’s best play, in that it uses a 
broken-down music-hall comedian as the symbol of a Britain in crisis after the 
disastrous Suez invasion of 1956. In fact, the play might well have been titled 
Lost Empires.

The Toad Knew 

James Thiérrée <http://www.compagnieduhanneton.com/EN/> is a theatrical 
magician, born into the world of circus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/24/james-thierree-chaplin-tabac-rouge-clown-sadlers-wells>
, but creating large-scale shows that cross art-forms. Dancers, contortionists, 
and high-wire walkers are called into service for Thiérrée’s latest piece, 
following five people bound together by blood and emotional ties. Expect it to 
be flamboyant, hallucinatory and ravishingly beautiful.

Place des Anges


First seen in the UK in Piccadilly Circus in 2012, this French spectacle, 
which takes place at dusk, is the closing event in the Yorkshire festival. 
Angels are suddenly spotted high up on buildings and, as they glide towards the 
audience, the sky fills with a blizzard of feathers. It’s a terrific 
experience, playful and wondrous, and the miracle is that something so simple 
completely transforms the crowd’s relationship with each other and a familiar 
location.
•2 July, Queens Gardens, Hull <http://www.yorkshirefestival.co.uk/>. Book here 
<http://www.hull2017.co.uk/whatson/events/placedesanges/>. Yorkshire festival
