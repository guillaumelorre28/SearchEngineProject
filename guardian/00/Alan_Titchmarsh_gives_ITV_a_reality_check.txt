Alan Titchmarsh will not be appearing on a TV reality show any time soon, 
reports the Sun. The former Gardeners' World presenter turned chatshow giant 
reckons a lot of reality TV is "puerile", reports the Sun. He likes BBC1's 
Strictly Come Dancing, but less keen on ITV1's I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out 
of Here!, which is only slightly unfortunate seeing as the chatshow he presents 
is on ... ITV. "To put people in the jungle â€“ I mean, I know it's popular and 
people want to watch it, fair enough. But from my point of view it's rather 
dreary. There's a much more exciting life going on out there." Exactly, Alan. 
Like watching Dancing on Ice.
