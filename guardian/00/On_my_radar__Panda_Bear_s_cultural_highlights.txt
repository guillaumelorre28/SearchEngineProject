Noah Lennox is a founding member of experimental band Animal Collective 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/animalcollective>, and has released music 
solo under the name Panda Bear since 1999 (the name comes from the panda 
drawings he used to decorate his early recordings). Lennox grew up in 
Baltimore, Maryland, and briefly studied religion at Boston University before 
moving to New York in 2000. He now lives in Lisbon, Portugal, with his wife and 
two children. Panda Bear plays Electric Brixton, London, on 4 March, and his 
single Boys Latin is out on 23 March on Domino Records.

Article: The AI Revolution by Tim Urban 
<http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html>

I haven’t stopped thinking about this since reading it. This outlines the 
looming dangers and possible miracles an artificial super-intelligence might 
create. According to the article the existence of a technological intelligence 
capable of functions we can’t even conceive of is a question of “when” and not 
“if”. The difference between human extinction and immortality could be decided 
by our care in designing this intelligence.

Shop: Gelateria Nannarella <https://pt-pt.facebook.com/GelateriaNannarella>

This is the best ice-cream I’ve had. Nannarella is a tiny shop down the road 
from my place selling fresh hand-made ice-cream (I gather they’ll be moving to 
a bigger spot a couple doors down soon). They keep it pretty simple with 
flavours and hover around the basics, but that’s OK – I don’t like to mess 
around with ice-cream (or pizza). You can get fresh natas (cream) on top if 
you’re really serious about it.

Podcast: The Dan LeBatard Show with Stugotz 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/dan-lebatard-show-stugotz/id301023639?mt=2>

My friend Andrew recently turned me on to this one. I should say I listen to a 
lot of sports talk. Dan and Stugotz and the rest of the gang have been really 
good working buddies lately. They don’t always talk sports but the conversation 
is always interesting or funny or informative in some way. I appreciate the 
candour and the willingness to be openly wrong. They’ll often discuss racial 
issues in ways I find refreshing and important.

Album: Andy Stott – Faith in Strangers 
<https://soundcloud.com/modernlove/sets/andy-stott-faith-in-strangers>

This came out last year and was one of my favourites. The music doesn’t seem 
in any hurry to get where it’s going, and I love that about it. There’s a 
graceful balance between aggression and tenderness wrestled within a lot of the 
songs. The image on the cover suggests to me that this balance is also a 
reflection of a discourse – between the pull of primal instinct and the sheen 
of modern times.

Film: Whiplash <https://www.theguardian.com/film/whiplash>

I saw this with my lady the other day. I can’t remember a movie whose effect 
was generated so intensely by its edit: in a way the edit serves as narrator. I 
can relate strongly to the story (I’ve never punched my hand through a snare 
drum but I’ve shed blood on drum skins more than a couple of times) and I 
enjoyed thinking about how our longing to prove our worth to others (and 
perhaps to ourselves) can often transform into a kind of madness.

Gadget: Oculus Rift <https://www.oculus.com/rift/>

There’s a bunch of players in the virtual reality goggle game, but these guys 
seem like the best at the moment. Virtual reality has had a couple of waves, 
but it feels like technology has advanced to the point of making it truly 
possible (and relatively affordable). Once I saw YouTube demos of people nearly 
falling over I was sold. I wonder about the potential positives of a device 
like this: facing fears in a controlled setting, experiencing events remotely, 
meditation and emotional escape.
