There had been British hip-hop hits before – Pump Up the Volume by Marrs; 
Cookie Crew and Beatmasters – but in Derek Boland, the country found its first 
hit rap artist. Two singles – Good Groove and Bad Young Brother – made the top 
20, and his debut album, Bullet From a Gun, just missed the top 10. He was the 
one of the first rappers to appear on Top of the Pops and his UK success 
secured him the services of Russell Simmons as manager. He wasn't always 
credible, however, receiving criticism for rapping in an American accent, while 
he co-wrote and produced Liverpool's 1988 FA Cup final record. Boland died, 
aged 44, in 2009.
