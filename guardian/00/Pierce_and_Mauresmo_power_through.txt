Mary Pierce and Amelie Mauresmo posted contrasting opening-round victories on 
day two in Melbourne.

Fifth seed Pierce dispatched Australian Nicole Pratt 6-1, 6-1 in just 52 
minutes. The 1995 champion said: "It's a good feeling, it's a good start.

"It's always good to just kind of get going, get used to the environment, get 
used to competing again. I was very, very happy with my play today. I was able 
to be focused. I felt like I moved well and I played well."

Her French compatriot Mauresmo, however, survived a first-round scare against 
Tiantian Sun of China before pushing through for a 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory. The 
third seed, who now meets compatriot Emile Loit, believes she will benefit from 
the tough match.

"It's not always easy to play the first match," she said. "I guess the first 
set was not so easy for me because, obviously, I made way too many unforced 
errors and really took one set to adjust to the conditions and to the game.

"That's how it starts, and then hopefully it will get better and better as the 
tournament is going to go"

Second seed Kim Clijsters was in sound form during her demolition of Korean 
Yoon Jeong Cho. The Belgian overcame an early service break to win comfortably 
6-3, 6-0.

Anastasia Myskina of Russia also survived an early battle with Ukrainian 
Yuliana Fedak to triumph 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.
