Broadband and telecoms supplier TalkTalk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/talk-talk-telecom> is the latest company 
to find pay under scrutiny.

Ahead of Wednesday's annual meeting, the investor advisory group Pirc has 
recommended that shareholders vote against its remuneration report and pay 
policy.

Pirc says rewards for executive directors look excessive, with the chief 
executive, Dido Harding receiving bonuses and incentives worth 1,255% of base 
salary. Pirc also says that performance targets for various incentive schemes 
are inadequately explained.

TalkTalkwill also issue a trading update, with analysts expecting around 
180,000 TV customers to be added in the first quarter, similar to the previous 
one.

However, Berenberg analysts questioned the company's target of 4% revenue 
growth, as it will see less benefit from price hikes, partly because of 
promotional spending.

The analysts said: "TalkTalk is a challenged player operating in a very good 
market."

The company also suffered a setback when Ofcom rejected TalkTalk's complaint 
that BT was abusing its dominant position when setting broadband prices for 
rivals.
