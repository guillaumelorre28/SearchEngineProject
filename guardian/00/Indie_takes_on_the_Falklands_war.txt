The brainchild of Cherry Red's Iain McNay, a chart dedicated to independent 
labels debuted in 1980. In its early years, barely a week went by without an 
appearance by anarcho-punks Crass. Recorded during the Falklands war in May, 
flexidiscs of How Does it Feel to Be the Mother of 1,000 Dead? were smuggled, 
guerrilla-style, into random albums by distributors Rough Trade. It sailed out 
under its own steam in November, replacing Robert Wyatt's Falklands-themed 
Shipbuilding at the top of the independent chart.

Two more different responses to the war could scarcely be imagined. Crass's 
Steve Ignorant blasted Margaret Thatcher with scabrous accusations while Wyatt 
poignantly voiced the thoughts of a shipbuilder whose industry has been 
revitalised by the same bloodshed that might claim his son's life. Together, 
these two singles represented the indie chart's power to showcase dissent that 
would otherwise remain in theÂ commercial shadows. But indie was as much an 
industry definition as a genre and, by way of dramatic contrast, 1982's final 
chart-topper was Save Your Love by cornball Midlands duo Renee and Renato.
