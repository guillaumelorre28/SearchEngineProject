We will indeed have a piece from Margaret Atwood - as well as appreciations 
from AS Byatt, Anne Enright and Colm Toibin, all to be collected on ourAlice 
Munro <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-munro> page. In the meantime, 
thank you for reading, and again in Atwood's words, 'Hooray!'

Is Alice Munro <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-munro> the first

The Nobel Prize website has posted a "bio-bibliography" 
<http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2013/bio-bibl.html>
 for Alice Munro, with a useful list of her publications in English and other 
languages, as well as critical studies. (Plus the interesting nugget that her 
father was a fox farmer.)

2.45pm BST 

We must include Margaret Atwood's wonderful appreciation of Munro from 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/11/alice-munro>. "She's the kind of 
writer about whom it is often said - no matter how well known she becomes - 
that she ought to be better known," Atwood begins, shedding light both on 
Munro's origins and her elevation to "international literary sainthood".

When Munro was growing up in the 1930s and 40s, the idea of a person from 
Canada - but especially one from small-town south-western Ontario - thinking 
she could be a writer to be taken seriously in the world at large was 
laughable. Even by the 50s and 60s there were very few publishers in Canada.

And from 2006, a great review of The View from Castle Rock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview18>
 by someone else whose star has risen over the last decade... Hilary Mantel.

How we saw her: archive pieces from the Guardian and Observer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/from-the-archive-blog/2013/oct/10/alice-munro-nobel-prize-archive>
 on Munro, including a 1987 review by Claire Tomalin ("She is never going to 
write a blockbuster, thank goodness. Read not more than one of her stories a 
day, and allow them to work their spell slowly: they are made to last"). A 
reminder of pre-digitised journalism and a long, slow-burning career.

 about Alice Munro.

1.50pm BST 

Fun fact: Munro is actually the second Canadian-born writer to win. 1976 
winner Saul Bellow was born in Canada, but moved to the US when he was nine.

1.38pm BST 

With fortunate timing, the paperback of Alice Munro's most recent collection 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099578635>
, Dear Life, was released just days ago.

There will be no more books after this one, Munro has said. "Put your money on 
it." In an evocative series ofwords and images of her hom 
<http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/07/01/books/20130702MUNRO.html?_r=0>e 
for the New York Times, she cites the example of Philip Roth's retirement ("He 
seems so happy now"). "It just seems natural now for me to do what other 
81-year-olds do," she concludes. "If you’ll only tell me what that is."

Could the Nobel encourage her to reconsider? 
 Alice Munro's Dear Life 
1.21pm BST 

In her interview with Canadian radio 
<https://soundcloud.com/cbc-radio-one/alice-munro-on-world-report>, Munro, who 
doesn't often speak to the media, said she didn't "know that I was even on a 
list until yesterday," but hoped that "there will now be more thought about 
Canadian writers as a whole. This will help boost our idea of Canadian writing 
in the world."

She was shocked to be told that she was only the 13th woman to win, 
responding: "I'm very glad that I got on and we as women got on."

"I had totally forgotten about it," the interview concluded. "My daughter woke 
me up. I was dazed: what had I won? Then I came to my senses."

1.13pm BST 

There's much rejoicing in the literary community, but should you want an 
opposing view, look up Christian Lorentzen'stake-down in the LRB 
<http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n11/christian-lorentzen/poor-rose> from earlier this 
year:

Reading ten of her collections in a row has induced in me not a glow of 
admiration but a state of mental torpor that spread into the rest of my life. I 
became sad, like her characters, and like them I got sadder. I grew attuned to 
the ways life is shabby or grubby, words that come up all the time in her 
stories, as well as to people’s residential and familial histories, details she 
never leaves out. How many rooms are in the house, and what sort of furniture 
and who used to own it and what is everybody wearing? To ask these questions is 
to live your life like a work of realism.

1.06pm BST 

Here's a soundcloud interview 
<https://soundcloud.com/cbc-radio-one/alice-munro-on-world-report> with Alice 
Munro on Canadian radio, conducted seconds after she found out about her Nobel 
win.

1.05pm BST 

Munro's most recent collection is 2012's Dear Life, reviewed in the Guardian 
by Anne Enright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/08/dear-life-alice-munro-review>. 
It includes some autobiographical pieces which Munro said she believed "are the 
first and last – and the closest – things I have to say about my own life".

12.50pm BST 

Margaret Atwood has reacted to the news on Twitter with a simple 'Hooray!'
Margaret E. Atwood (@MargaretAtwood) 
Hooray! Alice Munro wins 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature http://t.co/jKISiWzh8i

Where to start if you don't know Munro's work? Tessa Hadley recently set out 
her 10 favourite short stories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/11/tessa-hadley-top-10-short-stories>
 ever written for us, and included Munro's 'The Love of a Good Woman' on the 
list.

Munro changed our sense of what the short story can do as radically as Chekhov 
and Mansfield did at the beginning of the 20th century. She uses the form so 
capaciously – a whole community in 1950s rural Canada is captured in the loose 
weave of this one – around a woman who believes she's uncovered the secret of a 
violent death. She makes plans to do the right thing, bring the secret into the 
light of day. There's never a false or fussy note, as Munro penetrates in words 
into the hidden roots of how we choose to live, and why we act.

You can see the story on the New Yorker archive 
<http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1996/12/23/1996_12_23_102_TNY_CARDS_000377701>
.

The reaction from booksellers was, unsurprisingly, joyful - Le Clézio or Mo 
Yan may not have given them much of a sales boost, but Munro certainly will. 
Waterstones spokesman Jon Howells said: "The Academy isn't really influenced by 
commercial considerations, so they often pick writers who – while obviously 
very accomplished – aren't familiar to readers in the UK. It's great to have a 
writer who's not only brilliant but also well-known here."

12.37pm BST 

Munro found out, apparently, with a phone call from her daughter - "Mom, you 
won." And on being only the 13th woman to win the prize, said "Can this be 
possible. It seems dreadful there's only 13 of us."

Since then she's been showered in awards, including the International Booker 
in 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/27/alice-munro-man-booker-international-prize>
, which called her work "practically perfect". High-profile fans include 
Jonathan Franzen and Margaret Atwood. Nell Freudenbergerchose her as a hero 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/29/my-hero-alice-munro-nell-freudenberger>
 for Guardian Review's regular weekly slot, highlighting her lack of ego. "I 
don't think she would care to be called my hero, or anyone's. And yet she is 
the writer whose female characters I feel most kinship with."

12.27pm BST 

Munro's career as a writer began six decades ago and her writing habits, 
mentioned in the recent book Daily Rituals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/05/daily-rituals-creative-minds-mason-currey>
, are an object lesson for all aspiring authors. "In the 1950s, as a young 
mother taking care of two small children, Munro wrote in the slivers of time 
between housekeeping and child-rearing. When neighbours dropped in, Munro 
didn't feel comfortable telling them she was trying to work. She tried renting 
an office, but the garrulous landlord interrupted her and she hardly got any 
writing done. It ultimately took her almost two decades to put together the 
material for her first collection, Dance Of The Happy Shades."

"Small people, big feelings" said Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the 
Swedish Academy when chatting to the press.

One of the many great things about this prize is the way, directly & 
indirectly, it introduces writers from around the world to a wider readership. 
Whether she wins or not I am now off to google Svetlana Alexievich, a writer I 
had not heard of, and buy one of her books to read.

About half an hour ago, someone hopefully edited Haruki Murakami's Wikipedia 
page to award him the Nobel peace prize. There was a more effective hoax back 
in 2006, when, with minutes to go before the announcement, a fake "Nobel" web 
page gave the award to Serbian author Dobrica Cosic.

11.44am BST 

On a lighter note, The Onion is poking fun at every writer's perennial secret 
fantasy of getting That Call from the Academy. If you like sweary jokes about 
modern poetry,you'll enjoy this one 
<http://www.theonion.com/articles/fucking-pathetic-john-ashbery-actually-thinks-he-h,34162/?ref=auto>
: "American poet John Ashbery is seriously harboring the belief that he has any 
chance in hell at winning this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature, sources close 
to the clearly delusional author confirmed Wednesday." Perhaps he's the one 
laughing now...

Issues of free speech and political freedom are always bound up with the 
prize. Last year's winnerMo Yan <https://www.theguardian.com/books/mo-yan>, the 
first ever Chinese literature laureate, was condemned by many for being too 
close to the Chinese government.Salman Rushdie called him a "patsy" 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/11/mo-yan-nobel-prize-censorship> 
and previous literature laureate Herta Müller described the award as a disgrace.

In his acceptance speech Mo Yan addressed the Swedish academy: "I am confident 
that you will not let yourselves be affected by anything other than 
literature." In theGuardian's review of his latest novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/18/pow-mo-yan-review> to be 
published in the west, however, author and critic Yiyun Li saw politics and 
literature as inextricably entwined. Pow! is a hallucinatory vision of rural 
Chinese life, a mishmash of monks, ghosts, orgies and butchery: "Perhaps this 
is a way to stay away from politics: to be a fabulist, but not to be taken so 
seriously," the review concluded.

According to the Belarus Digest 
<http://belarusdigest.com/story/prisoners-authoritarianism-alexievich-and-her-critics-15749>
, the news that Svetlana Alexievich is surging ahead has the Belarusian 
blogosphere "bristling with indignation". Critical compatriots condemn her for 
writing in Russian and focusing on Soviet rather than Belarusian history - a 
lack of patriotism resulting from "two decades of authoritarianism and 
suppression of Belarusian culture in independent Belarus".

11.18am BST 

The Nobel committee try to give the winner half an hour's notice, so he or she 
should be finding out any minute. But it's not always easy to find them - Peter 
Higgs, joint winner of this year's physics Nobel,proved "as elusive as the 
Higgs boson itself" 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/08/nobel-laureate-peter-higgs-boson-elusive>
 when he took himself off on holiday without a mobile phone to avoid the media 
scrum.

Doris Lessing, winner in 2007, only found out as she was getting out of a taxi 
in north London. She responded to the good news with the immortal words, "Oh 
Christ."

How much credence should one give to the bookies' odds? Ladbrokes have a 
pretty impressive strike rate over the last few years, getting it right in 2011 
(Tomas Tranströmer

), 2009 (Herta Müller

2006 (Orhan Pamuk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/12/nobelprize.awardsandprizes>).

5.01pm BST 

With an hour to go to the announcement of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature, 
commentators around the world are waiting with some trepidation. Will it be 
awarded to a familiar figure or someone unknown to them? News that the 2008 
prizehad gone to the veteran French novelist Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/09/nobelprize.awardsandprizes> 
caused an undignified scramble in the UK to find someone – anyone – who had 
read him recently enough to have anything sensible to say.

Until today, the front-runner in the UK betting stakes has been the Japanese 
novelist Haruki Murakami, a regular fixture at the top of the odds. He was 
dramaticallypushed out of the top slot 
<http://www.oddschecker.com/novelty/nobel-prize-in-literature/winner> this 
morning by Svetlana Alexievich, a Belarusian chronicler of Soviet and 
post-Soviet history best known for her oral history of the Chernobyl disaster, 
Voices from Chernobyl. It was published in the UK in 2005 - you canread an 
extract <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/apr/25/energy.ukraine> 
here.

Yesterday Murakami had seemed unassailable at 5-2 with Ladbrokes, though the 
Norwegian playwright and author Jon Fosse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/01/nobel-literature-bets-jon-fosse-odds-slashed>
 put on a sudden spurt last week due to some patriotic punting and the Canadian 
short story writerAlice Munro was also leaping forward 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/nobel-prize-literature-alice-munro-second-favourite>
.

On Swedish Twitter, meanwhile, a familiar name emerged ... as well as a less 
expected, but no less welcome one.
