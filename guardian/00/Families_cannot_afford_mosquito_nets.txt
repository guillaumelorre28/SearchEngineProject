Ballaraba Saidu sits on the mud floor of her dimly lit house in Ungwa Uku, 
Kano state, with her six-month-old daughter, Ummasalama, squirming irritably in 
her lap and her eldest daughter, two-year-old Sadeya, tottering precariously at 
her side. Both Sadeya and Ummasalama's foreheads are beaded with sweat. Saidu 
explains: "The youngest has had a fever for two days, the oldest for one day. 
They are waking in the night sweating and shaking. I think it is malaria."

Saidu and her family do not sleep under an LLIN. In a quiet voice, she 
explains that she was visiting family in another village when the mass 
distribution of free LLINs came to her area and by the time she returned they 
had run out. LLINs are being sold at her local market but at 1,200 naira each 
(around £5) she cannot afford to buy one. She may be entitled to a free net 
when she takes her children for immunisations but she has not yet taken the 
time to visit the clinic.

Outside the house, water is standing in pools that are peppered with the 
twitching forms of mosquito larvae. Without an LLIN and with mosquitoes 
breeding just outside the door-less entrance to the house, Saidu's young 
daughters are likely to have many more episodes of malaria – with high chances 
at their young ages that one might be fatal. As Ummasalama lets out a raspy 
cry, Saidu feels her daughter's forehead one more time, frowns and promises: 
"I will take them both to the clinic today."CJ
