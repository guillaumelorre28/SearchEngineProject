The winner: San Andreas

When Hercules <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hercules> debuted last year 
with a mild £1.45m, it was easy to question the box-office prowess of its star, 
Dwayne Johnson. Had the Rock got it what it takes to open a movie in the UK to 
blockbuster numbers? Now, withSan Andreas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/28/san-andreas-review-dwayne-johnson>
, the answer appears to be yes: it debuted with a muscular £3.89m, plus 
£740,000 in previews. That’s the best start for a Johnson movie outside theFast 
& Furious <https://www.theguardian.com/film/fast-furious-7> franchise, unless 
you count The Mummy Returns, where the actor had scant screen time.

The good news for Johnson is that the success is not reliant on the actor 
boarding an existing franchise – unlike notable past hits such as Mummy spinoff
The Scorpion King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/19/culture.peterbradshaw1>, Journey 
2: The Mysterious Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/02/journey-2-the-mysterious-island-review>
,GI Joe: Retaliation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/28/gi-joe-retaliation-review> and 
the Fast & Furious titles. On the other hand, the $110m-budget San Andreas is 
hardly reliant on Johnson for its primary appeal: the epic disaster sequences 
include an earthquake that lays waste to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The success of San Andreas <https://www.theguardian.com/film/san-andreas> 
seems to confirm that the combination of Johnson with appropriate material – 
providing blockbuster spectacle commensurate with his own outsize frame – is a 
commercial winner with audiences. Expect more of the same.

The runner-up: Pitch Perfect 2

Pitch Perfect 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road> were neck-and-neck the 
previous weekend, with the two films grossing near identical amounts, and 
almost tied for cumulative box-office. But the half-term school holiday was 
kind to the Barden Bellas, as they pull convincingly ahead of the 
post-apocalyptic road warriors.

Pitch Perfect 2 posted a robust £1.87m for the weekend session (compared with 
£1.75m for Fury Road), but more impressive is its performance across the week. 
The past seven days saw its cumulative total rise by a spiffy £4.76m, bringing 
the 17-day tally to £14.53m. That’s more than double the gross of the original 
Pitch Perfect (£6.49m). With the rest of the top five (San Andreas, Mad Max: 
Fury Road, Tomorrowland: A World Beyond and Avengers: Age of Ultron) all driven 
by big-budget action,Pitch Perfect 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/pitch-perfect-2> is offering the date-movie 
market a clear alternative.

The plucky contender: Man Up

Is there a viable audience for a British romcom? Given uncertain international 
appeal, films need to stay within modest budget limits and perform strongly on 
home turf, making the genre a challenge for UK producers, financiers and 
distributors. In 2013,I Give It a Year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/feb/07/i-give-it-a-year-review>, 
starring Rafe Spall and Anna Faris, posted a decent £6.22m. A year later,Cuban 
Fury <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/cuban-fury-review>, with 
Nick Frost and Rashida Jones, crossed the finish line with a less impressive 
£2.46m. Now it’s the turn of Man Up, starring Lake Bell and Simon Pegg. The 
film has opened with £529,000 from 357 cinemas, yielding a site average of 
£1,481. That compares with Cuban Fury’s debut of £966,000 from 361 cinemas, and 
I Give It a Year’s £1.45m from 396 venues.

In the past, Pegg enjoyed major box-office success in romantic comedic roles, 
poweringRun Fatboy Run <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/07/comedy> to 
£11.02m and romzomcomShaun of the Dead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/apr/09/simonpegg> to £6.69m. While his 
international star power has increased with the Star Trek and Mission: 
Impossible franchises, Pegg’s enduring appeal as a romantic leading man isn’t 
so certain.

Spending its 11th week in the top 10, DreamWorks Animation’s Home is the star 
performer of the week, rising 121% from the previous session. That takes its 
cumulative total past £24m, which compares with £20.4m for Disney’sBig Hero 6 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/29/big-hero-6-review>. With the 
half-term holiday ending on Sunday,Cinderella

 andThe Sponge Bob Movie: Sponge Out of Water 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/26/spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water-review>
 likewise posted impressive rises. Big Hero 6 and Aardman’sShaun the Sheep the 
Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/05/shaun-the-sheep-the-movie-review-aardman-animation>
 also made the top 20, in what is surely a last hurrah for these titles, now 
that they have hit DVD shelves. All these family films are benefiting from the 
fact that Disney’s Tomorrowland: A World Beyond was graded 12A by Britain’s 
censor, and also by the rather modest commercial appeal of more recently 
released animation Moomins on the Riviera.

The arthouse market

Posting the biggest debut for a non-Bollywood foreign language film since 
Force Majeure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/force-majeure-review-ruben-ostlund-avalanche-movie>
 in early May, The Connection scores £84,000 from 54 cinemas including £1,800 
in previews. Covering some of the same terrain explored by William Friedkin’s 
The French Connection, except from the perspective of a Marseilles police 
magistrate (Jean Dujardin), the film was positioned for fans of arthouse 
thrillers.

Earning a higher screen average thanks to a tighter rollout in 32 venues, 
Timbuktu picked up £66,000, plus £8,700 in previews, a record opening for

The flop: Search Party

Halfway down the list of other releases, see below, is road-trip comedy Search 
Party. With a dismal £17,900 from 102 cinemas, and a site average of £175, the 
film evidently was not a priority release for local distributor Universal, 
which will presumably recoup its investment through pay-TV deals and the like. 
Search Party began its international rollout in the Netherlands last October, 
but has yet to arrive in US cinemas.

equivalent frame from 2014, which was led byMaleficent

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/16/spy-review-paul-feig-melissa-mccarthy-jude-law>
 from Bridesmaids director Paul Feig. Insidious: Chapter 3 should prove an 
effective franchise extension. Also in the mix: James McTeigue thriller 
Survivor. Arthouse audiences can choose between Jason Schwartzman in US indie 
Listen Up Philip, Brit flick Second Coming and Chinese crime drama Black Coal, 
Thin Ice, among other titles.
