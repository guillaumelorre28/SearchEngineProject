Iday Simbajon crosses herself as she passes the local church, a crumbling 
shed-like structure with a weathered cross. She walks through a warren of 
crooked shacks to her home. On the door there is a government notice stating 
that this is an informal settlement. Cheerful graduation photos of some of her 
eight children and a basketball trophy assume pride of place.

When typhoon Ondoy swept through the Philippines in 2009, her 10-member family 
was stranded on the cramped upper floor. "We had to swim or paddle on rubber 
boats to get out," she says.

For the past seven years, Simbajon has worked as a community health worker in 
a women's health clinic run by a local organisation. The clinic provides free 
access to basic family planning and reproductive health services for poor women 
like her. "I shouldn't have had eight children," says Simbajon. "I should have 
taken care of myself better."

Her work enables her to support her family and help other women avoid making 
the same mistakes she did. Yet misconceptions around family planning abound and 
Simbajon knows how harmful entrenched religious beliefs can be.

In the chapel the priest has been speaking out against the reproductive health 
bill, saying it will promote promiscuity. Simbajon protested, but was silenced 
by her husband.

"It's the priests that are the problem," she says. "It's not Catholicism. 
We're all Catholics in the clinic."
