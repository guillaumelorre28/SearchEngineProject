Sydney, Melbourne <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> and 
Canberra housing markets are still booming, new housing figures show.

Capital city housing price averages across Australia rose 0.5% in October, to 
be up by 7.5% from a year earlier.

The figures from property market analysis firm CoreLogic on Tuesday also show 
that the gains have come despite rental yields – rents as a proportion of 
property value – being at record lows in major markets.

The CoreLogic Hedonic home value index adjusts for the effects of changes in 
the type of homes being bought and sold, including shifts in home size, 
features, land area and location.

“High values, low yields and a mature growth cycle haven’t been enough to 
deter investors from the market,” CoreLogic’s research director, Tim Lawless, 
said.

The gross yield on capital city homes dropped to 3.1% in October, from 3.2% in 
September, for houses, and to 4% from 4.1% for units.

Three years ago, yields were 4% for houses and 4.7% for units.

“The typical Sydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> and 
Melbourne house is now providing a gross rental return of just 2.8%,” CoreLogic 
said in its report. “Taking into consideration holdings costs, expenses and 
vacancy, the net rental yield for houses is likely to be closer to 2% in these 
markets.”

The latest figures show Sydney is the most expensive city for median home 
prices in October and its property values also had the biggest jump in the 
nation.
