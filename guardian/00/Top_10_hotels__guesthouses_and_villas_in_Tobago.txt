Kariwak Village Holistic Haven, Crown Point 

Kariwak is a tranquil foodie's paradise, down a quiet lane but less than a 
mile from the airport. Canadian-born owner Cynthia Clovis has been cooking here 
for the past 31 years and recently published a book of her most popular dishes, 
such as sautéed shrimps with green-fig salad. The "village", designed by her 
husband, Allan, is laid out to instil calm: 18 cabanas surround the ozonated, 
chlorine-free pool; six larger rooms are reached by a path winding through herb 
gardens and past fishponds. There are yoga and t'ai chi classes every morning 
and evening, while massage, shiatsu and aromatherapy complete the holistic 
experience. If you're not already unwound, lounge music and creamy piña coladas 
will have you moving from bar to bed in a state of total Zen.

Cuffie River Nature Retreat, near Mason Hall

Situated on the eastern fringe of the Main Ridge Forest Reserve, this 
eco-lodge is surrounded by rainforest. Built in colonial-villa style, it has 10 
bedrooms and is as cosy as guesthouses come – but with nature right on your 
doorstep. Wildlife even comes inside, with birds such as the blue-grey tanager 
flying in and out through the open windows. Each room has a balcony from which 
to gaze into the forest and listen to jungle sounds by night, and the dawn 
chorus at sunrise. Hummingbirds almost the size of swallows hover around the 
garden, flitting from sugar-water feeders to nectar-rich flowers (bright-pink 
bleeding hearts, orangey-red trumpet creepers). Owner Regina Dumas arranges 
hikes for guests wishing to venture into the surrounding blanket of green.

Castara Retreats, Castara
 Photograph: Fred Hoogervorst 
These seven, wood-built apartments are in lush hillside gardens with exquisite 
views of Castara Bay. Set high above the beach, they are filled with delightful 
sea breezes by day and enjoy cooler nights. The Rainforest penthouse, with more 
than 150 square metres of cypress-wood decking, covered by a vaulted ceiling, 
is equipped with all mod cons, yet has a really organic feel. The smaller 
apartments are charming, too, offering hammocks strung up on terraces with 
spectacular views. Every aspect is expertly detailed: iPod docks, dimmer 
switches, and kitchens with top-of-the-range pans and utensils.

Man-O-War Bay Cottages, Charlotteville

Set in colourful landscaped gardens – with mango, breadfruit, banana, papaya 
and almond trees providing much needed shade, as well as fruit – are 10 basic, 
self-catering chalets. Some of them were built in the 1950s, when writers and 
painters came seeking a quiet haven, and can accommodate single travellers to 
groups of eight. The cottages are perfect for beach lovers: a fence with a gate 
is all that separates you from Hermitage Bay, part of the larger Man-O-War Bay 
that spans the picturesque fishing village of Charlotteville. Spend lazy days 
lolling in the garden or on the sand. At night, you'll be lulled to sleep by 
the sound of waves breaking on the shore.

Blue Waters Inn, Batteaux Bay
 Photograph: Fred Hoogervorst 
This family-oriented guesthouse is close to the Atlantic coast fishing village 
of Speyside – you'll pass the village's historic, rusting iron waterwheel 
before arriving here. Blue Waters Inn is by the calm, blue sea of Batteaux Bay, 
which is fringed with golden sands. All of the 38 rooms face the sea and 
overlook the beach. It's a warm, ocean paradise, where you could spend all day 
simply floating in the water or sitting on a recliner by the pool, watching the 
ocean change colour from azure to turquoise as the shadows lengthen. But 
there's also a good choice of activities, with a tennis court, table tennis 
and birdwatching in the surrounding forest.

Mot Mot and Sugarmill villas, Arnos Vale

Close to the colonial town of Plymouth is an area called Arnos Vale, where 
country lanes lead to fabulous houses at the end of long driveways. Nestled in 
this peaceful area are these beautiful villas, set in undulating gardens with 
fruit trees. Mot Mot, the more imposing of the two, sits atop a hill with views 
out to sea. Designed like a plantation house, it has wooden floors, four-poster 
beds and a gorgeous upper-floor balcony overlooking the pool. The other house 
is built to look like an 18th-century sugar mill. With a spiral wooden 
staircase and top-floor observatory deck with spectacular views, it feels like 
you are staying in a lighthouse. Friendly members of staff are on hand to look 
after you and cook if required.

Miller's Guesthouse, Buccoo
 Photograph: Fred Hoogervorst 
Located in the sleepy fishing village of Buccoo, this is the best budget 
accommodation on the island. It is run by Winston Pereira, a half-Arawak, 
half-Lebanese Tobagonian, who loves to hold court on any topic you care to 
mention: theology and world politics are his current favourites – get him 
started and you may be there some time. There are six simple, air-conditioned 
en suite rooms, one self-contained apartment and one dormitory with bunk 
beds and a kitchen. The guesthouse has a great view over Buccoo reef, with its 
jetty, fishing boats and pelicans plunging crazily into the sea and reappearing 
seconds later with bills full of fish.

Villa Soleil, Arnos Vale

This stunning, enormous villa is built into the cliffs on the leeward coast of 
Tobago. Waves break against the rocks just underneath the two-tier pool, which 
feels like an extension of the ocean. An open-roofed central courtyard gives it 
the look of a Moroccan riad and the dining area, with sea views, has a 
12-seater mahogany table. The five bedrooms are fabulously well-furnished and 
the master bedroom has one of the biggest four-poster beds you could hope to 
see. The opulence comes with excellent service – you get a housekeeper and a 
driver who will pick you up from the airport.

Bacolet Beach Club, Scarborough
 Photograph: Fred Hoogervorst 
On Bacolet Street, leading out of the little capital, Scarborough, the houses 
take on a white-picket-fence look. Three significant hotels are situated here: 
The Blue Haven, a relic of the 1950s; Half Moon Blue, built in 1850 and 
renovated in 1996; and Bacolet Beach Club, built in 2006 by former Tobagonian 
model Gloria Jones-Knapp, the owner of Half Moon Blue. It's a beachside 
boutique hotel exuding pristine-white style. The majestic entrance dazzles you 
from the road, with a view right through the lobby: from there, a staircase 
descends to a secluded private beach. An infinity pool overlooks the sea and 
the 20 sleek rooms have sliding doors leading on to verandas with views over 
the crashing waves.

Being villa, Arnos Vale

Being villa is knowingly pretentious, a little bit cheeky and a lot of fun. 
This striking complex of self-consciously postmodern architecture is set in an 
organic orchard, perched on cliffs. The main house is a surrealist blend of 
Spanish hacienda and church hall, with ornate spires and a roof so curving it 
seems to be melting. The smaller outhouses are minimalist. Random archways and 
standalone structures in the garden feel like monuments – to the sun gods, 
perhaps. The buildings are designed to suit the weather precisely, so light 
pervades the living room, tiled bathrooms, wooden staircases and dining patios 
that overlook the infinity pool. Frigate birds cawing overhead and cicadas in 
the bush are the only sounds to disturb the quiet here.
