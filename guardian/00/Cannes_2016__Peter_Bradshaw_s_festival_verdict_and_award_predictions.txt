It was the year that Cannes prepared itself, spectacularly, for a terrorist 
attack by staging a full-dress armed incursion the week before. As it turned 
out, this was the only recognition of the security situation in France: there 
were no films about it.

I, Daniel Blake review: Ken Loach's welfare state polemic is blunt, dignified 
and brutally moving

Elsewhere, the politics of Cannes manifested themselves in the auteurs’ 
individual statements. Ken Loach, in hisI, Daniel Blake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/i-daniel-blake>, gave a blistering attack on 
food-bank Britain and political austerity. Andrea Arnold’s American Honey 
featured a disagreeable chancer selling dodgy magazine subscriptions 
door-to-door: he wears black trousers and braces which make him “look like 
Donald Trump”. It could be that salesmen will always bring anxiety-capitalism 
with them. Asghar Farhadi’s The Salesman is about a couple whose souring 
relationship is linked to Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman.

Meanwhile, the cast of Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Brazilian movie, Aquarius 
followed up that film’s political satire byshowing up on the red carpet 
carrying placards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/brazil-is-not-a-democracy-aquarius-premiere-cannes-red-carpet-protest>
 denouncing Brazil’s new administration as the beneficiaries of a “political 
coup”.

It was also the year that the big directors took on genre pictures. Olivier 
Assayas made a scary suspense movie in the form of Personal Shopper – and a 
great performance from Kristen Stewart helped sell it to the crowd. That 
seasoned provocateurNicolas Winding Refn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolas-winding-refn> gave us a freaky horror 
with his The Neon Demon: again, it depended on a very strong performance from a 
Hollywood star, Elle Fanning.

Romania has had another huge year on the Croisette. Two big-hitters from that 
country, Cristian Mungiu and Cristi Puiu, gave us films which anatomised the 
state of that country’s ruling class and also hinted at signs of a poisonous 
Ostalgie: a feeling that things have not advanced since the era of Ceaușescu, 
and might be worse. Oddly, the year’s German movie, Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann, 
was mostly set in Romania, and featured a performance from its seasoned 
character and bad-guy specialist, Vlad Ivanov.

Personal Shopper review: Kristen Stewart's psychic spooker is a must-have

2016 has also been the year of comedy on the Croisette, a genre traditionally 
neglected. Toni Erdmann showed that Germany can do broad comedy which travels 
outside its borders and Bruno Dumont’s Slack Bay delivered big, goofy laughs.

Here are my predictions for this year’s prizes:

Palme d’Or 
Graduation (dir: Cristian Mungiu)

Grand Prix 
Aquarius (dir: Kleber Mendonça Filho)

Jury Prize 
Personal Shopper (dir: Olivier Assayas)

Best director 
Nicolas Winding Refn for The Neon Demon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-neon-demon>
