If you read Paul Lester's New Band of the Day column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/15/asgeir>, then you will already 
know that one in ten Icelanders own Ásgeir's first album, the typist-defying 
Dýrð í dauðaþögn. Given that it costs about £352 for a pint of lager over 
there, convincing people to buy your album is especially impressive. Anyway, 
with his second effect, In The Silence, the 21 year old balladeer hopes to 
connect with listeners across the world as well.

You can see why he's optimistic. Fusing a typically ethereal Icelandic sound 
with traces of hip hop, Ásgeir's secret weapon is an ability to craft uplifting 
melodies a la Mumfords and Coldplay. Well, that and his dad - apparently, his 
72 year old father writes most of the lyrics.
