A large colourful sign outside the Bashbari village in Sreepur, Bangladesh, 
declares it "Child Marriage Free", and its Village Development Committee 
proudly states that "since March 2011, we have had no child marriages". Some 
communities in Bangladesh have turned their backs on the practice, due to 
education, peer pressure and collective prevention efforts.

The committee in Bashbari village, took part in community education programmes 
organised by Plan International. "We have been spreading the message to our 
community" says 25-year-old Rani from the committee. "Everybody discussed and 
then took an oath not to give children in marriage before 18. We, along with 
Plan, the government, local authorities and the police have worked together to 
create a good environment so this is possible."

Now local government administrators are sometimes alerted to impending early 
marriages and relay this information to organisations like Plan. This is where 
close links between the government and other organisations are crucial.

Eleven-year-old Tarun from the Bashantek slum children's group believes 
poverty is the main cause of early marriage. "I wish the government would help 
tackle the issue of poverty in our community," he says sadly. "If the 
government could find ways for us to do part-time work while we study, then we 
can help our families pay so we can continue to go to school."

Community development can help. Plan tries to help boost family income by 
encouraging locally financed projects such as sewing co-operatives, which 
enable families to pay for uniforms and textbooks, and therefore keep girls in 
school.
