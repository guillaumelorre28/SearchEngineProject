Women who have acupuncture alongside IVF treatment could harm their chances of 
becoming pregnant, researchers say. The warning follows a study that found that 
women who had acupuncture immediately before and after having an embryo 
transplanted were less likely to conceive than other women.

The finding contradicts previous studies showing acupuncture having either no 
effect on pregnancy rates or slightly increasing the chance of conceiving.

The number of women choosing to have acupuncture while undergoing IVF has 
soared in recent years, but many doctors suspect any benefits from the 
procedure could be attributed to a placebo effect.

For the new study a team of doctors at the University of Oklahoma, led by 
LaTasha Craig, randomly assigned 97 IVF patients, with an average age of 35, to 
two groups.

One group continued fertility treatment as normal while the other was also 
given acupuncture. The researchers reported a pregnancy rate of 65% after one 
cycle of IVF among 43 women who had not had acupuncture, and a 39% pregnancy 
rate for 46 women given the needles treatment. Four women in each group have 
yet to be followed up.

The team concluded that women should avoid acupuncture during IVF. But they 
also said the study results could be explained by other factors, such as the 
stress among the studied women who had had to travel to receive their 
acupuncture. Also, generally, some women will only seek acupuncture after 
traditional fertility treatment has failed.
