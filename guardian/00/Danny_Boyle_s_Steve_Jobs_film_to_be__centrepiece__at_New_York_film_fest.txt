Steve Jobs, the upcoming film about the Apple maverick – which stars Michael 
Fassbender <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> in the titular 
role and was directed by Danny Boyle – will screen as the centerpiece film for 
the 53rd New York film festival.

The Film Society of Lincoln Center, which hosts the event, doesn’t list it as 
a world premiere. Sources say it will bypass the Toronto and Venice film 
festivals that occur a month beforehand, so a Telluride film festival world 
premiere seems likely.

Boyle said in a statement: “I am honored that our film has been selected as 
the centrepiece of this year’s festival. And thrilled and terrified too, unlike 
the subject of our film, who would have taken the whole thing very much in his 
stride.”

The Trainspotting director added that Jobs was a thoroughly “contradictory” 
and “complex” character who has “forged our digital age”.

“He’s the kind of brilliant, flawed character that Shakespeare would have 
relished writing about, and storytellers of all kinds will be fashioning and 
re-fashioning the mythology of the digital revolution for generations to come,” 
he said.

Unlike the critically bashed Jobs biopic that starred Ashton Kutcher, Boyle’s 
film has a compressed timeframe, focusing on three iconic product launches and 
ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.

Joining Fassbender in the film are Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Seth Rogen 
as Steve Wozniak, Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy 
Hertzfeld, and Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan. Coincidentally, 
Waterston also starred in last year’s centerpiece film, Inherent Vice.
