The snowy weather conditions across the country have taken their toll on the 
day's football, with a number of games across the football league having to be 
postponed.

Three games in the Championship – Blackpool v West Bromwich Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom>, Scunthorpe v Ipswich and 
Cardiff v Leicester – will be rescheduled after inspections ruled that the 
pitches were unfit for play.

Wycombe Wanderers took the unusual step of asking their fans to bring shovels 
to Adams Park to help clear the snow from the approaches to the ground in order 
that theirLeague One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> 
game against Oldham might still take place.

"While the pitch is in a perfect condition for playing, it is the car park and 
roads leading to the ground which need to be gritted and cleared of snow and 
ice in order to ensure the safety of supporters attending the game," said a 
spokesman.

"Club staff have been working since dawn to clear snow and spread grit on the 
access roads to the stadium, but would appreciate help from supporters who live 
in the High Wycombe area who may be able to make their way down to the stadium 
to help with the task this morning."
