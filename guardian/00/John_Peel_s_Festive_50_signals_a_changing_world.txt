If one had to nominate a single individual who nurtured and promoted 
independent music, that person would surely beJohn Peel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnpeel>. In his late-night Radio 1 slot, 
the lugubrious DJ would play records by bands who had nothing in them other 
than a single barbaric yawp; he would provide the first stepping stone for 
groups who would later achieve greatness; he would offer acts of almost any 
stripe the chance to showcase their talents in the four-song recordings from 
the BBC studios in Maida Vale known as Peel Sessions (many of them more 
memorable than the "official" recordings of the same songs). Peel's embrace of 
indie was the result of a Damascene conversion during 1976/77. Where once he'd 
been the voice of "head" music, punk saw him cast aside his previous musical 
identity. For proof, look at the first two Festive 50s – his end-of-year charts 
– from 1976 and 1977. The first compiled his listeners' all-time top 50 songs. 
It was topped by Stairway to Heaven. The following year he picked his own 
favourite tracks of the year. The Motors were at Nos 1 and 3. Even the Lurkers 
made No 12.
