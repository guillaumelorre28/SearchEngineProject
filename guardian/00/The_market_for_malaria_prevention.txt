Tucked away among the disorientating maze of vendors in Kano's central market, 
is Ali Yahaya's fabric and curtain stall. "one thousand, two hundred Naira 
[around Â£5]" he barks, holding an [long-lasting insecticidal net] LLIN up in 
its shiny wrapper. Yahaya has been selling the nets for two years and is one of 
only a small number of sellers in the market who stocks LLINs, buying them in 
from an importer in Lagos for around 700 Naira.

Yahaya's stall gives no hint of the fact that he sells LLINs, save the few 
packets that lie hidden among the fabrics, rugs and curtains at the back of the 
stall. But despite the lack of promotion, and the high price, Ali enjoys a 
steady trade: "I often run out of nets and I can sell around 10 or 15 of these 
LLINs in one day."

He goes on to explain: "More people have come since the mass campaign and some 
people even phone me up from their homes to say they want a net."

Through the government's, and partners like SuNMaP's, programmes of support 
for the commercial sector in Nigeria, the hope is that more sellers like Yahaya 
will be able to emerge and, with increased competition, prices will go down.

"If the nets were cheaper to buy at the wholesaler then I would sell them for 
a cheaper price", says Yahaya with a shrug. For now, he sells at the price he 
can to make a profit and relies on word of mouth to bring his customers to his 
door.
