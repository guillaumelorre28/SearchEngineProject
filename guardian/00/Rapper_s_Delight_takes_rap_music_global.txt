Famously, the first hip-hop single wasn't actually the first. Rapper's 
Delight, the Sugarhill Gang's 15 minutes of fame, was beaten to shops by King 
Tim III (Personality Jock), the B-side of a Fatback Band 12-inch. But it was 
Rapper's Delight – a debut both for hip-hop's first imprint and its eponymous 
group – that sent this new music around the world, a global audience forever 
associating this new music with that odd opening line: "I said a hip, hop, the 
hippie, the hippie ...".

For all hip-hop's rulebook-destroying approach to the records it was made 
from, the story of the Sugar Hill label, and of Rapper's Delight in particular, 
is striking for its echoes of earlier eras.Hip-hop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop> might have had a strident sense of 
authenticity but the genre's first hitmakers were a manufactured band – put 
together by former soul/disco singer Sylvia Robinson. She'd set up an 
independent label and was looking for the next big sound to make some money 
from. The backing track, ostensibly Chic's Good Times, was replayed by an 
in-house band, and Robinson's new-school Motown had recording, mixing, pressing 
and promo departments all under one roof. Infamously, Big Bank Hank rapped 
lyrics written by Cold Crush Brothers' MC Grandmaster Caz, his borrowing so 
blatant he even spells out Caz's name in the song. New sound, same old rules.
