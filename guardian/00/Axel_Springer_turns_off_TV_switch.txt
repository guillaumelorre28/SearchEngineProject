German newspaper publisher Axel Springer has abandoned plans to enter 
television and instead pocketed €509m (£366m) for its 12% stake inProSiebenSat1 
from private equity firms that control Europe's second-largest broadcaster. The 
move comes only days after the Berlin-based company signalled it could close 
its German postal services groupPIN, and write down €600m (£432m), as another 
attempt to diversify away from print appears to have foundered. Both moves cast 
a pall on the record ofMathias Döpfner, Springer's chief executive. (Via FT.com
