And Caspar here – echoing Alex Needham's sentiments. It's been a great 
festival –Womadelaide 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/11/womadelaide-festival-2013> 
included, for me, and also the festival within a festival that was Unsound. 
I've just ended things up by seeing the final performance of Kamp, whichAlex 
reviewed the other day 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/kamp-adelaide-festival>. It was 
harrowing, but I'm pleased I managed to catch it, and only regret that there 
were other shows here that I simply didn't have time to see.

I could pretend that I've researched the following, but in fact it's lifted 
straight from the festival office's press release - because after all the 
action here, I'm bushed.


Offering one of the most diverse and exciting programs in many years, the first annual Adelaide 
Festival closed on Sunday 17 March surpassing its box-office target, with 76 sell-out performances contributing to a total income in excess of $2.6 million across 44 ticketed events.

Adelaide Festival Chief Executive Karen Bryant said: 

“The 2013 Festival has not only exceeded its 
box-office target, it has generated an increased level of economic impact for the state, proving its 
value as an annual event.”


The festival is projected to generate a total economic benefit in the vicinity of $25 million with 
approximately 28% of all ticketed attendances by visitors from interstate and overseas. (All figures 
above exclude Womadelaide and Turner from the Tate.)


Whilst final attendances for all 54 Adelaide Festival events are still being collated, it is anticipated 
they will exceed 327,000, including Womadelaide and Turner from the Tate.

Genial scouser David Sefton, responsible for pulling the artistic side of 
things together, also reckons (ahem ... according to this bit of paper): 

It’s been a thrilling experience 
... throughout the festival people have embraced the unconventional and diverse range of shows on offer. It’s left me with no doubt that our Adelaide Festival audiences are hungry for challenging and progressive work. I can’t wait to let everyone know what I’ve got up my sleeve for next year!

And having had nattered to David at various points over the last week, you 
know what? I believe him.

To see what the Guardian team made of it all, have a butcher's around the site 
we created <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/adelaide-festival-2013> for the 
festival, which we've been proud to support. Here's some more facts, and tweets 
… until next time.

Alex here on the final night of the Adelaide festival and I've just posted my 
review of last night's Unsound Adelaide 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/17/unsound-adelaide-lustmord-pole-ben-frost>
, which saw Lustmord, Demdike Stare, Pole and Ben Frost take the audience into 
deep, dark and extremely loud places. At one point I felt that my entire body 
was vibrating, but it was an exhilarating experience - and one that set off 
every car alarm in the vicinity.

I spoke to Dan Stewart, an electronic music fan from Perth, between Pole and 
Ben Frost - the latter being my favourite performer of the night. Here's his 
review.

While that was happening, Caspar was having a less enjoyable time at Flamenco 
Hoy - read his review here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/16/flamenco-hoy-adelaide-festival>. 

This afternoon I've been the last of my collegues to experience Ontrerand 
Goerd's A Game of You 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/adelaide-festival-2013-theatre>, 
which I found more moving than I anticipated. Maybe it's that I'm very easy to 
read - or simply just a sap - but they certainly managed to push my buttons. It 
seemed a strangely apt show for me to end the festival on - small-scale and 
personal.

Here's Jane Howard for the last time with the tweets. First up, the Quartet 
who played at Unsound with Demdike Stare.

Jane Howard has been perusing Twitter. First of all, the sonic assault of last 
night's Unsound 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/16/unsound-adelaide-actress-hype-williams>
 caused a tweet sensation:

Hi, it's Caspar again here, fresh as a daisy after a night spent seeing 
Solaris at the Town Hall and then suffering a full-on aural and physical 
assault at the Queen's Theatre, both events courtesy ofUnsound 
<http://unsound.pl/en>.

Here's one review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/16/solaris-frost-adelaide-festival>.

And here's another 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/16/unsound-adelaide-actress-hype-williams>
 (spoiler: I give Hype Williams and co five stars).

Earlier in the day I'd spoken to Mat Schulz, the guy from Wagga Wagga 
responsible for this festival within a festival.

Schulz left Australia 15 years ago for Krakow in Poland, thinking he'd have 
the head space there to devote time to writing novels. Instead, a small 
experimental music festival that he started grew and grew, and now as well as 
an annual week-long event in his adopted home city, there have been a series of 
shows in New York, with plans for something in London later this year.

I asked him about his guiding ethos.

The guiding principle is that everything we put on has to have some 
experimental aims. The lineups have always been pretty varied – everything from 
classical and post-classical music to the more experimental indie bands. But 
most of it is electronic music because a lot of people experimenting with music 
are playing electronic music. It's still hard to define what it is. Other 
festivals working in similar territory use terms like “ambitious music” or 
“adventurous music” but none of those really capture what it is ...

He added how excited he was to bring Unsound to Adelaide 
<http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2013/music/unsound_adelaide> because of the 
chance it brings to expose the sort of music he loves – he raved to me about 
acts on the bill likeHype Williams 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/05/hype-williams-speak-the-truth> and 
also the UK artistLaurel Halo <http://www.laurelhalo.com/> - to an audience 
that might otherwise never get the chance to think or experience it live. “It's 
a brave thing for the Adelaide festival to do!”

We also talked about how the most challenging music seems to always end up 
seeping into the mainstream – “look at dubstep! It's almost a dirty word now. 
And the same thing is starting to happen withnoise 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music> ...”; whether the benefits of 
technology are always unambiguous – “software programs like Ableton make it 
much easier to create quite adequate music, but it's just as hard as ever to 
find your own voice”; and why what he calls experimental music shouldn't simply 
be regarded as something cerebral.

Oh no! A lot of it is very physical - with a lot of bass - and there's a big 
tendency towards the immersive. A lot of this music makes you feel uneasy, and 
that is somehow enjoyable.

And what other sorts of music does Schulz like? Kenny Rogers?

Well, yes … I love country music!

Afternoon, Alex here and I've just posted a review of last night's show by 
Archie Roach 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/16/archie-roach-adelaide-festival>. 
He's a remarkable performer and inspired incredible audience warmth - probably 
the most I've seen all festival. Some of it will have been due to the 
extraordinary personal hardships he's experiences in the past three years - his 
partner has died, he's had a stroke and lung cancer - but as I say in the 
review, he is a powerful performer and didn't need anyone's sympathy vote.

Here's the verdict of audience member Sharon Golan.

After that, deterred by the enormous queue at Barrio 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/09/adelaide-festival-2013-circus>, 
I went toTuxedo Cat 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/adelaide-festival-fringe>, where 
a mere seven uniformed police turned up at about midnight, presumably in search 
of liquor license violations. A bit heavy-handed, no?

Just across the road, an electronic music festival was also taking place. 
Sadly, no camels participated.

Morning, Alex here and last night the theatrical first night at the Adelaide 
festival was Nosferatu by Polish company TR Warszawa, who staged a very popular 
and innovative Macbeth at Edinburgh a few years ago. AlasNosferatu is a bit of 
a dud 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/15/adelaide-festival-2013-theatre> 
- I've posted my review here.

After the show I spoke to some audience members who also seemed 
unenthusiastic. Here is a considered take from Susannah Jared who was perturbed 
by what she regarded as the production's sexism.

After that I went to the Barrio where the theme was "animal house". The camels 
and Shetland ponies had just left, but some very cute miniature pigs remained.

Good morning. Caspar here. Brain still in meltdown after the start of Unsound 
<http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2013/music/unsound_adelaide> last night. A 
proper report will follow, but some images below perhaps give you a flavour of 
the event ...

Tonight there's more with performances from ambient artist Tim Hecker 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker> (who also featured last night with 
Oneohtrix Point Never <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneohtrix_Point_Never>); 
the fascinating Actress (Darren Cunningham to his mum;read more here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/14/actress-darren-cunningham-rip>); 
and the equally spellbinding Hype Williams.

The latter are a mysterious entity. This is from an interview 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/05/hype-williams-speak-the-truth> by 
Ben Beaumont-Thomas <https://twitter.com/ben_bt> with them in the Guardian last 
year:

Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland – not their real names – have claimed various 
things about themselves over the three years they've been together. That they 
released music by putting USB sticks in apples and selling them in Brixton 
market. That they're mates with New York rapper Cam'ron 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/ea6b7199-901d-4c0e-8242-6d7bc2bf62b7>. 
That Inga recently tried out for Arsenal's womens' team. That Dean was caught 
robbing raccoons from taxidermists and joined the Nation of Islam. One press 
shot features them lurking in the background of the infamous 1997 meeting 
between Tony Blair and Noel Gallagher. Their name is a lie in a way – Hype 
Williams is already the name of a very successful rap video director 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_Williams>. "Life's pretty exciting – some 
shit is true, some stuff really does happen," Blunt says. But there's no 
telling what shit is true and what shit isn't, a feeling enhanced by their 
shadowplaying music that flits between dub, rap and pop as samples stumble in, 
motheaten by echo.

I've seen the pair play in London before, but that one time, the dry ice in 
the venue was so thick and the tiny place so crowded that I couldn't actually 
see them. So it was exciting for me at the Queen's Theatre here last night when 
I spotted a pair I assumed to be Dean and Inge ... I'll perhaps write about 
this later, if I also manage to catch up with the folk behind Unsound to hear 
why they've made it here to Adelaide.

And here's a review of Severed Heads 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/14/severed-heads-adelaide-festival> 
last night.

Caspar again. I now need to nip back to the Quen's Theatre for the Unsound 
festival that forms part ofthe bigger Adelaide shebang over the next three 
nights. Four hours of dark electronica await me tonight alone!

I'm particularly looking forward to Oneohtrix Point Never 
<http://www.pointnever.com/> and, later, Raime - more about them here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/nov/22/raime-we-wanted-rawness>, plus 
vital inside knowledge: the poor boys can't afford breakfast in their posh 
hotel (they told me last night), so if you spot them out in Adelaide, perhaps 
be kind and buy them a bun.

5.13am GMT 

And here is that promised chat with Tom Ellard from Severed Heads 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/14/tom-ellard-severed-heads-adelaide>!

Well, Lustmord <http://www.lustmord.com/> (AKA Brian William) was absolutely 
fascinating. There can't be any other people who've had cocktails withBurt 
Bacharach <http://bacharachonline.com/>, dinner with Kenneth Anger 
<http://www.kennethanger.org/> and an American road trip with Chris and Cosey 
<http://www.chrisandcosey.com/>, formerly of Throbbing Gristle. I'll post that

Good morning, Caspar here. Events have now overtaken this live blog. Yesterday 
Iposted a review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/adelaide-festival-2013-theatre> 
of A Game of You, the third piece from Belgian company Ontroerend Goed at the 
Dunstan Playhouse, with a passing reference to the papal conclave, andnow we 
have a new pope 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/13/pope-francis-mario-bergoglio-election>
.

BIG SPOILER ALERT!

A more closely kept secret than the identity of the new pontiff is what 
actually happens to audience members at the show. If you've not been,please 
immediately ignore the embedded audio below. If you have, and you've read my 
review, you'll understand what's going on (although this recording is a 
shortened version of the full thing and doesn't contain the final, dismaying 
judgment passed on me.)

It's not the only Ontroerend show from which punters take something away – or 
rather, are giving something. Those like my colleague Jane who sawInternal 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2013/mar/11/ontroerend-goed-adelaide-festival> 
received a letter in the post several days later. Photographic evidence below 
also.

From the festival centre I then hot-footed it across town to meet Tom Ellard, 
theSevered Heads <http://www.sevcom.com/> man. We had a fascinating chat, from 
which I'll pick out the bones and turn into something later today. And then I 
went to their gig, in the beautiul Queen's Theatre. More on that later too.

Alex checking in, and while my colleagues were watching Severed Heads I had a 
great Fringe experience watchingWolf Creek: the Musical 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wolf-Creek-The-Musical/358737697555730?fref=ts> 
at Format, a ramshackle venue just off Hindley Street. I wasn't sure what to 
expect - and I've always been too chicken to seethe film  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2005/sep/16/3>- but it was genuinely very 
funny. Props should particularly go to Kel Balnaves as the axe-wielding serial 
killer, James McCann on the piano and the man playing a variety of parts 
including a frog and a campfire. Showing the industrious and enterprising 
nature of the Fringe here, each cast member seems to have their own individual 
Fringe show too.

Back at the official festival, I'm off to interview "dark ambient" maestro 
Lustmord who is playing as part of the Unsound strand. Here he is doing his 
thing:

Alex here. I've just posted my report on the Adelaide Fringe 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/adelaide-festival-fringe>. Has 
comedy squeezed out other art forms? Are there enough bums to put on the seats? 
Do the artists have to take a financial bath?

I spoke to quite a few performers and other interesting folk, but couldn't 
quite fit in my chat with Sxip Shirey, composer/performer of Limbo, topping 
this bill at the Garden of Earthly Delights andwhich Caspar has reviewed here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/limbo-adelaide-festival-circus>.

Shirey is a veteran of the Edinburgh fringe and compared the two places like 
so:

It's a little more chilled. Instead of being rainy all the time it's sunny and 
you can buy kangaroo meat to eat.

So now you know.

Good afternoon, Caspar here, fresh from a foray into the world of the Fringe. 
Last night I saw and enjoyedLimbo 
<http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/limbo/094662d8-9798-46a4-abb3-a5f7ebae258c>
, a new show from Strut & Fret that heads to London after packing up in 
Adelaide.

After a lot of tramping about over the last few days, it was a joy to sit down 
in the amazing Spiegeltent in the Garden of Unearthly Delights. I felt 
exhausted just watching the hand-balancing, sword-swallowing and more. Here'smy 
full review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/limbo-adelaide-festival-circus>, 
with a taste of some other folks' reaction below.

Tonight I'll be watching Severed Heads 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severed_Heads>, who come to the Festival for a 
one-off show at the Queen's Theatre. The band are one offestival director David 
Sefton's favourites 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/feb/24/adelaide-festival-australia-david-sefton>
, and as he told us the other week:

"They are cult artists and I played their records in my bedroom in my parents' 
house .... I went to meet the lead singerTom Ellard <http://tomellard.com/> 
[now a university film lecturer in Sydney], and the first thing he said to me 
was: 'Just don't ask me to reform the Severed Heads.'"

But with a wave of Sefton's magic wand ....

At this point I must confess I don't know much about them, other than they 
formed in Sydney in 1979, using tape loops and synths to create an unholy 
squall before developing into something a teensy bit more pop. They split in 
2008, but reformed for a 30th anniversary show in 2010, and then toured with 
Gary Numan. But after tonight, that's it, for ever. Promise. Apparently. More 
later, but first, you too can enjoy theHauntology House 
<http://www.abc.net.au/arts/hauntologyhouse/>, an online installation - or 
"musical toy for your computer" - created by Ellard for the Festival ...

Alex here and I've posted my review of Kamp, which you can read here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/13/kamp-adelaide-festival>. For me, 
it was one of those shows that came into focus only a couple of hours after it 
finished and I'd had the chance to take it in and what it was trying to do. 

After the performance, the three people onstage invite the audience down to 
view the set - a minature version of Auschwitz - more closely, and discuss the 
issues with them. A fellow British journalist here,Etan Smallman 
<https://twitter.com/EtanSmallman>, was shocked at the callousness of the some 
of the audience responses - people taking photographs to upload to their 
Facebook pages and clamouring for a good look at the gas chambers. I also was 
also taken aback by the response of a middle-aged man I spoke to who said that 
Kamp contained "every cliche about the Holocaust". What was he expecting - the 
Nazis depicted as the good guys?

We had a good - and only slightly heated - discussion about it this morning 
with some of the Australian folks we are hanging out with here, and they said 
that the Holocaust isn't really taught in great detail in Australian schools - 
especially not compared to the Gallipoli campaign, annually commemorated here 
on 25 April,Anzac day 
<http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/anzac_tradition.asp>. Being so far 
from Europe, the Holocaust feels rather remote. All the more reason, I suppose 
that Kamp should be seen - and to be fair to the people of Adelaide, it is a 
sell-out.

I'm off to do three interviews back-to-back now: Czech violin and film star 
Iva Bittová <http://www.bittova.com/>, the dancers from Flamenco Hoy and Jason 
Craig, performingBeowulf - A Thousand Years of Baggage 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/12/beowulf-a-thousand-years-of-baggage>
. Anything I should ask them?

Alex checking in. I've just been to see Kamp by Dutch theatre company Hotel 
Modern <http://www.hotelmodern.nl/>. It's part stage work, part installation 
which depicts Auschwitz using puppets and models, which are filmed live by a 
minature camera, the results projected onto the back of the stage. I'll post my 
review tomorrow but it seemed to divide opinion among the people I spoke to 
afterwards - one man said he was not merely unmoved but bored by it. One 
theatre-goer, Constantine Costi, from Sydney, thought it was a "staggering and 
claustrophobic work". Here's his take.

Still slightly recovering from a long old night that included a WOMADelaide 
afterparty, it'sCaspar here again. What I have managed to do is work up a 
conversation I had with Hugh Masekela - not in the bar in the wee hours, 
although he was there, rubbing shoulders with the festival's crew, but earlier 
on site - for our What I'm Thinking series with artists here in Adelaide for 
these two weeks.It's here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/12/hugh-masekela-womadelaide-african-culture>
.

There's more music to come this week, including a mini Unsound  
<http://unsound.pl/en>festival, featuring some of the world's more interesting 
electronic acts (not the sort of thing I imagine Masekela would care for!). 
It's an event with its origins in Poland and Australia - from 2001 to 2006 it 
seems it was part of theWagga Space Program <http://space-program.org/>.

The bill has changed a bit since first advertised, but good news for me is 
that I really like a couple of the acts who are now involved. One of them is
Hype Williams 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/05/hype-williams-speak-the-truth>, 
whose Dean Blunt in his solo guise put out one of my favourite records of last 
year.Here it is <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZK7SVm8hvE> to whet the 
appetite.

I've just posted a review of Beowulf - A Thousand Years of Baggage 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/12/beowulf-a-thousand-years-of-baggage>
, which had its first night in Adelaide at the German Club last night.

I had my reservations but theatre-goer Lydia Nicholson, who I interviewed 
after the show, was much more enthusiastic. Here she is with her verdict.

In the wee small hours of this morning - just before the aftershow got 
underway -Caspar posted his five-star review of WOMADelaide 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/11/womadelaide-festival-2013>. He 
writes:

Goran Bregovic came within a whisker of stealing the weekend. The Marco Pierre 
White lookalike is a masterful chef d'orchestre, as they say in other parts of 
the world; he looked like the boss man in his immaculate silver suit, but stay 
seated for most of his by turns moving and then uproarious performance, letting 
his superb 18-piece band - involving, I think, a mixture of authentic Gypsy 
players such as the Kosovan refugee goc drummer Muharem Redzepi and 
conservatory pros including saxophonist Stojan Dimovget - get on with it. But 
for the odd moment when he did calm things down - as with a rendition of his 
hilariousIn the Death Car 
<http://www.metrolyrics.com/in-the-death-car-lyrics-goran-bregovic.html> - he 
mesmerised, too.

As Caspar mentioned a while ago, I (Alex) had an extraordinary early evening 
away from the Adelaide festival when I looked in a shindig of a very different 
kind, the Future Music Festival. It was a bit like old-style Glastonbury in 
reverse - instead of all rock music with a token dance tent, this was a full 
on, multi-stage EDM/brostep assault, with one rock stage in the middle which 
Bloc Party were headlining.

The crowd were young, up for it and indulging in extra-musical activties 
including a foam party - sponsored by Strongbow - and a wrestling ring in which 
macho types could batter their mate in front of a rag tag and bobtail of mildly 
interested onlookers. Suffice it to say that the last time I'd experienced that 
much naked flesh and unbridled testosterone was at Gay Pride on Clapham Common 
circa 1995.

Into this melee strode probably the perfect act - Dizzee Rascal, roadtesting 
some new material so unabashedly pop it makesDance Wiv Me 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibLntdLiJA> sound like Throbbing Gristle 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzDvpT-MjYs>. Not that I'm complaining - the 
top 10 is an infinitely more interesting place with Dizzee in it, and if new 
song (cough) Arse Like That is just a couple of notes away from being Lady 
Gaga's Bad Romance, who's counting?

close  He played this one, to a hysterical reception. 
It was hard to leave Dizzee, but the opening riff of I Wanna be Adored has a 
Pavlov's dogs-style reaction in northern men of a certain age, so I followed it 
to the "indie stage" where the Stone Roses were second on the bill. The first 
signs weren't good. The crowd was nearly as thin as Ian Brown's voice, and John 
Squires had a leather waistcoat on.

Yet as the sun went down and Waterfall turned into Don't Stop, something 
magical happened. It swiftly became apparently that the Stone Roses were 
sounding utterly brilliant - so tight that they were almost telepathic, pumping 
new blood through songs you thought worn out with overuse. Then they played a 
15-miunte version of Fool's Gold, yet no-one wanted it to end. I swear it 
wasn't the sunshine, or the cans of gin and tonic. The Stone Roses were 
imperial.

I had to leave after that to see ... an adaptation of Beowulf in the main 
festival. I'll post a review in the morning. But the chords of This is the One 
are still crashing through my head, and will be for quite a while.

Oh, but he came close. This is a final dispatch from the WOMADelaide festival 
site, which I wasn't going to bother with but it's only just gone midnight, and 
even though I am disgustingly drenched in sweat, I do want to say that Goran 
Bregovic just came within a whisker of stealing the weekend. The Marco Pierre 
White lookalike is a masterful chef d'orchestre, as they say in other parts of 
the world; he looked like the boss man in his immaculate silver suit, but stay 
seated for most of his by turns moving and then uproarious performance, letting 
his superb 18-piece band - involving, I think, a mixture of authentic Gypsy 
players such as the Kosovan refugee goc drummer Muharem Redzepi and 
conservatory pros including saxophonist Stojan Dimovget (my research 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/08/goran-bregovic-remind-people-gypsy-culture-given>
) - get on with it. But for the odd moment when he did calm things down - as 
with a rendition of his hilariousIn the Deathcar  
<http://www.metrolyrics.com/in-the-death-car-lyrics-goran-bregovic.html>- he 
mesmerised, too.

Someone at the festival this wekeend (was it the band Moriarty?) said that 
Adelaide has the highest number of serial killers per head of population in the 
world. I don't know about that. But on the basis of the dancing as Bregovic's 
set came to a close, there are certainly plenty of bona fide nutters here. Fair 
play all round.

Or as he indeed said at the end: "If you don't go crazy, you are not normal."

Caspar here again, and WOMADelaide is winding down, although the way in which 
the Herd <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Herd_(Australian_band)> have just 
ripped up the second stage with their Aussie hip hop rather gives the lie to 
that.

Did I happen to mention earlier that it's been hot? I feared for the health of 
a couple of fellahs dancing uproariously in the full glare of the mid-afternoon 
sun to Souad Massi earlier, especially as while she looked on the shy side when 
I saw her at Taste the World, she was really rocking it now. Then I enjoyed 
more rock and a touch of the blues fromEast Company 
<http://www.eastjourney.com.au/>, who come from the Yirrkala community in North 
East Arnhem Land, and whose set included a nice shout out to Gurrumul.

I then got a bit sidetracked interviewing, first, Hugh Masekela and then Jimmy 
Cliff. Hard life, I know. I'll write them up in due course, but the headlines 
are: Hugh isn't so convinced by stories of Africa's economic development; and 
Jimmy actually does rate Cool Runnings up there with The Harder they Come ...

Now I'm going to catch Goran Bregovic, who brings all the action to a close on 
the main stage. A full review of the festival will follow, I reckon. Time to 
get out of this cabin where I've been working, even if it still is 
air-conditioned ... (I know, hard life, etc etc etc.)

It's been grand.

Afternoon, it's Alex Needham here. Yesterday I said that I was going to 
interview Joeri Smet from the controversial Belgian theatre company Ontroerend 
Goed, whose one-to-one immersive theatre trilogy is one of the talking points 
of the Adelaide festival - one of the issues being whether it exploits its 
audience.That piece is now online here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2013/mar/11/ontroerend-goed-adelaide-festival>
. Before I interviewed him I asked for questions and got this via Twitter: 
Jennifer G H (@jennJGH) 
@alexneedham74 <https://twitter.com/alexneedham74> I'd be asking him for a

Ahem. I've also just posted a piece by the eminent Australian author Peter Robb
 <http://www.duffyandsnellgrove.com.au/authors/robb.htm> in which he ruminates 
on men's fears of turning 40 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/11/peter-robb-alexis-dimitriades> - 
and whether they're justified. I'd be particularly interest in what women have 
to say about this, so please let me know in the comments here,there

Good afternoon, Caspar <https://twitter.com/CasparLS> here again on the last 
day of WOMADelaide – and if today is supposed to be a more relaxed affair, it's 
hotter than ever out there, with the temperature forecast to touch 38 degrees. 
Later there'll be performances from Goran Bregovic – here'san interview 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/08/goran-bregovic-remind-people-gypsy-culture-given>
 with the Balkan singer published in the Guardian last Friday – as well as 
Aussie hip hop outfit the Herd, and talents from across Oceania for aSing Sing 
<http://www.womadelaide.com.au/program/sing-sing> performance, plus a number of 
acts familiar from this long weekend in Mad March already.

First, though, I mentioned last night that after their rip-snorting showing on 
the second stage, I grabbed Tim Rogers and Lance Ferguson from the Bamboos for 
a brief chat in the bijoux garden in the backstage area. I'vewritten that up 
here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/11/tim-rogers-bamboos-womadelaide> if 
you want to take a look. Turns out they're Katy Perry fans.

And here's a fabulous gallery 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/gallery/2013/mar/10/adelaide-festival-2013-festivals>
 of some of our photographer Alicia Canter's best photos from the festival so 
far. Plus some more reaction from the wonnerfulworldoftwitter (in which I 
fulfil a request) ...

Alex Needham reporting for duty after a blazing hot afternoon and evening 
exploring Adelaide's fringe. With Adelaide arts journalistJane Howard as my 
guide, I saw three shows in five hours - and two of them were brilliant.

The first was a circus show called A Simple Space by Gravity and Other Myths  
<http://www.gravityandothermyths.com.au/>at the Birdcage, an old cinema near 
Adelaide's East Terrace. My expectations weren't high - like Jarvis Cocker, I 
don't approve of things like tumbling - but the five performers, four men and 
one woman, were amazing. With nothing but a mat and a live drummer, they 
created a riveting show of the most incredible physical feats. You haven't 
lived until you've seen two blokes stand on each other's shoulders then suspend 
a woman, Jascha Boyce, on a pole between them - who then performs gymnastics 
about 12 ft in the air. Or a backflip competition. Alas about five minutes 
before the end, in a routine in which Boyce was flung around the room, one of 
the men dropped her, which made the rest of the show a rather heart-in-mouth 
affair. But it was a total triumph. You can see Gravity and Other Myths doing 
their thing here.

... to watch Anthropoetry <http://www.benmellor.net/anthropoetry/>, a show by 
BritsBen Mellor <http://www.benmellor.net/> (words) and Dan Steele (music). It 
took the form of a journey around the human body, demonstrated by Steele, who 
wore a body stocking with pictures of the vital organs in the relevant places. 
Mellor, who in 2009 won Radio 4's poetry slam 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n1p9v>, certainly has a way with words, and 
his rhymes and beatboxing landed somewhere betweenLoose Ends 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjym> and Mike Skinner. I particularly 
enjoyed Pain (inspired by the nervous system), which leaned on nu-metal to 
create something brilliantly witty and clever. I'm not sure that doing a song 
about the pasty tax 12,000 miles from the UK was very wise, but it was a 
virtuoso yet touching hour, a salutary reminder of just how much undiscovered 
talent is out there. Sign them up, someone.

close  Ben Mellor performing not in Adelaide but in Cambridge in 2011. 
After two great shows in a row I knew I was pushing my luck to see a third, 
The Book of Loco, and so it sadly proved. Written and performed byAlirio Zavarce
 <http://www.nostringsattached.org.au/alirio-zavarce.html> in a space in the 
Tandanya gallery <http://www.tandanya.com.au/>, which houses the largest 
collection of indigenous art in Australia, I wanted to like it. The space was 
walled in by cardboard boxes, on which were projected images in a way familiar 
fromEs Devlin's stage designs 
<http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-24/es-devlin-reimagines-the-live-show-for-kanye-west>
 but still impressive to see pulled off on a shoestring.

Unfortunately, the play lost me when Zavrice started passing a plate of shit 
around the audience (mercifully with clingfilm on top of it) and then tried to 
demonstrate that it could be sold for $20. This was to make a point about the 
intrinsic value of money. The script - which leaned on Zavrice's real-life 
experiences as a Venezuelan immigrant in Australia, and could have been moving 
in other circumstaces - was full of this half-baked student guff. Worse still, 
the show didn't know when to stop. Yet it pulled in a good-sized audience who 
applauded it warmly.

I finished the night with a drink in the Tuxedo Cat, a huge venue which 
contains six theatres and seems to be ground zero of Adelaide's fringe theatre 
scene. It's got a brilliant atmosphere and I can't wait to go back - probably 
not for this show, mind.

Caspar here again, with sore feet after a long day spent traipsing around the 
WOMADelaide site, however compact it might be. I half dozed off during the 
performance from Hindustani classical vocalist Manjiri Kelkar and one of the 
great singers in the southern Carnatic tradition Sudha Ragunathan, which is 
meant as a compliment, and I'm also pleased to report that I didn't then 
completely burn as I lay exposed on the grass. That said, even though the 
photographic evidence below doesn't tell this story, I was then seen dancing to 
the excellent Novalima, the band of Peruvian expats, who even brought out their 
notorious donkey jawbone (sounds like a metaphor;it isn't 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/novalima-mixes-old-new-sounds-peru-article-1.421344>
) - so perhaps the sun had got to me.

Otherwise there was the Soweto Gospel Choir, who finished their joyous set 
with a tribute to Miriam Makeba in the form of a version ofPata Pata 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc61z9IFu4>, and then Oh Happy Day 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNQXQKflJNA>, the classic made famous by the 
Edwin Hawkins Singers. “I don't know anything about South African music,” said 
a woman in the crowd next to me, “but I know I like this,” a nice sentiment, 
although perhaps next time - just for kicks - they should knock out a Morrissey 
number.

On the main stage, Salif Keita came next, who is a decade younger than last 
night's headliner, Hugh Masekela. To begin with he looked a contained presence 
by comparison, sporting shades, moving little behind the mic. His band 
struggled to connect, too, partly I think because as well as a kora player, 
percussionists and a lead guitarist, they employ a figure hunched behind a 
keyboard, triggering sounds and samples from a computer – something to which 
I've precisley zero objections, except now the bigger band sound they were 
trying to emulate sounded slightly thin. And while there were classic songs – 
Yamore, for instance, frommy very favourite of his albums, 2002's Moffou 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/nov/23/albums-decade-salif-keita>
 – he lent heavily on his new record,Talé 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/feb/07/salif-keita-tale-review>, which is 
produced by Philippe Cohen Solal from the Gotan Project and which aims to 
create a contemporary dance sound. It only started to work as the sky darkened, 
but – big but – by the end, when they were locked into the groove, and the kora 
player was doing his best Hendrix impression, playing his instrument behind his 
back, it was stunning – far more convincing than on record.

Special mention must go to sinuous dancer-cum-backing vocalist Gladys Gambie, 
who not only took Cesaria Evora's part on Yamore, but also that of Salif's 
youngest daughter Natty on the track of that name which is my favourite tune on 
Talé. And does it need repeating that Salif Keita himself, who first appeared 
at Womadelaide 20 years ago, can sing a bit?

He was also dancing by the end, perhaps buoyed by the crowd serenading him 
with Happy Birthday, at his invitation earlier (only slightly strange as this 
doesn't tally with myextensive research 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salif_Keita>).

Over on the second stage, it was the turn of the Bamboos 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bamboos_%28funk_band%29>, with their new 
guest vocalistTim Rogers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Am_I>. That union 
follows the soaraway success of I Got Burned – which inevitably ended the set – 
but before then the singer had done enough to suggest that he merits the job on 
a permanent basis, something he joked about. More about this in the morning, 
because I've just had a chat with Lance from the band and Tim. Then little 
respite before the evening's main headliner,Jimmy Cliff 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jimmycliff>.

He wasn't really for me. He played all his classics, but there wasn't the same 
musical questing evident in Salif Keita's show (interesting that they are 
pretty much exact contemporaries). Maybe it was just that I was disappointed 
that when he asked the crowd if they were aware of a movie that spread the 
reggae gospel worldwide, he actually did mean The Harder They Come, and not 
that bona fide classic Cool Runnings – whence his cover of Johnny Nash's I Can 
See Clearly Now, a hit for him in 1993 and which featured in the set. As did 
his version ofHakuna Matata 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_%28song%29> from The Lion King, 
which was just a step tooOctopus's Garden 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopuses_Garden> far for me.

Apologies for sounding churlish. The good news is that the action continues 
tomorrow – with Goran Bregovic, more ofBassekou Kouyate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/bassekou-kouyate> and more. Until then.

Hi, it's Caspar Llewellyn Smith, back at WOMADelaide 
<http://www.womadelaide.com.au/> for the third day.

It's scorchio out there - the hottest day yet – and it makes you feel a bit 
for any performers who might think they've not drawn a big crowd, when in fact 
the audience is dispersed some distance away, seeking any shade that's going. 
It hasn't meant the crowds haven't lapped the music up. I just caught a bit of 
the Azerbaijani singerAlim Qasimov <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alim_Qasimov> 
and his band on the main stage, and “transcendental” is the right word, even 
though his deeply spiritual music feels made for colder climes (I checked 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/587084>: it's a temperate 9 degrees in Baku right 
now).

I also wandered off to see Jimmy Cliff talk, but disappointingly, as with Salf 
Keita yesterday, he cancelled. Jet lag perhaps. Both play the main stage 
tonight. So instead I popped my head into the Taste the World tent, where local 
foodie Rosa Matto was talking to the charming Algerian singerSouad Massi 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souad_Massi> as she cooked couscous – alas, 
Australian couscous from a packet, not the real sing – with white sauce, which 
as you asked involves 1kg leg of lamb cut into pieces, 6 zucchinis, 4 turnips, 
3 finely chopped onions, some chickpeas, cinammon powder, olive oil, coriander, 
salt, pepper. Bet you're happy to know that. More of this sort of exciting 
journalism as it happens through the day.

. Lyn Gardner wondered whether it exploited the audience, and whether the 
theatre company were equipped to help them with any resulting emotional fallout.

Later on, Caspar will have more from Womad.

Alex Needham here. This evening I saw the final performance of The Strange 
Undoing of Prudencia Hart by the National Theatre of Scotland, which got a 
well-deserved stnding ovation. AsJohn Crace says in his five-star review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/08/strange-undoing-prudencia-hart>, 
the show which takes place in a pub - the German Club in Adelaide, for the 
city's German community <http://www.thegermanclub.com.au/> (I recommend the 
bockwurst) - and conjures a hilarious and complex evening out of almost nothing 
but some incredibly agile writing - in rhyming couplets at that! - and 
performers who seem to be able to do almost anything - singing, playing musical 
instruments, and of course acting. It's an extraordinary piece for theatre and 
I'm glad I saw it.

After that, to research a piece I'm writing I went to the fringe club, where 
the fringe performers and theatremakers seem to hang out after hours, and 
chatted to a lot of interesting people about Adelaide's fringe - incredibly, 
the biggest in the southern hemisphere - and how it has evolved over the years. 
Apparently comedians dominate these days, and according to one of the judges of 
the comedy awards, they're usually male and crude. She then told me a joke 
which would probably close this blog down if I printed it, so it wasn't 
prudishness talking. Women comics of Australia, your country needs you.

After the throng gyrated to a selection of music ranging from Jackie Wilson's 
Reet Petite to Snoop Dogg's Drop it Like it's Hot, a juggler took to the stage 
dressed as a German white rasta - think of a spin on Ali G. At that point I 
made my excuses and left. If you're at the festival, do let us know what you've 
been seeing by posting below.

It's Caspar Llewellyn Smith again.

So a day that began with Hugh Masekela in conversation finished with him 
headlining the main stage atWomadelaide <http://www.womadelaide.com.au/>, but 
first came several great performances. I particularly enjoyedMoriarty 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriarty_%28band%29>, a group from France whose 
parents were mainly American, and who named themselves after the hero in 
Kerouac's On the Road. They sound like they belong down a dirt track way off 
any US interstate, mining the blues and old time rock'n'roll, with singer 
Rosemary Standley looking quite the part; but there were sharp twists too, such 
as a quirky cover of Depeche Mode's Enjoy the Silence.

Bogota's LA-33 also impressed on the main stage, although for someone who's 
not the biggest salsa fan, just as entertaining was what I caught of their 
apperance at the Taste the World stage, where acts brave enough appear to cook 
a dish from their native country. I'll try and report properly on some more 
culinary action from there tomorrow (the Savoy Family Cajun Band sound 
appetising).

Then there was Antibalas <http://www.antibalas.com/>, the Brooklyn-based 
afrobeat outfit, who as mentioned previously suffered the death of singer 
Amayo's mother in Nigeria yesterday; he dedicated their performance to her and 
to mothers everywhere, and they blasted their way through the late afternoon in 
uplifting fashion. And also I really liked the crazed tarantellas of what I saw 
of Nidi D'Arac.

The talk of the festival so far has, however, probably been the Compagnie Luc 
Amoros's “Blank Page”, a piece of performance art set to music on Stage 3 over 
the course of three nights. It involves six young artists working from a 
10-metre high stage that is clad in clear perspex panels, which they then paint 
over throughout the course of an hour, changing the imagery; think Rolf Harris, 
only artier. And in fact, while some of the political messaging struck a 
slightly gauche chord, it was captivating, and the results – particularly the 
climax, when they conjured a Gauguin image – memorable.

Best, though, was Masekela <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Masekela>, who 
completely enchanted the vast crowd basking before him on the main stage. He 
knows how to entertain – busting some dance moves, playing famous songs like 
Stimela, talking about the environment ("Let's make a resolution that when we 
see someone shitting on nature, we're going to say 'get off the pot!'" – but 
when he blows softly on his horn, it's something else again.

“Not too bad for a boy from a shebeen,” he said at one point, talking about 
his career and the distance it stretches from the township in South Africa in 
which he was born in 1939 – and it's a phrase that might have served notice on 
his performance tonight. But better yet was at the very end, when the compere 
urged further applause for a real legend, and the 73-year old, already off 
stage but stilled mic-ed up, yelled back: “No one's a legend!”

Day 2 of WOMADelaide began with a talk from Hugh Masekela at the Speakers 
Corner stage. This isCaspar Llewellyn Smith again.

I'd actually bumped into the 73-year old last night, and asked whether he'd 
ever metArchie Shepp <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Shepp>, the radical 
late 60s saxophonist, simply because I've been listening to his oeuvre 
recently. And of course Masekela had: “I knew Archie well … I never liked his 
music.” That led to a discussion about his close friend Miles Davis, which 
included a great Miles impersonation and the view that Miles lost the plot when 
he ventured into that Sly Stone/ Stockhausen thing of his in the early 70s. “I 
told him I'd come see him play again when he started playing music again.”

On this Saturday morning, in a front of a crowd desperately fanning themselves 
in the sticky heat, he was at it again, a little bit, casually mentioning his 
friendship with Bob Marley, for instance. But he can't help it if he's known 
and worked with several of the greats, because he is one himself, and a measure 
of that was his insistence here, talking of politics, that “the ordinary person 
is the hero of every society. In a place like South Africa, the real heroes are 
the unknown people”.

It was also a delight to hear Masekela talk about the importance to him of his 
school geography lessons: “we learnt how to draw the outline of every country, 
their physical features .. their products, their climate” etc, which, he 
complained doesn't happen any more It meant that when he left South Africa 
after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 and started his peripatetic existence 
that continues to this day – he has homes in South Africa, Ghana and 
California, though as he told me “I live in airports and hotels and festivals” 
- nowhere he went felt foreign to him.

“I don't recognise borders,” he told the audience, but talked about the vital 
cultural traditions of Africa. “If there were no Africans in America, it 
wouldn't be the place it is today – they'd still be wearing white wigs. Without 
Louis Armstrong, they'd still be walking straight, without a dip in their hip.” 
(Masekela, of course, once knew Armstrong too.)

Right, now for more music, and perhaps something to eat – a measure of how 
civilised Womadelaide can be is pictured …

We've just posted a couple more pieces. First, Claire Armitstead gets the 
story behind Barrio 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/09/adelaide-festival-2013-circus>, 
the after-hours place where the festival lets its hair down, feasts in the 
Naughty Corner - and sometimes handles large insects.

Second, Jane Howard reviews What the Body Does Not Remember 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/09/what-the-body-does-not-remember>
, the Australian debut of a seminal dance piece by the Belgian choreographer 
Wim Vandekeybus.

I'm afraid I can't endorse the comment by JJRichardson on my 2001 review 
<http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/21840373> that said 'In 
eight years it will be 2001 in Adelaide', but it did make me laugh.

This morning I read an interesting interview (which isn't online) with David 
Sefton, the Adelaide festival's director, in local paper The Advertiser. 
There's a good anecdote:

On arrival, Sefton admitted he is constantly having to explain the difference 
between the Fringe and the Festival. He once explained to a confused soul that 
only one of the Fringe or the Festival would have Puppetry of the Penis on the 
program. The reply was, "You have that on at the Festival?"

Speaking on the fringe, my plan is to explore it over the next couple of 
nights, so if you have any tips, please post them here or tweet@alexneedham74 
<https://twitter.com/alexneedham74>. Might this be a good place to start?

This is Alex Needham on a rainy Saturday morning in Adelaide. Yesterday was 
spent getting my bearings and also watching 2001: A Space Odyssey with the 
Adelaide symphony orchestra. It's about 20 years since I last saw it, and that 
was on TV. To see it on a big screen with a live orchestra was an overwhelming 
experiencewhich I've reviewed here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/mar/09/2001-space-odyssey>.

I also interviewed two of my fellow cinemagoers about the experience on film 
which will hopefully be live soon. One of them, Adelaide native Stephen, shared 
his theory about the film's famously enigmatic end. He believes that at the end 
(SPOILER ALERT) Dave is reborn as master of the universe.

The rest of the day was spent getting my bearings and also watching a bit of 
Womadelaide, which my colleagues Caspar Llewellyn Smith and Alicia Canter are 
covering in detail over the next few days. The festival takes place in the 
splendid surroundings of the Botanical Gardens.

Late in the evening I saw the Alim Quasimov Ensemble play, led by the 
Azerbaijani devotional singer acclaimed as one of the world's great voices. He 
certainly made an extraordinary sound - it felt like something completely 
ageless, that could have been heard at any point over the past centuries. I had 
to tear myself away.

3.01pm GMT 

Hi, this is Caspar Llewellyn Smith, and I'm in Adelaide for the coming week 
with my colleagues Alex Needham and Alicia Canter to report on the Adelaide 
festival, the fringe festival and, first of all,WOMADelaide 
<http://www.womadelaide.com.au/> – the world's festival, as it bills itself.

The gates of the beautiful Botanic Park opened for Womadelaide at 4pm on this 
Friday afternoon, and two hours later, as the day began to cool – it's been a 
really sticky one – the music began.

As mentioned at the end of our live-ish blog that covered all the action up to 
this point 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2013/feb/28/adelaide-festival-2013-live-blog>
, there had been a media briefing earlier in the day that began with a 
performance fromStevie Goldsmith <http://womad.org/artists/stevie-goldsmith/>, 
an Adelaide native whose roots in this country go way, way, back, a figure of 
great charisma who's been keeping the culture of theKaurna people 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaurna_people> alive through performances with 
his dance groups. They were back on stage to open the festival proper as it 
celebrates its 21st birthday, garnering cheers from the crowd beginning to 
gather and spread themselves out on picnic blankets when he talked of 
representing the oldest living cultures in the world. Stirring stuff, and 
Stevie seemed a lovely fellow when we chatted briefly afterwards, too, telling 
me about the progress that's been made in reviving the language and traditions 
of his people over the course of the last decade.

They were followed on stage for a full hour's set by the Alaev Family 
<http://alaevfamily.com/>, whose apperance here has been criticised by the 
anti-Israeli Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions group 
<http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/festivals/womadelaide-set-to-draw-record-audience-at-botanic-park/story-e6free1u-1226591012717>
 - because while the band's roots are in Tajikistan, for two decades they've 
lived in Israel. How to answer that? With a rousing performance, the clarinet, 
violin and accordion weaving melodies over the top of two drum kits and an 
electric bassist, and the audience at this earliest stage of proceedings 
lustily joining in with some call-and-response encouragement.

If there was a theme to the day, perhaps it lay in the idea of family, because 
following the multi-generational Alaev gang on the main stage wasBassekou 
Kouyaté <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/bassekou-kouyate>, with his equally 
splendidly-robed band.

Bassekou is one of a number of stellar talents from Mali to be playing the 
festival this year (and seems likely to join the likes of Rokia Traore at 
Glastonbury in the UK in June, too). His group involves his wife Amy Sacko, a 
stunningly powerful singer, one of his nephews and his two sons. One of them, 
Mustapha, took a turn in the spotlight with a song on the ngoni of his own, but 
the look on his face on the next number when his old man returned to the stage 
and let rip (making liberal use of his wah-wah pedal) was something else: a 
puff of the cheeks that said, jeez, I've got a ways to go yet.

Before then I glimpsed the Tallest Man On Earth, aka feted Swedish 
singer-songwriter Kristian Matsson, who covered Paul Simon's Graceland, which 
perhaps he thought was mandatory at a world music gig (though he did it rather 
beautifully); he is not of course particularly tall, but I am, so the fact he 
drew a pretty big crowd on stage 3 didn't bother me, craning to see from the 
back. On another small stage, the Zoo Stage (I've not worked out yet if the zoo 
is actually open during the festival), Scottish folk trio Lau held the 
attention of a decent throng as the sky turned tar black. It was just a shame 
that they had to compete with the evening's main attraction,the Cat Empire 
<http://thecatempire.com/>, back on the main stage.

If Stevie Goldsmith represents a tradition that is several millennia old, the 
Melbourne band with their kitchen-sink appropriation of genres from around the 
world – hip hop, reggae, Latin styles – may well stand for the future; perhaps 
as a visitor to these shores, it's churlish to say they weren't particularly my 
cuppa, but the vast audience drank them in.

Tell me if I'm wrong. And please don't think I'm not extremely happy to be at 
a festival where it turns out you really don't need to bother with any 
Wellington boots.

Tomorrow brings Hugh Masekela; another Malian act, Vieux Farka Toure; oud 
player Dhafer Youssef; the Brooklyn-based afrobeat band Antibalas (a sad note: 
they received the terrible news that the mother of one of the band members died 
yesterday in Lagos), a chance to catch Lau again, properly this time – and lots 
more.

I'll be around on @CasparLS <https://twitter.com/CasparLS>, while Alex Needham 
plans to go scouting the Adelaide fringe festival action.
