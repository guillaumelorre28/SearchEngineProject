Alastair Cook <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook> has been 
awarded the freedom of the City of London following his exploits in England's 
Ashes win over Australia.

The ancient honour is given to those who have made an outstanding contribution 
to London life or to reward a significant achievement, and the award has 
previously been given to England's Test captain, Andrew Strauss.

Cook said: "I am greatly honoured and privileged to be given the freedom of 
London for doing something I love â€¦ beating the Aussies."

The award was first bestowed in 1237 and originally gave recipients special 
privileges, such as avoiding arrest if found intoxicated by police. Nowadays, 
it is a more symbolic gesture.

The Essex batsman was named the man of the series in the Ashes after scoring 
766 runs in five Tests.
