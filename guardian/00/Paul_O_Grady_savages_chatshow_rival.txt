Scousers are known for their sense of humour, but Paul O'Grady seems to have 
mislaid his somewhere. The comedian (!) and chatshow host has come out all guns 
blazing over what he claims is the theft of his show's format by that 
arch-villain …Alan Titchmarsh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/alan-titchmarsh>. The Daily Star 
reports that O'Grady was livid over the callous copying of his programme: "When 
he first started doing his show, it was our set. Even our hideous topiary, 
which I hated, was nicked." And Alan, henceforth known as Dr Evil, wasn't the 
only one to spark Paul's ire. The bread and butter of every chatshow, the 
guests, got a right old broadside. "They talk bollocks, basically. And they 
moan. If I was being paid £15m, I would shag a donkey." Puts a whole new 
perspective on his recent series For the Love of Dogs, doesn't it?
