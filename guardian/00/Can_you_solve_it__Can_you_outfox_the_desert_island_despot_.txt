Hello guzzlers,

Last week I was thrilled to win the 2016 science blog award from the 
Association of British Science Writers forAdventures in Numberland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland>, which is 
part of the Guardian’s science blog network. I wrote my first mathematical 
puzzles on that blog, which led me to start this one, dedicated to puzzles. 
Thanks so much for reading - and commenting on - both blogs, please continue to 
do so!

Ok, that’s enough about me. To today’s puzzle:

You and a friend have been captured on a desert island ruled by a crazed 
mathematical despot.


You will be locked in separate cells in the island’s prison, and then set the 
following task:

Every minute for an hour you will each flip a coin. The flips are 
simultaneous, and after each flip you will make a prediction as to whether the 
other person’s flip was heads or tails.

So, you both make 60 flips and 60 predictions. 

The despot rules that he will kill the two of you if on any one of the 60 
predictions you areboth correct. (In other words, you both flip, both predict 
the result of the other person’s flip, and are both right). To escape with your 
lives at least one of you must predict wrongly each time.

You are given ten minutes to think up a survival strategy before being taken 
to the cells. Once you are in the cells you cannot communicate with each other, 
although you are obviously able to see the results of your own flips.

Can you guarantee your survival, and if so, how?

I’ll be back at 5pm BST with the solution. Please, NO SPOILERS until then! 

A version of today’s puzzle was originally a Maths Item of the Month on the 
Mathematics in Education and Industry website <http://www.mei.org.uk/>. Thanks 
to Tom Button of the MEI for suggesting it. MEI is a charity that helps improve 
maths education and its links with industry. You’ll find lots of resources for 
teachers and students on itswebsite <http://www.mei.org.uk/>.
