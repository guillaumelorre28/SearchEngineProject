Horner was hired for the second Star Trek movie after Jerry Goldsmith, who had 
scored Star Trek: The Motion Picture, had become too expensive. Horner reworked 
the classicStar Trek <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/star-trek> TV series 
fanfare (written by Alexander Courage) for the opening theme.

Horner described working for James Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamescameron> on the Alien follow-up as a 
“nightmare” – when he arrived at Abbey Road studios, in London, to work on the 
score, the picture was not finished, Cameron spent days tweaking sound effects, 
and the producers refused to delay the schedule to allow Horner to write a 
score to his own satisfaction. However, the result ended in Horner’s first 
Oscar nomination – which he lost to Herbie Hancock for Round Midnight.

Horner was also nominated for best song in the same year, for this little 
ditty Somewhere Out There from the cartoon An American Tail. Horner did a lot 
of work on kiddie material produced bySteven Spielberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/stevenspielberg>, including Casper, Batteries 
Not Included, and The Land Before Time.

Another Oscar nomination followed Horner’s score for the mystical baseball 
movie starringKevin Costner <https://www.theguardian.com/film/kevin-costner>. 
Rather than produce a sweeping orchestral score, Horner went down the 
soundscape route, linking atmospheric fragments together to create a brooding, 
ghostly backing.

Horner liked to feature Celtic motifs in his scores, and Mel Gibson’s 
Braveheart gave him ample opportunity. Here is the undeniably stirring Sons of 
Scotland speech, with Horner’s booming melody underscoring Gibson’s hoarse 
encouragement of the troops.

The big one. Not only did Titanic <https://www.theguardian.com/film/titanic> 
win Horner his best original score Oscar, he also scooped one for best song for 
My Heart Will Go On, and the complete soundtrack became one of the all-time 
biggest sellers. He always says he was surprised to have been invited back by 
Cameron after the difficulties he had experienced on Aliens, and he looks 
delighted by the outcome on Oscar night, as seen in the clip below.

Horner wasn’t just about big scale bombast: he could work on miniatures too, 
as his credit on the Richard Eyre directed Iris showed. Though it’s hardly his 
most attention-grabbing score, Iris has plangent music moments that build on 
the restrained emotion of the scenes.

Horner was arguably at his best souping up potentially clunky sequences: here 
he puts a lot of drums to work behind a face-off betweenBrad Pitt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt> and Eric Bana in the Wolfgang 
Petersen-directed Troy (when such films were fashionable). Impressive stuff.

Horner returned to work with Cameron on the 3D blockbuster Avatar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/avatar>, which resulted in overtaking Titanic 
at the box office. Horner called it the “most difficult” job he ever undertook, 
with its mix of high action and ethnological research.

Horner was more than equal to the demands of the modern superhero movie: 
here’s his dramatic accompaniment to The Amazing Spider-Man: including a clever 
moment of silence when it looks like Spidey may have gone over the side of a 
building, and isn’t coming back.

Below is an extended 2010 interview Horner did for the DP/30 video blog.
