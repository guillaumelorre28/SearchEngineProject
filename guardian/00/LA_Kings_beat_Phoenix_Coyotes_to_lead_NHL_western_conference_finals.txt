Dwight King scored his second goal of the game into an empty net as the Los 
Angeles Kings <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/los-angeles-kings> opened the 
Western Conference finals with a 4-2 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on Sunday 
to remain unbeaten on the road in the playoffs.

The Kings dominated early despite a week off and outshot Phoenix 48-27.

Anze Kopitar scored 4 minutes in, Dustin Brown had a goal and an assist, and 
King had his first career two-goal game to give the Kings their sixth straight 
road victory of the playoffs.

Derek Morris beat Jonathan Quick from the center line, and Mikkel Boedker also 
scored for the Coyotes, who trail in a series for the first time this year.

Game 2 is Tuesday night in the desert.

This was the Western Conference finals few expected.

The Coyotes weren't picked to even make the playoffs, entering the season with 
an unproven No. 1 goalie and no owner for the third straight year.

Grinding and relying on Mike Smith's breakout season in goal, the Coyotes won 
their first division title as anNHL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nhl> 
franchise and beat Chicago and Nashville, two supposedly better teams, in the 
first two rounds to make their inaugural appearance in the conference finals.

Game 1 was certainly testy, with multiple scrums, hard hits and a roughing 
penalty on a goalie (Smith) in the first period a trend that continued 
throughout the game.
