Andrew Flintoff has called on the country to lay off the Test captain Alastair 
Cook and said that Kevin Pietersen will have to state hiscase for an England 
recall by making runs for Surrey

Cook is at a low ebb as his quest for a long overdue Test century, to add to 
his record 25, brought himtwo more failures at the top of the order

in the opening match of England’s series in the West Indies. Nevertheless, he 
has a supporter in his former England team-mate and fellow 2009 Ashes-winner 
Flintoff.

“I get fed up of people having a go at Alastair Cook,” said Flintoff, speaking 
at the T20 Blast launch. “I was captain when Alastair came into the side. I got 
a lot of things wrong as England captain, but the one thing I got right was 
pickingAlastair Cook <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook>.

“He’s one of England’s finest-ever players. If you have a career spanning more 
than 100 Test matches, there are going to be blips along the way.

“But Alastair will get through this. I’d like to see people outside the 
England team backing the lad. It’s nice some time when you get a bit of loving 
from people, and I think that’s the only thing that’s missing with Alastair at 
the minute.”

After his sacking last year another of Flintoff’s former England colleagues, 
the 34-year-old Pietersen, is hoping a welter of first-class runs for Surrey 
can pave the way to a Test return this Ashes summer.

Flintoff said: “He wants to play Test cricket again, but he’s going to have to 
state his case. You can’t just walk into a side – there are lads, especially in 
the batting order, in possession of places and performing.”
