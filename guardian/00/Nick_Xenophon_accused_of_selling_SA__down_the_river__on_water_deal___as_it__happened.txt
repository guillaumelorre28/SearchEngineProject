Night-time politics

Today:

 * Malcolm Turnbull and George Brandis appointed high court justice Susan 
Kiefel as Australia’s first chief justice. Justice James Edelman has been 
appointed to the high court at 42.

 * George Brandis will be the subject of a Senate references inquiry over any 
agreements between the commonwealth and the WA government regarding the Bell 
litigation – winding up the Bell Group. At issue is whether there was any 
agreement between the federal and state Coalition governments to favour the 
state as a creditor. Labor and the Greens managed to split off One Nation 
senator Rod Culleton to vote for the inquiry – no fan of Brandis since he was 
referred to the court of disputed returns. Turnbull has expressed his full 
confidence in Brandis (as rumours of a reshuffle persist). But then Turnbull 
had full confidence in former ministers Jamie Briggs and Mal Brough before they 
were dumped.

 * Nick Xenophon has done a deal on water which he says is good for South 
Australia. It means the first ministers (prime minister and premiers) will talk 
about the Murray Darling Basin plan at Coag twice a year but it does not 
guarantee any more water down the river. Labor and the Greens say the deal is a 
shocker and just an excuse for Xenophon to vote for the ABCC. Which Xen says is 
more likely now – better than 50-50 chance. He still wants amendments, such as 
security of payments for subcontractors.

 * Labor and the Greens won a marriage equality Senate committee hearing 
inquiry. 
 * The passenger movement charge and 15% backpacker tax bills got through the 
lower house. 
 * The Australian Building and Construction Commission bill is still being 
debated in the Senate. Nick Xenophon says he expects another 24 hours before 
resolution on that one.

Thanks to the brains trust, Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine Murphy. 
Thanks toMike Bowers for his pictures. I will leave you with a pic from the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> party room 
meeting this morning, including senator Ian Macdonald, whose phone rang with a 
Vivaldi ringtone right in the middle of Turnbull’s speech.

Leaker! they yelled and pointed.

The Senate passed a motion to order Barnaby Joyce to produce documents related 
to moving the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) 
to his own electorate.

The vote passed 36 Ayes and 28 Noes.

The order states that the following documents held or prepared by the 
Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and/or the Australian Pesticides 
and Veterinary Medicines Authority be tabled no later than 9.30am on Thursday, 
1 December 2016 by the minister representing the minister for agriculture and 
water resources:

 * An analysis of supply (and demand) for regulatory scientists

 * An analysis of connectivity between APVMA business groups

 * Any APVMA recruitment, retention and training strategies

 * Any APVMA transition plans.

While it may sound good, the reality is that politicians ignore these things 
all the time. In the past, oppositions and minor parties have tried to get 
documents relating to detention centres, trade agreements and other matters. 
None ever showed up.

Labor’s Anthony Albanese has moved a suspension of standing orders. He does 
not want the bill to increase the passenger movement charge by $5 to bind 
future parliaments. This is the PMC freeze negotiated byPauline Hanson. The 
bill was one of the savings measures attached to the backpacker tax.

South Australian senator Penny Wong accuses Nick Xenophon of finding an excuse 
to vote for the ABCC bill.

I don’t see having a couple of extra estimates rounds will fix this 
up....anyone looking at this would suggest that Nick was looking for an excuse.

South Australian senator Sarah Hanson-Young says Xenophon has squibbed it on 
the water deal with the PM.

Nick Xenophon has just sold South Australia down the river. He’s letting South 
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> and the 
River Murray down, just so he can cosy up to the Coalition and help them to rip 
rights away from hard working Australians. Senator Xenophon might talk a big 
game, but time and time again he squibs it in the end. Now he’s doing it all 
again and selling our home state short.

Nick Xenophon is asked about accusations from the National party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party>.

He urges calm and says no state can walk away from the plan.

The deal puts the Murray Darling Basin plan implementation into the hands of 
the first ministers – that is the prime minister and the premiers through the 
Council of Australian Governments (Coag) plan.

I am checking but this would appear to take water out of the hands of state 
water ministers – and out ofBarnaby Joyce’s hands.

Nick Xenophon says he is not being fobbed off. He believes extra water will 
flow toSouth Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia>. And he can now 
turn his attention to the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill.

What it means in relation to a vote on the ABCC, we can now consider the ABCC 
legislation on its merits and there are issues we are working through in 
relation with the government.

He says the ABCC bill probably will not be dealt with until Wednesday night or 
Thursday.

We should see some amendments soon.

Nick Xenophon is holding a press conference now regarding the promises he 
extracted from government. The major factors of this deal relate to 
accountability processes.

Someone asks, there is no extra money for South Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia>?

Xenophon says there is still $1.78bn on the table for the extra 450GL that is 
at issue.

The money will not be taken away and the money needs to be spent in an orderly 
process and that orderly process is listening to the scientists and ensuring 
that there is political will to drive this forward. The fact that it is now, 
ahead of COAG, year after year, so the plan can be implemented, is a 
significant breakthrough.

Nick Xenophon reaches a deal on water IN WRITING

The full statement from Xenophon:

In the past few days I have been involved in extensive discussions with prime 
minister Malcolm Turnbull and South Australian premier Jay Weatherill, in 
respect to the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin plan and the 
adherence to the 2013 Intergovernmental Agreement between the Basin States and 
the Commonwealth.

I have done so in close consultation with my colleagues Senators Griff and 
Kakoschke-Moore and particularly the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP. I 
also note that there have been extensive discussions between the prime minister 
and Premier Weatherill.

Today I have been copied in to a letter from the prime minister to the premier 
and other basin state members.

In light of that letter, and as a result of discussions with Premier 
Weatherill and with the prime minister today, I consider there is now a much 
better process in place to ensure implementation of the plan.

Elevating the implementation of the plan to first minister’s Level at Coag 
twice a yearand ensuring, for the first time, a separate and comprehensive 
cross-portfolio Senate estimates process twice a year, are two significant 
accountability measures.

Obviously, given the nature of the plan, its longitudinal scope, the funds and 
projects involved,there is a need for ongoing vigilance and commitment to its 
implementation.

Together with my Senate colleagues and particularly Rebekha Sharkie MP, I am 
committed to working constructively with the prime minister and Premier 
Weatherill and all basin states to ensure the plan is successfully and fairly 
implemented.

Marriage equality senate committee in the wind

Paul Karp

Labor, the Greens, the Nick Xenophon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon> Team and senator 
Derryn Hinchannounced on Tuesday they will combine to refer the government’s 
exposure draft for changes to the Marriage Act to legalise same-sex marriage to 
a Senate select committee.

The draft was released by attorney general George Brandis before the 
plebiscite bill was voted down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/discrimination-law-changes-would-entrench-second-tier-status-for-same-sex-weddings>
 and the government has not introduced it to the lower house.


It’s time for us to have a look together as a parliament about what the 
community is prepared to accept and what we as parliamentarians prepared to 
look at to find a way forward,” Labor senatorLouise Pratt explained.

Greens leader Richard Di Natale, Hinch and NXT’s Skye Kakoschke-Moore all 
stressed the committee process was a way to keep the issue of marriage equality 
on the agenda.

Labor and the Greens have both expressed concerns with the exposure draft, 
particularly about exemptions for civil celebrants and religious organisations 
(rather than just ministers of religion) to refuse gay weddings.

Asked whether the inquiry might expose the differences between what the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> and others 
will accept rather than heal the rift, Pratt said she would not prejudge the 
outcome of the inquiry but hoped it would “take the heat out of the issue” to 
find an acceptable bill.


Labor’s equality spokeswoman Terri Butler stressed the committee would have 
four government and four non-government members, and was therefore “built for 
consensus”.

Today:

 * Malcolm Turnbull and George Brandis appointed high court justice Susan 
Kiefel as Australia’s first chief justice. Justice James Edelman has been 
appointed to the high court at 42.

 * George Brandis will be the subject of a Senate references inquiry over any 
agreements between the commonwealth and the WA government regarding the Bell 
litigation – winding up the Bell Group. At issue is whether there was any 
agreement between the federal and state Coalition governments to favour the 
state as a creditor. Labor and the Greens managed to split off One Nation 
senator Rod Culleton to vote for the inquiry – no fan of Brandis since he was 
referred to the court of disputed returns. Turnbull has expressed his full 
confidence in Brandis (as rumours of a reshuffle persist). But then Turnbull 
had full confidence in former ministers Jamie Briggs and Mal Brough before they 
were dumped.

 * Nick Xenophon has done a deal on water which he says is good for South 
Australia. It means the first ministers (prime minister and premiers) will talk 
about the Murray Darling Basin plan at Coag twice a year but it does not 
guarantee any more water down the river. Labor and the Greens say the deal is a 
shocker and just an excuse for Xenophon to vote for the ABCC. Which Xen says is 
more likely now – better than 50-50 chance. He still wants amendments, such as 
security of payments for subcontractors.

 * Labor and the Greens won a marriage equality Senate committee hearing 
inquiry. 
 * The passenger movement charge and 15% backpacker tax bills got through the 
lower house. 
 * The Australian Building and Construction Commission bill is still being 
debated in the Senate. Nick Xenophon says he expects another 24 hours before 
resolution on that one.

Thanks to the brains trust, Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine Murphy. 
Thanks toMike Bowers for his pictures. I will leave you with a pic from the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> party room 
meeting this morning, including senator Ian Macdonald, whose phone rang with a 
Vivaldi ringtone right in the middle of Turnbull’s speech.

Leaker! they yelled and pointed.

Good night.
 
The Senate passed a motion to order Barnaby Joyce to produce documents related 
to moving the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) 
to his own electorate.

The vote passed 36 Ayes and 28 Noes.

The order states that the following documents held or prepared by the 
Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and/or the Australian Pesticides 
and Veterinary Medicines Authority be tabled no later than 9.30am on Thursday, 
1 December 2016 by the minister representing the minister for agriculture and 
water resources:

 * An analysis of supply (and demand) for regulatory scientists

 * An analysis of connectivity between APVMA business groups

 * Any APVMA recruitment, retention and training strategies

 * Any APVMA transition plans.

While it may sound good, the reality is that politicians ignore these things 
all the time. In the past, oppositions and minor parties have tried to get 
documents relating to detention centres, trade agreements and other matters. 
None ever showed up.
 
I missed this earlier. (I keep falling off the One Nation mailing list.)

Labor’s Anthony Albanese has moved a suspension of standing orders. He does 
not want the bill to increase the passenger movement charge by $5 to bind 
future parliaments. This is the PMC freeze negotiated byPauline Hanson. The 
bill was one of the savings measures attached to the backpacker tax.
 
South Australian senator Penny Wong accuses Nick Xenophon of finding an excuse 
to vote for the ABCC bill.

I don’t see having a couple of extra estimates rounds will fix this 
up....anyone looking at this would suggest that Nick was looking for an excuse.

South Australian senator Sarah Hanson-Young says Xenophon has squibbed it on 
the water deal with the PM.

Nick Xenophon has just sold South Australia down the river. He’s letting South 
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> and the 
River Murray down, just so he can cosy up to the Coalition and help them to rip 
rights away from hard working Australians. Senator Xenophon might talk a big 
game, but time and time again he squibs it in the end. Now he’s doing it all 
again and selling our home state short.
 
Nick Xenophon is asked about accusations from the National party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party>.

He urges calm and says no state can walk away from the plan.

The deal puts the Murray Darling Basin plan implementation into the hands of 
the first ministers – that is the prime minister and the premiers through the 
Council of Australian Governments (Coag) plan.

I am checking but this would appear to take water out of the hands of state 
water ministers – and out ofBarnaby Joyce’s hands.
 
Nick Xenophon says he is not being fobbed off. He believes extra water will 
flow toSouth Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia>. And he can now 
turn his attention to the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill.

What it means in relation to a vote on the ABCC, we can now consider the ABCC 
legislation on its merits and there are issues we are working through in 
relation with the government.

He says the ABCC bill probably will not be dealt with until Wednesday night or 
Thursday.

We should see some amendments soon.
 
Nick Xenophon is holding a press conference now regarding the promises he 
extracted from government. The major factors of this deal relate to 
accountability processes.

Someone asks, there is no extra money for South Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia>?

Xenophon says there is still $1.78bn on the table for the extra 450GL that is 
at issue.

The money will not be taken away and the money needs to be spent in an orderly 
process and that orderly process is listening to the scientists and ensuring 
that there is political will to drive this forward. The fact that it is now, 
ahead of COAG, year after year, so the plan can be implemented, is a 
significant breakthrough.

This is the full terms of the George Brandis inquiry successfully moved by 
senatorsWatt and McKim.

To move:

That the following matter be referred to the legal and constitutional affairs 
references committee for inquiry and report by 21 March 2017:

(1) The nature and scope of any agreement reached by the commonwealth and 
Western Australian governments in relation to the distribution of proceeds of 
the liquidation of, and litigation concerning, the Bell Group of companies (the 
proceeds), with particular reference to:

(a) the priority order for distribution of the proceeds;

(b) the commonwealth’s position in relation to the distribution of, and 
litigation concerning, the proceeds;

(c) any connection between the above and the settlement of other disputes 
between the commonwealth and Western Australian governments, including 
regarding the distribution of GST revenue between the states;

(d) any direction or instruction given by the attorney general to the 
solicitor general, either directly or through his office or department, in 
relation to the conduct of litigation concerning the proceeds;

(e) any connection between the above and the issuing of the legal services 
amendment (solicitor general opinions) direction; and

(f) any other related matter.

(2) That the Senate directs the attorney general (Senator Brandis) and the m
inister for finance (Senator Cormann)to appear before the committee to answer 
questions
 
The full statement from Xenophon:

In the past few days I have been involved in extensive discussions with prime 
minister Malcolm Turnbull and South Australian premier Jay Weatherill, in 
respect to the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin plan and the 
adherence to the 2013 Intergovernmental Agreement between the Basin States and 
the Commonwealth.

I have done so in close consultation with my colleagues Senators Griff and 
Kakoschke-Moore and particularly the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP. I 
also note that there have been extensive discussions between the prime minister 
and Premier Weatherill.

Today I have been copied in to a letter from the prime minister to the premier 
and other basin state members.

In light of that letter, and as a result of discussions with Premier 
Weatherill and with the prime minister today, I consider there is now a much 
better process in place to ensure implementation of the plan.

Elevating the implementation of the plan to first minister’s Level at Coag 
twice a yearand ensuring, for the first time, a separate and comprehensive 
cross-portfolio Senate estimates process twice a year, are two significant 
accountability measures.

Obviously, given the nature of the plan, its longitudinal scope, the funds and 
projects involved,there is a need for ongoing vigilance and commitment to its 
implementation.

Together with my Senate colleagues and particularly Rebekha Sharkie MP, I am 
committed to working constructively with the prime minister and Premier 
Weatherill and all basin states to ensure the plan is successfully and fairly 
implemented.
