Michael Vaughan is unlikely to get another crack at Australia in October's ICC 
Super Series despite leading the first team to beat them in a Test series since 
2001.

The England captain was overlooked for the initial 13-man squad but was in 
contention if Sachin Tendulkar's elbow injury necessitated a replacement. 
However, the India batsman, who underwent surgery in May, is confident that he 
can declare his fitness to the Rest of the World's chairman of selectors Sunil 
Gavaskar by next Wednesday, the deadline set by the organisers, and even if he 
is not fit Pakistan's captain Inzamam-ul-Haq is in line to step in.

Coming after the failure of the ICC panel to shortlist any England player for 
the Test player of the year award to be presented on October 11, Vaughan's 
exclusion could be interpreted as a further snub to England. His personal form, 
however, has been less impressive than his captaincy in recent months and he 
averages only 34.48 in 15 matches stretching back to July 29 2004. Inzamam has 
an average of 65.54 and has scored three hundreds in the same period. The 
six-day Super Test will be held at the SydneyCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Ground starting on October 14.

Herschelle Gibbs has withdrawn from the Rest of the World squad to challenge 
the world champions Australia in the Super Series of one-day matches at 
Melbourne's Telstra Dome on October 5, 7 and 9. The opening batsman revealed 
that an injury to his right knee sustained on South Africa's tour of the West 
Indies in April had been aggravated while playing for the English club Lashings 
and had ruled him out.
