Years before Sub Pop was the label that helped codify grunge rock, as we would 
come to love (and later, hate) it, there was Sub Pop 100. The label's first 
offering was a survey of the gnashing sounds of the mid-80s underground with 
tracks from the likes of Scratch Acid andSonic Youth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth>. On the LP's spine was printed 
a sarcastic quip: "SUB POP: the new thing: the big thing: the God thing: a 
mighty multinational entertainment conglomerate based in the Pacific 
Northwest". If it was a prophecy, it came true a few years later when Sub Pop 
became the de facto home of grunge.
