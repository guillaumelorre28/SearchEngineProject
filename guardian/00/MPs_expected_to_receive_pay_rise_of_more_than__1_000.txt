MPs are expected to receive a 1.4% pay rise worth more than £1,000 in April 
next year, taking their salaries to £76,011.

Increases are based on the annual change in average weekly earnings across the 
public sector, which the Office for National Statistics calculated on Thursday 
at 1.4%.

The increase amount will be confirmed in February but is unlikely to change 
much by then, sources said. It follows a 1.3%rise this year

, which followed a big increase from £67,000 to £74,000.

The rise is much greater than that received by most public sector workers, who 
have been subject to austerity restrictions since 2010.

Responsibility for setting MPs’ pay was handed to the Independent 
Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) in an effort to defuse controversy. 
The watchdog recommended a significant increase despite the coalition 
government cutting spending and imposing austerity on the public sector.

An Ipsa spokesman said: “We will confirm the amount of any pay adjustment in 
February.”

MPs are facing fresh scrutiny over their earnings after the Commons standards 
commissioner hinted at new curbs on lucrative outside work. Some make large 
sums on top of their parliamentary pay from consultancies, legal work and even 
dentistry. Supporters argue that it allows them to keep in touch with the world 
outside of Westminster.

A review by the standards commissioner is looking at whether rules should be 
tightened to avoid conflicts of interest.

The Guardian disclosed last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/01/mps-may-be-told-to-curb-lucrative-second-jobs-in-new-code-of-conduct>
 that a member of the standards committee had suggested that restrictions 
should be imposed on second jobs.
