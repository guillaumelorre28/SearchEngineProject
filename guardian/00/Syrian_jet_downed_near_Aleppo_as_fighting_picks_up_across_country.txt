Syrian rebels have shot down a government fighter jet south of Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> as renewed fighting across swaths of 
the country threatened to upend a fragile truce.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels from the Nusra 
Front brought down the Sukhoi-22 on Tuesday in an area where the 
al-Qaida-affiliated fighters had come under heavy bombardment since they 
captured it this week. The Guardian could not confirm which rebel group brought 
down the plane.

Syria’s military said a plane on a reconnaissance mission had been shot down 
by a surface-to-air missile. The pilot had bailed out and efforts were under 
way to rescue him, it said.


Videos showed a ball of flame in the sky falling, and locals cheering: “God is 
great.”

The latest battles came days before peace talks under UN auspices and brokered 
by Moscow and Washington were set to resume in Geneva, and days after regime 
airstrikes killed at least 30 people in a Damascus suburb, one of the most 
serious violations of the “cessation of hostilities” agreement brokered in late 
February.

“The ceasefire is finished, it will return when judgment day arrives,” said 
one resident of Aleppo, Syria’s largest city where fighting raged throughout 
Monday night. “It’s disgusting, there’s shelling and bombing everywhere.”

Aleppo city was the scene of fresh fighting, with the opposition and 
government forces shelling neighbourhoods under each other’s control. Rebels 
also fought with Kurdish paramilitaries in the city. The countryside north of 
the city saw fighting between the opposition and Islamic State, where rebels 
have been attempting to score advances against the terror group, which is not 
covered by the ceasefire.

In southern Aleppo province, rebels including the Nusra Front seized al-Is, a 
town near the highway linking the city to Damascus.

A rebel coalition surged through northern Latakia, taking control of towns 
that had been retaken by the regime in the course of an offensive earlier this 
year backed by Russian airstrikes.

The widespread violence is the most serious threat so far to the ceasefire 
agreement, which has held despite sporadic outbreaks of fighting in the 
country. It appears to have been triggered by a number of factors. Assad regime 
airstrikes over the weekend in the Damascus suburb of Deir as-Safir killed 
scores of civilians and gave fuel to claims by the opposition that it had 
repeatedly violated the ceasefire.

The opposition’s negotiators said at a meeting with British officials 
<http://en.etilaf.org/all-news/news/syrian-coalition-assad-regime-not-serious-about-peace-negotiations.html>
 that the government’s “repeated” violations of the ceasefire were a threat to 
the whole political process, and also cited delays in the delivery of aid to 
besieged areas in Syria, a key provision of the deal.

Human Rights Watch said the government had blocked access 
<https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/04/syria-promised-aid-key-areas-blocked> to 
six out of 18 besieged locations around the country since the agreement came 
into effect.

An American airstrike on Sunday targeting a meeting of high-level Nusra 
officials 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-usa-idUKKCN0X11QM> 
killed the group’s spokesman, Abu Firas al-Suri, possibly spurring the group 
and its allies into launching their offensive. Nusra is not covered by the 
ceasefire.

During the ceasefire, the Assad regime had scored key victories against Isis, 
reclaiming the historic city of Palmyra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/27/syrian-regime-forces-retake-all-of-palmyra-from-isis>
 from the militants as well as the nearby town of al-Qaryatain, which has a 
significant Christian population, allowing it to better secure the road to 
Damascus and contributing to a sense that the government had seized the 
momentum in the war.

But the loss of territory in Latakia in particular highlighted its dependence 
on foreign patrons, failing to hold ground that was secured under intense 
Russian air cover. The Kremlin’s intervention last October allowed the regime 
to resist rebel encroachment in the coastal province, whose main cities have 
remained loyal to Assad.

“The regime, then, had experience battling Jabhat al-Nusra in that area and 
had a month to secure the village and the hilltop, but it failed to do so,”said 
Hassan Hassan 
<http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/rebel-gains-show-regimes-reliance-on-foreign-forces>
, a fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy and co-author of 
Isis: Inside the Army of Terror.


“With the help of Russian airstrikes, regime troops may ascend the hilltop, 
but the message should be clear: unlike the opposition that is fighting on 
multiple fronts, the regime army is still too weak to hold its ground, much 
less to take Aleppo or any other major areas without close air support from 
Russia.”
