Soros: Trump is doing the work of ISIS

Larry Elliott

George Soros then went on to launch an astonishing attack on Donald Trump, 
saying that he was doing “the work of Isis”.

He added: 

“By fearmongering he and (Ted) Cruz are doing the work of Isis.

They want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim 
community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim 
community into a breeding ground for Isis.

"Donald Trump is doing the work of ISIS," says George Soros in #Davos 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Davos?src=hash>. Says "the others, Cruz and so on" 
are as well.

Last month, Donald Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” on Muslims 
entering the US. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/dec/08/donald-trump-calls-for-complete-ban-on-muslims-entering-the-us-video>

This prompted a huge petition to have the businessman and presidential 
candidate banned from the UK, which MPs debated earlier this week. During the 
debate, Trump was labelled (among other things)a “ridiculous xenophobe”

Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the crisis worse by his bombing of

 “He wants the EU to collapse.”

Soros: Refugee panic is like a cinema fire

Soros then warned that European countries were in crisis, due to the number of 
people who have fled to the region:

“We have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of 
receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic.

It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.”
Tony Connelly (@tconnellyRTE) 
Soros: #WEF16 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF16?src=hash> Panic over refugees 
is like a cinema fire without emergency exits.

<https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/690264903433715715> 
Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further 
rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the ECB would ease policy in March, he 
predicted (as Mario Draghi hinted today).

Soros: EU in existential crisis over migration

Larry Elliott

George Soros, the billionaire financier turned philanthropist, has warned the 
World Economic Forum tonight that the migration crisis is putting the European 
Union in jeopardy.

Larry Elliott was at the event, and reports:

George Soros said:

“The EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration. The EU is 
falling apart.”

Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan, Soros said:

“Most people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put 
right.”

As we covered in this liveblog this morning, Germany’s finance minister 
WolfgangSchäuble has called for billions to be spent helping the troubled 
countries in the Middle East, to stem the flood of refugees into Europe.

Soros added that the same conditions were in place as caused the crisis in 
2008.

“There is a financial crisis and a bear market. The source of the 
disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub prime. Today it is China 
where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.”

The Greek government says the talks between Lagarde and Tsipras were “sincere” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/21/davos-2016-david-cameron-europe-brexit-greece-tsipras-imf-live#block-56a126d5e4b0edfdfaeb1318>
.

Helena Smith has the details:

The Greek government has just issued one of its famous briefing papers calling 
Tsipras’ talks with IMF chief Christine Lagarde “sincere.”

The Greek PM “underlined that time is a critical parameter for the successful 
conclusion of the Greek programme and the first evaluation [of the economy’s 
performance,]” the paper said.


Both agreed that from now on there should be “direct communication” between 
the Greek government and the IMF “so that each side has a clear view of the 
positions of the other,” it noted.

After saying it would be preferable if the IMF did not participate in Greece’s 
latest bailout, Athens reluctantly agreed last week to the Washington-based 
body remaining amongst the lenders.

IMF: Greece needs significant debt relief and reforms

Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has met with Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras> at the sidelines of the 
World Economic Forum.

It was a good meeting, one insider says.

And the IMF has now issued a statement, reiterating that Greece needs 
significant debt relief, as well as pension reforms which are causing such 
anger in Athens.

“The managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to 
support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public 
finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic program.

“Such a program would require strong economic policies, not least pension 
reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece’s European partners to 
ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.”

While Tsipras hits Davos, protests hits the streets of Athens

While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras> was addressing delegates in 
Davos earlier today, opposition against the policies his government is being 
forced to apply intensified as thousands took to the streets.

Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports from Athens. 

Opposition to the pension and tax measures set as the price of further bailout 
funds mounted today as thousands of protestors –mostly from the professions – 
joined farmers and fishermen and public sector unionists in denouncing the 
policies.

As Tsipras hob-nobbed in Davos, around 10,000 demonstrators took to the 
streets – following up farmer blockades that also expanded - in further 
evidence that after months (some might say years) of being relatively inactive, 
the protest movement is once again gaining steam.

For the most part, lawyers, doctors and engineers, many said they belonged to 
Greece’s vast sector of self-employed who stood to be hard hit by the reforms. 
“A lot of us here voted for the left and feel really betrayed,” Baltis 
Kapopoulos, an Athenian engineer, told me.

“It’s terrible that the left should be tainted by such policies,” he said in 
front of the Greek parliament, a placard emblazoned with the words ‘You won’t 
kick us out of the country’ above his head.

At 29, Kapopoulos said he had no desire to leave Greece but like many might be 
forced to by the measures. “If they go through, pensions will drop, 
contributions will soar and taxes will double. There’ll be a lot of black 
market work with no insurance. And it’ll be the end of small firms.”

 “I think the reason there has been such a delay in protest is because people 
have been shocked. We voted ‘no’ in the referendum [last July] and 48 hours 
later, Tsipras went and accepted everything,” he said of the leftist’s 
spectacular surrender to creditors’ demands under threat of Greece’s ejection 
from the euro zone. “Either we react now or we never will. It’s the last chance 
if we don’t want to be forced to leave our country.”

Felix Salmon, the sharp-as-a-very-sharp-tack financial columnist, has 
delivered his verdict on this year’s Davos.

And it’s a zinger, surpassing Felix’s earlier criticism of the annual shindig 
in the mountains.

He argues that the excitement and chatter behind the scenes about Donald Trump 
(the antithesis of the spirit of Davos), shows that WEF’s vision of an open, 
inclusive approach to solving the world’s problems is failing.

Especially as we seem to be collecting more problems, not fewer, from stock 
market turmoil and oil, to the Middle East.

Over to Felix:

This year, then, is proving itself to be the Davos of denial, the year that 
the disconnect between rhetoric and reality became more obvious than ever. The 
founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is on some level a 
plutocratic power-broker just like many other rich and powerful men, but his 
dream of bringing the world together in the service of peace and prosperity is, 
or was, a genuine one.

It has even been bought into by leftist critics 
<http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/01/17/davos-and-its-threat-democracy> 
who complain that Davos is “increasingly where global decisions are being taken 
and moreover is becoming the default form of global governance.”

The truth, however, is that with the exception of a few public-health 
initiatives, the Davos model of “multi-stakeholder initiatives” and “global 
redesign” has utterly failed in its stated aims. The grandiloquence is as lofty 
as ever, but the world has not come together; instead, it is fracturing, and 
the World Economic Forum’s manifold Leaders are reduced to the status of 
impotent spectators. Some men just want to watch the world burn; Davos Man 
wants nothing less. But, right now, that’s all he can realistically do.

European markets bounce back

Katie Allen

In the financial markets, ECB president Mario Draghi has provided some respite 
today with his assurances that the central bank will review policy in March - 
hinting fresh stimulus could come sooner than many investors had been expecting.

London’s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi’s 
remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart Mark 
Carney this week thatUK interest rates would stay at their record low 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/bank-of-england-mark-carney-rules-out-uk-interest-rate-rise>
 amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had 
softened.


The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down 
more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading 
bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China’s downturn.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2% and on Wall Street the 
Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&P 500 was up 0.8% at the 
time of the London close.

Analysts cautioned that while Draghi’s words had soothed markets for now, they 
would need to be followed with real action. Many recalled December’s 
disappointment when ECB action wasdeemed much less aggressive than Draghi’s 
prior promises had led investors to believe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/03/ecb-launches-new-stimulus-package-eurozone>
.


“ECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his ‘super’ 
status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,” said Alastair 
McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG.

“All in all it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn’t 
actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JP Morgan, RBS 
and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to 
March.”

Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, commented:


“Although equity markets have lapped up the prospect of additional easing like 
manna from heaven, any euphoria derived from promises of central bank action 
may prove to be fleeting. Despite Draghi’s assurances, it’s still not clear if 
the ECB is willing to commit to the sort of massive, unconditional and 
open-ended QE programmes that we have seen from the Bank of Japan and the Fed.”

Now here’s a turn-up.

Davos attendees have voted that the answer to inequality lies more in wealth 
distribution than greater opportunity, we hear.

At the start of the debate, the audience were split 65%-35% in favour of 
opportunity. But after a spirited debate, the vote was switched, reports Philip 
Jennings of the UNI Global union.

Osborne: There's good news behind market volatility

George Osborne has denied that the EU renegotiations are hurting the UK 
economy, and claimed that the recent market volatility is actually a good thing:

Speaking to CNBC here in Davos 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/21/positive-trends-behind-market-volatility-george-osborne-davos-wef.html>
, he said:

“Internationally we need a big of a sense of perspective which is, underlying 
all this volatility are some transformations and transitions which are 
fundamentally good for the world – China becoming a more consumption based 
economy, energy being cheaper…in the European Union and the euro zone, the 
European Central Bank ready to…step in and support the euro zone.”

“Because of the very sharp falls in the oil price the markets are unstable…but 
fundamentally for most western economies…the fall in the price of energy is a 
good thing.”

World at risk of another pandemic

Graeme Wearden

Businesses at Davos are being urged to provide more financial assistance to 
help the world prepare for the next major pandemic.

Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, has warned that we are simply 
not ready for another serious outbreak, similar to the Ebola crisis that struck 
Africa last year.

Speaking at Davos he says:

Pandemics are not that rare, we have had a dozen in the last decade.

He cites Sars, bird flu, Mers, influenza and the Zika virus as examples of 
diseases which could create a new pandemic. At the moment, vaccines do not 
exist for any of these viruses.

This leaves the world very vulnerable, and we need to address it at the time 
between epidemics.

As well as life-saving drugs, Farrar says countries also need to prepare their 
response plans, so they are not caught out when a pandemic begins.

A new report, from the Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework 
for the future, estimated that epidemics and pandemics cost the global economy 
$60 billion annually.


Victor Dzau, who oversaw the commission, says:

“The report calls the attention globally that this isn’t just a health issue, 
it’s a global security issue”

The report called for the World Health Organisation to be strengthened, and 
for more money for R&D.

In total, Farrar tells me, just 60 cents or 40p per person would make a 
dramatic difference in fighting pandemics. That’s $4.5bn, which could come from 
governments and philanthropic groups as well as business.

As Farrar puts it:

If we did that, we could go a long way to avoiding another Ebola, or worse.

Dr Zia Khan of the Rockefeller Foundation says businesses must do their bit:

“We are looking to the business community, as well as G7 and others, to take 
up as a call to action. It is directly relevant to them”.

George Soros then went on to launch an astonishing attack on Donald Trump, 
saying that he was doing “the work of Isis”.

He added: 

“By fearmongering he and (Ted) Cruz are doing the work of Isis.

They want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim 
community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim 
community into a breeding ground for Isis.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/dec/08/donald-trump-calls-for-complete-ban-on-muslims-entering-the-us-video>

This prompted a huge petition to have the businessman and presidential 
candidate banned from the UK, which MPs debated earlier this week. During the 
debate, Trump was labelled (among other things)a “ridiculous xenophobe”

Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the crisis worse by his bombing of 
civilians in Syria.

 “He wants the EU to collapse.”
 
Soros then warned that European countries were in crisis, due to the number of 
people who have fled to the region:

“We have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of 
receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic.

It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.”

Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further 
rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the ECB would ease policy in March, he 
predicted (as Mario Draghi hinted today).
 
George Soros, the billionaire financier turned philanthropist, has warned the 
World Economic Forum tonight that the migration crisis is putting the European 
Union in jeopardy.

Larry Elliott was at the event, and reports:

George Soros said:

“The EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration. The EU is 
falling apart.”

Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan, Soros said:

“Most people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put 
right.”

As we covered in this liveblog this morning, Germany’s finance minister 
WolfgangSchäuble has called for billions to be spent helping the troubled 
countries in the Middle East, to stem the flood of refugees into Europe.

Soros added that the same conditions were in place as caused the crisis in 
2008.

“There is a financial crisis and a bear market. The source of the 
disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub prime. Today it is China 
where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.”
 
The Greek government says the talks between Lagarde and Tsipras were “sincere”

.

Helena Smith has the details:

The Greek government has just issued one of its famous briefing papers calling 
Tsipras’ talks with IMF chief Christine Lagarde “sincere.”

The Greek PM “underlined that time is a critical parameter for the successful 
conclusion of the Greek programme and the first evaluation [of the economy’s 
performance,]” the paper said.


Both agreed that from now on there should be “direct communication” between 
the Greek government and the IMF “so that each side has a clear view of the 
positions of the other,” it noted.

After saying it would be preferable if the IMF did not participate in Greece’s 
latest bailout, Athens reluctantly agreed last week to the Washington-based 
body remaining amongst the lenders.

Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has met with Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras> at the sidelines of the 
World Economic Forum.

It was a good meeting, one insider says.

And the IMF has now issued a statement, reiterating that Greece needs 
significant debt relief, as well as pension reforms which are causing such 
anger in Athens.

“The managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to 
support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public 
finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic program.

“Such a program would require strong economic policies, not least pension 
reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece’s European partners to 
ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.”

While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras> was addressing delegates in 
Davos earlier today, opposition against the policies his government is being 
forced to apply intensified as thousands took to the streets.

Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports from Athens. 

Opposition to the pension and tax measures set as the price of further bailout 
funds mounted today as thousands of protestors –mostly from the professions – 
joined farmers and fishermen and public sector unionists in denouncing the 
policies.

As Tsipras hob-nobbed in Davos, around 10,000 demonstrators took to the 
streets – following up farmer blockades that also expanded - in further 
evidence that after months (some might say years) of being relatively inactive, 
the protest movement is once again gaining steam.

For the most part, lawyers, doctors and engineers, many said they belonged to 
Greece’s vast sector of self-employed who stood to be hard hit by the reforms. 
“A lot of us here voted for the left and feel really betrayed,” Baltis 
Kapopoulos, an Athenian engineer, told me.

“It’s terrible that the left should be tainted by such policies,” he said in 
front of the Greek parliament, a placard emblazoned with the words ‘You won’t 
kick us out of the country’ above his head.

At 29, Kapopoulos said he had no desire to leave Greece but like many might be 
forced to by the measures. “If they go through, pensions will drop, 
contributions will soar and taxes will double. There’ll be a lot of black 
market work with no insurance. And it’ll be the end of small firms.”

 “I think the reason there has been such a delay in protest is because people 
have been shocked. We voted ‘no’ in the referendum [last July] and 48 hours 
later, Tsipras went and accepted everything,” he said of the leftist’s 
spectacular surrender to creditors’ demands under threat of Greece’s ejection 
from the euro zone. “Either we react now or we never will. It’s the last chance 
if we don’t want to be forced to leave our country.”
 
Felix Salmon, the sharp-as-a-very-sharp-tack financial columnist, has 
delivered his verdict on this year’s Davos.

And it’s a zinger, surpassing Felix’s earlier criticism of the annual shindig 
in the mountains.

He argues that the excitement and chatter behind the scenes about Donald Trump 
(the antithesis of the spirit of Davos), shows that WEF’s vision of an open, 
inclusive approach to solving the world’s problems is failing.

Especially as we seem to be collecting more problems, not fewer, from stock 
market turmoil and oil, to the Middle East.

Over to Felix:

This year, then, is proving itself to be the Davos of denial, the year that 
the disconnect between rhetoric and reality became more obvious than ever. The 
founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is on some level a 
plutocratic power-broker just like many other rich and powerful men, but his 
dream of bringing the world together in the service of peace and prosperity is, 
or was, a genuine one.

It has even been bought into by leftist critics 
<http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/01/17/davos-and-its-threat-democracy> 
who complain that Davos is “increasingly where global decisions are being taken 
and moreover is becoming the default form of global governance.”

The truth, however, is that with the exception of a few public-health 
initiatives, the Davos model of “multi-stakeholder initiatives” and “global 
redesign” has utterly failed in its stated aims. The grandiloquence is as lofty 
as ever, but the world has not come together; instead, it is fracturing, and 
the World Economic Forum’s manifold Leaders are reduced to the status of 
impotent spectators. Some men just want to watch the world burn; Davos Man 
wants nothing less. But, right now, that’s all he can realistically do.

In the financial markets, ECB president Mario Draghi has provided some respite 
today with his assurances that the central bank will review policy in March - 
hinting fresh stimulus could come sooner than many investors had been expecting.

London’s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi’s 
remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart Mark 
Carney this week thatUK interest rates would stay at their record low 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/bank-of-england-mark-carney-rules-out-uk-interest-rate-rise>
 amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had 
softened.


The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down 
more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading 
bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China’s downturn.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2% and on Wall Street the 
Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&P 500 was up 0.8% at the 
time of the London close.

Analysts cautioned that while Draghi’s words had soothed markets for now, they 
would need to be followed with real action. Many recalled December’s 
disappointment when ECB action wasdeemed much less aggressive than Draghi’s 
prior promises had led investors to believe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/03/ecb-launches-new-stimulus-package-eurozone>
.


“ECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his ‘super’ 
status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,” said Alastair 
McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG.

“All in all it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn’t 
actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JP Morgan, RBS 
and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to 
March.”

Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, commented:


“Although equity markets have lapped up the prospect of additional easing like 
manna from heaven, any euphoria derived from promises of central bank action 
may prove to be fleeting. Despite Draghi’s assurances, it’s still not clear if 
the ECB is willing to commit to the sort of massive, unconditional and 
open-ended QE programmes that we have seen from the Bank of Japan and the Fed.”
 
Now here’s a turn-up.

Davos attendees have voted that the answer to inequality lies more in wealth 
distribution than greater opportunity, we hear.

At the start of the debate, the audience were split 65%-35% in favour of 
opportunity. But after a spirited debate, the vote was switched, reports Philip 
Jennings of the UNI Global union.

George Osborne has denied that the EU renegotiations are hurting the UK 
economy, and claimed that the recent market volatility is actually a good thing:

Speaking to CNBC here in Davos 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/21/positive-trends-behind-market-volatility-george-osborne-davos-wef.html>
, he said:

“Internationally we need a big of a sense of perspective which is, underlying 
all this volatility are some transformations and transitions which are 
fundamentally good for the world – China becoming a more consumption based 
economy, energy being cheaper…in the European Union and the euro zone, the 
European Central Bank ready to…step in and support the euro zone.”

“Because of the very sharp falls in the oil price the markets are unstable…but 
fundamentally for most western economies…the fall in the price of energy is a 
good thing.”

Businesses at Davos are being urged to provide more financial assistance to 
help the world prepare for the next major pandemic.

Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, has warned that we are simply 
not ready for another serious outbreak, similar to the Ebola crisis that struck 
Africa last year.

Speaking at Davos he says:

Pandemics are not that rare, we have had a dozen in the last decade.

He cites Sars, bird flu, Mers, influenza and the Zika virus as examples of 
diseases which could create a new pandemic. At the moment, vaccines do not 
exist for any of these viruses.

This leaves the world very vulnerable, and we need to address it at the time 
between epidemics.

As well as life-saving drugs, Farrar says countries also need to prepare their 
response plans, so they are not caught out when a pandemic begins.

A new report, from the Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework 
for the future, estimated that epidemics and pandemics cost the global economy 
$60 billion annually.


Victor Dzau, who oversaw the commission, says:

“The report calls the attention globally that this isn’t just a health issue, 
it’s a global security issue”

The report called for the World Health Organisation to be strengthened, and 
for more money for R&D.

In total, Farrar tells me, just 60 cents or 40p per person would make a 
dramatic difference in fighting pandemics. That’s $4.5bn, which could come from 
governments and philanthropic groups as well as business.

As Farrar puts it:

If we did that, we could go a long way to avoiding another Ebola, or worse.

Dr Zia Khan of the Rockefeller Foundation says businesses must do their bit:

“We are looking to the business community, as well as G7 and others, to take 
up as a call to action. It is directly relevant to them”.
