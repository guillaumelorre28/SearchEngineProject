The return of Anne Robinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/anne-robinson> to BBC1's revamped 
Watchdog pulled in 4.5 million viewers but still lost out to ITV1's soap hour 
last night, Thursday 10 September.

BBC1 consumer affairs show, expanded to an hour by controller Jay Hunt, gained 
an average audience share of 21% in the 8pm hour, according to unofficial 
overnight figures.

However, ITV1's soap hour came out on top, with Emmerdale at 8pm pulling in 
6.5 million and a 32% share and Coronation Street claiming 7.7 million between 
8.30pm and 9pm.

The penultimate part of BBC2's The Frankincense Trail picked up 2 million and 
a 10% share in the 8pm hour.

Channel 4's How Clean is Your House drew 1.3 million and a 6% share between 
8pm and 8.30pm, with a further 216,000 on Channel 4 +1.

Channel Five's Megastructures attracted 700,000 and a 3% share in the 8pm hour.

BBC1's drama New Tricks may have finished its sixth series last week with 7.7 
million, but the show still managed to win the 9pm hour last night with the 
start of a repeat of the fifth run pulling in 5.3 million and a 25% share.

However, the BBC1 repeat allowed The Bill to perk up, gaining 4.1 million and 
a 19% share, up from 3.6 million last week.

BBC2's new series The Love of Money picked up 1.5 million and a 7% share in 
the 9pm hour.

6.3% over an hour from 9pm, beating Five which, in a change to the published 
schedule, aired movie repeat Out of Reach between 9pm and 10.40pm, with 600,000 
and a 3% share. The Sexy Ads Show at 10.40pm gained 600,000 and a 5% share over
