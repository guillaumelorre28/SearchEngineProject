A Malaysian court has sentenced the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-ibrahim> to five years in jail on 
sodomy charges, overturning an earlier acquittal and ending his hopes of 
contesting a local election this month.

The court said Anwar could remain free on bail while he appeals against the 
verdict to the country's highest court.

Anwar, 66, is the most potent threat to the government of the prime minister, 
Najib Razak, whose popular support has weakened over the past two elections.

Sodomy is a crime in Malaysia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia>, 
punishable by up to 20 years in jail.

Human rights groups criticised the verdict, calling the legal moves against 
Anwar politically motivated.

Anwar was accused of having sex with a male aide in 2008 but was acquitted by 
the high court in 2012. The government appealed against that decision.

The appeals court judge Balia Yusof Wahi ruled on Friday that the lower 
court's decision to acquit Anwar was wrong.

He said: "We unanimously allow this appeal and set aside the decision of the 
high court." The guilty verdict means Anwar will be unable to run for a seat in 
opposition-ruled Selangor, the country's richest state, this month. Anwar had 
been expected to take over as Selangor's chief minister if he had won.

The verdict is the latest development in a long-running legal campaign against 
Anwar, who maintains the sodomy charges are part of a smear campaign.

"This trial was all about knocking Anwar Ibrahim out of politics, pure and 
simple, and the government was prepared to jump through whatever hoops were 
necessary to make that happen," said Phil Robertson of the New-York-based group 
Human Rights Watch. "It's a dark day for the Malaysia judiciary, which has 
shown how hard it is to get a free and fair trial when political issues are in 
play."
