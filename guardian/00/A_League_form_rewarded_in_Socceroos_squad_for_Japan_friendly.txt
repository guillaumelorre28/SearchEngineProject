The Socceroos coach, Ange Postecoglou 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ange-postecoglou>, has named his squad 
for the upcoming friendly with Japan, giving a chance to a number of players 
who have impressed at the start of the A-League season.

The friendly is the last chance for players to make their mark before next 
year’s Asian Cup, whichAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> will host in January. Terry 
Antonis, Mitch Nichols, Aaron Mooy and Matt McKay have all been recalled after 
displaying good form for their clubs.

“The Japan match is the final hit out before the Asian Cup and we’ll have a 
good week of training leading into the game so we can continue to work on what 
we’ve been trying to achieve before we take on a tough opponent inJapan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan>,” Postecoglou said. 


“The squad we’ve selected has a core group of players we have been working 
with over the last 12 months but it still gives an opportunity to a few more 
younger players who have started the season well in the A-League.”
