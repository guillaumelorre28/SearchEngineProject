All the fuss over operas about sex and drugs and silicone enhancements you may 
have noticed in the media recently makes me think of what the showAnna Nicole 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/feb/21/anna-nicole-smith-opera-royal> 
could and should have been.

No, not La Traviata or The Ring, or even Stephen Sondheim's Company, but Mr G: 
The Musical <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH0Ob-QiLR4>, the song-and-dance 
spectacular that caps Australian comedian Chris Lilley's mockumentary of 
surpassing genius,Summer Heights High 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Heights_High>. Here, in place of Anna 
Nicole's dearth of characterisation and musical conservatism is a show of 
supple originality, brilliant singability and dramatic subtlety.

What Richard Thomas and Mark-Anthony Turnage manage in two hours, Lilley does 
in seven minutes: the trance number ("She's a naughty girl with a bad habit/bad 
habit for drugs") will stick in your brain more than anything at the RoyalOpera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera> House at the moment, and the final 
moral – "You don't need sex and you don't need drugs, 'cos life is ecstasy" – 
distils the message of Anna Nicole into one neat pill.

On top of that, the production out-camps even Richard Jones's best efforts at 
Covent Garden. All together now: "The smell of life. The smell of children. The 
smell of doing it together..."
