There has been a great deal of justified outrage at the dropping of A-level 
art history and archeology, yet hardly any mention of the fact that at the same 
time the AQA has dropped A-level statistics (What a message to send to A-level 
students

, 20 October). This subject, taken by some 800 students a year and taught by 
enthusiastic teachers, has just had a new curriculum approved following wide 
consultation. If AQA does not relent – and it is the only group offering 
A-level statistics – the result is that statistics will be confined to be part 
of A-level mathematics and certain subjects such as geography. Students from 
other subjects, especially social science ones, who are not prepared to take 
mathematics, will be unable to upgrade their quantitative skills at the same 
time as gaining an A-level qualification. This is particularly sad when we are 
seeing increasing public interest in data literacy and serious attempts to 
introduce more statistics and quantitative study into the undergraduate 
curriculum via schemes such as Q-step.
