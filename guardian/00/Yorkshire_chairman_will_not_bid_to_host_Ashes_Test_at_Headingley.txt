The Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> chairman and chief 
executive, Colin Graves, has said that the county will not bid to host an Ashes 
Test in 2013 or 2015 because it would represent too great a financial risk.

Yorkshire have recorded a £2m loss for 2010, a figure that was contributed to 
by poor attendance figures for the Pakistan v Australia Test that was staged at 
Headingley last summer. The county have a staging agreement with the England 
and WalesCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Board that 
guarantees them a Test and a one-day international each year between 2012 and 
2019. However, counties have to bid for the right to host Ashes matches.

Graves, who succeeded Stewart Regan as chief executive, said the cost of 
bidding for a Test against England's traditional foes would be a major risk.

He told the Yorkshire Post: "There's no chance at all of us hosting an Ashes 
Test. For 2013 and 2015 we are not allocated an Ashes Test, we won't be 
allocated one, and we are not going to bid for one to put ourselves at risk 
again. The figure is not fixed but it could cost anything between £1m and £2m 
to make a bid. I'm not putting between £1m and £2m at risk because it's not 
worth it. I'd rather stick with what we've got."
