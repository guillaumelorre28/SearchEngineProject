This is one of my favourite books. I enjoyed reading it because it was a 
mind-blowing adventure.

As I turned the pages I could clearly imagine the story as Darkus, Bertolt and 
Virginia, very different friends, who go on an adventure to save Darkus’s dad 
from Lucretia Cutter and her strange beetles.

Oh, and did I mention anything about Baxter, the massive beetle that falls out 
of Darkus’s strange new neighbour’s trouser leg, which helps him on his mission?

This is an amazing book for kids age 7 to 10. I liked this book because it was 
really thrilling, and I didn’t get bored of reading it, it was almost like I 
was there. So, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to get stuck 
into a really good story.
