The Newspaper Licensing Agency is warning news monitoring companies to sign 
its newcontent licensing agreement 
<http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-uk-newspapers-want-1-million-from-aggregator-businesses/>
 before the 1 January deadline at which it comes in to force – or they may face 
its legal action.

NLA's shareholders – News International, Mirror Group Newspapers, Telegraph 
Media Group, Express Newspapers, AssociatedNewspapers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers>, Independent News & Media and 
Guardian News & Media – write in an open letter that "businesses seeking to 
make money by selling access to our content without our agreementare not 
entitled to do so".

They add that they, if anyone doesn't sign up, they "will contest their 
position by all available means, includingtechnical measures and legal process 
where necessary".

The NLA says that the main British aggregators have willingly signed the 
terms, including Digital Media Services, Durrants, MediaGen, Precise Media, 
Press Data, PressIndex and the WPP-owned TNS Media Intelligence. Some 
international agencies are on board too such as Norway'sOPoint 
<http://www.opoint.no/>. But some – less than a third of the market, NLA says – 
are holding out and haven't signed the deal.

The NLA tells us these include Meltwater and Newsnow, whose MD Struan Bartlett 
wrote in anopen letter <http://www.newsnow.co.uk/press/openletter.html> last 
month that the newspaper biz should stop its legal threats and be glad more 
people are reading news stories as a result of monitoring services like his. 
Bartlett didn't return our request for comment.

The new licence is designed to redistribute some of the revenue generated by 
agencies selling tailored feeds of their content – the NLA estimates that 
companies like Newsnow make a combined annual revenue of £10m, of which the 
NLA's shareholders wants 10%. This is the first time aggregators have been 
included in the NLA's licensing regime – the agency makes clear its aim is to 
"legitimise" the monitoring industry.

The Financial Times is also an NLA shareholder but is sitting out this round 
of aggregator-chasing and did not sign the publishers' letter because it has 
its own, separate licensing agreement.

Disclosure: paidContent:UK's parent company ContentNext Media is a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Guardian News & Media.
