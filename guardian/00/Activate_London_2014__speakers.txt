director of Liftshare – the UK’s leading ride-sharing scheme, set up as a

cars in the UK are registered on the site. The commercial side of Liftshare 
creates white-label sites for around 1,000 councils, businesses, hospitals, 
universities and community groups, which enables the public sharing site to 
remain free to members. Liftshare’s mission is to ensure that everyone has 
someone to share a car with.

 Ben Dyson, director, Positive Money 
Ben Dyson is co-author of Modernising Money: Why our monetary system is broken 
and how it can be fixed. He argues that a design flaw in the banking system, 
which allowsbanks to effectively create more than 97% of the money that our 
economy runs on, is responsible for the financial crisis, unaffordable housing 
and the government’s reliance on unsustainable credit-fuelled growth. The 
proposals were recently featured by the Financial Times. He is the founder of 
Positive Money, a campaign for a banking system that worksfor society and not 
against it. More information atwww.positivemoney.org

Daniel is the co-founder of Fundrise <http://www.fundrise.com/>, the first 
real estate crowdfunding platform to allow anyone to invest directly in 
commercial real estate projects for as little as $100. Founded in Washington,

for non-accredited investors, raising $325,000 from 175 residents of 
Washington, DC and Virginia for thecompany’s first project 
<https://www.fundrise.com/offerings/1/view>.

The Fundrise concept was born during Daniel’s time as a real estate developer, 
frustrated by the broken connection between a neighborhood’s desires and 
institutional investors’ bottom line. By allowing local citizens to be 
investors in real estate projects, development could more in tune with a 
neighborhood’s needs.

Fundrise has since expanded across the United States as a platform for real 
estate companies to leverage technology to raise capital directly from 
investors.
