Most companies would struggle when faced with a rapidly declining market 
share, but not BlackBerry. It may be losing customers to Apple and Samsung all 
over the place, but it knows exactly how to reel them all back in – by 
unveiling Alicia Keys asits new creative director

It's a genius move. Nobody understands BlackBerries like Alicia Keys does. In 
retrospect, it's clear that most of her songs were really about smartphones all 
along, If I Ain't Got You was about the time she lost her BlackBerry and had to 
temporarily make do with a substandard Nokia, for example, and Girl On Fire was 
about the time she made the regrettable decision to buy a Kindle tablet instead 
of a BlackBerry Playbook. Surely Alicia Keys will lead BlackBerry into a brave 
new future; a future where all the ringtones sound like generic R&B andAlicia 
Keys <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aliciakeys> has to be careful not to 
let anyone photograph her using an iPhone.

But BlackBerry isn't the first tech company to draft in a celebrity to beef up 
its credibility. Three years ago, Lady Gaga was named as thecreative director 
of Polaroid

She even designed a printer for the company. Admittedly it couldn't have looked 
any more generic if it tried, and people only buy Polaroids ironically now, but 
it's the thought that counts. Two years ago, Will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas 
was named as thedirector of creative innovation at Intel

; a move that suggested a horrible future where one day he'd mumble 
disinterestedly over a loop of the company's jingle for three minutes and 
release it as another godawful single.

Similarly, Microsoft drafted Jessica Alba in to launch Windows 8 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2225149/Windows-8-phone-software-launch-Microsoft-hopes-Jessica-Alba-help-Apple-Google.html>
 last year. This was a step down from what the norm – she wasn't made a 
creative director of anything, not even of the box that Windows 8 phones came 
in – but on the plus side she gave the photographers something other than banks 
of worried-looking tech journalists to take pictures of.

Now we just have to wait and see whether Alicia Keys can live up to her 
creative-directing peers. If she can, who knows, that double concept R&B album 
about the annoying flashing red light in the corner of herBlackBerry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blackberry> might finally become a 
reality.

It's obvious that this sort of arrangement has a mutual benefit - the 
companies know that kids will react more strongly to, say,Lady Gaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga> than a balding divisional 
conglomerate head, and the celebrities can flatter themselves to think that 
they're anything other than a last-ditch attempt to save a firm from 
bankruptcy. It's a win-win for everybody, especially people who enjoy watching 
Alicia Keys hold a telephone that she doesn't really seem to care about very 
much.
