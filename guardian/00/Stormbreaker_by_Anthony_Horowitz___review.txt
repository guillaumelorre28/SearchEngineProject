When his uncle is mysteriously shot by an assassin, Alex Rider’s world goes 
mad. Recruited into MI6, he takes part in horrible SAS training, before being 
sent off on his first mission to Cornwall with some awesome gadgets.

Middle Eastern zillionaire Herod Sayle is building a new computer: 
Stormbreaker. Can Alex find out if the computer really is as good as it seems? 
Firstly he must come out alive...

Even though there are no illustrations, the brilliant descriptions really 
bring the story to life. When I read it I really feel into the scenes and I 
always want to know what will happen next.

I recommend this book to 8 – 16 year olds.
