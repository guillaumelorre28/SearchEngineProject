All this talk about the provenance of Operation True Blue, the code name for 
the plans forMargaret Thatcher's funeral, reminded Monkey of the story, perhaps 
apocryphal, behind Scotland Yard's decision to name its inquiries into alleged 
phone hacking and corruption on newspapers asOperation Weeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/operation-weeting> and Operation Elveden. 
Turns out the names refer to two of the most congested villages Norfolk â€“ 
Elveden, a dreadful bottleneck on the A11 between Cambridge and Norwich 
renowned for the length of time it takes to get anywhere. Weeting is the 
village at the southern end of the stretch. How is all of this relevant? Stick 
with us. It seems it was an in-joke aboutAndy Hayman, the Met former assistant 
commissioner who conducted the first investigation into phone hacking at the 
News of the World and who made the decision not to re-open the inquiry in 2009. 
Before the Met Hayman was, of course, the chief constable at Norfolk.
