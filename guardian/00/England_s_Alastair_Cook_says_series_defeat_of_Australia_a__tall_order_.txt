England's captain, Alastair Cook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook>, is not thinking about the 
possibility of displacing Australia as the top side in one-day cricket as the 
teams prepare for the start of their five-match series at Lord's on Friday.

A 5-0 whitewash would take England top of the rankings at the expense of their 
great rivals and continue a summer of success after Test and one-day wins over 
West Indies.

But Cook is aware Australia will provide much tougher opposition over the next 
few weeks.

When asked about the chances of a 5-0 series win, he said: "Let's not count 
our chickens. That's totally irrelevant for us. Our aim is just to win the 
series â€“ that's going to be a tall order.

"Like all these ranking things, everyone likes them, the media likes them, but 
we've just got to focus on what we do in our next game, starting at 10.45 
tomorrow.

"It's another test for us to see where we are as a side and I'm confident our 
lads can pull through it."

Cook said the team have been doing their homework on opponents who have 
unfamiliar faces in their lineup such as the fast bowlers Pat Cummins and James 
Pattinson.

"They're the world No1 one-day side and an excellent side," he said.

"They've got a good balance between experience and some good young players who 
we haven't seen that much of.

"Like always, it's going to be a very good Australia side and we've got to try 
and match that. There's a lot of footage of these guys, there's not many 
secrets out there and we're just trying to get the best media footage we can 
beforehand.

"Once we get out there and face them, we'll see what they're like."
