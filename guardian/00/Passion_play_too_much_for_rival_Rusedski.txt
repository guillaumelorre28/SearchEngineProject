After a career spent earning the reputation for lacking the mettle needed to 
win a tennis grand slam, Tim Henman celebrated with uncharacteristic passion 
when he defeated Greg Rusedski in the Battle of the Brits in the third round of 
theAustralian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> 
yesterday.

The British No 1 clenched his fists and raised his head to the skies after 
clinching a 6-4, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3 victory over his old rival. He will now meet 
Sweden's unseeded Jonas Bjorkman in the last 16 tomorrow and, as Henman is the 
highest ranked player left in the competition, expectations are growing that 
this could be his best chance to win a grand slam title.

Although Henman was always in control during the 2-hour match, a live 
television audience in Britain and a record-breaking night-time crowd in the 
Rod Laver stadium were rewarded with some thrilling tennis.

It also had moments of controversy, not least when Rusedski exploded in fury 
at the Swiss umpire when a crucial line call went against him in the second set.

Henman has been made 4-1 favourite to win the title by British bookmakers, 
although he has never progressed beyond the last 16 of a grand slam outside 
Wimbledon, where he has reached the semi-finals three times. Ominously, he has 
never gone further than the fourth round in Melbourne.

"Bjorkman's returns are some of the best in the world and I am going to have 
to play really well again to beat him," Henman said. "I thought I played really 
well against Greg." Henman and Rusedski have rarely been the best of friends, 
but there was no overt animosity this time. "Three or four years ago there was 
a certain amount of rubbish written about us, but that is firmly behind us."
