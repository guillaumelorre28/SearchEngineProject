“I try to dress classy and dance cheesy,” said the inimitable, yet much 
imitated South Korean entertainer,Psy, about his worldwide hit, Gangnam Style 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH1XGdu-hzQ>. Fair enough. He also said 
something like:

Najeneun ttasaroun inganjeogin yeoja
 Keopi hanjanui yeoyureul aneun pumgyeok inneun yeoja
 Bami omyeon simjangi tteugeowojineun yeoja
 Geureon banjeon inneun yeoja.

Meanwhile what did that cheeky chappie Olly Murs 
<http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/s103/the-x-factor/interviews/a263925/olly-murs.html#%7EpkU5N0tam3Wv6r>
 have to to say about his own oeuvre? “It would have been easy for me to bring 
out a real cheesy pop song, but Please Don’t Let Me Go isn’t your typical X 
Factor single and it’s a grower not a shower.” That certainly shows a talent – 
for self-parody – but I’m not sure it was intentional. And does “show-er” mean 
total shower?

Welcome then this week to the Readers Recommend fromagerie, part of a summer 
fête (worse than death) where even in the front window we can display two forms 
of cheesiness, but which one is a tasty snappy musical snack, and which a 
coagulated stinking mass of off-dairy bollocks? That is for you to decide, and 
putting forward more songs, there is so much more to be found on the shelves or 
in the larder.

In 1991 I was living in a shared flat with four other people, when suddenly 
our shower broke down. We asked the landlord to fix it, but he wasn’t the most 
thorough when it came to maintenance. That same weekBryan Adams got to no 1 
with (Everything I Do) I Do It For You 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zggSgIT0yd0>. We bet that it would be fixed by 
the time Adams’s indulgent power ballad, the theme from Kevin Costner’s Robin 
Hood movie, ceased to be at the top spot. It was - just. A record-breaking 16 
weeks later. I’ve never got so sick of a song ever, but was it so bad that, 
after going through 16 circles of squalid revulsion and hell, could it have 
come out clean and good? I don’t know anymore. You decide.

 Bryan Adams ... again 
But what makes a song fall into this category of cheesy naffness that somehow 
grows on you in retrospect? Or not? Does time make pop hits mature into a 
timeless classic, or turn into even more rancid commercial nastiness? What 
aspects of a song can turn rubbish into gold? Something insatiably catchy? A 
song that annoys the hell out of you but you can’t help but tap your feet to 
it? An earworm that sends you into self-loathing? What is the psychology of 
this reaction? The key thing is - this week’s category must provoke a reaction 
that pulls you both ways.

Here are a few random examples to get you annoyed, excited or delighted. First 
up, the verbal cliche.Bryan Adams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/bryan-adams> said he would do anything for 
you, but did the same apply to get a hit record? Take his “rockin” hit with the 
following lyrics. “Got my first real six string/ Bought it at the five and 
dime./ Played it til my fingers bled,/ Was the summer of ‘69.” Played it till 
your fingers bled? Really? My blood’s up already.

Now let’s move on to the romantic, sexy, slushy and mushy. Celine Dion’s My 
Heart Will Go On might come up in many lists, with its swelling lift-style 
music with wistful emotional implant Irish whistles, and yet others might think 
it to be a good tune, if sung by someone else. So is it the performer that is 
also part of the factor here - having a coffee-table artist, like Dion, or 
alternatively Dido, that gets one’s goat, or is it the song? Does your heart 
rise up, or sink like theTitanic <https://www.theguardian.com/film/titanic>?

 Celine Dion’s heart, and song, goes on, and on … 
Another aspect of the bad/good might be the manufactured images of the band 
itself, the shiny white teeth, the big smiles, the toothbrush advert waiting to 
happen. Think of the Osmonds, David Cassidy, and boybands evermore.Take That 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/take-that> may almost certainly figure. 
Another classic example might be those pretty, talented boys Hanson. Or are 
they? Hmm. Bop.

 Hanson 
From cheesy now ... to sexy. Sexy comes in all forms, and will feature heavily 
this week, I predict. In my book there’s nothing worse than the “sexy” boy or 
girl who who takes themselves ever so seriously. Do You Think I’m Sexy byRod 
Stewart <https://www.theguardian.com/music/rodstewart>? Oh Rod, you used to be 
good back in the day. Just the Way You Are by Bruno Mars? What planet are you 
on, mate? Love in this Club by Usher? I might be wrong about this one, and 
Usher is very successful with sales. But then again millions ofScathophaga 
stercoraria, or dung flies, are probably perfectly justified in wanting to land 
on a massive pile of shite.

 Usher’s looking for love, love in a club 
Sexy can also be a bit weird. Let’s sample a bit of the Black Eyed Peas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/black-eyed-peas>, once a bona fide hip-hop 
outfit. But ... My Humps? “My lovely lady lumps”? Really? But the annoying 
thing here is, it just goes round and round in your head ...

 Getting the hump about this one? 
My Humps, in my febrile imagination, reminds me of one of the most 
thoughtlessly inane, and tasteless lyrics of all time, from Rhythm is a Dancer 
by Snap! (1992). If ever there was a bad use of the rhyming dictionary, this is 
it. The song is a dance classic built of cliches made of concrete. But could it 
be on your list? I’m not joking, you know. I’m as serious as cancer. Why? 
Didn’t you know? Because rhythm is a dancer.

 This this make you Snap!? 
There’s a whole history of incredibly catchy, but annoying dance songs 
featuring any number of animals including chickens, a crazy frog, and then 
there’sAgadoo by Black Lace <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POv-3yIPSWc> (I 
heartily apologise, readers) which ravaged through the 80s like a modern form 
of the Black Death. But I won’t go there. Catchy dance songs can come in all 
forms, and often they can be utterly insubstantial, but sometimes remain 
annoyingly cool, perhaps because of the sound, or simply because we associated 
them with a soft toy. Here’s Mr Oizo’s Flat Beat featuring Flat Eric. Just you 
try not to nod your head to this.

 Flat Eric. That’s it. 
A truly great gimmick is nothing new to help divide opinion, with the 
especially potent question: is this music or a just a total ripoff? Time for 
some German minimalism now, and to press the button of a Casiotone with Da Da 
Da by Trio. So ... do you love it orIch lieb dich nicht?

 Trio ... testing the boundaries of music with a certain irony 
Some of the the artists I’ve mentioned have been one-hit wonders, but it is 
certainly worth thinking of songs by more established, even reverered artists 
that may enter this category. Madonna, Cher,Kylie Minogue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue>, Coldplay and even the Beatles 
might have produced many a so-bad-it’s-good record. At this point, perhaps 
because of their ubiquity and Mamma Mia! movie (musicals may feature this week 
too), Dancing Queen by Abba might be one candidate for a song that starts off 
good, then becomes bad, then moves through this cycle any number of times. 
Which is it at the moment?

 Abba’s Dancing Queen 
Finally, another huge wheel of cheese is the comedy song. What governs it? The 
fact that it is supposed to be ironic, or just plain fun, or just plain wrong? 
Is the artist laughing at themselves, with the audience, or at it? Your 
suggestions might include the cheesist of cheesy beats inBarbie Girl by Aqua 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhrYis509A>, or the cheekiest of cheeky 
cheeks inThe Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum) by the Cheeky Girls 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zDW5VVAhAE>, or if you want to go for one 
entirely different, The Funky Gibbon by the Goodies. How the world has changed. 
Or has it?
