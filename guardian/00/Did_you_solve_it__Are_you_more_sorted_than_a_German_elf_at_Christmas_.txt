Earlier today I set you the following puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/19/can-you-solve-it-are-you-more-sorted-than-a-german-elf-at-christmas>
, from a Christmas quiz set by the German Mathematical Society. About 80 per 
cent of German 12 to 14-year-olds gave the correct answer.

Below are the first four prototypes of a machine designed by elves designed to 
sort presents by weight. Each machine sorts four presents at a time. The four 
presents are placed in the top, and then fall through the slides. Where two 
presents meet at a crossing, the lighter present goes to the left, and the 
heavier one goes to the right. This is repeated until all four presents are at 
the bottom.

Four elves, Fredi (39kg), Oswald (34kg), Iphis (28kg), and Esmeralda (21kg) 
are selected to simulate the presents in test runs. Which one of the four 
machines sorts the elves correctly for every possible order in which the elves 
can step into the four slides?

The puzzle is asking to choose between four algorithms - so as well as being 
seasonal, the puzzle is highly topical! As you may have read everywhere, we 
live in a world of algorithms.

SOLUTION


The answer is Machine 4.

Several thousand Guardian readers attempted this puzzle, and the results are 
as follows:

 * Machine 1: 16.3 per cent

 * Machine 2: 6.1 per cent

 * Machine 3: 17.3 per cent

 * Machine 4: 60.3 per cent

So, most of you got it right - but as a group you performed significantly less 
well than the German children.Fröhliche Weihnachten!

EXPLANATION

We could solve the puzzle the boring way by simulating every possible order of 
the four elves. There are 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 possible orders, so it might take 
a while. Better would be to seek out orders that don’t work, since as soon as 
we find an order that doesn’t work for any machine we can eliminate it.

To make things easier let’s call the elves from lightest to heaviest A, B, C 
and D, and call the positions 1, 2 3 and 4. The question asks us to find the 
machine that always results in the order A, B, C, D in positions 1, 2, 3 and 4.

The quickest one to eliminate is Machine 2. Imagine that A and B are put in 
slides 1 and 2. At the first weighing, B goes to the right, which means it can 
only end up in either 3 or 4. B must always end in 2, so this machine fails.

We can also eliminate Machine 3 this way. If A and B are in slides 1 and 2, 
then A will fall left after the first weighing and will then meet B coming down 
slide 2. B must fall to the right, meaning that B again ends up in either 3 or 
4. Fail.

Now let’s imagine that the two heaviest elves, C and D, are put in the first 
two slides. Consider Machine 1. After the first weighing, C goes down the left 
slide, which means it can only end up in 1 an 2. C must always be in 3, so this 
machine fails.

We have eliminated Machines 1, 2 and 3, and so if you believe in the 
benevolent puzzle setter, the answer must be Machine 4. However, more 
interesting is to work out why Machine 4 is correct.

Consider A, the lightest elf. No matter which position it is in to start with, 
it must end in position 1. Likewise, no matter which position D, the heaviest 
elf, is in, it must end in position 4.

Here’s the clever bit. Since A always ends in 1 and D always ends in 4, B and 
C must always meet each other at the most lowly weighing place to decide which 
goes in 2 and 3. They must do this because there is nowhere else for B and C to 
go! And once they are weighed together they will go into their correct 
positions, B in 2 and C in 3.
