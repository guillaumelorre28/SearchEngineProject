Ricky Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast party will enter the Senate 
on a primary vote of less than 1%, while the mining magnateClive Palmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/clive-palmer> will face a recount 
in Fairfax after beating his Liberal National party opponent Ted O'Brien by 
just seven votes.

In South Australia, the Family First candidate Bob Day came in ahead of 
Labor's "machine man" Don Farrell, who was pressured to relinquish the No 1 
spot on the ALP ticket for the senior frontbencher Penny Wong. It proved to be 
essential for Wong's survival, as Farrell lost the seat.

The Australian Electoral Commission released the Senate results for South 
Australia, Victoria and the ACT on Tuesday.

The AEC confirmed that Muir had taken the sixth spot in the Victorian Senate 
race as a result of preference flows from other micro parties. Janet Rice of 
the Greens picked up the fifth spot in Victoria.

As a result, the Liberal's Helen Kroger lost her spot in Victoria. Mitch 
Fifield and Scott Ryan of the Coalition were returned, while Gavin Marshall and 
Jacinta Collins were returned for Labor. The former Labor senator David Feeney 
had retired to contest Martin Ferguson's seat of Batman, which he subsequently 
won.

In South Australia, Cory Bernardi and Simon Birmingham were returned for the 
Liberal party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>, Penny 
Wong (Labor) and Sarah Hanson-Young (Greens) keeping their seats.

The billionaire Clive Palmer has to wait a little longer to find out whether 
he wins the Queensland lower house seat of Fairfax, where the 89,000 votes will 
be formally recounted according to the rules for results with margins less than 
100.

In the ACT, Kate Lundy returned for Labor and Zed Seselja won the second spot 
for the Liberals, replacing Gary Humphries, whom he beat in a preselection 
battle.
