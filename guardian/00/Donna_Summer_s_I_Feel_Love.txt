If it felt like the sound of tomorrow in 1977, now it just sounds timeless. 
Summer's multi-tracked voice floats over a kick drum, an arpeggiated bassline 
and sumptuous synths, with Giorgio Moroder's sublime production at the heart of 
this record. It was one of the first to fully utilise the potential of 
electronics, replacing lush disco orchestration with the hypnotic precision of 
machines.
