In the early 80s, "indie" had meant any music released and distributed 
independently of the major record labels. After June 1986, the word came to be 
associated with underpowered guitar music made by wheyfaced, middle-class, 
white people. The cause? The C86 cassette, sold through mail order by theNME 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/nme>, which gathered together the year's 
leading indie contenders, largely wheyfaced, middle-class, white people making 
underpowered guitar music.
