, the former 100 metres world record holder, and Sherone Simpson have had their 
doping bans reduced from 18 months to six months and are free to compete 
immediately, the court of arbitration for sport (CAS) has announced.

The pair were suspended by a Jamaica anti-doping disciplinary panel after 
testing positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine.

They appealed to CAS to have their bans reduced to three months and the 
appeals were partially upheld. As the six-month bans have already been served, 
they are now eligible to compete.

A CAS statement said: “They put forward that the offence committed was minor 
because it was caused by contamination of the food supplement Epiphany D1 by 
the banned substance oxilofrine and requested that the suspensions be reduced 
to three months.”

Powell immediately expressed his relief on Twitter saying: “Thank u to The 
Court of Arbitration for Sport. Finally this weight has been lifted off my 
shoulders. Justice has been served. Now let’s run!”

The 31-year-old then added he would make an instant return to the track in 
Lucerne on Tuesday.

The reduction of the ban – given after he tested positive at the Jamaican 
national championships last summer – means he can return ahead of his scheduled 
date of December.

Powell and Simpson will miss next week’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with 
the Jamaican squad having been selected during their suspension.

Simpson said: “I feel total relief and that we have finally been vindicated. 
We both knew that we had done all we could to ensure the supplement was OK 
before taking it … our actions were not intentional and CAS has recognised 
that. I am truly thankful.”
