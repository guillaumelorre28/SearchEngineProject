The winner

Short of the freak deletion of every single print in cinemas and on Disney 
hard drives and pirate servers, The Force Awakens will ultimately wind up the 
highest grossing film worldwide released in 2015. For now, Jurassic World – 
with $1.67bn (£1.12bn) –still holds that honour 
<http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2015>. And given 
that, unlike Star Wars, its chart-topping feats came as a total shock, it’s the 
more interesting case study. The teaser, shrinking a great white shark to dino 
snack proportions, was anifty amuse-bouche 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqpxM3GkaDo>, but there wasn’t much early heat 
for a fourth instalment of Jurassic Park that looked to be adhering firmly to 
the modern franchise behavioural template. Except, financially, it didn’t. 
Analysts predicted a debut weekend between $115-135m, butit confounded with a 
record-breaking $208.8m 
<http://deadline.com/2015/06/jurassic-world-all-time-box-office-opening-record-tracking-social-media-1201443293/>
. The muscular US takings – $652.3m, the third highest film ever – were stellar 
from a country that often cools on rote sequels; they coupled with the expected 
explosion in overseas grosses to produce the third highest global performer, 
too.

No one had anticipated how comprehensively nostalgia, worked integrally into 
the blockbuster format, could max out interest across multiple generations. 
Jurassic World, in a phenomenon some are now calling the “legacyquel 
<http://screencrush.com/the-age-of-legacyquels/>” or the “legacy franchise”, 
incorporatednod after nod to its 1993 progenitor 
<http://www.slashfilm.com/jurassic-park-references-in-jurassic-world/> – and 
(see below) was far from the only one in that game in 2015. Beyond that, the 
Universal film was simply the most mainstream beast on the prowl in the summer, 
a straightforward four-quadrant rampage with none of the superhero film’s 
complicating urges to please fanboys, be “dark”, or play into an extended 
universe. Colin Trevorrow’s execution might have lacked Steven Spielberg’s 
finesse, but the film’s blindsiding success spoke volumes about nostalgia for 
the old-timey, all-embracing summer blockbuster (the year’s other major success 
stories, Furious 7, Avengers: Age of Ultron and The Force Awakens having gone 
out either earlier or later).

The recovery

Hollywood was wringing its hands in 2014, with US box office dropping 5% to 
$10.4bn. With this year’s total clocking at time of writing to $10.9bn, and The 
Force Awakenssailing past $1bn in record time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/star-wars-the-force-awakens-box-office-record>
, it looks like the$11bn barrier will be breached 
<http://www.screendaily.com/box-office/2015-to-cross-11bn-box-office/5098408.article>
 at last. Particularly with inflation factored in, this doesn’t scotch the 
picture of long-term stagnancy at the North American box office. But it’s still 
a shot in the arm in the face of a fast-encroaching Chinese market that should 
surpass the US by the end of 2017. But 12 months that have produced two highest 
US debuts (Jurassic World, $208.8m; The Force Awakens, $248m), an unprecedented 
five $1bn worldwide grossers (Jurassic World, Furious 7, Age of Ultron, Minions 
and The Force Awakens), and unprecedentednear-$7bn 
<http://variety.com/2015/film/box-office/box-office-has-record-year-as-few-share-the-wealth-1201668037/>
 global haul for high-flying Universal will reassure the studios about their 
agenda-setting capabilities.

With nervy industry prostration before these towering peaks and even more 
nervy self-flagellation over several flat box-office weekends during the 
summer, the secret of consistent growth seems to still elude Hollywood. The 
2015 worldwide chart climbed higher, but it also plummeted lower – into the 
$500m range, untouched in the top 10 since 2011. Part of the problem is because 
the landscape remains so tightly franchise-paved that introducing new material 
is not getting any easier. There isn’t quite the total dearth of originality 
some would have you believe – six top 20 films (Inside Out, The Martian, Fifty 
Shades of Grey, San Andreas, Kingsman, Home) were drawn from material new to 
cinema, same as in 2014. But mostly featuring outside the top 10, they are 
innately disadvantaged by the preawareness racket that killed Warner – who 
seriously struggled while waiting forthe DC extended universe 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Extended_Universe> to take over from Harry 
Potter – this year. For every Inside Out breakthrough, there is a Jupiter 
Ascending, Chappie or Crimson Peak casualty. More viable newcomers, however, 
would help smooth over some of the troughs between mega-hits. Same for 
economics as with its plotting: Hollywood always did prefer the rollercoaster 
ride.

 Nostalgia has become enshrined as a law of dramatics … Arnold Schwarzenegger

So, back to the legacy franchise. It’s impossible not to read this trend as 
the evolution of nostalgia-steeped 21st-century culture that, in cinema, has 
already landed umpteen remakes on our door. But where the early-noughties-style 
“update” now looks heavy-handed – see The Man from UNCLE – Hollywood now treads 
softer and more insidiously. The new legacy franchise starts, as with the boys 
stumbling on the climactic 1993 atrium inJurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world> or Spectre’s resurrection of 
Blofeld, by referencing its own iconic moments and characters in a way that 
goes beyond a bit of cheeky homage. The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys, 
though, went even further: their heritage grabs were woven, almost 
scene-by-scene and beat-by-beat in places, into the deep fabric of their 
screenplays. Nostalgia isn’t merely a business MO now; since perhaps JJ 
Abrams’s Star Trek revival, it’s become enshrined as a law of dramatics, 
franchises embroidering previously laid plotlines to self-reinforcing effect. 
Even Furious 7, halted for a moment by Paul Walker’s death and obliged to look 
back in memoriam, seemed slightly mesmerised by its own reflection. How aware 
Han Solo or Sarah Connor or 007 – given alibis of differing plausibility in 
their respective franchises – are of the weird repetitive vibe around them is 
by the by. What’s important is that this high-strength nostalgia, regurgitating 
cultural memories for the audience, is selling. Arguably, it’s another means by 
which Hollywood is switching – along with the “extended universe” – to 
infinitely renewable franchises that burrow ceaselessly into their own 
mythology. Disappointing returns for The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2 
($616.8m to date, a series low) are a blow to those who believed finite 
franchises with a fixed end point invariably boosted takings as they bowed out.

This year’s representation wars saw that unshakeable big bad, the white 
patriarchal order, under heavy fire: sustained attacks on multiple fronts on
Hollywood’s treatment of women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/rose-mcgowan-i-was-fired-for-flagging-adam-sandler-casting-call-sexism>
; the feeling of a Brokeback Mountain-type normalisation, post-Caitlyn Jenner, 
for transsexual narratives with Sean Baker’s Tangerine and Tom Hooper’s The 
Danish Girl; more heat for blackface-style casting in the ancient Nile delta on 
both Exodus andGods of Egypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/gods-of-egypt-posters-anger-whitewashed-cast-twitter-exodus>
. But the one area where these struggles translated into proper box office was 
with black America – long ghettoised away from the wider mainstream with the 
Kevin Hart-Damon Wayans-Tyler Perry brigade. Home, featuring CGI animation’s 
first black lead character, made $386m for Fox in spring, the 18th most 
successful movie of the year. Universal’s NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton was 
an effortless breakout hit in the summer, scooping $161.2m in the US, and Creed 
– another legacyquel, dancing like a butterfly around Rocky – has managed just 
over half of that to date. The latter two, especially, are deeply rooted in a 
specifically urban US context and have done business accordingly – rather than 
the vaguely ethnicised carnival of the Fast & Furious franchise that is 
designed to make bucks across borders. But in terms of underrepresented 
viewpoints getting their due, they are exactly where everyone wants to be: in 
the spotlight, with no one making a fuss about it, getting paid.

Chinese blockbusters v2.0


Bad news for Hollywood way out east in 2015: China film-makers wrested back 
control of the market, with a local-film share bordering on 60%. That is partly 
due to helpful state protectionism, in the shape of the foreign film quota and 
the periodic blackout on Hollywood releases. What’s also noticeable is how 
China’s homegrown blockbusters are becoming increasingly sharp. They’re 
ironising and splicing genres to win back the youth audience that,as we noted 
at the end of last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/31/transformers-4-2014-global-box-office-in-review>
, was losing patience with martial arts spectaculars likeRed Cliff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-red-cliff> and 
government-sponsored mega-productions. The fantasy filmMonster Hunt 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbhsvxqoCG4> – a critter-infested romp through 
a medieval kingdom, with a Men in Black-like penchant for mischief – become the 
highest-grossing local film ever ($380m) and 2015’s best overall in the 
territory counted in local currency.Lost in Hong Kong 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42gNEmpCeL0>, the second placed homegrowner 
($283.6m), raised Xu Zheng’s one-time indie comedies to full franchise stature. 
The meta-cinematic superhero parodyJian Bing Man 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO3PR-RAht8> ($186.4m) showed more 
Hollywood-style conceptual suppleness, while tomb-raiding thrillersChronicles 
of the Ghostly Tribe <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEmPPiNpXRQ> ($106.4m) and
Mojin: The Lost Legend <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gUxp1_4Ce4> ($188.9m) 
boasted a more rowdy attitude to history than stodgy big budget lectures of the 
past. Even Jean-Jacques Annaud’s officially sanctioned epicWolf Totem 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htggGbrX3qk> ($110.5m) was surprisingly 
progressive,venting about Cultural Revolution hypocrisies 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htggGbrX3qk>. Crushing form from Age of Ultron 
($240.1m), Jurassic World ($228.7m) and, especially, Furious 7 ($390.9m) gave 
Hollywood no shortage of encouragement in China – but this could be the first 
year they realised that the competition meant business.

The rest of the world

No signs, as yet, of any of the aforementioned Chinese multiplex-botherers 
breaking out internationally. But the day is coming. In the meantime, the view 
for anyone looking for a non-English language breakout is bleak – with 
noughties crossovers like Crouching Tiger, Amélie, Pan’s Labyrinth and The 
Orphanage looking more like historical timepieces with each year gone. God 
knows what theWeinsteins <https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein> 
did with the Anglo-Saxon distribution forSnowpiercer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/20/snowpiercer-first-look-review-edinburgh-2014>
, the eccentric $87m South Korean blockbuster that was the biggest recent hope 
(for those who hope for such things). There’s surely a story waiting to be 
written there.


In the meantime, we’re left with the odd speciality interest title scraped out 
over enough sufficient territories to start looking significant (Dragon Ball Z: 
Resurrection F 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/01/dragonball-z-resurrection-f-manga-animation>
, $61.8m), as well as the more prominent local genre films (South Korea’s 2015 
box-office champ, thechaebol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol> thriller 
Veteran <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HYI9-yJ76U>, $93m) and comedies. You 
can usually rely on the latter to approach $100m somewhere, but it seems the 
fractious global mood crept in, with only Germany’sFack Ju Göhte 2 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ueav4iE0gYI> – about a Hamburg petty criminal 
still lowering the tone at the Goethe-Institut – getting close with $70m. The 
usually reliable France’s best shot was comedy-dramaLa Famille Bélier 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEgw97vpkDM>’s $55m for its tale of a talented 
teenager with deaf parents.

Globally, India – although still sending its diasporic catchment area into a 
frenzy and mostly ignoring everyone else – had a fine year. Technically a 2014 
release, Aamir Khan’s syncretic satirePK 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ZEDGPCkT8> became in early summer the first 
Bollywood title to break $100m, including a smart $19.3m from China, where the 
star has a committed following. Part one of the Telugu epicBaahubali 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQRhE772b0> – supposedly the most expensive 
Indian film ever – managed a perhaps still-yet more impressive $90m worldwide, 
though leonine Mills & Boon bruiser Prabhas snared the majority of it from the 
home crowd. Salman Khan, meanwhile, shrugged offa criminal conviction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/bollywood-star-salman-khan-found-guilty-over-hit-and-run-crash>
 and let his global appeal do the talking, storming to $93m for his Kashmiri 
tearjerkerBajrangi Bhaijaan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/19/bajrangi-bhaijaan-review-salman-khan-india-pakistan-movie>
. Attempts to water down Indian flava for western tastes – as withBrett 
Ratner’s “remix” of Kites in 2010 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/20/kites-brett-ratner-hrithik-roshan>
 – seems to have stopped for the time being, but imagine what these films could 
do with just a bit more effort. Something mad: like translating the titles.


One last word a propos of diversity outside of Hollywood in the mainstream: 
the most depressing sign is that so-called overseas box-office hotspots like 
Mexico, Russia and Brazil are producing virtually nothing that looks remotely 
like crossing over, few new populist directors of note like Alfonso Cuáron, 
Timur Bekmambetov or Fernando Meirelles, and pitiful market shares for local 
films. It’s as if, as with Kylo Ren, everyone’s become happy to lie back and 
think of the empire.
