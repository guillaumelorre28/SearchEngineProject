It began as an April fool, a newspaper tradition that sought to amuse Guardian 
readers. But the gag, which "revealed" Labour's new election poster featuring a 
mean-looking Gordon Brown and the slogan"Step Outside Posh Boy" 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/01/labour-gordon-brown-hard-man> 
soon turned into an internet sensation and a top topic onTwitter 
<http://twitter.com/>.

By lunchtime thousands had clicked through to the Guardian's website from 
Twitter to see the poster. One tweeted: "I totally fell for the Step Outside 
Posh Boy campaign today â€¦ so plausible."

Soon the Twitterati created variations on the "campaign" poster on the website 
Flickr <http://www.flickr.com/groups/poshboy/pool/>. Alongside a glowering 
picture of Brown one slogan read: "Did You Spill My Pint", while another said: 
"Vote Labour. Or I'll wreck your hoose".

The story took a further turn when Labour big hitter John Prescott 
<http://twitter.com/johnprescott>, entered the debate calling on the Guardian 
to take the gag further to produce a T-shirt with the fake campaign poster. 
"Would anyone be interested in buying a Step Outside Posh Boy T shirt? Got a 
feeling they'd be very popular!", he tweeted, calling on followers to bombard 
Guardian deputy editorIan Katz <http://twitter.com/iankatz1000> with emails. 
Not a newspaper to disappoint, it was announced that 100 SOPB T-shirts could be 
won in this Saturday's Guardian.
