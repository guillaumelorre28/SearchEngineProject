One of Iraq’s anti-corruption leaders sat in his office, waving his hands in 
exasperation. “There is no solution,” he said. “Everybody is corrupt, from the 
top of society to the bottom. Everyone. Including me.”


Coming at the start of a conversation about Iraq’s ailing governance, and what 
was being done to turn things around, Mishan al-Jabouri’s admission was 
jarring. “At least I am honest about it,” he shrugged. “I was offered $5m by 
someone to stop investigating him. I took it, and continued prosecuting him 
anyway.”

Jabouri is a member of one of two anti-graft bodies, a parliamentary 
committee, tasked with protecting public monies in post-warIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>. Both have more work than they can 
ever hope to deal with – even if they wanted to.

Now, with plunging oil prices leaving Iraq’s revenues in more jeopardy than at 
any time since the US invasion, attention is shifting to what the custodians of 
public funds have done over more than a decade with tens of billions of dollars 
that could otherwise be a buffer from such a budget shock.

If, as projected, global oil prices remain at historic lows, Iraq will be 
unable to pay some of its civil servants, or honour pledges to build roads and 
power stations in the next financial year. The gravity of the crisis has 
created uncomfortable reckonings for Iraq’s political class, military leaders 
and some senior religious figures, who have led a staggering 13-year pillage 
that has left Iraq consistently rated as one of the top five least transparent 
and most corrupt countries in the world.

 “Believe me, most of the senior names in the country have been responsible 
for stealing nearly all its wealth,” said Jabouri. “There are names at the top 
of the tree who would kill me if I went after them. When people here steal, 
they steal openly. They brag about it. There is a virus here, like Ebola. It is 
called corruption. There is no hope, I am sorry to say.”

Across all levels of society, a realisation is sinking in that Iraq is now 
entering a phase that could prove every bit as destabilising – perhaps even 
more so – than thewar against Islamic State. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/isis-sending-children-die-unprecedented-rate-report-child-soldiers>
 Jamal al-Bateekh, a senior tribal leader with the ear of the political class, 
said: “For 12 years we have gone through the process of opening the budget in 
the parliament. But we have never closed it. There has never been a reckoning. 
All that time, they have been dividing the carcass into pieces.”

“This is existential,” said former deputy president Ayad Allawi, whose office 
was abolished late last year in a cost-saving drive. “There are organised 
corruption syndicates running the country, let alone militias. I tell you very 
frankly, no Iraqi power can take action on this.”

Over the past four months, some of Iraq’s top office holders, led by prime 
minister Haider al-Abadi, have tried to do just that. Emboldened by Iraq’s 
highest religious authority, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Abadi has tried to 
launch an anti-corruption drive designed to weed out the most guilty and 
introduce meaningful accountability processes across all levels of business and 
politics.

Sistani, who has remained taciturn throughout most of his career, had been 
unusually strident during his Friday sermons, delivered through a spokesman 
until he stopped them in protest in January. “We spoke so much until our voices 
were hoarse, yet nobody listened,” he said at the time.

“He was more strong, more fierce and in-depth than he’d ever been,” said 
Allawi of Sistani’s increasingly forthright interventions. “He knows how 
serious this is.”

Across Baghdad, the finance minister, Hoshyar Zebari, has been tasked with 
finding ways around a profound budget shortfall that Sistani, Abadi and others 
fear could soon lead to civic unrest and even retribution.
Oil prices

“We are 93-95% dependent on oil revenues,” said Zebari. “This year, our 
situation is far more difficult than in any other year,” he said. “We have 
exhausted our domestic borrowing. We need to go through a soul-searching 
process. We need to lose our dependability on oil. We need to prepare the 
public for change; on things such as VATs and other new measures. It is a 
question of a change in attitude. Here people are not accustomed to this.”

Iraq’s budget is modelled on an oil price of about $45 per barrel. However, 
oil had been hovering at $27 per barrel in recent months, beforerallying by 14% 
over the past week. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/oil-prices-rise-on-talk-of-output-cut-saudi-arabia-russia-opec>
Nevertheless, oil experts across the Middle East believe that the recent fall 
in prices is structural, not cyclical, with very serious consequences for 
economies that are largely driven by old energy.

Zebari said that in early February he took Iraq’s full financial accounts to 
Sistani in the Shia city of Najaf for the 85-year-old ayatollah to inspect. “He 
is very serious about turning things around,” he said. “But he is frustrated.”

Iraq has one of the biggest per capita public payrolls in the world, roughly 7 
million people from a population of just over 21 million, and it is here that 
Zebari believes much of the systemic corruption is hidden. “Our biggest issue 
is ghost soldiers,” he said. “There are maybe $500-$600m in salaries being paid 
to soldiers who don’t exist. There are so many outlets for this money to go 
without any accountability.”

In such cases, the salaries are instead collected by officers. In other cases, 
soldiers pay officers half their salaries so they don’t have to show up for 
duty.

The former chief of staff of Iraq’s army, General Babakir Zebari, who retired 
last year, conceded that the issue of ghost soldiers had bedevilled the 
military, along with vastly inflated tenders for weapons. “I warned about this 
all the time,” he said. “Everybody knew my views.

“The tenders are an issue that needed a lot of focus. It is my understanding 
that a lot of money went missing there.”

Hoshyar Zebari estimates that there as many as 30,000 ghost soldiers in Iraq’s 
military and that corrupt officers are pocketing their salaries. The impact is 
even more significant than the bottom line. The fall of Mosul, Iraq’s second 
city, in mid-2014 was in part blamed on there being far fewer soldiers in 
position to defend the city than there were on the books. Generals and other 
senior officers accused of running the scam have yet to be brought to account.

“They were protected,” said Jabouri. “We only go after the easy targets here. 
Recently a Christian businessman was jailed for two years for stealing $200,000 
to build his house. That is nothing. It doesn’t even register as a crime 
compared [with] what else is going on.”

“We have paid out $1bn for war planes that never arrived. In Tikrit there have 
been budgets paid for courthouses that have never been built. It is the same 
with road projects all over the country, the port at Umm Qasr near Basra. If I 
had 50 staff to help me, we could barely scratch the surface.

“The problems here are social as much as everything. You are seen as weak if 
you don’t steal. Everyone wants to claim power, because they know that nobody 
else is going to share power with them.”

Allawi said he had taken a plan to Abadi to invite forensic auditors to 
examine Iraq’s books. “I was met by silence and blank stares,” he said. “It was 
like a bomb went off in the room.”

Abadi has placed much of his political stock on his reform drive, which he 
sees as essential to holding the country together. Sistani’s full throated 
sponsorship has given his moves an impetus that they would not otherwise have 
had. However, so far he has been unable to slow a plunder that has crippled 
Iraq’s governance.

“He is a good guy,” said Jabouri. “He is cleaner than all people in the 
parliament. But he cannot do this. Nobody can.”

And what of the self-declared corrupt anti-corruption chief, Jabour? “I did it 
because I am daring people to come after me,” he said. “No one will dare to. I 
have files on them all.”

• This article was amended on 20 February 2016. An earlier version described 
Jabouri as Iraq’s anti-corruption chief. He is a senior member of the 
parliamentary committee investigating official corruption.
