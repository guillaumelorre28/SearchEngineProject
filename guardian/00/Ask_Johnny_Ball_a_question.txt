 Famed for his popular science programmes for children in the 1970s and 1980s, 
including Think of a Number, and his appearances on Playschool, Johnny Ball is 
now a judge on the panel for the Aventis prize for science books.

He has agreed to answer 10 questions from Guardian Unlimited readers on the 
day of the award ceremony - May 16 - and we have 10 signed copies of his new 
mathematics book for children, Think of a Number (Dorling Kindersley), to give 
away for the 10 best questions.

Email your questions to books.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk by midnight on 
Sunday May 14 for the chance to win a copy of the book and have your question 
answered by Johnny Ball.
