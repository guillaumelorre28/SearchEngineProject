My brother-in-law, living near Toronto, set out one evening for a stroll 
around his local golf course. He knows nothing about golf but he does enjoy 
this form of exercise. No one was around, but coming up to a putting green he 
came across a man with a clipboard making notes and they soon fell into 
conversation. “Do you play golf?” enquired my brother-in-law. “You might say 
that,” said the other, stretching out his hand to introduce himself: “Arnold 
Palmer <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-obituaries>
.” My brother-in-law has dined out on that one for years.
