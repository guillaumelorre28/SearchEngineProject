Cook wraps up on the two-hour mark.

Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> will introduce:

 * HealthKit and Health app - letting fitness/health devices communicate to a 
centralised, privacy-respecting app on the iPhone which shares data between 
them as you allow 
 * HomeKit - coordinating smart home systems 
 * "Extensibility" for iOS 8 - so that apps can communicate with each other, 
and pass data between each other natively 
 * Third-party keyboards are now allowed - though they won't be able to 
connect to the network (to send usage data) unless you specifically allow them 
7.57pm BST 

Cook calls iOS "the biggest release of iOS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ios> since the introduction of the App 
Store" (which was in 2008). "Together our devices provide an integrated and 
continuous experience across all of them. And developers can create powerful 
apps more easily than they've ever been able to.

"Apple engineers platforms, devices and services together. We do this so we 
can create a seamless experience for our users that is unparalleled in the 
industry. This is something only Apple can do."

7.51pm BST 

7.49pm BST 

Federighi says "what if you had Objective-C without the C?" Apple introduces a 
new programming language, Swift. It's a modern programming language - for which 
the developers are going wild (if you know what a "tuple 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple>" is, then you'd be excited. If not - it's 
an ordered list of elements. Programmers love them.) Swift benchmarks show it's 
very, very fast, Federighi says.

7.47pm BST 

Third-party keyboards will be allowed in iOS 8 - but won't get network access 
unless you say

Keyboards: Apple will let you install system-wide third-party keyboards. They 
will run inside the most restrictive sandbox - so without access to the network 
unless you allow them.

Touch ID gets an API (application programming interface) so that developers 
can build to it.

7.47pm BST 

iOS 8 will introduce HomeKit to let you manage home automation

"We've come up with HomeKit to allow secure pairing so that only your iPhone 
can unlock your garage door. With Siri integration you can say something like 
'Get ready for bed' and be sure the garage door is closed, the lights are 
dimmed, the doors are locked."

7.46pm BST 

Looking back at Tim Cook's "130m new users on iOS in the past 12 months" - in 
the four quarters to the end of March 2014, Apple sold 71m iPads and 160m 
iPhones, or 231m iOS devices (give or take a few million more iPod Touches).

That means that 130m of the 231m iOS devices went to new users - 56%, which 
feels like a remarkably high figure.

7.34pm BST 

"Extensibility" - apps being able to offer services to other apps. This is 
like Android's "intents" - also called XPC (cross-program communication).

"Extensions live inside an application's sandbox, but apps can reach through 
the OS to request. Pinterest can offer a share sheet to Safari. Bing can offer 
translation inside Safari. Photo filters inside of photos. Third party apps can 
define widgets with notifications."

Developers have been looking forward to this for a long time; iOS has lagged 
Android (which has had "intents" from its inception) and Windows Phone (which 
gained it in Windows Phone 8).

Federighi demonstrates an app providing a watercolour effect to a photo in the 
photo library.

"Widgets" appear in the Notification Centre - not on the Home screen. They are 
interactive and updated and you can interact with them directly - Federighi 
demonstrates an eBay widget that he can use to bid directly from the 
Notification Centre.

Or Bing translation - which is offered directly. (It's noticeable that Apple 
hasn't gone for Google translation; Google has had very little mention through 
the keynote.)

7.25pm BST 

"There is a lot more - what iOS 8 provides for developers to create apps you 
couldn't create before," says Cook. The App Store now has 1.2m apps with an 
"unbelievably vibrant" market. 300 million people visit the store every week. 
75bn apps downloaded.

"We want to make the App Store even better." New features on the store - an 
'Explore' tab, with trending searches, faster search, related searches, 
discounted bundles.

App previews - short videos of apps. (Britain's Monument Valley by UsTwo shows 
on the screen.)

Testflight - developers can ask users to beta test their app and get feedback.

Storage isn't quite free - tiered prices, though much cheaper than iCloud used 
to be. 5GB for free, 20GB for $0.99 per month or 200GB for $3.99 a month.

7.24pm BST 

iOS 8 adds Shazam song recognition - Siri will recognise a song around you. 
Streaming voice recognition, so that it will show what it thinks you've said, 
and 22 new languages that it understands. Vector-based maps in China. A lot of 
improved elements for China - one of Apple's most important markets.

7.23pm BST 

Photos get "smart editing" on the device - very simple interface for improving 
sharpness, colours and so on.

Synchronised over iCloud to other iOS devices.

"What about the Mac?" Working on a ground-up photo solution that will be 
shipping "early next year".

7.20pm BST 

Health

 * A single place and app to collate your fitness and health metrics 
 * Third-party apps can plug into the app, but the data that those apps can 
access is carefully controlled to protect user privacy 
 * Integrating with medical institutions - automatically sending data to 
doctors like the Mayo Clinc in the US or Cambridge University Hospitals in the 
UK

7.19pm BST 

"Family sharing" will let you create a "family" photo stream, calendar, Find 
My Friends ("with permission") and find your devices. Also sharing music, 
books, apps, films. "With Family Sharing you can get at your purchases but also 
the purchases of members of your family. You just click right through and 
download. For up to six family members." All on a single credit card - but 
parents get an alert when a child wants to buy something in a story.

In effect, it's Apple's response to Microsoft's "Kids Corner" (which ropes off 
part of the phone and its apps.)

• Photos and iCloud: "every photo you take on all your devices": "We're not 
only preserving - your device has access to more photos in the cloud than you 
can store on your device." Adds search for locations, time and album titles.

Apple will have public beta program for OSX Yosemite - people can sign up 
online and will get access to the ongoing betas through the summer. It will be 
free when it is finally released in the autumn.

7.15pm BST 

 * iCloud Drive - puts all the iCloud documents straight into Finder allowing 
users more control over the files and synchronises them across Macs

7.15pm BST 

OS X 10.10 Yosemite:

• New design that more closely resembles iOS for iPad and iPhone, with 
translucent windows and flat design

• Make phone calls from Mac or desktop

• Mail now stores attachments up to 5GB in iCloud Drive

• AirDrop files from Mac to iOS device

• Safari includes private search mode and Wikipedia has been integrated into a 
new, compact address bar

• Text messages automatically sync with your other Apple devices

"And now something that we all care a lot about - health," says Federighi. 
"Developers have created a lot of apps for monitoring your health. But up to 
now the information gathered by those applications lives in silos. But now you 
can with HealthKit. A single place where applications can gather the data. And 
there's an app - Health.

"We carefully protect your privacy - you can decide what you want to share 
between apps." Working with the Mayo clinic so that if a patent takes a blood 
pressure reading, and it's out of normal bounds, it will feed back to the 
clinic automatically.

 iMessage users can send picture, audio and video messages - which expire 
automatically in 2 minutes after being listened to, unless you choose to keep 
them. 
7.08pm BST 

Messages

 * Add or remove people from conversations, mute threads and name them

 * Location sharing within messages 
 * Voice and video messages – recording similar to the way Instagram or Vine, 
hold down the record button to record and then swipe up to send 
 * Users can listen to audio messages and reply to them from the lockscreen by 
simply lifting to the ear 
 * Photos are collated into one place, as well as embedded directly into thread
7.06pm BST 

Continuity works across iPhones and iPads too.

Messages is the most-used app. It adds Group Messaging, naming a thread, 
leaving a thread with multiple people, and "do not disturb".

Location sharing with people in a conversation. At-a-glance view of pictures 
and attachments from a thread.

"Tap-to-talk" allows you to record a short message which can be sent to the 
other person or people on the messaging thread.

7.05pm BST 

Apple iOS keyboard gets "Quicktype". In iOS 8 you get predictive typing 
suggestions (a form of which has been in Android for a while) - but given the 
question in a message "Do you want to go for dinner or a movie?" You'll be 
offered different choices - "dinner", "movie", "not sure".

And "none of your keystrokes leave the device," says Federighi.

7.04pm BST 

 * Spotlight suggestions: able to pull instant information from the web, from 
Wikipedia, iTunes to movie times

 * QuickType - supports predictive typing suggestions very much like Android 
has had for a while, including learning to the way that the user types. All 
done on-device ensuring none of the user typing leaves the device 
6.59pm BST 

iOS 8 is a "huge update", says Cook.

 * Adds "interactive notifications" - respond to messages or calendar alerts 
etc in the pull-down Notification Centre. Also works for third-party apps

 * "Bird's eye view" in Safari on iPad

 * New interaction with email to make access simpler 
6.59pm BST 

iOS 8

 * Notification centre: interactive notifications, like being able to reply to 
text messages straight in the notification bar 
 * Safari: sidebar like Safari in OS X Yosemite 
 * Mail: swiping gestures like delete, mark as unread or flag, very similar to 
apps like Dropbox’s Mailbox 
 * Direct access from the lockscreen: Swipe from the lockscreen to accept or 
dismiss calendar invites 
 * Frequently used contacts are now visible in the multitasking interface 

6.51pm BST 

Overall satisfaction for iOS 7 is 97%, according to a ChangeWave survey, and 
89% now using the latest version, says Cook. "This is in stark contrast to 
Android, where "when you look at their latest release less than 1 in 10 
customers - 9% - are on their latest software. And over a third of their 
customers are running a version of Android from four years ago." That means 
they are not getting great new features or security updates that they may need 
to stay safe, says Cook. "And this is particularly important for Android which 
dominates the mobile malware market."

Apple has sold over 800m iOS devices in total. Here's a breakdown:


 * 300m iPod touches 
 * 200m iPads 
 * 500m iPhones 
 * 130 million new Apple customers 
 * 89% iOS 7 users 
6.49pm BST 

iOS has brought more than 130 million customers in the past 12 months - it was 
their first Apple device. Many were switchers from Android, says Cook: "they 
had bought an Android phone and they sought a better experience and decided to 
check out iPhone and iOS. In fact nearly half of our customers in China in the 
past six months switched from Android to iPhone."

6.48pm BST 

 * OS X Yosemite available to developers today with a public beta program 
running this summer

Apple adds SMS reception (not just its own iMessage) and phone calls on the 
desktop – which you can accept and receive (and reply to, or take the calls) – 
"even if your phone is across the house on a charger," says Federighi. You can 
dial your phone from your OS X device - essentially bringing the OS X user base 
into the iOS user base.

6.45pm BST 

Continuity

 * AirDrop: send files from Mac to iOS device

 * Handoff: start working on a Mac, pick up where you left off on an iPad or 
visa versa including iWork office apps and Safari browser

 * Instant Hotspot: Mac will automatically see an iPhone as a hotspot when not 
in a Wi-Fi area

 * Text messages and phone calls – relayed from iPhone to other Apple devices, 
including the Mac and iPad

 * Users can make calls directly from a Mac or iPad via an iPhone routing the 
audio through the other Apple devices

6.41pm BST 

"We're going to take proximity-awareness and make it easier. Your Mac will see 
your phone and it will automatically set up a hotspot without you having to 
type a password. Even if your phone is across the room sitting in a handbag," 
says Federighi.

6.41pm BST 

"Airdrop now works between iOS and the Mac," announced Federighi. This had 
been hoped for - but it hadn't been clear how it would be done.

Federighi announces "Handoff" - your devices are aware of each other and you 
can pick up work from an Apple desktop or laptop onto an iPad or iPhone.

 * Integrates Wikipedia directly into the address bar, just like Google. 
 * Scrolling tabs in the tab bar 
 * Tighter integration with Mac Mail allows emailing directly from Safari 
using the recently sent to contact list

OS X will have a "dark mode" so that users aren't distracted by objects around 
the window in which they're working. "It's a more usable version of OS X," says 
Federighi.

The Spotlight inbuilt search also now taps internet sources.

6.33pm BST 

Email can handle attachments of up to 5GB in size.

6.33pm BST 

 * Mail Drop: attachments sent encrypted via iCloud up to 5GB in size. 
Seamless on Mac Mail. Other clients will be given a link to securely download it

6.24pm BST 

 * Migrated from the design language of “aqua" with the first generation of OS 
10 to the new Yosemite design which apes Apple’s iOS on the iPad and iPhone 
 * Translucent look all over the windows allows users to see their desktop 
background through the windows 
 * Icons have been cleaned, becoming much more flat, colourful and iOS-like 
 * Dark mode allows users to change the translucence to a darker smoke colour 
for night-time work 
 * Notification centre: a "today" view provides interactive at-a-glance 
information for both built-in apps and third-party apps 
 * Spotlight: moves from top right into the middle of the screen, making 
searching easier

The audience - some of whom have been queueing since 5.30am - is expecting an 
announcement around the smart home, the "Healthbook" app to store health data, 
and new versions of the desktop and mobile software.

The latter tends to matter more because it will be pushed out to so many more 
people and so quickly: there are more people using iOS 7 than any single point 
version of Android. But don't expect new iPhones or iPads - it's the wrong time
