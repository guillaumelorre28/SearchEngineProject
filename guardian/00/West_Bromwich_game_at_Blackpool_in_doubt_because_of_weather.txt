The referee Dave Foster will hold a 10am pitch inspection at Bloomfield Road 
tomorrow to decide if the Championship game betweenBlackpool and West Bromwich 
Albioncan take place. Freezing temperatures overnight and the forecast of 
further frosty conditions have put the fixture between the seventh-placed home 
side and Roberto Di Matteo's side in doubt.

The League One game between Colchester against Carlisle has been called off, 
as has the League Two fixture betweenAldershot and Bradford.

In the Blue Square Premier, the games at Luton, Crawley, Altrincham and 
Ebsfleet United have all been postponed.
