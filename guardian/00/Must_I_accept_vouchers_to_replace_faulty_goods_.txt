Q I bought a Panasonic DVD and HDD recorder from Argos in February last year. 
It went wrong at the end of January this year so I returned it to the shop at 
the beginning of February. After 12 days and no news I tried phoning, but no 
contact was possible. I called into the shop, where they tried to give me the 
machine back with no confirmation of its repair. I asked for confirmation, and 
after a 10-minute wait they said it was beyond economic repair. Leaving aside 
the fact they were trying to give me back my machine untouched, my problem is 
that they are offering a full refund to the card on which I bought the machine, 
but I no longer have it. Any ideas how to go about getting my money back and 
avoiding the dreaded gift vouchers?

A Since the DVD recorder is beyond economic repair you are entitled to what 
the law calls damages for breach of contract. Basically, this means 
compensation in money, so you don't have to accept a refund on your card, or 
some gift vouchers. If you point this out you should receive the refund you've 
been offered in cash - after all it's not your problem you no longer have that 
particular card, and you have been put to some inconvenience waiting for the 
repairs that didn't work.

If the seller becomes awkward about this, however, you may find it difficult 
to insist on a full refund at this stage. This is because the seller is legally 
entitled to deduct an amount from the refund to reflect the use you've had from 
the machine over the past 11 months. So if you are offered a brand new 
replacement or a credit note for the full value of the DVD Recorder, you need 
to work out whether this is preferable to a reduced refund.
