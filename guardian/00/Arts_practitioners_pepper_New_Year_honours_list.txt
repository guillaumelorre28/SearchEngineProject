There were, however, many arts practitioners on the list. Is the Diary the 
only one surprised (and pleased) to seeSteve McQueen get a CBE, given the 
artist's marathon battle with the establishment to get the Iraq war dead 
printed on stamps? Among the other recipients of a CBE – and the Diary 
apologises to the names omitted here – are producer Trevor Horn, sculptor 
Richard Wentworth, theatre director Howard Davies, choreographer Wayne 
McGregor, trumpeter John Wallace, actors Sheila Hancock and David Suchet, and 
composer Howard Goodall. OBEs went to Annie Lennox, folkieRichard Thompson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-thompson>, director Andrea Arnold, 
actor Burt Kwouk, costume designer Sandy Powell and composer Colin Matthews. 
And there are damehoods for actor Harriet Walter, mezzo-soprano turned 
professor Felicity Palmer and writer Antonia Fraser.

Disappointingly, despite the Diary's call 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2010/dec/21/new-years-honours-list>
 for a triple whammy of knighthoods forKen Dodd, Ronnie Corbett and Brucie 
Forsyth, they got nothing.
