"I'm just a nerd who tried to gain points by becoming an activist," says 
54-year-old Sylvia Estrada-Claudio, with infectious laughter. As the director 
of the Centre for Women's Studies at the University of the Philippines, she is 
one of the leading reproductive rights activists in the country.

In 1972, the 14-year-old Estrada-Claudio was forced underground when martial 
law was declared and the Maoist youth organisation she was part of became 
outlawed. Two years later she began to study in the premier medical institution 
of the Philippines, but decided to use her skills to serve the poor in the 
forgotten reaches of the country. She joined the New People's Army, only to 
realise there was no space in the revolution for women to articulate the 
struggles they faced in their intimate lives.

"If you really want to liberate people, you have to look at reproductive 
rights," says Estrada-Claudio. "People speak of development having a human 
face. And I say a human face and a human body." She eventually broke with the 
Maoists.

Now the likelihood that the reproductive health bill will pass is a reason to 
rejoice for activists such as Estrada-Claudio and the women of the Philippines 
who have coalesced around the bill: "After one of the congressional hearings, 
people started singing and dancing on the streets, white haired grandmothers 
and transwomen. None of them were clearly going to give birth, but they were 
the ones who were dancing."
