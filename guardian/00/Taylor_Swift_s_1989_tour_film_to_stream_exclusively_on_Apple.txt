approach to paying musician’s royalties.

Swift’s partnership with Apple marks a new chapter in the relationship between 
the singer and the tech giant. In June this year, Swift decided to withhold her 
1989 album fromApple Music <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple-music> 
during its three-month free trial period, in which the streaming service would 
not pay royalties to rights holders.

Posting an open letter entitled To Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple>, Love Taylor, she wrote: “Apple 
Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months.”

“I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this 
historically progressive and generous company.”

Shortly after this statement

 – and some extra pressure from a number of indie labels – Apple had a change 
of heart and announced it would pay royalties to music labels and publishers 
during the three-month trial.

As well as her concert film, Apple Music will air an interview between its 
Beats 1 radio station host Zane Lowe and Swift on Monday 14 December.
