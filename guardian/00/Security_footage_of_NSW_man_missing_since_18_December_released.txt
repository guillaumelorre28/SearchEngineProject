Security footage of a man missing for more than a week in the Blue Mountains 
west of Sydney has been released as authorities try desperately to find him.

Kim Mackell, 64, was last seen boarding a train to Blackheath before being 
dropped off at his home by a taxi about 10pm on 18 December.

Mackell, who suffers from several medical conditions which require medication, 
has not been since. The police dog squad, uniformed officers, firefighters, 
rescue crews and volunteers are continuing to scour dense bushland near his 
home.

Investigators on Thursday released CCTV vision of Mackell leaving Blackheath 
train station, pleading with anyone with information to come forward. They are 
keen to speak with the driver of a silver Hyundai that was seen stationary on 
Bells Line of Road at Scenic Hill about 8.30am on Christmas Day.
