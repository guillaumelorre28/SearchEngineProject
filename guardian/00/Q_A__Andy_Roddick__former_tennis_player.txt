When were you happiest?
Nothing is better than right now, and having a baby is no small part.

What is your greatest fear?
Snakes. Unfortunately, where we live I run across them close to weekly.

What is your earliest memory?
We lived in Nebraska when I was very young, and I have vague memories of the 
house and being stuck in snow.

Which living person do you most admire, and why?
I look up to people such as Andre Agassi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andre-agassi> who use their fame as a 
pedestal for causes. He was great to me early on in my career.

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
I’m pretty honest, for better or worse.

What is the trait you most deplore in others?
Ignorance and being inconsiderate.

What was your most embarrassing moment?
Meltdowns on court.

What is your most treasured possession?
The golf clubs.

What is your favourite smell?
Pizza.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
That’s easy: my bald spot.

What is your guiltiest pleasure?
Wine.

What is your most unappealing habit?
Chewing my nails.

Who would play you in the film of your life?
Stifler from American Pie <http://americanpie.wikia.com/wiki/Steve_Stifler>.

What is your favourite word?
The F word, because it’s a noun, adjective and a verb.

What did you want to be when you were growing up?
I always wanted to be a sportsman of some sort. My brother John was a tennis 
player, too, and my eldest brother Lawrence a diver. I don’t know where it came 
from – our parents were farmers.

To whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?
My parents, for all the stuff I put them through as a kid.

What does love feel like?
I am pretty shallow, so I’m not going to be as forthcoming with this as I was 
with the one about my favourite smell.

What was the best kiss of your life?
The last one.

Who would you invite to your dream dinner party?
Close friends and family only. At my dream dinner, I wouldn’t want to go 
through that awkward getting-to-know-you process for an hour or so.

What is the worst job you’ve done?
I don’t feel like I’ve worked a day in my life.

If you could edit your past, what would you change?
I’d love to have won Wimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon>.

When did you last cry, and why?
At my oldest friend’s wedding.

How would you like to be remembered?
Hopefully with a hint of positivity.

What is the most important lesson life has taught you?
Every time you think you have something figured out, there is a curve ball 
around the bend. So be adaptable.

Tell us a secret
I’m not telling if it’s a boy or a girl.
