These fantastic seasonal mushrooms have a fruity, peppery flavour, a meaty 
texture and are perfect with pasta. For a change, you can add a touch 
of chopped bacon with the garlic, or make it richer by adding some double cream 
right at the end when you toss the pasta with the mushrooms.

(Serves three to four)

375g dried tagliatelle
Salt to season
50ml olive oil
1 clove garlic, chopped finely
200g girolle mushrooms
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped
25g grated parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), to serve

Add the pasta to a pan of salted boiling water and cook as instructed on the 
packet (cooking time will normally be around eight minutes).

A couple of minutes later, put the oil into a saute pan large enough to hold 
the cooked pasta and mushrooms and warm over a medium heat.

Saute the chopped garlic for 30 seconds before adding the mushrooms for a 
further three to four minutes.

Keep the saute pan warm while the pasta continues to cook, and when it 
is ready, drain  and toss together with the mushrooms.

Finish with the chopped flat-leaf parsley and the grated parmesan and serve 
straight away.
