Every day, Lucy Porter and I will be talking to the top names in comedy, out 
discovering the up-and-coming talent and we'll play you clips of the shows 
we've seen.

For our very first Heckle, Lucy gets a tour around Arthur Smith's gallery 
Arturart - his mock-major retrospective of paintings, moments-trouves and old 
T-shirts. We look at what techniques the poor sods who give out flyers use to 
rid themselves of all those piles of paper, and I go to along to Paul Sinha's 
great new show King of the World.
