Quiz staff about your course


The course should be top of your list of things to explore on university open 
days and a little preparation can make a big difference.

But according to Kevin Betts, acting head of undergraduate recruitment at the 
University of Sussex, most applicants ask questions about things that are 
already covered in the provided information available.

So don’t waste time – get in there with a killer question. It’s your chance to 
interrogate staff and students, and find out exactly what you will be doing for 
the next three or four years.

Check which modules are compulsory and the options offered for each year of 
the course because they can change after prospectuses are published. Are there 
opportunities to study abroad and, if so, will it count towards your degree? 
How many taught hours will you have? And how are marks split between 
assignments and exams?

Betts says he has noticed a general lack of preparation by students, which 
means they do not get the best out of the day. “When it comes to courses,” he 
says, “90% of the questions asked are whether we do a particular subject and 
what exactly is on offer – information that is already on our website and in 
the prospectus. However, some students arrive brilliantly prepared and really 
interrogate the staff – we enjoy that.

“So try something more searching, such as: ‘All universities offer psychology 
– so why should I choose Sussex?’ Or: ‘I’m thinking of applying to Bristol and 
they do x or y – how does that compare?’ We won’t hold it against you, far from 
it. It shows that you are a serious candidate.”

Once you start to delve you may be surprised at the big differences between 
subjects with the same name at different universities. Logic and scientific 
inquiry are central to philosophy courses at the London School of Economics, 
for example, whereas Durham is known for metaphysics – exploring the nature of 
being – and linguistics.


If maths is not your strongest subject, find out how much is needed for an 
economics degree and explore other options, such as business studies.Applicants 
tend to see the world in terms of A-level subjects when in fact there are fewer 
than 100 A-levels and thousands of university degrees. An open day is the 
opportunity to ask about other courses related to your favourite subjects.

And don’t be afraid to ask to see more. “If you want to see the facilities 
there’ll be someone to take your around,” says Clara Garavelli, admission tutor 
for modern languages at the University of Leicester. “Sign up for taster 
sessions and talk to our students because they volunteered to help you.”

There are no “daft” questions, says student ambassador Alysha Johnson, 22, a 
final-year aerospace engineering student at Sheffield Hallam University: “Ask 
what the course is like, the kind of assignments you’ll get, how much of the 
assessment is on coursework and how much on the exams, and what the tutors are 
like.

“The lecturers will be there and will give you all the guff about what you are 
going to be doing, but they can’t tell you what it’s actually like to be a 
student on their courses.”


Find out more about your future job prospects


Studying for a degree is a huge commitment of time and money so knowing what 
it can offer you in the long term is important. Open days provide a chance to 
delve behind the university’s published graduate employment figures and find 
out what leavers on your course go on to do.

Universities know a lot more about the destination of their graduates than 
they are required to submit to theHigher Education Statistics Agency 
<https://www.hesa.ac.uk/>. While this information only covers the employment of 
leavers six months after graduation, most universities do longitudinal surveys 
tracking graduates for three years, says Shaun Harris, acting director of 
careers at the London School of Economics.


“Ask what their graduates are doing in the longer term and the kind of 
preparation you can expect in terms of career skills and the size of their 
careers service.”

Find out, says Harris, what access the university can give to employers: “Are 
employers involved in the course? Does the university help you find internships 
or work placements? Do they hold career fairs and, if so, are they 
sector-specific? And what kind of companies and organisations attend them?”

Some degrees may lead directly to a job, some may require you to do a master’s 
to get sector-specific skills and contacts. Others, such as degrees in 
economics, accounting or planning, give you the option to study for 
professional qualifications at the same time. If this interests you, find out 
how much extra work or cost is involved.

If you’re heading for a career in the creative industries, such as film, 
television, games, animation, fashion and marketing there is a sector skills 
council –Creative Skillset <http://creativeskillset.org/> – that runs a “tick 
mark” scheme identifying courses that provide “work-ready” graduates. If a 
course doesn’t have one – and similar ones do – there may be a good reason, but 
it’s worth asking why.

The more vocational the course, the more links it should have with the 
industry, so find out how many of the lecturers have recent experience or are 
still working in the field, says Helen Charlesworth, outreach and careers 
officer at the University of Greenwich. “A lot of the computing and games 
course lecturers, for example, are still working in the industry because things 
move very fast and the department needs to keep up to date.”

The University of Keele provides graduate employment history broken down into 
53 different degree subjects. “We provide handouts for each subject about the 
jobs that people go into, the obvious and the less obvious, and the 
transferable skills they will gain,” says careers officer Patrick Greenhalgh.

“We have staff on hand to advise students about their careers, but really the 
most important thing is for them to find out whether the course is right for 
them.

“If they enjoy the course and do well in it, and get involved in student life 
– taking positions of responsibility in clubs or the student union, getting 
elected to liaise with academics or taking part in volunteering – then they 
will make themselves employable.”
