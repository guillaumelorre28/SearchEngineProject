Architects might be known for wearing black, as if in permanent mourning for 
the lives they once had, and for spending months searching for the perfect 
shade of grey. But judging by this year’s student shows, that monochromatic 
hegemony is under threat: the next generation appears to be plotting a 
psychedelic revolution.



It’s taken architecture a long time to catch up with music and fashion but it 
finally feels as thoughNew Rave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/24/new-rave-the-moment-fashion-and-music-both-got-their-act-together>
 has reached the drawing board, a decade after leg-warmers and glowsticks 
returned to the dance floor. From candy-coloured toy towns to eye-searing 
digital worlds that take their cues from early video games, this year’s 
graduates are sampling from vibrant visual cultures with promiscuous relish.

Their projects are more likely to riff on Monument Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/18/monument-valley-ipad-iphone-game-ustwo>
 orGame of Thrones <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> 
thanPeter Zumthor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/19/peter-zumthor-serpentine-gallery-pavilion>
 orGottfried Semper <https://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/semperg.htm>. There 
are echoes of Italian design groupMemphis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/18/ettore-sottsass-review-godfather-italian-cool-memphis-collective>
, with their busy patterns and paper-thin surface treatments as well as the 
dreamy, pastel-tinted lens ofWes Anderson 
<http://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/3586/wes-andersons-colour-palettes>. 
Some students have embraced comics and kids’ toys, crafting souped-upPolly 
Pocket <http://www.pollypocket.com/en-us/> worlds and dynamic action-figure 
terrains; others, with their carefully tuned palettes of complementary colours, 
have concocted spaces that would makeKim Jong-Un proud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/02/moonrise-kingdom-why-north-koreas-buildings-echo-wes-anderson-film-sets>
.

There are strains of the New Aesthetic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/18/-sp-why-digital-art-matters>
 and the slick, slippery visual memes beloved ofpost-internet art 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/22/petra-cortright-post-internet-art-los-angeles-exhibit>
. Oozing optimism and often drenched with a synthetic, saccharine sweetness, 
these escapist fantasy lands could be a response to austerity or equally a 
reaction against years of po-faced politeness.

Visual culture operates in cycles and, with even Historic England now 
considering listing postmodern buildings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/20/postmodernism-historic-england-listing-no1-poultry-mi6-building>
, ornament, wit and fun are back with a vengeance (even if the memo hasn’t 
reached the Riba awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/23/riba-awards-2016-motorway-service-station-among-uks-best-buildings>
). Whether this energy will seep out into the built environment remains to be 
seen, but you’ll need sunglasses.

 ‘Kaleidoscopic cacophony.’ Illustration: Matteo Mastrandrea 
Employing a colour scheme reminiscent of your favourite 1980s shell suit, 
Mastrandrea speculates on the consequences of global language extinction. With 
only six languages estimated to remain in the world by 2150, he proposes ways 
to keep myths and legends alive in ways that aren’t linguistic, but embedded in 
monumental landscapes. “Our ability to make clear and subtle distinctions 
between things like colour will start to suffer,” he says. “The resultant world 
will be one awash with jarring and conflicting colours.” Bring on the 
kaleidoscopic cacophony.

 ‘Synthetic, saturated world.’ Illustration: Jimmy Liu 
This undergraduate studio, taught by Ana Monrabal Cook and Luke Pearson, took 
the Japanese culture ofotaku (roughly translated as “nerd”) as its starting 
point, immersing students in the synthetic, saturated world of manga, video 
games and anime pop stars. Liu’s work samples the historical layers of Tokyo, 
from ancient Edo to the modern metropolis, and combines them into a teetering 
tower informed by comics, ink paintings and woodblock prints. He has conjured 
stage-set interiors that recall the camp colours and patterns of Memphis, 
combined with the “superflat” aesthetic ofTakashi Murakami 
<http://www.artnet.com/artists/takashi-murakami/>.

 ‘Purple-tinted underworld.’ Illustration: Aikawa Mok 
Aikawa Mok also plunged headlong into otaku culture and used the video game 
engine Unity to build a virtual world that explores the four rituals performed 
in a Shinto shrine. Inspired by the form of a Shinto donation box, her 
“Roboshrine” takes players on a journey of purification, down a spiralling 
slide in a super-glossy environment where walls graduate from cerise to teal, 
before plunging into a purple-tinted underworld.

 ‘Pomegranate factory-cum-theme park.’ Illustration: Yolanda Leung 
Leung has sampled from the realms of video games and sci-fi comics to imagine 
what a pomegranate factory-cum-theme park in the port of Marseille might look 
like. Her distinction-winning project, depicted in dynamic perspective views 
and exquisite coloured paper models, takes inspiration from children’s toys and 
pop-up books, with a gaudy palette of yellows, pinks and reds, set against a 
churning turquoise ocean.

 ‘Pastel-coloured hillside.’ Illustration: Felicity Barbur 
For a unit taught by sci-fi funsters Smout Allen <http://www.smoutallen.com/>, 
Barbur imagines an artificial mountainscape as the setting for a new river 
festival in Chicago. Taking inspiration from the city’s existing festive 
calendar, the vertical park incorporates a chunk of the Great Wall of China to 
be scaled on the lunar new year, along with a zigzagging alpine cycle path for 
the Patriotic Peloton on Memorial Day weekend. The pastel-coloured hillside is 
dotted with water towers salvaged from the city’s rooftops – all painted pink, 
natch.

 ‘Exuberant colour and geometry.’ Illustration: Henry Schofield 
These ornamental totem poles don’t immediately call to mind the world of law 
and order, but they might be what the future of policing in the City of London 
looks like if Henry Schofield has his way. “The application of exuberant colour 
and geometry to the physicality of the police force aims to generate the idea 
of exuberance in association with intimidation,” says Schofield, “whilst also 
reinventing the mass of desaturated 20th-century modernism found within the 
City of London.” Right then.

discussing global climate politics in an abandoned coal mine in the Arctic 
landscape of Svalbard. “We are living in a fast-paced society where stress is a 
new lifestyle and climate change is a global threat,” says Laitinen. What 
better way to distract yourself from environmental armageddon than with a 
zinging neon-hued discussion platform?

 .‘Highlighting oppression’ Illustration: Michael Quach 
Known for producing large-scale, incredibly detailed drawings and intricate 
paper collages, Unit 10, taught byCJ Lim <http://www.cjlim-studio8.com/>, has 
discovered colour – and gone for it full throttle. Quach’s project looks at how 
the Conservative government could exploit planning strategies to win more 
elderly votes in northern constituencies. As Quach puts it: “The urban 
development metaphorically forms the critique of social and political 
aspiration for the elderly, and highlights the oppression of the working class 
and young generation.”

communal staircases. “There is a duality to the language of the architecture,” 
says Hawes. “Fear and optimism, youth and ageing, sweet and sinister.”

 ‘Acid-doused vision.’ Illustration: Diego Ariza 
Also a product of Dip 5’s acid-doused vision, Ariza imagines what he calls a 
“kaleidoscope of linguistic celebration” in Lagos, Nigeria. Taking visual cues 
from artistMichael Craig-Martin

 and sampling motifs from some of the 200 tribal communities across west 
Africa, his drawings depict a new citadel housing a grand public arena where 
“linguistic and cultural knowledge is shared through celebration and 
traditional methods of production”.

 ‘Game of Thrones meets Barratt Homes.’ Illustration: Iain Jamieson 
Another witty project from ADS4, taught by Tom Greenall and Nicky Koller, 
Jamieson has dreamed of a world of “commuter belt castles”, where Game of 
Thrones meets Barratt Homes. Based on the observation that priced-out 
millennials might increasingly be driven to live in suburbia, he imagines a 
future where volume house-builders will adapt their product to cater for a 
generation nourished on fictional fantasy lands. Taking King’s Langley station 
as its site (geddit?), the design imagines a mixed-use scheme of housing, 
station, community services and landscapes for productive play, constructed as 
a medieval walled castle.
