Actually, lots of old people don't have grey hair, either because they colour 
it with brilliant modern methods, or they're lucky (like me) to have limited 
grey hair.

However, here's the technical stuff in answer to your question: old people 
have grey hair because of the process that controls production of a pigment 
called melanin – the same thing that makes your skin tan when you are out in 
the sun. This is what gives hair different colours, such as brown, blond or 
red. Each hair follicle (the tissue that surrounds each strand of hair) 
contains a certain number of pigment cells and, as we get older, they gradually 
begin to die. Because there are fewer pigment cells to produce melanin, hair 
starts to change colour, and the grey starts to come through.

As people continue to get older, eventually the hair will become grey all over 
– something that I hope doesn't happen to me for an extremely long time.
