. This means Floyd could receive jail time for what the state calls a “super 
extreme DUI.” The legal blood-alcohol limit in Arizona is 0.08, meaning Floyd 
was nearly three times over the limit. 

Floyd, then a member of the Arizona Cardinals, was arrested on 12 December 
hours after the Cardinals lost a game to the Miami Dolphins.He was found asleep 
at the wheel of his car

 – with the engine still running – at a traffic signal. The Cardinals cut him 
two days later and he was picked up by New England in a move that received some 
dubious applause from NFL observers, given the potential of Floyd, a former 
first-round pick.

Under Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> law, someone with 
BAC of more than .20 is subject to automatic jail time. Phoenix Suns player PJ 
Tucker spent three days in jail for an extreme DUI in 2014.

The Patriots said they were aware of the details regarding Floyd’s arrest when 
they signed him last week. “Yeah, we were aware of his situation when we 
claimed him,” the Patriots coach Bill Belichick said on Wednesday. “He’s in an 
ongoing legal situation [that] I’m not going to comment on.”
