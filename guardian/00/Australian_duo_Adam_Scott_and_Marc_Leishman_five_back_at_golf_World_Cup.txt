The Australian team of Adam Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-scott> and Marc Leishman could only 
manage one birdie in tough, windy conditions to be five shots back after the 
opening round of the golf World Cup.

Leishman missed a par attempt on the final hole at Kingston Heath as the 
Australians signed for a two-over-par 74 in the alternate-shot format.

Rafael Cabrera Bello birdied the final hole for a 69, giving him and Spanish 
teammate Jon Rahim a one-shot lead over Americans Ricky Fowler and Jimmy 
Walker, French duo Victor Dubuisson and Romain Langasque and China’s Wu Ashan 
and Li Haotong.

Scott said the tricky wind was primarily responsible for the dearth of low 
scores.

“It’s very tough to gauge exactly what’s going on out there when it’s 
blustery,” said the world No7.

“I missed my first three greens I was trying to get Marc onto so we got going 
on the back foot.

“But it’s not that bad.

“You only feel bad because you’re two over, but two under (which became three 
under) is leading.

“If you were four back after the first round of any other event, you wouldn’t 
care at all.”

Leishman said there were some positives on a mostly disappointing day.

“The conditions were tough; we shot a couple over par on a course that can eat 
you up if you do play bad,” he said.

“There were a few good signs. We hit a few bad shots but I think if we can 
make some key putts. There’s three rounds to go and there’s definitely a lot of 
golf to play.”

Scott won this event at Royal Melbourne three years ago alongside Jason Day.

The World Cup is a 72-hole stroke-play event, with the 28 two-man teams 
playing alternate-shot foursomes on Thursday and Saturday and best-ball 
fourballs on Friday and Sunday.
