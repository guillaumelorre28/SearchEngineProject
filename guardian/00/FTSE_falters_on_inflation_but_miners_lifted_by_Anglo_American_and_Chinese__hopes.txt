Leading shares are heading lower as a host of broker downgrades and higher 
than expected UK inflation outweighed positive moves from miners.

Ashtead led the way lower, down 32.5p or nearly 4% to 809.5p as analysts at 
HSBC moved their recommendation on the equipment rental group from buy to hold, 
on the basis of the age of its fleet.

Property group Intu has fallen 9p to 308.2p after Societe Generale cut its 
target price from 300p to 290p with a sell rating.

Whitbread is down 75p at £37.57 on news that Christopher Rogers was leaving as 
managing director of its Costa business, to be replaced by Dominic Paul who 
joins from Royal Caribbean.

Meanwhile Burberry has lost 27p to £12.70 after disappointing results from 
peer LVMH. Credit Suisse said:

The read-across [from LVMH] for soft luxury players is negative. Organic sales 
for the key Fashion & Leather Goods division were flat against our and market 
expectations of +3%, decelerating from +3% in the fourth quarter and +6% in 
2015. We are therefore cautious onBurberry

(underperform) reporting on 14 and 21 April.

But Anglo American is up 34.1p to 619.2p as it reported another rise in rough 
diamond sales, while other mining groups were boosted by steady copper prices 
and hopes that the Chinese economy had steadied.Glencore has climbed 5.25p to 
146.75p while BHP Billiton is 28.4p better 806.6p and Rio Tinto has risen 68p 
to 2098.5p.

Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 12.07 points to 6188.05, with UK inflation 
jumping to a 15 month high and prompting talk that UK interest rates could be 
increased sooner than expected.
