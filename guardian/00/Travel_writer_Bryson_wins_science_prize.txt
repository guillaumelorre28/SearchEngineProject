 The Â£10,000 Aventis science book prize last night went to Bill Bryson, a 
travel writer with almost no background in science. The American-born 
journalist-author of bestsellers such as Notes From A Small Island won the 
prestige-laden award for A Short History of Nearly Everything.
He won against professional scientists and communicators such as the biologist 
Matt Ridley, shortlisted for the fourth time for his highly praised Nature Via 
Nurture, and the bookies' favourite, Armand Marie Leroi, the presenter of the 
Channel 4 series Mutants, and author of the book of the same name.

Bryson's prizewinning science book grew from a moment of revelation while 
staring out of a window during a long flight across the Pacific.

"It occurred to me with a certain uncomfortable forcefulness that I didn't 
know the first thing about the only planet I was ever going to live on. I had 
no idea, for example, why the ocean was salty but the Great Lakes weren't," he 
wrote. "I didn't know what a proton was, or a protein, didn't know a quark from 
a quasar, didn't understand how geologists could look at a layer of rock on a 
canyon wall and tell you how old it was - didn't know anything, really."

His journey through modern research was reviewed warmly. "It's hard to imagine 
a better rough guide to science" said the Guardian's reviewer.
