Andy Roddick <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-roddick> warmed up for 
Wimbledon and a first-round match against Britain's Jamie Baker, with a 6-3, 
6-2 victory over Andreas Seppi to win the Aegon International title at 
Eastbourne.

The women's crown went to Tamira Paszek, who upset the odds to defeat the 
world No8 Angelique Kerber 5-7, 6-3, 7-5.

Roddick, who had accepted a wildcard entry to the tournament following his 
early exit at Queen's, was broken in the opening game of the final. But the 
American was hardly troubled again by Seppi, last year's Eastbourne champion, 
as he took a 4-1 lead before clinching the opening set.

Roddick broke Seppi twice in the second set to wrap up his 31st ATP tour 
title, and his first since winning in Memphis last year.

Paszek, the world No59, saved five match points before defeating Kerber in two 
hours 45 minutes. Paszek, who beat Marion Bartoli in the semi-final, said: "It 
was just an amazing feeling, I do not know what kept me going, how I kept 
going. I was dead tired in the third set. I could hardly move. I just gave all 
I had left, and it just was enough."
