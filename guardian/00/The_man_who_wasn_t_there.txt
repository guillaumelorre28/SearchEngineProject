While media luminaries from Rupert Murdoch to Michael Grade were happy to face 
the Lords, the committee's report is scathing about one absentee: Telegraph 
chairmanAidan Barclay <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aidanbarclay>. Despite 
four invitations he refused to appear for anything but a private and 
off-the-record chat - which never took place - saying it was not in the private 
company's "commercial interests" to share his views or strategy with 
competitors.

"We were not going to ask him about commercially sensitive issues," said 
committee chairman Lord Fowler. "You only have to say in response to a question 
'that is commercially sensitive' and we don't press that point."

"What is objectionable is that newspapers are there to reveal and disclose. I 
don't think you can then, as a proprietor of a newspaper, say 'although we ask 
all these questions we are not there to answer any you may have'."

The committee wanted to grill Aidan Barclay about the attitude of the paper's 
owners - the Barclay brothers - one of whom, Sir David, is Aidan's father. In 
stark contrast, the committee did not expect to hear from Rupert Murdoch, 
having merely requested a meeting with senior executives from News Corp. To 
their surprise Murdoch volunteered himself during the committee's trip to New 
York last year and the septuagenarian media mogul made some of the most 
forthright comments the committee heard.

"He was very frank about the position. 'There is nothing', he said, 'I can do 
as far as The Times and Sunday Times are concerned, but when it comes to the 
Sun and the News of the World then I am a traditional proprietor'," Fowler 
remembered of his meeting with Murdoch.
