festivals, record companies and executives who flourish outside the major label 
system. These acts' independence certainly doesn't make them unsuccessful: 
previous AIM honourees includeAdele <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele> 
andWiley <https://www.theguardian.com/music/wiley>, and one of this year's 
leaders, the US hip-hop duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, also feature in the 
nominations for the 2013MTV video music awards
