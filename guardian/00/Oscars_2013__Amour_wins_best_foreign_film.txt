Amour, written and directed by Michael Haneke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-haneke>, has unsurprisingly carried 
off the best foreign film Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards in LA, the category 
in which it was the hot favourite.

A French-language drama about an elderly married couple whose lives are 
shattered when one has a stroke, Amour has won a string of awards since its 
world premiere at theCannes film festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival> in 2012, where it was 
honoured with the Palme d'Or.

As well as winning the best foreign film awards at the Golden Globes and the 
Baftas,Amour <https://www.theguardian.com/film/amour> has made inroads into the 
main categories, with four other nominations including best original screenplay 
and best director for Haneke, best picture, and best actress for 85-year-old 
Emmanuelle Riva.
