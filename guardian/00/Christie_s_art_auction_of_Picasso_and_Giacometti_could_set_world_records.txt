With collectors’ appetite for masterpieces of impressionist, modern and 
contemporary art seemingly unbounded, two works are poised to challenge world 
auction records on Monday.

Pablo Picasso’s Women of Algiers (Version O), a vibrant, multi-hued painting 
featuring a scantily attired female amid smaller nudes, could sell for more 
than $140m, becoming the most expensive work of art at auction, according to 
Christie’s. The evening sale also features Alberto Giacometti’s life-size 
sculpture Pointing Man for an estimated $130m. That could earn it the title of 
most expensive sculpture sold at auction.

Experts say the once unthinkable prices are driven by artworks’ investment 
value and by wealthy new and established collectors seeking out the very best 
works.

“I don’t really see an end to it, unless interest rates drop sharply, which I 
don’t see happening in the near future,” Manhattan dealer Richard Feigen said.

Impressionist and modern artworks continue to corner the market because “they 
are beautiful, accessible and a proven value … Prices for works from these 
periods only seem to go up each auction cycle and the reputations of the 
artists become further enshrined … Today the works epitomize the conservative, 
moneyed establishment,” added Sarah Lichtman, professor of design history and 
curatorial studies at the New School.

“I think we will continue to see the financiers seeking these works out as 
they would a blue-chip company that pays reliable dividends for years to come.”

The Picasso and Giacometti are among two dozen blue-chip pieces from the 20th 
century that Christie’s is offering in a curated sale titled Looking Forward to 
the Past.

Women of Algiers, once owned by the American collectors Victor and Sally Ganz, 
was inspired by Picasso’s fascination with the 19th-century French artist 
Eugène Delacroix. It is part of a 15-work series Picasso created in 1954-1955 
designated with the letters A through O. It has appeared in several major 
museum retrospectives of the artist.

The most expensive artwork sold at auction currently is held by Francis 
Bacon’s Three Studies of Lucian Freud, which Christie’s sold for $142.4m in 
2013.

Pointing Man, depicting a skinny 5ft-high bronze figure with extended arms, 
has been in the same private collection for 45 years. Giacometti, who died in 
1966, made six casts of the work; four are in museums, the others are in 
private hands and a foundation collection. His Walking Man I holds the auction 
record for a sculpture. It sold in 2010 for $104.3m.

Among other highlights at Christie’s is Peter Doig’s Swamped, a 1990 painting 
of a solitary canoe in a moonlit lagoon that could set a record for the British 
artist. It is estimated to fetch around $20m. The current record is $18m.

Monet’s The Houses of Parliament, At Sunset, a lush painting of rich blues and 
magenta created in 1900-1901, is estimated to bring $35m to $45m. The current 
Monet auction record is his 1919 Water Lily Pond, which sold for $80.5m in 2008.

Christie’s also has a Rothko for sale. No. 36 (Black Stripe), which has never 
appeared at auction, is estimated to sell for $30m to $50m. The 1958 work is 
being sold by the German collector Frieder Burda, who exhibited it in his 
museum in Baden-Baden for several years.

Last year, Christie said its global sales of impressionist and modern art was 
$1.2bn, an increase of 19% over the previous year.
