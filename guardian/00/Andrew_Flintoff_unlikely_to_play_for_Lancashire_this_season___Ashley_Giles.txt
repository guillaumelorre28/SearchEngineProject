Andrew Flintoff <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-flintoff> is 
unlikely to play for Lancashire this season, according to the county’s head 
coach, Ashley Giles.

Flintoff made a surprise return for Lancashire last season, almost helping the 
Red Rose county to victory in the Natwest T20 Blast final

.

At last week’s launch of this year’s T20 blast, the 37-year-old Flintoff 
hinted he would sit down with Giles to discuss the possibility of featuring 
this season but his former England team-mate has revealed no such talks have 
been forthcoming.

“He is a hard person to track down. I have sent him a text but I have not 
heard anything at the moment,” Giles toldManchester Evening News 
<http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/cricket/andrew-freddie-flintoff-unlikely-play-9135387?>
. “Therefore, if I was hedging my bets, I would say no, he won’t play a role 
this summer.”
