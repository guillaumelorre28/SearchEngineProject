Following the lecture he delivered last night to the Royal Society on the 
subject of A Short History of Nearly Everything, his 2004 Aventis prize-winning 
book,Bill Bryson <https://www.theguardian.com/books/billbryson> announced the 
names of the authors who made it on to this year's 13-strong longlist.

The longlist for the 2005 Aventis Prizes for Science Books' general prize, 
which recognises the best in popular science writing, includes The Human Mind, 
the latest book from chair of the 2004 judging panel Robert Winston, and The 
Ancestor's Tale, Richard Dawkins' exploration of evolutionary biology. This is 
Dawkins' third appearance on the Aventis longlist; on both previous occasions, 
his books (River out of Eden (1996) and Climbing Mount Improbable (1997)) have 
gone on to feature on the shortlist, an achievement he will be looking to 
replicate this year. None of the longlisted authors has taken the general prize 
before.

Bill Bryson is chairing this year's judging panel, and is joined on it by 
weather forecaster and presenter Lisa Burke; Sian Ede, an authority on art and 
science interactions; broadcaster, neurophysiologist and lecturer Mark Lythgoe; 
and Ruth Padel, scholar, poet and chair of the Poetry Society.

"It was an honour to chair this year's prizes after winning last year and I 
now know what a difficult job it is to choose a longlist," Bryson commented 
following the announcement. "The quality of books submitted this year was 
superb, with entries from a fascinating range of subject areas including 
brainwashing, the physics of society and drug control."

The winner will be announced at a ceremony at the Royal Society on May 12.
