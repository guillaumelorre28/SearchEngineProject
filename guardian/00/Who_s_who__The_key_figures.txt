Tough-talking detective, joined police in 1978 in Essex. Ten years later made 
a commander in the Met and put in charge of Operation Trident, set up to 
investigate gun crime in the black community. Was chief constable of Norfolk 
before returning to London as assistant commissioner for specialist operations 
in 2005 and has been in overall charge of terrorist investigations. Forced to 
apologise last year to two brothers who were freed without charge after an 
anti-terror raid in east London. Days later he was controversially awarded CBE.

Jean Charles de Menezes

The 27-year-old arrived in the UK from Brazil in 2002 and started work as an 
electrician. He had grown up in the town of Gonzaga in the state of Minas 
Gerais. At the age of 14 Mr Menezes moved to Sao Paulo, where he went to school 
and became a qualified electrician.

Sir Ian Blair

Appointed Met commissioner in February 2005, Sir Ian has been at the forefront 
with ideas of how to modernise the police service. But as well as Stockwell, he 
has been mired in controversies. He had to apologise after saying "almost 
nobody" could understand why the Soham murders had become such a big story.

Nick Hardwick

The former chief executive of the Refugee Council and the homelessness charity 
Centrepoint was appointed chairman of the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission in 2004. For the first time civilian commissioners rather than 
senior police have taken direct charge of investigations.
