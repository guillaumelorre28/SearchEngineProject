Australian shoppers will splurge more than $2bn on retail therapy if Boxing 
Day sale predictions pan out.

Retailers expect shops around the country will take in more than $16bn over 
the next three weeks, including a $2.072bn boon on Boxing Day alone.

If so, it would be the first time Australian shoppers have spent more than 
$2bn in a single day.

Victorian consumers will lead the post-Christmas shopping binge according to 
the Australian Retailers Association (ARA), spending about $682m on Boxing Day 
while NSW is expected to fork out $584m.

ARA executive director Russell Zimmerman slammed “ludicrous” retail 
regulations in NSW preventing shops outside Sydney’s CBD from opening their 
doors early on Boxing Day.

“NSW is Australia’s most populous state, and yet Victoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> easily takes the cake 
when it comes to expected Boxing Day sales,” Zimmerman said on Thursday.

“This equals a $98m loss of trade to NSW retailers, with absurd and outdated 
trading restrictions largely to blame. Consumers can buy online 24/7 but many 
bricks and mortar stores are still unable to open on, what is for many, the 
largest trading day of the year.”

Australian shoppers aged 14 or older will spend an average of $850 each 
between Boxing Day and 15 January.

Shopping centres are opening their doors earlier on Boxing Day to accommodate 
the influx of shoppers, with David Jones stores in Sydney and Melbourne CBDs 
opening at 5am.
