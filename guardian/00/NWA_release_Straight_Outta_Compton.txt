The controversy that had begun to dog rap music hit new heights in 1988. 
Eazy-E's LA collective were at the forefront, thanks to their aggressive sound 
and the song-cum-slogan, Fuck tha Police, that made clear the antipathy young 
urban black people felt towards law enforcement. The FBI complained to Profile 
Records about the song but the label received support in Congress. Straight 
Outta Compton flew off the shelves.
