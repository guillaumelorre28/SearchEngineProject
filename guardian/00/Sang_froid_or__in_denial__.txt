You have to admire her pluck. This was Anita Roddick, announcing yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2013501,00.html> that as a result 
of hepatitis C infection, she is suffering from cirrhosis of the liver - a very 
serious condition which will, almost certainly, shorten her life: "It's a bit 
of a bummer but you groan and move on."

Who would have thought that the entrepreneur who brought us a new-agey range 
of body rubs

 that might seem more appropriate as flavours for fruit sorbets would emerge as 
a leading exponent of the British stiff upper lip?

You might be excused for thinking that we'd all become touchy-feely emoters 
these days, but Anita's impressive show of phlegm suggests that there's still 
some grit in us Brits. What do you think?
