Shares in Lavendon, which hires out aerial work platforms, have slumped nearly 
12% after its would-be suitors decided to walk away.

Last week UK group Ashtead and Belgium's TVH Services made a 115p a share, 
Â£183m cash offer for Lavendon, topping a previous TVH bid of 111p made in 
December. But today Ashtead said the two partners had decided not to go ahead 
with a bid, after Lavendon rejected it as undervaluing the business.Ashtead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ashteadgroup> said:
 The approach was subject to...due diligence and the recommendation of the 
board of Lavendon. Lavendon's rejection means these pre-conditions cannot be 
fulfilled and as a result the joint acquirers will not proceed with an offer.
The news has left Lavendon 13p lower at 96.25p, but Ashtead has added 10p to 
169.2p. Panmure Gordon said: With few other likely buyers, we believe Lavendon 
will now trade closer to fundamental valuations once again. We reduce our 
target price back to pre-bid levels of 80p and, at current levels, change our 
recommendation from hold to sell. 
On Ashtead, Hector Forsythe at Oriel Securities welcomed the decision not to 
go ahead with the bid:
 We saw the strategic rationale for this move, but of course is comes at a 
time of improved optimism and therefore price was always likely to be hard to 
reconcile. We are please to see Ashtead's discipline in setting in the approach 
such a clear view on value. Attention can now get back to the potential of the 
opportunity in the US.
