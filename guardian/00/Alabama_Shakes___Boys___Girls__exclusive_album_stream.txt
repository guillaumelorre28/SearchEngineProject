Alabama Shakes <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alabama-shakes> were the 
band every man and his BBQ beef brisket were trying to catch at this year's 
SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. That's hardly a surprise considering their 
reputation as a phenomenal live act, especially in the US.

Comprising the devastating vocal talent of Brittany Howard, alongside 
guitarist Heath Fogg, drummer Steve Johnson and bassist Zac Cockrell, Boys & 
Girls sees them distilling their slow-burning, soulful sound on record. Both 
classic and fresh, it is likely to be one of this year's most critically adored 
albums.

The Guardian recently visited the band in their hometown of Athens, Alabama, 
to hear how they're currently "having a hell of a time" – you can read about it 
in this Saturday's Guardian. Until then, give their debut album a spin using
