So, Laura, let's start with one of your most defining features, your hair
There's a story here. I begged my mum for years to let me have braids, and she 
finally said yes when I was a teenager, and I really loved them. Then, I had my 
first weave at university but, looking back, the hair was far too dark for me, 
although I did enjoy how soft and straight it was. Then came the pivotal 
moment: I went on an exchange trip to New York and met a girl out there who had 
the most amazing hair I'd ever seen. She told me it was relaxed, a process I'd 
avoided up until this point due to being a total wuss – I'd heard it was really 
painful. But, this girl said she'd do it for me and that she did hers all the 
time. I phoned my mum for advice, and she said to definitely have it done at a 
salon. Obviously, I thought I knew better and ignored her.

What happened?
She put on the relaxer and was halfway through my hair before I stopped her. I 
knew it shouldn't hurt this much – my scalp was on fire. By the time she'd 
finished the whole head my scalp was severely damaged and the chemicals had 
burned pot-holes in my head. I lost a lot of hair and it was a very steep, 
painful learning curve.

What did you do?
I wore wigs for a while after that, which was actually fun. But since then 
I've seen how complex the issue of hair is for black women, especially in the 
west. I love that filmGood Hair by Chris Rock 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m-4qxz08So> and I'm certainly one of those 
women who has had an interesting hair journey.

Sounds like it. What did you do when it grew back?
I was getting married straight after university and my mum said I had to have 
hair for my wedding day [laughs]. So, I had the front relaxed, and a hairpiece 
at the back. After my wedding, I tried the Rihanna half-weave/half-shave look 
for a while. Then, came my big turning point. I bumped into my cousin after 
she'd shaved her hair very short and she looked incredible. She seemed so 
effortless and cool and I wanted that. And, I've had it like that ever since. 
In fact, today is hair day; it's about 5mm long now, which is way too long 
[laughs], so I'm off to have it cut.

Let's talk about skin, was yours problematic growing up?
When I was a teenager I had terrible acne, right until my early twenties. My 
aunty said thatBio Oil <http://www.bio-oil.com/en/> would help and it did 
wonders for my complexion, so I still use that – and little else really.

That's so low-maintenance. I use about 10 skincare products a day.
Really? See I thought even that was quite high-maintenance.

So when did you start getting into makeup?
I bought my first bit of makeup at 16 when my parents let me, but it was just 
a few items, inspired byEasther from Eternal 
<http://www.wotyougot.com/pictures//2011/12/happy-39th-birthday-easther-bennett.jpeg>
 – I wanted my hair and makeup to look like hers. I made mistakes all the time 
though. My friends would say "Can I do your makeup?" and you learn, pretty 
quickly, that what works on them doesn't work on you. But for me, it was a red 
lip that never really worked. I envy those who can wear red lipstick or any 
bold lip colour really. My top lip just doesn't seem to take colour – there's 
nothing I can do to change that, so I usually just use a nude on the bottom lip.

I really struggled to find the foundation that matched my skin when I was 
younger – did you?
Oh yes. I started buying foundations with what I could afford as a teenager. I 
could never find my shade on the high street, that was a given, but black hair 
shops soldSleek <http://www.sleekmakeup.com/>, which I still use today. When I 
was a teenager I toured with this glamorous a cappella group and they always 
wore makeup. They were majorly intoBobbi Brown <http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/> 
and I'd steal bits from them. As I got older I discoveredMac 
<http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/> and never looked back. But, I still use Sleek 
foundation; I wear my makeup quite heavy and matte, and Sleek is the thickest 
foundation I've found.

What's your absolute makeup essential?
I like a dramatic pink blusher, usually Mac or Sleek. Because my hair is 
short, it gives me licence to go overboard everywhere else [laughs]. In my 
mind, anyway.

What's your one failsafe beauty tip?
I like pastels and lighter shades on darker skins. I feel like it lifts 
everything and accentuates being chocolate.

No plum lipsticks for you!
No way. My makeup artist [Gabby Ciullo] knows the kind of colours I like, but 
if I have to use another artist theyalways opt for plum lips and gold eyes. 
They just see my hair and say "Grace Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/picture/2013/jul/03/grace-jones-wimbledon>
". But that's not my style at all. I like that nude shades on darker skins are 
unexpected, and they're beautiful.

What else is in your makeup bag right, now?
[Rummages] Always perfume. I wore Chance by Chanel 
<http://www.chanel.com/en_GB/fragrance-beauty/Fragrance-Chance-95382> on my 
wedding day so that's my default. Also,DKNY Woman 
<http://www.boots.com/en/DKNY/DKNY-Women/> smells like you've just had a bath, 
which is brilliant for on the road. So you always feel fresh, and not like a 
sweaty hipopotamus.

Do you have a more modern beauty icon?
I've been inspired by Solange Knowles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2013/feb/11/grammys-2013-what-the-stars-wore-in-pictures#/?picture=403839423&index=12>
 recently, her makeup is nude, or, she just wears a daring lip colour. It just 
looks so fresh and modern.

OK Laura, what's your final word on beauty?
I love my complexion but like so many of us, in the early years at primary 
school, I grew up thinking that my dark skin wasn't a great thing. I've found 
freedom in music and songwriting, which has given me a freedom in how I present 
myself. I'm glad I've got makeup to celebrate that with. It's never about 
covering up and always about being authentic and celebrating what you have, and 
what you enjoy.
