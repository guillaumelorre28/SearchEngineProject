England and Australia are to play Ashes series back to back in 2013-14, 
according to Cricinfo, with the next series down under being brought forward by 
a year.

Not since 1974-75, when England lost a six-match away series 4-1 before 
falling 1-0 at home, have the two sides played 10 Tests in a row or 
back-to-back series against each other.

The 2015 World Cup is to be held in Australia and had the Ashes series due for 
2014-15 not been moved England would have had a five-month tour of one country.

Back-to-back series could have been avoided had the 2013 Ashes in England been 
brought forward a year, but the London Olympics ruled out such a move. However, 
the following series in England is set to be in 2015.
