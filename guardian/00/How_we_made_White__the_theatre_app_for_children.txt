Can the experience of live theatre be extended with an app? How can an app 
reflect an original show? What should the approach be when the audience are 
very young children? Those were just some of the questions we considered when 
we madeWhite, the app 
<http://www.catherinewheels.co.uk/productions/White+The+App>.

I'm the producer of Catherine Wheels <http://www.catherinewheels.co.uk/>, a 
touring theatre company based in Scotland. We've been producing theatre for 
children and young people since 1999, butWhite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/sep/01/white-edinburgh-review> was 
our first venture into making theatre for very young audiences. It's aimed at 
children aged 2 to 4-years-old, so we were delighted and surprised in equal 
measure when it became the hit of the Edinburgh festival fringe in 2010 and 
went on to tour the world.

What also surprised and delighted us was the strength of the audience 
response. It was clear they loved the show and through social media, we were 
getting requests from parents and carers asking us for a video of the 
performance. We wanted to respond to that desire to extend the experience. We 
didn't have the budget to produce a film, and even if we did, we weren't 
convinced that a film would be the answer.

We wanted to provide an experience that would be creative as well as 
reflecting the artistic integrity of the show. First, we thought about creating 
a book and then we began to think about an app.

We were lucky that we didn't have to look far for a developer. We had worked 
with Jonathan Charles and Simone Bloomfield fromHippotrix 
<http://www.hippotrix.com/> in a different capacity (as film-makers) on several 
theatre projects.

They had just set up the development company and launched their first app, 
Hippo Seasons <http://www.hippotrix.com/apps/seasons/>, which was also aimed at 
young children. They were the obvious choice. It felt like an evolution in our 
creative partnership rather than the tricky business of trying to develop a 
brand new relationship on a brand new project. It was about trust from the 
outset.

The process started with the creator of the show, Andy Manley, in a room with 
me, Jonathan and Simone. We decided very quickly that we didn't want to go down 
the route of trying to tell the story – we kept talking about creating the 
"world" of White, rather than the "story" of White.

It was at this point that we made the biggest decision in the creative 
process: the characters in the play, Cotton and Wrinkle, would not appear in 
the app. In effect, the child would take on their collective role. As theatre 
makers, this was a difficult decision, but we had to remember that we were not 
making a theatrical experience.

In the next stage, Jonathan and Simone turned the ideas from those initial 
meetings into a story board that we presented to the rest of the creative team 
– we could finally visualise it.

One of the greatest challenges in making the app was maintaining the feel of 
the original production. Jonathan and Simone worked very closely with the 
White's designer, Shona Reppe. They painstakingly photographed all the 
individual elements of the show's set to capture her original design intention. 
It was a time consuming process, but has given the app the same tactile 
"homespun" feel that makes the show so charming.

The result is an app that genuinely reflects the world we created with the 
theatre production. We're very proud that it actually feels like White, the 
show. I was worried that we would perhaps lose the charm and texture of the 
performance in the process of digitising that world, but early downloads have 
been good and the response has been even better.
