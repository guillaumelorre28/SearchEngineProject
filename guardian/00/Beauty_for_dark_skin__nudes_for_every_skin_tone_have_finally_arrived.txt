Here's the backstory. We saw the beauty industry shift, seismically around 
2011 when foundations for a huge spectrum of skin tones finally became 
available on the high-street. Cue celebratory high-fives and merriment all 
round. Now, the people who make nude polishes have come to the realisation that 
we don't all fall under the "one shade suits all" bracket for nails, either.

For me, nude polish has always been a gargantuan letdown. It's generally 
streaky, the wrong shade, as far as I'm concerned, and just doesn't suit darker 
skins. I'd relegated it to one of life's slightly racist annoyances, along with 
skin-toned underwear (I've only ever seen brown underwear in the US), nude 
tights (the same), even the common plaster (we're not all peachy pink). 
Irritating, but there are bigger battles to fight.

Enter the trend for mannequin nails (that's nails the same colour as your 
skin) in 2012, and seasons later we're still seeing nude tones at the fashion 
weeks. Put simply, nude nails will not become passé any time soon.

People seldom "enjoy" their hair and makeup, except for the occasional glance 
in a mirror or car window. But glancing down at your perfectly painted nails 
(now, that's a skill in itself: two coats, two minutes in between and Seche 
Vite topcoat) sends a surge of togetherness rippling through you. Even if your 
boss has just publicly trounced you and everything else in your life is crap.

I've added the Nails Inc shade below into my repertoire. It's a welcome, 
easy-to-apply shade just slightly lighter than my own skin tone. Choose your 
own from the following selection. Or don't. It's just nice to have options, 
isn't it?
