The Dutch rider Wouter Poels broke away to win the Volta a Catalunya fifth 
stage while Nairo Quintana defended his overall lead on Friday.

Poels of Sky escaped from a small group on a mild ascent near the end and 
finished the mostly downhill 187km (116 mile) stage from Rialp to Valls in just 
under four hours.

“I was actually really tired at the start, but in the break I was feeling 
good,” Woels said. “I attacked on the last climb to see what would happen.”

It was Poels’ third stage win of the season. Dario Cataldo crossed along with 
the rest of the chasers more than 10 seconds later.

Quintana and his nearest title rivals Alberto Contador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> and Richie Porte finished 
in a group around half a minute off Poel’s pace.

Contador shaved one second off Quintana’s lead by winning an intermediate 
sprint. The Colombian is seven seconds ahead of Contador with two stages to go.

“I expected Contador to try to get back more time,” Quintana said. “With him 
you always have to be attentive, as we saw in the intermediate sprint. He won’t 
make it easy for us to win this tour.”

Porte, the defending champion, remained third at 17 seconds back. The Tour de 
France winnerChris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> 
stayed in eighth and is 46 seconds behind Quintana, who took over the lead in 
the Pyrenees on Thursday.

The sixth stage on Saturday is the longest of the race, a mainly flat 197.2km 
(122.5 mile) ride from Sant Joan Despí to Vilanova i la Geltrú on the 
Mediterranean coast.

The week-long race through northeastern Spain ends in Barcelona on Sunday.
