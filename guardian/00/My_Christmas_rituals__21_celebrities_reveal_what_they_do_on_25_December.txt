We’re not religious in my house, which is a shame in some ways, as there’s a 
defined set of Christmas rituals involved when you are. When I was a kid, my 
French grandmother used to take me to midnight mass onChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> Eve and it always felt 
special and, above all, fun. There was a sense of ceremony to it and there was 
the added bonus that I got to stay up way past my bedtime.

Our Christmases were quite rock’n’roll: loads of family around, loud, boozy, 
lots of dancing. My parents had me when they were 18 or 19 so they’ve always 
liked a party. They see a lot of bands and they’re obsessed with the Rolling 
Stones – they’re the religion in our house – so every Christmas to this day 
we’ll put on the Stones and have a good dance about.

We used to have lots of my parents’ friends around and my cousins, who are 
about my age, would be there, so we’d all have a party. There’s a nine-year age 
gap between me and my brother Michael, so before he came along I was quite 
spoilt. I think it’s that working-class thing where your parents pile you high 
with presents that one time of year. To this day, they always insist on buying 
me too many presents. Even when I ask them not to get me anything, they’ll give 
me money – I don’t need it!

I finally had someone to share Christmas with when Michael arrived. I remember 
one year, when he was four, Mum and I decided to trick him: she dressed up as 
Father Christmas and the idea was that she’d creep around the garden while he 
and I watched out the window in awe and wonder – he knew it was her straight 
away.

We went through a stage of making art at Christmas – drawing together or 
making short films where Dad would be the cameraman and my mum, brother and I 
would act out a few scenes. We still do it some years. Five years ago my 
brother grew a moustache and we all teased him mercilessly. In the end we 
dressed him up as Freddie Mercury and got him to climb through the window 
before we all got up and had a dance to Queen for the camera. The idea was that 
we’d all been so bored until Freddie Mercury walked into our lives.

As we’ve got older, our Christmases have become a little less raucous. It’s a 
lot to do with the fact that neither Michael nor I have had children yet – 
Christmas really is for kids, isn’t it? We still stay at my parents’ place in 
south London. It’s a big mix of people who join us: friends, a few extended 
family members, and we’ve also taken to adopting all the Australians in our 
lives who don’t fly back there for the holidays. We take in my best friend and 
tour manager, who are both from there, along with a few other Aussie strays – 
it’s slowly becoming one of our family traditions. My mum will cook a ludicrous 
amount of food; she makes way too many options that none of us can possibly 
begin to get through.

This year we’re making a change: we’re going to Jamaica en masse – me, my 
girlfriend, my parents and my brother. We’ve never been away for Christmas, and 
I thought it would be nice to go somewhere hot and do something totally new. My 
mum is so excited, and my brother and I will have just finished our UK tour, so 
I figured it’s what we’d all need: a relaxing, hot Christmas. As long as we’re 
all together, it’ll be a laugh.

My parents’ way of handling Christmas was, as I’ve discovered, slightly 
different. Every year they “sent” money to Santa for the presents. They told us 
how much they were sending off that year and we’d send a list that matched the 
figure, to the penny. I think it was supposed to make us learn the value of 
money from an early age. So Santa, to us, was just the very jolly delivery man 
who sometimes also turned up in the Fenwick’s toy department.

Often I’m so busy I don’t have a chance to get excited about Christmas until 
Christmas Eve – then I can really relax. Traditionally I spend Christmas Eve 
with old friends; we cook a glazed ham, dauphinoise potatoes and red cabbage. 
And then we’ll have some Vacherin and a few light clementines to finish.

I wasn’t aware of our Christmas eccentricities until I got married to Richard 
[Jones] and had to introduce him to my family. We do something called tree 
presents: little gifts that hang from the tree. We do main presents in the 
morning, and once everyone’s full of lunch and kind of lounging around, we do 
the tree presents. They’re very annoying to buy, because they need to be 
thoughtful but not too nice, and light enough to hang up. Usually they’re a bit 
rubbish: a printed rubber or a nice soap, and you have to have a good age 
range. There can be quite a few of us – up to 20: we have both our families, 
and then the odd waif or stray. The other thing we do, and I’m blushing 
slightly as I confess this, is to sing when the Christmas pudding has been lit 
with the brandy. We have to carry it around the house and then sing: “Here 
comes the Christmas pudding” to the tune of “For he’s a jolly good fellow”. I 
don’t really know why.

My husband is Swedish, so we celebrate Christmas on the 24th. We have 
traditional straw figures on the tree and a smorgasbord: herring, gravadlax, 
beetroot, raw egg, meatballs, cheese, hard bread. There’s a lot of schnapps and 
we sing Swedish drinking songs. Well, I fake most of them. On Christmas Day we 
have a roast goose and walk on the cliffs in Cornwall – the Christmas Day 
charity swim is always hysterical to watch.

My father always pretends to hate Christmas. But when we were children he was 
the first one waking us up, saying: “Do you think Father Christmas has been 
yet?” Even though I’m 40, when I’m lying in bed on Christmas morning my father 
will ring at about 6am and say: “Has he been to you yet?”

I grew up in Lima, Peru, so we had traditional, religious influences. We 
celebrated on Christmas Eve; Christmas Day was our Boxing Day. My grandmother 
would send a hamper down from the Andes, including a live turkey, and the 
adults would give the turkey a drink of pisco before saying “bye-bye”. The 
adults would drink copious amounts of pisco sours, so by the time we’d get to 
church around 10pm they’d be pretty refreshed.

Although we’re Jewish, my mother was quite Christian when it came to 
Christmas. She extended the welcome to everybody, so she’d always invite Jewish 
strays and patients of my father, who was a doctor, for Christmas Day. Usually 
we’d have about 10 people, and one of the families was the Levys, who were my 
father’s patients, and a very old lady who lived to 102. We also had a 
frightfully posh lady called Mrs Treaves who thought she was slumming it with 
us, but somehow mixed in with all the old East End Jews. The ritual I found 
most fun was defeathering the turkey, which we often got from the covered 
market in Oxford. My mother could draw the bird herself, and she’d serve it 
with chopped liver and sweet and sour cucumbers – a real fusion of English and 
Jewish food. We’d talk animatedly, tell jokes, listen to the King’s speech, and 
the next day we’d use the feet to make a ravishing turkey soup. Nowadays I 
don’t celebrate Christmas – I’m a militant atheist – and the idea of people 
spending money they can’t afford buying presents for people they don’t like 
doesn’t appeal. My partner Heather and I usually stay in our house in the 
southern highlands of Australia and try to pretend it’s not happening. We’ll 
watch a film, go for a walk and eat some very normal food.

truffle shaved over turkey.

In Argentina Christmas Eve is more important than Christmas Day, so when I was 
younger the whole family would arrive for a proper Latino get-together. We’d 
have a barbecue by the swimming pool from 8pm and then at midnight we’d watch 
fireworks. Afterwards we would go back to the Christmas tree and all the 
presents would have appeared. Now I have Christmases in London and find it 
magical performing at this time of year.

I suppose it’s a bit unusual but I’ve been known to go for a jog on Christmas 
morning – sporty to the end! My brother is Type 1 diabetic, so exercise is a 
good way to help him manage the turkey and potatoes that follow. Other than 
that we’re very traditional: presents as soon as we wake up, a buck’s fizz, and 
perhaps a pint of Guinness in the pub while we’re waiting for the turkey to 
cook. It’s always been a time to see my family. Even at the height of the Spice 
Girls, when we had three Christmas number ones in a row, Christmas was when we 
always went home. There are a few arguments along the way, of course, but 
that’s part of the experience.

The one thing we’ve always done, since before I was born, is to have an 
Italian dish made by my grandmother called anolini – little round parcels of 
pasta stuffed with braised veal and beef, served in a meat broth – as a starter 
on Christmas Day. I remember eating it as a child, but since my grandmother 
passed away my mum, aunt, cousins and I make it together in the days leading up 
to Christmas. One of us is given responsibility to prepare the filling, which 
takes a while. I tend to make the pasta and someone else is on broth duty. Then 
we bring it all together on the morning for 20 people – a proper Italian-sized 
family.

We go on a treasure hunt on Boxing Day – 28 of us last year, as my parents 
have eight children between them – organised by my youngest brother and his 
wife. It’s fiendishly difficult and takes us on to neighbours’ land, local golf 
courses, the village common and so on. It’s an excuse for a long walk after so 
much eating and drinking, really, but does involve considerable intellectual 
exertion, too, so it’s good to go with someone like my wife, Susan Gilchrist, 
who has a crossworder’s brain. The ultimate prize is usually alcoholic, but 
pride is at stake.

We’re Jewish, so Christmas was always a bit conflicted in our house. My mother 
insisted that we all do charity work on Christmas morning, but then my father, 
who loved all the Dickensian wonder that came with Christmas, insisted that we 
have a traditional lunch. Now that I have my own family, I find that I walk the 
thin line my parents did. We have 20 people over – I brine a turkey the night 
before with cloves and wine, and then we really go for it on the lunch front. 
We don’t have a Christmas tree, though – we have a Hanukkah bush that we throw 
a bit of tinsel on, and we stick a fairy on top.

We always do a personalised Christmas card, which people seem to like. This 
year it’s this photograph of my partner Neil and me in Fortnum & Mason’s 
Christmas department. Last year was a cartoon: we were on the Christmas tree, 
if I can remember rightly. And years and years ago, when I was on my own, I was 
dressed as a fairy on a No 30 bus going through London. Now that was silly 
because I had to have someone at the next bus stop taking the photograph as I 
arrived. I usually have all the presents done by 1 December, as that’s when I 
start rehearsing panto. I give a card and a bottle of champagne to all the cast 
and crew. On actual Christmas Day I’m too exhausted to host, so I go to see my 
goddaughters in Oxford. We start with champagne and caviar in the morning and 
have a wonderful lunch, but my favourite bit is going into the kitchen at 10 
o’clock and picking at all the debris left over from the food.

 Jack and Michael Whitehall. 
My great Christmas tradition is my father trying, and recently failing, to 
make me and my brothers and sisters stand for the Queen’s speech; he also 
insists on silence. Certainly there is to be no present-opening or 
cracker-pulling – the ultimate signs of disrespect. The only other real 
tradition we have is my dad telling us that Christmas TV has been shit ever 
since Morecambe and Wise. It includes any show I might happen to be involved in 
– the Christmas episode of Bad Education last year got a frosty reception from 
Whitehall Senior.
Jack Whitehall Gets Around: Live at Wembley Arena is out tomorrow. The new 
series of Backchat starts on BBC Two in January

 Helen MacDonald on a Christmas walk. 
I always do a lone walk up Noar Hill, a medieval chalk quarry near my mother’s 
house in Hampshire. It’s famous for rare orchids and butterflies and in the 
summer can resemble an amateur naturalists’ convention, but on winter mornings 
it’s deserted. I walk uphill across rabbit tracks, past juniper bushes and 
frozen briars. At the crest I lean against a beech tree trunk and stare out 
across miles of air to the South Downs. I suppose, and more so since my 
father’s death, that it’s a walk about the closing of the year– a time to think 
of what is past, what is lost and what’s still to come.

 Rafe and Timothy Spall. 
I’ve got two children now and I’m facing the question: when do you stop going 
over to mum and dad’s? The conventional Spall family Christmas is dinner on 
Christmas Eve with 15 family and friends. My mother makes crackers that have 
forfeits in them: you have to sing a song or something, and everyone dreads 
them. She also makes matured Christmas puddings – by the time we eat them, 
they’re four years old. On the 25th we have a huge English fry-up followed by a 
present-opening bonanza then leftovers with chips. For dessert we fry the 
leftover Christmas pudding in a pan with clotted cream.

 Craig Revel Horwood in his first car. 
This photo shows me in my first car, a Christmas present. I remember receiving 
it so clearly – I loved it. I passed my driving test three years ago, so it 
only took 46 years to make this a reality. I grew up in Australia, so Christmas 
was hot. One year all my chocolates melted together in my Christmas stocking. 
In the 1970s the microwave changed dinner forever. My dad, who was in the navy, 
would make dinner in the morning, plate up a meal for each of us and put it 
under clingfilm with our name on top. He’d put the plates in a row by the 
microwave and at lunch he’d heat them. We’d line up and be served at 
three-minute intervals and then file off to the table. If your dinner was the 
first one microwaved it was pretty lonely when you sat down to eat.

 Ashley Jensen with a bird in the hand. 
Now that I have a five-year-old daughter I find myself trying to recreate how 
we had Christmas when I was little. My grandparents lived with us, and my gran 
made the Christmas meal, so now it has to be the same food she made: prawn 
cocktail as a starter, devils on horseback – it’s a 70s vibe. She used to do a 
trifle. I’m thinking of doing jelly with tinned mandarin segments this year.
