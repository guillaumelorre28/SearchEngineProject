The BBC will briefly be distracted from the Jeremy Clarkson controversy on 
Wednesday as the 25th anniversary of its feature film arm,BBC Films 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfilms/>, is celebrated with a reception at the Radio 
Theatre inside its New Broadcasting House building in central London.

Set up as a separate entity in 1990, with its first “official” production the 
Anthony Minghella-directed romance Truly Madly Deeply, starring Juliet 
Stevenson and Alan Rickman, BBC Films has had a hand in more than 250 films in 
a wide variety of formats and genres: from popular TV spin-offs such as Alan 
Partridge: Alpha Papa, Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Movie and In the Loop, to 
boundary-pushing art films such as Andrea Arnold’s Red Road, Lynne Ramsay’s 
Ratcatcher and Derek Jarman’s Edward II.

BBC Films is currently headed by Christine Langan, who recently accepted a 
special Bafta award 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/08/baftas-2015-bbc-films-christine-langan>
 to BBC Films for outstanding British contribution to cinema. Langan has been 
in post since 2009, overseeing projects such as Ramsay’s adaptation of Lionel 
Shriver’s novel We Need to Talk About Kevin; like Tessa Ross, her former 
counterpart at Channel 4’s Film Four, Langan has a reputation for nurturing new 
talent and developing challenging work.

Langan said: “Britain has a wealth of incredible film-making talent and it’s 
never been more important for the BBC to support, promote and celebrate it.” 
BBC director-general Tony Hall commented: “BBC Films represents everything I 
love about the BBC. What started as just a small part of our drama department 
25 years ago has grown into a creative powerhouse recognised the world over.”

 Film trailer: In the Loop 
For Matt Mueller, editor of film industry trade magazine Screen International, 
BBC Films “have a small budget compared to the BBC’s TV operation but managed 
to be very successsful – they may be a small cog in a bigger machine, but they 
are hugely important in the film industry, as one of three main sources of 
development funding.

“They have done a good job in marrying TV and film talent, and not been afraid 
to back films aimed at a broader, crossover audence, compared to Film4 and BFI. 
That perhaps means they are seen as slightly less edgy, but they have different 
service requirement than the others. You have to give them their due.”

The company also took the opportunity to confirm a number of its upcoming 
projects. Armando Iannucci, together with Simon Blackwell, his collaborator on 
Veep and In the Loop, have been commissioned to make a new adaptation of 
Charles Dickens’ 1850 novel David Copperfield; The Sense of an Ending, Julian 
Barnes’ Man Booker prize winning novel, is to be filmed by Indian director 
Ritesh Batra, with a script by playwright Nick Payne (Constellations); while 
Colin Firth is confirmed to play Donald Crowhurst in a film about the 
yachtman’s disastrous attempt to take part in the Sunday Times Golden Globe 
Race in 1968-9, to be directed by Theory of Everything’s James Marsh.
