Fernando Gonzalez will play Tommy Haas in the semi-finals of the Australian 
Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> after upsetting second 
seed Rafael Nadal in three quick sets.

Nadal, showing signs of fatigue after his gruelling five-set victory over 
Andrew Murray earlier in the week, never really got going against tenth seed 
Gonzalez, slumping to a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 defeat in little more than two hours.

Gonzalez had clearly taken note of Murray's tactics and refused to allow Nadal 
to settle into any sort of rhythm. He broke the Spaniard in the fifth game of 
the first set and although Nadal had a break point to strike back immediately 
in the next game, he was unable to capitalise, allowing the 10th seed to go on 
and break again to clinch the set. One break in each of the next two sets then 
proved enough for Gonzalez to clinch the match.

Nadal's exit means that top seed Roger Federer, who plays sixth seed Andy 
Roddick in the other semi-final, will be the only one of the top five seeds to 
reach the final four, after Tommy Haas dispatched third seed Nikolay Davydenko 
earlier in the day.

Haas had things a lot tougher than Nadal mind, needing five sets, during which 
he saved a match point, to secure the victory.

Despite losing the first set, Davydenko, who has never made it past the 
quarter-finals of the tournament, looked to have taken control of the match as 
he claimed the second and third in quick succession, but Haas dug deep to take 
the final two and seal a 6-3, 2-6, 1-6, 6-1, 7-5 triumph.
