Two-time champion Alberto Contador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> has pulled out of the Tour 
de France during the ninth stage due to a fever.

Slightly more than 100km from the end of the stage, the Spaniard stopped at 
the side of the road, hopped off his bike and got into the passenger seat of 
his team car.

Contador crashed in each of the opening stages and had lost time on the other 
overall favourites.

He was in 20th position at the end of Saturday’s eighth stage, 3 minutes, 12 
seconds behind leader Chris Froome.

After early participation in a breakaway attempt Contador dropped back to his 
team car during Sunday’s stage four times before finally withdrawing.

Contador, who had a fever in the morning, called it quits 104km from the 
finish line after trying his luck one last time with a vintage early move.


“I have not recovered from the crashes, I’ve been sick overnight, that’s why I 
made this decision. I could not continue,” said the Spaniard.

Contador was attempting to win his third Tour de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> and his eighth Grand Tour 
overall.

The at times controversial Spaniard was stripped of his 2010 Tour de France 
and his 2011 Giro D’Italia victories after being found guilty of accidentally 
ingesting the prohibited substance clenbuterol.


Contador has made a successful return to the sport winning the 2012 and 2014 
Vuelta a España and the 2015 Giro D’Italia.
