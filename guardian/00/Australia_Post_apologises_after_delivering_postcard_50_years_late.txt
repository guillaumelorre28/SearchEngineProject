Australia Post <https://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-post> has 
“apologised for the inconvenience” after delivering a postcard from a South 
Pacific island a full half-century after it was sent.

An Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> couple found 
the postcard from the French Polynesian island of Tahiti in their letterbox, 
postmarked 1966.

The Adelaide Advertiser reported

 that the “slightly faded” postcard was addressed to “Robert Giorgio” from 
“Chris” in 1966.

It showed a scene from the Papeete waterfront, including the distinctive Bloc 
Donald building, whichfeatured on many postcards of the 1950s

Wattle Park resident Tim Duffy, who found the postcard beneath a water bill on 
Monday, believed Giorgio may have been the property’s original owner. Duffy and 
his wife Claire have both been contacted for comment by Guardian Australia.

“It is clear something went wrong 50 years ago after the postcard was posted 
in French Polynesia, and we apologise for the inconvenience,” an Australian 
Post spokesman told the Advertiser.

“Australia Post takes great pride in the timely, safe and efficient delivery 
of mail and we are confident that the vast majority of mail and parcels arrive 
on time.”

Vintage postcards showing similar scenes are available to buy cheaply on eBay.
