12 April 1999

She introduces me to Scotty by way of a photograph on her sideboard. "That is 
the best picture of my husband and my grandson. He was a good man." The picture 
is taken in Beverly Hills where her daughter, the former child movie star 
Janette Scott, used to live. "We had 54 years together. It was a wonderful 
life. And you see, Simon, I was ashamed that I didn't know it was a stroke he'd 
had. I was getting ready to go to work in the back, and we've got two bedrooms, 
and I was in one and he was in the other, not because we didn't speak to each 
other, because my arthritis, well, with all this you wouldn't ask the cat to 
sleep with me. And I was doing my hair, getting ready to go to rehearsal, when 
I heard this thud which I thought was my copper pans on the wall which you'll 
see before you go, cleanest in London. And I said, 'Was that one of the pans on 
the floor?' and nobody answers, so I came out and saw a light under the 
bathroom door, and he'd fallen into the bath. There was no water in it, and he 
was dressed, and – it's a terrible thing to say, only God understands me very, 
very well – the first thing I thought was, 'Why are your shoes cleaner than 
anyone else's?'"

You don't interview Thora, you listen in awe. Each story is a self-contained 
play. The detail is astonishing, the tangents surreal. She sits there, rigid in 
her chair, laughter lines dancing across her face, and talks and talks and 
talks in concentrated Lancashire. Her tongue lollops from one side of her mouth 
to the other, moistening her lips, keeping them fit for work.

David Frost
Emma Brockes
27 October 2003

I ask what he would like to be better at in life. Frost thinks long and hard. 
"Well actually, there are two things, and that is singing and swimming. I have 
nearly drowned on three or four occasions, one more famous than any other 
because it wasPeter Cook <http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/peter-cook> who 
saved me, and …"

This is a well known story. Cook saved Frost from drowning and later, much 
later, when asked what he regretted in life, allegedly replied, "Saving David 
Frost from drowning." I remind Frost of this. He opens his mouth and winces. 
"Yes," he says. "A great joke." The wince deepens. "But it wasAlan Bennett 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/alanbennett>'s joke, not his. In fact, Lynne 
[Frost's first wife, Lynne Frederick] got really angry about that joke and 
wrote to the Sunday Times, but it was a brilliant joke, Alan Bennett's joke at 
Cook's memorial service. Great gag." A pained silence. "As Lynne pointed out, 
anyone would be rather proud of having saved a ... friend or acquaintance. 
Anyway, great gag."

There is another uneasy silence. Were you hurt by it? "No not really," he says 
brusquely recovering himself. "If you started in the satire business then 
you've got to enjoy the satire along the way."

Later, I call Bennett and ask if he meant the remark unkindly. "Oh dear," he 
says. "Oh dear. Just say you couldn't find me."

 Lorraine Kelly … 'like hearing the random opions of young women in a beauty 
salon.' Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian 
Between her two weekly tabloid newspaper columns 
<http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/papercolumnists/lorrainekelly/article4587287.ece>
, Kelly must write nearly 100 opinion dispatches a year. "I'm damn sure if 
something's annoying me, it's annoying everybody else," she says – and she's 
probably right. But listening to her hold forth feels like overhearing the 
random opinions of young women on a Saturday morning in a beauty salon waiting 
room. It's a modern version of femininity which is lively, and affects the 
appearance of an opinionated mind. But it doesn't seem to recognise that taking 
one position should have to preclude a contradictory view a second later.

I ask if she's ever wondered whether it's ideal for people to begin their day 
by sitting in front of the telly. "I know what you mean, it's a guilty 
pleasure!" she exclaims. "It's that kind of naughtiness, isn't it, watching 
telly in the morning?" So it doesn't trouble her? "Oh no, because it's a great 
way of communicating and informing."

 Tracey Emin … angry. Photograph: Eamonn Mccabe for the Guardian 
However much fun it was making the film [Top Spot], it isn't altogether fun 
watching it. Individually the sequences are poignant and well-written; there is 
a touching scene when the girls paint their nails - "It's about 
self-preservation and pride and having some future," says Emin, belligerently. 
Or the scene featuring a girl at a bus stop who, when the bus comes, decides 
not to take it after all and wanders off in a class bit of adolescent vacancy. 
But without a stronger narrative, these snapshots just don't hold together over 
the course of an hour. I ask if it was tough for the actresses, with so little 
obvious characterisation to build upon.

"Hey, guess what, yes there is, there's fucking lots of it. Have you seen the 
film?"

Yes.

"Do you like the film?"

I like bits of it. And I think bits of it are really slow. I think it drags in 
the middle.

"Which bit did you think drags in the middle?"

When they're in the museum. And all those seagull shots.

Emin looks as if she'd like to get out a knife and stab me in the head.

"Right. When was the last time you went to the cinema?"

Yesterday.

"What did you see?"

Comme une Image (Look At Me).

"Was every bit of it enthrallingly fantastic?"

I wasn't ever bored.

"OK."

I was aware of being bored when I was watching your film, however.

She takes a big breath. "I REALLY REALLY ... "Christ. This is horrible. Emin 
tries a different tack. "What was my last work that you've seen, show-wise and 
stuff like that?"

I admit that I've never seen her work live. Emin's eyes light up; she smells 
blood.

"What do you think of my exhibition at the Tate?"

I haven't seen it.

"What do you think of my exhibition at White Cube?"

I haven't seen it.

"What do you think of, erm." She pauses. "The work I do for Terrence Higgins 
Trust? You don't know about it," she sneers, "do you?"

Well, I say, what's that got to do with you having made a boring film?

"Because I don't think . . . ugh, I'm really not in a good mood today. I don't 
think my film was boring."That's fine, but …

"I think it's difficult, it's not boring."

That's fine, but why do you get so angry when someone disagrees with you?

"I'm not angry."

You are angry.

"I'm not angry, I'm tired today and I don't need this fucking crap. Be a bit 
more diplomatic."

But you asked me what I thought.

"Yeah, but …"

Why ask if you don't want to know …

"No, but –"

Do you surround yourself by arse-kissers the whole time or something?

"I DON'T NEED TO TAKE THIS CRAP FROM YOU, EMMA," says Emin.

THEN DON'T ASK WHAT I THINK, I reply. We stare at our plates. In the corner of 
the bar, two old men sit placidly sipping their beer. We get up and go outside 
for the photos.

John Prescott

 John Prescott in 2011. Photograph: David Levene for The Guardian 
When I arrive at John Prescott's flat, he is at his desk, a telephone in one 
hand and a letter in the other. "Can't get the bugger to answer," he growls. He 
is trying, he explains, to call a man called O'Reilly, who has just written him 
an astonishingly rude letter on stationery illustrated with a drawing of a 
foxhunter. "I always ring 'em up," the former deputy prime minister explains, 
as he goes to dial again. Is it a drag to have to respond to abusive 
correspondents, I ask, or does he enjoy it?

"Oh, I want to ring him!" Alas, the man fails to pick up the phone, so 
Prescott offers a vivid impression of what he would have said had O'Reilly 
answered. "I'd start off saying, 'Reilly! Prescott here. I've got your letter 
here.'" Prescott adopts a music hall caricature of a posh accent. "And it just 
proves how ignorant you foxhunting fraternity are! The language is terrible, 
and me as a former seaman, well, I'm not used to it. Obviously it's normal for 
you public-school boys. And I know you went to public school," he adds, 
triumphantly knowing. "Addressing me as 'Prescott' was the giveaway!"

Then he is off on to an anecdote about another rude letter-writer, a colonel 
whose snooty butler refused to put Prescott through when he called. Somehow the 
story collides into another one, this time about a prison riot in the 70s, when 
the governor was insulting to him, and the officers reported Prescott to the 
police for an out-of-date car tax disc. Now suddenly it is 2001, and we are in 
Rhyl, the scene of hisfamous election campaign punch 
<http://politics.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,9353,-10304188438,00.html>. 
"And the sisters were wetting their bloody knickers, with Harriet Harman 
saying: 'Ooh, we can't have a macho in our ranks.' But it was a conspiracy 
between the foxhunters and Adam Boulton and Sky! Sky used that footage to try 
and get rid of me! That were Boulton: 'Press your red button if you think 
Prescott should be sacked.' I'd have pressed his red button," Prescott glowers, 
"if I'd got anywhere near him."

Grievances keep tumbling out of him, a great waterfall of gleeful indignation 
and affront. On and on it comes, this torrent of memory, until, without any 
warning, he shudders to a halt and peers across at me suspiciously, as if only 
just registering my presence. "What paper," he demands, "are you on anyway?"

Ariel Sharon  <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ariel-sharon>

7 November 2001
 Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon on his farm, photographed for G2. 
Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian 
Between Tel Aviv and the small town of Sderot there is a turn-off for Shikmim 
Farm. You can't miss it. A white gazebo has been pitched at the gate and a mass 
of pink bougainvillea trained up the wall on either side. It looks like the 
kind of place you might go to experience deep-pore facials with mud from the 
Dead Sea. Two men with submachine guns stand in the shade, not an uncommon 
sight in Israel, particularly this close to Gaza, but unlike most 
out-of-the-way security details they are rigid with vigilance.Ariel Sharon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ariel-sharon>, the Israeli prime minister, 
lives half a kilometre down the drive. For some reason, he has invited us to 
spend the afternoon with him.

Even by the standards of the past month, it has been a furiously paced week 
for Sharon. Last Thursday, Tony Blair flew to meet him inIsrael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> on the last leg of his Middle 
Eastern tour. The day after our meeting, three people will be killed in a 
terrorist attack by a Palestinian gunman on a bus in Jerusalem. So busy has 
Sharon been these past few weeks that he even cancelled a long-planned trip to 
Washington and London. All of which makes the scene that greets us on entry to 
his farmhouse, absurdly discordant. We enter to the sound of a Mozart piano 
concerto. A female assistant leads us through a corridor to a whitewashed 
lounge with terracotta floor tiles, furnished with Mediterranean chic. Mr 
Sharon, we are informed, has a little business to finish and will be with us 
shortly. A different assistant enters, says, "I am here to spoil you," and 
brings us a plate of Jammy Dodgers. We are left alone with Sharon's Alsatian 
dog, Schwartz, for 20 minutes.

The prime minister enters the room heavily. Sharon is a big man who heaves 
from side to side like a metronome. He is dressed in turned-up jeans hiked high 
above his waist and a blue-checked shirt. After shaking hands, he settles 
himself in an over-stuffed mustard armchair and without preamble, starts 
talking. "Through irrigation the colours in this part of the world are 
changing," he says, waving a hand at the window. "I was born on a farm. My 
strength has nothing to do with political apparatus. I get my strength from 
nature, from flowers."

Sharon does not make much eye contact. He talks either to the window or to the 
middle distance. I begin to ask if he felt unnatural as a child bearing arms. 
He reads the question as critical – a suggestion that he has been brutalised 
from infancy – and interrupts to defend himself. "It's a struggle. Over 120 
years. Very recently of course it has became local terror, regional terror and 
you have international terror. Maybe the world understands better now that one 
should not get into any compromise with terror. You cannot surrender to terror; 
you have to fight terror." No matter the subject, it is a mantra Sharon always 
returns to.

At this point, a peculiar snuffling sound issues from the far side of the 
room. Schwartz, the alsatian, has deftly lifted a piece of cake from a china 
plate on the coffee table and thrown it down his throat. Sharon stiffens. He 
speaks sharply to his assistant in Hebrew. "It's a terrible thing," he says. 
"He never did that before." The dog is dragged off by the scruff of its neck. 
"Bad manners," mutters Sharon furiously.

12 April 2001

"I thought he was the most despicable man," Adler says [of Humphrey Bogart 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/humphreybogart>]. "I never saw him sober." He 
tells me of a night he saw Bogart leaning against the bar in customary fashion. 
"He said, 'Let me tell you something about you, Adler. You claim you're a 
liberal. You ain't a liberal, you're a fucking phoney. Let me tell you why. I 
hate niggers. So do you, but you won't admit it because you're a phoney. I'll 
admit it, so who's a liberal – you or me? And I hate Jews.' He then pointed to 
Adler's wife, Eileen, and said: 'Yeah, I married one and sure I know you're 
one, but you hate them just as much as I do." At this point, Adler and Eileen 
decided to leave.

When he got to his car, Bogart suddenly appeared at the side. "He said, 'What 
are we fighting about, Adler? We're both on the same side.'" What side was 
that? "His side, whichever it was. Awful man. Great artist, awful man."

Johnny Depp <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/johnnydepp>
Decca Aitkenhead
6 November 2011

Depp looks like he should be in Bon Jovi, or behind a stall selling Zippos in 
Camden market. The shirt is extravagantly ripped, the jewellery is heavily 
goth, the glasses are tinted and the tattoos wrap around him like climbing ivy. 
His voice loiters somewhere between a drawl and a growl – a deep Kentucky 
slurry of mumbles – but punctuated by surprise bursts of Queen's English, with 
the odd anglicism ("take a gander at this") thrown in, making him sound likeTom 
Waits <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tom-waits> auditioning for My Fair Lady.

At 48, Depp's face remains, if no longer quite ethereal, then still 
breathtakingly beautiful – creamy smooth, freakishly symmetrical, with a thick 
chop of chocolate hair untroubled by any trace of grey. The actor has spent 
most of his career trying to abdicate from the position of Hollywood sex 
symbol, but there appears to be nothing he can do about the tenacity of his 
beauty. And yet, the very first thing out of his mouth – once he's stubbed the 
fag out – gives a pretty good idea of how he would he prefer to be seen, and 
how he sees himself.

"In Los Angeles, the hoity toities, the beautiful people, will sit on Sunset 
Strip and have their meal at these kind of fancy restaurants where no one can 
smoke – but you can inhale car fumes all you like." He shakes his head. "I 
mean, that to me says it all."

Simon Hattenstone on the most embarrassing questions he has asked in G2 
interviews


To Willem Dafoe, 17 November 1998
"Do you enjoy your reputation [for having the biggest schlong in Hollywood]?
"Ah come on, I'm a man, I liiiiike it."

To Glenda Jackson, 24 May 1999 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/may/24/londonmayor.uk>
Can anything in politics equal the pleasure of having your nipples sucked by 
Oliver Reed?
"I should possibly add a little, erm, decoration to that."

To Leonardo Dicaprio, 24 December 2004 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/dec/24/1>
Would you agree that the films from your middle period are shite?
"No, I would not be able to agree with that."

To Lou Reed, 19 May 2003 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/may/19/artsfeatures.popandrock>
Why are you being so horrible?
"As attacks go, that is pretty mild. Come on! Are you kidding?"

To Michael Howard, 27 November 2001 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/nov/27/conservatives.uk>
Would you have allowed your parents into Britain?
"My parents did not come by saying 'I claim asylum,' as I've explained. There 
we are, I've got to go."

To Peter Stringfellow, 2 October 2000 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2000/oct/02/features11.g21>
Do you think you're sleazy?
"No, not in the slightest. You see, there's a lot of honesty in my life and I 
know a lot of people are dishonest. Certainly with sex. They're frightened of 
exposing their feelings."

To Noel Edmonds, 25 June 2001 <http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/jun/25/g2>
Why do you think you have become unpopular?
"I don't know. I sensed that I'd moved into a position of ridicule, yeah. I 
don't think it was altogether justified. But it is easy to become the name 
people trot out to make a cheap joke .

To Banksy, 17 July 2003 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2003/jul/17/art.artsfeatures>
How do I know you are Banksy?
"You have no guarantee of that whatsoever."

To Alan Bennett, 23 November 2010 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/nov/23/alan-bennett-interview>
Is it true you once described yourself as a bit of a cunt?
"Oh no, it was Rupert, my partner, who said it. He'd been watching Wuthering 
Heights and he said: 'You're a bit like Heathcliff'. I said: 'Oh!' He said: 
'Yeah, difficult, northern and a cunt.'"
Is that a fair assessment?
"Yes, that's all right, that's fine. I'm quite happy with that."

Emma Brockes on doing the G2 interview

Favourite interviewee
As people - Michael Gambon 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/jun/28/theatre.beckettat100>; Jeanne 
Moreau <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/nov/01/features.features11>; Diana 
Athill <http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/dec/22/news.emmabrockes>; John 
Mortimer <http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/oct/06/fiction.society>; Andre 
Previn.

Worst interviewee
A very cross, monosyllabic Alan Sugar 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2005/sep/21/features11.g2>, at the 
launch of Integra, a "hydro-vitality infusion complex" developed by a former 
winner of the Apprentice.

Most awkward moment
The first few minutes of interviewing thriller writer Geoffrey Archer as if 
under the impression that he was Jeffrey Archer 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/jul/23/fiction.emmabrockes>, the other 
thriller writer, for a hilarious joke during the week of Lord Archer's perjury 
trial in 2001, when no one could get an interview with him.Or - not awkward, 
but strange –the experience of interviewing Stephen Hawking 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/27/scienceandnature.highereducationprofile>
 and sitting for 20 minutes in silence between each question and answer, as, 
with extraordinary effort, Hawking moved his body in tiny increments to 
programme and finally press send on his voice synthesizer. Never has every word 
seemed so precious.

Most surprising reaction to a question
Michael (son of child star, Mickey) Rooney's answer to a bland warm-up 
question about his mother <http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/oct/17/theatre>
: "She is no longer with us ... What happened was – the story is kind of 
intense: my mother was murdered ... I was about three or four. And my mum and 
my dad were going through a divorce. My mum was kind of seeing somebody on the 
side. But then my father and my mother decided to get back together, and the 
guy my mum was dating wasn't having it. So he took the very gun that my father 
gave my mother for protection and killed her in our house. Then killed himself. 
It was a murder suicide." [Period of stunned silence].
