Noel Gallagher has little love for Ed Sheeran or Sleaford Mods 
<http://www.nme.com/news/noel-gallagher/82244>

Frankly, that’s quite a broad sweep of disdain to harbour, from Sheeran’s 
relentlessly unprovocative guitar pop to Sleaford Mods’ shouty soliloquys set 
to song. In any case, Gallagher made his thoughts on both acts clear, in an NME 
interview: “They’re like fucking Brown Bottle in Viz,” he said of the Mods’ 
Jason Williamson and Andrew Robert Lindsay Fearn. “There’s no joy in that, is 
there? It’s just two guys, one clearly mentally ill, who’s just shouting like 
Brown Bottle about fucking cider and fucking shit chicken.” Right.

Azealia Banks’s Twitter feud game is as strong as ever 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/12/azealia-banks-kid-cudi-lay-into-kendrick-lamar-ferguson>

Moving away from ripping into Iggy Azalea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/24/iggy-azalea-azealia-banks-hip-hop-appropriation-problem>
, the Harlem rapper took to Twitter to voice her disgust at Kendrick Lamar’s 
pro-respectability politics 
<http://www.thenation.com/blog/176183/respectability-politics-wont-save-us-death-jonathan-ferrell>
 on the killing of teenager Michael Brown. She wasn’t impressed. Lupe Fiasco 
defended Lamar. Then, logically, Banks compared Fiasco to a foodstuff. Note: 
Lamar hasn’t engaged in this twitter war and probably never will.

Lupe fiasco came at me so I fired back, I'm a girl who stands up for herself 
and yall mad.

Carly Rae Jepsen wants to sound trendier than on Call Me, Maybe

The pop singer-songwriter behind one of 2012’s most infuriatingly viral hits 
has been photographed in the studio with producers Dev Hynes and Ariel 
Rechtshaid. Both men helped craft Sky Ferreira’s 2013 single Everything is 
Embarrassing into every alt-girl’s dream and between them have granted 
indie-world cred to Solange, Charli XCX and Haim. Please, guys, make this work. 
Please.

Mariah Carey’s taking her dog-whistle to Las Vegas

In 1998, Carey released an album that included 13 number 1 singles, 
inventively entitled #1’s (pre-hashtags, of course). She’ll be playing an 
updated version of the album at Caesars Palace in a May and July residency, as 
revealed on Ellen Degeneres’s talk show, with top tickets priced at$250

Caribou basically shared his iTunes library on YouTube 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4lEESSgxM_5O81EvKCmBIm_JT5Q7JeaI>

Forget 12-track mixtapes slipped into the hands of your crush. If you’re Dan 
Snaith ofCaribou <https://www.theguardian.com/music/caribou>, a neat 1,001-song 
YouTube playlist packs the most punch. In Snaith’s own capped-up words: “PLEASE 
LISTEN TO THIS PLAYLIST ON SHUFFLE.” Go on then, set aside a few weeks and give 
it a try.
 ‘Just sitting in these reeds thinking of a few more songs to add to the list’

Rick Rubin might be turning into a Belieber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/15/justin-bieber-teams-up-with-rick-rubin>

Yes, it does seem like a logical jump for Rubin to make: from LL Cool J and 
Public Enemy to that glowing bastion of modern music,Justin Bieber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber>. One photo on the 
Instagram-like app called Shots is all we’re basing this on, to be fair, so 
Rubin and Bieber might just have been kicking back. We’ll see what comes of 
this.

Beyoncé is the most-searched rapper on Genius. Sort of 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/15/beyonce-drake-most-viewed-song-artist-2014-rap-genius>

The site, which annotates song lyrics and is about to launch an editorial arm 
under formerNew Yorker pop critic Sasha Frere-Jones 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/business/media/pop-music-critic-leaves-the-new-yorker-to-annotate-lyrics-for-a-start-up.html>
, released the data on its most popular songs and artists of 2014. Hip-hop 
heads are generally furious that Beyoncé came out on top with song Drunk in 
Love – but maybe they should readi-D magazine’s blogpost

Riot grrrls Sleater-Kinney made a video with their cool mates

Alert that friend who repeatedly watched Juno when it first came out, played 
ukelele in a three-piece at university and genuinely says things like “No, no – 
it’s keen-WA, not kwee-noah”: Sleater-Kinney have bunged all the indie stars 
together for the No Cities to Love video. Play spot-the-alt-star, and hang your 
head in shame if you consider yourself to be an arbiter of cool but can’t name 
every cameo.

Björk, our favourite swan-wearing maverick, is back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/14/bjork-vulnicura-ninth-album-arca-the-haxan-cloak>

What else can we say? The ageless, endearingly experimental musician has plans 
to bless us with an album in March, according to this hand-written note 
uploaded to her Facebook and Twitter accounts. What’s that? You couldn’t care 
less? We can’t hear you over theEarth Intruders

If 2014 was the supposed year that “women won 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2014/dec/17/2014-the-year-women-won-video>
”, we may need to prepare for 2015 as the year women in British music lost out 
a little . First we had an all-male top five in the BBC’s Sound of 2015 
shortlist (with women represented in the longlist), before the Brits announced 
an all-malelist of candidates for album of the year
