before the election to suggest the Tory party leader talk to the editor of his 
flagship title on a daily basis during the campaign.

a capital C". The eldest son of Sir David Barclay was put in charge ofTelegraph

the purchase of the company by his father and uncle Sir Frederick in 2004.

Telegraph.co.uk and also another part of the Barclays' publishing empire, the 
Spectator, but keeps a low profile and is discreet about the influence he 
exerts.
