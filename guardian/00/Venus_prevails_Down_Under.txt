Second seed Venus Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/venus-williams> 
made light work of qualifier Ansley Cargill 6-3, 6-0 to saunter into the third 
round of the Australian Open.

Williams, showing a marked improvement on her first-round win over Svetlana 
Kuznetsova, completely outplayed her fellow American to seal victory in less 
than an hour.

She broke Cargill's first service game to take the opening set in 32 minutes, 
then raced through the second in just 20 minutes to seal a textbook victory.

Williams crushed Cargill 6-2, 6-2 in the opening round here last year when the 
118th-ranked American was making her first appearance in the tournament and was 
even more ruthless second time around.

She hammered 39 winners to Cargill's three, but her eagerness to go for the 
quick kill saw her commit 28 unforced errors and three double faults.

She next plays Anca Barna in the third round after the German upset 27th seed 
Lisa Raymond 6-3, 6-1.

A slimline Lindsay Davenport was hustled and harried all the way before 
finally overcoming Iroda Tulyaganova 6-7, 6-4, 7-5 to reach the third round.

The former champion, noticeably lighter than when she lifted the trophy here 
in 2000, struggled to find any consistency throughout but in the end did just 
enough against the feisty Uzbek.

Relieved, she let out a screech of delight after whipping a forehand cross 
court past the 57th-ranked Tulyaganova to finally bury her tenacious foe.

"I was getting tired. It was long sets, long points. More than anything I 
wanted to finish it off," smiled Davenport afterwards.

"She was hitting a lot of good shots, it was a long and tiring match." 

The ninth seed now faces Russia's Tatiana Panova.

Anna Kournikova was somewhat less successful, however, falling to the heaviest 
grand slam defeat of her less-than-glittering eight-year career.

The Russian was destroyed 6-0, 6-1 by fifth-seeded Belgian Justine 
Henin-Hardenne and rushed from the court immediately after her 48-minute ordeal 
ended, red-faced and clearly upset by the one-sided humiliation.

More than an hour later, make-up reapplied and wearing a natty black tracksuit 
top and black cap, Kournikova put a brave face on the debacle.

"We were both on the court... I think it was a match," she said, somewhat 
uncertain.

Her previous worst showing at a grand slam event was when she lost 6-2, 6-1 to 
Steffi Graf in the fourth round of the 1996 US Open.

"I really had no weapons against her today," was the pretty ineffective 
Russian's verdict. "I tried to find a way, but it was too hard."

Henin, however, was delighted, if a little bemused, by the ease of her win.

"Sometimes it was just, yeah... amazing," she said, before turning her 
attention to Katarina Srebotnik, her opponent in the third round.
