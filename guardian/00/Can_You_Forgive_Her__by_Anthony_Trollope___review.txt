Probably the only major 19th-century novel to have had a Pet Shop Boys single 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Q7ZE3jkPM> named after it, Anthony Trollope's 
first instalment in the Palliser series remains a gripping, if lengthy, read. 
(Stephen King, no stranger to verbiage, once joked that a more appropriate 
title would have been Can You Possibly Finish It?) What is most remarkable is 
the way the satire on the mores and double-dealings of society still seems 
contemporary. From the first page's reference to the 1864 equivalent of the 1% 
– "the Upper Ten Thousand of this our English world" – Trollope's account of a 
society in which money, breeding and influence, rather than skill or integrity, 
are the primary routes into power is unpleasantly familiar.

If the central love story, revolving around the flighty Alice Vavasor and her 
entanglements with the dull John Grey and the wild George, plods slightly, the 
supporting cast, such as the born-to-rule stuffed shirt politician Plantagenet 
Palliser and the dashingly unsuitable Captain Bellfield ("carrying, perhaps in 
his nose some first symptoms of the first signs of midnight amusements") prove 
highly entertaining. This new edition, edited by Dinah Birch, offers a 
comprehensive series of notes, a useful guide to the political situation of the 
era and an informed and knowledgeable introduction.
