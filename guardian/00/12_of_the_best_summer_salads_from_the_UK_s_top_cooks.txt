Last-minute grilled salad: Neil Rankin

Because barbecues aren’t only for big slabs of meat or fish. To make the 
puffed rice, just deep-fry raw wild rice for a few seconds in 180C oil, then 
drain. Serves six to eight.

2 fennel bulbs, one left whole, the other thinly sliced
3 courgettes, thickly sliced lengthways
2 tropea (or red) onions, cut in half lengthways but unpeeled
3 spring onions, trimmed
1 leek
4 stalks white, purple or green sprouting broccoli
3 spears asparagus 
1 globe artichoke, trimmed and quartered lengthways
1 small bunch dandelion leaves
1 romaine lettuce, cut in half lengthways through the core

For the dressing
Olive oil, to taste
Lemon juice, to taste
Sea salt flakes
4 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 handful chives, cut into 2.5cm lengths
2 tbsp puffed wild rice (see introduction)
1 tbsp garlic slices, fried until crisp
Couple of grates of parmesan 

Cook the whole fennel bulb in the hot coals for 10 minutes, until blackened, 
then peel off the charred outer layer.

Lay the fennel and courgette slices, the onion halves, spring onions, leek, 
broccoli, asparagus and artichoke quarters on the grill of the barbecue. Cook, 
turning as needed, until tender and charred. Remove from the grill as they are 
cooked, but leave the leek until it is blackened all over, then peel off the 
outer layer. Roughly chop all the veg, including the fennel bulb.

Grill the dandelion leaves for a few seconds; grill the lettuce halves on one 
side only, until almost black.

Combine all the vegetables on a platter. Dress with oil, lemon juice and salt 
to taste, sprinkle with the herbs, puffed rice, crisp garlic and parmesan, and 
serve.

 Peter Gordon’s lamb neck, baked pitta, figs, feta, tomato, cucumber, mint and 
olives 
I use lamb neck fillet for this warm salad, but loin, leg steaks or even 
leftover roast leg will work. Black olives work better than green ones here. 
Serves six as a main course.

900g lamb neck fillet, trimmed of excess fat and sinew
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
3-4 pitta breads (depending on size), torn into pieces
2 tbsp red-wine vinegar
150g kalamata (or other black) olives
4 tomatoes
2 small cucumbers, peeled and sliced
30 mint leaves, torn
200g feta, roughly crumbled
½ tsp dried oregano
6 figs
1 juicy lemon, cut into six wedges

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put a roasting dish on the hob on a 
medium heat. Season the lamb, brush with a teaspoon of oil, then brown well on 
all sides. Remove the lamb and add the pitta to the dish, tossing it around to 
coat it in the fat. Sit the lamb on the bread and transfer to the oven until 
the lamb is cooked: lamb neck can be a little fatty, so it’s best to cook it 
medium for this; neck fillets will take about 10 minutes. Lift the meat on to 
another dish, leave to rest in a warm place for 10 minutes, then slice and put 
it on a plate; reserve the cooking juices.

Drizzle the vinegar over the pitta in the oven dish, add the olives and half 
the remaining oil, and toss. Return the bread to the oven until crisp – about 
eight to 10 minutes.

While the bread is baking, cut the tomatoes in half crossways, then gently 
squeeze out and discard the seeds. Cut the flesh into chunks and mix with the 
cucumber, mint, feta, oregano and remaining oil.

Remove the stems from the figs (and peel them, if you prefer), then thickly 
slice and add to the tomato salad. Toss everything together and season lightly 
with salt (the feta is already salty) and a quarter-teaspoon of coarsely ground 
black pepper.

To serve, pile the salad on top of the crisp pitta. Lay the lamb on top, 
drizzle over the cooking juices and serve with lemon wedges.

 Olia Hercules’ buckwheat and smashed herb salad 
This also works without the runners, or use thinly sliced sticks of kohlrabi 
instead. Serves four.

200g raw buckwheat (or ready toasted)
50g radishes
200g tender runner beans 
20g coriander, leaves and stalks
20g basil, leaves and stalks
10g tarragon, leaves only
1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped
2 tbsp cider vinegar
1 tsp honey
Sea salt flakes
2 tbsp mild olive oil or rapeseed oil
1 handful fresh mint leaves

If you’re using raw buckwheat, toast it until it turns golden, to draw out 
that beautiful nutty flavour: you can do this in a dry frying pan or in the 
oven at 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Just keep shaking the pan or roasting tray, so it 
colours evenly.

If your radishes have leaves on, and they look fresh, do not get rid of them: 
they are delicious, so add the leaves to the salad. Cut the radishes themselves 
in half lengthways.

If your runner beans are very fresh, you can use them raw and chop them into 
thin pieces as they are; otherwise, quickly blanch in boiling water, drain and 
refresh first.

Cook the buckwheat in 400ml boiling salted water for about 20 minutes, until 
tender but still al dente and the water is absorbed.

For the dressing, use a pestle and mortar or a food processor. Pound or blitz 
the herbs, garlic, vinegar, honey and a teaspoon of sea salt, then slowly feed 
in the oil. Add more oil if it’s not quite coming together – you want a 
homogeneous dressing. Don’t worry about “bruising” the herbs: that’s what they 
do in Georgia, and it works a treat. Adjust the seasoning to taste: it should 
be really well seasoned, mostly sour, salty and a tiny bit sweet.

When the buckwheat is ready, drain it if it hasn’t absorbed all the water, 
then leave to cool a little. In a serving bowl, mix the buckwheat, beans, 
radishes and dressing, scatter over the mint leaves and serve.

 Eleonora Galasso’s stuffed conchiglioni on basil leaves 
Eat this warm or cold; any leftover sauce makes a magnificent sandwich 
filling. Serves four as a main course.

5 baby plum tomatoes
1 avocado
1 tbsp salted capers, rinsed
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
3 anchovy fillets in olive oil
350g tinned tuna in spring water, drained
100g pitted black olives, very finely chopped
1 celery stick, trimmed and very finely chopped
1 red onion, peeled and very finely chopped
1 large handful basil leaves, chopped, plus extra whole leaves to garnish
2 small handfuls sage leaves, chopped
Salt and white pepper
400g conchiglioni pasta
1 garlic clove, peeled
1 large handful flat-leaf parsley leaves
2 tbsp breadcrumbs
1 tbsp dried oregano

Put the tomatoes in a bowl and pour over boiling water to cover. Leave for a 
minute or two, drain, then cut a cross at the stem end of each tomato and peel. 
Cut the flesh into 5mm cubes.

Halve the avocado, discard the stone and scoop out the flesh with a spoon, 
then cut into 5mm cubes. Finely chop half the capers. Heat a tablespoon of oil 
and fry the anchovy fillets in a large pan on a medium heat. Add the tuna, 
breaking up any large chunks, and cook, stirring, for five minutes. Stir in the 
tomatoes, avocado, chopped capers, olives, celery, onion, basil, sage and three 
more tablespoons of oil. Season with a pinch of white pepper and take off the 
heat.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the conchiglioni and 
cook until al dente. Drain and pass it quickly under cold water, to prevent it 
cooking further.

In a large pan, gently brown the garlic with the remaining oil, then remove 
from the pan and add the pasta, tossing it around to coat in the garlic-scented 
oil.

Spoon the sauce into the pasta shells. Lay a bed of basil leaves on a large 
dish, arrange the conchiglioni on top, and finish with a scattering of chopped 
parsley, breadcrumbs, oregano and the whole capers.

 Angela Hartnett’s kohlrabi, apple and celery salad with capers and tarragon 
My boyfriend Neil Borthwick, who is head chef at Merchants Tavern 
<http://www.merchantstavern.co.uk> in Shoreditch, used to work with Michel Bras 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bras>, the godfather of modern vegetable 
cookery. Neil has taught me all sorts of new ways with veg, including this 
crunchy salad, which is one of our favourites. We like it on its own with good 
crusty rye bread, but it also works as a side dish with fried pork, especially 
if it’s breaded. Serves six to eight as a first course.

2 kohlrabi, peeled, cut in half and very finely sliced (you want the slices to 
be almost translucent, so use a mandoline if you have one)
1 granny smith apple, quartered, cored and sliced very thin
2 sticks celery, sliced very thinly
Sea salt, to taste
1 lemon, juiced and zested
Extra-virgin olive oil 
4 stalks fresh tarragon, leaves picked, washed and dried
5g lilliput capers (or other baby capers), drained 

Put the kohlrabi, apple and celery in a large stainless-steel bowl, season 
with salt, the lemon zest and a tablespoon of olive oil. Add half the lemon 
juice, and check for seasoning. You can make the salad up to this point ahead 
of time, before you have a bottle of prosecco as an aperitif; but it doesn’t 
really benefit from being left to sit for too long, so it’s best if you don’t 
open a second bottle.

Arrange the salad attractively on a large platter, scatter over the tarragon 
leaves and capers, and grind over a few turns of black pepper.

 Gary Usher’s hispi cabbage, cashew and apricot with sesame and lime dressing 
Lovely as a stand-alone, but also a great side for barbecued oily fish such as 
sardines or mackerel. The recipe is from Richard Sharples, who is going to be 
head chef at our new restaurant in Manchester, when it opens later this year. 
Serves six to eight as a side dish.

For the dressing
1 stick lemongrass
3 limes
3 tbsp maple syrup
2 tsp dark soy sauce
2 tbsp sesame oil

For the cashews
200g cashew nuts
1 tbsp sunflower oil
1 tsp sea salt

For the salad
6 ripe apricots
1 small bunch coriander
1 small bunch mint
3 red chillies (or to taste)
2 large hispi cabbage (dark outer leaves removed)
Sea salt

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Dress the cashew nuts with the 
sunflower oil and sea salt, roast for eight minutes, then leave to cool.

For the dressing, peel off and discard the tough outer layers of the 
lemongrass and chop the rest as finely as possible. In a bowl, whisk with the 
other dressing ingredients.

Stone the apricots and cut each one into eighths. Tear the coriander and mint 
leaves off their stalks. Deseed and finely slice the red chillies. Separate the 
cabbage leaves and shred into roughly 0.5cm-thick strips (speed things up by 
stacking five or so leaves on top of each other, then cut widthways).

Put the cabbage in a large bowl and add a few pinches of sea salt. Toss and 
leave for five minutes (the salt both seasons the salad and softens it, by 
drawing out water).

To serve, mix everything together on a platter and take to the table.

 Meera Sodha’s fennel and apple chaat with caramelised almonds 
This crisp, clean bunch of ingredients, mixed with warming sweet spices, works 
together as tightly as James Brown’s rhythm section. Serves four as a side dish.

1 tsp fennel seeds
5 tbsp rapeseed oil
100g flaked almonds
1 tsp ground ginger
2 tbsp honey
1 lemon, plus 2 tbsp lemon juice
2 medium fennel bulbs 
3 braeburn apples
½ cucumber
10g fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
1¼ teaspoons garam masala

Bash the fennel seeds in a mortar until coarsely ground. Heat a couple of 
tablespoons of oil in a frying pan on a medium flame, stir-fry the almonds for 
a couple of minutes, until they turn pale gold, then add the ground fennel, 
ginger, honey and a third of a teaspoon of salt. Stir-fry for a minute, until 
caramelised, then tip out on to a plate and leave to cool.

To make the salad, fill a big bowl with cold water. Cut the lemon in half, 
squeeze the juice into the water, then chuck in the lemon halves; this will 
stop the fennel and apple discolouring. Very finely slice the fennel (use a 
mandoline, if you have one) and put it into the lemony water. Slice the apples 
equally thinly and add them to the bowl. Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, 
scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon, then slice thinly and put to one side.

Drain the fennel and apple, getting rid of as much water as possible and 
discarding the lemon halves, and put in a serving bowl with the cucumber and 
mint.

For the dressing, mix three tablespoons of oil with the lemon juice, garam 
masala and half a teaspoon of salt. Crumble the caramelised almonds into the 
salad bowl, and pour over the dressing just before serving. Gently toss with 
your hands and serve.

 Nathan Outlaw’s crab and tomato salad with horseradish dressing 
A perfect, simple salad for a summer’s day, when tomatoes are plentiful, juicy 
and sweet. I always cook my own crab, but if you use a picked one, you can 
assemble the dish in next to no time. The horseradish adds a refreshing kick 
and really brings the dish alive. Serves four as a starter.

About 300g white crabmeat (if cooking your own crab, you’ll need a 1.5kg one)
12 ripe tomatoes (the best you can get)
1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped
100ml olive oil
50ml white-wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
3 tsp chopped parsley
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the horseradish dressing
150ml soured cream
2 tbsp creamed horseradish
Freshly grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
100g brown crabmeat

To garnish
Zest of 1 lemon (microplaned, ideally)
2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves, sliced

Bring a large pan of water to a boil. Core the tomatoes and score a cross in 
the skin at the top of each one. Blanch the tomatoes in the boiling water for 
20 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a tray. When cool 
enough to handle, peel, then cut half the tomatoes into £1 coin-thick slices 
and the rest into wedges. Put all the tomatoes in a bowl and add the shallot, 
oil, vinegar, sugar and chopped parsley. Toss gently and season to taste.

Check the white crabmeat for fragments of shell or cartilage, then put it in a 
bowl and season to taste.

Whisk the dressing ingredients until smooth, and season to taste.

To serve, divide the tomato salad between four plates. Share the white 
crabmeat evenly between them, and drizzle the dressing on top. Finish with a 
sprinkling of lemon and shredded parsley, and serve.

 Alexis Gauthier’s salade glacée 
This super-refreshing salad isn’t one for the start of a meal, but the end. 
It’s the essence of Provençal summer. You need to make the granité a day ahead, 
but otherwise it’s very, very easy. Serves four.

1 charentais melon (or similar), peeled, cut in half and balled out into 20mm 
balls
200g cherry tomatoes, washed and cut in half
100ml extra-virgin olive oil
4 tsp balsamic vinegar (an aged one, if possible)
Salt and black pepper
20 large mint leaves, washed and dried
200g wild rocket, washed and dried
Lemon juice and slices

For the granité
500ml water
150g caster sugar
5 sprigs fresh mint

Make the granité a day ahead. Put the water and sugar in a saucepan, bring to 
a simmer and stir until the sugar has dissolved and you are left with a syrup. 
Turn off the heat, add the mint sprigs and leave to infuse until cold. Remove 
and discard the mint sprigs, then pour the syrup into a large, shallow tray and 
freeze. After half an hour, use a fork to break up the ice crystals, and repeat 
every half-hour, until the mixture has a texture a bit like rough snow (this 
should take two and a half to three hours), then freeze overnight.

At least an hour before you want to serve, put the melon balls on a plate and 
refrigerate. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, gently toss the halved cherry tomatoes 
in half the oil and the balsamic vinegar, and season. Add half the mint leaves, 
roughly chopped, stir gently and set aside to marinate.

Ideally, serve your salade glacée on a large platter – it will look more 
impressive that way. Arrange the melon balls evenly around the plate, then 
place the halved tomatoes in between them. Dress the rocket with the remaining 
oil, season, and place here and there around the tomatoes and melon. Sprinkle 
some granité evenly across the salad, like a light dusting of snow (keep the 
leftovers for the next sunny day, if we get one), and finish with a few drops 
of lemon juice; set aside a few slices of lemon for serving, so guests can 
squeeze on more, if they like. Crack more pepper over the lot, shred the 
remaining mint leaves and scatter on top, and serve at once, otherwise the 
granité will start to melt.

What to drink Alexis suggests serving this at the end of a meal, so I’m going

 Jane Baxter’s aubergine kisir 
This traditional Turkish dish is usually served as part of a meze. Red pepper 
paste is sold in jars in Middle Eastern food shops, but you can make your own 
by blitzing peeled roasted red peppers with garlic, chilli and olive oil; 
alternatively, use a teaspoon of harissa instead. Serves four.

250g bulgur wheat
1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped
1 pinch ground cumin
1 tbsp red pepper paste
1 tsp tomato puree
½ tsp salt
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp pomegranate molasses
2 tbsp lemon juice
4 spring onions, trimmed and chopped
4 tomatoes, skinned and chopped
½ cucumber, peeled, deseeded and chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 aubergine, sliced
100g watercress (optional)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing
200ml plain yoghurt
2 tbsp tahini
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp chopped fresh mint

Mix the bulgur wheat with the onion, cumin, pepper paste, tomato puree, salt 
and a tablespoon of olive oil. Stir to combine, pour over 200ml boiling water, 
stir again once and cover with clingfilm. Leave for 15 minutes, take off the 
clingfilm, then fluff up the wheat with a fork. Stir in the molasses, lemon 
juice, chopped vegetables and parsley, and chill.

Heat a griddle pan. Toss the aubergine slices in the remaining tablespoon of 
oil, then cook for a minute a side on the hot griddle, till tender, then season 
and set aside.

For the dressing, blitz together the yoghurt, tahini, garlic and lemon juice, 
season, then stir in the mint.

To serve, lay an aubergine slice on a large plate, top with a spoonful of the 
wheat and a spoonful of dressing, and repeat in alternating layers to form a 
tower. Scatter the watercress, if using, on top, drizzle more dressing all over 
and serve.

 Fergus Henderson’s warm salt cod, little gem and tomato salad 
Perhaps it’s to do with those delicate Arctic summers, but Norwegian salt cod, 
or klippfisk, seems a little gentler in a salad than its Portuguese and Spanish 
counterparts. The aïoli here makes more than you need (about 300ml in all), but 
it’s not worth making in smaller quantities. On the plus side, it keeps very 
well for five or six days, and can be used with all sorts, from crudités to 
poached or roast fish, chicken, rabbit or quail. Serves four.

For the aïoli
10 cloves garlic, peeled
Sea salt and black pepper
1 free-range egg yolk
At least 300ml extra-virgin olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon (you may not need it all, but it’s best to have it to hand, 
just in case)

For the salad
300g salt cod (Norwegian, ideally), skinned
6 good tomatoes
Sea salt and black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil
2 heads little gem, leaves separated and washed
1 healthy spoonful aïoli (see above)
1 handful chopped curly parsley

First make the aïoli. Put the garlic into the chopping bowl of a food 
processor with a pinch of salt (this helps to break it up) and a little pepper. 
Whizz until finely pulped – this is important, because you don’t want garlic 
chippings in your aïoli. With the motor still running, add the egg yolk, let it 
meet the garlic for a moment, then carefully and slowly pour in the oil in a 
gentle stream. The emulsion should safely hold up to 300ml of oil; at this 
point, take a view and, if you can, add a little more oil. Add the lemon juice, 
tasting as you go, adjust the seasoning and refrigerate.

Soak the salt cod overnight in clean water, or perhaps early in the morning 
before your dinner, if you are using a lightly salted variety. You should soak 
it for at least 12 hours, and change the water a few times.

Cut the tomatoes in half lengthways, sprinkle with salt, pepper and oil, and 
roast in a medium oven for about 20 minutes. This will soften and slightly dry 
them, intensifying and sweetening their flavour. Leave to cool, making sure to 
reserve the cooking juices.

Put the little gem leaves and roast tomato halves in a bowl. Mix the oily 
tomato juices with a spoonful of aïoli.

When you’re ready to serve, bring a pan of water to a gentle simmer. Chop the 
cod into 2.5cm cubes and poach in the simmering water for five minutes. Be 
gentle, but don’t worry unduly if the cod does fall apart slightly: it will 
still taste delicious. Gently lift out the fish with a slotted spoon, shake off 
any excess water and add to the salad bowl. Spoon over the tomato/aïoli 
dressing, add the parsley, gently but thoroughly toss the salad, and eat.

 Thomasina Miers’ peach fattoush 
I once had a wonderful guacamole in Mexico that used peach instead of tomato, 
so I’ve applied the same thought processes to this summery take on one of my 
favourite Middle Eastern salads. Serves four to six.

2 large wholemeal pittas, cut open like a book
A good glug of extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ tsp sumac, plus extra to garnish
1 bunch asparagus – ie, about 8 stems – woody ends trimmed (our season has 
just ended, so it’ll have to be imported)
3 ripe, yellow-flesh peaches
1 handful mint leaves, torn
1 handful fresh oregano leaves
1 handful fennel tops, wild fennel or dill
1 small, crisp iceberg lettuce, cored, washed and chopped into chunks
½ cucumber, cut in half lengthways, then into chunky half moons
100g feta

For the dressing
½ garlic clove, peeled and crushed
1 pinch brown sugar
1 tsp pomegranate molasses
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
5 tbsp olive oil
Squeeze of lemon juice (optional)

Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Put the pitta on a large baking sheet, 
drizzle generously with olive oil and season with sea salt and sumac. Bake for 
10 minutes, until crisp and golden all over, then remove and set aside. Once 
cool enough to handle, break the bread into rough, bite-sized pieces.

Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to a boil and cook the asparagus for three to 
four minutes, so it’s done but still has crunch. Drain, refresh under cold 
water and set aside.

It’s easiest to make the dressing in a jar: put in the garlic, sugar, molasses 
and vinegar, screw on the lid, then shake until the sugar has dissolved. Add 
the oil, season to taste, add a little lemon juice, if you think it needs it, 
and set aside.

Peel, stone and chop the peaches, and put them in a large salad bowl; add the 
pitta crisps and all the other salad ingredients except the feta. Pour over the 
dressing, toss to coat everything, then crumble over the feta, sprinkle with a 
little more sumac and serve.
