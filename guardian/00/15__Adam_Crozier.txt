2012 ranking: 17

Well over halfway through his much-hyped plan to reinvigorate ITV, Adam Crozier
 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-crozier> has plenty of reasons to feel 
he might just be worth his five-year, £16m pay deal.

When he was unveiled as chief executive in January 2010, the broadcaster was 
climbing back from a £2.7bn loss and had a £1bn debt and pension deficit, with 
scarred investors valuing it at 56p a share.

ITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> is now debt free and made £348m 
in profits last year, fuelling a City love-in that has prompted the share price 
to climb above 150p on a market capitalisation of more than £6bn.

The biggest cause for cheer is the turnaround at ITV Studios, but there is 
also a growing story in the broadcaster's previously anaemic online, pay and 
interactive revenues.

Shows such Mr Selfridge have revitalised ITV Studios – profits are on track to 
hit more than £120m this year – and the company has been further buoyed by the 
acquisition of production companies such as Big Talk, which makes BBC show Rev, 
and Gurney, maker of US hit Duck Dynasty.

ITV is still overwhelmingly reliant on TV advertising, which accounts for 70% 
of its £2.2bn revenues.

This means the biggest issue facing Crozier is closing a new deal for The X 
Factor and Britain's Got Talent with Simon Cowell.
