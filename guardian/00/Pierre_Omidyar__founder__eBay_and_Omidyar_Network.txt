Pierre created eBay - an online platform that gives people equal access to 
information, opportunity, and tools to pursue their goals starting from the 
premise that people are basically good. Today Pierre is chair of eBay, which 
enables more than 90 million buyers and sellers to connect as well as send and 
receive payments through PayPal, which operates in 190 markets and 24 
currencies. In 2004, Pierre and his wife Pam founded Omidyar Network, a 
philanthropic investment firm that supports organisations in areas such as 
micro finance, property rights, and government transparency. Pierre serves as a 
trustee of Santa Fe Institute, Punahou School, and as a commissioner for 
president Barack Obama's commission on White House fellowships. He is also 
chief executive and publisher of Civil Beat, a news service in Hawaii. As 
philanthropists, Pierre and Pam have committed more than $1 billion to 
programmes supporting a range of causes from entrepreneurship and human rights 
to disaster relief.
