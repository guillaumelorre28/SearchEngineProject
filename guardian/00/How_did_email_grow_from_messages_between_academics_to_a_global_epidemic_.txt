Ray Tomlinson, the man who literally put the “@” in email, died on Saturday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/ray-tomlinson-email-inventor-and-selector-of-symbol-dies-aged-74>
, but his invention, which allowed electronic messages to spread across the 
internet and fill our lives and our inboxes on a daily basis, will live on.

Here is a brief look at what Tomlinson started and the evolution of email 
through the last half-century.

The very first version of what would become known as email was invented in 
1965 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as part of the university’s 
Compatible Time-Sharing System, which allowed users to share files and messages 
on a central disk, logging in from remote terminals.

American computer programmer Tomlinson arguably conceived the method of 
sending email between different computers across the forerunner to the 
internet, Arpanet, at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), 
introducing the “@” sign to allow messages to be targeted at certain users on 
certain machines.

At the age of 14, Shiva Ayyadurai writes a program called EMAIL for the 
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, which sent electronic

not this is the first use of the word email isup for debate

The rise of spam can be charted back to the very early days of Arpanet, but it 
wasn’t until the early 1990s that it hit users across the internet, when it was 
aimed at message boards and later email addresses.

April 1994 is the first recorded business practice of spam

 Microsoft’s Hotmail was one of the first popular, ISP-agnostic web-based email 
services. Photograph: Sean Smith for the Guardian 
Before Microsoft bought it for $400m, 1996 saw the launch of one of the first 
popular webmail email services called HoTMaiL developed by Sabeer Bhatia and 
Jack Smith. It was one of the first email services not tied to a particular ISP 
and adopted new HTML-based email formatting – hence the stylising of the brand 
name.

It was bought by Microsoft in 1997, rebranded MSN Hotmail, then Windows Live 
Hotmail and replaced by Outlook.com in 2013.

Email was cemented in the public consciousness with the notorious “you’ve got 
mail” sound of email arriving for AOL users, which formed the cornerstone of 
the 1998 Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan romantic comedy,You’ve Got Mail 
<http://youvegotmail.warnerbros.com/>.

By the late 1990s spam was becoming a real problem – inducted to the Oxford 
English Dictionary in 1998 – as more and more marketers jumped on the 
practically zero-cost outreach proposition and inundated our inboxes.

In 2002, the European Union released its Directive on Privacy and Electronic 
Communications, which included a section on spam that made it illegal to send 
unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes without prior consent 
of the recipient.

The US passed similar laws in 2004, although neither have been particularly 
effective at reducing the load.

Google’s popular email service, Gmail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gmail>, started life as an internal 
mail system for Google employees, developed by Paul Buchheit in 2001. It wasn’t 
unveiled to the public until a limited, invite-only beta release in 2004. It 
was made publicly available in 2007 and dropped its “beta” status in 2009.

 Email protocols started fighting back against spam in the early 2000s.

The first email standard to attempt to fight the deluge of spam by verifying 
senders was published after a five-year development. Sender Policy Framework 
was then implemented by a variety of anti-spam programs. A standard of 
authentication to attempt to prevent email spoofing and phishing was also 
released called DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).

Apple’s first iPhone was released in 2007, which began to introduce mobile 
email to the consumer masses. Until that point pre-capacitive consumer 
smartphones typically had limited email support, while RIM’sBlackBerry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blackberry> had brought the burden of 
work email to employee palms starting in 2003.

From humble internal communications beginnings, email now dominates a vast 
proportion of everyday life. An estimated 4.4bn email addresses are in use 
worldwide with 205bn emails sent per day in 2015, according to data from market 
research firm Radicati Group.

That number is set to increase to over 246bn emails a day by the end of 2019.
