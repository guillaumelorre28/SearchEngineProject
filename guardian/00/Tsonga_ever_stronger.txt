Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who brought down Andy Murray on the opening Monday, 
defeated his fellow Frenchman and eighth seed Richard Gasquet 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, 
6-3 to reach his first grand slam quarter-final. Only a couple of years ago his 
career was threatened by a serious back injury.

"It changed the way I thought about everything," said the 22-year-old. "I 
realised how much I had taken for granted, how lucky I had been up until then 
and how much I wanted to do my very best as a player providing I could stay 
healthy." He has played beautifully here and now plays Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 
for a place in the last four.
