A week later than planned, I finally went to see A Serious Man. I enjoyed it. 
Very Coen brothers -- unexplained plot points are shown, their import only to 
come clear 45 minutes later; weird pieces of non-sequitir dialogue; gruesome 
close-ups of ears and things; most of all, the completely dis-associated 
beginning, which I loved (they were the protagonist's forebears, maybe?). 
 
I found the sense of doom, the particularly Jewish idea of doom, that pervaded 
the action to be kind of sweet and affectionate. David Denbyemphatically did 
not.

 I read his review after seeing the film, and he made a couple of points that 
made me reassess my view a bit downward. See what you think.
 
But here's the real thing. The film was set in the spring-summer of 1967. 
There was even a calendar on the wall of an office of a young rabbi that was 
turned to May-June 1967. And yet, at one point in the movie, during a 
discussion having to do with a record-album mail-in membership group of the 
sort that used to exist in those days,references are made 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Serious_Man> to Santana's Abraxas and 
Creedence's Cosmo's Factory.
 
Those albums were released in 1970. Why would they make such an obvious 
mistake?
 
It almost has to be intentional, no? I mean it takes two minutes to go online 
and find, for example,a list like this one 
<http://rateyourmusic.com/list/joshvernon/top_albums_of_1967/>, of the big 
albums of 1967: Sgt. Pepper, Are You Experienced?, Disraeli Gears, Days of 
Future Passed and so forth, on down to Ennio Morricone's Good, Bad and Ugly 
soundtrack.
 
I actually had a couple of other problems. Danny's hair was too long for 1967. 
This was three years after Americans were introduced to the Beatles haircut, 
but trust me, most boys still wore short hair. Look at this sample page 
<http://www.whoa.org/67/67yearbook/105.jpg> from a 1967 yearbook I found online 
of boys Danny's age. Some boys wore hair across their foreheads, others did 
not, but no one had hair long enough in the back to rest on a shirt collar. His 
hair was more like 1972.
 
Also, I'm not sure how many 13-year-olds were smoking weed in 1967. I don't 
think pot became that widely available in middle America, such that pre-teens 
could score it, until the early 1970s.
 
On the other hand, my brother-in-law Ron, who knows cars inside and out and 
watches for these things when he goes to a period movie, told me he didn't spot 
a car that was of post-1967 vintage.
 
So why bother to get the cars right and let these other things be wrong? It 
annoyed me.
