Aruna's parents arranged a marriage for her earlier this year, but this was 
after she learned about the effects of child marriage. "I was confident enough 
to say no," she declares proudly. "I'm not going to marry at this age, because 
I want to be independent. I have to have some education. If I was married now, 
I would have to be a servant in my husband's house. I don't want that."

Empowering girls like Aruna through education helps them to realise that they 
do have a choice. For Aruna, her friends from a children's group meant she had 
a support network, unlike other girls who feel isolated, and do not know how to 
say no.

Confidence in knowing her rights, and in receiving support from group members 
encouraged Aruna to think of what was right for her. She explained the negative 
effects of child marriage to her parents and proposed a deal: "If you allow me 
not to get married, then I won't watch television and I will study instead and 
do extra well in my exams." Her parents eventually agreed, and she is about to 
start year 10 at school.KF
