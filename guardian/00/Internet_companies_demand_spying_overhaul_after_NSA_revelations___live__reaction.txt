Bill Clinton has attacked industrial espionage reportedly carried out by the 
NSA.

The former US president told Rio's Globo that "we shouldn't collect economic 
information under the pretext of security".

Clinton had been asked about a September Globo story 
<http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/09/nsa-documents-show-united-states-spied-brazilian-oil-giant.html>
, written by former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, that stated that the 
US had spied on the Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras.

The Washington Post reported this weekend that morale was down among NSA staff 
and some were annoyed that Obama had not visited their headquarters since the 
scandal broke – in contrast to George Bush, who visited in 2006 after earlier 
surveillance revelations. One former official told the Post:

The news — the Snowden disclosures — it questions the integrity of the NSA 
workforce. It’s become very public and very personal. Literally, neighbours are 
asking people, ‘Why are you spying on Grandma?’ And we aren’t. People are 
feeling bad, beaten down.

Last week Matthew Barzun, the US ambassador to Britain, said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/guardian-editor-alan-rusbridger-home-affairs-committee-nsa-live-coverage>
 that Barack Obama's review of intelligence gathering would report at the end

<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-06/obama-to-propose-curbs-on-nsa-spying-to-safeguard-privacy.html>
 that the five-member panel that is carrying out this review will come back 
next week. 

Obama has been talking to MSNBC 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/12/08/obama-hardball-national-security-agency-surveillance/3908533/>
 about possible changes that might come about as a result:

I'll be proposing some self-restraint on the NSA ... some reforms that can 
give people more confidence.

The people at the NSA, generally, are looking out for the safety of the 
American people. They are not interested in reading your emails. They're not 
interested in reading your text messages ... And we've got a big system of 
checks and balances, including the courts and Congress, who have the capacity 
to prevent that from happening.

Lobby group Privacy International has also backed the tech companies' stance 
<https://www.privacyinternational.org/blog/industry-giants-stand-against-surveillance-but-much-remains-to-be-done>
:

Companies have obligations to respect human rights and not be complicit in 
mass surveillance. Given what has been publicly revealed over the past six 
months, we must know for certain that the companies we entrust with our 
information on a daily basis are defending users and pushing back against 
government requests for our data. The launch of these industry principles today 
are a first step to restoring much of the trust in the industry that has been 
thrown into question since the release of the Snowden documents.

12.59pm GMT 

Commenting on the tech giants' letter, Michelle Richardson of the American 
Civil Liberties Union said:

The tech giants' message couldn't be any clearer or more welcome - the 
government's massive spying authorities must to be reined in immediately.

Widespread support for reform will only continue to grow until Congress and 
the administration deal with out-of-control spying head on by prohibiting 
indiscriminate surveillance.

Edward Snowden has been voted the Guardian's person of the year 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/edward-snowden-voted-guardian-person-of-year-2013>
 in an online poll of readers based on a list of 10 candidates chosen by the 
paper's staff. 

It is [his] personal sacrifice, as much as his revelations, that impressed 
most readers who voted for him.

"He gave his future for the sake of democratic values, transparency, and 
freedom," said Miriam Bergholz. Colin Walker wrote: "We need people like him to 
have the courage to forget about their own life in the cause of other people's 
freedom. Let's face it, his life is over as even if he goes back to the US he 
will face decades in prison and the personal sacrifice he has made is immense." 
A commenter identifying themselves as "irememberamerica" said he voted for 
Snowden "for his extraordinary and exemplary courage, and the historic value of 
his daring act. At every step, he has displayed an astonishing integrity and 
presence of mind. He is a great American and international patriot."

The NSA and GCHQ have made a push to infiltrate the massive communities 
playing online games, according to secret documents disclosed by whistleblower 
Edward Snowden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/nsa-spies-online-games-world-warcraft-second-life>
.James Ball reports:

The agencies, the documents show, have built mass-collection capabilities 
against the Xbox Live console network, which boasts more than 48 million 
players. Real-life agents have been deployed into virtual realms, from those 
Orc hordes in World of Warcraft to the human avatars of Second Life. There were 
attempts, too, to recruit potential informants from the games' tech-friendly 
users ...

According to the briefing notes, so many different US intelligence agents were 
conducting operations inside games that a "deconfliction" group was required to 
ensure they weren't spying on, or interfering with, each other.

If properly exploited, games could produce vast amounts of intelligence, 
according to the the NSA document. They could be used as a window for hacking 
attacks, to build pictures of people's social networks through "buddylists and 
interaction", to make approaches by undercover agents, and to obtain target 
identifiers (such as profile photos), geolocation, and collection of 
communications.

The ability to extract communications from talk channels in games would be 
necessary, the NSA paper argued, because of the potential for them to be used 
to communicate anonymously: Second Life was enabling anonymous texts and 
planning to introduce voice calls, while game noticeboards could, it states, be 
used to share information on the web addresses of terrorism forums.

Ball adds that there is no clear evidence that terrorist groups were using the 
virtual communities to communicate in the way intelligence agencies predicted. 

The NSA declined to comment on the surveillance of games. A spokesman for GCHQ 
said the agency did not "confirm or deny" the revelations but added: "All 
GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy 
framework which ensures that its activities are authorised, necessary and 
proportionate, and there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of 
state, the interception and intelligence services commissioners and the 
intelligence and security committee."

This is the website <http://reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/>, "Reform 
Government Surveillance", set up by the tech giants to push for surveillance 
reform. 

The website notes:

The undersigned companies believe that it is time for the world’s governments 
to address the practices and laws regulating government surveillance of 
individuals and access to their information.

While the undersigned companies understand that governments need to take 
action to protect their citizens’ safety and security, we strongly believe that 
current laws and practices need to be reformed.

Consistent with established global norms of free expression and privacy and 
with the goals of ensuring that government law enforcement and intelligence 
efforts are rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to 
oversight, we hereby call on governments to endorse the following principles 
and enact reforms that would put these principles into action.

It then runs through the five principles the companies seek to establish:

1. Limiting governments' authority to collect users' information.

2. Oversight and accountability.

3. Transparency about government demands.

4. Respecting the free flow of information.

5. Avoiding conflicts among governments.

British Home Office minister Damian Green is in Washington today to announce a 
collaboration between the NSA and its UK equivalent GCHQ to identify 
paedophiles exchanging pornographic material on the “dark web” – the part of 
the internet that cannot be accessed by search engines.

The Sunday Times reported yesterday that Google, Facebook and Microsoft 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft> staff, among others, would 
assist with the project.

Green told the paper 
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Tech/article1350375.ece>:

These are very, very hardcore criminals who either commercially, or just 
because that’s what they do, are exchanging these images with each other. They 
have gone to the trouble of being technically proficient enough to know about 
the dark web and to operate within it.

The point of the taskforce is to allow us to get inside the dark web and take 
action against people who are already experienced and proficient exchangers of 
child abuse images. We are putting the best brains around the world into the 
act of stopping it.

Green said a team from the UK’s National Crime Agency would create a secure 
database of child abuse images that could be cross-referenced with pictures of 
missing children in order to help find them.

Law enforcement agencies say the online tool Tor is used by people engaged in 
the trade of child abuse images, as well as terrorism and online drug dealing. 
It was developed with funding from the US government so journalists and 
activists around the world could maintain their privacy, and receives around 
60% of its funding from the US authorities.

In October the Guardian reported 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption>
 that the NSA had made repeated attempts to develop attacks against people 
using Tor, although the documents from Edward Snowden suggested that the 
fundamental security of the service remained intact.

International Business Times reported 
<http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/528387/20131208/paedophiles-dark-net-tor-child-abuse-nsa.htm>
 that part of the GCHQ-NSA collaboration will focus on trying to decrypt 
messages sent through Tor.

The European parliament is lining up Edward Snowden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden> to give evidence by video 
link this month, in spite of resistance by BritishConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives>, a Green MEP has announced.

As Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/edward-snowden-nsa-evidence-eu-parliament-surveillance>
:

Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Green MEP, said parliamentarians wanted Snowden 
to appear before the assembly's committee on civil liberties, justice and home 
affairs (LIBE).

Albrecht said it would represent a great success for the parliament's 
investigation into mass surveillance of EU citizens.

He said: "Half a year after the first publications from his collection of 
numerousNSA <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa> documents, the truth of 
which has not so far been refuted, there are still consequences as far as 
political responsibility is concerned.

"The basic political will is there. Now we will need to see if we can get a 
formal majority for a hearing and hope Snowden can keep his promise to answer 
questions on the affair."

The LIBE committee would most likely want questions on what role other 
European information services played in data gathering for the NSA, and whether 
servers and data networks in the EU were used as part of the process.

Albrecht claims Snowden had expressed interest via his lawyers in July, and 
that recent communications had firmed that up. In October, the Green party MEP 
Christian Ströbele went to Moscow to meet Snowden.

European parliament sources considered it likely committee members would vote 
in favour of a Snowden hearing, with the only vocal opposition from British 
Tory MEPs.

Apple: need for greater transparency on data requests

Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> has said it will push for 
greater transparency around government requests for information on its 
customers.

The technology giant, which is among eight leading firms to demand changes in 
a letter to Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/nsa-surveillance-tech-companies-demand-sweeping-changes-to-us-laws>
, said in a statement on Monday morning:

Apple takes privacy very seriously, and we work hard to protect our customers' 
data as they expect and deserve. We minimize the kinds of private information 
we store in the first place. In those cases where we do collect data, we are 
committed to providing transparency about the information demands we receive 
from governments, so we report them in as much detail as we're allowed by law.

We believe that dialogue and advocacy are the most productive way to bring 
about a change in government policies in this area, and we will continue to 
push for greater transparency about the requests we receive.

Brad Smith, general counsel at Microsoft, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme 
that internet firms have "awakened to the need for reform" following 
revelations from theNational Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Smith said: 

I believe people in our industry have long been under the impression that 
government access to user data was being governed by the law and legal process. 
It was only about a month ago when the Washington Post reported that the 
government appeared to be getting data in other ways as well ... that across 
our industry we learned there was more going on than we were aware. It is that 
broader concern that motivated us to unite and speak out collectively as an 
industry.

Smith said that more technology firms could join the coalition of eight in the 
future.

He added:

We've given a lot of thought to this. We obviously all want to live in a 
secure world but in world where security is balanced with personal freedom and 
privacy. Information technology is a powerful tool for individuals but people 
won't use technology they don't trust. In our view governments have put that 
trust at risk. Governments need to help restore it.

Google: snooping laws risk 'Balkanisation of internet'

Google's general counsel, Kent Walker, has warned that the current 
surveillance regime could cause "the Balkanisation of the internet" unless 
governments undertake proper reforms.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Walker said internet firms had 
united to demand changes to snooping laws because "we want to make sure 
policymakers and the public understand what's at stake if we don't get this 
right".

It's the Balkanisation of the internet, what someone called 'the splinternet'

Rifkind: surveillance must be 'proportionate'

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of the UK's parliamentary intelligence and 
security committee <http://isc.independent.gov.uk/>, has told the BBC Radio 4 
Today programme that the onus is on governments to ensure that surveillance 
laws are proportionate.

He said:

First of all there is a need for public debate in free society as to the 
proper balance between the privacy of citizens and the security of society as a 
whole to prevent a terrorist attack ... What the internet companies are saying 
is not that it's illegal but perhaps there's a debate for the law being changed.

I think the public should be aware that ... when bulk data is collected that 
does not mean people are sitting reading everybody's emails.

I think the issue we all want to address is of proportionality. The onus has 
to be on government to decide what the policy should be.

I think there is a perfectly reasonable argument for saying [that] if the 
human eye is not reading people's emails we do have to extract that from this 
vast number of emails, the tiny number that relate to terrorist plots ...

In the modern world the terrorists use all the technology available to them so 
it would be foolish for intelligence agencies not to use that technology. 
However, they cannot be allowed to determine themselves what the rules are. 
They don't at the moment.

A very timely piece 
<http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/12/16/131216fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all>
 has been published by the New Yorker about why Obama has so far stalled 
reining in surveillance in America. It is a semi-long read but a good one to 
bookmark for when you have the time.

In recent years, Americans have become accustomed to the idea of advertisers 
gathering wide swaths of information about their private transactions. The 
N.S.A.’s collecting of data looks a lot like whatFacebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> does, but it is fundamentally 
different. It inverts the crucial legal principle of probable cause: the 
government may not seize or inspect private property or information without 
evidence of a crime.

The N.S.A. contends that it needs haystacks in order to find the terrorist 
needle. Its definition of a haystack is expanding; there are indications that, 
under the auspices of the “business records” provision of the Patriot Act, the 
intelligence community is now trying to assemble databases of financial 
transactions and cell-phone location information. [US Senator Dianne] Feinstein 
maintains that data collection is not surveillance. But it is no longer clear 
if there is a distinction.

Last week Microsoft, one of the signatories to the letter, posted more details 
<http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/12/04/protecting-customer-data-from-government-snooping.aspx>
 about what measures it would be taking to try to curb web surveillance:

Like many others, we are especially alarmed by recent allegations in the press 
of a broader and concerted effort by some governments to circumvent online 
security measures – and in our view, legal processes and protections – in order 
to surreptitiously collect private customer data. In particular, recent press 
stories have reported allegations of governmental interception and collection – 
without search warrants or legal subpoenas – of customer data as it travels 
between customers and servers or between company data centres in our industry.

If true, these efforts threaten to seriously undermine confidence in the 
security and privacy of online communications. Indeed, government snooping 
potentially now constitutes an “advanced persistent threat,” alongside 
sophisticated malware and cyber-attacks.

In light of these allegations, we’ve decided to take immediate and coordinated 
action in three areas:

· We are expanding encryption across our services. 

· We are reinforcing legal protections for our customers’ data. 

· We are enhancing the transparency of our software code, making it easier for 
customers to reassure themselves that our products do not contain back doors.

Computer and data scientists are the nuclear scientists of our age,

The security of users’ data is critical, which is why we’ve invested so much
