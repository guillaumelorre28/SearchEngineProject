It's the internet fad of the week: links to a photograph of a vandalised 
Microsoft poster in the East End of London have been circulating the net like 
wildfire today.

The image shows a poster, hung high above a busy junction near Liverpool 
Street station, the wording of which has been carefully altered. The message 
"Suddenly everything clicks" has been changed to read: "Suddenly everything 
sucks".

Our deepthroat - signing himself only as Dr D Adbust of Bishopsgate NCP - gave 
only a simple message: scrawled on the back of one snap was: "Thought you might 
be interested in some Microsoft bashing".

It is not known if "Dr D Adbust" is connected to the spoof-advertising site, 
Adbusters <https://www.theguardian.com/world/adbusters>.
