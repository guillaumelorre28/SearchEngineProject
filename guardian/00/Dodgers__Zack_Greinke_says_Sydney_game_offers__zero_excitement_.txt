Travelling to Sydney to open the Major League Baseball season is proving too 
much for theLos Angeles Dodgers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/los-angeles-dodgers>, with pitcher Zack 
Greinke claiming there is “absolutely zero excitement” for coming to Australia.

The Dodgers are also reportedly considering leaving their best pitcher, 
Clayton Kershaw, back in the United States, with their 22-23 March opening 
series against theArizona Diamondbacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/arizona-diamondbacks> in Sydney looking more 
like a chore for the side than a historic chance to spread the baseball gospel.

Greinke is LA’s No2 pitcher behind Kershaw, and would likely start in one of 
the two matches to be played at the SCG next month.

But the 30-year-old says he’d rather not come.

“I would say there is absolutely zero excitement for it,” Greinke told ESPN. 
“There just isn’t any excitement to it. I can’t think of one reason to be 
excited for it.”

The MLB’s landmark move to open the season proper in Australia for the first 
time means the Dodgers and Diamondbacks are starting their season more than a 
week before the rest of the league.

Arizona pitchers Brandon McCarthy and Patrick Corbin have spoken of their 
desire to be a part of history in Sydney, but it seems the Dodgers may feel the 
venture is beneath them.

To not bring drawcard Kershaw down under would be a major blow for the 
concept, given theMLB <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb> would be eager to 
showcase its biggest stars to a new market.

However, the Dodgers are reportedly trying to manage Kershaw’s workload and 
want him on deck to for their US opener on 30 March and their home opener in LA 
on 4 April.

Manager Don Mattingly has said they don’t want Kershaw to overexert himself 
too early in the season after pitching a career-high amount of innings last 
year. Despite his lack of enthusiasm, Greinke says he would pitch in Australia 
if required.
