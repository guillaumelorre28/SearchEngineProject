In fact, more banknotes are printed in times of crisis; they're needed to deal 
with families who withdraw cash from "untrustworthy" banks and store it under 
their mattresses and in deposit boxes. In 2008, Europe printed nearly 50m €500 
notes in a month to satisfy demand for "paper currency".

In 1920s Germany, so much money was printed, the government ran out of paper, 
and used sweet wrappers and playing cards. When this happens, the value of 
money dies. Imagine your pocket money rising to £1m, but chocolate bars cost 
£2m: you're a millionaire, but worse off – and you'd need a wheelbarrow of cash 
to pay for the sweets. Now, as most money is electronic, governments don't need 
to print banknotes, and instead let the value of houses and shares increase, so 
wealthy people feel richer than they are. They also gave it a new name, 
"quantitative easing", so no one, even above the age of 10, could understand it.
