Johnston Press <https://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press>, the 
regional newspaper publisher with a big pension scheme commitment, has managed 
to reduce the deficit by more than £50m.

In a statement on its website 
<http://www.johnstonpress.co.uk/investors/news/reduction-pension-deficit>, the 
company points out that the deficit stood at £90m in January 2015.

Its announcement follows a study of its pension scheme liabilities. In 
addition, under new rules drawn up by trustees, the company says it “will now 
be entitled to participate in any surplus when the scheme closes.”

Full details of the study, and the assumptions used in calculating the changes 
to the scheme’s deficit, will be revealed during a preliminary announcement on 
22 March of last year’s results.

Two weeks ago, a report by investment bank Liberum extolled the virtues of 
Johnston Press’s ability to cut costs as the group’s chief executive, Ashley 
Highfield, let it be known that he was preparedto sell off some of its 220 
titles
