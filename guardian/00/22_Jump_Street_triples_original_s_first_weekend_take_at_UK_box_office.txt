The winner

Sequels to hit comedies have a knack of opening bigger than the original film, 
and so it has proved with22 Jump Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/22-jump-street>, which debuts with £4.85m, 
more than triple the amount managed by21 Jump Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146336/21-jump-street> (£1.56m) in its 
first weekend. 21 Jump Street went on to prove a big winner with audiences, 
reaching £10.1m, before finding fresh converts on DVD. A big chunk of this 
enlarged audience has evidently come out for 22 Jump Street on opening weekend.

Hit comedy franchises are relatively rare, although sequels to Ted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ted> and Horrible Bosses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142717/horrible-bosses> are on the way, 
as well asThe Inbetweeners Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-inbetweeners-movie>. The Hangover Part II 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hangover-part-ii> kicked off its run with 
a giant £10.41m here, including previews of £2.03m. The originalThe Hangover 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hangover> debuted with £3.19m, including 
£444,000 in previews, so the sequel more than tripled it.

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1300914,00.html>
 began its run in 2004 with £556,000. SequelAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/anchorman-2-the-legend-continues> opened last 
December with £4.55m, more than eight times the debut of its predecessor, 
although ticket-price inflation is also a factor here, given the long gap 
between films.

Comedy spinoffs that do not carry the brand name of the original film have 
tended to fare less well.Get Him to the Greek 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/136311/get-him-to-the-greek> debuted 
with £1.57m, including £495,000 in previews. PredecessorForgetting Sarah 
Marshall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/123997/forgetting.sarah.marshall> began 
with £2.14m, including £394,000 in previews.This Is 40 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/this-is-40> kicked off with £1.23m, including 
£319,000 in previews, followingKnocked Up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119558/knocked.up>'s debut of £1.58m.

Given the remarkable lack of competition from new releases in the coming 
weeks, as distributors swerve the World Cup,22 Jump Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/22-jump-street> is well placed for a 
sustained run.

Existing titles affected most by the arrival of 22 Jump Street are comedies A 
Million Ways to Die in the West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/million-ways-to-die-in-the-west>, down 60%, 
andBad Neighbours <https://www.theguardian.com/film/bad-neighbours>, down 68%.

The runner-up

 Dropping a notch to second place, Disney's Maleficent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/maleficent> fell by a relatively mild 32% 
from its opening weekend. After 12 days it had grossed a healthy £11.06m. After 
two weekends,Snow White and the Huntsman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147374/snow-white-and-the-hunstman> 
stood at £9.55m, andOz the Great and Powerful 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/oz-the-great-and-powerful> had reached £7.67m 
(albeit from only 10 days of play due to a differing previews strategy).

The big movies of late spring and early summer this year featured male 
protagonists such asCaptain America 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-america-the-winter-soldier>, 
Spider-Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-amazing-spider-man-2>, 
Wolverine <https://www.theguardian.com/film/x-men-days-of-future-past> and 
Aaron Taylor-Johnson's naval officer inGodzilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/godzilla>. Maleficent is the first major film 
sinceDivergent <https://www.theguardian.com/film/divergent> to feature a female 
protagonist, and it is clearly offering something distinct in the marketplace.

The other relatively gentle faller in the top 10 is Doug Liman's The Edge of 
Tomorrow <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-edge-of-tomorrow>, down 35%. The 
Tom Cruise sci-fi actioner has reached £4.29m after 10 days.

The flop
 Unhappy commercial outcome … Grace of Monaco, starring Nicole Kidman. 
Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar/Warner Bros 
Following Grace of Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/film/grace-of-monaco>'s 
critical evisceration at the Cannes film festival, Warner Bros must have been 
braced for an unhappy commercial outcome, and may not have been too surprised 
by the numbers that trickled in on opening weekend: £239,000 from 332 sites, a 
£719 screen average. The film was never likely to earn much critical love, but 
letting the Cannes press delegates be its first audience doesn't seem the 
wisest choice.

Grace of Monaco faced additional challenges including lack of awareness of its 
principal character (relative to, say, last year'sDiana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/diana>) and even less for its main storyline 
(a tax dispute with Charles de Gaulle's France). Marketable assets include lead 
actor Nicole Kidman.

In contrast, Diana, which was considered a significant box-office 
disappointment at the time, began its run with £623,000 from an overly 
ambitious 523 cinemas, delivering a £1,191 average.

Kidman has suffered a patchy run of form recently. Last year, Stoker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146645/stoker> debuted with £368,000 
from 261 venues. This January,The Railway Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-railway-man> fared much better, opening 
with £1.23m, although Kidman's role was supporting (to Colin Firth). She is 
upcoming inBefore I Go to Sleep 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/30/2014-film-preview-thriller> (with 
Firth again) and inPaddington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/16/colin-firth-paddington-bear-nicole-kidman>
 (voice of Firth).

The arthouse market
 Despite critical acclaim, indie release Fruitvale Station underperformed at 
the box office. Photograph: Ron Koeberer 
Unless you count Grace of Monaco, there are no films for arthouse audiences in 
the top 10. Ken Loach'sJimmy's Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jimmys-hall>, falling 38% from its opening, 
is at number 13, and has cumed £335,000 to date. Thanks to a live satellite 
link-up with the band in attendance at the Sheffield Doc/Fest,Pulp: A Film 
About Life, Death and Supermarkets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/pulp-a-film-about-life-death-and-supermarkets>
 achieved £70,417 from 120 sites. The next afternoon, Strauss'sDer Rosenkavalier
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/19/der-rosenkavalier-review-glyndebourne-jones-ticciati>
 streamed live into cinemas from Glyndebourne, grossing £75,000 from 59 venues. 
Evidently, there have been significant variations, since the owner of one 
independent cinema (in Uckfield, Sussex) posted on social media that the 
Glyndebourne event had outgrossed all the performances of all the films all 
weekend in his site, added together.

On Friday, D-Day 70 Years On was beamed into cinemas from London's Royal 
Albert Hall, delivering a handy £288,000 from 179 venues.

While special events are proving a salvation to independent exhibitors, 
Fruitvale Station <https://www.theguardian.com/film/fruitvale-station> is the 
latest indie film to underperform. Despite much critical acclaim, a rare double 
win (both the grand jury prize and audience award) at the 2013 Sundance film 
festival, and buzz building on lead actor Michael B Jordan, UK audiences 
shrugged, with a gross of £30,200 from 40 sites, a £754 average. The fact that 
the film opened in the US last July, where it is available on demand and on 
DVD, may have been a factor.

Lower down the chart, there are some eye-poppingly tiny numbers, including 
£738 from 10 sites for indie black comedyCheap Thrills 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/cheap-thrills-review>, and £124 
from five screens forI Declare War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/i-declare-war-review>. It's 
likely that more UK critics have watched these films at press screenings than 
audience members have paid to see them. In fairness, the theatrical component 
was never likely to be a significant portion of the revenue pie, and Cheap 
Thrills should perform on DVD when it arrives on 28 July. I Declare War hits 
Amazon on 30 June.

The record breaker

Not tracked by data gatherer Rentrak, but worthy of remark, are the 42,000 
tickets Secret Cinema sold in four hours on Thursday for itsBack to the Future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/back-to-the-future> run, beginning 24 July. 
With adult tickets priced at £53.50, children's at £25 and family packages at 
£140, it's impossible to know the exact gross of this event, but somewhere 
between £1.5m and £2.2m, probably closer to the latter. The run has now wisely 
been extended to August 31, and tickets go on sale tomorrow (Wednesday June 11) 
at 1pm.

Secret Cinema has now divided its brand into "Secret Cinema presents …" 
(replacing Future Cinema, where the film title is disclosed) and "Secret Cinema 
Tell No One". Secret Cinema was always the more famous brand, but many audience 
members want to know which film they are buying into, so the repositioning is a 
savvy move.

The future
 Coming soon … Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Sam Reid in period drama Belle. Photograph:

Thanks to 22 Jump Street and other solid performers, takings are a healthy 51% 
up on the equivalent weekend a year ago, when Will Smith inAfter Earth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/after-earth> delivered a disappointing debut. 
In 2013, the subsequent weekend sawMan of Steel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148371/man-of-steel> reboot the market, 
followed later in June byWorld War Z 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/world-war-z> and Despicable Me 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/despicable-me-2>.

There are much leaner pickings on offer in June this year, due to World Cup 
football, and this weekend UK film distributors are being exceptionally 
cautious. Period dramaBelle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/belle> will 
battle true-crime dramaDevil's Knot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-devil-s-knot>, horror Oculus 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/?ref_=nv_sr_1>, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 
family-friendlyThe Young and Prodigious TS Spivet 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981107/> and comedy The Hooligan Factory 
<http://thehooliganfactory.com/>. Expect some casualties.
