A bad 24 hours for the Williams sisters was completed when Venus was knocked 
out of theAustralian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>. 
After Serena had been eliminated by Serbia's Jelena Jankovic and the Americans 
had been beaten in the doubles, Venus lost her quarter-final against the 
20-year-old Ana Ivanovic, also of Serbia, who had never beaten her before.

"I think what is important to me is what goes on in my head," said Venus, who 
intimated she will not play in the French Open this year. "I've been a champion 
and I have full expectations and aspirations to continue to play high-quality 
tennis and to continue to be a champion. Serena and I don't have anything to 
prove."
