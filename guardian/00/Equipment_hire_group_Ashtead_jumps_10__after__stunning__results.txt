Equipment hire may not be the most glamorous of businesses, but Ashtead is 
sparkling after better than expected results.

The company, which rents out small tools to construction and power generation 
equipment, said first quarter profits jumped 82% to a record £61.4m. A gradual 
improvement in the US, where it conducts some 80% of its business through its 
Sunbelt subsidiary, helped offset the difficult conditions in the UK. Chief 
executive Geoff Drabble said it now expected a full year result "materially 
ahead of our previous expectations." Analysts said the company was benefiting 
from a 15% increase in the size of its fleet over the past year, giving it the 
scope to increase the amount on rental as cash-strapped companies hired 
equipment rather than buying it. In the market Ashtead's shares have jumped 
nearly 11%, up 30.2p to 312.7p. Paul Jones at Panmure Gordon described the 
results as "stunning" and raised his target price from 317p to 344p:
 A fantastic first quarter from Ashtead, with profits up 82% on 21% better 
revenues. The majority of this revenue increase has come from additional fleet 
investment in 2011, though a 4% increase in yields points to the start of a 
potential recovery in US markets in general and bodes well for further growth 
(albeit against increasingly difficult comps) given second quarter momentum has 
continued in the same vein. With market share gains suggesting the Ashtead 
model is better than most, and good operational gearing producing improving 
margins, prospects look increasingly good.

We increase both our April 2013 and 2014 forecasts on this update, from £160m 
to £180m and £180m to £210m.
