 The roof of Cootamundra high school was ripped off by high winds. 
A NSW State Emergency Service duty operations officer, Jason Simms, said crews 
had been called to about 400 jobs across the state in the past 24 hours owing 
to winds reaching 100km/h, with the Illawarra and south coast areas the worst 
hit.
“There were trees and branches down, some causing damage to cars and some 
roads blocked by trees that were blown over,” Simms said.

The ACT SES received more than 130 calls for help.

In Canberra, the suburbs of Downer, Dickson, Ainslie, Kambah, Watson and 
Waramanga were left without power after winds of up to 100km/h toppled trees 
and brought down powerlines. Work was continuing to restore power to Giralang, 
Lyneham and Aranda.

A Bureau of Meteorology’s severe weather warning was cancelled on Wednesday 
morning, but strong and gale-force marine wind warnings are in place from the 
Eden coast up to the Macquarie coast.

In the state’s Riverina area, Cootamundra high school was left without a roof 
after gales tore it off.
