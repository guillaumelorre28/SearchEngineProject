species on the left and a map will be generated which shows the likelihood of a 
sighting throughout the uk.

The data is from the 2009 RSPB Big Birdwatch survey 
<http://www.rspb.org.uk/birdwatch/index.asp> and is provided through the 
Guardian newspaper's newdatastore project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/data-store>, which aims to make public different 
data sets from around the world for use in applications such as this."
