Einstein’s General Relativity provides an elegant description of how space, 
time and matter affect one another. It makes precise predictions of 
gravitational effects, which have been verified by many measurements.

But if we use the theory to try to understand the motion of galaxies, we get 
the wrong answer, unless we invent a new form of so-called ‘dark’ matter. This 
is not a small correction – there needs to be much more of the Dark Matter than 
normal matter, and what is more, it doesn’t seem to be made up of quarks and 
electrons like all other matter. In fact it doesn’t seem to be made up of any 
of the particles in the Standard Model of particle physics.


Furthermore, the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, rather than – as 
you might expect if it started of with a big bang and then gravity takes over – 
slowing down. This effect we ascribe to something we call ‘Dark Energy’. Dark 
Energy can be accommodated within General Relativity, but only by adding an 
absurdly precise ‘cosmological constant’, which looks very weird, or 
“unnatural” as a theoretical physicist would put it.

the first plausible theory I have come across in which the LHC can to 
contribute to understanding Dark Energy

It gets worse. Dark Energy is a sort of ‘energy in empty space’, and particle 
physics also predicts this kind of energy, due to quantum fluctuations of the 
Standard Model – including and especially theHiggs boson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson>. But these fluctuations would 
naively lead to so much Dark Energy that atoms themselves (never mind 
theoretical physicists) would never form in the first place.

That’s wrong, obviously.

And then there’s the nagging, possibly connected, fact that we don’t have a 
way of making General Relativity and quantum theory work together at very high 
energies.

Since gravity is a common thread here, all of these problems might seem to 
imply that General Relativity needs to be modified in some way. That’s a 
thought that has occurred to many physicists. However, General Relativity is so 
subtle, and so, well,General, that replacing it, or even successfully tweaking 
it, is a very hard thing to do.

Still, physicists are persistent, and there are new ideas coming forward all 
the time. One possible tweak is to postulate a new particle which carries a 
‘fifth force’ (the other four forces being electromagnetism, the weak and 
strong interactions, and gravity).

Consider a pointillist painting. At short distances, dots. Further away, a 
picture. Further away still, a dot again.

To explain Dark Energy, this force has to affect all matter – as gravity 
itself does – and operate over large distances. Such forces have been looked 
for already, and if they affect the motion of the planets in the solar system, 
for example, they have to be enormously more feeble than gravity, otherwise we 
would have seen them already. But if they are enormously more feeble than the 
gravity between stars and galaxies, they won’t make any difference to the Dark 
Energy or Dark Matter problems, so that’s a waste of time.

One way potential way around this conundrum is a process called ‘screening’, 
in which the strength of a force depends upon the environment it is in. Arecent 
paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06051> from a group at the University of 
Nottingham describes a model in which the force is screened by matter itself. 
In dense regions of the universe (like the Earth, for instance) the force is 
hidden, while in empty space, the force can operate. In the case of the Dark 
Energy problem, which is what the theory was aiming for, this can provide 
exactly what the data need. The force can make the universe accelerate at large 
distances, while having no measurable effect on the orbit of the planets. As a 
bonus, this new force can also have asignificant impact on the way galaxies 
rotate <https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07529>, which might at least partially solve 
the dark matter issue as well.

To a physicist, the way this new force works is reminiscent of the way the 
theory of Brout, Englert and Higgs gives mass to fundamental particles. It 
involves a scalar boson – a particle like the Higgs boson, which has no spin – 
and it involves the idea of symmetry breaking¹. But I am aware that using the 
Higgs as an analogy to explain something to a general audience is not a winning 
strategy, so here’s a better attempt, I hope. Consider a pointillist painting:

 * When averaged over dense regions of space, a symmetry hides the fifth 
force. This is like looking at the picture above from a metre or so away. The 
dots are hidden in the colours and landscape of the painting.

 * Close to the painting, the dots are visible. In the same way, for things 
the size of atoms or smaller, the averaging doesn’t happen, so the fifth force 
may show up.

 * And on very long distance scales, space is empty, so the density is low and 
again the force reappears. Similarly, a very long way from the painting, it is 
just a single dot again. 
All this is speculative, of course. Speculative ideas are one thing we expect 
from theorists. Another thing we expect is testable predictions, and this model 
seems to be testable in an excitingly wide range of experiments. Upcoming 
observatories, such as the European Space AgencyEUCLID 
<http://sci.esa.int/euclid/> mission and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic 
Instrument 
<https://www.ucl.ac.uk/silva/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/desi>
, will characterise gravity and dark energy on astrophysical scales. Precise
atomic physics experiments <https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1409> could measure the 
effect of the fifth force on atoms, and most interestingly to me personally 
(since I work on it), this is the first plausible theory I have come across in 
which theLarge Hadron Collider <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04299> can 
contribute to the understanding Dark Energy.
