Shappi Khorsandi, Doc Brown,Kerry Godliman

Maguire.

Murray (aka the pub landlord) says: “It’s great to be able to help Index do 
their bit in keeping freedom of expression alive in the UK.”

Index has a history of championing comedians, satirists and cartoonists, along 
with other people, who face persecution, imprisonment, violence and even death.

It promotes and defends the right to free speech, including press freedom of 
course, across the globe.

All proceeds from the event on 30 July, which will take place Union Chapel in 
Islington (that’s in northLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> - no 
satire intended), will be used to support Index’s work.

Doors open at 6.30pm for a 7.30pm start. Tickets: £40 (for premium seating and 
exclusive drinks reception with VIP guests), £20 general, £15 concessions. They 
are availablehere
