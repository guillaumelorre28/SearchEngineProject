World No1 Jason Day <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jason-day> has pushed 
to a one-shot lead after the second round of the World Golf Championships 
Bridgestone Invitational.

Despite another performance where he struggled to find fairways off the tee, 
the 28-year-old rode some late birdies to a one-under-69 and a four-under-136 
total at Firestone Country Club.

It leaves the Queenslander one clear of his nearest rival and on track for a 
fourth win, and second WGC title this season.

Swede David Lingmerth is second after a tidy 67 left him at three under.

Fellow Australian Adam Scott <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-scott>, 
the 2011 champion in Akron and also a winner of a WGC event earlier this year 
in Miami, pushed into contention with a 68 which left him one under overall and 
a tie for sixth.

Overnight leader William McGirt (74), Emiliano Grillo (71) and Scott Piercy 
(69) share third at two under while world No2 Jordan Spieth (71) sits three 
back with Scott.

Day hit just seven of 14 fairways in the round but made several clutch par 
putts before back-to-back birdies on 16 and 17 after an earlier one on the 
third separated him from the field.

His only blemishes came when he inexplicably three-putted from 16 feet for a 
bogey on the 10th and failed to get up and down from the fringe on 18 to halve 
his lead into the weekend.

Scott jagged two birdies in his opening three holes before giving a shot back 
at the fourth with a three-putt, but further birdies at six and 10 had him 
trending up.

A bogey at 14 was tempered with a birdie at 17 but a final hole bogey left him 
three back.

The remaining Australians are struggling.

Matt Jones (70) is four over, Marcus Fraser carded a 73 to be six over, Marc 
Leishman (72) is eight over, Nathan Holman (73) sits 10 over and Steven 
Bowditch (72) is 14 over.
