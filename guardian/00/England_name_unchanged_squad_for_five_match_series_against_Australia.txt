England have named an unchanged 14-man squad for the five-match NatWest series 
against Australia which starts at Lord's on Friday.

Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Tim Bresnan, who were all released before the 
washed-out third match of the 50-over series against West Indies at Headingley 
last Friday, return in place of Chris Woakes, Stuart Meaker and James Tredwell.

England will be aiming for a seventh consecutive win in a home one-day series 
but Australia are top of the ICC's World Rankings for the 50-over game. England 
are joint fourth with Sri Lanka.

Australia will complete their preparations for the series in a day-night match 
at Chelmsford on Tuesday against an Essex team for whom England's ODI captain 
Alastair Cook and Ravi Bopara have been made available. The England management 
have also released Steve Finn, Eoin Morgan and Craig Kieswetter to play in 
Friends Life t20 fixtures for their counties on Tuesday.
