Azealia Banks played to one of the fullest tents at Splendour in the Grass 
festival <https://www.theguardian.com/music/splendour-in-the-grass-2015> in 
Byron Bay this weekend but a throwaway tweet by someone who wasn’t even there 
has kicked off a war of words in which the US artist labels Australian 
audiences as terrible, violent and belligerent.

When Paul Brown, a radio broadcaster from Brisbane, tweeted congratulations to 
Banks for “completing her first ever full Australian concert”, the singer 
quickly bit back.

“You guys are terrible crowds to play for. You’re violent and belligerent and 
I simply … will not put my safety at risk. I would’ve walked off stage had 
someone thrown something,” she said in a series of tweets.

Both Brown and Banks’s comments seem to reference the rapper’s 2013 walkouts 
at the Listen Out festivals in Sydney and Melbourne, where audiences began 
chucking cans on stage. These curtailed sets and her wider reputation for 
no-shows led Guardian Australia to questionwhether Banks would turn up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/23/splendour-in-the-grass-2015-what-were-looking-forward-to>
 for her much touted Splendour in the Grass 2015 appearance.

In the event, she pulled one of the biggest crowds of the weekend, with 
reviewer Fred McConnell praising her performance, even if she was upstaged in 
the energy stakes by her own team. “Banks focused on the crowd and seemed happy 
to be here, which is notoriously not always the case,”he wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/27/splendour-2015-review-roundup-azealia-banks-dandy-warhols-rubens-uv-boi>
. “However, it was the backup dancers we came away talking about.”

After her festival appearance, Banks performed sideshows in Sydney and 
Melbourne before becoming embroiled with Brown and others on Twitter.

“You guys are too far away and honestly, the show guarantees are never really 
worth the trip,” she wrote, “but I love my fans and will do anything to make 
them happy, Sincerely AB.”

When 20-year-old Nic Kelly criticised the singer’s attitude and told her not 
to “bother doing another show, thanks”, Banks told him to “stay in your place”.

It’s not Banks’ first beef with Australians. Since 2012 she and the rapper 
Iggy Azalea have had a fractious relationship on social media. It culminated in 
December 2014 in a heated debate about US race issues and the perceived white 
appropriation of black hip-hop culture, in which Banks called Azalea“Igloo 
Australia” <https://twitter.com/AZEALIABANKS/status/540299044464369664>.


Not everyone is jumping to criticise Banks for her latest outburst, however. 
One Twitter user praised the singer for “always telling it like it is”.
see air ahhh (@thewildsie) 
@AZEALIABANKS <https://twitter.com/AZEALIABANKS> is always telling it like it 
is & when she offends she doesn't offer up some apology to save face she stands 
behind her truth.
