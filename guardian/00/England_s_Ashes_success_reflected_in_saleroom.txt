 The warm glow of England's Ashes cricket success continued into the salerooms 
yesterday, when a single stump used on the first three days of the Trent Bridge 
Test match sold for £850.
The stump, emblazoned with the npower sponsor's logo, had been put on sale by 
teenager Sean Stevens, from Oxfordshire, who bought it on the auction website 
eBay for £97.

England won the 4th Test by three wickets, before winning the series 2-1.

The stump was sold by Bonhams, of Chester, at a sale of sporting memorabilia.

An Olympic torch from the 1948 London Olympics fetched £2,500.
