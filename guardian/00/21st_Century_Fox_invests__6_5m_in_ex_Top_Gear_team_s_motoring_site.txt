James May and Richard Hammond, along with producer Andy Wilman left the BBC 
last year and are now working on the Grand Tour for Amazon, due out this autumn.

However, in the interim they began work on DriveTribe, which describes itself 
as a “the world’s digital hub for motoring”, giving professional writers and 
video-makers, as well as a community of users, the ability to make and upload 
content.

The quartet are working with Ernesto Schmitt, who formerly founded Zeebox, a 
social TV app, with one of the people behind the BBC’s iPlayer, Anthony Rose.

“21st Century Fox are a world-leading media business with a track record of 
extraordinary savviness and innovation,” said Schmitt, who is DriveTribe’s 
chief executive.

“It’s extremely pleasing to have 21st Century Fox take note of our venture, 
and we look forward to working with them on redefining how audiences discover 
and engage with content, through the use of technology and community.”

Fox Networks Group chief executive, Peter Rice, said: “We saw the DriveTribe 
platform and we were blown away by its ingenuity.

“We’re excited to collaborate with the DriveTribe team on this new approach to 
digital content and to help them expand their business on a worldwide basis.”

DriveTribe has hired former BuzzFeed UK managing editor Cate Sevilla as its 
director of content operations.
