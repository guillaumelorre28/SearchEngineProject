Surely Australia can use this Paris climate agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement> to finally 
end the barren, wasted years of climate policy war.

There‚Äôs already an uneasy ceasefire, a letup in the mind-numbing slogans. 
Labor is promising some kind of emissions trading scheme and a relatively 
ambitious renewable energy target ‚Äì but no details yet lest it once again feel 
the barrage of a full bore axe-the-tax scare campaign. Under the sceptical gaze 
of his party‚Äôs hard right, Malcolm Turnbull is also unwilling to even hint at 
the policy changes he and his minister Greg Hunt appear to be planning when 
they revise Australia‚Äôs policy after the election.

Paris climate deal: key points at a glance

But now the world has entered a binding agreement ‚Äì imperfect and incomplete 
in parts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points>
‚Äì but absolutely clear on one thing: all countries have agreed to reduce their 
greenhouse emissions and keep reducing them.

That has some very big implications for Australia.

 * We will be under pressure to revise our emission reduction target out to 
2030 ‚Äì the one we brought to Paris ‚Äì by 2020. Given that we are among the 
world‚Äôs highest per capita emitters and our target has been rated inadequate by 
the Climate Tracker think tank and other analysts, we are going to be under 
strong pressure to increase its ambition. 
 * To meet even the current target, and certainly a higher one, we will have 
to get real about emission reductions, including from electricity generation. 
We will have to find a way to retire the old brown coal-fired generators and 
start reducing industrial carbon pollution.Australian business and environment 
groups 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/07/climate-summit-held-by-business-and-green-groups-to-end-six-year-policy-war>
 are begging political parties to come up with some kind of stable, sensible 
plan. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and multiple heads of 
state in Paris think the best policy is a carbon price, using Paris to launch 
the carbon pricing leadership coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/10/australia-signs-up-clear-carbon-trading-rules-hinting-policy-change>
. Greg Hunt spent his time in Paris continuing to pretend that his emissions 
reduction fund (ERF) is a carbon price and also an idea being adopted around 
the word,but the experts, when asked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/australia-approved-coalmine-because-it-isnt-a-neo-colonialist-power-greg-hunt-claims>
, said reverse auctions like the ERF were useful additions to a carbon price, 
but not a good primary policy to drive down greenhouse emissions. The bottom 
line is that if we are to meet our 2030 target, the ERF is not going to cut it. 
 * Fossil fuel use will continue to decline. It won‚Äôt stop; even with their 
accelerating rollout of renewables, India and China are still building 
coal-fired power stations. But as renewables get cheaper and countries actively 
shift away from fossil fuels, any government backing for the infrastructure 
needed by big new coal mines appears increasingly misguided. 
 * The smart investment will be in clean technologies, and if Turnbull wants 
to be active and nimble and innovative and get a slice of it, he needs a 
credible, clear, transparent domestic climate policy, and quickly. That‚Äôs 
exactly what Jie Zhang, from Chinese firm Hareon Solar,told me he is looking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/05/chinese-solar-firm-says-policy-instability-holding-back-australian-investment>
 for when deciding whether to make a billion dollar investment in Australia 
next year. 
 * We won‚Äôt get away with using accounting rules to reach our 
emission-reduction pledges for much longer. Five big developed countries
announced in Paris that they had voluntarily cancelled emission reduction 
‚Äúcredits‚Äù 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/05/australia-climate-talks-developed-nations-cancel-carryover-emissions-reduction-credits-kyoto>
 achieved by overshooting their first Kyoto protocol greenhouse targets ‚Äìthe 
same kind of credits Australia is banking to boast it has already ‚Äúmet and 
beaten‚Äù its international pledges. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/27/welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-climate-talks-where-less-means-more>
 The Paris agreement ‚Äúencourages parties to promote the voluntary cancellation 
‚Ä¶ of units issued under the Kyoto protocol, including certified emissions 
reductions that are valid for the second commitment period‚Äù. Australia says it 
is going to ignore that encouragement, but the fact that this statement is in 
the deal indicates that we are unlikely to get to pull the same swifty in the 
future. 
 * We are also going to be under pressure to stump up more money to help 
vulnerable countries cope with the impacts of climate change. The government 
fudged this in Paris, saying it would provide at least $200m a year ‚Äì which 
appears to be a figure arrived at by adding up what we are already providing. 
Canada, by contrast, promised $2.5bn. Julie Bishop (@JulieBishopMP)

The Paris agreement should mean Australia stops pretending that climate policy 
is something that can be papered over, or worked around, or ignored, or used as 
a political attack weapon. It should mean we finally understand that a clear, 
long-term policy for moving away from fossil fuels is not a threat, but an 
opportunity.
