Police and State Emergency Service workers searched the flood-ravaged area 
into the night without success, before finding the man’s body inside his 
vehicle early on Monday morning.

Police divers retrieved the man’s body about 11.30am on Monday and efforts 
were under way to winch his ute from Rileys creek.

In a separate incident near Bowral, in the state’s Southern Highlands, 
emergency services descended on Mittagong creek on Sunday evening after a car 
was spotted in floodwaters with its hazard lights flashing.

A fruitless search on Sunday evening ended in tragedy on Monday morning, when 
the body of a 65-year-old man was discovered inside his vehicle. The man was 
not immediately formally identified.

A 37-year-old Canberra man died after his car was caught in flood waters near 
the Cotter dam.

Police found the 37-year-old from Kambah about 4.30pm on Sunday but were 
unable to retrieve the body until Monday morning.

Police spotted the man’s vehicle after they were called out to a separate 
incident involving two men who had been four-wheel driving and realised they 
couldn’t cross the swollen river.

While emergency workers were trying to work out how to rescue the man, his 
four-wheel drive was swept away by the flood waters and flipped over.

The man’s body was spotted later on an island in the middle of the river.

Huge swells and strong winds batter the New South Wales coastline in Australia, 
causing flooding and dangerous conditions in Sydney and the surrounding areas.

“The flood waters yesterday ... were extremely strong, savage, with a lot of 
debris, large logs coming down the river,” ACT police sergeant Harry Hains told 
reporters in Canberra. “The force was enough to flip a two-tonne ute.”

Police and emergency workers again warned people not to drive through flood 
waters for any reason.

“These types of weather conditions, extreme weather conditions we’ve 
experienced, do lead adventure-seeking type people to seek mud with their 
four-wheel-drives,” Hains said.

“There is no risk worth taking to cross a flooded river to go and seek some 
piece of dirt to drive your four-wheel drive on.”

Tasmanian police held grave concerns for two elderly people missing as heavy 
rain drenched the island state.

Search and rescue specialists were searching in Ouse on Monday after reports 
that a man in his 80s may have been swept away by flood waters.

Another elderly man was rescued from his Latrobe home earlier on Monday 
morning by helicopter as water inundated his home, but his wife was missing.

More than a dozen people in Latrobe and its surrounds were evacuated by boat, 
including a family of three rescued from the roof of their car.

Significant livestock losses were reported at dairy farms along the Mersey 
river.

The Latrobe mayor, Peter Freshney, said the army had been called in to help 
with the “unique” flooding conditions.

“Even since the 1970 floods, there’s been so many changes to the topography 
and the like that we really don’t know what we’re facing,” he said. “We’re 
doing everything we can and all the resources are being thrown at it that we 
can muster.”

All Tasmanian river basins were on flood watch after parts of the state were 
drenched with more than 200mm of rain.

A Bureau of Meteorology forecaster, Anna Forrest, said the heavy rains would 
not ease until Tuesday and wet weather was forecast for the rest of the week.

The Emu river and North Esk river had burst their banks and others were at 
risk of overflowing. Major flood warnings were in place for the Forth, Meander, 
Mersey, North Esk, South Esk and Macquarie rivers and a minor flood warning for 
the Derwent.

The Meander river was expected to peak at between 3.4m and 3.7m at Deloraine 
by Monday afternoon.

The SES rescued several people in the state’s north and north-west overnight, 
after they became stranded trying to drive through flood waters amid lashing 
rain.
