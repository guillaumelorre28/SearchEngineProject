Tim Martin, founder and non-executive chairman of the JD Wetherspoon pub 
chain, recalls that when he bought his first outlet back in 1979, a pint of 
Adnams bitter cost a princely 48p. At the risk of sounding fogeyish, times have 
changed – the price of an average pint in Britain hit £3 in the new year.

According to the British Beer <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/beer> 
and Pub Association, the typical cost of an on-trade beer has jumped by a pound 
since 2001. That's an average annual increase of 4.2% – well above the rate of 
inflation.

The steady upward march is partly down to duty, which has risen from 28p to 
41p in a decade. This week's hike in VAT to 20% didn't help. Neither have 
tighter regulations. Alarmed by binge drinking, local authorities are requiring 
more pubs to employ bouncers and are coming down more heavily on licensees 
caught serving underage drinkers. Expectations have risen, too: customers want 
decent food, stylish surroundings, clean toilets and family-friendly 
environments.

Pubs <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/pubs> are closing at a rate of 
29 per week, and, as licensees scramble to make a living, the gap between the 
price of beer in supermarkets and pubs has widened. And it doesn't help that a 
large proportion of the nation's licensed premises are owned by vast, highly 
leveraged pub corporations which are essentially property firms intent on 
squeezing every possible drop of rent out of their leaseholders.

At the current rate of beer inflation, a pint will cost £4 by 2018. We risk 
turning into a nation of stay-at-home drinkers slurping lager in front of the 
television.
