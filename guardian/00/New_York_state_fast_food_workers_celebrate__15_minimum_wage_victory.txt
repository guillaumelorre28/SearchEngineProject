After more than a year of organized action, fast food workers in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> are about to get what they have 
been demanding: a $15 minimum wage.

The Fast Food Wage Board appointed by New York governor Andrew Cuomo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo> announced on Wednesday that 
they are recommending a new $15 an hour minimum wage for fast food workers 
employed by chains with 30 or more stores nationwide.

Those working in New York City will see their wages increase to $15 an hour by 
December 2018, whereas those working in the rest of the state will see their 
wages increase at a slower pace and will reach $15 by July 2021.

New York will lead the way in fighting economic inequality, Cuomo said after 
the wage board announced its recommendations. “It is an injustice when you have 
a growing income inequality, [when] fewer and fewer Americans are becoming 
richer and richer and more Americans working harder and harder and getting left 
behind,” he said. “It is an injustice when working families in this country 
have gone backwards over the past 10 years when you add in inflation. It is a 
shame that in this nation with all our progress, one in five children live 
poverty. That is a shame.”

Cuomo also predicted that this will set a nationwide trend. 

“When New York acts, the rest of the states follow. That is the New York way,” 
he said.

“This is a historical moment. We did it,” Jorel Ware, a McDonald’s worker, 
said at the rally celebrating the wage board’s recommendations. Wearing a 
T-shirt emblazoned with both “I can’t breathe” and “Fight for $15”, he said 
fewer people would live in poverty thanks to the wage increase.

“It’s wonderful. I get to live on my own again. I am telling you it’s a 
wonderful thing. When I started the fight, I just wanted something better for 
myself,” he said. “The Fight for $15 has showed me what’s possible when people 
stick and work together.”

According to Byron Brown, mayor of Buffalo and chairman of the wage board, the 
board heard in-person testimonies and received over 2,000 additional written 
testimonies prior to making its decision.

“It’s not just good for the workers in the room, but it’s good for the 
economy. It’s good for the state and it’s good for America,” said Mike Fishman, 
secretary-treasurer of the SEIU and member of the wage board. He said that the 
fast food industry has not kept up with other industries and is currently being 
subsidized by billions of tax dollars.

“[These subsidies are] something that became clear to us, the people who 
talked to us,” he said, adding that when the wages are raised, those tax 
dollars can go to other programs. “When industry will not correct itself, the 
governor has to step in.”

Fast food workers in New York City will get their first pay hike this 
December, to $10.50, which will be followed by a $1.50 increase in December of 
2016, 2017 and 2018. In the rest of the state, the wage of fast food workers 
will go up to $9.75 in December of this year, and then increase by a $1 each 
year up to December 2019. In December 2020, it will increase by 75 cents and by 
50 cents in July 2021, when it will finally reach $15 an hour.

The reason for the faster increase in wages in New York City is that chains in 
the city benefit from the influx of tourists and the business they bring 
year-round.

According to the board, the incremental increases represent compromise between 
both workers and employers.

“On one hand, we would all like everyone to make more money,” said Kevin Ryan, 
chairman and founder of Gilt and a wage board member. “On the other hand, we 
also know that our businesses have to be successful. If our business are not 
successful, then there won’t be new jobs for anyone. We wanted to balance that.”

As Cuomo pointed out when he announced the appointment of the board, these 
recommendations “do not require legislative approval”.

There will now be a 15-day comment period, after which the New York labor 
commissioner can adjust the recommendations before he submits them to become a 
law.

“The labor commissioner will review the work of the wage board, but I think 
there is no doubt that we are headed in the right direction,” said Cuomo.
