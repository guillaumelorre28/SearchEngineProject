This year’s Brit awards nominations have thrown up a few unexpected 
curveballs. Alongside the expected stack of nominations for Adele, who features 
in four categories, there is also recognition forAmy Winehouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse> – who died in 2011 – and 
Eagles of Death Metal, whose Paris concert was targeted by terrorists in 
November 2015.

The Brits open a new chapter in making British pop look moribund

Winehouse’s inclusion in the British female solo artist category is not her 
first posthumous nomination. She was nominated in the same section in 2013, 
following the release of her rarities album Lioness: Hidden Treasures. This 
year’s nomination comes after the release of the documentary film Amy, with its 
accompanying soundtrack, and sees Winehouse in a group that also features Adele,
Florence + the Machine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/florence-and-the-machine>, Jess Glynne and 
Laura Marling.


Eagles of Death Metal are among the nominees for international group, which 
seems likely to be recognition for the dignified way they responded to fans 
following the attack at the Bataclan concert hall, which left 89 people dead. 
The band’s lead singer Jesse Hughes spoke movingly following the tragedy about 
wanting to connect with his fans, and remained defiant that the terrorists 
would not prevent the group from continuing to perform live. The band have 
never previously been nominated for either a Brit or a Grammy, and their most 
recent album, Zipper Down, reached only No 32 in the UK charts.

The group’s singer, Jesse Hughes, said: “You know how you always hear people 
say that it’s nice to just be nominated? Well, in this particular case, it 
honestly is. We are truly humbled by the outpouring of support Eagles of Death 
Metal has received from all of the people of Europe, and we pledge to continue 
rocking and rolling for many many more years to come. Thank you so much for 
recognising and bestowing us with such a wonderful honour.”

Elsewhere in their category are U2, who invited Eagles of Death Metal to 
perform with them onstage in Paris less than a month after the Bataclan attack,
Alabama Shakes <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alabama-shakes>, Major Lazer 
and Tame Impala.

There is no surprise that Adele <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele> 
jointly leads the nominations list. With gigantic sales of her comeback album 
25 – it has sold more than 2.5m copies so far in the UK alone – she will be 
tipped to win all four of her categories: British female solo artist, 
Mastercard British album of the year, British single and British artist video 
of the year, the latter two for her comeback song Hello.

The new artists Years and Years and James Bay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/james-bay> – who won the BBC sound of 2015 
and Brits critics’ choice awards last year, respectively – both match her for 
nominations. The electropop band feature in the categories for British group 
and British breakthrough act, and also British single and British artist video 
of the year for their song King. Singer songwriter Bay gets the nod for British 
male solo artist, British breakthrough act, Mastercard British album of the 
year and British single.


Elsewhere on the list are nominations for electronic maverick Aphex Twin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aphex-twin> (British male solo artist), 
dance-popster Jess Glynne (British female solo artist, British breakthrough act 
and British single for Hold My Hand) and Coldplay, who feature in British group 
and Mastercard British album of the year for A Head Full Of Dreams.


The international categories hold more weight in terms of credibility. Father 
John Misty <https://www.theguardian.com/music/father-john-misty> and Kendrick 
Lamar are up for international male solo artist, while Björk and Courtney 
Barnett are among those competing for international female solo artist.


The Brits ceremony will be held on Wednesday 24 February at the O2, with Ant 
and Dec hosting. There will be live performances from Adele, Coldplay,Justin 
Bieber <https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber>, Jess Glynne, James 
Bay, the Weeknd and Little Mix.
