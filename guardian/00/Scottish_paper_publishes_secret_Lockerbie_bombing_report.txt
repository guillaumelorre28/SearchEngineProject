Scotland's Sunday Herald has published a report that was kept secret for 
years, which could have cleared the convicted Lockerbie bomber,Abdelbaset 
al-Megrahi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdelbaset-al-megrahi>.

The Herald <https://www.theguardian.com/media/herald> gave two reasons for 
publishing the full 821-page report, by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review 
Commission, on its website.

First, it had obtained al-Megrahi's permission. Second, it believed publication
was in the public interest.

Though the Crown Office regards the publication of the document as 
unauthorised, there were prior indications from senior law officers that the 
paper would not be prosecuted for doing so.

The Herald would doubtless point out that there is a public interest defence 
for breaches of the Data Protection Act.

It also ensured the protection of confidential sources and private information 
by making a number of redactions.

The paper's decision was welcomed by Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond>, who had previously called 
for the grounds for al-Megrahi's appeal to be published.

al-Megrahi, a Libyan, was convicted for the 1988 bombing - in which 270 people 
died <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103> - and jailed for murder 
in 2001.

He lost his first appeal and dropped a second shortly before he was released 
in August 2009 on compassionate grounds.

He was then expected to die from cancer within three months but is still alive.
