 A brief history of CUEC, Mexico City’s prestigious film school 
It’s a heady time for Mexico’s film-makers internationally, one perhaps not 
seen since the country’sgolden age of cinema 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Mexican_cinema> in the 1940s and 
50s. Fifteen-odd years since Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárritu 
broke out with, respectively,Y Tu Mamá También 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/12/1> and Amores Perros 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/18/1>, the two men have won 
consecutive Oscars for best director: Cuarón for Gravity and Iñárritu for
Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/birdman-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-film-review>
. Their cinematographer, Emmanuel “Chivo” Lubezki (also from Y Tu Mamá), nabbed 
the award for both. MeanwhileGuillermo del Toro

 has grown into an A-list Hollywood director, and Gael García Bernal, who shot 
to stardom in those early films, has forged an impressive international career 
not just in acting but directing and, through his company Canana, production.

Cuarón and Lubezki have another thing in common, too: they both went to the 
prestigious CUEC film school. So we knew that by challenging CUEC’s first-year 
class to make us a series of three-minute films aboutMexico

something interesting.

Licence to shoot: the Spectre location manager's guide to Mexico City

Last week, the students screened the results for us at their new facilities on 
the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico 
City’s southern suburbs. Below we present some of the best work – insights into 
Mexico City that we found to be entirely unexpected, moving and funny.

But when asked about the state of Mexican film, the students quickly revealed 
they had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent 
Mexican films, even in Mexico City. New subsidies that allow companies to write 
off investments in film have helped increase the total number of Mexican films 
being made, saysStacy Perskie, the production manager in Mexico City for the 
new Bond film Spectre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/09/licence-to-shoot-spectre-location-manager-guide-to-mexico-city>
. “It is helpful for developing a skill-set. Now instead of having 10 films a 
year of which maybe one is good, we have 70 a year of which maybe 10 are good.” 
Nevertheless, the CUEC students told us, distribution remains a huge hurdle: 
independent cinemas are getting put out of business by huge chains that show 
mainly Hollywood blockbusters, and what few indie Mexican films manage to 
squeeze into the programming schedules barely get two or three days on screen. 
As the saying goes, one wit pointed out: “So far from God, so close to the 
United States.”

At any rate, here are the students’ three-minute films. I say again: these are 
first-year students, in fact first-semester students. With talent like this, 
it’s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by 
their Oscar haul are numbered.

(All films are in Spanish with English subtitles.)

Lights Out
 Lights Out. By Arturo Campos Nieto, Juliette Clenet, Samantha Mendez Badillo, 
Toberto Telles Alcantara, Antonio Torres Gastelum and Rodolfo Vilchis Conde 
Lights Out tells the story of two vendors at a metro station, who have a 
unique worldview ... for a surprising reason. “We wanted to show the details in 
the city that often get overlooked,” Arturo Nieto told us. Are the man and 
woman a couple? “We think there’s definitely something going on.”

El Ritmo de la Ciudad (The Rhythm of the City)
 The Rhythm of the City. By Andrea Perez Su, Bernardo Chavez Castellanos, 
Octavio Rivera Ramirez and Ruben Servin Victoria 
Instead of a typical narrative, The Rhythm of the City takes its story from 
the changing sounds of the course of a single Mexico City day – from rush hour 
morning to nightclubs after dark. “We had to film in the club with a secret 
camera,” the film-makers explained.

24 Boleros Pasajeros (Fleeting Boleros)
 Fleeting Boleros. By Diego Ruiz. Cinematography: Morus Gonzalez. Sound 
design: Jose Juan Sanchez. Producer: Mauricio Sanchez. Camera Assistant: Jorge 
Franco. Sound assistant: Frederic Moreau 
Fleeting Boleros is an attempt by director Diego Ruiz to get under the skin of 
a different way of being in Mexico City: living poor but with dignity as part 
of a musical troupe that has existed for several generations. The Argueta 
family of boleros (Jorge, Kevin and Armando Argueta), who play under the name 
Soul of the Angel, came to the CUEC screening in full costume. Patriarch 
Armando told us that the presence of his daughter – who has since left the band 
– helped attract goodwill. Luckily, he said, he has many infant granddaughters 
...

Selenium Blanche Neige
 Selenium Blanche Neige. By Ximena Montiel, Monica Burciaga, Diego Granadillo, 
Angel Segovia and Judith Gutierrez. 
Many of the students told us they’d set out to make a different film, but soon 
found themselves captured by a story they found along the way. So it was with 
Selenium Blanche Neige, a hilarious look inside the life of transvestite 
hot-dog vendors in the Zona Rosa neighbourhood.

 Cronica de una Marcha. Dir: Juliette Clenet 
Juliette Clenet’s camera came in handy when she found herself in the middle of 
a protest over the 43 students who vanished near Ayotzinapa. Once again, events 
dictated the film’s subject – she’d originally set out to make a different 
movie entirely – but it was Juliette’s idea to pair the footage with a poem by 
Alejandro Perla, which gives the film its power. That, of course, and the 
swimming man ...
