Johnston Press <https://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press> has acquired 
a weekly free newspaper in Brighton, the Brighton & Hove Independent.


The paper, which boasts a weekly circulation of 13,005 copies, was launched in 
2011 into a newsprint vacuum.*

There had not been a city-wide weekly for several years since the demise of 
the Brighton Gazette, the partner paper to the daily Brighton Argus, published 
by Newsquest/Gannett.


The Independent’s founder and managing director, Mark Ansell, set up a network 
of more than 300 distribution points across the city. He also shrewdly hired 
the former Sunday Times journalist Greg Hadfield as editorial director. It was 
he who ensured that the paper looked good and read well. It also has a related 
website <http://brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/>. 

No wonder Johnston Press’s chief executive, Ashley Highfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield>, says: “It’s a great title 
with a superb reputation with both readers and advertisers.

“It’s a small but terrific team - who produce an excellent newspaper and 
website - and we’re very happy to have them on board.” There will be no staff 
changes.


Ansell and Hadfield are happy about the deal too. “It’s a landmark day for 
us,” said Ansell. “We started Brighton & Hove Independent with an ambition to 
change the media landscape, to do things differently.

“Being part of Johnston Press will allow Brighton & Hove Independent to 
fast-track growth, to provide even more comprehensive coverage for the city, 
and to go from strength to strength.”

Hadfield agreed. “This is a big step forward... It means we will be in a much 
stronger position to deliver a newspaper that our city truly deserves.”

The terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Johnston Press owns 13 paid-for 
daily newspapers, 195 paid-for weekly newspapers and 40 free titles.

*ABC verified distribution August–December 2014
