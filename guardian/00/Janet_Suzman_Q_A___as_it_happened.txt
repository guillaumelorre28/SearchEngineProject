I thoroughly enjoyed the production of Hamlet you directed in 2005. The way 
John Kani played Claudius reminded me very strongly of Thabo Mbeki and his 
technocrat clique that was probably at the peak of their power at the time. Was 
this depiction conscious? Or did I imagine it all?

Thank you for that! That Hamlet is another favourite of mine. I love it that 
you picked up John Kani's stab at Mbeki – it wasn't particularly conscious on 
our part but one would hope that a livewire would pick it up. Just as when I 
did Othello, I didn't want Richard Haines' Iago to be a carbon copy of Eugène 
Terre'Blanche but for people just to pick up the reference.

Hi Janet! I read your piece in Index on Censorship, and I found it really 
interesting how you described the bargaining that went on between the theatre 
and the government censors, "whether the Market CEO Mannie Manim would 'forgo 
the "c-word" on page five in order to retain the "f-word" on page seven'". I 
was wondering how actors would have been affected by this process? As an actor, 
would you have felt pressured to change your performance at all?

I'm glad you read that piece. The answer to your last question: I don't think 
actors are ever tempted to accommodate. The actors at the MarketTheatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> took great pleasure in playing 
against the grain during those years when the censor held sway. I still find it 
extraordinary that an authoritarian government did not prosecute the really 
important plays of the time like Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island and 
Asinamali etc.

Dear Dame Janet,

Actresses have played a number of Shakespearean men - Hamlet, Richard III, 
King Lear, Julius Caesar (and Brutus and Mark Antony in Phyllida Lloyd's 
all-female production). Is that something you'd like to do - and if so, who 
would you play?
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13422241> Guardian contributor
JanetSuzman1  <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13422241> 17 June 
2014 2:12pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37070121> 
To be honest I'm less interested in the idea of actresses playing 
Shakespearean male roles than the possibility of male actors having played the 
women's roles. The mature women's roles. I spent some time in a series of 
essays I wrote in a book called Not Hamlet about the frail position of women in 
drama. I've hinted at this before – that people are not interested in the 
interiority of female dramatic characters – so there are no Hamlets. Hence the 
title.

I am quite cross with male scholars who think it a given that boys played all 
Shakespeare's women including that unique creature, Cleopatra. She's probably 
the most complex of the poet's creations and I think it's daft to gloss that 
famous line: "I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the 
posture of a whore". You will see that boy is used as a verb. That means to 
belittle or to diminish. So obviously the poet is saying that if you want to 
diminish a great women get a boy to play her.

But to get back to your question I'm not sure that apart from the sheer joy of 
attempting to be a Hamlet or a Lear, any female actor would be able to cast an 
especially glowing illumination into either of these parts.

Core. It's a very good question. If I thought there was a whole roster of 
great plays out there which has not been touched for yonks I would find dozens 
of actors male and female who could find some original slant. But truly, 
without going through the agony of trying to fill theatre with unknown names 
you would need to be a maniac to seduce people to pay £60 for a seat when they 
didn't know what they were getting. The public don't care to take too many 
chances.

No idea. London is the best place to be. Because it's a country. It's got a 
boistrousness and a feeling of endless invention that only a great unplanned, 
unregulated, organism can engender. You create a hub somewhere else you have to 
have surroundings. And then it has to planned and then it's self-defeating.

Would that there were. I would give my blood to find such a part. All of us

Dear Janet,

I read an essay you wrote on Hedda Gabler which helped me through my 
first-year exam, so thank you for that! It's probably an impossible question to 
answer in a line or two, but what do you think it is about Hedda that makes her 
so continuously a great role for an actress, a sort of 'female Hamlet', as she 
has been called?

2014 1:51pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37069009> 
Well, look, I don't think it's a female Hamlet. But I know what you mean. It's 
one of the few parts written for women that has a subtext the size of 
Antarctica. Hamlet has no subtext, just a vast landscape of expressed thoughts. 
The inside of a woman's brain is still not considered the stuff of drama. In 
other words a woman philosophising is a bit like Jonson's dog on its hindlegs. 
But Hedda takes up every moment of those four tightly knit acts of Ibsen's 
play. And it's up to the actress to express a world of secrecy which is only 
indicated by text. So that's a challenge. And we like a challenge. Not all that 
many people can give the impression of having much more to say than they have 
bothered to express.

Fantastic actor!

Did Peter Greenaway explain his script to you prior to, or during, filming, or

Peter Greenaway took an evil delight in not explaining his script which I 
rather admired as the ingenuity of the actors was very much relied on. That 
said, his attention to visual detail was thrilling to watch unfold. As to what 
the film was actually about, you might as well ask Hampton Court maze what it's 
about.

One thing I will say is that when it was shown at the Venice Film Festival

Yes. Solomon and Marion is coming to Birmingham and then to the new Print Room 
in London in the autumn and I think it's a perfectly wonderful play. Human 
size. Just two people, me and a young man from Khayalitsha. It was his first 
performance on the professional stage and that young man has real talent – name 
of Khayalethu Anthony. The play had its genesis in the murder of Brett Goldin 
in 2006. He was playing Guildenstern is my production of Hamlet which has been 
invited to Stratford for the RSC's complete works festival. But he never made 
it. He was murdered on Easter Saturday night in Cape Town. This play grew out 
of that horrible event and it's the story of two unlikely people finding they 
could hardly live without each other. Life is all accident.

Two questions if I may:

You graced the RSC for many years. Do you think you'll ever be a part of a big 
company again (I'm thinking of the National Theatre)?

You were at the RSC when it was at its brilliant best. Trevor Nunn and John 
Barton were directing (it's a pity the latter isn't doing this anymore) and 
doing their best work. Will these heights ever be reached again, or is this a 
stupid question because of the nature of theatre now?

2014 1:38pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37068318> 
Strange you should ask that. I'm one of a small minority of actors who have 
never trod the boards of the National Theatre – I almost can't believe it 
myself. And anyway, the National is not really a company. A company is formed 
for each separate production. Whereas the old RSC really did try to be a 
company by having three year contracts for all its actors. Peter Hall was 
determined to forge an ensemble a la Comédie-Française or the Moscow Arts. It 
doesn't sit happily with English actors, alas.

And you're right to say that the RSC was at its brilliant best in those days 
with Peter and John Barton and later Trevor Nunn, reaching for those heights. 
It's rare to find our big productions without a big star name heading it 
nowadays. But that doesn't mean that the big star productions always work in 
favour of the play.

There's no doubt in my mind that every single one of the Shakespeare plays we 
did in those days had their wattage upped by being cast so well.

Funny, somebody suggested I should play Helen just the other day. But I don't 
think enough time has passed to assess her properly yet. A lot of white 
participation in the destruction of apartheid has been written out of the 
general canvas. A certain historical revisionism has been going on but that 
will change as distance lends a clearer vision to the unfolding of events. In 
any case, I'm not the right size or shape for Hellie.

Do you have any particular memories of your time playing Hilda Lessways in 
Clayhanger? I believe you were about 32/33 when you played the part -was it a 
challenge portraying the character in the earlier episodes when she is supposed 
to be in her late teens? Having seen you in numerous films and series, I 
noticed as Hilda a slight modulation in your voice/tone, was this in order to 
give the impression of a younger character? I'm also curious to know if you had 
any particular memories of Nicholas & Alexandra and Day in the Death of Joe Egg 
-your performances in both were exceptional. Do you have a particular favourite 
film or TV role you've played, outside of Shakespeare?

Raise the flags! If I tell you that Hilda Lessways in Clayhanger is one of my 
best memories, and you might be surprised, but it is! I thought Clayhanger was 
a magnificent maxi series. 26 episodes! The nearest thing to a novel being read 
out loud every Tuesday. And yes I loved Hilda because she was a contrary little 
beast beautifully observed by Arnold Bennett. As to your question about the 
slight modulation in my voice, I confess I don't actually remember but I 
suppose instinctively if I had to age from pretty young to much older, I need 
to be younger at the beginning. Hence a lighter modulation.

Well I've answered the TV one. The film one. My best film experience was 
definitely spending a whole week with that genius Federico Fellini when he made 
The Boat Sails On. I was there filming the inserts into the main film for a 
week before they actually started and so I had that man to myself. The guy's a 
genius. The traffic would stop for him in Rome. And every night we went to the 
same restaurant with the best food ever!! La padrona – or the cook – turned out 
to be a very old friend of his from his youth in Bologna and I've never eaten 
better. A lot of people don't know that Fellini was also a foodie.

Good afternoon, Janet.

I'm sure this is becoming a tired question, but how did it feel to direct Kim 
Cattrall <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kim-cattrall> as Cleopatra, a 
part you had played so iconically?

I watched a lecture of yours on YouTube and could only admire your eloquence. 
I know Kim is very eloquent too, and I'd like to know how your relationship 
developed from 'Whose Life Is It Anyway?' to now. I know you were a hero of 
hers long before.

Well, thank you for the last comment. Kim Cattrall is a great gal. She had the 
modesty and the courage – not having had any classical training – to want to 
try to catch the big one i.e. Cleopatra, and she landed it magnificently. We 
loved working together. I can't be absolutely sure that she always agreed with 
me but she had the grace to have a go when I suggested this or that in relation 
to Cleo. She is a person, and this probably sounds a bit poe-faced but bugger 
that, of the utmost integrity. And that shows in her work. Integrity always 
does.

Well Athol is one of the few playwright who really love women. And I guess 
they are wounded and they are lost but all his characters have a spine of 
stoicism and lack of self pity which I find very moving. There are some really 
talented female directors in SA, chief amongst them being Lara Foot and Yaël 
Farber.

I saw Yaël's Nirbhaya and it was remarkable for broaching a subject which is 
at the forefront of people's mind what with Angelina Jolie fronting Unesco's 
war rape initiative and the ever present spectre of rape, horribly at the 
forefront of most countries. Lara Foot's play was called Tshepang! And that 
dealt with baby rape of which there's nothing more horrible.

Greetings from Cape Town, Janet.

Which of the plays you have been in do you think casts most light on the South

In its day the Othello I directed at the Market Theatre – thereby breaking the 
British Equity boycott –  unexpectedly dipped into the then South African 
experience in a really crucial way because, in the highest possible poetry 
written by any human being, the complete humiliation of a black man was 
dramatised. And so it's unexpected to find Shakespeare hit the spot. But he did 
then. He and he always can.

But back to the present, I think that Solomon and Marion, which I did at the 
Baxter Theatre Studio, and which London will see in October / November at the 
new Print Room, very much enters the present South African experience. And by 
that I mean crossing chasms between the races, the genders and the ages. A 
young black man and an old white woman find common ground.

fascination with this land that I was born into,” she has said. “It has some of 
the best and the worst people in the whole world inhabiting its boundaries.”


Joining the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1960s, she played Joan of Arc and 
the great Shakespearean heroines – Portia, Ophelia, Kate – although,as she 
recently wrote for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/24/janet-suzman-paul-scofield-genius-rehearsal-shakespeare>
, she “would have played a grain of sand just to be in the same room as Paul 
Scofield”.


In 1973, Suzman triumphed in Antony and Cleopatra, which was directed by 
Trevor Nunn. She considers the Egyptian ruler to be “chiefest” among 
Shakespeare’s creations – and directed Kim Cattrall in the role in 2010.In her 
book Not Hamlet <http://oberonbooks.com/not-hamlet>, Suzman explored the Bard’s 
female characters – and took aim at the conspiracy theories around the great 
playwright.


Her TV and film career includes the series Clayhanger, Nicholas and Alexandra 
(which brought her an Oscar nomination), The Draughtsman’s Contract and 
everything from Fellini to Leon the Pig Farmer.
