We’ve had a pig/hippo named after Mick Jagger

, a spider named after Angelina Jolie, and a lemur named after John Cleese. And 
the trend for scientists shamelessly drawing on pop culture to name newly 
discovered species continues, with an ancient flying dinosaur named after James 
Cameron’s space opera Avatar.

The team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing named the new variant 
of pterosaurIkrandraco avatar, thanks to its resemblence to the dinosaur-like 
creatures in the movie. The naming came after fossils were discovered of the 
creature in China’s Liaoning province, which showed it had a crest on its lower 
jaw just like Avatar’s winged reptiles.

The news was announced in a flurry of paleontology jokes: “Of course, nobody 
and nothing can ride this pterosaur,”said the institute’s Xiaolin Wang

, while fellow scientist Alexander Kellner confirmed there were “no blue 
hominids during the Cretaceous”.

Cameron is currently preparing sequels to Avatar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/avatar>, which is the highest-grossing film 
of all time. Three more instalments are to come between 2016 and 2018, with 
Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana all returning.

The director is “in seclusion” writing the movies according to visual-effects 
pioneer Douglas Trumbull

, who has developed a 4K 3D projection system that could potentially be used to 
shoot and display the Avatar sequels.
