Daring to defend another woman, Azza Hilal Ahmad Suleiman paid the price.

When, during last year's Tahrir Square protests, human rights activist Azza 
Hilal Ahmad Suleiman tried to rescue a woman being stripped and beaten by 
soldiers, the last thing she expected to happen was to be attacked by the 
soldiers herself. Azza's intervention led to her receiving a brutal beating, 
resulting in a fractured skull and other serious injuries. Azza, 49, was lucky 
to survive, and lodged a formal complaint with the Egyptian authorities.

The incident was particularly shocking to Azza because she was brought up in 
an environment that respected the army â€“ her father was a general, along with 
two of her brothers and two of her uncles. Her brother was also shocked by the 
soldiers' actions: "We come from a family of officers and, yes, the army was 
once a source of pride for us," he said. "I am so thankful my father died 
before seeing my sister in this condition."

Despite her injuries, Suleiman does not regret her decision to intervene to 
help the woman being stripped and beaten.

"The day I helped this veiled girl I never thought of what they would do to 
me. All I thought was that another human being needed help. I ran to her and 
asked the officers 'Why this violence?'"

Despite Azza's formal complaint, no one has been held accountable for her 
beating and injuries.

Through its Write for Rights
