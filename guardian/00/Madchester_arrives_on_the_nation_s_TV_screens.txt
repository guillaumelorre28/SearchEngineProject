The 80s looked destined to end in musical ignominy. The charts were dominated 
by the steely machinations of Stock, Aitken and Waterman and Jive Bunny's 
repeated attempts to sample the heart out of classic rock'n'roll. Salvation 
seemed unlikely â€“ until, as a popular T-shirt of the time put it, God created 
Manchester. Actually, it was the north's golden pop past colliding with the 
dance revolution that gave us the Stone Roses andHappy Mondays 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/happy-mondays>. By November 1989, both were 
local heroes, but it took an edition of Top of the Pops to turn them into a 
national obsession.

Entering the charts at No 13 with Fool's Gold, the Stone Roses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/stone-roses> were a vision of beauty, their 
image as otherworldly as their music was gloriously new. But it was Ian Brown's 
mic-waggling, swaggering cool that proved the real revelation. By contrast, 
Shaun Ryder looked like someone who'd threaten to kill Kylie if he and his 
mates weren't allowed their three minutes of fame. But Hallelujah, nestling at 
No 30, bristled with feral funk and an enticing menace that simply sounded like 
the most exciting thing on earth. Seeing these bands made indie fans feel they 
had finally won the battle.
