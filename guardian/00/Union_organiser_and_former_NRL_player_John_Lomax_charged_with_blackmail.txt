Construction union organiser and former Canberra Raiders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/canberra-raiders> player John Lomax has been 
charged with blackmail.

Lomax, 49, of Harrison, was arrested on Friday morning by the police task 
force attached to the royal commission into trade union corruption.

ACT police said his arrest was “in relation to the Canberra hearings” of the 
royal commission.

Lomax has been charged with one count of blackmail. He was granted watch-house 
bail and will face the ACT magistrates court on 5 August.

Lomax is the third person to have been arrested by the police task force 
attached to the commission, and the second to be arrested in relation to the 
hearings in Canberra.

Halafihi “Fihi” Kivalu, a former Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy 
Union (CFMEU) organiser, was arrested last week and has pleaded not guilty to 
two charges of blackmail.

Lomax was due to give evidence before the royal commission next week but it is 
now unclear whether he will attend.
