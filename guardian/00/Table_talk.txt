What was your most memorable meal? 
In the year running up to the millennium we spent Christmas in Italy and 
fourteen of us had Christmas lunch at a little local place. We started with a 
large selection of charcuterie and then had tortelli, roast pork and veal. It's 
memorable because of the great family atmosphere – you had the Italian mamma in 
her kitchen – and how cheap it was.

What was your biggest food disaster? 
I screwed everything up one morning at the Aubergine. I curdled the custard, 
got sweet pastry everywhere and managed to turn off the freezer so that all the 
ice cream and sorbet in it melted. I got into a lot of trouble!

What's the worst meal you've ever had? 
We went to a nondescript place in Clapham where the service was an absolute 
joke. The whole place was empty and when we went in and asked if they had a 
table they looked round the empty restaurant and said 'I'll just have to 
check'. Once we had ordered it took them 40 minutes to prepare a caesar salad.

What's the most outlandish thing you've ever eaten? 
An Italian cheese with worms going through it. It's a really nice strong blue 
cheese.

Who's your food hero/food villain? 
My hero is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. My villain is Tesco's supermarket.

Nigella or Delia? 
Delia

Vegetarians: genius or madness? 
Genius

Muesli or fry-up? 
Fry-up every time

Starter or pudding? 
Starter

Fast food or fresh food? 
Fresh food

Fusion food or best of British? 
Best of British of course

What's the best/worst thing about the British food scene? 
The best? Hmmmm. The worst is that we think we're now a nation of foodies and 
we're not. Oh, and I think it's really bad that good food costs so much and bad 
food is so cheap. That's wrong.

What's the next big thing? 
Murano by Angela Hartnett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/angelahartnett> – opening in August 
2008

What would you do if you weren't a chef? 
I think I'd be in the army or the Royal Marines or maybe a policewoman. The 
discipline of that kind of field appeals to me.

Make a wish
That I could appear in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I should have said 
world peace shouldn't I?

 Angela Hartnett is owner of the new flagship Italian restaurant Murano at 21 
Queen Street, Mayfair, opening on 21 August
