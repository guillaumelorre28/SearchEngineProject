The British singing superstar Adele <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele> 
will tour Australia for the first time next year.

The Grammy award winner announced that the 360-degree, in-the-round stadium 
concerts will start in Perth on 28 February.

Adele also released her new single, Water Under the Bridge, to coincide with 
Tuesday’s announcement.

“G’Day it’s me … I was wondering if after 10 years in the game you’d finally 
like to meet me in: Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and Adelaide,” she 
tweeted, in a handwritten note referencing her hit song Hello.

The in-the-round production is designed to create intimacy and the venues will 
have reserved seating on both the playing arenas and the grandstands.

Adele kicked off her 2016 tour in February in Belfast, in support of her 
multimillion-selling third album, 25. Since then she has played extensively 
throughout Europe before hitting the US, where she will finish up this month 
after a total of 107 soldout shows.

Rumours of an Australian tour started this week when a teaser ad showing a 
close-up of Adele’s eyes was played on Australian TV.
