The Armenian diaspora, estimated at 10 million, is three times the population 
ofArmenia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenia> itself, with migrants and 
their descendants sprinkled across the continents from Russia to the United 
States, UK, Lebanon and Australia.


 As with many diasporas, Armenians have often flourished in their adopted 
homelands, contributing to business and sport, as well as cultural and 
political life. That diversity is reflected in 10 of the world’s most famous 
people of Armenian descent.

Cher The 68-year-old singer and actor was born Cherilyn Sarkisian, the child 
of an American mother and an Armenian-American father. The multi-award winner 
has revealed that for much of her life she did not feel strongly connected to 
her Armenian heritage. However, that changed when she travelled to Armenia on a 
humanitarian mission in 1993 while the country was at war with Azerbaijan. Last 
week she took to Twitter to share a “horror story” her grandmother had told her 
about the events in Armenia 100 years ago and urged the Turkish government to 
acknowledge them as genocide.

Kim Kardashian The 34-year-old reality television star and professional 
selfie-taker (a book of her selfies is released next month) is one of Armenia’s 
most famous descendants. Kardashian (officially Kardashian West, since she 
married the hip-hop star Kanye West last year) travelled to Armenia, the 
ancestral home of her late father, Robert,for the first time last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/09/star-struck-armenians-keep-up-with-kim-kardashian-kanye-west>
, where she met Hovik Abrahamyan, the prime minister, and laid flowers at the 
Armenian genocide memorial complex. Not one to make her cultural pilgrimages in 
secret, the trip was filmed for Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the family’s 
reality show. The visit has been praised for raising awareness of the 
anniversary of the genocide, something that Kardashian draws attention to each 
year. Her father was a defence lawyer in OJ Simpson’s 1995 murder trial.

 David Dickinson, of Bargain Hunt fame. Photograph: James Stenson/BBC 
David Dickinson The 73-year-old British antiques dealer and television 
presenter was born to an Armenian mother, Eugene Gulessarian, and then adopted 
as a baby by Jim and Joyce Dickinson. The host of Dickinson’s Real Deal and 
Bargain Hunt did not know he was adopted until he was 12 and never met his 
biological mother, though they corresponded until her death. In 2006, Dickinson 
participated in the BBC’s Who Do you Think you Are?, which led him to travel to 
Turkey, where his Armenian ancestors lived before they moved to Britain.
