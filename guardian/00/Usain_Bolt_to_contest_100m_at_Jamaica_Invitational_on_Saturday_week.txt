Usain Bolt <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usainbolt>, the 100m and 200m 
world record holder and Olympic champion, will run his first 100m of the year 
at the Jamaica International Invitational track and field meet at the National 
Stadium on 5 May.

The Racers Track Club athlete made his first appearance of the season two 
Saturdays ago, at the University of Technology Track and Field Classics, where 
he ran the anchor leg in a 4x100m and outpaced the former world record holder
Asafa Powell <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asafapowell> to lead his team 
to world-leading time of 37.82sec.

The JN Jamaica International Invitational is also expected to feature a 
showdown in the men's 200m, with the second-fastest man over the distance in 
history, Yohan Blake, tipped to face off with Powell as the headline contenders.

Bolt, who twice set world records in the 100m â€“ first at the Olympic Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games> in Beijing in 2008 (9.69) and 
a year later at the IAAF World Championships in Berlin (9.58), will follow up 
his Kingston assignment with other 100m runs in Ostrava, Rome and Oslo as he 
continues his preparation ahead of the London Olympics.

Bolt last ran the 100m at the JN Jamaica Invitational in 2008, winning in a 
blistering 9.76 and improving on his previous best of 10.03. He will make his 
first appearance in the 200m event at Jamaica's National Senior Championships, 
set for the National Stadium, 28 June 28 to 1 July.
