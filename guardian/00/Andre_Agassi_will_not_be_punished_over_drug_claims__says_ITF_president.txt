Tennis officials have closed the book on Andre Agassi's drug revelations. The 
InternationalTennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Federation 
president, Francesco Ricci Bitti, said despite appeals from the World 
Anti-Doping Agency, the statute of limitations in the case expired long ago and 
no retroactive punishment is possible.

In Agassi's recently autobiography, Open, he admitted taking crystal meth in 
1997 and then lied to the ATP to avoid a suspension after failing a doping test.

"The ATP is the only entity that could have shed light on what happened, but 
it's too late," Ricci Bitti said. "Wada asked for information from the ATP 
without much success. As a member of Wada's executive committee, I'm obviously 
very disappointed that Agassi – such a great and emblematic player – decided to 
make these revelations.

"I'm sure he had his reasons, which were not easy to understand ... There were 
a lot of strange reasons involved. From a sports point of view, it's very 
unfortunate. I think what he did hurt our sport."
