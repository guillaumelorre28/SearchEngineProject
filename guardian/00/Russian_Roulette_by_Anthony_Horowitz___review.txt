Yassen Gregorovich has a mission: kill Alex Rider. As Yassen prepares to 
complete his mission he remembers a secret leading him to the MI6 spy.

This book reveals Yassen’s past life of his assassin days.

Revealing his past, Horowitz’ Russian Roulette tells who he really is; not an 
assassin but a normal person like you or me.

This book makes me feel as if I am experiencing everything that is happening. 
He is a killer and that is what he wants and it is wrong.
