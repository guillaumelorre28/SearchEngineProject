Legend paints the goat as a devilish creature, and Gordon Brown has learned 
the hard way just how diabolical it can be. From "simple sailor" Admiral Alan 
West to business megaphone Digby Jones, Brown's Government Of All the Talents 
from outside politics produced pain with little gain. The exception was the 
surgeonAra Darzi <https://www.theguardian.com/society/aradarzi>, who yesterday 
said he was quitting as health minister. At a time when MPs' second jobs are in 
the spotlight, Darzi is a reminder of how useful to Westminster wider 
experience can be. His shrewd review of the NHS worked with the grain of its 
professionals, without jumping to their tune. Instead of waging war on the 
medics, as his Blairite predecessors had done, Darzi invited them to take a 
hand in designing their own targets and bound them into reform. He stressed the 
quality of care after Labour's decade-long obsession with quantity. And while 
the drive for private involvement continued, it took a less dogmatic turn. The 
NHS's morale improved, as did its public standing. Despite the 54 letters after 
Darzi's name, though, his political inexperience showed at times - as when he 
casually dismissed a Labour manifesto pledge. But by continuing to practise, he 
forged deep alliances with more experienced hands. He rescued one colleague 
using a defibrillator on the floor of the Lords, and helped another when No 10 
sent him on a 3am house call. It was Peter Mandelson, stricken by kidney 
stones. Darzi's soothing treatment for the NHS will be sorely missed.
