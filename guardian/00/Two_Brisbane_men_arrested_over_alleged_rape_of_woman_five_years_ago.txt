Two Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> men 
have been arrested over the alleged rape of a 20-year-old woman in South 
Brisbane more than five years ago.

The woman was walking along Manning Street after leaving a nearby venue late 
at night in mid-April 2011 when she was attacked.

Two men allegedly forced her into a lane and assaulted her, leaving her with 
serious injuries.

On Wednesday, police arrested a 24-year-old Brisbane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/brisbane> man and charged him with 
three counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of deprivation 
of liberty.

 Detectives also arrested a 32-year-old Brisbane man in northern New South 
Wales on the same offences.

Detective Inspector Garry Watts said the arrests came after many officers 
worked around the clock to investigate the matter.

“This should send a message to the community,” he said. 

Queensland detectives will travel to Lismore on Wednesday afternoon to seek 
the older man’s extradition at his first court appearance. The younger man will 
appear in the Brisbane magistrates court on Thursday.
