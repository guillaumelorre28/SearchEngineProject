Eighty-six people have been accidentally killed by badly trained 
acupuncturists over the past 45 years, according to Britain's leading expert on 
alternative medicine.

A review of patients who died soon after acupuncture found a history of 
punctured hearts and lungs, damaged arteries and livers, nerve problems, shock, 
infection and haemorrhage, largely caused by practitioners placing their 
needles incorrectly or failing to sterilise their equipment.

Many of the 86 patients, aged between 26 and 82 years old, died after being 
treated by acupuncturists in China or Japan, but a handful of fatalities were 
recorded in the US, Germany and Australia. The most recent death, of a 
26-year-old woman in China, occurred last year.

The most common cause of death was a condition called pneumothorax, where air 
finds its way between the membranes that separate the lungs from the chest wall 
and causes the lungs to collapse.

In most of the cases, doctors were certain that acupuncture was to blame, but 
in some the cause was less clear.

,Edzard Ernst, <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edzard_Ernst> professor of 
complementary medicine at the Peninsula Medical School in Exeter, said: "These 
fatalities are avoidable and a reminder of the need to insist on adequate 
training for all acupuncturists."

The number of deaths was likely to be "the tip of a larger iceberg", he added.
