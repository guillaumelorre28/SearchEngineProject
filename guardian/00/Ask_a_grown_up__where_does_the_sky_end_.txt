Usually when scientists talk about the sky, we are thinking of Earth's 
atmosphere: the layer of gases that surround the planet. It seems strange, but 
the atmosphere, or sky, doesn't actually "end". Instead, the higher up you 
go, the thinner – and less oxygenated – it gets. You don't have to go very high 
at all before you wouldn't be able to breathe properly. In fact, people going 
up tall mountains can have problems breathing, because the thin air at altitude 
doesn't contain enough oxygen.

At some height – most people say this is about 100km above sea level – the 
atmosphere becomes so thin that you could begin to think of yourself as being 
in space. Roughly speaking, this is where you need a vehicle to work more like 
a spaceship than a plane. People argue about where space actually begins – some 
people believe it's really 100 times farther from the ground at 10,000km 
above sea level.
