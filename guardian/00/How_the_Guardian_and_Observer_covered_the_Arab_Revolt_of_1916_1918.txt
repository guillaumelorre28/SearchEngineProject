Whilst the first world war is often associated with trench warfare and the mud 
sodden battlefields of Europe a very different conflict was unfolding at the 
outposts of the crumbling Ottoman Empire.

Following the disastrous Dardanelles campaign

 in 1915 Allied hopes in the region came to be aligned with the Pan Arab 
movement nominally headed byHussein bin Ali 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali,_Sharif_of_Mecca> the ‘Grand 
Sherif of Mecca’ who sought to cast off centuries of Ottoman rule.

The commencement of the Arab revolt, which saw Hussein’s followers seize the 
holy site of Mecca and the strategic port of Jeddah, was enthusiastically 
reported in theManchester Guardian on 22 June 1916 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/Mecca_seized.jpeg>. The next day 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1916_-_23_June_-_More_Arab_revolts_copy.jpg>
 reports came in of further revolts in Mesopotamia and of Ottoman reprisals.
 Manchester Guardian, 22 June 1916. 
A piece entitled At the back of the Arab Revolt 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1916_-_26_June_-_Arab_Revolt_copy.jpg> 
appeared in the paper that sought to explain the cause of the revolt. This was 
primarily attributed to the weakness of Ottoman rule, reliant on the consent of 
‘powerful tribal chieftains’ who often denied Ottoman officials the revenues 
raised on their behalf. ‘Turkish power in Arabia is simply nominal, a mere 
paper and map power.’

The Fall of Baghdad to the Indian army in March 1917 was a crucial moment in 
the conflict and widely covered by the Guardian.An opinion piece 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1917_-_3_March_-_Bagdad_copy.jpg>, 
attributed to‘a Student of War’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/first-world-war-history-teaching-resource-gnm-archive>
 and complete with a detailed map, triumphantly claimed that due to the seizure 
of Baghdad ‘we acquire a high prestige amongst the Arabs...If the Arabs can 
rise to the opportunities that are now presented to them the problem of the 
East is settled.’

 Manchester Guardian, 3 March. 
This was followed by General Sir Stanley Maude’s proclamation at Baghdad, 
reprinted in the paper 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1917_-_19_March__-_Arabs_to_be_free_copy.jpg>
, which was addressed directly to the Arab peoples. Maude stated ‘our armies do 
not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as 
liberators.’
 Manchester Guardian 19 March 1917. 
Maude went on to denounce Ottoman rule as the ‘tyranny of strangers’ and 
evoked a dramatic image of the decline of Arab civilisation in an effort to 
stoke the flames of the revolt ‘your palaces have fallen into ruins, your 
gardens have sunk in desolation, and your forefathers and yourselves have 
groaned in bondage’ AGuardian editorial  
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/editorial_maude.jpeg>swiftly followed 
the next day analysing what the proclamation might mean for Arab nationhood.

General Sir Allenby, newly appointed commander 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1917_-_30_June_-_Allenby_copy.jpg>, 
recognised the value of combining with Arab forces in the campaign against the 
Ottomans. 1917 ended withArab raids upon Ottoman railways 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1917_-_29_December_-_Arabs_and_Railway__copy.jpg>
 and theseizure of Jerusalem 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1917_-_15_Dec_-_Capture_of_Jerusalem_copy.jpg>
 which lead the Guardian’s E.W.G. Masterman to contemplate what Allenby’s next 
move might be.

brief but curious report

The capture of Damascus in October 1918 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/Damscus.jpeg> largely heralded the end 
of the British campaign against the Ottoman empire. The Guardian‘s W.T. Massey 
reported on the jubilation that greeted Allenby’s arrival in the city and the 
friendly reception given to British troops by the local populace.

‘I was under the impression that Damascus would display the usual Arab 
calmness of demeanour...and would receive us with their customary immobile 
features...I was amazed at the heartiness of the welcome accorded to the 
British uniform. They threw off their stolid exterior and received us with 
ecstatic joy.’

A personal account 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/Sykes__-_Damascus.jpeg> of Damascus was 
printed in the Observer by Sir Mark Sykes, whose name is given to the secret
Sykes-Picot agreement 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement> he had drawn up. 
Sykes says of Ottoman rule ‘it may be a long while before Damascus can realise 
that the monster that sucked her blood and starved and abused her has indeed 
gone to return no more.’
 Manchester Guardian, 26 May 1919. 
The secret agreement, whilst partially exposed in 1917 following a leak to the 
Guardian 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1917_-_26_November_-_Secret_Treaties_revealed_copy.jpg>
by the Bolshevik government, was brought fully into the open in 1919. This saw 
specific details of the Franco-British arrangementpublished in the paper 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1919_-_26_May_-_Details_of_treaty_revealed_copy.jpg>
.

Almost immediately after the war ended romantic sentiments began to develop 
around the Arabian campaign. This was largely down to the efforts of American 
journalistLowell Thomas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Thomas>, who had 
covered the conflict travelling with T.E. Lawrence and Prince Faisal, son of 
Hussein bin Ali and a key British ally.

An Observer report 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/1919_-_17_August_-_Allenby_and_Lowell_Thomas_(Observer)_copy.jpg>
 in 1919 on Lowell Thomas’ ‘travelogue’, a series of pictures from the campaign 
presented on screen in Covent Garden, reveals the first stirrings of the 
romanticised figure of ‘Lawrence of Arabia’.

‘An interesting figure in the later pictures is that of Sheereef Lawrence, the 
first Englishman who was ever able to handle the Arabs successfully, and who in 
the words of Mr. Thomas “was largely responsible for driving the Turks out of 
Arabia”...These stories of gallant deeds...with the remarkable series of 
pictures that accompanies them, bring home to us in the most vivid way the 
stirring and romantic incidents of the victorious war in the East.’
