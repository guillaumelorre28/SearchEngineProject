, 2 January) is wrong to argue that David Cameron may not want Boris Johnson to 
win the London election. The Tory party has no interest in losing the capital 
two years into this government's term. It will show that no Tory anywhere – not 
even Johnson – is immune. Cameron told Tory MPs only last month that Johnson's 
election was his No 1 priority. Johnson and Cameron stage their disagreements 
to help them both. The Guardian reported last year (14 June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/13/boris-johnson-david-cameron>) 
that their "rows" were conducted within "Queensberry rules". It has been widely 
reported that Cameron, Osborne and Johnson text each other on a "near daily" 
basis as part of an "agreed strategy" for the election. In one meeting between 
the PM and the mayor, the PM is reported to have told Johnson last year that 
"not only do I want you to win next year because we are friends, but I 
recognise there is no way you losing would be seen as anything but a disaster 
for me". They are so worried by Ken Livingstone's plan for a fares cut that 
Osborne found £130m to make this year's above-inflation rise appear less 
painful – to no avail. We should not pretend Cameron wants Johnson to lose. He 
doesn't.
