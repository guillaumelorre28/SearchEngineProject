Warwickshire won the trophy. Andrew Flintoff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-flintoff> grabbed the headlines. It 
may be for one night only but Flintoff returned to the grand stage five years 
to the day after he bid farewell to Test cricket at The Oval. And he almost 
pulled off a victory that would have confirmed his legendary status in these 
parts. Flintoff in his heyday often excelled at Edgbaston.

An injury to Kabir Ali in Lancashire’s semi-final allowed Flintoff his chance 
to play. Flintoff’s first delivery went rather well. Ian Bell, his old England 
team-mate, swung and Karl Brown held the catch at mid-on. So that familiar 
arms-aloft celebration was visible for the first time in five years.

Flintoff bowled two overs, his solitary blemish being a no-ball which was 
thumped for six. Then out he came to bat at No9 – a decisionLancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> might regret – with the game 
almost lost and 30 runs required from 13 balls, surely well out of range. 
Flintoff responded by hitting two consecutive sixes in the penultimate over, 
hinting at a miraculous return beyond the realm of Hans Christian Andersen, let 
alone his near namesake, Jimmy, who was waiting nervously with his pads on. In 
the end the Bears prevailed by four runs but Flintoff fans were grateful for 
the memory.
