An American singer and reality TV star has been signed to play Anna Nicole 
Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/anna-nicole-smith> in a biopic of 
the starlet, who died earlier this year. Willa Ford, who scored a hit single 
with I Wanna Be Bad in 2001, is to the star in the indie production. Keoni 
Waxman will direct.

The picture, entitled Anna Nicole, is expected to cover all the highlights of 
lowlights of Smith's tempestuous life, charting her course from pole-dancer to 
Playboy centrefold to billionaire widow. Smith died from what was ruled as an 
accidental drug overdose in February this year.

Further casting on the film has yet to be announced. It is not yet known which 
actor will take the demanding role of J Howard Marshall - the octogenarian oil 
tycoon who fell passionately in love with Smith after admiring her performance 
at a Houston strip joint.

The self-proclaimed "bad girl of pop", Willa Ford recently competed in the 
third series of the TV reality show Dancing With the Stars, where she was voted 
off after five weeks. You might remember Keoni Waxman as the director of such 
B-movie thrillers as The Suspect, The Highwayman and Hostage Negotiator. Then 
again, you might not.
