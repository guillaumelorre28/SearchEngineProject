One of the questions I receive most frequently from readers is whether our 
individual actions truly make a difference. If you choose to recycle, compost, 
carpool, reduce consumption and refuse plastic bags, does it have an effect? 
Does it matter at all? Will it do anything to eliminate theGreat Pacific 
garbage patch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch>?

The answer is yes.

Now, is choosing to stop purchasing plastic going to single-handedly ensure 
that no more plastic finds its way into the oceans? Of course not. But remember 
that you didn’t create it single-handedly either. Our actions are cumulative: 
together we created this mess, so we must fix it together too – both by 
changing our behaviour as individuals and by demanding change from corporations 
and government.

One way we draw attention to these issues is by celebrating Earth Day on 22 
April. I have mixed feelings about it. At times, I think Earth Day celebrations 
look a lot like Valentine’s Day in a failing relationship. We perform certain 
rote gestures to appease expectation, only to return to the same disappointing 
status quo when the clock ticks over to 23 April. Sure, it’s nice, but is one 
day truly enough?

To combat this anaemic approach, I’ve put together a list of five simple 
shifts you can take on – not just for Earth Day but for ever. These aren’t 
big-ticket changes, they’re not going to drastically alter your lifestyle or 
change your life, and that’sexactly why it’s possible for each and every one of 
us to do them.

Stop buying one-time-use items like paper towels

 Paper towels: use rags or towels instead. Photograph: Alamy 
We buy paper towels largely because we’ve always bought paper towels. It’s 
been almost a decade since I bought some, and I don’t miss them one bit. 
Promise. Use rags or cloths instead, toss them in with your weekly wash and 
you’re all set. By doing so you’ll save money and a few trees too. If every 
household in the US used just one fewer 70-sheet roll of virgin fibre paper 
towels, we’d save544,000 
<http://recyclenation.com/2009/11/going-paper-towel-less> trees from the 
chainsaws every year – not to mention the energy used in their production and 
transportation. Even if this column fails to somehow solicit the cooperation of 
every household in this endeavour, crossing kitchen rolls from just some of our 
shopping lists can have a huge impact.

 Use your own two hands instead of plastic bags if you’ve bought just a few 
small items. Photograph: Mar Photographics/Alamy 
When you’ve bought just one small item or a few which could be easily carried, 
politely refuse the bag they’re about to be put in. Carry your purchases with 
your own two hands and bring reusable bags for larger shopping trips. If this 
seems tiresome, let me lay some guilt down by sharing this heartbreaking 
statistic: more than100,000 marine animals die 
<http://www.animalsaustralia.org/features/say_no_to_plastic_bags.php> every 
single year from getting tangled in plastic bags or ingesting them. One million 
plastic bags are used every single minute worldwide. They’re used for an 
average of five minutes, yet take 1,000 years to break down. We’re better than 
this!

 Vegetables: nutritious, and much more environmentally friendly than meat. 
Photograph: Martin Poole for Observer Food Monthly 
I covered this extensively in an earlier article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/15/new-year-resolution-stop-eating-meat-vegetarian>
, but decreasing your meat intake by just one burger a week can result in the 
same environmental benefit as taking your car off the road for 320 miles 
(515km). Ditching the dairy can also confer significant health benefits, 
reducing fat intake and slashing risk factors for chronic illnesses such as 
cardiovascular disease or type-2 diabetes. Understandably, going completely 
vegetarian or vegan can be an intimidating prospect, so avoid biting off more 
than you can chew by simply committing to doing it once a week.

The clothing industry looks damn good but it can be a dirty, dirty business. 
Immense amounts of resources are used in textile manufacturing, fast fashion is 
everywhere, and85% of shoreline plastic pollution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/27/toxic-plastic-synthetic-microscopic-oceans-microbeads-microfibers-food-chain>
 comes from the plastic fibres in synthetic clothing material such as nylon. 
Avoid the mall and find a great secondhand or consignment store instead.

One study <http://bioenv.gu.se/digitalAssets/1534/1534823_anna-bjurb--ck.pdf> 
reported that the environmental impact of clothing sold by just one Swedish 
secondhand store chain, Emmaus Björkå, was a reduction of 7GWh of energy, 
nearly 1,500 tonnes of CO2 emissions and 947,000 cubic metres of water 
annually. Nowthat looks good.

 ‘If you went a year without buying even one plastic bottle, you’d 
single-handedly save over 7,000 litres of water.’ Photograph: Image Broker/Rex 
This is a no-brainer for large-purse-loving ladies like me, and easily 
achievable if you’re a classy man who likes to rock a man bag (murse?). You can 
buy a kit of bamboo utensils or just pop a spare knife, fork and spoon into 
your bag with a reusable water bottle or jar, and even a stainless steel straw 
or chopsticks, depending on your eating habits.
If you do have to eat on the go, this saves the use of plastic utensils and 
plastic water bottles. By adding these items to your bag, you’ll make a dent in 
the 40m plastic utensils used in the US alone each year. In the UK, plastic 
cutlery is used for seven minutes before being discarded. Seven minutes for 
something which will never,ever biodegrade. 
And as for the bottles, well, it takes seven litres of water to make one 
plastic water bottle.Really 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-515238/We-throw-away-billion-bottles-year-GOT-think-says-environment-minister.html>
. It’s estimated that each person in the UK uses approximately 200 water 
bottles each year, so if you went a year without buying even one plastic 
bottle, you’d single-handedly save over 7,000 litres of water.
