Primal Scream's Screamadelica in 1991 showed how far rock music could be 
stretched when a DJ was let loose in the studio to rip it up and start again. 
Soon, there wasn't a guitar band left without a  "dance element" in their 
music. U2 got in on the act with Melon – featuring a remixes from Perfecto, 
Paul Oakenfold andMassive Attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/massive-attack> – and took DJs such as 
Oakenfold as support on their Zoo TV tour. Cue a lot of baffled rock punters 
"watching a bloke play some records" in stadiums around the world.
