Akker Dakker opened the Grammys with a two-song mini-set. The opened with the 
title trackof their new album, Rock or Bust, for which Brian Johnson employed a 
teleprompter (we hope that was a Grammys requirement rather than a necessity, 
giventhe brevity of its lyrics 
<http://www.metrolyrics.com/rock-or-bust-lyrics-acdc.html>), following that 
with a runthrough of Highway to Hell. If you want to understand exactly what 
the performance meant, then we invite you to pay attention to the video, which
ponders the satanic significance of the performance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hWybVnSJ3o>. Not bonkers at all.

The MTV report on this performance 
<http://www.mtv.com/news/2072530/ariana-grande-grammys-2015-just-a-little-bit-of-your-heart/>
 is most instructive. It informs us that Grande is a “pint-sized diva” 
(apparently 1970s local newspaper subeditors have all found homes at MTV) and 
that her performance was “so heavenly” that “she clasped her hands of [sic] her 
mouth – almost in disbelief”.

Sadly, not a country revision of Prince’s Little Red Corvette, but it’s a 
treat to see one of her guitarists making a brave effort to singlehandedly 
revive the burgundy jacket as a fashion accessory, presumably one he bought 
from Mr Byrite in 1982 (younger readers, ask your dad, or possibly your 
granddad; American readers, ask someone British, and old).

Kanye West – Only One

Also rocking the burgundy was Kanye West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest>, on this startling duet with 
Auto-Tune. Less is more, Kanye decided (except in the cases of both burgundy 
and Auto-Tune, of which more is decidedly more), so he appeared illuminated 
only by stark white lighting, lit mainly from below. Which gave him the air of 
either a returning messiah or a serial killer. You decide which.

Oh, Madonna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna>, the men in horns! 
You’re going to have the fella who think everyone at the Grammys is worshipping 
Satan out again. Why do you have to do it? Anyone would think you’d do anything 
just to provoke a reaction. What’s that? Oh, right.

Good for you, Hozier! The plucky Irish demolisher of organised religion 
realised poorAnnie Lennox <https://www.theguardian.com/music/annie-lennox> 
doesn’t get to win her annual Brit for best female performer anymore, not like 
she used to, so he invited her on stage to have a turn back in the spotlight. 
The good thing about this is that Screamin’ Jay Hawkins had always expressed 
his desire to have his best known song turned into coffee table entertainment 
for people in tuxedos.

Pharrell is more than just a pop star. He’s also a cultural titan, hence his 
co-opting Lang Lang to play piano on this performance, in a gesture that turns 
a chirpy pop song into some ghastly prog rock outtake. On the bright side, it 
give Pharrell and his dancers time to do the hands-up-don’t-shoot gesture and 
smuggle Ferguson into the Grammys. And, doubtless, make the assembled 
super-rich feel good about their commitment to civil rights (the commitment 
that was demonstrated by last week’s white, male Billboard power list 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/musicblog/2015/feb/06/billboard-power-100-2015-time-for-change>
).

It probably passed you by, but the 34th amendment to the US constitution was 
passed last week, grantingBeyoncé <https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> 
the right to do and be anything she wants, and to be praised by all while so 
doing. If she wants to run over cats and be hailed for it, that’s her 
constitutional right. Good job she’s only started off with being a gospel 
singer, eh?

“Why is HE a knight? Why am I – the great, untouchable Kanye – not a knight? 
Why does the world conspire to suppress my expression of my greatness? Do not 
my leather jogging bottoms deserve a knighthood? No, not a knighthood, a 
peerage! I should be Baron West of Beverly Hills! I want to wear leather ermine 
gowns to sit in the Lords! It is my destiny!”

Beck and Chris Martin – Heart Is a Drum

In which the main revelation is quite how tanned and buff Chris Martin looks 
in comparison toBeck <https://www.theguardian.com/music/beck>. Conscious 
uncoupling suits him, evidently.

Sia – Chandelier

Oddity of the evening, right here. Let’s start with Shia La Beouf’s 
introductory poem (sadly clipped from this video), in which he demands: “Punch 
me if I stop crying.” Right, mate, if that’s what you really want, but are you 
sure you’ve thought this through? Then on to the performance, which eschews any 
of that tedious singer-on-a-stage stuff (well. she was there, but singing into 
the back room, her face hidden) in favour of Maddie Ziegler and Kristen Wiig 
performing an interpretative dance. Rolling Stone reckoned it represented “the 
two duelling sides of Sia battling it out before uniting during the 
performance”. We think they were taking the mickey out of interpretative 
dancers.

Jessie J wants again proves her inability to eschew a duet. In the past week 
she has duetted with Mastodon, Aphex Twin, Paddington Bear, the bloke who says 
“mind the gap” at Embankment tube station, Nicola Sturgeon, the Hamburglar, 
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and an IT consultant who happened to be 
on her flight to LA. None of the duets were any good. And neither was this.

Thinking Out Loud sounds a lot like Let’s Get It On. But does it make people 
want to have sex? Don’t write in and tell us. Please.
