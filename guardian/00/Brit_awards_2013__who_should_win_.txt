Is this year's Brits lineup the most boring in living memory? A look through 
thelist of nominees 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/feb/18/brit-awards-2013-nominees>
 hardly sets the pulse racing – although if we cast our minds back to last 
year, when the main causes of excitement were aman walking in front of the 
camera 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/21/brit-awards-2012-live-coverage> and
Adele getting cut off mid-speech 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/22/brit-awards-itv-apologise-adele>, 
the 2013 Brits won't have to do too much to improve matters.

We know there'll be performances from 
<http://www.brits.co.uk/britstv/brit-awards-2013-performers-announced> Justin 
Timberlake, Mumford & Sons, One Direction, Taylor Swift, Muse, Ben Howard, 
Emeli Sandé and Robbie Williams – a fairly safe selection, and certainly 
nothing to rival, say,Bill Drummond and Extreme Noise Terror's set at the 1992 
Brits

 – or evenRihanna's team-up with the Klaxons in 2008
