Nighty night

Thank you so much for your most excellent company for debate night, let’s 
close our coverage for now with a summary.
 The Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Opposition leader Bill Shorten during 
the second debate of the 2016 election campaign held at the National Press Club 
in Canberra this evening, Sunday 29th May 2016. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the 
Guardian 
 * Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten met at the National Press Club for their 
second head-to-head of the campaign at the National Press Club.

 * It was a strange affair, taking about half the allotted time to get into 
stride, then the conversation felt constrained by the format.

 * I scored the encounter a draw, on the basis that neither candidate screwed 
up, and neither managed a particularly compelling break through moment.

 * There was evidence that both sides are refining their core messages. The 
Coalition wants to make the economic conversation to be about ‘we are the 
people with a plan for growth’ Labor has no plan for growth – Labor is now 
angling to rebut this by saying growth isn’t desirable if it’s unfair, which is 
a line with a prospect of cut-through.

 * There was also evidence of Malcolm Turnbull attempting to construct a way 
back to the self that many voters will recognise in a manner that’s consistent 
with the objectives of the campaign. Bit of a pivot there, interesting to see 
how that develops.

Enough for tonight, we’ll be back bright and early on the morrow. Have a 
lovely evening.

It’s a funny thing about preparation. It was clear that all the prep did allow 
both leaders to sharpen a couple of their answers, and to adjust their 
messaging in places where it was beneficial to add a human dimension, or a 
personal story. It did, in the end, improve the communication of both leaders, 
once they got clear of the mind bog, which took the best part of thirty minutes.

The preparation for Turnbull allowed him to present glimpses of his old self – 
the ‘I paid a high price for climate leadership’ would have been workshopped 
behind the scenes within an inch of its life, but it sounded clear, and it 
sounded like him. Shorten too found his voice on the rebuttals on border 
protection, and in the story he’s now trying to tell about growth – you can’t 
have growth without fairness. I think that was all strong for Shorten, and it 
bodes well for the coming weeks on the hustings.

You can’t blame the prep for strangling the conversation, it did aid it in a 
way. I think if the debate had gone into a second hour, it could have actually 
been a cracker.

It’s hard to say why that encounter was so limiting, but it really was 
limiting. As I get a moment to share some pictures and exhale I’ll share some 
more thoughts.

Very quick first thoughts: an hour in quicksand, ending in a draw

Well, only one thing to say initially – that was a deeply weird hour.

Initially, the two leaders couldn’t get out of their own road. Nerves, second 
guessing, spouting buzz words.

Then the format well and truly strangled them. I think both leaders will feel 
that was unfulfilling from a campaign perspective. I can’t imagine voters would 
have learned a great deal.

It’s hard to declare a winner from that encounter because it was like an hour 
spent in quick sand.

My view is a draw, but with that said, I suspect that Bill Shorten will be 
relieved by the questioning tonight, which could have been a lot trickier for 
him than it was in truth. Yes, much of the debate was spent in economy 
territory and in border protection territory, and conventional wisdom says the
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> wins when 
that’s the case, but I thought Shorten kept his feet in both areas.

Two versions of growth

And we are already into closing statements.

Malcolm Turnbull says only the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has a plan for growth.

The reality is Labor has a plan for spending, it has a plan for higher taxes, 
it does not have anything to say about growth. It has nothing to say that will 
deliver stronger growth. Every element of our plan does that. And that secures 
the opportunities for every Australian. It secures our future. It enables us to 
remain a high-wage first-world economy with a generous social welfare safety 
net. Without that strong economy, we can’t pay for any of the promises that are 
being debated in this election. The foundation, the fundamental basis, of 
everything we are considering tonight and over the next five weeks must be 
strong economic growth. We have a plan and our opponents do not.

Bill Shorten:

The Labor view is that you can’t separate economic growth into one column and 
fairness in the other. To have sustainable growth you need to have fairness. By 
contrast, Mr Turnbull’s only plan is a great big spending giveaway of $50bn to 
corporations.

As someone who has paid a high price for acting: Turnbull

Q: If I could turn to a policy where you like to differentiate from each other 
which is coming back to climate change. Isn’t it true that when your safeguards 
mechanism kicks in prime minister there will actually be very little difference 
between your climate change policy and Labor’s, and do the two of you agree 
that what we actually need to achieve on climate policy on the next term of 
government is bipartisanship?

Malcolm Turnbull says he believes in the science, and has paid a high price 
for that belief.

My view is, as somebody who is committed to action on climate change and who 
has paid a high price for my commitment to that issue, for my commitment to 
global action in the past, my commitment is to ensure that Australia meets the 
target we agreed to in Paris and when the global community agrees to higher 
targets, as I have no doubt it will, that we will meet them, too. But I believe 
we should move with the global community rather than taking unilateral action 
that will not influence global action.

Bill Shorten says there is a price to not acting as well as a price embedded 
in acting.

Malcolm, whatever happened to the old Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> on climate 
change? You were so impressive when you were leading on climate change. Now 
you’re just implementing Tony Abbott’s policies.

Things get testy.

Bill Shorten:

In terms of what he said about the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> there’s a big 
difference between me and Mr Turnbull. I genuinely lead my party whereas your 
party genuinely leads you.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, again, it’s another cheap shot from Bill tonight.

Bill Shorten:

The facts are on the scoreboard.

'Shame on you Mr Turnbull ..'

Q: What’s your plan to stop 1600 people staying indefinitely on Nauru or Manus 
when clearly resettlement options in third-world countries or developing 
nations is unattractive to many of these detainees. And will you rule out 
letting any of these detainees come to Australia?

Malcolm Turnbull says the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is committed to ensuring 
that “they are treated humanely and have the opportunity to return from whence 
they came, to the countries they came from, or be resettled in other countries.”

But they will not come to Australia.

Bill Shorten he would send the immigration minister immediately to “sit down 
with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to work through how we 
can have regional resettlement which stops people being kept in indefinite 
detention.”

Andrew Probyn points out that John Howard allowed people to settle in 
Australia despite talking tough about border protection.

Malcolm Turnbull says times are different. People smugglers use social media, 
modern technology to distribute their message. The reality is that every time 
there is a change in the debate here, they are out there marketing and saying: 
“Look, there’ll be an opportunity.”

Turnbull says you can’t trust Labor not to cave to the people smugglers.

Bill Shorten:

Shame on you Mr Turnbull for what you just said.

Shame on you for giving the people smugglers any hope they could be back in 
business. I have made it very clear what the Labor government would do. We 
would defeat the people smugglers. We accept the role of boat turnbacks as we 
should because we don’t want to see the people smugglers back in business. Mr 
Turnbull is playing with fire when he says that somehow Labor would be a better 
deal – and he shouldn’t say that because he just conceded in his own remarks 
that the people smugglers are efficient and watching every bit of the debate.

Thank you so much for your most excellent company for debate night, let’s 
close our coverage for now with a summary.

the second debate of the 2016 election campaign held at the National Press Club

 * Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten met at the National Press Club for their 
second head-to-head of the campaign at the National Press Club.

 * It was a strange affair, taking about half the allotted time to get into 
stride, then the conversation felt constrained by the format.

 * I scored the encounter a draw, on the basis that neither candidate screwed 
up, and neither managed a particularly compelling break through moment.

 * There was evidence that both sides are refining their core messages. The 
Coalition wants to make the economic conversation to be about ‘we are the 
people with a plan for growth’ Labor has no plan for growth – Labor is now 
angling to rebut this by saying growth isn’t desirable if it’s unfair, which is 
a line with a prospect of cut-through.

 * There was also evidence of Malcolm Turnbull attempting to construct a way 
back to the self that many voters will recognise in a manner that’s consistent 
with the objectives of the campaign. Bit of a pivot there, interesting to see 
how that develops.

Enough for tonight, we’ll be back bright and early on the morrow. Have a 
lovely evening.

It’s a funny thing about preparation. It was clear that all the prep did allow 
both leaders to sharpen a couple of their answers, and to adjust their 
messaging in places where it was beneficial to add a human dimension, or a 
personal story. It did, in the end, improve the communication of both leaders, 
once they got clear of the mind bog, which took the best part of thirty minutes.

The preparation for Turnbull allowed him to present glimpses of his old self – 
the ‘I paid a high price for climate leadership’ would have been workshopped 
behind the scenes within an inch of its life, but it sounded clear, and it 
sounded like him. Shorten too found his voice on the rebuttals on border 
protection, and in the story he’s now trying to tell about growth – you can’t 
have growth without fairness. I think that was all strong for Shorten, and it 
bodes well for the coming weeks on the hustings.

You can’t blame the prep for strangling the conversation, it did aid it in a 
way. I think if the debate had gone into a second hour, it could have actually 
been a cracker.

It’s hard to say why that encounter was so limiting, but it really was 
limiting. As I get a moment to share some pictures and exhale I’ll share some 
more thoughts.
 
Well, only one thing to say initially – that was a deeply weird hour.

Initially, the two leaders couldn’t get out of their own road. Nerves, second 
guessing, spouting buzz words.

Then the format well and truly strangled them. I think both leaders will feel 
that was unfulfilling from a campaign perspective. I can’t imagine voters would 
have learned a great deal.

It’s hard to declare a winner from that encounter because it was like an hour 
spent in quick sand.

My view is a draw, but with that said, I suspect that Bill Shorten will be 
relieved by the questioning tonight, which could have been a lot trickier for 
him than it was in truth. Yes, much of the debate was spent in economy 
territory and in border protection territory, and conventional wisdom says the
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> wins when 
that’s the case, but I thought Shorten kept his feet in both areas.
 
And we are already into closing statements.

Malcolm Turnbull says only the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has a plan for growth.

The reality is Labor has a plan for spending, it has a plan for higher taxes, 
it does not have anything to say about growth. It has nothing to say that will 
deliver stronger growth. Every element of our plan does that. And that secures 
the opportunities for every Australian. It secures our future. It enables us to 
remain a high-wage first-world economy with a generous social welfare safety 
net. Without that strong economy, we can’t pay for any of the promises that are 
being debated in this election. The foundation, the fundamental basis, of 
everything we are considering tonight and over the next five weeks must be 
strong economic growth. We have a plan and our opponents do not.

Bill Shorten:

The Labor view is that you can’t separate economic growth into one column and 
fairness in the other. To have sustainable growth you need to have fairness. By 
contrast, Mr Turnbull’s only plan is a great big spending giveaway of $50bn to 
corporations.
 
Q: If I could turn to a policy where you like to differentiate from each other 
which is coming back to climate change. Isn’t it true that when your safeguards 
mechanism kicks in prime minister there will actually be very little difference 
between your climate change policy and Labor’s, and do the two of you agree 
that what we actually need to achieve on climate policy on the next term of 
government is bipartisanship?

Malcolm Turnbull says he believes in the science, and has paid a high price 
for that belief.

My view is, as somebody who is committed to action on climate change and who 
has paid a high price for my commitment to that issue, for my commitment to 
global action in the past, my commitment is to ensure that Australia meets the 
target we agreed to in Paris and when the global community agrees to higher 
targets, as I have no doubt it will, that we will meet them, too. But I believe 
we should move with the global community rather than taking unilateral action 
that will not influence global action.

Bill Shorten says there is a price to not acting as well as a price embedded 
in acting.

Malcolm, whatever happened to the old Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> on climate 
change? You were so impressive when you were leading on climate change. Now 
you’re just implementing Tony Abbott’s policies.
 
Things get testy.

Bill Shorten:

In terms of what he said about the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> there’s a big 
difference between me and Mr Turnbull. I genuinely lead my party whereas your 
party genuinely leads you.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, again, it’s another cheap shot from Bill tonight.

Bill Shorten:

The facts are on the scoreboard.
 
Q: What’s your plan to stop 1600 people staying indefinitely on Nauru or Manus 
when clearly resettlement options in third-world countries or developing 
nations is unattractive to many of these detainees. And will you rule out 
letting any of these detainees come to Australia?
