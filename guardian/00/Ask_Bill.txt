Bill Bryson <https://www.theguardian.com/books/billbryson>, the winner of last 
year's Aventis Prizes for his highly acclaimed guide to life and the universe,A 
Short History of Nearly Everything, will be delivering a lecture on the book to 
the Royal Society on Thursday March 10 at 6.30pm, to coincide with the 
announcement of the 2005 longlist.

He will discuss the challenge of understanding the universe's most fundamental 
principles, and relay stories from his quest to root out its strangest and most 
amazing facts, from the moment of the Big Bang to the rise of civilization. And 
afterwards, he'll be talking to you.

Bill has agreed to answer 10 questions from Guardian Unlimited Books users on 
A Short History, the Aventis Prizes, or anything else science-y you might wish 
to quiz him about. Email your questions tobooks.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk 
<mailto:books.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk> (with 'Bill Bryson' in the title 
field): we'll pick the 10 most interesting and pass them on to the man himself. 
And the fun doesn't stop there: the readers whose questions we choose will each 
receive a signed copy of his award-winning book.
