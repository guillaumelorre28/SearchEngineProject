While encouraging fans to see the movie, which scored a staggering final bow 
of $60.2m

 - even higher thanthe original $56.1m estimate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/17/straight-outta-compton-the-man-from-uncle-us-box-office>
 - in North America, Ren pointed out that F Gary Gray’s film paints him as a 
minor player in the early success of the gangsta rap outfit.

In fact, the MC performed on seven out of the 13 tracks on NWA’s 1988 
breakthrough LP, Straight Outta Compton. He also wrote four songs and co-wrote 
three more. By contrast Ice Cube, who with Dr Dre And Eazy-E gets more screen 
time in the movie, wrote five songs and co-wrote three more.

Ren, real name Lorenzo Jerald Patterson, was not a producer on the biopic, 
while Cube, Dre and Eazy-E’s widow Tomica Woods-Wright were all involved behind 
the scenes. Straight Outta Compton stars Cube’s son O’Shea Jackson Jr as his 
father, Corey Hawkins as Dr Dre, Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E, Aldis Hodge as MC 
Ren and Neil Brown Jr as DJ Yella. The film has been well-reviewed by critics 
and its final total represents the biggest ever August bow for an “R”-rated 
movie as well as the fifth biggest debut of all time for the month.

The biopic has also been praised by African American film-makers. Selma 
directorAva DuVernay <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ava-duvernay> 
congratulated Gray and said the film “captured the plight of the black artist 
in general, once consumed by systems and structures not made for them,” adding: 
“The struggle is real.”

I saw @ComptonMovie <https://twitter.com/ComptonMovie> last night w/ friends 
at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza in South Central with a beautiful, alive, 
invested audience.

Invested because many of them, like me, were there. Teens at the very time and 
in the very place depicted on screen. It had better be right.

I saw the cavalier way that women were treated in hip hop spaces early on. 
Window dressing at most. Disposable at worst. Yep, that happened.

I saw the militarized Batterrams again. Rolling up our streets like invaders 
in a war. My friend asked, "Is that real?" Yep. That happened.

I was in the street during the Rodney King Uprising. After that unjust 
verdict. Feeling anger. And community. And fire. And love. Happened.

I remember the truce. So when that shot of red and blue bandanas tied together 
flashed on screen? Wild applause in my theater. It happened.

The music of my youth and how it came to be and why it was what it was. We 
rapped along, clapped, laughed, cried. For all that has happened.

time while a war was going on against us.@FGaryGray
