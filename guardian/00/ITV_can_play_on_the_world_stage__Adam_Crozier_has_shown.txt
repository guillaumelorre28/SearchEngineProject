Profits up 27%, earnings per share 23% higher, dividend raised 35% with 
another "special" distribution on the way: yes, four years into a five-year 
turnaround programme, success atITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> 
is assured. Smart work, Adam, what's the next trick?

It may be churlish of investors to ask the question of ITV's chief executive, 
Adam Crozier <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-crozier>, but that's what 
happens when a share price doubles in little more than a year. And, when you 
declare a "special" dividend that is bigger than the ordinary dividend for the 
second year in a row, it's fair to wonder whether "special" ought to be 
reclassified as everyday.

These are nice strategic problems to have, of course, and Crozier has a 
further 12 months to draw up his second five-year plan. On current form, 
though, he ought not to be afraid to tell shareholders that the best course is 
more international expansion on the content front.

Rather quietly, ITV has been collecting production houses via acquisitions, 
and can now claim to be a top-five independent producer in the US.

Bolder ambitions could frighten conservative shareholders. But ITV, as 
conceived of a decade and a half ago, was always meant to be a strong UK 
business capable of playing on a global stage.

Internal strife and a dysfunctional structure, then recession, meant the 
ambition was obscured for years. Now that it is in sight again, why not push 
harder?

Demand for English-language content is rising; ITV has displayed a talent for 
judging what sells around the world; and television, it should be clear by now, 
is not going to be obliterated by the internet.

ITV should keep up its international investment. The kitty is sufficiently 
full to allow dividends to rise briskly as well.
