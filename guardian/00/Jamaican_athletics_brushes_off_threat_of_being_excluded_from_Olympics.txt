Jamaican athletics' national governing body has brushed off the threat of 
being excluded from the Olympics

.

The possibility has arisen after the World Anti-Doping Agency president John 
Fahey hinted Jamaica could be declared non-compliant because of possible delays 
in arranging an audit of drug-testing procedures in the Caribbean nation.

Such a move would lead to the country's top athletes being banned from major 
international tournaments such as the Olympics irrespective of whether they 
themselves have done anything wrong.

But Dr Warren Blake, president of the Jamaica Athletics Administrative 
Association, told The Times: "I don't think it's a possibility at all.

"What would London have been without Jamaica? What would 2012 have been 
without our athletes? It's not going to happen."

The Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission is under scrutiny following claims from 
its former head, Renee Anne Shirley, who revealed in August thatonly one 
out-of-competition test 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/22/wada-warns-jamaicans-drug-testing>
 had been carried out in the five months leading up to last year's Olympics.

That led Wada to seek an audit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/14/jamaica-drug-testing-wada-investigation>
 of the organisation, but Jadco has said it cannot accommodate such a process 
until next year.

However, there were suggestions from Herb Elliott, the chairman of Jadco, on 
Wednesday thatWada <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wada> could now visit the 
island next week.

Talking to Jamaica's Nationwide Radio station, Elliott said: "Wada will be 
sending three officers to Jamaica next Monday and Tuesday." Wada did not 
confirm nor deny the report.

Jamaica came under the spotlight after a clutch of athletes including the 
sprintersAsafa Powell <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asafapowell> and 
Sherone Simpson returned positive tests earlier this year.

Shirley, who began her job as executive director of Jadco last July, left her 
post in February after becoming frustrated at the lack of progress.

Leading Jamaican athletes such as Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake face regular 
tests as part of the IAAF's international testing pool.
