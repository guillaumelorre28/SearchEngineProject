 Anne Frank 
Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank is one of the most well read books in the 
world.Anne Frank <https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-frank> was a Jewish 
girl and at the age of 13 World War 2 broke out. Germans were looking for 
anyone they did not like everywhere. Anne frank and her family fled to the 
secret annex in Amsterdam (the capital city of Holland) where they lived there 
for 2 years in total seclusion.

I really liked Anne Frank because you could see her astonishing bravery, and I 
liked the way she made it feel happy sometimes and sad some other times. She 
starts off being happy because she does not know what's really happening. This 
book was interesting because it is a real diary. My favourite character is Anne 
because she had a lot of courage.

Anne Frank and her family were killed except for Otto Frank, Anne's father, 
who later on found her diary and published it, making it a world wide wonder!

The writing style was easy to read. The cover suited the book well because it 
showed her picture and Anne is the main character of the book.

Read what happened to this young girl and how you can understand more. Read 
this book… I dare you!
