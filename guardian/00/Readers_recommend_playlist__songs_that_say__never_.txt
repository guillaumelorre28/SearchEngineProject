The game is defined as Readers recommend, so I’m never going to list a track 
just because it’s from one of my all-time favourite bands – thankfully, though, 
four tracks byBreathless were excellently nominated in one post 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81029837>. In my world 
that would be the initial quartet, but I’d never get away with that. Of the 
four, I went forHelp Me Get Over It 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz1NV3NjTQE&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL&index=1>
, its steady buildup providing a perfect opening track.


Next up, Eurythmics, who say I’m Never Gonna Cry Again 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KLruiHP8U8&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL&index=2>
 – I didn’t want to hang around and I didn’t wanna take your time, so I added 
this early track from back when they were a bit cool’n’edgy (according to 
bishbosh in the comments 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81003741>).

 The YouTube playlist. 
Tony Allen’s N.E.P.A. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn92nI_JuPY&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL&index=3>
 gives advice to those in Lagos with the lyric “Never expect power always” (a 
play on the acronym for the Nigerian Electric Power Authority,so explains 
nilpferd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/11/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-that-say-never#comment-81001254>
). Harnessing the kinetic energy of Tony Allen’s octopus-like drumming could 
produce more reliable power.


I’m never gonna let you down, so next I picked House of Love’s Never 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F9cZazdv1w&index=4&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL>
. The affection for this track was real: thanks to speed typing, with decent 
justificationand links, we received two nominations within seconds of each 
other as the theme was announced. Following that,You’ll Never Know 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhZFl6IYv3k&index=5&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL>
 how much I care, so I’ll letBig Maybelle explain just how.

"But I know my luck too well
yes, I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again"

The Smiths - Hand In Glove <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70>

Never buy an indie album after seeing Sandie Shaw perform on Top of the Pops 
is guidance my dad should have heeded. He made the error after watching Shaw’s 
comeback with a cover of the Smiths’ Hand in Glove 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70&index=6&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL>
, performed with Johnny Marr, Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce – for this playlist we 
have the original version, which features on the band’s debut album, passed 
down to me after his mistaken purchase quicker than you could say “bare foot at 
Eurovision”.

It never happens to me, but it did happen to Vince Clarke after Yazoo split. 
He gave Feargal Sharkey and his unique vocal style a first Top 5 hit asthe 
Assembly with Never Never 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2trrVXF5V4s&index=7&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL>
, so itwas the way his life was meant to be. 


Everybody’s wondering what we should do next, but We Never Know 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxyemSXmfcU&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL&index=8>
 saysNicolette. Look on the bright side, there’s never a right side or a wrong 
side. “Never turn around,” singUnwound in Look a Ghost 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8n4GcRS1cY&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL&index=9>
 (“that came from a thousand years before”). And as we have learned from a 
million B-movies – you never look behind the door.


I’ve Never Loved You More 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieKy8e35Bk&index=10&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL>
, declareTrembling Blue Stars. “I’m so far from being over you I still just 
want to be yours,” they maintain. Bottom lips have a little wobble – and is 
that hayfever making our eyes water?


Pulp’s Common People 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4BNVD5v2EU&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL&index=11>
 “pretend they never went to school”. But even with a thirst for knowledge, 
they will “never understand how it feels to live life with no meaning or 
control and with nowhere left to go”. InInnocence Mission’s Song About 
Travelling 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLioEgjkosQ&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL&index=12>
, “it is the people in the cities you’ll never know” line that justifies 
selection.

Fleetwood Mac The Chain <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1iuSmZHcwY>

And if, you don't love me now 
You will never love me again 
I can still hear you saying 
You would never break the chain

Curiously unzedded...

Never cease listening to a song halfway through – the equivalent of leaving a 
sporting event before the final outcome is known. This is illustrated perfectly 
here byFleetwood Mac’s The Chain 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKGuaN0Nt1c&index=13&list=PLeajfr8eBk1QvW_md6ilmO_3gK2VWnlHL>
, a track of many monumental moments and some sporting history itself – from 
back when the BBC had Formula One. So, to play on the lyrics there, never mind 
the danger: if you don’t love this now, you will never love it again. I can 
still hear you saying, you would never break the Shane.
