It seems not even Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> is allowed to 
go around throwing children into the air.

The Autotune-toting singer has been ordered to stand trial following an 
incident last summer when he threw a teenage fan off the stage at a small-town 
gig. Yesterday, Fishkill Town Justice Harold Epstein ordered Akon, who was 
present for the hearing, to return to the court on December 1 for the start of 
a jury trial.

In June of 2008, Akon was performing at the annual KFEST concert in New York 
state. According to eyewitness accounts, someone threw something at the 
Senegalese-born singer mid-way through the show. Akon asked the crowd to help 
him identify the heckler – and a 15-year-old boy was eventually escorted to the 
stage. Rather than giving the lad a stern Autotuned talking-to, Akon lifted him 
into the air and hurled him into the crowd.

In Fishkill, NY, this is not acceptable. 

Akon now faces a maximum one year and 15 days in jail if convicted on charges 
of second-degree harassment and endangering the welfare of a child. His 
attorneys seem eager to reach a settlement deal, saying in a statement that 
"Akon looks forward to putting this incident behind him, and in the meantime, 
he will continue to meet every requirement set forth by the court."

Even if a deal is reached, however, Akon will still have some trouble on his 
hands. Adding insult – or rather litigation - to injury, a civil lawsuit has 
been filed against him by the woman upon whom the 15-year-old landed. Next 
time, Akon will have to be more careful where he aims.
