Jonathan For four years after leaving home, we lived together, sharing a 
kitchen, but since the 2012 Olympics we’ve lived just shy of 1km apart. 
Sometimes we cook for each other. I do simpler dishes – spag bol, fajitas and 
stir fries – successfully, whereas Alistair goes big. If it goes well, fine, 
but when it goes wrong it goes terribly wrong.

Alistair Jonny thinks he’s the better cook but I think it’s me, although my 
toad in the hole rarely works.

Jonathan There’s someone called Jan who lives next door to Al and when we 
return from a competition she’s always baked a cake for us. And 50 metres away 
is the village bakery run by one of our biggest fans. As runners we crave 
cakes, but must control it.

Alistair Planning a gruelling run or ride on the Dales around cafe stops is 
definitely about reward. Like all athletes I think we have a relationship with 
food which involves feeling guilt if we eat anything without earning it.

Jonathan When we were kids, the mechanic at the local bike shop taught us the 
location of every cafe in Yorkshire. There’s loads, but a favourite is the 
Wharfe View Tea Rooms in Burnsall, with a lovely cake trolley which two really 
nice old ladies push.

Alistair Being allowed out to run at lunchtime, at grammar school, was 
probably the most important and magical thing to have got me where I am today. 
After training, we’d be allowed straight to the front of the queue for a cooked 
lunch. Occasionally we’d abuse being allowed out by racing to the chippy or a 
cafe or bakery.

Jonathan You don’t want too full a stomach. I feel sick before a race, from 
nerves. I used to swear by Coco Pops, then a nutritionist did tests which 
showed it sent my blood sugar high at first but then lower than before. So now 
I have porridge and Weetabix and carbs that are low-GI [glycaemic index]. Or is 
it high-GI? I can never remember. Whichever doesn’t give a sugar hit. At my 
last ever junior world championships in 2009 I ate a bag of Skittles half an 
hour before the race, causing a high then a low, and with 2km still to run my 
body was collapsing. I came second but would have been junior world champion if 
wasn’t for those Skittles.

Alistair At the end of the 2008 Olympics triathlon I jumped into a giant tub 
filled with iced water and Coca Cola cans. Jonny tends to vomitat the finishing 
line.

Jonathan After my 2012 Olympics, I vomited and after the Commonwealth Games 
and after the recent World Triathlon series in Australia too. I won’t celebrate 
with alcohol. I tried wine once. I don’t drink and I never really have. But 
some alcohol is good for Alistair because it helps him relax.

Alistair After the 2012 Olympics I went out to a celebrity cocktail bar with 
[triathlete] Richard Varga and 40 random Slovakians in tow.

Alistair won gold in the triathlon in 2012, with Jonathan taking bronze.

Benefits: recovery in-between sessions


Serves 8
stoned, ready-to-eat dates 250g pack 
boiling water 200ml
bananas 2 small or 1 large 
pecans 100g, 85g roughly chopped, the rest left whole
raisins 200g 
sultanas 200g 
fine polenta 100g 
cinnamon 2 tsp 
baking powder 2 tsp 
egg whites 2 

Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Line a 900g loaf tin with non-stick 
baking paper, using a little oil to make it stick on the sides. Put the dates 
into a small pan with the boiling water and simmer for 20 minutes. Drain the 
liquid into a jug and reserve, then put the dates into a food processor. Add 
the bananas and 100ml of the date liquid and whizz until smooth. Mix the nuts, 
dried fruit, polenta, cinnamon and baking powder in a bowl, then add the date 
puree and stir until combined.

Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks and fold into the cake mix. Tip the mixture 
into the tin (it will be quite full). Bake for 1 hour, or until golden and 
crusty and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to stand 
for 10 minutes in the tin, then cool completely before cutting into slices.
