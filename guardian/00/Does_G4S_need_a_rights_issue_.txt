Does G4S <https://www.theguardian.com/business/g4s> need a rights issue? City 
opinion is divided, but Ashley Almanza, the new chief executive, will know he 
has to make the correct call – and quickly.

For an example of a company that got it wrong look at FirstGroup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/firstgroup>, the transport firm.

It should have tapped its shareholders soon after Tim O'Toole replaced Sir 
Moir Lockhead in 2011. It dallied, thinking it could sweat off its debt burden 
over time with the help of disposals.

But the balance sheet couldn't stand one more blow – the loss of the west 
coast mainline franchise – and a cash call arrived this year on humiliating 
terms.

ITV, on the other hand, with unhelpful regulators and a bleak advertising 
market, was regarded as a nailed-on candidate for a dilutive rights issue when
Adam Crozier <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-crozier> arrived as chief 
executive in 2010.

Crozier thought he could manage without and his judgment was spot-on: three 
years laterITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> is a cash machine and 
has even paid a special dividend.

Which profile fits G4S? In theory, borrowings of £1.8bn shouldn't be 
intolerable with operating cashflow of about £500m last year, and a US disposal 
has been announced since the end of the financial year.

But the numbers are obviously tight and G4S looks very much like FirstGroup in 
one critical regard – it is a business prone to sudden setbacks.

The Olympics contract was an expensive shambles and the outcome of the tagging 
showdown with the government, plus the review of all G4S's contracts, is 
anybody's guess.

Meanwhile, Almanza has inherited a business where profit margins are falling – 
traditionally a dangerous signal in the support services sector.

Unless he has a miracle disposal plan up his sleeve, a modest share issue 
looks the best way to proceed. Safety first.
