The “hacktivist” collective Anonymous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous> have vowed to release the 
names of “about 1,000” Ku Klux Klan members as part of an ongoing operation 
against the white supremacist group in the US.

The names were obtained after Anonymous gained access to a Klan twitter 
account, according to a tweet from the Operation KKK, as Anonymous have named 
the anti-Klan operation.

We've gained access to yet another KKK Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> account. Using the info 
obtained, we will be revealing about 1000 klan member identities.

Operation KKK’s Twitter account said that the name-dump will coincide with the 
one-year anniversary of the beginning of the group’s cyber-war with the Klan 
following a grand jury’s decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson for the 
death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

All will be revealed next month around the one year anniversary of #OpKKK

In November 2014, a local Missouri chapter of the KKK distributed fliers 
threatening violence against activists. The fliers warned protesters in 
Ferguson that they had “awakened a sleeping giant”.


In response, Anonymous declared war on the white supremacy group. They took 
over 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/17/anonymous-takes-over-ku-klux-klans-twitter-account>
 the KKK’s Twitter account and replaced its logo with their own – theaccount 
<https://twitter.com/KuKluxKlanUSA> remains under Anonymous’ control to this 
day – and hit Klan-affiliated sites with DDoS (distributed denial of service) 
attacks. They also released the names of a number of KKK members.

A press release posted online <http://pastebin.com/3mt4xqjf> on Tuesday said: 
“After closely observing so many of you for so very long, we feel confident 
that applying transparency to your organizational cells is the right, just, 
appropriate and only course of action.”


“You made a clear and ever present enemy of Anonymous when you threatened the 
lives of protesters and the men and women representing Anonymous on the ground 
in Ferguson, Missouri in November of 2014,” the release said. “You continue to 
make threats to anons you believe you have identified, journalists, anyone in 
the public that speaks out against your behavior. Your threats and intimidation 
are unprovoked, unwanted and will not be tolerated.”


Anonymous is a disparate and amorphous group of hackers and online activists 
which originated on the anarchic message-board 4chan around 2003. Its name 
comes from the “anonymous” tag that posters on 4chan get; users of the site, as 
well as members of the group, both refer to themselves as “anons”.


Anonymous, which operates as a grassroots-style organisation with no visible 
leadership or membership structure, has chosen a disparate group of targets 
since its inception roughly 12 years ago. Its first high-profile operation, 
known as Project Chanology, targeted the Church of Scientology.

It has targeted child pornography rings and the Westboro Baptist church, and 
attacked

 PayPal when it withdrew support from WikiLeaks (for which two hackers were 
laterimprisoned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/25/game-over-anonymous-hackers>
 and a third given a suspended sentence.)


The practice of revealing someone’s identity online is known colloquially as 
“doxxing”. It is usually considered anathema to the culture of Anonymous; but 
they appear to have made an exception to this rule when it comes to lifting the 
hoods of Klan members.


The Twitter account chronicling “Op KKK” hinted on 15 October that more 
doxxing might be imminent.

Been hearing a lot of rumblings from the LWK as of lately. Maybe time to pop 
some hoods.#HoodsOff <https://twitter.com/hashtag/HoodsOff?src=hash>

Founded after the civil war, the Ku Klux Klan is considered America’s oldest 
hate group by theSouthern Poverty Law Center 
<https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan> 
(SPLC). At its height in the 1920s it had as many as four million members; 
today its membership is estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000.

“Ku Klux Klan, We never stopped watching you,” Anonymous said in Tuesday’s 
release. “We know who you are.”


“We never said we would only strike once,” it continued.
