It’s not very rock’n’roll, but I’ve always loved an energy rating. A third of 
the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from Energy Using Products (EUPs) in 
offices and industry and also, significantly, in our own homes, too. The ones 
we control can really help to reduce that percentage, so choosing the best 
energy-rated model makes sense.

EU energy labels 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-new-eu-energy-label-explained> 
give us an easy way to power down. Regulated by European law, they can help us 
see how efficient a product is before we buy it, and also mandate vampirical 
products that suck power out of the grid when you think they’re asleep (since 
2010 products cannot have standby power greater than 1W). Don’t ask me what 
happens after Brexit. I worry about that, too.

For now, sust-it.net <https://www.sust-it.net/> rates a Panasonic as its most 
energy-efficient TV. Today, TVs are 60% more efficient than they were five 
years ago. That has everything to do with energy ratings.

However, ultra high definition (UHD) TVs are not so efficient. They offer 
impressive definition – but the waste is phenomenal. If America switches its 
300m HD TVs to UHD, annual electricity consumption will increase by 8bn 
kilowatt hours. To make matters worse, an investigation by theNRDC 
<https://www.nrdc.org/> (National Resources Defence Council) found that TV 
manufacturers in the US may bemanipulating their energy ratings 
<https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/uhd-tv-energy-use-report.pdf>. The 
NRDC reported that energy consumption for popular TV models (I am yet to 
determine whether any are available in the UK) that seemed efficient under test 
conditions soared by up to 50% in real world use.

Meanwhile in Europe, a review of appliance ratings, the Smart Testing of 
Energy Products (Step), will report later this year and hopefully restore my 
faith in energy ratings. Until then, do not adjust your sets.

The big picture: let there be light!

 Solar system: this electricity-free light costs just $5. 
The international charity SolarAid has a grand plan to light up Africa, 
providing light to 598 million people on the continent who lack access to 
electricity. It’s not easy. But the newly launched SM100, commissioned by 
SolarAid and designed by Yingli Europe, brings that plan several steps closer. 
Retailing at US$5 in several African countries, it is billed as the most 
affordable solar light ever.

Well dressed: from trash to fashion

 Net benefits: EcoAlf recycles almost anything, including fishing nets. 
A truly sustainable Spanish fashion brand, EcoAlf offers a new ‘trashion’ 
concept where every waste product presents a new possibility. Plastic bottles, 
used tyres, coffee grounds, recycled wool and fishing nets are transformed into 
different fabrics, yarns and components for clothing, accessories and shoes.

Their latest project, Upcycling The Oceans, is helping to remove waste from 
the sea (abandoned nets are a major ecological nuisance) thanks to the support 
of fishermen.

EcoAlf are operating 14 joint ventures globally, collecting and processing 
waste fabric into new and brilliant designs – many of which can be reused and 
recycled again. Gwyneth Paltrow and Richard Gere are among their fans. 
Hopefully it’s only a matter of time before other fashion brands follow suit.
