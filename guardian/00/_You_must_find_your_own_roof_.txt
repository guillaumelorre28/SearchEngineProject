"There are no poor people in Tanzania," Dr Isaac Khama states emphatically. 
"The people of Chamwino are not poor. They have chickens."

Dr Isaac is assistant director of the Morogoro municipal council. He is patron 
of the ward of Chamwino, one of the most impoverished areas of Morogoro 
municipality. "It is no use to complain that you have no roof," he says, 
leaning back on his chair. "That is not good enough."

Asha Abrahim has no roof. "When the rains came, the walls collapsed," she 
explains. "I cannot rebuild them." Asha is 72 years old. She lives in a single 
room with four children and they allÂ share the same bed. "I get wet when it 
rains at night," she continues, pointing up at a thatch of loosely-woven palm. 
"We have to get up then, and wait for the rain to finish." The rainy season in 
Morogoro lasts from December to April.

Asha's story is not unusual for Chamwino. Most people in the community live in 
dilapidated buildings, beneath a makeshift roof of palm or scrapped iron. This 
is a violation of their right to adequate shelter, as defined by a number of 
international human rights covenants.

"Your human rights do not apply here," Dr Isaac explains. "This is Tanzania. 
If you want a roof you must find your own roof."

Dr Isaac's views are less representative of government policy than of a 
pervasive attitude among Tanzania's political classes that would blame poor 
people for their poverty. It is an attitude that the Faraja Trust Fund is 
helping the community in Chamwino to defy.RP
