No mere three-chord punk dullards, Washington DC's Bad Brains had chops to 
spare. They'd started as jazz-fusion quintet Mind Power, worshipping at the 
altar of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra until they discovered the Sex 
Pistols. Refashioning themselves as Bad Brains, these four Rastafarians played 
whip-tight punk rock at nosebleed velocity, also dropping occasional 
Jah-praising dub jams into their setlists. Such efforts won Bad Brains a ban 
from every club in their hometown.

Sixteen-year-old skater Ian MacKaye first met Bad Brains at a Cramps gig in DC 
in January 1979, forming his own group Teen Idles after seeing them play. 
Besotted, MacKaye invited the cash-strapped Bad Brains to rehearse in the 
basement of their singer's parents' house, later saying that "watching Bad 
Brains work was inspirational… They were the fastest, greatest band in the 
world." After Teen Idles split in 1980, MacKaye fronted Minor Threat, whose 
brutally brief thrashes, righteous politics and DIY ethic kickstarted the 
hardcore punk movement that spread across America in the early 80s. The scene's 
moral compass – he pioneered the straight-edge movement, which eschewed drugs, 
alcohol and casual sex – MacKaye founded the fiercely independent Dischord 
Records and steered hardcore away from flirtations with skinhead violence. Bad 
Brains' subsequent career was more haphazard: singer HR recorded vocals for 
their 1986 album I Against I from jail, serving time for cannabis possession.
