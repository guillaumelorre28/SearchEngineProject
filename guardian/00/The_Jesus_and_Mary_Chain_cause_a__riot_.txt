Opinions vary as to whether you could call the Jesus and Mary Chain's show at 
the North London Poly a riot. For some, the sight of an audience storming the 
stage and smashing up the band's equipment after a typically short, chaotic set 
was "blood-in-their eyes destruction". For others, it was a bit pathetic. 
Either way, nothing like it usually happened at indie gigs, thus cementing the 
Mary Chain's reputation for controversy and fast-tracking them to mainstream 
attention.
