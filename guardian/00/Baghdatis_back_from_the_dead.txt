Unseeded Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis continued his irrepressible run of form in 
Melbourne today, fighting back from two sets down to beat fourth seed David 
Nalbandian 3-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.

"I'll have to wake up and check if I'm dreaming," Baghdatis said after the 
marathon match. "I don't know what to say - it's amazing."

Baghdatis enjoyed vocal support in the Rod Laver Arena but the former junior 
world No1 didn't start with the same energy that had seen him past the 
challenge of Andy Roddick and Ivan Ljubicic days earlier and Nalbandian quickly 
broke.

The Cypriot broke back immediately but couldn't fend off some clever high 
percentage play from Nalbandian and dropped the first set after being broken 
again in the eight game.

Easing into this stride, Nalbandian raced to a 5-1 lead in the second set but 
was pegged back to 5-5 by a determined Baghdatis, who managed to find some 
unlikely angles and benefitted from some sloppy groundstrokes from his 
opponent. The Argentine held his nerve to take the set 7-5 - but the fightback 
from Baghdatis soon began to take its toll.

As the Cypriot's confidence grew so his shots improved: time and again the 
backhand down the line snatching points from an unhappy Nalbandian, and 
Baghdatis profited from some superb serving down the middle of the court.

Nalbandian led 4-2 in the final set before Baghdatis reeled off the last four 
games to secure an astonishing victory after more than three hours' play.

Rain had briefly interrupted play before Baghdatis took a second match point 
with a thumping ace. He will play the winner of the semi-final between Roger 
Federer and Nicolas Kiefer in Sunday's final.
