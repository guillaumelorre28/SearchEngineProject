Cooper, a lawyer for the family, confirmed the plane was one of several the 
composer owned.

wife, Joan, Horner trained at the Royal College of Music in London before 
returning to study for a degree in music at the University of SouthernCalifornia

After a composing career which began in the concert hall, Horner cut his teeth 
in Hollywood in the late 70s on The Lady in Red. He earned his first Academy 
award nomination for Aliens and went on to score more than 100 films, including 
the blockbusters Braveheart, Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.

 In one of the last TV interviews before his death in a plane crash in southern 
California, Oscar-winning composer James Horner talks about the success of 
Titanic and his musical score to the film 
Horner’s music will hold a special place among the hearts of moviegoers who 
grew up in the 80s watching such films as Willow, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and 
Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan. Seth MacFarlane heralded his “spectacular 
legacy”.

“I’m different from some other composers,” Horner once said 
<https://twitter.com/scottymwatson/status/613207608401395712> of his own work, 
“because I don’t look at this as just a job. I see music as art.”
