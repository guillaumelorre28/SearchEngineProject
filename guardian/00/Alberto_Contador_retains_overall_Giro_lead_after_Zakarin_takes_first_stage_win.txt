Russia’s Ilnur Zakarin clinched his first grand tour stage win after holding 
off the chasing pack following a brave break 20 kilometres from the finish of 
stage 11 of the Giro d’Italia on Wednesday.

The 25-year-old Katusha rider, who won the Tour of Romandie this month, broke 
clear on a climb around the rain-sodden finishing circuit of the Imola race 
track and held on to win by 53 seconds.

Spain’s Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> 
retained the pink jersey with an unchanged three-second lead over Italy’s Fabio 
Aru.

Contador had launched a speculative attack with 6.5km remaining, but was 
pulled back into the peloton at the finish.

“There wasn’t much terrain to have a go today but I knew that there were a few 
riders who weren’t enjoying themselves and weren’t feeling good, so I had a 
go,” Contador said.

It was a quiet day for Team Sky’s Richie Porte, who remains 3:09 off the pace 
in the general classification after receiving a two-minute penalty on stage 10 
for receiving a wheel from another rider.

The Australian had a puncture 5km from the finish of Tuesday’s stage and Simon 
Clarke of Orica gave him his front wheel, contravening rules that prevent 
riders from rival teams assisting each other.
