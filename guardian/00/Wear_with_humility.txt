You argue (Unthinkable? Poppy week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/unthinkable-poppy-week>, 
13 October) about "cultural tyranny" and how difficult it has become to express 
opinion about war "without appearing to dishonour the dead", yet fail to 
mention that there is a perfectly viable option available in choosing to wear 
the white poppy. Whereas the British Legion's red poppy commemorates and 
supports "members of the Armed Forces, veterans of all ages and their families" 
(British Legion website <http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/about-us/>), the white 
poppy commemorates all victims of war – friend or foe, combatant or civilian – 
and seeks to raise awareness of alternatives to war. The white poppy is 
distributed by the Peace Pledge Union, a task it took over from the 
Co-operative Women's Guild a year after it began producing them in 1933. 
Wearing the white poppy does not dishonour the dead; rather it seeks to mark 
their suffering while at the same time aiming to ensure that alternatives to 
war are explored. White poppies are available from thePPU website 
<http://www.ppu.org.uk/>: wear yours with humility.
