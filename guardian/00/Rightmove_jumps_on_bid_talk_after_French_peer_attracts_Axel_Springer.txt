In a week heavy with takeover talk comes the latest speculation, this time 
surroundingRightmove, the property website.

The company's shares have climbed nearly 9% - up 62.5p to 770p - following 
news that German publisherAxel Springer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/axel-springer> is offering to buy a French 
peer of Rightmove, SeLoger.com for â‚¬566m, a 13% premium to its closing share 
price yesterday. Traders said the move put the spotlight on Rightmove as a 
potential bid candidate. Given Springer is a publisher it didn't take too much 
time for the likes of Daily Mail and General Trust to be suggested as a 
possible predator for Rightmove.

Last month Rightmove <https://www.theguardian.com/business/rightmove>, which 
claims to be the UK's leading property website, said it was attracting record 
numbers of househunters despite the current uncertain market. During the six 
months to the end of June, the number of page impressions on its website jumped 
by 22% to 3.9bn. March was a record month, said the company, while April 
included its busiest day ever.
