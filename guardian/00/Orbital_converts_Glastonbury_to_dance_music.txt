You barely notice pivotal moments when they're happening. Not so at the 
Glastonbury festival <https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury> on the 
night of Saturday 25 June 1994 when the NME Stage experimented with dance music 
in the face of an indie crowd still sceptical of music without guitars. I 
remember dragooning a parade of dehydrated, disoriented walking wounded into 
yomping across baked earth with the exhortation: youhave to see Orbital.

The show was a revelation that changed the nature of the festival. Brothers 
Paul and Phil Hartnoll played uncompromising, uncut, complex but fantastically 
thrilling electronics, their heads bobbing up and down inside their control 
tower with only their trademark torch spectacles visible like two 
extraterrestrials. Techno bled into drum'n'bass into dream-like abstract 
reveries, and some 40,000 people roared the Hartnolls on, bringing to life the 
paradox of dance music: there's nothing so human as machine music. A year later 
Glastonbury had a Dance Tent. Now it has a whole Dance Village, with a host of 
stages catering for everything from techno to dubstep, drum'n'bass to future 
garage, acid house, disco, soul and funk, with headliners such as Fatboy Slim 
playing alongside Carl Cox, Pete Tong and the Chemical Brothers.

Before Orbital <https://www.theguardian.com/music/orbital> went onstage they 
were sick with fear, but the triumph of the show made them festival icons. "At 
the end we did the dance we used to do when we were little kids and naked and 
about to get in the bath," says Paul Hartnoll, "banging our bottoms together 
and laughing. It was just brilliant. It was like, we'vemade it."
