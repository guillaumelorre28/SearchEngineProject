John Newman is being called, variously, a chump and a soulless gimp. Oh dear. 
Not sure which is worse. Anyway, thanks for sticking with me during my liveblog 
of what can only be described as The Best Later... Ever To Follow An English 
Football Victory Over Poland.

Oh not this soulless gimp again! Off! #laterjools

Next week: Arctic Monkeys, Paul McCartney, and Katy B are so far pencilled in 
for show 6. I say pencilled in but presumably at this point contracts have been 
signed, and everything's been crossed and dotted with the threat of 
cancellation under pain of death. Bit like us freelancers and this Liveblogging 
lark. 

10.35pm BST 

Buika caused joy in some quarters, consternation in others. For one irritated 
viewer, it summed up the whole programme...
Yvonne Morrison (@YvesM) 
@zinzi_amp <https://twitter.com/zinzi_amp> Someone called Buika. Ooft, was 
pretty painful jazz. It's been a hard show to watch tonight!

Not everyone was impressed with Newman being the show-closer...
Lee Martin (@leemartin912) 
It's a shame such a mediocre signer brought along such a big backing band that 
shows him up even more.#JohnNewman

Steve Watson has an intriguing query re: tonight's show...
Steve Watson (@stvwatson) 
Watching Jools Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jools-holland>. Is 
his aim to have the greatest, the worst, and the weirdest of music on his show? 
MGMT just made noise for 3mins!

10.31pm BST 

And with that sashay, the fifth Later... of this series comes juddering to a 
northern soul halt. 

What did you think, folks?

10.30pm BST 

There he goes! Is he sashaying? I believe he is. 

10.29pm BST 

Apparently, people love that dancing style of his. They flock to see it. 
FLOCK! 

10.28pm BST 

Blimey, that flew by. 

How come Newman closes the show? Apart from the fact that he's the only one 
who's come within a sniff of the charts this century. Okay, apart from 
Passenger. AndMGMT <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mgmt>. 

10.26pm BST 

Buika doing Siboney. Is she not called Concha anymore? Lots of people are 
loving Passenger on Twitter btw, which we'll come to in a bit. Meantime, this 
is - what? Hispano-Scat? Jazz-a-guese? It's different, for sure. Not sure what 
she's air-playing, though. And I speak near-fluent Spanish but I can't fathom a 
word of what she's singing. Back to school for me. As for Buika - looking 
forward to seeing what viewers are making of this. 

10.23pm BST 

MGMT doing Lou Reed. That's just the first few seconds. I always found the 
MGMT "sell" a bit confusing. Are they a sexy duo? Or a full band? Live, the 
pair get swamped by all the musicians, and this is no exception. It should be 
the main twosome, and the other players behind a curtain. Would be our advice. 

10.21pm BST 

Becky Hender needs no convincing. 
Becky Hender (@beckhola) 
not that big of a passenger fan but I've fallen in love with this performance 
on Jools Holland

<https://twitter.com/beckhola/statuses/390225321217110017> 
10.19pm BST 

Passenger. Doing Let Her Go. Is he a superior James Blunt? A Brit Bon Iver? Ed 
Sheeran with a tremulous quaver? Not sure how this got to number 1 in 16 
countries - that isn't a criticism, just wondering how and why such a quiet 
acoustic ballad caught on in such a big way. Anyone?

10.17pm BST 

Jools mis-pronounces "calibre". But he has got a cold. 

10.15pm BST 

It's a showdown between the two most blokey, diamond-geezer-y, 
snug-in-the-corner-of-the-pub pop Londoners ever!

10.14pm BST 

And now, "one of the greatest Englishmen of all time - Suggs!"

10.13pm BST 

Lloyd Cole. The somewhat less multi-levelled Edwyn Collins. He used to look 
like the ultimate undergrad, now he's got lecturer chic down pat. The word 
"dissertation" gets an airing. Is he wearing jumbo cords? And Hush Puppies? 
Like the Third-album-Orange Juice-y chord sequence. Which, okay if you want to 
be finicky about it, derives originally the Velvets. Remember witty, literate 
'80s pop? Cole was one of the masters. Welcome back. 

10.09pm BST 

Anna Calvi <https://www.theguardian.com/music/anna-calvi>, doing Eliza. As 
opposed to Eliza Calvi doing Anna. She's wielding that guitar like a reliant 
scimitar. Which was a popular make of car in the '70s. Calvi tends to divide 
audiences. Some think she's the bee's whiskers - among them, Brian Eno, who 
called her the new Patti Smith - while others are less impressed. Actually, 
that guitar work is fancy, and her voice holds up well with all those 
vowel-stretching things she keeps doing. Nice one. I feel guilty for a tepid 
New Band of the Day article I wrote on her a few years back.

10.05pm BST 

John Newman is first. The last time I saw him it was a sweat-box in Islington 
and he was losing weight before our eyes. Tonight he looks more composed and 
less perspired. Like the Moz hearing aid. Is that an affectation, or a medical 
requirement? Nice strings. Well Anne Dudley. Newman sounds like the portly 
gentleman from the Commitments, but looks like he's just stepped out of the 
'90s Romo revival. Disconcerting. He's testifying now. We know that because 
he's on his knees, begging you please. James Brown would love it. No, not the 
bloke from loaded, the soul legend. 

9.58pm BST 

Two nil! Two blinkin' nil! And now, to find out who lobs it over the keeper's 
head and knocks it into the back of the net on tonight's episode of Later... 
Will MGMT score one for proggy psych electro-pop? Or will Calvi do the business 
on behalf of epic gotherama? And so metaphorically forth. 

9.03pm BST 

While we wait to see if England can capitalise on their one goal lead, we can 
only wait and wonder... if nearly 30 years on, Lloyd Cole still has Perfect 
Skin.

close  Lloyd Cole on telly in 1984, being all pop literate and allusive and such
8.25pm BST 

Here is MGMT in Manchester last night. I'm using the singular because in 
America they use the singular when they talk about bands. The Beatles is great. 
The Rolling Stones is satanic. That kind of palaver.

close  MGMT in Manc, 14/10/2013 
8.20pm BST 

Meanwhile, MGMT's job tonight is going to be to replicate the quality of their 
performance in Manchester last night. A job that some, notably Tweet-person 
Jaytree, would probably argue is nigh on unachievable. 
Jaytree (@Jaytree333) 
#MGMT <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MGMT&src=hash> were GREAT last night

A gentleman by the name of Rob Adams, to name but one, feels that our 
favourite purveyor of copla is "unmissable".

Concha Buika appears on Later with Jools Holland tonight. Unmissable.

Also on tonight! According to Twitter - and Tweets always prosper - Suggs of 
Madness will be on chatting to Jools. Expect lashings of bonhomie in a built-up 
area (if Maidstone can indeed be considered to be built-up). 
Later... on BBC Two (@BBCLater) 
Also in studio tonight Madness frontman @suggsgmcpherson

4.55pm BST 

Hello, good evening, and welcome to another Guardian liveblog. 

This week, the guests on this bands-and-singers-performing-in-the-round-fest 
include:

* MGMT! who started off as a poppy, junior Flaming Lips and then Went Psych 
and are now coming back with a self-titled third album, which Pitchfork awarded 
6.2, which would roughly be a 2:2, maybe even a 2:1, at university, if the 
general level that year was fairly low.

* John Newman! who was recovering from a brain tumour when he found out he was 
number 1 with Rudimental and hit number 1 again this summer with Love Me Again 
and number 9 last week with Cheating.

* Anna Calvi! who the Guardian recently described as 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/06/anna-calvi-one-breath> “an 
extraordinary and uncompromising talent, with her swelling guitar chords, 
passionate lyrics and a voice that sounds like it comes from within an echoing 
cave of emotion”. It must be quite a cave. 

* Lloyd Cole! who is so bookish he makes Paddy McAloon look like Liam 
Gallagher and has just released an album called Standards that got to number 22 
in Sweden. 

* Concha Buika! who is a Spanish singer and Grammy nominee in 2008 for the 
Latin Album of the Year. Her music is classified variously as flamenco, copla, 
soul and jazz. We love us some copla. 

* Passenger! who is a folk-rock singer from Brighton with a single Let Her Go 
that topped the charts in 16 countries and reached no 2 in the UK last year and 
is so sensitive he will make you weep, possibly with rage.
