The term malaria originates from the Italian mal aria, meaning bad air. It was 
thought that breathing infectious air from swamps and rotting vegetation spread 
the disease. However, we now know malaria is caused by a parasite that is 
transmitted through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito.

One of the reasons why malaria is so widespread in sub-Saharan Africa is the 
high density of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. These mosquitoes are highly 
efficient transmitters of the disease and take a large percentage of their 
blood meals from humans.

If an uninfected mosquito bites a carrier of malaria, it ingests the parasites 
through the blood. These parasites develop and reproduce in the mosquito's gut. 
Then, when an infected mosquito bites a human, they deposit the parasite into 
the blood.

In conjunction with the mosquito, sub-Saharan Africa is also home to the most 
virulent genus of parasite, thePlasmodium falciparum. Unlike other types of 
malaria that only attack specific red blood cells, P. falciparum invades them 
all. The parasite grows in the red blood cell, consuming the haemoglobin, and 
then asexually reproduces and infects other red blood cells. It is this cycle 
that, left untreated, can lead to death.

The final factor to consider is the environment. The terrain is ideal for 
mosquitoes. The female mosquitoes lay their eggs in water and the tropical 
environment and vast expanses of water, particularly in the rainy season, 
provide perfect conditions.
