Describe your job in three sentences.

I'm a movie writer/director. I have to create entertaining stories that speak 
to an audience through beauty, emotion and truth of the human experience. The 
writing half is very solitary, whilst the directing allows me to collaborate 
and lead a vast creative team to complete my vision.

How did you get to where you are today?

I started out as a child actor, before moving to writing. I worked hard, wrote 
a lot of scripts, some that were made and some not, and then eventually began 
directing the work that i had written.

What is the proudest moment of your career?

Winning a BAFTA for writing and directing my film, A Way of Life, and knowing 
my parents were watching.

What one piece of advice would you give to women following in your footsteps?

Don't take no for an answer. Trust your instincts, and tell stories that move 
you personally - those are the ones that are most likely to touch audiences.

What are you working on now?

My film, Belle, is released in the UK on June 13th through Fox Searchlight. 
I'm about to direct a thriller for Warner Bros in LA, called Unforgettable and 
I'm working on Where Hands Touch, an indie World War II drama that I've written 
and will shoot in Germany.
