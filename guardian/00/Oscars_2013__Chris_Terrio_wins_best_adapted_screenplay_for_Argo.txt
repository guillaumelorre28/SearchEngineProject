Chris Terrio has won the best adapted screenplay Oscar at the 85th Academy 
Awards in LA, defeating a strong field that included Tony Kushner for Lincoln 
and David O Russell for Silver Linings Playbook.

Directed by Ben Affleck, Argo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148728/argo> tells the story of the 
"Canadian caper", the extraction of six hostages by CIA agent Tony Mendez from 
the 1979 US embassy siege in Iran.

Based on a Wired magazine article by Joshuah Bearman, as well as Mendez's own 
bookThe Master of Disguise <http://www.themasterofdisguise.com/bio_Antonio.html>
, Argo marks Terrio's first appearance as an Academy Award nominee.

Terrio's victory in this category will no doubt provide some compensation for 
Affleck, who was bafflingly excluded from the best director category despite 
wins at the Baftas and Golden Globes.
