The Spaniard, who has won all three Grand Tours in his career, had been linked 
with the team throughout the summer after reversing his original plan to retire 
at the end of the season, when his current Tinkoff team will withdraw from the 
sport.

“I am thrilled about the opportunity that is in front of me,” said Contador, 
who finished fourth in the Vuelta a España earlier this monthafter being forced 
to withdraw from the Tour de France with injury

.

“Trek-Segafredo is a very attractive and ambitious project that really 
inspires me. I had some excellent conversations with the team management, and 
we have a lot of goals and priorities in common. The big objective is to try 
and win the most important races on the calendar – first and foremost the Tour 
de France.”

The 33-year-old Contador won the Tour in 2007 and 2009, and is also a 
two-times winner of the Giro d’Italia and three-times winner of the Vuelta.

Contador was stripped of his victory in the 2010 Tour after a positive test 
for clenbuterol which he blamed on contaminated meat. Contador’s trusted 
team-mate Jesús Hernández will follow him from Tinkoff, as will sports director 
Steven de Jongh.

While Contador is the most high-profile signing, he will join the likes of 
John Degenkolb, Jarlinson Pantana and Matthias Brandle at a much-changed 
Trek-Segafredo next year as the team prepare for the retirement of star rider 
Fabian Cancellara at the end of the season.
