This year the Booker prize judges set out to surprise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/26/man-booker-prize-2011-longlist-debut>
, and succeeded. Although there are three usual suspects – Alan Hollinghurst 
withhis magisterial saga of the English literary establishment in the last 
century 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/17/strangers-child-alan-hollinghurst-review>
, Sebastian Barry witha lyrical novel of loss and exile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/20/on-canaans-side-sebastian-barry-review>
, and Julian Barnes witha mournful novella on memory and regret 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/26/sense-ending-julian-barnes-review1>
 – many big names are missing. Ali Smith, David Lodge, AL Kennedy, Philip 
Hensher, Anne Enright and more; most notably, Edward St Aubyn, whose final 
novel in the Melrose series many hoped would win its author the closure of a 
Booker gong.

Instead they have sought out some overlooked books and small presses: a 
portrait of Bucharest in the last days of the Ceaucescu

 regime from Welsh publisher Seren; agritty East London drama

 from Oneworld;a dystopia about a future in which biological terrorrism makes 
pregnancy fatal

 from Sandstone. And in doing so the judges have found their stories in strands 
of literature sometimes confined to the genre shelves:DJ Taylor's Derby Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2011/jul/26/man-booker-prize-2011-in-pictures#/?picture=377281045&index=12>
 is billed as a "Victorian mystery", Patrick deWitt'sThe Sisters Brothers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2011/jul/26/man-booker-prize-2011-in-pictures#/?picture=377281062&index=3>
 is a blackly comic western, and AD Miller's Snowdrops is a Muscovite thriller. 
The Testament of Jessie Lamb, Jane Rogers' apocalpytic chiller about "maternal 
death syndrome", could even help to rebut those frequent accusations that the 
Booker ignores SF.

History also provides a motor to this longlist, with Alison Pick's novel about 
the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia inspired by her grandparents' story, Esi 
Edugyan's Half-Blood Blues also looking back to the Nazi era to examine the 
Afro-German experience, and Carol Birch's rollicking seafaring quest inspired 
by such 19th-century gems as a real-life charismatic London naturalist and 
survivors' tales from wrecked whaleships.

Hollinghurst will, of course, be the bookies' favourite. But with their taste 
for the unexpected, I wouldn't be surprised if the judges looked further 
afield: perhaps to Stephen Kelman's Pigeon English – a daring debut about a 
young Ghanaian boy caught up in London knife crime, which somehow achieves a 
Dog in the Night-time-style charm – or Birch's Jamrach's Menagerie, which would 
be a convincing winner in any year.
