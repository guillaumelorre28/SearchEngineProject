The Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> Thaer al-Halabi left 
behind was a ghost town filled with the shadows of friends lost to war and the 
shattered dreams of a different Syria.

Still, the parting resembled physical pain. He was born in Aleppo, in a house 
in the old town with a courtyard shaded by vines, where his family had lived 
for over a century. He raised a family and built a career there, and then, for 
four years, gambled everything he had on the possibility of taking down Syria’s 
president, Bashar al-Assad.

“When we were forced to leave Aleppo it had already been destroyed completely. 
You didn’t see a city, only ghosts, in a ghost city,” said the 57-year-old 
engineer turned opposition politician.

“I am very sad I have left our city, it’s at the centre of our hearts, part of 
our bodies. But because we need freedom we cannot live there.”

Halabi said he was jailed three times by the government before the war, so 
when the uprising against Assad first turned into armed rebellion andrebels 
took half of Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/syria-foreign-fighters-joining-war>
, he didn’t think twice about joining them. “We had freedom for four years,” he 
said.

Aleppo, which was Syria’s cultural and economic hub before the conflict, 
became a byword for devastation far beyond the country’s borders, afteryears of 
brutal air raids 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/13/fight-for-aleppo-is-almost-over-but-a-new-phase-of-misery-begins>
 to try to oust rebels.

In the early years of the fighting, life in rebel-held areas was not all 
horror and violence. There was a local council set up to govern, schools still 
operated. People went to work when they were not severed from their offices by 
the frontline, or set up new businesses and tried to ignore the war.

“Life went on amid the bombing,” said Sara, a 47-year-old teacher who also 
stayed in Aleppo until the enclave’s final days. “There were schools, 
businesses, shops, there were goods and people, entertainment, everything.”

For the young in particular, rebel-held Aleppo offered the wild liberties of 
an unfiltered web. “On the other side of the city was regular Syrian government 
that block everything they don’t want,” said Halabi’s son, the activist and 
journalist Rami Zein.

“On our side of the city it felt like you are in a place open to the world. 
Before the siege it was a great city, you had everything you need, could bring 
everything you need from the border [with Turkey], all kinds of trade, 
everything was there.”

As the war intensified though, death and destruction touched growing numbers 
of families. Aleppo became notorious for the horror ofbarrel bombs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/-syriaairstrikes-major-offensive-against-rebel-held-areas-of-aleppo>
, dropped from helicopters on civilian areas to spread death and fear.

The footballer Mohammed Khalifa’s sister was among the early victims. The 
family had moved house to escape heavy shelling in their old neighbourhood, 
nearer the frontline, where planes could fly over rebel-held areas with virtual 
impunity.

The barrel bomb that took his sister’s life also seriously injured his 
daughter, who was raced to Turkey in an ambulance. Khalifa followed more slowly 
through the border checkposts, and when he reached the hospital a doctor 
mistakenly told him his daughter had died.

“I raced in to try to see her body,” he said, “and they told me she actually 
was alive but had serious head injuries. She survived, thank God, and is with 
me now.”

The bomb also destroyed a small shop they had set up, along with two cars, but 
despite their losses the family decided not to leave as the bombings 
intensified and a siege began.

“I wanted to stay in Aleppo because of my commitment to the revolution and its 
principles; I started that way and won’t change until I finish,” said Khalifa, 
30, who said he played with the national team before the war began.

The growing bombardment prompted an exodus to refugee camps and brought those 
who stayed constant tragedy. “We lost so many people not just to bombs and 
other weapons, but also because of displacement,” said Sara, who has three 
children and asked to use a pseudonym to protect relatives still in 
government-held areas.

Like many civilians in rebel-held zones, she stayed in touch with family, 
friends and former colleagues in west Aleppo by phone, although Assad’s 
surveillance state usually made all but the most anodyne conversation 
impossible.

“We cannot talk about the war because our friend may be in danger, only hello, 
how are you and a few words, because Assad is watching everything,” said Halabi.

After Russia joined the air war in September 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/russias-military-action-in-syria-timeline>
, the bombing raids on Aleppo became more intense, with huge bunker buster 
missiles, white phosphorus and a range of other munitions added to the constant 
rain of barrel bombs.

“The shelling would not stop, it continued without mercy,” said Halabi. “Just 
to go to the market, you had to believe you were already dead, so you could 
have the courage to leave the house. When we got back to the house this was a 
new life.”

Then the siege began in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/syria-rebels-unite-break-aleppo-siege>
, as the government turned to a technique that had helped reclaim other cities: 
starving and demoralising fighters and the civilians who supported them into 
submission.

“In every corner of your life you find something missing, like your mobile 
charge, your laptop charge, even warmth if you are cold, water for showering. 
You have to use everything carefully and think twice,” said Zein.

They would run short of water because there was no fuel to pump from the 
wells. Zein felt permanently weak, cold and dirty, and would sleep for up to 15 
hours a day, when illness and the temperatures allowed. “When I got out of 
Aleppo,” he said, “I couldn’t remember the last time I had a shower.”

As government forces closed in, people who had turned down many chances to 
leave finally decided to flee, fearing imprisonment, torture, death or forced 
conscription if they came under Assad’s control. Most left in crowded buses 
with little beyond the clothes on their back.
Aleppo lost rebel territory

“Finally we had to get out. I couldn’t take anything except my dignity with 
me,” said Khalifa. He is now in nearby Idlib province, crammed into the home of 
a relative with his wife, two children, two brothers and their families.

“At the checkpoints they stopped us, searched us and took stuff from people 
with us. Our money, our cars, our generator, our house, all of them are left in 
Aleppo. We came out with nothing. As regards the future I am lost, lost, lost.”

They feel luckier than most of the people evacuated to Idlib, who are 
struggling for shelter and food in a province covered with snow and still a war 
zone. The UN has said Idlib may be the next Aleppo, a focus for a new push by 
forces loyal to Assad.

Some who endured Aleppo’s siege and bombardment say they are prepared to 
suffer further rather than flee into exile, because while they have lost their 
homes, they still have their dream of change.

 “I am not going to another country, unless in the end they push me out, like 
they did from Aleppo,” Halabi said. “I will try to stay in my country if I can.”
