Earlier today I set you ten questions from this year’s International Singapore 
Maths Competition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/05/can-you-solve-it-are-you-smarter-than-a-singaporean-10-year-old>
. <http://www.ismc.sg/> Here are the questions and the answers. On the whole 
you did very well - smarter than a 10-year-old Singaporean! (With the caveat 
that they didn’t have multiple choice answers to choose from, and they are only 
ten). The only questions where your most popular answer the wrong one were 6 
and 8. (C in Q6, and B in Q8). Thanks for taking part - now look through your 
workings...

For Year 5 pupils:

1. Mary cut off 2/5 of a piece of string. Later, she cut off another 14 m. The 
ratio of the length of string remaining to the total length cut off is 1 : 3. 
What is the length of the remaining string?

 * A. 5 m

 * B. 7 m

 * C. 10 m

 * D. 14 m

Solution is C. [73 per cent of readers got it right]

Oh Mary! This is how I would have solved it, using equations. Let L be the 
original length of the string, and R be what is remaining once you have cut the 
string twice. We know that R = (L x 3/5) – 14m, and that ((L x 2/5) +14) /R = 
3, or 2L/5 + 14 = 3R. By substituting the first equation in the second we have 
2L/5 + 14 = 9L/5 –42. Which rearranges to:7L/5 = 56, or L = 40. So R = 10m.

Interestingly, the Singapore <https://www.theguardian.com/world/singapore> 
method of solution is different. It requires us to think more visually about 
the string: We cut 2/5 of it. Then 14m, and are left with a piece that is a 
third of the size of what was cut. In other words, we are left with 1/4 of the 
original length. In order to compare the fractions 2/5 and then 1/4, lets 
change them to the lowest common denominator, which is 20. So, we cut off 8/20, 
subtract 14m and are left with 5/20. Let’s now draw the string divided into 
twentieths:

The 14m must be 7/20 of the string, which mean each twentieth is 2m. The 
remaining piece of string is 5/20, i.e 10m

2. The areas of the faces of a rectangular box are 84 cm2, 70 cm2 and 30 cm2. 
What is the volume of the box?

 * A. 300 cm3

 * B. 420 cm3 

 * C. 490 cm3

 * D. 504 cm3 
Solution is B. [85 per cent of readers got it right]

First we need to work out the possible side lengths, by seeing which two 
numbers multiply to be the area of each face. The 84 face could be 1 x 84, 2 x 
42, 3 x 28, 4 x 21, 6 x 14 or 7 x 12. The 70 face could be 1 x 70, 2 x 35, 5 x 
14 or 7 x 10. The 30 face could be 1 x 30, 2 x 15, 3 x 10 or 5 x 6.

 * The common factors between 84 and 70 are 1, 2, 7 and 14.

 * The common factors between 84 and 30 are 1, 2, 3 and 6.

The only way to make 84 with one each of these common factors are 14 from the 
top line and 6 from the bottom. So the edge bordering the 84 and 70 faces has 
length 14, and the edge bordering the 84 and 30 edges has length 6. Which means 
the height must be 30/6, or 70/14 = 5. Thus the volume is 14 x 6 x 5 = 420cm.

3. There are four numbers. If we leave out any one number, the average of the 
remaining three numbers will be 45, 60, 65 or 70. What is the average of all 
four numbers?

 * A. 50

 * B. 55

 * C. 60

 * D. 65

Solution is C. [82 per cent of readers got it right]

If the four numbers are A, B, C and D, then we know that

 * A + B + C = 45 × 3

 * A + B + D = 60 × 3

 * A + C + D = 65 × 3 
 * B + C + D = 70 × 3 
Now add them up to get 3A + 3B + 3C + 3D = (45 + 60 + 65 + 70) × 3

Which is A + B + C + D = (45 + 60 + 65 + 70) = 240. So their average is 240/4 
= 60

4. A march goes through the streets from the School (S) to the Community 
Centre (CC). One of the streets is closed. If the march can only travel East or 
South, what is the number of different possible ways to get to the Community 
Centre? [10 per cent]

5. Sally was given a set of 5 cards numbered 1 to 5 and Peter was also given a 
set of 5 cards numbered 1 to 5. They were then blindfolded and told to pick a 
card from their respective sets. The sum of the numbers from the two cards was 
told only to Sally and the product of the numbers was told only to Peter. They 
were then told to guess the two numbers. Below is what each of them said:

Peter: I do not know the two numbers.

Sally: Now I know the two numbers.

Peter: I still don’t know the two numbers.

Sally: Let me help you. The number I was told is larger than the number you 
were told.

Peter: Now I know the two numbers.

What are the two numbers? 

 * A. 1 and 4

 * B. 1 and 5

 * C. 2 and 4

 * D. 2 and 5

Solution is A. [72 per cent of readers got it right]

Since each of them were each given numbers 1 to 5, if Peter was told any of 
the following numbers, he would be able to tell what the two numbers that were 
picked were:

 * 1 → 1 × 1 The two numbers are 1 and 1.

 * 2 → 1 × 2 The two numbers are 1 and 2.

 * 3 → 1 × 3 The two numbers are 1 and 3. 
 * 5 → 1 × 5 The two numbers are 1 and 5. 
 * 6 → 2 × 3 The two numbers are 2 and 3.

 * 7 → 1 × 7 The two numbers are 1 and 7.

 * 8 → 2 × 4 The two numbers are 2 and 4.

 * 9 → 3 × 3 The two numbers are 3 and 3.

 * 10 → 2 × 5 The two numbers are 2 and 5.

 * 12 → 3 × 4 The two numbers are 3 and 4.

 * 15 → 3 × 5 The two numbers are 3 and 5.

 * 16 → 4 × 4 The two numbers are 4 and 4. 
 * 20 → 4 × 5 The two numbers are 4 and 5. 
 * 25 → 5 × 5 The two numbers are 5 and 5. 
(Products 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23 and 24 cannot be formed.)

The only product that is ambiguous is 4 since 4 could be equal to 1 × 4 or 2 × 
2. Therefore, when Peter said that he did not know the numbers, Sally would be 
able to know that the product Peter was told had to be 4. Since Sally said that 
the sum she was told is larger than the product Peter was told,the two numbers 
that were picked had to be 1 and 4 (sum = 5) and not 2 and 2 (sum = 4).

6. There are 4 keys and 4 locks. What is the maximum number of times you need 
to try the locks so as to match all 4 keys to their locks?

 * A. 4

 * B. 6

 * C. 10

 * D. 16

Solution is B. [30 per cent of readers got it right]

If you try 3 keys on the 1st lock, you will know that the 4th key is a match. 
So, you only need a maximum of 3 tries. Similarly, the 2nd lock needs a maximum 
of 2 tries and the 3rd lock needs only 1 try. Thus, 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 tries are 
needed.

8. What is the number of times the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock 
form a right angle with each other between 0600 and 1200 on the same day?

 * A. 11

 * B. 12

 * C. 23 
 * D. 24

Solution is A. [39 per cent of readers got it right]

The times the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock form a right angle with 
each other between 0600 and 1200 are approximately at 0617, 0649, 0722, 0754, 
0828, 0900, 0933, 1005, 1038, 1111, 1149.

Note that this happens twice every hour, except between 0800 and 1000 when it 
happens only three times and not four times as expected. This is because at 
0900 exactly the hands form a right angle. Thus between 0600 and 1200 it 
happens (6 × 2) − 1= 11 times.

Now we can write down some sums:

If the number of students who like science divided by the number of students 
who do not is 5/3, then 5/8 of the total like science and 3/8 don’t. Since the 
total number of students is 240, then the number who like science is (5/8) x 
240 = 150

So, the number of students who like only science = 150 – 86 = 64

Likewise the number of students who like Mathematics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/mathematics> = (7/12) x 240 = 140

So, the number of students who like only Mathematics = 140 – 86 = 54

And the number of students who dislike both Science and Mathematics is 
therefore 240 – (64 + 86 + 54) = 36

10. My teacher had 3 big boxes of sweets. Each box contained sweets of a 
different colour. Each pupil was given 5 sweets of two different colours. If 
each pupil in the class received a different combination of colours, what was 
the largest possible number of pupils in the class?

 * A. 8 

 * B. 12

 * C. 16

 * D. 64

Solution is B. [67 per cent of readers got it right]

Assume the three colours are red, blue and yellow. There are only 4 different 
combinations for any two colours. So, for red and blue the combinations are:

 * R R R R B

 * R R R B B

 * R R B B B

 * R B B B B

There are 3 ways to choose 2 out of 3 colours: 

 * red-and-blue,

 * blue-and-yellow

 * red-and-yellow

 So the different colour combinations for 5 sweets is 4 × 3 = 12 combinations. 
Hence, the largest possible number of pupils is 12.

I hope you enjoyed these puzzles, I’ll be back with some more teasers in two 
weeks.
