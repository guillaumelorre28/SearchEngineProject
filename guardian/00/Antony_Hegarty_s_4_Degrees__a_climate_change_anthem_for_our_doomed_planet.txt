As leaders start to thrash out the details of what could be a major agreement 
on climate change in Paris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/30/india-set-to-unveil-global-solar-alliance-of-120-countries-at-paris-climate-summit>
, they’ve been given an incendiary warning – a new song fromAntony Hegarty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/17/antony-hegarty-condemns-genocide-of-indigenous-peoples-in-australia-and-us>
, now recording under the name ANOHNI, that instantly earns its place in the 
pantheon of great musical protests.

On releasing the track, Hegarty wrote on Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/AntonyandtheJohnsons/posts/10153817435943552>:

In solidarity with the climate conference in Paris,
giving myself a good hard look,
not my aspirations but my behaviors,
revealing my insidious complicity.
It’s a whole new world.

Let’s be brave and tell the truth as much as we can.

Its title, 4 Degrees, seems to allude to a rise in global temperature; twice 
the level that underpinsthe climate modelling

at the conference, but the amount that Australian researchers predicted the 
world would reach by the year 2100. Hegarty sings an apocalyptic wishlist: “I 
want to hear the dogs crying for water / I want to see the fish go belly up in 
the sea / And all those lemurs and all those tiny creatures / I want to see 
them burn.” For the chorus, she shrugs: “It’s only four degrees”.

One reading is that this is a persona, a kind of cartoonishly nasty oil baron. 
But much more interesting is the idea that this is Hegarty herself speaking, 
voicing a monumental act of self-laceration at her own “complicity”. Merely by 
living as she does, as all of us do with our air-freighted fruit and phone 
upgrades, Hegarty is willing death upon the planet. The song contains all our 
collective arrogance: we all wonder how much difference four degrees could 
really make, and assume that the world will weather our rapacity.

She goes further still, voicing the ultimate taboo: that we revel in the 
exciting end-times madness of climate change, and even perhaps wrecked the 
world as a perverse declaration of our power over it. The song prickles with 
the shame of this idiocy.

It is hugely affecting, its sledgehammer galvanised by the superb production 
by Hudson Mohawke andOneohtrix Point Never 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/18/oneohtrix-point-never-garden-of-delete>
. It’s a kind of modulation of the former producer’s Scud Books, but where his 
trademark horns were sexily macho on that track, that alpha male posturing is 
now repellent. By casting the apocalypse as uplifting and beautiful – even 
liberating – the horror is made all the more vivid.

This is the charred flipside to Hegarty’s earlier masterpiece, Another World, 
a piano ballad that waved goodbye to the beautiful Earth: “I need another world 
/ this one’s nearly gone... I’m going to miss the sea / going to miss the snow 
/ going to miss the bees / miss the things that grow.” As a lament, it was 
heart-stopping, and yet 4 Degrees is more powerful still. It goes beyond mere 
sadness, and into guilt, and panic. This is a song that reminds us what is at 
stake in Paris, and how all of us have sleepwalked to the brink.
