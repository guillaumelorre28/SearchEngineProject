The Advanced Style website has discovered that many a woman is still going 
strong and looking great even when she's well past what used to be pension age. 
I was reading about it again (it had been in these pages a few weeks ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/may/03/advanced-style-fashion-blog-for-older-women>
) in theHuffington Post, whose founder, Arianna herself 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/30/arianna-huffington-interview-find-stories-everywhere-huffington-post-news>
, is no spring chicken – though what she prints doesn't always reflect her own 
preferences (she made her name writing about women being happiest as 
traditional homemakers – not a thing she'd fancy herself).

Advanced Style features elegant senior New Yorkers, but a week or two ago in 
London there was strong corroboration of the view that oldies can perfectly 
well be golden at the 25th anniversary celebrations of the start of the British 
branch of theInternational Women's Forum <http://iwforum.org/>.

IWF members are not of any one kind, either by job, age or nationality; so 
there were all sorts of different styles: a senior lawyer from Texas wore red 
and distributed stars for us to remember the Lone Star state; the president of 
the British Forum wore a long skirt during the day and several women wore short 
skirts or trousers to the black-tie anniversary dinner.

The young may be best at fashion, but style is individual, and one thing you 
do grow out of is any idea that you have to look like the young – who didn't 
necessarily look better than those described on their cards as "Young at heart, 
slightly older in other places".
