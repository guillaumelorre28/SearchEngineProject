A bigger than expected rise in motor insurance prices from Direct Line has 
seen shares in the sector accelerate.Admiral has added 22p at £16.31 while 
Direct Line itself is 4.5p better at 396p.

Direct Line, whose brands in Churchill and Green Flag, said motor insurance 
prices rose 8.4% in the third quarter, marking a continuing revival in recent 
months after increased competition had put pressure on in the past few years. 
This was partly offset by a 0.9% dip on home insurance prices, and the company 
said Nationwide - one of its current partners - was reviewing its home 
insurance provider.

The company has also been cutting costs, with a 7% reduction compared to the 
first nine months of last year. Peel Hunt analyst Andreas van Embden said:

Overall Direct Line reported a solid set of third quarter numbers with rate 
increases in motor confirming the third quarter data from the main motor rate 
indices (Confused.com/The AA). The UK Motor market is turning, however claims 
inflation continues to remain above average in the second half of 2015, with 
Direct Line warning that large bodily injury claims inflation remains 
‘volatile’.

The company continues to benefit from its efficiency drive and it is 
comfortable it will meet Solvency II requirements with a similar capital ratio 
as under its existing economic model.... Direct Line trades at a 2016 PE of 15 
times, broadly in line with the sector albeit benefits from a strong capital 
base and a reducing cost structure. We believe the shares will be supported by 
a turn in the motor cycle.
