The Oscar-winning actor Charlize Theron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlize-theron> has compared press intrusion 
into her life to rape.

The star, who is in the UK to promote the film A Million Ways To Die In The 
West, made the comments when she wasasked by Sky News 
<http://news.sky.com/story/1271754/charlize-theron-press-intrusion-like-rape> 
if she ever Googled herself.

She said: "I don't do that, so that's my saving grace. When you start living 
in that world, and doing that, you start I guess feeling raped."

Asked if she felt that strongly about the issue, Theron said: "Well, you know 
when it comes to your son and your private life. Maybe that's just me. Some 
people might relish all that stuff but there are certain things in my life that 
I think of as very sacred and I am very protective over them.

"I don't always win that war but as long as I don't have to see that stuff or 
read that stuff or hear that stuff then I can live with my head in a clear 
space, which is probably a lot healthier than living in that dark room."

In the same interview, the South African-born actor said: "My job has made my 
life incredibly blessed and good and I am very grateful for that, but it does 
not mean that every aspect of my life all of a sudden becomes fodder for an 
article."

Theron, who won a best actress Oscar in 2003 for her portrayal of serial 
killer Aileen Wuornos, came under fire online for her comments.

One Twitter user said: "She should try telling that to a real rape victim," 
and another said: "How stupid to comment about press intrusion the same as 
being raped. Makes my blood boil!!"

Twilight star Kristen Stewart apologised after making similar remarks in 2010 
during an interview with Elle magazine.
