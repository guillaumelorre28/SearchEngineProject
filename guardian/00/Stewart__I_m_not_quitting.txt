Alec Stewart said he has no immediate plans to retire after spanking a 
half-century in the fifth Ashes Test against Australia.

The 39-year-old is under pressure to hold his spot in the team from a handful 
of younger players including promising wicketkeeper James Foster but said he 
has no intentions of quitting just yet.

"People have written me off," Stewart said. "But you have personal pride and 
you go out there and do your best. That's why we play and hopefully why I can 
keep playing."

Despite battling a mystery illness which was first diagnosed as chickenpox 
then later cleared, Stewart smashed 71 off 86 balls to help England amass a 
first innings total of 362 and give themselves a chance of ending their run of 
four Test losses against the Australians.

Along the way, he overtook Geoff Boycott as England's third highest runscorer 
in tests, taking his total from 126 appearances to 8,149, trailling only Graham 
Gooch (8,900) and David Gower (8,231).

"When you play as long as you have you are going to go past certain people," 
Stewart said.

"But when you're in the company of your Gooches and Gowers and Boycotts then 
it means you must be a pretty good player."

Stewart also paid tribute to Australian captain Steve Waugh for his last-ball 
century saying he couldn't help but be touched by the moment.

"People have been writing him off but today he showed what he's been showing 
for 17 years and he's a cricketing legend in my opinion," Stewart said.

"With all the publicity that's gone with Steve for a while now, as much as you 
don't like to say it, you're actually pleased in a way he got it.

"It was like watching Brian Lara get his 375 in Antigua. You enjoy great 
moments whether it's in your own team or the opposition."
