There is nothing Aidan Barclay <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aidanbarclay>
 dislikes more than publicity. Requests for interviews are turned down and 
entries in the MediaGuardian's power list was positively discouraged.

In the flesh he is an affable man, and his media-shy tendency is probably 
inherited from his father Sir David and his uncle Sir Frederick whose empire he 
will inherit.

The reclusive Barclay brothers originally made their fortune through property 
investments. It was only in the 1990s that they moved in to publishing.

They rescued the now-defunct European in 1992, bought the Scotsman in 1996 and 
two years later relaunched Sunday Business.

The paper was saved from collapse last year by a restructuring that involved 
severe cost-cuts and a joint deal with the Press Association for content.

But Aidan, who describes himself as in his mid-40s, showed the depth of his 
ambition two years ago when he made a tentative £75m bid for the Express Group, 
pulling out at an early stage when he believed the then owner, Lord Hollick, 
was not taking his bid seriously.

The Scotsman is not out of the woods yet - it has gone through a succession of 
editors, among them the Daily Mail's Rebecca Hardy, who was unceremoniously 
asked to walk the plank when circulation fell.

Whether the early tumbles in publishings are bruising enough to put the 
Barclay scion off newspapers and media forever has yet to be seen.
