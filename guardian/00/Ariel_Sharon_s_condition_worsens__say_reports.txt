The medical condition of the former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ariel-sharon> has deteriorated significantly 
eight years after a severe stroke at the height of his premiership left him in 
a vegetative state, according to reports on Wednesday.

Sources quoted in the Israeli media, said death could come "in a matter of 
days". His family was reported to be at his bedside.

Sharon, 85, suffered a devastating stroke on 4 January 2006, five years after 
being elected prime minister. He spent months in hospital in Jerusalem before 
being transferred to a long-term care facility at Sheba medical centre near Tel 
Aviv.

Last January, doctors said the former prime minister had exhibited "robust 
activity" in his brain during tests. Scans showed Sharon responding to pictures 
of his family and recordings of his son's voice. However, doctors said the 
chances of him regaining consciousness were almost zero.

Four months ago, Sharon underwent surgery to insert a new feeding tube, 
through which he receives fluids.

A former military general, Sharon was a hardline rightwinger in political 
office. But in 2005 he ordered the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops and 
settlers from the Gaza Strip, a move many considered a dramatic change in his 
political strategy. Within weeks of his stroke, Hamas won Palestinian elections.
