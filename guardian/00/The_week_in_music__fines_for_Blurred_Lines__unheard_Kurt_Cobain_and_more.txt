Robin Thicke and Pharrell lost their plagiarism lawsuit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/blurred-lines-pharrell-robin-thicke-copied-marvin-gaye>

There were no blurred lines (sorry) around this jury verdict. On Tuesday, 
Robin Thicke andPharrell Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/pharrellwilliams> were ordered to pay Marvin 
Gaye’s estate almost $7.4m (£4.9m), when a jury decided Thicke and Williams 
could be considered guilty of copying Gaye’s Got to Give It Up when writing 
Blurred Lines.

The Gaye family also want to block sales of Blurred Lines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/11/marvin-gayes-family-want-blurred-lines-taken-off-sale>

In a further blow for both Williams and Thicke, the lawyer representing Gaye’s 
family hinted at plans to block sales of the song until all parties can come to 
an agreement on how its future profits will be shared. If only they’d been able 
to block the incessant radio airplay of the track over the summer of 2013, and 
spare us all the repetition.

Madonna forgot about intersectional feminism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/12/madonna-women-are-the-most-marginalised-group-in-society>

Just a quick note for human beings everywhere: sometimes it’s possible to be 
affected by multiple facets of discrimination at the same time. That’s 
basically what intersectionality andintersectional feminism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/23/in-defence-of-intersectionality>
 mean. Madonna didn’t seem to have a handle on the concept when she told the 
gay publication Out magazine that women, after gay men and African Americans, 
represent the last frontier of discrimination. So … some people can’t fall into 
several of those categories? Ah, of course – there’s no such thing as a brown 
lesbian or disabled person who might still be battling for the recognition of 
their basic human rights. Sure.

It’s moved along for the gay community, for the African-American community, 
but women are still just trading on their ass. To me, the last great frontier 
is women.

Azealia Banks released a video that can feature your face 
<http://guardianmusic.tumblr.com/post/113348462925/watch-azealia-banks-interactive-video-for-wallace>

Banks has partnered with Google Chrome to release an interactive video for her 
new song Wallace. If you’ve got a working webcam and watch the video on Chrome, 
you’ll find yourself popping up onscreen with Banks. It’s creepy and wonderful.

An unheard Kurt Cobain song to be on film soundtrack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/unreleased-kurt-cobain-song-montage-of-heck-film-soundtrack-brett-morgen>

Brett Morgen, the director of the forthcoming music documentary Kurt Cobain: 
Montage of Heck, has said that it will feature a previously unheard acoustic 
song by the Nirvana frontman. Undoubtedly, Nirvana fans and detractors alike 
will weigh in with their thoughts once it’s made available.

Kraftwerk sued the makers of a mobile device charger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/kraftwerk-sue-makers-of-kraftwerk-charging-devices>

Last week we learned 
<http://preview.gutools.co.uk/music/2015/mar/06/dj-nihal-bbc-radio-silos-haulin-oats-sued-hall-oates-bjork-moma>
 that Hall & Oates were unimpressed with Haulin’ Oats cereal. This week, the 
German electronic act Kraftwerk are at the centre of a copyright wrangle with a 
start-up company based in Dresden that wants to release a product called 
Kraftwerk – which is the German for “power station”.

Waka Flocka Flame cancelled a university frat gig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/university-oklahoma-waka-flocka-flame-cancels-show-racist-song-video>

You’d think that Justin Bieber’s two filmed N-word moments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/01/justin-bieber-n-word-video-racist-joke>
 would have served as a caution for millennials tempted to spout old-fashioned 
racial slurs on camera – alas, not for members of University of Colorado’s 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity chapter. They were shown singing 
jubilantly about lynching black people in a video leaked on Sunday, and the 
footage prompted rapper Waka Flocka Flame to cancel his forthcoming performance 
for the chapter members. The halycon days of SAE frat boys chugging beers with 
Waka Flocka, as shown in the video below, are well and truly over.

Mick Fleetwood said we might need to wait longer for a new album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/fleetwood-mac-album-may-take-a-couple-of-years-to-finish>

Fleetwood Mac <https://www.theguardian.com/music/fleetwood-mac> fans eagerly 
awaiting new recordings would do well to simmer down. Stevie Nicks, according 
to drummer Mick Fleetwood, is in no major rush to work on new material. But 
other band members are writing plenty of new songs, and the band are currently 
on a massive North American tour – the good stuff will come, don’t you worry.

Slipknot guitarist Mick Thomson was stabbed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/12/slipknot-guitarist-mick-thomson-stabbed-in-head-and-hospitalised>

Apparently he’s fine (and very resilient), but was driven to hospital after 
what local news outlet KCCI was describing as an altercation with his brother, 
Andrew Thomson. Mick suffered a stab wound to the back of the head, but Iowa 
police on the scene told Billboard and KCCI that neither sibling’s injuries 
were critical.

Daevid Allen, founder of prog-jazz band Gong, died 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/13/gong-founder-daevid-allen-has-died-aged-77>

Finally, in the week’s sad news, Allen’s son Orlando Monday Allen confirmed 
the guitarist and singer-songwriter’s death on Facebook. Daevid had been 
diagnosed with cancer and hadannounced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/05/gong-founder-daevid-allen-has-six-months-to-live>
 in February that he had been given approximately six months to live.
