The chief of staff for the Motoring Enthusiast party senator, Ricky Muir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ricky-muir>, has reportedly 
resigned only months after she replaced the first person to hold the job.

In August, Muir’s first chief of staff, Glenn Druery, was dismissed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/motoring-enthusiast-ricky-muir-sacks-chief-of-staff-glenn-druery>
 and Sarah Mennie began working for the Victorian politician.

On Friday she resigned, according to the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-24/ricky-muirs-chief-of-staff-quits/5840302>
.

Mennie did not respond to calls on Friday evening. In her voicemail message, 
she says she’s working for Muir.

Less than a week after Druery – known as the “preference whisperer” – was 
dumped as chief of staff another aide, the former NSW politician Peter Breen, 
was also dismissed.

At the time Breen said 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-05/second-senior-staffer-leaves-ricky-muirs-office/5650638>
 he had made an “incident report” to parliament about ruptures between Druery 
and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast party founder, Keith Littler, but didn’t 
go public with the details.

Further comment is being sought.
