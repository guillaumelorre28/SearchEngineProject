Once upon a time, going out in your nightie was a sign that something was 
wrong. But one of fashion’s jobs is to turn a quirk that used to prompt a 
#uokhun text into the trait of a high-functioning alpha woman with Instagram 
followers in their millions.

Nighties are, then, the new pyjamas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/12/fashion-can-you-wear-pyjamas-party-lingerie-jess-cartner-morley>
. If, once, pyjamas were strictly for a) bed, b) the outside of a fashion show 
or c)the school gates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/31/pyjama-blame-school-gate-problem-everyone-is-wearing-them>
, now you’re no longer laughing stock if you wear them beyond those niche 
occasions. Time for fashion to move on, then.Kim Kardashian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian>, Amal Clooney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/amal-alamuddin> and Mariah Carey 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BHluA1Ihtid/?taken-by=mariahcarey&hl=en> have 
rummaged through their drawers and been spotted in their nighties. Or, not 
really – at least not the ones we’re used to. Instead of bobbly oversized 
T-shirts emblazoned with the words “pillow fight”, these are the lacy, satin, 
clingy – and sexy – nighties that are more at home in the wardrobe of a 1930s 
starlet. If simpleslip dresses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/07/the-big-reveal-deconstructing-the-slip-dress>
 are the entry level to bedroom dressing, these are the upgrade.

Kardashian has made such things a bit of a signature. She wore a short, black 
lacy nightie (yours for $60 or £45

while Clooney wore a Dolce & Gabbana satin ’n’ lace dress (veryCarole Lombard

equally super-rich backdrop, on board a yacht in an Italian bay. Other notable

again, at theGivenchy show last September

If this is partly about a new way to rework underwear as outerwear – and add a 
bit of a frisson to centre court – the sexy part of wearing a lacy nightie is 
sort of a footnote for fashion people. They’re far more interested in the 
rebellion associated with wearing something more conventionally seen as a 
behind-closed-doors kind of thing – a rebel yell that dates back, of course, to 
the90s

This is how it was nosed on the catwalk, anyway. Givenchy was a lace-fest – 
but the nightie dresses looked best when mixed with gelled back hair and fierce 
shoes, with wonky hems or a square-cut tailored jacket. Or there’sCéline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/04/paris-fashion-week-celines-art-collaboration-is-a-natural-fit>
 – better known for really nice jumpers than come-hither sexy dresses. Nightie 
dresses here were worn with flat boots and severe, Sade-influenced slicked hair.

It’s the juxtaposition that keeps it classy, San Diego – and that makes it 
about style over seduction. Alexa Chung, a fashion pro in the process ofsetting 
up her own brand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/11/alexa-chung-fashion-line-launching-own-clothing>
, showed her credentials this April. Wearing a bright-pink slipdress, she 
teamed her nightwear not with marabou slippers but with Converse. One glance at 
this picture makes wearing your nightie out of the house suddenly seem like a 
very good idea indeed.
