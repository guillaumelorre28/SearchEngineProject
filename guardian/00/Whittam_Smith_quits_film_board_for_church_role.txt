The Independent's founding editor, Andreas Whittam-Smith, is quitting his job 
as president of the British Board of Film Classification to look after finances 
at the Church of England.

Mr Whittam Smith worked as a financial journalist on the Guardian, the 
Financial Times and the Daily Telegraph before founding the Independent in 1986.

He is credited with taking the paper from the experimental project of a few 
private investors to the first successful broadsheet newspaper launch in years.

In 1997 he succeeded Lord Harewood as president of the BBFC, where he claims 
he has succeeded in making it "an open and accountable organisation with a set 
of guidelines which reflect current public opinion".

During his tenure at the watchdog he reversed his previously sober public 
image with a permissive approach to pornography classification.

And he riled the moral majority and rightwing press with his call for a sex 
shop in every town.
