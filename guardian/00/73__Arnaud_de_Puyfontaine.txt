Arnaud de Puyfontaine <https://www.theguardian.com/media/arnaud-de-puyfontaine>
 is in charge of an enviable stable of magazines from the market-leading Men's 
Health to Good Housekeeping, one of the biggest selling titles in the country 
and his biggest earner.

The UK division of US media giant Hearst Corporation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/07/hearst-magazines-good-housekeeping>
 – previously known as the National Magazine Company, AKA NatMags – also 
includes Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Harper's Bazaar.

The Harvard-educated Frenchman has looked to boost its digital presence – 
underserved when it was NatMags – and oversaw the integration of the Hachette 
Filipacchi division of French publisher Lagardere (including Elle and Red), 
which it bought two years ago. Two titles were closed; another four were sold.

Hearst UK also owns the media and entertainment website Digital Spy and the 
shopping website Handbag.com.

UK chief executive since 2009, de Puyfontaine previously worked at Italian 
media group Mondadori, Emap France and Le Figaro. He was appointed as executive 
vice-president of Hearst Magazines International in 2011, and was also made its 
managing director, western Europe, last month.
