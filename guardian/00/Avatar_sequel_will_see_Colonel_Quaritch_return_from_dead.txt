Quaritch was the no-nonsense head of security for the human organisation 
plundering Pandora's natural resources in James Cameron's 2009 blockbuster 
megalith. The Canadian film-maker is bringingAvatar

2016 and December 2018. Star Sam Worthington, who plays disabled soldier turned 
swashbuckling Na'avi rebel Jake Sully, revealed this week that the first 
instalment will begin shooting in October 2014.

. But he is not the only character returning despite having apparently departed 
this mortal coil last time out. Sigourney Weaver's chain-smoking exobiologist 
Grace Augustine is also coming back in some form for at least one of the 
sequels.

Cameron has lined up screenwriters Josh Friedman (Terminator: The Sarah Connor 
Chronicles), Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and 
Shane Salerno (Shaft, Savages) to help with the scripts for the new films.
