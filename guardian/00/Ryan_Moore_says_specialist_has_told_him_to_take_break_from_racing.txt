Moore has not competitively ridden since Sunday and went on holiday with his 
family to Portugal soon afterwards. In a statement released to Press 
Association Sport, the high-profile jockey said he will only return to the 
saddle when he is fully fit.

Moore said: “I have been a bit sore for the last couple of weeks and been 
advised by a specialist that complete rest is the best option. I’m not going to 
rush it as I want to be 100% for all the major races in the autumn so I’m going 
to play it by ear, but hope to be back soon.”

Moore, 32, would have been expected to ride the Aidan O’Brien-trained 
Caravaggio, ante-post favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas, in the Keeneland 
Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh on Sunday, but Seamie Heffernan will now be in 
the saddle.

York’s big four-day Ebor Festival begins on 17 August, when Minding, whom the 
jockey has ridden to five Group One victories, could run in the Juddmonte 
International Stakes and Darley Yorkshire Oaks.

Speaking at Cork racecourse on Tuesday night, O’Brien said he had been aware 
Moore “was having trouble with a hip”, adding: “I knew that the last while and 
you could see he was lame while he was walking.”
