We have been shadowing the Carnegie medal and are eagerly waiting to hear who 
has won. We’ve been looking back at previous winners to help us guess the 
result. Are there any winners from previous years which are unjustly forgotten 
today?

The announcement of the CILIP Carnegie medal 
<http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/> (which will happen on Monday 20 June 
2016 just after midday) is an important moment in the publishing year. All 
prizes make a difference and the heritage of the Carnegie and the fact that it 
is selected by librarians add to its distinction and prestige.

First awarded in 1936 to Arthur Ransome for Pigeon Post  
<http://arthur-ransome.wikia.com/wiki/Pigeon_Post>it reads like a roll-call of 
the greatest children’s writers for the best part of 100 years. Frequently, 
authors have won for their most enduring title; occasionally it can seem as if 
they were recognised for a later title to make up for having been passed over 
at the right moment.

It is such a distinguished roll-call of titles that have remained in print and 
continue to be read and enjoyed.

Whether those books would always have been regarded as classics or whether 
winning the Carnegie turned them into classics is unknowable. But what of the 
titles not included in this list? The few narrative non-fiction titles such as 
TheRadium Woman by Eleanor Doorly 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Radium_Woman>, 1939, a biography for 
children about the life of Marie Curie,The Story of your Home by Agnes Allen 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Your_Home>, 1949, an historical 
survey of UK domestic architecture from early man living in case to modern 
blocks of flats andThe Making of Man by IW Cornwall, 
<http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/archive-title.php?id=97> 1960, a book 
about evolution. All have all been superseded by newer titles.

In fiction, the Carnegie lists reflects changing patterns and, in general, 
higher expectations of readers by writers. Richard Armstrong’sSea Change 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Change_(Armstrong_novel)>, 1948, a bustling 
sea faring adventure aimed squarely at boy readers, now feels old fashioned in 
both content and style whileThe Exeter Blitz  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exeter_Blitz>by David Rees, 1978, a gently 
exciting story about the bombing of Exeter in the second world war, just seems 
rather too tame for today’s readers. While historical fiction, so successful 
and popular in the 1950s and 1960s and represented by titles such asThe Woolpack
 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wool-Pack> by Cynthia Harnett, 1951, Knight 
Crusader <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Crusader> by Ronald Welch, 1954 
andTime of Trial <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_Trial> by Hester 
Burton, 1963 has struggled to keep its place in the market; fantasy has mostly 
fared much better.

But even within fantasy there are exceptions. The Twelve and the Genii  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_and_the_Genii>by Pauline Clarke, 
1962, is a clever and gripping fantasy which centres on the set of toy soldiers 
belonging to the Bronte children which, when rediscovered by modern children, 
lead to an adventure which blurs contemporary life with the world of the Bronte 
children. Attempts to bring the title back by republishing have been only 
marginally successful.

The God Beneath the Sea <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Beneath_the_Sea>
, 1970, by Leon Garfield and Edward Blishen is a stunning collection of 
retellings of the Greek myths illustrated by Charles Keeping. It is timeless in 
all ways but as more retellings of the same myths come along it is no longerthe 
title to have on the shelf. While all prize lists also have anomalies within 
them, the Carnegie medal list is a valuable guide to some of the best books 
from the past and to the ways in which fashions of reading change.
