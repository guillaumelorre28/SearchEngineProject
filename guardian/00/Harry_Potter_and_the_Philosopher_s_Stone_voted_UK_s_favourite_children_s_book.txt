He "captured the imaginations of a generation of readers" and now Harry Potter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter> and the Philosopher's Stone has 
been chosen as the nation's favourite children's book, with The Hunger Games by 
Suzanne Collins in second place and The BFG by Roald Dahl at number three.

More than 24,000 readers voted for their favourite from the 100 best books to 
read before you're 14 <http://www.booktrust.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/222/> 
list, covering books from the past century, which was compiled by the 
children's reading charity Booktrust. The list was split into four groups of 25 
books for varying age ranges.

The Very Hungry Caterpillar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/22/booksforchildrenandteenagers> 
came top in the 0-5 age group, and Roald Dahl's The BFG won the 6-8 year group. 
The two most popular books overall, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 
and The Hunger Games, won in the 9-11 and the 12-14 categories respectively.

While classic storytelling won out with younger readers, film franchises 
appeared to have influenced the older age groups – nine of the books in the top 
10 have been adapted for cinema.

"Harry Potter has captured the imaginations of a generation of readers who 
have grown up in love with Harry or Hermione, want to be friends with Ron, and 
are truly terrified by Voldemort," said Booktrust's head of arts, Claire 
Shanahan. "Even when up against heavyweights such as Dahl and Tolkien, 
Rowling's creation remains the nation's firm favourite."

Booktrust's criteria when compiling the list of 100 best books were great 
stories, high-quality writing and illustration, popularity, the book's capacity 
for broadening readers' horizons, innovation and originality – and standing the 
test of time.

The list of 25 best books for 0-5 year-olds 
<http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/children/booklists/241/> includes I Will Not 
Ever Never Eat a Tomato by Lauren Child, and Judith Kerr's The Tiger Who Came 
to Tea; while The Arrival by Shaun Tan and Asterix the Gaul by René Goscinny 
are among the25 best books for 6-8 year olds 
<http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/children/booklists/242/>.

The 9-11 year-old list includes 
<http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/children/booklists/243/> Millions by Frank 
Cottrell Boyce, Stig of the Dump by Clive King and Michael Morpurgo's Private 
Peaceful; and inthe 12-14 year old age range 
<http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/teenagers/booklists/244/> are titles such as 
Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book and Philip Pullman's Northern Lights.

Booktrust also asked readers which books were missing, and has listed those 
that "didn't make our final cut, but thatyou told us were your favourites 
<http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/children/booklists/253/>".
