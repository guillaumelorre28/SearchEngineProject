 two British backpackers on Koh Tao island.

The cyber activist group posted links to 15 Thai police websites, including 
the Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau, and published several Thai police email 
addresses, asking its members to hack them.

On Wednesday, seven of the websites were down and two links showed a black 
screen with “Failed Law. We want Justice. #BoycottThailand” written in white 
text.

The links also showed <http://technology.sochoto.police.go.th/south/> 
Anonymous’s signature mask, a white stylised Guy Fawkes face, under text saying 
“Blink hacker group”. Anonymous is a loose international network and works with 
multiple hacking organisations.

The case drew the attention of rights groups who warned that migrants had 
previously been falsely accused of crimes in Thailand. The pair initially 
confessed to the murder but laterrescinded their statements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/thailand-backpacker-murders-suspects-confession-retract>
, saying they had been tortured by police to admit to the brutal beach attack.

The police, who deny any wrongdoing, were also accused by the defence team of 
mishandling crucial DNA evidence.

In a 37-minute video 
<https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=567635633385675&theater> posted on its 
Facebook page, Anonymous said the Thai police “would rather blame foreigners or 
migrants for such crimes so as to protect their tourism industry than accuse 
their own Thai locals, that may deter tourists from choosing Thailand as their 
holiday destination”.

It cited past murder cases in Thailand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/thailand> involving foreigners in which Thai 
police first accused non-Thais who were later acquitted.

“Anonymous has found that Thai police, lie, fabricate evidence, do poor police 
investigating, contaminate crime scenes, loose DNA and evidence, accuse 
non-Thai nationals” and “refuse to believe that their own Thai locals are 
responsible for any wrongdoing”, a masked figure said in the video.

“We do not like the facts in this recent Koh Tao case and we do not believe 
the Thai court has convicted the actual murderers,” the figure said, speaking 
in a digitised voice.

It added that Anonymous <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous> 
dissuades foreigners from visiting the south-east Asian nation until “Thai 
police make many changes in the way they handle rape and murder cases involving 
foreigners or migrants and show more respect to deceased victims.”

Police spokesman Dechnarong Suticharnbancha told the local Khaosod 
<http://www.khaosodenglish.com/detail.php?newsid=1451976348&typecate=06&section>
 news website that the police were working to track down the hackers.

“Even if the source of attack was from abroad, they will be convicted 
eventually,” he said. “It’s not a problem. Thai police are excellent.”

The defence team plans to apply to the appeals court to commute the sentence 
and, if they are unsuccessful, can take their case to the supreme court. The 
verdict sparked protests outside the Thai embassy in the Myanmar city of Yangon.

Miller’s family said after the sentencing they believed the police 
investigation and forensic work “was not the so-called shambles it was made out 
to be” and said justice was delivered.

The Witheridge family neither supported nor condemned the sentencing. They 
said in a statement at the time: “We have had to endure a lot of painful and 
confusing information. We now need time, as a family, to digest the outcome of 
the trial and figure out the most appropriate way to tell our story.”
