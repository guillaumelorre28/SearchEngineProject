Hello guzzlers,

Martin Gardner, who wrote dozens of books of recreational mathematics, would 
have been 102 last Friday. In the years since he died, his friends and fans 
have started a global movement calledCelebration of Mind 
<http://www.celebrationofmind.org/wordpress_site/>, which encourages people to 
put on puzzle-themed events on or around the date of his birthday.

Please celebrate your minds right now by attempting these two gems from 
Gardner’s archive. One is straightforward. The other may take you a little 
longer.

1. At the hardware store, you are told that 1 will cost you 50p, 12 will cost 
£1 and the price of 144 is £1.50. What are you buying?


2. Reconstruct the following long division:

This is the long division of an eight digit number by a three digit number. 
All the digits in both numbers - and the workings out - have been replaced by 
Xs. Not only do you need to work out what digits the Xs are, you also need to 
calculate the answer, which is a five digit number with the 8 in its third 
position.

The puzzle was one of Gardner’s favourites. When I first came across it I was 
also spellbound - it didn’t seem there was enough information to fill in the 
Xs. Once you remember how long divisions work, however, a few insights will 
lead you to the unique solution. Gardner wrote that the puzzle first appeared 
in 1954 in theAmerican Mathematical Monthly, and was its most popular problem 
ever. It still rocks 62 years later.

I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the answers.
