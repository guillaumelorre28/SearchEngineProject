Sows (female pigs) are difficult to milk. They are grumpy and don't like to be 
touched, plus their teats are much smaller than a cow's, so it's harder to get 
milk from them. They also produce less milk than a cow. For all these reasons, 
there has never been a culture of milking pigs.

The other reason is because of coagulation, which is the process of turning 
milk (a liquid) into cheese (a solid). Pigs' milk does not coagulate, it stays 
runny, so it is impossible to turn it into cheese.

A group of clever people from Oxford University once tried to make cheese from 
human milk. To make cheese, you have to add rennet, an enzyme made from the 
stomach lining of the animal you are making the cheese from. Not only does 
human milk not coagulate, but you would have to use human stomach lining to 
make it, and no one would want to eat that!
