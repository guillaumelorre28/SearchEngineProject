As we all now know, a referendum will be held on 23 June to determine whether 
the United Kingdom remains part of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. Many commentators and politicians 
believe this to be the single most significant decision the British public will 
have made since we backed continued membership of the European Economic 
Community in 1975. However, despite the huge importance of the impending vote, 
just 31% of the population identify Britain’s membership of/relationship with 
the EU as one of the three most important issues currently affecting the UK. 
Furthermore, only 23% believe it is one of the most important issues affecting 
them personally.


It is a much more significant issue in the eyes of those who back Brexit (50% 
of whom select it as a major issue) than those who wish to remain in the EU 
(15%) and it is an issue that increases in importance with age; just 12% of 
25-34-year-olds say it’s a big issue compared with 53% of those aged 65 or 
over. There are sizable differences on the basis of political party 
affiliation; Ukip supporters are, predictably, most likely to considerEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> to be an issue of great 
national importance (59% do) and the same is true of 40% of Conservative 
supporters.

However, just 15% of Labour supporters and 9% of Lib Dem supporters concur. 
There are also interesting regional variations; while Londoners are the least 
likely to identify Europe as an important national issue (16%), Britons living 
in the rest of the south-east are the most likely to deem it important (43%).

EU membership is not widely perceived to be an important national issue, but 
immigration is. The results of our poll suggest the issues are indivisible for 
many. Concerns around immigration are often more theoretical than personal (55% 
say it is a big issue affecting the country while just 25% say it is a big 
issue affecting them personally) but it could well be the issue that, above all 
others, determines the referendum outcome.

EU referendum pie chart 2 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-11T15:01:26.html> 
Our poll was conducted just prior to the conclusion of David Cameron’s 
negotiations with our EU partners, before the referendum date was confirmed. 
Numerous polls have subsequently been conducted with the intention of 
predicting the outcome and it’s possible that public sentiment will have 
changed to some degree in the intervening period. We present these numbers, 
therefore, not as a prediction but because the answers are frequently used as a 
lens through which to analyse responses to other questions in the survey.

With the point about poll timing in mind, there are some clear demographic 
patterns in voting intentions. Most strikingly, Euroscepticism is closely 
correlated with age, so that younger Britons are more likely to vote to remain 
in the EU while older Britons are more likely to favour Brexit.

There is also evidence to suggest that, at the time of polling, the momentum 
was towards leaving. Of those questioned, 38% said they had changed their views 
on the issue over the previous six months, a time frame that included the Paris 
terror attacks, the worsening refugee crisis and the mass sexual assaults in 
Cologne on New Year’s Eve; 22% were now more likely than they were to vote to 
leave while 16% said the opposite.

Both genders and each age group over the age of 35 had become more likely to 
vote to leave over the previous six months. The fluidity of public opinion 
raises the possibility that unforeseen events could contribute significantly to 
the final result.

If a referendum were held tomorrow on the following question, how likely would 
you be to vote? Please answer using the scale 0-10 where 0 is “definitely
wouldn’t vote”, 5 is “might vote” and 10 is “definitely would vote”.
“Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the 
European Union?”
0 (definitely wouldn’t vote) 2%
1 1%
2 1%
3 0%

EU: good thing or bad? 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-11T15:51:34.html> 
In the context of a tight race, the ability of each side to mobilise its 
supporters on polling day is likely to be crucial. In this respect, the older 
age profile of Brexit supporters becomes a strong advantage; 88% of those aged 
65-plus say they will definitely vote compared with just 34% of 18-24s and 39% 
of 25-34s. Furthermore, 76% of Leave supporters say they will definitely vote 
compared with 59% of Remain supporters. There could be sizable regional 
variations in turnout; Londoners, who are more likely to vote to remain, will 
need the most persuading (45% will definitely vote). In contrast, 72% of those 
in the remainder of the south-east, who are more likely to be Leave supporters, 
will definitely vote.

With the race neck and neck, it would be reasonable to expect national 
sentiment to be similarly split over the question of whether EU membership is 
generally a good or bad thing for Britain. However, those who believe that EU 
membership is good for Britain (47%) outnumber those who believe it is bad 
(35%) by a significant margin. Lib Dem and Green party supporters are most 
likely to consider it good (85% each) and a large majority (70%) of Labour 
supporters concur.

Significantly, Conservative voters are also much more likely to believe that 
membership is good rather than bad. While the pattern is predictably reversed 
among Ukip supporters (83% believe membership is bad) these numbers raise the 
question of why the Remain camp doesn’t have a comfortable lead. Explaining the 
dissonance may be crucial to determining the outcome.
Issues affecting voting intentions

Issues affecting voting intentions

Immigration is, by some distance, the issue most likely to affect how Britons 
will vote in the referendum; 49% say it will influence how they vote, and this 
figure increases to 72% among those who will vote to leave. It is not, however, 
the main issue among Remain supporters, who are more likely to cite both 
international trade (35%) and the state of the UK economy (34%). Among those 
favouring Brexit, the issues affecting voting behaviour are heavily 
concentrated around immigration and how the EU is run/who runs the EU. In 
contrast, the issues driving Remain supporters are more diffuse, potentially 
making it harder to solidify support around consistent messages.

One issue likely to feature prominently in the campaign is the proportion of 
UK laws passed each year that originate from European institutions. WhenNick 
Clegg and Nigel Farage debated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/02/nigel-farage-triumphs-over-nick-clegg-second-debate>
 prior to the 2014 European elections, their estimates diverged wildly; Clegg 
said 7% while Farage insisted the real figure was 75%. The British public 
didn’t know who to believe and asked to estimate themselves, they come up with 
an average figure (40%) almost exactly halfway between the Clegg and Farage 
estimates. Ukip supporters estimate the figure to be 52%, still way short of 
theFarage’s number proposed by their leader. Leave supporters estimate 48% 
while Remain supporters suggest 29%. The reality? Well, the House of Commons 
Library puts the figure atapproximately 13% 
<http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07092#fullreport>
, while research by the Eurosceptic campaign group Business for Britain and 
published last year claimed it was nearly 65% 
<http://businessforbritain.org/2015/03/02/definitive-study-reveals-eu-rules-account-for-65-of-uk-law/>
. This debate is likely to run and run.
Personal finances 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-11T16:42:16.html> 
Finances and economics 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-18T12:34:47.html> 
The campaign battle lines may well be drawn along these lines; the Leave 
campaign focusing on concerns around immigration and the Remain camp countering 
with reminders of the economic risks associated with Brexit. If that’s what 
transpires, it will be of concern to the Remain camp that more Britons believe 
Brexit would be good for their personal finances (38%) than believe it would be 
bad (30%). Among Eurosceptics, 62% believe Brexit would be good for their 
personal finances and even 20% of those favouring the status quo agree. There 
is a clear gender divide: while women are evenly split, men are significantly 
more likely to believe the impact would be positive (43%) rather than negative 
(29%).

Britons may be relaxed about the impact of Brexit on their personal finances, 
but it is also a commonly held view that Britain needs to be part of a European 
trading bloc; 54% agree while just 14% disagree. Eurosceptics generally are, 
marginally, in agreement (34% versus 29%) although Ukip supporters specifically 
are more likely to disagree (35% versus 27%). There is also cautious national 
approval given to the view that “the rise of China and other countries means 
Britain needs to be in the EU to compete in the world” (41% of respondents 
agree, 32% disagree) although Eurosceptics strongly reject this notion (61% 
disagree, 14% agree). Concerns about the health of the euro offset the 
potential for membership to be considered economically positive; 68% of Britons 
agree that the debt crisis has made them question the currency’s stability and 
while these concerns are most pronounced among Leave supporters (82% agree) 
they are common across the political spectrum. The extent to which fear of 
domestic contagion from the eurozone debt crisis is driving Euroscepticism is, 
however, unclear.
Cross-EU migration 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-12T18:23:47.html> 
Immigration 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-18T12:36:03.html> 
Recent analysis suggests that George Osborne will only be able to deliver his 
economic target of a budget surplus by 2019/2020 if the number of immigrants 
coming to the UK exceeds current levels. Assuming this is true, would you 
prefer…?

To increase current levels of immigration from the EU so that UK can hit 
economic targets21%

Maintain or reduce current levels of immigration and miss economic targets 78%




Would you say that you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?



The effects of immigration now outweigh any trade benefits the EU brings
Agree 54% Disagree 21%


Immigration from the EU has benefited the wealthy in this country at the 
expense of the poorest
Agree 46% Disagree 21%

44% of Britons believe that the right of EU citizens to live, work or retire 
in any member state is bad for Britain while 32% believe it is good. Among 
those favouring Brexit, 69% believe free movement is bad for the country and 
17% of Remain supporters agree. Immigration from the EU is most likely to be 
seen as a good thing in London, the most culturally diverse region, (56%) and 
most likely to be seen as a bad thing in Wales (66%).

EU immigration is considered to have had a net negative impact on every area 
of national life in Britain with the exception of cultural diversity and 
richness. Negativity is most pronounced around housing, where 65% consider the 
impact bad and just 11% good (-54). Other areas where the impact is seen as 
strongly negative include welfare/benefits (-50), the population level in the 
UK (-49) and crime (-44). Even those who wish the UK to remain in the EU are 
more likely to consider the impact of immigration on these areas negative.

Concerns are so widespread that if the campaign narrative is reduced to 
immigration versus economics, there is evidence to suggest the immigration 
argument will have greater resonance. Firstly, a majority of Britons (54%) 
agree with the view that “the effects of immigration now outweigh any trade 
benefits the EU brings” (21% disagree). Furthermore, 78% of Britons say they 
would prefer George Osborne to miss his economic target of a budget surplus by 
2019/20 if this meant,as recent analysis has suggested 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/01/osborne-reliant-on-rising-immigration-levels-to-achieve-budget-surplus>
, that the number of immigrants coming to the UK would need to exceed current 
levels. Even 58% of Europhiles would prefer to miss those economic targets if 
they required increased immigration. Of course, it’s entirely possible that 
some may wish Osborne to miss his budget targets for reasons completely 
unrelated to immigration.

In the context of dealing with immigration, to what extent would you support 
or oppose each of the following policies?
We should make it a legal requirement for those applying to settle in the UK 
to speak better English and pass a “Life in the UK” test.
Support 78% Oppose 8%

Immigrants must financially support themselves and their dependants for four 
years (private health insurance, private education and private housing) before 
being able to access welfare/benefits.
Support 74% Oppose 12%

The government should impose annual limits on UK immigration from the EU.
Support 73% Oppose 12%

We should limit the right of European citizens to work in the UK.
Support 53% Oppose 26%

There should be a European standing army made up of personnel from each 
European Union country.
Support 39% Oppose 26%

David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> placed the 
need to curb rates of EU immigration at the heart of his membership 
renegotiations and, with this in mind, sought to deny all EU migrants in-work 
benefits for an initial four-year period. There is strong national support for 
this policy. Indeed, 74% believe that EU migrants must support themselves and 
their families for four years before being able to access any welfare or 
benefits. In addition, 78% of Britons believe it should be a legal requirement 
for those applying to settle in the UK to speak better English and pass a “Life 
in the UK” test, and 73% would like to see annual limits on immigration from 
the EU. There is almost complete support for each of these policies among those 
favouring Brexit. However, a clear majority of Remain supporters concur.

It remains to be seen if the deal secured by Cameron (an “emergency handbrake” 
that limits in-work benefits for four years for newly arrived EU migrants, but 
not for those already in the country) is sufficient to deal with domestic 
concerns round immigration.
The refugee crisis 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-18T12:40:37.html> The 
refugee crisis 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-18T12:42:02.html> 
With large numbers fleeing civil war and unrest in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, 
Eritrea and elsewhere, the refugee crisis is the single biggest issue facing 
the EU right now. Britons are most likely to believe the best way to deal with 
this humanitarian crisis, unprecedented in modern times, is via a joint EU 
operation in which all member states have an obligation to take part. 38% 
support this course of action and the number increases to 52% among those who 
wish to remain in the EU. Politically, popularity for this approach is most 
pronounced among Labour supporters (50%) but it’s the preferred course of 
action among supporters of each mainstream party with the exception of Ukip, 
whose supporters believe that each country should respond in their own way, 
with no central co-ordination or organisation. The preferred approach among 
Eurosceptics generally, however, is for every country to respond in their own 
way with the EU helping to co-ordinate efforts but with no power to direct 
things.

The nation is split over whether it’s better to band together with other 
countries to tackle the issues facing the world or whether we should pull up 
the drawbridge and adopt an isolationist approach in an attempt to insulate 
Britain from danger. Slightly more Britons believe “the world is a dangerous 
place and that countries need to protect their borders first and foremost 
before worrying about how to tackle international crises” (54% support this 
view and the figure rises to, 75% among those who wish to leave the EU).

A smaller proportion (46%) believe that “some problems are bigger than 
nation-states and show that we need greater co-operation and co-ordination 
between countries to deal with them”. Support for this more collaborative view 
rises to 68% among those who wish to stay in the EU. Age tended to determine 
response, with Britons becoming increasingly isolationist over time. Men are 
also significantly more likely to be isolationist (58% are) than collaborative 
(42%) while women are evenly split.

Would you say that being a member of the EU makes it more or less likely that 
Britain will go to war in the future?
Much more likely 12% More likely 24% No effect 45% Less likely 15% Much less 
likely5%
TOTAL: More likely 35%


TOTAL: Less likely 19%

Concerns about national security are widespread in these turbulent times, and 
the ability of EU membership to increase security is not widely recognised. 
Indeed, more Britons believe membership of the EU makes Britain less safe (39%) 
than more safe (30%). Why? Maybe the perception that immigration from the EU 
has caused a rise in crime contributes? For 35% of Britons it may be related to 
a belief that EU membership makes it more likely that Britain will go to war in 
future (just 19% believe membership makes it less likely). Whatever the reason, 
the sense that Britain is less safe as a result of EU membership is 
particularly pronounced among women, 41% of whom believe we are less safe 
compared with 24% who feel we are more safe. Furthermore, every age group over 
35 is more likely to believe membership makes Britain less safe. Londoners are 
most likely to believe that membership makes Britain safer (59%) while those 
living in Yorkshire & Humberside and the south-east are most likely to believe 
the opposite (52% and 51% respectively).
European leaders 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-18T12:38:29.html> 
And which of the following EU leaders would you say is the most powerful?

Angela Merkel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel> 79%
David Cameron 8%
Jean-Claude Juncker 5%
François Hollande 3%
Donald Tusk 2%
Mariano Rajoy 1%
Martin Schulz 1%
Alexis Tsipras 1%
Enda Kenny 0%
Matteo Renzi 0%
Andrzej Duda 0%

79% of Britons believe German chancellor Angela Merkel is the most powerful EU 
leader whilst, in second place, just 8% consider David Cameron most powerful. 
Even among Conservative supporters, just 8% believe Cameron is the most 
powerful EU leader. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission 
languishes in third place in the power hierarchy (5% believe he wields most 
power). However, 50% of Britons have never heard of Juncker, even when 
prompted. Even fewer have heard of Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras (31%), 
president of the European Council Donald Tusk (30%), president of the European 
Parliament Martin Schulz (19%), former Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny (19%),who 
recently resigned and is yet to be replaced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/enda-kenny-taoiseach-ireland-parliament>
, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi (12%), prime minister of Spain Mariano 
Rajoy (9%), or president of Poland Andrzej Duda (7%). Excluding David Cameron, 
the most well-known European leaders are, unsurprisingly, Angel Merkel and 
François Hollande. However, a significant minority of Britons have not heard of 
them either (25% and 36% respectively). There is little difference between 
camps in terms of leader awareness; Remain supporters have heard of 3.4 of the 
listed leaders on average, Leave supporters 3.2. Awareness is lowest among 
18-24s (1.7 on average) and it is a minority of 18-24s who have heard of each 
leader (Merkel is top with 47% awareness). Men (3.6) have heard of more than 
women (2.7) and Conservative supporters (3.9) have heard of more than Labour 
(2.7) Lib Dem (2.9) or Ukip (3.4) supporters. Awareness peaks in the capital 
where the average Londoner has heard of 4.2 of these EU leaders.


Most EU countries (but not Britain) are part of the Schengen area, where 
countries do not police their borders with other countries in the zone. This 
means that it is possible to drive from Portugal to Poland without having to 
show your passport. In your opinion, is this generally a good thing or a bad 
thing?
Very good thing 11% Good 12%Neither good nor bad 16%Bad 26%Very bad thing 35%
TOTAL: Good 23%
TOTAL: Bad 61%

As the refugee crisis worsens, the possibility of reintroducing internal 
border controls and restricting free movement between 26 EU member states in 
the Schengen area (the designated area in which member countries do not police 
their borders with other countries in the zone) is being actively debated. A 
number of countries in the zone have already temporarily reintroduced border 
controls. Britain is not part of the Schengen area and its suspension would 
have little direct impact on the UK. However, with many UK media brands 
publishing stories suggesting the lack of border controls enables the free 
movement of potential terrorists, the end of the Schengen area may help to 
allay some security fears relating to EU membership. A clear majority of 
Britons (61%) certainly believe the Schengen zone is a bad thing while only 23% 
believe it is good. Those who wish to remain in the EU are evenly split (39% 
apiece) in their attitudes but 79% of those in favour of Brexit believe the 
zone is bad. 18-34s are the only demographic group more likely to believe the 
zone is a good thing rather than a bad thing.
Identity 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-12T21:41:24.html> 
In which country were you born?
The UK (including British overseas territories and dependencies) 85%
Another country that is now a member of the European Union 8%
Another European country that is not a member of the European Union 2%
Another country outside Europe 5%

Which, if any, of the following words would you use to describe yourself?
British 58%
English 49%
European 15%
Scottish 7%
Regional term (eg northerner, southerner, Highlander) 7%
City/county specific term (eg Londoner, Yorkshireman, Glaswegian, Geordie, 
Mancunian, Scouser)7%
Irish/Northern Irish 4%
Welsh 4%
Local area/town-specific term 3%

85% of those who completed our poll were born in the UK, including British 
overseas territories and dependencies. This figure reduces markedly (to 75%) 
among 18-24s and in London the figure is 76%. Interestingly, 10% of Ukip 
supporters were born either in another country that is now a member of the EU 
(8%) or another European country that is not a member of the EU (2%).

Just 15% of Britons describe themselves as European and only 7% say it is the 
word they would most likely use to describe themselves. Self-identification as 
“European” peaks among younger Britons (23% of 18-24s and 31% of 25-34s), a 
function, to some extent, of the higher proportion of these age groups born in 
another EU country. However, it does suggest that, if we remain in the EU, 
Britons will become increasingly likely to identify themselves as European. In 
London, where diversity is greatest, nearly half (44%) already describe 
themselves in these terms. It’s interesting to speculate why only an arguably 
small proportion (27%) of those who will vote to remain in the EU describe 
themselves as European? Is their stance pragmatic rather than passionate?

Language seems to be an important factor in determining self-identification as 
European, as an ability to fluently speak a second European language increases 
the likelihood markedly. It’s also correlated with voting intentions; 33% of 
those who will vote to remain can speak another European language fluently 
while the same is true for just 20% of those who will vote to leave.

Holidays and residence preferences

Which, if any, of the following countries have you visited for a holiday in 
the past five years?

None of these 34%
Spain 32%
France 30%
Italy 18%
Germany 13%
Greece 12%
Belgium 11%

None of these 34%

The nation may be divided over EU membership, but we certainly still enjoy 
European holidays; 66% of Britons have taken a holiday in an EU country other 
than the UK in the past five years. The most popular destinations are 
Spain≈(32% have visited) and France (30%) followed by Italy (18%) and Germany 
(13%). Remain supporters are more likely than Leave supporters to have visited 
an EU country on holiday (77% and 62% respectively) and the favoured 
destinations of the two camps differ; those favouring Brexit are most likely to 
have visited Spain while Remain supporters are more likely to visit France.

Residence 2 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-12T21:46:09.html> 
Bearing in mind it’s the nation’s favourite holiday destination and also has a 
large British expat population, it’s unsurprising that Spain is also the EU 
country that, other than the UK, we would most like to live in. Spain is the 
most popular country of residence for both genders and for every age group 
above 25. However, among 18-24s, Italy is almost twice as popular (20% to 
Spain’s 11%). Italy is also the most popular choice among Londoners (14%) while 
Spain is less popular in the capital than elsewhere in the country; it ranks 
sixth among Londoners behind Italy, Austria, France, Germany and Sweden.

There’s a clear winner when it comes to the EU country where Britons would 
least like to live: Romania. 25% identify it as the country they would least 
like to live in, while the three nearest challengers (Bulgaria, Lithuania and 
Poland) were selected by a combined 21% (7% each). Romania is the least popular 
among Britons of both genders and all ages, with the exception of 18-24s who 
are slightly more likely to dislike living in Poland (15% v 14%).

Do you have any close friends who were born in any of the following countries?
Ireland, France 10% each
Germany 8%
Poland 7%
Italy, Belgium 6% each
Spain, Austria, Croatia, Denmark 5% each
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, Greece 4% each

Partners 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2016-03-12T21:47:25.html> 
More than half of Britons (59%) do not have close friends born in an EU 
country outside the UK. Those who do are most likely to have Irish friends (10% 
of Britons have a close friend from Ireland), French (10%), German (8%) or 
Polish (7%). 57% of 25-34s and 51% of 18-24s have close friends from other EU 
countries compared with 30% of those aged 65. Londoners are most likely to have 
EU friends (73% do) while those living in the East Midlands are least likely 
(23%). Perhaps predictably, 54% of Remain supporters have friends from other EU 
countries compared with 34% of those who wish to leave. Liberal Democrats are 
most likely to speak other European languages fluently, so perhaps it’s not 
surprising that they’re also most likely to have European friends (62% do).

Friendships are significantly more common than relationships; 41% of Britons 
have a close friend from another EU country while 15% have had a relationship 
with someone from a different EU country. Men are more likely than women to 
have done so (18% and 11% respectively). Perhaps more surprising is that Ukip 
supporters are more likely than Labour supporters to have done so (14% and 11% 
respectively). Less surprising is that Lib Dems are the most likely to have had 
an EU relationship (22%) and less surprising still is that incidences of these 
relationships peak in London, where more than half (51%) have had a 
relationship with someone from another EU country.

Approximately how many UK nationals do you think live in other EU countries? 
For reference, the total population of the UK is 64.1 million while the total 
population of all EU countries (including UK) is 503 million.

More than 5 million4%
Average estimate 1.48 million

On average, Britons estimate that 28% of the UK population were born in other 
EU countries. If true, that would equate to 18 million people, of whom we 
believe Poles and Romanians form the largest proportion. Estimates of the EU 
immigrant population peak in the West Midlands, where the average estimate is 
34%. Ukip and Leave supporters both estimate 32% while the estimate of Remain 
supporters is not much lower (25%). The reality? Office for National Statistics 
figures for year ending December 2014 show that 8.3 million UK residents, 13% 
of the total population, were born abroad. However, only 3 million of those 
were born in an EU country so the real figure is less than 5%.

Asked to estimate how many UK nationals live in other EU countries, the 
average answer was 1.48 million. According to figures used in a government 
response to a parliamentary question by Matthew Oakeshott in 2014, the real 
figure is 2.2 million. There are just over 1 million Britons living in Spain, 
330,000 in France, 329,000 in Ireland, 107,000 in Germany, 65,000 in Cyprus, 
48,000 in the Netherlands, 45,000 in Greece, 39,000 in Portugal and 37,000 in 
Italy.

Which EU nation do you believe…


…drinks the most per person?(All answers below show the top five selected.)
United Kingdom 33% France 15% Germany 14% Ireland 7% Czech Republic 4%

…smokes the most per person?
France 19% UK 12% Greece 8% Spain 7% Germany 6%

…takes the most drugs per person?
UK 32% Netherlands 23% Denmark 4% Czech Republic 4% Estonia 4%

Britons believe that the UK is the EU nation that drinks the most per person. 
Both genders and every age group are most likely to believe this. The reality 
is different. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) figures published in 
2014, the average Briton consumed 11.6 litres of pure alcohol in 2010. This 
places us well behind the likes of Lithuania (15.4 litres) Romania (14.4) and 
Hungary (13.3). Our poll also reveals that the UK is considered to be the EU 
nation that takes the most illegal drugs per person. Data from the 2015European 
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction 
<http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries>(EMCDDA) shows that cannabis is the most 
widely used illegal drug in Europe, used by more than 80 million at least once 
in their life. Prevalence of cannabis use is highest in Spain, where 9.4% of 
the adult population have tried it at least once. The second most widely used 
illegal drug in Europe is cocaine and prevalence of use does indeed peak in the 
UK, where 2.4% have tried it. Ecstasy use also peaks in the UK (1.6% have tried 
it). France is believed to be the country that smokes the most per person but 
WHO figures from 2013 show that rates of cigarette smoking actually peak in 
Greece, where 36.5% of adults smoke cigarettes. That’s compared with 22.8% of 
French adults, while in the UK this figure drops further, to 20.3%.

…has the longest life expectancy?
Sweden 19% Italy 15% Germany 8% United Kingdom 7% Greece 6%

…has the shortest life expectancy?
Romania 21% Bulgaria 11% United Kingdom 9% Estonia 7% Croatia 6%

Britons believe that life expectancy is longest in Sweden, Italy and Germany 
and shortest in Romania, Bulgaria and the UK itself. Again, these perceptions 
differ from reality. According to Eurostat statistics for 2013 Spain has the 
longest life expectancy among the 28 EU nations (83.3) while Latvia and 
Bulgaria have the shortest life expectancies (74.5). As for the UK, life 
expectancy currently stands at 81.4, 79.5 for men, 83.2 for women.

…is the wealthiest?
Germany 48% United Kingdom 12% Sweden 8% Luxembourg 7% Austria 3%

…is the poorest?
Romania 23% Greece 14% Bulgaria 10% Latvia 8% Lithuania 8%

Nearly half of all Britons (48%) believe that Germany is the wealthiest nation 
within the union. There are different ways of calculating wealth and if we base 
our assessment on gross domestic product (GDP) then Germany is indeed the 
wealthiest, with the UK second. However, a more accurate measure of wealth is 
probably GDP per capita. Eurostat figures show that Luxembourg has, by a 
distance, the highest GDP per capita, more than two-and-a-half times the EU 28 
average. Ireland has the second highest GDP per capita (34% above EU 28 
average) followed by the Netherlands and Austria (both about 30% above the 
average). Britons believe that Romania and Greece are the poorest EU nations 
but it is actually Bulgaria that has the lowest GDP per capita within the EU 28 
(53% below the average). Croatia and Romania are the next poorest EU nations 
based on this metric.

…has the fastest growing economy?
United Kingdom 34% Germany 25% Denmark 3% Ireland 3% Sweden 3%

Britons believe that we have the fastest growing economy within the union. 
However,Eurostat figures 
<http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Real_GDP_growth,_2004%E2%80%9314_(%25_change_compared_with_the_previous_year;_average_2004%E2%80%9314)_YB15.png>
 providing a year-on-year GDP comparison show Ireland at the top of the growth 
table with a growth rate of 4.8%, while Hungary was second with a rate of 3.6%. 
Growth in Britain, in comparison, was 2.8%.

Methodology
Opinium Research interviewed a sample of 1,033 UK adults aged 18-plus. 
Interviews were conducted using an online panel and results have been weighted 
so that they are demographically representative of the total UK adult 
population.
