Having flirted with life on the mainstream, the curators of this particular 
event from ATP - the people who took sociopathic indie rock to its natural 
home, the seaside holiday camp - are enjoying life on the margins. Here, 
ex-Faith No More man Mike Patton, now a record label entrepreneur and frontman 
of several avant garde, low-key bands, joins the Melvins, fleetingly referenced 
as "godfathers of grunge" in the early-90s, to pay homage to both the worlds of 
heavy guitar music and more experimental disciplines. An exciting mixed bag 
includes a performance of Stockhausen's Kontakte and shows by the Damned and 
Butthole Surfers.
