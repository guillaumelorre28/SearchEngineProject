When Sarah Burton unveiled her McQueen collection at London Fashion Week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/21/sarah-burton-brings-alexander-mcqueen-show-london>
, the highlight was the otherworldly unicorn dress: whimsical and theatrical, 
it looked like it was made for a production of Midsummer Night’s Dream. A few 
days later, the Oscars red carpet suggested a bunch of LA stylists had been 
binge-watching the Disney channel. Stylistic nods were all around, most notably 
fromAlicia Vikander

 dressed like a double of Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

More recently, Vetements unveiled their glitter unicorn sock boot at Paris 
Fashion Week and Vogue’s last US cover featured Rihanna walking on water in a 
mermaid-esqueTom Ford <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford> gown. 
Meanwhile Kenzo have announced a bespoke line inspired by the new live-action 
version of The Jungle Book. Right now, fashion’s love affair with folklore and 
fantasy imagery is at an all-time high.

Asos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/asos> buyer Ian Amer thinks that 
it’s nostalgia at play. “Everyone grows up listening to stories of princesses, 
princes, witches and dragons. Those references stay with you throughout life. 
Who doesn’t want to be a unicorn?”

The internet played a big role in the popularity of this imagery. You’re only 
a click away from encountering a folklore creature on Tumblr or YouTube. 
“Bloggers have had a massive effect on the popularity of folklore imagery,” 
says fashion and lifestyle blogger Charlotte Evans, who runsEver In May 
<http://everinmay.com/>. “I have an Etsy store and my unicorn phone case is the 
store’s most popular design.” The mermaid meanwhile, was repopularised thanks 
in part to Seapunk. “It came up through Tumblr and underground club/ball 
culture,” says Nylon’s editor-in-chief Melissa Giannini. “It’s rooted in a 
nostalgia for a pre-internet world. Think Lisa Frank imagery and My Little 
Pony.”

In the context of the fashion industry being in a state of organisational 
flux, though, the imagery takes on a different meaning. “I think it’s our way 
of maintaining whimsy in an increasingly cynical and toxic climate. So we turn 
to escapism,” says pop culture writer Anne T Donahue.

Prof Karen Pine, author of Mind What You Wear, says that people internalise 
the characteristics associated with items of clothing. In times of change 
folklore figures, with their magical, mythical powers, become ones to emulate. 
“They go beyond the mere mortal,” she says. “They are aspirational.” Pine says 
it also relates to the ancient idea of the “charm gown”, the item of protective 
clothing which they believe can protect them from harm. “Maybe, these clothes 
are not such a far cry from these?” In a time of change, a talisman outfit 
makes perfect sense. It’s also coded fashion at its most intriguing.
