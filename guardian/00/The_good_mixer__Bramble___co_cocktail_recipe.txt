Blackberry and apple is a hard flavour combo to beat at this time of year. 
Serve as an aperitif. Per serving:

12ml blackberry syrup (make up a batch: simmer 200g blackberries, 200g sugar 
and 100ml water, strain and store in the fridge for up to a week)
25ml vodka 
40ml sweet vermouth
75ml cloudy apple juice
1 slice fresh apple

Fill a tumbler with ice then add the syrup, vermouth and vodka. Top with the 
apple juice and stir. Garnish with a thin slice of apple.
