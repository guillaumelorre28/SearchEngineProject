Hispano, the Spanish bank that is offering more than £8bn for mortgage bank 
Abbey National, yesterday announced a concession to the small shareholders of 
the British bank and simplified the tax issues associated with the deal.

The move comes ahead of the meeting on Thursday for Abbey shareholders to vote 
on the Spanish bank's takeover bid.

For each Abbey share, investors are being offered one Santander share and 31p 
in cash.

If small shareholders had sought to sell their Spanish shares soon after the 
deal, they might have been forced to complete a complex Spanish tax return to 
avoid paying tax.

Now shareholders who are exempt from paying Spanish tax just have to tick a 
consent box and provide personal details.

Abbey shareholders who hold on to their Santander shares over time will still 
have to pay tax on any dividends they get.

It seems likely investors will approve the deal on Thursday, despite a number 
of issues related to the deal.

Pirc, the activist advisory group to investors, last week recommended that its 
clients abstain on the bid because it is concerned about the different 
regulatory regime inSpain <https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain>, the power 
of the Botin family and its calculation that Abbey executives will receive up 
to £11.45m after their share options vest after the takeover.
