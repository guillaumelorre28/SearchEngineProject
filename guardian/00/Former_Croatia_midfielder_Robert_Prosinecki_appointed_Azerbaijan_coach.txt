Azerbaijan have named the former Croatia midfielder Robert Prosinecki as head 
coach to replace Bertie Vogts who quit in October, the country’s FAsaid on its 
website <http://www.affa.az> on Wednesday.

The 45-year-old has agreed to take over until the end of the 2018 World Cup 
qualifying campaign and inherits a team standing bottom of their Euro 2016 
qualifying group without a point.

“Maybe we will not be able to beat Italy and Croatia, but we can play better 
than we have done so far,” Prosinecki said at his unveiling.

Azerbaijan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/azerbaijan> lost 2-1 away to 
Italy on 10 October and were thrashed 6-0 in Croatia three days later. They 
began the campaign with a 2-1 home defeat by Bulgaria and lost their last 
qualifier 1-0 to visitors Norway in mid-November.

“I am an optimist and I believe this team has potential. We have to keep on 
working. After four losses we have to get things back on track and we must beat 
Malta in March,” said Prosinecki referring to their next qualifier at home on 
28 March.

Other candidates interviewed for the Azerbaijan job included Roberto Mancini, 
Martin Jol and Slaven Bilic.

Prosinecki played 49 times for Croatia, scoring 10 goals, and became their 
assistant coach after hanging up his boots.

He has also been head coach of Red Star Belgrade and the Turkish club 
Kayserispor, who he managed until the end of 2013.

 resigned on 17 October after more than six years in charge having failed to 
help the country from the South Caucasus reach their first major tournament.

Vogts, who led Germany to victory at Euro 1996, took over as Azerbaijan 
manager in April 2008 and helped them earn a record nine points in the 
qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup.
