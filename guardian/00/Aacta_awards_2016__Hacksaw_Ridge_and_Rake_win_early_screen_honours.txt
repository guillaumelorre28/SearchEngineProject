Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hacksaw-ridge> 
has already taken out four categories of Australia’s largest screen awards, the 
Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (Aacta) awards.

An “industry luncheon” was held on Monday ahead of the main ceremony on 
Wednesday, which will be broadcast on Channel Seven.

More than 30 category winners were announced at Sydney’s Star Casino on 
Monday. The luncheon focuses largely on behind-the-scenes craft including 
cinematography, sound, production design and editing, saving the top prizes and 
celebrity power for the Wednesday night event.


Gibson’s much anticipated return to directing, Hacksaw Ridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/04/hacksaw-ridge-review-mel-gibson-finds-a-conscience-in-gruesome-war-story>
, is an Australian/US co-production that tells the true story of second world 
war pacifist combat medic, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). The most nominated 
film at the Aactas, it’s up for 13 awards in total. Seven of Hacksaw Ridge’s 
categories will be announced on Wednesday, including best film, best director, 
best lead actor, and best lead actress.

On Monday, it took home best editing, best production design, best 
cinematography and best sound.

Speaking after accepting the award for best sound, Hacksaw Ridge’s supervising 
sound editor Andy Wright described Gibson as “a very organic and visceral 
director. He needs to be with the actors.”

“Even on set we were hearing these stories of how he would run into battle and 
show the actors how he wanted them to perform. So when we were in the ADR 
[automated dialogue replacement] studio, he would be right there with the 
actor, and go through with them how he wanted them to perform.” In some cases, 
Gibson would even perform the lines himself first.

Also winning in multiple categories was ABC series Rake, which stars Richard 
Roxburgh and won best sound and best direction in television. Rake is nominated 
in seven categories, three more of which will be announced on Wednesday.

“Rake is a project of great passion, certainly for Richard [Roxburgh] and 
myself,” said director Peter Duncan, who confirmed they had plans a fifth 
season. “One of the guiding lights of the show has been saying, ‘This will be 
the last season’ every year – because we’re kind of reverse-engineering it, 
tricking the show into continuing.”

Anna Broinowski – who won best documentary director for Pauline Hanson: Please 
Explain! – collected her award from the president of Aacta,Geoffrey Rush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/geoffrey-rush>.

She told media afterwards that the success of the documentary – which tracks 
the second coming of the One Nation leader – came down to lucky timing, and the 
participation of big names including John Howard, Alan Jones, Linda Burney, 
David Oldfield and Hanson herself.

family, in Pauline Hanson: Please Explain!, directed by Anna Broinowski.

No one was taking Hanson seriously at the time, Broinowski said. “We were the 
only documentary crew following her. No one knew that she was going to get in, 
she was under the radar … it was like what was happening with Trump. Hanson got 
in because she was a TV celebrity. Everyone was watching her on TV – but not 
the tastemakers, the opinion makers, the media.”

Broinowski said that while she did not expect to become best friends with 
Hanson, the politician was likeable in person – and agreed to go for a drink 
with the director after watching the show. (“If that happens, you know you’ve 
behaved ethically,” Broinowski said.)

“She’s present. She’s self-deprecating. She cooks a great Thai chicken curry. 
She mixes a fantastic drink called the ginger bitch, which is her favourite 
cocktail – rum and ginger beer. She’s a great host,” she said.

“I did develop a desire to look after her, because she’s trusting you with her 
stuff. But when you talk politics, something different comes out. And no. There 
was no chance Pauline Hanson and I were going to become best buddies.”

This was the inaugural year for a hair and makeup category, which was won by 
ABC series Cleverman – a new superhero fantasy series based on Indigenous 
Dreamtime stories, with an 80% Indigenous cast.

In the show, which also aired on Sundance TV in the United States, the 
Indigenous “hairypeople” are stronger and faster than humans. Speaking after 
accepting the award, senior makeup artist Troy Follington explained that his 
biggest challenge was styling the women.

“Put too much hair on a girl and it’s not good,” he said. “And girls don’t 
like that whole thing too much. So that was one of our biggest challenges – to 
make the girls hairy people but still looking feminine and gorgeous, and like, 
you’d like to go there.”

A season six episode of Game of Thrones, Battle of the Bastards, won two 
Australians – Glenn Melenhorst and Ineke Majoor – an award for best visual 
effects. The battle itself involved hundreds of digital horses, and “thousands 
upon thousands” of digital extras. Melenhorst said it was “the hardest, most 
difficult work we’ve ever done”.

The second challenge: keeping the plot secret. “When they gave us the first 
information on the series, we saw Jon Snow in it, and we knew he was alive – we 
were among the only people in the world who knew that, for about a year. I’ve 
never held onto a secret so tightly,” Melenhorst said.

Hitting Home – Sarah Ferguson’s ABC documentary series on domestic violence in 
Australia – won the documentary award at the annual Walkley journalism awards 
on Friday. It also took the Aacta for best documentary TV program.

Producer Ivan O’Mahoney said the series was hugely complex, revolving around a 
variety of legal, journalistic, psychological, political and safety issues. “We 
spent about a year drafting a duty of care statement – not just our promise to 
those who agreed to participate, but also as a note to ourselves as to how to 
behave; the dos and don’ts when you’re operating in this field,” he said.

“You owe a duty of care to all your subjects when you’re making a documentary, 
but especially when they’re as vulnerable as the women who decided to speak out 
in our series.”

Other notable prizes included best supporting actor in a televised drama, for 
Damon Herriman of Secret City; best performance in a TV comedy, for Patrick 
Brammall of No Activity; and best supporting actress in a televised drama, for 
Celia Pacquola of The Beautiful Lie – an ABC miniseries reimagining Anna 
Karenina, starring Sarah Snook.


Best known for her comedy career, Pacquola said she was “still surprised” that 
she got the part of Dolly Faraday.

“I’m surprised that I even got an audition. I’ve always wanted to try a drama, 
but not at all did I think I’d get a chance.”

“It really gave me an opportunity to see what my life would be like if I 
hadn’t pursued comedy. I would have been in a very unhappy marriage,” she joked.

Now in their sixth year, the Aacta awards grew out of the Australian Film 
Industry (AFI) awards, which widened to encompass TV categories in 1986.

The luncheon hosts, comedians Kitty Flanagan and Tom Gleeson, cheekily 
shrugged off the Monday event as the “B awards” in their opening remarks: 
“We’re off air, it really doesn’t matter,” Flanagan laughed.

The major ceremony will be broadcast at 8.30pm on Wednesday.
