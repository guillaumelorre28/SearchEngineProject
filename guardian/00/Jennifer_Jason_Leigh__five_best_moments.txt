The past 15 years or so has seen Jennifer Jason Leigh spend far too much time 
lost in the Hollywood wilderness. The undeniably talented actor has been 
cruelly underused by an industry that never quite knew how to take her, despite 
a set of fine performances.

But the star is making a mighty comeback with an Oscar-nominated role in 
Quentin Tarantino’s gruesome western The Hateful Eight, parts in Rob Reiner’s 
Lyndon B Johnson biopic and the Twin Peaks reboot and, released this week, a 
key voice role in Charlie Kaufman’s unique stop-motion dramaAnomalisa

It’s a heartfelt performance and shows a tenderness that exemplifies her range 
after playing a feral prisoner for Tarantino. Here are her other career highs 
so far:

 Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
Leigh had a few small films under her belt by the age of 20 but it took a 
central role in Amy Heckerling and Cameron Crowe’s acutely observed 1982 
high-school comedy to put her on the map. As a 15-year-old, unsure of her self 
and her appeal to the opposite sex, she was a warm and relatable presence at 
odds with many of the more confident characters she went on to play.

Speaking of which, seven years later she took on the role of Tralala, a 
tricksy prostitute, in the adaptation of Hubert Selby’s controversial 
collection of short stories. It was a grim and not entirely successful film, 
but she was the highlight, storming on to the screen and stealing ever scene 
she appeared in.

In 1992, she played her part in the ever-extending subgenre of the psycho 
thriller, her unsettling performance contributing to one of the most 
fascinatingly perverse examples of it. She played Bridget Fonda’s mousy new 
housemate whose clinginess turns into something far stranger, giving her the 
chance to portray antisocial behaviour escalating into convincing mania.

 Georgia (1995). 
Leigh’s Oscars snub at the time was questioned by many – Meryl Streep 
expressed her dismay, while Elisabeth Shue dedicated her independent spirit 
award to Leigh’s performance – the role of a troubled singer was a 
career-peaking showcase for the actor. As the younger sister to Mare 
Winningham’s more settled folk singer, her self-loathing punk-rock band member 
gave her so much to work with that it’s little surprise the film was a 
long-time passion project for Leigh.

Leigh’s husband, Noah Baumbach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/28/noah-baumbach-while-were-young>, 
has a Tarantino-esque habit of casting overlooked actors and giving them 
transformative roles (his next is set to star Adam Sandler) and here he cast 
his wife as the long-suffering sister of Nicole Kidman’s snobbish sociopath. 
She’s astoundingly good in the less showy role, and gave a small yet punchy 
performance in Baumbach’sGreenberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/greenberg-review> not long after.
