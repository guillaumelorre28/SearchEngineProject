Anne Robinson <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/anne-robinson> is to 
step down as presenter of Watchdog after 15 years to film a new factual series 
for the BBC.

Robinson will begin work on the new series this autumn, but no other details 
have been announced.

The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> said Robinson’s successful 
turn presenting Britain’s Spending Secrets, which attracted 5.7 million 
viewers, had led it to commission Robinson for the new series.

BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore said: “Anne is a much-treasured part of the 
BBC1 family and I’m grateful for everything she has done on Watchdog for nearly 
15 years. I’m looking forward to her returning to the channel with a new 
factual series next year.”

“It’s been an honour to be part of the most important consumer show in 
Britain,” said Robinson.

Robinson brought her acerbic wit not only to the consumer affairs programme 
but also famously to game show The Weakest Link, where her catchphrase was the 
bitting put-down “You are the Weakest Link – goodbye.”

Last month she spoke out about TV’s attitude to older women, telling the Radio 
Times

 they were more likely to be axed because of their age than their male 
colleagues and had to be more “clever, versatile, funny and thin” to avoid the 
chop.

A new lineup for Watchdog, which has been broadcast for 35 years, is yet to be 
announced, but current presenters Matt Allwright and Chris Hollins will 
continue on the show.
