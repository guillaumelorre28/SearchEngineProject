France's most notorious rogue trader, Jérôme Kerviel, is feeling a little sore 
about his impendingthree-year jail sentence for running up losses of €4.9bn

(£4.2bn) at Société Générale. The Gallic version of Nick Leeson says he 
identifies with Gordon Gekko, the jailed antihero of the 1987 movie Wall Street:

 "For fun, I often think of Gordon Gekko's piece of advice: 'If you need a 
friend, get a dog'. Unfortunately, that speaks to my own experience."

In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, Kerviel repeatedly insisted his 
superiors knew precisely what he was up to as he ran up vast bets on German 
stocks and US sub-prime loans. The 33-year-old, bless him, claims to have been 
stunned when he was found guilty of forgery, unauthorised computer use and 
breach of trust: "It pulled my legs right our from under me, it was so 
unexpected. At first, I was paralysed."

Kerviel reckons his reckless trades were far from unique: "Nobody knows 
everything that's hidden in the balance sheets of banks. In fact, they are 
completely impenetrable. To invest €150m, it only takes a second. For €1bn, you 
need four seconds. Things are so quick with computers that you lose any sense 
of the amounts involved."

He's going to have to get his head around the amount involved now, though. 
He's been ordered by a judge to pay back the money he lost on SocGen's behalf. 
On his present salary of €2,300 a month as a computer consultant, that'll take 
177,000 years.
