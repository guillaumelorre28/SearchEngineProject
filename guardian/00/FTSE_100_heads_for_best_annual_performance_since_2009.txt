With a pre-Christmas rally roaring ahead, leading shares have moved into 
positive territory for the month.

The FTSE 100 finished at 6678.61, up 72.03 points on the day and ahead of 6650 
level seen at the start of December.

The leading index is currently up around 13% on the year so far and is on 
course for its best annual performance since 2009, when it rose 22%.

Investors have been buoyed by hopes of strong US economic growth after upbeat 
comments from the International Monetary Fund, while last week's news that the 
Federal Reserve was trimming its $85bn a month bond buying programme by $10bn 
does not seem to have caused too many ructions.

There was also a limited reaction to growing fears of a credit crunch in 
China, which mainly sent precious metal prices tumbling again. Gold is on 
course for the biggest annual fall since 1981, helping pushRandgold Resources 
14p lower to £37.51.

Arm led the FTSE 100 risers, up 42p at £11.10. The chip designer was boosted 
by news one of its key customers,Apple, has signed a long awaited deal with 
China Mobile, giving it access to one of the world's fastest growing markets. 
Marc Kimsey, senior trader at Accendo Markets, said:
 Traders are snapping up shares in Arm today after Apple agreed a tie-up with 
China Mobile. The state-owned network boasts more than 750m subscribers, put in 
to context the entire US population consists of 318m. With Arm technology in 
every Apple handset, the potential is obvious. Expect to see Apple's 5% share 
of the $80bn Chinese smartphone market increase significantly in 2014.

Carnival continued to cruise higher, up another 75p at £24.64 following its 
better than expected figures last week.

But recently floated Royal Mail lost 10p to 580p on profit taking as it made 
its debut on the FTSE 100.Ashtead, the industrial group, was the other entrant 
into the leading index, and it too slipped back, down 9p at 764.5p.

Vedanta Resources, up 25p at 873.5p, and Croda, 55p better at £24.55, were the 
two companies to lose their places.

Another newcomer to the stock market, Merlin Entertainments, took its place in 
the FTSE 250 but fell 4.3p to 361.7p.

Burberry dipped 6p to £14.59 and BT edged down 0.3p to 376.5p as both 
companies saw their shares go ex-dividend.

Elsewhere Centamin climbed 2.11p to 42.25, responding to a recent upgrade from 
Canaccord Genuity, which moved from hold to speculative buy, with a price 
target increased from 38p to 60p. The broker said:
 We raise Centamin from hold following the robust operating results amid the 
challenging political environment. In 2014 we expect a shift to positive free 
cash flow and the final court ruling on the license appeal, which we expect to 
be positive for Centamin. 
Serco added 13.2p to 485.2p after the troubled outsourcing group announced a 
six month addition to an Australian contract for detention services.
