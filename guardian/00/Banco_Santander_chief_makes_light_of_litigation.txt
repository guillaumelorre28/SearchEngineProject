Emilio Botín, the boss of the new owner of Abbey National, faced his first 
criminal trial yesterday by joking with reporters, greeting the judges warmly 
and exuding confidence throughout.

The 70-year-old chairman of Grupo Santander - which bought Abbey in November - 
and his two co-defendants, José María Amusátegui and Angel Corcóstegui, face 
charges of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. These relate 
to pension payments of over €160m (£111m) that Mr Amusátegui and Mr Corcóstegui 
shared when they left the bank in 2001 and 2002.

The case has been brought by two private individuals, Francisco Franco Otegi 
and Rafael Perez Escolar. "Our case is essentially simple," Mr Otegi told the 
Guardian. "Those payments had no legal justification."

When the judges entered the court, Mr Botín moved along the line shaking hands 
like a perfect host.

Mr Botín was due to testify yesterday, but from the outset defence lawyers set 
out to wrongfoot the prosecution. As an opening gambit, they presented a stack 
of new evidence, including a report by executive compensation specialists 
Towers Perrin.

Prosecution lawyers appeared ruffled as a sheaf of documents a foot high was 
deposited on their desk. They called for the hearing to be adjourned to give 
them time to assess the new evidence. The presiding judge agreed to an 
adjournment until Monday.
