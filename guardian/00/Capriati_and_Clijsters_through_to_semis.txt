No1 seed Jennifer Capriati 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jennifer-capriati> continued her quest to 
retain the Australian Open title with a 6-2, 6-2 quarter-final victory over 
Amelie Mauresmo in Melbourne today.

The American was quickly on top, breaking Mauresmo's serve in the opening 
game, and continued to dominate as the Frenchwoman made a total of 34 unforced 
errors.

Capriati said: "I've got a lot to be happy for. This is where it all counts - 
how you do in a Grand Slam and where I try to bring my best tennis.

"I do try to bring it everywhere, but this is where it counts the most. It's 
getting down to the second week and it's getting down to the moment where the 
best players are really going to bring their best games, so I'm glad I could 
raise my game to that level.

"I had to be really steady and determined today and hope that this would be 
the start of the best things in the next coming matches.

"I felt pretty good here last year and it will be hard to top that. I just 
hope I am feeling the same way this year."

Capriati will now meet Kim Clijsters in the last four after the Belgian number 
four seed beat fellow countrywoman Justine Henin 6-2 6-3.

Fourth seed Clijsters admitted: "It is tough to play your best friend. I try 
to block it out as much as I can, but it is always at the back of your mind. It 
is not easy, as I would like to see both of us doing well in a Grand Slam.

"Both of us are Belgian and it is great. We are good friends. 

"Once we come off court we are friends again. When we are on court we fight 
against each other and hate each other, but when the match is finished we are 
friends again. I think that is why we are such good friends."

The other semi-final will see Swiss third seed Martina Hingis take on American 
eighth seed Monica Seles.
