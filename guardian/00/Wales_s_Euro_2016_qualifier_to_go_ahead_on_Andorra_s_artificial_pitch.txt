Wales’s opening Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday will go ahead on Andorra’s 3G 
pitch after the surface passed a Uefa inspection.

Doubts over the game were raised last month after tests on the surface at the 
rebuilt 3,300-capacity national stadium inAndorra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/andorra> la Vella showed that the ball 
may roll too fast.

However, after a close inspection by Uefa officials, the pitch was passed, and 
the Football Association ofWales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> 
confirmed the game would go ahead as planned, rather than be moved to Barcelona.

Before the decision was announced, the Wales manager Chris Coleman said: 
“Ideally we’d be on the grass as we’re not used to playing on a 3G pitch. My 
message to our players is ‘forget where we’re playing’. We’ve got to get a 
result and whatever the surface we’ve got to get through it and do our job.”
