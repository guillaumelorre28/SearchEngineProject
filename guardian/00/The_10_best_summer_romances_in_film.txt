1 Red Dust

Victor Fleming, 1932

No amount of resourceful set dressing can convince us that this poky MGM 
backlot is a perspiring slab of French Indochina in monsoon season. That’s the 
job of the three leads in this deliciously humid love triangle, as rubber 
plantation manager Clark Gable is caught between randy hooker Jean Harlow (of 
course) and buttoned-up, married Mary Astor just as the rains begin to fall. 
Cue all the pre-Code steam the trio can muster, with Harlow least bothered by 
the heat. “I’m not used to sleeping nights anyway,” she smirks saucily, before 
prancing off to bathe nude in a barrel.

2 Summertime

David Lean, 1955

Anyone who has been to Venice in peak summer recently will know that this 
rapturous lonely-hearts romance <http://www.criterion.com/films/368-summertime> 
could hardly take place there today. Katharine Hepburn’s briefly footloose Ohio 
secretary would scarcely register Rossano Brazzi’s amorous eye contact amid the 
hordes of handbag hawkers and snaking queues of Crocs-shod tourists in the 
Piazza San Marco. Then again, this is a film that knows better than most the 
impermanence of the ideal: David Lean’s favourite of his own works, it’s as 
poetic and heartsore an ode to the pleasures of fleeting emotional connection 
as the more celebratedBrief Encounter

3 Smiles of a Summer Night 

Ingmar Bergman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ingmarbergman>, 1955

For a director frequently held up as the pin-up for stony Scandinavian gloom, 
Ingmar Bergman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ingmarbergman> had something 
of a yen for the warmer months. This space could as easily have been taken by
Summer Interlude <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW-f_la2-GA>, his gorgeous 
reflection on a ballerina’s tragedy-capped holiday fling, orSummer With Monika 
<http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsgsat_summer-with-monika-1953-official-trailer_shortfilms>
, in which a coastal escape turns to soured reality as the air cools. But how 
to resistthis joyous romantic comedy 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suMQZRAOivo>, in which four couples whirl 
between desire, conflict and consummation on the shortest night of the year? If 
only Strindberg’s Miss Julie had instead found herself in this Swedish country 
manor on Midsummer’s Eve.

4 Pierrot le fou 

Jean-Luc Godard <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeanlucgodard>, 1965

Whether you choose to view Godard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeanlucgodard>’s wild, slapstick-fuelled 
fable of amour fou <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycg2yb3qiUo> as a summer 
romance or not – to borrow its own words, it’s “tender and cruel”, and built on 
foxy trickery – there’s little denying that it’s romantically summery, driven 
by rash decisions made in the heat of the moment. The French Riviera, where 
married Parisian media type Ferdinand and makeshift moll Marianne escape via a 
blithe crime spree, usually appears on screen in genteel pastels, not the 
bursting-hot primary colours it does here. Every frame suggests you might singe 
your fingers if you touch the screen.

5 The Green Ray 

(Eric Rohmer, 1986)

Rohmer <https://www.theguardian.com/film/eric-rohmer>’s own A Summer’s Tale, 
made 10 years later, is probably a better love story: The Green Ray 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1aar4IDUvU>, loosely inspired by Jules 
Verne’s romantic 1882 novel, isn’t a love story at all, but a story, most 
profoundly and searchingly, about love. Singleton Delphine begins and revises 
her summer vacation too many times for any relationship to take root. As she 
flits restlessly from Paris to Cherbourg to the Alps, it’s not clear what or 
whom she is looking for, until a chance encounter in a Biarritz train station 
offers a clue. A gentle critique of the false associations we’ve attached to 
the season, it’s a pretty perfectly constructed summer tale in itself.

6 The Man in the Moon 

Robert Mulligan, 1991

Robert Mulligan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/23/obituary-robert-mulligan> knew 
the elegiac nature of an American summer: there’sTo Kill a Mockingbird, of 
course, but he also made a pretty good lunge for this list with the liltingly 
scored wartime weepieSummer of ’42. His final and most undervalued film, The 
Man in the Moon <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdU3nAl0n3c>, combines the 
latter’s Rockwell romanticism with a measure of Harper Lee’s tough love – it 
conveys the full, fluttery thrill of a 14-year-old girl’s first kiss and, less 
expectedly the stark, searing pain of affections swiftly transferred. The 1957 
summer, an especially honey-dipped Louisiana special, enhances the first 
experience as intensely as it aggravates the second.

7 Before Sunrise/Before Sunset/Before Midnight

Richard Linklater <https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater>, 
1995/2004/2013

Celine and Jesse, the great imperfect pairing of modern cinema, talk about 
everything but the weather across the three films that make upRichard Linklater 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater>’s time-lapse relationship 
study, yet theirs is a relationship that seems essentially activated by summer 
itself. Certainly, they’d never have whiled away a whole Viennese night 
together in less balmy climes, reconvening in the less impulsive month of 
December, as initially planned, might have ended the whole thing. There’s a 
flipside, though: by the time they’re holidaying in Greece with their 
daughters, 18 years later, the sun actively heats their squabbles. An uncertain 
autumn beckons.

8 Brokeback Mountain <https://www.theguardian.com/film/brokeback-mountain> 

(Ang Lee, 2005)

Cinema boasts more romantic midsummer night trysts 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc7Odty5MuM> than Ennis Del Mar and Jack 
Twist’s fast, fumbling first fuck in a cramped, remote tent, butfew quite as 
consequential <https://www.theguardian.com/film/brokeback-mountain>. There’s no 
feverish, heat-induced irrationality motivating them – for one thing, those 
Wyoming hillside nights get pretty darn cold – but a deep-rooted emotional need 
that neither man quite understands. Their intercourse ushers in a summer of 
rough, unspoken love that can neither be extended nor repeated – however many 
fishing trips they take later in married life – with two bloodied cowboy shirts 
its only souvenir.

9 The Myth of the American Sleepover 

David Robert Mitchell, 2010

Summer romance on screen may not be the exclusive preserve of teenagers, but 
given the unstructured, unsupervised nature of the season, they get to make 
more of it than most. If Hollywood’s teen movie annals are to be believed, 
summertime is a veritable marathon of coltish sexual activity, which is why 
they aren’t to be believed, and whyMitchell’s wistful, loving portrait 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa1Sh2WZAMc> of youths awkwardly at rest seems 
closer to the truth. The suburban Michigan air here is heavy with pool chlorine 
and chastely frustrated crushes; childhood may be over by the next school term.

10 Tabu 

Miguel Gomes, 2012

Gomes’s rather odd imagination appears to flourish in the heat – before Tabu 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoelUhjVXas> came Our Beloved Month of August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/28/our-beloved-month-of-august-review>
, which delighted in Portugal’s communal rituals of that month. Thissustained 
swoon of a film <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148119/tabu> is less 
specifically dedicated to the season, though its emotions surely wouldn’t run 
so woozily high in a different setting. Detailing an illicit affair in colonial 
Africa, folded in sheets of ephemeral memory, Gomes’s summer is drenched in 
sweat, cicadas and Portuguese language covers of the Ronettes – a hypnotic, 
inhibition-overriding combination. The film’s present-day sections, set in 
rain-spritzed Lisbon, may as well be Arctic by comparison.
