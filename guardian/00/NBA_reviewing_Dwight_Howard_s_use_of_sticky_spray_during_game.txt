Atlanta’s Paul Millsap complained about the ball while shooting two free 
throws with 3:36 remaining in the first quarter. Howard made a layup with 4:04 
remaining.

“I’ve never felt the ball like that ever,” Millsap told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. “It was sticky. It was like super glue or something was 
on there. I couldn’t get it off my hands. It was the weirdest thing ever.”

Referees gave warnings to each bench and then approached the scorer’s table, 
where they were directed to a can covered with white tape. The can was taken 
off the table and one of the officials told the scorer to alert him if it was 
seen again.

There was no penalty issued during the game, but a league spokesman said 
Saturday night’s incident is under review.

“I’ve been using it for the last five years,” Howard told the Houston 
Chronicle. “It hasn’t been a problem. I don’t know why people are making a big 
deal out of it. I do it every game. It’s not a big deal. I ain’t even tripping.”
