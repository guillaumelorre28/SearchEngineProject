Pierre d'Avoine studied at Birmingham School of Architecture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture>. He worked with Peter 
Bond Partnership and Fitzroy Robinsons before establishing Pierre d'Avoine 
Architects in 1979.

He currently teaches architecture at the Architectural Association, and has 
also taught at the Royal College of Art, the Bartlett (UCL), and the University 
of Bath.

D'Avoine is also external examiner for several schools of architecture in 
Britain. He is a RIBA director and has been a visiting critic and lectured 
extensively in both the UK and abroad.

In 1998 he won the Concept House Competition for his Slim House, a proposal 
developed with Max Fordham to create a highly energy efficient development. The 
buildings were arranged to minimise the area of exposed external wall and 
rainwater was retained for maintaining planting.
