Aaron Ramsey has played down fears over his fitness after he injured his ankle 
in Wales’s 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win overAndorra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/andorra>.

Ramsey, who picked up the injury while twisting on Andorra’s much-criticised 
artificial pitch, said he was hoping to be fit to feature for Arsenal against
Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> on 
Saturday.

“I’ll be all right – the pitch was very hard there’s no give in it so I rolled 
my ankle a bit,” he said. “Hopefully it will be nothing and I’ll be available 
for Saturday. These are the games you want to play in and I’m looking forward 
to it.”

Uefa has said

 it will wait for the official report from the game before deciding whether the 
Andorra la Vella stadium can continue hosting European Championship matches.

Gareth Bale – who scored both Welsh goals in their 2-1 win – described the 3G 
pitch as “by far the worst I’ve ever played on”, while the manager Chris 
Coleman said: “In my opinion the pitch is not up to the standard of a Uefa 
qualifier … If you’re a passing team, forget it.”
