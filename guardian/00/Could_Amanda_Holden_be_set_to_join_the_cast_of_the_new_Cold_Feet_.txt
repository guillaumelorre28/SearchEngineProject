Could Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/amanda-holden> be set to join the 
cast of the reboot of Cold Feet?

Holden was in conversation with Peter Fincham, ITV’s director of television, 
promoting shows at ITV’s star-studded gala at the London Palladium when the 
topic came up.

Fincham confirmed that all the original Cold Feet cast members would be 
returning

 for the new series except Helen Baxendale, who was killed off in a lorry crash 
in the original series.


Holden, who had been bantering with Fincham in front of the 2,200 strong 
audience of media and talent about not appearing in new shows for 2016, quickly 
piped up.

“That means Jimmy Nesbit needs a new wife!,” she said. “Is there a casting 
couch?”

Earlier, Holden had ribbed Fincham for not being an option for ITV’s drama 
about Gerald Durrell’s childhood in Corfu

 – his mother is played by Keely Hawes – pointing out that before BGT and 
stints on ITV’s This Morning she had been in series Wild at Heart which was 
shot in South Africa.

“I’ve heard you don’t travel well,” quipped Fincham. Holden said: “Am I too 
expensive for this one too? I used to be an actress you know.”

Fincham went on to unveil clips of the dramatisation of epic poem Beowulf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/15/beowulf-poem-itv-drama-series>, 
a big budget production which was filmed in a quarry in Northumberland.

“I don’t do quarries, darling,” she said. “But I’d have liked the choice.”
