Edinburgh in August isn’t all comedy and theatre and people importuning you on 
the streets to thrust flyers into your hand. There’s also a rich musical 
programme at the Edinburgh international festival, and this year we’ve teamed 
up with the festival to bring you video of some of the standout performers. 
Coming up, we’ll have Anne-Sophie Mutter and her band, Yarn Wire performing 
Sufjan Stevens’ soundtrack to Round Up, and more.

We kick off with Anna Calvi <https://www.theguardian.com/music/anna-calvi> and 
Heritage Orchestra performing Eliza. Calvi and the Heritage Orchestra first 
started working together in December 2014, when they played a one-off show at 
St John’s Church in east London, performing radical orchestral reimaginings of 
her songs. Have a look and let us know what you think.
