The first thing you’ll notice is the sound. Lining two walls of a dark, 
cube-like space within the National Gallery of Australia inCanberra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/canberra> is a congregation of 
clocks of different shapes and sizes, ticking, chiming and cuckoo-ing 
relentlessly. Each has been painted with ominous images and phrases that read 
like a lament to passing time, and time past.

The clocks – and their echoing noise – add tension and conceptual depth to a 
room that’s already brimming with both.

56th Venice Biennale review – more of a glum trudge than an exhilarating

Painstakingly reproduced from her showing at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Fiona 
Hall’s Wrong Way Time comprises about 800 objects which have been brought back 
to Australia from Italy. Each piece is tied together by the theme of time: its 
inexorable but cyclic march, the lessons we have learned over time (and those 
we haven’t) and the histories that repeat whether we want them to or not.

As a display mechanism, the Adelaide-based artist has drawn from the concept 
of the wunderkammer – cabinets of curiosities which originated in Renaissance 
Europe as a way of cataloguing the world (or communicating one version of it). 
Glass cabinets form an inside square in the room, filled with evidence of 
Hall’s multi-varied craftsmanship: sculptures, weave-work, paintings and 
various collections of readymade objects which she has tinkered with in other 
ways. Viewers bend over – eyes to the glass – as they crouch their way slowly 
from one cabinet to the next. The atmosphere is sombre, mystical and 
immediately compelling.

 Fiona Hall’s Wrong Way Time was the first exhibition held at the new permanent 
Australian pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale. It has been painstakingly 
recreated for a homecoming show at Canberra’s National Gallery of Australia.

As the unifying theme of this year’s Adelaide Biennial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/01/2016-adelaide-biennial-of-australian-art-colour-wonder-materialism-and-magic>
, the wunderkammer seems to be enjoying a local revival, but Hall tells 
Guardian Australia she has been using the concept since at least the mid-90s. 
She calls herself a “museum junkie”.

“I’m not talking here about art galleries or art museums,” she says, “but 
other kinds of museums: museums of natural history that were set up two or 
three centuries ago ... where objects from the world outside the confines of 
the museum were isolated from their original context, chosen not just for their 
informational value but also just because they were beautiful, or strange or 
quirky.

“[The wunderkammer] puts a particular kind of spin on our relationship with 
the world and how we decipher it, and how we choose to categorise it and then 
display it.”

Some pieces in Wrong Way Time are overtly political, dealing with 
international relations, capitalism and the environment; others are left open 
to analysis, but lift the mood with witty words and wryness.


In one cabinet, shredded dollar bills are hand-woven into exquisite birds’ 
nests, replicated from different species which are now extinct thanks to the 
ravages of capitalism (Tender). In another sits a collection of small glass 
perfume bottles on which are painted skulls to represent disappeared Tamils in 
Sri Lanka (Vaporised). In a third, endangered marine species have been 
hand-carved out of single sardine tins (in the style of her controversial 1996 
workParadisus Terrestis 
<http://www.roslynoxley9.com.au/artists/17/Fiona_Hall/182/>), each painted with 
maritime signal flags (Fleet).

At the centre of the exhibition is All the King’s Men: 20 bleak, spirit-like 
forms that seem to float. Step closer and they represent warriors or foot 
soldiers, their heads comprising shredded camouflage fabric taken from various 
armies, knitted together with a meticulous workmanship common to Hall’s work.

Sewn into the masks and the “bodies” – strips of camouflage that hang down – 
are boxing gloves, dice, bits of glass and billiard balls, the life that was 
lived underneath the uniforms.

In the accompanying room sits earlier but related work from Hall’s four-decade 
career. Moving between the spaces, you see the beginnings of the artist’s 
longstanding fascination with nature, out of which has more recently grown work 
that deals with politics, global finance and war. “I’m not someone who thinks 
that art necessarily changes the world,” Hall says. “I would never have thought 
when I started out with my art practice that I would end up making work that 
was quite concertedly referencing some of these issues. But maybe as one gets 
older you gain a different kind of awareness, and the emphasis of your work 
changes.”

If Wrong Way Time is a feat of both craftsmanship and concept, it’s also a 
feat of packing peanuts. “This is one of the most complex installations that 
we’ve ever done,” says Dr Deborah Hart, senior curator at the National Gallery. 
She points out “one of the great miracles of the show that made it through 
customs”: a series of small sculptures carved from baked bread installed on an 
open atlas, which represent various tragedies – environmental, cultural and 
militaristic – that occurred in the region on which it sits (Crust).

One bread carving is of intricate barbed wire; another, an exploded village on 
a map of Syria, with tiny bricks of bread strewn across it. “Even Fiona was 
quite amazed that these had arrived in tact,” says Hart.

Fiona has always been “a great collector of things”, Hart continues, from bank 
notes to bottles, from clocks to cans. In one particularly remarkable 
installation, Manuhiri (Travellers), she has collected a giant mandala of 
anthropomorphic driftwood found in New Zealand. Some resemble various animals 
so closely it’s hard to believe they were naturally occurring.

“When they don’t speak to her, she puts them back,” says Hart. “So the ones 
that she actually chose all had this feeling of something about them, which she 
brings out by gently whittling.”

The one collaborative work in the room is a 40-piece installation called Kuka 
Irititja (Animals from Another Time): whimsical, otherworldly beings woven from 
native grasses by Hall and a group of 12 Tjanpi desert weavers, when she spent 
two weeks near Pilakatilyuru, where the Northern Territory, South Australian 
and Western Australian borders meet. Two of the women she worked with – Mary 
Pan and Rene Kulitja – came to Canberra for the exhibition launch on Thursday.

“It’s been such a privilege, such a huge thing in my life experience so far, 
to be able to go and spend a couple of weeks at a time in the desert working 
with them,” says Hall. “I’m very proud and honoured that they were part of it 
as well.”

• Fiona Hall’s Wrong Way Time <http://nga.gov.au/WrongWayTime/Default.cfm> is 
at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, until 10 July
