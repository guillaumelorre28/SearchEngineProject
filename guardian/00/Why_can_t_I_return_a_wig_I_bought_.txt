Q Last week I bought a wig, but when I got home I decided it didn't suit me 
after all. The firm is refusing to give me a refund, saying that as I tried it 
on before purchasing I only have myself to blame. I pointed out that if I try a 
dress on in a shop, I am still entitled to a refund if I change my mind, so 
what's the difference? They answered that had I ordered the wig by mail order 
they could give me a refund, and that they had a notice saying no refunds are 
given, which I didn't see. Are they within their rights?

A The notice in the shop saying no refunds will be given is not legally 
binding, but on every other point the shop is right and you are wrong.

You are not entitled to a refund simply because you changed your mind about 
the goods you have bought. You can insist on a refund only if the goods turn 
out to be faulty or misdescribed. Some shops, such as the dress shop you 
mention, may give you a refund simply because you have had a change of heart, 
but they do so as a good will gesture not because the law requires it.

If you had bought the wig by mail order you would have been entitled to a 
seven-day cooling off period, during which you could exercise your right to 
cancel and get your money back. So the shop was right to say that if you had 
bought it by mail order you could have got a refund.
