R&B star Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> has been refused a Sri 
Lankan visa after one of his music videos spurred violent protests in the 
nation's capital. The singer apologised to Sri Lankan Buddhists, saying he 
"never set out to offend or desecrate anyone's religion" with the video to Sexy 
Chick, which shows a raunchy pool party in front of a statue of the Buddha.

"[I] am a spiritual man, so I can understand why they are offended," Akon 
said. "But violence is never the answer and I am disheartened to hear about 
what happened inSri Lanka <https://www.theguardian.com/world/srilanka>."

Sexy Chick is not strictly speaking Akon's song â€“ it was released by French 
producer David Guetta, with Akon as guest vocalist. Nor is thevideo 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9hazmsUxrM> a parade of sharply targeted 
blasphemies. Instead, it's the most banal kind of dance-music clip, with 
writhing bikini babes and terrible haircuts. Shot at a mansion in Ibiza, the 
Buddha statue scarcely figures at all, appearing in the corner of frames, out 
of focus, for mere instants (2:06 in theYouTube video 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9hazmsUxrM>). Akon claims that he was not 
aware the statue was even there.

Despite this, hundreds of people stormed the headquarters of Colombo's 
Maharaja television network on Monday, protesting a forthcoming gig by Akon. 
Demonstrators threw stones, with four workers injured and several cars smashed, 
according to the BBC. The Sri Lankan government subsequently denied the 
Senegalese-born singer's visa request, citing his "controversial video images, 
offensive song lyrics and strong protests coming from various cultural, 
religious groups and organisations in the country".

Akon's promoters have formally cancelled the 20 April concert, but say they 
are hoping to reschedule once the "situation [has been] resolved".
