The Association of Art Historians <http://www.aah.org.uk> called the decision 
“a significant loss of access to a range of cultures, artefacts and ideas for 
young people” – and many of our readers who have studied and taught the subject 
agreed.

‘The A-Level changed everything for me, opening up a world of history, 
philosophy and sociology in a really exciting way’

I was always considered more creative than academic as a child; I studied 
History of Art at A-Level (as well asArt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/artanddesign> and English) thinking I'd 
go on to do fine art at uni. The A-Level changed everything for me, it opened 
up a world of history, philosophy, sociology in a way that I could get really 
excited about. I went on to get a First in my degree (in History of Art) and a 
Masters, which for someone who was never considered 'academic' is not bad 
going. Without that A-Level I would never have learnt that you don't have to be 
good at STEM subjects to be considered intelligent/academic.
Not everyone is built for a 'real' job (as people keep calling them); I am not 
good at maths/science/languages, so why force young people to take those 
subjects, only to do badly, have their confidence knocked, and end up in a 
position no better than when they started. Better to broaden their minds and 
give them more opportunities to study things that actually interests them. Well 
rounded individuals surely make for better employees? And yes I have a good job 
in the arts for all you naysayers out there hellbent on taking me and my 
comment down!

‘One needs creativity as well as fine-tuned analytical and interpretative 
skills’

I'd like to know in what way History of Art is a 'soft' subject'. Having taken 
it at A' level, I found it wasn't as easy to create flash cards, mnemonics or 
the other easy methods of rote learning the formulae, equations or other fixed 
items of knowledge necessary for maths and the sciences. The fact that one 
needs creativity as well as fine-tuned analytical and interpretative skills 
means, as a subject, it requires more cognitive depth than the so-called 'hard' 
subjects, which one merely digests and regurgitates in an exam. I'd challenge 
anyone who finds physics or maths fairly straightforward to breeze through the 
course and get themselves an A-grade; a 'soft' subject it is not.

I find it deeply disappointing that this course is not available at A' level 
any longer; very disappointing and very depressing. Philistinism has its hand 
at the wheel and its driving us off a cliff. This is a sad day.

‘I studied History of Art A-level at evening classes – when I was in my 50s’

I studied History of Art 'A' level at evening classes, when I was in my 
fifties. It was brilliant, one of the most interesting and enriching courses I 
have ever done. Possibly I wouldn't have got so much from it if I'd studied it 
as a teenager (that may be true of everything...) but I'm really sorry that 
youngsters - and oldsters! - won't get this opportunity now.

‘It helps you to make sense of the world and gives great, life-long joy’

I took Art Higher in Scotland, which has an Art History paper as a compulsory 
20% of the final exam. So Art History has to be studied in Scotland if you are 
to achieve a pass in Art. I enjoyed the Art History aspect of the Art Higher so 
much that I studied Art History at A Level (also in Scotland). Only four of us 
sat Art History A Level but we all went on to use it – two of us went on to 
study it at university (myself included) and the other two went to Art College 
and later became Graphic Designers. It's a fantastic subject – it helps you to 
make sense of the world and gives great, life-long joy. So, of course, is not 
valued in Tory Britain.

‘It was like doing History through a particular lens – you understand much

Snap! I did Art History, English Lang and Lit and Geography. (You didn't do 4 
A levels back then, unless they were three sciences plus maths, on account of 
crossover.) You're right - they complimented each other really well. Art 
History was like doing History through a particular lens. You understand so 
much about humanity by looking at how people present their world.

‘The analytical thinking that is required for these courses are far from soft’

Yeah it is fantastically broad. I'm an Engineer myself but I appreciate art 
and architecture - it goes hand in hand with my profession on many levels.
The questions in the exam are great - they really challenge the student to 
think and engage whilst they draw on their knowledge base, the exam looks 
pretty tiring as each question is almost an essay question!

The analytical thinking that is required for these courses are far from soft - 
they are readily transferable skills. I just think it's sad that this rich 
tapestry of culture is dismissed so easily. These historical works influence 
and shape the world we live in today!

‘I wish the opportunity had been there for me decades ago’

Hard to say anything of value was lost here.

My A-levels onwards, and my subsequent 30-year career, has all been based 
around science and technology. Two months ago I started watching a series of 
lectures from Yale University onRoman Architecture 
<http://oyc.yale.edu/history-art/hsar-252>, part of their Art History course. 
It's been absolutely fascinating and I wish the opportunity had been there 
decades earlier.

When I now walk around town I look at the architectural features of some of 
the older, neo-classical buildings (Lloyds bank!) in an entirely new light. 
Naturally, I am really looking forward to the next time I visit Italy. Yet some 
would say that has no value...

I taught art and design history for several years, not as an individual 
subject but as an essential part of other design courses. Without a clear and 
rigorous understanding of this students are crippled by an inability to not 
only contextualise their work but also are cut off from a rich source of 
knowledge and inspiration. I'm not saying that art history scholarship will 
disappear as a result of this but it is part of a pathway towards that, without 
which our arts and design based businesses, at which we are so good in this 
country, will be all the poorer. A miserable and short-sighted decision.

History of Art is an extraordinarily complex, nuanced subject, requiring 
knowledge of history, philosophy, theology, economics, anthropology and, should 
an individual be interested in psychology, neurology and chemistry a vast array 
of information and insight awaits... the list is endless. How unbelievably 
narrowminded and simple of Gove.

‘My Art History A-level has been with me throughout my life’

Many years ago I took art history, maths and English lit at A level. 
Maths has been useful throughout my life, it has meant that I can manage my 
own finances and understand basic things that I have used regularly such as 
percentages and graphs.
English Lit A level ensured that I have found the so called classic books, at 
best rather dull and for several years after A levels only bothered to read for 
information, I do read a lot, but nothing that would ever be found in an A 
level and still tend towards books that give me information I need.
Art history has been with me throughout my life and has expanded my knowledge 
and understanding enormously and been instrumental in my travels throughout the 
world.
The tories and the idiot gove have much to answer for, they have narrowed 
children and young people's learning and development to a base level where 
reading, writing and science are seen as the be all and end all of achievement 
in their determination to limit individuality and creativity.
After all people who are creative, and innovative are the people who are most 
likely to object to their attempts at a feudal rule.

‘I find all this talk of “hard” or “soft” subject quite ridiculous’

I find all this talk of "hard" or "soft" subject quite ridiculous. Personally 
I found maths an almost trivially easy subject all the way through 'A' levels.

Others find it "hard". Equally, ask me to paint something and you would even 
in my more advanced years something embarrassingly juvenile.

The history of art is an important and fascinating subject and one that should 
be encouraged for those who are interested and capable.

Give kids a rounded education across a broad range of subject up until 16 and 
then let them choose subjects that they both enjoy and are good at. Forcing 17 
year olds to study subjects that they don't enjoy and have no aptitude for is 
pointless.

The vast majority of jobs do not require a rigid educational background; they 
require well adjusted, confident people. An A level in art history can take you 
down that path just as much as anything else.

Studying history of art at school over fifty years ago has given me lifelong 
benefits enhancing my cultural life and providing jumping off points for other 
interests. Trigonometry has never had the same effect.
