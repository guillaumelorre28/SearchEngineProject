Azealia Banks <https://www.theguardian.com/music/azealia-banks> looks set to 
appear in the pages of Playboy magazine. The opinionated rapper took to social 
media site Instagram to announce her upcoming editorial and interview in 
Playboy’s April 2015 music issue.

“Now I can finally tell you, I’ll be on the COVER of @Playboy’s April Music 
Issue!!,” Banks wrote on Twitter, before posting an image in which she appears 
to be strapped into a cat mask of sorts, crouching behind a leopard-print throw.

Playboy’s website has referred 
<http://www.playboy.com/articles/azealia-banks-playboy> to Banks’ shoot as a 
“nude pictorial” and a “frisky pictorial that’s sure to break the internet” – 
no doubt, a reference to Kim Kardashian West’sgreased-up nude photo shoot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/12/kim-kardashians-rear-a-historical-perspective>
 by Jean-Paul Goude, for Paper magazine’s winter issue last year.

The photography spread was shot by veteran Austrian fashion photographer and 
director Ellen von Unwerth, according to Playboy. Von Unwerth has shot a 
multitude of models and celebrities, from Kate Moss and actor Jennifer Lawrence 
to pop stars Rihanna and FKA twigs.


The issue is due to hit US newsstands on 20 March, and will feature an 
interview written by Rob Tannenbaum, music journalist and co-author of MTV oral 
history, I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution.


Last year, Banks surprise-released

 long-awaited album Broke with Expensive Taste on iTunes, after a series of 
disagreements with her record label and former management team.
