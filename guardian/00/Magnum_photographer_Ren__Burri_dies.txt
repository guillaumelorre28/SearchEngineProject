Monday in Zurich aged 81, the Magnum Photo agency said.

Burri, who lived between Zurich and Paris, had been suffering from a long 
illness,Magnum <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/magnum> said.

Martin Parr, president of Magnum Photos, said: “Not only was he one of the 
great postwar photographers, he was also one of the most generous people I have 
had the privilege to meet.”

Burri started working for Magnum in 1956 and covered major political events 
around the world.

Among his most famous works were an iconic portrait of the revolutionary Che 
Guevara smoking a cigar, as well as portraits of Fidel Castro and hundreds of 
pictures of the architect Le Corbusier, and the artistsAlberto Giacometti

He later said that Guevara was “an arrogant man, but he had charm ... He was 
like a tiger in a cage.”

Of photographing celebrities, Burri said: “You must not come at it like a 
bulldozer.”

His friends said he took four years to organise a meeting with Picasso.

After studying at the Arts and Crafts school of Zurich, Burri worked as an 
assistant cameraman for Walt Disney films in Switzerland before joining Magnum.

His first picture, which he took in 1946 when he was 13, was a shot of Winston 
Churchill driving through Zurich in an open-topped car.

He left his archives of some 30,000 pictures to the Musée de l’Élysee in 
Lausanne.
