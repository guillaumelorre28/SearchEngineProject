Get ready for The Cold War: a movie about rival ice cream truckers in Salem, 
Oregon.

The film will be co-produced by American Sniper’s Andrew Lazar and by Joshuah 
Bearman, on whose article the film Argo was based. In 2013, Bearman and 
journalist Joshua Davis set upEpic Magazine <http://epicmagazine.com/>, a 
digital platform for long-form reportage with the potential for film and TV 
syndication.

The Cold War story was first published by Epic 
<http://epicmagazine.com/the-cold-war/>, then featured last year on a popular 
Radiolab podcast. Written by David Wolman and Julian Smith, it tells the tale 
of the feud and reconciliation between American ice-cream seller Dennis Roeper 
and Efrain Escobar, recently moved from Mexico.

What began in 2009 as a straightforward turf war swiftly mushroomed into a 
brutal contest, involving competitive pricing and even arson. Wolman and 
Smith’s piece contextualises the battle within the context of modern 
immigration and job market concerns.

In 1984, Bill Paterson starred in Comfort and Joy, a similarly themed film in 
which he plays a radio host reporting on a Glasgow battle between warring 
Italian ice-cream makers, initiated after one family trashes the other’s van.
