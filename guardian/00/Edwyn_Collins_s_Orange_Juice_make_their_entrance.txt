Orange Juice's influence over indie music is so vast that it's hard to imagine 
how shocking they once seemed, not least to the audiences who reacted to singer 
Edwyn Collins's camp, sardonic delivery with chants of "Poofs! Poofs!". Visibly 
influenced by the Byrds and Creedence Clearwater Revival at a time when punk 
still forbade that kind of thing, and in thrall to Chic when most rock bands 
thought disco sucked, their sound dragged guitar music further from its bluesy 
macho roots than anyone had ever dared before.
