For his third album, Captain Beefheart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/captain-beefheart> signed to Frank Zappa's 
Straight label, having been promised complete artistic freedom. The result was 
Trout Mask Replica, four sides of wild invention that felt improvised, but was 
the product of eight months' intense rehearsal by his Magic Band, under often 
agonising conditions. Lowest-fi Delta blues, beat-poetic scattered logic, 
broken beautiful pop, squawking, jagged jazz-rock – these artful shards 
composed a mosaic whole that has eluded many while profoundly enchanting some. 
Its redrawing of rock's aesthetic frontiers – its fearless freedom – has 
inspired outsider musicians for more than 40 years.
