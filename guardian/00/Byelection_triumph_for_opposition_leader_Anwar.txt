Opposition politician Anwar Ibrahim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-ibrahim> scored a bigger than expected 
victory in a byelection today, boosting his chances of becoming prime minister. 
Anwar, whose campaign for the seat vacated by his wife has been overshadowed by 
allegations of sodomy, which is illegal in Malaysia, won a majority of 15,671 
over his government opponent. He said he would initiate a vote to topple the 
coalition that has ruled for five decades. The margin of victory gives him more 
hope of tempting the 30 government legislators he needs to join his three-party 
coalition to force a confidence vote in parliament.Reuters Permatang Pauh
