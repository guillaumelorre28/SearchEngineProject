Anna Wintour <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour>, the 
editor-in-chief of American Vogue, has apologised for using the phrase “migrant 
chic” to describe a Kanye West fashion show.

During an appearance on the US TV talkshow Late Night with Seth Meyers, 
Wintour discussed pictures of her sitting alone in a VIP area at West’s event 
at Madison Square Garden, in New York where West was debuting his new album,The 
Life of Pablo

, and his Adidas Yeezy season 3 fashion line.


Wintour explained she had arrived early and was “waiting for the Kardashians 
to arrive en masse – and Jay-Z. So, eventually, they did turn up and The Life 
of Pablo concert started and the migrant chic fashion show started and they 
were both wonderful,” she said, in an apparent reference to the clothing on 
show.

She was criticised for her choice of words, with some people posting messages 
on social media. One Twitter user wrote: “Apparently migrant chic is becoming a 
thing in the fashion world. Do we really need to spell out how insensitive that 
is?”

Another tweeted: “Anna Wintour called Yeezy season 3 Migrant Chic. Even though 
Chic is a good thing, the word Migrant can be taken any other ways.”


Following the criticism, she said: “I apologise if my remark was offensive in 
any way. The migrant crisis is real, and I didn’t intend to trivialise that 
issue.”

Last October a photographer took down images he had posted from a fashion 
shoot thattook its inspiration from the scenes of refugees and migrants

 trying to reach Europe.

Speaking to AFP, Norbert Baksa criticised what he called the media’s 
“incomplete” coverage of Europe’s worst migrant crisis since the second world 
war.

He said his shoot, called Der Migrant, was intended to represent what he 
called the ambiguity of the crisis by depicting “someone who is miserable but 
at the same time very beautiful, and who despite the situation owns 
good-quality clothing and a smartphone”.
