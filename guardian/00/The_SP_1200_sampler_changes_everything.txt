The ability to create an entire song on a single piece of kit is now standard 
practice. In 1987, the release of the E-mu SP 1200 made it possible for the 
first time. And portable, too. Decades on, those beats can sound choppy and 
limited. But they're also immediately reminiscent of classic albums such as 
EPMD's Strictly Business and Critical Beatdown by the Ultramagnetic MCs, which 
were born from the SP's chunky buttons. Production of the machine ceased in the 
90s; today it fetches thousands of dollars on eBay.
