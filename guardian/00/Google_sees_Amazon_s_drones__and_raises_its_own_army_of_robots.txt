With Amazon winning headlines (if not universal praise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/02/amazon-drone-delivery-jeff-bezos-hype>
) for its ambitions todeliver packages using drones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/02/amazon-trialling-the-use-of-drones-for-parcel-delivery>
, rival tech giant Google has announced its latest futuristic "moonshot": 
robots.

The initiative is led by Andy Rubin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/andy-rubin>, the former head of 
Google's Android division, who stepped down from that role in March 2013.

Since then, Google has quietly acquired seven robotics companies according to 
the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/technology/google-puts-money-on-robots-using-the-man-behind-android.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&>
, which has published the first interview with Rubin on the company's plans.

"Like any moonshot, you have to think of time as a factor. We need enough 
runway and a 10-year vision," said Rubin, who started his career as a robotics 
engineer at Carl Zeiss, before later roles at Apple, Microsoft and Danger, 
before founding the startup acquired by Google to form the basis forAndroid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android>.

"I have a history of making my hobbies into a career. This is the world’s 
greatest job. Being an engineer and a tinkerer, you start thinking about what 
you would want to build for yourself," Rubin told the New York Times.

The piece suggests Google is focusing more on robots for the manufacturing and 
retail industries, rather than consumer products. Robotics companies acquired by
Google <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> this year include 
Schaft, Industrial Perception, Meka, Redwood Robotics, Bot & Dolly, Autofuss 
and Holomni.

Google is maintaining Schaft's office in Japan, while basing its robotics 
efforts in Palo Alto, California. They will sit alongside the company's 
initiativeto build self-driving cars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/30/google-self-driving-car-unemployment>
, which it hopes to have on the market by 2017.

"The automated car project was science fiction when it started. Now it is 
coming within reach," said Rubin in his interview. "I feel with robotics it’s a 
green field. We’re building hardware, we’re building software. We’re building 
systems, so one team will be able to understand the whole stack."

The seven companies fuelling Google's robot ambitions

Schaft (Japan) <http://schaft-inc.jp/about/?lang=en>
"We, Schaft Inc. create the future where we walk together with humanoid 
robots, through research and development, manufacture and sales of humanoid 
robots."

Industrial Perception (US) <http://www.industrial-perception.com/>
"A leader in 3D vision-guided robot technology and enables industrial robots 
to assume challenging logistical tasks such as truck and container unloading, 
e-commerce fulfillment and package sorting."

Meka (US) <http://mekabot.com/>
"A provider of world-class robotic systems for researchers. At Meka we develop 
human-safe, human-soft, and human-scale robot technologies that will enable the 
robots of tomorrow to work alongside people in the home and the workplace."

Redwood Robotics (US) <http://redwoodrobotics.com/>
"Our robotic arms are simple to teach, affordable, and safe to operate around 
humans. Redwood manipulators will make professionals more productive, reduce 
the stress of dull and repetitive tasks, and allow manufacturers and service 
providers alike to respond flexibly to ever-changing market needs."

Bot & Dolly (US) <http://www.botndolly.com/>
"Bot & Dolly is a design and engineering studio that specialises in 
automation, robotics, and filmmaking. It's our mission to advance motion 
control and automation as a creative medium, and build world-class tools that 
enable others to do the same."

Autofuss (US) <http://www.autofuss.com/studio>
"We thrive on being a hub of creative collaboration by colliding visual 
artists with programmers, engineers with designers, storytellers with 
illustrators, architects with machinists." (Autofuss is the outlier here, being 
a creative agency rather than a robotics company – but according to the NYT 
piece, it's part of Rubin's robotics plans).

Holomni (US) <http://www.holomni.com/>
"Holomni powered caster modules create a holonomic omnidirectional vehicle. A 
Holomni-powered vehicle can instantaneously produce omnidirectional 
accelerations and forces."
