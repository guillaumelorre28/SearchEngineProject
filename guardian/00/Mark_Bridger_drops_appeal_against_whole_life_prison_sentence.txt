The man convicted of the murder of five-year-old April Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/april-jones> has abandoned his application for 
permission to appeal against his whole-life tariff.

The move by Mark Bridger was confirmed on Monday yesterday by the Judicial 
Office.

Bridger kidnapped the child before sexually abusing her, murdering her and 
disposing of her body.

The former slaughterhouse worker was given the whole-life sentence by trial 
judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams after he was convicted by a jury at Mold 
crown court.

It was originally thought that Bridger's appeal bid would be heard by leading 
judges at the court of appeal in London on 24 January.

Bridger, a father of six, snatched April near her home in Machynlleth, 
mid-Wales, on 1 October 2012. Her body has never been found.

Sentencing <https://www.theguardian.com/law/sentencing> Bridger in May, 
Williams said: "There is no doubt in my mind that you are a paedophile who has 
for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls."

He said Bridger had abducted April for a "sexual purpose" after he had been 
jilted by his girlfriend, and then murdered the schoolgirl and disposed of her 
body to "hide the evidence of your sexual abuse of her".

Police believe Bridger dismembered April before dumping her body parts at 
various locations in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding his home in 
Ceinws, mid-Wales. Traces of her blood were found all over his rented cottage.

The judge said: "How you disposed of her body must remain a mystery. It will 
serve no purpose for me to speculate as to what happened but all the 
indications are that you burned at least a part of her in the wood burner."

Fewer than 50 other criminals in the UK have been handed sentences which mean 
they must spend the rest of their lives behind bars.

Others serving whole-life terms include the Moors murderer Ian Brady, who 
tortured and murdered children along with accomplice Myra Hindley.
