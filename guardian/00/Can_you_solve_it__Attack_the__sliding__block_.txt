Hello guzzlers,

The sliding block puzzle was one of the earliest puzzle crazes 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle>. It is still popular as a toy for kids
 <http://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/> and as a cheesy branded giveaway 
<http://www.impact-uk.com/promotional/Puzzles/18/64/Personalised-Promotional-Square-Sliding-Puzzle-Logo-Printed>
.

So, I’m assuming you know what to do. Pieces are in a grid and you must slide 
them between each other without picking them up.

The sliding block puzzle below contains four pieces: 1, 2, 3 and T. Your 
challenge is to move the piece marked T to the bottom right corner in five moves
.

 T party. 
A move consists of taking a piece and sliding it to a new position. For 
example, if you wanted to move the 1 piece, you could slide it down one square, 
as illustrated below left, or you could move it as far as it could go, below 
right. Or you could move it to any of the other five available positions in 
between.

 Sliders. 
Go on. Five moves to put T in the corner. I’ll be back at 5pm BST with the 
solution.
