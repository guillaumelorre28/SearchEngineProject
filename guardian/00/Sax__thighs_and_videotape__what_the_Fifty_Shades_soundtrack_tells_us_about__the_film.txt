With less than a month to go until its release, a few scant details are 
starting to trickle through about the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. Thetrailer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/25/fifty-shades-of-grey-watch-the-trailer-video>
 taught us that Jamie Dornan will spend most of the film staring blankly 
through panes of glass. The MPAA taught us that the film will contain some
“unusual behaviour” 
<http://uk.eonline.com/news/612181/fifty-shades-of-grey-dodges-nc-17-bullet-is-officially-rated-r>
. But there’s still so much left that we don’t know.


For example, how graphic will its sex scenes be? How slight will Rita Ora’s 
role be? Will it be as wildly popular as the books? How many times during the 
film will Dakota Johnson say “Holy crap”? Ten? Twenty? More than that? We just 
don’t know.

 Thankfully, Republic Records has just leapt to our rescue, revealing the 
tracklist 
<http://www.people.com/article/fifty-shades-of-grey-movie-soundtrack-beyonce-sia>
to the official Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. Each song on the soundtrack is 
its own little clue about the film. Hopefully, by putting them together, we’ll 
be able to unlock the mystery of Fifty Shades of Grey. Let’s delve inside …

 1. I Put a Spell on You – Annie Lennox

A good start. If Demi Moore’s 1996 erotic comedy Striptease demonstrated 
anything – apart from the fact that a Demi Moore erotic comedy couldn’t be any 
less sexy if it starred 400 crying babies in an abattoir – it’s thatAnnie Lennox
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/annie-lennox> is the go-to artist when it 
comes to soundtracking nudity.

 2. Undiscovered – Laura Welsh

The sort of thing you’d hear in scenes set in swingers clubs in 
straight-to-DVD softcore thrillers from the mid-90s. But why Undiscovered? 
Could it be alluding to Anastasia Steele’s undiscovered perversions? Or could 
it be alluding to the state of all the unsoldFifty Shades of Grey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/fifty-shades-of-grey> DVDs in bargain bins 
across the country six months from now?

 3. Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey) – The Weeknd

 The first line goes: “You make it look like it’s magic / Cause I see nobody, 
nobody but you”. This almost definitely means that Paul Daniels is going to pop 
up at some point, possibly dressed as an elf in a sex dungeon somewhere.

 4. Meet Me in the Middle – Jessie Ware

So far, I’m starting to think that the entire Fifty Shades of Grey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey> movie is going to be 
set in a branch of Foxtons.


 5. Love Me Like You Do – Ellie Goulding

 Ellie Goulding is most famous for informing you of distances on the Nike 
running app. Perhaps she’ll do the same here. “You lasted one hour and 13 
minutes before nipping off to the toilet to Google the term ‘spreader bar’.”

 6. Haunted (Michael Diamond remix) – Beyoncé

<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXTNs5038lDk&picture=>

Originally slated for the forthcoming sequel 50 Shades 2: The Legend of the 
Ghost-Dildo.


 7. Salted Wound – Sia

 Included because wounds are very sexy and BDSM-y. And also because salt is a 
vital component of wintertime road safety. Christian Grey might like tying 
girls up, but he’s nothing if not a responsible driver.

 8. Beast of Burden – The Rolling Stones
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-tRdBsnX4N4&picture=>

 From the scene where Anastasia Steele’s parents get drunk and pretend that 
they’re still teenagers and everyone just stands around looking embarrassed.

 9. I’m on Fire – AWOLNATION

<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dq_5aMYxbgV8&picture=>

 “Hey little girl, is your daddy home?” it goes, presumably because there 
isn’t already enough in this film to make audiences pull a face like they’ve 
just sniffed a tray of putrid meat.

 10. Crazy in Love (2014 Remix) – Beyoncé

The song from all the trailers. It’s basically a glimpse into a horrible 
alternate universe whereBeyoncé <https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> got 
famous by singing songs on adverts for manky aftershaves called things like 
Tusk.

 11. Witchcraft – Frank Sinatra

 From the scene where Anastasia Steele’s grandparents get drunk and pretend 
that they’re still teenagers and everyone just stands around looking 
embarrassed.

 12. One Last Night – Vaults

The big mystery. No videos exist of this song on YouTube, nor are any lyrics 
available online. I think this means it’s essentially just Yakety Sax.


13. Where You Belong – The Weeknd

<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuAd8pDQKplg&picture=>

 Where it belongs is, of course, on Movies 24 at about 2am on a Tuesday after 
a broadcast of Confessions of a Window Cleaner.

14. I Know You – Skylar Grey

 Sounds even more like the sort of thing you’d hear in scenes set in swingers 
clubs in straight-to-DVD softcore thrillers from the mid-nineties. Is Fifty 
Shades of Grey supposed to be set in the 1990s? Genuine question.

 15. Ana and Christian – Danny Elfman

And finally, two tracks by composer Danny Elfman. Wouldn’t it be great if this 
was just a straight copy of his Willy Wonka song?

16. “Did That Hurt?” – Danny Elfman

You have no idea.
