With new promoters Mean Fiddler keen to erase memories of everyone from Meat 
Loaf to Bonnie Tyler getting bottled the year before, in 1989 the Reading 
festival undertook a dramatic change of direction and shed its reputation as 
the home of muddy rock. Kicking off with a Friday night featuring the 
Sugarcubes, Spacemen 3 and headlined byNew Order 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/neworder>, curtain-fringed indie kids were 
spoilt throughout the weekend as bands including My Bloody Valentine, Jesus 
Jones and Loop showed the way forward. Stalwarts grumbled, but tickets sold out 
and rock never had the same hold over Reading again.
