Whether you plump for Polly Morgan's mafia-style greeting or Michael 
Craig-Martin'sChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> 
cornucopia, there are many ways in which you can send your G2 Christmas cards. 
You could go for the Blue Peter style and just cut them out from the pages of 
G2, stick them on to card and send. Or you can either:

Tweet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/06/christmas-cards-twitter> 

Just click the "tweet" button next to the image of your choice, add a message 
and tweet it @ your intended recipient. The image will appear in theirTwitter 
<http://twitter.com/> stream.

Post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/14/artists-christmas-cards-print>

You can print the images (which are in PDF form) on to paper or card, fold 
them where we've indicated and send them. G2 is not responsible for the 
non-arrival of any well-considered greetings.

Email 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2010/dec/14/artists-christmas-cards>



Click the "send to a friend" email icon, add a message and a link to all six 
images will appear in your loved one's inbox.

And then . . .

If you think that you can do better yourself, why not send us your own, 
brilliantly designed cards. You can email your designs to
your.pictures@theguardian.com <mailto:your.pictures@theguardian.com>, or upload 
them to our Flickr site at flickr.com/groups/christmascards 
<http://www.flickr.com/groups/christmascards>. The best designs will be 
published in G2 before Christmas.

You can also share the images via Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/> and 
other social networking sites. Happy Christmas everybody!
