A few years ago, former Bauhaus <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bauhaus> 
frontman Pete Murphy slammed the phone down on a journalist who kept mentioning 
the word "goth". If he didn't like the tag, he only had himself to blame. The 
Northampton band's debut single seemed an improbable template for other bands 
to follow: a gloomy descending bassline repeating for the best part of 10 
minutes, with a drum pattern and a preponderance of echoing effects evidently 
derived from dub reggae, topped with jaggedly abstract guitar noise. Bela 
Lugosi's Dead would have been just another piece of post-punk experimentation 
had it not been for the lyrics, which depicted the funeral of the Dracula star, 
with bats swooping and virgin brides marching past his coffin. The crowning 
glory was Murphy's preposterous vocal, which wobbles along the line that 
separates high drama from "Woo! Behind you!" The effect was so irresistibly 
theatrical that dozens of bands formed in its wake. So many, in fact, that goth 
quickly became a very codified musical genre.
