Quiz and list publishing platform PlayBuzz has announced it has raised $16m 
(£11m) in venture capital funding to drive international expansion.

The second funding round, led by VC firm North83, takes the Israeli-based 
company’s total funding to more than $18m.

A statement announcing the round said the money will be used to help relocate 
the company’s HQ to New York and open new offices in Asia and Europe.

PlayBuzz attracts more than 80 million unique visitors a month and is 
consistently ranked as the most-shared publisher on Facebook by social 
analytics firm NewsWhip, ahead of socially focused publishers such as BuzzFeed 
and Huffington Post.

However, unlike its competitors it relies mainly on users and other publishers 
including theDaily Telegraph <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailytelegraph> 
and AOL to create content, and does not employ a large team of editorial staff.

minister Ehud Olmert,told Business Insider

: “If you look at YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, really the only way to grow is to 
be an open platform ... there’s only so much great content one publisher can 
produce. It’s about being the underlying platform.”

83North partner Arnon Dinur has joined PlayBuzz’s board as part of the 
investment. He said in a statement: “PlayBuzz’s dramatic growth and fast 
adoption points to the market’s thirst for a scalable platform to create viral 
audience engagement. We are thrilled to invest in this category leader, whose 
meteoric rise in popularity has made it the destination of choice for 
publishers seeking to engage today’s always-connected, always-evolving digital 
audiences.”
