The mermaid has been liberated. To a chorus of online derision, Starbucks has 
subtly changed its brand identity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/05/starbucks-rebranding-new-face-drops-mugs>
 by removing the words "Starbucks" and "coffee" from its distinctive green 
logo. The icon, on coffee cups and stores around the world, will merely 
comprise a smiling siren, wearing a crown, in a circle.

Customers are not amused. On Starbucks's official Facebook page, hundreds of 
fans informed the company that its new logo "sucks". In the US, the Fox News 
website opined that the change was a "dumb idea" and compared it to the rock 
star Prince's declaration in 1993 that he was abandoning his name in favour of 
an unpronounceable symbol.

The change is not entirely stupid. It can be seen as a sign of Starbucks's 
ambition. Andrew Collins, director of the branding agency 1HQ, said it put the 
coffee chain in a select category of companies so well known that a nameless 
logo was sufficient for recognition. Nike, Apple and Playboy are among the few 
to get away with this. Starbucks's chairman, Howard Schultz, no doubt feels 
this could help as the chain expands into countries that not only have a 
different language but a different alphabet.

Careful footwork is essential. The clothes chain Gap recently scrapped a new 
logo when its customers gave it a thumbs-down.Starbucks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/starbucks> has become so deeply 
intertwined in the daily routine of millions that the slightest of alterations 
causes spluttering.
