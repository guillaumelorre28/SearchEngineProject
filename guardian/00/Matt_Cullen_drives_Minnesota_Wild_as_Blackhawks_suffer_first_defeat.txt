Matt Cullen scored 90 seconds into the game and again in a shootout to lift the
Minnesota Wild to a 3-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday, 
handing Chicago their first loss in seven games this season.

Cullen's snap shot in the third round slipped between Corey Crawford's legs, 
and Patrick Sharp then hit the crossbar for Chicago. The Blackhawks and San 
Jose were the only teams to start 6-0 this year. The Wild improved to 4-1 at 
home.

Goals by Andrew Shaw and Jonathan Toews early in the first period prompted the 
Wild to pull goalie Josh Harding for Niklas Backstrom. Cal Clutterbuck also 
scored for the Wild, and Backstrom stopped all 28 shots he saw.

Roberto Luongo made 24 saves for his first win of the season as the Vancouver 
Canucks blanked the Colorado Avalanche 3-0. Jason Garrison and Max Lapierre 
each scored for the first time this season and Zack Kassian picked up his fifth 
goal in seven games.

The Edmonton Oilers fought back after giving up a goal late in regulation as 
Nail Yakupov scored a power-play goal at 3:52 of overtime in a 2-1 win over the
Phoenix Coyotes. Lennart Petrell scored his first goal since 27 February for 
the Oilers, but Nick Johnson whipped a shot past Devan Dubnyk's glove side with 
19 seconds left in regulation. Yakupov ended it in overtime, punching in a 
rebound after a shot by Ryan Whitney caromed off teammate Taylor Hall.

The Ottawa Senators downed the Montreal Canadiens 5-1 as Daniel Alfredsson 
scored his first goal of the season. Jim O'Brien, Mika Zibanejad, Chris 
Phillips and Chris Neil also scored for the Senators, and Craig Anderson had 31 
saves in his 300th career game. Tomas Plekanec scored for Montreal.
