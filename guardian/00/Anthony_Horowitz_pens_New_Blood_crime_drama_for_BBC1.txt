The creator of Foyle’s War, Anthony Horowitz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthony-horowitz>, is moving into modern 
times with a new crime drama set in present-day London.

The writer, who is currently working on a new James Bond novel, has signed up 
with theBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> for the show called New 
Blood.

The drama, described as showing “modern London through the eyes of two 
outsiders”, is about two young investigators brought together by two seemingly 
unrelated cases.

Horowitz, whose writing credits include Midsomer Murders, Robin Of Sherwood 
and the Alex Rider novels, said: “For a long time I’ve been wondering how to 
take a fresh approach to crime drama and I hope that with New Blood I’ve 
succeeded.

“This is a show about the so-called Y generation … young people starting out 
in their careers, the powerless against the powerful. It’s so refreshing to be 
writing about two central characters who are still in their late twenties and 
21st-century London is the perfect setting.”

The seven-part series will be shown on BBC1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc1> .

Horowitz called time on Foyle’s War earlier this year after more than a 
decade, saying the ITV show had run its course.

Michael Kitchen played MI5 senior intelligence officer Christopher Foyle since 
the series began in 2002, taking in the second world war and the cold war along 
the way.
