What do you bring home with you from holiday? Wacky shirts? Some local booze? 
For Brit DJs Nicky Holloway, Paul Oakenfold, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker, 
it was a whole musical way of life that was to revitalise youth culture for 
years to come. They spent the summer of 1987 soaking up the sun and uplifting 
balearic "anything goes" attitude played by DJ Alfredo, the resident at Ibiza's 
Amnesia club. They took the party back home with them, and acid house was born.
