Archie Bland condemns the use of extreme language in political debate. (How 
the language of politics turned toxic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/how-did-the-language-of-politics-get-so-toxic>
, G2, 1 August). Quite right, particularly if it threatens individuals with 
physical or mental harm. However, disrespectful attacks are not new.Nye Bevan 
referred to the Tories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/1948/jul/05/leadersandreply.mainsection> as 
“lower than vermin” when they were opposing the creation of the NHS. Language 
does not create social reality, it reflects it. Our fragmented, unequal lives, 
driven by technology, push us to articulate our views in an abrupt, 
Twitter-influenced manner, in order to create maximum effect and evoke a 
response.

Military analogies may cause a shudder on the liberal left as being 
inappropriate, but at least they have the virtue of being understood, unlike 
the opaque jargon of NewLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
and corporate Britain. While unfailingly respectful, it is often deceitful. 
George Orwell categorised similar efforts as “the great enemy of clear 
language”, and “like a cuttlefish spurting out ink”.

• Archie Bland writes that the legend on a T-shirt worn by an elderly man 
saying “Eradicate the rightwing Blairite vermin” will have drawn a shudder from 
anyone familiar with the tropes of antisemitism and anti-immigrant prejudice. 
Bland is clearly too young to remember an earlier political use of the term 
“vermin”. I recall, as a child in 1948, the excitement when Aneurin Bevan said 
of the Tories that “they are lower than vermin”. Children were enrolled into 
the Vermin Club which, as far as I can remember, was intended to raise funds 
for the Tory party.

• How puzzling to read a few thousand words from Archie Bland on violence in 
politics with no mention of a single violent policy. Could escalating 
violence in our lives be related to devastating austerity?Thousands of people 
declared fit for work have died 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/27/thousands-died-after-fit-for-work-assessment-dwp-figures>
. Perhaps the aggressive policing of our borders, with multiple deaths in 
detention, in camps at the UK’s edges or in boats in the Mediterranean has 
desensitised us?

And how can Bland argue that female leaders contribute less to violent 
rhetoric with a straight face when just weeks ago Theresa Maycommitted herself 
to the use of nuclear weapons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/18/theresa-may-takes-aim-at-jeremy-corbyn-over-trident-renewal>
? She did not yell “traitor” or “vermin”, but she did more violence with her 
simple yes than any tweet I’ve seen recently. Rather than pretend reality is 
composed of “violent” words devoid of context, Bland could ask who is dying, 
where, how and why.

• A big “thank you” to Bland for his excellent and timely piece. It should be 
required reading for all politicians and political activists.

• It is generally believed that the Thatcher government prepared for the 
1984-85 miners’ strike with the clear intention of smashing a strong trade 
union and thus weakening irrevocably all other organised workers’ institutions. 
The consequences of that government victory can be seen to this day, and played 
no little part in the disillusionment of those in Britain’s depressed towns and 
regions. They are now referred to as “the left behind”, and it is said they 
contributed greatly to the Brexit vote.

In your obituary of John Lyons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/14/john-lyons-obituary> (1 
August), leader of the Electrical Power Engineers Association at the time of 
the strike, you quote him as saying: “The EPEA could have won the dispute for 
Scargill without lifting a finger if we had decided to back him.” They didn’t, 
and the miners – and the greater trade union movement – suffered the 
consequences.

Yet, in the first line of the obituary, you refer to Lyons as “a moderate 
trade union leader”. In what sense could a union leader’s refusal to support 
another group of workers, in a struggle that was pre-planned by the government 
as a chance to break the power of organised labour, and which had all the 
social consequences described so vividly in your pages over the years, be 
considered a “moderate” act?

Acts of omission can surely be as immoderately cruel in their consequences as 
acts of commission; and violent metaphors are clearly not the only forms of 
language that can distort rational political discourse in the UK.

• Angela Eagle approves Owen Smith’s apology for his recent sexist comments 
about Theresa May (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/29/angela-eagle-ive-heard-cruel-words-i-know-language-matters-labour-leadership-owen-smith>
, 30 July) and recommends “sensitive use of language”. But, like earlier 
“gaffes” by David Cameron (“Calm down, dear 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/27/david-cameron-calm-down-dear>
”, to her), Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, et al, these are not mere linguistic 
misdemeanours.

Such comments expose these men’s lingering racism, homophobia and/or misogyny. 
For the Labour party to think an MP who exhibits such attitudes is fit for 
office, never mind being considered as leadership material, is beyond belief. 
And, as reported elsewhere, this man has form.

So, at last Saturday’s gay pride celebrations in Liverpool, there was Smith 
having his photo taken with as many women as he could fling his arm around. He 
really needed to be seen mingling with gay activists and other non “normals” 
(having described himself as the “normal” candidate – heterosexual, married 
with kids – as opposed to Eagle, “the gay candidate”).

The acceptance of Smith as a leadership candidate confirms that the entwined 
issues of racism, misogyny and homophobia as legitimate political targets for 
Labour (as important as social class and poverty) and as serious issues for the 
culture of the Labour party and the unions still have a way to go.

Also, the latest smear against Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>, the claim that before he 
became leader there were no such problems, is laughable, mendacious and 
vindictive.

• The Guardian’s editorial position and basic line on Corbyn since he became 
party leader is that he is awkward, feeble, uncharismatic, laughably 
media-unsavvy and frighteningly unfit to take the Labour party into the next 
election.

Yet your columnist Hadley Freedman (From Labour’s hard left to Donald Trump, 
it’s been the summer of the personality cult 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-labour-personality-cult-hadley-freeman>
, Weekend, 30 July) accuses “hard left” leader Corbyn of inspiring a “cult of 
personality” (presumably as opposed to someone who’s able to offer inspiring 
ideas and principles) among his dazzled “worshippers”.

So which is it? Is Corbyn The Hopeless Nebbish or Charles Manson in a Corduroy 
Jacket? Please clarify, for the record!
