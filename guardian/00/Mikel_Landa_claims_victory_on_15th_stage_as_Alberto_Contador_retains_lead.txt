Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> 
strengthened his grip on the Maglia Rosa on Sunday, finishing third behind race 
winner Mikel Landa on stage 15 of the Giro d’Italia.

Astana’s 25-year-old Landa passed Katusha’s Yuri Tofimov on the closing stages 
of the 165km mountain course between Marostica and Madonna di Campiglio before 
crossing the line in a time of 4hr 22.35min.

It was Landa’s first Grand Tour victory, with Tofimov close on his heels and 
Contador five seconds behind the winner.

That placing saw Spain’s Tinkoff Saxo rider increase his overall lead by seven 
seconds over Landa’s team-mate Fabio Aru.

Landa, who is 4:46 down on Contador in fourth, said: “It’s an important win 
for me and the team, because when you work the way we have today, a win like 
this belongs to everyone.

“ Our objective is to put Aru in the best possible position in GC. We want 
first place with him.”

Contador also praised Astana.

“They were very strong today: it was like a team time trial with me on their 
wheel,” he said.

“My legs were good today but there were lots of attacks and counterattacks and 
it was impossible to control all of them.”
