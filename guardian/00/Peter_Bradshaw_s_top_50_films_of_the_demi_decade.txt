As far as actors are concerned, the first five years of the 2010s proved that 
you can’t make it big unless you’re prepared to get into the Lycra and stride 
around in front of the greenscreen. This has been the demi-decade of the 
superhero, coming alongside genres like sci-fi and fantasy. Perhaps it’s 
surprising that it didn’t happen long ago and that, until very recently, only 
three or four A-list superheroes were being consistently reinvented in 
franchise properties. Now there are dozens, with the Marvel stable a powerhouse 
of profitable movies.

In the past five years, we have also seen the emergence of a recognisable new 
genre, young adult, drawn from colossal multi-volume bestsellers targeted at 
teens: these fanbases are formidably loyal, intelligent, opinionated, with a 
sense of self and identity; the product driven by social media. The authors 
reach out to the fans through Twitter; the fans amass considerable followings 
of their own; they go on fan-fiction sites, self-publish and some become 
players themselves. And the movie studios have to react like lightning to a big 
new product before its fans outgrow it, but they have to be careful to bring 
the fans along with them, with visits to Comic Con and the like. YA has assumed 
distinctive characteristics in stories like Harry Potter, Hunger Games, 
Twilight, Divergent and Maze Runner: the heroes and heroines are smart, 
essentially celibate or pre-sexual but intensely romantic, not interested in 
smart-ass irony, burdened with a sense of apartness and destiny.

 Queen of YA … Shailene Woodley in Divergent. Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk/PR 
The quintessential YA heroine is Shailene Woodley, who made her name as George 
Clooney’s tricky teen daughter in The Descendants and then hit the big time in 
two massive YA pictures: The Fault in Our Stars and Divergent. Woodley is a 
thoroughly modern YA heroine: smart, cute, but not sexy exactly – lonely, 
vulnerable, but with inner strength that will be tested and found far from 
wanting. It all connects with the escapist yearning of the readers who will 
become consumer-fans of the film versions.Then there’s the “documentary surge”. 
There has been a growing market for non-fiction feature films that come out on 
many platforms: theatrical and download. But documentaries can have a real life 
in the cinema. Joshua Oppenheimer’sThe Act of Killing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-act-of-killing> ran for a year at 
London’s ICA cinema, an unheard-of achievement. And the rise of services like 
Netflix shows that people are prepared to pay for (as opposed to pirate) niche 
movies like this.

As far as production goes, the most extraordinary development of the last five 
years is surely the rise of crowdfunding with sites like Kickstarter and 
Indiegogo. Previously, we had all assumed that web 2.0 was all about people 
working very, very hard for no money. Now Kickstarter has proved that web 
activity can be alchemised into actual hard cash. Paul Schrader’s The Canyons 
was an example of a crowdfunded film; its screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis says 
that in future all films will made like this, sold to iTunes and then the 
creators will move on to the next project. Perhaps he’s right.

As far as international arthouse movie trends go, it’s difficult to tell. 
Romanian and Greek waves have come and – perhaps – gone. German and Austrian 
film-makers have made an impression. Hardcore “extreme” cinema from the far 
east seems to be in abeyance. South Asian cinema continues not to be especially 
fashionable, and periodic revivals of Satyajit Ray demonstrate that we in the 
west are not as receptive to Indian cinema as in the past.

In Britain, there is a good deal to be happy about. We have seen a major new 
artist and film-maker in the form of Steve McQueen, who has made a remarkable 
career transition to movie director, with his Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave. 
There has been a very exciting new wave of independent directors: Andrea 
Arnold, Carol Morley, Clio Barnard and Joanna Hogg, who have challenged the 
gender stereotype of the director as the Guy In Charge. Ben Wheatley and Chris 
Morris have scored great successes, and writers-turned-directors Iain Morris 
and Damon Beesley scored another colossal and indeed critical triumph with 
their Inbetweeners 2: Morris and Beesley look like joining Edgar Wright and 
Richard Aoyade in the ranks of TV comics who made the shift to cinema.

Here is my demi-decade top 50 …

 Enigmatic … The Headless Woman Photograph: Everett/Rex 
A brilliant, disturbing film from Argentina about guilt, denial and the return 
of the repressed. A woman from Buenos Aires’s upper-middle classes hits 
something or someone in her car. An enigmatic coverup begins.

 Opaque … Samson and Delilah. Photograph: Everett/Rex 
A love story of the most challenging and opaque kind between two Aboriginal or 
Indigenous Australians: Samson and Delilah. Both are living painful lives of 
poverty and vulnerability, but somehow their love, or companionship, or simple 
solidarity in the face of life’s woes allows them to carry on.

 Delirious … Kick-Ass. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
Brutal, delirious and drenched in execrable taste, this comic-book fantasy of 
homemade super-heroism is an explosion of energy and provocation. Nicolas Cage 
gives a terrific performance as a paternal masked crimefighter.

stylised, disturbing essays in dysfunction and tragedy. It is a macabre black

The last and arguably the greatest of the Toy Stories – and the moment at

accepting that one’s children will grow up and grow away.

 Deranged … Enter the Void 
A magnificently deranged display of delirum from the great enfant terrible of

 Dreamlike … Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. 
This gentle, dreamlike, magical film from Thailand won the Palme d’Or at 
Cannes. A dying man comes to the remote northern forest to end his days and 
commune with previous lives and the spirit presences of nature. An absolutely 
beguiling film.

Animal Kingdom (dir. David Michôd)
 Cracking … Animal Kingdom. 
David Michôd revived the great memories of Ozploitation with this cracking 
contemporary drama-thriller, about a dysfunctional crime family in blue-collar 
gangland Melbourne. Guy Pearce and Ben Mendelsohn give brutally potent 
performances.

 Tense … How I Ended This Summer 
A tense, mysterious dramatic two-hander from Russia: two men on an isolated 
meteorological research station in the Russian arctic find themselves in an 
unbearable situation. It’s a movie that deserves to be better known.

 Superlative … The Four Seasons 
A superlative, almost wordless film from Italy. An old shepherd in Calabria 
tends his flock of goats; the sun rises and sets; the animals roam; the shadows 
move. A film to melt the heart.

alternative to girly-simpery romcoms with this uproarious movie about all the

 Classic … A Separation. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
With this Iranian drama, Asghar Farhadi established himself as an auteur in 
the tradition of Antonioni and Haneke – and his film looks increasingly like a 
classic. When an unhappy couple break up, the fracture exposes the fault-lines 
of Iranian society. Masterly.

 Rhapsody … The Tree of Life. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
The reclusive master emerged from his long period of silence with this 
colossal rhapsody of cosmic images and dramatic themes which some found 
indulgent and others compelling. Brad Pitt gives a great performance as the 
stern 50s Texan father.

Kill List (dir. Ben Wheatley)
 Dreamy fear … Kill List 
Ben Wheatley was a new British talent who broke out in the previous decade, 
moving from obscurity to a powerful position in British cinema. His Kill List 
is disturbingly unclassifiable: a horror-comedy in a dreamy arthouse-realist 
style, overlaid with dreamy fear.

 Remarkable … Poetry. Photograph: Everett/Rex 
A remarkable meditation on ageing and memories from Korean auteur Lee 
Chang-dong. A delicate, shy sixtysomething finds that in the evening of her 
life she must bear a terrible burden: her troubled teen grandson has disgraced 
the family and she finds herself suffering from memory loss. A beautifully 
acted piece of work.

This visceral and challenging adaptation of Emily Brontë’s novel divided 
opinion at the time, but its sheer audacity is thrilling. It has a pre-literary 
reality: it looks like the raw series of events on which the book might have 
been based.

 Superb … Margaret. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
Lonergan achieved cult status with this superb personal drama starring Anna 
Paquin. It reached the screen after years of studio wrangling, while a 
grassroots social-media campaign got it a wide cinema release. Now it looks 
like a modern classic.

Dreams of a Life (dir. Carol Morley)
 Deeply moving … Dreams of a Life 
Carol Morley established herself as one of Britain’s most exciting new talents 
with this deeply moving documentary: a study of modern loneliness, centring on 
the mystery of a young woman whose dead body lay undiscovered in a council flat 
for three years.

 Silent tribute … The Artist. Photograph: EPA 
A wonderful tribute to the age of silent cinema, itself silent and in 
black-and-white, starring Jean Dujardin as a Douglas Fairbanks-style star who 
can’t adapt to the talkies. The movie had something to say, by implication, 
about modern media adapting to the web.

 Touching study … Amour. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
The great Austrian film-maker brought a kind of moral grandeur to bear on this 
almost unbearably moving and touching study of an ageing couple, played by 
Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, who face hard choices when one 
suffers a stroke.

 Majestic … Leviathan 
Zvyagintsev is the pre-eminent Russian director, and this film is a majestic 
and commanding indictment of the Russian Putinstan: a perfect storm of 
reactionary clerics, cynical lawyers and gangster-rich politicians.

 Riveting … Once Upon a Time in Anatolia 
Ceylan is the Turkish film-maker who had steadily amassed a reputation over 
almost 20 years, and took last year’s Palme d’Or for Winter Sleep. But Anatolia 
is his masterpiece: a massive, slow-moving but riveting drama of violence and 
its aftermath.

 Courageous … This Is Not A Film 
This courageous documentary is a samizdat document about the Iranian 
government’s quasi-Soviet attempt to quash artist dissidents. Director and 
pro-democracy activist Jafar Panahi has been subject to a 20-year ban on 
film-making: this film about his life had to be smuggled out of the country.

 Stoner fantasy … Ted. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
Seth MacFarlane disgraced himself with a clownish turn at the Oscars. Even 
before this, his stoner fantasy comedyTed <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ted>
 got some grumpy reactions from broadsheet critics, but it is very funny: a 
misanthropic study of kidulthood, about a guy whose teddy bear grew up with him.

 Startling … The Act of Killing. Photograph: Drafthouse Films /REX 
This documentary is about the ageing generation of killers and gangsters who 
enforced Suharto’s brutal anti-communist rule in 1960s Indonesia. Startlingly 
and controversially, Oppenheimer persuaded the unrepentant killers to re-stage 
their crimes in the style of old movies: a Marat/Sade nightmare of tyranny.

 Ultraviolent … Only God Forgives. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
Refn’s study of ultraviolent revenge in Bangkok, starring Ryan Gosling and 
Kristin Scott Thomas, was mocked when it appeared at Cannes, but its formal, 
lethal brilliance gives it a radioactive pulp potency. An outstanding, and much 
misunderstood film.

 Family drama … I Wish. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
The spirit of Ozu and family drama is revived in this lovely, delicate movie 
from the Japanese master Kore-eda: two nine-year-old brothers are forced to 
live apart when their parents split, taking one son each. The children plot to 
be reunited in a movie to melt the heart.

 Devastatingly impressive … The Selfish Giant 
Clio Barnard followed her experimental “verbatim cinema” drama-doc The Arbor 
with a devastatingly impressive, conventional movie in the poetic, 
social-realist vein – a modern variation on the Oscar Wilde short story. Two 
kids bring stolen goods to a scrap-metal dealer in the unenchanted garden of 
his yard.

with allegations about his private life, Woody Allen came back with one of his 
best films, starring Cate Blanchett as the socialite forced to come to terms 
with poverty.

 Artistry … Winter of Discontent 
There is remarkable technique and artistry, as well as raw anger, in this 
compelling movie about the 2011 uprising in Egypt and Tahrir Square. Arguably 
the best feature about the much debated Arab spring.

 Dizzying … Django Unchained. Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex 
This demi-decade was the period in which this film-maker left behind his 
enfant terrible status and became almost an elder statesman: his pulp satire 
about slavery was a brilliant and dizzying adventure showing no one can deliver 
the crazy opiate of cinema like Tarantino.

Frozen (dirs. Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee)
 Addictive … Frozen. Photograph: Disney/Everett/Rex 
Families with daughters find that they are playing the DVD over and over and 
over again. This Disney musical based on The Snow Queen was an animation in the 
classic style, with the most addictively hummable original tunes we’ve heard at 
the movies for ages. What a joy.

Tarantino gave us a black comedy; Britain’s Steve McQueen directed a tragedy 
based on Solomon Northup’s memoir and changed the way slavery is commemorated 
and debated in America. A great performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor.

 Pungent … Inside Llewyn Davis. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar 
Despite a growing suspicion that “Llewyn” is a Welsh name they invented or 
misheard, the Coens’ study of a middling pre-Dylan wannabe in the 1960s New 
York folk scene is pungent, beautifully acted and unmissable.

 Screwball … The Grand Budapest Hotel. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex 
Wes Anderson had a UK box-office hit with this eccentric and beguiling 
screwball comedy-farce that channelled the spirits of Lubitsch and the interwar 
popular author Stefan Zweig. Ralph Fiennes hit a career high as the elegant 
hotel concierge M Gustave.

 Tarantino-esque … A Touch of Sin Photograph: PR 
Jia Zhang-ke is a Chinese director known for his quietist, contemplative work. 
This film (original title: Heavenly) is a startling change of form: an angry, 
ultraviolent, almost Tarantino–esque blast at modern China’s obsession with 
money.

Linklater contrives a remarkable, rigorous time-lapse study of a boy growing to

 A world of rapture and pain … Ida 
It may have a short running time, but it encases a whole world of mystery, 
history, rapture and pain. A young woman about to become a nun in 1960s Poland 
discovers she was born Jewish and – in the company of a depressed, drunk judge 
– sets off on a journey to discover the truth.

Alejandro González Iñárritu achieves takeoff in a big way with his crazy, 
freaky-deaky, hellzapoppin’ showbiz comedy Birdman. Michael Keaton stars as an 
ageing movie star trying to reinvent himself as a serious actor – but plagued 
by memories ofBirdman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/birdman>, the dumb
