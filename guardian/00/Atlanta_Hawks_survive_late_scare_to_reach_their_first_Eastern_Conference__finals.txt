Avoiding overtime in Game 6 when Paul Pierce’s potential tying three-pointer 
was released after the clock expired, the Atlanta Hawks made it to the Eastern 
Conference finals for the first time by beating theWashington Wizards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/washington-wizards> 94-91 on Friday night.

The Hawks held on thanks primarily to DeMarre Carroll’s playoff career-high 25 
points, including two lay-ups in the last minute off assists from Jeff Teague.

After Al Horford went one of two from the free throw line for a three-point 
lead, the Wizards inbounded the ball with 6.4 seconds left. They got the ball 
to Pierce, who won Game 3 on a banked-in buzzer-beater, then put Washington 
briefly ahead late in Game 5 with a three. This time, his three from the corner 
swished through, but a replay review determined it was too late.

conference finals on Wednesday.
