A group of more than 50 Hollywood stars, fashion designers, musicians, writers 
and philosophers have joined forces to call for greater legal protection and 
support for whistleblowers around the world.


The diverse alliance includes philosophers Slavoj Žižek and Noam Chomsky, 
movie A-listers Susan Sarandon and Peter Sarsgaard, artist Sarah Lucas, and 
musicians Moby and MIA – not to mention theubiquitous Russell Brand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/10/parklife-russell-brand-releases-parody-after-being-mocked-on-the-internet>
. They have come together to fly the flag for the unsung whistleblower and, in 
a joint statement, say that those sources and publishers who “risks their lives 
and careers to stand up for truth and justice” should be worthy of society’s 
protection and support.

The signatories mention four individuals by name: Edward Snowden, the former 
National Security Agency contractornow in exile in Russia

; Chelsea Manning, serving35 years in military custody

as the source of the massive 2010 WikiLeaks trove of US state secrets; Daniel 
Ellsberg, of the 1970s Pentagon Papers; and Jeremy Hammond, who is ona 10-year 
sentence <http://www.wired.com/2013/11/hammond-sentence/>for his part in 
Anonymous’s release of emails from the intelligence firm Stratfor.

Thanks to their courage, the statement says, “the public can finally see for 
themselves the war crimes, corruption, mass surveillance and abuses of power of 
the US government and other governments around the world.”

The participants also name-check WikiLeaks, which they say is “essential for 
its fearless dedication in defending these sources and publishing their 
truths”. Its founder, Julian Assange, remains in asylum in the Ecuadorean 
embassy <http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n05/andrew-ohagan/ghosting> in London 
following allegations of sexual assault raised in Sweden.

The statement was organized by the Courage Foundation, the body recently set 
up by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks which is acting as the legal defense fund for 
Snowden. It has been timed to coincide with the release of Laura Poitras’s 
documentary about Snowden,CitizenFour

.

“I didn’t ask Edward Snowden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden> to stick his neck out for 
me,” said one of the signatories, Vivienne Westwood. “But now that he did I ask 
myself where would we be without him?”

It also comes at a moment where the US government is perceived to be taking a 
particularly aggressive approach to official leakers. Including Snowden and 
Manning, there have been a total of eight prosecutions by the Obama 
administrationrelating to leaks under the 1917 Espionage Act  
<http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/5/obama-and-leakerswhoaretheeightchargedunderespionageact.html>
– more than those that were brought by all previous presidents combined.

Prosecutors are also continuing to threaten with subpoena the New York Times 
reporter James Risen in connection with the upcoming trial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/03/no-deal-nyt-journalist-testify-ex-cia-officers-trial>
 of one of the eight, a former CIA operative Jeffrey Sterling.

The list of those who have backed the whistleblower statement also includes 
movie directorsAlfonso Cuarón <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron>
, Terry Gilliam and Ken Loach; musicians Robbie Charter of the Avalanches, PJ 
Harvey and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth; and writers Roddy Doyle and Hanif 
Kureishi.
