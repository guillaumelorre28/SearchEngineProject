The ever hot-tempered Azealia Banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/azealia-banks> has gone on yet another 
Twitter rampage, this time targeting fellow rapper Iggy Azalea – who she 
renames “Igloo Australia” – for failing to comment on “black issues” despite 
capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music.

its funny to see people Like Igloo Australia silent when these things 
happen... Black Culture is cool, but black issues sure aren't huh?

Her tweet comes a day after a grand jury failed to indict a New York City 
police officer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/03/justice-department-eric-holder-eric-garner-investigation>
 whose actions led to the death of an African American man called Eric Garner. 
The decision sparked street protests amid a time of heightened racial tension 
for the country.

“If you’re down to ride with us bitch you gotta RIDE ALL THE WAY”, tweets 
Banks, who also calls Iggy a “wigger” and accuses the media of giving her 
excessive coverage – coverage thatrightfully belongs to Nicki Minaj

In 2012, Banks kicked off her campaign against Azalea, highlighting one, 
highly offensive line 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/28/iggy-azalea-interview-rap-talk-ironic-cool>
 in her song D.R.U.G.S. (“When it really starts I’m a runaway slave ... 
master”). Since then, accusations of racism against Azalea have persisted, but 
focused more on Azalea’sinsensitivity to the complexities of race relations and 
cultural appropriation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/03/-sp-in-defence-of-iggy-azalea-on-racism-naivety-and-a-twisted-cluster-of-exploitation>
 than any personal and wilful bigotry on the rapper’s part.

Azalea initially responded to Banks and her social justice warriors with a wry 
tweet.

👀 I see all hell broke loose while I was at rehearsals today.

“We’ve all read the script 49584068408540 billion times now, find a new game 
plan”,” she tweeted. “Theres more to sparking a change than trolling on social 
media. World issues shouldnt be used as a poor excuse to promote fan battles.”

Banks might have a point when she accuses journalists and the public of 
finding Azalea, as well her practice of African American music and behaviours, 
more “acceptable” because of her skin colour. But she does her cause disservice 
with this trite Twitter trolling – I mean, isn’t she simply drumming upmore 
media attention for Azalea?

Decolonisation is about reclaiming narratives that have been dominated by 
white, western voices – changing the players and the perspectives, and bringing 
the marginalised into the centre.

So while Banks’s fury is very loud and possibly real, played within the 
context of a hip-hop feud – that well-established musical interaction known as 
“beef” – it’s hard not to question the wisdom of drawing the spotlight away 
from the victims of police brutality and back to another bestselling white girl 
pop act.

In any case, Azalea doesn’t take the bait, instead bringing the discussion 
back to what’s important:
IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) 
Make sure you do something to let YOUR government know how you feel when 
something is unjust., not JUST your followers on twitter...

She encourages fans to “sign petitions, hit the streets and protest or donate 
to groups helping to support and rebuild the community too,” before sharingan 
article on Bustle 
<http://www.bustle.com/articles/36153-5-ways-you-can-help-ferguson-its-protesters-and-mike-browns-family>
 that lists five ways to support protesters in Ferguson, and the family of Mike 
Brown, who was shot dead in a controversial police confrontation.

Azalea also cautions fans against clicktivism and paying too much attention to 
Twitter storms when “theres an actual world out there and multiple ways you can 
promote change”.

Fine words, that would be all the more weighty if we were to see a more 
socially conscious Azalea in action – both in her music, and her public life.
