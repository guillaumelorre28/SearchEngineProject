Abbey National's £9bn takeover by Banco Santander Central Hispano will today 
be challenged in the high court by an investor who is anxious about criminal 
charges faced by some of the Spanish bank's executives.

The investor's concerns are expected to be heard at the court hearing to 
approve the Abbey National takeover.

Mr Justice Evans Lombe is expected to consider the application launched by 
Michael Johnson, the investor who turned to the courts in an attempt to 
overrule the shareholder meeting which ratified the takeover.

Mr Johnson made his application after the extraordinary general meeting of 
Abbey National shareholders last month.

The EGM was disrupted after the 900 or so private investors in the hall were 
told about charges facing some Santander executives, including its chairman, 
Emilio Botín.

After hearing of the allegations an adjournment motion was put to the meeting, 
which would have been passed by a show of hands in the hall had Abbey National 
chairman Lord Burns not used the proxy vote cast by institutional investors to 
overturn the motion. Mr Johnson is asking the court to rule Lord Burns's use of 
the proxy vote invalid.
