Top companies are being urged to produce clearer and more concise information 
to describe their strategy to investors in a move intended to reduce the amount 
of verbiage in annual reports.

The Financial Reporting Council, which oversees corporate governance codes and 
accounting standards, is publishing new guidance to help reduce the size of 
annual reports, which can run to hundreds of pages and contain sections on 
remuneration, financial statements and the directors' report.

The new section containing a strategic report has been introduced since 
October and Melanie McLaren, executive director codes and standards at the FRC, 
said it should be concise enough to be read over a "decent cup of coffee".

The strategic report is intended to cover the business model and the risks the 
company faces.

Companies have been duplicating information in annual reports - their yearly 
report card for their shareholders - between the different sections and the FRC 
is now arguing that there can be more cross-referencing of information.

Since 2012 the FRC has required corporate reports to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the FRC said: "However, 
investors still express concern that the key messages about the business are 
buried in too much verbiage of little value or are obscured by boilerplate. The 
programme we launch today is designed to tackle this persistent problem and 
promote clear and concise reporting. We will be seeking the views of 
stakeholders through roundtable discussions."

The department for business, innovation and skills asked the FRC to publish 
guidance on the new legal requirement to include the strategic report in the 
annual report. "One of its objectives is to set out high-level principles that 
enable entities to 'tell their story'," the FRC said in its guidance.
