He is the less well-known half of a power fashion duo

It isn’t usual protocol on the Guardian’s fashion desk to flag up the moment 
that a Hollywood star gets a new stylist to fix her up with some frocks on the 
red carpet. Not even when it is human rights lawyer and (apparent) Audrey 
Hepburn fangirlAmal Clooney <https://www.theguardian.com/world/amal-alamuddin>.

But when the stylist in question – Alexis Roche - is the long-term partner of 
John Galliano <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/john-galliano>, it would be 
remiss of us not to mention it. The pairing answers the nagging question of why 
Amal has worn Margiela twice on the red carpet already this year – most 
prominently at the Met Ball. Turns out this was neither asartorial gaffe 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/05/05/amal-clooneys-met-gala-dress-crafted-by-disgraced-anti-semite-designer/>
 nor anuanced message about freedom of expression to back up her criticism of 
Turkey 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11373991/Amal-Clooney-accuses-Turkey-of-hypocrisy-on-freedom-of-speech-in-Armenian-genocide-trial.html>
. Instead, it is clear that Roche has been exercising his right to sartorial 
bias with a suitcase full of his beau’s designs.

He also works for Kendall Jenner

Happily the stylist has been sharing his work on Twitter. His @lexyroche 
<https://twitter.com/lexyroche> handle reveals that he was the wardrobe force 
behind Kendall Jenner’s Azzedine Alaia crop-top-and-ballgown Cannes appearance. 
Ditto her lupin-like Calvin Klein dress at the Amfar benefit. This means his 
influence straddles the politico-Kardashian-Hollywood universe. Which is pretty 
cool, right?

He joins the dots in fashion’s most powerful cabal

As is evident from the above picture from US Vogue’s Instagram account, Roche 
is literally and metaphorically In The Room. He stands in the background 
wearing the white lab coat worn by all Margiela staff as Galliano pins Clooney 
into the Met Ball dress. To his right stands Anna Wintour. It is the event that 
symbolises Wintour’s influence over the fashion industry, and Roche is present. 
Other stylists would kill for those coordinates.

He knows everyone else in fashion

He is top pals with uber-stylist Edward Enniful and has made cameo appearances 
on Alexa Chung’s Instagram feed (he styled her in the Longchamp campaign). He 
has also worked withChinese supermodel Lui Wen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/oct/10/apple-watch-vogue-china-fashion-strategy>
. In technical speak: he has the fashion industry indisputably covered.

He could have had a hand in the Clooney wedding gown

Pinch-of-salt speculation, but when you think that a) he’s In The Room, and b) 
Galliano started his industry rehabilitation via a stint of work at the Oscar 
de la Renta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2013/feb/13/john-galliano-oscar-de-la-renta-new-york-fashion>
, and c) the fashion world is tiny, then this thesis starts to make sense. 
Other rumours now doing the rounds include the theory that Amal’s new fondness 
for Margiela, coupled with her blossoming friendship with fashion industry 
overlordand Galliano cheerleader 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/11/john-galliano-return-penitent-enfant-terrible>
 Wintour, will see her soon appearing on the US Vogue cover wearing the brand.
