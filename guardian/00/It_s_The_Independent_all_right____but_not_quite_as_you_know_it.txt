No, these images of Independent front pages are not phantoms. Although the 
newspaper in its printed form is no more, its executives are determined that 
its newsprint-style covers should live on... through its tablet editions.

Over the past three days the familiar Indy front pages have been turning up on 
iPads. Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s can be seen above, and Monday’s is below. They 
certainly look like the Independent, even if they don’t exist in the old 
ink-on-paper format.

The Independent’s former editor (now its editor-at-large), Amol Rajan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/amol-rajan>, explains that they were 
determined to produce tablet versions of the paper that were “true in spirit to 
the Independent that everyone has known.”


They also help to promote the commentators and columnists - such as Matthew 
Norman, John Rentoul, Steve Richards and Jane Merrick - who have been with the 
Independent titles for so long.

Rajan tells me that the paper’s co-founder, Andreas Whittam Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andreas-whittam-smith>, has been 
particularly struck by the way in which the tablet screen reproductions look 
like authentic print fronts.

Indeed, the “inside pages” also have the patina of the printed Independent.
