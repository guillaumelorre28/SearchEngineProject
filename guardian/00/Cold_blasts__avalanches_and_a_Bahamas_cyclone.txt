Bitter winter weather strengthened its grip across Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> over the last week with many 
areas receiving snow and plummeting temperatures. While last weekend some 
southern parts of the UK experienced the first light covering of snow of the 
winter, snow continued to pile up across the Alps.

Level snow, to depths of more than two metres, now lie across the higher 
slopes of the Alps and this has led to dangerous conditions due to the 
heightened avalanche risk. Five French Foreign Legionnaires were killed on 
Sunday and a further six people hurt as an avalanche hurtled down close to 
Valfejus, not far from the Italian border.

Tumbling temperatures have added to the misery endured by migrants as the 
European refugee crisis continues. Some of the coldest conditions this week 
occurred across Macedonia and Serbia; here thousands of refugees risked 
hypothermia and pneumonia with the mercury down to around -20C.

A phenomenon not normally associate with winter weather is Atlantic 
hurricanes. But, on 7 January, Hurricane Alex was born as an extratropical 
cyclone near the Bahamas. Over several days it acquired tropical 
characteristics and strengthened into a fully fledged hurricane on 14 January, 
becoming the first Atlantic hurricane in this month since Alice in 1955.

Although weakening slightly, Tropical Storm Alex made landfall on Terceira 
Island, in the Azores, the next day, closing schools and businesses and causing 
property damage before turning back into an extratropical cyclone and merging 
with another system over the Labrador Sea on 17 January.
