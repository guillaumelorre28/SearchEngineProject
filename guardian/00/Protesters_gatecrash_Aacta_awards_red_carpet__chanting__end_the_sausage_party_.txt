Protesters dressed as sausages have caused a stir at the Aactas, storming the 
red carpet to highlight the male domination of the film and television 
industries.

Around 15 protesters in costume burst into the annual industry awards at the 
Star casino inSydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> on 
Wednesday.

Chanting “end the sausage party”, the women fell down in formation before 
security guards dragged them up and pushed them out.

The protest was organised by Women In Film and Television (Wift), which is in 
support of a quota system to increase the number of women working in film and 
television, and is working to a 2021 target for parity.

Sophie Mathisen, Wift founder and protest organiser, told Guardian Australia 
the protest was a “very loud and bold statement”.

“Aacta purports to be a celebration of Australia screen excellence, and at the 
moment it’s a celebration of a very, very narrow part of the industry.

“There are a huge number of women that are working outside of the system that 
don’t even get a look-in.”

She said only two of the 28 films preselected for AACTA awards were directed 
by women: “We are looking at it as the tip of the iceberg.”

Deakin University academics’ analysis of data 
<http://if.com.au/2016/10/31/article/Breaking-down-the-paucity-of-female-AACTA-award-nominees-guest-column/SWUMILEGCS.html>
 from Aacta and the Australian Film Institute showed that, of the 334 producers 
who worked on feature films (excluding documentaries) submitted to the awards 
between 2006 and 2015, a total of 126 (37%) were women.

Of the 218 men, 89 did not work with a single woman as either producer, 
director or writer: just under 41% of all male producers, working across a 
10-year period.

Mathisen noted that Australian film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia> and television was subsidised by 
taxpayers.

“I don’t understand why there isn’t a gender equity or diversity policy in 
existence. There are strong statistics to prove that there is institutionalised 
bias in the system, and the fact that it is not addressed head-on means we are 
invested in the status quo.”

Wift has drafted a charter for gender equity that Mathisen was hopeful Aacta 
would acknowledge.

She said meaningful action, such as the introduction of quotas, was needed – 
as well as greater transparency about how nominations for Aacta awards were 
reached.

Australian Film Television and Radio School reports show that between 1973 and 
2015, just under half (48%) of all graduates in screenwriting, production and 
directing were women.

But there was a steep drop-off when it came to representation within the 
industry.

According to figures from Screen Australia 
<http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/getmedia/6f3ef5cc-79fa-4bb9-add7-6717c60f97a9/Infographic-2015-May-Women-working-in-creative-roles-infographic.pdf?ext=.pdf>
, 30% of producers working on Australian feature films from 1970 to 2014 were 
women – but 21% of writers and just 16% of directors.

Thirty-two per cent of producers, 23% of writers and 16% of directors 
currently active were women.

In December last year Screen Australia announced a five-point plan for a suite 
of initiatives – worth $5m over three years – to address the gender imbalance 
in the industry.

Mathisen said more action was needed to achieve faster results.

“It’s not good enough to sit in conferences and summits any more. Long-term, 
significant improvement in these numbers will not happen organically. We know 
with any institution that it needs to be through very rigorous and active 
lobbying, and, realistically, legislation.”

When shooting her debut feature last year, she set a quota that 50% of the 
crew be female. Shetold Channel 7’s Daily Edition on Tuesday 
<https://au.tv.yahoo.com/the-daily-edition/video/watch/33428822/aussie-actress-out-challenge-our-male-dominated-film-industry/#page1>
 that, from her own experience, Australia was behind the curve globally.

“I think within Australia we’re still trying to feel out how we change the 
industry, how we invite more women in … It was very challenging, I think, for a 
lot of people who’d worked on sets for a number of years. They’d never really 
been around that many women before.”

The crew on her feature, A Film Called Drama, came to be known as “sexy crew” 
by some actors, Mathisen said: “They’d never seen so many females in shorts 
lifting camera gear. They didn’t know what to do.”
