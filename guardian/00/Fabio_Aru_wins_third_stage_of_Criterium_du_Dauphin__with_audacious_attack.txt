Aru (Astana) attacked alone with 12km to go after Tony Martin 
(Etixx-QuickStep) had already launched an escape attempt before being reeled in 
to form a select eight-man group.

Italy’s Aru, who had also attacked on the category two Cote de Secheras, kept 
his slim margin and held off the charging sprinters’ teams to win.

Norway’s Alexander Kristoff (Katusha) was two seconds behind in second place 
and Niccolo Bonifazio (Trek-Segafredo) was third. Ireland’s Sam Bennett 
(Bora-Argon) was sixth and Chris Froome (Team Sky) finished in the bunch in 
23rd place.

Contador (Tinkoff) had to make a late bike change, swapping with a team-mate, 
before returning to the peloton and finished in 39th place, also two seconds 
behind Aru.

Spain’s Contador still leads by six seconds from Australia’s Richie Porte 
(BMC), with Froome third, seven seconds further back. Dan Martin 
(Etixx-QuickStep) is fourth, 21 seconds behind, while Aru sits 27th overall, 
1min 15secs behind.

Aru, who won the 2015 Vuelta a Espana, is targeting the Tour de France this 
summer and was trying to make amends after losing one minute 27 seconds to 
Contador in the opening three days.

Thursday’s 176km fourth stage from Tain-l’Hermitage to Belley is another one 
for the sprinters, before three mountain stages to the race’s conclusion on 
Sunday.
