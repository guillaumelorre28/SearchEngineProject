Mourinho led Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> to the 
Premier League title last season, but left Stamford Bridge last month after 
what the club’s technical director, Michael Emenalo, described as a “palpable 
discord” with the players. Guus Hiddink was placed in interim control.

Villas-Boas worked with Mourinho at Chelsea earlier in his career and returned 
for a short, unsuccessful spell as manager in 2011. The former Tottenham coach 
is now in charge of Zenit St Petersburg but will leave the Russian club at the 
end of the season, when Chelsea will be looking for a permanent replacement for 
Mourinho.

Villas-Boas told BeIN Sports: “It’s been quite incredible to see that it 
[being sacked] was applied to everybody. It was applied to probably their 
dearest coach, their most successful coach, so in the end we have seen nothing 
different. Roman has sacked basically every coach that he’s had. It’s no 
different. It happened even to the best.

“The same criteria that he has applied to me, for Rafa Benítez, for all the 
other coaches, Ancelotti, he’s applied to José as well.”
