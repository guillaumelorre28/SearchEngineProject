Nigella Lawson’s venison in white wine


Serves 8
For the marinade
dry white wine 1 bottle
olive oil 2 tbsp
bay leaves 2
carrots 2
onion 1 large
celery 2 sticks
garlic 2 cloves, squashed with flat of knife
juniper berries 10, crushed slightly
black peppercorns 10, crushed slightly

For the rest of the stew
venison 1½kg , cut into chunks about 3cm x 6cm
dried porcini 20g
unsalted butter 100g, or goose or duck fat
olive oil a drop
onions 1kg
sugar 1 tbsp
ground cinnamon ½ tsp
ground cloves 1½ tsp
nutmeg ½, grated
sage 3 leaves
flour 3 tbsp
beef or game stock 300ml
mushrooms 300g, preferably brown cap or chestnut mushrooms
parsley chopped

Put the venison into a bowl and cover with the marinade ingredients. Give a 
good stir and cover with clingfilm and leave overnight somewhere cool. If the 
weather’s warm or you just want to stow this away for a few days, then put it 
to marinate in the fridge, but make sure you take it out and get it back to 
room temperature before you want to cook it.

When you do, preheat the oven to 150C/gas mark 2 and, at the same time, cover 
the porcini with hot water. Then put 75g of the butter and a drop of oil in a 
large casserole and when it’s melted add the onions, very finely sliced (I use 
the processor), and cook for about 10-15 minutes or until the onions are soft 
and translucent. Strain the dried porcini, reserving the water, and then chop 
them very small. Add these to the onion and give a good stir. Cook gently for 
another minute or so, stir again, then sprinkle with the sugar. Turn up the 
heat and caramelise slightly and then add the spices and sage. Tear a piece of 
kitchen foil about the same measurements as the casserole and place it just 
above the onions. Turn the heat to low – you may need to use a heat diffuser – 
and cook for 30-40 minutes, lifting up the foil every now and again to give a 
gentle prod and stir. You want a brown, sweet mess under there.

Pour the venison into a colander or sieve placed over a pan. Then pick out the 
marinade ingredients or meat (whichever is easier). Remove half the cooked 
onion mixture and cover the half still in the pan with the venison. Season with 
salt and pepper, sprinkle with the flour, and cover with the rest of the 
onions. Heat up the marinade liquid in its pan, add the stock and reserved, 
strained mushroom-soaking liquid, and pour over the venison. If the meat isn’t 
covered you can add some more wine (though heat it up first) or stock (ditto). 
Put in the preheated oven, and cook for about 2½ hours or until very tender 
indeed.

You can now let this cool and keep it in the fridge for 2-3 days. Forty 
minutes at 180C/gas mark 4, or on the hob, should be enough to reheat it, but 
do remember it should be brought back to room temperature first. About 15 
minutes before the stew is hot again, wipe the mushrooms, cut them into 
quarters, melt the remaining 25g butter in a small frying pan and cook the 
mushrooms in it, sprinkling with salt and pepper. After about 5 minutes, add 
them to the stew in the oven. Leave it there to cook for another 10 minutes.

Sprinkle the stew with parsley when you serve it. I always have this with 
mashed potato and I like sliced green beans with it, too.

I don’t necessarily scale down the quantities if I’m cooking for fewer people 
since the oniony juices, with or without the leftover meat, make the most 
fabulous pasta sauce the next day.

 Rabbit pie: ‘a wild rabbit of any size will do here’. Photograph: Martin Poole 
for the Observer 
Mary was my mother and my mentor. This rabbit pie is a family heirloom, cooked 
wherever and whenever my family meets. My mother would have used any rabbit 
caught by my grandpa, and the pie would have had more or less meat accordingly 
– so a wild rabbit of any size will do here. A farmed rabbit would be an 
extravagance for this dish.

Serves 4
For the pastry
unsalted butter 180g
plain flour 240g
salt a pinch
water 60ml

For the filling
wild rabbit 1
chicken stock or water 2 litres
celery 1 stick, chopped
carrot ½, sliced
onion 1, chopped
lemon zest 1 piece
parsley 1 stalk
bay leaf 1
thyme 1 sprig
black peppercorns 1 tsp
smoked streaky bacon 100g, minced
button mushrooms 200g, sliced
flaked almonds 100g, toasted
parsley 1 cup, freshly chopped
salt
freshly ground black pepper
shortcrust pastry 1 quantity (see above)
breadcrumbs 110g

For the sauce
butter 150g
plain flour 150g
reserved cooking liquid 1.25 litres
cream 200ml
lemon juice of 2
salt
freshly ground pepper

To make the pastry, remove the butter from the refrigerator 30 minutes before 
making the pastry. Sift the flour and salt onto a marble pastry slab or 
workbench. Chop the butter into smallish pieces and toss lightly in the flour. 
Lightly rub to combine partly. Make a well in the centre and pour in the water. 
Using a pastry scraper, work the water into the flour until you have a very 
rough heap of buttery lumps of dough (I am the daughter of a builder, and this 
action always reminds me of my dad working a much larger well of water into a 
ring of powdered cement). Using the heel of your hand, quickly smear pastry 
away from you across the workbench. It will combine lightly. Gather together, 
then press quickly into a flat cake and dust with a little flour. Wrap the 
pastry in plastic film and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. When required roll 
out the pastry, dusting generously with flour as necessary.

Remove the kidneys and liver from the rabbit and reserve. Simmer the rabbit in 
the stock with the celery, carrot, onion, zest, herbs and peppercorns until the 
back legs test tender, 1-2 hours. Allow the rabbit to cool completely in the 
stock. Remove the rabbit and set the strained cooking liquid aside. Strip all 
the meat from the carcass and cut into small pieces. Discard the bones.

Lightly sauté the bacon and mushrooms and quickly sear the reserved kidneys 
and liver. Chop the kidneys and liver and mix with the rabbit meat, bacon, 
mushrooms and almonds in a bowl. Mix in the chopped parsley and season well. 
Cover with plastic film.

To make the sauce, cook the butter and flour over a gentle heat to make a 
roux. Gradually stir in the reserved rabbit stock and bring to simmering point. 
Add the cream and lemon juice and simmer for 10 minutes, using a simmer mat to 
prevent the sauce sticking. Check for seasoning, then add enough of the sauce 
to the meat to make a creamy, not sloppy, filling. Allow to cool completely.

Preheat oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Line a 28cm x 18cm x 5cm lamington tin with 
the pastry (reserve some pastry to make a latticed top) and bake blind for 20 
minutes. Remove the pastry case from oven and allow to cool. Reduce the oven 
temperature to 180C/gas mark 4. Spoon the filling into the pastry case (it will 
be easier to cut squares or wedges if the filling is a maximum of 4cm deep). 
Scatter the top with breadcrumbs and criss-cross strips of pastry over the 
filling. Bake for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is well browned.

Serve warm or cold with mustard, chutney or pickled fruit.

 Beans and bacon: for hearty eaters on a cold day. Photograph: Martin Poole for 
the Observer 
To feed four, but can easily expand and is a good dish for many hearty eaters 
on a cold day, so go as big as your pot allows you (on a cold day).

“Landlord, bring us beans and bacon and a bottle of your finest burgundy.”

Serves 4
dried white haricot beans 1kg, soaked overnight
pig’s trotter 1 (2 litres chicken stock will be splendid if no trotter is 
available)
carrots 2, peeled
onions 2, peeled, left whole
celery 2 sticks
garlic 3 heads
thyme, rosemary and parsley a bundle
good green streaky bacon 1kg piece, skin on
duck fat or extra virgin olive oil
onions 3, peeled and chopped
leeks 2, peeled and chopped
plum tomatoes 1 tin
sea salt and black pepper

Put the beans into a pan with clean water, bring to the boil, skim and reduce 
to a simmer until thoroughly giving. This will take approximately 1½ hours. As 
soon as they meet the salty bacon they will stop getting any softer; in fact, 
they seem to firm up (many recipes suggest soaking and blanching for 10 minutes 
is enough, but in my experience, once they meet salt – however long you cook 
them for – they never give in). Once cooked, remove from the heat, but keep 
them in their liquor.

Separately cover your trotter with water, add the carrots, whole onions, 
celery, 1 head of garlic and the herbs, and bring to the boil. Skim, reduce to 
a simmer, and cook for 2½ hours.

While all this is happening, remove the skin from the piece of bacon, if 
possible in one piece, and slice the bacon into 8mm thick slices.

Get a deep pan hot and add a healthy dollop of duck fat (or oil). Firstly fry 
the piece of bacon skin, fat down, so it releases some of its fat into the pan, 
and remove; then colour your bacon slices and remove; then fry your chopped 
onions and leeks until softened, and add the tin of tomatoes, crushing the 
tomatoes in your hands as you do so.

Let this cook down for 20 minutes to sweeten the tomatoes, stirring to remove 
all the good bits of bacon that might adhere to the pan, season, remembering 
the bacon is salty, add two ladles of the trotter stock, and let cook for 
another 10 minutes. Drain the beans but keep their liquor, add to the pan, and 
mix with the tomato base.

 French onion soup. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer 
Serves 6
brown onions 12 medium, peeled
butter or duck fat 80g
garlic 3 cloves, chopped
picked thyme ½ tsp
fresh bay leaf 1
dry cider 330ml
plain flour 15g
chicken stock or beef consomme 1.5 litre
soy sauce 4 tbsp
salt and pepper

For the garnish
baguette 18 thin slices
gruyere cheese or emmental 90g

Cut the onions in quarters then slice them finely. Put the butter or duck fat 
in a large pot on medium heat. When melted, add the onions, stir from time to 
time to get a uniform cooking and colour. The idea is to get it hot enough to 
soften the onions and caramelise them at the same time. It will take about 15 
minutes, then add the garlic, thyme, bay leaf and the flour. Stir well with a 
spoon for a minute then add the cider and reduce by half. Add the chicken stock 
or beef consomme and season lightly. Add the soy sauce and simmer for 30 
minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Pour the soup in a large oven dish or 6 
individual ovenproof bowls and lay the baguette slices gently on the top of the 
soup. Sprinkle with a generous layer of gruyere cheese then gratinate under the 
grill of your oven. Keep the dish low in the oven so that it does not gratinate 
too fast. Serve immediately.

 Moroccan tagine with quince: luxurious. Photograph: Martin Poole for the 
Observer 
Serves 6
stewing lamb 1 kg, fat or lean, cubed
onions 2, finely chopped
salt and pepper (black, cayenne and paprika), use in moderation, to taste
fresh coriander or parsley 1 bunch, finely chopped
powdered saffron ¼ tsp (optional)
ground ginger ½ tsp
quinces 250-750g, cut in half and cored but not peeled (you may prefer to use 
less fruit the first time you try this dish. Some people prefer to soften the 
taste of quince with a little sugar)
butter 60g (optional)

Put the cubed meat and 1 chopped onion in a large saucepan. Cover with water 
and season to taste with salt and pepper. (Moroccans use a variety of peppers, 
including paprika and cayenne, adding them with a light hand.) Add fresh 
coriander or parsley, saffron if used and ginger, bring to the boil and simmer 
gently, covered, until the meat is tender and the onion has practically 
disintegrated in the sauce. This takes about 1 hour.


Now add the other chopped onion and cook until soft. Half an hour before 
serving, add the quinces and cook until only just tender. The quinces may have 
been sauteed in butter first for a richer flavour.

Pears or apples (peeled and cored), dates and raisins or prunes (soaked 
overnight) may be used instead of the quinces, sometimes in combinations. They 
all make rather luxurious dishes.

Chicken is also delicious cooked in this way.
