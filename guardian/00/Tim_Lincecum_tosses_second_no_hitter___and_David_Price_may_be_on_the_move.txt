Tim Lincecum's timing simply couldn't have been better. His San Francisco 
Giants were suffering through a rough June, losers of 11 of their prior 14 
games, with their starting pitching routinely battered during a nightmarish 
month of baseball. On Wednesday, however, for at least one afternoon, all was 
right at AT&T Park, and that's because Lincecumtossed his second career 
no-hitter, 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/06/25/tim-lincecum-giants-no-hitter-padres/11372299/>
 bringing a bright finish to an overcast day in the Bay Area.

 It's hard to believe that a franchise that goes all the way back to 1885 has 
just one other pitcher with multiple no-hitters – Lincecum joins thelegendary 
New York Giants hurler Christy Mathewson 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mathech01.shtml> as the only other 
player in team history to retire 27 batters without allowing a hit.

This second no-hitter is the latest example of why Lincecum is one of the most 
maddeningly inconsistent players in all of baseball. He is obviously capable of 
brilliance, as proved by his latest work against San Diego,the very same team 
he no-hit last July in a epic 148-pitch outing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/14/tim-lincecum-no-hitter-giants-padres>
. Lincecum was more efficient this time around, striking out six while walking 
just a single batter, all that stood between him and a perfect game. Over the 
nine innings, the listless Padres managed to hit just eight balls out of the 
infield.

However, five days from now when he retakes the mound, Lincecum could easily 
give up eight runs, just as he did during his first start of June: we never 
know which version of the pitcher we're going to see. One thing that we can say 
for sure, The Freak is a shadow of the hurler that won two consecutive Cy Young 
Awards in 2008 and 2009, posting an earned run average north of 5.00 in 2012, 
and slightly less swollen ERAs in subsequent seasons.

That the Giants signed Lincecum for two years at $35m 
<http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9864620/tim-lincecum-agrees-two-year-contract-san-francisco-giants>
 this offseason raised eyebrows, and the new deal has had no effect on his 
inconsistency. On Wednesday Lincecum was phenomenal, just as he was in May when 
he registered a 2.86 ERA over six starts. In April and June however, his 
diminished velocity cost him dearly.

Now Lincecum and his Giants will look to build on this mini-spike in momentum, 
and bid to turn around a stretch that has seen a 9.5 game lead in the National 
League West shrink to just three. The Dodgers, who enjoyeda Clayton Kershaw 
no-hitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/19/la-dodgers-clayton-kershaw-no-hitter>
 just last Wednesday, are charging hard afterwinning nine of their prior 14 
contests.

Name your Price
 How much longer will David Price wear the uniform of the Tampa Bay Rays?

The Tampa Bay Rays All-Star hurler David Price has put together a pretty good 
series of starts, if he doesn't say so his himself.

I've never been as good as I am right now, period. Not in 2012 [when Price won 
the American League Cy Young Award], not in college, not in high school. This 
is the best pitcher I've ever been. I feel in complete control on the mound at 
all times, with all my pitches on both sides of the plate, and that's tough to 
do.

I suppose you don't get to the Major League level without confidence, and 
Price seems to be all set in that department.He also has five consecutive 
starts with at least 10 strikeouts. 
<http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_06_25_pitmlb_tbamlb_1&mode=recap_home&c_id=tb>
 On Wednesday, Price dominated the Pittsburgh Pirates over eight and 
three-quarter innings,setting down 11 Buccos 
<http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_06_25_pitmlb_tbamlb_1&mode=video&content_id=34029239&tcid=vpp_copy_34029239>
 while allowing just one run in continuing the double-digits strikeout streak, 
the longest since 2004.

Price is under Tampa's control until after next season, but with the 
payroll-challenged Rays in the midst of their most disappointing season since 
2007, it seems to be not a matter of if, but when Tampa Bay general manager 
Andrew Friedman finally deals the 28-year-old ace. This week, speculation of 
his imminent departure was rife afterESPN reported Price was being shopped, 
<http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24596210/reports-rays-prepared-to-trade-david-price-right-now>
 a notion that put the hurler in a "bad mood", one reason that the Pirates were 
in the wrong place at the wrong time in facing him Wednesday.

If this is it for Price in St Petersburg, where will he end up? Well, there 
are plenty of teams that are starving for a top starter – the New York Yankees, 
the Giants, and Toronto Blue Jays to name a few. The St Louis Cardinals, 
however, recently lost two of their starting pitchers to shoulder injuries in 
Michael Wacha and Jaime Garcia, and have atop prospect in Oscar Tavares that 
could tempt Tampa. <http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/david-price-future-cardinal/>
 This is only the start of what promises to be as good of an in-season, premium 
player sweepstakes as we've seen in some time.

Rox in a hard place

After picking up their first win in eight games on Tuesday, the Colorado 
Rockies were back to their losing ways on Wednesday,dropping a contest to the 
Cardinals 9-6 
<http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_06_25_slnmlb_colmlb_1&mode=wrap>
. After a surprising start which had them sitting eight games over .500 on 7 
May, the Rox slid and have nowlost 20 of their previous 28 games, 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/COL/2014-schedule-scores.shtml> this 
despite having the possible National League MVP on their roster in Troy 
Tulowitzki.

I say possible for a couple of reasons. First off, Tulo leads the NL in an 
array of statistics – batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, 
runs scored, offensive WAR, trailing the Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo 
Stanton by two home runs with 18. Now, if the season ended today, you would 
think that he would be the clear cut MVP winner, however, there's a few reasons 
to doubt such an outcome. Players from losing teams rarely get the MVP award.
Cal Ripken, Andre Dawson, Ernie Banks and Alex Rodriguez 
<http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/16403/bad-mvp-winners-andre-dawson>
 are the only players to get the honor while playing for a losing team.

The second issue is the Coors Field factor. Inside the mile-high stadium, 
where breaking balls don't break, cutters don't cut and balls fly into thin air,
Tulowitzki is hitting an unfathomable .457 heading into Wednesday, 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=tulowtr01&year=&t=b> 
with his other numbers equally off the charts. Away from the extremely friendly 
Denver confines, Tulo is a .252 hitter with some overall power numbers which 
are good, but certainly not MVP calibre. So the a main question is: can you 
punish a player for playing in his home ballpark? That's something to ponder at 
this early stage – should this trend continue over the course of an entire 
season it will be pretty interesting to see how the NL MVP conversation goes, 
especially with other major candidates including Stanton, Andrew McCutchen and 
Paul Goldschmidt playing for struggling teams.


Hats on, hats off

To wear or not to wear? That is the question facing Major League Baseball 
pitchers who are faced with the horrendous looking but protective hat that made 
its debut this week.San Diego hurler Alex Torres took to the hill wearing an 
oversized "hat helmet" 
<http://www.937thebull.com/onair/mason-and-remy-38514/padres-pitcher-first-to-don-new-12490558/>
 that offers protection from baseballs traveling from 90 mph towards the front 
of the head and up to 85 mph to the side of the head. Here's a look at Torres's 
new duds.

Now, that is an absolutely godawful sight to see on a baseball field, and 
pitchers will have to figure out whether or not this look, which can 
potentially save lives, is worth putting up with. Its use was given the gold 
stamp of approval by MLB and the MLB players union during the offseason, with 
Torres being the first player weighing the risk of torment against the reward 
of being spared injury on a sharply hit comebacker. It's a risk that is very 
real, as Alex Cobb of Tampa Bay found out against theKansas City Royals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kansas-city-royals> last season.

And finally...MLB and the World Cup

No one will argue that the World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-2014> is dominating the global 
sports scene – to do that would just be silly. In fact, many Major League 
Baseball players and fans have joined in on the fun, specifically Adam 
Wainwright, ace pitcher for the St Louis Cardinals.
