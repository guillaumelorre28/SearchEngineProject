French actor Gérard Depardieu has made light of his recent aeroplane-urination 
incident by makinga short video spoof dressed as Obélix

the character he plays in the popularAstérix  
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1597522/>film series.

Last month, Dépardieu relieved himself on to the carpet of a CityJet flight 
from Paris to Dublin

, after being told that he would have to wait until after take-off before being 
allowed to use the toilet. The plane was reportedly delayed for two hours as 
Dépardieu was taken off the flight.

Now, he has shot a 77-second promotional film in which he and Astérix co-star 
Édouard Baer, in full costume, replay the incident, only with Obélix unable to 
resist his craving for wild boar.

The film also parodies the manner in which Dépardieu's fellow passengers 
swiftly contacted the media. A man immediately behind Obélix is heard calling 
up a radio station to report the incident seconds after it happens.
