Queensland’s education department will now take the lead in the delivery of 
education services in Aurukun, while the current stand-alone direct instruction 
model will be taught alongside the national curriculum.

The review found the rigid direct instruction curriculum, which heavily 
focused on numeracy and literacy, did not emphasise culture or students’ first 
language, Wik.

It heard worksheets, developed in the US, were adapted for use in Australia, 
but in general terms the curriculum was “completely Americanised”.

“They learn about the 4th of July, Thanksgiving and the stories they listen to 
are about American states,” one teacher told the review.

“The kids know more about American states than Australian.

“They then go to boarding school with no Australian culture or Wik culture.”

Aurukun: pressure mounts for overhaul of Noel Pearson reforms

Indigenous leader Noel Pearson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/noel-pearson>, who founded the 
school and introduced the direct instruction curriculum, dismissed the 
criticism as trivial.

“The teachers are told to convert Americana into Australian examples and the 
capable teacher is able to do that all the time,” he said.

Pearson said the review did not consider the high levels of disability 
students suffered, stemming from severe disadvantage in the community.

The department was believing a “fairytale” if it thought it could run the 
school better than he could, he said.

Annastacia Palaszczuk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/annastacia-palaszczuk>, the 
Queensland premier, insisted the Department of Education and Training taking 
control of the curriculum was not a reflection on Pearson.

“Noel shares my commitment for the very best for the children living in remote 
Indigenous communities,” she said.

Teachers will return to the Aurukun school next week to increased security 
measures, including upgraded fencing, new security lights and personal distress 
alarms issued to teachers.

The review was sparked by ongoing violence from a group of young, armed 
offenders in the community, which saw the school’s principal Scott Fatnowna 
carjacked twice in two weeks.

Fatnowna will also return next week, while interim principal Matt O’Hanlon 
will stay on in a mentoring role for the rest of the year.

The government will also add Year 7 and 8 to the school and offer distance 
education to older students to ensure moving to boarding school was a choice, 
not a necessity.

The education minister, Kate Jones, said a financial audit into the school was 
about finding value for money, not because there were any examples of 
misappropriation of funds found.
