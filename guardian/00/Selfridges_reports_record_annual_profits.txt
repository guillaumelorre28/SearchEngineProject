, the department store group Selfridges has reported record profits for year 
ending January 2015.

The group, which is now owned by British-Canadian businessman Galen Weston and 
whose stores are located in London’s Oxford Street, Birmingham and Manchester, 
said operating profits rose 3.4% to £155m, with gross sales up 4.3% to £1.3bn. 
All four stores and its online business saw year-on-year growth.

Its results were helped by a strong performance from the online business, 
which delivers within the UK and to more than 130 other countries, trading in 
eight currencies.

During the year the company began a £300m refurbishment of its Oxford Street 
store, which is expected to take three years to complete. The group also opened 
a new beauty hall in Birmingham and added more luxury designers, including 
Christian Louboutin, to its Exchange Square store in Manchester.

Paul Kelly, group managing director, said: “Our performance [in 2014] has 
consolidated our lead and combined with our £300m investment places Selfridges 
in the top tier of global luxury retailing.”

Selfridges’ managing director, Anne Pitcher, added: “We are delighted to have 
delivered record results in 2014/15, a year when we focused our attention on 
providing an extraordinary shopping experience for our customers, however they 
chose to shop with us. We are confident that our strategy in the coming year 
will firmly reinforce Selfridges’ position at the forefront of fashion and 
provide great opportunities for the many incredible brands that we partner 
with.”
