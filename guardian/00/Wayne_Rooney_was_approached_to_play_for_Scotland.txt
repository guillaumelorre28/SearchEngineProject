Berti Vogts has revealed he once approached a teenage Wayne Rooney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wayne-rooney> about playing for Scotland.

Vogts, who was in charge of Scotland from 2002 to 2004 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/11/newsstory.sport1>, said he 
was made aware of a potential family link when Rooney was a highly-rated 
16-year-old with Everton.

"I spoke to Wayne Rooney – his grandmother, she is Scottish," said Vogts, 
speaking in Baku ahead of hisAzerbaijan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/azerbaijan> side's World Cup qualifier 
against Northern Ireland.

"The Scottish Football Association found the grandmother and I made the call. 
I flew from Glasgow to Everton. He was playing under David Moyes at Everton and 
I spoke to him – a young lad of 16 years of age. I said to him 'you can play 
for Scotland'."

Explaining Rooney's reaction, the German coach beat his chest theatrically and 
said: "[Rooney told me] 'I am English, I am English!'. OK, sorry.

"You have to speak to the player but he told me: 'I'm so sorry boss, I'm 
English'."

The Scottish Football Association did not comment. Rooney went on to make his 
England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> debut in February 2003, 
aged just 17, and went on to become European Cup winner with Manchester United.

Vogts made the revelation when asked about the issue of national eligibility, 
which has made headlines recently due to the emergence of another hot young 
talent, Manchester United'sAdnan Januzaj 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/09/adnan-januzaj-international-england-belgium>
, who could represent England only on residency grounds.

"It's a Fifa rule," he said. "We have to accept it. It is not only in Great 
Britain but also here in Azerbaijan," he said.
