You've got to take your hat off to Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernie-ecclestone>. The 80-year-old 
billionaire was badly beaten up in a brutal mugging outside his Knightsbridge 
office last month. Undeterred, he allowed his bruised face, complete with an 
impressive black eye, to be used in an ad for the exclusive Hublot brand of 
Swiss watches last week, with the slogan: "See what people will do for a 
Hublot."

It takes a certain chutzpah to turn a mugging into a money-making opportunity 
– Hublot, the ad notes, is the "official watch of Formula One", thus providing 
a puff for Bernie's motor-racing empire. Hublot watches, incidentally, can cost 
more than £25,000, making Tag Heuers look like Argos throwaways.

The use of Ecclestone's bruised mug makes you wonder whether anything is 
off-limits in advertising. It reminds me of the McDonald's response in 2004 to 
the sudden death of its chief executive, Jim Cantalupo, when newspaper readers 
in the US were treated to colourful full-page ads depicting Ronald McDonald 
shedding tears of grief. Tasteful? You be the judge.
