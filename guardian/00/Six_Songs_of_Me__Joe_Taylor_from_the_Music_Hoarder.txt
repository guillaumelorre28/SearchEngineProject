I'm Joe Taylor, and I write about new and exciting music over at the Music 
Hoarder <http://themusichoarder.com>. I'm glad I've had the chance to share my 
funeral song – this has taken years of planning and pondering during boring bus 
journeys.

What was the first song you ever bought?

Oasis – Don't Look Back in Anger
Truthfully, this was between a few choices – some more embarrassing than 
others. Do I really want to admit to buying Hanson? Not really. I remember 
heading out to buy thisOasis <https://www.theguardian.com/music/oasis> song, 
and listening to it as soon as I got in on my cassette player.

What song always gets you dancing?

Kelis – Millionaire (feat. André 3000)
This is, and always will be, one of the best songs known to exist. Kelis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kelis> has long been the innovator of 
well-written and performed R&B, but adding André 3000 takes it to another 
level. Whenever I'm out and hear this song, it's clearly always a favourite of 
everybody in the club – and sure to get me dancing.

What song takes you back to your childhood?

Sonique – It Feels So Good
When I was younger, this song haunted me. It bizarrely always seemed to be 
playing in important situations. I've recently rediscovered just how amazing it 
is, and it makes my childhood reappear. A classic.

What is your perfect love song?

Daniel Johnston – True Love Will Find You in the End
This was the hardest category to choose. There are so many songs, both old and 
new, that I wanted to pick, but ultimately it came back to Daniel Johnston. 
Some people get him, others don't, but you cannot argue with his simple and 
heartfelt lyrics. True Love Will Find You in the End is honest and emotional – 
everything a love song should be.

What song would you want at your funeral?

Antony & the Johnsons – Her Eyes Are Underneath the Ground
I've played this game throughout my life many times, during boring bus 
journeys and long nights awake. Over the years, it's been whittled down to 
Antony & the Johnsons. This song is so, so sad, and probably a track of his 
that hasn't attracted the hype others have, but it is up there with the 
classics.

Time for the encore. One last song that makes you, you

Regina Spektor – Samson

An artist and song that has shaped me is Regina Spektor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/regina-spektor> and Samson. Spektor changed 
the way I listened to a song and its lyrics. Watching her grow from an 
underground artist to an international name, while still retaining her 
uniqueness, is amazing.
