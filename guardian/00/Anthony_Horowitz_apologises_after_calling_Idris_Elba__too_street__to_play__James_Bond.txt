Horowitz, who spoke to the Mail on Sunday and launched a scathing critique of 
the recent iterations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/31/author-of-latest-007-novel-lambasts-recent-bond-films>
 of the Bond franchise, releasedthe statement 
<https://twitter.com/AnthonyHorowitz/status/638757024000557056/photo/1> on 
Tuesday saying: “I am mortified to have caused offence.”

He added: “I’m really sorry my comments about Idris Elba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/idris-elba> have caused offence. That 
wasn’t my intention.

“I was asked in my interview if Idris Elba would make a good James Bond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond>. In the article I expressed the 
opinion that to my mind Adrian Lester would be a better choice, but I’m a 
writer not a casting director so what do I know?”

The author, who has written “continuation” Bond novels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/02/james-bond-new-novel-anthony-horowitz-murder-on-wheels>
, including the latest Trigger Mortis, and said Lester would be a more “suave” 
Bond, explained his use of the word “street” to describe Elba.

“Clumsily, I chose the word ‘street’ as Elba’s gritty portrayal of DCI John 
Luther was in my mind but I admit it was a poor choice of word. I am mortified 
to have caused offence.”

Many commentators had expressed anger at Horowitz’s choice of words, including 
the influential American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who tweeted: “Just be honest 
and say ‘James Bond’s being white is important to me’ and be done with it ... 
Elba is ‘too street’ in much the same way that Obama was ‘too foreign,’ and 
King was ‘too communist.’”

Horowitz told the Mail that Elba as “a bit too rough to play the part”, adding 
“It’s not a colour issue. I think he is probably a bit too ‘street’ for Bond.”

Elba’s position as potentially the first ever black Bond was recently 
criticised by American rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh who said: “He was 
white and Scottish. Period

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/08/former-007-villain-yaphet-kotto-says-james-bond-cannot-be-black>
, who starred in Live and Let Die said Elba should not be cast in the lead 
role, saying: “He cannot be black. Political correctness be damned. Play 003 or 
006, but you cannot be 007.”
