increased his advantage on stage 12 of the Giro d’Italia as Philippe Gilbert 
won in Vicenza.

Contador finished the 190-kilometre route from Imola three seconds behind BMC 
Racing’s Gilbert but the Tinkoff-Saxo rider stretched his overall lead to 17sec 
over the second-placed Fabio Aru of Astana.

“It was another very hard day,” Contador said. “We rode the first two hours at 
about 50kph, then the rain started. The peloton broke apart with the high 
speeds but I had good legs. Philippe Gilbert was very strong on the final climb 
but I was thinking of the general classification and I’m very happy with the 
outcome today.”

Gilbert said: “The finish was very hard and the weather was horrible – not 
cold but wet – but the final 400m went perfectly. It’s a great feeling.”

BMC later announced that Stefan Kung, the reigning world individual pursuit 
champion on the track, had suffered a compression fracture of a vertebrae in a 
crash around 25km from the end of the stage. The 21-year-old Swiss rider faces 
around three to four months out with the injury.
