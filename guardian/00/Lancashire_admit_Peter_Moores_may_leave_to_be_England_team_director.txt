Lancashire have acknowledged the possibility of losing their coach, Peter 
Moores, two weeks into the season if he is preferred toAshley Giles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashley-giles> as the England successor to 
Andy Flower.

But Dougie Brown, who succeeded Giles as the director of cricket at 
Warwickshire when Giles took over as England's one-day coach in the autumn of 
2012, believes it would be desperately unfair if his former boss misses out 
because of hisWorld Twenty20 embarrassment in Bangladesh

.

Moores and Giles are thought to be the strong favourites on a four-man 
shortlist which is also said to include Nottinghamshire's director of cricket, 
Mick Newell, and Trevor Bayliss, an Australian who has coached Sri Lanka. 
Interviews will take place during the next fortnight.

"It's not the first time and it won't be the last," said Mike Watkinson, 
Lancashire's cricket director, of Moores's possible departure. "It's a way of 
the world that if you have gone out there and recruited someone who you think 
is one of the best coaches available – which we have – then it is only natural 
that he will be linked to other positions when they come up."

Lancashire appointed Moores little more than a month after he was effectively 
driven out of the England coaching position by Kevin Pietersen in early 2009

, and he has since enhanced his CV with an improbable County Championship 
triumph in 2011 – when Giles and Warwickshire were denied on the last day of 
the season.

But Giles, who scores over Moores in terms of international playing 
experience, then led the Bears to the title the following season, at the end of 
which his appointment as one-day coach confirmed that he had been earmarked as 
the long-term successor to Flower.

Now that looks anything but inevitable, as Giles has been tarnished by 
association with England's disastrous winter. Brown hopes the England & Wales
Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Board will stick with him.

"A lot of the guys had been bruised and battered and could see a flight home 
in the not too distant future," he said of England's closing defeat against the 
Netherlands. "I would like to see Ash get a proper crack at it and have a 
proper run at getting his own squad of players and the infrastructure as we did 
at Warwickshire. Getting a wounded England side would be a great opportunity to 
do that."

Brown also gave Jonathan Trott's return to cricket the thumbs-up even though 
he wasdenied a second chance on the second and last day of the friendly against 
Gloucestershire at Edgbaston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/02/jonathan-trott-matt-prior-michael-carberry-england-county-championship>
, having failed in the first innings, by persistent drizzle. "Everybody in the 
country will be judging it on how many runs he scores in the first few 
championship matches," said the Scot.

"Personally, I'm judging it by how he is around the dressing room – how 
buoyant he is, how enthusiastic and how much willingness he has to go out there 
and work really hard. In fairness, he gets a massive tick for all of that from 
me."
