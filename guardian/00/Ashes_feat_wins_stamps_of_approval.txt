 The Ashes heroics of England's cricketers are to be marked by a set of 
commemorative stamps, the Royal Mail announced yesterday. Julietta Edgar, head 
of special stamps at Royal Mail, said: "Royal Mail is committed to celebrating 
social themes and important occasions central to the UK way of life. England's 
victory in this summer's Ashes series certainly counts as a momentous occasion, 
making it an ideal topic for a set of Royal Mail special stamps." The stamps, 
including first class stamps and a 68p stamp needed to post a letter to 
Australia, will go on sale in a few weeks' time.
