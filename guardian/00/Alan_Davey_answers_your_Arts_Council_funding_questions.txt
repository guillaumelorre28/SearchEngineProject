So England's arts funding decisions have been announced 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/mar/30/arts-council-funding-cuts> and 
we now know who will get what for the next four years. But big questions 
remain, which is why we're delighted to have Alan Davey, chief executive of the 
Arts Council, answering some of them at 1pm today.

The big picture is this: the arts council had its budget cut by 29.6% with a 
condition that it could not pass on frontline spending cuts of more than 15%. 
It chose to take that figure as an overall figure and shake up the national 
portfolio. That's why206 organisations had their funding cut altogether 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/30/arts-council-cuts-list-funding?intcmp=239>
 and 110 new organisations were brought into the mix.

All the big beasts – the Royal Opera, the National Theatre and so on – remain 
intact with cuts of around 11-15%.

Many have seen their cash go up such as the Arcola theatre in Dalston, London 
(an 82% real terms increase) while others have gone down – the Almeida in 
Islington, London, is losing 39% of its money.

Then there are the groups applying for first time funding who did not make it 
– the Rose in Kingston for example – and they're not, to say the least, happy.

There is no right of appeal for any of the arts organisations but there is the 
right to ask Davey, who took over in 2008, some questions.

He'll be online for an hour at 1pm so leave your questions here this morning 
and we'll get him to answer as many as possible.
