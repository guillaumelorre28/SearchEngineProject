Squid, like most cephalopods, are able to produce ink. Ink is mostly made from 
a dark pigment called melanin, which is suspended in thick mucus along with 
small amounts of other things such as amino acids. Squid ink is blue-black in 
colour, while cuttlefish ink is brown and octopus ink is black.

To make ink, squid have special organs called ink glands and ink sacs. Ink is 
continually made by the cells of the ink gland – when a cell is full, it breaks 
down and empties the ink into the ink sac for storage. The ink sac connects to 
the end of the intestine, which opens into a siphon (this is the funnel that 
the squid uses for jet propulsion).

When a squid wants to "ink", it squeezes the sac so that the ink squirts 
into the siphon. There, it mixes with water and is forced out as the squid 
shoots off in the opposite direction.
