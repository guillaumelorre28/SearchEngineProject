10. Planet of the Apes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95819/planet-of-the-apes>

Although the source novel, La Planète des Singes, was written by Frenchman 
Pierre Boule and originally reached its futureshock climax in Paris, this 
enduring sci-fi fantasy is profoundly American, putting Charlton Heston's 
steel-jawed patriotism to incredible use. It also holds up surprisingly well as 
a jarring allegory for the population's fears over escalating cold war tensions.

Beginning with a spaceship crash-landing on an unknown planet after years of 
cryogenic sleep, Franklin J Schaffner's film soon gets into gear as Heston's 
upstanding astronaut Taylor is chased and seized by a troop of gorillas on 
horseback. Saved for "research" purposes, Heston is taken to a city ruled by 
apes. Luckily for us, producer Arthur P Jacobs resisted Boulle's epic, 
futuristic vision of the future for budgetary reasons, and his penny-pinching 
surely saved the film from dating instantly. There are still some hippyish 
Age-of-Aquarius flourishes in the ape costumes, but the primitive architecture, 
somewhere between Greek and Roman, ominously anticipates the film's killer 
twist, which sprang not so from Boulle but the Twilight Zone's Rod Serling, who 
refined the shooting script.

Interestingly, for a film based on a single idea, it is the sum of its parts 
that make it so timeless – principally Jerry Goldsmith's eerie, organic score – 
while the cast makes easy work of ensuring the apes are simultaneously 
terrifying and, in the case of in Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall as Zira and 
Cornelius, incredibly sympathetic. Crucial to this is the film's staggering 
make-up, so ahead of its time that prosthetics artist John Chambers had to make 
do with an honorary award at that year's Oscars since special effects had yet 
to be deemed worthy of a category. Luckily, his handiwork was so good, he 
didn't have to wait long for another job, and he was swiftly tapped up by a 
grateful new employer: the CIA. (Yes, that's him as impersonated by John 
Goodman in Argo.) Damon Wise

(UK 1948) BRITISH LION FILM CORP Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive 
Graham Greene <https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene> went to his 
grave justifiably disappointed in the many movie adaptations derived from his 
novels. The Comedians, The Honorary Consul, The Human Factor, the first 
adaptations of The Quiet American and The End of the Affair: all of these fell 
short, or actively betrayed their source-novels. One of the fascinating 
conundrums of Greene's career is that this highly perceptive former film 
critic, fitfully brilliant screenwriter and author of so many novels dubbed 
"cinematic" should have suffered so badly at the hands of filmmakers, 
particularly in Hollywood.

The few successful films of his work tended to be adapted by Greene himself 
and/or made in Britain: John Boulting's Brighton Rock, Alberto Cavalcanti's 
Went the Day Well? and the long-unseen The Fallen Idol, which Greene and 
director Carol Reed made in 1948, a couple of years before they embarked on the 
worldwide hit that was The Third Man. Freely adapted from Greene's 1935 story 
The Basement Room, The Fallen Idol follows Philippe (Bobby Henrey), the 
7-year-old son of the French ambassador in London, who stumbles onto the 
adulterous affair between his father's valet Baines (Ralph Richardson) — the 
eponymous object of his worship — and Julie, an embassy secretary (Michele 
Morgan).

As pregnant with secrets and lies as any of Greene's spy stories, The Fallen 
Idol is also one of the great movies about childhood innocence accidentally 
violated by adults, harking back to Greene's literary idol Henry James' What 
Maisie Knew, and forward to LP Hartley's The Go-Between (whose 1970 adaptation 
by Joseph Losey is one of the great movies of its period). Reed, an often 
inconsistent film-maker, handles the brutal mechanics of the plot superbly, 
with the marbled interiors of the embassy contrasting sharply with his almost 
neo-realist outdoor shots of postwar London.John Patterson

8. The Long Goodbye  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/87359/long.goodbye>
 Elliott Gould in The Long Goodbye. Photo: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar 
Robert Altman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertaltman> developed his 
version of The Long Goodbye as the story of "Rip van Marlowe" – what happens 
when the 1940s private dick is dropped into a 1970s Los Angeles he would barely 
recognize as home. Instead of Humphrey Bogart of The Big Sleep, he's now the 
unbuttoned, floppy-haired Elliott Gould. Instead of dealing with sharp-tongued 
women in pin curls and shoulder pads, he's working for a Malibu housewife in a 
big sun-dress and bare feet. By updating Marlowe's environment but not his 
personality, Altman reinvents the man for the 1970s, a detective whose wit and 
skills can't be diminished by a world far more corrupt than he.

Altman and screenwriter Leigh Brackett take immense liberties with Raymond 
Chandler's source novel, inventing entire characters (like the vicious Marty 
Augustine) and eliminating major ones, like Sylvia Lennox's billionaire father. 
Though Altman and Brackett borrow the basic structure of the novel, The Long 
Goodbye is essentially a riff on Chandler's entire work and his influence on 
film. It's a revisionist noir that manages to bring one of the genre's biggest 
icons in on its scheme, both thumbing its nose at and revering the beloved 
private detective.

Marlowe is hilariously out of step with his surroundings here, shuffling 
around his space-age apartment building and muttering at the hippie chicks 
doing yoga next door. But he's still the hero, the only man who cares enough to 
give Terry Lennox the justice he deserves, the guy who shrugs off a violent 
gangster to keep looking for his missing cat. The world has gone madder than 
Chandler ever imagined, but Marlowe proves he can stand the most difficult test 
of time – and he never has to give up his cigarettes or his 1948 Lincoln 
Continental to do it.Katey Rich

7. Lolita <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79911/lolita>
 James Mason and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's film of Lolita (1962). 
Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive 
Stanley Kubrick <https://www.theguardian.com/film/stanleykubrick> once said 
that if he'd known how much trouble it was going to get him into, with various 
censor bodies and religious pressure groups, he would never have made Lolita. 
It says something about our changing world that even though censorship has 
relaxed a lot in the last 51 years, Vladimir Nabokov's hot-button novel would 
now be thought even further beyond the pale than ever. Indeed, it's quite 
incredible that one of the few compromises the exacting Kubrick had to make was 
to raise the age of his young heroine from Nabokov's 12-and-a-half to a somehow 
more permissible 14.

But if it seems surprising that the thought police have left Kubrick's film 
alone in this jittery post-Yewtree world, in retrospect Lolita seems 
surprisingly future-proof. Although primarily identified as a director of cool, 
detached spectacle movies, Kubrick also had a rich sense of dark, sardonic wit, 
and the dry comic elements of Lolita ensure that the film cannot be 
misinterpreted. Hinting at the broad humour that would spill out in Dr 
Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick's Lolita is best read as a satire 
of male desire, with Sue Lyon's title character becoming the focus of the 
pitiful Humbert Humbert's midlife crisis.

As Humbert, James Mason's musical, gentrified tones go a long way to ensuring 
that the film retains some decorum, even while the infatuated professor goes 
through with a sham marriage to the girl's widowed mother (a nicely contrasting 
camp performance by Shelley Winters). But the standout is perhaps a small but 
pivotal role byPeter Sellers <https://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-sellers> 
as Humbert's nemesis, the chameleonic Quilty – a sleazy playwright who also 
vies for Lolita's affections. Although it is often seen as a precursor to the 
multiple parts played in Dr Strangelove, Sellers' turn here is a reminder of 
his true potential, soon to be swallowed up by a stream of ever more awful Pink 
Panther films.DW

6. We Need to Talk About Kevin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141828/we-need-to-talk-about-kevin>
 'Courageously uningratiating': Tilda Swinton and Jasper Newell in We Need to 
Talk About Kevin. 
In Lynne Ramsay's meticulously controlled adaptation of Lionel Shriver's 
novel, we only glimpse the odd drop of blood. That's quite an achievement given 
that the pivotal event is a high-school massacre. Having resolved not to show 
what happens when 15-year-old Kevin (Ezra Miller) begins picking off his 
schoolmates with a crossbow, Ramsay crams her film instead with proxy horrors 
and surrogate scares. Red paint is used in revenge attacks against Kevin's 
mother Eva (Tilda Swinton). Revellers caked in tomato pulp at Spain's La 
Tomatina festival stand in for the victims of the massacre. Red is everywhere. 
One shot even shows Eva sipping claret while a red teddy bear lies face-down in 
exasperated despair.

Readers of Shriver's novel will have been divided between those who saw the 
character as an uncomplicated monster, and those who distrusted his mother's 
control of the narrative. It's this tension which the picture exploits 
skilfully: Ramsay's screenplay dispenses with the format of the book, which was 
structured as a series of letters from Eva to her husband Franklin, and with 
chronology itself. Plus the movie is expertly cast. Swinton is physically sharp 
and snappy, moving as though she has scissor blades rather than bones under the 
skin. This lends her a kinship not with the doughy John C Reilly, as Franklin, 
but with Miller as Kevin. Both actors have forks of black hair and angular, 
androgynous profiles; at least one sequence intercuts their faces to suggest 
that the characters are interchangeable.

Ramsay has made a surprisingly playful adaptation invoking horror-movie 
mannerisms one moment, then socking it to us the next with bravura sequences. 
Among them is the Diane Arbus-esque highpoint: a nocturnal drive through the 
suburbs on Hallowe'en where masked trick-or-treaters lurch at the car windows.

Leo Tolstoy <https://www.theguardian.com/books/leonikolaevichtolstoy> and 
Bernard Rose go way back. The British director was once barred from the editing 
suite where his adaptation of Anna Karenina was being butchered. Perhaps it is 
a kind of revenge that Rose then took another Tolstoy work — The Death of Ivan 
Ilyich — and did it resolutely his own way. Ivansxtc (pronounced "Ivan's 
Ecstasy"), the first of four low-budget Tolstoy adaptations which Rose shot on 
high-definition digital video, tells of hedonistic Hollywood agent Ivan Beckman 
(Danny Huston), a know-it-all who doesn't even know himself. "I draw the line 
at smack," he says solemnly when discussing his habit. A moment later he 
changes his mind. "Maybe I'll try it. Smack is great!" One inspiration was 
Rose's own former agent, the wheeler-dealing Jay Moloney, who hanged himself 
three years after being sacked from the mighty CAA.

Ivan's eventual death is from lung cancer. But as befits a film inspired by 
Tolstoy, Ivan's true malaise is not physical but spiritual. This is a world of 
stretch limousines longer than the California coast, and lines of cocaine 
longer than stretch limousines. The characters, including a film-maker who 
attends Ivan's funeral because it is the only way he can corner the agent who 
has been dodging his calls, are fully formed and keenly observed. As Don West, 
an A-list superstar with a vampiric sexual appetite, Peter Weller gives the 
sleaziness a focus. He is more chillingly robotic than he ever was in RoboCop: 
at least in that movie you could sense the humanity behind the metal husk. Rose 
does not push the point, but West could be a metaphor for Hollywood itself—West 
as in West Coast, perhaps? There is nothing behind this demon's carnivorous 
desire but more carnivorous desire. In Rose's film, on the other hand, you can 
feel pity, disgust and compassion.RG

4. Adaptation  <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/94517/adaptation>
 Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) develops a serious case of 
writer's block in the comedy Adaptation. Photograph: AP 
In the late 1990s Charlie Kaufman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlie-kaufman> was commissioned to write an 
adaptation of The Orchard Thief, a non-fiction book by Susan Orlean. But 
Kaufman was blocked, he couldn't find a way through, and so he tore up his 
draft and wrote Adaptation instead. He wrote himself as the star, concocted a 
fictional brother called Donald and then, magnanimously, found a supporting 
role for Orlean as a kind of lusty Lady Macbeth who snorts narcotics, sleeps 
with her subjects and plots the bloody death of her enemies. Orlean leafed 
through the script in a state of mounting confusion. "The idea of being 
portrayed as a drug-snorting mess just didn't square with me," she would later 
admit.

Adaptation doesn't particularly square with anything and that's what makes it 
great. It's a Houdini act, a feat of escapology; a freestyle theory on the 
creative process in which the avoidance and the struggle becomes the story 
itself. It helps, of course, that the film is as funny as it is 
self-referential. Kaufman shrewdly elects to puncture the angsty posturing of 
Charlie by having Donald beavering away on a trash thriller called The Three in 
which a serial killer suffering from multiple personality disorder effectively 
winds up in pursuit of himself. Naturally Charlie is disgusted; he wants to 
take the high road. But his own script's going nowhere and he gets lost in the 
swamp. Does Adaptation lose its way in these frantic final moments, when the 
cars flip over, the alligators gather and the body count mounts? Emphatically 
not - it is all of a piece, the last magic trick. When Charlie is unable to 
bring his tale to a close, it is left to Donald to throw himself into the mix 
and send us out with a bang.Xan Brooks

3. Brokeback Mountain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/108296/brokeback.mountain> 
 Brokeback Mountain 
Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are a pair of straight arrow cowboys who take a 
job herding sheep and have sex on the hillside when the sun goes down. Jack and 
Ennis love each other and want to be together, but they can't bring themselves 
to admit this because their love is unthinkable. Later they will both marry and 
have children and lead conventional lives that feel somehow straitened and 
false. Brokeback mountain was a dream, although it shines more bright than the 
reality which follows.

Ang Lee's 2005 romance stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jake-gyllenhaal>, while the Oscar-winning 
script was penned by Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry. It is based on a short 
story by E Annie Proulx, slender and heartfelt, a tale that covers the ground 
with the lightest of steps. The film has the same spirit, the same yearning, 
the same beautiful breadth of vision. It sketches the life-spans of two men, 
lived largely in the shadows. On its theatrical release, Brokeback Mountain 
found itself billed as "the gay cowboy movie", although debate has since ranged 
on its true orientation. Some critics argued that the characters would be 
better described as being bisexual, on the borderline, with Ennis shading right 
and Jack Twist leaning left. But I'm not sure that it matters. Brokeback 
Mountain is able to rise above such labels, even as its characters twitch and 
struggle and feel imprisoned by them. It is a film about the love that 
liberates and the fear that inhibits - and about that one golden summer that 
gallops into the past.XB

2. The Conformist <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36277/conformist>

Conformist. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/MARAN FILM 
His reputation has receded over the horizon somewhat since his death in 1990, 
but in his day Alberto Moravia was a quintessential intellectual European 
novelist, patrolling the moral lines along which politics, which for him meant 
fascism, class, particularly the idle bourgeoisie he came from, religion, and 
transgressive sexual behaviour all intersected, at great cost to his 
characters. Many of his novels were international bestsellers, and several were 
adapted by big-name directors. These included Two Women by Vittorio da Sica, 
Contempt by Godard, and Boredom, adapted by Damiano Damiani in 1962, and remade 
by Cedric Kahn in 1998.

But Bernardo Bertolucci's adaptation of Moravia's 1951 novel Il Conformista 
stands above them all as a lasting achievement in international cinema, and as 
the pinnacle of Bertolucci's career. Its account of the neuroses and 
self-loathing of a sexually confused would-be fascist (Jean-Louis Trintignant) 
aching to fit in in 1938 Rome, who is despatched to Paris to murder his 
anti-fascist former college professor, was deemed an instant classic on release.

It was, and is, a highly self-conscious and stylistically venturesome pinnacle 
of late modernism, drawing from the full range of recent Italian movie history: 
a little neo-neorealism, a lot of stark and blinding Antonioni-style 
mise-en-scène, some moments redolent of Fellini. And it was all framed within 
an evocation of the frivolous fascist-era film-making style derided by 
Bertolucci's generation as "white telephone" cinema. Add a dose of unhealthy 
sexual confusion and nudity aplenty, and it's hardly surprising that it was one 
of the international hits of the year.

Certain sequences linger long in the memory: the brutal murder of the 
professor in a snowbound forest; the all-white lunatic asylum where Clerici 
meets his mad father; and an astonishing dance sequence with Domininque Sanda 
and Stefania Sandrelli in (and out of, and back into) a glass dancehall (a 
foretaste of Last Tango) It also offered the blueprint for the new wave of 
Hollywood film-makers to a different kind of cinema and a roadmap of new formal 
possibilities.JP

1. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36306/one-flew-over-the-cuckoo-s-nest>
 Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975). 
Photograph: Roland Grant Archive 
Grinning and jeering, movie history's most troublesome psychiatric patient 
Randle "Mac" MacMurphy grabs the shower head in the Tub Room and sprays it like 
an anarchic water cannon. He's not attacking the nurses or the doctors – but 
his fellow patients, the ones who need waking up, the ones who consent to being 
docile prisoner-patients and who've made their own jail.

Milos Foreman's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is adapted by Bo 
Goldman and Lawrence Hauben from the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, via a Broadway 
version by Dale Wasserman staged one year after the book's publication starring
Kirk Douglas <https://www.theguardian.com/film/kirkdouglas>, whose son Michael 
produced the subsequent movie version and had the difficult task of explaining 
to Kirk that he now wanted someone younger for the film.

It is a counter-cultural nightmare which retains its power to shock. Who 
hasn't had the nightmare or masochistic fantasy of somehow wrongly ending up in 
a psychiatric hospital and realising that every panicky thing you would then do 
— scream, plead, rage, desperately mimic the mannerisms of sanity that would 
otherwise come naturally — would of course be interpreted as madness? And 
would, in time, become madness?

Jack Nicholson plays Mac, a natural born troublemaker and backtalker doing 
time for statutory rape. ("She was 15, going on 35.") He has been handed over 
to the psychiatric authorities under suspicion of faking madness to get out of 
jail and into a cushy mental facility. But this sinister place, with its drugs, 
muzak, electro-convulsive shock therapy and surgical intervention, is like jail 
but worse. One of the women Mac later sneaks in points out another depressing 
resemblance: "This looks like my high school!" Only a crazy person would 
pretend to be crazy to come here. Far too late, Mac realises the Catch-22. As 
Mac gets to know his fellow patients, including Martini, played by a young 
Danny DeVito and Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) a huge Native American who never 
speaks, it becomes his burden to symbolise pure craziness and wildly defiant 
opposition to the label of craziness.

Cuckoo's Nest is very similar to prison-break movies like The Great Escape and 
Cool Hand Luke, or even military movies like Full Metal Jacket; but Mac has not 
been drafted or imprisoned as such. He is astonished to realise that he is one 
of the very few people actually forced to be there: the rest are voluntary 
in-patients who have become institutionalised. Prison or war movies take place 
in a sweaty male world, but these disturbed guys are surrounded by delicate 
women: nurses, particularly the cool and headmistressy Nurse Ratched, played by 
Louise Fletcher: a sharp-tongued high priestess dispensing tranquilliser drugs 
in a sort of holy communion ceremony. In fact, she is not the two-dimensional 
sadist of repute. In a medical conference, Ratched is shown discussing Mac's 
case with what appears to be interest and compassion. It is she who fatefully 
tells the hospital director he should be kept in the hospital and not returned 
to prison as a faker. But is that simply due to her insidious clinical urge to 
subdue and suppress?

From the first, Mac flirts with and needles Nurse Ratched; he challenges her 
authority. He organises basketball sessions, demands time away from 
group-therapy to watch TV sports; it is cheerful Mac who improves the patients' 
morale and he even (briefly) cures the stammer of a gentle, vulnerable kid by 
getting him laid. It's not simply that Mac is the only sane person in a world 
of madness. He is the only functioning doctor.

But was Mac pretending to be crazy in any case? Cuckoo's Nest emerged at a 
time when RD Laing's anti-psychiatry theories were current. Mac points to a 
patient and shouts: "You're no crazier than the average asshole walking around 
in the street!" to which Nurse Ratched icily replies: "A very challenging 
observation." Anglo-American academe was absorbing the works of Michel Foucault 
who argued that prisons, asylums and hospitals were all constructed by the 
west's punitive need for surveillance and control — all in the name of 
rationalism. In fact, Foucault contrasted the prison-hospitals of the 
Enlightenment with a medieval world in which mad people roamed as free as in 
Sebastian Brant's 15th-century satire Ship of Fools. It's very like the jolly 
fishing expedition Mac organises for his new friends by stealing a boat and 
sailing around in a carnival spirit with his crazy crew, and even triumphantly 
catching a few fish, before they are all caught and herded back inside. Before 
that, Mac had pinched a bus, and driven his disciples around in that — very 
like Ken Kesey himself and his merry pranksters in the 60s Magic Bus, 
immortalised in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.

In Foreman's later movie Amadeus, the lunatic asylum was a wretched place of 
despair, presided over by the self-hating Salieri, crooning from his 
wheelchair: "Mediocrities everywhere … I absolve you … I absolve you …" But 
that isn't exactly how Foreman sees the hospital here. The guilty parties are 
not the patients but the malign dullards of the courts and the medical 
establishment, more culpable even than poor Nurse Ratched himself whose own 
spite is a simple and rather human failure to exert control after Mac organises 
a chaotic party.

This film is not a horror film or a Gothic fantasy, although with its creepy 
whitewalled colour scheme and sinister affectless calm it has the look of a 
futurist sci-fi. Despite its occasional stagey and verbose tendencies, it is 
compelling and absorbing — and it has a factual base. After all, Rose Kennedy, 
sister of John F Kennedy, had a lobotomy performed on her at the age of 23 
because her father Joe decided her behaviour was unstable. Was she just 
spirited? Rebellious? Who knows? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a mordant, 
painful and intensely subversive film.Peter Bradshaw
