How did you come to write River of Smoke?
River of Smoke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780719568893/river-of-smoke>
 is the second novel in a series that began as a trilogy (I call it the Ibis 
Trilogy). The first book wasSea of Poppies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780719568954/sea-of-poppies>
; soon after I started writing it I realised that the characters and their 
stories would take more than one book. The books are not meant to be a single 
linear narrative (if that had been the case then it would have been a single, 
very long book). I always thought of the relationship between the books as a 
tangential one (as, for example, in Lawrence Durrell'sAlexandria Quartet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571283934/the-alexandria-quartet-justine-balthazar-mountolive-clea>
). Some of the characters recur, but each book has its own themes, settings, 
mood, spirit and so on. In this sense each of the books can be read as a 
complete and self-sufficient novel in its own right.

What was most difficult about it?
The setting. Most of the action takes place in Canton (Guangzhou) in 1838 and 
1839. To get the background right was a real challenge: I had to learn some 
Cantonese, for example.

What did you most enjoy?
The travel! I spent several weeks in Guangzhou and my visits to China have 
been extremely rewarding in many different ways.

How long did it take?
About three and a half years.

What has changed for you since it was first published?
Both my children are in college now. This is a bigger change than I had 
imagined.

Who's your favourite writer?
It varies with the year, the month and even the week. My favourite writer of 
the moment isPhilip Hensher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/30/philip-hensher-life-in-writing>
, whose new book,Scenes from Early Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780007433704/scenes-from-early-life>
, I am currently reading.

What are your other inspirations?
My rule, when I'm stuck and in need of inspiration, is "read the Russians".

Give us a writing tip.
Writers' tips are usually about revision and rewriting; daydreaming is rarely 
mentioned, although it is actually a far more important part of the process.

What, if anything, would you do differently if you were starting the book 
again?
I would pace myself better.

What are you working on now?
The next book in the trilogy.
