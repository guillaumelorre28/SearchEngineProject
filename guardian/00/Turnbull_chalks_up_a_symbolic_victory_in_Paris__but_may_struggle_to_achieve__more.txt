Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> 
came to the Paris climate meeting with good intentions but no political room to 
do much to prove them.


His big pledge – to ratify Kyoto 2 – was an almost perfect example of his 
dilemma.

It did send a signal to the international community that Australia brings a 
new attitude to the international talks. The change isn’t just a line from the 
government’s spinners, it is acknowledged by veteran negotiators.

But while it was heralded as a “very important symbol” in Paris, at home it 
had to be sold to the Coalition party room on the basis that – because it would 
allow Australia to “carry over” reductions from an earlier period – it would 
help meet our 2020 target without doing much at all.

The promise won a smattering of applause in the auditorium, although the 
enthusiasm of the audience might also have been waning after five hours of 
three minute speeches by world leaders.

But it wasn’t anywhere near big enough for Turnbull to stride to the lectern 
like Canada’s new prime ministerJustin Trudeau who declared  
<http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-address-climate-change-paris-1.3343394>
“Canada is back, my friends. We’re here to help.”

Tony Abbott and Trudeau’s predecessor Stephen Harper combined in international 
forums to defeat pro-climate change motions

, but unlike Trudeau Turnbull does not yet have the comfort of his own election 
victory to forge his own policy path.

And so, despite the fact the government has just released figures showing it 
is already on track to meet the minimum 2020 target – a 5% reduction in 
emissions based on 2000 levels – Turnbull can’t do the logical thing and 
announce he intends to achieve more.

And despite the Australian government’s strong push for other countries to 
review and ramp up their targets every five years, Turnbull would not 
explicitly say that’s what the Australian government would also do, instead 
muttering something vague about the “mood of the global community”.

And even though and more and more global leaders and institutions are calling 
for an internationally linked carbon price in Paris – like German chancellor 
Angela Merkel, French president François Hollande, Trudeau, the World Bank 
(including its president Jim Yong Kim), the International Monetary Fund and 
scores of chief executives – Turnbull doesn’t even utter the name of the policy 
he once believed in so firmly he lost his job over it. He has to choke out 
something about Direct Action being really very effective.

A re-elected Turnbull government almost certainly would be open to a tougher 
target – especially after it allows the purchase of international permits when 
it reviews its policy in 2017, after the next federal election. It will have to 
find a better policy then too, unless it wants to be winding down its 2030 
target while arguing that everybody else’s should be increasing.

And the state of the budget means Turnbull was unable to bring to Paris the 
other thing that gets noticed – big wads of money.

Australia joined the US initiative for countries to double their spending on 
clean energy research and development – the details will come in the innovation 
statement – but the $1bn on climate financing will somehow be found from the 
already stretched international aid budget.

Turnbull’s reception in Paris wasn’t so much about what he said or pledged, as 
the fact that he wasn’t Tony Abbott.
