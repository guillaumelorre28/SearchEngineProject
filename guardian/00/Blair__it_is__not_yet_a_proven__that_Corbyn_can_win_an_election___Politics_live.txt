Afternoon summary

 * Steve Hilton, the prime minister’s former “blue skies thinker,” has said 
the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been “bullied” by the Westminster 
establishment because of his unconventional approach to politics.

AsHeather Stewart reports, David Cameron used a Commons encounter with Corbyn 
in February totake him to task for not properly fastening a tie

, saying: “I know what my mother would say. I think she’d look across the 
dispatch box and she’d say: put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the 
national anthem.” But Cameron’s former adviser, in London this week to promote 
the UK edition of his bookMore Human 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/steve-hilton-more-human-review-david-cameron>
, told the Guardian: “What I really hated about the reaction to Corbyn at the 
very beginning was this immediate, … very bullying ganging-up by the political 
establishment to say: this guy is not doing it the way we are used to doing it; 
he’s not wearing a tie; he’s not reshuffling his cabinet in the way we’re used 
to doing it.” He added: “I thought it was incredibly unattractive.” 
 * Momentum, the grassroots group of Jeremy Corbyn supporters, is to swing 
behind the campaign to stay in the EU with a month to go before the referendum.

Cutting EU migration would lead to lower growth and higher taxes, says NIESR

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has today published a 
paper looking at the impact of cutting immigration on growth. The NIESR is 
describing it as “the most comprehensive analysis of the long-term impacts of 
immigration on the UK economy to date”.

The report models what might happen to the economy over the next 50 years 
under two conditions, a Remain net migration scenario (based on current 
longterm projections) and a Leave one (assuming net migration from EU countries 
will be cut by two thirds).

It finds that, under the Leave scenario, GDP per head would be lower, but not 
massively lower. By 2065 it would be 1% lower than otherwise, the report says.

But post-tax wages would be 2% lower than otherwise, the report says. That is 
because the reduction in immigration would result in the population being 
proportionately older, with the result that government spending as a proportion 
of GDP would be higher, and taxes would be higher (£400 per person higher, in 
2014 prices).

Here is the full 38-page report (pdf). 
<http://www.niesr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publications/dp460.pdf> And here is 
an extract from the news release. 
<http://www.niesr.ac.uk/media/press-release-new-research-lower-output-and-higher-taxes-impact-reducing-immigration-12519#.V0RuAHqHr7J>

The paper compares “Leave” and “Remain” scenarios for migration to the UK 
after the referendum, and assesses their macroeconomic impacts. “Leave” assumes 
that net migration from the EU countries will decline by two thirds compared to 
“Remain”. By 2065, in the Leave scenario, aggregate GDP and GDP per person are 
9% and 1% lower respectively compared to the “Remain” scenario. Reduced 
migration after leaving the EU has a significant negative impact on the public 
finances, primarily because of a higher dependency ratio, which is the fraction 
of young and old people of the total population. Accordingly government 
spending rises as a share of GDP by 1.1 percentage points in 2065, requiring an 
increase in taxation of about £400 per person (2014 pounds). As a result, 
post-tax wages are 2% lower in the Leave scenario.

And here is a quote from Katerina Lisenkova, one of the report’s two authors. 
She said:

 Our research shows that lower migration has an overall negative effect on the 
UK economy. In general EU immigrants benefit the UK economy for two main 
reasons – they are on average much younger and are more highly qualified than 
the general population.

Ken Clarke says London is 'the money laundering capital of the world'

MPs are still debating the Queen’s speech and Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative 
former chancellor, has just finished his contribution. In a wide-ranging 
speech, which included a passage about how corporate pay levels being far too 
high, Clarke said he was particularly pleased the speech included measures to 
tackle money laundering, because London is “the money laundering capital of the 
world.

In the fight against crime in this country we are very bad at dealing with 
white collar crime. There is growing awareness today that if you wish to rob a 
bank, you go to the Libor market. You don’t put a balaclava on and pick up a 
shotgun, that’s much less profitable. At last we are starting to do something 
about it. I welcome this bill [the criminal finances bill] and I hope I can be 
reassured it will tackle not just tax evasion, which is quite rightly high on 
the public agenda, but money laundering. London is still the money laundering 
capital of the world. If you’re an African despot or a serious international 
corrupt criminal, London is the best place to put your money because you can 
trust the bankers to look after it and not steal it from you. I welcome the 
fact that we are going to improve the reporting of suspicious activities.

Farage says Cameron's EU referendum tactics are 'pretty close to cheating'

Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has been campaigning in Dudley today. According 
to the Press Association, here are some of the things he has been saying.

 * Farage accused David Cameron and George Osborne of feeding people “a 
constant diet of lies” in the EU campaign.He also said they were “using the 
whole apparatus of state in a way that, frankly, is pretty close to cheating”. 
 * He claimed the Remain campaign scare tactics would backfire. 
In the end I just feel that all these threats may well backfire. This time 
last year Remain were a long way ahead. This time this year, they’re a little 
bit ahead.

 * He dismissed the Treasury’s claim that leaving the EU would trigger a 
recession. 
Is there any evidence to say there won’t be a recession if we stay in? The 
British economy is not doing that well. Our 2% growth is funded by a population 
increase of half a million people a year and by massive government borrowing.

They talk about about the pound going down. The pound has been going down 
since July 2014. Britain is not in that great a state.

 * He said the campaign was ultimately about sovereignty, not economics. 
But this isn’t about economics. I can tell you we will be better off out, 
he’ll tell you we’ll be better off in. Ultimately this referendum is not about 
trade, it’s not about money - it’s about political union. Do we wish to remain 
part of a political union that makes the majority of our laws?

He also appeared to criticise Vote Leave for focusing so prominently on the 
claim that leaving the EU could free up up to £350m a week for the NHS.

It’s all well and good to say we could have more money for the NHS but 
actually this referendum is about more than that. Our politicians have given 
away control of our country. Our message has got to be clear - we believe in 
this country, we believe in its people and we want out country back.

 * He claimed Cameron was being hypocritical when he claimed this morning 
leaving the EU could push up the cost of a holiday abroad.Farage said: 
How dare Cameron talk about the cost of holidays when it’s him with air 
passenger duty that’s put hundreds of pounds on a family going to Florida or 
Disneyland or anywhere else? He’s the man that’s made holidays expensive. We do 
not need a European commission to have competitive air fares - it’s so typical 
of Cameron to make the accusation for the very thing that he himself is guilty 
of.

Alan Johnson, chair of Labour In for Britain, has been taking part in a 
Mumsnet Q&A on the EU referendum this afternoon. 
<http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/mumsnet_live_events/2642044-EU-Referendum-Webchat-with-Alan-Johnson-MP-Tuesday-24-May-at-12-30pm?messages=100&pg=1>

The first question he answered came from someone who asked when the plague of 
locusts would arrive if Britain voted for Brexit. He replied:

I can confidently reveal the date of the plague of locusts is 24th of June if 
we vote to leave - in which case, the plan is to grant locusts free movement, 
anywhere in the EU.

Fallon says Brexit would be 'absolutely applauded in Moscow'

Richard Norton-Taylor

Leaving the EU would be an “extraordinarily irresponsible thing to do at a 
very dangerous moment”, and be “absolutely applauded in Moscow”,Michael Fallon, 
the defence secretary, told MPs on Tuesday.


He seized the opportunity presented by an appearance before the Commons 
defence committee - chaired by the Brexit supporter Julian Lewis - to mount 
impassioned support for the UK remaining a member of the EU.


“A huge amount is hanging on the vote on 23 June not just for the people of 
this country but for the collective security ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and the West”, he told the 
crosssparty group of MPs.


President Putin would not have had to pay a price for annexing Crimea and 
destabilising eastern Ukraine without the EU, and sanctions would have been 
much weaker had not Britain been a member of the EU, Fallon said.


Britain was “in the lead” in getting the EU to impose tough trade and 
commercial sacntions on Russia, he insisted. “The fact we were there and able 
to lead the debate, the EU was able to ensure the toughest sanctions were 
imposed.”


Tough sanctions “would not have happened without the EU and would not have 
happened if the UK was not within it”, Fallon told the MPs.

Lunchtime summary

 * Tony Blair has expressed scepticism about Jeremy Corbyn’s ability to win a 
general election. In remarks at a Prospect event, the former Labour prime 
minister said that the far left and the far right were similar in that they 
were both “isolationists against free trade”, and that centre ground 
politicians like himself were struggling to find anything to say to people who 
wanted change. (See1.22pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/may/24/eu-referendum-both-sides-treating-people-like-simpletons-says-steve-hilton-politics-live?page=with:block-57444338e4b0d7feade1cf2b#block-57444338e4b0d7feade1cf2b>
 * Blair has admitted he profoundly underestimated the forces that were going 
to be unleashed in Iraq after the war, and says his understanding of the Middle 
East is much deeper now than at the time of the invasion in 2003. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/tony-blair-i-underestimated-forces-of-destabilisation-in-iraq-chilcot-report>
 * David Cameron has said the cost of a family holiday could rise by £230 and 
new limits on duty free could put an end to “booze cruises” to the continent if 
Britain votes to leave the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/family-holidays-could-cost-more-after-brexit-pm-claims-falling-pound>
 * Cameron has insisted the Conservatives will “come together” after the EU 
referendum in response to claims he could be deposed. Responding to reports 
that some Tory MPs will press for a confidence vote in his leadership even if 
he wins the EU referendum, he said:

Obviously this is such a big issue that you do see arguments between political 
parties... and there are going to be passionate arguments, there’s going to be 
strong arguments and passion on both sides.

Do I believe at the end of this we can all come together and accept the 
result? Absolutely I do.

The one thing all Conservatives agree on is that it is right to have this 
referendum, right to have this debate and right to abide by the decision of the 
British people.

 * Birmingham council has announced that it wants its children’s services to 
be run by a voluntary trust. 
<http://birminghamnewsroom.com/birmingham-childrens-services-statement/>As the 
Press Association reports, the department at Birmingham City Council has 
previously been labelled a “national disgrace” by Ofsted chief inspector Sir 
Michael Wilshaw. Previous high-profile cases of child deaths in the Midlands 
city, including those of two-year-old Keanu Williams in 2011 and seven-year-old 
Khyra Ishaq in 2008, had led to the department and other agencies coming under 
fire. Now the authority has announced a voluntary trust will run the department 
under a “new model” which will put “social workers at its centre”. 
 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has said an extra £10m is to be pumped 
into English and Welsh prisons to tackle a rising tide of violence and suicides.
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/prisons-urgent-funds-tackle-suicide-disorder>
 * Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has rejected claims that he 
has been politically biased over Brexit. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/24/eurozone-greek-bailout-debt-relief-business-live?page=with:block-57444417e4b038ba175e3e7c#block-57444417e4b038ba175e3e7c>
 * George Osborne, the chancellor, has fallen behind in his deficit-reduction 
programme just a month into the new financial year, with the government 
borrowing more than expected in April. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/24/george-osborne-financial-year-government-borrowing-deficit-reduction-ons>
 * A Labour MP has claimed Russia may be bombing civilians in Syria partly in 
an attempt to secure a British exit from the European Union. Speaking at 
foreign office questions, Labour’s Geraint Davies said: 
Do you accept on the Ukraine that Russian bombing of Syrian civilians to 
provoke refugees and to possibly tilt the balance in favour of Brexit is part 
of a strategy to basically fragment European resolve in terms of Ukraine?

Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, said he did not accept this. He replied:

There is definitely a Russian strategy to try to fragment European resolve. I 
think it’s probably a step too far to suggest that Russia’s engagement in Syria 
is only designed to apply pressure over Ukraine. Russia has important and 
historic equities in Syria and is seeking to defend its interest there.

 * Sadiq Khan, the new mayor of London, has made a string of appointments, 
including making Valerie Shawcross his deputy mayor for transport. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/may/24/sadiq-khan-puts-women-to-the-fore-in-latest-appointments-to-mayoral-team>
 * Britons who have lived abroad for more than 15 years will not be allowed to 
vote in the EU referendum, the supreme court has ruled.

Corbyn calls for more 'strong women's voices' in EU referendum campaign

Harriet Harman, Labour’s former interim leader, has written to Ofcom to 
complain that male politicians are being allowed to dominate the EU referendum 
debate on the airwaves. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/harriet-harman-criticises-lack-of-female-voices-in-eu-debate>
She was highlighting this issue at an event this morning.

Jeremy Corbyn is now also saying that more women’s voices need to be heard in 
the EU referendum debate. In a speech to a rally in Hastings tonight he will 
say:

So far, the referendum debate taking place across the country, has been 
dominated by men, and mostly Tory men. This needs to change, we need to hear 
more diverse voices in this important debate, we need to hear more strong 
women’s voices.

Women across the country are being let down by a Conservative government that 
is failing on housing, failing our NHS, failing to create good quality jobs and 
failing even against its own economic targets.

We’re going to hear a strong woman’s voice tomorrow. David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> will be missing PMQs, 
because he is going to Japan for the G7 summit, and so PMQs will be George 
Osborne v Angela Eagle.

Tony Blair backed the tone of the Remain campaign saying they were mounting a 
strong campaign focussing on the right issues including the risks to the 
British economy household incomes and the country’s role in the world.

He also hinted he would be making a joint intervention with other former prime 
ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major to urge the country to stay in the EU 
“there is a role for former prime ministers,” he said.

Millions of EU workers face uncertainty over whether they can stay in the UK, 
while British expats in Europe could also lose the right to remain, own 
property or get free healthcare in the event of Brexit,David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has claimed.

The prime minister said there was no guarantee that UK citizens abroad or EU 
citizens in the UK would maintain their rights to reside unless there is a vote 
to remain.

Brexit campaigners claim the rights of expats are preserved under the Vienna 
convention but a number of academic and legal opinions have argued that EU 
citizenship would end with Brexit.

Cameron said such rights and others to own property and get healthcare in the 
EU were “certain if we stay and uncertain if we leave”, while also arguing that 
people could have to pay £60 for a Schengen visa just to travel through other 
European countries.

It is the latest in a long string of warnings from Cameron about problems that 
could be caused by leaving the EU, which have led to fury among Tory 
politicians pushing for the UK to leave.

Blair says it is 'not yet a proven concept' that Corbynism can win an election

Patrick Wintour

At the Prospect event this morning Tony Blair insisted that his brand of 
centre ground politics was not dead, but admitted that the centre ground was 
losing its traction and not providing answers to those that wanted an end to 
the status quo.

He claimed the source of some of the insurgent support for Donald Trump and 
Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> was similar, 
saying “these people are riding the anger they are not providing the answers”.

He also challenged Corbyn, centr saying:

Let us say, it is not yet a proven concept that Corbynism can win an election. 
It is clear that they can take over a political party, what is not so clear to 
me yet is that they can take over a country.

Where fringes of left and right meet each other is essentially as 
isolationists against free trade. It is true that the left want to hang the 
bankers and the right want to clear out the immigrants, but in the much of the 
psychology and attitude they have got a lot in common.

He said the centre is not back into contention, arguing at present centre 
ground politicians “look today as if we are managers of the status quo and not 
changers of it”.

He also questioned the basis of Corbyn’s support in the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party.

If you break down the analysis of the people who are joining the Labour party 
it is not clear to me those that should feel most angry about their personal 
situation and those joining are the same people. The world of the Twitterati is 
gives you a sense of belonging and a sense of insurgency. It was about shaking 
the system and rattling the cage. People do feel frustrated and social media 
gives them the ability to feel that at scale and at speed, and the centre looks 
as if we are saying it is all very complicated. We are not in the right 
conversation with people like this.

He said the centre ground should be discussing issues such as the role of 
technology and big data in public services, the use of monetary policy such as 
quantitative easing and the future of student debt.

He also dismissed the binary debate over austerity saying it misunderstands 
the way economy works.

 * Steve Hilton, the prime minister’s former “blue skies thinker,” has said 
the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been “bullied” by the Westminster 
establishment because of his unconventional approach to politics. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/ex-cameron-adviser-steve-hilton-attacks-bullying-of-jeremy-corbyn>
AsHeather Stewart reports, David Cameron used a Commons encounter with Corbyn 
in February totake him to task for not properly fastening a tie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/david-cameron-launches-personal-attack-on-jeremy-corbyns-appearance>
, saying: “I know what my mother would say. I think she’d look across the 
dispatch box and she’d say: put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the 
national anthem.” But Cameron’s former adviser, in London this week to promote 
the UK edition of his bookMore Human 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/steve-hilton-more-human-review-david-cameron>
, told the Guardian: “What I really hated about the reaction to Corbyn at the 
very beginning was this immediate, … very bullying ganging-up by the political 
establishment to say: this guy is not doing it the way we are used to doing it; 
he’s not wearing a tie; he’s not reshuffling his cabinet in the way we’re used 
to doing it.” He added: “I thought it was incredibly unattractive.” 
 * Momentum, the grassroots group of Jeremy Corbyn supporters, is to swing 
behind the campaign to stay in the EU with a month to go before the referendum.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has today published a 
paper looking at the impact of cutting immigration on growth. The NIESR is 
describing it as “the most comprehensive analysis of the long-term impacts of 
immigration on the UK economy to date”.

The report models what might happen to the economy over the next 50 years 
under two conditions, a Remain net migration scenario (based on current 
longterm projections) and a Leave one (assuming net migration from EU countries 
will be cut by two thirds).

It finds that, under the Leave scenario, GDP per head would be lower, but not 
massively lower. By 2065 it would be 1% lower than otherwise, the report says.

But post-tax wages would be 2% lower than otherwise, the report says. That is 
because the reduction in immigration would result in the population being 
proportionately older, with the result that government spending as a proportion 
of GDP would be higher, and taxes would be higher (£400 per person higher, in 
2014 prices).

Here is the full 38-page report (pdf). 
<http://www.niesr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publications/dp460.pdf> And here is 
an extract from the news release. 
<http://www.niesr.ac.uk/media/press-release-new-research-lower-output-and-higher-taxes-impact-reducing-immigration-12519#.V0RuAHqHr7J>

The paper compares “Leave” and “Remain” scenarios for migration to the UK 
after the referendum, and assesses their macroeconomic impacts. “Leave” assumes 
that net migration from the EU countries will decline by two thirds compared to 
“Remain”. By 2065, in the Leave scenario, aggregate GDP and GDP per person are 
9% and 1% lower respectively compared to the “Remain” scenario. Reduced 
migration after leaving the EU has a significant negative impact on the public 
finances, primarily because of a higher dependency ratio, which is the fraction 
of young and old people of the total population. Accordingly government 
spending rises as a share of GDP by 1.1 percentage points in 2065, requiring an 
increase in taxation of about £400 per person (2014 pounds). As a result, 
post-tax wages are 2% lower in the Leave scenario.

And here is a quote from Katerina Lisenkova, one of the report’s two authors. 
She said:

 Our research shows that lower migration has an overall negative effect on the 
UK economy. In general EU immigrants benefit the UK economy for two main 
reasons – they are on average much younger and are more highly qualified than 
the general population.
 
MPs are still debating the Queen’s speech and Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative 
former chancellor, has just finished his contribution. In a wide-ranging 
speech, which included a passage about how corporate pay levels being far too 
high, Clarke said he was particularly pleased the speech included measures to 
tackle money laundering, because London is “the money laundering capital of the 
world.

In the fight against crime in this country we are very bad at dealing with 
white collar crime. There is growing awareness today that if you wish to rob a 
bank, you go to the Libor market. You don’t put a balaclava on and pick up a 
shotgun, that’s much less profitable. At last we are starting to do something 
about it. I welcome this bill [the criminal finances bill] and I hope I can be 
reassured it will tackle not just tax evasion, which is quite rightly high on 
the public agenda, but money laundering. London is still the money laundering 
capital of the world. If you’re an African despot or a serious international 
corrupt criminal, London is the best place to put your money because you can 
trust the bankers to look after it and not steal it from you. I welcome the 
fact that we are going to improve the reporting of suspicious activities.

Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has been campaigning in Dudley today. According 
to the Press Association, here are some of the things he has been saying.

 * Farage accused David Cameron and George Osborne of feeding people “a 
constant diet of lies” in the EU campaign.He also said they were “using the 
whole apparatus of state in a way that, frankly, is pretty close to cheating”. 
 * He claimed the Remain campaign scare tactics would backfire. 
In the end I just feel that all these threats may well backfire. This time 
last year Remain were a long way ahead. This time this year, they’re a little 
bit ahead.

 * He dismissed the Treasury’s claim that leaving the EU would trigger a 
recession. 
Is there any evidence to say there won’t be a recession if we stay in? The 
British economy is not doing that well. Our 2% growth is funded by a population 
increase of half a million people a year and by massive government borrowing.

They talk about about the pound going down. The pound has been going down 
since July 2014. Britain is not in that great a state.

 * He said the campaign was ultimately about sovereignty, not economics. 
But this isn’t about economics. I can tell you we will be better off out, 
he’ll tell you we’ll be better off in. Ultimately this referendum is not about 
trade, it’s not about money - it’s about political union. Do we wish to remain 
part of a political union that makes the majority of our laws?

He also appeared to criticise Vote Leave for focusing so prominently on the 
claim that leaving the EU could free up up to £350m a week for the NHS.

It’s all well and good to say we could have more money for the NHS but 
actually this referendum is about more than that. Our politicians have given 
away control of our country. Our message has got to be clear - we believe in 
this country, we believe in its people and we want out country back.

 * He claimed Cameron was being hypocritical when he claimed this morning 
leaving the EU could push up the cost of a holiday abroad.Farage said: 
How dare Cameron talk about the cost of holidays when it’s him with air 
passenger duty that’s put hundreds of pounds on a family going to Florida or 
Disneyland or anywhere else? He’s the man that’s made holidays expensive. We do 
not need a European commission to have competitive air fares - it’s so typical 
of Cameron to make the accusation for the very thing that he himself is guilty 
of.

The first question he answered came from someone who asked when the plague of 
locusts would arrive if Britain voted for Brexit. He replied:

I can confidently reveal the date of the plague of locusts is 24th of June if 
we vote to leave - in which case, the plan is to grant locusts free movement, 
anywhere in the EU.

Leaving the EU would be an “extraordinarily irresponsible thing to do at a 
very dangerous moment”, and be “absolutely applauded in Moscow”,Michael Fallon, 
the defence secretary, told MPs on Tuesday.


He seized the opportunity presented by an appearance before the Commons 
defence committee - chaired by the Brexit supporter Julian Lewis - to mount 
impassioned support for the UK remaining a member of the EU.


“A huge amount is hanging on the vote on 23 June not just for the people of 
this country but for the collective security ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and the West”, he told the 
crosssparty group of MPs.


President Putin would not have had to pay a price for annexing Crimea and 
destabilising eastern Ukraine without the EU, and sanctions would have been 
much weaker had not Britain been a member of the EU, Fallon said.


Britain was “in the lead” in getting the EU to impose tough trade and 
commercial sacntions on Russia, he insisted. “The fact we were there and able 
to lead the debate, the EU was able to ensure the toughest sanctions were 
imposed.”


Tough sanctions “would not have happened without the EU and would not have 
happened if the UK was not within it”, Fallon told the MPs.

 * Tony Blair has expressed scepticism about Jeremy Corbyn’s ability to win a 
general election. In remarks at a Prospect event, the former Labour prime 
minister said that the far left and the far right were similar in that they 
were both “isolationists against free trade”, and that centre ground 
politicians like himself were struggling to find anything to say to people who 
wanted change. (See1.22pm.)

 * Blair has admitted he profoundly underestimated the forces that were going 
to be unleashed in Iraq after the war, and says his understanding of the Middle 
East is much deeper now than at the time of the invasion in 2003. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/tony-blair-i-underestimated-forces-of-destabilisation-in-iraq-chilcot-report>
 * David Cameron has said the cost of a family holiday could rise by £230 and 
new limits on duty free could put an end to “booze cruises” to the continent if 
Britain votes to leave the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/family-holidays-could-cost-more-after-brexit-pm-claims-falling-pound>
 * Cameron has insisted the Conservatives will “come together” after the EU 
referendum in response to claims he could be deposed. Responding to reports 
that some Tory MPs will press for a confidence vote in his leadership even if 
he wins the EU referendum, he said:

Obviously this is such a big issue that you do see arguments between political 
parties... and there are going to be passionate arguments, there’s going to be 
strong arguments and passion on both sides.

Do I believe at the end of this we can all come together and accept the 
result? Absolutely I do.

The one thing all Conservatives agree on is that it is right to have this 
referendum, right to have this debate and right to abide by the decision of the 
British people.

 * Birmingham council has announced that it wants its children’s services to 
be run by a voluntary trust. 
<http://birminghamnewsroom.com/birmingham-childrens-services-statement/>As the 
Press Association reports, the department at Birmingham City Council has 
previously been labelled a “national disgrace” by Ofsted chief inspector Sir 
Michael Wilshaw. Previous high-profile cases of child deaths in the Midlands 
city, including those of two-year-old Keanu Williams in 2011 and seven-year-old 
Khyra Ishaq in 2008, had led to the department and other agencies coming under 
fire. Now the authority has announced a voluntary trust will run the department 
under a “new model” which will put “social workers at its centre”. 
 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has said an extra £10m is to be pumped 
into English and Welsh prisons to tackle a rising tide of violence and suicides.

programme just a month into the new financial year, with the government 
borrowing more than expected in April. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/24/george-osborne-financial-year-government-borrowing-deficit-reduction-ons>
 * A Labour MP has claimed Russia may be bombing civilians in Syria partly in 
an attempt to secure a British exit from the European Union. Speaking at 
foreign office questions, Labour’s Geraint Davies said: 
Do you accept on the Ukraine that Russian bombing of Syrian civilians to 
provoke refugees and to possibly tilt the balance in favour of Brexit is part 
of a strategy to basically fragment European resolve in terms of Ukraine?

Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, said he did not accept this. He replied:

There is definitely a Russian strategy to try to fragment European resolve. I 
think it’s probably a step too far to suggest that Russia’s engagement in Syria 
is only designed to apply pressure over Ukraine. Russia has important and 
historic equities in Syria and is seeking to defend its interest there.

 * Sadiq Khan, the new mayor of London, has made a string of appointments, 
including making Valerie Shawcross his deputy mayor for transport.

Jeremy Corbyn is now also saying that more women’s voices need to be heard in 
the EU referendum debate. In a speech to a rally in Hastings tonight he will 
say:

So far, the referendum debate taking place across the country, has been 
dominated by men, and mostly Tory men. This needs to change, we need to hear 
more diverse voices in this important debate, we need to hear more strong 
women’s voices.

Women across the country are being let down by a Conservative government that 
is failing on housing, failing our NHS, failing to create good quality jobs and 
failing even against its own economic targets.

We’re going to hear a strong woman’s voice tomorrow. David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> will be missing PMQs, 
because he is going to Japan for the G7 summit, and so PMQs will be George 
Osborne v Angela Eagle.
 
Tony Blair backed the tone of the Remain campaign saying they were mounting a 
strong campaign focussing on the right issues including the risks to the 
British economy household incomes and the country’s role in the world.

He also hinted he would be making a joint intervention with other former prime 
ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major to urge the country to stay in the EU 
“there is a role for former prime ministers,” he said.
 
Millions of EU workers face uncertainty over whether they can stay in the UK, 
while British expats in Europe could also lose the right to remain, own 
property or get free healthcare in the event of Brexit,David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has claimed.

The prime minister said there was no guarantee that UK citizens abroad or EU 
citizens in the UK would maintain their rights to reside unless there is a vote 
to remain.

Brexit campaigners claim the rights of expats are preserved under the Vienna 
convention but a number of academic and legal opinions have argued that EU 
citizenship would end with Brexit.

Cameron said such rights and others to own property and get healthcare in the 
EU were “certain if we stay and uncertain if we leave”, while also arguing that 
people could have to pay £60 for a Schengen visa just to travel through other 
European countries.

It is the latest in a long string of warnings from Cameron about problems that 
could be caused by leaving the EU, which have led to fury among Tory 
politicians pushing for the UK to leave.
 
At the Prospect event this morning Tony Blair insisted that his brand of 
centre ground politics was not dead, but admitted that the centre ground was 
losing its traction and not providing answers to those that wanted an end to 
the status quo.

He claimed the source of some of the insurgent support for Donald Trump and 
Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> was similar, 
saying “these people are riding the anger they are not providing the answers”.

He also challenged Corbyn, centr saying:

Let us say, it is not yet a proven concept that Corbynism can win an election. 
It is clear that they can take over a political party, what is not so clear to 
me yet is that they can take over a country.

Where fringes of left and right meet each other is essentially as 
isolationists against free trade. It is true that the left want to hang the 
bankers and the right want to clear out the immigrants, but in the much of the 
psychology and attitude they have got a lot in common.

He said the centre is not back into contention, arguing at present centre 
ground politicians “look today as if we are managers of the status quo and not 
changers of it”.

He also questioned the basis of Corbyn’s support in the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party.

If you break down the analysis of the people who are joining the Labour party 
it is not clear to me those that should feel most angry about their personal 
situation and those joining are the same people. The world of the Twitterati is 
gives you a sense of belonging and a sense of insurgency. It was about shaking 
the system and rattling the cage. People do feel frustrated and social media 
gives them the ability to feel that at scale and at speed, and the centre looks 
as if we are saying it is all very complicated. We are not in the right 
conversation with people like this.

He said the centre ground should be discussing issues such as the role of 
technology and big data in public services, the use of monetary policy such as 
quantitative easing and the future of student debt.

He also dismissed the binary debate over austerity saying it misunderstands 
the way economy works.
