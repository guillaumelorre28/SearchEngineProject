wormhole, while Patrick Dempsey played a New Yorker who falls for Adams despite 
being engaged to Idina Menzel. Susan Sarandon was an evil queen.

A sequel to the film, which took more than $340m worldwide, has been in 
development since 2010. This iteration of the script is said to focus of Adam’s 
character questioning her happily-ever-after life and accidentally triggering 
events that upend everyone’s lives.
