The Fall's debut appearance on 23 May 1977 at the North West Arts basement on 
Manchester's King Street was a glimpse into the future. Mark E Smith had 
already settled into the contrary, bile-spewing persona that persists to this 
day. The set included soon-to-be trademark examples of their influential 
Salford rumble with Repetition and Psycho Mafia. Drummer Steve Ormrod was 
ousted after the one appearance, setting in motion a revolving door of 
musicians that has never stopped. Fashions have changed, but Smith remains 
constant: indie's sneering, contemptuous conscience, a reminder that what 
matters is not the trousers or the haircuts, but the work.
