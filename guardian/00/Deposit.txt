A Deposit is the amount of money - usually around 10% - you pay as a surety 
for entering into an agreement to supply goods and services. It acts as a 
guarantee that you will carry out the terms of the contract. Contrary to 
popular belief, if you cancel an order you will lose the deposit even if you 
have a good reason for changing your mind.

If you pay more than 10% of the price up front it may be possible to argue 
this is a part-payment rather than a deposit. In these circumstances some of 
the money may be refundable, but only if the part-payment more than covers the 
seller's loss of profit as a result of the cancellation. Special rules apply if 
you buy online, however, or sign a contract at home or off trade premises. In 
these cases, you may have a right to cancel and have the deposit refunded 
within a statutory cooling off period.
