Argo <https://www.theguardian.com/film/argo>, Ben Affleck's fact-based 
thriller about the Iranian hostage crisis, rode to victory at the 85th Academy 
Awards, taking the crowning best picture Oscar to complete a night of triumph. 
The film was the bookies' favourite going into the event, having already been 
named best film at the Baftas and best drama at the Golden Globes.

Played out against the backdrop of the 1979 hostage crisis, Argo spins the 
account of a joint Hollywood-CIA mission to spring six imperiled Americans from 
revolutionary Iran, using a fake movie production as a decoy. The film stars 
director Affleck as a CIA agent, while the supporting cast includes John 
Goodman, Bryan Cranston

 and Alan Arkin. It is Affleck's third stint in the director's chair – after
Gone Baby Gone <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/120869/gone.baby.gone> 
and the Boston crime drama The Town – and by far his most successful.

Argo was first touted as a possible Oscar contender when it premiered at last 
autumn's Toronto film festival, although it initially struggled to outpace its 
closest rival, Steven Spielberg's historical sagaLincoln

victory, however, sets it firmly on a pedestal all of its own.
