Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> announced a new "Home" 
app and service that allows an iPhone or iPad to control smart appliances, 
lights and locks around the home.

The Home app will securely connect to third-party products such as the Philips 
Hue lightbulbs, Honeywell's thermostats and Withing's smart alarm clocks.

"We’ve come up with HomeKit to allow secure pairing so that only your iPhone 
can unlock your garage door,” said Craig Federighi, Apple's software chief on 
stage at WWDC.


‘Get ready for bed, Siri’

Each connected device in the home can be paired securely, but also grouped and 
linked to specific scenes that can be activated for certain events like getting 
home from work or leaving the house.

"With Siri integration you can say something like ‘get ready for bed’ and be 
sure that the garage door is closed, the lights are dimmed and the doors are 
locked," said Federighi.

Apple announced partners for its HomeKit – the developer platform underlying 
the Home app – including Texas Instruments, Philips, Haier, Netamo, Withings, 
Honeywell, Marvel, Osram and Broadcom.

Apple hopes that Home will unify internet of things devices around the home 
into one common protocol, instead of the many separate proprietary protocols 
that each manufacturer users for its line of devices.
