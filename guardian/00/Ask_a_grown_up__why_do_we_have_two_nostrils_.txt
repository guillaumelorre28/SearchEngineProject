Well, partly it's a developmental thing: we have a pair of every feature that 
is not mid-line in the body – so, two eyes, two ears, two nostrils (yes, we 
have only one mouth, but that, too, follows the same structure). This happens 
because early on, when the human body develops, it forms almost 
from a flat plate that folds itself in two.

Another reason we have two nostrils is because of something called the "nasal 
cycle". While we don't consciously notice it, we breathe predominantly through 
one nostril at a time, and the other side becomes a bit congested and rests. 
You can test this yourself: try breathing through one nostril and then the 
other, and you'll probably find that one becomes stuffier than the other. This 
automatically changes over about four to six hours, so then the other side 
relaxes.

Finally, imagine how odd we'd look with just the one nostril.
