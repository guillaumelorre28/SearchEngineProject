Nick Clegg <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg> has been mocked on 
twitter by the Pub Landlord Al Murray after the deputy prime minister took the 
brave - some might say risky - step of quoting the comedian in his conference 
speech.

“ATTENTION WORLD’S MEDIA: This Clegg business is nothing to do with me,” 
Murray tweeted after Clegg quoted favourably from a speech he gave at a pro-UK 
rally ahead of the Scottish referendum.

In a series of tweets, Murray set out his own political manifesto:

DEAR NICK CLEGG: The Pub Landlord also doesn't want to pay his speeding fines.

DEAR NICK CLEGG: the Pub Landlord wants to bring back hanging "if only for the 
sake of the rope industry"

DEAR NICK CLEGG: The Pub Landlord vows in his next government to raise the 
temperature 5 degrees by 2019 to "save Blackpool's tourist trade"

Murray turned his humour on Clegg after the deputy prime minister spoke of how 
the Pub Landlord had successfully captured the “wonderfully vague” spirit of 
British identity. Clegg said: “He said, that’s why we call ourselves Brit – 
ish.”

Murray retweeted a fan who wrote: “Clegg is Rubb-ish.” before adding:
