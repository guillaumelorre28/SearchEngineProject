The Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northernireland> 
manager, Michael O'Neill, had demanded a response to last month's embarrassing 
defeat but was instead handed another humiliating setback as second-half goals 
from Rufat Dadashov and Mahir Shukurov secured the hosts a 2-0 win at the 
Bakcell Arena and to compound the visitors' night, the Manchester United 
defender Jonny Evans was sent off in injury time.

The visitors had enjoyed the better of a goalless first half but Azerbaijan 
were more urgent after the break and Northern Ireland first saw their 
midfielder Oliver Norwood also earning a booking for Tuesday's final group game 
in Israel after lunging at Rauf Aliyev before Dadashov opened the scoring on 58 
minutes.

Evans then went through the back of Aliyev with a poor challenge deep into 
injury time and was dismissed, with Shukurov completing the visitors' misery by 
scoring from the free-kick.
