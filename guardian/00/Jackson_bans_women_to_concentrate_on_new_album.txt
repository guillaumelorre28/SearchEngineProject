Michael Jackson <https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson> is back in 
the studio, and this time he's serious. How serious? He's not only banned women 
from the studio, he's also banned his kids.

After years of on-and-off recording, Jackson's now returned in earnest to the 
project. He has holed up at the Palms studio in Las Vegas, according to the NY 
Post, where he is working with producers RedOne andAkon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon>.

"Michael is [making] the album himself and then will sell it to a record 
company when he's finished," the Post's spy explained. "He realises this is 
very important and doesn't want any distractions."

The "king of pop" has continued to be dogged by financial woes - not to 
mention sordid punchlines - spawned by a decade and a half of legal battles. 
Earlier this year, his Neverland Ranch was reportedly in danger of being sold 
off from under his nose.

For the duration of these new recording sessions, Jackson will spurn any 
personal relationships with women, the Post reports. He had reputedly been 
seeing his kids' nanny, Grace Rwaramba, but she too has been banished from the 
studio.

We admire the gumption of whoever told Michael Jackson that the only things 
standing between himself and another great pop record were children, women and 
nannies. Alas we suspect there are another few reasons why Jackson's best days 
are behind him. And only one of them is Uri Geller.
