Brownlee was revealed to have used acetazolamide, which is on the Wada banned 
list that covers diuretics and masking agents but is also used for treating 
altitude sickness, on 10 October 2013 and again on 11 October 2013. His TUE was 
issued four days after the last time he used the drug, on 17 October 2013 and 
authorised by UK Anti-doping’s Anne Sargent.

Brownlee said last week that he was unconcerned about his data being leaked 
and admitted that he had the TUE. “I’ve got one thing for when I climbed 
Kilimanjaro so we’re not particularly worried about it, if it comes out it 
comes out,” he said but pointed out he was concerned that the hackers could 
breach security systems. “It’s exceptionally worrying that they can get into 
that situation and access private medical records.”

He added on Twitter on Monday: “Slightly embarrassing that someone as fit as 
me suffered from altitude sickness but thankfully Jonny Brownlee was there to 
carry me.”

British Triathlon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/triathlon> issued a 
statement in response to the leak: “Alistair Brownlee was granted his only TUE 
for treatment of altitude sickness in whilst climbing Kilimanjaro in October 
2013. This was an out of competition trek after the triathlon season had 
finished.

“Let’s be very clear; athletes who have a TUE on their record have followed 
the rules based on a specific medical requirement. We can say with absolute 
confidence that our athletes have nothing to hide. This attack on the integrity 
of athletes is shocking. We strongly condemn actions of this nature and 
continue to be in close contact with UKAD and Wada in regards to this matter.”

Also on the latest list released by Fancy Bears is the New Zealand rower Mahe 
Drysdale, who received four TUEs between April 2015 and August 2016 for 
fluocortolone which is a substance used in the treatment of hemorrhoids.

The Australian Emily Seebohm, who won Olympic swimming gold medals in 2008 and 
2012, was also named as having used prednisolone in May 2009.

There is no suggestion that those named have done anything wrong, as all the 
TUEs publicised by Fancy Bears have been granted approval by anti-doping 
authorities.
