Generally speaking, us darker skinned women have been cajoled into trying a 
myriad of bright shades over the years – more so than other people, I'd say. My 
trips to beauty counters in pursuit of a delicate nude often resulted in the 
opposite – being strongly advised that women with darker skins look "ahmayzing" 
in purple eyeshadow (there areother shades that suit us y'know). But the thing 
is, for most of us, brights are already part of our makeup repertoire and 
something that we're comfortable with. Which is why this season's trend for 
neon is so exciting; it takes colour to the next frontier.

The innate power of neon to attract attention is evident. Traffic cones, glow 
sticks andNicki Minaj

: they are all entirely visible from miles away, commanding attention with 
their Day-Glo majesty. This isn't, and will never be, a dictatorial column, but 
I'd be remiss if I told you there's a limit to how much neon you should bestow 
upon your person in one go. One colour at a time has the desired effect, and 
anything more is fluoro-overload.

I trialled neon shades for a week, and found that a perfect base, without any 
blush, groomed brows and just a hint of mascara are key to keeping it 
just-off-the-catwalk-cool. Worn against a wardrobe of neutrals it's the 
ultimate hit of colour that delivers everything it promises, whether in the 
form ofan acid-green nail

, or, a luminous orange lip. There's so much tolove about neon, especially on 
darker skins, no matter how juvenile or unwearable it might seem from the 
outset. It's pure anarchy for the face, I'm pressed to see what's not to love, 
and hope you'll feel the same.
 Anita's ultimate neon makeup 
My ultimate neon nails

Ice Neon polish in Toxic Apple, £5, Models Own <http://www.modelsownit.com/>

Short green nails worn against a palette of black clothes are achingly cool.

Nail polish in Va Va Va Voom, £10.25, Orly (graftonsbeauty.co.uk 
<http://www.graftonsbeauty.co.uk/home/index.html>)

Pink on toes (it will be sandal weather, soon, somewhere) looks incredible 
with open-toed wedges for a splash of colour.

My ultimate neon lips

Lipstick in Immodest, £16, Illamasqua <http://www.illamasqua.com/>

This is serious neon lipstick in a pigment-rich matt formula. It definitely 
has the potential to "wear you" unless you treat it right – namely by having a 
flawless base and a fierce attitude.

Rouge Pur Couture 21, Indian Sari, £25, YSL <http://www.yslbeauty.co.uk/>

Glorious bright orange – this is the shade of the season and pretty much suits 
every skintone.

My ultimate neon eyes

i-Divine Acid, £7.99, Sleek Makeup <http://www.sleekmakeup.com/>

This is every neon shade, you'd ever need for a very fair price. The yellow 
and bright blue are particularly epic.

Cream Colour Base in Pink Shock, £14.50, Mac <http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/>

Use this densely pigmented cream as a shadow, lip or blush – its possibilities 
are endless.
