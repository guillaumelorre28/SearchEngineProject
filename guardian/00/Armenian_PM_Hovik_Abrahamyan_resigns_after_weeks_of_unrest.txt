The prime minister of Armenia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenia> has 
announced his resignation following weeks of civil unrest and a sharp economic 
downturn.

Hovik Abrahamyan told a cabinet meeting on Thursday that the country needs 
“new approaches and a new beginning,” and his departure should lead the way 
towards a coalition government.

Last month, Armenia’s president, Serzh Sargsyan, promised to create a 
government of national accord after atwo-week standoff at a police compound

 in the capital, Yerevan, which left two police officers dead and shook the 
nation.

Several dozen armed men stormed the building

 and demanded the release of Zhirair Sefilyan, the leader of the New Armenia 
Public Salvation Front opposition group, who was arrested in June on suspicion 
of preparing to seize government buildings and telecoms facilities in Yerevan.

The standoff galvanised Armenia’s protest movement

, triggering rallies in support of the gunmen and further clashes with police.

In recent months, there has been a flare-up of violence in Azerbaijan’s 
breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Karabakh is technically part of Azerbaijan, 
but it has been run by an ethnic Armenian government since the collapse of the 
Soviet Union. In April, theworst clashes since a 1994 ceasefire

 broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

In comments reported by Russian news agencies, Abrahamyan said he was stepping 
down in order to “give a chance to a new government,” which would offer “new 
approaches in order to consolidate society”.

However, it was not clear from his statement who would lead the government.

Political analysts in Armenia have named the former mayor of Yerevan Karen 
Karapetyan, a top executive at Russian gas company Gazprom, as the likeliest 
successor to Abrahamyan.
