Seventeen years and hundreds of thousands of pounds later, Kevin Shields is 
again working on aMy Bloody Valentine

Shields confirmed the rumours at the My Bloody Valentine-curated All 
Tomorrow's Parties <https://www.theguardian.com/music/all-tomorrows-parties> 
festival this weekend, taking his earplugs out for long enough to talk to the 
New York Times. He will be returning to songs started over a decade ago, during 
abortive sessions for Island Records. "I realised that all that stuff I was 
doing in 1996 and 1997 was a lot better than I thought," he said.

The reunited My Bloody Valentine played several UK dates this summer and are 
now completing a North American tour. Shields hopes to begin recording new 
material with the band this autumn.

It has been 17 years since the release of Loveless, My Bloody Valentine's 
legendary album, which cost £250,000 to record, bringing Creation Records close 
to bankruptcy. "It was," Shields said this weekend, "a very, very damaged time 
for everybody."

My Bloody Valentine then signed to Island Records and Shields spent years in 
isolation, working in the studio until in 1997 Island finally cut him off, 
upset at the lack of progress. "That was it," Shields explained. "It was like 
the plug was pulled, 'No money for you anymore.'"

Revenue from the recent gigs have allowed the band to buy some £200,000 in 
equipment, and though the revitalised group has not yet been performing new 
songs, Shields seems enthusiastic for the future. He's not worried, either, 
that his outlook has improved from the "loveless" days of the early 90s.

"I definitely don't think you need to suffer to be creative," he insisted. 
"I've written some of my best songs when I've been happy."
