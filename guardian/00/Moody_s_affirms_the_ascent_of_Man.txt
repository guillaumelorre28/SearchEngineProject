While Ireland teeters on the brink of financial distress, there's better news 
across the water on theIsle of Man <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/isle-of-man>
. The ratings agency Moody's last week affirmed an AAA rating on the modest 
isle of 80,000 people, ending a year-long review for possible negative 
downgrade. The reason? The tone of international debate on offshore economies 
"seems recently to have eased", according to Moody's experts, ending a threat 
to the Isle of Man's "business model".

In other words, an anticipated global crackdown on tax havens has failed to 
materialise. How pleased the people of Douglas must be. And the late Sir Norman 
Wisdom would have been proud.
