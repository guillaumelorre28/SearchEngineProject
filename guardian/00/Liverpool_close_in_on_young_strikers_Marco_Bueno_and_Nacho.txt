The Mexico Under-17 striker Marco Bueno is set to arrive at Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> next month with a view to 
signing what may be a five-year contract.

His current club Pachuca held a meeting with the player and his parents on 
Monday to agree arrangements, with the youngster reportedly due on Merseyside 
some time between 10 and 12 August to begin training with the reserves.

"A pre-contract with the parents and Bueno was signed to be sent to 
Liverpool," the Pachuca vice-president, Andrés Fassi, told El Universal. "So we 
are accepting the 10-day trial and the conditions, if the English decide to 
keep him."

Bueno, talking about the prospective move to Merseyside, said: "I have to face 
it with great motivation and commitment to represent the country in the best 
way, and with faith that everything is achievable. It's a life experience that 
I will never forget, I'm very excited about that and will give my best. Where 
the opportunity arises I will make the most."

Reports in the Spanish media also claim Liverpool have secured a deal for the 
Albacete <https://www.theguardian.com/football/albacete> youngster Nacho, who 
had a successful trial with the club's under-18s earlier this month. The 
Spanish press say the Reds have paid £150,000 up front for the striker with a 
further £350,000 of potential add-ons, plus a 15% sell-on fee.

Villarreal, Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid and Málaga were all reportedly 
interested in the player.
