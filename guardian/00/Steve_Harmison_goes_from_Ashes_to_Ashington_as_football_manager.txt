The former England cricketer Steve Harmison has been named as the surprise 
manager of the Northern League Division One side Ashington.

The two-time Ashes winner, who played 63 Tests and 58 one-day internationals 
for his country, will take charge of his hometown club, which sits in the ninth 
tier of English football, alongside the head coach, Lee Skinner, and Lee 
Anderson.

The chairman, Ian Lavery, said on the club’s official website: “All three have 
a wealth of experience in the sporting world and together can build on the 
success that Ashington Football Club have had since moving to Woodhorn Lane.”

Harmison played in central defence for the club until his late teens before 
giving up football to concentrate on cricket, from which he announced his 
retirement in 2013

The 36-year-old takes charge with the club 17th out of 22 teams after a 4-0 
defeat against Marske United at the weekend.

His first match will see him travel to Bishop Auckland on Tuesday.

Harmison is not the only member of the 2005 Ashes winning team to branch out 
into a new sport after retiring from cricket.

Andrew Flintoff tried his hand at boxing after initially hanging up his whites 
in 2010,winning a four-round decision over the little-known heavyweight Richard 
Dawson in his only professional bout in November 2012

Flintoff has since made a return to Twenty20 cricket with Lancashire and 
Brisbane Heat.
