Engineering group Amec has added nearly 4% after releasing a positive update 
in connection with its purchase of US group Foster Wheeler.

The company said trading had been in line with expectations since its half 
year report in August, and the outlook remained unchanged. It repeated 
forecasts of a £250m hit to revenues and £25m to trading profits due to 
currency effects. It said:
 Amec continues to see less greenfield activity in some of the group's key 
upstream oil and gas markets, which is partially offsetting the strong growth 
from Clean Energy and Middle Eastern Oil and Gas. Amec expects to see modest 
underlying revenue growth in 2014 for its existing operations, led by ongoing 
strength in the Clean Energy market and Middle Eastern Oil and Gas. As 
discussed previously, the mix of business will result in a slight reduction in 
group margins compared to last year. As in 2013, profits and cash flow 
generation will be second-half weighted. 
Its shares have climbed 38p to £10.83 after the update, but Liberum analysts 
issued a sell note, saying:
 As part of the Foster Wheeler acquisition process, Amec has filed its SEC 
registration document and released a statement on current trading, trends and 
prospects.

[There is] no change to [our] forecasts. We remain concerned about the 
environment for all Oil Service shares and do not believe the Amec price is 
back at a level where it is attractive.
