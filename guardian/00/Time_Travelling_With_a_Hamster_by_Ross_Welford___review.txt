Al (short for Albert Einstein Hawking Chaudhury) lives with his mother, his 
step-dad Steve, his half-sister Carly and his amazing Grandpa Byron. His 
grandpa has an incredible talent for being able to remember anything and 
everything!

 Al’s father, a scientist and inventor specialising in the theory of time 
travel, died when Al was just 8. Using his Dad’s makeshift time machine – a 
laptop attached to a tin tub from a garden centre – Al ( accompanied by his pet 
hamster, Alan Shearer) tries to stop the seemingly inevitable from happening, 
therefore preventing the death of his father.

 This was an extremely enjoyable adventure. It was engaging and intriguing as 
well as being funny and emotional at times. The ending was moving as well as 
satisfying and it made me feel exceedingly happy for Al and his family. I 
adored the character of grandpa Byron who is an exceptionally likeable person, 
and a very well developed character who made the story more lighthearted in 
places.

Overall this is a brilliant story which is very hard to find fault in; it kept 
me pondering over the mind boggling concept of time travel, which is made about 
as believable as it ever could be by Ross Welford, for long after I finished 
the story. A very good read for boys and girls to enjoy. A debut novel and I 
hope the author has book number two on its way.
