Jack Nicklaus joined Arnold Palmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/arnold-palmer> as an honorary starter at the 
Masters today â€“ and hit his ceremonial opening drive out of sight. Sadly, 
though, only out of his own sight.

The 70-year-old record six-times winner at Augusta had not put his contact 
lens in for the shot and admitted afterwards: "I don't have a clue where it 
went."

In the event it was leaked right, just like Palmer's before him, but both had 
achieved their main aim. They could not hear the balls land.

One of the traditions of the week drew a huge crowd to the first tee and the 
two legends were applauded all the way from the clubhouse to the first tee.

Nicklaus later said: "I've never been up this early at Augusta. I never had 
the tee at 7.40, but I've run the gamut now."

Neither he nor Palmer wanted to discuss the club chairman Billy Payne's 
eve-of-tournament public rebuke of Tiger Woods for letting people down with his 
sex scandal. Nicklaus said he had not read the comments, while 80-year-old 
Palmer stated: "I have no real comment except that I agree."
