Hammond's evidence to the Commons Treasury committee - Summary

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was once seen as a fairly hardline Eurosceptic 
but the Westminster kaleidoscope has been shaken so vigorously over the last 
six months that he has now emerged as the pro-Europeans’ best hope in cabinet. 
He did not say anything sensational or indiscreet in his evidence to the select 
committee, but for someone committed to giving “no running commentary” on 
Brexit, he was surprisingly candid. Here are the key points.

 * Hammond said the government should keep its Brexit options as open as 
possible and he appeared to criticise his Brexiteer colleague who are adopting 
a more hardline stance. He argued that keeping options open was a good 
negotiating strategy. 
I am trying not to rule anything out. Every possible combination should be 
considered, because I genuinely believe that every time we rule something out 
we hand a negotiating chip to the opposite side of the table. Keeping as many 
things on the table as possible is the best negotiating stance.

And, in remarks that seemed aimed at colleagues like Liam Fox, the 
international trade secretary, he suggested that taking a firm stance against 
the single market or the customs union would be mistake.

[Theresa May] needs the maximum possible space. My objective in supporting her 
is to ensure that she has the broadest range of options - properly costed and 
understood - and the maximum scope to deploy that broad range of options in 
what might be a wide-ranging negotiation.

I would say that those that are undermining the effort are those that are 
seeking to close down that negotiating stance, seeking to arrive at hard 
decisions that we don’t need at this stage. Keeping as many areas open, as many 
options open, as possible is the key to the strongest possible negotiating hand.

When it was put to him that the very existence of the international trade 
department suggested the UK would leave the customs union (because if the UK 
remains in the customs union, it will not be able to negotiate separate trade 
deals), Hammond said that “many EU countries have trade ministries even though 
they are inside the customs union” and that ministers in Fox’s department were 
“promoting British trade”.

 * He said he there were “deeply pragmatic” at the top of the EU who would 
enable the UK and the EU to find a “mutually beneficial” solution to Brexit. 
There has been quite a lot of position taking, as one would expect, at this 
stage of the negotiation. But I remain optimistic that there are, at very 
senior level across the European Union, some deeply pragmatic people who have 
shown by their actions time and again that they can find solutions when 
challenged with problems. And if we look at the history of the EU, how many 
times have people said there is no way through this problem or that problem? 
And yet the EU has been able to find a way through it. And I hope that 
pragmatism and engagement will deliver us a mutually beneficial solution.

 * He was criticised by MPs after saying he would not publish internal 
Treasury reports analysing the costs and benefits of Brexit.To do so would 
undermine the UK’s negotiating position, he claimed. But Labour’sRachel Reeves 
said this stance was “disappointing”. AndAndrew Tyrie, the committee chair, 
said most members of the committee would probably agree with Reeves on this. 
 * He ruled out Scotland being able to negotiate its own trade deal with the 
EU.It was for the UK as a whole to strike a trade deal, he said. 
 * He said other EU countries would not want a Brexit deal that damaged the 
City because that would be bad for Europe as a whole.Perceptions on the 
continent that other European financial centres were likely to gain if London 
lost access to EU markets were likely to “melt away” as people realised that UK 
jobs were more likely to go to the US, or disappear, than to go to other 
European countries, he said. London was Europe’s financial services centre as 
well as the UK’s, he said. 
Anything which broke up this deep and broad pool of capital and expertise in 
London would be hugely detrimental to the real economy across the EU as well as 
the UK.

 * He said City firms were starting to be “realistic” about the likelihood of 
them not being able to retain the “passporting” regime that allowed them to 
operate in other EU countries. He said it in such a way as to imply he thought 
they were right to be “realistic” and to start considering alternatives. 
 * He said the UK would not impose immigration controls that stopped banks 
hiring highly-skilled workers from abroad after Brexit. 
 * He said the predictions that Treasury made about the negative impact of 
Brexit before the referendum were partly based on assumptions that were no 
longer valid. The BBC’s Kamal Ahmed has written more about this. Kamal Ahmed

 * He said Britain might have to beef up border controls considerably after 
Brexit. Asked if it was true that an additional 5,000 customs officers would be 
needed were correct, Hammond replied: 
It would be our choice, of course, but assuming that we wanted to operate an 
efficient at-the-border customs system under World Trade Organisation rules, we 
may need significantly more infrastructure at the border than we have now.

 * He said the government would not change the way the Bank of England decided 
monetary policy, despite Theresa May appearing to criticise its policy of 
quantitative easing in her Tory conference speech. He said 
My understanding is that what the prime inister was trying to say is that we 
recognise that monetary policy, which is an important tool of macroeconomic 
policy, has a distributional impact. And, to the extent the government believes 
that distributional impact needs to be addressed or corrected, we also have 
tools available to us to do that ..

There will be no change in monetary policy. Monetary policy is independently 
determined, that will continue to be the case. The monetary policy committee 
will continue to make decisions on interest rates and recommendations on 
unconventional monetary policy.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Leadsom says UK could strike trade deal with EU 'in very short order'

It will be “perfectly possible” to secure a free trade agreement with the 
European Union in a short period of time, environment secretaryAndrea Leadsom 
told a select committee this afternoon. She said:

We have total regulatory equivalence with the EU. We are not Canada, where 
there were a few hundred years of different rules and regulations that needed 
to be sorted out in a free trade agreement. We’re certainly not China, where 
there is different language barriers and so on.

There is the economics and the politics, and I think the economics says it 
would be perfectly possible, perfectly realistic to get a free trade agreement 
in place in very short order.

Don’t forget the rest of the world takes an average of just over two years to 
negotiate a free trade agreement, and if I’m not very much mistaken that’s 
exactly what we’ve got between now and when we leave the EU, and that’s for a 
country that hasn’t aligned its rules and regulations for 43 years.

I’m extremely optimistic. The economics says it’s in all our interests to seek 
an agreement to continue to trade freely with each other. We have a strong hand 
because we import more than we export. The stars are in a strong place, it’s 
for us to work our socks off to deliver that.

Ipsos MORI poll shows Tories 18-point lead over Labour

While I write up Philip Hammond’s evidence to the Treasury committee, here is 
the latest Ipsos MORI poll to ponder. 
<https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3794/Sharp-fall-in-economic-optimism-over-last-month.aspx>
 It shows the Conservatives with an 18-point lead over Labour.

Andrew Tyrie goes next.

Q: In 2015 George Osborne changed the way he carried out distributional 
analyses for his budgets. That meant they could not be compared with previous 
figures. Will you consider reverting to the old system?

Hammond says he is aware of this issue. No distributional analysis is perfect. 
There were weaknesses in the old system.

He says he will publish a distributional analysis for his announcements, and 
that he will consider the points Tyrie is making.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.

There was quite a lot to unpack. I will post a summary soon.

Wes Streeting goes next.

Q: Surely parliament should have some say in what our opening position is in 
the Brexit talks?

Hammond says Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has 
set this out. We are leaving the EU. We want controls on immigration. And we 
want the best possible access to the EU marketplace.

He says he does not want to constrain the prime minister any more than is 
necessary.

He says he remains optimistic that there are some “deeply pragmatic people” in 
the EU who can find solutions to these problems.

I hope that pragmatism and engagement will deliver us a mutually beneficial 
solution.

Q: Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, recently said it was 
better to invest in property than in a pension. Do you agree?

Hammond says it is not for him to give investment advice.

Q; But isn’t this a statement of the obvious?

Hammond says the housing market is different in different parts of the country.

Steve Baker, a Conservative, goes next.

Q: When I was in the RAF there were documents that were secret because, if 
made public, that would be detrimental to the public interest. Should the same 
apply to cabinet documents about Brexit?

Hammond says he takes the old-fashioned view that cabinet conversations should 
stay private.

realise that the demise of London would be damaging to them. Any jobs lost 
might to to New York, not to Europe, he says.

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was once seen as a fairly hardline Eurosceptic 
but the Westminster kaleidoscope has been shaken so vigorously over the last 
six months that he has now emerged as the pro-Europeans’ best hope in cabinet. 
He did not say anything sensational or indiscreet in his evidence to the select 
committee, but for someone committed to giving “no running commentary” on 
Brexit, he was surprisingly candid. Here are the key points.

 * Hammond said the government should keep its Brexit options as open as 
possible and he appeared to criticise his Brexiteer colleague who are adopting 
a more hardline stance. He argued that keeping options open was a good 
negotiating strategy. 
I am trying not to rule anything out. Every possible combination should be 
considered, because I genuinely believe that every time we rule something out 
we hand a negotiating chip to the opposite side of the table. Keeping as many 
things on the table as possible is the best negotiating stance.

And, in remarks that seemed aimed at colleagues like Liam Fox, the 
international trade secretary, he suggested that taking a firm stance against 
the single market or the customs union would be mistake.

[Theresa May] needs the maximum possible space. My objective in supporting her 
is to ensure that she has the broadest range of options - properly costed and 
understood - and the maximum scope to deploy that broad range of options in 
what might be a wide-ranging negotiation.

I would say that those that are undermining the effort are those that are 
seeking to close down that negotiating stance, seeking to arrive at hard 
decisions that we don’t need at this stage. Keeping as many areas open, as many 
options open, as possible is the key to the strongest possible negotiating hand.

When it was put to him that the very existence of the international trade 
department suggested the UK would leave the customs union (because if the UK 
remains in the customs union, it will not be able to negotiate separate trade 
deals), Hammond said that “many EU countries have trade ministries even though 
they are inside the customs union” and that ministers in Fox’s department were 
“promoting British trade”.

 * He said he there were “deeply pragmatic” at the top of the EU who would 
enable the UK and the EU to find a “mutually beneficial” solution to Brexit. 
There has been quite a lot of position taking, as one would expect, at this 
stage of the negotiation. But I remain optimistic that there are, at very 
senior level across the European Union, some deeply pragmatic people who have 
shown by their actions time and again that they can find solutions when 
challenged with problems. And if we look at the history of the EU, how many 
times have people said there is no way through this problem or that problem? 
And yet the EU has been able to find a way through it. And I hope that 
pragmatism and engagement will deliver us a mutually beneficial solution.

 * He was criticised by MPs after saying he would not publish internal 
Treasury reports analysing the costs and benefits of Brexit.To do so would 
undermine the UK’s negotiating position, he claimed. But Labour’sRachel Reeves 
said this stance was “disappointing”. AndAndrew Tyrie, the committee chair, 
said most members of the committee would probably agree with Reeves on this. 
 * He ruled out Scotland being able to negotiate its own trade deal with the 
EU.It was for the UK as a whole to strike a trade deal, he said. 
 * He said other EU countries would not want a Brexit deal that damaged the 
City because that would be bad for Europe as a whole.Perceptions on the 
continent that other European financial centres were likely to gain if London 
lost access to EU markets were likely to “melt away” as people realised that UK 
jobs were more likely to go to the US, or disappear, than to go to other 
European countries, he said. London was Europe’s financial services centre as 
well as the UK’s, he said. 
Anything which broke up this deep and broad pool of capital and expertise in 
London would be hugely detrimental to the real economy across the EU as well as 
the UK.

 * He said City firms were starting to be “realistic” about the likelihood of 
them not being able to retain the “passporting” regime that allowed them to 
operate in other EU countries. He said it in such a way as to imply he thought 
they were right to be “realistic” and to start considering alternatives. 
 * He said the UK would not impose immigration controls that stopped banks 
hiring highly-skilled workers from abroad after Brexit. 
 * He said the predictions that Treasury made about the negative impact of 
Brexit before the referendum were partly based on assumptions that were no 
longer valid. The BBC’s Kamal Ahmed has written more about this. Kamal Ahmed

 * He said Britain might have to beef up border controls considerably after 
Brexit. Asked if it was true that an additional 5,000 customs officers would be 
needed were correct, Hammond replied: 
It would be our choice, of course, but assuming that we wanted to operate an 
efficient at-the-border customs system under World Trade Organisation rules, we 
may need significantly more infrastructure at the border than we have now.

 * He said the government would not change the way the Bank of England decided 
monetary policy, despite Theresa May appearing to criticise its policy of 
quantitative easing in her Tory conference speech. He said 
My understanding is that what the prime inister was trying to say is that we 
recognise that monetary policy, which is an important tool of macroeconomic 
policy, has a distributional impact. And, to the extent the government believes 
that distributional impact needs to be addressed or corrected, we also have 
tools available to us to do that ..

There will be no change in monetary policy. Monetary policy is independently 
determined, that will continue to be the case. The monetary policy committee 
will continue to make decisions on interest rates and recommendations on 
unconventional monetary policy.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
It will be “perfectly possible” to secure a free trade agreement with the 
European Union in a short period of time, environment secretaryAndrea Leadsom 
told a select committee this afternoon. She said:

We have total regulatory equivalence with the EU. We are not Canada, where 
there were a few hundred years of different rules and regulations that needed 
to be sorted out in a free trade agreement. We’re certainly not China, where 
there is different language barriers and so on.

There is the economics and the politics, and I think the economics says it 
would be perfectly possible, perfectly realistic to get a free trade agreement 
in place in very short order.

Don’t forget the rest of the world takes an average of just over two years to 
negotiate a free trade agreement, and if I’m not very much mistaken that’s 
exactly what we’ve got between now and when we leave the EU, and that’s for a 
country that hasn’t aligned its rules and regulations for 43 years.

I’m extremely optimistic. The economics says it’s in all our interests to seek 
an agreement to continue to trade freely with each other. We have a strong hand 
because we import more than we export. The stars are in a strong place, it’s 
for us to work our socks off to deliver that.

While I write up Philip Hammond’s evidence to the Treasury committee, here is 
the latest Ipsos MORI poll to ponder.

 It shows the Conservatives with an 18-point lead over Labour.

Andrew Tyrie goes next.

Q: In 2015 George Osborne changed the way he carried out distributional 
analyses for his budgets. That meant they could not be compared with previous 
figures. Will you consider reverting to the old system?

Hammond says he is aware of this issue. No distributional analysis is perfect. 
There were weaknesses in the old system.

He says he will publish a distributional analysis for his announcements, and 
that he will consider the points Tyrie is making.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.

There was quite a lot to unpack. I will post a summary soon.
 
Wes Streeting goes next.

Q: Surely parliament should have some say in what our opening position is in 
the Brexit talks?

Hammond says Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has 
set this out. We are leaving the EU. We want controls on immigration. And we 
want the best possible access to the EU marketplace.

He says he does not want to constrain the prime minister any more than is 
necessary.

He says he remains optimistic that there are some “deeply pragmatic people” in 
the EU who can find solutions to these problems.

I hope that pragmatism and engagement will deliver us a mutually beneficial 
solution.
 
Q: Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, recently said it was 
better to invest in property than in a pension. Do you agree?

Hammond says it is not for him to give investment advice.

Q; But isn’t this a statement of the obvious?

Hammond says the housing market is different in different parts of the country.
 
Steve Baker, a Conservative, goes next.

Q: When I was in the RAF there were documents that were secret because, if 
made public, that would be detrimental to the public interest. Should the same 
apply to cabinet documents about Brexit?

Hammond says he takes the old-fashioned view that cabinet conversations should 
stay private.
 
Hammond says the markets are relaxed about the government’s decision to delay 
the point at which the government budget moves back into surplus.
 
Q: What is your view on ringfencing certain budgets?

Hammond says, in relation to ringfenced budgets, commitments were made at the 
time of the election. He will say more on this in the autumn statement, he says.
 
Chris Philp, a Conservative, goes next.

Q: Can you say that you hope and expect that financial services will get 
guarantees enabling them to carry on trading with Europe?

Hammond says he does expect that. He says London is Europe’s global financial 
services markets. He thinks, as the negotiations go on, other EU countries will 
realise that the demise of London would be damaging to them. Any jobs lost 
might to to New York, not to Europe, he says.

 * Hammond says he thinks other EU countries will realise that it is best for 
them to protect the City.  
The Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> committee member Wes 
Streetinghas been tweeting about Hammond’s refusal to guarantee that EU 
nationals will be able to stay in the UK.
Wes Streeting MP (@wesstreeting) 
Disappointing that - again - Hammond refuses to provide reassurance to EU 
nationals living in the UK about their post-Brexit futures.

<https://twitter.com/wesstreeting/status/788753059111460864>  
Q: Will you keep the same fiscal target, but just roll forward the deadline 
for getting the budget into surplus? Or will you adopt a new type of surplus 
rule?

Hammond says Kerevan should not assume anything. He should wait until the 
autumn statement, Hammond says.
 
Q: What do you think of the target to double export sales over the next four 
years? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/27/george-osborne-target-double-uk-export-long-way-off>

That will be “stretching”, says Hammond.

Q: Why do you keep the target if it cannot be met?

Hammond says the government has decided it is a useful target to have as a 
driver of policy.

 * Hammond says meeting export target will be “stretching”.
