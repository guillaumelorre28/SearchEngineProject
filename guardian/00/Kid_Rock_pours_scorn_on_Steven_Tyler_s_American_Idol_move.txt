Kid Rock wants to send Steven Tyler for counselling. The pugnacious 
rock-rapper has lost it over Tyler's decision to become a judge on corporate 
pop flagshipAmerican Idol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/american-idol>, slamming the 
Aerosmith frontman in a new interview. "It's the stupidest thing he's ever done 
in his life," Kid Rock insisted.

The man who calls himself Rock'n'Roll Jesus claims that by taking a seat at 
American Idol's judges desk, Tyler has sacrificed every stitch of his leather 
and denim rock'n'roll cred. "[Steven] is a sacred American institution of 
rock'n'roll, and he just threw it all out the window,"Kid Rock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kid-rock> told Entertainment Weekly. "[He] 
just stomped on it and set it on fire."

"We should bring back the guillotine, or whatever they call that thing," he 
continued, proposing a French revolutionary death sentence for whoever 
recommended the TV job. "And if [Steven made the decision] himself, he needs 
some serious counselling. I love him to death, but I gotta speak the truth."

Together with pop star Jennifer Lopez, Tyler joined the American Idol panel in 
September

, replacing Simon Cowell and Kara DioGuardi. The show's 10th season will begin 
on 12 January. Despite the two-day-a-week time commitment for the series, Tyler 
has insisted that he will continue playing with Aerosmith. "We're gonna work on 
[a new album] while I'm doing Idol," he told CBS last week. "This [experience] 
did nothing but bring the band together and make it stronger ... I can juggle a 
lot of balls, so it's all looking good."
