Afternoon summary

• Labour MPs have succeeded in slowing down the progress of the EU referendum 
bill through parliament. MPs need to get through four groups of amendments at 
the bill's report stage and, after five hours of debate, the Commons had only 
voted on one set of amendments (although they were well into the debate on the 
second set). Delaying tactics included: lengthy speeches, numerous 
interventions, questionable points of order, insisting on a division yet not 
actually voting against the measure (a division takes 15 minutes, whereas if 
the House votes by acclamation, it is over within seconds) and staging delays 
in the lobby.

• Conservative MPs have criticised Labour for time-wasting and accused the 
party of wanting to deny the British public a vote on the EU. This is Andrew 
Stephenson, the Conservative MP for Pendle.
Andrew Stephenson MP (@Andrew4Pendle) 
Pleased to be supporting the EU Referendum Bill. Shame Labour MP's are trying 
every trick in the book to deny voters a say on this issue
 <https://twitter.com/Andrew4Pendle/statuses/398817210149244929> November 8, 
2013 <https://twitter.com/Andrew4Pendle/statuses/398817210149244929> 
Other Conservative MPs have been saying much the same thing. (See 11.02am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/mps-debate-the-eu-referendum-bill-politics-live-blog#block-527cc3c1e4b03445394401d7>
 But Patrick O'Flynn, a Ukip candidate in the European elections, says some 
Tories protesting about Labour's tactics voted against a referendum themselves 
two years ago. <https://twitter.com/oflynnexpress/status/398816454566354944>

• Adam Afriyie, the Conservative MP, has resisted an appeal from colleagues to 
drop his call for a vote on holding the referendum next year, instead of after 
the 2015 election as James Wharton proposes. In a short speech 
<http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rrbcbd> he said the Conservatives could not 
afford to wait until after the election because they might not win it.

It strikes me that when the majority of people want a referendum before the 
next election. I have never known a time in British politics when the political 
establishment has been so remote, disconnected and out of touch with public 
opinion.

Politicians have wilfully kicked the can further and further down the road.

And we are in danger of doing so again today.

So I ask this simple question: if not in this parliament, then when else can 
we be sure to deliver an EU referendum? ...

I say to my colleague, by chasing the EU referendum dream for 2017, we risk 
losing one in 2014 and throwing away the 2015 election.

His amendment was not put to a vote.

• Friday 22 November has been set aside as the next day for the bill's debate. 
The debate will pick up where it left off, and Afriyie's amendment may well 
then be put to a vote. There are five more Fridays set aside for private 
members' business: 22 and 29 November, 17 and 24 January, and 28 February. As 
long as James Wharton can get the bill through its report stage and third 
reading by then, it will go to the Lords. If another private member's bill gets 
through its committee stage before one of these Fridays, it will take priority 
(because an "uncommenced report stage" comes before an "adjourned report 
stage", in the jargon). But no other bill is going to clear committee before 22 
November, and Wharton is confident that other days will be available to him if 
needed because other private members' bills are being held back.

• Ed Miliband has said today's debate showed "the Conservative party talking 
to itself about Europe when actually what they should be doing is talking to 
the country about the most important issue that people are facing, which is the 
cost of living crisis". (See 12.54pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/mps-debate-the-eu-referendum-bill-politics-live-blog#block-527cde8de4b03445394401e7>
 It is true that most of those MPs voting today were Conservatives. But most of 
the talking was actually done by Labour MPs.

That's all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

2.32pm GMT 

It's 2.30pm. The time set aside for the debate is over. Eleanor Laing, the 
deputy speaker, cries "order, order". 

Debate on the bill will resume on Friday 22 November, she says.

I'll post a summary in a moment.

Updated at 2.34pm GMT

2.28pm GMT 

David Lidington, the Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
minister, is speaking now.

He says the amendments being debated in this group fall into three categories: 
proposing consultation; specifying the date; and ensuring the date does not 
clash with other special dates, like holidays.

Edward Leigh, the Conservative, asks when the EU renegotiation will start.

Lidington says the renegotiation has already started. He cites the reform of 
the common fisheries policy as an example.

Gareth Thomas, the shadow Europe minister, asks Lidington what powers he wants 
to repatriate.

Lidington says what he wants to know is whether Labour will back a referendum.

2.22pm GMT 

Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, tells Peter Hain he is "in danger of 
becoming a little repetitive". She suggests it is time for him to wrap up. He 
says he is drawing to a close.

In normal debates the Speaker can impose a time limit on backbench speeches, 
but that is not allowed for debates on backbench bills.

Updated at 2.23pm GMT

2.16pm GMT 

Peter Hain is still going strong. Bill Cash, the Conservative Eurosceptic, 
intervenes, and asks Hain if he agrees that holding a referendum on 23 October 
2014, asAdam Afriyie <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/adam-afriyie> 
proposes, would be a mistake because it could lead to the campaign overlapping 
with the campaign for the Scottish independence referendum, on 18 September 
2014. Hain agrees.

Updated at 4.11pm GMT

2.12pm GMT 

And Isabel Hardman at Coffee House says today's proceedings show that the 
James Wharton bill has given the Conservative party "a real zeal for fighting 
opponents, not one another".

1.55pm GMT 

The BBC's Mark D'Arcy has written a nice blog about the delaying tactics being 
employed today. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24864911>

1.51pm GMT 

Hain describes himself as a pro-European, but a critical one. He is not a 
Europhile, he says.

As Europe minister, he became frustrated by the Euro "bubble", he says. But 
that does not mean that withdrawal would be a good idea.

And he is back to the importance of outside groups being consulted on the date 
of the referendum. (See1.13pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/mps-debate-the-eu-referendum-bill-politics-live-blog#block-527ce281e4b0541f62c72cb8>
 This proposed Labour consultation seems to include everyone. Hain has already 
mentioned the City, rural groups and organisations like the Royal British 
Legion as bodies that should have a say.

1.46pm GMT 

The BBC's Mark D'Arcy thinks Tory discipline is breaking down.

1.44pm GMT 

Peter Hain, the Labour former cabinet minister (and a former Europe minister) 
is speaking now. He says Afriyie's speech suggests he is not very confident of 
the Tories winning the election.

Hain says he is proposing an amendment that would prevent the referendum being 
held in the second half of 2017. That is because Britain will hold the 
presidency of the EU then. It would be absurd to hold the referendum during the 
presidency, he says.

Edward Leigh, the Conservative, asks Hain if Labour is in favour of holding a 
referendum and of consulting the people.

Hain says Labour has never been afraid of consulting the people. Labour has 
held more referendums than any other party, he says. In fact, the only 
referendum on Europe took place under a Labour government, he says.

1.37pm GMT 

Adam Afriyie is speaking now. His amendment says the referendum should be on 
23 October 2014.

Charles Walker, a Conservative, says having the referendum later would give 
the party more time to persuade the public.

Afriyie says the party is united on the need for a referendum.
 Adam Afriyie Photograph: /BBC Parliament 
This issue has already been kicked down the road enough, he says.

Addressing his colleagues, he says if they do not have a referendum in this 
parliament, they cannot be sure of ever being able to have one.

He winds up quickly, saying he does not want to be part of Labour's attempts 
to delay proceedings on the bill.

Updated at 4.08pm GMT

1.16pm GMT 

Charles Walker, a Conservative, asks Willie Bain if the CBI he mentioned is 
the same CBI that said Britain should join the euro.

Bain says he is confused. He thought the Conservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> were the party of 
business, he says.

1.13pm GMT 

MPs are now debating the second group of amendment. This includes Adam 
Afriyie's one.

Labour's Willie Bain is speaking. He is proposing an amendment saying there 
should be proper consultation, with groups like the CBI, before the date of the 
referendum is set.
 Willie Bain Photograph: /BBC Parliament 
1.09pm GMT 

The Gibraltar amendment has been passed by 299 votes to 0 votes.

When the deputy speaker called the vote, some MPs shouted no, prompting a 
division. But those MPs who shouted no did not vote no.

The same thing happened during the first vote this morning (the one on whether 
the House should sit in order). The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg questioned 
whether this was in order. John Bercow, the Speaker, told him that under 
Commons rules an MP who shouts no cannot then vote yes. But they are not 
obliged to actually vote no in the division.

1.03pm GMT 

Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, has just asked the sergeant-at-arms to 
investigate a delay in the no lobby. That's the third time that has happened 
today. It's another sign that someone is engaged in time-wasting.

1.00pm GMT 

My colleague Nicholas Watt has this on the speech Adam Afriyie is hoping to 
give.

12.54pm GMT 

Ed Miliband has given a soundbite to the broadcasters about today's EU 
referendum debate.

I think what we see today is the Conservative party talking to itself about 
Europe when actually what they should be doing is talking to the country about 
the most important issue that people are facing, which is the cost of living 
crisis. That’s what Labour’s talking about; that’s the right priority for the 
country.

Actually, the Conservative party has been doing very little talking in the 
Commons this morning. It's mostly been Labour MPs trying to hold things up.

12.48pm GMT 

They are now voting on new clause 1 - the one allowing Gibraltarians to be 
included.

12.47pm GMT 

The closure motion has gone through, by 293 votes to 32 - a majority of 261.

That means they can start voting on the amendments. 

12.46pm GMT 

David Cameron was in the Commons to vote in the first division this morning. 
(See 9.41am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/mps-debate-the-eu-referendum-bill-politics-live-blog#block-527cb080e4b08521f0cfb3ff>
But,according to PoliticsHome's Paul Waugh, 
<http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/87990/dont_you_know_theres_a_wharton%3F.html>
 Cameron had to be told which way to vote.

12.42pm GMT 

Back to the debate. It was James Wharton who moved the closure motion. (See 
12.30pm.)

now having a vote on whether to have a vote on the amendment.

And the Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood was on the Daily Politics with James 
Wharton. He said the Lib Dems did not want Britain to leave the EU, andhe cited 
the warning today from Nissan as a reason why that would be disastrous. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/08/nissan-automotive-industry>
Andrew Neil said Nissan said much the same thing about what would happen if 
Britain did not join the euro. (Perhaps he has been readingDaniel Hannan's 
Twitter feed?) <https://twitter.com/DanHannanMEP/status/398739668922949633> 
Horwood replied: "Well, do you want to take the gamble?" 

12.18pm GMT 

James Wharton told the BBC's Daily Politics that his bill would not complete 
its report stage today. But it would "live to fight another day", he said. 
There will be further time to debate it.

12.15pm GMT 

James Wharton, the Conservative MP who tabled the bill, has just told the 
BBC's Daily Politics that the bill is making "reasonable progress" but that 
"it's going to be slow going". Opponents were trying to hold up the bill, he 
said. But he said that he was impressed that Conservative MPs were resisting 
the urge to speak. The party was being "disciplined and focused in trying to 
deliver this bill", he said.

11.58am GMT 

Gareth Thomas, the shadow Europe minister, is speaking now. He says he is 
surprised that the government forgot Gibraltar when it drafted the bill. 
(Remember, although this is a backbench bill, it was drafted by Tory HQ.)

11.54am GMT 

Dawn Primarolo, the deputy speaker, reprimands Meg Millier for "drifting away" 
from the subject of the amendments.

11.47am GMT 

Willie Bain has finished. Labour's Meg Hillier is speaking now. Conservative 
backbenchers are keeping quiet because they don't want to delay proceedings (see
 9.31am),  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/mps-debate-the-eu-referendum-bill-politics-live-blog#block-527cad9ae4b08521f0cfb3fc>
but the relatively small number of Labour MPs are on loquacious form. Hillier 
is talking about whether 16 and 17-year-olds should be allowed to vote. This 
would encourage schools to improve civic education for teenagers, she says.

Back to John Cole. Here's the BBC's obituary. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13069441>

11.31am GMT 

Labour's Barry Sheerman raises a point of order. He says that MPs have been 
debating the bill for two hours but that James Wharton, the bill's sponsor, has 
not yet spoken. Is that in order?

Dawn Primarolo, the deputy speaker, says it is up to Wharton to decide if he

The Labour MP Willie Bain is speaking now. He has tabled an amendment saying 
citizens of British overseas territories should be allowed to vote in the EU 
referendum. 

11.17am GMT 

Back in the Commons Mike Gapes has finally finished. David Lidington, the 
Foreign Office minister, is speaking now.

Mike Gapes gets to amendment 48. It's one he "wants to spend some time on", he 
says (ominously). It would allow prisoners to vote in the referendum.

11.02am GMT 

Mike Gapes is showing no signs of coming towards the end of his speech. He has 
just made the case for British citizens living abroad in other EU countries to 
be allowed to vote in the referendum.

Conservative MPs are complaining about his delaying tactics on Twitter.

Here are three blogs relating to today's vote which are worth a look.

• Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP, says in a Telegraph blog that the 
arguments against the EU referendum bill do not stand up. 
<http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100245045/how-will-your-mp-vote-today-on-the-inout-referendum-bill/>

• Isabel Hardman at Coffee House says the various Tory Eurosceptic factions 
are now generally working together. 
<http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/11/how-tory-euroscepticism-has-changed/>

illustrates how the Tories' stance on Europe is undermining their economic 
message.

10.52am GMT 

Mike Gapes is still on his feet. He is engaged in what sounds like a learned 
exposition of the law relating to voting rights and nationality, but I'll spare 
you the details.

Outside the chamber the Ukip leader Nigel Farage is, unsurprisingly, urging 
MPs to back the Adam Afriyie amendment.

Updated at 12.54pm GMT

10.44am GMT 

Labour's Kevan Jones raises a point of order. Is it in order for James 
Wharton, the backbench sponsor of the bill, to take advice from the Foreign 
Office officials in the officials' box in the chamber? (There is a row of seats 
in the chamber where officials sit, enabling them to pass notes to ministers at 
the despatch box.) Jones says this is supposed to be a backbench bill, not a 
government bill.

Dawn Primarolo, the deputy speaker, says the officials are only supposed to 
help ministers.

10.35am GMT 

Martin Horwood has now finished. The Labour MP Mike Gapes, who has tabled more 
amendments to the bill than anyone else, is speaking now.
 Mike Gapes Photograph: /BBC Parliament 
The new clause 1 on Gibraltar does not go far enough, he says. A vote on 
Britain's membership of the EU would have an impact on other overseas 
territories, such as the Falklands.

He also promises to go through all his amendments in detail.

(Oh dear. That sounds ominous.)

10.28am GMT 

Martin Horwood is still banging on. He is now saying he supports an amendment 
tabled by Mike Gapes saying 16 and 17-year-olds should be allowed to vote in 
the referendum. Labour's Steve McCabe intervenes to say that it is unfair for 
16 and 17-year-olds to be allowed to vote in the Scottish independence 
referendum, but not the EU referendum.

10.20am GMT 

The Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood is speaking now. He doesn't sound as if he is in 
a hurry either. What would happen if Gibraltar wanted to stay in the EU, but 
the UK as a whole didn't, he asks. And he points out that, under James 
Wharton's plan, the Scots could get a vote on Britain's membership of the EU 
even if they have already voted to leave the UK.

10.14am GMT

The Lib Dem MP John Hemming and the Labour MP Thomas Docherty have now spoken 
on the Gibraltar issue. Docherty and Gareth Thomas, the shadow Europe minister, 
did not seem minded to rush things. At one point they started discussing why 
the amendment included a reference to the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865.

10.05am GMT 

Barry Sheerman, the Labour MP, is speaking now. He backed Rosindell's 
amendment.Gareth Thomas, the shadow Europe minister, says Labour backed an 
amendment at committee stage to allow Gibraltar to be included. But at the time 
the government was not in favour, he says.

Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative, is speaking now.

He is moving new clause 1, which he and James Wharton have tabled. It ensures 
the bill covers Gibraltar.

9.54am GMT 

MPs voted by 290 votes to 0 not to sit in private.

John Bercow is now taking points of order before the debate gets underway.

9.53am GMT 

Adam Afriyie, the Conservative MP trying to amend the bill so that the 
referendum would take place next year, has been speaking to BBC News. Here are 
the main points.

• Afriyie said that he wanted the referendum to be held next year to ensure 
that it actually does take place.

What I’m trying to do, I’m trying to give a voice to the British people. This 
can has been kicked down the road time and time again. We’re in danger of doing 
it again today.

• He rejected claims that he was unpopular with colleagues.

The truth is I get on very well with my parliamentary colleagues.

But, according to the Mail on Sunday last month, 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2467597/You-chateau-bottled-nuclear-powered----Tory-grandee-Soames-launches-astonishing-tea-room-broadside-EU-referendum-rebel-Afriyie.html#ixzz2k2vDpEJ1>
 Afriyie is certainly unpopular with Nicholas Soames. This is what Soames is 
reported to have said to him.

You are a chateau bottled nuclear powered ****. You are totally f***ing 
disloyal, a f***ing disgrace to your party, your fellow MPs, your Prime 
Minister and your country.

• Afriyie said the comments from the head of Nissan underlined the need to end 
uncertainty about Britain's relationship with Europe.

He’s absolutely right. This is not about being in our out of the EU, it’s 
about letting you and the whole British public have their say about our future 
relationship, because nobody has ever had a say about whether or not we’re a 
member of the EU. So I’m kind of with any business director, any company, 
anybody, who says ‘gosh let’s end this uncertainty.’ That is what I’m trying to 
do today – to get a referendum within this parliament so we know whether or not 
we’re in the EU or we’re outside the EU.

 House of Commons Photograph: /BBC Parliament 
Here's the scene in the House of Commons at the start of proceedings. As you 
can see, the Conservative benches (on the left) are reasonably full. The Labour 
ones are pretty empty.

They started with David Nuttall, a Conservative, moving that the House sit in 
private. This means there will have to be a vote, last 15 minutes. MPs won't 
vote to sit in private, and this is just a procedural device. Sometimes votes 
like this are used as a delaying tactic, or as a means of finding out how many 
MPs there are in the Commons available to vote. But Nuttall is a supporter of 
the Wharton bill, and the BBC's Mark d'Arcy says Nuttall is calling a vote now 
so that opponents cannot use the "sit in private" device later.

9.31am GMT 

James Wharton has been speaking to BBC News about today's debate. Here are the 
main points.

• Wharton said that he expected opponents of the bill to try to delay 
proceedings today. Supporters would keep their speeches short, he said. But 
opponents would try to delay proceedings so that the bill runs out of time.

What I expect to see happen is those who want to frustrate the progress of 
this bill, who don’t want to give the British people a say on our membership of 
the European Union, will try to talk at great length in the hope that it runs 
out of time. Those of us who want to deliver it, who believe that the people 
should have a say on our membership will hopefully remain relatively quiet and 
brief, with the intention of getting to votes, getting through these various 
clauses and progressing the bill to its next stage.

It looks as if the Labour MP Mike Gapes may be the chief filibusterer today. 
He has tabled dozens of amendments to the bill.

• Wharton claimed that it was now Labour, not the Conservatives, who were 
divided on Europe.

It’s funny now that you look at the debate over the last six months, a lot has 
changed. It’s now the Labour party that’s divided over Europe – that’s why Ed 
Miliband won’t be here today, he’s too weak to lead his party in any particular 
direction on this issue which is of such importance and yet he cannot express a 
strong view on it.

• He said there was "not a lot of support" in the Conservative party for 
holding the referendum before 2015.

• He played down the comments from the head of Nissan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/08/nissan-automotive-industry>, 
saying that he was not advocating British withdrawal from the EU.

 I won’t be in Parliament today making the argument that we should come out of 
the EU or that we should stay in. The argument that I’m making is that we 
should give the British people a choice, and I think that for all of the debate 
that will go on around it, it’s pretty hard in a democracy to deny people a 
choice on such a fundamental and important issue.

I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. <http://www.politicshome.com>

9.16am GMT 

Some people aren't particularly bothered whether Britain holds a referendum on 
EU membership in the next few years, but for others it is the most important 
issue in national politics. Since this group includes a chunk of Conservative 
MPs, a large number of people who will select the next Conservative leader 
(party members) and Ukip supports (who may have a big influence on the outcome 
of the general election), the subject is worth following closely.

The Conservative MP James Wharton has introduced a backbench bill that would 
oblige government to hold a referendum by the end of 2017 and today MPs will 
debate its report stage in the Commons. Another Conservative backbencher, Adam 
Afriyie, wants to amend it so that the referendum is held next October and 
today that could be put to a vote. We are not expecting many MPs to support 
Afiyie (assuming his amendment gets put to a vote), but we are likely to see 
what would amount to a small Tory rebellion. (It will be a rebellion because 
Number 10 is backing Wharton.) More generally, the debate may reveal a bit more 
about how MPs from all parties feel about the referendum issue.

It will start at 9.30am and run until 2.30pm. I will be covering it in detail.

Before we get going, here's some background reading.

• Nicholas Watt in the Guardian today explains the background to today's 
debate. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/07/early-eu-referendum-tory-adam-afriyie>

• Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome urges Afriyie to drop his amendment. 
<http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2013/11/why-adamafriyie-should-withdraw-his-amendment-to-the-jameswhartonmp-bill-today.html>

Adam Afriyie has championed holding the poll [next year]. I don’t agree with 
him, but whether one does or not is beside the point – which is that the 
Wharton Bill might pass through Parliament, but the Afriyie amendment will not. 
There is no majority in the Commons for a pre-2017 referendum. All he will 
achieve if he moves it this morning is to risk delaying the Wharton Bill, and 
he thus runs the risk of helping to kill it off. Once the amendment is on the 
floor of the House it will no longer be his property. I hope he withdraws it 
before proceedings begin today.

• The Telegraph's Benedict Brogan in his morning briefing email says that 
Afiyie is deeply unpopular with his colleagues, but that Tory MPs have 
reservations about David Cameron too. 
<http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100245094/eu-referendum-will-tory-rebels-use-adam-afriyie-to-hurt-david-cameron/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>

Views of Mr Afriyie among backbenchers seem to be universally uncomplimentary 
and in some cases downright violent. The anger voiced by Nicholas Soames was 
felt by many, even if some felt the attack was unwise. There is a suspicion 
that some of Mr Afriyie's supporters are using him to cause maximum damage to 
David Cameron. In Downing Street he is loathed as an untrustworthy upstart of 
questionable motives who is showboating, no more. But Mr Cameron will be aware 
that his popularity among his colleagues is built on success or the absence of 
it, not natural loyalty. And there is a sense from the backbenches that the 
operation has poorly handled the Bill. It is felt that the Conservatives have 
inadvertently ramped up its significance by making it a three-line whip; a 
"free vote" with a nudge here and a wink there may have been less destructive. 
There is also unhappiness about the lack of clear movement from Mr Cameron on 
exactly what powers he would like to reclaim from the EU in renegotiations.

• A survey from ConservativeHome suggests a third of Conservative members want 
an EU referendum in 2014. 
<http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2013/11/a-third-of-tory-members-back-adamafriyies-eu-referendum-plan.html>

• A Guardian story about the head of Nissan suggesting the firm would leave 
Britain if it voted to leave the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/08/nissan-automotive-industry>

• A story in today's Financial Times (subscription) saying that Cameron review 
of EU powers is proving disappointing to Conservative Eurosceptics. 
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4e5c64f0-47d3-11e3-b1c4-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz2k2f48skr>

Theresa May and the Foreign Office are locked in a battle over the benefits of 
European immigration to Britain, as the home secretary struggles to find 
evidence to support her case for imposing tighter restrictions on migrants.

Ms May has infuriated the Foreign & Commonwealth Office by “dragging her feet” 
in drafting a report on the impact of the EU’s free movement rules, amid claims 
that the evidence does not support her political narrative of the system being 
abused.

The stand-off reflects growing tensions inside David Cameron 
<http://www.ft.com/topics/people/David_Cameron>’s Conservative party as it 
appears that a vaunted review of the balance of powers between Westminster and 
Brussels is failing to provide ammunition for the eurosceptics.

In July, Mr Cameron published the first batch of review papers, covering areas 
including the single market, which found the balance of “competences” was 
“broadly appropriate”.

Some Tory MPs claimed the work reflected the bias of a “europhile Whitehall 
elite” and are hopeful that a second round of reports – due by the end of the 
year – will provide some grounds for Britain’s EU membership to be renegotiated.
