Michael O'Neill is desperate to end his wait for a first victory as Northern 
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/northernireland> manager against 
Azerbaijan on Wednesday night.

O'Neill has presided over three draws and three defeats since taking over from 
Nigel Worthington but has a real chance to end his first year in charge on a 
high note in the World Cup qualifier at Windsor Park.

A morale-boosting 1-1 draw away against Portugal last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/16/portugal-northern-ireland-world-cup-report>
 went a long way towards bringing a feel-good factor back to the squad but 
O'Neill knows there is nothing like a home win to raise spirits.

"We've played three qualifying games now, with a loss and two draws. It's time 
for us to put three points on the board," he said. "That players know that and 
I know that.

"I'm desperate to get my first win as manager and to get the first win with 
this group of players."

O'Neill has a couple of tricky selection calls to make, with Corry Evans and 
Oliver Norwood likely to drop out despite their brave performances in Portugal. 
Chris Brunt and Shane Ferguson are back after missing that match with injury 
and Dean Shiels is a strong contender to return to the starting XI to partner 
Kyle Lafferty in the forward line.
