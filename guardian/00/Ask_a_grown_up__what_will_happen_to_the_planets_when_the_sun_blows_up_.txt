Dr Lucie Green, doctor of solar physics and Royal Society University Research 
Fellow at UCL's Mullard space science laboratory, replies:As the sun starts to 
run out of fuel, the first thing that will happen is that it will swell up and 
become extremely large. It will also look redder in colour and become a type of 
star that we call a red giant. The nearest planets will be swallowed by the 
sun. This includes Mercury and Venus and probably Earth, too.

Then the sun will blow off its outer layers so only the material at the very 
centre remains. What's left will shrink and become a type of star we call a 
white dwarf.

The change in the sun's mass will affect the planets held in its orbit. The 
pull of gravity that the planets feel depends on how much mass the sun has. 
When the sun sheds its outer layers, the planets will start to move further out 
into the solar system.

The sun is about halfway through its life now though – so, don't worry, all of 
this is a long way off.
