Kenneth Grahame's relationship with his wife, his autistic son, and his writing.

The biopic, which will blend live action and CGI, has been delayed numerous 
times due to pre-production issues and cast changes.

British actor Brian Blessed is set to play Grahame's best friend, the 
eccentric William Furnivall.

Brody said of the role: "I was moved to tears by this compelling tale of a 
father's love for his child, and how the obstacles in life sometimes provide 
the spark of creativity to conquer them. This beautiful script has the power to 
remind us of our humanity and speaks to children and adults alike."

Luis Mandoki, director of Mexican film Innocent Voices, is attached to direct, 
and production is expected to begin in the UK by the end of 2013.
