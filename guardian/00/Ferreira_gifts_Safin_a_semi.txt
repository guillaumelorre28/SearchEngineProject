Marat Safin strolled into the semi-finals after his opponent Wayne Ferreira 
retired in the first set.

The South African was forced to pull out after straining a stomach muscle in 
the third game. Ferreira had treatment for the injury from the trainer and 
tried to continue but when he was trailing 5-2 the pain proved to much.

The Russian number nine seed, who knocked out former world No1 Pete Sampras, 
will meet the winner of the Tommy Haas-Marcelo Rios clash in the last four.

Ferreira said: "I knew I had the strain before the game started but I didn't 
think much of it. But the third or fourth point in the first game I hit my 
serve and really felt it pull and it gradually got worse. It is very 
disappointing and it is something I have had for most of my career."

But Ferreira also warned Safin that he must stay focused if the wants to win 
the title. The South African added: "I think for him, his mental side is his 
weakest. He had such a good match against Sampras and concentrated so hard and 
focused so hard that I was hoping today that he would not be able to do it 
twice in a row.

"You never know - he might come out in his next match and play 
horribly...that's just how he is.

"But as far as his game is concerned - he's got every shot and he is a great 
competitor and he hits the ball very well."

A delighted Safin said: "For me it is great. I will not have to spend hours on 
the court and I will not have to make all those kilometres on the court.

"I can save my energies for the semi-finals. But I was lucky. I am feeling 
well, I am confident, I am playing and I would love to win this tournament and 
I am now standing closer and closer to the final."
