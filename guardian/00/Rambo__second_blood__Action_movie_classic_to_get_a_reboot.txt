Rambo: New Blood will restart the successful action franchise by removing star 
Sylvester Stallone and replacing him with a younger actor. According to the
Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rambo-reboot-works-criminal-director-942097>
, production company Millennium Films sees the troubled Vietnam vet turned 
killing machine as a James Bond type who can be inhabited by various stars.

The script will come from Brooks McLaren, whose forthcoming work includes 
apocalyptic thriller How It Ends. Israeli director Vromen broke out with 2012 
drama The Iceman starring Michael Shannon. His last film was action thriller 
Criminal, which starred Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones.

The first Rambo film, adapted from David Morrell novel First Blood, was a 
surprise hit that led to three more films, the most recent of which was 
released in 2008. A fifth installment had been planned before Stallone 
announced he was retiring the character.

The film would follow 2015â€™s well-received Creed which was a reboot of the 
Rocky franchise, shifting the focus to a younger central character. It also 
joins Die Hard: Year One, which will follow John McClane in his early career.

The news also suggests that the previous plan of a Rambo TV show

, to star Stallone, will now be shelved.
