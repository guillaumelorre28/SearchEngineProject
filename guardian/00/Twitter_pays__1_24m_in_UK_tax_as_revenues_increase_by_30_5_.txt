Twitter’s British operation paid £1.24m in tax last year as staff enjoyed a 
£12.5m shares windfall.

The US technology company, which is the subject of rumours of a potential 
acquisition

 by Google, Disney or computing company SalesForce reported a rise in UK 
revenues of 30.5% to £76m in 2015, well short of the £135.7m that it made in 
Britain, according to estimates from analysts at eMarketer.

This could mean that up to £60m of Twitter’s revenues may have been booked in 
Ireland, where the parent company of the UK operation is incorporated.


Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> UK made a £3.36m 
pre-tax profit last year, up from £3.29m in 2014. The £1.24m tax payment was 
shown in accounts filed at Companies House.

Legally diverting revenues can help companies avoid paying higher corporation 
tax bills in the UK, and Twitter is one of a number of large companies that has 
been criticised for locating activities in Ireland to take advantage of the 
country’smore generous tax regime

A spokesman for Twitter UK said: “We account for sales in the UK and we pay 
tax in the UK.”


The company, which has headquarters in London, employed 163 people last year, 
up from 126 in 2014, running up a bill for wages, pensions and social insurance 
of £17.6m.


On average, each staff member cost almost £108,000. The pay of the company’s 
top UK directors is not revealed in the UK accounts. Dara Nasr is the managing 
director of Twitter UK

from £14m in 2014.
