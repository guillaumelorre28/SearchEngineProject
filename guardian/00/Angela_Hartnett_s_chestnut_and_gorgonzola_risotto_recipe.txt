There is nothing more comforting than a big bowl of risotto – it's a one-pot 
wonder that can be plonked on the table to feed a whole load of people. 
Chestnuts are in season now and work really well in this dish, and if you 
fancy, they go with wild mushrooms as well.

(Serves two)

2 tbsp olive oil
50g butter, for cooking
1 small onion, finely chopped
225g risotto rice
200ml white wine
150g precooked chestnuts, crushed
1,200ml vegetable stock, heated through
1 tbsp parsley, chopped
150g butter, diced, to finish
150g gorgonzola, diced
100g parmesan, grated

Heat the oil in a large pan on a medium heat with the butter. When the butter 
has melted, saute the onion for two minutes. Add the rice and toast for three 
minutes, stirring to allow the grains to open up. Pour in the wine, stirring 
while the liquid evaporates.

Add the chestnuts to the rice, followed by the stock, a ladle at a time, 
ensuring the liquid is absorbed before adding more, stirring through for 
15 minutes. Check that the rice is cooked to your liking, add the parsley and 
remove from the heat.

Add the butter and gorgonzola and serve immediately topped with grated 
parmesan.
