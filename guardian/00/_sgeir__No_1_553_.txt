Hometown: Laugarbakki, Iceland. 

The lineup: Ásgeir <https://www.theguardian.com/music/asgeir> Trausti 
Einarsson (voice, guitar).

The background: We had intended to feature a hip hop star out of Chicago's 
drill scene calledKatie Got Bandz today <https://twitter.com/KatieGotBandz> but 
we couldn't get her tracks or a pic to go with the article in time so we've 
gone for the closest thing we could find to a bolshy rap teen - an Icelandic 
troubadour. And not just any Icelandic troubadour; a popular one. Really 
popular. One in 10 Icelanders own his album - sorry for being patronising and 
doing the maths for you, but that's the equivalent of six million Brits owning 
the record, which would make it the best-selling album in UK history, above 
Queen's Greatest Hits, Abba's Gold, the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's, and Adele's 21.

Funnily enough, Ásgeir - or Ásgeir Trausti Einarsson to his dad, who is 72 and 
mostly pens his 21-year-old son's poetic lyrics - has ventured into hip hop 
territory: over Christmas and New Year,Hvítir skór 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDYp1vFAfA>, recorded with an Icelandic rapper 
called Blaz Roca, was number 1 in Iceland for nine consecutive weeks. It's 
pretty awful - thinkMorris Minor and the Majors 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ju4h2GLD0>, only less witty - but still, you 
can't argue with statistics like that. There are more where that came from. His 
first single,Sumargestur <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYiYh9znsU> - 
mercifully not another rap team-up but more his regular style, which is wistful 
acoustica, suffused with wintry melancholy and sung with his trademark 
tremulous warble - peaked at number 2, and his last three singles have all 
reached number 1. AndLeyndarmál <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH6WQBsG8BI> 
stayed at the top for six weeks. Imagine a slightly more idiosyncratic Ben 
Howard - or to look at it from the opposite side, a somewhat less esoteric 
Antony Hegarty or Jeff Buckley - becoming the biggest star in the country. 
That's what Ásgeir is in Iceland.

He wouldn't have sold many copies of his debut album, Dyrd í dauðathogn (In 
The Silence - due for worldwide release this October), had they only been 
bought by people in his home town: he was born and raised in the middle of 
nowhere, in a place called Laugarbakki, which apparently has a population of 
40. Well, 39, unless he's still living there or one of the dozen or so female 
inhabitants had a baby. He's hoping to shift a few more units now because he's 
found an unlikely ally in acclaimed US singer-songwriterJohn Grant 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/03/john-grant-interview-singer-songwriter>
, who currently lives in Iceland and has helped Trausti prepare an English 
language version of the record, even assisting in the translation of the 
lyrics. Not that it was an easy partnership, mainly because Grant was so 
jealous of his young rival. "On some days I want to tear my hair out at how 
young and beautiful and talented and simultaneously nonchalant about it all he 
is," he said at the time. "His knack for melody and gorgeous harmonies coupled 
with his amazing sense of rhythm and virtuosity on acoustic guitar should make 
him a household name, no matter what language he's speaking. I can say with 
total certainly, that at the age of 20 that I did not know my asshole from a 
hole in the ground. Or however that saying goes." You can catch the Icelandic 
superstar flaunting his gorgeousness at Somerset House in London, tomorrow 
night. Expect to see Grant, minus hair, weeping with envy down the front.
