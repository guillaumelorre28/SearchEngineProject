On 22 September 1968, Elektra Records' publicity director, Danny Fields, 
travelled to Ann Arbor, Michigan to see the MC5's fusion of insurrectionary 
politics and high-energy rock'n'roll. He was floored by the experience. He was 
even more floored when the 5 (pictured) insisted he see their "baby brother" 
band, a strange improvisatory troupe called the Psychedelic Stooges. "We 
weren't interested in anything like writing a song or making a chord change,"
Iggy Pop <https://www.theguardian.com/music/iggy-pop> later told the writer 
Clinton Heylin. A fortnight later, Fields dragged out his boss, Jac Holzman, to 
see the two bands, who were both signed to the label. They made Elektra no 
money, but between them they set the twin and oppositional poles of punk 
culture for decades to come: the 5 were the politically committed, musically 
experimental revolutionaries; the Stooges were the three-chord nihilists, 
living out their basest instincts. Both templates continue to thrive.
