An old joke goes: "A man went to the optician for an eye test. The optician 
took the man outside and pointed to the sky. 'What's that?' the optician asked. 
'The sun,' the man replied. The optician said, 'Well, how far do you want to 
see, then?'"

A 6ft man standing and looking out to the horizon can see approximately 5km 
away, as the Earth's surface curves out of sight. But our ability to see 
extends well beyond the horizon. It also depends on the amount of dust and 
pollution in the air, which usually limits normal vision to less than 12 miles. 
However, in 1941 a vision scientist, Selig Hecht, worked out that, with a 
clear, unobstructed view, the human eye could see a candle light flickering 
about 30 miles away.

So the answer depends on how big and bright the object is. The sun is 150m 
kilometres away, but you can see it because it's so big and bright.
