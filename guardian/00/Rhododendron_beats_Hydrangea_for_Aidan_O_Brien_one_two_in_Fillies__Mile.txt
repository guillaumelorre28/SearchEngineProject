Rhododendron’s authoritative two-and-a-quarter-length defeat of her stable 
companion Hydrangea in the Fillies’ Mile here on Friday was Aidan O’Brien’s 
20th Group One or Grade One winner in a remarkable season that still has 
several more big days ahead.

O’Brien, who also saddled the first three home in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe

 last Sunday, needs five more top-level victories to equal Bobby Frankel’s 
all-time record of 25 in a calendar year, and he is an even-money chance with 
William Hill to do so.

“We were a little confused with her [latest] run in the Moyglare [when third 
behind Intricately, trained by his son Joseph],” O’Brien said. “We always 
thought she was a little bit better than the other filly [Hydrangea, who 
finished second] at home. You couldn’t be sure with them but they are two very 
good-looking fillies out of two very good mares.

“I’m not sure if we will go to America [for the Breeders’ Cup]. They are both 
in a good place and very healthy and happy at the moment, so it’s an option if 
the lads want to do it.”

Rhododendron is by Galileo out of Halfway To Heaven, who won the Irish 1,000 
Guineas, and is the new favourite for next year’s1,000 Guineas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/1000-guineas> at 8-1. She also heads the 
market for the Oaks, at a top price of 10-1.

Elsewhere on the card Mrs Danvers stretched her unbeaten record to five starts 
with a success in the five-furlong Cornwallis Stakes which was inevitable with 
a quarter of a mile still to run. Jonathan Portman’s filly broke a track record 
that had stood since 2002 in the process and she is an obvious contender for 
the Group One Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot next season.
