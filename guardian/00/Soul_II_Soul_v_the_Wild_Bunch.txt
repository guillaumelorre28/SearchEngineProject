As the sound systems of London's Soul II Soul and Bristol's Wild Bunch 
clashed in St Barnabas crypt in Bristol on New Year's Eve, the influence of 
Kingston and the Bronx on music made in British cities was becoming ever more 
apparent. Soul II Soul's name made it obvious what they added to the mix of 
reggae and hip-hop, while the Wild Bunch brought a post-punk steeliness. 
International success arrived more rapidly for the Londoners, but would be more 
lasting for the Bristolians, some of whose members evolved to become 
Massive Attack.
