Thank you and good evening

That's all from me and Ten this evening. In its favour: that was a supremely 
slick awards ceremony. Not in its favour: it didn't even show all the awards, 
and everyone was extremely well-behaved. We have more analysis on the winners 
and losers coming, but for now, good night.

Best film

Cate Blanchett glides onto stage in a dress that's molten sequins basically. 
She looks unbelievable – she's sort out out metalic-ing the Aacta itself.

The nominations are Dead Europe, The Great Gatsby, Mystery Road, The Rocket, 
Satellite Boy, and The Turning. And congratulations if you've seen them all: 
given the tiny number of screens they've shown on in Australia, you are either 
a critic or extremely committed. All this great work deserves to be seen more.

And the award goes to The Great Gatsby, which is collected by Catherine Martin 
and Baz Luhrmann. "Let's not fight darling," Baz teases his wife. "Why stop 
now? We have for 26 years," replies Catherine. The audience swoons. Everyone 
wants to be them, surely. What a couple.

Best television drama series

Redfern Now. Photograph: ABC, Mark Rogers/AAP 
The big telly category here. Offspring, Redfern Now, Wentworth and Seragoon 
Road are nominated here – with Redfern Now taking the Aacta. Good news! By some 
way the best drama on this list in my opinion.

11.01am GMT 

Also: that tribute to Baz started to get a bit embarrassing towards the end. I 
hope the new Strictly Ballroom musical is a great deal better than that.

Best actor, best actress, best supporting actor (film)

What! I think we just had three massive awards flashed up on screen for a 
millisecond because Ten had more important things to show us. Nice to have a 
tribute to Baz, with literal dance interpretations of Romeo and Juliet, but not 
at the expense of the actual awards – even if the actors you gave them to 
couldn't make the ceremony.

So, I think we just had

Best actor in a film: Leonardo DiCaprio for The Great Gatsby

Best actress in a film: Rose Byrne for The Turning

Best supporting actor in a film: Joel Edgerton for The Great Gatsby

There's probably a lesson in there about giving one of your biggest awards to 
a Hollywood superstar and not even nominating some great Australian talent. (

Best actress in a television drama

Stewart's co-star, Asher Keddie, is up in this next category in fact. Also 
nominated for best actress is Marie Brunel for An Accidental Soldier, Sheridan 
Smith for Mrs Biggs, andClaudia Karvan, who wins the award for Time of Our 
Lives, in which she plays the largely unlikable Caroline in a way that makes 
you not entirely hate her. That's some feat.

"Thank you to the ABC for continuing to make such fine Australian drama," says 
Karvan in a slightly emotional speech. Quite right.

Best guest or supporting actress in a television drama

Kat Stewart takes the award for her role in Offspring – I love her as Billie, 
I must admit, a perfect foil to Asher Keddie. She beats Kris McQuade 
(Wentworth), Heather Mitchell (Power Games) and Robyn Nevin (Top of the Lake) 
in this category

Best telefeature or mini series

An interesting category this, with four quite different shows – An Accidental 
Soldier, Mrs Biggs, Power Games and Top of the Lake – battling it out for the 
honour. And the Aacta goes to … the excellentTop of the Lake. 

10.36am GMT 

Best performance in a television comedy

Weirdly, these nominations begin with an advertisement for Wolf Creek 2. (I 
should admit that I just typed that as Wolf Hall 2, which would be a rather 
different thing).

Shaun Micallef takes the award for Mad as Hell on ABC1, and gives a cheeky 
speech poking fun at his fellow nominees: Lisa McCune (It's a Date), Robyn 
Nevin (Upper Middle Bogan), and Josh Thomas (Please Like Me).

10.30am GMT 

Best reality television series

Shameless promotion from Ten, who put a little Biggest Loser pop-up in the 
corner of the screen while the nominees are read out: Australia's Got Talent, 
The X Factor, My Kitchen Rules and Masterchef the Professionals. And in a 
moment surely all the sweeter because it involved them beating MKR,Masterchef 
take the award.

Matt Preston describes himself as a drunken uncle at the raucous wedding of 
the Aactas, before the camera pans to a hall of slightly glazed and impeccably 
behaved people. It's not the Logies is it?

Best direction in a film

Baz Luhrmann takes the Aacta for best director, shows us his amazing suit and 
says he's "genuinely surprised to be receiving this award because it doesn't 
happen to me that often."

He's paying tribute to making The Great Gatsby in Australia, and to a diverse 
and brilliant crew. "I never remember a second where anyone ever gave up," he 
says. And of course to Catherine Martin, designer extraordinaire, and also 
Luhrmann's wife.

Bit odd to follow that with a shouty advert for the Biggest Loser, Ten.

Best guest or supporting actor in a television drama

Power Games is having a good night already – Luke Ford takes the gong here, 
seeing off competition from his co-star Alexander England "a young Gene 
Hackman" apparently, Peter Mullan for Top of the Lake, and David Wenham for 
Better Man.

And yes, Kat Stewart's dress is indeed gorgeous. 

10.08am GMT 

Is Tony Abbott really doing an advertisment for the Winter Olympics on Ten? 
This man's the prime minister. Hasn't he got more important things to do, like 
be cross about the ABC or something?

Jacki Weaver: Raymond Longford Award

Silver Linings Playbook's Bradley Cooper gives a charming introduction to this 
award, which honours Jacki Weaver's contribution to Australian film. She is the 
first woman to receive the award, says Claudia Karvan, paying tribute to her – 
which given that she's its 39th recipient, is slightly jaw-dropping.

While these speeches about Weaver are lovely, I must say I'm dying to hear 
from the actor herself. She gave an interview to ABC radio recently that made 
me swoon. (That she's now doing so wearing specs on a string, is making me love 
her even more). "I'm sure I don't deserve it, but I'm not giving it back," she 
quips, slightly teary. Even better, she's giving love advice from the podium.

And here's a lovely candid pic of her with the award …

Best supporting actress in a film
Elizabeth Debicki takes this award for her role in The Great Gatsby. Well 
deserved – I saw Debicki on stage in Sydney Theatre Company's The Maids last 
year, and she was by some way the best thing about it. (And she was sharing a 
stage with Cate Blanchett and Isabelle Huppert).
Here's she's beaten off competition from her Gatsby co-star Isla Fisher, 
Mirrah Foulkes for The Turning, and Alice Keohavong who was nominated for The 
Rocket.

Best lead actor in a television drama

Lachy Hulme takes the award for Power Games: The Packer-Murdoch Story which 
aired on Nine, beating Ernie Dingo (Redfern Now), Meyne Wyatt (Redfern Now) and 
Remy Hii – whose performance in SBS's Better Man I particularly admired.

Hulme does a polite, dignified set of thank yous and hands over to Geoffrey 
Rush, who has the most marvellous hair this evening.

Shane Bourne is hosting tonight's show

To a not entirely receptive audience, it must be said. He's not Tina Fey or 
Amy Poehler that's for sure – although, that Scott Morrison gag bought at least 
a flicker of a smile to my face. We also get a fabulous cut to Baz Luhrmann and 
Catherine Martin who both look immaculate. I can't wait for them to stand up 
and show us their full outfits.

And we're late …

It wouldn't be Australian television if the broadcaster didn't delay a show 
for the purpose of advertisers without a thought for their viewers – and so we 
begin five minutes late, with Ten's live in Sydney montage, with some reporters 
from Wake Up I'd be amazed if anyone recognised,given the show's viewing figures
 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/20/the-trouble-with-ten>. Also on 
show: gorgeous Sydney sunshine and some lovely frocks.

Good evening and welcome to our Aacta awards liveblog

I'd say we're live from the red carpet, but in fact we're live from my sitting 
room thanks to the wonder of Ten. (Not a phrase used very often, it must be 
said). Tonight we discover which films and television programmes Australia 
should be most proud of – regardless of whether most Aussies would regard them 
as Australian productions. So, will Leo DiCaprio scoop best actor? Could The 
Rocket triumph over Baz Luhrmann's blockbuster? And which incredible piece of 
television will take the award for best reality TV show?

All this and more to come …
