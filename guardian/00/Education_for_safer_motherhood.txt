A square one-storey open-plan shack in Njarr Al village in Kerala, southern 
India, serves as today's meeting point as a Dr Krishnan Unni of Aims hospital 
addresses a crowd of rural mothers, some also expecting babies. He is using a 
PowerPoint presentation.

With no plug sockets or electricity nearby, the computer is powered using the 
Aims outreach vehicle. The women stare back at the screen, whispering to each 
other, as images of food items appear.

"Which of these is nutritious?" Unni asks, pointing between fruits and a plate 
of rice.

Many women in rural areas are anaemic due to poor nutrition, which is one of 
the leading causes of post-natal illnesses and maternal death. To combat this 
Unni provides expectant mothers with iron supplements and encourages them to 
visit the hospital to have an institutional birth.

Unni issues appointment cards to women who don't know when their babies are 
due. They will be given a scan and a date for a further appointment.

"The women aren't educated," says Unni. "And they can sometimes be stubborn 
about change. Many women in tribal and rural areas don't want to or can't 
travel to the hospital. They've had home births in their families for 
generations and don't understand the issues. But we're making progress â€¦ 
slowly."
