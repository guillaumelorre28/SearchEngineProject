No one invented swearing. We've probably always had words that we use to 
express strong emotions. These words have become naughty because of two things: 
the intention behind their use (anything can be a swear word if said in the 
right way – imagine hurting yourself and shouting, "Oh, socks!") and because 
most of our swear words are names for things that are considered impolite.

The most common swear words are to do with bodies and bodily functions, which 
are private, messy or rude, and the more we avoid using them, the more power 
the words have when we do.

We don't know how the earliest speakers of English swore, because it wasn't 
written down. Before the 15th century – which is when swearing first appeared 
in writing – most writing was done by monks, and they were too good, and their 
work too important, for them to write down swear words.
