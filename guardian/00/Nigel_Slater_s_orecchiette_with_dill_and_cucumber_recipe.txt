A light, late summer dish, at once both soft and crisp, hot and cold.

The recipe

Lightly peel half a medium-sized cucumber, then slice it in half lengthways. 
Scrape out the watery core with a teaspoon and discard it, then cut the 
cucumber into thick slices. I suggest about 2cm in thickness. Put the cucumber 
into a bowl and stir in 2 tbsp of grain mustard together with 2 tbsp of Dijon 
mustard.

Put a deep pan of water on to boil and salt it generously. Cook 250g of 
orecchiette for about 9 minutes until tender. While the pasta cooks, chop a 
small bunch (about 8g) of dill and stir it into the cucumber. Drain the pasta, 
then toss it with the cucumber, mustard and dill. Stir in a couple of tbsp of 
goat’s curd or mascarpone, then divide the pasta between 2 plates or bowls and 
add a final extra 75g of curd to each one. Serves 2.

The trick

There are both hot and cold elements in this dish and they should be extreme. 
The pasta should be freshly drained and steaming hot, the cucumber dressing 
crisp and ice cold. If you wish, you could warm the goat’s curd in a small 
saucepan then toss it through the pasta a moment before eating.

The twist

This recipe owes something to the classic mustard sauce for gravlax. I like to 
add a few gherkins and capers, too, and there is a temptation to include some 
strips of smoked salmon. Smoked mackerel would also be a good alternative. 
Sharpen its edges further with a dash of lemon juice or tarragon vinegar if you 
like.
