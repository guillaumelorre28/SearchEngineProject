Back before he was the rapper known as Diddy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/diddy>, Sean "Puffy" Combs was a humble 
unpaid intern at Uptown Records. His ambition saw him rise to A&R executive, 
where he signed Jodeci and Mary J Blige (among others) to the label, but 
differences with management led him to be fired in 1993. Combs had an ace up 
his sleeve, however â€“ a rapper by the name of Biggie Smalls, for whom Combs set 
up Bad Boy Entertainment to release his now quadruple platinum debut album 
Ready to Die in 1994.
