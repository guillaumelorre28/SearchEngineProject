We know one thing: it will be classy. Ron Burgundy, no doubt to the 
consternation of the other members of the KVWN Channel 4 news team, is to 
publish what is being described as a "tell-all" memoir, entitled Let Me Off at 
the Top! My Classy Life and Other Musings. Burgundy, as readers will have no 
need reminding, was the anchorman for a San Diego TV station, until being fired 
in the late 1970s for accidentally telling the city to "Go fuck yourself".

Publishers Crown (part of Random House) say the memoir "will offer a rare 
glimpse behind the camera into the real life of a man many consider to be our 
greatest living news anchor". Furthermore, Burgundy "will share personal 
anecdotes about the women in his life, about his dog, Baxter, and his legendary 
news team. Along the way, he'll also give sage advice on a variety of topics 
that matter most to him."

Burgundy is nothing if not confident of the book's success: "I don't know if 
it's the greatest autobiography ever written. I'm too close to the work," he 
said in a statement. "I will tell you this much: the first time I sat down and 
read this thing, I cried like a goddamn baby, and you can take that to the 
bank."

The book is due to be published on 19 November in the US. By a strange 
coincidence, the second film about Burgundy, Anchorman: The Legend Continues, 
starringWill Ferrell <https://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell>, is due for 
release a month later, on 20 December.
