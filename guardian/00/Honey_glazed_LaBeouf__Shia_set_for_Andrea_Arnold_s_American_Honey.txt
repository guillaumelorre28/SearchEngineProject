Described previously as a film about the perils and joys of young romance, 
Arnold’s fourth feature-length project centres on a runaway teenager who makes 
a living by selling magazine subscriptions around the US. The young woman soon 
finds herself wrapped up in a hard-partying, law-breaking lifestyle.

LaBeouf, best known for the Transformers films and his recent foray into art 
house cinema via Lars Von Trier’s Nymphomaniac, will play an unspecified role. 
The lead role of the teenager does not yet appear to have been cast.
