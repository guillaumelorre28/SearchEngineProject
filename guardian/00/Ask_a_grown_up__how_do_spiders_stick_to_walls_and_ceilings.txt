If you could take a really close look at a spider, then you would see that 
their feet are covered in tiny little triangular hairs. They look a little bit 
like paddles on the ends of stalks, and they give the spider a much bigger 
surface area. When the feet make contact with a wall or ceiling, they create a 
force – a temporary attraction between the bottom of the spider's foot and 
whatever surface it's on (the grown-up name for it is van der Waals forces).

So, how do they move without getting stuck? They can change the angle at which 
these little hairs are stuck to the wall. It's a bit like a Post-it note; tug 
at it from the middle and it won't budge, but you can peel it from one corner 
very easily.Spiders <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/spiders> are 
actually very vulnerable. If a tarantula fell from a height, it would squish, 
because all its organs are in its abdomen and it doesn't have a skeleton to 
protect them. So they have to be very good at holding on.
