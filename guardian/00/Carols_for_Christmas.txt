That beautiful carol 'In the Bleak Midwinter' is based on a poem written by 
Christina Rossetti in response to a commission from the magazine Scribner's 
Monthly for a Christmas poem in 1872. One hopes they paid well. The lines of 
one of my predecessors as poet laureate, the Irish poet Nahum Tate, are on our 
lips still when we sing the lyrics of 'While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks by 
Night', written by him in 1703 – though usually changed to 'washed their socks' 
by most school-children. Carols, according to the 1928 edition of The Oxford 
Book of Carols, are 'simple, hilarious, popular and modern'. They are a kind of 
folk song where direct poetry and accessible music eagerly meet. The oldest of 
our carols date from the 15th century and 'give voice to the common emotions of 
healthy people in language that can be understood'. I hope that by this time 
next year some of these sparkling new poems for carols will have been set to 
music. On behalf of all the poets here to you, their readers, I wish you a very 
happy Christmas.Carol Ann Duffy

The Bee Carol
Carol Ann Duffy


Silently on Christmas Eve,
the turn of midnight's key;
all the garden locked in ice –
a silver frieze –
except the winter cluster of the bees.


Flightless now and shivering,
around their Queen they cling;
every bee a gift of heat;
she will not freeze
within the winter cluster of the bees.


Bring me for my Christmas gift
a single golden jar;
let me taste the sweetness there,
but honey leave
to feed the winter cluster of the bees.


Come with me on Christmas Eve
to see the silent hive –
trembling stars cloistered above –
and then believe,
bless the winter cluster of the bees.

Carol
Fleur Adcock
Carry the child at ease in the womb,
lulled in a cradle of bone and sinew:
a winter child with an escort of songbirds;
a summer child for a winter home.


Carry the child content in your arms.
Carry the child high on your shoulders,
tall as a candle: a radiant torch,
a solar-powered lamp to light a dark room.


Call the child to be dandled with rhymes,
livened with drum-talk, cuddled and calmed
with flutes and fiddles, anthems and psalmody.
Welcome the child with a sky full of chimes.

Hark
John Agard
Drink up the mull till you're full
Don't mince on the pies
It's the season to gourmandize
Stock up on the stockings
Crack up with the crackers
The chimney looks the same
But Santa's gotten fatter
Time to be reckless
With the turkey in your trolley
Feel free to be legless
In front of the telly


Now with the innards fully filled
Spare a thought for tender words –
Peace. Share. Goodwill.

Carol of the Birds
Gillian Clarke


Winter sun is cold and low,
mew the kite and crake the crow,
bird of flame, bird of shadow,
ballad of blood on snow.


Owls are calling llw, llw, llw,


Kyrie, hullabaloo.


Small birds come without a sound,
starving to the feeding ground,
till the robin with his wound
carols the ice-bound land.


Noctua, hibou, gwdihw,


Owl's lullaby – who? who? who?


The story tells of pain and blood,
the troubles of a restless world,
a star that lights the snowy fields,
towards a newborn child.


Owls are calling llw, llw, llw,


Kyrie, hullabaloo,
noctua, hibou, gwdihw,


lullaby – who? who? who?

Mumbai Kissmiss
Imtiaz Dharker
Of course! Who is not knowing this,
that after Happy Diwali comes Merry Kissmiss!
Impossible to miss, when allovermumbai,
Matharpacady to A to Z Market, rooftops
are dancing in chorus
and alloversky 
is fully full with paper stars.


Hear! Horns are telling at midnight on every street,
happy happy happy! We know very well 
to make good festival, and Saint Santa is 
our honoured guest in Taj Hotel. 
We are not forgetting.


And allovermumbai alloversky 
is fully full with paper stars.


See! Tree is shining and snow (cotton-
wool but looks good, no?) Small child also
face is shining, licking icing, this
must be what snow tastes like
under the paper stars.


And allovermumbai alloversky 
is fully full with paper stars.

Midwinter Song
Maura Dooley
Snow flies fierce across the land
as cardboard doors unfold,
a star shines clear on bitterness,
on lack and want and cold.


An old tale tells of spite's true cost,
how greed's full rhyme is need.
The City's rime is piss and frost,
icesharp in word and deed.


A robin's breast, a berry bright,
is dimmed by falling night,
could starlight melt a frozen heart,
a baby make all right?


The oldest story's for the newest face,
a fire in winter or a moment's grace.


Advent
for Daisy or Milo
Antony Dunn
O little child, o child to come
knocking at the world's door, for whom,
still, your small universe of womb
is all there is to know, strike dumb
the voices of our worldly gloom;
no room, no room, no room.


O little child, make good the sum
of human love. Of every crumb
create a thousand shares. Presume
this much, at least, that there's one home
from which the answer will not come,
no room, no room, no room.


In Winter's House
Jane Draycott


In winter's house there's a room
that's pale and still as mist in a field
while outside in the street every gate's shut firm,
every face as cold as steel.


In winter's house there's a bed
that is spread with frost and feathers, that gleams
in the half-light like rain in a disused yard
or a pearl in a choked-up stream.


In winter's house there's a child
asleep in a dream of light that grows out
of the dark, a flame you can hold in your hand
like a flower or a torch on the street. 


In winter's house there's a tale
that's told of a great chandelier in a garden,
of fire that catches and travels for miles,
of all gates and windows wide open.


In winter's house there's a flame


being dreamt by a child in the night,


in the small quiet house at the turn in the lane


where the darkness gives way to light.


The Passion of the Holly
(air: The Sans Day Carol)
Ian Duhig


We're the Sans Day carollers who call once a year;
if we're sans bread and sans brass, we are not sans care,
for the coming of Jesus, born poor to be king
and the passion of the holly at Christmas we sing.


O the holly bore a berry as white as a bone,
for we sing of one new life but many more gone
so we sing for those grieving as all theirs who died,
whether Christian or not at this cold Christmastide.


But the holly bore a berry as green as new grass,
as Our Lady bore Jesus who died on the cross,
and if summer seems laid in the sepulchre's night,
there's no dark hold so strong it's not broken by light.


When the holly bore a berry as black as a mine,
we lit thirty-three candles like Christ's years, a sign;
for poor miners give daylight their living to make,
and some sacrificied more when the holly wore black.


Now the holly bears a berry as Christ's blood it's red,
for the Christ-child means good that can rise from the dead;
and much sharper than holly was Jesus' crown,
and yet he was raised up and Lord Satan cast down.


O our holly and its berry were soon turned to dust,
as were we who in singing and kindness put trust;
and yet though we sing now to you from the grave,
you can hear us because we are singing of love.


What Ails Thee, Santa?
Ruth Fainlight
Oh what can ail thee, Santa Claus,
woebegone instead of jolly?
In fact we think you look almost
off your trolley.


Oh what can ail thee, Santa Claus?
You have a job, though times are hard,
in this well-heated shopping mall.
Thank your lucky stars.
 

So stretch a smile across your face,
get back into Santa's grotto,
check your beard is still in place,
then coax that toddler
 

toward your lap, to hotly breathe
into your ear her present-list.
She slides off, happy. The next seems
more suspicious –


but you win him over. Morning,
afternoon, it doesn't matter.
Still another month to Christmas.
What ails thee, Santa?


Carol
Ann Gray
We sit down together at Christmas,
we toast those who cannot be there,
throughout the laughter and plenty
we all know there's one empty chair.


There's frost on the grass in the orchard
where songbirds have gathered their choir,
snow colours the hawthorn, the holly,
we've heaped up the logs on the fire.


Those that we love may be fighting,
in countries where we've never been,
where it freezes at night in the mountains,
we wish they could be here to see


there's frost on the grass in the orchard,
where songbirds have gathered their choir,
snow colours the hawthorn, the holly,
we've heaped up the logs on the fire.


There are those who may have had children
who'll have families now of their own,
they'll phone when they're carving the turkey
but their old folk will still feel alone,


though there's frost on the grass in the orchard
where songbirds have gathered their choir,
snow colours the hawthorn, the holly,
we've heaped up the logs on the fire.


There are some who can't think about Christmas,
It's a picture they've seen on a tin.
There's no table, no family, no plenty,
they're always outside looking in.


There's frost on the grass in the orchard
where songbirds have gathered their choir,
snow colours the hawthorn, the holly,
we've heaped up the logs on the fire.


Let's open our hearts then, this Christmas,
look out for those who're alone,
Lay one extra place at the table,
throw open the doors of our home,


because there's frost on the grass in the orchard
where songbirds have gathered their choir,
snow colours the hawthorn, the holly,
and we've heaped up the logs on the fire.


Carol
James Harpur


The falcon flew from dark to dark
drew silver from the Northern Star
and headed for the crinkled hills,
the rivers, lakes and waterfalls
 to find the source of light on earth
 the source of light on earth.


And as three weary pilgrim kings
looked up and saw his glittering wings
the falcon saw a darkened town
a stable glowing like a crown
 and knew that he had found the truth
 that he had found the truth.


The falcon hovered like a star
his wings spun out a spirit fire
that drew the kings inside the shed:
the child asleep in his straw bed
 was dreaming of a silver bird
 was dreaming of a bird.


His task now done, the falcon rose
a spark ablaze with joyful news;
he lit the stars, he lit the moon
then vanished in the arc of sun
that dawned beyond the Southern Cross
 beyond the Southern Cross.


Happy Christmas
Frieda Hughes
At Halloween the Christmas baubles
Already decorate the stores,
Ignoring guilt as high as corbels
Shoppers stalk the shopping floors.


The birth of Christ is pushed aside
Not aided by the fear his name
Might irritate the shopping public
And distract their shopping aim.


But there is no gift worth more
Than our company – it's given free
To those we love, more precious than
Any gift beneath a Christmas tree.


Maw Broon's Jings! Bells!
Jackie Kay


Speeding thru the snaw,

Christmas Tree
for Jacob
Michael Longley
You are my second grandson, Christmas-born.
I put on specs to read your face. Whispering
Sweet nothings to your glistening eyelids,
Am I outspoken compared with you? You sleep
While I carry you to our elderly beech.
Your forefinger twitches inside its mitten.
Do you feel at home in my aching crook?
There will be room beneath your fontanel
For this branchy diagram of winter.
I take you back indoors to the Christmas tree.
Dangling for you among the fairy lights
Are the zodiac's animals and people.


Carol
Lachlan Mackinnon


The power to annihilate
Our public and our private fate
 Is sleeping in a manger.
Be you sage or shepherd, stranger,


Lean close, then leave before he wakes
And his clear gaze clear judgment makes
 On all your works and days,
The little terror, born to raise


The dead and, yes, the living dead,
The bled by bankers, the unfed,
 And every mortal soul
That labours for its daily dole


Of pittance from the pitiless
Unceasing rasp of dailiness,
 That shivers like a child
When the nocturnal wind goes wild


About the outhouse and the things
Left out to dry. An angel sings
 And all of us are hushed
By something that will not be rushed,


The sweetness pure as heather honey,
The fortune never told in money,
 This little scrap will bring.
Yes, you have heard an angel sing:


Now go you, you have seen enough
To carry this good news through rough
 Terrain to careworn days,
New angels, with unending praise.


song for the longest night
(dig the stillness)
Paula Meehan


my old friend
 still holding
 at the end
of a needle
 or a gun


too much dope
or not enough
 the shadow on the wall
 the swinging rope


let's take the old road
 out of town
we'll stop by the woods


do you remember?
we went there as kids


there's a fire path up
to a ring of standing stones


we could lay there
 under stars
our eyes open wide
pinpricks in the night


trace our mortal fate
 across the glittering chart


we could sleep
 there at the heart
the moon waxing full
the deepest dreamless sleep


and wake at first light
to a new spangled year


look back
along the trail


our trackmarks
 in the snow


the falling snow


Christmas Hero
Grace Nichols
Let the Yuletide jump-up begin.
What you having? Wine? Rum? Gin?
The more we are together
the merrier we will feel the weather.
So come in your glad rags – go with the flow.
Good tidings hiding under the mistletoe.


Welcome, welcome one and all.
Just follow the holly around the hall.
Outside Jack-Frost might be nipping

but inside hot as carnival
O guess who's coming ever gallant through the snow?
Yes, Robin Redbreast my Christmas card hero.


So let's make a toast to our special guest,
who warms us all with the flame of his chest.


Carol
To the tune of "In the Bleak Midwinter"
Sean O'Brien
Darling, look, it's snowing. We should make them pay,
The idle herd who spoil the view by getting in the way.
Soon we shall have altered the meaning of "estate"
When all these charvers line up on the wrong side of the gate.


They don't just want an orange, they want a bag of nuts –
I should bloody coco. Let them live on cuts.
Let them dine on cardboard, lie down in a ditch.
Will they never listen? Jesus loves the rich.


Whip them through the parish, close the work-house door.
Oh let us be realistic: all they are is poor,
And therefore not quite human – nothing left to sell.
Merry Christmas, darling, and the rest can go to Hell.


Oh, the snow keeps falling, and the cold is cruel.
There's a thought – why don't we use the poor for fuel?
Stack them up like firewood, burn them in the street,
So when my love's in Knightsbridge she may warm her feet.


Slowed Down Blackbird


Alice Oswald
Blackbird fretting in the frozen hedge
In the first Slow-fall of the year when wind
Stuck in a Slow-drift lags behind
The twilight's trailing edge


Three inches underfoot
The Slow is settling Stillness is afloat
Last chorister holding the longest note
Lost in a Storm of Falling Slow he sings


As if engrossed by inward awkward things
The tick tick tick of leaves
Keeps losing time the Bleak Sky barely breathes
All evening long a Slow-cloud drips and grieves


Three inches underfoot
The Slow is settling Stillness is afloat
Last chorister holding the longest note
Lost in a Storm of Falling Slow he sings:


In the New Year the wind will blow
The world be shaken the shadows grow
But on this Slowy night nothing but Slow
Which if it lasts nothing will be but Now


Why Is the Mute Swan Singing?
Brian Patten
How calm the snow, how white it is,


How clear and pure the air,


How perfectly each little flake

Illuminates the atmosphere.

Why is the old fox smiling,
Trotting through the snow?
What is the rabbit dreaming
In the warren deep below?


Why is the mute swan singing?
Why is the wren so bold?
Why are the wild geese staying
And the spider weaving gold?


How calm the snow! how white it is!


How clear and pure the air!


How perfectly each little flake


Illuminates the atmosphere!


Why are the black crows cawing,
That were once so numb with cold?
From amongst the ice-flecked branches
What can they see unfold?


Why are they so excited
On such a winter's night?
And why is the stable glowing
With such translucent light?


The kingfisher shakes off rainbows,


The river stops mid-flow,


Buried in the owl's blood


Is something they all know.


Annunciation
after Fra Angelico


Robin Robertson
He has come from the garden, leaving
no shadow, no footprint in the dew.
She bows to him, slightly, arms
crossed over, shielding herself.
He bends one knee, folding his hands
below his chest, to mirror hers.
They hold each other's gaze
at the point of balance: everything
streaming towards this moment,
streaming away.


A word will set the seed
of life and death,
the over-shadowing of this girl
by a feathered dark.
But not yet: not quite yet.


How will she remember the silence
of that endless moment?
Or the end, when it all began – 
the first of seven joys
before the seven sorrows?
She will remember the aftersong 
because she is only human.
One day
she'll wake with wings, or wake
and find them gone


Grace at Christmas
Jean Sprackland
Not only for the way the whisky
flames in the glass and thaws the blood;
not only for the rattle of hailstones
down the chimney and doused by fire;
not just for the way the brand-new ring,
slipped cool on a finger, flushes with life;
or the warmth of the bed, and the warmth of another,
when streetlamps are spinning snow outside.


But also for the good, true cold,
shocking us back to all our senses:
the broken-off star of ice in the hand,
the sting of the wind and the quickening heart.
For the splintering light, and the frost in our voices,
striking, and making the strung air ring;
December cold with its wilder gifts –
for when are we more alive than now?


The Midwife's Carol
Michael Symmons Roberts


Deserts freeze and oceans glaze,
The polar sun turns blue,
Then on winter's whitened page
A single star prints through.


New-made maker, helpless king,


Born to joy and suffering,


Our rescuer, our child,


Our rescuer, our child.


I haul my catch into the world,
I shake him into breath,
His cry, so clear it splits the skies,
Could wake a man from death.


He cries for milk who gave it taste,
He aches for touch of skin,
Yet he spun every human hair,
And ushered love begin. 


I count his fingers, wipe

his eyes,
Then whisper in each ear.
I wrap him in my thickest shawl,
Bound tight to keep him here.


My hands have cradled many heads,
Cut countless cords and cauls,
But never held eternity
Within such fragile walls.


The maker of all worlds is made,
Infinity becalms,
From speed of light to feet of clay,
My saviour in my arms.


An Angel So Eager
Jeffrey Wainwright
An angel sang in a holly tree
A holly tree
Can you see?
An angel sang in a holly tree
On a cloudy Christmas morning.


I'm bored with heaven the angel sang
The angel sang
The garden rang
I'm bored with heaven the angel sang
Can I share your human Christmas?


I'll help you set the tree up straight
Then fly to the top
And shimmer atop
I'll help you set the tree up straight
And get those lights a-working.


I'll smile when I'm in the checkout queue
And take my cue
To say thanking you
I'll smile when I'm in the checkout queue
So the girl won't feel so weary.


I'll write all your Christmas cards
Christmas cards
Best regards
I'll write all your Christmas cards
And none shall be forgotten.


To each mall and square a choir I'll bring
A choir I'll bring
And how we'll sing
To each mall and square a choir I'll bring
And gently unplug the muzak.


All the arguments of who and where
Are they coming here?
Are we going there?
All the arguments of who and where
I'll charm away in a jiffy.


I'll peel the sprouts and baste the bird
Undeterred
Whatever the bird
I'll peel the sprouts and baste the bird
And set the pudding flaming.


I'll help the teens put up with it all
Put up with it all
Crackers and all
I'll help the teens put up with it all
So they can grin and bear it.


I'll take some soup and Christmas pie
Christmas pie
Best you can buy
I'll take some soup and Christmas pie
To those who're on their uppers.


I'll fold my wings on the tired child
The tearful child
The lonely child
I'll fold my wings on the tired child
So they'll sleep through till morning.


But Twelfth Night I must fly down
And leave your tree
And leave you be
The Twelfth Night I must fly down
And these are the words I'm leaving.


It's not so easy to live as you do
Live as you do
Live as you do
And that's why I'll come back to you
For you'll always need a Christmas.

Holly
(It's the female holly that bears the berries.)
Susan Wicks
November, and you see her everywhere,
a thousand eyes, a rush
of red in hedges. She's awake,
alight, a burning bush,
a burning bush.


December, and you cut her, bring her in.
You bind her to a wreath.
You twist and bend her tender branches
back until they meet,
until they meet.


Against the glass she shivers in the wind
till Christmas. She adorns
each house. Her satin ribbon lifts
and shreds itself on thorns,
itself on thorns.


On Christmas Day she stands on tiptoe twig
unwilting through the steam
while someone stoops to light a match
and pluck her from the flame,
her from the flame.


And then she's over, all her burning life
is shrivelled, berries dry
as clotted blood, her leaves like knives.
So clear her all away,
her all away.


Her sisters, softer now with frost and rain,
feed birds between the trees
and wait for creamy blossom, sun,
the buzzing of the bees,
zing of the bees.


Carol
Kit Wright
When Man Anthropomorphic
 Gave all the creatures speech,
And Music-makers Orphic
 Enchantment lent to each,
They made a game of magic
 Within their children's reach.


It seemed the human thing to do:


 They never thought that it was true.


And when the catastrophic
 Obtruded on their days,
They shaped a philosophic
 Account for their malaise:
They harmonised the tragic
 In lots of different ways.


It seemed the human thing to do:


They never thought that it was true.


And when they sought exemption
 From Death's unswerving law,
As agent of redemption
 They laid a child in straw,
The son of their Oppressor,
 To cherish and adore. 


It seemed the human thing to do:


They never thought that it was true.


But when the world about them
 Filled with such whopping lies
They could not fail to doubt them,
 They found, to their surprise,
The tale of their Redresser,
 They viewed with different eyes.


Compared to all the other stuff,


The tale was more than true enough.
