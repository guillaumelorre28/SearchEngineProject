It's been punned that one day the geeks will inherit the earth, but 
self-starter Greg Ginn wasn't the sort to wait for it to be handed to him. The 
guitarist in punk rock group Panic, Ginn also operated his own radio parts 
company, Solid State Transmitters, out of his parents' house in Californian 
suburb Hermosa Beach. In January 1978, Panic had recorded their debut EP, 
Nervous Breakdown (a session financed by revenues from Ginn's company), with LA 
indie label Bomp! offering to release it. But when money troubles at Bomp! 
delayed the release by 18 months – during which time Panic renamed themselves 
Black Flag – Ginn paid $2,000 to have a thousand copies of the EP pressed up on 
his own new label, SST Records.

SST would release all Black Flag's records until their split in 1986, but it 
was no mere vanity label. Key albums by luminaries of the 1980s American 
hardcore and underground rock scenes were released on SST, including the 
Minutemen, Hüsker Dü, Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth andDinosaur Jr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dinosaurjr>. Some bands grumbled about the 
label's non-existent accounting – they would sell tens of thousands of records 
and barely see a dollar – and quit SST, but its importance to the US 
alternative rock scene is unquestioned. Indeed, the label's impressive 
catalogue is held in such esteem that transistor gear produced by Ginn's Solid 
State Transmitters in the 1970s – stamped with the same logo found on every SST 
album – is now fiercely sought after by collectors on eBay.
