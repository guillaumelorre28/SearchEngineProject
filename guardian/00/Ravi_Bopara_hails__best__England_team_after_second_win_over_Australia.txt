Ravi Bopara is playing his best cricket and so are England, according to the 
batsman. "I think this is probably the best side we've ever had," he said.

"The bowlers are performing really well, putting pressure on 
[opposition]batsmen – and then there's always someone in the top six [for us] 
that goes on and gets a big score.

"The amount of hundreds we've scored in the last however many games has been 
incredible."

Bopara was pretty pleased with his own performance too. "I enjoyed myself out 
there," he said. "I told myself just to watch the ball, and hit it, and I play 
my best when I do that. I think I'm batting the best I ever have. A few changes 
that I've made over these last six months have really worked for me."

The captain, Alastair Cook, gave his Essex and England team-mate due credit 
but was even more impressed with his bowlers – albeit on a pitch which was not 
quite as good for batting as he first expected.

"There was a little bit of nibble in that wicket, which was pretty much there 
all game," he said. "There was a little bit in it for the bowlers – probably a 
little more than we thought.

"But where we were really quite strong today was when Swanny [Graeme Swann] 
came on. We squeezed really, really well – with a few overs from Ravi as well.

"From 20 to 35 overs we did that really well, picked up the odd wicket and 
never really allowed them to get that momentum going to get a big score.

"At The Oval 250 is always gettable. We chased 230 against West Indies and 
tried to stick to that same platform – and it was another really solid batting 
performance."
