The 2013 Nobel Prize for literature 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/10/alice-munro-wins-nobel-prize-in-literature>
 has gone to Alice Munro, described by the academy as a 'master of the 
contemporary short story.'

The author first came to the attention of the Guardian in 1973, when her 
episodic novel Lives of Girls and Women was published in the UK.

In 1980 Munro was shortlisted for the Booker Prize

 (then the Booker McConnell). In the event she was pipped to the award by 
William Golding (who alsosomewhat controversially beat Anthony Burgess

), but the nomination put her on the literary map.

Claire Tomalin, reviewing The Progress of Love in the Observer in 1987, 
described Munro's work as 'an exploration of those weathers and distances, 
those landscapes that shift from the known to the almost unimaginable.'

In an Observer interview later that year, Munro told Janet Watts, "I don't 
write out of any decision to be literary. An enormous amount offaith goes into 
writing fiction - I mean, why do it at all? It's a celebratory thing to do 
about human life."

She may not have written with the distinct aim of being 'literary', but in 
winning the Nobel Prize Munro has been recognised for just that.
