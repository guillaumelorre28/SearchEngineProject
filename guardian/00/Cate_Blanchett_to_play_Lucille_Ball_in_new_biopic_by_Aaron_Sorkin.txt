Cate Blanchett <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett> is hotly 
tipped to win an Oscar for playing the fictional 1950s heroine of Todd Haynes’s 
film Carol, but her next role could be one of the real life stars of the 
period: Lucille Ball.

The Australian actor is set to play the American TV sweetheart in a new biopic 
written by Aaron Sorkin of The West Wing and The Social Network, reportsthe Wrap

.

The film will cover Ball’s 20-year marriage to Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz, 
who also played her husband in I Love Lucy, the first show of its kind to be 
filmed in front of a live audience.

Ball won four Emmys as a performer and went on to become one of Hollywood’s 
first female TV executives when she founded the studio Desilu, which produced 
the original Mission: Impossible and Star Trek series.

Blanchett is no stranger to biopics, winning her first Academy award for her 
turn as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator.

Audiences will next see her as journalist Mary Mapes in Truth, a newsroom 
drama about the controversial 2004 CBS report investigating George W Bush’s 
military service. Blanchett also recently completed films with directors Julian 
Rosefeldt and Terrence Malick.

The Lucille Ball project has the blessing of Ball and Arnaz’s children, Lucie 
Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr, who will produce the project with Escape Artists, the 
company behind the Jake Gyllenhaal drama Southpaw and The Equalizer, starring 
Denzel Washington.

While there was no confirmation from either Blanchett or Sorkin’s camps about 
the film, Blanchett’s husband, theatre director Andrew Upton, confirmed to 
Guardian Australia “they have been talking about it for a while”.

“It’s a project that is dear to [Cate’s] heart and a great story to tell,” he 
said at a theatre event in Sydney on Thursday.
