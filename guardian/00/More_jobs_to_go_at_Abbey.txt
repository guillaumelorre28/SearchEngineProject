Abbey National yesterday warned that up to 2,000 jobs are to be shed this 
year, on top of the 4,000 which have gone since the takeover byBanco Santander 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/santander> 15 months ago. News of the 
planned job cuts came as Abbey announced it had turned pre-tax losses of £21m 
in 2004 into profits of £596m in 2005.

Francisco Gómez-Roldán, Abbey's chief executive, said: "We are on track in our 
efforts to turn Abbey around." But there were still "many challenges to 
overcome," and between 1,000 and 2,000 jobs would go this year as the bank 
continues to chip away at costs. A spokesman said the bulk of jobs going would 
be "back office" posts.

When Santander took over Abbey in November 2004, the British bank employed 
24,500 staff. By the end of last year that number had fallen to 20,500. The 
cuts helped deliver savings of £224m - well up on initial expectations of £100m.

Trading profits before tax, which strip out the costs of restructuring the 
business under Santander, leapt 34% to £775m.

Mr Gómez-Roldán said the bank had exceeded targets set for 2005. "We've made a 
good start towards achieving our three year turnaround and long term goal of 
becoming the best retail bank in the UK."

Gross mortgage lending rose 10% to £27.6bn, while retail deposits were up 4% 
on 2004. There was a "slight rise" in mortgage arrears and home repossessions, 
and some deterioration in arrears on the bank's unsecured lending book. Abbey 
said that in overall terms "the balance sheet remains strong".
