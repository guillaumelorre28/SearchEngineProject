The new film follows a young couple whose romance suddenly turns violent when 
a benign man gradually becomes vicious and intransigent.“As in my previous 
films, Forushande addresses how social challenges can propel the downfall of 
some people,”Farhadi told Variety

.

Forushande took the film-maker back to Tehran, where the terse drama of A 
Separation also played out. Like his best-known film, the contemporary-set 
project will once again weave Iranian social, political and moral themes into 
its main narrative. Farhadi’s most recent drama, 2013’s The Past, was set in 
Paris.

Forushande is being set up at Arte France Cinema, Memento Films Productions 
and the director’s own Farhadi Film Production. No cast or prospective release 
details have been reported.
