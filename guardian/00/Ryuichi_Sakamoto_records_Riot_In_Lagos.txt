An otherworldly instrumental that sounds like it's constantly on the edge of 
falling apart, former Yellow Magic Orchestra star Ryuichi Sakamoto's single 
(recorded in 1980 for his B-2 Unit solo album, and released on a 12-inch in 
1983) is one of those oddities that early electronica produced out of nowhere â€“ 
much like Gary Numan's Cars in 1979. It was very much doing its own thing, but 
somehow contained by the new boundaries of dance music.
