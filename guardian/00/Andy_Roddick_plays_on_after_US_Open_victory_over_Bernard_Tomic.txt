A day after announcing that he will retire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/31/andy-roddick-retires-us-open> at 
the end of this year's US Open, Andy Roddick crushed Australian Bernard Tomic 
to reach the third round.

Roared on by an emotional New York crowd, the American beat Tomic 6-3 6-4 6-0. 
The match took just one hour and 27 minutes at Flushing Meadows and guarantees 
Roddick at least one more match. Afterwards the crowd chanted "One more year, 
one more year" for the player who has been the biggest star of US men's tennis 
for several years.

Australian teenager Tomic never really got into his stride and made 27 
unforced errors.

The 30-year-old Roddick, a former world number one and 2003 US Open champion, 
will next play unseeded Italian Fabio Fognini.

Defending champion Novak Djokovic needed only 99 minutes to win and didn't 
face a single break point as he beat Rogerio Dutra Silva on Friday, breezing 
into the third round.

As Djokovic blasted past the Brazilian, two other former champions also 
advanced: Juan Martin del Potro and Lleyton Hewitt.

Del Potro downed Ryan Harrison of the United States, 6-2, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 while 
Hewitt who is playing on a wild card due to his low ranking showed his 
trademark grit to outlast Gilles Muller of Luxembourg, 3-6, 7-6, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4.
