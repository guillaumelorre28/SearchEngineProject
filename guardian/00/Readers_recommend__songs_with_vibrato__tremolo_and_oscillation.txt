A tiny female figure stands in huge, cavernous church in winter, the neck of 
her electric guitar pointing to the ceiling. Behind her, silently poised, is an 
ensemble of string players and a choir. The lights are low, and flickering 
slightly, her shadow is cast into a vast, ghostly giant on a far wall. A packed 
audience holds its breath. She inhales, opens her lips, and the first vowel, 
rich and voluminous, emanates, growing, filling the space, building to the end 
of line at the end of which her larynx climbs to full throttle. The volume and 
power seems astonishing, and the first long, held note begins to ripple. It has 
an expressiveness that sends shivers up spines. Then with the first full 
flourish of arm, her hand strokes the strings in a circular movement as if 
skimming across a harp, and a rich twang vibrates with a warmth of resonant 
sustain.


Anna Calvi <https://www.theguardian.com/music/anna-calvi>, an artist I saw 
perform only last week, is an unusual hybrid. A classically trained violinist, 
she is not only a surprisingly powerful singer and very gifted guitarist – 
rarely do the two come together – but also combines effects in voice and 
playing that capture particular expressivity in vibrato and tremelo. Adopting a 
dramatic persona and flamenco-style look (behind which is a tiny, meek speaking 
voice) and using a jangly-sounding Vox AC30 amp, tremelo effects and a Fender 
Telecaster, Calvi exemplifies qualities variously found in many artists and 
songs across numerous genres, all of which fall under this topic – oscillation 
in its many glorious forms.


So this week it is all about sounds that move, as opposed to those played with 
straight, unbending or unaltered notes or chords. We may feature high-pitched 
warbles, medium wobbles and or deep bass shudders – from vocal delivery or 
instruments from rumbling, rattling, organ sounds to guitar techniques or 
effects. But the important thing is that the oscillation must work well and 
feature prominently in that song.

Let’s look at the detail. Vibrato is defined as subtle variations of pitch (to 
slightly higher or lower frequency notes), or can also be the speed of that 
variation. This is often confused with tremelo, which strictly speaking is 
subtle changes of volume, not pitch. Tremelo arms on guitars from the old 
Kauffman Vibrola on models such as a 1930s Rickenbacher, to the popular Bigsby 
tremelo, seen on Gretsch guitars or other makes, actually change the pitch of 
the strings, so they are actually creating a from of vibrato.

Guitarists also produce changes in sound by bending strings, moving a slide 
bottleneck, or using a wah-wah pedal, or other effects to change frequency and 
volume. Funk players or surf style are a good example. The many artists could 
inclue Jimi Hendrix, JImmy Page, Prince, Steve Miller, the tremelo bends of 
Duane Eddy, Keith Richards, or Dan Auerbach from the Black Keys. It could 
include the blurry, dreamy innovation of Kevin Shields fromMy Bloody Valentine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/my-bloody-valentine>. They all count. The 
key element is that songs must modulate their notes or chords with 
effectiveness, innovation and expression.

A tremolo or tremolando can also be the rapid repetition of the same note, 
most clearly shown by a roll on the drums. On other instruments this can sound 
like modulation and is easily recreated on synthesisers and software. A trill, 
meanwhile, is the rapid alternation between two very close notes. That is also 
in the frame this week, because of the modulatory effect in a song or other 
musical piece. String players often play trills, but as they mature they 
naturally discover and achieve even more expression by wobbling their finger 
when pressing down on strings. A music teacher at school once told me how he 
noticed children naturally adopting the wobble finger technique on violins and 
cellos and upright basses, almost always as if like clockwork, half way through 
the fourth year of lessons. The cellist Jacqueline du Pré, who died tragically 
young, was a player whose finger vibrato was incredibly moving.

Organs and synthesisers perhaps present the best examples of manufactured 
oscillation. The Hammond and Moog are the most famous examples, built to 
modulate pitch to create that rich, shuddery sound. A rich vein of organ music 
traversed into pop in the 60s and 70s. Organs may also come up in a future 
topic, but in this one, it’s all about the oscillation. In church organs, a 
similar effect is created by creating mechanical changes in airflow, and 
players of wind instruments can achieve a similar result by controlling it with 
their diaphragm. In the case of brass instruments, this is also done by subtle 
movements with the lips or moving the instrument with the hand.

What of vibrato in the voice? Singers change learn to modify pitch or volume, 
or both. Sometimes it is entirely natural, and they cannot control it, but when 
it works well, it can have a profound effect. When I first heard opera singers 
as a child I thought the stylistic warble slightly laughable. You could argue 
that big stars such asBeyoncé <https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce>, 
Maria Carey or Whitney Houston put on a forced vibrato, but is this brilliantly 
skilful or over-stylised? But in the soul genre or others, when is vibrato used 
well, and in what songs? Now is the time to name examples and discuss in 
comments.

Vocal vibrato is especially interesting, because it is often untrained. Some 
singers are naturally stylish this way, their sound a bit like the delivery of 
a cricketer who naturally finds swing or spin, or a footballer who bends a free 
kick or an actor or comedian whose voice somehow delivers a line that sparkles 
and sings. I’ve dabbled in all of these activities. But my own equivalent is of 
a tendency to sound gently mocking or ironic even when speaking with entire 
sincerity. It just comes out that way. I’m not sure it’s a talent, as such. 
There seems to be something in my tone of voice that can bring a lot of fun for 
those who get it, or alternatively causes misunderstanding and trouble.

Vibrato can also arguably break down the artificial ridges of formal notes (or 
frequency) divisions imposed by western music, and allow more freedom to roam 
in the intricate variations in between found in Chinese, Arabic or other forms. 
The unusual harmonies and half-notes of Bulgarian female choirs are an example 
of these divisions bridging different cultures.
But why do pitch changes, subtle or otherwise, catch our attention and move 
us? Perhaps it is because there is a physical element to it. So let’s watch how 
this happens when expressed by grains of sand. There are complex scientific 
reasons, but to me it’s shapeshifting magic.

 Upside down you’re turning me. Sine waves and water. 
Does that alter and move you? What is your wavelength? Not sure what is a 
vibrato and what isn’t? In lyrics, your song choices also reflect rapid changes 
in emotions or other forms of oscillation. While the topic is mostly about 
sound, flitting and flickering in a bigger sense may also be worth a shout, 
where form matches subject matter.

Overall this is a big subject that should travel across many in genres and 
cultures, but it’s a two-week Christmas special with extra time to build a 
musical mountain and a vast, flowing river of songs. Therefore dig deep in your 
metaphorical Christmas sacks and present an oscillating array of riches to the 
returning yuletide guest guru, magicman, in comments and optionally in the 
Spotify playlist bylunchtime last orders (2pm) Monday 29 December for his 
special selection published onThursday 1 January 2015. 

Finally, thank you all once again for another outstanding 12 months of wit, 
wisdom, knowledge and friendship. Readers Recommend truly rocks. Have a very 
merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
