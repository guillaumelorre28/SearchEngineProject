Christmas is for giving and all that jazz – I get that, truly I do. But when 
everyone else is suitably taken care of in the present department, who deserves 
that final gift of the festive season bestowed on them? You, that's who. Time 
seems to get shorter, life is getting tougher and luxuries are all but cast 
aside. Which is why I implore you to congratulate yourself for making it 
through the year by treating yourself to something lovely. Here are the beauty 
products that truly stood out for me this year.

1. Shiseido Ibuki Purifying Cleanser, £29, feelunique.com

 Shiseido Ibuki Purifying Cleanser, £29 
This deep-cleansing wash lathers up into the softest, richest foam I've ever 
encountered. A tiny blob covers your entire face. The Ibuki range (I'm an 
unashamed convert, I use it all) is aimed at keeping your skin in its happy 
state by warding off UV rays, pollution and stress, which can trigger breakouts 
and skin damage. Essentially, it's the best cleanser I've tried. That's not a 
judgement I make lightly.

2. Argentum Apothecary La Potion Infinie, £147, argentumapothecary.co.uk

 Argentum Apothecary La Potion Infinie, £147 
This is a costly buy – I realise that – and a big, big investment. But having 
stumbled across this 99.5% naturally derived face cream from this niche brand, 
I really have to extoll its virtues. It uses silver hydrosol, an antibacterial 
that quells any build-up of bacteria. Its plumping effects are apparent 
immediately, and it leaves your skin petal-soft and balanced from its first 
use. It is definitely one for the skincare obsessives, but for a slightly 
cheaper option try Shiseido's Ibuki Refining Moisturiser, £42 (from the range 
above), which is similarly brilliant.

3. Bobbi Brown Old Hollywood Eye Palette, £59, bobbibrown.co.uk 
<http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/product/2300/27082/Gifts/Sets-Palettes/Makeup-Palettes-Sets/Old-Hollywood-Eye-Palette/Limited-Collection/index.tmpl>
 Bobbi Brown Old Hollywood Eye Palette, £59 
Eye palettes can be a bit of a write-off when it comes to darker skins. We 
plough through the browns and blacks leaving the paler, silvery shades barely 
touched. This limited-edition eye palette from Bobbi Brown – the queen of 
flattering nudes – contains nine shades that I guarantee you'll use. It has the 
perfect colours for smokey eyes, a contoured 1940s look and a nude eye. The 
matte ivory shade is ideal for highlighting under the brow bone, and it gives a 
more modern finish rather than a pearly or metallic shade. Buy this, and your 
quest for the ultimate palette is over. (Also, I've dropped it twice and mine 
still hasn't shattered – huge win.) For cheaper palettes that suit darker 
skins, try Sleek's Au Naturel I-Divine Palette, £7.99,superdrug.com 
<http://www.superdrug.com/sleek-makeup/sleek-i-divine-eye-shadow-au-naturel/invt/228225>
. (Thiswill break if you drop it – I speak from experience.)

4. & other Stories Face Contour Cream, £10, stories.com

 & other Stories Face Contour Cream, £10 
So few of us with darker skins are one single skin tone – we have a variety of 
subtle nuances of colour. That's why, when we apply foundation (especially 
long-wear or matte foundations), the colour can look a little flat and 
one-dimensional. This dark-brown translucent cream (which suits all skin tones, 
but works especially well on darker ones) can be applied just below the 
cheekbones starting at the hairline, or just under the apples of the cheeks and 
blended in well to create depth to the cheeks and face. If you've tried to 
contour before – which is no easy task – then this is your new best friend.

5. Clinique Chubby Stick Intense Moisturizing Lip Colour Balm, £17, 
clinique.co.uk 
<http://www.clinique.co.uk/product/1603/24146/Makeup/Lip-Glosses/NEW-Chubby-Stick-Intense-Moisturizing-Lip-Colour-Balm/index.tmpl>
 Clinique Chubby Stick Intense Moisturizing Lip Colour Balm, £17 
Of all the pointless, ineffective beauty products I loathe the most, tinted 
lip balm ranks as one of the highest. It's a personal thing; I adore thick 
ultra-matte lipsticks, but anything that's "barely there" just feels defunct. 
Then, I tried this little guy and my preconceptions were shattered. The texture 
is perfect; somewhere between a satin lipstick and a waxy balm. The giant 
pencil shape makes it easy to apply to lips, cheeks and eyes (that's how I use 
it post-gym with no other makeup. Try it, it works.) And this light pink-mauve 
shade is perfect; it's the ideal "natural" pink that suits darker lips. It has 
become a handbag staple – I never thought I'd say that.
