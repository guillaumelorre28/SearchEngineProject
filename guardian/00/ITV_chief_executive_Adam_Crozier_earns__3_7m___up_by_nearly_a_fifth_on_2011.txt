ITV chief executive Adam Crozier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-crozier> was awarded £3.7m in cash and 
share awards last year, almost 20% more than he took home in 2011.

Crozier received £2.25m in cash and pension contributions, including a bonus 
of £1.34m, on a base salary of £818,000.

ITV's annual report said that he had achieved 91.33% of his maximum potential 
bonus, with £897,000 paid in cash and £448,000 compulsorily turned into stock 
under ITV's deferred share award scheme.

Crozier also received 1,137,904 shares under ITV's long-term performance award 
scheme, worth just under £1.5m at the broadcaster's current share price of 
130p. The shares do not vest until 2015 and 2016.

Overall, Crozier took home pay and was awarded shares worth a total of £3.7m 
in 2012, off the back of a strong performance which sawITV deliver a 6% rise in 
pre-tax profits <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/27/itv-profits-rise>
 and 13% boost in earnings .

This compares to the £3.1m total pay and share package he took home in 2011  
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/29/itv-adam-crozier-pay-annual-report>
.

On top of his bumper pay ITV's remuneration committee awarded a 2.75% increase 
to his base salary from 1 January, taking his pay to £840,706.

Crozier also received £35,000 as a non-executive director of retail store 
Debenhams, a position he resigned on 1 September last year.

He also holds 298,258 shares in ITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> 
in a personal capacity, worth £387,735 at ITV's current share price of 130p, as 
at 31 December 2012.

Crozier has a long way to go to reach the terms of his contract which state 
that he must hold 200% of his base salary in ITV shares within five years of 
his appointment "to align [Crozier's] interests with other shareholders".

At 1 January this year his personal shareholding was equivalent to just 62% of 
his base salary.

Archie Norman <https://www.theguardian.com/media/archie-norman>, the ITV 
chairman, received a total remuneration of just over £720,000 in 2012.

On top of his salary of £300,000 he took home £420,893 from the vesting of 
400,000 shares. When Norman joined in March 2010 he was awarded 1.2m shares as 
a one-off "golden hello". This is the final tranche of those shares to vest.

Norman was reappointed for a further three-year term from 1 January 2013, 
given an annual fee of £500,000, £200,000 of which is invested in stock under 
ITV's share acquisition strategy for senior executives.

ITV's annual report said that all staff earning under £60,000 received a pay 
rise of 2.75% for 2013, those above that amount received an increase in line 
with how they performed – or didn't – in 2012.
