Hello guzzlers,

To celebrate Andy Murray’s triumph at Queen’s yesterday, and in anticipation of
Wimbledon, <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> which starts next 
week, lets smash some neurons around the grass court of your brains.

 * The men’s (and women’s) singles event at Wimbledon is a knockout tournament 
with 128 players. Without doing any arithmetic - i.e adding up the number of 
matches in every round - can you work out how many matches are there in total?

 * What is the minimum number of times you need to hit the ball with your 
racket in order to win a set? 
 * Goode, who is a good tennis player, and Poor, who isn’t, will take turns as 
your opponent over three sets of tennis. The order for sets 1-2-3 will be 
either Goode-Poor-Goode, or Poor-Goode-Poor? Which order of opponent do you 
choose to maximise your chances of winning two sets in a row? 
I’ll post the answers at 5pm BST today

I post a puzzle here on a Monday every two weeks. If you are reading this on 
the Guardian app, click where it says ‘Follow Alex Bellos’ and you’ll get an 
alert when the solutions are posted and when the next puzzle appears.
