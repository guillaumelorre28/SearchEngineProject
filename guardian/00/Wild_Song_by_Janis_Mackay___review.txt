I would give this book 6/10. This story is about a boy who is sent to a wild 
school on an island and hates it!

The boy is terrified of water, but in an attempt to escape the island, he has 
to learn how to swim and in doing so he makes friends with seal who looks after 
him.

This is a story about friendship and nature. This is a sad story with a happy 
ending.

I liked this book and would recommend it to kids aged 7-11.
