This site was built to enable people to read the Guardian on the move on 
modern mobile phones, even in poor signal areas.

This site demonstrates the power of combining the Guardian's services. Using 
the RSS feeds together with the Open Platform we were able to create a 
mobile-friendly site which obeys the ordering of the RSS feed and uses the data 
provided by Open Platform.
