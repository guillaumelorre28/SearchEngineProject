San Andreas <https://www.theguardian.com/film/san-andreas>, which stars Dwayne 
Johnson and Carla Gugino in a story about a massive earthquake on the titular 
Californian fault line, received mixed reviews from critics, but was helped by 
Johnson’s star power in the wake of box-office megalith Fast and Furious 7. It 
was the former wrestler’s best ever opening for a movie in which he is the lead.

San Andreas performed particularly well in areas of California which are 
positioned on or near the fault line. Nineteen of the top 20 returning cinemas 
in North America were in the San Francisco Bay Area or greater Los Angeles,
according to the Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-san-andreas-spikes-799017>.

The musical comedy sequel Pitch Perfect 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/pitch-perfect-2> held on to second place with 
another $14.8m in its third week, for a total of $147.5m. But the George 
Clooney-led futuristic fantasy Tomorrowland dropped from first to third, with a 
return of just $13.8m. The big-budget Disney epic, which cost a reported $180m 
to produce, remains well short of the $100m mark, at just $63.1m, going into 
its third week.

The top five was rounded out by enduring post-apocalyptic action reboot Mad 
Max: Fury Road, which earned $13.6m in its third week, for a total of $115.9m, 
and the superhero sequel TheAvengers: Age of Ultron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/avengers-the-age-of-ultron>, with a 
fifth-week total of $10.9m and a total of $427m in North America alone.

Producers of Aloha were doing their best to play up the film’s performance, 
despite its low opening chart position. Crowe’s previous movie, We Bought a 
Zoo, made $9.3m over Christmas weekend in 2011, and went on to make a 
reasonable $120m worldwide. But the Hawaii-set romanceAloha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/aloha>, which features A-list stars Emma 
Stone, Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdams, opened during a month of 
traditionally stronger box office returns.

“We’re happy with our opening,” Sony distribution chief Rory Brue told the 
Hollywood Reporter. “It opened within the realm of our expectations and is a 
movie we’re proud of. Cameron Crowe always seems to touch upon that human 
element that makes people think and laugh, and the all-star cast is terrific. 
We believe the film will be around for many, many weeks to come.”
