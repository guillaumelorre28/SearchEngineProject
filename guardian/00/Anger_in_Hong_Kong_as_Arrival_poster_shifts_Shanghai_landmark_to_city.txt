A Shanghai landmark has become part of Hong Kong’s skyline – at least in a 
poster for an forthcoming Hollywood movie.

The misplacement, transplanting the Oriental Pearl tower from the Chinese city 
to Hong Kong’s Victoria harbour, has sparked anger among Hong Kongers, some of 
whom read a political message behind it.

Many Facebook users employing the hashtag #HongKongIsNotChina expressed their 
ire at the error on the film’sofficial page 
<https://www.facebook.com/ArrivalMovie/>, despite Paramount swiftly apologising 
for the error and deleting the poster.

An error was made in an "Arrival" poster by a 3rd party vendor. It's been 
corrected and we are disappointed we didn't catch the error.

The studio blamed a third-party vendor who had created the poster, leading 
some Facebook users to intimate that the vendor was likely pushing their own 
political agenda, rather than being sloppy on Photoshop.

The poster was one of 12 released this week by the company depicting various 
landmarks with the tagline: “Why are they here?” The film starsAmy Adams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy-adams> as a linguist trying to 
communicate with aliens, following their invasion of Earth. It premieres at 
this year’s Venice film festival.
