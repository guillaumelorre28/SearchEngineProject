As Alfred Brendel turns his attention from concert-giving to inspiring the 
prodigious young pianist Kit Armstrong 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/02/alfred-brendel-kit-armstrong>, 
it's worth reminding ourselves why Brendel's own playing has been so 
influential for generations of pianists and music-lovers. The meta-music-brain 
of YouTube has some gems out there, which I've filtered for your perusal to 
come up with a handful of clips of the highways and byways of Brendeliana:

To start with, here's one of the undoubted classics of the gramophone, 
Brendel's recording ofSchubert's Drei Klavierstucke, D946 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5NxSl-XFo8>. These three pieces belong to the 
visionary realms of Schubert's last works for piano; less celebrated than the 
late sonatas, Brendel's combination of clarity and sensuality brilliantly 
illuminates Schubert's music.

Brendel's Schubert has long been the stuff of legend, but his Liszt is more 
controversial. Here's his1981 recording of Liszt's B Minor Sonata 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uPReUM13Rs&feature=fvsr>, a performance of 
fire and flamboyance that scotches the image of Brendel as a cold-blooded 
intellectual.

As does this video of a performance of Liszt's Second Piano Concerto with the 
Frankfurt Radio Symphony 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y_9oRrJLS0&feature=related>, in which 
Brendel's zany hair-do, eccentric mannerisms, andtruly astonishing resemblance 
to Eric Morecambe <http://www.art247.com/images/large/MIRRORPIX/WA/WA493604.jpg>
 are all gloriously in evidence.

Another performance that shows the wild side to Brendel is this live 1995 
concert of Beethoven's last piano sonata, Op 111 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkY242Ya_lY&feature=related>, from Suntory Hall 
in Tokyo. Brendel, and Beethoven, unleashed.

It's the same with this recording of Haydn 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XPJPgAmR0>, and his last sonata: a 
performance that does full justice to Brendel's vision of the Viennese 
classical style as a place to relish all the humour, pathos, and profundity of 
the human experience.

Even that Haydn isn't as funny as this, though: a shred-ded version of Brendel 
playingBeethoven's Bagatelles, Op. 126 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s4ghHARXR8&playnext=1&list=PLF6415199D740D03B>
. The brilliance of YouTuber osukaro's video is how close his ventriloquised 
piano-part stays to Brendel's and Beethoven's original, creating an improvised 
fantasy that remains tantalisingly, hilariously, close to the original (which 
you can watchhere <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILbhPUe8LE&feature=fvsr>). 
Brendel, literary and pianistic master of themusical absurd 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Finger-Many-Alfred-Brendel/dp/0571196187>, would, 
I hope, approve.
