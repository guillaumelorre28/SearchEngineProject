Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> had his 
lead trimmed as Edvald Boasson Hagen won stage four of the Critérium du 
Dauphiné on Thursday.

Spain’s Contador (Tinkoff) was caught the wrong side of a split in the peloton 
caused by a late crash and the defending champion,Chris Froome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> (Team Sky), was the main 
beneficiary.

Froome moved four seconds behind Contador, leapfrogging Richie Porte, who was 
also caught out and remains six seconds adrift.

Contador was disgruntled over the lack of application of the 3km rule, where 
the race is neutralised for riders caught in crashes in the latter stages.

“The truth is that losing nine seconds don’t bother me,” Contador said. “What 
bothers me more is whether or not the rule of the last three kilometres gets 
applied. The split on the finishing line was due to a crash. I don’t think the 
finales are more nervous here than at other World Tour races.”

Norway’s Boasson Hagen (Dimension Data) outsprinted the Frenchmen Julian 
Alaphilippe (Etixx-QuickStep) and Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis) to win the 176-km 
stage from Tain-l’Hermitage to Belley.

The race now heads for the mountains, with three challenging stages for 
Froome, Contador and others to show their form before theTour de France, which 
begins on 2 July
