Rave music ceased being an underground movement in the early 90s as the charts 
filled with songs containing blatant drug and club references, from Sesame's 
Treet by Smart E's to the Shamen's Ebeneezer Goode ("Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode – 
he's Ebeneezer Goode"). Did these acts cheapen the genre? As Mixmag asked at 
the time, did the Prodigy's  Charly kill rave? The band didn't think so. Their 
frontman Liam Howlett reacted angrily when Mixmag accused him of crimes against 
musical credibility on its August 1992 cover (which also featured a photo of 
Howlett holding a gun to his head). Nonetheless, artists such as Altern-8 
created an absurdist world of face masks and chemical warfare suits. Moral: if 
you want good taste, go to an art gallery.
