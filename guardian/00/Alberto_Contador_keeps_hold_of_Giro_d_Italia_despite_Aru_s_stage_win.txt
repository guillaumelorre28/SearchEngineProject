Barring a crash in Sunday’s final stage, Alberto Contador 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> is poised to win the Giro 
d’Italia after the Spaniard limited the damage on the 20th stage, a punishing 
199km trek from Saint-Vincent to Sestriere. The Tinkoff-Saxo rider, who won the 
race in 2008, lost touch with his main rivals in the penultimate climb, up the 
narrow dirt roads to the Colle delle Finestre, but retained the overall 
leader’s pink jersey.

At the end of the final ascent to Sestriere, Contador was sixth, 2min 26sec 
behind Fabio Aru of Italy, who is second overall, 2min 2sec behind with only 
one flat stage left to Milan. Aru jumped away from a small leading group with 
just under two kilometres left and did not look back, claiming his second 
straight stage win, after Friday’s success in Breuil-Cervinia.

The Canadian Ryder Hesjedal, of Cannondale-Garmin, was second, 18 seconds 
behind, and Colombia’s Rigoberto Urán finished third, 24 seconds off the pace. 
Spain’s Mikel Landa, Aru’s Astana team-mate who looked the strongest rider in 
the climb to Colle delle Finestre, remained third overall, 3:14 behind Contador.

Contador is looking to become the first rider to achieve a rare Giro/Tour de 
France double since the late Marco Pantani in 1998.
