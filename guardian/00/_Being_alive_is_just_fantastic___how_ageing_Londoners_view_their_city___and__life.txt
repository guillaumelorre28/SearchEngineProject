“I’ve always been too honest. My mother used to say to me: ‘Darling, it 
doesn’t matter if you say a little lie.’ But I can’t help it, I’m very 
straightforward, very square, and sometimes I say too much ... which makes me 
think it’s better to be alone, because sometimes I can really put my foot in it 
with my truth.”

David: “We’re both Kiwis with Scottish ancestry, and we’re both ordained 
priests now, too. The third time we met I spent hours chatting her up. It took 
me until five in the morning to get her to agree to marry me!”

Loma: “You’ve got to take a little time to think about something like that, 
haven’t you? We just fell head over heels in love, but first he had to be 
ordained and I had to finish my nursing training, so we ended up being engaged 
for 18 months, which was very hard because we both really wanted to have sex!’

David: “In those days, the 60s, we Christians didn’t believe in sex before 
marriage – and she is pretty desirable.”

“I’m so surprised I’ve made it to 86. Sometimes I can’t even remember my own 
name, but I live alone so that doesn’t matter too much. I do always remember 
where I live though, which is a good thing. I fell over and banged my head five 
years ago; I think it dates from then.”

“I didn’t realise until I got into my 60s how amazing being alive is. I’ve had 
a couple of very close friends who’ve passed away and you realise that, shit 
man, being alive is just fantastic. You discover the value of simple things. 
Simply walking is really marvellous. The colour, the noises ... everything is 
great. Every instance, every event becomes an experience, something to savour.”

“My mother had 14 children but she didn’t have time to take care of us – she 
was too busy trying to find a husband – so my grandparents brought me up. Then, 
one day, while I was working as a drayman for Truman’s Brewery, my grandmother 
died of a heart attack right in front of me, and I went into shock. I 
disappeared for four days, just wandering about. Eventually the police found me 
and took me to Hackney hospital, but then I cut my wrists; I wanted to die 
because my grandmother was dead.


Frances was a lovely girl, but I think being married to one of the Krays had 
made her a little crazy

“The woman in the next bed was Reggie Kray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/03/the-selling-of-the-krays-how-two-mediocre-criminals-created-their-own-legendlegends>
’s wife Frances (it was a mixed ward). She was a lovely girl, but I think being 
married to one of the Krays had made her a little crazy. She would often tell 
me: ‘Think twice before you do anything.’ We were together for 16 weeks. She 
needed some company and I took care of her and dressed up smart for her, but I 
was born and brought up in the East End so I knew I needed to stay out of her 
husband’s way. Then she went home and, almost immediately, she died of an 
overdose. I couldn’t believe it.

“But you know what? That second shock made me better – it snapped me back to 
reality. I loved her, and her death somehow cured me of the loss of my 
grandmother. Now, whenever I hearStrangers in the Night 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlSbSKNk9f0>, it always reminds me of me and 
her.”

“We go walking together every Thursday, usually within the Greater London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> area; most of us are retired so we’ve 
got Freedom Passes. Only torrential rain will stop us – well, some of us! So we 
meet at an Underground station and walk for five to seven miles. We also have 
socials and holidays together.


“Most of us are widows. When your husband dies you have to get back out there, 
so you join this club, you make lots of new friends and the world opens up 
again.”

Every morning when I wake up I say, thank God I’ve got another day

“In India not many people exceed 60 or 65. At that age, you’re really an old 
person. That’s why I look at myself now and think, what have I done to deserve 
still being here? I’m 86 and I’m still ticking over, still walking about. Every 
morning when I wake up I say, thank God I’ve got another day.”

Fatieh: “I’ve had cancer – mainly lung but also breast – for the last seven to 
eight years now. When they found the tumour in my brain I thought, I will go 
through this and I will try to survive it. This is just another experience, one 
which brings you face to face with life and death, and which you can learn 
from. I think this is very important.”

Mona: “We’re sisters. She’s the baby of the family, five years younger than 
me, and we’ve always been close, though we’ve not always been in the same 
country. I came over from Lebanon to be with her when she was first diagnosed 
with the brain tumour – that’s a very scary thing and I didn’t want her to be 
alone. Her operation was three days ago. She was supposed to be out in an hour 
or so, but she didn’t re-emerge until 11 that night, and all the time I was 
thinking, she might be confused, she might be brain damaged or she might be 
dead ... Then I heard the squeaking of a trolley and Fatieh was wheeled out – 
and she was laughing.”

“In 1942, after I’d turned 18, my number came up and I was conscripted, so I 
saw quite a bit of war. I have two abiding memories from that time: the smell 
of death – it’s not a nice smell, sweet and clinging; it gets into your hair, 
and you never forget it – and the first time I saw a dead soldier.

“He was a German lying on his back, and I looked at him and I thought: well, 
he’s one of us. He could just as easily be the chap next door; a lad in my 
class at school. He could have been me. It made me think: this is bloody silly, 
what’s it all about? From that moment onwards – although I was involved in the 
killing spree which happens when you’re a gunner – it was just about having the 
discipline to see the war through, and trying to survive.”

“I ended up working in mental healthcare for 30 years and I loved it so much, 
I felt this was where I should be. I’ve always been very good at loving myself, 
and that’s made me very good at loving other people.


“I helped my patients feel safe and taught them strategies to deal with 
stressful situations, and they in turn taught me how to really be myself and 
that there is always hope. I think people are wonderful; it’s so good to feel 
their warmth, and that’s given me a very happy life.”

“I worked as an inspector on the Underground for nearly 45 years, and when I 
was locking up stations at night I was always having to ask people who were 
hiding there – some of them elderly – to go out into the cold, bitter night, 
knowing I was going home to a warm bed. So I went and found out the addresses 
of hostels and shelters where they could stay, made it my business to help them 
out in any small way I could, and I got to know most of them in the end. Since 
I’ve retired, I’ve kept doing it.”
