The Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs has instigated a range of changes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/academy-clarifies-oscar-rule-changes-following-diversity-row>
 that aim to improve diversity within the voter base, while industry figures 
and other notable voices have all expressed a desire for change. Civil rights 
activistAl Sharpton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/29/al-sharpton-this-will-be-the-last-night-of-an-all-white-oscars>
 has already claimed that he will escalate protests if next year’s winners are 
all white.

Actors Idris Elba and Michael B Jordan might have been snubbed this year, but 
in 2017, a range of films and performances could provide the awards with some 
much-needed diversity.

Here are the films which might prevent #OscarsSoWhite from trending again.

 The marrying kind … Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo in A United Kingdom. 
Potential nominees: Amma Asante, David Oyelowo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-oyelowo>

British director Amma Asante 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/18/amma-asante-belle-bicultural-ghanaian-british-director-grange-hill>
’s last film, the period dramaBelle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/15/belle-review-costume-drama-teeth-slavery>
, was seen as a small-scale sleeper success on release, with some suggesting 
that star Gugu Mbatha-Raw deserved attention from the Academy for her 
performance. Her next film sounds like it has a stronger chance. The cast is 
headed by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike andDavid Oyelowo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/09/david-oyelowo-black-history-should-taught-in-british-schools>
, who was unfairly snubbed in 2015 for his arresting turn in Selma. They star 
as a real-life couple whose marriage caused international outrage in the 1940s.

 Powerful drama … Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton in Loving. Photograph: Ben

Potential nominees: Ruth Negga

Another film about the struggle of a real-life interracial couple comes from 
director Jeff Nichols, who impressed with Take Shelter and Mud. It stars 
Ethiopian-Irish actorRuth Negga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/07/ruth-negga-the-crush-bim-adewunmi>
 and The Gift’s breakoutJoel Edgerton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/nov/26/black-mass-joel-edgerton-video-interview>
 as a couple who were sent to prison for getting married in 1950s Virginia. 
Oscar winner Colin Firth is a producer, and the film’s powerful fact-based 
drama sounds like awards-friendly material.

The biggest story to come out of this year’s Sundance film festival was the 
overwhelming success of Nate Parker’s slavery drama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-sundance-slavery-epic-as-brutal-as-braveheart>
, which was purchased by Fox Searchlight for a record-breaking $17.5m. The 
actor, who had roles in Non-Stop and Beyond the Lights, also directed the film, 
which has been a passion project. He’s already getting awards buzz for his work 
in front of and behind the camera, and – along with co-star Aja Naomi King, 
best known forHow to Get Away with Murder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/27/how-to-get-away-with-review-season-finale>
 – he’s close to a cert for Oscar glory.

 Chess gambit … Lupita Nyong’o, right, in Queen of Katwe. 
Potential nominees: Lupita Nyong’o, Mira Nair, David Oyelowo

Since winning a best supporting actress Oscar in 2014 for her powerful 
performance in 12 Years a Slave,Lupita Nyong’o 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/27/crush-week-lupita-nyongo> 
has been curiously absent from the big screen – bar a motion capture role in 
Star Wars: The Force Awakens. But this year she will be seen as well as heard 
in Disney’s Africa-set drama, based on the true story of a Ugandan chess 
prodigy who gained worldwide fame. The film also stars David Oyelowo, and comes 
fromMira Nair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/nov/09/mira-nair-film-director>, one 
of the few Indian female directors working in Hollywood.

Ang Lee is not just the only Asian director to have won the Oscar for best 
director but also one of the few film-makers with more than one Academy award 
(for Brokeback Mountain and Life of Pi). He’s returning with another literary 
adaptation that’s likely to bring him yet more awards glory: Ben Fountain’s 
2012 novel about the final hours before a group of soldiers head back to Iraq. 
A key role for Vin Diesel could also remind us, and the Academy,what a good 
actor he can be

After misfiring with the earnest yet flat NFL drama Concussion, Will Smith is 
heading back into the awards race with this star-studded tale in which he plays 
alongside Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet. It’s the story of a 
man who falls into a depression after a tragedy. The ever underusedNaomie Harris
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/30/naomie-harris-winnie-mandela-interview>
, wasted in last year’s Oscarbait boxing flick Southpaw, could also be in with 
a chance.

The McConaissance might have stalled of late (Matthew McConaughey’s last film, 
The Sea of Trees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/the-sea-of-trees-review-gus-van-sant-matthew-mcconaughey>
, was panned at Cannes) but the actor’s next film looks like it could be an 
awards contender. It tells the true story of a white farmer who led a rebellion 
against the confederacy with the help of other farmers and local slaves. Gugu 
Mbatha-Raw, who shone opposite Nate Parker in the little seen romanceBeyond the 
Lights <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/14/beyond-the-lights-review>, 
stars as the former slave who becomes his wife, in what promises to be a plum 
role for the underrated British actor. They are also joined by House of Cards 
standoutMahershala Ali
