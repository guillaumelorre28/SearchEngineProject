The winner: Straight Outta Compton

Shrugging off the challenge of new releases led by Owen Wilson thriller No 
Escape 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/28/no-escape-review-owen-wilson-and-lake-bell-suffer-boggle-eyed-panic-attack>
, Straight Outta Compton held on to the top spot in the UK, with a decline from 
the previous frame of 45%. After 10 days, the NWA biopic has grossed a solid 
£5.81m.

Obvious comparison points for Straight Outta Compton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/straight-outta-compton> are Notorious (about 
Biggie Smalls) and Get Rich or Die Tryin’ (starring 50 Cent). Notorious maxed 
out in the UK with £2.81m in 2009, while Get Rich managed £2.03m in 2006.

The industry rule of thumb, whereby a film in the UK will gross one 10th of 
the US number, but with the $ sign switched to £, tends not to work out in the 
case of films where the majority of cast members are black. Films starring 
Tyler Perry are an extreme example of this trend, and many were not released 
theatrically in the UK.

 Straight Outta Compton - video review 
Think Like a Man, featuring an ensemble cast led by Kevin Hart, grossed $92m 
in the US, indicating a UK gross just over £9m, whereas the actual achieved 
result was £664,000. In this context, both Notorious ($36.8m in the US) and Get 
Rich ($31.0m in the US) actually held up pretty well in the UK. Straight Outta 
Compton has grossed a whopping $150m in the US, after four weeks of play. That 
would indicate a UK gross of £15m, which, frankly, nobody is or was expecting.

The runner-up: Inside Out

 Inside Out - video review 
Now in its seventh week of release, Pixar’s Inside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out> holds steady at No 2 in the 
chart, a position it has occupied for the past month. As a point of comparison, 
this year’s top movie Jurassic World only managed three weeks in the top two 
places of the chart – released at a more competitive time, of course, with the 
likes of Minions and Ant-Man arriving in its slipstream. The last time a film 
was so highly placed so deep into its run was back in December 2012, with 
Skyfall.

Inside Out has now grossed just over £36m, which puts it ahead of Up (£34.7m) 
in the all-time Pixar league table (not adjusted for inflation). Next in its 
sights: Finding Nemo, with £37.5m plus £1.2m for the 3D rerelease. Higher still 
are Monsters, Inc, Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3.

Inside Out enjoyed the smallest drop of any film in the top 10 (down 39% from 
the previous frame). All films were hit on Sunday by sunny weather, which 
dampened grosses across the market. Overall, the market is showing a relative 
lack of disparity, with the top film grossing just 4.6 times the 10th-placed 
film, and a crowded field of 11 titles all earning £200,000-£400,000 at the 
weekend. As recently as early July, we saw a session where the top film 
(Minions) grossed 93 times the weekend takings of the film in 10th place.

 No Escape - video review 
The Friday after the August bank holiday has often proved a relatively soft 
date in the release calendar: a limbo land between the summer and the launch of 
autumn’s prestige titles. A year ago, films such as Let’s Be Cops, If I Stay, 
Sex Tape and Before I Go to Sleep all came out around this time. This year, we 
have No Escape, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, The Transporter Refuelled,
American Ultra <https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-ultra> and Ricki and 
the Flash. Released on a combined 1,900-plus screens, the five films grossed a 
combined £1.99m (including previews of £117,000), delivering a weak overall 
site average of just over £1,000.

Of the five titles, Americans-in-peril thriller No Escape did best, benefiting 
from a clear genre positioning. The film’s IMDb user rating of 7.0/10 is nearly 
double its MetaCritic score of 38/100. An opening gross of £638,000 including 
previews of £32,000 is hardly a triumph, but distributor eOne will be happy to 
have done better than the rival new releases.

 Me and Earl and the Dying Girl - video review 
Achieving the lowest screen average of the quintet (£616) as well as the 
lowest weekend gross (£220,000) is Ricki and the Flash. Marketable elements 
included director Jonathan Demme, writer Diablo Cody and star Meryl Streep, but 
these assets perhaps didn’t triangulate very successfully. Streep fans, who 
have enjoyed her in recent years as a nun, celebrity chef, English prime 
minister, pill-popping southern matriarch and singing witch, proved predictably 
less enticed by her as a washed-up LA bar-band rocker.

In the case of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, previews of £85,000 have pushed 
it several places up the chart, leapfrogging American Ultra, The Transporter 
Refuelled andPixels <https://www.theguardian.com/film/pixels>, all of which 
actually grossed more over the three-day weekend period.

 Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation - video review 
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mission-impossible-rogue-nation> has just 
cracked £20m, the first film in the M:I franchise to do so. All four of the 
previous films in the series landed in the £15m-£19m range, with the first 
Mission: Impossible (1996) best, with £18.65m.Globally, Rogue Nation has 
cracked $500m, with China, where it opened today (8 September), still to come.

 45 Years - video review 
Although not in the box-office top 10, 45 Years is doing very nicely at No 13 
in the chart. Having debuted the previous weekend with £309,000 plus £22,000 in 
previews, the British drama now falls 31%, for a 10-day total of £917,000. A 
modest expansion from 68 to 89 cinemas helped the film hold up at the box 
office.For comparison, director Andrew Haigh’s last film Weekend reached 
£222,000 in the UK. Very strong reviews, growing admiration for Haigh and 
acclaim for lead actors Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay are all factors in 
the success of45 Years <https://www.theguardian.com/film/45-years>, which is 
the biggest-grossing and widest-playing film ever released synchronously in 
cinemas and on the Curzon Home Cinema premium VOD platform.

 Legend – official teaser trailer 
Overall, UK cinemas achieved their second worst result of the past year, 
bettering only the feeble session in mid March, when Run All Night and Suite 
Française were the top new releases. Cinemas are crying out for fresh 
commercially potent product, and bookers will be pinning hopes on Legend, 
starring a double dose of Tom Hardy, arriving on 9 September. YA sequel The 
Maze Runner: Scorch Trials, landing on Thursday, should also help bring some 
life to the market. The Visit, which sees M Night Shyamalan teaming up with 
producer Jason Blum and returning to his genre roots, is also in the mix, as is 
Woody Allen’sIrrational Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/irrational-man>.
