The winner: Kung Fu Panda 3

While the February half-term holiday this year saw Disney, Pixar and 
DreamWorks Animation all sit out the contest – ceding the field to Fox’s 
Chipmunks franchise – it’s a different story this Easter. Good Friday sees the 
arrival of Disney Animation’sZootropolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/zootopia-zootropolis-zoomania-review-disney>
, and it’s already begun popping up in previews, with more to follow. It’s been 
preceded by DreamWorks Animation’sKung Fu Panda 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/kung-fu-panda-3-review>, which 
cruised to an easy win at the box office with £3.18m from 583 cinemas, plus 
£1.59m in previews, for a total of £4.77m. The weekend number is very similar 
to previous entries in the franchise, although more aggressive previews on the 
earlier films pushed those totals higher. Kung Fu Panda debuted in July 2008, 
with £3.11m plus £2.96m for a £6.07m total. Kung Fu Panda 2 began in June 2011, 
with £3.07m plus £3.12m in previews for a £6.19m total. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the 
whole Easter school holiday ahead of it – two solid weeks when families will be 
available for cinema visits, although it will face fierce competition from 
Zootropolis.

The runner-up: Allegiant

Landing a place below Kung Fu Panda 3, and with about half the box office, is 
Allegiant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/the-divergent-series-allegiant-review-big-boring-teen-thriller-sequel>
, the latest in The Divergent Series. This third entry in the franchise has 
begun with £1.58m, plus £262,000 in Thursday previews, for a four-day total of 
£1.84m. Stakeholders may have concerns that the franchise is now moving in the 
wrong direction, since the original Divergent kicked off in April 2014 with 
£1.77m, and Insurgent just under a year later with £2.55m plus previews of 
£385,000, for a £2.94m total. Ignoring previews, Allegiant has opened 38% below 
its predecessor. If previews are included in the calculations, it’s a very 
similar story: Allegiant is 37% behind Insurgent. The budget of Allegiant has 
not been confirmed, but the first film is believed to have cost $85m, and the 
second $110m. These films have a significant physical cost, and are a lot more 
expensive than rival franchise Maze Runner, for example. Both Maze Runner films 
outgrossed both in the Divergent series so far, going by worldwide box office. 
The wisdom of splitting the final novel in Veronica Roth’s YA trilogy into two 
films – Allegiant and next year’s Ascendant – may be called into question. If 
audience interest continues to flag, this hardly looks like the easy commercial 
win that resulted from the extending of the Harry Potter, Twilight and Hunger 
Games film franchises.

The real runner-up: London Has Fallen

Although Allegiant occupies second position in the official comScore chart, it 
does so only by virtue of the film’s Thursday previews. Going by 
Friday-to-Sunday takings only, the runner-up honours belong to London Has 
Fallen, which grossed £1.80m, taking its 11-day tally to £6.44m. The Gerard 
Butler actioner fell just 34% from the previous frame – the gentlest decline of 
any film in the top 10. That’s remarkable for several reasons. First, London 
Has Fallen is a sequel, so you would expect business to be front-loaded, with 
fans rushing out in the first week. Second, it’s a mainstream action picture, 
which is a genre that tends to skew to the kind of audiences (including young 
males) that are traditionally quick to see films, swiftly moving on to fresh 
releases. Third, reviews have been largely hostile, often an indication that 
word-of-mouth will be weak once the film begins to engage beyond the core 
fanbase. The film’s IMDb user rating remains a decent 6.4/10, and the 
MetaCritic score is 28/100 – evidently the audience and the paid professionals 
continue to disagree on the film’s merits.London Has Fallen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/london-has-fallen> has already overtaken the 
lifetime total here of predecessor Olympus Has Fallen (£6.22m). The film may be 
benefiting from a local boost in the UK, but the numbers suggest that further 
cities may soon be welcoming a dishevelled Butler trotting around familiar 
landmarks with US president Aaron Eckhart, while dispatching evil terrorists.

Finding the perfect release date is never easy, but observers did wonder 
whether it was wise for distributor Icon to position its London-set chillerThe 
Ones Below 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/the-ones-below-review-elegantly-nasty-middle-class-drama>
 on the same weekend as Universal’s supernatural horrorThe Witch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/the-witch-review-a-eerie-campfire-tale-that-gets-under-your-skin>
. The films are very different, but they both classify as “elevated genre”, 
having premiered respectively at the Toronto and Sundance film festivals. 
Wouldn’t the audiences overlap? In the end, the potential clash was solved by 
the very modest programming of The Ones Below – David Farr’s film was released 
into just 11 cinemas, all in London. Whether that was a strategic choice made 
by the distributor, or one forced on it by the indifference of cinema 
programmers, is hard to say. The Ones Below enjoys a 71% Fresh critical rating 
at Rotten Tomatoes, but a weak 38% approval rating among the site’s users. UK 
opening gross is a poor £7,000. The Witch debuts with £448,000 from 179 
cinemas, including modest previews of £11,000. Site average is a decent £2,501. 
Given the low production cost, this looks like a canny acquisition for 
Universal, which has multiple foreign rights.

The indie challenger: Anomalisa

While Hail, Caesar! continues to be the top attraction for fans of independent 
cinema, Charlie Kaufman’s stop-frame animationAnomalisa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/anomalisa-review-charlie-kaufman-puppet-masterpiece-about-the-human-condition>
 is now positioned as a plucky alternative. Curzon Artificial Eye pushed the 
film out into 80 cinemas, delivering a debut of £223,000, including previews of 
£30,000. Assessing that result is a distinct challenge, since there are no real 
directly comparable titles you can point to. The Kaufman-directed Synecdoche, 
New York began in May 2009 with £123,000 from 30 venues, including previews of 
£10,000 – but that was live action, with a rich ensemble cast including Philip 
Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener and Michelle Williams. Reviews were 
significantly more ecstatic this time around, but a stop-frame animation about 
a male midlife crisis, with David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh in the voice 
cast, was never exactly a commercial slam-dunk.

Thanks to the arrival of Kung Fu Panda 3, takings are a nice 26% up on the 
previous frame, and a very healthy 94% up on the equivalent weekend from 2015, 
when the top new releases were Run All Night and Suite Francaise. (This outcome 
is essentially a blip, caused by an earlier Easter, and hence the earlier 
release this year of a big animated film.) Among official releases, cinema 
bookers will have big hopes pinned on the JJ Abrams-produced10 Cloverfield Lane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/10-cloverfield-lane-review-monster-sequel-john-goodman-mary-elizabeth-winstead>
, a “spiritual successor” to gene hit Cloverfield. Alternatives include fellow 
genre offering The Boy; religious-themed historical actioner Risen; and Ben 
Wheatley’s starry JG Ballard adaptationHigh-Rise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/14/high-rise-review-tom-hiddleston-ben-wheatley-jg-ballard-film-toronto-tiff>
