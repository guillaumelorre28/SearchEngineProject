I used to hate making decisions when I was a teenager. Not little stuff – I 
was great at making small choices that wouldn’t have a huge impact on my life. 
Pizza or a cheeseburger? Rom-com or horror film? Strapless dress or cap 
sleeved? Those were easy. It was the big, capital letter Decisions that 
stressed me out. And to cut myself a bit of slack – I hadn’t had to make many. 
So many things were decided for me when I was a teen, such as my school 
schedule and my extra-curricular activities, that when it came time for me to 
make big decisions myself, I’d not had much practice. And maybe because of 
this, making big Decisions terrified me.

 Morgan Matson: procrastination queen. But not any more! 
They scared me so much that I made the brilliant move of avoiding making them 
for as long as possible. I took procrastination about making big Decisions – 
like where to attend university, or choosing what classes to take – to an art 
form. And usually, by not making a decision, things would end up getting decided
for me. For example, I couldn’t get into a certain class because I’d waited too 
long to try and get in…so that was a choice I didn’t have to make myself. And 
if I wasn’t happy with the outcome, I could just blame circumstances! It wasn’t
my fault, after all.

It wasn’t until after a few years of this that I realised…not making a 
decision is actually the same thing as making a decision. Except much worse, 
because you’re just running against the clock and then having to take what 
comes your way, as opposed to choosing what you want for your life, yourself. 
Because it’sscary to have to do that!


But I remember the moment when I realised how empowering it could be. I was in 
my second year of university, and I was feeling like I needed to take a step 
back. I had gone straight from my high school to college and not taken a gap 
year. At the time I didn’t know to describe it like this, but I was burnt out. 
I wasn’t excited about my classes, I wasn’t sure if my major was a good fit for 
me, and it felt like I was just wasting time and money. And rather than just 
letting the clock run out, and wasting my last two years of university, I made 
a Decision. A big one.

I decided I wanted to take a year away from studying. I’d get a job, and I’d 
be in the real world for a while. And it was the best decision I could have 
made.


I got a job in the children’s department of a bookstore, and fell in love with 
young adult literature. I started reading all the YA I could get my hands on 
and, at night, I started attempting to write my own book. I got a taste of the 
real world – of life without a meal plan or parental support – and saw just how 
easy I’d had it up until that point. I got a much-needed dose of perspective. 
When I returned to school the following fall, it was with a new focus on 
English and creative writing. And five years later, my first YA book was 
published.

Making that big a decision was absolutely the scariest thing I’d done up to 
that point. But it wasmy decision, and even if it turned out badly, I knew that 
I would have made it for myself…I wasn’t letting someone else, or 
circumstances, make it for me.


Big decisions are scary – but maybe they should be. Maybe they’re scary so 
that you pause and think about them, and consider what’s at stake. But when 
you’re confronted with a big decision, the best advice I can give is to take a 
deep breath, and look it square in the face. And thenyou get to decide.
