Much like rock'n'roll, hip-hop at its birth was an essentially new form of 
music. Also like rock'n'roll, the music was quickly codified into a canon. By 
the early 90s, there was already an old and a new school (or skool) while what 
came to be known as the golden age (roughly '87-'90) was a touchstone. 
Meanwhile, another creative flourish was taking place in hip-hop's birthplace.

In November 1993, two soon to be seminal albums emerged from the boroughs of 
New York. They were Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), the debut from theWu-Tang 
Clan <https://www.theguardian.com/music/wutangclan>, and A Tribe Called Quest's 
Midnight Marauders. The Wu-Tang were a Staten Island collective with a fixation 
for kung fu movies and a scuzzy, adroit aesthetic, the RZA's sparse production 
matched by the intricate lyrical performances of the group's nine MCs.

Midnight Marauders was the Queens-based Tribe's third album, a work of jazz 
influences and classic hip-hop beats that combined the braggadocio of the 
golden age with the delicacy of the daisy age. The album's cover featured mug 
shots of 71 hip-hop luminaries; another sign that history was already in the 
minds of those making the music.

were a Long Island collective. This has been corrected.
