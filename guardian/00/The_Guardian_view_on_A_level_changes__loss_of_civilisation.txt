the A-level subjects that introduce British sixth formers to disciplines they 
may not come across at home are being axed from the curriculum to make way for 
what the Department for Education considers more rigorous studies. At least 
that appears to be the justification for removing these life-enhancing 
subjects, although theexam board AQA suggested

 it was more to do with the difficulty of standardising marking regimes across 
different papers. It is true that relatively few state schools offered the 
subjects, partly because there was a shortage of teachers in some parts of the 
country. It is also the case that, thanks to public service broadcasting and 
free museums, there are other ways of learning about the original inspiration 
for our contemporary sense of what is beautiful, or understanding how our 
ancestors lived and worshipped, or what principles guided classical life. But 
if such ideas are unfamiliar at home, or considered unimportant, there may be 
no guide to the museums and no incentive to watchTime Team

curriculum, the government is narrowing access to the culture that shapes our 
sense of ourselves and what it means to be human.
