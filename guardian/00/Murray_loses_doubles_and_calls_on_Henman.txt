Andy Murray has sounded out Tim Henman for advice on dealing with pressure 
after he bade farewell to his first Australian Open in double-quick time by 
losing in the doubles yesterday. "The only person I've spoken to about it is 
Tim, as somebody who has been through the same thing as I will probably have to 
go through," said Murray. "But at the end of the day you just have to try to 
stay true to yourself and that's what I'm going to have to try to do."

He and his fellow 18-year-old Novak Djokovic lost their first-round match 
against Fabrice Santoro and Nenad Zimonjic 7-6, 6-3."It was the first time we'd 
played together and there were a few times we didn't communicate as well as we 
would have done if we'd maybe played five or six tournaments together," he 
said. "Now I need to get back to the way I play tennis best."
