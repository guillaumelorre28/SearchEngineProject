Andre Agassi <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andre-agassi> believes that 
his usual meticulous preparation will once again give him the edge as he 
prepares to defend his Australian Open title.

The 33-year-old American, champion on his last three visits to Melbourne, 
undertakes a punishing winter training schedule and was in confident mood 
despite losing to David Nalbandian in the Kooyong International final on 
Saturday.

"It's hard to change something that isn't broken. It's been an intense 
programme as good as, if not better, than in the years before," said Agassi, 
who dropped just one set last year on his way to a fourth victory. "I enjoy the 
hot, breezy conditions here. I try to make somebody play a great match to beat 
me. That is the most you can hope for."

Tim Henman, who missed last year's Australian Open through injury, was also 
eager to get under way, against the Frenchman Jean-Ren√© Lisnard tomorrow. "I'm 
focusing primarily on my own game," he said. "If I can execute my game plan I'm 
confident I can get the right result. The last few months have been very 
positive for me and I'm looking to extend that here."

Henman was edged out in five sets by America's Chris Woodruff in 2000, lost to 
Pat Rafter in straight sets in 2001 and was also ousted in three by Jonas 
Bjorkman in 2002.
