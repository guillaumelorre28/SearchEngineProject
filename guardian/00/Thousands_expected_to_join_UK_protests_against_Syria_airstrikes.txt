Thousands of people are expected to gather outside Downing Street and in 
cities across the UK on Saturday to protest against government plans to launch 
a bombing campaign inSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>.

Nearly 6,000 people have so far indicated on Facebook that they will attend 
the London protest organised by the Stop the War coalition.

The event page <https://www.facebook.com/events/1520504624933948/> says: “The 
UK has been bombing countries for a decade and a half, at the cost of millions 
of lives. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different 
results meets Albert Einstein’s definition of madness.

“We are calling on all our groups to organise protests in their towns and 
cities on the same day. We need to resist this brutalising and dehumanising 
spiral of violence.”

David Cameron published a document on Thursday outlining his case for 
airstrikes

 against Islamic State. He said: “The threats to our interests and to our 
people are such that we cannot afford to stand aside and not to act.

“Throughout Britain’s history we have been called on time and again to make 
the hardest of decisions in defence of our citizens and our country. Today one 
of the greatest threats we face to our security is the threat from Isil.”

The prime minister said all seven terror plots in the UK this year have been 
directed by Isis or inspired by the group’s propaganda. He insisted that 
bombing would be part of a comprehensive political and diplomatic plan to deny 
the group space and create the circumstances for an end to the civil war in 
Syria.

Hit Isis in their heartlands, says David Cameron

Chris Nineham, vice-chair of the Stop the War coalition, said: “I think it’s a 
very, very weak statement and I think Cameron has failed utterly to put a 
coherent case or to outline a coherent strategy. He has not been able to answer 
the question: why would a relatively minor increase in the level of bombing 
change the current situation, which is that America and its allies have been 
bombing Isis in Syria for 13 months and Isis has grown?

“We always get this argument when we are asked to back another war, that our 
weapons don’t kill civilians, that they are precision-guided, that they cause 
minimal ‘collateral damage’. And yet all the facts argue the opposite: one 
impact of extra bombing raids will be more civilians killed. Why on earth would 
Britain want to increase the death rate?

“Leaving aside the purely humanitarian question, doing that would entrench the 
bitterness towards the west. Does anyone really believe that Britain joining 
the war in Syria would make a terror attack on Britain less likely?

“The kind of action Cameron is outlining is going to increase the level of 
suffering and destruction in Syria, it’s liable to entrench the civil war [and] 
to strengthen rather than degrade the position of Isis.

“There simply is not an upside in the plan that Cameron has outlined. We are 
urging MPs to step back and think long and hard about the consequences before 
they take Britain into another war.”

The Downing Street protest will begin at midday. Similar protests, public 
meetings and actions are planned in 18 towns and cities, including Birmingham, 
Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and 
Swansea.

Nineham said that protests, organised at the last minute, had quickly 
attracted interest. “Very, very few protests that we have organised have got 
such a strong response so quickly on social media, so we are expecting 
thousands of people to descend on Downing Street this Saturday,” he said.


“People feel that it’s a critical moment in British politics. The strikes are 
high risk. We saw a Russian plane being shot down by Turkey two days ago. We 
are talking about entering a theatre of war which is already very crowded.

“There’s going to be protests right across the country and I think the 
anti-war movement is back, unfortunately. It shouldn’t have to be, but it is.”

Stop the War has been mobilising its members across the country to lobby their 
MPs. The group claims thousands of people have written to their MPs using its 
online tool. It has also sought to mobilise local groups to lobby MPs directly 
at their weekly surgeries for constituents.
