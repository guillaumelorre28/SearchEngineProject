A unique joint work on a single sheet of paper, a handwritten poem and 
original drawing byAA Milne <https://www.theguardian.com/books/aa-milne> and EH 
Shepard, the partnership that would go on to create some of the best loved 
children’s books of all time, in the Winnie the Pooh series, is to be auctioned 
in London, with an estimated sale price of up to £50,000.

The teddy bear lying on the bed in Shepard’s drawing was the real Christopher

little brain and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood.

The kneeling boy was Christopher himself, and Vespers, the sentimental poem 
the drawing illustrates, published in the 1924 volume of poems When We Were 
Very Young, haunted him for the rest of his life. Christopher later described 
the verse and the endlessly parodied lines “Hush! Hush! Whisper who dares! 
Christopher Robin is saying his prayers”, as “a poem which has brought me 
toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment”.

James Richards, a specialist on the period at Christie’s auction house, where 
the work will be sold on 15 July, thinks the work is enchanting, but added: 
“When I was brought up being read the poems and the Pooh stories, I did not 
realise that the real Christopher Robin did not have a good relationship with 
his father.”

He believes the drawing, probably originally a working drawing for the 
publishers showing how the poem would be set out, is probably Shepard’s 
earliest version of the bear that would become immortal, and the most extensive 
joint manuscript work by the two men.

The market for such nostalgia is avid: in December, the original drawing of 
the boy and bear playing Pooh Sticks seta new world record 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/10/image-winnie-pooh-sticks-auction>
 when it sold at Sotheby’s for more than £300,000, more than double the highest 
estimate.

Milne himself insisted that the poem was not sentimental and was even less 
pious: “The truth us that prayer means nothing to a child of three, whose 
thoughts are engaged with other more exciting matters.”
