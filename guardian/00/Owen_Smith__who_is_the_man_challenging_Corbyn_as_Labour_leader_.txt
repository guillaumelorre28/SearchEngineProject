Even the most ardent supporters of Owen Smith’s campaign for the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership concede he is not a 
household name.

But when it became clear that the 46-year-old former BBC producer had elbowed 
the more senior challenger,Angela Eagle, out of the race against Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/19/owen-smith-angela-eagle-theresa-may-brexit-trident-politics-live>
 this week, the excitement among MPs drinking on the House of Commons terrace 
was palpable.

“No one knows who he is but they will have ample chance to get to know him 
over the coming weeks. It is an advantage,” said Jenny Chapman, a friend and 
fellow member of the 2010 intake of Labour MPs.

“They will see Owen throws himself 100% into everything he is doing. He is 
going to eat, sleep, breathe this and we deserve nothing less from a leader.”

He may have a long way to go to win the backing of Labour members, but MPs 
believe Smith is currently their best hope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/jeremy-corbyn-labour-owen-smith-leader>
 of getting rid of the leader they are desperate to depose.

His pitch is to be the soft-left “heir to Corbyn” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/owen-smith-profile-ambitious-politician-labour-soft-left-option>
 who would hand his predecessor a presidential role and pledge to keep the 
party anchored against austerity, while promising to have greater appeal to the 
wider electorate.

But to his detractors who are loyal to Corbyn, Smith is everything that was 
wrong with politics – from the New Labour model of spin and winning at all 
costs. They say the former special adviser and lobbyist would undo all the new 
leader’s work to return the party to a pre-Blair era.

Owen Smith: ‘I’m going to be just as radical as Jeremy Corbyn’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jul/20/owen-smith-im-going-to-be-just-as-radical-as-jeremy-corbyn-video>
Smith has been MP for Pontypridd in Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> for just six years, but it had been 
clear to many of his colleagues for some time that he had serious ambitions to 
lead the party.

He was first named as a possible outside candidate for the leadership after 
the general election in May last year, but he rebuffed those urging him to 
stand, believing it was not yet his moment.

Asked by the Guardian last November about his future plans, Smith said he was 
“flattered and surprised” to be tipped, before giving an open answer to the 
question of whether he would like the top job one day.

“All of us should want to achieve our maximum potential as politicians. I’m in 
politics to try to change the world for the better, starting with the town 
where I grew up and I now represent,” he said.

“I want to be a force for good in the world. Therefore, you need to achieve 
power.Nye Bevan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/02/nye-bevan-militant-godfather>
, my great hero, said it’s all about achieving and exercising power. I’ve 
devoted my life to that.”

This close identification of himself with Bevan is key to understanding 
Smith’s thinking, according to Nick Thomas-Symonds, an MP in the neighbouring 
Welsh constituency of Torfaen, who has writtena biography of the Attlee 
government health minister 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/28/nye-political-life-of-aneurin-bevan-review-nicklaus-thomas-symonds-chris-mullin>
.

“Owen was always one destined for the top, in my view,” Thomas-Symonds said. 

“He was someone who had a very clear sense of what he wanted to achieve … it 
is an application of socialist principles to government.

“That was also the key about Bevan. You look at the painstaking negotiations 
for the creation of the NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/18/nye-bevan-history-of-nhs-national-health-service>
 – pursuing an ultimate goal and seeing the practical route towards it.”

People who have worked for and with Smith say he is much the same in private 
as he is in public: straightforward, fluent and determined.

He was mocked this week for claiming to be a “Duracell bunny”, shortly after 
answering a question about having no need for Viagra. But colleagues say the 
most noticeable thing about him is boundless energy, with him often working 17 
or 18-hour days.

This single-minded drive to succeed has also caused some unease among 
colleagues, especially female Labour MPs, about the way he entered the 
leadership race late and only after Eagle had launched the challenge to Corbyn, 
meaning she took the initial flak for triggering the contest.

Smith denies any manoeuvring, saying at the time: “I came into the race late 
because my brother was ill in hospital and I was at his bedside for a few days.”

Some early backers of Eagle felt guilty for abandoning her leadership bid in 
favour of his, but the fact that he is a relatively new MP with less of Eagle’s 
baggage from the Blair era swayed a lot of waverers.

“I wanted to support the female candidate. There is no one more than me who 
wants a Labour woman prime minister,” said one Labour MP.

“But I just couldn’t bring myself to back Angela because of some of the 
rightwing MPs she had around her who I want absolutely nothing to do with.”

Since Eagle crashed out of the race, Smith has made a decision to surround 
himself with senior women, including Kate Green as his campaign chief, and Lisa 
Nandy and Heidi Alexander as his strategic co-chairs.

In contrast to Eagle, Smith did not vote for the Iraq war or the air strikes 
on Syria – the fact he was not an MP at the time means he was not asked to 
decide.

And, although he supports Trident <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>, he 
always couples that point with a reminder that he is a former member of the 
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and is passionate about multilateral 
disarmament.

“I have huge admiration for Angela, but Owen is turning the page and there is 
a fresh story we need to be telling,” said Green, a former shadow women and 
equalities minister.

Born in Morecambe, Lancashire, Smith is the son of a Welsh historian, Dai 
Smith, and was educated at Barry boys comprehensive school in south Wales.

He studied history and French at the University of Sussex and went on to work 
as a BBC producer on the Welsh political programme Dragon’s Eye and Radio 4’s 
Today programme.

He has been quick to claim an “ordinary background”, but got into some hot 
water for saying he was a “normal” person with a wife and children. Although he 
did not mention Eagle, some of her supporters were livid at the implied 
contrast with their candidate, who is in a civil partnership.

However, it is past jobs as policy chief at pharmaceuticals companies Pfizer 
andAmgen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/owen-smith-worked-as-pr-chief-for-biotech-firm-hit-by-762m-fine>
, and as special adviser to Paul Murphy – the former Northern Ireland 
secretary, who did vote for the Iraq war – that have proved the most 
problematic.

Questions have been raised about the ethics of the companies he worked for, 
and quotes unearthed in which heendorsed greater choice in the NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/owen-smith-i-have-never-advocated-privatisation-of-the-nhs>
, potentially involving more private providers.

This provided ammunition for an attack on his past by Diane Abbott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-abbott>, the shadow health 
secretary, who said: “I know Owen Smith says he wasn’t a lobbyist, but for 
practical purposes he was.

“This is important because there is no issue closer to party members’ hearts 
than theNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> … people find the link 
between lobbyists and politics very distasteful.”

Owen Smith says he backs publicly owned NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jul/20/owen-smith-says-he-backs-publicly-owned-nhs-video>
The ability of his rivals to paint him as a signed-up member of the political 
and media elite is acknowledged in private by many of his supporters to be a 
weak spot in contrast to Corbyn, who has spent a lifetime very much outside the 
establishment.

But Murphy, now a Labour peer, who has known him for more than a decade, 
argues that Smith’s background working as an adviser to him during the Northern 
Ireland peace process is an asset.

“He went to places they wouldn’t let me go to for security reasons – Shankill 
Road, the Falls Road – and act as my emissary,” Murphy said.

“He was actually taking part in the peace process and built up a trust with 
political leaders. When he was there in the week, we virtually lived together. 
It was a time of crisis after crisis and he showed all his skills: good 
judgment, brilliant advice to me on difficult issues.

“He really went off to work for Pfizer on the basis that political advisers 
inevitably are in a transitory job and he had a young family. But ultimately it 
was politics that he wanted.”

Jeremy Corbyn has served Labour well. But Owen Smith is the leader we need |

Smith’s backers say that if he wants to have any chance against the incumbent 
leader, his strategy will have to be to focus on policies and a firmly leftwing 
vision to attract the membership. He revealed on Friday that he has hired Neale 
Coleman, former head of policy for Corbyn, to work on his leadership campaign.

However, current polling of the party selectorate does not look good, 
suggesting that Corbyn is once again heading for a landslide victory that would 
confirm his supremacy in the Labour party.

But Smith’s backers are still upbeat about his ability to persuade his party 
that he is more of a leader than Corbyn, yet not one from the same old mould as 
Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, who members rejected so decisively 
just last year.

“He’s good and he’s the best we have, but he’s got room to improve,” said 
Chapman.

“And his strength is he speaks from the gut in a way people are sometimes not 
quite used to. I’ve watched him develop over the last six years and can see he 
is going to get a lot better during this contest. He is going to have to.”
