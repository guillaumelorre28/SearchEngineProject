Each week before the Oscars, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/how-to-win-your-oscars-pool> which 
take place on 2 March, Guardian film reviewerTom Shone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-shone> breaks down the likely winners 
at this year’s Academy Awards. Today: best actor, best foreign language film, 
best visual effects, best cinematography, best sound editing, best sound mixing 
and best score.

Matthew McConaughey <https://www.theguardian.com/film/matthew-mcconaughey> 
hasn’t had a “comeback” by the textbook definition of the term. He didn’t 
languish in movie jail like Mickey Rourke; he didn’t fall off the map for a 
decade like Dennis Hopper. Rather, like John Travolta, he sank in plain view – 
in the sunlit terrariums of romcom-land, where, if anything, he seemed even to 
be enjoying himself.

The resuscitation of his critical fortunes has, however, taken much the same 
course as Rourke’s: a scouring of the flesh, a purification of the body – “this 
old, broken down piece of meat”, in Rourke’s delicious phrase from The Wrestler.
Playing the stricken Ron Woodruff, in Dallas Buyers Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156634/dallas-buyers-club>, McConaughey 
is reptilian, feverish and emaciated, containing just the element of trompe 
l’oeil the Academy has learned to consider “acting”.

Its members have decided to reward his role in Dallas Buyers Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/07/matthew-mcconaughey-dallas-buyers-club>
 but it could as easily have been for any of the roles that have marked out the 
McConaughaissence, starting in 2011 withThe Lincoln Lawyer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/139767/lincoln-lawyer>, in which he 
dirtied up the attorney role with which he made his name in 1996, inA Time to 
Kill <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79962/time-to-kill>. In Magic Mike 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148230/magic-mike>, he deconstructed 
his own reputation as Cinema’s One Truly Objectified Male, whipping up the 
waves of female lust that buffeted the stage of the Xquisite like a conductor.

By last year, the fusillade of roles had become unignorable: Bernie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144231/bernie>, Killer Joe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/143054/killer-joe>, Mud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154505/mud>, Dallas Buyers Club, The 
Wolf of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155767/wolf-of-wall-street>, which he 
stole with a piece of improv designed to get him into character. People have 
won Oscars with far less. If McConaughey wins best actor on 2 March, as looks 
increasingly likely – with wins from the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and 
Broadcast Film Critics Association under his belt – it will be for one of the 
more protracted hot streaks in recent years.

His biggest competition is probably Chiwetel Ejiofor, who pulls off something 
very difficult in12 Years a Slave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156376/12-years-a-slave>, suggesting 
the fear of a man who must hide his intelligence at all costs or be beaten for 
it, and yet at the same time register the enraged consciousness of a free man.
Ejiofor picked up a Bafta at the weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/baftas-2014-chiwetel-ejiofor-best-actor-12-years-a-slave>
, where McConaughey wasn’t nominated, but the performance feels a little too 
internalised for the Academy’s taste: it likes acting that shows its working, 
as my math teacher used to say.

Some are predicting a last-minute rally from Leonardo DiCaprio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio>, whose Wolf of Wall Street 
is enjoying the mother of all last-minute promotional pushes (“HIS BEST 
PERFORMANCE EVER!” trumpet billboards in LA), but the undiluted spiritual 
toxicity of Jordan Belfort is a tough act for the Academy to swallow.

Others have Bruce Dern as their dark horse, for Nebraska 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155224/nebraska>, but I’m not feeling 
any vibrations on the tracks. If the old-geezer contingent couldn’t swing a 
nomination for Robert Redford, what chance a win for Dern?

Onto one of the harder nuts to crack this season is best foreign film. For 
years, anyone who wanted to vote in the foreign-language race needed to prove 
they had seen all the contenders. Not this year, when all 6,028 Academy members 
can vote without offering proof.

Does that further secure the path of Paolo Sorrentino’s sumptuous homage to 
Fellini,The Great Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154524/great-beauty>? It’s the 
frontrunner, has the critics on its side and is certainly the Film to Tick 
Without Watching, but the academy have a track record of shotgun weddings with 
watchable wild cards in this category – see the wins forThe Lives of Others 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115216/lives.of.others> and The Secret 
in Their Eyes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/136955/secret-in-their-eyes>. 

So some are marking up the chances of Felix van Groeningen’s Broken Circle 
Breakdown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/157941/broken-circle-breakdown>, which 
features a Bluegrass-obsessed Dutch couple weathering the sickness of a child. 
With a Bafta win under its belt, though, I think The Great Beauty should still 
swing it.

Expect a sweep from Gravity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156058/gravity> in the technical 
categories – best visual effects for sure, but also best cinematography, best 
sound mixing, best editing and most likely best score – all making Alfonso 
Cuarón’s film the night’s winner in terms of Oscar tally. (I have it winning 
seven, 12 Years A Slave three, andAmerican Hustle  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156243/american-hustle>coming away 
empty-handed, but more of that next week).

Best score is the wobbliest of those, with Owen Pallett’s beautiful 
collaboration with Arcade Fire on the soundtrack ofHer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156796/her> as a possible spoiler. If 
there’s one category the academy has been a little more adventurous of late, 
it’s this one, with a recent win for Trent Reznor’s ambient-electro score for
The Social Network 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137709/social-network>, but I think 
Stephen Price’s work on Gravity will win for the same reason the film is so 
secure in the sound categories: in a film which pays full heed to the silence 
of outer space, the soundtrack performs some extra heavy lifting. Price it is.
