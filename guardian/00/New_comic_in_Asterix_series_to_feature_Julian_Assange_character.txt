Asterix and the Missing Scroll is the second book by writer Jean-Yves Ferri 
and illustrator Didier Conrad, who took over from original co-creators Albert 
Uderzo and Rene Goscinny.

 “The central theme is really information and the control of information and 
the dramatic notion that surrounds this,” cartoonist Conrad said.

 Ferri and Conrad said several new characters had been inspired by real 
people, such as Jacques Seguela, publicist and image adviser to former French 
president François Mitterrand.

 “We thought about which public figure from our time can inspire us, and for 
Caesar’s adviser, we quickly thought of Jacques Seguela,” Ferri said.

 “This is not a physical caricature, it’s rather this type of character … the 
adviser in the shadows.“

 The other new addition is a journalist, inspired by Assange, whose 
anti-secrecy group’s publication of classified military and diplomatic 
documents in 2010 was one of the largest information leaks in US history.

 “It was more Didier who wished for the character to physically look a bit 
like Assange even if we can’t really say it’s him, but it’s this type of 
character,” Ferri added.

 The Asterix comics books, created in 1959, have sold more than 350 million 
copies worldwide.

 Asterix and the Missing Scroll will be released on 22 October.
