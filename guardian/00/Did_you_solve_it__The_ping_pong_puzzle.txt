Earlier today I set you the following puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/10/can-you-solve-it-the-ping-pong-puzzle>
:

Three friends (A, B and C) are playing ping pong. They play the usual way: the 
winner stays on, and the loser waits his/her turn again. At the end of the day, 
they summarise the number of games that each of them played:

A played 10


B played 15

C played 17.

Who lost the second game? 

Solution

A

First lets deduce how many games were played in total. If we add up the games 
that each of them played we get 10 + 15 + 17 = 42. Since each game requires two 
people, we half that number to get a total of 21 games.

Now let’s consider the minumum number of games it is possible for any player 
to play. This would be for a player who loses every time they play. If this 
losing player was in the first game, he/she would be out in the second game, 
play again in the third game, sit out the fourth, and so on. In other words the 
games played would be the odd-numbered games: 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-17-19-21. 
That’s eleven games in total.

But if this losing player sat out the first game, debuting instead in the 
second game, the player would play only the even numbered games: 
2-4-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20. That’s ten games in total.

The only possible way to play ten games is if only the even numbered games are 
played. Since A has played only 10 games, we can deduce A played in all the 
even games (and lost them all). So he/she lost the second game.
