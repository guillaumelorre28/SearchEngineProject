At least people who suffer low back pain used to be able to turn to 
acupuncture to get the placebo effect. Now that Nice have recommended it no

NHS told

, 25 March), what placebo can they turn to? I recommend Easter eggs, a great

• I cannot believe you published a recipe for hot cross buns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/26/hot-cross-bun-recipe-claire-ptak-baking-the-seasons>

• After reading, on page 38, Anna Wyndham’s letter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/25/tracey-and-mary-and-rolling-stones>
 (26 March) insisting that Richard Dawkins “will not get the last word”, I 
learned, on page 53, that it was his birthday that day.
