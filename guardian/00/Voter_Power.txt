"In ideal world, you would imagine that your vote would be worth the same as 
everyone else's. In our world (the UK), that is not the case â€“ whatever merits 
its supporters ascribe to first past the post, the direct link between a 
constituency and an MP, for example, it is undeniable that is also only voters 
in the marginals who really have the power to shape a result."
