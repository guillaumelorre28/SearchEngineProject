It's a familiar story through dance music, from Manchester's Eastern Bloc to 
Glasgow's Rubadub and Berlin's Hardwax: independent record shops acting as a 
kind of unofficial youth club for musicians and DJs who spend hours hanging out 
in the record racks, and then starting labels. Exeter's Mighty Force had a good 
hit rate, releasing the first everAphex Twin

Global Communication's Tom Middleton), and Matthew Herbert's Fog City debut, as 
well as employing Modaji's Dominic Jacobson and helping the early career of 
Basement Jaxx's Felix Buxton.
