Three female directors have films playing in competition at Cannes this year – 
a relatively high number for the festival, which has a history of being 
criticised for male bias.

American Honey – the first movie made in America by Red Road and Fish Tank 
director Andrea Arnold – is among the 20 films screening in competition. It

The other women competing for festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or, will be 
French actor and director Nicole Garcia, with second world war drama Mal de 
Parres, and German film-maker Maren Ade, whose film Toni Erdmann is about a 
father who ambushes his daughter with jokes, believing she has lost her sense 
of humour.

The festival has often been criticised for not celebrating more women or 
non-white film-makers in its most high profile strand. Four women featured in 
2011, but none was invited to the main competition the following year, and only 
a maximum of two have been included in the intervening years.

Cannes head Thierry Frémaux faced a backlash last year after reports emerged 
thatwomen were barred from the red carpet by festival security staff for not 
wearing high heels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes>
. Frémaux denied that wearing such footwear was part of festival regulations.

Of the competition’s male contingent, Ken Loach is perhaps the most surprising 
inclusion.The 79-year-old director was thought to have retired 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/11/ken-loach-capture-truth-moment-jimmys-hall-readers-questions>
 after his last film, Jimmy’s Hall. But Loach, a festival perennial who won the
Palme d’Or in 2006 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/may/29/film.cannes2006> 
for The Wind That Shakes the Barley, will return with another drama: I, Daniel 
Blake. It tells the story of a carpenter who falls ill and struggles to 
navigate the red tape of welfare support.

Olivier Assayas <https://www.theguardian.com/film/olivier-assayas> will also 
return to the Croisette with Personal Shopper, which reunites him with Kristen 
Stewart – whose role in 2014’sClouds of Sils Maria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/23/cannes-2014-clouds-of-sils-maria-review-juliette-binoche>
 won her a César award. Stewart also stars alongside Jesse Eisenberg and Steve 
Carell in the festival’s opening film, Woody Allen’s Cafe Society, which is 
screening out of competition.

Other key competition titles include the fifth film from Midnight Special 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/04/jeff-nichols-midnight-express-michael-shannon-thriller-scifi-twist>
 director Jeff Nichols: Loving, which stars Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton as a 
real-life couple battling racial prejudice in mid-50s America. The film is 
tipped for an awards push, with a November release date in the US.

Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, whose movies Drive and Only God Forgives 
made major splashes in 2011 and 2013, is back withThe Neon Demon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/04/nicolas-winding-refn-to-director-horror-film-the-neon-demon>

Christina Hendricks.

Sean Penn’s fifth film as director, The Last Face, is also selected. A drama 
set among aid workers in Africa, it stars Javier Bardem and Penn’s former 
partner, Charlize Theron.

Other returning veterans include Pedro Almodóvar, who has cancelled all press 
for new film Julieta since his name waslinked to the Panama Papers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/panama-papers-reveal-offshore-dealings-stars>
, the Dardenne brothers,Xavier Dolan

, Cristian Mungiu, Brillante Mendoza andBruno Dumont 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/08/bruno-dumont-ptit-quinquin-comedy->
.

Dolan’s movie, It’s Only the End of the World, marks the second time in 
competition for the 27-year-old French Canadian – who has also served on the 
jury. His last film, Mommy, won the Jury prize in 2014.

A more left-field inclusion is Paul (Basic Instinct) Verhoeven’s new movie, 
Elle <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3vr098WqY>, which stars Isabelle 
Huppert as the CEO of a video games company who is raped in her home and 
attempts to track down her attacker.

Jim Jarmusch <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jim-jarmusch> has one film in 
competition – Paterson, which stars Adam Driver as a bus driver – and another 
playing at a midnight screening: his Iggy Pop documentary Gimme Danger.

 Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe in The Nice Guys 
A small protest against changes to national labour laws delayed the press 
conference, in which Frémaux and president Pierre Lescure outlined the 49 films 
that were selected from 1,869 submissions. The line-up includes films from 28 
countries.

Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The BFG, starring Mark Rylance 
in the title role, will play out of competition, as willMoney Monster 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk>, the latest directorial effort 
from Jodie Foster, starring George Clooney as a newscaster kidnapped by a young 
man (Jack O’Connell) outraged by the role of the banks in the financial crisis. 
Julia Roberts plays Clooney’s producer.

Also out of competition is Cafe Society, and The Nice Guys 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-_HQ0bUzS8>, a 1970s-set crime caper with 
Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.

Not named in today’s announcement was Terrence Malick’s The Voyage of Time, an 
Imax documentary tackling “the birth and death of the known universe” which had 
been tipped for inclusion.

This year’s Cannes begins on 11 May. George Miller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/george-miller>, whose desert-set adventure 
Mad Max: Fury Road was one of last year’s major successes, chairs the jury.
