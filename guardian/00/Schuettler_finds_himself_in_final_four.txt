Rainer Schuettler, seeded 31, has reached the semi-finals of the Australian 
Open with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-0 victory over Wimbledon runner-up David 
Nalbandian, though he's not quite sure how he managed it.

"It's like a dream come true. The first time I'm in the semi-finals," 
marvelled Schuettler, who is through to the last four for the first time in 18 
Grand Slam starts. "I won it in four, it's unbelievable."

Nalbandian, the 10th seed, fell apart after the second set, missing with 
increasing regularity as he tried to get the ball past the speedy German.

The Argentinian rued his missed chance, though offered a reason for his tame 
surrender.

"I think I was a little tired from the match the other day," he said, 
referring to his five-set win over Roger Federer in the fourth round.

"Always you have a chance. I don't think this one is going to be my last," he 
added. "You always have another day, another match and you can win."

Schuettler gained a free pass into the fourth round when 2002 Australian Open 
runner-up Marat Safin withdrew with a wrist injury, and then beat James Blake 
to reach his first ever quarter-final at a major tournament.

"I'm happy to be in the semi-finals, I'm surprised," he reflected. "But I 
think so far I've played a pretty good tournament. I deserve right now to be in 
semis.

"Maybe I was lucky in the third round, but I'm in the semis," he said.

He'll next face either ninth-seeded American Andy Roddick or the 18th-seeded 
El Aynaoui, who beat world No1 Lleyton Hewitt in the fourth round.
