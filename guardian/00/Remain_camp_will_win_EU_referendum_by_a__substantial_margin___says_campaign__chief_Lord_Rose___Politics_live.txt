Afternoon summary

 * A total of 84,000 EU migrant families on tax credits would have been 
affected by David Cameron’s “emergency brake” if it had been introduced four 
years ago, official figures reveal. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/04/revealed-tax-credit-data-exposes-limits-of-camerons-emergency-brake>
The number – released by HMRC six months after it was first requested by the 
Guardian – appears far smaller than had been suggested by the prime minister in 
previous public statements justifying the plan. 
 * Lord Rose, chair of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, has said that 
his side will win the EU referendum campaign by “a substantial margin”.(See 
3.26pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b36976e4b05b93c48cd19e#block-56b36976e4b05b93c48cd19e>
He made the claim in a lunch to the press gallery. Matthew Elliott, chief 
executive of Vote Leave, said Rose was out of touch with public sentiment. 
Elliott said: 
The cosy establishment club doesn’t want change because it does well out of 
the status quo. But the people want change and to take back control. It’s a 
David vs Goliath struggle - but we all know who ended up winning that one.

Asked about claims that boasting like this could be counterproductive (see 
3.28pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b36df4e4b0769a09b9ba85#block-56b36df4e4b0769a09b9ba85>
, a campaign source said that voters wanted to identify with a winning side - 
but also that Rose was not a politician, and that he was inclined just to speak 
his mind when answering questions.

 * John Baron, a Conservative MP, has said that parliament will become 
“nothing more than just a chamber of Europe, a council chamber” if it does not 
assert its sovereignty. He was speaking in a debate on a backbench motion 
saying parliament should have the power to block unwanted EU legislation. The 
debate was dominated by Conservative backbenchers known for their opposition to 
Britain’s membership of the EU. 
 * An opinion poll in Scotland suggests the SNP still have a huge lead over 
Labour ahead of the Scottish elections in May.The TNS-BRMB survey shows the SNP 
on 57% in the constituency section, Labour on 21% and the Tories 17%. 
<http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/press-release/scottish-voters-favour-staying-eu-gap-narrowing>
 In the regional list section the SNP is on 52%, Labour 19% and the Tories 17%. 
The SNP’sDerek Mackay said: 
Labour woes are continuing in the face of the party’s rank incompetence north 
and south of the border – and with their plans to shift the burden of Tory 
austerity onto workers by hiking taxes on the low paid, their situation is only 
going to get worse.

 * Two major road tunnels across London could significantly ease congestion, 
the capital’s mayor, Boris Johnson, has said as he unveiled proposals to send 
more traffic underground. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/04/boris-johnson-london-road-tunnels-congestion-air-quality>
 * The EU’s top court has told the home secretary, Theresa May, she cannot 
deport a Moroccan mother with a British-born son simply because she has a 
criminal record.The advocate general of the European court of justice has told 
May that it will be contrary to EU law if she automatically expels or refuses a 
residence permit to a non-EU national with a criminal record who is a parent of 
a child who is an EU citizen. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/04/theresa-may-cant-deport-moroccan-mother-with-criminal-record-eu-court>
 AsAlan Travis reports, the preliminary opinion of the court’s advocate 
general, Maciej Szpunar, however, adds that while, in principle, deportation in 
such cases was contrary to EU law, he agreed with UK representations that there 
should be exceptional circumstances when a convicted criminal could still be 
deported depending on the seriousness of the offences involved. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

The Out campaigns are continuing their circular firing squad act. Arron Banks, 
the co-founder of Leave.EU, has just put out this statement.

Leave.EU initially welcomed the news that Vote Leave wanted to call a truce 
and work together. However, it is now crystal clear that they have zero 
interest in joining forces. Cummings, Elliott and their MPs have now been 
offered the the chance to form a united front five times, and on each occasion 
our overtures have been rejected outright.

For Cummings and Elliot this is a business, not a cause. Danny Finkelstein’s 
excellent analysis of the situation is sadly correct.

I am angry that this group is jeopardising this historic referendum through 
their dishonesty and unwillingness to embrace and work with all the Brexit 
groups. It’s time they and the Conservative MPs associated with them decide if 
it’s their career or their country which matters most to them, and then they 
can either fit in with the rest of us or quite frankly disappear.

Banks seems to be referring to the announcement this week about Dominic 
Cummings and Matthew Elliott stepping down from the Vote Leave board. 
<http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/vote-leave-changes-board-after-infighting-will-this-calm-the-out-camp-down/>
 Cummings, an abrasive character, was seen as an obstacle to a merger between 
Vote Leave and Leave.EU and, after it was announced that Cummings and Elliott 
were leaving the board, Banks repeated his offer to merge the two organisations.

But Banks himself is not Mr Diplomacy. This is what he tweeted about the news 
that Lord Lawson was becoming chair of Vote Leave.
Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) 
Mr ERM himself ! Could be this be any more of a Tory front ( with nod to 
friends )https://t.co/tu6uxHqJ0F <https://t.co/tu6uxHqJ0F>
 <https://twitter.com/Arron_banks/status/694941942728278016> February 3, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Arron_banks/status/694941942728278016> 
In his statement Banks is referring to this column by Daniel Finkelstein in 
the Times (paywall). 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4681025.ece> In it, 
Finkelstein described the alternative visions for Britain outside the EU put 
forward by Vote Leave, which is backed by the Ukip MP Douglas Carswell, and 
Leave.EU, which is backed by mainstream Ukippers, including Nigel Farage.

The vision of Carswell and his allies, including the Tory MEP Dan Hannan, is 
that we need to leave the EU because it is out of date. We must be an open, 
free market, free trading nation, linked to the English speaking world, 
powerful in global trading bodies. The Leave message should be optimistic, 
daring and broad ...

Voters are concerned about Britain losing control of its own policy, but when 
asked what aspect of control they are most concerned about, overwhelmingly they 
answer immigration. Their grasp of what the EU’s other powers and structures 
may be is, let’s just say, weak.

Yet many of Carswell’s Vote Leave allies don’t actually believe in strong 
immigration controls at all. They are free marketeers who see the benefits of 
free movement of workers ...

This is the great advantage of the Leave.EU campaign. It appreciates the 
centrality of immigration to the case for quitting. It has a very different 
outlook from the Carswell-Hannan group. It is much more pessimistic, much more 
focused on what Britain has lost and stands to lose. It doesn’t want some new 
English-speaking, free market internationalism. How much better would that be 
than the EU? It thinks the EU is too newfangled, not too modern.

I’ve asked Number 10 to elaborate on why Erna Solderg, the Norwegian prime 
minister, thinks the “Norwegian option” won’t work for the UK if it leaves the 
EU. (See12.29pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b#block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b>
A spokeswoman said that Soldberg simply made that point in her talks with David 
Cameron. The spokeswoman said she could not say any more about Soldberg’s 
reasoning.

UPDATE: Downing Street have come back to me to say this is what Cameron said 
about the “Norway option” at PMQs in October last year.

Some people arguing for Britain to leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, although not all of them, have pointed 
out a position like that of Norway as a good outcome. I would guard strongly 
against that. Norway pays as much per head to the EU as we do and takes twice 
as many migrants per head as we do in this country, but has no seat at the 
table and no ability to negotiate. I am not arguing that all those who want to 
leave the EU say that they want to follow the Norwegian path, but some do and 
it is very important that we are clear in this debate about the consequences of 
these different actions.

Here’s the New Statesman’s George Eaton on Lord Rose’s claim that the In side 
will win the EU referendum easily.
George Eaton (@georgeeaton) 
Big mistake for Stuart Rose to say In campaign will win "by a substantial 
margin". Never let voters think it's in the bag.

On the World at One Daniel Mitov, the Bulgarian foreign minister, said 
Bulgarians living in Britain were worried about the proposals in the draft EU 
renegotiation. He said that the negotiations were still going on, and that 
there was a need for some “polishing”, particularly in terms of how the 
emergency brake would work. But, despite being twice asked if Bulgaria was 
threatening to veto the plans, he declined to make that threat. Bulgaria wanted 
to see a reasonable compromise, he said.

Hammond rejects claims new sovereignty law would be pointless

As Nicholas Watt reports in the Guardian today, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/03/boris-johnson-near-agreement-with-cameron-over-eu-deal>
 David Cameron has said that the government will introduce some measure to 
assert the sovereignty of parliament. This will happen alongside the EU 
renegotiation, and will particularly appeal to Boris Johnson, the Conservative 
MP and mayor of London who has been calling for this for some time.

In his story, Nick says two options are being considered.

A few hours later, after the exchanges in the House of Commons, it became 
clear that the prime minister is prepared to deal with Johnson’s concerns on 
two levels. The prime minister is expected to:

 * Declare that the UK supreme court or another official body should be vested 
with powers akin to those of the German constitutional court, which has the 
right to assess whether legal acts by the EU’s institutions remain within the 
scope of the powers of the EU. Cameron first floated this idea ina speech at 
Chatham House in November 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-europe> after 
Johnson had outlined in a private plea to the prime minister to his calls for 
an assertion of parliamentary sovereignty 
 * Propose a possible fresh act of parliament to make clear that the UK’s 
agreement to the primacy of EU law – which dates back to 1972 – was gifted by 
parliament and could therefore be withdrawn by parliament. 
In the Times today (paywall) 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4682249.ece> Lord Neuberger
, president of the supreme court, said setting up an alternative constitutional 
court would be a mistake. He told the paper:

One of our great advantages compared with most of Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is that we have a very simple 
system of courts and I think replicating the civil, European system of having a 
supreme court and a constitutional court — a supreme administrative court — is 
just a recipe for complication, for cost and for unnecessary duplication.

And Lord Pannick QC, the prominent human rights lawyer, told the paper that 
giving the supreme court a constitutional role would be pointless.

For our supreme court to be given a function similar to that of the German 
constitutional court would not have any practical effect. The proposal has no 
legal merit. It may have a useful political purpose for the government, but the 
prime minister should be careful about raising expectations that will not be 
achievable.

Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, was asked about this on the World at 
One. When the comments in the Times were put to him he insisted that it was 
worth clarifying the position of UK law in relation to EU law.

There’s always been a discussion about constitutional precedence here, which 
law take precedence. I’m not a lawyer, but I’ve read a lot of stuff about this 
and there are a lot of very eminent lawyers saying that there are ways to 
address this issue; maybe not the perfect solution, but there are ways to 
assert the supremacy of our parliament and to give us a much stronger position 
than we have had in the past. And I think as this discussion goes forward we 
will want to see these ideas discussed and explained in full.

Hammond also hit back at David Davis, rejecting his claim that the emergency 
brake “would not stop a push bike”. (See 9.42am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b319b5e4b0fcd5ab7d50f5#block-56b319b5e4b0fcd5ab7d50f5>

I think David Davis is wrong and, frankly, those people who are not looking 
for a good deal with Europe but are looking to argue for Britain to leave 
Europe, and whatever the package contained would be looking for Britain to 
leave Europe, are obviously going to attack whatever the package contains. But 
it does contain significant measures that will change the way theEuropean Union

The Leave.EU campaign has hit back at the suggestion from the Norwegian prime 
minister, Erna Soldberg, that the “Norway option” could not work for the UK. 
(See12.29pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b#block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b>
 A spokesman said that it was not true to say that, if Britain were in EFTA and 
the EEA but outside the EU like Norway, it would have no say in drafting EU 
rules.

There is an enormous network of discussion and consultation even within 
EFTA/EEA, on a global and regional level, long before these rules ever get near 
a statute book. The UK would be an active part of this network, along with over 
190 international bodies.

EEA/EFTA representatives participate in over 500 committees and expert groups 
involved in what is known as “decision shaping” at single market level. Above 
EU level, EEA/EFTA representatives have their own seats on many global bodies 
which we cannot as EU member states.

Lunchtime summary

 * Number 10 has rejected a claim from Alan Johnson, chair of the Labour In 
For Europe campaign, that the “emergency brake” allowing the UK to stop EU 
migrants getting in-work benefits for up to four years will have no impact on 
immigration. Johnson made the claim in an interview on the Today programme.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/04/benefits-limit-sideshow-europe-alan-johnson-labour>
But the prime minister’s spokesman told journalists at the Number 10 lobby 
briefing that it would make a difference. Migrant families were able to claim 
£6,000 a year on average in tax credits, he said: 
I think common sense would tell us that reducing the financial incentive will 
reduce that pull factor.

As the Press Association reports, the spokesman was also unable to say whether 
migrants from wealthier EU states, such as Luxembourg, might end up receiving 
more generous child benefit payments than their British neighbours under the 
plan to give them child benefit at their home country rate, not the UK rate.

 * The Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg has said the “Norway option” 
would not work for the UK if it leaves the EU, Number 10 has said.(See 12.29pm.)

 Responding to an urgent question about the meetings, Home Office minister 
Karen Bradleysaid the government “condemns in the strongest terms anyone who 
condones rape and sexual violence or suggests that responsibility for stopping 
these crimes rests with the victims”. Responding to calls for him to be banned 
from the UK, Bradley said that the Home Office did not routinely comment on 
individual cases, but that the home secretary could ban non-British citizens if 
she believes their presence is “not conducive to the public good”. 
 * The Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox QC has been told to apologise to the House 
of Commons after failing to declare more than £400,000 of outside income on

Norwegian PM says leaving the EU and adopting the 'Norway option' won't work 
for the UK

David Cameron met Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister, in Number 10 
last night. Mostly they were talking about the Syria conference, but Cameron’s 
EU renegotiation also came up.Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway> 
is not in the EU, but it gets access to the single market through its 
membership of the European Free Trade Association. This means it has to submit 
to what is anachronistically referred to as “government by fax” because it has 
to comply with EU rules without having a say in how they are drawn up.

According to Number 10, Solberg said this would not be a good arrangement for 
the UK. This is from the readout of the meeting that Downing Street has just 
sent to journalists. A Downing Street spokesperson said:

[Cameron and Solberg] also discussed the prime minister’s work to win a 
renegotiated package for the UK in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. Prime Minister Solberg said she 
supported the prime minister’s work to build a more flexible EU and to cut red 
tape. She also agreed with the prime minister that Norway’s position in the 
European Free Trade Area but outside the EU would not work for the UK.

Solberg’s comments - at least, her comments as mediated through Number 10 - 
are significant because one of the challenges for those campaigning for Britain 
to leave the EU is explaining what its future trading relationship with the EU 
would be like. Often they cite “the Norway option”, but Cameron now has a new 
argument to deploy against that.

Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in Wales, will say in a speech 
later today that his party would cut ministerial salaries in the Welsh assembly 
by 10%. They would use the savings to encourage young people to get involved in 
politics through a national children and young people’s assembly for Wales.

After May the Welsh first minister’s salary is due to rise to £140,000, with 
other ministers’ pay rising to £100,000, and Davies says his proposal would 
save around £250,000 over five years.

 * A total of 84,000 EU migrant families on tax credits would have been 
affected by David Cameron’s “emergency brake” if it had been introduced four 
years ago, official figures reveal. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/04/revealed-tax-credit-data-exposes-limits-of-camerons-emergency-brake>
The number – released by HMRC six months after it was first requested by the 
Guardian – appears far smaller than had been suggested by the prime minister in 
previous public statements justifying the plan. 
 * Lord Rose, chair of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, has said that 
his side will win the EU referendum campaign by “a substantial margin”.(See 
3.26pm.)

He made the claim in a lunch to the press gallery. Matthew Elliott, chief 
executive of Vote Leave, said Rose was out of touch with public sentiment. 
Elliott said: 
The cosy establishment club doesn’t want change because it does well out of 
the status quo. But the people want change and to take back control. It’s a 
David vs Goliath struggle - but we all know who ended up winning that one.

, a campaign source said that voters wanted to identify with a winning side - 
but also that Rose was not a politician, and that he was inclined just to speak 
his mind when answering questions.

 * John Baron, a Conservative MP, has said that parliament will become 
“nothing more than just a chamber of Europe, a council chamber” if it does not 
assert its sovereignty. He was speaking in a debate on a backbench motion 
saying parliament should have the power to block unwanted EU legislation. The 
debate was dominated by Conservative backbenchers known for their opposition to 
Britain’s membership of the EU.

<http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/press-release/scottish-voters-favour-staying-eu-gap-narrowing>
 In the regional list section the SNP is on 52%, Labour 19% and the Tories 17%. 
The SNP’sDerek Mackay said: 
Labour woes are continuing in the face of the party’s rank incompetence north 
and south of the border – and with their plans to shift the burden of Tory 
austerity onto workers by hiking taxes on the low paid, their situation is only 
going to get worse.

 AsAlan Travis reports, the preliminary opinion of the court’s advocate 
general, Maciej Szpunar, however, adds that while, in principle, deportation in 
such cases was contrary to EU law, he agreed with UK representations that there 
should be exceptional circumstances when a convicted criminal could still be 
deported depending on the seriousness of the offences involved. 
That’s all from me for today.

The Out campaigns are continuing their circular firing squad act. Arron Banks, 
the co-founder of Leave.EU, has just put out this statement.

Leave.EU initially welcomed the news that Vote Leave wanted to call a truce 
and work together. However, it is now crystal clear that they have zero 
interest in joining forces. Cummings, Elliott and their MPs have now been 
offered the the chance to form a united front five times, and on each occasion 
our overtures have been rejected outright.

For Cummings and Elliot this is a business, not a cause. Danny Finkelstein’s 
excellent analysis of the situation is sadly correct.

I am angry that this group is jeopardising this historic referendum through 
their dishonesty and unwillingness to embrace and work with all the Brexit 
groups. It’s time they and the Conservative MPs associated with them decide if 
it’s their career or their country which matters most to them, and then they 
can either fit in with the rest of us or quite frankly disappear.

Banks seems to be referring to the announcement this week about Dominic 
Cummings and Matthew Elliott stepping down from the Vote Leave board. 
<http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/vote-leave-changes-board-after-infighting-will-this-calm-the-out-camp-down/>
 Cummings, an abrasive character, was seen as an obstacle to a merger between 
Vote Leave and Leave.EU and, after it was announced that Cummings and Elliott 
were leaving the board, Banks repeated his offer to merge the two organisations.

But Banks himself is not Mr Diplomacy. This is what he tweeted about the news 
that Lord Lawson was becoming chair of Vote Leave.

In his statement Banks is referring to this column by Daniel Finkelstein in 
the Times (paywall). 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4681025.ece> In it, 
Finkelstein described the alternative visions for Britain outside the EU put 
forward by Vote Leave, which is backed by the Ukip MP Douglas Carswell, and 
Leave.EU, which is backed by mainstream Ukippers, including Nigel Farage.

The vision of Carswell and his allies, including the Tory MEP Dan Hannan, is 
that we need to leave the EU because it is out of date. We must be an open, 
free market, free trading nation, linked to the English speaking world, 
powerful in global trading bodies. The Leave message should be optimistic, 
daring and broad ...

Voters are concerned about Britain losing control of its own policy, but when 
asked what aspect of control they are most concerned about, overwhelmingly they 
answer immigration. Their grasp of what the EU’s other powers and structures 
may be is, let’s just say, weak.

Yet many of Carswell’s Vote Leave allies don’t actually believe in strong 
immigration controls at all. They are free marketeers who see the benefits of 
free movement of workers ...

This is the great advantage of the Leave.EU campaign. It appreciates the 
centrality of immigration to the case for quitting. It has a very different 
outlook from the Carswell-Hannan group. It is much more pessimistic, much more 
focused on what Britain has lost and stands to lose. It doesn’t want some new 
English-speaking, free market internationalism. How much better would that be 
than the EU? It thinks the EU is too newfangled, not too modern.

I’ve asked Number 10 to elaborate on why Erna Solderg, the Norwegian prime 
minister, thinks the “Norwegian option” won’t work for the UK if it leaves the 
EU. (See12.29pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b#block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b>
A spokeswoman said that Soldberg simply made that point in her talks with David 
Cameron. The spokeswoman said she could not say any more about Soldberg’s 
reasoning.

UPDATE: Downing Street have come back to me to say this is what Cameron said 
about the “Norway option” at PMQs in October last year.

Some people arguing for Britain to leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, although not all of them, have pointed 
out a position like that of Norway as a good outcome. I would guard strongly 
against that. Norway pays as much per head to the EU as we do and takes twice 
as many migrants per head as we do in this country, but has no seat at the 
table and no ability to negotiate. I am not arguing that all those who want to 
leave the EU say that they want to follow the Norwegian path, but some do and 
it is very important that we are clear in this debate about the consequences of 
these different actions.

On the World at One Daniel Mitov, the Bulgarian foreign minister, said 
Bulgarians living in Britain were worried about the proposals in the draft EU 
renegotiation. He said that the negotiations were still going on, and that 
there was a need for some “polishing”, particularly in terms of how the 
emergency brake would work. But, despite being twice asked if Bulgaria was 
threatening to veto the plans, he declined to make that threat. Bulgaria wanted 
to see a reasonable compromise, he said.
 
As Nicholas Watt reports in the Guardian today, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/03/boris-johnson-near-agreement-with-cameron-over-eu-deal>
 David Cameron has said that the government will introduce some measure to 
assert the sovereignty of parliament. This will happen alongside the EU 
renegotiation, and will particularly appeal to Boris Johnson, the Conservative 
MP and mayor of London who has been calling for this for some time.

In his story, Nick says two options are being considered.

A few hours later, after the exchanges in the House of Commons, it became 
clear that the prime minister is prepared to deal with Johnson’s concerns on 
two levels. The prime minister is expected to:

 * Declare that the UK supreme court or another official body should be vested 
with powers akin to those of the German constitutional court, which has the 
right to assess whether legal acts by the EU’s institutions remain within the 
scope of the powers of the EU. Cameron first floated this idea ina speech at 
Chatham House in November 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-europe> after 
Johnson had outlined in a private plea to the prime minister to his calls for 
an assertion of parliamentary sovereignty 
 * Propose a possible fresh act of parliament to make clear that the UK’s 
agreement to the primacy of EU law – which dates back to 1972 – was gifted by 
parliament and could therefore be withdrawn by parliament. 
In the Times today (paywall) 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4682249.ece> Lord Neuberger
, president of the supreme court, said setting up an alternative constitutional 
court would be a mistake. He told the paper:

One of our great advantages compared with most of Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is that we have a very simple 
system of courts and I think replicating the civil, European system of having a 
supreme court and a constitutional court — a supreme administrative court — is 
just a recipe for complication, for cost and for unnecessary duplication.

And Lord Pannick QC, the prominent human rights lawyer, told the paper that 
giving the supreme court a constitutional role would be pointless.

For our supreme court to be given a function similar to that of the German 
constitutional court would not have any practical effect. The proposal has no 
legal merit. It may have a useful political purpose for the government, but the 
prime minister should be careful about raising expectations that will not be 
achievable.

Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, was asked about this on the World at 
One. When the comments in the Times were put to him he insisted that it was 
worth clarifying the position of UK law in relation to EU law.

There’s always been a discussion about constitutional precedence here, which 
law take precedence. I’m not a lawyer, but I’ve read a lot of stuff about this 
and there are a lot of very eminent lawyers saying that there are ways to 
address this issue; maybe not the perfect solution, but there are ways to 
assert the supremacy of our parliament and to give us a much stronger position 
than we have had in the past. And I think as this discussion goes forward we 
will want to see these ideas discussed and explained in full.

Hammond also hit back at David Davis, rejecting his claim that the emergency 
brake “would not stop a push bike”. (See 9.42am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b319b5e4b0fcd5ab7d50f5#block-56b319b5e4b0fcd5ab7d50f5>

I think David Davis is wrong and, frankly, those people who are not looking 
for a good deal with Europe but are looking to argue for Britain to leave 
Europe, and whatever the package contained would be looking for Britain to 
leave Europe, are obviously going to attack whatever the package contains. But 
it does contain significant measures that will change the way theEuropean Union

The Leave.EU campaign has hit back at the suggestion from the Norwegian prime 
minister, Erna Soldberg, that the “Norway option” could not work for the UK. 
(See12.29pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/04/camerons-emergency-brake-will-do-nothing-to-cut-immigration-says-alan-johnson-politics-live?page=with:block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b#block-56b3417de4b070635986d97b>
 A spokesman said that it was not true to say that, if Britain were in EFTA and 
the EEA but outside the EU like Norway, it would have no say in drafting EU 
rules.

There is an enormous network of discussion and consultation even within 
EFTA/EEA, on a global and regional level, long before these rules ever get near 
a statute book. The UK would be an active part of this network, along with over 
190 international bodies.

EEA/EFTA representatives participate in over 500 committees and expert groups 
involved in what is known as “decision shaping” at single market level. Above 
EU level, EEA/EFTA representatives have their own seats on many global bodies 
which we cannot as EU member states.
 
 * Number 10 has rejected a claim from Alan Johnson, chair of the Labour In 
For Europe campaign, that the “emergency brake” allowing the UK to stop EU 
migrants getting in-work benefits for up to four years will have no impact on 
immigration. Johnson made the claim in an interview on the Today programme.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/04/benefits-limit-sideshow-europe-alan-johnson-labour>
But the prime minister’s spokesman told journalists at the Number 10 lobby 
briefing that it would make a difference. Migrant families were able to claim 
£6,000 a year on average in tax credits, he said: 
I think common sense would tell us that reducing the financial incentive will 
reduce that pull factor.

As the Press Association reports, the spokesman was also unable to say whether 
migrants from wealthier EU states, such as Luxembourg, might end up receiving 
more generous child benefit payments than their British neighbours under the 
plan to give them child benefit at their home country rate, not the UK rate.

would not work for the UK if it leaves the EU, Number 10 has said.(See 12.29pm.)

 Responding to an urgent question about the meetings, Home Office minister 
Karen Bradleysaid the government “condemns in the strongest terms anyone who 
condones rape and sexual violence or suggests that responsibility for stopping 
these crimes rests with the victims”. Responding to calls for him to be banned 
from the UK, Bradley said that the Home Office did not routinely comment on 
individual cases, but that the home secretary could ban non-British citizens if 
she believes their presence is “not conducive to the public good”. 
 * The Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox QC has been told to apologise to the House

David Cameron met Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister, in Number 10 
last night. Mostly they were talking about the Syria conference, but Cameron’s 
EU renegotiation also came up.Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway> 
is not in the EU, but it gets access to the single market through its 
membership of the European Free Trade Association. This means it has to submit 
to what is anachronistically referred to as “government by fax” because it has 
to comply with EU rules without having a say in how they are drawn up.

According to Number 10, Solberg said this would not be a good arrangement for 
the UK. This is from the readout of the meeting that Downing Street has just 
sent to journalists. A Downing Street spokesperson said:

[Cameron and Solberg] also discussed the prime minister’s work to win a 
renegotiated package for the UK in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. Prime Minister Solberg said she 
supported the prime minister’s work to build a more flexible EU and to cut red 
tape. She also agreed with the prime minister that Norway’s position in the 
European Free Trade Area but outside the EU would not work for the UK.

Solberg’s comments - at least, her comments as mediated through Number 10 - 
are significant because one of the challenges for those campaigning for Britain 
to leave the EU is explaining what its future trading relationship with the EU 
would be like. Often they cite “the Norway option”, but Cameron now has a new 
argument to deploy against that.

Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in Wales, will say in a speech 
later today that his party would cut ministerial salaries in the Welsh assembly 
by 10%. They would use the savings to encourage young people to get involved in 
politics through a national children and young people’s assembly for Wales.

After May the Welsh first minister’s salary is due to rise to £140,000, with 
other ministers’ pay rising to £100,000, and Davies says his proposal would 
save around £250,000 over five years.
