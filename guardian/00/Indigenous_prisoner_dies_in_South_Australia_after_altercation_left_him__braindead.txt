An Indigenous man has died after an apparent altercation involving prison 
guards at a South Australian jail.

Police say the 29-year-old man, known only as Mr Morrison for cultural 
reasons, died early on Monday morning at the Royal Adelaide hospital where he 
hadbeen in a serious condition since Friday

.

It was alleged the man was involved in an altercation with five guards at the 
Yatala labour prison on Friday while waiting for a scheduled court video link 
appearance, correctional services minister Peter Malinauskas said.

It is understood Morrison was then taken back to the maximum security area of 
the prison, when he suffered a medical episode, believed to be a cardiac arrest.

The man’s sister Latoya Rule disputed the allegation, saying her brother, who 
was barely 1.5m tall, “was a nonviolent fisherman and artist”.

Rule said her brother had been denied medical attention in custody, telling 
Nine NewsAdelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> that he 
was “quite dehydrated, wanted medical attention, medical care”. That has not 
been confirmed by authorities.

Morrison’s family said he had been misrepresented in the media, saying he had 
never been to jail

 before being taken to Yatala prison on 17 September.

Major crime detectives are investigating the incident and police are also 
preparing a report for the coroner.

Malinauskas said he had not been advised of the exact cause of the man’s 
death. But he said he had “100% confidence” SA police investigators would do 
everything they could to find out exactly what happened.

“I have already been advised by the police commissioner that Sapol are putting 
substantial resources into this so we do find out exactly what did take place,” 
he told ABC radio on Monday.

“I as much as anybody am very keen to make sure that we do that, so that if 
people have acted in a way that isn’t appropriate they can be held to account, 
and we can do everything we can to make sure we don’t see deaths like this into 
the future.”

He said two of the five prison guards involved in the incident suffered 
serious injuries, including facial fractures, but all had since been discharged 
from hospital.

“I do, no doubt, feel for them in the fact that they are going to be subject 
to an enormous amount of scrutiny, as is appropriate, so let’s just wait and 
see what the outcome of these investigations are,” he said.

He said there was no information suggesting that overcrowding at the prison 
contributed to the violent incident.

The South Australian Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement deputy chair, Tauto 
Sansbury, said the man’s family and his group had been kept “completely in the 
dark” over key details.

“The family has been basically locked out of seeing the young lad, at the 
first instance when he was at the hospital,” he told ABC radio.

Malinauskas said no information was being covered up to protect people.

“I completely reject any suggestion that somehow there is a conspiracy to 
cover up or not disclose information here,” he said.

The Department of Corrections chief executive, David Brown, said the death 
would also be subject to a coronial inquiry.

“I want to reiterate that any death in custody is of deep concern and I again 
want to extend my condolences to the family of the deceased,” Brown said in a 
statement on Thursday.

On Monday Rule said she was “broken” by her brother’s death.

“We said goodbye to my brother early this morning,” she posted on Facebook. “I 
walked from the hospital to the steps of parliament and just sat there all 
morning till the sun came up...

“I though [sic] that maybe I had the courage to stay until Jay Weatherill came 
out and could ask for justice...but I just ended up breaking down.

“I can’t be strong. I am broken. We are broken.
