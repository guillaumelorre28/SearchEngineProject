Go rock fishing 

Many of Tobago's coves and beaches are separated by outcrops harbouring rock 
pools and forming barriers where frothy breakers crash. At low tide, you can 
fish among the rocks with equipment as simple as a piece of string or fishing 
line with crabmeat, or other bait, hooked on the end. You'll see children 
braving the rocks to catch crabs and small fish – talk to them to get the 
lowdown and be sure to wear shoes with grip because the rocks are slippery. A 
good place to go rock fishing isMount Irvine Beach

Watch the boats at Buccoo

The heartbeat of this sleepy village is a small dock and jetty from which 
fishermen set off at daybreak and return from mid-morning onwards. The vessels 
are typically small motorboats, deftly manoeuvred by their skippers to the edge 
of the jetty to unload, and then positioned back in their anchoring spots, 
where they bob on the tide. Much of the fish caught here ends up on plates at 
El Pescador, the restaurant that overlooks the harbour (see below). Some of it 
ends up in the stomachs of the cartoon-like pelicans that cruise the skies 
before picking their target. If you want to try your hand at catch-and-release 
fishing for tuna, marlin or sailfish, five miles off the coast, Brandon Bruce 
runs excursions from Fish Tobago guesthouse inBuccoo

, you will also see fishermen pulling in seine nets, as they have for around 
150 years. The men are friendly veterans, very likely to hand you a herring or 
two from their bulging nets. If handouts aren't forthcoming, you can always buy 
directly from them (you shouldn't have to pay more than £1 a fish).

Eat fresh fish at El Pescador restaurant, Buccoo

Set almost opposite Buccoo's jetty, El Pescador restaurant has panoramic views 
across the harbour of this pretty fishing village. Get here at lunchtime to see 
fishing boats bringing back full lobster nets and hauls of snapper while you 
eat seafood prepared by Venezuelan chef Leo Larios. Some main courses are 
simply listed as "grilled fish" because Leo will cook whatever has just arrived.

Hear the calls of Tobago fish vans

Listen out for fish vans passing through the villages of Tobago in the 
morning, selling their wares. The fishmonger will often call out his catch on a 
loudspeaker as he drives through. Among the names you might hear bellowed is 
carite, a wonderful silver fish, cut into chunky steaks, seasoned and baked 
like salmon – locals will demand the head or tail, leaving you with the 
succulent fleshy parts. You may also hear "fry-dry" announced: sardines that 
have been cooked in a spicy sauce, rolled in breadcrumbs and fried.

Enjoy just-caught fish at Tobago Paradise Travel & Grill, Pigeon Point

This traditional fisherman's hut was converted into a restaurant in 2012 by 
Lynette and Allan Grant, and has quickly become renowned for its really fresh 
seafood. The setting is charming: you eat on a veranda overhanging the sea at
Pigeon Point 
<https://maps.google.com/maps?q=11.163245,+-60.83868&hl=en&sll=11.195663,-60.795465&sspn=0.016692,0.026114&t=m&z=17>
, the tide lapping beneath. Rustic fishing huts line this coastal road, some 
converted into gift shops, some still housing boats, oars and equipment. The 
views out to sea are divine, with fishing boats coming and going. The 
restaurant opens for brunch from 10.30am to ensure customers get the freshest 
catch, seasoned and thrown straight on the grill.

Go spearfishing
 Photograph: Ron Dahlquist/Getty Images/Perspectives 
The crystal-clear seas of the Caribbean are perfect for free-dive 
spearfishing. The authentic way is to snorkel in reefs and shallow waters with 
a spear gun, snorkel, mask and fins. Hold your breath and descend to the seabed 
looking for your prey – barracuda, cavalli and numerous types of jack – among 
the coral. Spear them with a barbed dart and get back to the surface quickly. 
It's an activity for the adventurous. You could also see parrot fish, tiger 
sharks, reef sharks and hammerhead sharks – which are very rarely dangerous to 
humans. The best places to spearfish are The Shallows, near the southern tip of 
Crown Point, or around St Giles Island, near the northern tip of 
Charlotteville. Braver folk can try their hand at blue-water spearfishing in 
the deep, using larger guns and searching for big pelagic fish. Some operators 
offer scuba-diving equipment rather than snorkels.

Take a fishing trip from Charlotteville

This pretty village is one of Tobago's main fishing hubs. Commercial fishing 
tours are available here, but to get an authentic experience, arrange a trip 
with a local fisherman. You'll meetCharlotteville

 fishermen at bars or cafes along the shore, playing chess and dominoes once 
their day's work is over. You can negotiate a price for a day or half-day out 
in a small boat taking four or five people – most excursions go in search of 
wahoo, kingfish, tuna and mahi-mahi (known locally as dolphinfish). Try 
bottom-line fishing, also known as "banking", a type of deepwater fishing with 
the line weighted and let out to the bottom of the ocean. You can arrange such 
excursions with Junior Murray, a very experienced fisherman whose day job is 
repairing motorboats, but whose passion is bottom-line fishing. On a trip with 
him, you are likely to catch snapper, grouper, amber jacks and sharks.

Cast a fly

There's plenty of potential for coastal fly-fishing in Tobago, although the 
sport is not common here. The best places for it are off jetties, around which 
snook and ladyfish look for smaller fish on which to prey.Pigeon Point 
<https://maps.google.com/maps?q=11.163245,+-60.83868&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&hnear=0x8c49b3eafac22363:0x6c583a4a4522be7e,11.163245,+-60.83868&t=m&z=17>

Visit Castara fish market

Almost every morning, Castara 
<https://maps.google.com/maps?q=11.27909,+-60.69088&hl=en&sll=11.323362,-60.539861&sspn=0.033369,0.052228&t=m&z=14>
 hosts a lively fish market, set back from the beach over a small bridge. Most 
of the fish is caught, early in the day, in seine nets, which are cast out to 
sea and pulled back filled with the mackerel and herring that congregate near 
the shore. Visitors are welcome to help the fishermen pull in the net, for 
which they may be rewarded with fresh fish. It is laborious work – pulling in a 
net can take up to an hour. Once the catch arrives at the market, vendors clean 
and gut the fish, and prepare them for cooking on the spot. It's a holistic 
experience watching fish being caught, prepared, sold and grilled – and then 
eating it.
