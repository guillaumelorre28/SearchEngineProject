Diana Henry’s chicken with leeks, apples and cider 

This is my partner’s favourite dish (and the first thing I ever cooked for 
him) so it’s quite special to me. Perfect comfort food. Although it could just 
as easily come from Cornwall or Devon (because of the cider), it really takes 
me to Normandy.

Serves 4
chicken 8 thighs, skin on, bone in, or a mixture of joints
salt and pepper
unsalted butter 40g
leeks 700g
dessert apples 2
plain flour 1 tbsp
dry cider 500ml
thyme 6 sprigs, plus leaves from 2 more sprigs to serve
double cream 150ml
caster sugar 1 tsp

Season the chicken pieces and heat 25g of the butter in a large saute pan (one 
which has a lid) or a wide casserole. Brown the chicken on both sides and then 
set the pieces aside while you cook the leeks. (Make sure not to burn the 
butter.)

Remove the tough outer leaves from the leeks. Trim the bases and cut off the 
tough, very dark leaves at the top. Wash the leeks really well, making sure 
that you get rid of any soil that is lodged in them. Cut into about 3cm 
lengths. Add the leeks to the fat in the pan in which you cooked the chicken 
and saute without browning for about 10 minutes; they should soften but not 
become sloppy.

Meanwhile, peel one of the apples, halve and cut into wedges. Melt the 
remaining butter in a small frying pan and gently brown the wedges on each 
side. Leave until you need them.

Add the flour to the leeks and turn them over in the juices. Continue to cook 
for a couple of minutes. Take the pan off the heat and slowly add the cider, 
stirring all the time. Return to the heat, bring to the boil, then add the 
chicken, sprigs of thyme and the sauteed apple (don’t wash the apple pan).

Immediately reduce the heat to a simmer, put the lid on and leave to cook over 
a low heat for about 35 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through, with no 
trace of pink.

Lift the chicken pieces out of the casserole and simmer the cooking juices 
until reduced by about one-third. Add the cream, bring to the boil and cook for 
a couple of minutes.

Peel and cut the other apple into wedges and put in the frying pan in which 
you cooked the first apple. Saute gently, adding the caster sugar to help the 
slices caramelise nicely on the outside.

Cook until the apple slices are tender. Return the chicken to the sauce and 
heat gently. At the last minute, add the newly sautéed apples, sprinkle with 
the thyme leaves and serve.

 Quail and curried eggs. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer 
Serves 6
For the grilled quail
quail 6
coriander seeds 1 tbsp
black peppercorns 20
cardamom pods 12
cloves 1 tsp
cumin seeds 1 tsp
curry powder 1 tsp
salt 1 tsp
butter 60g, melted
fresh ginger 30g, finely chopped
olive oil
fried coconut ½ quantity (see below)

For the fried coconut
light vegetable oil 2 tbsp
garlic 4 cloves, finely chopped
spring onions 4, finely chopped (including green tops)
ground coriander 1 tsp
ground cumin 1 tsp
desiccated coconut 140g
salt a pinch

For the quail eggs in coconut sauce
ground turmeric 2 tsp
garlic 4 cloves, finely chopped
ground coriander 2 tsp
ground ginger 1 tsp
ground cumin 1 tsp
onions 400g, finely chopped
lemongrass 1 stick (tender part only), finely chopped
tomatoes 400g, peeled, seeded and chopped
coconut milk 235ml
lemon juice 1 tbsp
fried coconut 1 tbsp (see above)
quail eggs 12, hardboiled, peeled

To prepare the quail, cut off the first wing joint and drop it into a bowl. 
Cut off the head and neck, if still attached, and add to the bowl. Remember, do 
not cut the neck skin too close to the body as the skin will shrink on contact 
with the heat, exposing some of the breast meat, which will dry quickly. Gently 
push the neck back from the breast and find the wishbone, which is embedded in 
the breast flesh. Work around each curve of the wishbone with a small sharp 
knife, especially around the join of the 2 arcs. Feel the shape of the wishbone 
with your fingers and ease it out; drop it into the bowl. Cut off the feet (if 
still present) and add to the bowl.

Using kitchen scissors, cut up the back of the bird either side of the 
backbone right through to the neck opening. Drop the backbone into the bowl. 
Open out the bird, skin-side down, and remove the heart and liver (if still 
present)and add to the bowl. Rinse the bird under cold water, then pat it dry 
with kitchen paper and put it on a plate. Wash and dry your chopping board well 
and return the bird to the board, skin uppermost. Press firmly on the 
breastbone of the bird to flatten it further (this technique of splitting and 
flattening a small bird is known as “spatchcocking”). Either refrigerate or 
leave at room temperature for up to 1 hour until you are ready to cook the bird.

To make the fried coconut, heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Fry the 
garlic and spring onion for 1-2 minutes. Add the spices, then coconut and salt. 
Lift and stir really well to mix flavours, and cook until the coconut is a rich 
brown. Allow to cool completely, then store for up to a week in a screw-top 
jar. To freshen, tip the required quantity into a dry frying pan and stir until 
warmed through.

To make the grilled spiced quail, grind all spices to a powder and mix with 
the salt, butter and ginger. Work 1 teaspoon of the spice paste under the skin 
over entire breast surface of each bird. Smooth the skin back into place, 
tucking it over the neck edge. Rub a little paste over the legs and the bony 
inside of each bird. Reserve the remaining paste. Brush the birds with a little 
oil.

To grill, place the birds flesh-side to heat and grill for 8 minutes. Turn and 
briefly seal the skin side for no more than 1 minute, otherwise the spice paste 
will burst through skin. Prick the thickest part of the thigh to see if the 
juice runs clear. If undercooked, return to the grill, flesh-side to the heat 
source for 2 minutes. Remove the quail to a heated plate for 5 minutes, then 
bone them. Spoon over a little reserved spice paste and turn the quails in it. 
Serve scattered with fried coconut. I like to offer Indian pickled limes or a 
wedge of fresh lime also.

To make the quail eggs in coconut sauce, cook all the ingredients, except the 
eggs, over a moderate heat for 20 minutes. Stir from time to time to prevent 
sticking. Add the eggs and cook for 10 minutes. This dish can be made the day 
before and gently reheated. Serve with the grilled quail.

 Grouse and Co: ‘A flourish of watercress and all is in readiness’. Photograph: 
Martin Poole for the Observer 
Buy the grouse intact if you can, this delivers the finest result. The term 
applied to this is long-legged, which means plucked but not drawn. There is a 
challenging chore necessary here which is to carefully remove the intestines 
leaving the livers and heart attached within the resulting cavity. To do this, 
put on a pair of rubber gloves, snip the bottom and pull the intestine out (you 
may need to insert a small knife). The time-honoured request to a butcher or a 
game dealer accompanied by a winning smile may help dispatch this task.

The feet may be removed or wrapped in tin foil, the bird roasted and the foil 
removed to add nobility to the serving, especially if each bird is sat upon a 
crouton of bread upon a great platter.

Serves 2 greedy trenchermen
For the grouse
young grouse 2, long-legged if possible
unsalted butter 100g

For the croute
bread 2 slices, the size of your palm
butter to spread

For the pounded heart and liver
grouse heart and liver
Madeira 1 tsp
brandy 1 tsp
butter 25-30g

For the bread sauce
best milk 250ml
onions 2 small
cloves 3
bay leaves 3
mace 1 piece
white bread 60g, crusts removed
nutmeg a last little scrape or two

For the breadcrumbs
white bread 80g, crusts removed
unsalted butter 25g
sherry 50ml

For the game chips
waxy potatoes 2 large, King Edward or a Desiree perhaps
vegetable oil
salt and pepper

To serve
redcurrant, crab apple or medlar jelly
watercress

Preheat the oven to 240C/gas mark 9 (or as hot as your oven will go). The 
shock of heat is vital for cooking game well. If the birds are intact, with 
care, cover the feet with tin foil. Smother each bird in butter and liberally 
season all over. Place the birds on a roasting tray and put into the heated 
oven.

Cook for 8 minutes undisturbed then lift from the oven and baste swiftly with 
the buttery goodness accrued in the bottom of the pan. Return to the oven and 
cook for a further 8-12 minutes until the birds offer the merest resilience 
when prodded. Remove the birds from the oven and then from the roasting tray 
and let them rest in a warm spot.

To make the croute, put the roasting pan on a gentle heat. Lightly butter the 
slices of bread and lay in the pan, then move swiftly over the pan to ensure 
much grouse permeates the bread. Let this fry gently until crisp and browned 
thoroughly.

Once the grouse is rested, pluck out the heart and the liver. Mash these with 
a fork and add the Madeira, brandy, salt and pepper. Add the butter and mash 
again. Spread this upon the croute and sit the bird atop. Spoon over any 
remaining goodness in the pan.

To make the bread sauce, pour the milk into a heavy bottomed pot.

Peel the onions and chop coarsely. Add these to the pot with the cloves, bay 
leaves and mace. Place the pot on a gentle heat and let warm through thoroughly 
without boiling. Take off the heat, cover the pot and let the infused milk 
stand for 10-20 minutes.

Cut the bread into large pieces and place into another saucepan.

Pour the infused milk through a strainer and then return to a very gentle 
heat. A double boiler is rather handy here. Once the milk is warm, stir well 
and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Pour the resulting strained warm milk 
over the bread. Cover and keep warm.

For the breadcrumbs, warm a frying pan on a gentle heat. Add in the butter and 
when melted, add in the breadcrumbs. Mix well and when the crumbs rise in a 
buttery froth, gently agitate and repeat often until the crumbs are coloured 
gold. Add in the sherry and step back. Agitate the pan further and ensure the 
contents are mixed well. Ensure the sherry has been cooked fully and when the 
crumbs have acquired an excellent crunch, season with a pinch of salt and 
pepper, remove from the heat and tip into a bowl. Dab away any excess butter. 
Keep warm.

To make the game chips, peel and slice the potatoes paper thin. Wash the 
slices thoroughly until the water runs clear. Drain and dry well.

Heat a heavy bottomed pan with about 6-7cm of vegetable oil within. When hot, 
lay in the slices of potato carefully, stir gently and let cook, moving them 
slightly until golden brown. Spoon out the crisps and lay upon some paper to 
drain. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Keep warm.

Now all that is required is to place the bird on its crouton spread with the 
liver and heart onto a handsome plate. Decant the bread sauce into a lovely 
bowl, likewise the jelly and breadcrumbs. Perhaps a flourish of watercress and 
all is in readiness.

 Moules marinieres: ‘Every time I cook this, I think of the past,’ says Rick 
Stein. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer 
There was a time, long ago, when a bowl of moules marinières and a glass of 
Muscadet, in Brittany, was to me simply the most exotic thing. You couldn’t get 
mussels in Britain unless you picked them yourself off the rocks. Every time I 
cook this, I think of the past.


Serves 4
mussels 1.75kg, cleaned
unsalted butter 50g
onion 1 medium, finely chopped
dry white wine 50ml
parsley 1 tbsp, coarsely chopped

To clean the mussels, wash under plenty of cold running water. Discard any 
that are open and won’t close up when lightly squeezed. Pull out the tough 
fibrous beards or “byssus” protruding from between the tightly closed shells.


Knock off any barnacles with a large knife and give the mussels another quick 
rinse to remove any little bits of shell.

Put the cleaned mussels, butter, onion and white wine into a very large pan. 
Cover and cook over a high heat for 3-4 minutes, shaking the pan every now and 
then, until the mussels have opened.

Spoon the mussels into bowls. Add the parsley to the remaining juices, then 
pour all but the last tablespoon or two, which might contain some grit, back 
over the mussels.

 Amarone and radicchio risotto. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer 
Serves 4
good chicken stock 1.5 litres
butter 50g
onion 1, chopped very very finely
superfine carnaroli rice 400g
Amarone 200ml, plus a little extra for serving (optional)
radicchio 1, chopped, plus 4 tips of leaves per person
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the mantecatura
butter around 75g, cold, cut into small pieces
parmesan cheese around 100g, grated (plus a little extra for serving, if you
like)

Bring your pot of stock to the boil, close to where you are going to make your 
risotto, turn down the heat and keep at a light simmer.

Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed pan, and add the chopped onion. Cook 
gently until softened, but not coloured (about 5 minutes).

Add the rice and stir around to coat in the butter and “toast” the rice. Make 
sure all the grains are warm, then add the Amarone.

Let the wine evaporate completely, until the onions and rice are dry. Add the 
chopped radicchio.

Start to add the stock, a ladleful or two at a time, stirring and scraping the 
rice in the pan as you do so. When each addition of stock has almost 
evaporated, add the next ladleful. If the colour of the risotto isn’t as 
intensely pinky-red as you would like, add a little more wine.

Carry on cooking for about 15-17 minutes, adding stock continuously. After 
about 12-14 minutes, slow up the addition of stock, so that the rice doesn’t 
become too wet and soupy at this stage.

The risotto is ready when the grains are soft, but still al dente. Now you 
should add the tips of the leaves you kept aside.

Turn down the heat, rest the risotto for a minute, then (for the mantecatura) 
with a wooden spoon, vigorously beat in the cold diced butter and finally the 
Parmesan – making sure you shake the pan energetically at the same time as you 
beat. Season to taste.
