Australia's Alicia Molik delighted the home crowd by winning her first Grand 
Slam title with Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova in the women's doubles in 
Melbourne.

The pair, playing their first tournament together, defeated Americans Lindsay 
Davenport and Corina Morariu in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena.

The win was sweet revenge for Molik, who saw her hopes of a home singles title 
disappear after a titanic quarter-final battle with Davenport.

"It's been emotional," she said.

In the mixed doubles semi-final, Australian duo Scott Draper and Samantha 
Stosur beat Israeli Andy Ram and Conchita Martinez 7-5, 6-3, while the 
quarter-final between Max Mirnyi and Martina Navratilova and Zimbabwe's Wayne 
and Cara Black saw the veteran and her partner win 7-5, 6-4.
