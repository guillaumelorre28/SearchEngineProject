The latest part of our history of modern music 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/series/a-history-of-modern-music> in the 
Guardian and Observer looks at 50 of the key moments in the history of dance 
music. It's a journey through sound that takes us fromDonna Summer 
<http://www.donnasummer.com/> to the second summer of love, from the Bee Gees to
Katy B <http://www.rinse.fm/katyb/>, all the while with that solid 
four-to-the-floor kick drum keeping time as the world learns how to dance to 
machines.

One of the themes that's emerged from listening to these records again is how 
much electronic dance music has been shaped by the journey from the underground 
to the mainstream and back again. Hopefully the playlist reflects that, with 
chart hits alongside tunes made in bedrooms. Even with 100 songs we didn't have 
room for, such asthis <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lidPp663Ilk>, it's been 
fun rewatching moments like this Top of the Pops introduction (at 3mins 48) and 
remembering how good12 minutes of a filthy kick 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbMyzRumH5c> can be.

With so many genres constantly splintering and shifting over the years, we're 
bound to have missed some out, so if you're a drill'n'bass/skweee

/moombahton fan disappointed that we've covered too much disco, house, techno, 
acid house, trance, rave, jungle, drum'n'bass, dubstep, garage, funky, minimal, 
wonky and donk â€¦ well, you know what to do here in the comment thread.
