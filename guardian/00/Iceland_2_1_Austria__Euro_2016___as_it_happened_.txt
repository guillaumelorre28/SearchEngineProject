That was truly bonkers, and what a crazy finish. So, Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have made history while Austria 
exit this summer’s European Championship, after registering just one point from 
three matches. Group winners Hungary and third-placed Portugal also prevail 
from Group F. Enjoy the rest of the day, and thanks for your company, emails 
and tweets. Bye!

“If you’d ask me twenty years ago or ten years ago whether Iceland would ever 
win a game at the European Championships, I would have laughed,” says Kári, via 
email. “Heck, if you’d asked me five years ago or two years ago, the response 
would have been the same. NowIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have booked a second round tie 
against England.”

So, next up for Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> is 
England on Monday in Nice.Until Traustason’s stoppage-time winner against 
Austria, it would have been Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal in the next round.

These are incredible scenes at the Stade de France. Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> supporters and players are 
mimicking each others vigorous clapping, before they both erupt in to wild 
celebrations. Austria, meanwhile, are quite literally on the floor. Dragovic, 
who missed the first-half penalty, is picked up off his feet by the Austria 
goalkeeper Almer.

Back to the winning goal, then. Austria threw everything they had into the box 
in search of a second themselves, but Iceland inflicted the suckerpunch with a 
textbook counterattack. It was 3 v1 in the Austria defence and the substitute 
Arnór Traustason, who plays for Austrian outfit Rapid Vienna, slid in to send 
the ball past Almer, after a burstingIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> run down the right flank. What 
an ending.

“The rules are indeed confusing,” emails Dave. “Actually, Portugal are ahead of
Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> on goals scored now, not 
on fair play.” It’s time to put away Uefa’s rulebook just for the time being 
but there’s still 15 minutes to play in both Group F matches.

72 min: Halldorson makes a fantastic save! Alaba finds Janko, who then threads 
through to theAustria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> substitute 
and goalscorer Schöpf, but Halldorson, who has only been a professional 
goalkeeper for two years, gets his legs in the way. Big save.

68 min: Huge chance for Janko! Sabitzer crosses, the giant striker 
nonchalantly steers his effort goalwards but it falls narrowly wide of 
Halldorson’s post. Great effort, but it’s not enough. Still 1-1.

65 min: Almer manages to keep Sigurdsson’s shot out. The Swansea midfielder 
hammers an effort goalwards but the goalkeeper beats it away. It’s end-to-end 
stuff, and proper tournament football, although it does feel like we’re in to

Portugal are up in to second as things stand, purely because of Uefa’s fair 
play rulings. Hungary have five points, Portugal and Iceland would both have 
three.Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have had six 
bookings but Portugal have had just two players booked. Pepe, of course, and 
Ricardo Quaresma. It all feels very cruel.

62 min: Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> are going for 
what is known as the juggler. Baumgartlinger chips the ball in to Arnautovic, 
but Ragnar Sigurdsson does superbly to shepherd the striker away from goal.

GOAL! Iceland 1-1 Austria (Schöpf 60)

The substitute weaves inside and out, just outside the box, before moving the 
ball on to his left foot and he drives the ball low to find an equaliser. The 
22-year-old has been a real spark since coming, and duly has found a reward for 
all his hard work.

57 min: Bödvarsson juggles the ball in to the box, after good work from his 
strike-partner, Sigthórsson. He eventually gets a shot away but his volley does 
not trouble Almer.

Iceland to face England in last 16 after dramatic late win over Austria

That was truly bonkers, and what a crazy finish. So, Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have made history while Austria 
exit this summer’s European Championship, after registering just one point from 
three matches. Group winners Hungary and third-placed Portugal also prevail 
from Group F. Enjoy the rest of the day, and thanks for your company, emails 
and tweets. Bye!

“If you’d ask me twenty years ago or ten years ago whether Iceland would ever 
win a game at the European Championships, I would have laughed,” says Kári, via 
email. “Heck, if you’d asked me five years ago or two years ago, the response 
would have been the same. NowIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have booked a second round tie 
against England.”
 
So, next up for Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> is 
England on Monday in Nice.Until Traustason’s stoppage-time winner against 
Austria, it would have been Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal in the next round.
 
These are incredible scenes at the Stade de France. Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> supporters and players are 
mimicking each others vigorous clapping, before they both erupt in to wild 
celebrations. Austria, meanwhile, are quite literally on the floor. Dragovic, 
who missed the first-half penalty, is picked up off his feet by the Austria 
goalkeeper Almer.

Back to the winning goal, then. Austria threw everything they had into the box 
in search of a second themselves, but Iceland inflicted the suckerpunch with a 
textbook counterattack. It was 3 v1 in the Austria defence and the substitute 
Arnór Traustason, who plays for Austrian outfit Rapid Vienna, slid in to send 
the ball past Almer, after a burstingIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> run down the right flank. What 
an ending.
 
The referee has blown his whistle, Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> are through to the round of 16 
and Austria are out!

90+4 min: Half of Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> are 
on the pitch, all of the bench are on the pitch, an incredible ending.
 
The smallest nation of the tournament are in the last 16!!!

90+3 min: Arnason gets it clear and Almer heads back towards his goal. 
 
90+2 min: Robert Almer, the Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> goalkeeper is up!
 
90+2 min: Jantscher does brilliantly to keep the ball in play, Fuchs then 
blasts at goal. Corner kick.
 
90+1 min: Austria steal the ball, Christian Fuchs crosses from the left but 
nobody can send it goalwards.Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have a goal kick and there are 
two minutes to play.
 
90 min: Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> win a throw 
deep inside Austria’s half. They are desperately trying to retain possession.
 
89 min: The fourth official, Mark Clattenburg, holds up his board to say there 
will be four added minutes.
 
89 min: It’s played short and the possession after comes to little more than a 
brief scare.
 
89 min: It’s nail-biting stuff. Corner for Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria>.
 
88 min: Janko is being man-marked, and man-marked again. Dragovic tries to 
find the striker but fails.Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> push forward once more with 
Hinteregger but his shot from distance is blocked.
 
87 min: Austria have just three minutes of their Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> left, unless they can find a 
late winner. Iceland have one big bank of eleven players behind the ball.
 
85 min: Theodor Bjarnason wins a clever foul on the left flank. Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>, then, make their final change. 
Sverrir Ingason is coming on in place of Johan Gudmundsson, who looks 
absolutely knackered. He needs a good lie down – or drink.
 
83 min: Danger averted, but Austria push forward once more. Only the 
goalkeeper Almer remains in theAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> half.
 
83 min: Traustason clears the ball for a Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> corner. The Stade de France is 
shaking wildly.
 
80 min: Traustason is on for Sigthórsson, presumably to inject some energy 
more than anything. Meanwhile, goalkeeper Halldorson has been booked for 
time-wasting. That’s eight yellow cards now forIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>.
 
80 min: A nasty clash of heads, just inside the Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> box, calms proceedings for a 
moment.
 
80 min: Alaba’s free-kick, after a silly Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> foul, forces Halldorson to tip 
the ball over. It’s a Austria corner.
 
79 min: Fair play watch: Iceland’s Arnason is booked. That’s their seventh in 
total in this European Championship.
 
77 min: Jakob Jantscher enters the fray in place of the impressive Sabitzer for
Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria>. He’ll be hoping to make 
a similar impact to the other substitutes at the Stade de France in Paris.
 
75 min: Iceland look a little weary. Austria are still trying to find a 
winner. Sabitzer and Schöpf look the most likely to find it.Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> are camped inside their own 
half. Can they hold on?
 
“The rules are indeed confusing,” emails Dave. “Actually, Portugal are ahead of
Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> on goals scored now, not 
on fair play.” It’s time to put away Uefa’s rulebook just for the time being 
but there’s still 15 minutes to play in both Group F matches.

 
72 min: Halldorson makes a fantastic save! Alaba finds Janko, who then threads 
through to theAustria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> substitute 
and goalscorer Schöpf, but Halldorson, who has only been a professional 
goalkeeper for two years, gets his legs in the way. Big save.
 
70 min: Austria’s fair play record takes a hit: Janko is booked for a foil on 
Sigurdsson.
 
“This is getting a little confusing,” emails Simon. “Tell me, can Scotland 
still qualify?”
 
68 min: Huge chance for Janko! Sabitzer crosses, the giant striker 
nonchalantly steers his effort goalwards but it falls narrowly wide of 
Halldorson’s post. Great effort, but it’s not enough. Still 1-1.

67 min: Austria are piling forward once more and Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have lost their cool.
 
65 min: Almer manages to keep Sigurdsson’s shot out. The Swansea midfielder 
hammers an effort goalwards but the goalkeeper beats it away. It’s end-to-end 
stuff, and proper tournament football, although it does feel like we’re in to 
the knockout rounds now.
 
Portugal are up in to second as things stand, purely because of Uefa’s fair 
play rulings. Hungary have five points, Portugal and Iceland would both have 
three.Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> have had six 
bookings but Portugal have had just two players booked. Pepe, of course, and 
Ricardo Quaresma. It all feels very cruel.
 
62 min: Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> are going for 
what is known as the juggler. Baumgartlinger chips the ball in to Arnautovic, 
but Ragnar Sigurdsson does superbly to shepherd the striker away from goal.
 
ANOTHER big goal elsewhere. It’s 3-3 between Hungary and Portugal. 
 
The substitute weaves inside and out, just outside the box, before moving the 
ball on to his left foot and he drives the ball low to find an equaliser. The 
22-year-old has been a real spark since coming, and duly has found a reward for 
all his hard work.

Fife/AFP/Getty Images  
57 min: Bödvarsson juggles the ball in to the box, after good work from his 
strike-partner, Sigthórsson. He eventually gets a shot away but his volley does 
not trouble Almer.
 
As it stands, Portugal would crash out, much to the disappointment of 
Cristiano Ronaldo. Hungary would top the group,Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> would be second. As it stands, 
as it stands, as it stands.
 
54 min: Who cares what’s happening here? Hungary have just gone 3-2 up against 
Portugal! No, in all seriousness, Sabitzer went close forAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria>, whose tails are up all of 
sudden.
