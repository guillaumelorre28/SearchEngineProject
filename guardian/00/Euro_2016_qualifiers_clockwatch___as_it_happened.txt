What a dramatic evening, and what a denouement to the Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> qualifying groups! The 
headlines, then...

In Group A, the Dutch are out after a farcical 3-2 defeat at home to the 
Czechs, though it mattered little in the end as ten-man Turkey beatIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> with a last-gasp free kick of 
exceptional quality Selcuk Inan. David Beckhamesque scenes, because Turkey go 
through automatically as the best third-place finishers at Hungary’s expense.

In Group B, Belgium are the new world number-one team, and winners of their 
group. Wales, pipped at the post, don’t seem to care too much.Bosnia-Herzegovina
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> claim the play-off 
place.

And in Group H, Norway looked like qualifying automatically before conceding 
two second-half goals in Italy. The Italians top the group,Croatia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia> snatch the second automatic 
berth, and Norway have to settle for the play-offs.

Congratulations and commiserations, depending on what mood you’re in as a 
result of all this.

HUGE GOAL! Turkey 1-0 Iceland (Selcuk Inan 89)

A free kick from 30 yards, out on the left, whipped into the left-hand side of 
the net. Not altogether dissimilar to Gary McAllister’s famous last-gasp winner 
for Liverpool against Everton at Goodison in 2001. That will sendTurkey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/turkey> to France as best third-placed 
team, at Hungary’s expense! And the Dutch are, of course, now out, having lost

GOAL! Italy 2-1 Norway (Graziano Pelle 82)

Norway were so close to Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> as group winners. Now they’re 
almost certainly going to drop to the play-offs. Such a thin line. Unless they 
can bounce back, they now need Malta to do them a big favour against Croatia.

GOAL! Holland 2-3 Czech Republic (Robin van Persie 83)

So this is rather interesting, huh? Van Persie scores at the correct end this 
time, an instinctive poke at a dropping ball down the inside-right channel, and 
into the bottom right. They still need two goals, and hope ten-man Turkey 
concede a winner toIceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>. But 
this is on! Sort of!

RED CARD! Gokhan Tore (Turkey 78)

An appalling studs-up challenge on Jón Dadi Bödvarsson’s lower leg, the 
Icelander’s foot planted on the ground. Bödvarsson will have done well to 
escape injury there. Meanwhile in other foul-play news, at 9.07pm I wrote that 
“Danny Blind, already on a yellow card, has taken to kicking folk willy nilly.” 
Here’s Rob Edwards: “This explains Holland’s problems perfectly. Here they are 
desperately trying to qualify and the manager is actively kicking opponents on 
the field.” Yes, just look what I did.

GOAL! Holland 1-3 Czech Republic (Klaas-Jan Huntelaar 70)

A corner from the right. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar heads down and into the bottom 
right. Could the greatest switcheroo in Euro qualification history (not 
counting Spain’s 12-1 win overMalta <https://www.theguardian.com/football/malta>
 in 1983, which denied the Dutch access to Euro 84 on goal difference) be on? 
Er, almost certainly not. But while there’s time, there’s hope!

GOAL! Belgium 1-0 Israel (Dries Mertens 64)

Mertens owed Belgium something after ludicrously missing an open goal from a 
couple of yards in the first half. Well, he’s repaid them, cutting in from the 
left and whizzing a low shot into the bottom left.Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> will be winning the group as 
things stand, but Wales have qualified for their first tournament since 1958, 
and they’re unlikely to get too upset about that.

Kuat, powering down the left channel, leans back and threads a shot into the

GOAL! Holland 0-3 Czech Republic (Robin van Persie 66 og)

Eh, well this really is it. And what a farce! The Dutch sent Van Persie on to 
score, and he’s done that, but in his own net. Jiří Skalák takes a free kick on 
the right - Blind gave away the foul, naturally, and the ball drops towards Van 
Persie, level with the left-hand post, ten yards out. He attempts to cushion a 
header back to Jeroen Zoet, but only manages to guide the ball into the bottom 
right, the keeper wrongfooted and his feet planted. That is beyond ludicrous. 
At least they’re crashing out in style. (See also Scotland.)

“Could it be that World Cup third-place-curse is back?” wonders Admir Pajic. 
“Sweden (1994), Croatia (1998) and Turkey (2002) had all failed to qualify for 
the following Euro after their big success. Of course, Germany didn’t care for 
that unwritten rule but it seems Holland might start a new sequence.” It’s 
almost a certainty. They’re pushing the ten men of theCzech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic> back at the Amsterdam 
ArenA, but not really causing the visitors too much bother. Time is not their 
friend. They need three goals in the final 25 minutes. And Danny Blind, already 
on a yellow card, has taken to kicking folk willy nilly. He’s testing the 
referee’s patience. Should he walk, that really will be it.

GOAL! Bulgaria 2-0 Azerbaijan (Dimitar Rangelov 56)

The only game tonight that means absolutely nothing looks to be going 
Bulgaria’s way. Rangelov makes it two for the home side, a header powered into

A half-chance for Van Persie, as a ball drops to him 12 yards out, level with 
the left-hand post. But he slips as he looks to sweep a volley goalwards, and 
the ball rolls apologetically to the Czech keeper Cech. But the Dutch, blessed 
with a numerical advantage now after the sending off, are on top. Depay comes 
at the Czechs down the left, soon after, only to lash a hopelessly excitable 
shot miles wide left and high. He’d worked himself a good position there, too.

RED CARD! Marek Suchy (Czech Republic)

Depay was chasing a long ball down the inside-right channel. He was going to 
get there ahead of Suchy, who slid in and upended the Manchester United paceman 
from behind. That’s a straight red. It’s not over quite yet for Holland!

GOAL! Cyprus 2-1 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Nestoras Mitidis 41)

Constantinos Makridis twists and turns down the right, fires in a low cross, 
and it’s turned in at the near post by Nestoras Mitidis.Cyprus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cyprus> have turned this around, and 
right now they’re in the play-off positions! Magnificent drama, and they’ve 
really capitalised on Bosnia-Herzegovina’s nervousness, which all stems from 
Begovic’s slapstick show a few minutes earlier.

Holland are in desperate trouble. So they’ve sent Robin van Persie on in Jairo 
Riedewald’s stead. The final roll of the dice.

GOAL! Holland 0-2 Czech Republic (Josef Sural 35)

The Dutch are done. Sural wriggles down the inside-left channel and pokes home 
from close range, beating a splayed Jeroen Zoet at his near post. They’ve made 
every Euro finals since 1988. Well, that run’s coming to an end now, unless 
something very dramatic unfolds in the next hour or so.

GOAL! Cyprus 1-1 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Konstantinos Charalambidis 32)

The Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begović is all over the place. First he drops a 
cross, and is extremely fortunate that the Cypriots can’t slot the loose ball 
into an empty net. But soon after he’s fumbling a simple shot, and Konstantinos 
Charalambidis taps home.

GOAL! Malta 0-1 Croatia (Ivan Perisic 25)

Croatia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia> are staying on Norway’s 
tail, though. They can still pip the Norwegians if Italy grab an equaliser. 
They need to win themselves, though, and Perisic’s deflected shot into the 
bottom right has set them in the right direction.

GOAL! Holland 0-1 Czech Republic (Pavel Kaderabek 24)

The Netherlands really are up against it now. Kaderabek cuts in from the right 
and his whipped shot gives the Czechs the lead, and the Dutch are on the brink.

GOAL! Cyprus 0-1 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Haris Medunjanin 13)

The first goal of the evening, and it’s a pearler! Medunjanin whistles a shot 
into the top left from the best part of 25 yards. As things stand, Wales’ 
conquerors of the weekend will be assured of the play-off spot.

But then the Dutch go up the other end. A low cross into the Czech box from 
the right, and Wesley Sneijder is free on the penalty spot. But he leans back 
and converts for some rugby union points. That’s no good at all.

A rare old atmosphere in the Amsterdam ArenA. The home fans making the most of 
European Championship action while they can. But the home side are already 
looking a little ragged. Jaroslav Plašil has just creamed a shot into the Dutch 
area from about 35 yards. Not short of confidence, then. The ball pinged around 
the area like one of Bally Manufacturing’s best. Dutch hearts in mouths before 
the thing’s hacked clear.

Of course, there’s one other biggie riding on tonight’s results. Here’s Jan 
Huyse to explain. “There are two big stories adding some spice to the 
Belgium-Israel game. Will Manchester City like the fact that Vincent Kompany 
starts? But more important: if Belgium wins they will be (on November 5) the 
next and newest number one on the Fifa World Ranking. They’d become the eighth 
(and smallest) country to make the number-one position in history (Spain, 
Brazil, Holland, Argentina, France, Germany and Italy are the other seven). In 
June 2007Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> was 71st. We 
all know the ranking is not very important, but the number-one club is a good 
one to be a member of.” If only this thing had been going in the 1880s. 
Scotland would have been all over it.

And there we go! Everyone’s kicked off! And within 40 seconds, Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> - who have to win to stand any 
chance of qualifying - should be leading against the Czechs. Anwar El Ghazi was 
found in acres down the right, on the edge of the area, but battered a panicked 
first-time shot straight at Petr Cech’s legs.

Hack Chatting Out Of Hat (No.348,987,298 in an infinite series): Seems I was 
playing it a bit fast and loose with the old italics in the preamble. For it’s 
only Bulgaria versus Azerbaijan that means absolutely nothing tonight. “Sorry 
to correct you, Scott,” - please, Benedek Szabó, be my guest, someone’s got to 
do it - “but Latvia versusKazakhstan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/kazakhstan> does have some bearing on 
qualification matters. In case of an away win, Turkey only need to beat Iceland 
in Istanbul to be the best third-placed team and snatch automatic qualification 
from Hungary. The thought of this scenario leaves a whole nation trembling so 
we’re all die-hard Latvia fans tonight. After 29 years of waiting it would be 
an unbearably cruel - though I must admit, most typical - way to end the 
campaign.”

Preamble

It’s the final night of the Euro 2016 qualifying groups! And  don’t worry, 
domestic football is back at the weekend it’s all to play for.

One automatic qualifying position is up for grabs. That’s in Group H, where 
Norway are currently in the box seat. If they win in Italy against the already 
qualified azzurri, they’re through to the finals too. But if they don’t,Croatia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia> can leapfrog them with a victory 
against the hapless Maltese.

Group B has already cashiered Belgium and Wales to France. But it’s a 
three-way tussle for the play-off spot. Bosnia-Herzegovina will grab it if they 
win in Cyprus. Israel must win in Belgium to have any hope themselves, but 
they’ll need Bosnia-Herzegovina to drop points in Cyprus. The Cypriots can get 
there if they beatBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> and Israel fail to 
achieve their goal in Belgium.

All good fun. But the big news could come in Group A, where the Netherlands 
are in grave danger of missing their first Euro finals since 1984.They need to 
beat theCzech Republic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic> 
tonight, and hope Turkey lose at home to Iceland. And even then, they’ll only 
be getting a play-off spot, the Czechs and Icelanders having already snaffled 
the automatic spots for themselves.

So here are tonight’s fixtures, which kick off at times various around the 
continent, but for the purposes of this Brit-based blog, get going at 7.45pm 
BST.The games that have no bearing on qualification matters this evening are in 
italics...

Group A: Turkey v Iceland, Netherlands v Czech Republic, Latvia v Kazakhstan
Group B: Cyprus v Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> v Israel, Wales v Andorra
Group H: Italy v Norway, Malta v Croatia, Bulgaria v Azerbaijan

It’s on!

What a dramatic evening, and what a denouement to the Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> qualifying groups! The 
headlines, then...

In Group A, the Dutch are out after a farcical 3-2 defeat at home to the 
Czechs, though it mattered little in the end as ten-man Turkey beatIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> with a last-gasp free kick of 
exceptional quality Selcuk Inan. David Beckhamesque scenes, because Turkey go 
through automatically as the best third-place finishers at Hungary’s expense.

In Group B, Belgium are the new world number-one team, and winners of their 
group. Wales, pipped at the post, don’t seem to care too much.Bosnia-Herzegovina
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> claim the play-off 
place.

And in Group H, Norway looked like qualifying automatically before conceding 
two second-half goals in Italy. The Italians top the group,Croatia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia> snatch the second automatic 
berth, and Norway have to settle for the play-offs.

Congratulations and commiserations, depending on what mood you’re in as a 
result of all this.

And so here are the final scores...

Group A: Turkey 1-0 Iceland, Netherlands 2-3 Czech Republic, Latvia 0-1 
Kazakhstan
Group B: Cyprus 2-3 Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina>, Belgium 3-1 Israel, 
Wales 2-0 Andorra
Group H: Italy 2-1 Norway, Malta 0-1 Croatia, Bulgaria 2-0 Azerbaijan
 
... a header into the bottom right denies Simon Mignolet a clean sheet.
 
A shot bobbled into the bottom right. And in the same group ...
 
A free kick from 30 yards, out on the left, whipped into the left-hand side of 
the net. Not altogether dissimilar to Gary McAllister’s famous last-gasp winner 
for Liverpool against Everton at Goodison in 2001. That will sendTurkey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/turkey> to France as best third-placed 
team, at Hungary’s expense! And the Dutch are, of course, now out, having lost 
3-2.
 
Hazard passes the ball into the bottom right from the edge of the area. Calm. 
Assured. Classy. What else do you expect from the new world number one team?
 
Norway were so close to Euro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> as group winners. Now they’re 
almost certainly going to drop to the play-offs. Such a thin line. Unless they 
can bounce back, they now need Malta to do them a big favour against Croatia.
 
So this is rather interesting, huh? Van Persie scores at the correct end this 
time, an instinctive poke at a dropping ball down the inside-right channel, and 
into the bottom right. They still need two goals, and hope ten-man Turkey 
concede a winner toIceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>. But 
this is on! Sort of!

An appalling studs-up challenge on Jón Dadi Bödvarsson’s lower leg, the 
Icelander’s foot planted on the ground. Bödvarsson will have done well to 
escape injury there. Meanwhile in other foul-play news, at 9.07pm I wrote that 
“Danny Blind, already on a yellow card, has taken to kicking folk willy nilly.” 
Here’s Rob Edwards: “This explains Holland’s problems perfectly. Here they are 
desperately trying to qualify and the manager is actively kicking opponents on 
the field.” Yes, just look what I did.
 
A lovely dipping free kick from a central position, 30 yards out, sent 
bouncing into the bottom left.Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> will surely win their group now 
at Wales’s expense. But more importantly, they’re heading for the world number 
one spot!
 
Norway were top of the group a minute ago. Now Florenzi’s goal has dropped 
them into the play-off spots!Croatia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia>, remember, are winning in Malta. 
And all of this is enough to see them through automatically. Wonderful tension.

A corner from the right. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar heads down and into the bottom 
right. Could the greatest switcheroo in Euro qualification history (not 
counting Spain’s 12-1 win overMalta <https://www.theguardian.com/football/malta>
 in 1983, which denied the Dutch access to Euro 84 on goal difference) be on? 
Er, almost certainly not. But while there’s time, there’s hope!
 
It’s been to and fro in Cyprus all right. An early lead for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cyprus went 2-1 up, and nowBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> are in charge again. 
Djuric heads a cross from the left down and into the bottom right. The play-off 
spot is theirs if they can hold on this time round.
 
Mertens owed Belgium something after ludicrously missing an open goal from a 
couple of yards in the first half. Well, he’s repaid them, cutting in from the 
left and whizzing a low shot into the bottom left.Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> will be winning the group as 
things stand, but Wales have qualified for their first tournament since 1958, 
and they’re unlikely to get too upset about that.

Kuat, powering down the left channel, leans back and threads a shot into the 
bottom right. Now then! Should Turkey take the lead at home againstIceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>, they’ll be in a position to 
qualify automatically as best third-placed team, denying Hungary. Hmm. Non-stop 
drama!
 
Eh, well this really is it. And what a farce! The Dutch sent Van Persie on to 
score, and he’s done that, but in his own net. Jiří Skalák takes a free kick on 
the right - Blind gave away the foul, naturally, and the ball drops towards Van 
Persie, level with the left-hand post, ten yards out. He attempts to cushion a 
header back to Jeroen Zoet, but only manages to guide the ball into the bottom 
right, the keeper wrongfooted and his feet planted. That is beyond ludicrous. 
At least they’re crashing out in style. (See also Scotland.)

Dunand/AFP/Getty Images  
“Could it be that World Cup third-place-curse is back?” wonders Admir Pajic. 
“Sweden (1994), Croatia (1998) and Turkey (2002) had all failed to qualify for 
the following Euro after their big success. Of course, Germany didn’t care for 
that unwritten rule but it seems Holland might start a new sequence.” It’s 
almost a certainty. They’re pushing the ten men of theCzech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic> back at the Amsterdam 
ArenA, but not really causing the visitors too much bother. Time is not their 
friend. They need three goals in the final 25 minutes. And Danny Blind, already 
on a yellow card, has taken to kicking folk willy nilly. He’s testing the 
referee’s patience. Should he walk, that really will be it.

 
Wales are now leading in Cardiff. Paul Doyle will give you the details of that 
one.

 Wales have the breakthrough as Aaron Ramsey scores. Photograph: Stu 
Forster/Getty Images  
The only game tonight that means absolutely nothing looks to be going 
Bulgaria’s way. Rangelov makes it two for the home side, a header powered into 
the top right. The 1994 World Cup seems an awful long time ago, doesn’t it.
 
A half-chance for Van Persie, as a ball drops to him 12 yards out, level with 
the left-hand post. But he slips as he looks to sweep a volley goalwards, and 
the ball rolls apologetically to the Czech keeper Cech. But the Dutch, blessed 
with a numerical advantage now after the sending off, are on top. Depay comes 
at the Czechs down the left, soon after, only to lash a hopelessly excitable 
shot miles wide left and high. He’d worked himself a good position there, too.
 
The second half is underway everywhere, except in Cardiff, where a serious 
injury to an Andorra player caused a long delay in the first half. Paul Doyle 
will fill you in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/oct/13/wales-v-andorra-euro-2016-qualifier-live>
. Meanwhile, in lieu of early second-half goals, here’s Alan: “I may be 
grasping at straws here but but does this mean that Scotland are now as good as 
Holland? That’s got to be progress!”
 
So here are the half-times. And the headlines as things stand: the Dutch are 
heading out; Turkey,Bosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> and Croatia have 
play-off places; and the group winners will be Czech Republic, Belgium and 
Norway. But there’s plenty of time for a few changes.

Group A: Turkey 0-0 Iceland, Netherlands 0-2 Czech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>, Latvia 0-0 Kazakhstan
Group B: Cyprus 2-2 Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgium 0-0 Israel, Wales 0-0 Andorra
Group H: Italy 0-1 Norway, Malta 0-1 Croatia, Bulgaria 1-0 Azerbaijan

Well this is quite the rollercoaster ride. A deep cross from the left, and 
Medunjanin, rushing in from the other flank, sweeps home with a gorgeous volley.
Bosnia-Herzegovina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> 
are back on terms, and back in the play-off spot!
 
Depay was chasing a long ball down the inside-right channel. He was going to 
get there ahead of Suchy, who slid in and upended the Manchester United paceman 
from behind. That’s a straight red. It’s not over quite yet for Holland!
 
Constantinos Makridis twists and turns down the right, fires in a low cross, 
and it’s turned in at the near post by Nestoras Mitidis.Cyprus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cyprus> have turned this around, and 
right now they’re in the play-off positions! Magnificent drama, and they’ve 
really capitalised on Bosnia-Herzegovina’s nervousness, which all stems from 
Begovic’s slapstick show a few minutes earlier.
 
Holland are in desperate trouble. So they’ve sent Robin van Persie on in Jairo 
Riedewald’s stead. The final roll of the dice.
 
The Dutch are done. Sural wriggles down the inside-left channel and pokes home 
from close range, beating a splayed Jeroen Zoet at his near post. They’ve made 
every Euro finals since 1988. Well, that run’s coming to an end now, unless 
something very dramatic unfolds in the next hour or so.

Bosnia-Herzegovina are still going through as things stand. But they would be 
feeling a lot more comfortable had Dries Mertens not just missed an open goal 
from six yards againstIsrael <https://www.theguardian.com/football/israel>. 
What a shank!
 
The Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begović is all over the place. First he drops a 
cross, and is extremely fortunate that the Cypriots can’t slot the loose ball 
into an empty net. But soon after he’s fumbling a simple shot, and Konstantinos 
Charalambidis taps home.

Cyprus. Photograph: Petros Karadjias/AP  
Croatia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia> are staying on Norway’s 
tail, though. They can still pip the Norwegians if Italy grab an equaliser. 
They need to win themselves, though, and Perisic’s deflected shot into the 
bottom right has set them in the right direction.
 
As things stand, Norway will be going through as Group H winners at Italy’s 
expense.

Netherlands’ goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet. Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP  
The Netherlands really are up against it now. Kaderabek cuts in from the right 
and his whipped shot gives the Czechs the lead, and the Dutch are on the brink.
 
From a corner on the right, Aleksandrov powers a header into the left-hand 
portion of the net. It doesn’t matter much, but a bullet header’s a bullet 
header, andBulgaria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bulgaria> celebrate 
accordingly.
 
To Belgium’s bid for the world No1 spot. A free kick for Israel just outside 
Belgium’s box, to the right of the D. Eran Zahavi curls it around the outside 
of the wall, and watches in horror as, having beaten the flailing Simon 
Mignolet, the ball crashes off the right-hand post. LuckyBelgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium>.
 
The first goal of the evening, and it’s a pearler! Medunjanin whistles a shot 
into the top left from the best part of 25 yards. As things stand, Wales’ 
conquerors of the weekend will be assured of the play-off spot.

Sakis Savvides/AFP/Getty Images  
But then the Dutch go up the other end. A low cross into the Czech box from 
the right, and Wesley Sneijder is free on the penalty spot. But he leans back 
and converts for some rugby union points. That’s no good at all.
 
A rare old atmosphere in the Amsterdam ArenA. The home fans making the most of 
European Championship action while they can. But the home side are already 
looking a little ragged. Jaroslav Plašil has just creamed a shot into the Dutch 
area from about 35 yards. Not short of confidence, then. The ball pinged around 
the area like one of Bally Manufacturing’s best. Dutch hearts in mouths before 
the thing’s hacked clear.
 
Of course, there’s one other biggie riding on tonight’s results. Here’s Jan 
Huyse to explain. “There are two big stories adding some spice to the 
Belgium-Israel game. Will Manchester City like the fact that Vincent Kompany 
starts? But more important: if Belgium wins they will be (on November 5) the 
next and newest number one on the Fifa World Ranking. They’d become the eighth 
(and smallest) country to make the number-one position in history (Spain, 
Brazil, Holland, Argentina, France, Germany and Italy are the other seven). In 
June 2007Belgium <https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> was 71st. We 
all know the ranking is not very important, but the number-one club is a good 
one to be a member of.” If only this thing had been going in the 1880s. 
Scotland would have been all over it.
 
And there we go! Everyone’s kicked off! And within 40 seconds, Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> - who have to win to stand any 
chance of qualifying - should be leading against the Czechs. Anwar El Ghazi was 
found in acres down the right, on the edge of the area, but battered a panicked 
first-time shot straight at Petr Cech’s legs.
 
Super Victor, though. Ian Copestake has been mulling things over. “Super 
Victor’s innate happiness may be derived from his innocence of things corporate 
and corrupt, for he is but a child ...

“Or that his Mum is from California ...

“or perhaps plainly and simply because he is a sociopath.”

Hack Chatting Out Of Hat (No.348,987,298 in an infinite series): Seems I was 
playing it a bit fast and loose with the old italics in the preamble. For it’s 
only Bulgaria versus Azerbaijan that means absolutely nothing tonight. “Sorry 
to correct you, Scott,” - please, Benedek Szabó, be my guest, someone’s got to 
do it - “but Latvia versusKazakhstan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/kazakhstan> does have some bearing on 
qualification matters. In case of an away win, Turkey only need to beat Iceland 
in Istanbul to be the best third-placed team and snatch automatic qualification 
from Hungary. The thought of this scenario leaves a whole nation trembling so 
we’re all die-hard Latvia fans tonight. After 29 years of waiting it would be 
an unbearably cruel - though I must admit, most typical - way to end the 
campaign.”

Team news anon, but first things first. Because watch out! The sinister Euro 
2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> mascot Super Victor is 
currently roaming around London. Here he is, jumping the gates at Olympia, 
where an exhibition dedicated to licensing and brand extension is being held. I 
know. An exhibition dedicated to licensing and brand extension. The sharpest 
thing on my desk right now is a teaspoon. Can you open up a vein with a 
teaspoon?

It’s the final night of the Euro 2016 qualifying groups! And  don’t worry, 
domestic football is back at the weekend it’s all to play for.

One automatic qualifying position is up for grabs. That’s in Group H, where 
Norway are currently in the box seat. If they win in Italy against the already 
qualified azzurri, they’re through to the finals too. But if they don’t,Croatia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia> can leapfrog them with a victory 
against the hapless Maltese.

Group B has already cashiered Belgium and Wales to France. But it’s a 
three-way tussle for the play-off spot. Bosnia-Herzegovina will grab it if they 
win in Cyprus. Israel must win in Belgium to have any hope themselves, but 
they’ll need Bosnia-Herzegovina to drop points in Cyprus. The Cypriots can get 
there if they beatBosnia-Herzegovina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bosnia-herzegovina> and Israel fail to 
achieve their goal in Belgium.

All good fun. But the big news could come in Group A, where the Netherlands 
are in grave danger of missing their first Euro finals since 1984.They need to 
beat theCzech Republic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic> 
tonight, and hope Turkey lose at home to Iceland. And even then, they’ll only 
be getting a play-off spot, the Czechs and Icelanders having already snaffled 
the automatic spots for themselves.

So here are tonight’s fixtures, which kick off at times various around the 
continent, but for the purposes of this Brit-based blog, get going at 7.45pm 
BST.The games that have no bearing on qualification matters this evening are in 
italics...

Group A: Turkey v Iceland, Netherlands v Czech Republic, Latvia v Kazakhstan
Group B: Cyprus v Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> v Israel, Wales v Andorra
Group H: Italy v Norway, Malta v Croatia, Bulgaria v Azerbaijan

It’s on!
