Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has revealed he feels torn about the new 
trailer for Danny Boyle’s Steve Jobs, in whichMichael Fassbender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> and Seth Rogen star as a 
tyrannical take on the late tech guru and a fiercely critical version of 
Wozniak himself.

“What do you do? You’re not an engineer,” says the screen Wozniak. “You’re not 
a designer. You can’t put a hammer to a nail. I built the circuit board. The 
graphical interface was stolen. So how come, 10 times in a day, I readSteve Jobs
 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs> is a genius? What do you 
do?”

Wozniak, 64, told Bloomberg he did not recognise himself in the performance of 
Rogen 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-02/wozniak-says-scene-in-jobs-trailer-is-fiction-loves-it-anyway>
, but seemed to suggest that the general tilt of Aaron Sorkin’s screenplay was 
correct.

“I don’t talk that way,” said Wozniak via email. “I would never accuse the 
graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I 
had credit (genius) taken from me.”

He added: “The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried 
the right message, at least partly. I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the 
trailer, although a bit exaggerated.”

The trailer touches on a grim incident in Jobs’ life, the tech guru’s public 
disavowal of his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs in the late 1970s, even after a 
paternity test established him as the father. “It was hard on me, even being 
quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn’t 
matter,” said Wozniak. “And I can almost cry remembering it.”

The Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> co-founder said he 
nevertheless enjoyed watching the trailer. He is looking forward to seeing the 
final film, which arrives in US cinemas on 9 October and debuts in the UK on 13 
November. The personal computer pioneer confirmed he consulted with Sorkin on 
the project and had dinner with Rogen, though he said he had not asked to see 
the script.

“I do not think that would be appropriate,” he said, adding that he felt 
honoured to be played by a famous actor such as Rogen. “It is the creative work 
of the producer and writer and actors and director and others … Accuracy is 
second to entertainment in a movie like this.”
