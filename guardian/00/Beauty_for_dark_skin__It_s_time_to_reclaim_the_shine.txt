My swift untagging skills on Facebook are second to none. Not for vanity per 
se; I just don't think anyone needs to be exposed to my oil slick forehead 
beaming like a rescue beacon, guiding lost seamen to safety. Generally, I keep 
the shine under control with a combination of adept powdering and extreme 
vigilance. But towards the end of a long night it's easy to let things slip.

The epiphany came in conversation with Terry Barber, the renowned MAC director 
of make-up artistry who's worked with the likes of Grace Jones and Naomi 
Campbell. "Flat, one-dimensional dark skin is so dated and 80s," Terry 
explains. "And I constantly see women using layers of heavy face powder to hide 
any hint of shine which oxidises and darkens when it's mixed with the natural 
surface oils. At the end of the day, you're left covered in dark powder - the 
'chocolate truffle' effect I call it."

Thankfully, Terry has a few ingenious ways for darker skins to keep that 
perfect coverage without losing the natural healthy glow. "Using a primer will 
anchor your base to your skin. Follow with light coverage foundation, but apply 
sparingly where you need it and finish with a sweep of blusher. Your real skin 
texture should always show through, so use a duo-fibre brush to blend 
everything in seamlessly," he says.

By the time we wrap up our chat, my mid-morning shine has already started to 
encroach. I reach for the powder - but Terry says to ditch it entirely. "We 
always use blotting powder rather than face powder on catwalks and shoots. It 
controls shine and keeps skin velvety without adding any extra colour or 
product. It's my absolute shine-proof essential," he adds.

with your skin it's virtually impossible to over-blush. Foolproof beauty at its 
best.
