The near million who voted for the British National party in June's 
Euro-elections are certainly angry and no doubt racist to varying degrees, but 
how many of them would really be up for sending a gunboat down the Liffey? Very 
few, because there are surely not a million people so lunatic that they would 
want to start a war on these islands. Yet that would surely be the result of the
BNP <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/bnp> pledge of "welcoming Eire as 
well as Ulster as equal partners in a federation of the nations of the British 
Isles".

Just like the cheery talk of welcoming Ireland back into the union, the 
party's Derbyshire garden party over the weekend provides the flimsiest veil 
for a programme that is not only nasty, but rooted in delusion and paranoia. 
Alongside the tea, cakes and patriotic memorabilia – designed to create a 
"family" atmosphere and reinforce the half-respectabilty afforded by winning 
two Euro-seats – the Red, White and Blue festival featured a clutch of white 
crosses to commemorate people supposedly killed "as a result of anti-white 
violence". Persecution complex by day gave way to evening self-confidence, as 
far-right fanatics outside the camp gave fascist salutes and shouted "sieg 
heil".

We report today how the BNP shipped in fascists from overseas to address its 
gathering. The party leader, Nick Griffin, no doubt regards links with 
far-right parties abroad – many of which are much better established than his 
own ragbag outfit – as a way to make the BNP look serious. Tellingly, however, 
his attempts to forma grouping in Brussels failed 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/5769464/BNP-fails-to-find-allies-to-form-new-bloc-in-Europe.html>
, as even fellow extremists feared the damage that would be done by associating 
with the BNP.

It is not hard to see why. A handful of BNP leaders may nowadays don suits, 
but a large proportion of the activists, councillors and candidates remain boot 
boys, often with criminal convictions for violence. Mr Griffin's one fellow MEP,
Andrew Brons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/08/european-elections-bnp>, has 
a genteel manner but was, as a young man, involved with Nazi-style groups that 
engaged in arson attacks on synagogues. He hasGerman 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1191753/Just-British-Mr-Brons-BNPs-second-new-MEP-family-roots-Germany.html>
, and quite possibly Jewish, ancestry making his embrace of the most exclusive 
form of British nationalism a source of psychological speculation.

The brutal mindset of Griffin himself was betrayed only last month, when he 
suggested that the Europeans should "sink several ... boats 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8141069.stm>" carrying African 
immigrants. Mindful, perhaps, that few of those who had voted him would truly 
support drowning men, women and children at sea, he added as an afterthought 
that they might be thrown life jackets. The hope must be, as has already 
happened in some town halls, that the more the public gets to know the BNP the 
more they will lose patience with people who are as unpleasant as they are odd.
