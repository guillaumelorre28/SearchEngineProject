.

The all-cash deal for Britain’s most successful technology company, announced 
on Monday, is SoftBank’s biggest acquisition and adds more debt to the already 
significant borrowing of the telecoms and technology group.

SoftBank said buying ARM’s chip design prowess would make it a leader in 
developingthe internet of things

, which promises to let objects such as buildings, cars and fridges connect

The company secured a recommendation from ARM’s board for its offer by paying 
£17 a share – a hefty 43% over ARM’s closing share price on Friday.

Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, welcomed the deal after SoftBank 
guaranteed to keepARM <https://www.theguardian.com/business/armholdings> as an 
independently run business in Cambridge and double its UK workforce by 2020.

SoftBank shares fell 10.3% in Tokyo on Tuesday to ¥5,387, their lowest since 
late March. The fall was the first reaction by shareholders to the deal because 
Monday was a public holiday inJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan>.

The Tokyo-based company’s purchase of a controlling stake in wireless operator 
Sprint for £17bn in 2013 left the company with big debts. It owed ¥11.9tn 
(£90bn) at the end of March, including ¥4tn related to Sprint. It will use a 
¥1tn loan from Japan’s Mizuho Bank for part of the ARM purchase.

SoftBank’s founder and chairman Masayoshi Son has pointed to almost ¥2tn 
raised through asset sales in recent months but analysts had expected it to cut 
debt or buy back shares instead of embarking on another big deal.

Neil Campling, head of technology and media research at Northern Trust Capital 
Markets, said SoftBank made a bad job of explaining the deal and that its swoop 
on ARM looks opportunistic after just two weeks of talks.

“ARM is an awesome asset we think and, if they execute and keep the culture as 
promised, in 10 years’ time it may look to be a masterstroke. But short term is 
a different matter,” he said.

Campling said SoftBank may have opened the door to other bidders for ARM, 
whose chips appear in Apple iPhones and almost all smartphones as well as 
washing machines and other items that increasingly require processing power.

The swiftness and stealth of SoftBank’s move left investment bankers no time 
to pitch a takeover of ARM to companies such as Apple, Intel and Microsoft but 
US companies could enter the fray, he said.

After jumping on news of the deal on Monday, ARM’s shares fell 0.5% on Tuesday 
to £16.67, suggesting shareholders do not yet expect a bidding war.
