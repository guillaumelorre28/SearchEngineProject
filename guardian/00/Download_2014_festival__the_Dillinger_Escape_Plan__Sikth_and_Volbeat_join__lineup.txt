The Dillinger Escape Plan released their last album, One of Us Is the Killer, 
in May 2013, while the Grammy-nominated Volbeat unveiled their latest album, 
Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies, in April. Volbeat frontman Michael Poulsen 
said: "2013 has been an amazing year â€“ we had an absolutely fantastic UK tour 
with some of the most passionate crowds ever. We can't wait to tear up 
Download."

Watford metal group Sikth split up in 2008 but will re-form to play the 
festival, their first live show since playing Islington Academy in London in 
September 2007. "We've always said that one day we would get Sikth back 
together and do another show, and next year just feels like the right time to 
stop the talking and do it," said Dan Weller of the band. "To be honest, we 
really miss playing those songs. Our fans have been so loyal, so it's time to 
give them something back. We played Download in 2003 and 2006, so it seemed the 
obvious place for us to make a return."
