Sima Zain left the only home she had ever known with just a backpack of 
clothes and a couple of favourite pieces of jewellery, travelling on a bus 
plastered with pictures of her enemy’s face to an unknown future.

The journey was a blur of tears and terror, weeping for the city and friends 
she was leaving behind, frightened that the evacuation bus with a picture of 
the Syrian president,Bashar al-Assad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad>, stuck to the windscreen 
would be halted by government troops.

“It was really terrifying, really sad,” she said in a phone interview from 
Idlib province, where Sima, her mother, sister and a few other relatives are 
staying in rented rooms. “I had lived inAleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> since I was born – I didn’t leave it 
even in the revolution or when it was besieged.”

What next for Syria, its allies and foes after fall of Aleppo?

A university student who came of age during the war, she also worked as a 
media activist, which would mark her out as a target if the uncertain 
guarantees given by the Syrian regime to those on the vehicles were broken. “I 
felt like it’s maybe a trick to capture us, but we had no choice … to them, I 
am a terrorist.”

The evacuation has been difficult and chaotic, with thousands of people 
streaming through the freezing, shattered streets of rebel-held Aleppo and 
trying to cram on to one of thefew dozen buses provided for up to 50,000 people

.

Desperate to get out, huge crowds surged around the vehicles. “We had to wait 
about four hours to get on board,” said 21-year-old Mohanned, who lost contact 
with his uncle, cousin and father in the crush.

“It was so cold, the area was destroyed and the children were all crying. The 
Red Crescent teams were trying to organise everything, make sure the children 
and injured got on first, but there were too few buses. Everyone was desperate 
to get out.”

He found his father on one bus but their relatives are still missing. “My 
uncle and his son are still stuck inside Aleppo, we think; we have not been 
able to contact them. I don’t know if they managed to get out or are still in 
the besieged areas.”

Communications from Aleppo are at their worst since the start of the war, with 
phone and internet coverage failing. Batteries are running low, as people 
trying to flee lose access to generators they usually use to recharge their 
phones.

Fears that the evacuation might be a government trick, which made some wary of 
boarding the buses, have given way to fears that Assad and his allies may shut 
down the shaky ceasefire before all can leave.

On Friday, the evacuations were halted after rebels linked to al-Qaida broke 
the ceasefire terms. There were also reports that troops loyal to Assad had 
stopped buses and killed or detained men on board.

“Thousands waiting to be evacuated but the sectarian militants prevented us 
after they took all of our money and told us to go back,” a journalist, Zouhir 
al-Shimale, tweeted after his bus returned to Aleppo.

“After this horrible day, which is the worst catastrophe day of my life … I 
will not leave without UN observation.”

The UN’s children’s agency, Unicef, warned there were still many children, 
whose lives are in immediate danger, among the crowds hoping for escape.

“Hundreds of … vulnerable children, including orphans, remain trapped inside 
that part of the city,” said Unicef’s director, Anthony Lake.

“We are extremely concerned about their fate. If these children are not 
evacuated urgently, they could die.

“Unicef and our partners are on standby to evacuate these children to safety. 
We implore all parties to the conflict to let us do so safely and immediately.”

Those who made it out are still in a war zone in midwinter, weakened by months 
without proper food or medical care. Few have been able to bring anything other 
than cash and some clothes with them.

At the initial staging point of Khan al-Assal, a few miles outside Aleppo, 
buses and pickup trucks delivered those lucky enough to have escaped.

Those with money took cars and buses to join friends and relatives further 
afield, but dozens of hungry children milled around asking for food and the 
injured waited for medical help amid the wail of ambulance sirens.

It is an area still targeted by government and Russian bombs, although the 
attacks are much less intense than the bombing raids on east Aleppo in recent 
months.

Aleppo: a cosmopolitan city built on thousands of years of trade

“We’ve gone from hell to the unknown and another hell to follow. They will 
send us to Idlib and kill us all,” said Idris Rasool, an east Aleppo shopkeeper.

“At least I can breathe without the smell of bombs. But it won’t be for long. 
The regime and their masters, the Iranians, will hunt us down.”

Adding to their misery, there was the final humiliation of Assad’s photo 
pasted on the evacuees’ bus windows. “I wanted to tear this picture apart,” 
said Zain. “It was an awful feeling to feel a criminal looking at you and not 
be able to do anything.”

All the evacuees hope to return one day but fear that when they lost the 
battle, they also lost their homes. Assad, they say, will move in supporters to 
the areas that are still habitable or those he rebuilds.

“I left my heart behind; I left the house that I grew up in and the house that 
I lost my mother in. I spent my childhood there, happy and bad days,” said Abu 
Ahmad, a 35-year-old aid worker from Saif al-Dawla.

“The most difficult part is we left the city defeated and humiliated; I don’t 
know tomorrow who will move to my house. My only hope is to go back to Aleppo 
one day.”
