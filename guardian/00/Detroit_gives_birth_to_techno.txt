Technically, Detroit techno was born down the road in suburban Belleville, 
where chief architects Juan Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson met in 
high school. By 1985, Atkins had his own label, Metroplex. If Motown had been 
aspirational, then Metroplex, and the Transmat and KMS labels set up by May and 
Saunderson, were the sound of a future snatched away by industrial collapse. 
Kraftwerk, George Clinton and 80s synth-pop were influences but the melancholy 
undertow was all Detroit.
