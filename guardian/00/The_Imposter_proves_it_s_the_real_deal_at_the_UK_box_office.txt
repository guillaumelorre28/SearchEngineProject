The winner

Arthouse cinema bookers have lamented that this summer lacked a big specialist 
release to rank alongside past summer hitsCoco Before Chanel 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130736/coco-before-chanel> or La Vie en 
Rose <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/117957/la.vie.en.rose>. May offered 
The Raid <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145817/raid> and Moonrise Kingdom
 <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145667/moonrise-kingdom>, and June 
deliveredThe Angels' Share 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146747/angels-share> and Killer Joe 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143054/killer-joe>, but July and August 
failed to contribute a big winner, leaving the space occupied by commercial 
auteur titles such asMagic Mike 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148230/magic-mike> and The Dark Knight 
Rises <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises>.

Now, however, arrives The Imposter 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter>, a plucky underdog 
contender delivering £345,000 over the four-day holiday weekend, including 
previews of £29,000, from just 49 sites. Joint distributors Revolver and 
Picturehouse report sold-out shows in the Clapham and Hackney Picturehouses and 
Ritzy Brixton, in London, and in other cities such as Brighton, Norwich, Exeter 
and Bath. Bart Layton's true-crime investigation has benefited from a much more 
aggressive release strategy in the UK than has been the case in the US, where a 
gradual rollout has seen it accrue $386,000 after seven weeks of play. With a 
screen average there running at a so-so $3,350 for the current weekend, it's 
hard to envisage any significant US expansion, whereas, in the UK, further 
bookings are a dead cert.

Top documentary opening for the year so far is Katy Perry: Part of Me 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148279/katy-perry>, with £449,000 
including £91,000 in previews, but that was from a release on 326 screens, and 
concert movies arguably exist in a separate category. Excluding concert films,
The Imposter <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter> has 
achieved the biggest debut for a documentary sinceSenna 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141505/senna> roared off with £375,000 
including £27,000 in previews last summer. Senna's eventual lifetime tally of 
£3.17m will likely prove too lofty a goal for The Imposter, but the film should 
have no problem besting the likes ofMarley 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146456/marley> (£958,000), Man on Wire 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125351/man.on.wire> (£879,000) and maybe 
even the Perry doc (£1.17m). It all depends now on the strength of audience 
word, and the twin distributors will take heart that grosses rose over the 
four-day period, building to Monday's £94,000.

Unsurprisingly, Picturehouse programmed The Imposter 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter> enthusiastically in its 
own sites, and achieved a 35.5% market share on the title. Cineworld, which has 
a reputation for an arthouse-friendly programming mix, came second with 21.6% of
The Imposter <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter>'s gross. 
Top site was Curzon Soho, in London, with £14,359 for the three days and 
£20,216 including Monday. The picture expands to 75 cinemas from Friday.The 
Imposter <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter> beat rival 
upscale offeringShadow Dancer 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145818/shadow-dancer>, an IRA drama that 
straddled the arthouse-mainstream divide. Released on 168 prints, the Clive 
Owen/Andrea Riseborough picture managed £201,000 from Friday to Sunday, and 
£288,000 including the holiday Monday.

The lowbrow hit

The weekend offered a study in contrasts with another British production, 
Keith Lemon: The Film <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148902/keith-lemon>
, also arriving in cinemas. WhileThe Imposter 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter> was screened 
aggressively to critics, achievingmany five-star endorsements 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/23/the-imposter-review>, the Keith 
Lemon picture was protected from critical judgment for as long as possible, 
before theinevitable one-star responses rained down on it 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/23/keith-lemon-film-review>. And while 
grosses forThe Imposter <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter> 
steadily climbed day by day throughout the holiday weekend, Keith Lemon went in 
the opposite direction – although, in fairness, on Monday it faced additional 
competition from newly arrived comedyThe Watch 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch>. Overall, Keith Lemon 
opened with a respectable £1.20m over the Friday-to-Sunday weekend, and £1.53m 
including bank holiday Monday, enough for fifth place. Keith Lemon convincingly 
beat rival comedyThe Three Stooges 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147184/three-stooges>, which managed 
£353,000 over the three-day weekend, which rises to £509,000 including 
previews, and to £683,000 including Monday's takings.

When backers Lionsgate announced an 24 August release date for Keith Lemon: 
The Film <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148902/keith-lemon>, comparisons 
withThe Inbetweeners Movie 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie> (out 19 August 
last year) were inevitable, since they are both spin-offs from UK TV comedies.
The Inbetweeners Movie 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie> opened with an 
attention-grabbing £13.22m, including £4.57m in previews.

The chart champ

Brave <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave>, suffering a modest 
drop of 9% from the previous weekend, convincingly held on to the top spot, 
and, including the Monday holiday, has achieved a healthy £14.4m. The Pixar 
flick has one more week before kids return to school, by which time it should 
have overtaken the studio's lowest-performing hitsCars 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113137/cars> (£16.5m) and Cars 2 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142460/cars-2> (£15.6m). It should also 
become Disney's biggest family flick this year, beatingThe Muppets 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145286/muppets> (£16.8m).

Many titles achieved similarly robust holds, notably The Dark Knight Rises 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises> (slipping 9%), 
Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148529/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid> (down 8%) and
Ice Age 4: Continental Drift 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4> (off 5%). Bucking the 
trend wasThe Expendables 2 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148845/expendables-2>, with a 34% fall.

The record breaker

A week ago, this column reported that The Dark Knight Rises 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises> had overtaken 
The Dark Knight <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122806/dark.knight> to be 
the biggest ever Batman flick at the UK box-office. Now it has passedAvengers 
Assemble <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147193/avengers-assemble> 
(£51.8m) to become the biggest hit of 2012. With £53.1m so far, Christopher 
Nolan's film is now the 13th biggest of all time in the UK, beaten by, in no 
particular order, three Harry Potter films, the three Lord of the Rings films, 
Avatar, Toy Story 3, Titanic, Mamma Mia!, The Phantom Menace and Casino Royale. 
The UK is relatively unusual in the particular success ofThe Dark Knight Rises 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises>. In most other 
territories worldwide, the more family-friendly Marvel film has played to a 
broader and bigger audience.

Also continuing its ascent in the UK is Seth Macfarlane's Ted 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted>, now the fourth biggest hit 
of 2012, behind justThe Dark Knight Rises 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises>, Avengers 
Assemble <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147193/avengers-assemble> and 
Ice Age 4 <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4>. Adding 
another £2.2m over the four-day weekend for a total to date of more than £26m,
Ted <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted> looks headed for a final 
tally north of £30m.

The future

With not much fresh material arriving in the market, the weekend was an 
unsurprising 30% down on the equivalent frame from 2011, whenThe Inbetweeners 
Movie <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie> spent a 
second week at the top spot, one place ahead of highest new entrantOne Day 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141706/one-day>. This week, a mixed bag 
of treats arrives for the dog days of summer, including Ben Stiller comedyThe 
Watch <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch>, which landed Monday, 
Colin Farrell in a remake ofTotal Recall 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148835/total-recall>, an Aussie twist on 
The Hangover <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130311/hangover> called A 
Few Best Men, horror titleThe Possession 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147610/the-possession>, and the 
self-explanatoryCockneys vs Zombies 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148919/cockneys-vs-zombies>. Arthouses 
will welcome the critically admired head-scratcherBerberian Sound Studio 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148212/berberian-sound-studio>, from 
Katalin Varga director Peter Strickland.
