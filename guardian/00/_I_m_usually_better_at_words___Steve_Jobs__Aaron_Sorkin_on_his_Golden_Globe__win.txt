Aaron Sorkin <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin> is known for 
his incredibly wordy screenplays, but backstage at the 73rd Golden Globe 
awards, the best original screenplay winner for Steve Jobs was speechless.

“I’m usually better at words,” the writer said, appearing visibly flustered 
onstage in front of the press. “You can perform surgery on me. I’m so stunned 
by what’s happened.”

Part of the shock stems back to the fact that the film has fallen off the 
radar in recent months, after courting negative press for bombing at the box 
office following its wide release in the US. After starting strongly withthe 
year’s best per-screen average 
<http://variety.com/2015/film/box-office/steve-jobs-box-office-1201615549/> in 
its opening weekend, the Danny Boyle-directed drama failed to make an impact 
nationally, taking a poor $7.3m over its opening weekend. It flatlined in the 
end, earning only $17.7m domestically since opening in October.

“The title of the movie changed to ‘Box Office Failure Steve Jobs’ after its 
third week,” Sorkin said. “It took some of the air out of the pride that we 
were feeling [at the time]. We didn’t want that to be the epithet of the movie. 
This is just very, very nice.”

“We understood it wasn’t going to be for everybody,” he added. “It’s not The 
Martian <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-martian>.”


Asked to single out his favorite reaction to Steve Jobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/steve-jobs> from someone close to the Apple 
co-founder, Sorkin was quick to cite computer scientist Andy Hertzfeld, who’s 
played by Michael Stuhlbarg in the film.

Recalled Sorkin: “When we screened it for him, he said: ‘This is unbelievable 
– not all of that happened, but it’s all true’.”
