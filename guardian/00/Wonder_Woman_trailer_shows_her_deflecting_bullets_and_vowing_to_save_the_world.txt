A new trailer for Wonder Woman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/wonder-woman> 
has been released, featuring explosions, fights and “weapons far deadlier than 
you could ever imagine”.

It opens with the voice of Gal Gadot, who plays Diana Price, the alter ego of 
the superhero.

“I used to want to save the world, this beautiful place,” she says. “But the 
closer you get, the more you see the great darkness within. I learned this the 
hard way, a long, long time ago.”

The trailer also shows Wonder Woman meeting Chris Pine’s character, Steve 
Trevor, who tells her he has come to stop “the war to end all wars”.


Wonder Woman is seen deflecting bullets with her bracelets of submission as 
she vows: “It is our sacred duty to defend the world, and it’s what I’m going 
to do.”

One scene shows Wonder Woman at the Louvre in Paris, while others show her on 
a beach with white cliffs.

Gadot first played Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2>, and has a contract with 
Warner Bros to appear in three films.

An earlier trailer was released in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/25/wonder-woman-film-trailer-comic-con-dc-superhero-video>
, which also showed Wonder Woman meeting Trevor.
