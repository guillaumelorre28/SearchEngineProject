Serena Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> continued 
to put her injury-jinxed 2006 behind her at the Australian Open, coming back 
from the brink of defeat to down fifth seed Nadia Petrova 1-6, 7-5, 6-3.

A winner in Melbourne in 2003 and 2005, Williams is unseeded this year after a 
knee injury kept her out for much of the last year. She has already enjoyed 
straight set wins against 27th seed Mara Santangelo in the first round and Anne 
Kremer of Luxembourg in the second but appeared to be overmatched against 
Petrova early on as the Russian claimed the opening set 6-1 in 29 minutes.

Williams then won the first three games of the second set but promptly dropped 
five straight, before digging deep to end the streak on her own serve, before 
launching a charge of her own to level the match at a set apiece.

"I really had no other option than for my game to go up," Williams said. "I 
was down 3-5 and on the verge of being out of the tournament, and I obviously 
didn't want that to happen. ... I told myself just to stay in there and do what 
I had been practising and it'll come together sooner or later."

"Well, all I can say is that Serena a little bit raised her game, and I 
started to be a little bit more careful on the court," Petrova said.

In a back-and-forth third set, Williams claimed the first two games and 
Petrova the next two, before the American broke Petrova in the sixth game and 
held for a 5-2 advantage. She then closed out the Russian two games later for 
victory.

"I think it was a good test of my fitness," said Williams, who will face 
either 11th seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia or Victoria Azarenka of Belarus in 
the fourth round. "I'm fit and I'm ready. I felt like I had another game to 
play after the match."

Second seed and defending champion Amelie Mauresmo and third seed Svetlana 
Kuznetsova are also through to the fourth round.

Mauresmo took just over an hour to dispose of Eva Birnerova of the Czech 
Republic 6-3 6-1 while Kuznetsova defeated 26th seed and fellow Russian Maria 
Kirilenko 6-1 6-4.
