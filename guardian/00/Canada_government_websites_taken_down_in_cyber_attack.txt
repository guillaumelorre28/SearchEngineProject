Several Canadian government websites and servers were taken down in a cyber 
attack on Wednesday, with the hacking groupAnonymous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous> taking responsibility in 
what it said was retaliation for a new anti-terrorism law passed by Canada’s 
politicians.


 The general website for government services, canada.ca, as well as the site 
of Canada’s spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), were 
among those affected.

 Tony Clement, the cabinet minister responsible for the Treasury Board, 
confirmed on his Twitter account the cyber attacks on government websites. The 
government said the attack also affected email and internet access but that it 
was working to restore the services.

 In a video posted on YouTube, Anonymous said the anti-terrorism law violated 
human rights and targeted people who disagree with the government.

 Bill C-51, or the Anti-terrorism Act, 2015, would broaden the mandate of 
CSIS, giving the agency new powers to disrupt perceived security threats. The 
legislation would also make it easier for federal agencies to increase 
surveillance and share information about individuals.

The public safety minister, Steven Blaney, denounced the cyber attacks, 
telling reporters that there were many other democratic ways for Canadians to 
express their views. He also said the government was implementing efforts to 
improve its cyber security.
