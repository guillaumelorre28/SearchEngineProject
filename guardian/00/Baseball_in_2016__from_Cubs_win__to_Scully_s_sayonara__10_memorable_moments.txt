1) Lovable losers bid adieu 

It was Game 7 of the World Series, and baseball history was busy pulling the 
Chicago Cubs <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chicago-cubs> back into a 
boiling cauldron of curses. Rajai Davis’ eighth inning, game-tying home run off 
the Cubs’ Aroldis Chapman had turned Cleveland’s Progressive Field into a mosh 
pit, with slightly fewer title-starved Indians fans ripping off their shirts in 
frenetic celebrations.

A montage detailing 108 painful years was cued up and ready to roll inside the 
minds of the Cubs’ frustrated fan base, when Chapman reversed course and got 
the outs needed to push the greatest game onwards. In the post-rain delay 10th 
inning, Chicago popped out two runs, enough to put baseball’s longest running 
fire out for good. The Cubs were finally champions, thanks to a long awaited 
run which captivated global audiences and spiked baseball viewership to levels 
thought long gone.

We may never see anything quite like it again.

will hit fans hard. Photograph: Jae C. Hong/AP 
Vin Scully’s Dodgers broadcasting journey began in Brooklyn back in 1950, his 
musical voice first moving through the warm tubes of wooden radios. Then it 
meandered in and out of transistor sets, onto televisions, computers, and 
finally to tablets and phones. Scully was one of sports’ greatest gifts. His 
storytelling, effortlessly weaved between balls and strikes, was the heavy 
cream of baseball broadcasting. When April comes and the Dodgers break camp, 
we’ll be without the voice for the first time in 67 years. It will take time, a 
very long time, to get over it.

In 2016, baseball faced the realities of back-room misdeeds. 

We learned that the 2015 hacking into the Houston Astros 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/houston-astros> proprietary database by 
Cardinals former scouting director, Christopher Correa, was serious enough for 
him to be sentenced to 46 months in prison: St Louis have yet to receive 
punishment from Commissioner Rob Manfred.

Weeks before Correa’s sentencing allegations surfaced  
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/redsox/2016/07/01/red-sox-penalized-for-international-signing-violations/HPinJrtIf9hu6zi8yXcO6I/story.html>
that the Boston Red Sox were circumventing international signing rules in 
Venezuela by raising player signing bonuses through a series of winks, nods and 
maybe even bags of cash. Baseball doled out swifter punishment: the teens who 
signed with the Sox became free agents and were allowed to keep the bonuses, 
while Boston were banned from signing an international player until July of 
2017.

Sunnier moments came earlier this month when Major League Baseball and the 
Players Association continued their labor peace by co-signing a collective 
bargaining agreement that expires in five years. A host ofgame-altering policies
 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2016/12/01/winners-losers-baseballs-new-labor-agreement/94777082/>
 are now coming into play, and thankfully, the team with the best record will 
finally gain home field advantage instead of the winner of the All-Star Game.

In his final season, David Ortiz hit his most home runs since 2007, played his 
most games since 2006 and posted an OPS of over 1.000 for the fifth time in a 
20 year career, all while powering the Red Sox back to the playoffs in a 
campaign that rivaled Ted Williams’ last year at Fenway. Yes, Papi did it all, 
despite injuries that saw the slugger essentiallyplaying on stumps 
<http://nesn.com/2016/10/david-ortiz-was-essentially-playing-on-stumps-dhs-physical-therapist-said/>
 while onlookers wondered how a player performing on such a level could walk

on Instagram <https://www.instagram.com/p/BNsljbahEPp/> that he could return 
after the club acquired pitcher Chris Sale.

The Marlins young ace and two friends died after their speeding boat crashed

beyond into mourning. The sports world grieved at the death of the 
ultra-talented Cuban hurler, one who had been imprisoned at the age of 15 after 
attempting to defect to the States. Fernández was barely 24 years old when he 
died: waves of tributes followed for a young talent who had only begun to 
scratch the surface of his life, never mind his potential on the field.

Covering Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez was like waking up every morning to a 
new present.

As I wrote back in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/11/mlb-news-alex-rodriguez-last-baseball-megastar>
, as he was ceremoniously ushered out as Yankees DH with a year to go in his 
$275m deal, “at the nextBaseball <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/baseball> 
Writers’ Association dinner, they should give A-Rod an award for enriching 
their lives with some of the most colorful, controversial and polarizing 
stories they’ll ever scribble. He deserves it, because another A-Rod isn’t 
going to walk into the sport anytime soon.”

When the dust settled from Rodriguez’ departure, the Yanks 2016 transformation 
from an over-the-hill gang to a rebranded troop of potential stars was 
complete. We caught more than a glimpse of Gary Sanchez: all the catcher did in 
53 games was hit 20 home runs and punch up an OPS of over 1.000. With a stacked 
farm system and the re-acquisition of closer Aroldis Chapman, there’s reason 
enough to believe that the next great Yankees dynasty could be upon us sooner 
rather than later.

Story wise, Mike Trout will never pump out the pixels of an A-Rod (although he 
does havean amusing obsession with weather 
<http://thebiglead.com/2016/01/24/heres-mike-trout-reporting-for-the-weather-channel/>
), but on the field, he’s already generated a career’s worth ofblack ink 
<http://www.baseball-reference.com/about/leader_glossary.shtml> in just six 
seasons. The Angels outfielder won his second AL MVP, no easy trick considering 
writers prefer to not hand out the award to players on non-contending teams. 
Rather incredibly, Trout is the first player to finish in the top two in MVP 
voting in each of his first five full seasons. Chicago’s Kris Bryant beat out 
DC’s Daniel Murphy in the NL while playing no fewer than six positions. 
Murphy’s team-mate Max Scherzer became the sixth hurler to win a Cy Young Award 
in both leagues, while Boston’s Rick Porcello won in the AL, when it probably 
should have gone to Baltimore closer Zach Britton. Rookie silverware went to 
Detroit starter Michael Fulmer and Dodger shortstop Corey Seager, while Terry 
Francona won Manager of the Year for turning Cleveland around and LA’s Dave 
Roberts won in the NL award in his first season as skipper.

With the exception of Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter, who kept his 
superior closer Zach Britton on the bench while waiting for a traditional 
bullpen scenario to surface during the AL Wild Card game against the Toronto 
Blue Jays, elite relief talent were pushed to the limit this post-season. The 
likes of LA’s Kenley Jansen, Cleveland’s Andrew Miller and Chapman of the Cubs 
were routinely called upon to go well beyond the usual call of duty, and in a 
World Series where no starter pitched past the sixth inning, Miller and Chapman 
were on the mound for nearly a quarter of the time, both dramatically buckling 
in the season’s final frames. If their arms fail to bounce back in 2017, 
critics,including Chapman himself

While the north celebrated in 2016, Southsiders soured at another 
disappointing season with two bizarre bookends. In March,Adam LaRoche abruptly 
retired from the White Sox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/17/adam-laroche-son-drake-retire-chicago-white-sox>
 after VP Kenny Williams asked him to cut the amount of time his teenaged son, 
Drake, was spending in the clubhouse and around the team. His decision cost the 
infielder some $13m in salary and led to a sharp division amongst Sox players 
and their colleagues across the sport. Chris Sale accused Williams of changing 
his story three times (and also cursed him out), perhaps setting the stage for 
the ace’s antics later in the season.

In July, Sale, unhappy with his having to wear the always controversial 1976

elected to slash the jerseys instead. Sale was sent home, and then months later 
was shipped out to Boston in a blockbuster deal. The rebuilding Sox will look 
to steady the ship in 2017 under skipper Rick Renteria, who replaced Robin 
Ventura after the seasons end.
