The Chronic's lush, sophisticated production smoothed out the rattly aesthetic 
of hip-hop's first "golden age" with radio-friendly audio opulence. But it was 
the lyrics – the nihilistic lifestyles of the gangbangers and weed dealers – 
that had the most lasting impact. The discovery that small-time crime 
narratives could spur huge sales meant that the hustler on the make became 
rap's predominant persona – whether the rappers who followed Dre, Snoop and the 
D.O.C. were "keepin' it real" or not.
