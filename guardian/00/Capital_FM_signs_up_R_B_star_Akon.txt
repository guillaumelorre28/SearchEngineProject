Global Radio's London station 95.8 Capital FM has signed the R&B star Akon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> to present a weekly Saturday evening 
show.

Akon, a multi-platinum-selling and Grammy-nominated singer, will present his 
first show this Saturday between 7pm and 9pm. He was one of the stars who 
performed at Capital's Summertime Ball last year.

Capital's Saturday evening slot is currently hosted by Dave Kelly, who will 
continue to present the weekday late-night show on the station from 10pm to 2am.

The group programme director of 95.8 Capital and Global's Hit Music Network, 
Paul Jackson, said: "We are delighted to welcome one of the world's greatest 
R&B artists to 95.8 Capital FM. Akon has worked with legendary performers such 
as Lady Gaga, Whitney Houston and Eminem and his brand new show on Capital will 
be awesome."

Capital has more listeners than any other London commercial station, with an 
average weekly reach of 1.83 million in the last quarter of 2009, according to 
the latest Rajar figures. It is third in London in terms of market share, 
behind Global sister station LBC and Bauer Radio's Magic 105.4.
