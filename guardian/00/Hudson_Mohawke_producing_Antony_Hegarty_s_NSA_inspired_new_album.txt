Hudson Mohawke says he is producing Antony Hegarty’s new album. The Scottish 
electronic artist is helming the boards for an LP inspired by last year’s NSA 
spying revelations.


“The album I’m producing for [Antony] is really cool as fuck,” Mohawke told NME
 <http://www.nme.com/news/hudson-mohawke/79736>. “It’s really political, very 
angry, taking on the NSA.”


Mohawke, whose real name is Ross Birchard, is best known for working with 
Kanye West and as one half of the electronic act TNGHT. He is also an acclaimed 
solo artist, with a new EP out with Warp on 30 September.

Hegarty, who won the 2005 Mercury prize for I Am a Bird Now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/16/popandrock.shopping>, hasn’t 
released an album since 2010’sSwanlights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/07/antony-and-the-johnsons-swanlights-cd-review>
. Although he usually self-produces recordings for his group, Antony and the 
Johnsons, he has often collaborated with other musicians, including electronic 
artists such as Matmos, Current 93, Oneohtrix Point Never, and Hercules and 
Love Affair, with whom he co-wrote half an album.

In May, Hegarty appeared at Mohawke’s Hudson Mohawke and Friends concert at 
New York’s Webster Hall. He performed behind a scrim, singing two “mesmerising” 
new songs, according to the blogDo Androids Dance? 
<http://doandroidsdance.com/reviews/hudson-mohawke-rbma-nyc-2014/> “Of all the 
friends HudMo brought along,” they wrote, “Antony was the most unexpected and 
also the most powerful.”

Mohawke is also putting together a project with Foals frontman Yannis 
Philippakis. The music is “coming along”, he told NME. “I think it’ll be pretty 
special”.
