Harper is a girl who lives in an apartment block and has an unusual talent. I 
suppose you would think a talented person is a famous actor or actress, or a 
dancer or a gymnast and all those snappy usual and attractive talents which you 
would think of straight away. Well, Harper’s talent is that she can play any 
instrument without even learning a single note!

One day Harper’s beloved best friend, her cat Midnight, disappears and so do 
all the other cats in the town. Harper tries playing Midnight’s favourite tune 
but even this doesn’t bring her cat back. Harper knows she must team up with 
her friends, the other children in her apartment block, to find out what 
happened to the missing cats. Did they get lost? Had they been stolen? Had they 
moved out? Can the children solve the mystery with the help of the flying 
scarlet umbrella? Read this book to find out!

I really enjoyed this wonderful adventure book by Cerrie Burnell. The 
illustrations by Laura Ellen Anderson are fabulous and brilliant. I think this 
story would be exciting for 7-12 year olds.
