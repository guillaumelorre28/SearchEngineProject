The former No1-ranked player Marat Safin says Andre Agassi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andre-agassi> should give his titles back 
after the American confessed to testing positive to a banned substance during 
his career and lied about it to the ATP.

Agassi admitted in his autobiography 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/nov/01/andre-agassi-autobiography> 
Open that he used crystal meth in 1997 and failed a drug test, a result he says 
was thrown out by tennis's governing body after he lied by saying he 
"unwittingly" took the substance.

Safin, who will retire this month, said in an interview with France's L'Equipe 
newspaper that Agassi should "give his titles, his money and his Grand Slam 
titles" back.

Agassi yesterday said in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald 
<http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/tennis/i-was-never-doped-up-on-court-agassi/2009/11/08/1257614959658.html>
 newspaper that it would be physically impossible to play tennis while high on 
crystal meth,adding that he never played the game while doped 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/09/andre-agassi-tennis-drugs>.

"No, I never did it in tournaments," Agassi said. "I never did because it 
would have been a disaster. It's hideous; it's not the way you feel but what 
you're incapable of. Your heart rate runs high enough as it is but to have that 
kind of heart rate and to tell yourself to calm down and hit a second serve is 
literally impossible."
