Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> police said an officer 
is being investigated after video surfaced that shows him striking a woman in 
the face during an arrest.


 Flagstaff police said in a news release that officer Jeff Bonar has been 
placed on leave pending the investigation.

“Our agency is very concerned by what is depicted in this video,” they said. 

Police said the incident occurred on Wednesday as officers arrested a 
“somewhat uncooperative” woman.

Video apparently shot by an onlooker and posted on Facebook shows her 
struggling with two officers.

At one point one of the men strikes or punches her in the mouth area. She is 
eventually placed in a squad car.

There was no word on what prompted the arrest, but Arizona Republic reported 
that it spoke with a man who identified the woman as his girlfriend and that 
police indicated she faced an arrest warrant.
