Tim Henman today eased into the third round of the Australian Open with a 
routine straight sets victory over Romania's Victor Hanescu.

Henman recorded a 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 win in just under two hours and now faces 
Belgian Christophe Rochus, who beat 26th seed Nikolay Davydenko today in 
straight sets.

The 6ft 6in Hanescu unsurprisingly has a decent serve but possessed little 
else to worry Henman, who had never played the world No88 before.

Two breaks of serve gave the British No1 the second set and the 30-year-old 
seemed in total control as he was cheered on by tennis' version of the Barmy 
Army.

Henman had been in a similarly dominant position against Cyril Saulnier in the 
first round before losing his way, and he let slip four chances to break in the 
opening game of the third set today.

He was also forced to save three break points on his own serve to stay on 
level terms before finally achieving the crucial break in the ninth game.

Henman has never been past the fourth round in Melbourne in eight attempts but 
feels he is in better shape than ever this year.

"Without a doubt," he said. "I feel I am playing better but also mentally I 
feel very comfortable and pretty relaxed about things. It's much more 
enjoyable."
