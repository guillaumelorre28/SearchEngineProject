BSkyB has revealed that more than 50,000 people have taken advantage of its 
£9.99 sport "day pass" on internet service Now TV, the first time in its 
two-decade history the pay-TV giant has allowed access to prime content such as 
Premier League football without a TV subscription.

BSkyB launched Now TV, which offers content including Sky Movies and sport, as 
a response to rivals such as Netflix and to boost the accessibility of content 
as rivals such as BT gear up to launch sport services.

The company added the "day pass" to the service three months ago.

BSkyB announced a further extension of the service on Friday, with a Now TV 
box for £9.99, which will allow non-Sky subscribers to connect their TV to the 
internet.

The company said that "tens of millions" of regular TVs in the UK cannot 
connect to the internet, with the new service allowing an "affordable and 
simple way for any broadband-connected home to join the online TV revolution" 
and access services such as the BBC iPlayer, Facebook as well as Sky content.

Jeremy Darroch, the BSkyB chief executive, said that its services beyond 
traditional TV are thriving and said it would spend £60m-£70m on developing 
connected TV services.

BSkyB also announced a raft of initiatives, including adding 20 new channels 
to its catchup TV service, as part of its financial results for the year to the 
end of June.

Pre-tax profits were £1.26bn for the year, a 5.7% increase, as revenues rose 
7% to £7.2bn.

The company added 34,000 new TV customers in the three months to the end of 
June, a combination of satellite TV and Now TV subscribers, to take the total 
to 10.4 million.

BSkyB added 119,000 broadband customers in the quarter, plus 400,000 from the 
acquisition of O2's customer base, taking its total to 4.9 million.

BSkyB said that 35% of its total customer base take three products, such as 
TV, telephony and broadband.

Average revenue per user, a key metric watched by analysts and investors rose 
£577, up £29 year on year.

The company said advertising revenues were flat year on year at £440m, despite 
the Olympics in the first quarter of BSkyB's financial year.

Programming costs increased by 8% to £2.4bn, with sports accounting for a 
majority of the rise due to expenses such as Formula 1, Ryder Cup and Lions 
rights.

BSkyB said that Sky Go, which allows customers to access live and on-demand 
content on devices such as smartphones and games consoles, had increased its 
user base by 19% over the year to 3.3m.

Its premium service Sky Go Extra, which allows customers to register up to 
four devices and download TV and movies to watch offline for £5 a month, had 
attracted 150,000 customers in just five months.

"In our television business, there has been an excellent response from 
customers to our new services," he said. "We've seen an explosion in on-demand 
and mobile viewing as more people connect their Sky boxes to broadband and 
watch TV on laptops and mobile devices with Sky Go. The benefits to our 
business are equally strong through take-up of higher-tier packages, expanded 
revenue opportunities and improved customer satisfaction."

On a conference call with media Darroch had little to say about BT, which next 
week will launch two sports channels ahead of the start of the Premier League 
season, other than to say that he does not see the company as the biggest 
threat BSkyB has faced.

"I think this is a business that loves competition," he said. "We compete 
against a whole range of businesses of various sizes and we treat them all with 
respect. I think you can see from our results ... across the board we continue 
to make really strong progress".
