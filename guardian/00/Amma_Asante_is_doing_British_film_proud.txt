We don’t need “a Jeff Nichols of our own” to tell the stories of race and 
racism in Britain on film (Review:Heartfelt but reticent portrait of defiance 
against racism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/loving-review-civil-rights-tale-marries-heartfelt-drama-with-too-much-restraint>
, 17 May). We have Amma Asante, director ofBelle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/12/belle-review> and A United Kingdom
 <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3387266/>, both of which, like Jeff Nichols’ film 
Loving, are historical dramas centred on high-profile mixed-race relationships 
and their dramatic consequences. In the month when three reports, from Calling 
the Shots, Directors UK, and European Women’s Audiovisual network, have drawn 
attention to the stark gender and racial inequality in British film-making, 
Peter Bradshaw misses a chance to draw attention to a trailblazing director 
already brilliantly at work. As Melissa Silverstein says, #SeeHerNow.
