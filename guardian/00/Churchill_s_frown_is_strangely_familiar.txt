, June 2) reports that the provost of Eton, Lord Waldegrave, has cried foul 
at Matt Hancock’s suggestion “that employers check the socio-economic 
backgrounds of applicants to stop the 93% of us who didn’t go to private 
schools being discriminated against”. Is this the same Lord Waldegrave whohad 
the following thoughts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/20/a-different-kind-of-weather-william-waldegrave-review>
 from a ministerial car: “How can these people on the pavement live? … Their 
lives must be shadowy, dull, have nothing compared to this insider life 
of ministries, secrets, parliaments, flags, interpreters, crises, fear, fame 
(of a sort); being somebody.”

• The vote by the Bundestag to recognise the Armenian genocide is important (
Berlin’s Armenian-genocide vote prompts recall of Turkish envoy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/germany-braces-for-turkish-backlash-as-it-votes-to-recognise-armenian-genocide>
, 3 June). It means pressure will build on states that have not recognised the 
genocide up to now, such as the US, Britain and Israel, to follow suit. Once 
Turkey is isolated on this issue it will have to end its denial of the genocide.

• Thank you for the front-page picture of the new £5 note, showing Winston 
Churchill (3 June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/02/winston-churchill-fiver-five-pound-note-ends-paper-money-trail>
). Now I know where the idea for David Cameron’s cultivated, concerned frown 
came from, as in several recent photos.

• In Garstang we have still have our medieval weinds, such as Thomas’ Weind 
and Stoops Hall Weind – narrow lanes populated with shops and houses (Letters

• I was a teenage drummer (Return of the axe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/01/how-the-electric-guitar-i-threw-away-20-years-ago-found-its-way-back-to-me>
, G2, 2 June). However, I will concede that the electric guitar is something 
special. Surely the greatest invention of the 20th century. It has entertained, 
reshaped popular culture and brought so many people together. Peter Bradshaw 
will have to get friends round to form a band.
