From Motown to the Spice Girls <https://www.theguardian.com/music/spicegirls>, 
the girl group has had its day in every era. But the early 90s were 
particularly fertile ground for female R&B with TLC, En Vogue, SWV, Total, 
Jade, Brownstone... Arguably, the era began this year with SWV's Right Here, 
followed by En Vogue's Free Your Mind, and ended on a high with TLC's No Scrubs 
in 1999. By the start of the noughties, the baton had been passed to Destiny's 
Child, fronted by some singer called Beyonc√©.
