Germany's leading newspaper publisher, Axel Springer, has explained how it 
will charge for content.Christoph Keese, an architect of the company's online 
strategy (and its PR chief),told the New York Times: 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/business/media/07iht-springer07.html> "A 
highly industrialised world cannot survive on rumours. It needs quality 
journalism, and that costs money."

There may be some dispute about whether Springer's flagship, Bild, Europe's 
best-selling daily, exemplifies quality journalism, but that's another matter.

Here is Keese's plan. Instead of building separate paywalls around individual 
newspaper sites, he wants publishers and internet companies to work together to 
create a "one-click marketplace solution" for online content.

In his ideal system, search engines would continue to display links to 
newspaper articles, videos and other content from a variety of providers. But 
some of the items - what Keese calls "non-commodity journalism" - would include 
a price tag.

An example? Pictures of Italy's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi cavorting 
with models at his villa in Sardinia — published by the Spanish dailyEl País. 
Surely people would pay €5 for that, he said.

A single click would allow the user to pay for and view the pictures. But 
Keese also envisages readers buying flat-rate packages to provide access to 
content from a variety of media outlets. And Springer is happy to work with
Google <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> on bringing the concept 
to fruition.

Keese clearly sees Springer's initiative as a great deal more positive than 
the plans advanced by US newspaper publishers, believing it will preserve print 
media, ending his interview with a pro-German flourish.

"The Americans don't give a damn if the newspapers go down," he said. "This is 
very different inGermany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>. This is 
Gutenberg's country. We invented this."
