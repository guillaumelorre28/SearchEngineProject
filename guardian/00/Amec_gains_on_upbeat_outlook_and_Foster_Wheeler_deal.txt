The engineering sector is in for a period of big deals, according to Amec.

As the company firmed up its $3bn bid for US rival Foster Wheeler, announced a 
bigger than expected dividend and a record order book, chief executive Samir 
Brikho said:
 Amec acquiring Foster Wheeler is going to be a start of something to happen 
in the industry.

Amec's shares have added 36p or more than 3% to £11.28 in a falling market 
after it reported a 3% rise in full year profits to £343m. Canaccord Genuity 
analyst Alex Brooks said:
 Amec has released solid 2013 results, with earnings per share of 87.2p up 11% 
year on year and beating our and consensus estimates by 4%, partly on lower tax 
but primarily on better than expected margin in Europe in particular.

The outlook statement is unchanged from mid January, in that despite some 
downward pressure on margins from mix as well as the stronger pound, the 
company still expects to be able to deliver underlying revenue growth and an 
increase in earnings per share. Separately Amec has announced the renewal of 
the major ONEgas contract in the Southern North Sea for five years, which we 
estimate is worth over £100m in revenue to Amec annually.

However, the most important development is that the company has comfortably 
met the 22 February deadline for a Foster Wheeler offer. The deal is highly 
earnings accretive for Amec and is in our view the most important driver in the 
short to medium term. There remain a number of regulatory and shareholder 
approval hurdles, although we do not anticipate these to be a problem.
