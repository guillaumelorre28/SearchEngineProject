"By Toutatis!" If this invocation of an obscure Celtic God means anything to 
you, then you'll also be familiar with the peevish canine Dogmatix, a chieftan 
called Vitalstatistix and Cacofonix, the bard who can't hold a tune. If it 
doesn't, you could do worse than to acquaint yourself with them and their 
better-known friendAsterix <http://www.asterix.com/>, the Gaulish warrior and 
national treasure of Frenchbandes dessinées, who turned 50 last week. The world 
of Asterix and his improbably large sidekick Obelix (dropped in a cauldron of 
magic potion when he was a baby, and hence invincible) is one of druids, 
menhirs and endless feasting on the juiciest of wild boars. It is also a visual 
and verbal feast, with fantastic and often fantastically detailed illustrations 
by Albert Uderzo and words by René Goscinny. (The English versions required all 
the creative powers of their translators, Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge, to 
put across the punning spirit of the originals, and the results are rightly 
acclaimed.) Part of Asterix's appeal lies in the gentle prodding of European 
national stereotypes: the fondue- and cuckoo-clock-obsessed Swiss, the 
milky-tea-drinking British and the beer-swilling Belgians. But while the 
parodies are occasionally mischievous, they are also humane. If Goscinny and 
Uderzo had a message to convey in among all the fun, it was that inflated egos 
deserve to be punctured – hence the hilarious monikers. You may be a Roman 
centurion, but no one can take you seriously when your name is Crismus Bonus.
