Andrea Riseborough  <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2057859/>is perched on her 
bags in the hallway of her hotel (no room key yet), rattling down the line 
about the honour of being nominated – for a Bafta rising star award – and how 
she fell in love with an American (for her sins) and moved to Idaho in the 
middle of nowhere, to a haven in the woods, which is beautiful. Kind of like a 
log cabin, where she likes to sit and see the elks and play the banjo.

Unashamedly, endearingly eccentric, she talks through questions, spinning off 
on tangents, excited to be home; she was raised in north Tyneside before 
decamping to Rada in London in 2005.

Riseborough's usual persona in interviews seems to be that of a luvvie who 
lives up to the worst stereotypes by asking directors to call her by her 
character's name. She thinks the public might have the wrong idea about her, 
though. "When I talk about work or my take on life, all the joyfulness and 
excitement never seem to make it in," she says. "Sometimes I read an interview 
back and I think, 'God almighty, it's a fucking sermon.'"

Perhaps the problem is that, out of context, the bits of Riseborough's patter 
that are quote-worthy sound epically pretentious. She talks about television as
"a portal in our homes"

, has said that"in the creation of art there are moments of God" 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jan/08/andrea-riseborough-interview-madonna-thatcher>
, but when I put it to her that it's these sort of epiphanies that can earn you 
a reputation, she just laughs.

"Do you want to know where I said that [the creation line]? The Hollywood 
fashion awards. It was from a speech I was giving in honour of [costume 
designer] Arianne Phillips. Just before I spoke, two of the smaller Kardashians 
– the little ones, I think they're twins – won the award for most fashionable 
sisters or something. As they came off, I stood on the stage and just started 
killing myself laughing. I had to say to the audience: 'I got to tell you, I 
think the speech I've written is a little highbrow.'"

On screen, Riseborough, 31, is less of the cheery misfit. She takes serious 
roles and takes them seriously. The Bafta nomination is forShadow Dancer 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145818/shadow-dancer>, a drama set during 
the Troubles in which Riseborough plays an IRA informer flipping on her 
republican family, and for which, earlier this week, she won the Evening 
Standard best actress award) and for Madonna'sW.E. 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142869/w.e>, a fruitcake biopic. 
Riseborough is Wallis Simpson, the American socialite who triggered the 
abdication of Edward VIII. One film is stunning, the other soggy. Riseborough 
is quietly great in both. And intense.

"You devote yourself to something for such a long time – six months of your 
life completely consumed by it," she says. "You're wrapped up in a way. It's an 
all-encompassing experience."

After Rada, Riseborough made her name on the London stage before moving into 
British TV drama. She took the lead roles in Sir Peter Hall's productions of
Miss Julie <http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/jul/16/theatre> and Measure 
for Measure <http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/jul/14/theatre>, played 
opposite Michael Fassbender in the English civil war seriesThe Devil's Whore 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/nov/20/2> and won a Bafta TV award for 
playing a worryingly sexy version of the young Margaret Thatcher in BBC4'sThe 
Long Walk to Finchley 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/jun/13/margaretthatcherthelongwalktofinchley>
. Supporting roles included a part in Mike Leigh'sHappy-Go-Lucky 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/123467/happy-go-lucky>, while her lead in 
Rowan Joffe'sBrighton Rock 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137859/brighton-rock> carried the film 
and led toOblivion 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2013/jan/25/oblivion-trailer-adds-intrigue>
, a sci-fi movie starring Tom Cruise, which is out in April. As the roles have 
got bigger, life has got more bizarre.

"You spend every day pretending at the most antisocial hours," she says. 
"You're miscarrying a baby first thing in the morning. Who wants to hear it? 
God bless them. It's a very strange life. I love the company of actors, but the 
crazier it gets, the more I've come to realise how valuable my time is with my 
friends who work on the land or are builders or, you know, make music. Work in 
offices. Run shops."

There she goes again, playing the jobbing actor when there are movie-star 
shoes to fill. She's typecast in a way – the rising star with brickie mates. 
Meanwhile, Madonna's on speed-dial and there's a blockbuster in the can.

"It's always good to be rising," she says. "The day I need to start worrying 
is the day I'm suddenly awarded 'falling star'. Or 'black hole'."

Voting closes on 8 February for the Bafta rising star award. The result will 
be announced at the EE Bafta awards on 10 February.
