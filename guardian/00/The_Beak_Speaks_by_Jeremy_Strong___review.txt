The Beak Speaks is by Jeremy Strong. He has written lots of books and tends to 
make them all very funny.

In The Beak Speaks there is a family without a mum and the children decide 
that their dad (who is a vet) needs a new wife! A woman comes into the vet 
surgery and dad falls in love with her but she is just faking it. She is called 
Divine and she is very evil. She traps lots of animal so she can sell them for 
money but because she doesn’t take care of them they are dying so that is why 
she decides she need dad – to make them better. To get dad to come to her 
hideout she traps his two children, called Tammy and Mark and then dad gets 
captured. Meanwhile, another woman that dad thinks he doesn’t like (but likes 
him) comes to the rescue with a bird and a monkey.

Jeremy Strong has written other books – There’s a Pharaoh in our Bath! My 
Mum’s Going to Explode, and The Indoor Pirates and lots more. I liked the part 
when dad gets hit by the hippo in the Dark House as it was quite funny!
