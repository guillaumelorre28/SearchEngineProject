If the face is a canvas, stubble can have an altering effect, but it can be 
more of a botch – think of the bizarre amateur restoration of theSpanish Ecce 
Homo fresco <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/spain-europe-news> – 
than a masterpiece. There are no hard-and-fast rules with stubble growth – 
which might be part of the problem. Unless you are a vigilant self-groomer, the 
line between “attractive stubble growth” and sporting the look of someone who 
has fallen into an tar-black pit of endless despair can be indistinct and 
vague. Here’s what some recent famous stubble growth signifies …

Jose Mourinho

Type of stubble: Baby moustache
What it telegraphs: A veil of mystery

After the ignominy of being sacked by Chelsea in December, Mourinho’s 
brilliantly stage-managed stubble was unsettled for most of this year. Now, on 
the cusp of his new role asManchester United’s new manager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/louis-van-gaal-sacked-manchester-united-jose-mourinho>
, on Monday he unveiled … hints of a baby moustache. It’s both off-grid and 
utterly cryptic. The sort of subtle reinvention that you would normally see on 
a pop star about to release their difficult second album.

Type of stubble: Soul patch
What it telegraphs: A love of jazz

As worn by such disparate characters as Billy Bob Thornton, William 
Shakespeare and Kingsley from Fresh Meat, the soul patch is definitely the 
Fredo Corleone of the stubble family. It’s suggestive of the kind of character 
who might be the sole male participant in a hot-stone yoga class, who owns a 
lot of, you know,specialist vinyl, and is the owner of a stress-relief 
eucalyptus scented candle.

Ant McPartlin <https://www.theguardian.com/media/anthonymcpartlin>
 Ant … George Michael stubble, or something more? 
Type of stubble: All over
What it telegraphs: IDGAF

Why has this stubble – the grooming chink in an otherwise fresh-faced TV 
presenter – appeared at all? If this were pop music we’d all be thinking of the 
unsayable right now. He’s going solo. Sorry, Dec. Enter the slowly immersive 
stubble growth and later the probable leather-jacket-shaped rebrand. Or, in pop 
terms, a 1987-era George Michael level of calculated sexiness.

Usher <https://www.theguardian.com/music/usher>
 SoulCycler? Usher sports the bof 
Type of stubble: The bof
What it telegraphs: Eat, pray, love

Usher’s journey from skullcap-wearing crooner to judge on The Voice has been 
interesting to observe. Perhaps more interesting has been his grooming journey 
– from mathematically sculptured goatee to this freeform beard, which he 
debuted at Cannes in the course of promoting the filmHands of Stone 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1781827/>, in which he plays boxer Sugar Ray 
Leonard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/slip-the-jab/2014/jan/29/roberto-duran-sugar-ray-leonard-no-mas-conspiracies>
. We are calling the beard the bof (roughly translation: “¯\_(ツ)_/¯)” to keep 
the French theme. It’s a look that asks: “are you in mySoulCycle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/soulcycle-fitness-therapy-class-celebrities-spin-us-london>
 class?”, but which suggests a man of the cloth who is always ready to dispense 
worldly wisdom in a public space. Sometimes entirely unprompted.
