Guardian EU debate - Summary

 * Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, suggested that Britain should have a 
Norway-style relationship with the EU if it left.Last week Boris Johnson, 
another prominent Leave campaigner, suggested that the Canada model would be 
better. Norway has access to the single market, but has to follow EU 
regulations; Canada just has a free trade deal.Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem 
leader, said the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Soldberg, has said this would 
be wrong for the UK. But Farage said that she and Clegg were just members of an 
elite class that had betrayed their voters. He said Norway was rich, happy and 
successful. 
 * Alan Johnson, the chair of Labour In for Britain, said the Scots could be 
justified in wanting to leave the UK in the event of Britain voting to leave 
the EU if there was a heavy vote in Scotland against such a decision.

 But Farage said the idea of Scotland voting for independence was now “for the 
birds” because of the collapse in oil prices. 
 * Farage said staying in the EU would mean Britain going into union with 
Turkey and “77m even poorer people”.But Clegg said he did not think Turkey 
would join the EU within the next 10 years. 
 * Clegg accused Farage of making “dishonest” claims about the threat posed by 
immigration.He said Ukip warnings were based on a “a totally false assumption 
that if, we leave the EU, people will not continue to try to flee war attrition 
and hunger and come to the UK”. He added: “It is so dishonest to somehow claim 
that if we leave the EU, that problem will go away. It is deeply, deeply 
dishonest.” 
 * Farage described Barack Obama as “the most anti-British president America 
has ever had”. Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative energy minister, dismissed 
Obama’s recent warnings about the dangers of Brexit, saying only “a couple” of 
Americans were making this point. Clegg prompted loud laughter when he pointed 
out in response that Obama was president, not just “Joe Bloggs from Cleveland”. 
 * Clegg described the story about the Queen backing Brexit at a lunch he 
attended is “A-grade, 24-carat bilge”. 
 * Farage said the EU was “hellbent on building a European army, navy and air 
forces as quickly as possibly.”And he claimed Clegg had lied about this when 
they debated in 2014. 
 * Farage said the EU had “provoked” Russia into annexing Crimea. Clegg said 
Farage was indulging in “conspiracy theories” 
 * Farage claimed that under-30s were leading “the rebellion against Brussels” 
on the continent. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Guardian EU debate - Snap verdict

Anyone who thought the EU referendum campaign was going to be dull will have 
to revise their thinking after that event. It was lively and raucous, mostly in 
a good way. By comparison, the general election debates were rather turgid.

But who won?

Judging by the reception in the auditorium, no one. The people who came to 
listen seemed for the most part engaged and committed (from both the Leave camp 
and the Remain camp) and at no point did one get a sense of minds being 
changed. At the end, when Anushka Asthana asked if anyone had been persuaded to 
rethink by what they had heard, hardly any hands went up.

Yet it is probably the Remain camp that has more to worry about from what went 
on here tonight. Over the last three weeks, in speeches and interviews, David 
Cameron has made a calm and coherent case for remaining in the EU, while his 
opponents have fought for Brexit with turbo-charged press backing but a lot 
less consistency and discipline. Cameron has been winning the argument.

But tonight Nigel Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> 
was setting the agenda. He started with a striking soundbite, about Britain 
being more than just “a star on somebody else’s flag”, and then time and again 
he was able to press emotive buttons, for example on Turkey, on Labour and the 
working class, on Eurocrats and even on Scotland (where he was withering about 
the prospect of it ever voting for independence with the oil price so low). He 
even managed to brush aside the perfectly sound argument about a Norway-style 
trade deal not being in the UK’s interest with a rather good riff about the 
delights of Scandinavia. If anyone on the platform was going to sway undecided 
voters, it was probably him.

In many ways it did turn out to be a Farage/Clegg rematch because the most 
effective opposition to Farage came from the former deputy prime minister. Nick 
Clegg was sharp and punchy, and he had a terrific moment when he mocked Farage 
for what he had said about Obama and Russia, and for his faith in “conspiracy 
theories.Alan Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson> 
delivered at least one excellent put-down to Farage too, when he ridiculed the 
idea that Ukip wanted to exclude EU migrants from the UK so that they could let 
in more Indians. But Clegg and Johnson were more often than not in reactive 
mode; Farage was setting the agenda.

Leadsom probably made the least impact on the debate. She was less shouty than 
the men, which had its advantages, and was good on technicalities like banking, 
but towards the end she said at least two preposterous things (about the Tories 
not being at war, and a Polish immigrant thinking the UK was totalitarian) that 
damaged her standing.

And that’s it. 

Anushka asks if anyone has been persuaded by what they have heard tonight. I 
see about three hands go up.

Anushka says the referendum would make a great subject for a play.

And that’s it.

I’ll post a snap verdict and a summary soon.

Alan Johnson says, if Britain leaves the EU, the French would stop Calais 
border checks

Johnson says, if Britain leaves the EU, the French would tear up the deal that 
allows border checks at Calais.

Leadsom says she does not accept that.

Johnson says he is just quoting what Leadsom’s party leader says. He agrees 
with David Cameron.

Farage says there would not be asylum camps in Kent. They would disperse 
before you could say “Jack Robinson”.

Farage says under-30s are leading the revolt against Brussels in Europe

Farage says that across the continent, the new Eurosceptic movement is 
dominated by the under-30s. He accepts that the UK is not like that, but he 
suggests it is moving that way.

The rebellion against Brussels is coming from the young.

Johnson says Labour tried to change the bill so that 16- and 17-year-olds 
could vote.

He says he is worried about how to get people to turn out. In Ireland, during 
the gay marriage referendum, they ran a “tell your granny” campaign to get 
young people to persuade their grandparents to back gay marriage. He suggests 
teenagers should play the same role in this campaign.

Clegg says the story about the Queen backing Brexit at a lunch he attended is 
“A-grade, 24-carat bilge”.

He says the idea that he would give the Queen a sermon on the EU is ridiculous.

People will probably say that is a non-denial denial. But they said that the 
last time he said the story was rubbish.

He says the Queen clearly does not want to be involved. She wants be left out 
of this.

Johnson says many people have changed their minds since 1975.

He says there is no progressive argument for leaving the EU.

If we left, the rest of Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
would negotiate TTIP. And Britain would still be affected by it.

Farage says EU provoked Russia to attack Ukraine

Johnson says President Putin would love Britain to leave the EU.

Farage says Nato has been a successful alliance at dealing with threats.

But the EU, by expanding its alliance to take in Ukraine, provoked to Russia 
to invade.

 * Farage says EU provoked Russia to attack Ukraine. 
Clegg says, having attacked Obama as anti-British, Farage is now claiming that 
the EU was to blame for Russia invading Crimea. It is an absurd “conspiracy 
theory”, he says.

Farage says Norway is rich, happy and successful - and worth following

Farage says Clegg is telling a pack of lies about Norway.

How dreadful would be it be be like Norway, he asks. Rich and happy and 
successful?

 * Farage says Norway is rich, happy and successful - and worth following. 
He says politicians try to pretend that they are responsible for making trade 
happen. They are not. It is driven by consumers wanting to buy things.

So why does the Norwegian prime minister say the UK should not leave the EU?

Farage says the Norwegians were betrayed by their political class, just as 
Britons have been.

 * Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, suggested that Britain should have a 
Norway-style relationship with the EU if it left.Last week Boris Johnson, 
another prominent Leave campaigner, suggested that the Canada model would be 
better. Norway has access to the single market, but has to follow EU 
regulations; Canada just has a free trade deal.Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem 
leader, said the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Soldberg, has said this would 
be wrong for the UK. But Farage said that she and Clegg were just members of an 
elite class that had betrayed their voters. He said Norway was rich, happy and 
successful. 
 * Alan Johnson, the chair of Labour In for Britain, said the Scots could be 
justified in wanting to leave the UK in the event of Britain voting to leave 
the EU if there was a heavy vote in Scotland against such a decision. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/15/brexit-would-justify-bid-for-scottish-independence-says-alan-johnson>
 But Farage said the idea of Scotland voting for independence was now “for the 
birds” because of the collapse in oil prices. 
 * Farage said staying in the EU would mean Britain going into union with 
Turkey and “77m even poorer people”.But Clegg said he did not think Turkey 
would join the EU within the next 10 years. 
 * Clegg accused Farage of making “dishonest” claims about the threat posed by 
immigration.He said Ukip warnings were based on a “a totally false assumption 
that if, we leave the EU, people will not continue to try to flee war attrition 
and hunger and come to the UK”. He added: “It is so dishonest to somehow claim 
that if we leave the EU, that problem will go away. It is deeply, deeply 
dishonest.” 
 * Farage described Barack Obama as “the most anti-British president America 
has ever had”. Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative energy minister, dismissed 
Obama’s recent warnings about the dangers of Brexit, saying only “a couple” of 
Americans were making this point. Clegg prompted loud laughter when he pointed 
out in response that Obama was president, not just “Joe Bloggs from Cleveland”. 
 * Clegg described the story about the Queen backing Brexit at a lunch he 
attended is “A-grade, 24-carat bilge”. 
 * Farage said the EU was “hellbent on building a European army, navy and air 
forces as quickly as possibly.”And he claimed Clegg had lied about this when 
they debated in 2014. 
 * Farage said the EU had “provoked” Russia into annexing Crimea. Clegg said 
Farage was indulging in “conspiracy theories” 
 * Farage claimed that under-30s were leading “the rebellion against Brussels” 
on the continent. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Anyone who thought the EU referendum campaign was going to be dull will have 
to revise their thinking after that event. It was lively and raucous, mostly in 
a good way. By comparison, the general election debates were rather turgid.

But who won?

Judging by the reception in the auditorium, no one. The people who came to 
listen seemed for the most part engaged and committed (from both the Leave camp 
and the Remain camp) and at no point did one get a sense of minds being 
changed. At the end, when Anushka Asthana asked if anyone had been persuaded to 
rethink by what they had heard, hardly any hands went up.

Yet it is probably the Remain camp that has more to worry about from what went 
on here tonight. Over the last three weeks, in speeches and interviews, David 
Cameron has made a calm and coherent case for remaining in the EU, while his 
opponents have fought for Brexit with turbo-charged press backing but a lot 
less consistency and discipline. Cameron has been winning the argument.

But tonight Nigel Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> 
was setting the agenda. He started with a striking soundbite, about Britain 
being more than just “a star on somebody else’s flag”, and then time and again 
he was able to press emotive buttons, for example on Turkey, on Labour and the 
working class, on Eurocrats and even on Scotland (where he was withering about 
the prospect of it ever voting for independence with the oil price so low). He 
even managed to brush aside the perfectly sound argument about a Norway-style 
trade deal not being in the UK’s interest with a rather good riff about the 
delights of Scandinavia. If anyone on the platform was going to sway undecided 
voters, it was probably him.

In many ways it did turn out to be a Farage/Clegg rematch because the most 
effective opposition to Farage came from the former deputy prime minister. Nick 
Clegg was sharp and punchy, and he had a terrific moment when he mocked Farage 
for what he had said about Obama and Russia, and for his faith in “conspiracy 
theories.Alan Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson> 
delivered at least one excellent put-down to Farage too, when he ridiculed the 
idea that Ukip wanted to exclude EU migrants from the UK so that they could let 
in more Indians. But Clegg and Johnson were more often than not in reactive 
mode; Farage was setting the agenda.

Leadsom probably made the least impact on the debate. She was less shouty than 
the men, which had its advantages, and was good on technicalities like banking, 
but towards the end she said at least two preposterous things (about the Tories 
not being at war, and a Polish immigrant thinking the UK was totalitarian) that 
damaged her standing.
 
And that’s it. 

Anushka asks if anyone has been persuaded by what they have heard tonight. I 
see about three hands go up.

Anushka says the referendum would make a great subject for a play.

And that’s it.

I’ll post a snap verdict and a summary soon.
 
Johnson says, if Britain leaves the EU, the French would tear up the deal that 
allows border checks at Calais.

Leadsom says she does not accept that.

Johnson says he is just quoting what Leadsom’s party leader says. He agrees 
with David Cameron.

Farage says there would not be asylum camps in Kent. They would disperse 
before you could say “Jack Robinson”.

Farage says the EU needs offshore processing centres for refugees.
 
Farage says that across the continent, the new Eurosceptic movement is 
dominated by the under-30s. He accepts that the UK is not like that, but he 
suggests it is moving that way.

The rebellion against Brussels is coming from the young.
 
Johnson says Labour tried to change the bill so that 16- and 17-year-olds 
could vote.

He says he is worried about how to get people to turn out. In Ireland, during 
the gay marriage referendum, they ran a “tell your granny” campaign to get 
young people to persuade their grandparents to back gay marriage. He suggests 
teenagers should play the same role in this campaign.
 
Clegg says the story about the Queen backing Brexit at a lunch he attended is 
“A-grade, 24-carat bilge”.

He says the idea that he would give the Queen a sermon on the EU is ridiculous.

People will probably say that is a non-denial denial. But they said that the 
last time he said the story was rubbish.

He says the Queen clearly does not want to be involved. She wants be left out 
of this.
 
Johnson says many people have changed their minds since 1975.

He says there is no progressive argument for leaving the EU.

If we left, the rest of Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
would negotiate TTIP. And Britain would still be affected by it.
 
Leadsom says she read an interview recently with a Polish lawyer who said that 
Britain now reminded her of totalitarianEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> because of the influence of the 
EU.

This provokes jeers.
 
Leadsom provokes quite a lot of derision when she says the referendum has not 
involved blue-on-blue attacks.
 Clegg on the Tories  
(I have inserted several good video clips into earlier posts, where they 
happened chronologically. You may need to refresh the blog to get them to show 
up.)
 
Johnson says President Putin would love Britain to leave the EU.

Farage says Nato has been a successful alliance at dealing with threats.

But the EU, by expanding its alliance to take in Ukraine, provoked to Russia 
to invade.

 * Farage says EU provoked Russia to attack Ukraine. 
Clegg says, having attacked Obama as anti-British, Farage is now claiming that 
the EU was to blame for Russia invading Crimea. It is an absurd “conspiracy 
theory”, he says.

Farage says Clegg is telling a pack of lies about Norway.

How dreadful would be it be be like Norway, he asks. Rich and happy and 
successful?

 * Farage says Norway is rich, happy and successful - and worth following. 
He says politicians try to pretend that they are responsible for making trade 
happen. They are not. It is driven by consumers wanting to buy things.

So why does the Norwegian prime minister say the UK should not leave the EU?

Farage says the Norwegians were betrayed by their political class, just as 
Britons have been.
 
Leadsom says Clegg’s view of the UK makes it seem like a prisoner, afraid to 
go out when someone opens the cell door.
