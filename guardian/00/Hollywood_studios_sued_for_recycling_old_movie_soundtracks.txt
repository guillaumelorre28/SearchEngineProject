accused major Hollywood studios of recycling old soundtracks in a new lawsuit

The federation claims that studios, including Sony, Paramount and Disney, have 
violated the terms of a collective bargaining agreement after using previously 
recorded film scores in later releases.

The official complaint <https://www.scribd.com/doc/266801949/Afm-Soundtrack> 
lists a number of examples, including some major releases. For instance, there 
was allegedly 1min 10sec of the Titanic score used in This Means War, 33sec of 
Cast Away featured in Bridesmaids, 35sec of Battle for the Planet of the Apes 
used in Argo and 2min 23sec of Close Encounters of the Third Kind used in Labor 
Day, without necessary compensation.


Producers agree in guild agreements that “all music soundtrack already 
recorded … will not be used at any time for any purpose whatsoever except to 
accompany the picture for which the music soundtrack was originally prepared.”

There is an allowance for up to 2min of an “unsynced clip”, but only if 
certain payments are then made.

The complaint requests damages be paid by all major studios that are in breach 
of agreement.
