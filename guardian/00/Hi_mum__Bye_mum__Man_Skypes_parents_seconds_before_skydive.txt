We all know it’s important to check in with your parents while travelling, but 
one man decided to let his mum and dad know just how much fun he was having by 
contacting them for a video call seconds before he did a skydive.


Irish backpacker Roger Ryan, who is travelling in Australia, Skyped his 
parents as he braced himself for a parachute jump from 4,000 metres.

In a video captured by Hostelworld <http://www.hostelworld.com/>, we see 
Ryan’s parents sitting in front of the screen, unaware of what their son is 
about to do.

“I’m going to jump out of an aeroplane now, so I’ll talk to you in a second,” 
says Ryan, before leaping out of the aeroplane as his parents let loose a 
stream of expletives.

“I thought he was in a bus!” exclaims his dad.

Well, at least he called.
