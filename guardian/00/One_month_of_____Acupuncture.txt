Since a fall last year I'd suffered an acute lower-back pain caused by a 
displaced and twisted coccyx. My GP had suggested acupuncture, so I threw my 
scepticism - and crippling fear of needles - to one side and booked four 
sessions with a BritishAcupuncture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/acupuncture> Council practitioner 
called Mike. He wasn't too confident that he'd be able to rid me of the 
discomfort in my coccyx but was adamant that he could make a difference to 
other back pain I felt.

I didn't feel a thing as Mike placed the needles along my spine. When a herb, 
moxa, was placed on some points and left to smoulder, it felt as if a hot-water 
bottle had been slipped under my skin. After one session I could jump out of my 
seat without so much as a wince.

But how long would this pain-free mobility last? Mike suggested I go home and 
run a bath. I went to the pub instead, but by the end of the night I still felt 
fine.

In the following two sessions Mike worked on my back then, in the final 
session, told me acupuncture could prevent PMT and period pains. I was doubtful 
but the following week my period came and went in just two days with no cramps 
to speak of. I've been converted.
