Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas are the latest names to be added to the cast 
list of the veteran action star ensemble sequel Expendables 3,according to 
Deadline 
<http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/mel-gibson-antonio-banderas-join-expendables-3/>
. This follows the revelation -and subsequent Twitter spat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/07/sylvester-stallone-bruce-willis-expendables-3>
 - that Harrison Ford had been recruited to replace Bruce Willis in the 
Sylvester Stallone-scripted franchise.

Gibson, of course, will prove a controversial choice: although an accomplished 
action star and genre icon after the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon movies, the 
scandals that derailed his career in the 2000s saw his ability to participate 
in relatively light-hearted and mass-appeal projects severely curtailed:a 
projected cameo in The Hangover 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/mel-gibson-the-hangover-2> was 
dropped in 2010.

Banderas is a much less divisive figure, though not in the same league, 
action-wise, as Gibson. The Spanish actor's action chops rest primarily on the 
two Zorro films he made opposite Catherine Zeta Jones, and the string of films 
he made with Robert Rodriguez, including Desperado and Once Upon a Time in 
Mexico.

The Expendables 3 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-expendables-3> will be 
directed by Red Hill's Patrick Hughes, with a script co-written by Stallone. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke, Wesley Snipes and Jackie 
Chan are all set to appear. The franchise has proved to have commercial muscle, 
with a combined take of $586m at the worldwide box-office for the first two 
films.
