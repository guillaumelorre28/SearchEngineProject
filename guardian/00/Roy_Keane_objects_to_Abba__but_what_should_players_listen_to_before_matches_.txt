Roy Keane’s laid-back, relaxed new book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/07/roy-keane-abba-robbie-savage-ellis-short-pablo-counago>
 includes some special praise for Sunderland’s pre-match changing-room 
mood-music: “The last song before the players went on to the pitch was Dancing 
Queen by Abba. They were going out to play a match, men versus men, 
testosterone levels were high. You’ve got to hit people at pace. Fuckin’ 
‘Dancing Queen.’ It worried me.”

So what, then, is the best pro-testosterone dressing-room music? Pep Guardiola 
reckonedColdplay’s Viva La Vida <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE> 
(“a sophisticated piece of grandiose orchestration”) gave Barcelona an edge.
Manchester City tried Adele

, half a dozen other clubs likeInsomnia 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuqEbRzy_t8>, and Rio Ferdinand had his own 
specialRio Ferdinand mix-tape at United 
<http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/46687>, which purported to covered the 
whole musical spectrum: “There’s a bit of Kanye West on there, Lil Wayne and 
stuff like that, so that everyone in the changing room is happy.”

Any more suggestions for pre-match changing room music?
