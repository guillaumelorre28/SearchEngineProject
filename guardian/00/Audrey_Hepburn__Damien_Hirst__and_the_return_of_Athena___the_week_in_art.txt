Lorenzo Costa – The Concert (c 1485-95)
Music has always fascinated artists, as this Renaissance painting proves, and 
so has the mystery of trying to communicate sound in the silent medium of 
painting. Costa manages it beautifully in this lovely work, the open mouths and 
harmonious poses of the singers making you almost hear their madrigal.
