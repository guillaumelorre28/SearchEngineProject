Monkey can't wait for the first instalment of Ant and Dec's "first 
autobiography", clunkingly entitled Ooh! What A Lovely Pair, in tomorrow's Sun. 
Giving a sneak preview today, the paper reveals how the pair were "riding the 
wave of lad culture" in the 1990s – "boozing, misbehaving and living a 
rock'n'roll lifestyle". They sure were – Dec was once sick in Chris Evans's 
toilet. Crazy days, fellas, crazy days. Of rather more interest is the light 
the pair shed on Kelly Brook's short-lived tenure as a judge onBritain's Got 
Talent <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/britains-got-talent>. "Neither 
of them had a clue she was joining the show," reports the Sun. "They were 
dumbstruck when her opening question was: 'What do you two do on the show?'. 
Ant said: 'I pissed myself laughing. It wasn't the greatest introduction'. Dec 
added: 'It was almost a picture to see Simon Cowell's face because he just 
said, 'You have seen the show, haven't you Kelly?'. 'She went, 'Yeah, bits'. It 
just didn't work out." They're not kidding. More tomorrow ...
