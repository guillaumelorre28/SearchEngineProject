A brand needs to go to the heart and not to the brain. Gorilla is – in those 
90 seconds – trying to take you somewhere.
Juan Cabral, ad director

The idea of a gorilla sitting in an empty rehearsal studio, playing the drums 
to Phil Collins’s 1981 hit In the Air Tonight came to Argentinian director Juan 
Cabral fully-formed. However, he wasn’t thinking about chocolate at the time; 
he was on the set of another advert, shooting the breeze with members of the 
crew while they waited for the rain to clear so they could get their shot. The 
discussion turned to the greatest drum solos of all time and … bingo.


“We finished the shoot and I got back to the hotel and wrote down a paragraph. 
The next day I wrote it fully, all the camera moves and everything,” Cabral 
recalls. He talked to colleagues about turning the idea into a short film. But 
before that could happen, Cadbury approachedFallon London 
<http://www.fallon.co.uk/>, where Cabral was creative director, with an unusual 
brief.


“The whole business had become quite earnest and serious, when in fact it’s 
chocolate and should be more about things such as Willy Wonka,” remembers Phil 
Rumbol, director of marketing at the company at the time. “The brief I gave the 
agency was: Eating Cadbury’s chocolate makes you feel good.”

Fallon pitched “Gorilla” a week later, in March 2007, and Rumbol loved it. 

The trouble was, hardly anyone else did.

Rekindling the love

“When I saw it with my team, there was an instinctive and immediate reaction 
that it hit the brief in terms of making people feel something. When I then 
shared it with my superiors, it’s fair to say they thought I was mad. They 
said: ‘Let’s get this right. You want to make an ad that’s three times longer 
than a normal ad, has got no Cadbury’s chocolate in it and there’s no message?’”


The return on investment was three times the normal level.

What Cabral describes as the “randomness” of the ad is something that 
consumers are very used to today. But 2007 was a different time and in the wake 
of a costlysalmonella scare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/aug/03/food.foodanddrink> the 
previous year that led Cadbury to recall more than a million chocolate bars, 
the company was understandably nervous about doing anything that might further 
endanger the brand.

Rumbol, confident the ad could “rekindle the love” among consumers, 
commissioned it and set about persuading his colleagues, while Cabral got to 
work.

On the hunt for gorillas

The director went on the hunt for an animatronic gorilla costume that would be 
realistic enough to give the “documentary” feel for which he was looking. The 
advert was written very seriously, he says: “Watching it, you know it’s a joke, 
but there’s 60 seconds where nothing happens – just a gorilla and Phil Collins.”

A lot of the gorillas they saw were terrible and with computer-generated 
imagery (CGI) still in its relative infancy, there wasn’t much margin for error 
when it came to the costume itself. The director finally found what he was 
looking for at Stan Winston Studio in Hollywood, a company with success on 
films including Predator, Jurassic Park and Aliens.

There was a very promising gorilla costume knocking around that had appeared 
in the 1995 film Congo. It was female, but they beefed up the chest to get the 
look they wanted and added distinctive details such as the gold tooth you see 
when the gorilla grimaces at the camera for getting too close.

The next question was: who goes inside it? “You don’t see anything with those 
suits, so you have to just learn the scene,” says Cabral. They hired Garon 
Michael, an actor with experience in costume work, but not drumming. He 
practised the Phil Collins solo endlessly to get the right sense of a creature 
that – as Cabral describes – “has been waiting for this moment all its life”.

Filming took one day, editing another two. The final ad was presented to the 
client just over a month after it was commissioned. “I was basically told: ‘You 
are never showing this ad’,” says Rumbol. But he persevered and after four 
months got his way – Gorilla was aired during the finale of the eighth series 
of Big Brother, on 31 August 2007.

 Cadbury’s Gorilla ad. 
Sweet success 

The response from the public was overwhelmingly positive. The ad went viral, 
watched by millions on YouTube and inspiring parodies from the likes of 
Wonderbra, The Mighty Boosh and Children in Need. It won a clutch of awards, 
including the top prize atCannes Lions <https://www.canneslions.com/>, the 
advertising industry’s biggest celebration, in 2008.


It was successful in commercial terms too, prompting a sales bump of 10%. It’s 
a point that Rumbol is keen to stress: “Everyone celebrated it creatively. What 
gets talked about less is how effective it was from a business point of view. 
Having persuaded the people at Cadbury to do the ad, the return on investment 
was three times the normal level.”

Neither Cabral nor Rumbol will be drawn on the legacy of Gorilla; the advert’s 
surreal feel has been the subject of much imitation over the years. What is 
clear though is that Cabral couldn’t have made the ad any other way.

“You have to go out and flirt and seduce. You need to feel like there’s 
humanity there. If you feel there’s a corporation, the outcome is terrible,” he 
says. “The stuff that makes you send it to your friends, usually it’s because 
there’s somebody that looks like they were having fun.”
