Top seed Maria Sharapova <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/maria-sharapova> 
completed the quarter-final line-up at the Australian Open today by seeing off 
fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva 7-5, 6-4.

Sharapova was pushed all the way in a tight first set, before jumping out to a 
5-2 lead in the second. Zvoraneva showed admirable resilience at that point to 
fight back to 5-4, and appeared on course to level the set when she snatched a 
0-40 lead on Sharapova's service in the next game, but the 19-year-old saved 
all three break points before going on to take the game and the match.

Sharapova's next opponent is another Russian, Anna Chakvetadze, who beat Swiss 
eighth seed Patty Schnyder. Chakvetadze, the 12th seed, secured her place in 
the last eight with a straight sets 6-4, 6-1 victory.

"I thought I played a lot better than I did in my previous rounds but I'll 
definitely have to step it up against her," Sharapova said. "I don't know her 
game that well ... she's had some great results in the last couple of months. 
And she's a big hitter and another young Russian that's coming up so I look 
forward to that."

Regardless of her result against Chakvetadze, Sharapova will return to the top 
of the world rankings after this tournament. Current world No1 Justine 
Henin-Hardenne withdrew from the tournament before it had begun due to personal 
reasons.
