A-Rod who? The omnipresent slugger’s nickname, so long on the tip of our 
tongues, seemed long gone by the time two ballyhooed Yankees prospects bounced 
into the Bronx on Saturday. And so what was supposed to be a weekend awash with 
nostalgia – Alex Rodriguez’s departure, the honoring of the 1996 World Series 
champion Yanks and a Monument Park plaque for Mariano Rivera, became much more 
about tomorrow than yesterday.

The Yankees, for all their winning (some 27 World Series titles), have 
suffered in the past. Their most famous collapse came in 1965, when an empire 
that brought 10 titles, 15 pennants in 18 seasons, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, 
Yogi Berra and a host of Yankee elites, crumbled to the core.


The Bronx Zoo teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s – Thurman Munson, Reggie 
Jackson, Ron Guidry and later Dave Winfield – brought four pennants and two 
titles before they faded. That 1996 team restored order, bringing about an era 
that looked more like the glory years, even if they could never possibly match 
the ring count: 24 winning seasons, 18 play-off appearances, seven pennants and 
five titles.


Now, finally, the Core Four are gone 
<http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/04/watch-the-yankees-core-four-reunite-before-derek-jeters-last-home-opener>
, A-Rod is gone, and other peripheral links to their last title are fading.

The Yankees have actually been in a transition mode for several years and have 
continued to stay competitive, but now the 2016 season becomes well and truly 
about rebuilding, which doesn’t necessarily add up to doom, gloom and losing.

To the surprise of many, the energy around the stadium didn’t drop off after 
A-Rod’s big send-off – quite the contrary. Aaron Judge and Tyler Austin sizzled 
in their first game in pinstripes Saturday, both hitting home runs on debut. 
Gary Sanchez is on the verge of pushing Brian McCann out of the catching 
position and into a DH role. Clint Frazier, acquired at the trade deadline is 
their No1 prospect at Triple-A and already is acting like the next coming of 
A-Rod, trying to pick upsocial media star Jen Selter

Frazier is still in Scranton, but he obviously expects to be in the Big Apple 
shortly, possibly when the rosters expand in September.So are a host of other 
Yankee prospects <http://yanksgoyard.com/2016/08/16/yankees-september-call-ups/>
 that have seen their farm system – already beefed up over the last few seasons 
– further enhanced at the trade deadline.


In just a few days we learned that there’s more to the Yankees future than 
just waiting for Bryce Harper in 2019. Their dealing of Aroldis Chapman, Andrew 
Miller and Carlos Beltran yielded 10 prospects, plus Adam Warren, now playing a 
key set-up role in the bullpen. Three of those were top prospects, Frazier, 
shortstop Gleyber Torres and pitcher Dillon Tate.


The Yankees system is stacked, which doesn’t always measure up on a big league 
level. So the question is, can the Yankees stay competitive during their latest 
transition? Turning such a trick would make a mockery of tanking teams such as 
the Astros and Braves, clubs that chose a long, arduous road filed with pain 
and suffering while rebuilding.


Comparing smaller market rebuilds to the all-powerful Yankees might seem 
flawed, but it’s not always about the money: Brian Cashman turned an 
acquisition of Chapman for their sixth and 10th-ranked prospects into the top 
rated Torres at a cost of just over $5m. If the infielder turns into a star 
down the road it will be an inexpensive steal.


Right now it looks like the Yankees can’t lose, even when they try to. After 
dealing away their biggest chips, New York are playing with a buzz at their 
ballpark, an outside shot at the post-season and a well-defined road map 
towards the future.

Video of the week


Once upon a time, there was rumor that the reason for the foul territory 
bullpens inside AT&T Park in San Francisco was that the architect forgot to put 
them into the design. Humorous, but horse patootie. As it happens, the pens, 
which are so tight that relievers have no choice but to sit with the team in 
the dugout, were put there to allow fans to see who is warming up in a move 
designed to bring more intimacy to the game experience.

Those bullpens also brought us Monday night, when Hunter Pence tripped over 
the right-field pitcher’s mound, fell on his back, and still managed to make a 
ridiculous catch.

Quote of the Week

I’m extremely hurt, the way things are being handled. I’m not calling anyone 
names, but this is really frustrating and disappointing. This has been my 
favorite organization going back to when I was a kid, because of Rickey 
Henderson, and I’ve enjoyed playing here so much, and I’ve put it all out there 
… Up until recently, it’s been tremendously enjoyable.

That’s longtime Oakland Athletics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/oakland-athletics> outfielder Coco Crisp, 
who needs to play in 130 games for his 2017 $13m vesting option to kick in. The 
36-year-old has appeared in 93 of Oakland’s 119 games thus far, isn’t facing 
lefties and hasn’t been pinch-hitting.

Who’s closer to victory: Donald Trump or the Cubs?

This is a week that the Cubs are actually closer to being Donald Trump than an 
actual baseball team.


On Sunday night, Chicago closer Aroldis Chapman pitched an incident-free 
ninth-inning against theSt Louis Cardinals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/st-louis-cardinals>. Then the Wrigley Field 
DJ went to his archive, digging out Smack My Bitch Up, a 1990s track from The 
Prodigy. While it’s true that a parent probably doesn’t want to explain what 
smacking up a bitch is to an overtired nine-year-old pre-teen on a Sunday 
night, the selection becomes much worse when considering that Chapman served a 
30-game suspension for an alleged domestic violence incident.


The Cubs fired the DJ and apologized for the actions of their employee, one 
who recklessly called attention to their acquiring of a player accused of 
choking his girlfriend.


This sort of straight-up provocation is right in Trump’s wheelhouse, a Grade-A 
100% Trump move. And come to think of it, considering Trump’s past statements 
on women, I’m of kind surprised we haven’t heard that track at some of his 
campaign events. So with Trump carrying all the momentum ofdominant poll 
numbers in Alabama 
<https://twitter.com/williamjordann/status/765612011657060353>, and the Cubs 
suffering through a rough PR blip, Le Grande Orange gets the win this week.


How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week?

Well, some believe it may not be baseball players, but rather, Usain Bolt 
who’s rattling his cage these days.

Nine thoughts in order

1) Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully once said: “In a year that has been so 
improbable, the impossible has happened.” Those famous words, uttered as he 
calledKirk Gibson’s classic World Series home run 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U157X0jy5iw>, can also be applied to one 
Bartolo Colon. In a year that Big Sexy went deep for the very first time in his 
long career, Colon has added another missing link to his arm-length résumé: a 
walk. It took 282 career plate appearances, but the beloved 43-year-old Mets 
hurler laid off a high 3-2 fastball during what was actually an extremely 
impressive at bat against Arizona’s flame-throwing Robbie Ray. The impossible 
had finally happened.

2016 <https://twitter.com/MLBStatoftheDay/status/765389958500593665> 
The next milestone for Colon? A stolen base. 


2) Giancarlo Stanton, bopper, home run champion, launcher of moonshots: out 
for the season after a serious groin injury on Sunday. The question is, do the 
Marlins, who find themselves right in the thick of the National League wild 
card race, actually need him to compete? This season, Miami are actually 12-4 
without Stanton in the lineup and 50-53 with him. In 2015, the Fish were 30-44 
with Stanton ripping, and 41-47 with him sitting. So during that span, Miami 
are two games over .500 without him and 17 under with him.


While losing a bat the caliber of a Stanton may seem like the death knell for 
play-off baseball in southern Florida, we’re talking about a team that’s been 
competing despite an offense that’s scored the fourth fewest runs in the NL. 
Their ability to win is not entirely attached to their lineup, or the bat of 
Stanton.


3) Another team right in the play-off hunt are the Pittsburgh Pirates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/pittsburgh-pirates>, a twice scorned 
franchise still reeling off the back of their recent wild card play-off defeats.


The Pirates are desperate for a chance to lose their third wild card game, and 
have been showing signs of coming around after a frustrating season. Their 
mishmash rotation received a youthful injection that has changed the outlook 
considerably. Jamison Taillon is possibly the best rookie hurler in baseball, 
while fellow rookie Chad Kuhl has also helped solidify a starting five that 
suddenly seems more than legit. Ryan Vogelsong is back from injury, the newly 
acquired Ivan Nova is enjoying NL baseball and ace Gerrit Cole is steady 
despite being lit up his last start: that’s a far cry from a group that 
included Jon Niese, Jeff Locke and Francisco Liriano this season.


With the bullpen steadily adjusting to the loss of closer Mark Melancon, and a 
core of Francisco Cervelli, Andrew McCutchen, Jung Ho Kang, Sean Rodriguez and 
even David Freese, all scorching over the last week, there are signs that the 
Bucs may be equipped to make the play-offs for a third straight season after 
all, especially after heading out west and defeating the Dodgers and Giants in 
back-to-back series.


4) Rob Manfred appeared as a guest columnist on ESPN.com 
<http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17317663/rob-manfred-baseball-changing-quicker-ever>
 on Wednesday to point out that baseball is changing quicker than ever, and 
that it’s the commissioner’s “obligation to manage change so that the beauty of 
our game is preserved in a way that future generations continue to embrace the 
sport”. Here’s a few points Manfred made:


 * In 1975, the average game was 2 hours and 30 minutes. Now the average game 
is three hours. 
 * Back in 1988, the average major league club used 17 pitchers over the 
course of the season. In 2015, the average club used 27 pitchers … we are 
seeing less of our star starting pitchers, more delays for pitching changes, 
and less action at exciting points late in the game. 
 * Players are hitting home runs at a record pace, but the number of balls put 
in play is at a historic low. There have been more strikeouts this season than 
in any other season in baseball history since 1871. 
Obviously, the boss thinks some things do need adjusting, so it seems that 
baseball will be seeing more tweaking in coming seasons, some of which may be 
being currently negotiated with theMLB <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb> 
Players’ Association in the next collective bargaining agreement that expires 
in December.

5) ICYMI: Indians catching prospect Francisco Mejia had his 50-game hitting 
streak snapped on Sunday. Mejia, was 0-3 with a walk while playing for the 
Class-A Lynchburg Hillcats.

<https://twitter.com/MLBPipeline/status/764999968386064384> 
6) Dusty Baker says Bryce Harper needs to be left alone to get out of his 
“slump”. The reigning MVP is hitting a staggering 281 points below his 2016 OPS 
of 1.109, while his batting average has tumbled by more than 100 points.


“I’ve tried to tell him different things,” said the Nats manager. “But after a 
while, you have to come out of it on your own, because everybody in the world 
has suggestions for him. Everybody. Some of the guys come and see me. Former 
players even. After awhile, it’s ‘I don’t want to hear any more’, know what I 
mean?’”

I do Dusty, thank you. 


Now, when you have an OPS of over 1.100 as he did last season, there’s nowhere 
to go but down. What’s scarier than the decline is what happens when he starts 
hitting: the Nats already have the fourth most runs scored in the NL despite 
Harper’s “struggles”.


7) Kyle Koster of TheBigLead.com says that Tim Tebow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tim-tebow> is selling baseball memorabilia. 
Balls and bats can be yours for $125 and $175 a piece. I would love to know who 
takes real money out of their pocket and buys signed Time Tebow baseball stuff, 
and why. If anyone is willing to provide insight into this incredible 
phenomenon, please let us know.


8) It isn’t often, or ever, that a visitor to Philadelphia gets a hero’s 
welcome but that’s exactly what Chase Utley received in his first game back at 
Citizens Bank Park. Utley got plenty of brotherly love: two standing ovations 
and a curtain call while putting together another one of those nights where the 
37-year-old rose to the occasion with a pair of homers including a grand slam. 
After three years of steep declines, Utley has put together a season as 
improbable as his Dodger team, which is now in first place despite all the 
injury obstacles of the season.


9) And finally, is Jonathan Papelbon taking his throat and testicle grabbing 
services back to Boston? Papelbon was a chief offender inside the recent Nats 
bullpen blowups and was released, as per his own request, over the weekend. 
Since thenSox manager John Farrell has had chats about his returning to Fenway 
Park 
<http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/08/17/john-farrell-reached-out-to-jonathan-papelbon-on-returning-to-the-red-sox/>
, where he spent the first seven seasons of his career. Outside of a rocky June 
and July, Papelbon has pitched reasonably well, posting a 3.00 ERA in April, 
May and August. However, Papelbon would be moving from what must be the 
lightest hitting division in all of baseball into the heavy hitting AL East, so 
Sox fans will be counting on that old change of scenery factor kicking in if 
they land their former closer.
