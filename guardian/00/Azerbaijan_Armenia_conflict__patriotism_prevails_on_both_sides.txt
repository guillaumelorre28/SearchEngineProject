In both the Armenian and Azerbaijani capitals, crowds have been gathering to 
voice support for their respective militaries after four days of intense 
fighting in the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Amid an upsurge of patriotic feeling in Yerevan and Baku, Azerbaijan claimed 
on Wednesday that the terms of the ceasefire agreed to just 24 hours earlierhad 
already been broken 115 times

.

The view from Armenia

In Yerevan, members of a solidarity march said they knew of friends and family 
who had continued to board buses to the front line after Tuesday’s agreement. 
“My two cousins are back from France to go to frontline, it’s incredible,” said 
Narine Galstian.

“Armenians are the only nation in the world that emigrate during peaceful 
times, but hurry back home when war erupts,” she said.

In Yerevan’s city centre, well-known activist Helena Melkonian was joined by 
hundreds of people on Tuesday to assemble aid packages to be sent to Armenian 
soldiers. She said “recent events have united everyone” despite widespread 
distrust of the current government. “There is something warm in the air, some 
kindness that is unexpected.”

The crowd was joined by Max Sargsyan, one of the initiators of the 2015 
anti-government Electric Yerevan protests

, who said the outpouring of support was astonishing. “Prior to these events 
many people were skeptical that that people would come together, but everyone 
stood up at the critical moment. The mood is encouraging,” Sargsyan said.

Online posts alleging to show images of beheaded Armenian soldiers and the 
abandoned bodies of a group of elderly residents have further inflamed 
tensions, sewing doubt the the ceasefire will hold.

Thomas de Waal, senior associate at Carnegie Europe told the Guardian on 
Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/nagorno-karabakh-azeri-armenian-ceasefire-agreed>
 that the ongoing low-intensity fighting “completely destroys the peace 
process” and made it likely the conflict could once again escalate.

Though Karabakh is technically part of Azerbaijan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/azerbaijan> it has been run by an ethnic 
Armenian government since the collapse of the Soviet Union. By the time a 
ceasefire was agreed in 1994 around 25,000 people were believed to have been 
killed and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes.

Speaking from Yerevan, Edgar Nersisyan, who joined the crowd packing aid said: 
“Many Azerbaijanis describe Karabakh as ‘their territory’. For us it is not 
just a territory, it is our motherland. We will stand for Karabakh till the 
end.”

The view from Azerbaijan 

In the Azeri capital, similar scenes were taking place as citizens gathered to 
show their support from the other side of the disputed border conflict.

Freelance reporter and blogger Islam Shikhali organised a solidarity event on 
Wednesday for the many ordinary people who “want to show their moral and 
material support” for those caught up in the conflict.

“I was shocked when I saw hundreds of people gathering in the city centre and 
bringing different things that might be useful for daily use. We have been 
overloaded. We were 2-3 people at the beginning, then it appeared hundreds of 
young people helping each other to carry the stuff,” Shikhali said.

He said queues of people had assembled outside hospitals across the country to 
donate blood. “It is real solidarity, maybe this kind of solidarity can only be 
compared with 1990s, when the first Karabakh war started.”

The most recent clashes have involved tanks, helicopters and artillery 
concentrating fire along the contact line, a heavily mined no man’s land that 
has since the 1990s has separated Armenian-backed forces, in the foothills of 
the Karabakh mountains, from Azeri troops dug into defensive positions in the 
plains below.


“Karabakh is the value that connects all Azeris. Everyone with different 
backgrounds, from different political groups and point of view come together 
and be the one nation when it comes to Karabakh,” said Shikhali.

In 2014, both sides managed to pull back from the brink after frontline 
clashes led to the deaths of an estimated 20 soldiers on both sides. But the 
conditions that encouraged restraint two years ago may have changed, according 
to Elkhan Mehdiyev, the director of Baku’s Peace and Conflict Resolution Centre.

“Peace for Azerbaijan means the liberation of its territory, restoration of 
its sovereignty and peaceful coexistence [with Armenia],” Mehdiyev said. “A 
ceasefire is not peace.”
