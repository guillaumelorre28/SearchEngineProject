Exhibition of the week – Manet: Portraying Life

It's your last chance to see this important exhibition of a truly great 
artist. Manet's evasive, uncertain brushstrokes and jarringly beautiful colours 
make him a compelling, cool observer – the embodiment of modern attitude. He 
never ages. He never gets dull.
• Royal Academy 
<http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/manet/about-the-exhibition/>, 
London W1J until 14 April
