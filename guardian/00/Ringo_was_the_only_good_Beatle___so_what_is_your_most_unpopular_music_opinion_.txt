In the spirit of the Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> 
trend, we asked Guardian staff to share what argument they get the most flak 
for. They seemed happy to get it off their chests.

Helen Davidson: Please, no encore

I think bands should stop playing encores. Play your songs and get off stage! 
Encores used to be great. They used to be rare and exciting. Now encores are so 
ubiquitous and expected they have morphed into a second set performed after a 
weird three-minute intermission where people half-heartedly stomp their feet 
and say ‚Äúwoo‚Äù instead of going to the toilet or the bar. There is no suspense, 
no reward. No act of rebellion against the venue which stipulated an end by 
11pm. No story to tell later.

To return encores to their former spontaneous rewarding glory bands I‚Äôve 
devised these rules:

 * Decide at the last minute and only play encore if you‚Äôre having too much 
fun or if the audience deserves it. Sometimes they don‚Äôt.

 * Never save your biggest hit for the encore. Play it early or play it last. 
Or play it AGAIN for an encore. It‚Äôs your biggest hit. People like it.

 * Covers, B-sides, old duets make great encore fodder. But don‚Äôt pretend to 
be surprised by a ‚Äúspecial guest‚Äù waiting in the wings.

 * Venues need to stop giving away if an encore is coming or not with their 
house lights and music. Ditch the house music ‚Äì people talk. Turn on the house 
lights, then off again. It‚Äôs a switch.

 * If you‚Äôre going to ignore my rules, don‚Äôt write the bloody encore on the 
set list. Kids beg roadies for them at the end of the gig as a souvenir. It 
puts the deceit in writing. 
Bridie Jabour: It‚Äôs always a good time to listen to You Were Meant for Me by 
Jewel

I have loved You Were Meant for Me by Jewel since I first heard it a thousand 
years ago and it makes repeat appearances on any playlist I have whether it‚Äôs 
cleaning the house music with T Swift and Beyonc√© or running tunes with Kanye 
and Kendrick. my friends are too afraid to mock me but whenever it inevitably 
starts playing during dinner there is always an odd pause and stifled laughter. 
I don‚Äôt know why the song speaks to me so, it‚Äôs been years since I was 
heartbroken and it is still on high rotation during the happiest times of my 
life, but every time I hear Jewel hit the crescendo of ‚Äúyou were meant for 
meeeeee‚Äù my heart does a little jump for joy and I press repeat.

Tom Gottlieb: Ringo was the only good Beatle

My two favourite Beatles songs of all time are Ringo‚Äôs two solo writing 
credits, Don‚Äôt Pass Me By and Octopus‚Äôs Garden. Wonderfully crafted pop tunes. 
Also the Beatles are the most massively overrated band of all time. TheOne 
Direction <https://www.theguardian.com/music/one-direction> of their time (edgy 
hairdos, ooooh), with a better production team and better drugs. Yawn.


Alan Evans: I can‚Äôt own up to being a Deadhead

1. I have like 40 Grateful Dead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/grateful-dead> albums and still think 
they‚Äôre amazing, but it‚Äôs one of those things you‚Äôre not allowed to talk about 
because everyone is mean to you if you do.

2. Techno didn‚Äôt really get good till about 2000. That 80s stuff may as well 
not have happened for me.

3. The Beatles <https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles> are a 7/10 band, 
regardless of how influential they were.

Shalailah Medhora: ‚ÄòBest New Music‚Äô from Pitchfork? Zzz

I once walked out of a Sufjan Stevens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/sufjanstevens> concert, because staying in 
the auditorium would have legitimately put me to sleep. This caused a massive 
fight between my boyfriend at the time and I that nearly led to our break-up. 
The music was symptomatic of issues. Music can kill relationships.

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/04/coldplay-fan-confession-superbowl-new-album>
Russell Jackson: I‚Äôve happily reconciled myself to the fact that live music is 
overrated

I‚Äôm increasingly of the view that music festivals, despite promising people 
unparalleled joy, are actually one of the least fun things in the world. 
Camping? Mostly bad. Lots of people in one place? Never that great. Lots of 
drunk people in one place? Even worse. Lots of drunk people queuing for an 
always-insufficient number of portable toilets? I don‚Äôt think I need to go much 
further.

I‚Äôd go a step further and say that live music in general is about the most 
overrated form of entertainment there is. Of the hundreds of gigs I‚Äôve been to 
in my life I could count on two hands the number that are truly worthy of 
remembering and three of those were in sit-down theatres (Antony and the 
Johnsons at Hamer Hall, Gurrumul at the Palais andSpiritualized 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/spiritualized> at the Opera House). Hardly 
the Sex Pistols at Lesser Free Trade Hall ... Live music is normally just a bit 
rubbish. Realising so is perhaps a sign of age but also a liberating feeling 
too.

Merran Hitchick: I was happy when U2 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/u2> 
forcibly put their album on my phone

I love the fact that U2 and Apple teamed up in a sinister Ocean‚Äôs 11-style 
partnership to sneak Songs of Innocence on to my phone without my permission. 
Firstly, I am a lazy person. Secondly, it is a great album and I am glad it‚Äôs 
in my life. Had it been No Line on the Horizon, it would have been a different 
story. It takes guts and yes, ego, to push your music out to everyone with an 
iTunes account, knowing that at least three-quarters of Twitter will complain 
vociferously. But if you‚Äôve just recorded Song for Someone, Iris, Sleep like a 
Baby Tonight, Cedarwood Road and Raised by Wolves, then I see why you would 
feel that confident.

Nick Evershed: All of Muse‚Äôs songs are pretty much the same song. How have 
people not realised this?

Ben Doherty: Florence and the Machine can‚Äôt sing. Terrific tunes. Florence is 
always flat.

Graham Russell: Mark Morrison was never at any point a terrible singer. Return 
of the Mack set the tone for many Pommie summers.

Adam Brereton: I really like Missy Higgins and Kasey Chambers, and I will 
never apologise for that.

Mike Ticher: Most bands should split up at age 30 and never get back together 
again. Some leniency for solo artists.

Daniel Hurst: I like Meatloaf‚Äôs AFL performance and John Farnham should do 
another farewell tour. Haters gonna hate.

But our views pale in comparison to some of the radical calls being made on 
Twitter:
