Ari Folman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/25/waltz-with-bashir-ari-folman> is 
to bring the story ofAnne Frank <https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-frank> 
to the big screen with a new animated film based on her famous diary.

The untitled project has the full backing of the Anne Frank estate and will be 
aimed at children, a first for the Oscar-nominated Israeli film-maker. 
"Bringing the Anne Frank diary to all screens is a fantastic opportunity and 
challenge,"Folman, who will write and direct the movie, told The Hollywood 
Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ari-folman-write-direct-animated-665256>
. "There is a real need for new artistic material to keep the memory alive for 
younger generations."

Production is due to start in late 2014. Last week Folman won the animation 
prize at theEuropean film awards <http://www.europeanfilmawards.eu/en_EN/home> 
for his latest animated venture, The Congress, a futuristic satire of Hollywood.

Folman's best known work, the 2008 film Waltz with Bashir, won multiple prizes 
around the world and garnered an Oscar nomination for best foreign language 
film. It takes the form of an animated documentary in which the director 
searches through lost memories of his experiences as a teenage Israeli soldier 
in the 1982 war with Lebanon.
