“Parkinson’s disease” – my father never spoke these words before he died eight 
years ago from pneumonia associated with his decades-long endurance of this 
dreadful affliction.

My mother, who saw him through the worst of it until she could no longer do 
so, never said them. Neither did the doctors – not to his children at least.

Dad tried to keep the disease a secret from us even though the symptoms made 
the affliction obvious. After his death Mum said he’d never even admitted to 
her that Parkinson’s disease was killing him.

Maybe he was too proud to admit that something beyond his control, something 
so humiliating, had him in its python grip. He might’ve feared, irrationally of 
course, that we’d think less of him. Who knows? We never talked about that – 
and so much else besides.

I’ve long admired the journalism of Liz Jackson, the multi-award winning ABC 
broadcaster and film-maker. To me she has always been prominent in a milieu of 
journalists from the broadcaster who have shown us later generations the way.

And now my respect for her has grown further, having watched her heartbreaking 
documentary, A Sense of Self, about her diagnosis with – and life since – 
Parkinson’s.

Her candour and courage and humour in the face of the disease and for her 
decision to tell the story of her family’s experiences is beyond admiration. 
Ditto her dignity, in volunteering that she tried for a while to hide the 
disease from her children out of fear they might see her as weak, or colour 
their enduring impressions of her.

Then there’s her journalistic professionalism – to tell the story come what 
the hell may and probably will; the legacy grows exponentially. There is a lake 
of tears for Liz Jackson now, but not for the pity she despises. No, it’s to 
celebrate a world that can make a woman who Google-doctors her symptoms, 
understands the shitful truth of it all but continues to do brilliant work and 
goes from doctor to doctor to outrun it – and make this documentary.

Anyone familiar with Liz Jackson and who saw the program would be shocked at 
her decline. It illustrates starkly what a cruel, bastard of a disease 
Parkinson’s is, the way it robs one of bodily, intellectual and emotional 
control, and renders the previously strong so terribly, terribly prematurely 
frail.

The program is remarkable, however, for the humanity with which she emerges – 
a person defined by everything else that she is, except the disease, really.

It is one of the most moving and important pieces of television I’ve seen, for 
the way it effectively transcends its immediate subjects so that it might 
interrogate and provoke us into considering how we approach and judge and 
emotionally respond to the dreadfully ill in our midst.

Dad was completely exhausted, wrung-out – a physical husk of a man – when he 
finally succumbed. He fought and fought and never really lost he will to live 
because he loved life and his kids, and especially his grandkids, so much.

He was a modest though proud bloke. Which is perhaps why he never volunteered 
what he had. And we never pushed him. When I think back, he probably lived with 
it for 20 years. But somehow, he kept the drug regimen a secret from us.

Even in his final months at home, before we intervened to move him into 
supported living because caring for him was going to kill our elderly mother, 
he would pretend it wasn’t happening. He’d sit there in his chair, drinking tea 
or on family occasions (which he loved), wine, through a straw, his hands 
shaking so violently that we’d want to help him.

Mum would give us a look that meant, “No,” then rescue his dignity, mop up, 
without a word or missing a beat, whatever he’d spilt on the floor or himself.

Parkinson’s is a dreadful curse. But nobody knows why we get it. Those who’ve 
seen a family member succumb to it reassure themselves that it is not 
hereditary. But its very mystery is testimony to the importance of what Liz 
Jackson has done in highlighting the cruelty and tragedy that freights it.

I have several friends who’ve lost loved ones to Parkinson’s. There is no 
common experience. Not all sufferers will endure the same symptoms. Dad had 
terrible tremors, he lost the capacity to write legibly, to remember – and say 
– names, even of family members such as my wife – and eventually he had 
terrible dementia.

But he was never afflicted with the depression and the panic attacks that have 
crippled Liz Jackson.

Liz Jackson, A Sense of Self

Just as my dad was spared her panic attacks and depression, I hope she and 
other Parkinson’s sufferers are spared his dementia.

In a way that was the hardest thing for us.

The dying months of the Bulletin magazine, for which I wrote, coincided with 
Dad’s terminal decline. Dad, though he never said so, read everything I ever 
wrote.

In late 2007 I skived off the federal election campaign when John Howard’s 
caravan passed through Melbourne. He was sitting in front of a TV in the 
nursing home, the Bulletin open, on his lap, at my story.

He looked at me. His eyes were blank. He no longer seemed to know me.

Thank you again Liz Jackson.
