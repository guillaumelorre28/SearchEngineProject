After Apple’s disappointing sales figures overnight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/apple-iphone-first-revenue-decline-13-years>
, a number of iPhone suppliers have felt some of the backlash.

Arm, a weak market of late is an exception, recovering from an early fall to 
915p to add 7.5p to 935p.

But Imagination Technologies is down 5p or 3% at 157.75p and Laird is 4.4p or 
1.2% lower at 354p.

After 13 years of revenue growth the US technology group reported a 13% 
decline in quarterly sales, with the iPhone suffering its worst ever quarterly 
drop in sales. It also warned it expected sales in the next quarter to be lower 
than the forecast $47bn, sending its shares 6% lower in after hours trading. 
Liberum analysts said:

Amongst the UK suppliers, Imagination is most exposed ( around 50% of revenue 
from Apple), followed byLaird <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lairdgroup> 
(17%) and Arm (above 10%)

We already forecast a 25% year on year decline in Imagination’s graphics 
royalties in the second half of 2016 (ended April 2016) and believe new 
management set guidance conservatively when numbers were reduced.

We also believe investors should focus on Imagination’s design wins with 
MediaTek and Spreadtrum which ramp in 2017 and should be very material to 
revenue (hundreds of millions of incremental royalty units versus Imagination’s 
graphics royalties of 458m at present).

On the call Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> also said 
they were increasingly looking at M&A and we believe Imagination could be a 
target once again in time.

Regarding Laird we believe the expected rebound in the second half may now be 
at risk and investors could start to focus on Laird’s leverage - 2.3 times net 
debt/EBITDA which is high for a business with consumer electronics exposure.

Regarding ARM <https://www.theguardian.com/business/armholdings>, Apple’s 
results show that the smartphone market is slowing rapidly and around 65% of 
ARM’s royalty revenue comes from smartphones. Given Arm reports in arrears it 
also sees the weakness a quarter after its customers.

[We] would sell Arm, be increasingly cautious on Laird and use weakness to buy 
Imagination ahead MediaTek and Spreadtrum ramps.

Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 4.01 points to 6280.51 ahead of UK GDP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-figures-released-live-updates?page=with:block-572068ebe4b0ba86cb0f6414#block-572068ebe4b0ba86cb0f6414>
 and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision later on Wednesday (no 
change is expected but analysts will be looking for clues as to when a rate 
rise may happen.)

Barclays is up 2.8p at 176.75p following its figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/barclays-profit-slump-confirms-interest-africa-arm-jes-staley>
, whileWorldpay is leading the risers, up 5.8p to 264.1p after UBS moved from 
neutral to buy. The bank said:

When we initiated on Worldpay, we highlighted our positive view on the 
business opportunities, but that we struggled with the valuation. Since it 
published 2015 full year results, Worldpay has fallen by 12% while its US peers 
have risen 12%, leaving Worldpay trading in-line with peers, and we believe the 
risk/reward (+41% upside versus -26% downside) is sufficiently attractive and 
upgrade to buy from neutral. We believe that Worldpay’s significant exposure to 
online transactions and investments in new value-added services will help the 
company to outgrow its peers. We believe the business can deliver around 9% net 
revenue growth compound annual growth rate and around 17% earnings per share 
compound annual growth rate (2016 to 2020).

Back with the market generally, and Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:

We’re seeing a slightly softer start to the day’s trade in London although 
there’s certainly no shortage of earnings news needing to be digested by the 
market. Barclays is [higher] despite a drop in profits for the quarter, with 
lower impairment charges and conformation that the company is still on course 
to meet full year guidance evidently offering investors something to cheer 
here. Informa is another big gainer on the day, supported off the back of a 
broker upgrade, while it’s the commodity stocks that are once again 
languishing. The miners are seeing weakness continue from lacklustre overnight 
trade in Australia, whilstStandard Chartered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/standardchartered> is on the back foot 
once again with yesterday’s bumper gains being chipped away at – the detail 
showed even the chief executive was cautious about calling the recovery too 
soon, so there’s still the potential to see further declines in the days and 
weeks ahead.

Standard Chartered is down 21.2p at 550.2p, while BHP Billiton has fallen 
12.8p at 914p.

Elsewhere Home Retail Group, the Argos owner in the process of being taken 
over by Sainsbury, has dipped 0.9p to 169.3p after it reported a 28% fall in 
full year profits to £94.7m. But analysts at RBC said:

Home Retail <https://www.theguardian.com/business/homeretailgroup> has 
reported slightly better than expected full year results with pretax profits of 
£94.7m, 2% ahead of consensus at £93m. By division, Argos EBIT of £83.1m was 
around 5% ahead of consensus expectations owing to better opex while Homebase 
EBIT of £23.5m missed consensus expectations of £28m. The year-end cash balance 
was £623m while the underlying financing net cash position, excluding the 
impact of the Homebase transaction, was broadly flat year on year at around 
£309m.
