 In a recent interview with the Observer 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/20/antony-hegarty-interview-meltdown-gender>
, Antony Hegarty spoke about the acts he's chosen as curator of the forthcoming 
Meltdown festival. Describing the lineup as "mainly ecstatic female voices with 
a few queens thrown in", it was clear each performer – from Marc Almond to 
CocoRosie to Liz Fraser – was selected based on their relation to Antony's life 
and/or their implied role in what Antony calls the promotion of "future 
feminism". Also on the bill is Bolton's Janine Rostron, aka Planningtorock, who 
has previously said her use of vocal distortion is a form of "playing around 
with gender". For that reason alone it makes sense that she would play, and yet 
she's taken her invitation one step further by seemingly writing the festival's 
anthem with the single Patriarchy Over & Out, the first release on her DFA 
imprint, Human Level. Over a crisp, intricately woven beat that fizzes and 
hisses around a simple violin riff, Rostron intones "Patriarchal life, you're 
out of date", before a strange mid-section of delicate keyboard splashes 
creates an undulating groove. Two-thirds of the way through, that groove drops 
away and the whole thing becomes much warmer and more human, Rostron's vocal 
suddenly appearing unembellished. It all adds up to a brilliantly odd five and 
a half minutes.

• Patriarchy Over & Out is released on 12in on 30 July. Planningtorock plays 
Meltdown on 1 August.
