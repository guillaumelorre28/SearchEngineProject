The biggest problem with being a noisy neighbour is that it’s just so 
time-consuming. You have to wear your heaviest shoes, schedule all your 
arguments for the most antisocial hours and then systematically open all your 
windows before embarking on grotty, high-volume make-up sex.

And the music? Just choosing what sort of music to annoy your neighbours with 
is an almost insurmountably difficult task. Do you wear people down with blind 
repetition, like an old neighbour of mine once did with aLa Roux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/la-roux> song, or subject them to a long and 
arduous smorgasbord of fixture-shaking pop?

Luckily, the lives of all aspiring noisy neighbours just got so much easier. 
Now that Plymouth council hasthreatened a pair of 68-year-olds with an Asbo for 
playing Roy Orbison 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11689927/Pensioners-threatened-with-ASBO-for-loud-Roy-Orbison-music.html>
 hits as loudly as possible, we’ve decided to create the Ultimate Asbo Playlist 
for you. Each and every one of these songs has been the source of council 
intervention following complaints by neighbours. Here they are in one place, 
ready to help you ruin everyone’s lives for good.

If Roy Orbison can annoy people in Plymouth, he’ll annoy your neighbours, too. 
Let’s start as we mean to go on, with something relatively loud and obnoxious 
likeI Drove all Night <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5N9IHqqGcA>.

Next, we’ll copy deaf grandmother Georgina Sims, who received her Asbo in 2012 
thanks to her love of Frank Sinatra and Glenn Miller 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127691/Georgina-Sims-87-given-ASBO-banning-playing-Glenn-Miller-Sinatra-songs-loudly.html>
. Here, obviously, we want full-bombast Sinatra, soNew York, New York 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-0nNWOKK2Q> will suffice. As for Glenn 
Miller, only the sheer grinding repetition ofIn the Mood 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPXwkWVEIIw> will do.

Next, we’ll go back to 2007, when Diane Duffin from Leeds was threatened with 
an Asbo <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/6955250.stm> for 
playingDolly Parton’s 9 to 5 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaERHs8Q93E> up 
to 20 times a day. But, relax, you only need to play it once, because next up is
I Think We’re Alone Now by Tiffany <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Q3mHyzn78>
, which wasplayed by Stephen Parry so loudly this year that he actually went to 
prison for it 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-hunt-neighbour-hell-who-5825442>.

Now, a change of pace. In 2011, a Manchester man was given an Asbo for 
listening to Jazz FM too loudly 
<http://metro.co.uk/2011/08/26/musician-pascal-makonese-given-asbo-for-playing-jazz-fm-too-loudly-128340/>
. At the time of writing, the song currently playing on Jazz FM isBrazymuth by 
Azymuth <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqw6Yv991w>, so that’ll do. It’s 
certainly annoying enough.

Now for the big finale: a non-stop wham-bam of Asbo favourites. Wonderwall by 
Oasis. Faith by George Michael 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/asbo-for-buskers-who-only-knew-two-songs-1774776.html>

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFtb3EtjEic> by Andy Williams (preferably 
performed by amechanical polar bear 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-30475642>. And then, 
finally,Viva Forever <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wkuqRFXNvI> by the Spice 
Girls <http://www.nme.com/news/the-spice-girls/68464>. Play this loudly enough 
and, congratulations, your neighbours will hate you forever!
