Andy Murray's hopes of reaching his first grand slam quarter-final were ended 
in a wildly thrilling five-setter against world No2Rafael Nadal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal>.

Murray won the first and third sets to lead 2-1 but missed all sorts of 
chances to break in the fourth and fifth sets before succumbing 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 
6-4, 3-6, 1-6 in a match that lasted a shade over four hours.

"It was very, very, very tough," Nadal admitted. "Andy is playing at an 
unbelievable level. All the time I was trying my best, trying to fight for 
every point. I needed one match like this against a big player."

Nadal will next play 10th seed Fernando Gonzalez, who caused a minor upset 
when he beat fifth seed James Blake in straight sets, 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 (7-4).

Gonzalez always looked in charge as Blake made 34 unforced errors. Gonzalez 
had three match points to see out the contest, converting the second with his 
18th ace of the match.

Germany's Tommy Haas, the 12th seed, saw off David Nalbandian in four sets 
4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 to set up a quarter-final against Nikolay Davydenko.

Davydenko dropped the first set against Tomas Berdych at the Margaret Court 
Arena, but the third seed battled back for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (7-5) triumph. 
Davydenko has won his two previous encounters against Haas - in the round of 32 
at the French Open in 2005 and in the quarter-finals of last year's US Open.
