 Domino Records 
Anna Calvi on One Breath (Domino)

“I wanted to explore the feeling of being out of control, and how this can be 
very scary and yet thrilling at the same time. It’s always important to me that 
the music tells the story as much as the lyrics, so I was very focused on 
creating rich textures and a lot of atmosphere for the songs to exist in. This 
record was made during quite a turbulent time in my life and I like the way I 
can feel that in the music when I listen back.”

Jack Steadman of Bombay Bicycle Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/bombay-bicycle-club> on So Long, See You 
Tomorrow (Island Records)

“It’s great that it was our fourth album [to get nominated for the Mercury 
Prize]. Instead of starting at the top and trying to keep the momentum going, 
I’m really happy that it’s been a gradual and natural progression.”

 Parlophone Records 
Damon Albarn on Everyday Robots (Parlophone)

“It’s an album about love, loss, getting older and learning to live with that. 
I’m not consciously melancholic – in fact, I am often the opposite – so that 
melancholy feel must come from the way I use chords.”
 Stolen Recordings 
William Doyle, aka East India Youth, on Total Strife Forever (Stolen 
Recordings)

“Total Strife Forever was a really important step for me personally. I’d 
become too involved with trying to make music my career; I’d forgotten about 
trying to be creative and to express myself. When I stopped worrying about 
those things, the music seemed to come naturally. It has changed everything for 
me, and for it to receive any recognition at all has been an amazing 
experience.”

 Young Turks 
Tahliah Barnett, aka FKA Twigs, on LP1 (Young Turks)

Barnett couldn’t speak to us for this article but in June, she told Dazed & 
Confused 
<http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/20259/1/fka-twigs-future-shock>: “My 
hope for this record is that people will be able to identify my sound as a 
producer and understand how much of this I do myself. I’m being fearless and 
finding a strength in myself to be more confident, to make bolder moves. It’s a 
tough industry. People always belittle what you’re doing, your creativity. I’m 
not listening to the sly put-downs. I’m finding the strength and confidence 
within myself to ignore those voices, and do what I’m doing regardless.”

 Arlen Connelly 
Nick Blacka of GoGo Penguin on v2.0 (Gondwana Records)

“v2.0 is the band’s second album but in some ways feels more like our debut. 
After an intense three months spent writing and recording, we’ve created an 
album that better expresses our identity as a band. By bringing together our 
individual ideas and influences – everything fromArvo Pärt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/arvo-part> and Shostakovich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dmitri-shostakovich> to Aphex Twin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aphex-twin> and Four Tet via Blade Runner 
and the Manchester cityscape – we’ve created a record that’s musically more 
cohesive and sounds like us.”
 XL Recordings 
‘J’ of Jungle on Jungle (XL Recordings)

“For us, the album means everything. It taught us how to be honest with our 
creativity and to trust our instincts.”

 Big Dada Records 
Kate Tempest on Everybody Down (Big Dada)

“The album means everything to me, but now it’s finished and out, what it 
means to me isn’t important any more; what’s important is what it means to the 
people who find it and feel it. I hope it will be taken in as a whole piece. I 
hope it will feel as exciting to listen to as it felt to make. I hope it feels 
generous. I hope it lives to mean many different things to many different 
people for many different reasons. For me, it means the world. But it’s not my 
world any more. And I like that about it.”

Nick Mulvey on First Mind (Fiction Records)

“For me, this album is the result of diving head first into the unknown and 
placing full trust in my instincts. That’s why I called itFirst Mind – no 
second guessing or over-thinking. If it feels right, itis right. Truth be told, 
there were moments of doubt, that’s only natural, but instinct always 
prevailed. Faithin doubt.”

 Polar Bear by RJ Fernandez 
Seb Rochford of Polar Bear on In Each and Every One (The Leaf Label)

“The band were going through a pretty turbulent time; each of us had lots of 
different things going on, so it’s quite an intense album in that sense. It was 
really personal to me; more so than our previous albums. Pretty much all the 
songs are about specific people and my experiences with them. It’s weird: when 
we were working on this one, I would lock myself away for a month, trying to 
improve it, and not let the rest of the band listen. I think we worked harder 
for this one.”

“It’s a record that began when we first started the band, so it’s like a 
documentation of the band from our inception – in fact, some of our first demos 
are on here. By virtue of it being our debut, it obviously means a lot to us, 
and it’s great for it to be recognised among such prestigious talent.”

‘G’ Hastings of Young Fathers on Dead (Anticon / Big Dada)

“The title means no one is going to hold your fucking hand. When you’re scared 
to die, then you’re not, and you have a laugh about it. Now you can say it out 
loud with no bad juju. DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD.”
