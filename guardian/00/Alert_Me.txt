AlertMe <http://www.alertme.com/> was a Guardian Global Cleantech 100 
<https://www.theguardian.com/globalcleantech100/profiles-1-10> winner in 2009:

"AlertMe estimates that its energy-saving technology can save consumers up to 
25% of their yearly energy costs, often paying for itself in the first 12 
months and knocking one tonne off the average home's annual CO2 emissions. 
Users of its Energy Kit connect it to their home's broadband connection and 
then receive an online service that can be viewed via computer or mobile phone, 
anywhere, anytime. The package constantly measures and controls the home's 
overall energy usage and turns off or down many household appliances, thereby 
cutting energy consumption and costs."

The AlertMe portal includes cleantech coverage from the Guardian by using the 
Open Platform.
