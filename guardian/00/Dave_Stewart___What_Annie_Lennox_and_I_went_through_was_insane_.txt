In his new memoir, Sweet Dreams Are Made of This, Dave Stewart details his 
inebriated antics with Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Elton John, Bob Dylan and just 
about anyone else a Grammy nominating committee might care about. Yet, the star 
he’s most associated with – Eurythmics allyAnnie Lennox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/annie-lennox> – sometimes seem like a remote 
figure in the tome.

“I know just about every tiny molecule of Annie,” said Stewart from his home 
in Los Angeles. “I don’t think that should be shared with the world. If I wrote 
about me and Annie, it would be a completely different book.

“I can’t think of any other couple that did what we did – to break up and then 
start a band. Sonny and Cher did it the other way around: They were famous, 
then they broke up. What we went through was insane.”

In fact, the fallout from the pair’s fraught transition from lovers to 
band-mates lingered well after Eurythmics broke up in 1990, and has faint 
reverberations to this day.

“Annie’s first single, Why?, was about her relationship with me,” Stewart said.

“It was probably the first time she had a chance to sit down and say ‘what 
happened?’ When I first heard the song, and still when I hear it, I can hear 
every piece of pain that she put into it. When she sings ‘do you know how I 
feel?,’ it left a question. We’ve met hundreds of times since then and we never 
discuss our songs about each other. It’s opening up a can of worms. Who knows 
what will come out?”

If Stewart’s memoir steers clear of speculating on that, it charmingly 
deflects the issue by offering a non-stop run of sex and drug adventures, 
delivered in the flip tone of a seasoned raconteur.

“A lot of the things that happened weren’t funny at all,” Stewart admits. 
“It’s just the way you perceive it.”

To wit: in the book Stewart even manages to relay a tale of sexual abuse with 
a certain pluck. He recounts his encounter as a kid with a Scout leader who 
used to wash every member of the troop’s private parts, calling it a “hygiene 
test”.

“When you’re a kid you don’t know what’s going on,” Stewart said. “It didn’t 
seem weirdly perverse to me then – just weird.”

According to the book, Stewart began his adventures in music, sex and drugs 
early. As a teen in Sunderland, he saw the prog-folk band Amazing Blondel and 
immediately stowed away with them.

“They could have just said, ‘Kid, get a bus home,’” he said. “But they let me 
stay with them and showed me how you change strings on a lute.”

'They could have just said "kid, get a bus home" but they let me stay and 
showed me how you change strings on a lute'

By 15, Stewart was dropping acid. “Everything changed at that moment,” he 
said. “It’s a speeded-up version of sitting on a mountain for 60 years and 
meditating. ‘Ah, now I get it.’ The trouble is, it doesn’t last.”

So he kept taking the drug, up to three times a week during his teen years. He 
was also playing in bands, with success. By 18, his band Longdancer got signed 
– to Elton John’s Rocket Records, no less.

“Everything smelled of fantastic cologne,” Stewart said. “There were presents 
everywhere and Rolls-Royces. But it was totally undisciplined. The people 
running his label just handed us a bundle of money. Then we’d just go and take 
some mescaline.”

Elton was then at his peak of excess. “He was hugely high on cocaine,” said 
Stewart. “It wasn’t people having a tiny bit of cocaine wrapped in paper. It 
was mountains of it. The conversation was very excitable.”

Understandably, Longdancer went nowhere, but soon Stewart met a young hippie 
woman in a health food store: Annie Lennox.

“She was more Laura Ashley dresses and longish brown hair then,” Stewart says. 
“When I first went to her tiny bedsit she sang a song she’d written on a 
harmonium. It was like, ‘Holy shit. What are you doing as a waitress? You’re an 
artist.’”

The two helped form the Tourists, who scored hits. But their main songwriter, 
Pete Coombes, was a drug addict who was derailing the band (Coombes died of 
drug and alcohol abuse in 1997). In the wake of the Tourists’ collapse, Stewart 
and Lennox, who had been lovers since that first night he heard her sing, broke 
up. Sort of.

“Our idea of a breakup was Annie living upstairs and me downstairs,” Stewart 
says. “We were still meeting for tea.”

They also started writing songs. With punk still raging in 1980, they went in 
a fresh direction, via a synthesiser.

“I thought, ‘If I play guitar, which I know, I’ll do something regular,” 
Stewart said. “But if I play this instrument, I have no idea what I’m doing.”

The duo also innovated in presentation, with Annie adopting an androgynous 
look.

“During the punk period, being a woman at the front wearing a skirt was pretty 
wild,” Stewart said. “Lots of people were leering and sexist.”

At first, everyone thought Annie was a lesbian, a trick, says Stewart, which 
the pair enjoyed. To up the provocation, they laid S&M imagery into their 
lyrics and stage outfits.

“The record company didn’t know what we were doing. But they thought, ‘They’re 
selling millions so they can do what they want.’”

The group took off so quickly, and sold so well, Stewart and Lennox had no 
time to process the change in their relationship or the pressures of success. 
Soon Stewart began to branch out, writing hits for other stars, which Lennox 
didn’t like.

“I couldn’t help it,” he says. “Annie was more reclusive and I was out in the 
field.”

Stewart befriended Jimmy Iovine, who connected him to a wealth of stars. 
Iovine was producing the band Lone Justice, when singer Maria McKee played 
Stewart a song the company rejected, A Good Heart. Stewart promptly produced it 
for Feargal Sharkey and it went to No 1.

“She was, like, ‘Bloody hell,’” Stewart recalls. 

Another vexing switch happened with Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks. Stewart had 
written most of Don’t Come Around Here (No More) and Nicks wanted to cover it 
on an album that her boyfriend, Iovine, was producing.

But she was deep into drugs at the time and had trouble nailing it. So Iovine 
gave it to Petty who made it a smash.

Stevie “was like ‘What the fuck?’” Stewart said. “She blamed Jimmy.” 

To complicate matters, Stewart reports that a coked-up Nicks invited him to 
her house one night, snuck into his bed and seduced him. The truth came out to 
Iovine, who seemed less than concerned. They all stayed friends.

The book recounts lots of other wild stories – like the time John Belushi 
offered Stewart and Lennox heroin by laying it out on the top of a car in broad 
daylight on Sunset Boulevard. (They politely declined.) Or when Stewart tried 
to break the ice with Daryl Hall before an album project by doing mushrooms, 
which made them incapable of doing anything.

Stewart also recalls when the previous head of Hertz Rent a Car, Jose 
Menendez, suddenly became the head of the American record company RCA. Several 
years later, Menendez and his wife were murdered by their two sons in a 
notorious case.

“I knew something was really scary and odd about him,” Stewart said. 

In another chapter, Stewart recalls travelling to Mexico with Damien Hirst, 
Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed. A very high Hirst tried to convince a local 
surgeon to cut off both his hands, then reattach them, “for art”. The friends 
talked Hirst out of it.

Given Stewart’s reputation as an ace composer, director Paul Verhoeven asked 
him to compose music for the super-bomb movie Showgirls, after the earlier 
composer, Prince, did not work out. Verhoeven wanted Stewart to create 
something without seeing the script.

“I think he was doing another movie in his head,” Stewart said. 

“Some people in a band that gets huge have a myopic life,” he said. “I don’t 
feel like that. I’m always up for another adventure.”

He’s definitely had a few.
