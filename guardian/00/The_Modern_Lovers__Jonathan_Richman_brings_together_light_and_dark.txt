The young Bostonian Jonathan Richman fell under the spell of the Velvet 
Underground <https://www.theguardian.com/music/velvetunderground> as a 
teenager, and when he formed his own band, the Modern Lovers, he sought to

sensibility. Apotheosis was achieved in spring 1972 with John Cale producing, 
when the Modern Lovers laid down Roadrunner, a thrilling two-chord hymn to 
driving Boston's ring road, route 128, with the radio on for company.
