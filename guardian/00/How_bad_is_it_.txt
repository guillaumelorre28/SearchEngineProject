 My belly button hurts, has done for about a week. Can you have belly button 
ache? Not that I'm aware of, unless you've been overdoing the 'fluff' cleansing 
of late, in which case you may have scratched your navel. Have you been 
ferreting for fluff lately?

 No, and it's a bit more painful than a scratch. It's like big achy waves, and 
it's really getting me down. I can't even face eating. OK, so now you're 
worrying me. Is it just your belly button that hurts?

 Well, it's sort of along my right side, too. If I prod my side, it's a bit 
tender. Can you stop with the prodding. The fact that it's moving to your right 
side and you've lost your appetite means you could be suffering from 
early-stage appendicitis. While most cases come on with sudden symptoms (over 
about 48 hours), two per cent of people suffer symptoms for up to a fortnight 
before they seek help - you could be one of these. Other symptoms include 
constipation, nausea and vomiting. Got any of those?

No, and anyway, isn't appendicitis something you get when you're 10? I'm 43. 
Appendicitis <https://www.theguardian.com/society/appendicitis> is more common 
in children, but you can get it at any age. It occurs when the appendix, a 
little pouch off the large intestine, gets inflamed or infected, and if this 
bursts it can be dangerous.

Doesn't a dodgy appendix need removing? Or can I wait and see if it goes away? 
Best not. Stomach pain can mean a whole load of other problems, and new 
research has shown that 12 Britons died from untreated appendicitis in 2000. 
It's really hard to diagnose, and therefore the more time you give doctors to 
check things out, the better.
