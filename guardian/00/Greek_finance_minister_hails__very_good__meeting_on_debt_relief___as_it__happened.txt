Closing Summary: A good day in the Greek crisis

Long experience of the eurozone debt crisis means we shouldn’t get too excited 
tonight.

Today’s extraordinary meeting does seem to have made real progress, but the 
next two weeks could still see some turbulence. And Greece’s long-term economic 
prospects remain deeply troubled, even if it does get finally some debt relief.

But this could still be remembered as a moment when the crisis eased a little, 
meaning the eurozone could experience a summer free of debt dramas.

Three things have been agreed:

1) Greece is on the brink of receiving a much-needed slug of bailout cash 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2016/05/09/>, after 
eurozone finance ministers welcomed its latest package of austerity measures, 
tax rises and pension reforms

2) However, the eurogroup are demanding more work on contingency measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730c2f0e4b002f4e7ed873b#block-5730c2f0e4b002f4e7ed873b>
 in case Greece cannot hit its bailout targets. A compromise is being hammered 
out, which means Greece won’t have to vote specific measure into law right now.


3) In a historic step, ministers actually talked about how to cut Greece’s 
debt burden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730bebce4b07f53f216b0ca#block-5730bebce4b07f53f216b0ca>
. However, in the short-term, it is only considering relatively modest changes. 
In the medium term, though, Greece could be granted longer grace and payment 
periods. And in the long-term, further debt writedowns could be considered.

The FT’s Mehreen Kahn has dubbed it a “baby steps” approach 
<https://next.ft.com/content/fa02ab0f-e540-3922-b786-95b66569e01c>. But 
encouragingly, both sides appear happy tonight.

European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici described the situation as “work in 
good progress” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730c0fae4b002f4e7ed8735#block-5730c0fae4b002f4e7ed8735>
, suggesting that officials would make good progress before the next meeting on 
24 May.

And Greece’s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, also seemed cheerful 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730c9b7e4b0af04cb889877#block-5730c9b7e4b0af04cb889877>
, declaring that:


“It was a very good Eurogroup for Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and I think a very good Eurogroup 
for Europe.”

This point has also just echoed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras>, who is claiming success in 
his handling of the crisis.

Tsakalotos did admit, though, that there wasn’t a “meeting of minds” on the 
debt relief issue....

But there’s one major question mark tonight - we still don’t know if the 
International Monetary Fund is going to accept this plan, and come on board.

Leaving the eurogroup meeting, Finland’s Alex Stubb said this is crucial. He 
simply doesn’t have a mandate for a Finnish involvement in the Greek bailout 
unless the IMF are there too, for example.

And there would be merry hell in the Bundestag too if the IMF walked away.

So, plenty of opportunity for twists and turns in the next two weeks, until 
the eurogroup meets again on the 24 May.

For now, though, most commentators agree this has been that rare thing, a good 
day for Greece.

Tsipras welcomes move towards debt relief

Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras> is welcoming the progress 
made in Brussels today.
Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) 
Tsipras commends #Eurogroup <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurogroup?src=hash>'s 
statement on "the road map" toward debt relief for#Greece 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash> as a "necessary act of solidarity 
from Europe".

PM Tsipras calls eurogroup decisions "very positive" _ struggling Greeks

<https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/729748804132610048> 
Given the scale of last weekend’s anti-austerity protests, Tsipras is 
understandably keen to argue that he’s making progress. The commitment to debt 
relief was the only real success from last year’s bailout talks, after all.

Paul Mason, the former Channel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> 
News economics editor, has written about the Greek crisis for the Guardian 
tonight.

He argues that the call for Greek debt relief is part of a larger 
transformation in Europe:

So, now it’s no longer about austerity: there is a three-way battle for the 
soul of Europe; between a beleaguered centre that’s seeing its consent to 
govern drain away; a resurgent nationalist and racist right; and a modernised 
radical left. The Greek request for debt relief poses to the European centre 
the question: which side are you on?

Amid this, the resurgent radical left faces tough decisions of its own. To 
understand why, we have to understand the source of its recent strength. 
Podemos came out of the millions-strongindignados movement in 2011; Syriza 
expanded during the “occupation of the squares” the same year. The 188,000 
people who joined the Labour party during and after Corbyn’s campaign are not 
just trade unionists and old lefties; at their core are student activists who 
learned their politics during occupation movement of 2010/11, and hordes of 
returning Greens. Sinn Fein’s transformation and growth in Ireland is likewise 
driven by a grassroots protest movement against water charges....

Here’s the full piece:

Euclid Tsakalotos concludes his press conference by saying he expects the IMF 
to come on board and support this deal. And all sides are confident thatGreece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> can achieve its targets, meaning

The Greek government did succeed in passing pension reforms, and income tax 
changes, last night - but it could have faced a revolt if it asked for more 
detailed austerity.

Euclid Tsakalotos is now outlining the new plan for contingency measures 
(extra austerity, if needed)

If Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> misses its targets, then 
a presidential decree would enforce ‘across the line’ cuts, he says. The 
government could subsequently implement some different measures in a budget.


We think this is legally binding, and will address creditors concerns.

Tsakalotos: Great relief to start debt relief talks

Euclid Tsakalotos says there was a “very interesting exchange of views” on the 
issue of Greek debt relief today.


Ministers didn’t agree on everything, but there was a commitment to tackle the 
issue.

He also supports the ‘three-layer’ approach, to tackle Greek debt relief on a 
short, medium and long-term basis (see earlier).

It’s a “great relief” to finally have this meeting on debt relief and talk 
about the specifics, to helpGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> 
finally turn the corner.

Our expectation is that by 24 May we’ll have an agreement on fine-tuning the 
contingency measures, and we may also have agreement on debt relief too.

Greece, and our creditors, both need to feel that we are turning the page and 
that the vicious circle of measures leading to recession, leading to new 
measures, is over, Tsakalotos says.

Once we have the green light from creditors, it will give much-needed 
confidence to businesses, investors and consumers.

Greek finance minister: This was a very good eurogroup

Hang on.... Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece’s finance minister, is giving a press 
conference now.

He being by telling reporters that

This was a very good eurogroup for Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, and I think a very good eurogroup 
for Europe.

He thanks Jeroen Dijsselblom for acting as an ‘honest broker’ in the build-up 
to this meeting.

We have agreed a package of measure of fiscal measures, and structural 
reforms. And once they are legislated, funds will be dispensed to Greece.

Q: What happens if Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> does not 
legislate for extra contingency measures? And has the eurogroup made a big 
mistake by adding it at all?

No, it was a clever idea to bridge the difference between the eurogroup and 
IMF forecasts, Dijsselbloem replies to the second question. We need an 
insurance in case the pessimists (at the IMF) are right.

And on the first point, Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup has recognised 
Greece’s concerns about voting through extra austerity thatmight or might not 
be needed

We will not make the Greeks legislate specific measures up front, he says. We 
will make them legislate the mechanism, so it’s clear what happens if the 
programme goes off course.

Q: Do we need an agreement on the whole package, including debt relief, before 
the next tranche of aid is paid out?

No, it’s not necessary formally, or politically necessary either, says 
eurogroup chair Jeroen Dijsselbloem.

As long as we’re comfortable that the IMF are going to ‘come on board’ and 
support the package, we could simply move to the disbursement, he adds.

The IMF is “less optimistic, or more conservative if you will” about how 
Greece’s economy will perform by 2018, Jeroen Dijsselbloem says.

Thus, the extra contingency measures are needed, in case the Fund are right. 

The IMF agreed and supported our approach at today’s meeting, Dijsselbloem 
adds.

Eurogroup: We need the IMF on board

Q: Are you ready to go ahead with the programme without the IMF (as Slovakia’s 
finance minister suggested earlier)

No, it’s not a possibility for the eurogroup as a whole, Dijsselbloem insists.

Several members cherish the involvement of the IMF, he adds [such as Germany, 
of course].

Long experience of the eurozone debt crisis means we shouldn’t get too excited 
tonight.

Today’s extraordinary meeting does seem to have made real progress, but the 
next two weeks could still see some turbulence. And Greece’s long-term economic 
prospects remain deeply troubled, even if it does get finally some debt relief.

But this could still be remembered as a moment when the crisis eased a little, 
meaning the eurozone could experience a summer free of debt dramas.

Three things have been agreed:

1) Greece is on the brink of receiving a much-needed slug of bailout cash 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2016/05/09/>, after 
eurozone finance ministers welcomed its latest package of austerity measures, 
tax rises and pension reforms

2) However, the eurogroup are demanding more work on contingency measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730c2f0e4b002f4e7ed873b#block-5730c2f0e4b002f4e7ed873b>
 in case Greece cannot hit its bailout targets. A compromise is being hammered 
out, which means Greece won’t have to vote specific measure into law right now.


3) In a historic step, ministers actually talked about how to cut Greece’s 
debt burden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730bebce4b07f53f216b0ca#block-5730bebce4b07f53f216b0ca>
. However, in the short-term, it is only considering relatively modest changes. 
In the medium term, though, Greece could be granted longer grace and payment 
periods. And in the long-term, further debt writedowns could be considered.

The FT’s Mehreen Kahn has dubbed it a “baby steps” approach 
<https://next.ft.com/content/fa02ab0f-e540-3922-b786-95b66569e01c>. But 
encouragingly, both sides appear happy tonight.

European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici described the situation as “work in 
good progress” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730c0fae4b002f4e7ed8735#block-5730c0fae4b002f4e7ed8735>
, suggesting that officials would make good progress before the next meeting on 
24 May.

And Greece’s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, also seemed cheerful 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/09/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-meeting-bailout-live?page=with:block-5730c9b7e4b0af04cb889877#block-5730c9b7e4b0af04cb889877>
, declaring that:


“It was a very good Eurogroup for Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and I think a very good Eurogroup 
for Europe.”

This point has also just echoed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras>, who is claiming success in 
his handling of the crisis.

Tsakalotos did admit, though, that there wasn’t a “meeting of minds” on the 
debt relief issue....

But there’s one major question mark tonight - we still don’t know if the 
International Monetary Fund is going to accept this plan, and come on board.

Leaving the eurogroup meeting, Finland’s Alex Stubb said this is crucial. He 
simply doesn’t have a mandate for a Finnish involvement in the Greek bailout 
unless the IMF are there too, for example.

And there would be merry hell in the Bundestag too if the IMF walked away.

So, plenty of opportunity for twists and turns in the next two weeks, until 
the eurogroup meets again on the 24 May.

For now, though, most commentators agree this has been that rare thing, a good 
day for Greece.

Given the scale of last weekend’s anti-austerity protests, Tsipras is 
understandably keen to argue that he’s making progress. The commitment to debt 
relief was the only real success from last year’s bailout talks, after all.
 
Paul Mason, the former Channel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> 
News economics editor, has written about the Greek crisis for the Guardian 
tonight.

He argues that the call for Greek debt relief is part of a larger 
transformation in Europe:

So, now it’s no longer about austerity: there is a three-way battle for the 
soul of Europe; between a beleaguered centre that’s seeing its consent to 
govern drain away; a resurgent nationalist and racist right; and a modernised 
radical left. The Greek request for debt relief poses to the European centre 
the question: which side are you on?

Amid this, the resurgent radical left faces tough decisions of its own. To 
understand why, we have to understand the source of its recent strength. 
Podemos came out of the millions-strongindignados movement in 2011; Syriza 
expanded during the “occupation of the squares” the same year. The 188,000 
people who joined the Labour party during and after Corbyn’s campaign are not 
just trade unionists and old lefties; at their core are student activists who 
learned their politics during occupation movement of 2010/11, and hordes of 
returning Greens. Sinn Fein’s transformation and growth in Ireland is likewise 
driven by a grassroots protest movement against water charges....

Euclid Tsakalotos concludes his press conference by saying he expects the IMF 
to come on board and support this deal. And all sides are confident thatGreece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> can achieve its targets, meaning 
contingency measures may never be needed.
 
This is one reason the Greek side are happy tonight:

The Greek government did succeed in passing pension reforms, and income tax 
changes, last night - but it could have faced a revolt if it asked for more 
detailed austerity.
 
The IMF was pleased that debt relief was discussed today, says Tsakalotos, 
although obviously it wants more debt relief forGreece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> than some countries.
 
Euclid Tsakalotos is now outlining the new plan for contingency measures 
(extra austerity, if needed)

If Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> misses its targets, then 
a presidential decree would enforce ‘across the line’ cuts, he says. The 
government could subsequently implement some different measures in a budget.


We think this is legally binding, and will address creditors concerns.

Euclid Tsakalotos says there was a “very interesting exchange of views” on the 
issue of Greek debt relief today.


Ministers didn’t agree on everything, but there was a commitment to tackle the 
issue.

He also supports the ‘three-layer’ approach, to tackle Greek debt relief on a 
short, medium and long-term basis (see earlier).

It’s a “great relief” to finally have this meeting on debt relief and talk 
about the specifics, to helpGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> 
finally turn the corner.

Our expectation is that by 24 May we’ll have an agreement on fine-tuning the 
contingency measures, and we may also have agreement on debt relief too.

Greece, and our creditors, both need to feel that we are turning the page and 
that the vicious circle of measures leading to recession, leading to new 
measures, is over, Tsakalotos says.

Once we have the green light from creditors, it will give much-needed 
confidence to businesses, investors and consumers. 

 
Tsakalotos says that Greece is relieved that its contingency measures is being 
used as the basis for discussions

conference now.

He being by telling reporters that

This was a very good eurogroup for Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, and I think a very good eurogroup 
for Europe.

He thanks Jeroen Dijsselblom for acting as an ‘honest broker’ in the build-up 
to this meeting.

We have agreed a package of measure of fiscal measures, and structural 
reforms. And once they are legislated, funds will be dispensed to Greece.

Q: What happens if Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> does not 
legislate for extra contingency measures? And has the eurogroup made a big 
mistake by adding it at all?

No, it was a clever idea to bridge the difference between the eurogroup and 
IMF forecasts, Dijsselbloem replies to the second question. We need an 
insurance in case the pessimists (at the IMF) are right.

And on the first point, Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup has recognised 
Greece’s concerns about voting through extra austerity thatmight or might not 
be needed

We will not make the Greeks legislate specific measures up front, he says. We 
will make them legislate the mechanism, so it’s clear what happens if the 
programme goes off course.

And that’s the end of the press conference. I’ll do a summary now....
 
Q: Do we need an agreement on the whole package, including debt relief, before 
the next tranche of aid is paid out?

No, it’s not necessary formally, or politically necessary either, says 
eurogroup chair Jeroen Dijsselbloem.

As long as we’re comfortable that the IMF are going to ‘come on board’ and 
support the package, we could simply move to the disbursement, he adds.

The IMF is “less optimistic, or more conservative if you will” about how 
Greece’s economy will perform by 2018, Jeroen Dijsselbloem says.

Thus, the extra contingency measures are needed, in case the Fund are right. 

The IMF agreed and supported our approach at today’s meeting, Dijsselbloem 
adds.

This is vintage Eurogroup: 'The IMF is less optimistic -- or more conservative

Q: Are you ready to go ahead with the programme without the IMF (as Slovakia’s 
finance minister suggested earlier)

No, it’s not a possibility for the eurogroup as a whole, Dijsselbloem insists.

Several members cherish the involvement of the IMF, he adds [such as Germany, 
of course].
