American Hustle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/dec/05/american-hustle-christian-bale-trailer-video>
 (15)
(David O Russell, 2013, US) Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jeremy 
Renner, Jennifer Lawrence. 138 mins

Big, brassy and outrageously coiffured, this crazed 70s crime epic leads you 
into a maze, then keeps you wondering if it knows the way out. Things starts 
out small, with Bale and Adams's petty con duo turned by Cooper's ambitious 
Fed, but stakes escalate, allegiances complicate, and deceptions multiply 
deliriously, carried along by lovably flawed characters and a manic energy.

Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/oct/23/anchorman-2-the-legend-continues-watch-the-trailer-video>
 (15)
(Adam McKay, 2013, US) Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd. 119 mins

The hype is over, as Ferrell reunites his news team and drags them into New 
York, the 80s and the 24-hour era. But this sequel's absurdity, cameo-fuelled 
mayhem and mild media satire are undermined by poorly judged racial comedy, 
arbitrary characterisation and a plot so wayward, it could actually do with an 
anchor.

The Harry Hill Movie <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOr-VaJqkSY> (PG) 
(Steve Bendelack, 2013, UK) Harry Hill, Julie Walters. 88 mins

The TV jester's big-screen outing is appropriately small scale, with the 
expected puppets, props and silliness, all framed by a road trip to Blackpool 
to cure his critically ill hamster.

Walking With Dinosaurs: The 3D Movie 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khoCyld0u4Y> (U) 
(Barry Cook, Neil Nightingale, 2013, UK/US/Aus) Charlie Rowe, Karl Urban. 87 
mins

Natural history comes stomping on to family territory with this hybrid TV 
spinoff, which inserts CGI monsters into real landscapes, giving them 
child-friendly personalities.

Moshi Monsters: The Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2013/oct/17/moshi-monsters-movie-trailer-video>
 (U)
(Wip Vernooij, Morgan Francis, 2013, UK) Phillipa Alexander, Emma Tate, Ashley 
Slater. 81 mins

If you've only just got your head round Pokémon, prepare to be re-confused by 
this spinoff from the online kids' craze. It's similarly colourful but 
narratively more inventive, as the cutesy characters quest through their 
rainbow realm to retrieve the Great Moshling Egg from arch-baddie Dr 
Strangeglove.

The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jul/30/secret-life-of-walter-mitty-trailer-ben-stiller-video-exclusive>
 (PG)
(Ben Stiller, 2013, US) Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Patton Oswalt. 114 mins

Stiller (pictured) reimagines Thurber's satire as an effects-driven 
self-actualisation feelgood drama, which is a little more than it can bear. 
Instead of simply retreating into his expensively rendered daydreams, Stiller's 
office nerd strives to seize the day, get the girl and make the dream come true.

All Is Lost <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk_R04LfUQU> (12A) 
(JC Chandor, 2013, US) Robert Redford. 106 min

It's Redford versus nature in this minimalist, elemental struggle. Like Life 
Of Pi without the tiger, his sailor is pitched against the ocean, the weather, 
the faulty equipment and his inner frailties. Craggy, dogged and dignified, 
Redford proves more than capable of manning the movie solo.

47 Ronin

 (12A)
(Carl Rinsch, 2013, US) Keanu Reeves, Hiroyuki Sanada, Kô Shibasaki. 119 mins

The ambition of this east Asian action fantasy is admirable, though the 
lengthy delays and ballooning budget suggest it was too much for first-timer 
Rinsch to handle.

How To Make Money Selling Drugs <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxRVhgbVN9o> 
(18)
(Matthew Cooke, 2012, US) 90 mins

After The House I Live In, another doc demolishing America's war on drugs. 
This one talks to veterans of the game and deconstructs its appeal, as well as 
hearing from campaigners and critics.

Moon Man <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntlt2qGRqh4> (U) 
(Stephan Schesch, Sarah Clara Weber, 2012, Fra/Ger/Ire) Katharina Thalbach, 
Pat Laffan. 95 mins

Old-school 2D drawing and un-manic action make this a refreshingly gentle 
kids' story, in which the man in the moon pays a visit to earth that is ruined 
by the president's mission to destroy him.Out on Fri
