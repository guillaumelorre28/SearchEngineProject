It has been a rare 12 months for the Telegraph Media Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/telegraphmediagroup>, in that neither of its 
national newspapers changed editor.

It has been a lucrative one, too, for the group overseen by chairman Aidan 
Barclay and owned byreclusive twins Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay

. Its pre-tax profits of £58.9m were up 11% on 2009, and a startling 50% on a 
like-for-like basis.

Barclay has overseen a huge turnover in staff, including seven editors in nine 
years on the Daily and Sunday Telegraph untilTony Gallagher's appointment in 
charge of the daily paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/26/telegraph-editor-tony-gallagher> 
at the end of 2009.

Put in charge of the Telegraph Media Group in 2004 following his father and 
uncle's £665m purchase 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/22/thedailytelegraph.citynews> of 
the group, Barclay oversees the day-to-day running of the two papers and also 
another part of the Barclays' publishing empire, the Spectator.

With an estimated £2.2bn family fortune, the Barclays own the Ritz and the 
Littlewoods home shopping catalogues, and this year the family began building a 
stake in the company that owns Claridge's and the Berkeley hotel.
