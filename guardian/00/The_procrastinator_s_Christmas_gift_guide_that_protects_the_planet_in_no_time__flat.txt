It’s 22 December, and if you are among a select group of individuals who like 
to live dangerously, you have not finished – or even started –your Christmas 
shopping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/09/green-christmas-without-being-a-grinch>
. Why?

I’m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps you haven’t heard 
the incessant barrage of pop-revival Christmas carols blasting from every 
retail loudspeaker for the past month and a half. Or maybe you were caught off 
guard by the ceaseless progression of time – “December 25? Again?” Or maybe 
you’re just busy. Busy and maybe forgetful. Also, definitely doomed.
Well, today is your lucky day. I’m going to help you fix Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> with a list of thoughtful, 
unique gifts for just about everyone on your list. And the best part? You never 
have to set foot in a mall. You’re welcome.

For your partner or spouse

 A little dancing will go a long way ... Photograph: Panagiotis Moschandreou 
for the Guardian 
First of all, you should know that I’m sighing loudly. This is your person. 
They dig hair clogs out of the drain, remember your mother’s February birthday 
and put up with your nonsensical sleep-talking. In return you’ve left them 
until 22 December? Program a reminder into your phone for early November next 
year so this never happens again.

Now, in the opinion of this columnist, the best gift you can ever give your 
spouse is your time. If you live together, you may see each other a lot, but 
how muchreal time do you spend with each other, sans kids, or house projects or 
work responsibilities?

Book a mini-break in a nearby city, order breakfast in bed, wander around 
without a schedule, play tourist, and take the time to thoroughly enjoy each 
other, uninterrupted.

Alternatively, how about tackling a new skill together? Book a class with your 
partner: cooking, dancing, learning a new language or instrument, parachute 
jumping, wine degustation – all are fantastic ways to keep your mind fresh and 
your partner close. This is especially valuable because it doesn’t end on 
Christmas Day; your partner can continue enjoying it for weeks or months at a 
time.

For kids (yours or someone else’s)

How about a snow leopard? Not a real one – the time of buying exotic pets as 
gifts went out with bell bottoms – but you can sponsor an endangered animal 
through theWorld Wildlife Federation 
<https://support.wwf.org.uk/?_ga=1.40552811.894946983.1450709016>. Your monthly 
contribution supports anti-poaching initiatives, education and awareness, and 
promotes sustainable resource use in affected areas.

The WWF will send the gift recipient a plush version of the animal you 
selected (optional) and a certificate will keep your little friend updated 
through the year with a kids’ wildlife magazine. Asnow leopard

! There’s just no better way to be the cool uncle or aunt.

Alternatively, ask the child’s parents what the kid is into. A 
dinosaur-obsessed little one would go nuts for a pass to a local dinosaur 
museum, and an aspiring astronomer might love a trip to the local planetarium. 
Tailor an experience unique to the child you’re purchasing the gift for and 
they’ll be sure to love it – maybe even more than the latest gadget they’ll 
unwrap Christmas morning.


Bonus: if you take them to the museum yourself, you’re also getting a gift for 
the parents – a few hours of precious silence. Merry Christmas indeed!

Friends, close and otherwise

You were supposed to be getting together for a quick pre-Christmas coffee, 
when she mentioned that she has a “little something” for you. Well, shit.

Many non-profits have created gift catalogues in recent years, allowing 
warm-hearted individuals like you to skip generic bottles of wine or body-care 
gift baskets, and instead choose gifts which supportho

How to have a green Christmas without being a Grinch

Just because you’ve left your shopping until 22 December, I’m going to 
patronize you now with a list of helpful do-not’s, just to cover all of our 
bases.

Do not under any circumstances give a spouse a gift that’s really for you. 

Do not charge into a store and buy the first thing you see: the purchase will 
almost certainly be unwanted and go to waste, and your thoughtlessness will be 
evident.

Do not forget that it truly is the thought that counts. Think about who each 
gift is meant for. Their personality, their interests, their passions and pet 
causes. Shift gift-giving from a stressful pressure-cooker of consumer panic 
into a chance to show how well you know someone.

Better yet, use the suggestions above to ensure that this Christmas season, 
you spread love much further than your living room.

Have a very, very merry Christmas, Guardian readers!
