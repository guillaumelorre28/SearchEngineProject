Trevor Nunn 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/nov/18/trevor-nunn-life-in-theatre>'s 
dark and atmospheric 1976 production for the RSC is the yardstick by which most 
other Macbeths are measured. Ian McKellen and Judi Dench were astonishing as 
the murderous couple. Here Dench gives a masterclass in verse speaking in a 
subsequent film of the production.

Of more recent Macbeths, Rupert Goold's Chichester Festival theatre production 
with Patrick Stewart and Kate Fleetwood 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/sep/27/theatre4> is one of the most 
widely admired. Here's the Banquo's ghost scene from the filmed version.

Antony Sher's 1999 Macbeth, directed by Greg Doran 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/mar/22/gregory-doran-rsc-artistic-director>
, was terrific too. Here he is after his wife's death when he realises the 
futility of existence. Every word sounds like a sigh of regret.

Orson Welles apparently staged the play in New York in 1936 with a voodoo 
spin, but the voodoo had been dispensed with by the time he put the play on 
film in 1948. Nonetheless it's terrifically atmospheric.

As is Kurosawa's brilliant adaptation, Throne of Blood 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1999/mar/04/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm>
, which was made in 1957. Here Macbeth and Banquo have their first encounter 
with the supernatural.

Macbeth is a play surrounded by superstition. To mention its name in the 
theatre is considered bad luck and it is always called the Scottish play. This 
snippet fromBlackadder  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/oct/04/television.blackadder.anniversary>
sends up the absurd convention. What are your favourites?
