Fillon wins race to be rightwing presidential candidate

From the very first set of official results released at around 7.30pm GMT, 
François Fillon <https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-fillon> held a 
commanding lead in the rightwing primary - and he never showed the slightest 
sign of relinquishing it. About half an hour after those first results came 
out, Alain Juppé conceded, congratulating his rival on his victory.

With more than 95% of the polling stations having returned their results, 
Fillon holds 66.6% of the vote.

Congratulations were forthcoming from other members of France’s right wing as 
Fillon sought to unify his potential support to take on the left and the 
far-right alike. He said he wanted to change the country’s “software” during 
his campaign for the presidency.

Fillon is seen as a Thatcherite who has promised to shrink the French state. 
It is expected his campaign will focus on raising the retirement age to 65 and 
ending early pension rights for many in the state sector.

He is seen as socially conservative who voted against gay marriage when it was 
introduced by the Socialist president François Hollande and who has said he 
wants to amend the 2013 law to partly repeal gay adoption rights.

Juppé concedes to Fillon

With more than 80% of the polling stations now having reported, François Fillon
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-fillon> still holds a commanding 
lead, with 67.3% of the vote. His opponent Alain Juppé has conceded defeat.

Juppé told his supporters he would support Fillon at next year’s presidential 
election and asked them to stay strong and continue to fight for what they 
believe in.

Fillon, addressing his own supporters, said he needed the backing of the whole 
of the right wing and vowed to defeat the left and the far-right.

From the very first set of official results released at around 7.30pm GMT, 
François Fillon <https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-fillon> held a 
commanding lead in the rightwing primary - and he never showed the slightest 
sign of relinquishing it. About half an hour after those first results came 
out, Alain Juppé conceded, congratulating his rival on his victory.

With more than 95% of the polling stations having returned their results, 
Fillon holds 66.6% of the vote.

Congratulations were forthcoming from other members of France’s right wing as 
Fillon sought to unify his potential support to take on the left and the 
far-right alike. He said he wanted to change the country’s “software” during 
his campaign for the presidency.

Fillon is seen as a Thatcherite who has promised to shrink the French state. 
It is expected his campaign will focus on raising the retirement age to 65 and 
ending early pension rights for many in the state sector.

He is seen as socially conservative who voted against gay marriage when it was 
introduced by the Socialist president François Hollande and who has said he 
wants to amend the 2013 law to partly repeal gay adoption rights.

François Fillon <https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-fillon>, the 
socially conservative former prime minister who plans to shrink the French 
state, has won the primary race to become the French right’s presidential 
candidate next spring.

Fillon, 62, gained support in the final days of the primary race after writing 
a book on the dangers of “Islamic totalitarianism” in the wake of recent 
terrorist attacks in France and defendinga tough line on French national 
identity

Fillon vows to beat the left, as well as the far-right at next year’s 
presidential election.
 
Fillon stresses that tonight’s result marks an opportunity for France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> to reassert itself as a sovereign 
nation atop the world and he promises to fight extremists who have declared war 
on the country.
 
Fillon says France <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> needs qualities 
such as respect and pride. He says he will defend French values, adding that no 
one should feel excluded in French society and that he wants French children to 
be proud of their nationality.

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> and has had some good times and some 
pain in the future. He wishes the nation good luck, before exiting to chants 
“thank you Alain” from his supporters.


Earlier in his speech, he admitted that the results had not been as strong as 
he had hoped.
 
Juppé asks his supporters - particularly the younger people - to remain on the 
road they have walked together; to be strong and to help “rebuild the French 
economy”.
