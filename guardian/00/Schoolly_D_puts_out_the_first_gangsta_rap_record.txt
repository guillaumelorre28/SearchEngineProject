The culture may have been bubbling up in Los Angeles, but gangsta stylings 
were first put on record in Philadelphia. Over a huge drum- machine patter, 
Schoolly D's PSK What Does It Mean? pays homage to the city's Park Side Killers 
gang. Telling anyone who wasn't aware all about the guns, the drugs and the 
girls, it's a fierce performance, D's sing-song flow suffused with braggadocio. 
Some of the language is quite euphemistic by later standards, though â€“ 
something Ice-T noticed before adapting PSK for 6 in the Mornin', the west 
coast's own gangsta debut.
