In 2009, Avatar <https://www.theguardian.com/film/avatar>, James Cameron’s 3D 
spectacular featuring a disabled soldier interacting with a planet of 
blue-skinned aliens, rapidly became the highest-grossing film of all time, 
making $2.8bn.

A sequel to the film was swiftly announced, and then an entire further trilogy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/27/avatar-2-3-james-cameron>, but 
work was delayed and none of the planned movies appeared to be progressing, 
despite a mooted release date for Avatar 2 of December 2014.

But speaking to the audience at CinemaCon in San Diego on Thursday, Cameron 
revealed not only that the second film will be out at the end of 2018, but that 
another will be released each year until 2022, meaning one more movie than 
previously anticipated is in the offing.

“We have decided to embark on a truly massive cinematic process,” said 
Cameron, adding that each of the new films will function both as a standalone 
and as part of a larger saga.

“I’ve been working the last couple of years with a team of four top 
screenwriters,” he said, “to design the world of Avatar going forward: the 
characters, the creatures, the environment, the new cultures.”

“So far, the art I’m seeing is in pure imagination, really far beyond the 
first film,” he added. “It’s going to be a true epic saga.”

Cameron also used the platform to attack Sean Parker’s Screening Room 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/08/sean-parker-screening-room-new-movie-releases-home-viewing-film-industry>
, arguing that the day-in-date blockbuster screening service endangered the 
movie-going experience.

What was required, he said, was films such as Avatar, which demand a big 
screen experience. “Together we’re going to continue to make this industry the 
biggest show on earth,” he told the audience.

“It’s essential for movies to be offered exclusively in theatres on their 
initial release. So: boom.”
