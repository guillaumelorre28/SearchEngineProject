Uefa will wait for the official report from the Andorra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/andorra> versus Wales Euro 2016 qualifier 
before deciding whether a pitch described as “the worst ever” is fit to 
continue staging international matches.

The artificial surface at the Andorra la Vella national stadium has been 
called into question following Wales’s late 2-1 victory on Tuesday, with Gareth 
Bale –who scored both Welsh goals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/09/andorra-wales-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report>
 – describing the 3G pitch as “by far the worst I’ve ever played on”.

Andorra has no other pitch suitable to stage Uefa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa> qualifying matches and the European 
governing body made a decision last Wednesday to go ahead with the fixture 
after tests were carried out. It will now wait for the official report from the 
game before deciding whether future matches can be played on the same surface.

The Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> manager, Chris Coleman, 
said after his side’s win: “In my opinion the pitch is not up to the standard 
of a Uefa qualifier. But I don’t want to make a protest because I want other 
teams to come here.

“I didn’t want to say anything about the pitch before the game, but I can now 
and if you’re a passing team, forget it.”
