The Victorian government will introduce a bill to legalise assisted dying into 
parliament in the second half of 2017.

The premier, Daniel Andrews <https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-andrews>
, says an expert panel of clinical, legal, consumer and health experts will 
advise the government on drafting the legislation.

“We are doing the work to make sure that everyone in the Victorian parliament 
has the information, and assurances, they need to make an informed decision 
about this important issue,” Mr Andrews said in a statement on Thursday.

Legislation will be put to parliament in late 2017

On Thursday morning the government tabled its official response to the 
cross-party committee which in June called for limited voluntary euthanasia.

It says the report lacked legal, clinical and organisational detail regarding 
implementation.

“Further significant and detailed work would need to be undertaken considering 
the implementation of this recommendation,” the government’s response states.

“Rigorous review of the assisted dying framework should be undertaken 
including safety and quality considerations.”

The government in its response does support “end of life” plans to be made a 
part of the Victorian health system.

The Australian Medical Association opposes euthanasia and wants an “opt-out” 
option for doctors if legislation is passed so practitioners who morally object 
aren’t forced to help patients die.

However, Victorian branch president Lorraine Baker also acknowledged community 
attitudes on assisted dying had changed and said the AMA wants to be involved 
in the development of any legislation.
