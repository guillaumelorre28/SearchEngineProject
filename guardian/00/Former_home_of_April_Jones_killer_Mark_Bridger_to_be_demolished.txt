The house where schoolgirl April Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/april-jones> is believed to have been murdered 
is set to be razed to the ground.

The Welsh government has bought the detached cottage in Ceinws, near 
Machynlleth, midWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>, where April's 
killer Mark Bridger lived.

A spokesman said: "After discussions with the family, the Welsh government has 
purchased the property connected to death of April Jones. The Welsh government 
will now work with the local authority, the Jones family and the local 
community for the most appropriate future for the site following demolition of 
the property."

It is believed the Labour administration in Cardiff Bay has brokered a deal 
worth Â£149,000 with the owner of the cottage, which was rented by Bridger. The 
price paid is thought to be the 2008 market value of the house.

Bridger, 48, abducted five-year-old April as she played with friends near her 
home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth on 1 October 2012. Detectives 
believe he dismembered her body at the cottage and disposed of her remains at 
numerous locations around the countryside.

April's parents, Coral and Paul, have led calls for the house's demolition. 
They said in a Facebook post: "This is a huge weight off our minds. The loss of 
our beautiful daughter was bad enough, but the house has been a constant 
reminder of the tragic events. Our family want to thank the Welsh government 
for listening to us and for understanding our need to see the house demolished."
