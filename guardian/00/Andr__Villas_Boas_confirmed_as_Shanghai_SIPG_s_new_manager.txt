“Andre Villas-Boas is the leading young manager in European football, with a 
huge amount of passion and coaching experience,” read a Shanghai SIPG statement.

“We are convinced his arrival will enrich the tactical nous of the team, 
unearth the potential of our young talents and guide our club to scale new 
heights.”

Shanghai SIPG finished third in the recently completed Chinese Super League 
season, 12 points behind champions Guangzhou Evergrande, and will compete in an 
Asian Champions League play-off round for a spot in the 2017 tournament. 
Eriksson was sacked on Friday after being appointed in 2014.
