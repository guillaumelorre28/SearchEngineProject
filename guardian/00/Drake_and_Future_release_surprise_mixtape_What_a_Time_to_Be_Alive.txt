The 11-track What a Time to Be Alive premiered on the OVO Sound radio show on 
Beats 1 on 20 September and is now available to purchase. Most of the songs on 
the recording were produced by Metro Boomin. Producers Southside, Boi-1da and 
Noah “40” Shebib also involved with sometracks.

“It’s a little soundtrack for people that need it right now,” Drake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake> said. “I went to Atlanta for six days 
a couple weeks ago with the hopes of doing some songs with Future, and when you 
get around Future, it’s like a vortex: that guy can out-work anybody right now. 
It’s tough to see someone do four, five songs in one night and not try to match 
it.”

The title of the album comes from a Simpsons meme 
<http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-a-time-to-be-alive>, in which the character 
Jasper spots a Moonpie cookie in the Kwik-E-Mart and exclaims:“What a time to 
be alive.” <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu32fBkiHFE>

 It is the second release from Drake this year following If You’re Reading 
This It’s Too Late

, which was available as a digital release exclusively on Apple Music before 
its physical release. The rapper was one of the many artists to endorse Apple 
Music during the streaming service’s launch.

What a Time to Be Alive is available on iTunes
