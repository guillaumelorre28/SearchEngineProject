We’re going to wind down our live coverage of the verdict with a summary of 
the key points, but you can reada full story on the unexpected and definitive 
acquittal of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/meredith-kercher-amanda-knox-and-raffaele-sollecito-acquitted>
.

 * Italy’s highest court annulled the second convictions  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/meredith-kercher-amanda-knox-and-raffaele-sollecito-acquitted>
of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of 21-year-old Meredith 
Kercher in 2007. The decision ends a tortuous legal odyssey that lasted more 
than seven years and ultimately included two convictions and two acquittals for 
Knox and Sollecito. 
 * Knox said she is “tremendously relieved and grateful 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/mar/27/amanda-knox-murder-trial-italy-court-decision-live-updates#block-5515d7dae4b088ed7ca6407e>
” about the court’s decision,and thanked supporters. “To them, I say: Thank you 
from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me. I only wish that I 
could thank each and every one of you in person.” 
 * Kercher’s mother said she was “surprised and very shocked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/kercher-family-knox-sollecito-verdict-hard>
” by the decision, and the family is expected to make a formal statement on 
Saturday. “They have been convicted twice so it’s a bit odd that it should 
change now,” she said. 
 * Sollecito is “happy and incredulous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/mar/27/amanda-knox-murder-trial-italy-court-decision-live-updates#block-5515da14e4b0e2ab0f398234>
”,his lawyer told the Guardian, after the attorney herself ran from the 
courtroom shouting with joy upon hearing the judges’ ruling. “It’s a victory of 
justice. This was a mistake from the beginning,” Knox’s lawyer said. 
 * Friends and supporters of Knox took to the streets in her hometown of 
Seattle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/27/amanda-knox-acquittal-west-seattle-verdict-meredith-kercher-murder>
, telling the Guardian they were “ecstatic” about the ruling. “It was long and 
excruciating and twisted journey,” one friend said. “Hopefully people will 
leave these poor people alone.” 
 * The court’s ruling after more than 10 hours of deliberations has lifted any 
fears of further prosecution for Knox and Sollecito, and ended all speculation 
about possible extradition of Knox from the US. The judges’ reasoning in 
Friday’s decision will be released in 90 days. 
 * The third suspect in the case, Rudy Guede, remains convicted without 
question and in prison serving a 16-year sentence.

“I think that it’s a defeat for the Italian justice system,” Francesco 
Maresca, the lawyer for the Kercher’s family has said.

Earlier today, lawyer Giulia Bongiorno defended her client to Italy’s highest 
court by comparing him to Forrest Gump –she may have now cemented her 
reputation as Italy’s foremost defense attorney.
Steph Kirchgaessner (@skirchy) 
The star lawyer of the case was Giulia Bongiorno, the lawyer for Raffaele 
Sollecito <https://www.theguardian.com/world/raffaele-sollecito>.
 <https://twitter.com/skirchy/status/581581850436612096> March 27, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/skirchy/status/581581850436612096> 
My colleague Lizzy Davies has more:

As far back as 2010, our colleagues at the Observer were asking whether 
Bongiorno – “Italy’s most famous lawyer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/21/amanda-knox-appeal-italy-lawyer>
” and “possibly the only woman inItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>
 feared by Silvio Berlusconi” – would eventually win the case for Sollecito.

Bongiorno, Sollecito’s defence lawyer, is a formidable character and 
right-wing politician whose talent for persuasive rhetoric was on full display 
earlier today. She compared her client to Forrest Gump, a luckless innocent 
who, she insisted, was watching cartoons at his home at the time of Kercher’s 
murder.

She told the judges: “He is an innocent who got wrapped up in spectacular and 
gigantic events that, like Forrest Gump, he did not fully realise. Absolve him.”

Sollecito is not even Bongiorno’s most famous client, Lizzy continues. “That 
prize probably goes to footballer Francesco Totti, but former Italian prime 
minister Giulio Andreotti also had reason to be grateful to her. As a young 
lawyer, Bongiorno represented him when he was fighting charges of complicity 
with the mafia. He got off.”

The high court’s decision is “likely to be a bitter pill for the Kercher 
family to swallow,” writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner from Rome.

Throughout the saga that has followed the 21-year-old Leeds University 
student’s murder, the family has sought to stay out of the spotlight and, 
before Friday night’s verdict, had expressed steady confidence in Italy’s 
notoriously slow and backed-up legal system, saying that the multiple tiers of 
appeals were designed to arrive at the right verdict.

Although they have always been careful not to personalise the legal battle, 
the family may well find the definitive clearing of both Knox and Sollecito 
hard to fathom.

An earlier verdict by the court of cassation, which found Rudy Guede, an 
Ivorian, definitively guilty of Kercher’s murder, specified that the murder 
could not have been carried out by him alone, and that he must have had 
accomplices.

Now, the only other people who have ever been seriously considered suspects in 
the case are now to walk free, for good, as a result of the same court.

The high court’s ruling comes a little more than a year after Knox faced a 
second conviction and the possibility of extradition and continuing years of 
legal battles.

Shortly after that ruling – now overturned and put to rest by Italy’s highest 
court –Knox sat down with the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone for an interview, 
saying, “Being marked as an exoneree is one thing, but being marked as a 
criminal is another thing and it hurts. It’s not OK. I’m not OK with it. It 
makes me feel so much more isolated and branded.”

Kercher's mother 'shocked'

The mother of murdered British student Meredith Kercher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/meredithkercher> has said she was “surprised 
and very shocked” by the decision, the Press Association reports.


Arline Kercher, Meredith’s mother, said she had heard little more about the 
decision other than the verdict.


She told the Press Association: “[I am] a bit surprised, and very shocked, but 
that is about it at the moment.

“They have been convicted twice so it’s a bit odd that it should change now.” 

Asked whether she had any plans following the ruling, she said: “I really 
don’t know at the moment, I haven’t got any plans.”

Meredith Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and 
stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia,Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>.

An Ivorian man named Rudy Guede, who admitted to having sex with Kercher and 
being at her apartment on the night of the murder, was convicted for the murder 
in 2008 and is about halfway through a 16-year sentence. An earlier, separate 
court ruling had found Guede could not have acted alone.

After Knox and Sollecito’s convictions had been reinstated last year, 
Kercher’s brother Lyle said, “Nothing of course will ever bring Meredith back. 
The best we can hope for is, of course, finally bringing this whole case to a 
conclusion, and then everyone can move on with their lives.”

“I’m just ecstatic,” a friend of the Knox family tells Nicky Woolf, who is 
reporting near Knox’s home in Seattle.

“The Italian courts did the right thing,” Karen Pruett said. “It was very 
difficult for them, and we understand that, but we’re beyond pleased that they 
chose justice and truth.”

As the sound of cheers celebrations filtered out to the terrace from the 
restaurant inside, Pruett told the Guardian she thought the Knox family was 
feeling “jubilant, and relieved, and buoyant,” but also probably exhausted. “it 
was long and excrutiating and twisted journey,” she said.

“To say the least” Al Semple, from west Seattle, a long-time Knox supporter, 
who along with Julie Rogers, organised the earliest fund-raisers for Knox here 
at this restaurant by the bay, interrupted.

“This case is over,” Pruett continued. “If there’s anything that comes after 
that, it remains to be seen. Hopefully people will leave these poor people 
alone.”

Semple breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank God it’s over,” he said.

Pruett also said that she hoped Meredith Kercher’s family continued their 
campaign for justice and answers, Nicky reports.

“In my opinion,” she told the Guardian, “the case file needs to be reopened 
and examined carefully, so that the proper information is given to the Kerchers 
and they get their questions answered.”

“After 10 hours of deliberations, presiding judge Gennaro Marasca read the 
decision, repeating the word ‘annulled’ several times – and the court and 
assembled journalists, including many who are not native Italian speakers, 
initially fell silent.”

“Then there was a burst of energy,” reports Stephanie Kirchgaessner from Rome.

Giulia Bongiorno, Sollecito’s lawyer and one of the most famous defence 
attorneys inItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, began to scream 
and run out of the courtroom, even as journalists chased behind her. When a 
seemingly stunned Carlo Della Vedova, the lawyer for Knox, came out of the 
courtroom behind her, she lept into his arms and the two embraced. Even as he 
walked toward the exit, Della Vedova remained contained, saying in a hushed 
tone that such a bold decision was nearly unprecedented.

The decision to acquit both underscored the persistent questions that 
surrounded the case from the moment the pair were arrested for Kercher’s 
murder. Both attorneys for Knox and Sollecito forcefully argued that the fact 
did not add up – that the evidence was tainted, the lack of a clear motive 
suspect, and that Italian investigators had pursued the case as if it was a 
witch hunt.

Sollecito is “obviously happy and also incredulous,” his lawyer tells my 
colleague Lizzy Davies.

“He’s obviously happy and also incredulous,” Giulia Bongiorno said, but added 
that she herself was not as surprised. “I was expecting it,” she said. “This 
sentence was so obvious.”


Her comments are perhaps understated descriptions of how she and Knox’s lawyer 
Carlo Dalla Vedova feel.

Giulia Bongiorno literally jumped into Carlo Dalla Vedova's arms for a huge 
hug as they exited the courtroom.

Knox: 'tremendously relieved and grateful'

Amanda Knox has released a statement through her lawyer on the decision:

“I am tremendously relieved and grateful for the decision of the Supreme Court 
ofItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>. The knowledge of my 
innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of this ordeal.”

“And throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, 
friends, and strangers. To them, I say: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
Your kindness has sustained me. I only wish that I could thank each and every 
one of you in person.”


In a separate statement, her family said:

“We want to express our profound gratitude to all of those who have supported 
Amanda and our family. Countless people – from world-renowned DNA experts, to 
former FBI agents, to everyday citizens committed to justice – have spoken 
about her innocence.”

“We are thrilled with and grateful for today’s decision from the Supreme Court 
of Italy. And we are grateful beyond measure for all that so many of you have 
done for her.”

the key points, but you can reada full story on the unexpected and definitive 
acquittal of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito here

.

 * Italy’s highest court annulled the second convictions  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/meredith-kercher-amanda-knox-and-raffaele-sollecito-acquitted>
of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of 21-year-old Meredith 
Kercher in 2007. The decision ends a tortuous legal odyssey that lasted more 
than seven years and ultimately included two convictions and two acquittals for 
Knox and Sollecito. 
 * Knox said she is “tremendously relieved and grateful

” about the court’s decision,and thanked supporters. “To them, I say: Thank you 
from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me. I only wish that I 
could thank each and every one of you in person.” 
 * Kercher’s mother said she was “surprised and very shocked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/kercher-family-knox-sollecito-verdict-hard>
” by the decision, and the family is expected to make a formal statement on 
Saturday. “They have been convicted twice so it’s a bit odd that it should 
change now,” she said. 
 * Sollecito is “happy and incredulous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/mar/27/amanda-knox-murder-trial-italy-court-decision-live-updates#block-5515da14e4b0e2ab0f398234>
”,his lawyer told the Guardian, after the attorney herself ran from the 
courtroom shouting with joy upon hearing the judges’ ruling. “It’s a victory of 
justice. This was a mistake from the beginning,” Knox’s lawyer said. 
 * Friends and supporters of Knox took to the streets in her hometown of 
Seattle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/27/amanda-knox-acquittal-west-seattle-verdict-meredith-kercher-murder>
, telling the Guardian they were “ecstatic” about the ruling. “It was long and 
excruciating and twisted journey,” one friend said. “Hopefully people will 
leave these poor people alone.” 
 * The court’s ruling after more than 10 hours of deliberations has lifted any 
fears of further prosecution for Knox and Sollecito, and ended all speculation 
about possible extradition of Knox from the US. The judges’ reasoning in 
Friday’s decision will be released in 90 days. 
 * The third suspect in the case, Rudy Guede, remains convicted without 
question and in prison serving a 16-year sentence.  
“I think that it’s a defeat for the Italian justice system,” Francesco 
Maresca, the lawyer for the Kercher’s family has said.

The BBC’s Chris Morris succinctly tells the story of two families’ very 
different circumstances and reactions.

 feared by Silvio Berlusconi” – would eventually win the case for Sollecito.

Bongiorno, Sollecito’s defence lawyer, is a formidable character and 
right-wing politician whose talent for persuasive rhetoric was on full display 
earlier today. She compared her client to Forrest Gump, a luckless innocent 
who, she insisted, was watching cartoons at his home at the time of Kercher’s 
murder.

She told the judges: “He is an innocent who got wrapped up in spectacular and 
gigantic events that, like Forrest Gump, he did not fully realise. Absolve him.”

Sollecito is not even Bongiorno’s most famous client, Lizzy continues. “That 
prize probably goes to footballer Francesco Totti, but former Italian prime 
minister Giulio Andreotti also had reason to be grateful to her. As a young 
lawyer, Bongiorno represented him when he was fighting charges of complicity 
with the mafia. He got off.”
 
The high court’s decision is “likely to be a bitter pill for the Kercher 
family to swallow,” writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner from Rome.

Throughout the saga that has followed the 21-year-old Leeds University 
student’s murder, the family has sought to stay out of the spotlight and, 
before Friday night’s verdict, had expressed steady confidence in Italy’s 
notoriously slow and backed-up legal system, saying that the multiple tiers of 
appeals were designed to arrive at the right verdict.

Although they have always been careful not to personalise the legal battle, 
the family may well find the definitive clearing of both Knox and Sollecito 
hard to fathom.

An earlier verdict by the court of cassation, which found Rudy Guede, an 
Ivorian, definitively guilty of Kercher’s murder, specified that the murder 
could not have been carried out by him alone, and that he must have had 
accomplices.

Now, the only other people who have ever been seriously considered suspects in 
the case are now to walk free, for good, as a result of the same court.

The high court’s ruling comes a little more than a year after Knox faced a 
second conviction and the possibility of extradition and continuing years of 
legal battles.

Shortly after that ruling – now overturned and put to rest by Italy’s highest 
court –Knox sat down with the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone for an interview, 
saying, “Being marked as an exoneree is one thing, but being marked as a 
criminal is another thing and it hurts. It’s not OK. I’m not OK with it. It 
makes me feel so much more isolated and branded.”
 
The mother of murdered British student Meredith Kercher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/meredithkercher> has said she was “surprised 
and very shocked” by the decision, the Press Association reports.


Arline Kercher, Meredith’s mother, said she had heard little more about the 
decision other than the verdict.


She told the Press Association: “[I am] a bit surprised, and very shocked, but 
that is about it at the moment.

“They have been convicted twice so it’s a bit odd that it should change now.” 

Asked whether she had any plans following the ruling, she said: “I really 
don’t know at the moment, I haven’t got any plans.”

Meredith Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and 
stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia,Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>.

An Ivorian man named Rudy Guede, who admitted to having sex with Kercher and 
being at her apartment on the night of the murder, was convicted for the murder 
in 2008 and is about halfway through a 16-year sentence. An earlier, separate 
court ruling had found Guede could not have acted alone.

After Knox and Sollecito’s convictions had been reinstated last year, 
Kercher’s brother Lyle said, “Nothing of course will ever bring Meredith back. 
The best we can hope for is, of course, finally bringing this whole case to a 
conclusion, and then everyone can move on with their lives.”
 
“I’m just ecstatic,” a friend of the Knox family tells Nicky Woolf, who is 
reporting near Knox’s home in Seattle.

“The Italian courts did the right thing,” Karen Pruett said. “It was very 
difficult for them, and we understand that, but we’re beyond pleased that they 
chose justice and truth.”

As the sound of cheers celebrations filtered out to the terrace from the 
restaurant inside, Pruett told the Guardian she thought the Knox family was 
feeling “jubilant, and relieved, and buoyant,” but also probably exhausted. “it 
was long and excrutiating and twisted journey,” she said.

“To say the least” Al Semple, from west Seattle, a long-time Knox supporter, 
who along with Julie Rogers, organised the earliest fund-raisers for Knox here 
at this restaurant by the bay, interrupted.

“This case is over,” Pruett continued. “If there’s anything that comes after 
that, it remains to be seen. Hopefully people will leave these poor people 
alone.”

Semple breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank God it’s over,” he said.

Pruett also said that she hoped Meredith Kercher’s family continued their 
campaign for justice and answers, Nicky reports.

“In my opinion,” she told the Guardian, “the case file needs to be reopened 
and examined carefully, so that the proper information is given to the Kerchers 
and they get their questions answered.”
 
“After 10 hours of deliberations, presiding judge Gennaro Marasca read the 
decision, repeating the word ‘annulled’ several times – and the court and 
assembled journalists, including many who are not native Italian speakers, 
initially fell silent.”

“Then there was a burst of energy,” reports Stephanie Kirchgaessner from Rome.

Giulia Bongiorno, Sollecito’s lawyer and one of the most famous defence 
attorneys inItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, began to scream 
and run out of the courtroom, even as journalists chased behind her. When a 
seemingly stunned Carlo Della Vedova, the lawyer for Knox, came out of the 
courtroom behind her, she lept into his arms and the two embraced. Even as he 
walked toward the exit, Della Vedova remained contained, saying in a hushed 
tone that such a bold decision was nearly unprecedented.

The decision to acquit both underscored the persistent questions that 
surrounded the case from the moment the pair were arrested for Kercher’s 
murder. Both attorneys for Knox and Sollecito forcefully argued that the fact 
did not add up – that the evidence was tainted, the lack of a clear motive 
suspect, and that Italian investigators had pursued the case as if it was a 
witch hunt.
 
Sollecito is “obviously happy and also incredulous,” his lawyer tells my 
colleague Lizzy Davies.

“He’s obviously happy and also incredulous,” Giulia Bongiorno said, but added 
that she herself was not as surprised. “I was expecting it,” she said. “This 
sentence was so obvious.”


Her comments are perhaps understated descriptions of how she and Knox’s lawyer 
Carlo Dalla Vedova feel.

Amanda Knox has released a statement through her lawyer on the decision:

“I am tremendously relieved and grateful for the decision of the Supreme Court 
ofItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>. The knowledge of my 
innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of this ordeal.”

“And throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, 
friends, and strangers. To them, I say: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
Your kindness has sustained me. I only wish that I could thank each and every 
one of you in person.”


In a separate statement, her family said:

“We want to express our profound gratitude to all of those who have supported 
Amanda and our family. Countless people – from world-renowned DNA experts, to 
former FBI agents, to everyday citizens committed to justice – have spoken 
about her innocence.”

“We are thrilled with and grateful for today’s decision from the Supreme Court 
of Italy. And we are grateful beyond measure for all that so many of you have 
done for her.”
