Have Mesdames Kimberly Kardashian and Victoria Beckham ever considered writing 
child-rearing manuals?

I only ask because of their amazing ability to get their toddlers to sit 
silently in the front row of fashion shows, for which I am given to understand 
there is always a modishly long wait, and which aren’t typically viewed with 
childlike wonder by anyone other than professional fashion critics.

It seems to have been Victoria who started this trend, with little Harper 
seated on the front row

 for Mummy’s shows since infancy. She has now been followed by two-year-old
North West, who sat on Kim’s knee

 during Kanye West’s New York fashion show this week. Yet not once did I see 
Kim issuing a threat we all know she wasn’t going to follow through on, or 
getting drawn into a desperate negotiation involving sweets, or hissing: 
“Please, I will literally buy you an entire toyshop if you just do this one 
thing for me.”

Maybe it’s because they always make them sit next to Vogue editor Anna 
Wintour, whose aura looks as if it could freeze a child more swiftly than a 
joint offensive between Cruella de Vil and theChild Catcher

maybe the wall opposite is actually a giant screen playing a narcotising 
episode of In the Night Garden. Either way, enquiring minds want to know.
