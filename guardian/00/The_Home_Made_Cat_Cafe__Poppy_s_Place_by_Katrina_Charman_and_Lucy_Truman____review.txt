Eleven-year-old Isla Palmer is crazy about cats, but her mum won’t let her 
have one because she’s a vet and says the last thing she wants to do is come 
back to another animal.

One day, when Isla goes with her mum to work, she spots a beautiful black cat 
in need of a home. When the girl asks her mother if they can have it, she 
refuses. Isla’s grandma is in the story the whole time and she is the reason 
they get the cat in the end. But it is not only this cat in need of home, and 
soon the Palmer’s house is full of them.

This might seem like a dull tale but there was something that kept me wanting 
to read on, and I think it was the way it’s written. I also like the 
relationships between the characters – that’s the most important thing.
