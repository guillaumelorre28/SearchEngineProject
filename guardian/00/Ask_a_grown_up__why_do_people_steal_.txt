One of the main reasons people take things is that it is the only way for them 
to get something they want. Maybe they can't afford to pay for it, or maybe 
they want something that is not for sale. They want it so badly, they decide it 
is worth the risk, and steal it. They have weighed up how much they want 
something against the consequences of getting caught.

But sometimes people steal things they do not really want. They might be 
bored, or expressing frustration. There is a condition called kleptomania that 
gives some people an uncontrollable desire to steal random things, even if 
they're not valuable – pens, toothbrushes, socks – whereas other people steal 
things just to experience the excitement of doing something they know is wrong. 
Finally, people can steal in order to hurt other people by taking away 
something that they value. But the vast majority of people do not steal – they 
know it is wrong, unfair to the owner and creates a risk that they will be 
caught and punished.
