Ariel Pink <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariel-pink> is not an artist 
known for pandering to the mainstream. No sooner does he write a tune as catchy 
as, say, Round and Round (from 2010’s excellent Before Today album), than he 
seems determined to show the world he’s equally capable of putting out 
something utterly lacking in commercial appeal.

New album pom pom appears to be no exception. It was teased with the 
harmony-drenched, Byrdsian pop of Put Your Number In My Phone. Yet that was a 
red herring: pom pom also contains the kind of deranged, cartoon-voiced 
material – White Freckles, Jell-O – you imagine Frank Zappa might have 
considered rather far out.

Depending on your point of view, it’s either Pink doing what Pink does best 
... or a completely disorientating experience. So have a listen using the 
player below and let us know what you make of pom pom in the comments section
