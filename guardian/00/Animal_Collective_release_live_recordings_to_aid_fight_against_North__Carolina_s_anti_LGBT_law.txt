Animal Collective <https://www.theguardian.com/music/animalcollective> have 
released live recordings of two shows in order to raise money and awareness of 
the fight against North Carolina’s discriminatory HB2 law.

The band are opposed to the controversial “bathroom bill” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/lgbt-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-justice-department>
, which dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use and 
attacks the rights of LGBT citizens to sue when their human rights are violated 
in the workplace.

The band said: “We felt that cancelling our show, like many others have done 
in protest of this law, would be a disappointment to our fans and decided to go 
on with the performance. That being said, we don’t condone or agree with any 
type of bigotry or discrimination.”

Instead of pulling out of their 8 May show at the Orange Peel in Asheville, 
North Carolina, the band have uploadedaudio of two recent concerts on their 
Bandcamp page <http://anmlcollectve.bandcamp.com/> – one recorded in Los 
Angeles and one in Manchester. They are available as pay-what-you-want 
downloads and all money raised will go to Progress NC, a non-profit dedicated 
to fighting for progressive causes in North Carolina.
