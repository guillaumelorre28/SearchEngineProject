Great last question. Generally I don't start a book until I know everything 
about it, including the fact that it's probably worth writing. Frankly, life's 
too short to write ten or twenty thousand words and then throw them away. I'm 
currently writing a new novel, Magpie Murders, and I'm 90,000 words in. In 
fact, I'm off now to write the next chapter (my biggest fear being that I'll be 
run over by a bus on the way home).

Can I thank everyone for these great questions - it's been a real pleasure 
doing this with the Guardian. And thanks also to the fastest typist on the 
planet (not me).

E Broadbent asks:

Considering you’ve written sequels to both James Bond and Sherlock Holmes, 
what is your attitude towards fan fiction based off of your own work? 
Especially the Alex Rider series, as that appears to be the 32nd most popular 
book series to write fan fiction for onfanfiction.net

I shall go to fanfiction.net immediately! I had no idea this was happening. 
And I'm very moved. It's great to think that the Alex Rider stories are 
encouraging people to write, as well as read.

daveid1976 asks:

Was it difficult thinking up the title for the Bond novel without resorting to 
overused words such as “gold”, “die”, “kill”, “never”, etc?

You're certainly right about those words - to be avoided! I found a short 
story that Ian Fleming had written but not published - it was called Trigger 
Finger. I stole the first word, and then, knowing that IF liked puns, I came up 
with Mortis. I've always said that actually the title is the most difficult 
part of aJames Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond> novel. And for 
what it's worth, I thought Carte Blanche was the best title yet.

I lost my entire collection of Fantastic Four comics in a house move years 
ago. And still regret it. How many thousands would it be worth now? As a boy, I 
loved The Valiant, and would even like to write a TV series based on Kelly's 
Eye or The Steel Claw!

To be honest, I was never really given any advice - certainly not when I 
needed it when I was young. At the end of the day, I simply believed in myself. 
Which is why that's the first piece of advice I give to young writers. If you 
believe in yourself, whatever you want to do, you'll get there in the end.

Hi Anthony, took the kids to meet you here in Vancouver eons ago, may I ask 
why, in all the wonderful UK dramas, nearly every interior scene commences with 
our hero or heroine striding to the cocktails cabinet reaching for a decanter 
and pouring a “stiff one”, problem is, when watching I feel compelled to do the 
same! A wonderful device. Thanks for Foyle, what next for him? Or, sigh, is he 
done ? Cheers!

Cocktails of course are an integral part of British history, and I find 
increasingly that I need one myself as the sun goes down. I can promise you 
there are no G&Ts in New Blood.

Dear Anthony. 

Our family lore is that once upon a time we came from the town of Horovice in 
Czech Republic. It is repeated ever time we meet. A large Jewish community used 
to live there and after expulsion it kept the German name for the town as a 
name. Do you feel at least remotely connected to the town that gave you the 
name?

I believe I came from that same town in Bohemia, and yes, I do feel a sense of 
connection. At the same time, there's a certain guilt that I have never looked 
into my family's history at any great length. I suppose I live for the moment, 
but at the same time, understanding where I've come from matters. Sadly, I 
rather parted company with my religion when I was very young, and in doing so, 
I am aware that I lost a great deal. I'm always aware that religion can be 
hugely helpful to people's lives. I didn't do well at Sunday school when I was 
11 years old, and I found that I was an atheist by the time I was 13. But I say 
this with a certain amount of regret.

Think about the book you want to write, not the book you want to get 
published. Think about the narrative that matters to you. Write what you 
believe. After that? There are conventional publishers and there's the net. The 
Writers and Artists' Yearbook will give you better advice than I ever can.

I'm a huge fan of Stephen King and would love to meet him one day. I wouldn't 
dare to compare myself with him, but thanks for the implied compliment.

My favourite Stephen Kings: Firestarter, The Dead Zone, The Stand. He proves 
that great writing can be popular and populist too.

ID9799956 asks:

Power of the 5: probably my favourite children’s book. Read it a few years ago 
alongside my daughter; I am re-reading it now to my little 10-year-old. A 
classic good v evil story, yet most effective. Do you think the Old Ones have 
irreparably taken over our planet?

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/63020906> 
Wow! I hope your ten-year-old isn't having nightmares. See my earlier answer. 
The book was written out of the fear that the Old Ones, whatever they may 
represent, are gaining the upper hand. But no, it hasn't happened yet. I live 
in hope.

Ever since I was very young, I have tended to see the world in black and white 
terms. After all, I was born just ten years after the most straightforward war 
ever fought. And I suppose this has coloured my view. Of course, life is more 
complicated but the pleasure of children's books is they allow you to draw a 
simplistic line through complex issues, and that's sort of what the Power of 
Five tried to do. What happens to the world depends now much more on your 
ten-year-old son than it does on me.

But I hope that my books have helped to inform debate. The trick I suppose is 
not to moralise, not to preach, but to write good stories. That said, there are 
always messages. There are always morals. I have always been aware of the role 
books have in the life of young people especially which is why you'll have 
found me so often writing or talking about these issues.

I admire your writing, Mr. Horowitz, because you pose moral dilemmas with such 
keen insight into human nature and also extraordinary wit. Foyle’s War, 
Collision and Injustice are all brilliant... and, I have watched them all more 
than once. Unfortunately, from here in the USofA, your fans are currently 
unable to purchase a DVD set of Murder in Mind, operable in the US Region. I am 
hopeful that your upcoming series New Blood will be shown here in the US (on 
PBS), because our television has devolved into a desert of mediocrity, with few 
oases of intelligence.

Is there any way that you can encourage both BBC America to re-broadcast your 
dramas - since, many of us are sick and tired of re-runs of Top Gear, etc. ... 
And also, can you encourage the producers to seek to have both Murder in Mind 
and New Blood released in the USofA Region on DVD? ... Finally, would you 
consider adapting any novels written by other writers (e.g. Simon Brett’s 
character Charles Paris)? And, I hope that you will write another drama like 
Collision!!! Thanks from across the pond... Too bad that BBC America doesn’t 
negotiate to re-run your dramas!!

As a matter of fact, I was in Los Angeles just a week ago, working on the 
American version of Collision which is going to be made, hopefully, by NBC. 
Foyle is already shown in America, and I have every hope New Blood will be too. 
Of course I have no control over these things. But it's interesting how much of 
a cultural exchange there is in television between us and the USA - we get The 
Walking Dead and Breaking Bad. They get Downton Abbey! Who can say who is the 
winner in this arrangement.

I have enjoyed Foyle more and more. He is a hero. Was his character your

Foyle did begin with me, it's true, but all television is about collaboration, 
and the moment Michael Kitchen was cast, the character really began to develop. 
We worked together for 15 very happy years, and what was interesting was I 
always found something new to write about, in his life and relationships. Of 
course, the war came to an end, and his entire world changed - he stopped being 
a policeman, and moved into the secret service. This was a challenge but also a 
fantastic opportunity to refresh the series, and question everything we had 
taken for granted. The whole show (produced by my wife, Jill Green) has been a 
huge part of my life. And judging from how many questions there have been about 
it, even in this session, I know how much Foyle is missed. But I've already 
said, sadly, it was time to move on.

The brilliance of the James Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond> 
franchise is the way it's adapted itself to the time in which it was made. Sean 
Connery was perfect in the 60s, Daniel Craig is perfect now. It seems to me 
they can be pretty much anything... people will always enjoy them. It's hard to 
say where Bond will go next, in fact I imagine the producers will be having 
some fairly serious discussions, but Spectre has already been a resounding 
success and there's no reason to think the next one won't be too.

Dear Mr. Horowitz. I am a massive fan of your work. When other children were 
reading the Harry Potter series, I was obsessed with the Alex Rider and Power 
of Five series, in particular I can’t count how many times I read Raven’s Gate. 
My question is are you planning to revisit the Power of Five books in some 
form? Many thanks.

I would love to see the Power of Five adapted for television, and have been 
talking to producers about it. I'm told that following Game of Thrones, there 
is quite a hunger for this sort of material, but at the moment, I have nothing 
specific to report. It's great that the books are still out there, and still 
being read... they were a huge amount of work, and the message in them (for 
once there is one) meant a lot to me at the time. For those of you who don't 
know the books, they're basically Lord of the Rings set in the real world, and 
look at the eternal struggle between good and evil, but in a more realistic way 
than in some of my other work. They're about the environment, big business, 
politics, and war, but there are also monsters and witches too. The older I get 
the more I worry about the way things are going - it's only natural. I stopped 
thinking about myself, and start thinking about my children and the world 
they're going to inherit. As I say I think this is a natural part of getting 
older. All my fears for the future - along with my hopes - were expressed in 
this series.

It's quite a dark and bumpy ride but the strange thing is that I remain 
optimistic. I've always believed that every generation is smarter, and more 
successful, than the one before, and when I look at young people today (and 
here I'm thinking of New Blood again) I'm only encouraged.

Great last question. Generally I don't start a book until I know everything 
about it, including the fact that it's probably worth writing. Frankly, life's 
too short to write ten or twenty thousand words and then throw them away. I'm 
currently writing a new novel, Magpie Murders, and I'm 90,000 words in. In 
fact, I'm off now to write the next chapter (my biggest fear being that I'll be 
run over by a bus on the way home).

Can I thank everyone for these great questions - it's been a real pleasure 
doing this with the Guardian. And thanks also to the fastest typist on the 
planet (not me).

You're certainly right about those words - to be avoided! I found a short 
story that Ian Fleming had written but not published - it was called Trigger 
Finger. I stole the first word, and then, knowing that IF liked puns, I came up 
with Mortis. I've always said that actually the title is the most difficult 
part of aJames Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond> novel. And for 
what it's worth, I thought Carte Blanche was the best title yet.

I lost my entire collection of Fantastic Four comics in a house move years 
ago. And still regret it. How many thousands would it be worth now? As a boy, I 
loved The Valiant, and would even like to write a TV series based on Kelly's 
Eye or The Steel Claw!

To be honest, I was never really given any advice - certainly not when I 
needed it when I was young. At the end of the day, I simply believed in myself. 
Which is why that's the first piece of advice I give to young writers. If you 
believe in yourself, whatever you want to do, you'll get there in the end.

Hi Anthony, took the kids to meet you here in Vancouver eons ago, may I ask 
why, in all the wonderful UK dramas, nearly every interior scene commences with 
our hero or heroine striding to the cocktails cabinet reaching for a decanter 
and pouring a “stiff one”, problem is, when watching I feel compelled to do the 
same! A wonderful device. Thanks for Foyle, what next for him? Or, sigh, is he 
done ? Cheers!

Cocktails of course are an integral part of British history, and I find 
increasingly that I need one myself as the sun goes down. I can promise you 
there are no G&Ts in New Blood.

Dear Anthony. 

Our family lore is that once upon a time we came from the town of Horovice in 
Czech Republic. It is repeated ever time we meet. A large Jewish community used 
to live there and after expulsion it kept the German name for the town as a 
name. Do you feel at least remotely connected to the town that gave you the 
name?

I believe I came from that same town in Bohemia, and yes, I do feel a sense of 
connection. At the same time, there's a certain guilt that I have never looked 
into my family's history at any great length. I suppose I live for the moment, 
but at the same time, understanding where I've come from matters. Sadly, I 
rather parted company with my religion when I was very young, and in doing so, 
I am aware that I lost a great deal. I'm always aware that religion can be 
hugely helpful to people's lives. I didn't do well at Sunday school when I was 
11 years old, and I found that I was an atheist by the time I was 13. But I say 
this with a certain amount of regret.

Think about the book you want to write, not the book you want to get 
published. Think about the narrative that matters to you. Write what you 
believe. After that? There are conventional publishers and there's the net. The 
Writers and Artists' Yearbook will give you better advice than I ever can.

I'm a huge fan of Stephen King and would love to meet him one day. I wouldn't

My favourite Stephen Kings: Firestarter, The Dead Zone, The Stand. He proves 
that great writing can be popular and populist too.

Power of the 5: probably my favourite children’s book. Read it a few years ago 
alongside my daughter; I am re-reading it now to my little 10-year-old. A 
classic good v evil story, yet most effective. Do you think the Old Ones have 
irreparably taken over our planet?

Wow! I hope your ten-year-old isn't having nightmares. See my earlier answer. 
The book was written out of the fear that the Old Ones, whatever they may 
represent, are gaining the upper hand. But no, it hasn't happened yet. I live 
in hope.

Ever since I was very young, I have tended to see the world in black and white 
terms. After all, I was born just ten years after the most straightforward war 
ever fought. And I suppose this has coloured my view. Of course, life is more 
complicated but the pleasure of children's books is they allow you to draw a 
simplistic line through complex issues, and that's sort of what the Power of 
Five tried to do. What happens to the world depends now much more on your 
ten-year-old son than it does on me.

But I hope that my books have helped to inform debate. The trick I suppose is 
not to moralise, not to preach, but to write good stories. That said, there are 
always messages. There are always morals. I have always been aware of the role 
books have in the life of young people especially which is why you'll have 
found me so often writing or talking about these issues.

I admire your writing, Mr. Horowitz, because you pose moral dilemmas with such 
keen insight into human nature and also extraordinary wit. Foyle’s War, 
Collision and Injustice are all brilliant... and, I have watched them all more 
than once. Unfortunately, from here in the USofA, your fans are currently 
unable to purchase a DVD set of Murder in Mind, operable in the US Region. I am 
hopeful that your upcoming series New Blood will be shown here in the US (on 
PBS), because our television has devolved into a desert of mediocrity, with few 
oases of intelligence.

Is there any way that you can encourage both BBC America to re-broadcast your 
dramas - since, many of us are sick and tired of re-runs of Top Gear, etc. ... 
And also, can you encourage the producers to seek to have both Murder in Mind 
and New Blood released in the USofA Region on DVD? ... Finally, would you 
consider adapting any novels written by other writers (e.g. Simon Brett’s 
character Charles Paris)? And, I hope that you will write another drama like 
Collision!!! Thanks from across the pond... Too bad that BBC America doesn’t 
negotiate to re-run your dramas!!

As a matter of fact, I was in Los Angeles just a week ago, working on the 
American version of Collision which is going to be made, hopefully, by NBC. 
Foyle is already shown in America, and I have every hope New Blood will be too. 
Of course I have no control over these things. But it's interesting how much of 
a cultural exchange there is in television between us and the USA - we get The 
Walking Dead and Breaking Bad. They get Downton Abbey! Who can say who is the 
winner in this arrangement.

Foyle did begin with me, it's true, but all television is about collaboration, 
and the moment Michael Kitchen was cast, the character really began to develop. 
We worked together for 15 very happy years, and what was interesting was I 
always found something new to write about, in his life and relationships. Of 
course, the war came to an end, and his entire world changed - he stopped being 
a policeman, and moved into the secret service. This was a challenge but also a 
fantastic opportunity to refresh the series, and question everything we had 
taken for granted. The whole show (produced by my wife, Jill Green) has been a 
huge part of my life. And judging from how many questions there have been about 
it, even in this session, I know how much Foyle is missed. But I've already 
said, sadly, it was time to move on.

The brilliance of the James Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond> 
franchise is the way it's adapted itself to the time in which it was made. Sean 
Connery was perfect in the 60s, Daniel Craig is perfect now. It seems to me 
they can be pretty much anything... people will always enjoy them. It's hard to 
say where Bond will go next, in fact I imagine the producers will be having 
some fairly serious discussions, but Spectre has already been a resounding 
success and there's no reason to think the next one won't be too.

Dear Mr. Horowitz. I am a massive fan of your work. When other children were

My question is are you planning to revisit the Power of Five books in some

I would love to see the Power of Five adapted for television, and have been 
talking to producers about it. I'm told that following Game of Thrones, there 
is quite a hunger for this sort of material, but at the moment, I have nothing 
specific to report. It's great that the books are still out there, and still 
being read... they were a huge amount of work, and the message in them (for 
once there is one) meant a lot to me at the time. For those of you who don't 
know the books, they're basically Lord of the Rings set in the real world, and 
look at the eternal struggle between good and evil, but in a more realistic way 
than in some of my other work. They're about the environment, big business, 
politics, and war, but there are also monsters and witches too. The older I get 
the more I worry about the way things are going - it's only natural. I stopped 
thinking about myself, and start thinking about my children and the world 
they're going to inherit. As I say I think this is a natural part of getting 
older. All my fears for the future - along with my hopes - were expressed in 
this series.

It's quite a dark and bumpy ride but the strange thing is that I remain 
optimistic. I've always believed that every generation is smarter, and more 
successful, than the one before, and when I look at young people today (and 
here I'm thinking of New Blood again) I'm only encouraged.

I have absolutely no idea. For what it's worth, if I was working on the film,
