The acclaim for Anna Nicole, based on the tragic life of Playboy centrefold 
Anna Nicole Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/anna-nicole-smith>, is a 
thrilling reminder that, even in hard times, there need be no recession in 
ideas or imagination. The confident way in which Tony Hall's Royal Opera House 
launched a bold and innovative contemporary opera has resonated round the 
world. If that wasn't enough, Covent Garden will see a second world premiere 
and glittering spectacle this month, Christopher Wheeldon'sAlice's Adventures 
in Wonderland, the first full-length ballet for 16 years. This glorious spring 
awakening brings some sunshine to a drab season of cuts. The ROH has taken a 
chance and it looks set to have paid off.
