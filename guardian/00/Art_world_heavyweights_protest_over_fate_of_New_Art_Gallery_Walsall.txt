Leading figures in the British art world, from Grayson Perry to incoming Tate 
director Alex Farquharson, have written aletter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/nov/30/closure-of-new-art-gallery-walsall-would-be-a-devastating-blow>
 to the Guardian protesting against the potential closure of a gallery in the 
West Midlands that has been a prototype for others.

The New Art Gallery Walsall <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/walsall> faces 
closure after local government funding cuts left the council needing to make 
£85m of savings over the next four years.

The letter, which had 35 signatories including artists and gallery and theatre 
directors, expresses “deep concern” that the gallery might fall victim to 
austerity and describes the art space as “a symbol of the social and economic 
regeneration of Walsall”.

The gallery opened in 2000 at a public cost of £21m. Its success in drawing in 
audiences from the local area, as well as providing a much-needed fillip to 
Walsall, an area in which 40% of children live in poverty, has been used as a 
template for regional galleries that opened subsequently, including the 
Hepworth Wakefield, the Turner Contemporary in Margate and the Middlesbrough 
Institute of ModernArt <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art>.

As well as Perry and Farquharson, others objecting to the potential closure 
include Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Gallery; Iwona 
Blazwick, director of the Whitechapel Gallery; Judy Kelly, artistic director of 
the Southbank Centre; Jonathan Reekie, director of Somerset House, and the 
artist Richard Wentworth.

The letter stresses that the 3,000 works that make up the gallery’s 
collection, which includes paintings by Vincent van Gogh, Amedeo Modigliani, 
JMW Turner, Lucien Freud and Claude Monet, was a testament to its important 
presence in the British art world and ensured such prestigious works could be 
seen by those who live outside of London.

“The gallery’s closure would be a devastating blow to the life of the 
community and send a signal that the authorities have no regard for the value 
of the arts to those very communities,” says the letter.

Under the proposals, Walsall council would stop funding the gallery. This 
would leave it with just the £880,000 a year it receives from the Arts Council. 
However, without local backing, the gallery is likely to be seen as unviable 
and therefore not eligible for further funding, which would lead to closure.

A closure would also undermine the ambitions by the Arts Council to support 
more regional institutions, outside of London, to ensure funding is more evenly 
spread. The New Art Gallery was among those singled out by Sir Nicholas Serota 
this year when he announced he would be leaving the Tate to become chairman of
Arts Council England <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/arts-council-england>.

Serota said there had been a transformation in the public’s appreciation of 
the visual arts over the past 30 years, which was driven by “national and 
regional museums and the new galleries that have opened across the country in 
places like Walsall, Margate, Wakefield, Gateshead and Nottingham”.

The decision about the fate of New Art Gallery will be made by the council on 
23 February. However, the gallery has to submit its Arts Council funding 
application for the next four years by 31 January, before it knows how much 
future funding, if any, it will be given by Walsall council. This puts the 
entire grant application at risk.

As well as the threat to the art gallery, all but one of Walsall’s 16 libraries

 are under consideration for closure. The petition to save them has more than 
2,500 signatures.
