Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ange-postecoglou> has slammed ANZ 
stadium’s pitch, declaring he’s embarrassed to have hosted Greece on such a 
shoddy playing surface.

In a heated spray after Saturday night’s 1-0 friendly win, Postecoglou 
delivered a damning assessment on the torn-up surface he said was cheating fans 
and had the potential to put Australia’s World Cup qualification in jeopardy.

Stadium officials ruled the well-draining pitch fit for play despite heavy 
rain on Friday night which followed Wednesday night’s State of Origin opener.

However, the morass proved a challenge for both teams in the match, decided by 
Mathew Leckie’s 93rd-minute winner.

“I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it, I’m really embarrassed,” 
Postecoglou said. “We’ve got an international team here that we’re hosting and 
we’re supposed to be the sporting nation of the world.

“The crowd were fantastic [but] I felt sorry for them ... it’s just not good 
enough.

“Hopefully other people take notice, because we’re representing our country.

“I can tell you what the Greek players were saying when they were coming off 
the pitch and they’re too polite to say anything publicly.

“But I’m embarrassed, as coach of our national team, that that’s what we dish 
up.

“We have world-class venues, world-class atmospheres, our supporters are 
second to none – we love our sport.

“But in our game and our game alone, the pitch is actually an essential part 
of the spectacle.

“If that’s not good then we’re cheating people.”

Postecoglou, who has called for a football-only venue in Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>, said the inadequate playing 
surface let down fans who had come to watch the Socceroos play their high-tempo 
game.

And while this was a friendly, important competitive matches lay ahead from 
September, when Australia will host five of their 10 World Cup qualifiers 
including a hit-out with tough rivals Japan.

“Our whole World Cup qualification could hinge on it,” Postecoglou said. “Do 
we not want the conditions to suit us? To present a pitch that suits our style 
of game to get that advantage?

“I’m sure when we play in Japan they will, so we shouldn’t have to prove we’re 
some sort of pedigree before we get what I think our nation deserves.”

Skipper Mile Jedinak described the pitch as “pretty shocking”.

“Being a Sydney-sider it’s something I’m not very proud of, something 
seriously needs to be done,” he said.

“It wasn’t the prettiest, it wasn’t nice ... you’re asking these teams to come 
out here and travel all the way from Europe, it’s not the way you want the game 
to be presented.

“If it was a crucial game and we needed the win, and with our style of play, 
would we accept it? It’s not ideal that’s for sure.”
