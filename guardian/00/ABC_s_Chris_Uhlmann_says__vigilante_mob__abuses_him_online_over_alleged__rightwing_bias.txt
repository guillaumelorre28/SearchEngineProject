The ABC’s political editor Chris Uhlmann said there was an online “vigilante 
mob” who loved to attack him for what they perceive as his rightwing bias.

“Quite frankly, there is now this vigilante mob that exists online, that 
basically congregates the minute it smells blood,” Uhlmann told Guardian 
Australia after he was criticised for linking the South Australian blackout to 
the state’s use of renewable energy.

“For whatever reason, years ago, they decided that in their estimation I was 
too conservative to be on the ABC. Isn’t that the bottom line, that these 
people think that?”

Conversely, the former 7.30 and AM host said, he was subjected to jibes from 
another group who assume he is a Labor supporter because he is married to Gai 
Brodtmann, Labor MP for the seat of Canberra.

Uhlmann said the two groups “don’t read each other” so criticise him from a 
different perspective: “There [is] a group of people who think that my marriage 
proves that I’m aLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> supporter.”

Uhlmann, 56, said his reputation as a rightwinger at the ABC had sprung from 
his earlier career, first as a seminarian and then as a political candidate and 
staffer with a conservative independent in the ACT legislative assembly.

Uhlmann stood unsuccessfully for a seat in 1998 on a ticket with Christian 
independent Paul Osborne, and then worked as his senior adviser. Later that 
year he joined the ABC in Canberra.

But that same experience, he said, has also informed his response to his 
critics.

“It’s like living in the 12th century and saying, ‘Look, I believe in God, I 
read the Bible, I go to church. I just have a few issues with the bishops and 
the inquisitors,’ ” he said.

I, once upon a time, considered myself middle of the road
Chris Uhlmann 
 “Having come from the church I recognise these people. This is the same bag 
of intolerant bastards that I used to deal with when I was in the seminary. 
It’s that ‘outside the church there is no salvation’ [attitude].”

Separately he said the critics were “absolutely not” getting him down and he 
was intent on taking them on.

“It’s [like] the kid who grew up having to change school every two years and 
was bullied in the playground and was a coward for his whole life, basically,” 
he said. “Who got to a point in secondary school where he thought, you know 
what? They might beat the shit out of me but I’m going to fight.

“They did beat the shit out of me but I felt a whole lot better about myself.”

In an interview with the Canberra Times in 2014 
<https://web.archive.org/web/20140729193413/http://www.smh.com.au/national/chris-uhlmann-and-gai-brodtmann-a-very-canberra-couple-20140620-3ajmd.html>
, Uhlmann described himself as “more conservative” than his wife and said they 
disagreed on the repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act: “It’s 
an insidious, creeping assault on free speech.”

He said online critics read his Wikipedia profile and assumed he is on the 
conservative side. “Isn’t that saying that there is an expectation in the left 
that everybody in the ABC actually is from the left?

“I, once upon a time, considered myself middle of the road ... My father 
started out as a communist, ended up as dyed-in-the-wool Labor and died 
basically by returning to being a communist. That was the family that I came 
out of.

“When I was growing up all the Catholics I knew were Labor party voters … and 
I didn’t think that people were anything but Catholic or voted Labor. And I am 
married to a Labor member of parliament.”

Uhlmann said critics jumped on an interview he conducted with the then Greens 
leader,Bob Brown <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bob-brown>, in 
2011 on 7.30. A complainant to the media watchdog, the Australian Communication 
and Media Authority (Acma) said he had “aggressively” interrupted Brown.

The ABC stood by the interview and Acma later cleared it of bias.

Uhlmann: “I asked him several times in an interview on 7.30 how he would 
replace the $50bn in lost revenue. People got very angry about that. That was a 
complaint that went all the way … I think we got 500 complaints after that.”

The ABC has received 180 complaints about the coverage of the South Australian 
blackout, including the analysis by Uhlmann on News 24 and online which some 
viewers thought was too quick to blame renewable energy in the states.

1. ABC coverage of the SA blackout was clearly driven by its political editor 
Chris Uhlmann. He staked an editorial position very early

2. Leveraging the ABC's cross-platform capabilities, Uhlmann appeared on 
radio, TV and online. Across all he pushed an anti-renewables line

3. Uhlmann's editorial line appeared to based on a pre-existing view, rather 
than reportage. For instance, he did not quote AEMO's statement

<https://twitter.com/beneltham/status/781675870628917248> 
“Mr Uhlmann did not attribute the power outage to reliance on renewables,” an 
ABC spokeswoman said. “However, he did point out the combination of previous 
price spikes and the South Australian blackout has put the issues of the 
security of the electricity network and the structure of the national energy 
market firmly on the political agenda. That is demonstrably true.”


The complaints will be considered by the ABC’s independent audience and 
consumer affairs section <>.
