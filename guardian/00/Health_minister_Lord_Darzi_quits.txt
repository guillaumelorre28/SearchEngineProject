Gordon Brown today lost another expert outsider drafted into his "government 
of all the talents" whenAra Darzi <https://www.theguardian.com/society/aradarzi>
 quit as health minister, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family 
and on his medical consultancy work.

Downing Street said Lord Darzi's departure did not reflect any political 
disillusionment with the government but his departure comes only a week after 
another independent ministerial adviser, Lord Malloch Brown, the foreign office 
minister, announced he was quitting.

Brown praised Darzi and gave him a series of non-ministerial roles, including 
a role as the government's health and life sciences ambassador. Darzi, who 
played a key role in reorganising theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs>, said in his resignation statement: 
"During my time as a minister, I have maintained my clinical practice and 
research. The time has now come for me to return to care for my patients, lead 
my academic department, and continue my research full time."

He added: "Making quality the organising principle of the NHS has revitalised 
professional pride, created great appetite for improvement, and built enormous 
momentum. This movement for change is now embedded across the NHS and will 
continue for many years to come.

The Conservative health spokesman, Andrew Lansley, said: "This was surely 
coming for a long time. Ara Darzi's laudable focus on quality was increasingly 
at odds with the Brownite fixation with targets and command and control."
