ITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> has announced plans to cut 120 
jobs due to “political and economic uncertainty”, particularly concerns over 
the possible impact of Brexit.

UK broadcasters are facing the worst year for TV advertising since 2009, with 
total revenues set todecline by up to 2%

.


The announcement on Monday comes three months after ITV’s chief executive, 
Adam Crozier <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-crozier>, said the 
broadcaster would look to make £25m in cost savings next year following the 
Brexit vote on 23 June.


ITV intends to make the cuts across the business, but does not plan to reduce 
its annual programming budget of more than £1bn. The company has 3,000 staff in 
the UK, out of 6,000 globally, with US-based employees forming its next largest 
workforce.


“At a time of political and economic uncertainty in our key markets, it’s 
important that we are in the strongest possible position to continue to invest 
in our strategy, and to meet any challenges and opportunities ahead, as we 
continue to grow a successful business,” an ITV spokesman said.

Fears about the impact of Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/21/advertising-spend-to-take-220m-hit-over-brexit-fears-says-wpp>
 and a rapid softening of the UK advertising market are the paramount reasons 
for the job cuts.

ITV is dependent on the performance of the UK market, which accounted for 85% 
of the near-£3bn the broadcaster made last year.

Crozier has spent hundreds of millions of pounds attempting to reduce the 
company’s reliance on the UK, primarily by building a large TV production 
operation in the US.

But ITV’s historical dependence on advertising meant that last year, TV ads 
and sponsorship accounted for more than half, about £1.7bn, of revenues.

“We have taken costs out across ITV in a managed and sensible way over the 
past six years and we must continue to keep a tight control on spending to 
ensure that we are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible, while 
maximising our ability to invest in the high-quality programming that drives 
ITV’s success,” the ITV spokesman said.


The company has estimated that in the first nine months of 2016, ad revenue 
would be down 1% year on year.

Prior to the EU referendum, the ad market had been expected to grow by more 
than 7%, after a7.4% increase in 2015

.


Media agencies, which book advertising on behalf of clients, have said the TV 
advertising market has become considerably worse in the past five or so weeks 
amid concerns about a “hard Brexit”.

Last month, ITV’s share price tumbled after Crozier and the finance director, 
Ian Griffiths, cashed in £2m of shares, as some investors worried that this 
could be a sign its stock market price may be close to peaking.

Last month it emerged that Daily Mail and General Trust, the owner of the 
Daily Mail, hascut more than 400 jobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/29/daily-mail-cost-cuts-dmgt> over 
the past year. Fewer than half came from DMG Media, the division that includes 
the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and freesheet Metro, as newspaper publishers 
continue to face a tough advertising market.

This month, the BBC said it would make redundant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/13/bbc-studios-cut-staff-songs-of-praise-holby>
 more than 300 programme makers as part of a move to spin off its £400m TV 
production operation, which makes shows including EastEnders and Strictly Come 
Dancing.
