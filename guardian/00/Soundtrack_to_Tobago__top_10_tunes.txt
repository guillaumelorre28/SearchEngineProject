One of the first songs that anyone who plays steel pan in Trinidad and Tobago 
will have learned is the national anthem. Pan – invented in the 20th century – 
is the national instrument and integral to the musical culture of the islands. 
Different bands, based in "pan yards", attract loyal followings as fierce as 
any football team. If you're on the island in the run up to carnival, drop into 
a pan yard to hear the bands practising for the Panorama competition. Try the 
Katzenjammers in Black Rock, the Buccooneers in Buccoo or the Redemption 
Soundsetters in Bethel.

At other times of the year, you can catch the Buccooners at Tobago's weekly 
street party, Sunday School. Held on the seventh day (but not the place to seek 
religious guidance), it attracts locals, tourists and a wide range of ages to 
the village of Buccoo. The evening kicks off with live music, local food and 
arts and crafts stalls. But if you're after soca, dancehall and R&B, the sound 
system starts around 11pm, and will play until the "wining" stops.

Shurwayne Winchester – Tobago Love <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-74Yv9w6Fw>

The contribution to this year's carnival from Tobago's most successful 
contemporary soca artist, Shurwayne Winchester, is a song about a woman's 
insistent need for "the sweet Tobago love" – neatly combining two of soca's 
most popular themes, sex and patriotism. Soca, essentially up-tempo, modernised 
calypso, is party music – and the soundtrack of carnival.

Carnival, which takes place just before the start of Lent (in February or 
March), is officially two days long – but the buildup is year-round, with the 
preparation, anticipation and excitement woven into every aspect of life. While 
its heart is in Trinidad, this "carnival mentality" spills over into the more 
laid-back Tobagonian mindset. If you don't make it to Port of Spain, jump up 
with the mud bands that parade through Scarborough on Carnival Monday for 
J'ouvert, which marks the official start of carnival and lasts from the small 
hours of the morning until the sun comes up. Winchester's 2005 hit epitomises 
how islanders feel about the country's biggest party – yes, he'll spend his 
rent money on a carnival costume and chance getting fired: the road's callin'.

"When he building or she planting/ Everybody helping, no money ent passing/Is 
tradition on the island/Nowhere else that I know is like sweet Tobago"

Lord Nelson's 1981 calypso about the island celebrates the feeling of 
community and togetherness in Tobago, while also serving as a reminder to 
Trinidad and Tobago citizens – plus the rest of the region – that "All ah we is 
one family".

The Tobago-born calypsonian's 1977 song is a love song to Tobago. Having left 
the island after school to pursue the American dream, Lord Nelson sings to his 
"sweet, sweet Tobago", asking her to wait for him.

Calypso's first lady and Tobago treasure, Calypso Rose, was the first woman to 
win the carnival Road March competition and Calypso King contest, in 1977, 
resulting in it being renamed Calypso Monarch in her honour. Born in Bethel, 
she moved to Trinidad as a young girl and remembers seeing a man stealing a 
pair of glasses from a lady in the market. Having never witnessed crime like 
that in Tobago, she was moved to write her first calypso, aged 15, warning 
Tobagonians to stay at home and avoid visiting their dangerous sister isle. 
Still performing in her 70s, she refers to this tune as her Tobago anthem.

Lord Kitchener – Ode to Tobago <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSxo7jQlO_s>

A major force in the world of calypso, Lord Kitchener's 1969 ode to the island 
acknowledged its emerging status as a playground for Britain's rich and famous. 
After Princess Margaret's decision to honeymoon there during the 1950s, the 
island hosted the Beatles, Robert Mitchum and Rita Hayworth: "It is said, it's 
the land of tomorrow/Princess Margaret say "Come Tobago for holiday/Now the 
whole world say "Come Tobago for holiday".

Calypso has traditionally been a vehicle for biting political or social 
satire, and Lord Melody's 1979 song – about the "people in Tobago, they want to 
run their own show" – is no different. Commenting on the island's battle for 
self-governance that was playing out at the time, he lampoons the politicians 
warring over the issue who hadn't previously "given a damn about Tobago".

Widely acclaimed as the greatest calypsonian of them all, the Mighty Sparrow 
was known for tackling serious issues through his lyrics, from prostitution in 
military bases to the government's pay-as-you-earn tax policy. Celebrated as a 
loveable rascal, Sparrow lauds Tobago's women in this one.

Sending up warring couples - and perhaps the island's reputation for romance - 
Kitch's version of Tobago Love in this calypso is getting the fright of his 
life, after being attacked and then having it explained that "that's the way 
that Tobago women make love".
