Twenty-eight years after reaching her first Australian Open final, Martina 
Navratilova <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/martina-navratilova> has served 
her way into another.

The 46-year-old, partnered India's Leander Paes - a one-year-old baby when she 
lost that final in 1975 to Evonne Goolagong- to reach the mixed doubles 
championship match.

Defending champions Kevin Ullyett and Daniela Hantuchova had no answer to 
Navratilova and Paes's court craft and doubles acumen and the crowds' 
favourites ran away with the match 6-3, 6-1.

Navratilova now looks short and slight compared to the heavy-hitting giants of 
the modern game, but she has lost none of her ability around the net.

Volleying superbly and serving with great authority, Navratilova put herself 
one step away from a 39th grand slam doubles title.

The US-Indian duo face Australia's Todd Woodbridge and Greek Eleni Daniilidou 
in the final. Navratilova quit tennis in 1994 but returned six years later to 
play occasional doubles.

The holder of 18 grand slam singles titles and 31 women's grand slam doubles 
crowns, Navratilova last won a major title in the mixed event at Wimbledon in 
1995, teamed with Jonathan Stark.
