It's probably fair to say that no band's reputation has been as founded on as 
little as that of the Crucial Three. They never recorded, never played live, 
rehearsed together only once, spending more of their time arguing about the 
Doors than actually writing anything. And yet they attained mythic status, 
partly because the band's three members – Julian Cope,Ian McCulloch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ian-mcculloch> and Pete Wylie – all ascended 
from indie fame to chart stardom in the early 80s and partly because the trio 
were such rampant egotists they never stopped referring to the Crucial Three in 
interviews and, occasionally, songs.
