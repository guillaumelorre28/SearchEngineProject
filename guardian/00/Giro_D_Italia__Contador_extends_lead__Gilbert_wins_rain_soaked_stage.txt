Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> extended 
his overall lead in the Giro dâ€™Italia while Philippe Gilbert snatched a 
last-gasp stage win in a rain-soaked 12th stage on Thursday.

 The Belgian burst clear of the pack with around 400 metres left as they 
climbed to the finish at Vicenza in pouring rain after a 190 kilometre stage 
from Imola.

 Contador was second, three seconds behind, as he led the peloton across the 
finish line.

 After picking up six bonus seconds, the Spaniard extended his lead over Fabio 
Aru in the overall standings to 17 seconds.

 Italian Aru came in at the back of the group after losing ground on his rival.

 Franco Pellizotti attacked around 15 kilometres from the end and was joined 
by Tanel Kangert.

 The pair opened up a gap of 24 seconds with only three kilometres left but, 
after Kangert broke clear, they were reeled in by the chasing pack.

 Gilbert, 32, then sped away to claim the second Giro stage win of his career. 

Elsewhere in the race, there was a nasty crash around 25km from the end of the 
stage.

BMC later announced that Stefan Kung, the reigning world individual pursuit 
champion on the track, had suffered a compression fracture of a vertebrae in 
the crash.

The 21-year-old Swiss rider faces around 3-4 months out with the injury.
