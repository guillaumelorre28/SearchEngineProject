A recent Guardian Guide feature couldn't get enough of Ariel Pink 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/11/ariel-pink-hes-out-there> – and we 
agree. His brilliant album Before Today made our top 10 albums of 2010, and now 
he's back with a follow-up entitled Mature Themes.

His ninth official release, Mature Themes sees the man the Guardian praised as 
a "hyper-intelligent, pot-bellied, beady-eyed, apple-bong-smoking composer from 
Beverly Hills" finding his pop side – the title track and Only in My Dreams 
both have a delightful jangle. But for fans of Pink's more leftfield leanings 
there are still tracks as detuned and downright strange as Schnitzel Boogie, 
which features someone making fast food orders.

We love it, but what do you think? Have a listen using the player embedded
