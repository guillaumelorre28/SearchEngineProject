Animal Collective <https://www.theguardian.com/music/animalcollective>, 
Micachu and the Shapes and Wilco's Glenn Kotche are among those who will cover 
and remix Congolese acts like Konono No 1 for a new double album. The 
compilation from Crammed Discs' Congotronics series sees a variety of foreign 
artists revisiting tracks discovered in the clubs of Kinshasa.

The anthology is called Tradi-Mods Vs Rockers: Alternative Takes on 
Congotronics. A variety of singers, DJs and indie bands take on songs from 
Crammed's first three Congotronics albums, primarily the hypnotic, noisy dance 
music of Konono No 1 and Kasai Allstars. Contributors also include Deerhoof, 
Andrew Bird, dubstep producer Shackleton, Juana Molina, Glasgow DJs Optimo, and 
Boredoms' Eye. AlthoughBj√∂rk <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bjork> worked 
with Konono No 1 on her Volta album, she is conspicuously absent.

Congotronics, first launched in 2004, marked an important change in the 
marketing of contemporary "world" music. Unlike the polished folk, blues and 
Afropop of the preceding decade, Konono No 1 and Kasai Allstars were celebrated 
for their messy, often distorted electric dance music. Crammed, a Belgian 
label, found a new audience for Congolese artists among fans of krautrock, 
dance-punk and experimental pop. The most recent release in the series was a 
vinyl set comprising five earlier albums and a collaboration between Kasai 
Allstars and US alt-folk group Akron/Family.
