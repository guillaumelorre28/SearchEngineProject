Exhibition of the week

Georg Baselitz
The brutal physical facts of ageing are among the themes of this exhibition by 
one of the masters of contemporary art. Baselitz reworks images of himself and 
his wife when they were younger and reinterprets the harsh realism of the 
German modernist Otto Dix. Yet more proof of Germany’s artistic preeminence.
• White Cube Bermondsey 
<http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/georg_baselitz_bermondsey_2016/>, London, 27 
April-3 July.

Also showing

Alberto Giacometti/Yves Klein
Two of the titans of postwar European art battle it out: neo-Etruscan 
sculpture versus martial arts mayhem. Will Giacometti’s profundity make the 
monochrome-painting black-belt Klein look lightweight? It may be a knockout.
• Gagosian Grosvenor Hill 
<http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/alberto-giacometti--yves-klein--april-27-2016>
, London, 27 April-11 June.

Keith Coventry
The utopian dreams of modern art are ironised in Coventry’s new paintings, 
which reveal Russian constructivist patterns apparently hidden in the McDonalds 
arches.
• Pace <http://www.pacegallery.com/london>, London, 27 April–28 May.

Wright of Derby and the Lure of Italy
Two newly restored Wright paintings go on view this week in an exhibition that 
explores the impact of Italy’s light and landscapes on his vision of the 
sublime.
• Derby Museum and Art Gallery, 
<http://www.derbymuseums.org/events/lureofitaly/#.Vxn0utR4WrV> until 12 June.


John Piper
The modernist fabric designs of an artist better known for his neo-Romantic 
paintings of war and ruins.
• Pallant House Gallery <http://www.pallant.org.uk>, Chichester, until 12 June.

 Albrecht Dürer’s St Jerome (about 1496) Photograph: Heritage Images / 
Getty/National Gallery 
In this brilliant little picture, Dürer portrays not only Jerome but also his 
lion with characterful authority. Yet it is the glowing sky that is captivating 
in its menacing beauty – and when you look on the reverse of this wooden panel 
it becomes even more portentous, for here Dürer has painted a comet hurtling 
through the night sky: a sign, surely, of the apocalypse.
