Tomboy is the fourth album from Panda Bear, aka Animal Collective's Noah 
Lennox. In a departure from his trademark sound, Lennox swaps sample-heavy 
methods for a White Stripes inspired "guitar and rhythm" approach â€“ which is 
unlikely to alienate many fans. The reverb-drenched sound remains, however, 
creating a psychedelic backdrop for Lennox's pretty, repetitive melodies and 
provides a fitting follow-up to 2007's Person Pitch or Animal Collective's 
Merriweather Post Pavilion. Let us know if you agree in the comments section
