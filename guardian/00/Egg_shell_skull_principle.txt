Egg-shell skull principle says a defendant must take his victim as he finds 
him. So if a person negligently injures someone by running them over, for 
example, they cannot complain if the injuries they have caused turn out to be 
more serious than expected because the victim suffered from a pre-existing 
weakness such as an unusually thin skull or a weak heart.
