Pillows and Prayers, Cherry Red's compilation of cult indie bands and 
obscurities, topped the indie charts for a whole 19 weeks, shifting 120,000 
copies in the process. The key to this unlikely feat was the price: a mere 99p 
to tempt the curious into sampling its 17 acts. Many have been forgotten, but 
the album contains an early gem from Everything But the Girl, and pioneered the 
indie folk sound that stillÂ proliferates.
