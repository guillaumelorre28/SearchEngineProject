A Munich court has ordered the owner of a beer hall where Adolf Hitler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/adolf-hitler> is thought to have made his 
first political speech to allow the anti-immigrant party Alternative for 
Germany (AfD) to hold an event there.

The AfD, whose events often attract protests, had reserved the Hofbräukeller 
in the Bavarian city for Friday, where its supporters will hear a speech by the 
party leader, Frauke Petry.

But fearing anti-AfD demonstrations outside the venue, the hall’s owner, 
Rickey Steinberg, cancelled the event.

The district court said it had ordered Steinberg to honour the contract signed 
with the AfD and allow the event to go ahead.

“I am obviously very sad that the judge doesn’t see our security concerns,” 
Steinberg was quoted as saying by German media. He will not appeal against the 
decision.

This month police in Stuttgart detained about 500 leftwing protesters who 
tried to break up the AfD’s first full conference, where party members backed 
an election manifesto that says Islam is not compatible with the constitution.

The arrival of the more than a million migrants in Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> last year has fuelled the rise of 
the AfD, which entered three state parliaments in elections in March.

The party, which is represented in the assemblies of half of the country’s 16 
states, wants to ban minarets and the burqa.
