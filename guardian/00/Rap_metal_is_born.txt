Ever wondered why Limp Bizkit exist? Blame the day that Walk This Way, a 
collaborative cover version of a 1975Aerosmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aerosmith> single by Run-DMC and Aerosmith's 
Steve Tyler and Joe Perry, was released. The resultant collision of hip-hop and 
guitar rock (which became the first rap single to reach the Billboard top five, 
remarkably enough) spawned its own genre – rap-metal.

If ever there was a dream genre for a white teenage male audience, this was 
it. Though early days saw creditable forays byRage Against the Machine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/rage-against-the-machine>, and hook-ups 
between major acts such as Anthrax and Public Enemy, who toured together to the 
bemusement of many, rap-metal soon became a more base fusion, fuelled by 
aggression, baggy shorts and testosterone.

Predominantly performed by white male American bands, it harvested rap's 
belligerence, turning it into a blunt instrument that worked in tandem with 
bludgeoning guitar riffs. Devoid of the verbal fluidity of the best hip-hop, it 
was abrasive and polarising. Its popularity waned, but be warned: some predict 
a revival, sparked by a new generation of bored 13-year-old boys, is nigh.
