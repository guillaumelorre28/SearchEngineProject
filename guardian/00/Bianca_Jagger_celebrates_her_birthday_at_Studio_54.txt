Studio 54 was party central for New York's elite in the late 70s and early 
80s. In the years since, its reputation for disco excess has grown to mythic 
proportions: the superclub by which allÂ others must be measured. Rooms were 
knee-deep in glitter, uptown chic and downtown hustle, the walls filled with 
stashes of cocaine. The most notorious tale (a naked Bianca Jagger riding in on 
a white horse) isn't true (although she did briefly sit on a horse in a red 
dress). Who knows how the horse got past the doorman?
