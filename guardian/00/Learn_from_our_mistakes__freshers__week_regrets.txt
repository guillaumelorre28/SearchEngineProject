Every new university student has their own way of coping with the awkwardness 
of being plunged into an unfamiliar environment with the chance to re-invent 
themselves.

Some throw themselves hell for leather into the social scene, going to every 
back-to-school themed club night and into the beds of everyone on their 
corridor.

Others stand on the sidelines, waiting for all the clumsy mingling and false 
friendliness to be over, craving home comforts and a reassuring hug from mum 
and dad. Most students fall somewhere in between.

The early days of university can be a time for establishing the relationships 
and habits that last throughout your degree. And many students will emerge at 
the other side of graduation wishing they’d behaved differently.

Here’s what 10 notable ex-students would do if they could live their freshers’ 
week all over again.

‘I wish I’d tried out more new things’
 Gus Unger-Hamilton 
Gus Unger-Hamilton, singer and keyboard player for Alt-J 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/alt-j>, studied English at the University of 
Leeds. He says:

“One regret is that I didn’t throw myself into more societies and activities. 
During freshers’ week I didn’t sign up to anything, thinking ‘There’s plenty of 
time to get involved in this later in the year’. Then suddenly it was 
Christmas, then exams and first year was over. I wish I’d tried out more new 
things when I was in an environment where there are so many opportunities. I’d 
advise freshers to try anything they think might interest them, as you’ll never 
again have as much time or energy.”

‘I was quite shy at the beginning’

<http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Glam-Guide-Fleur-Force/dp/1472228405>, studied 
geography at the London School of Economics (LSE). She says:

“I definitely approached freshers’ week in the wrong way. I was quite shy at 
the beginning and didn’t make the effort to join any clubs or societies, which 
was a big mistake as it’s definitely harder to get involved later in the 
academic year. Societies are one of the best ways to meet people with similar 
interests at uni, so throw yourself in to the freshers’ fair and don’t be shy!”

 Jamie Adenuga, JME 
Jamie Adenuga (aka JME), MC and co-founder of grime group and record label Boy 
Better Know <http://boybetterknow.com/>, studied 3D digital design at the 
University of Greenwich. He says:

“I don’t regret anything if I’m totally honest. I knew I was capable of 
anything I gave 100% to. At the beginning of my first year, I slacked a bit, 
which was partly my fault, but mainly due to problems I was having outside of 
university. In the end, I thought, instead of using the problems as a reason to 
put in less work, I decided to challenge myself and see what I can get done, 
even in the worst circumstances possible. So I would say, challenge yourself. 
Because no matter what results you get in the end, you will always regret not 
knowing what you could have achieved.”

 and‘Asking For It’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/02/rape-culture-teen-book-louise-oneill>
, studied English literature at Trinity College Dublin. She says:

“When I left my very small home town in west Cork to attend university in 
Dublin, I felt overwhelmed. The city seemed enormous and I was intimidated by 
the other people on my course. I was so sure they were all far more intelligent 
than I was that I was too afraid to voice an opinion in tutorials, and, after a 
while, I simply stopped attended my lectures. I regret not taking full 
advantage of the amazing opportunity that I had been given. I was attending the 
best university in Ireland, and all I had to do was read books.

“So, if you’re starting university, don’t be afraid to ask questions and speak 
up. Attend some of your lectures at least, and remember that you’re not 
supposed to have all the answers. This is the time to figure out who you are 
and what you want from life. Be kind to yourself. And avoid tequila.”

 Phil Wang 
Phil Wang, comedian <http://www.philwang.co.uk>, studied engineering at King’s 
College, University of Cambridge. He says:

“Do not stay with your boyfriend or girlfriend from home. You will not ‘make 
it work’. ‘Staying in touch’ will become a chore, and ‘Skype sex’ just isn’t a 
thing. Did I have a high-school sweetheart? Sure I did. Did we keep the 
relationship going across two universities at opposite ends of the country? Of 
course we did. Do I regret that decision? Every moment of my pathetic life!

“University is a chance for a completely new start. One of only three such 
opportunities one gets in life: birth, higher education, and a hurried 
relocation to Nicaragua with a Swiss passport and a new plastic face after 
getting in deep with the Watford mob. So don’t waste it by holding on to the 
past.”

“Do sign up to your local doctor’s surgery as soon as possible so you don’t 
end up having fresher’s flu for the first term of your university life. Been 
there, done that – I had to miss out on some cracking nights out while I was 
downing Berocca. It’s not the sexiest regret, but it’s a practical one. Some 
other more generic tips: take a tonne of photos, Iceland is great for cheap 
booze, and buy a white flat sheet. You’ll be amazed by how many fancy dress 
costumes can be fashioned out of it.”

, studied biochemistry followed by a master’s in management at Lancaster 
University. He says:

“I had an absolutely wonderful time at university, but I have three regrets. 
First, I didn’t take advantage of societies. Don’t restrict yourself to things 
you already know. The worst that will happen is you’ll meet new people and make 
a fool of yourself.

“Second, ‘lad bants’ – don’t be a prick, especially not a sexist one. It’s 
easy to get carried away and trample all over people, but no one else thinks 
you’re remotely witty. And remember; chants belong at a fucking football game, 
not in a nightclub queue.


“Third, be braver – stand up for yourself and others, go on protests, raise 
money for charity, say no when you need to study and most importantly tell the 
person you fancy that you fancy them before your dick of a mate steps in! Have 
fun. They’re the best years of your life, don’t waste them being a square, but 
also don’t end up dead in a ditch covered in your own vomit.”

‘I treated my interest-free overdraft as free money’
 Wes Streeting 
Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, studied history at Selwyn College, 
University of Cambridge. He says:

“The biggest mistake I made in freshers’ week was treating my interest-free 
overdraft as free money. At some point you need to pay it back! My biggest 
piece of advice to new students is to make the most of uni life outside of 
academic study. I got so much out of getting involved in campaigns, running 
events and writing for the student newspaper. Relish every minute of it.”

“I regret not making more of an effort with people. Find your people. Don’t 
wait for friends to find you. I was painfully shy, but that can come across as 
coldness. So bite the bullet and strike up conversations with randoms.

“Go dancing all night, discover charity shops and wear things you could never 
wear to a ‘workplace’. Have intense stupid debates until five in the morning 
about things that make you feel very passionate, but you actually know very 
little about. But mainly get as much experience doing what intrigues you as 
possible – it will help you work out what you want to do when you leave. I 
learned how to write, which has given me a job I love and opened up a whole 
world of opportunities.”

friends and family at home aren’t going anywhere but you only get one freshers’ 
week!”
