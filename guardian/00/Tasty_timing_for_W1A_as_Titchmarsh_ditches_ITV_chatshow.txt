. Olympics satire Twenty Twelve did it when the real Olympic clock ground to a 
halt just hours after the BBC comedy featured a defective one. Now W1A, which 
seesHugh Bonneville's character Ian Fletcher join the BBC as its head of

In W1A, which starts on Wednesday night, one of the first issues Ian faces is 
the availability of, you guessed it, Alan Titchmarsh for a new show called 
Britain's Tastiest Village. To paraphrase Ian's catchphrase, so that's all good
