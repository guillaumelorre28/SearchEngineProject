What's the story?

Skincare, cosmetics and fragrance brand Elizabeth Arden is one of the oldest 
around. Starting in New York in 1910 with a salon on New York's Fifth Avenue, 
Miss Elizabeth Arden grew her company at an impressive rate and became one of 
the wealthiest women in the world. Now, over 100 years after its conception, 
Elizabeth Arden products are sold in more than a hundred countries and, at the 
last count, the company was estimated to be worth $1.3bn.

Since 1910? They must have been through a fair bit?

Quite. In 1912, Arden participated in the suffrage movement and played her 
part by supplying red lipstick to the suffragettes. The striking shade became 
part of standard rally uniform and something of a symbol of female 
emancipation. Later, the brand not only survived the depression but actually 
blossomed. In the 1930s, the company employed more than a thousand people and 
grossed more than $4m a year.

Any other interesting facts for me?

Elizabeth Arden boasts of being the first for many big beauty ideas – the 
first to introduce eye makeup to the women of America (1914); the first to make 
travel-size products (1917); the first to offer makeovers in store; the first 
to offer travelling demonstrations … the list goes on.

So what's good?
 Miss Elizabeth Arden in the 1930s 
Mention Elizabeth Arden to anyone and often the response will include a 
reference to the Eight Hour Cream Skin Protectant (£25 for 50ml,Guardian

<http://www.guardianfashionstore.co.uk/search.php?keywords=elizabeth+arden+eight+hour+cream+skin+protectant&Submit=Search>
). Created in 1930, it is still by far the brand's bestseller, with a tube of 
the stuff selling somewhere in the world every 30 seconds. The original is an 
all-purpose beauty balm that aims to solve pretty much any skin-based problem – 
chapped lips, dry hands, rough heels etc. It now also comes in various guises 
to target specific areas – a hand treatment; a body treatment; and a lip 
treatment. The diversification may not be entirely necessary given that the 
original is a multitasking product but the lip protectant with a little tint of 
colour (£15.95,Guardian Fashion Store

) is a real treat for the lips.
