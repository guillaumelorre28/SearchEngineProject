After three weeks, mounting controversy and the loss of a $3m sponsorship deal,
Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> has finally apologised for the 
now-infamous underage-girl, dry-humping incident.

In a statement released to Associated Press, the R&B singer responded to being 
caught on film dancing in an aggressively sexual manner with a 14-year-old girl 
live on stage in Trinidad on April 12.

Akon said: "I want to sincerely apologize for the embarrassment and any pain 
I've caused to the young woman who joined me on stage, her family and the 
Trinidad community for the events at my concert. It was never my intention to 
embarrass or take advantage of my fans in any way, especially those under the 
age of 18. That is why we tried to make sure that the club did not admit anyone 
under 18 in the audience. Somehow, that standard was not met."

The fallout from the incident include US phone company Verizon Wireless 
pulling a $3m sponsorship deal for Gwen Stefani's The Sweet Escape tour, for 
which Akon is scheduled to be the support act.
