Lily danced in the leaves while I spoke to a hippy from Turkey. He spoke of 
peace because he’d seen war. He talked about love because he knew hate; 
hate for those above him, hate for those he had served with, hate for enemies 
not born his but who became so, and lastly, hate for himself because of how his 
mind had been controlled.

He talked about life and living because he had seen death, and been the cause 
of it. He had long hair because the army had forced him to shave his head. Now 
he had a beard. I liked my new bearded friend; his life until then had not been 
of his own making, but he was taking it back.

I felt fuzzy and wonderful as the grey, abrasive side of life wobbled away to 
rainbow jelly as the acid kicked in. And then Lily was standing in front of me. 
The look on her face was out of the ordinary and I knew instinctively that 
something serious had happened. Lily looked vulnerable. I had never seen her 
look vulnerable.

“A man on the dancefloor grabbed me. I’ve been sexually assaulted.”

It was raining on her face but the sky was dry.

“Do something!”

This was my John Wayne moment, only I wasn’t a cowboy, a fighter or anything 
like John Wayne

My mind raced through a hundred thoughts in half a second. What are you going 
to do? You can’t fight. What if he knows any kind of fighting? You have to do 
something or your girlfriend is going to think you less of a man, but you also 
don’t want to get killed. You are on acid, you idiot. What are you going to do? 
Hug this guy to death? Talk philosophical nonsense about the nature of violence?

I took Lily’s hand and we walked to the dancefloor and then up to the bar in 
search of the guy. I had no idea what I was going to do. This was my John Wayne 
moment, only I wasn’t a cowboy, a fighter or anything like John Wayne. I felt 
better by assuring myself that I had been beaten up before, and from what 
I remembered, it wasn’t that bad.

The bar was busy with chatter, but there was a clear and unobstructed 
view from where Lily and I stood all the way to the bench where she pointed out 
the man in question, who sat laughing with four friends. Five thugs in total. 
Splendid.

These guys were not dressed for a New Year’s Eve travellers’ rave in a jungle. 
They leered across the bar throwing judgmental daggers at the laughter and 
sparkles. They were trying to act like they needed to be perceived, so they 
stood out in a jungle full of hippies whose basic philosophy is to be yourself.

The guy who “grabbed” Lily was bald, and violent around the eyes. He was thick 
with muscle, and so were his friends.

I walked toward the men. They stared back. The man who had touched Lily 
pointed at me and laughed. He beckoned me to keep walking. He was enjoying the 
moment. I stopped. They stood. We waited. This was now a scene like in some 
action film, without the guns or hero. I needed to think of something fast, or 
I was walking towards a beating.

I lifted my hand above my head, and shouted at the top of my voice: “I have 
something I need to say to everyone here and it’s very important!”

A crowd of over 300 people at various states of enlightenment stopped what 
they were doing and looked at me. I walked up to the man sitting with his group 
of friends and pointed at him and said: “This man does not belong here. He is 
not part of the party. This man has just sexually assaulted my girlfriend on 
the dancefloor. He is not one of us. He is negative energy. If you see him, be 
on guard!”

The guys stopped laughing and looked to the floor. They hid their faces. They 
stormed toward me. I was going to get hit in the face.

The crowd, remarkably, jeered. The men stopped, now surrounded by many, unsure 
what to do. The fight was no longer five on one: this was five against hundreds.

The few party people who hadn’t noticed the commotion now watched. A girl 
moved forward and yelled at the men to go. Another stepped forward and booed. 
Then everyone booed. The men stared at the crowd, then back at me with wild 
eyes.

An angry mob had developed, of hippies yielding glow sticks. The circle 
parted, the men ran out of the circle, down the path, away from the bar and 
into the jungle. The man who had touched Lily stumbled as he ran, and as he hit 
the floor the crowd cheered.

I had used peace to beat the thugs around the head. This New Year’s Eve taught 
me that if we just gather the strength to ask for help, the good are powerful, 
and fear does not have to be faced alone.
