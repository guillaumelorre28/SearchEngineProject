I’m envious of your relationship with your family, your certainty that they 
will always be there. It doesn’t matter how often you argue. It doesn’t matter 
if you see them once a week or once a year. They will be in your life for as 
long as you want them. And you know that.

I hate the smugness of family. The mindless celebrations. The unquestioned 
loyalty of shared blood, belonging to a tribe. I hate the Facebook posts. From 
the moment my adopted mother told me my “real mummy” had not been able to keep 
me, family ceased to be a certainty. I looked different from my adopted 
parents. I did not share their talents or traits. I felt like an outsider.

I’m envious that you can be yourself and your family will accept you. I worked 
so hard at family, striving to be who I thought they wanted, with no guarantee 
of success. The more I struggled, the less secure I felt. I sensed their 
disappointment. Our bond is contractual, not absolute.

I hate seeing you take your family for granted. Having the confidence of 
knowing unconditional love. Of not fearing it will disappear if you do not take 
care of it. I grew up knowing however much my mother loved me, she still felt 
able to abandon me.

Being restored to your blood family is every adoptee’s great romance, but 
after the fairytale of finding mine, growing closer was a painful process. They 
told me my mother had never been the same after she gave me up, and it felt 
like an accusation. They never forgave me for escaping the pain I’d caused.

You remind me of what I am missing and what I will never have. No blood ties 
me to this world at all.
