“I don’t want to get my hopes up,” the singer Adele 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele> said in 2015 – just ahead of the 
release of her latest album, 25. “You can’t make assumptions. This new one 
could sell 100,000.”

She need not have worried. Her third studio album has outsold any other in the 
UK for the second year running, it was announced on Friday.

More than 13 months after its release, 25 has passed the 3 million sales mark 
in Britain, giving it a place on theOfficial Charts Company 
<http://www.officialcharts.com/who-we-are/the-official-charts/>’s 30 
bestselling UK albums of all time. The album has also sold more than 10 million 
copies in the US.

Coldplay <https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay>’s A Head Full of Dreams, 
which was also released last year, was the year’s second bestseller. The 
group’s seventh LP reached number one in February – achieving the same lofty 
chart heights as its six predecessors, which date back to Parachutes in 2000.
