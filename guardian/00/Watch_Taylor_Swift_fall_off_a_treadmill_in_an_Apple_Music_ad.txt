Apple Music: ‘Taylor vs Treadmill’ (starts at 00:04) - US

With 10m views on YouTube in its first four days, this is surely set to become 
one of the most-watched commercials of the internet era. Taylor Swift – as the 
culturally attuned among you may recall – had a bit of a beef with Apple about 
its streaming service a little while ago. Unlike the FBI, when Taylor Swift 
took on Apple, she won. And now that they’ve kissed and made up, she’s even 
appearing in adverts for the very service they rowed about.

 LG: ‘Jason Stathams’ (starts at 01:08) - US

Jason Statham stretches his acting ability to the limit in this light-hearted 
film for LG which has multiple versions of the action hero occupying an entire 
town.

Soda Stream: ‘Heavy Bubbles’ (starts at 02:12) - Israel

Soda Stream enlist some serious advertising muscle in their latest bid to 
promote their eco-friendly approach through a viral satire launched on April 
Fool’s Day. Their burly ambassador is Hafthór Júlíus ‘Thor’ Björnsson, 
professional strongman and occasional Game of Thrones colossus. However, the 
straight-talking Björnsson takes a break from filming to promote a different 
product – Heavy Bubbles, bottled water in bulk.

Hornbach: ‘You’re Alive’ (starts at 03:54) - Germany

This lovely advert for German DIY retailer Hornbach depicts a middle-aged man 
steeling himself for a spot of gardening. Then we see the same fellow - naked 
and poised at the top of a hill. We fear the worst as he plunges forward but we 
needn’t worry, it’s only a metaphor.
