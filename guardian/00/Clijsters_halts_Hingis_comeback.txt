Kim Clijsters <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kim-clijsters> reclaimed the 
world No1 spot - and ended a fairytale comeback - with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win over 
Martina Hingis.

The pair were forced to wait to get on court as the quarter-final between 
Sebastien Grosjean and Nicolas Kiefer stretched to the five-hour mark, but it 
didn't seem to sway Clijsters' form as she took the first set.

But Hingis, playing in her first major tournament since retiring from the game 
three years ago, fought back to claim the second set with relative ease. The 
third set proved a dream too far, however, as Clijsters found her rhythm - and 
found winners all over the court. She led 3-1 before a Hingis fightback 
levelled them at 3-3, but the Swiss couldn't hold her serve to allow the second 
seed that vital break.

Clijsters will now face Amelie Mauresmo. Mauresmo breezed into the semi-finals 
with a convincing 6-3, 6-0 victory over Patty Schnyder.

Mauresmo was operating at her sublime best throughout the contest and appeared 
a cut above her opponent as she wrapped things up inside an hour.

For Schnyder it was a far from clinical performance as the usually composed 
Swiss hit a spate of unforced errors to gift the result to Mauresmo.

Mauresmo began the first set in the best possible fashion with an easy break 
of Schnyder's serve. And she soon consolidated on the important break, racing 
to a 3-1 lead.

Schnyder then capitalised on a rare series of errors by the Frenchwoman to 
break back to even the contest, but her jubilation was short-lived as Mauresmo 
piled on two further service breaks to claim the opening set.

The second set soon shaped into another trouncing - Mauresmo stormed to an 
early 3-0 lead after another break of her opponent's faltering service game.

Mauresmo put her foot on the accelerator, conceding just four points on her 
serve for the second set, which lasted just 24 minutes.
