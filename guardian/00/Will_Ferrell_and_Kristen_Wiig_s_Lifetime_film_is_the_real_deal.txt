The news of a secret film starring Will Ferrell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell> and Kristen Wiig, made for the 
Lifetime TV network, leaked in April and was followed by an almost immediate 
confirmation that it had been scrapped. But, according to a tweet from the 
Hollywood Reporter’s Rebecca Ford, an LA billboard has revealed that the film 
will be airing later this month.

The film A Deadly Adoption was made by Ferrell and Wiig in private, as a 
knowing take on the traditional Lifetime movie, typified by low budgets, 
melodramatic plots and overwrought acting. It’s part of the network’s 25th 
anniversary of making original movies, with names such as Hostile Makeover, 
Blindfold: Acts of Obsession and Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy.

The plot of Ferrell and Wiig’s campy thriller sees a couple who house a 
pregnant woman in the hopes of adopting her child. It also stars Jessica 
Lowndes, from Beverly Hills 90210.

Ferrell and Wiig have previously co-starred in Anchorman 2 and The Spoils of 
Babylon, itself a spoof of a 1980s miniseries. Ferrell has also produced 
Welcome to Me, a comedy drama starring Wiig as a woman who wins the lottery.

A Deadly Adoption will air on 20 June in the US, with no UK date planned.
