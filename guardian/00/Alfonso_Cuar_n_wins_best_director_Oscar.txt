Alfonso Cuarón <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron> has won the 
best director Oscar for Gravity at the 86th Academy Awards, defeating a field 
that included 12 Years a Slave's Steve McQueen, Nebraska's Alexander Payne and 
Martin Scorsese for The Wolf of Wall Street. In doing so, Cuarón becomes the 
first Mexican-born director to win the award.

With a back catalogue including Mexican road movie Y Tu Mama Tambien, 
dystopian near-future parable Children of Men and Harry Potter and the Prisoner 
of Azkaban, Cuarón has been nominated for Oscars before, but not in this 
category. Gravity, the space-walk thriller starringSandra Bullock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sandra-bullock> as a scientist stranded in 
Earth's orbit after her craft is crippled by debris, has proved a huge 
box-office hit, as well as a showcase for cutting-edge visual effects. It has 
already won Cuarón major best director awards at the Golden Globes and Baftas, 
and won the Bafta for best British film.

The Academy Awards are taking place at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles, and 
are being hosted by Ellen DeGeneres.
