This latest version will be directed by Shane Black, currently riding high 
after the success of Iron Man 3 and The Nice Guys. Black also had a small role 
in the first Predator film, as part of Schwarzenegger’s special forces crew 
(and the first one to be killed by the alien).

No plot details have yet emerged, but Schwarzenegger criticised the franchise 
in a Reddit interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/arnold-schwarzenegger-slams-screwed-up-predator-sequels-online-forum>
, saying the films following his original hit were “not satisfactory”.
