Summary

 * Britain will join the coalition of nations conducting airstrikes against 
Islamic State militants in Syria after MPs in the House of Commons voted to 
authorise the UK’s participation. MPs voted 397 to 223 in favour of sending RAF 
Tornados into the skies over Syria, after an all-day debate in parliament.

 AsPatrick Wintour reports, 66 Labour MPs backed the government in defiance of 
the party leader,Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>. In a day of soul 
searching, recrimination and often heartfelt speeches, it became clear David 
Cameron was guaranteed a clear overall majority.Corbyn, who was forced by 
divisions in his party to give his MPs a free vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/30/syria-airstrikes-jeremy-corbyn-gives-labour-mps-free-vote>
, will be pleased that a majority of his MPs and nearly half the shadow cabinet 
opposed strikes. But his foreign affairs spokesman,Hilary Benn, prompted rare 
applause when he gave an impassioned speech, regarded as the best of the 
debate, in favour of strikes. “We are here faced by fascists. Not just their 
calculated brutality, but their belief that they are superior to every single 
one of us in this chamber tonight and all of the people we represent. They hold 
us in contempt,” he said.

The Stop the War Coalition has put out a statement about the result of the 
vote. 
<http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/news/stop-the-war-statement-on-uk-parliament-s-decision-to-bomb-syria>
 Here’s an extract.

We are pleased that a large majority of Labour MPs voted with their leader, 
Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>, to oppose 
this Tory war. However, we feel the speeches and votes of pro-war Labour MPs 
shows how little they understand the lessons of Iraq and other previous wars. 
Like the Bourbons they have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. None of the 
wars launched by the UK and US from Afghanistan in 2001, through Iraq in 2003 
to Libya in 2011, has yet ended. Millions still suffer from those decisions - 
today’s vote will add millions more.

Hammond suggests air strikes could go on for more than a year

On Newsnight Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, warnsthat airstrikes 
against Isis could go on for quite some time. Asked if they could last as long 
as four years, he replies:

I hope it won’t be four years, but I caution that it isn’t going to be months.

Our reporter Ben Quinn sends this from the protest in Parliament Square:

The anti-war protest outside Westminster included members of Momentum, the 
movement set up in the wake Jeremy Corbyn’sLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership victory, who carried a 
large red banner.

Max Schnieder, a Momentum organiser, rejected the suggestion that the movement 
would be mobilised against MPs who voted for airstrikes.

We have made it absolutely clear that we are not campaigning on deselection. 
Of course, we think that people who are voting on bombing are wrong and we are 
disappointed in each person that we were unable to win the argument with them.

We have been encouraging our supporters and others who are opposed to bombing 
to write to their MPs and tell them thatDavid Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has not made the case for 
war and so we are here in solidarity with the other protestors.

Danny Hackett, a Labour party councillor from Bexley, had words with a couple 
of protestrrs as a policeman looked on, describing Momentum as “scum”.

“Momentum are not here to campaign for the Labour party. They are here to push 
their own agenda. I you compare them to Progress, who I am a member of, they 
are out there fighting for the Labour party,” he said.

Hackett, who walked over to the protest in the company of two friends, 
including a former Conservative councillor, added: “At this moment in time, I 
have more in common with theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> than with Momentum and 
that is a great shame.”

Belinda Chapman, who was carrying a Stop the War placard, remonstrated with 
Bexley when she heard him criticising Momentum. “I have been a member of the 
Labour party for many years, although I left during the Blair era. I was 
sitting here and couldn’t believe it when a Labour party councillor came over 
to say that he wanted to bombSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>. 
We want them out of our party. We want Eagle out, Benn out..all of them.”

She agreed with Bexley on one point : it felt as if they were in two different 
parties.

The pilots and other aircrew at the home of the Tornados, RAF Marham in 
Norfolk, have been working to get two more jets ready to fly out to reinforce 
UK planes already in action as quickly as possible after the Commons vote.

They will bring the total number of Tornados up to 10, allowing the RAF to 
increase sorties from two a day.

Captain Richard Davies, a Tornado pilot and station commander, said: “We have 
aircraft at a readiness state so they are prepared and ready to deploy.”

How soon could the RAF be in action over Syria ? “If a vote yes, if Tornados 
flying at that time and if there is a target inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, UK bombing could happen overnight … 
If all those ducks are aligned and the aircraft are airborne at that moment and 
a target comes up they will go. It depends where they are. If we are airborne 
in Iraq and the vote is yes we could be targeting on that mission,” Davies said.

Engineers and ground crew were working on the two jets while the air crew 
underwent last-minute training in the air and with simulators.

Some of the staff have already flown missions over Iraq and see little 
difference in expanding into Syria other than relishing the prospect of the 
freedom of being able to continue pursuit ofIslamic State 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> on the other side of the border.

In pooled copy from the base, one of the weapons crew, whose has to remain 
anonymous, was asked by a reporter what it felt like when he knew he was going 
to fire a weapon.

“Blood pressure goes up, heart rate increases. You hear breathing rates 
increase and you know the next event will be potentially the weapon coming off 
the aircraft. Once you get over that initial ‘right this is it’. then ….it is 
part of the routine.”

For some weapons, it is just a matter of of sending them to a GPS coordinate. 
But the Brimstone missile, touted by prime ministerDavid Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> as a precision weapon that 
reduces the chance of civilian casualties, the weapons operator said that if 
“you have fired something like Brimstone then you can have another peak in your 
blood pressure and your breathing and your heart rate (goes up) especially as a 
back seater (weapons systems operator) because I am now guiding that weapon 
into the target.”

One of the pilots, also anonymous, added: “The weapon is very precise. You can 
deploy it extremely accurately. It has got a small warhead, which means there 
is a limited effect. Hopefully you will only have the effect that you want on 
the target. You can employ in an urban area and have the desired effect that 
you want on the target and people standing only a number of yards away from it 
will hear a bang but can expect to be unaffected by that warhead going off.”

Hilary Benn's speech - Analysis and all the key extracts

Andrew Sparrow

Today’s debate will be remembered for Hilary Benn’s extraordinary wind-up 
speech, in which he powerfully (but politely) challenged his own leader and 
asserted Labour’s claim to the party of activist, hard-edged internationalism. 
The Nato tradition in the party has always been much more dominant than the 
pacifist tradition and Benn reached back into history, and to Labour’s role in 
the creation of the United Nations after the second world war, to justify 
supporting airstrikes. It is very, very rare for MPs to applaud in the Commons 
but they applauded Benn because they recognised that this was something special 
(just as they applauded Robin Cook when he spoke against the Iraq war in 2003). 
Even before today people were speculating about Benn as an alternative party 
leader; after tonight that chatter will only grow louder.

Here are key extracts from the speech.

Introduction

Although my right honourable friend the leader of the opposition and I will 
walk into different division lobbies tonight. I am proud to speak from the same 
dispatch box as him. My right honourable friend is not a terrorist sympathizer. 
He is an honest, a principled, a decent and a good man and I think the prime 
minister must now regret what he said yesterday and his failure to do what he 
should have done today which is to say sorry...

 The question which confronts us in a very, very complex conflict is – at its 
heart – very simple. What we do with others to confront this threat to our 
citizens, our nation, other nations and the people who suffer under the cruel 
yoke of Daesh. The carnage in Paris brought home to us the clear and present 
danger we face from them. It could just as easily have been London or Glasgow 
or Leeds or Birmingham and it could still be...

The threat of Isil

It was a Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> government that 
helped to found the United Nations at the end of the second world war and why 
did we do so? Because we wanted the nations of the world to work together to 
deal with threats to international peace and security. And Daesh is 
unquestionably that …

 Now Mr Speaker, no one in this debate doubts the deadly serious threat we 
face from Daesh and what they do, although sometimes we find it hard to live 
from the reality.

We know that in June, four gay men were thrown off the fifth story of a 
building [in a Syrian city]. We know that in August the 82-year-old guardian of 
the antiquities of Palmyra, Professor Khaled al-Asaad, was beheaded and his 
beheaded body was hung from a traffic light. And we know that in recent weeks 
there has been the discovery of mass graves in Sinjar, one containing the 
bodies of older Yazidi women murdered by Daesh because they were judged too old 
to be sold for sex.

We know they have killed 30 British tourists in Tunisia. 224 Russian 
holidaymakers on a plane. 178 people in suicide bombings in Beirut, Ankara and 
Surat. 130 people in Paris, including those young people in the Bataclan, whom 
Daesh in trying to justify their slaughter called them apostates engaged in 
prostitution and vice. If it had happened here, they could have been our 
children and we know that they are plotting more attacks.

Standing with the French

 So the question is this, given that we know what they are doing, can we 
really stand aside and refuse to act fully in our self defence against those 
who are planning those attacks.can we really leave to others the responsibility 
for defending our national security when it is our responsibility and if they 
do we do not act what kind of message would that send about our solidarity with 
those countries that have suffered so much including Iraq and our ally France.

 Now France wants us to stand with them and President Hollande the leader of 
our sister socialist party has asked for our assistance and help...

To his Labour colleagues

Mr Speaker, I hope the House will bear with me if I direct my closing remarks 
to myLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> friends and 
colleagues on this side of the house. As a party, we have always been defined 
by our internationalism. We believe we have a responsibility, one to another. 
We never have and we never should walk by on the other side of the road.

And we are here faced by fascists. Not just their calculated brutality, but 
their belief that they are superior to every single one of us in this chamber 
tonight and all of the people we represent. They hold us in contempt. They hold 
our values in contempt. They hold our belief in tolerance and decency in 
contempt. They hold our democracy – the means by which we will make our 
decision tonight – in contempt.

And what we know about fascists is that they need to be defeated and it is 
why, as we have heard tonight, socialists and trade unionists were just one 
part of the international brigade in the 1930s to fight against Franco. It’s 
why this entire House stood up against Hitler and Mussolini. It’s why our party 
has always stood up against the denial of human rights and for justice and my 
view, Mr Speaker, is that we must now confront this evil. It is now time for us 
to do our bit inSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> and that is why 
I ask my colleagues to vote in favour of this motion tonight.

There have been rumours that Rosie Winterton, the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> chief whip, voted with the 
government. But she didn’t, the Mirror reports.
Jack Blanchard (@Jack_Blanchard_) 
Labour source: "As would be expected in such a situation as this, the Chief 
Whip abstained."

 * Britain will join the coalition of nations conducting airstrikes against 
Islamic State militants in Syria after MPs in the House of Commons voted to 
authorise the UK’s participation. MPs voted 397 to 223 in favour of sending RAF 
Tornados into the skies over Syria, after an all-day debate in parliament.

 AsPatrick Wintour reports, 66 Labour MPs backed the government in defiance of 
the party leader,Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>. In a day of soul 
searching, recrimination and often heartfelt speeches, it became clear David 
Cameron was guaranteed a clear overall majority.Corbyn, who was forced by 
divisions in his party to give his MPs a free vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/30/syria-airstrikes-jeremy-corbyn-gives-labour-mps-free-vote>
, will be pleased that a majority of his MPs and nearly half the shadow cabinet 
opposed strikes. But his foreign affairs spokesman,Hilary Benn, prompted rare 
applause when he gave an impassioned speech, regarded as the best of the 
debate, in favour of strikes. “We are here faced by fascists. Not just their 
calculated brutality, but their belief that they are superior to every single 
one of us in this chamber tonight and all of the people we represent. They hold 
us in contempt,” he said.

 How MPs voted on Syria airstrikes  
The Stop the War Coalition has put out a statement about the result of the 
vote. 
<http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/news/stop-the-war-statement-on-uk-parliament-s-decision-to-bomb-syria>
 Here’s an extract.

We are pleased that a large majority of Labour MPs voted with their leader, 
Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>, to oppose 
this Tory war. However, we feel the speeches and votes of pro-war Labour MPs 
shows how little they understand the lessons of Iraq and other previous wars. 
Like the Bourbons they have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. None of the 
wars launched by the UK and US from Afghanistan in 2001, through Iraq in 2003 
to Libya in 2011, has yet ended. Millions still suffer from those decisions - 
today’s vote will add millions more.
 
The list of Labour MPs who voted for air strikes is here, at 11.24pm.

as four years, he replies:

I hope it won’t be four years, but I caution that it isn’t going to be months.

The anti-war protest outside Westminster included members of Momentum, the 
movement set up in the wake Jeremy Corbyn’sLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership victory, who carried a 
large red banner.

Max Schnieder, a Momentum organiser, rejected the suggestion that the movement 
would be mobilised against MPs who voted for airstrikes.

We have made it absolutely clear that we are not campaigning on deselection. 
Of course, we think that people who are voting on bombing are wrong and we are 
disappointed in each person that we were unable to win the argument with them.

We have been encouraging our supporters and others who are opposed to bombing 
to write to their MPs and tell them thatDavid Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has not made the case for 
war and so we are here in solidarity with the other protestors.

Danny Hackett, a Labour party councillor from Bexley, had words with a couple 
of protestrrs as a policeman looked on, describing Momentum as “scum”.

“Momentum are not here to campaign for the Labour party. They are here to push 
their own agenda. I you compare them to Progress, who I am a member of, they 
are out there fighting for the Labour party,” he said.

Hackett, who walked over to the protest in the company of two friends, 
including a former Conservative councillor, added: “At this moment in time, I 
have more in common with theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> than with Momentum and 
that is a great shame.”

Belinda Chapman, who was carrying a Stop the War placard, remonstrated with 
Bexley when she heard him criticising Momentum. “I have been a member of the 
Labour party for many years, although I left during the Blair era. I was 
sitting here and couldn’t believe it when a Labour party councillor came over 
to say that he wanted to bombSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>. 
We want them out of our party. We want Eagle out, Benn out..all of them.”

She agreed with Bexley on one point : it felt as if they were in two different 
parties.

 
The pilots and other aircrew at the home of the Tornados, RAF Marham in 
Norfolk, have been working to get two more jets ready to fly out to reinforce 
UK planes already in action as quickly as possible after the Commons vote.

They will bring the total number of Tornados up to 10, allowing the RAF to 
increase sorties from two a day.

Captain Richard Davies, a Tornado pilot and station commander, said: “We have 
aircraft at a readiness state so they are prepared and ready to deploy.”

How soon could the RAF be in action over Syria ? “If a vote yes, if Tornados 
flying at that time and if there is a target inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, UK bombing could happen overnight … 
If all those ducks are aligned and the aircraft are airborne at that moment and 
a target comes up they will go. It depends where they are. If we are airborne 
in Iraq and the vote is yes we could be targeting on that mission,” Davies said.

Engineers and ground crew were working on the two jets while the air crew 
underwent last-minute training in the air and with simulators.

Some of the staff have already flown missions over Iraq and see little 
difference in expanding into Syria other than relishing the prospect of the 
freedom of being able to continue pursuit ofIslamic State 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> on the other side of the border.

In pooled copy from the base, one of the weapons crew, whose has to remain 
anonymous, was asked by a reporter what it felt like when he knew he was going 
to fire a weapon.

“Blood pressure goes up, heart rate increases. You hear breathing rates 
increase and you know the next event will be potentially the weapon coming off 
the aircraft. Once you get over that initial ‘right this is it’. then ….it is 
part of the routine.”

For some weapons, it is just a matter of of sending them to a GPS coordinate. 
But the Brimstone missile, touted by prime ministerDavid Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> as a precision weapon that 
reduces the chance of civilian casualties, the weapons operator said that if 
“you have fired something like Brimstone then you can have another peak in your 
blood pressure and your breathing and your heart rate (goes up) especially as a 
back seater (weapons systems operator) because I am now guiding that weapon 
into the target.”

One of the pilots, also anonymous, added: “The weapon is very precise. You can 
deploy it extremely accurately. It has got a small warhead, which means there 
is a limited effect. Hopefully you will only have the effect that you want on 
the target. You can employ in an urban area and have the desired effect that 
you want on the target and people standing only a number of yards away from it 
will hear a bang but can expect to be unaffected by that warhead going off.”

Today’s debate will be remembered for Hilary Benn’s extraordinary wind-up 
speech, in which he powerfully (but politely) challenged his own leader and 
asserted Labour’s claim to the party of activist, hard-edged internationalism. 
The Nato tradition in the party has always been much more dominant than the 
pacifist tradition and Benn reached back into history, and to Labour’s role in 
the creation of the United Nations after the second world war, to justify 
supporting airstrikes. It is very, very rare for MPs to applaud in the Commons 
but they applauded Benn because they recognised that this was something special 
(just as they applauded Robin Cook when he spoke against the Iraq war in 2003). 
Even before today people were speculating about Benn as an alternative party 
leader; after tonight that chatter will only grow louder.

Here are key extracts from the speech.

Introduction

Although my right honourable friend the leader of the opposition and I will 
walk into different division lobbies tonight. I am proud to speak from the same 
dispatch box as him. My right honourable friend is not a terrorist sympathizer. 
He is an honest, a principled, a decent and a good man and I think the prime 
minister must now regret what he said yesterday and his failure to do what he 
should have done today which is to say sorry...

 The question which confronts us in a very, very complex conflict is – at its 
heart – very simple. What we do with others to confront this threat to our 
citizens, our nation, other nations and the people who suffer under the cruel 
yoke of Daesh. The carnage in Paris brought home to us the clear and present 
danger we face from them. It could just as easily have been London or Glasgow 
or Leeds or Birmingham and it could still be...

The threat of Isil

It was a Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> government that 
helped to found the United Nations at the end of the second world war and why 
did we do so? Because we wanted the nations of the world to work together to 
deal with threats to international peace and security. And Daesh is 
unquestionably that …

 Now Mr Speaker, no one in this debate doubts the deadly serious threat we 
face from Daesh and what they do, although sometimes we find it hard to live 
from the reality.

We know that in June, four gay men were thrown off the fifth story of a 
building [in a Syrian city]. We know that in August the 82-year-old guardian of 
the antiquities of Palmyra, Professor Khaled al-Asaad, was beheaded and his 
beheaded body was hung from a traffic light. And we know that in recent weeks 
there has been the discovery of mass graves in Sinjar, one containing the 
bodies of older Yazidi women murdered by Daesh because they were judged too old 
to be sold for sex.

We know they have killed 30 British tourists in Tunisia. 224 Russian 
holidaymakers on a plane. 178 people in suicide bombings in Beirut, Ankara and 
Surat. 130 people in Paris, including those young people in the Bataclan, whom 
Daesh in trying to justify their slaughter called them apostates engaged in 
prostitution and vice. If it had happened here, they could have been our 
children and we know that they are plotting more attacks.

Standing with the French

 So the question is this, given that we know what they are doing, can we 
really stand aside and refuse to act fully in our self defence against those 
who are planning those attacks.can we really leave to others the responsibility 
for defending our national security when it is our responsibility and if they 
do we do not act what kind of message would that send about our solidarity with 
those countries that have suffered so much including Iraq and our ally France.

 Now France wants us to stand with them and President Hollande the leader of 
our sister socialist party has asked for our assistance and help...

To his Labour colleagues

Mr Speaker, I hope the House will bear with me if I direct my closing remarks 
to myLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> friends and 
colleagues on this side of the house. As a party, we have always been defined 
by our internationalism. We believe we have a responsibility, one to another. 
We never have and we never should walk by on the other side of the road.

And we are here faced by fascists. Not just their calculated brutality, but 
their belief that they are superior to every single one of us in this chamber 
tonight and all of the people we represent. They hold us in contempt. They hold 
our values in contempt. They hold our belief in tolerance and decency in 
contempt. They hold our democracy – the means by which we will make our 
decision tonight – in contempt.

And what we know about fascists is that they need to be defeated and it is 
why, as we have heard tonight, socialists and trade unionists were just one 
part of the international brigade in the 1930s to fight against Franco. It’s 
why this entire House stood up against Hitler and Mussolini. It’s why our party 
has always stood up against the denial of human rights and for justice and my 
view, Mr Speaker, is that we must now confront this evil. It is now time for us 
to do our bit inSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> and that is why 
I ask my colleagues to vote in favour of this motion tonight.
 
There have been rumours that Rosie Winterton, the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> chief whip, voted with the 
government. But she didn’t, the Mirror reports.
