first time, a selected number of gigs will also be opened up to the 14- to 
18-years-old age group.

Maximo Park's lead singer Paul Smith said: "It's exciting to finally play the 
Great Escape â€“ it's got a reputation for showcasing the best of independent 
music in a unique coastal location."

Previous acts to play the Great Escape, which was first staged in 2006, 
include Bon Iver, Adele, Tinie Tempah, Mumford and Sons and Ed Sheeran.
