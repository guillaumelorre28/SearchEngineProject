The director James Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamescameron> has 
appointed the science fiction writerSteven Charles Gould to write four 
standalone novels 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-cameron-spins-avatar-book-612326>
 set in the same universe as his Avatar film and its three proposed sequels.

Gould, who wrote the source novel for the 2008 film Jumper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/17/sciencefictionandfantasy.features>
, has a little time to begin putting the books together. The first Avatar 
sequel is due for release in December 2016.

"Steven Gould is one of the shining lights in contemporary science fiction," 
said Cameron. "I've long admired the worlds and characters he's created in his 
books and stories. We're very fortunate to have Steven bring his formidable 
talents to the Avatar universe. He is already working closely with me and the 
screenwriters to flesh out the expanding world ofAvatar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/avatar>."

The author, who is president of the organisation Science Fiction and Fantasy 
Writers of America <http://www.sfwa.org/about/current-officers/>, looks a good 
fit for the environmentally themed saga, since a number of his books share 
similar concerns.
