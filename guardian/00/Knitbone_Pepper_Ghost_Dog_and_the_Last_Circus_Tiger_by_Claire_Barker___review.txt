When the main characters of a book are ghosts, you know anything can happen. A 
young girl named Winnie has five beloved animals who died and became spirits. 
She’s the only one who can see them. You might wonder why – well, that’s part 
of the plot and it gets revealed at the end.

If you think this book sounds cuddly and happy, you might want to reconsider 
that idea! It actually made my legs shake because I got really scared and 
anxious. I was so curious about what would happen next that I read it very 
quickly.

If you like mysteries and adventures, this book is definitely for you. There 
is of course a circus, a short search for a ruby and a long quest to reunite a 
ghost tiger with his old master.
