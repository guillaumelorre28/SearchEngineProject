A Canberra <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/canberra> man has 
admitted imprisoning a woman for more than a week, repeatedly raping her, and 
forcing her to carve his name into her arm.

The 26-year-old has pleaded guilty to unlawfully confining his victim between 
17 and 25 February last year.


He also pleaded guilty to recklessly inflicting actual bodily harm and four 
counts of sexual intercourse without consent during that period.


In the Australian Capital Territory supreme court on Tuesday, the crown 
prosecutor Sarah McMurray said the man had taken advantage of his victim’s 
naivety, exerting dominance and control over a vulnerable woman.


Making her carve his name into her arm was a demonstration of that dominance, 
serving as a permanent reminder to the victim of what she had endured, McMurray 
said.


“The breach of trust has left her … finding it hard to trust people,” the 
prosecutor told Justice John Burns.


McMurray said the assaults were humiliating and degrading to the woman, and 
called for a sentence of imprisonment.


But she told the court the man’s guilty plea had spared the victim from having 
to give evidence at an expensive trial which could have required interpreters 
and witnesses from overseas.
