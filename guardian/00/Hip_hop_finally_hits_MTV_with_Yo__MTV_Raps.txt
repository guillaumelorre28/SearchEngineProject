MTV may now be associated with continual documentaries about rich kids, but 
for a decade the channel was synonymous with actual music.Hip-hop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop> was initially notable by its 
absence, resulting in frequent criticism of the channel by rappers and fans 
alike. In 1988, the channel finally responded and Yo! MTV Raps was born. Hosted 
by Fab 5 Freddy alongside colourful duo Ed Lover and Doctor Dré, with a 
sprinkling of roundtable discussions and live performances, the show presided 
over a boom in hip-hop videos. Yo! MTV Raps ran for 11 years until 1999, by 
which point hip-hop no longer needed a specialist show.
