The top military commander of the militant group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a 
former al-Qaida offshoot inSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, was 
killed in an aerial raid that targeted a meeting of the group’s leaders, two 
rebel sources said on Thursday.


 They said the commander, whose alias is Abu Omar Saraqeb, was killed at a 
location in the countryside near Aleppo where the group has been playing an 
instrumental role in ongoing battles against Syrian troops and Iran-backed Shia 
militias. The nationality of the jets that carried out the air strike was not 
immediately known.

 An Islamist source told Reuters that the militants were in a hideout in the 
village of Kafr Naha. There were unconfirmed reports that several other senior 
figures were either injured or killed.

 Al-Qaida’s Syrian branch changed its name to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham from Jabhat 
al-Nusra

 – the Nusra Front – in July, when it announced that it was ending its 
relationship with the global jihadist network founded by Osama bin Laden. The 
move, which it said was to remove a pretext used by world powers to attack 
Syrian civilians, may also have been an attempt to appeal to Syrians who have 
long had deep misgivings about Nusra’s links with al-Qaida and the presence of 
foreign jihadists in its ranks.

 The move was dismissed as cosmetic by the US, which said it continued to 
regard the organisation as a terrorist group. Washington said the rebranding 
did not signal a shedding of its ideology.
