The waxwork attraction has added “Fashion Week at Madame Tussauds” this week. 
It is just after the bit with Tom Cruise, Brangelina and Kate Winslet, past Kim 
and Kanye mid-selfie, and before the Star Wars section, which includes the 
opportunity to play Han Solo co-piloted by Chewbacca. It is done out to include 
a backstage area complete with rails of clothes and model polaroids (including 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/04/jourdan-dunn-breaks-rank-and-calls-victorias-secret-bs>
 “Karlie”, “Miranda”, “Jourdan” and even “Kate”), while front of house features 
a catwalk ready for aspiring models, watched by Anna Wintour on the front row 
on one side, and a host of slightly less fashion people in hats and suchlike 
stuck on a hoarding on the other side (I think we know which side is alpha 
there, don’t we?).

Visitors are encouraged to have their catwalk moment, hang out with Kendall 
and sit next to Anna. And not only sit next to her, but put their arm around 
her and take a selfie – behaviour that would get you escorted out of a real 
fashion show. To maintain the illusion, there is also a collection of quite 
frankly terrifying actors playing fashion show producers in character, 
accosting members of the public and telling them to “get into hair and makeup”. 
Watch out, introverts, it’s all part of fun in 2016.

Adding fashion at Tussauds – a tourist attraction drawing in the crowds to its 
current location since 1884 – is a big deal. Each waxwork here takes four 
months to make and costs about £150,000. Fashion was identified as an interest 
of the teenagers often dragged around the exhibit by parents and, indeed, after 
announcing the inclusion of Cara and Kendall, the museum’s following on 
Instagram went up, surely a sign of approval by Generation Z. Judging by the 
four-year-old spotted strutting down the catwalk on Monday, it might have a 
fanbase in the future, too.
