When I was a child, beyond the fact that my parents worked in the restaurant, 
the food we ate at home was very important. The whole family cooked. My parents 
would cook, of course, and whenever the restaurant was closed it was normal for 
me to eat ginger, truffles, mangoes and other strange, exotic things on a 
Sunday evening or a Monday – the one day they had off. Sunday dinners were 
always fantastic!

My grandmother was also a chef. And then there was Epiphania, an aunt who 
lived with us above the restaurant. She was my grandmother’s niece, a very kind 
person who didn’t talk much, but was very alive. She always wore a dress, spoke 
better Basque than Spanish, and was adorable. We had a garden that she loved to 
look after – and she looked after us too. Every morning as my sister and I were 
leaving to go to school, she would ask us what we wanted for lunch (my family 
were always thinking about food). At lunchtime, we’d come home and eat with her 
in the kitchen. It was the most important room in the house – everything passed 
through there, the real living room. The room itself was old-fashioned, but 
alive, always changing. We had a large, marble-topped table, a painting by 
Eduardo Chillida on the wall, an antique clock ...

Epiphania, my parents, my grandmother ... I learned to cook from all of them. 
And my sister too, she’s an art historian now, but she loves to eat, and she 
knows so much about food – she is a specialist of artand food. We were very 
close growing up, and today we still are. She tastes every new plate we make at 
the restaurant and she is very direct and honest with it. We treasure her 
palate.

I was a very calm, introverted teenager, but I had a good sense of humour. And 
it was always especially fun to see Epiphania and my grandmother discovering 
the things my father brought up from the restaurant. I remember I once made a 
creme anglaise with vanilla bean, which for them was completely unknown – the 
Basque version usually has cinnamon and citrus zest. But what I made, they 
liked.

Epiphania was from a farm, and a lot of what she made was traditional Basque 
fare. Like good Basques, we liked anything from the sea and we wasted nothing. 
Squid in ink sauce is an emblematic dish in San Sebastian, often served with 
rice or certainly lots of good bread on the side to dip in the sauce.

The flavours of the sea are what bring me home and this dish captures the 
essence of the Basque country for me. When I lived abroad it’s the one I would 
dreamed of, and my children love it now too – it’s a long-standing family 
favourite.

Clams in squid ink

Serves 4
12 clams
A handful of walnuts, to serve

 For the sauce
40g onions, sautéed
35g green pepper, sautéed
10g toasted bread
1 garlic clove
20g squid ink
100ml water
3 tsp black sesame seeds
Salt and black pepper

For the potato confit
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1.5cm thick slices
Olive oil
Sea salt flakes

For the crumble
150g fine breadcrumbs
Olive oil, for frying
200g fresh tomato juice
20g dried red pepper pulp
A pinch of salt
Black pepper
A pinch of sugar

1 For the mojo sauce, grind together all of the ingredients and mix well. 
Season with salt and black pepper.

2 For the potato confit, place the potato slices in a single layer in a 
saucepan, then completely submerge them in olive oil. Cover and cook very 
slowly over a low heat until completely tender. Remove from the heat and drain 
on kitchen paper, then season with flaky sea salt.

3 For the red pepper crumble, fry the breadcrumbs in olive oil until crispy 
then remove from the heat and drain well on kitchen paper. Add to a bowl with 
the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Set aside.

4 Lightly steam the clams.

5 To serve, divide the potato slices between the serving plates, followed by 
the clams. Dot with the mojo sauce, sprinkle with the red pepper crumble and, 
lastly, scatter with the walnut pieces.
