Despite being called the Blackspot (from Treasure Island), this ethical 
trainer sports a white spot logo, billed as the anti-Swoosh, in reference to 
Nike's famous tick.

The brainchild of Canadian 'culture jammers' Adbusters (see their magazine at 
adbusters.org <http://www.adbusters.org>), the Blackspot's overall mission is 
to prove that it is possible to build a brand that's not based on sweatshop 
labour and bogus celebrity product placement.

The shoe's immediate mission is to 'kick Phil Knight (Nike's CEO) up the ass.' 
Consequently, the shoe is also dubbed the 'ass kicker', and has a helpful red 
dot on the toe cap to help you get your aim right.

The Blackspot is produced in Portugal, in fair and socially just conditions by 
workers who are paid above the minimum wage and allowed to join unions. All a 
welcome contrast to the conditions of workers who make the majority of the 
world's trainers in sweatshops.

And because the shoe is made from organic hemp and processed naturally, and 
the rubber sole and toe cap are 70 per cent biodegradable, the Blackspot has 
excellent eco-credentials, too. Enough perhaps, to persuade tree huggers to 
swap their sandals for a pair of trainers.

· The Blackspot sneaker costs $47.50 (approx £21). To order a pair, go to
