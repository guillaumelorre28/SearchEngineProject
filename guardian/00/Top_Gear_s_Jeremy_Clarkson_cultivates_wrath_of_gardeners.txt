Alan Titchmarsh has hit back at Jeremy Clarkson after the Top Gear host 
claimed gardening only appealed to older people. The Express reports that 
Clarkson wrote in his new book that the pastime was "a pointless way of passing 
the time until you die". Titchmarsh responded by saying gardening was an 
"energising" activity that helped "broaden the mind" – in contrast to the 
fleeting thrills sought by petrolheads: "Let’s get this straight. For some, 
gardening is about growing geraniums, planting hanging baskets and tending 
window boxes – in the same way that, for some, driving a car is about getting 
into a Ford Focus and going down to the shops. But for others, gardening is not 
an especially sedentary pastime, it is a vital and energising involvement with 
the world that surrounds us. Gardens and open spaces lift the spirits, broaden 
the mind, heighten the senses and thrill every bit as much as the transitory 
roar of a Ferrari that is burning up fossil fuel and giving three middle-aged 
men an expensive kick that lasts a few minutes." Clarkson fans may remember 
that the presenter does have a taste for garden design – he installed an 
English Electric Lightning F1A jet fighter in the front garden of his 
Oxfordshire home.The stunt, filmed for his series Speed

believe my claim that it was a leaf blower", claimed Clarkson.
