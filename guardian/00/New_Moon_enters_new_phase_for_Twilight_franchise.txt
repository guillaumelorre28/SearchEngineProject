The winner
When the original Twilight movie arrived in the UK last December, it opened 
with a decent £2.51m – not a bad number, considering Stephenie Meyer's books 
had yet to achieve blockbuster status. But it was far, far behind the US debut 
figure for the picture: $69.6m (£42.1m).
 
What a difference a year makes. With the first Twilight film a huge phenomenon 
on DVD, and the Meyer books belatedly reaching a wide UK readership, Edward 
Cullen and Bella Swan have ascended to iconic characters here, and Britain has 
succumbed to R-Pattz mania. Now sequel New Moon has debuted in the UK with 
£11.68m, which is a whopping 4.6 times the opening weekend of the original 
film. In three days, New Moon has already taken more money at British cinemas 
than Twilight did in its lifetime.
 
New Moon's impressive number is the second-biggest debut of 2009, just behind 
the £11.93m Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince earned over the 
Friday-to-Sunday portion of its five-day opening in July. It's also ahead of 
the opening weekend grosses of other blockbusters over the past three years 
such as The Dark Knight, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, 
The Simpsons Movie, Shrek the Third and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's 
End – as long as previews are ignored and you compare takings over 
Friday-to-Sunday. New Moon just failed to match the opening weekend of 2007's 
Spider-Man 3 (£11.83m), and is significantly behind the debuts of last 
October's Quantum of Solace and 2007's Harry Potter and the Order of the 
Phoenix.
 
Twilight is not the first film franchise boasting a second entry that 
significantly out-performed its predecessor. The Matrix Reloaded debuted with 
takings 3.6 times the opening weekend of the original Matrix, and The Dark 
Knight's opening was 2.5 times that of Batman Begins.
 
The New Moon success powered British cinemas to their best weekend of the 
year, with the top 15 films grossing a collective £20.86m. (The official chart 
compilers record the 17-19 July as the year's best, but that figure is 
artificially swollen by £7.85m in Harry Potter previews.) The number is a 
remarkable 163% up on the equivalent weekend from 2008, when Quantum of Solace 
reigned at the top of the chart for the fourth week in a row.
 
The plucky underdog
Released on 50 screens, the Coen brothers' A Serious Man was never in any 
danger of challenging New Moon for audiences. But with eighth place from 
weekend takings of £321,000 and a £6,422 average, the well-reviewed dark comedy 
has done as well as could be expected, and can now expand if so desired by 
backers Universal. It also did a lot better than Steven Soderbergh's 
corporate-whistleblower flick The Informant!, which began its run with £180,000 
from 116 cinemas and a £1,548 average. A Serious Man stars Michael Stuhlbarg 
and a bunch of similarly obscure character actors; The Informant!, A-lister 
Matt Damon. Hollywood's faith in the primary efficacy of star power has 
presumably taken another little knock.
 
The limpet
While disaster blockbuster 2012 fell a par-for-the-course 46% from its 
stonking opening, Disney's A Christmas Carol continues to demonstrate admiral 
durability with a drop from the previous weekend of just 11% (see chart, below 
for grosses). While audiences naturally decay in the life cycle of a film, a 
rise in festive feeling as Christmas approaches applies a contrary dynamic in 
this case. The challenge for Disney will be to retain screens until schools 
break up for the Christmas holiday, though it will be lucky to hold its 3D 
sites against James Cameron's Avatar.
 
The future
If all the films currently in the market fell 50% and no new pictures were 
released, next weekend would still see healthy takings. New Moon is indeed 
likely to see a big drop, simply because its rabid fanbase would have made 
strenuous efforts to see it as soon as possible, although repeat business 
should soften the landing. It would be reasonable to expect a light weekend for 
new releases, since the second weekend of New Moon's release is hardly a 
congenial place to launch a rival blockbuster. But both low-budget 
word-of-mouth smash Paranormal Activity and Gerard Butler revenge actioner Law 
Abiding Citizen should function as effective counter-programming to New Moon. 
The good times for cinemas are not over quite yet.
