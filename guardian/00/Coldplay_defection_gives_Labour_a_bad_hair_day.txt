On its own, the byline on the page three story in yesterday's Guardian should 
have aroused suspicions. As anagrams go, Olaf Priol is not the most subtle. As 
for the date - 1 April - that should have been the clincher. Nevertheless, the 
crack troops of Labour's spin operation were not going to be deterred. The tale 
that claimed Coldplay's Chris Martin had switched allegiance to the Tories was 
too important to ignore.

So the media monitoring unit, once the pride and joy of Peter Mandelson, 
faithfully copied down the details of Martin's political perfidy, an act that 
apparently followed a yoga class attended by his wife Gwyneth Paltrow and 
Samantha Cameron. Then the story was distributed to most of the government.

It was, of course, complete cobblers, as the supposed lyrics of 'Talk to 
David', Martin's tribute 'song' to Cameron, should have made obvious: events 
'have smashed my illusions about Tony Blair/ His shoes, his suits, his terrible 
hair'.

Yet the story appears not to have triggered alarm bells. 'One or two ministers 
probably got a shock this morning,' admitted aLabour
