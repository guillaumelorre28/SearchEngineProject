The Labour party is divided between those who believe that Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> can continue as leader, 
despite having lost the confidence of 80% of his MPs, and those who think he 
cannot.

I have noticed on your letters page an increase in comment which seems to be 
based on a perception that members of the NEC who no longer support Jeremy’s 
leadership have tried to remove him from the ballot paper by bending the 
party’s rules and constitution and have failed. Nothing could be further from 
the truth.

The NEC are elected as guardians of the party’s constitution, and our task 
last Tuesday was to inform ourselves what were the party’s rules, what were the 
precedents for a leadership challenge, and what was the legal advice.

Lawyers who have advised the party on such issues over many years were 
consulted by the general secretary at the request of the leader’s office. Their 
response was very clear; both the rules and the precedent showed that Jeremy 
Corbyn required 51 nominations to be on the ballot paper.

When this advice was received, the leader’s office instructed the general 
secretary to take legal advice from a specific named lawyer, who, I believe, 
has not advised the party before. He gave contrary advice.

At the meeting more than one NEC member stated that they accepted the advice 
of the party’s usual lawyers and believed it to be correct but that, 
nevertheless, they would cast their vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be on the ballot 
paper automatically because they had been so instructed by their organisation.

If, therefore, there has been any breach of the party’s rules and 
constitution, it seems to me that it is Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters who 
are responsible.

• I confess. I rejoined the Labour party earlier this month solely to defend 
Jeremy Corbyn against his own PLP and the NEC. I thought I became a “card 
carrying” member and was promised that I would be able to take part in 
leadership elections, but now find that I’ve been disenfranchised by the NEC 
and their 12 January cut-off. Equally bizarrely, my local branch meeting 
scheduled for 15 July, to “welcome new members” among other things, was 
cancelled at very short notice under the pretext of an unspecified “threat”. 
Coincidence or conspiracy?

Today I have had to spend a further £25 to become a “registered supporter” in 
order to get a vote, and – surprise, surprise – there was no notification/email 
from Labour central office that there was a strict deadline for registration of 
5pm on 20 July.

Corbyn is a much-needed breath of fresh air to UK politics, and that is 
probably why Labour party membership numbers have exploded. The general public 
are sick of vacuous, mealy-mouthed and self-serving politicians. It is lovely 
to have someone who is highly principled. moral and who speaks their mind, no 
matter what the media response – sadly including the Guardian – says.

So bite the bullet, if you can. Pay the £25 and show the MPs and MEPs who 
really owns the Labour party.

• I suggest that Polly Toynbee (Forget Trident: Labour needs to focus on 
issues that matter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/forget-trident-labour-needs-to-focus-on-issues-that-matter>
, 19 July) read thereport written by LSE academics on journalistic 
representations of Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/Mainstream-Media-Representations-of-Jeremy-Corbyn.aspx>
. Their analysis found that he was represented unfairly by the British press 
through a process of vilification that went well beyond the normal limits of 
fair debate and disagreement in a democracy.

They argue that he is systematically treated with scorn and ridicule in both 
the broadsheet and the tabloid press, in a way no other political leader is or 
has been. They conclude that this vilification is unhealthy from a democratic 
point of view, and poses serious ethical questions as to the role of the media 
in a democracy.

Most of us have come to expect what the report calls an “attackdog” approach 
from tabloids such as the Sun and the Daily Express, but surely the Guardian is 
committed to meeting basic standards of fairness in its reporting?

• Christina Green says Jeremy Corbyn “does not have the support of many Labour 
voters” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/labour-alternative-voting-options-in-leadership-election>
, 19 July). She and others who intend to vote on this basis should reflect on 
the reality rather than the propaganda. Arecent ComRes poll 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-considers-legal-challenge-8435835>
 found that Labour voters think Corbyn has a much better chance of winning a 
general election than either Angela Eagle or Owen Smith: by a margin of 50% 
against 23% compared with Eagle, and 44% against 26% compared with Smith.

• As far as I know, Momentum is not a political party. If Cath Ryde, the chair 
of Bolton Momentum (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/17/shameful-treatment-of-jeremy-corbyn-and-shades-of-deja-vu>
, 18 July) believes that it and its leaders should be treated like a party, 
then they should form one, and put up candidates in a local and national 
elections, rather than try to take over an existing party. If they do, a 
genuine leftwing option can be put to the electorate alongside a Labour party 
of whatever ilk. Like most of your readers, I have no time for Ukip, but at 
least it had the courage to go to the electorate in an appropriate democratic 
way, a courage which, so far, Momentum lacks.

• Zoe Williams’ assertion that Labour party leadership contender Owen Smith MP 
is not “tarnished by the Blair years and the vote on the Iraq war” repeats 
Smith’s pitch to Labour members, but it doesn’t quite compute with his 
previous public statements (Owen Smith: decent bloke, good politics. But is 
that enough? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/owen-smith-ed-miliband-labour-crisis>
, 18 July).

Interviewing Smith in 2006, Wales Online noted 
<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/owen-smith-iraq-war-working-2338066>
: “He didn’t know whether he would have voted against the war”, with Smith 
arguing “the tradition of the Labour Party and the tradition of left-wing 
engagement to remove dictators was a noble, valuable tradition, and one that in 
South Wales, from the Spanish Civil War onwards, we have recognised and played 
a part in.”

Smith goes on to note he supports privatisation of the NHS, Private Finance 
Initiatives and academies, explaining “I’m not someone, frankly, who gets 
terribly wound up about some of the ideological nuances”. This was clear when he
abstained on the 2015 welfare bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/20/benefit-cuts-to-hit-huge-number-of-children-government-figures-show>
, which the government’s own figures said would push 330,000 children from 
low-income families further into poverty, with single mothers and ethnic 
minorities hit particularly hard.

Asked if he was prepared to “annihilate possibly millions of people” by firing 
Trident bythe BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07lp37j/the-andrew-marr-show-17072016>, 
Smith replied that: “You’ve got to be prepared to say yes to that.”

A decent bloke?
