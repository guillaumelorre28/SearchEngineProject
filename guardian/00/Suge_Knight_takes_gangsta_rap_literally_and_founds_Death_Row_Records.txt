It was not just a battle between east and west coast, but between two types of 
hustle. The rough, in the form of Compton-born Marion "Suge" Knight, a failed 
American footballer whose intimidating physique and links to street crime 
became an asset while running gangsta rap label Death Row Records. And the 
smooth, epitomised by Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs, suburban New Yorker and founder 
of the Bad Boy label, a marketing genius with an ego even bigger than his mouth.

Both sought to dominate hip-hop as it went mainstream in the mid-90s. Their 
respective rosters were home to rival talents –Dr Dre

Smalls on Bad Boy – but the Californians took their allotted role a little too 
seriously. In 1992, Knight pistol-whipped, then threatened to kill, aspiring 
rappers George and Lynwood Stanley, for using a studio phone while he was 
expecting a call.

Chart rivalry and lyrical pot shots gave way to escalating threats, with Tupac 
and Biggie murdered within six months of each other in 1996 and 97. It's a sign 
of the chaos of the era that both killings remain unsolved. Long-term, Combs's 
business acumen won out, with Knight ending up in prison and bankrupt. But, for 
a while, criminality paid.
