Earlier today I set the following three puzzles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/02/can-you-solve-it-new-year-new-number-new-equation>
, variations on the same theme:

Fill in the equations below using any of the basic mathematical operations, +, 
–, x, ÷, and as many brackets as you like, so that they make arithmetical sense.

1) 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017

2) 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017

3) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017

The pleasure of these puzzles is in the elegance of the statement, the 
simplicity of the tools required and the achievability of a solution. As I 
wrote, there are almost a thousand ways to solve the first one.

I usually solve these problems by dividing the year into its divisors, and 
then trying to make each divisor from the ten digits. This method was not 
possible this year since 2017 is prime. So what I did - and I think many of you 
did too - was to find an expression that ended in either + 1 or + 2 – 1, and 
make the numbers from 10 to 2, or 10 to 3, equal the much friendlier 2016.

I received dozens of different solutions to the first question, the 
ten-countdown. The most popular one was also to my mind the most appealing, 
since you can write it without brackets, assuming you perform the operations in 
order from left to right. The first person to enter this was the Tweeter A 
Bernery. A copy of my book on its way to you, sir! (Or madam, hard to say from 
the image).

Solved it, or came up with 1 solution anyhow:

Operations in order, no brackets:
10 * 9 * 8 * 7 / 6 / 5 * 4 * 3 + 2 - 1 = 2017 #MondayPuzzle

The most concise solution for the the nine-countdown was sent in via email 
from Dima:

9 x 8 x 7 x (6 – 5) x 4 x (3 - 2) + 1 = 2017


And my preferred solution to the third one was in a comment to my original pos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/02/can-you-solve-it-new-year-new-number-new-equation>
t by LadyLoverlysChatter and uses similar thinking:

8 x 7 x 6 x (5 - 4) x 3 x 2 + 1 = 2017

The bonus question in the photo caption, to find numbers for H, E, L and O 
such that H E L L O = 2017 was not solved by anyone!

If H = 7, E = 8, L = 6 and O = 1, then H x E x L x L + O = 2017

Thanks for getting involved and I’ll see you in two weeks for some more 
Ja-neuron-ary puzzle action.
