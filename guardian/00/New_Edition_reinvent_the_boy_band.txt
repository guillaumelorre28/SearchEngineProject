Formed under the aegis of manager Maurice Starr, Boston's New Edition were 
more than a Jackson 5 for hip-hop kids. With Bobby Brown and all of Bell Biv 
DeVoe in the line-up, they would shape much of contemporary R&B. However, it 
did take a while for them to see the benefit: the royalty cheque from their 
debut album was just $1.87. Starr later repeated the formula with New Kids on 
the Block, and the boyband as we know it was born.
