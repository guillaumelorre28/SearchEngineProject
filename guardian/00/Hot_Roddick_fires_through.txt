Andy Roddick continued his blistering start here, conceding only five games 
against French qualifier Julien Benneteau to move into the last 16.

The second seed hit 17 aces and conceded only 14 points on his serve as he 
wrapped up a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory in only 82 minutes.

Roddick was in devastating form from the start, breaking Benneteau in his 
first service game as he went on to claim the opening set in just 19 minutes.

Although Benneteau held serve first up in the second set, Roddick then broke 
twice in a row as the Frenchman's error count began to climb.

Roddick did not offer a break-point opportunity in the entire match.He refused 
to speculate on a possible final against world No1 Roger Federer, insisting he 
is only focusing fourth-round opponent, Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis.

"I don't really think I have the luxury of worrying about next week, I have to 
get there first," he said. "There's always upsets, as has been shown so far 
this week. I go match by match.

"Not once during a match do I think, 'Okay, I have to finish this in a certain 
time.' I'm just looking, 'Okay, let's get a break. Okay, let's make sure this 
set's over. Let's get another break.' That's kind of where my mindset is.

"I just think it's so senseless talking about Roger until I actually get 
there. I'm worried about Baghdatis right now. It seems like he's a pretty smart 
player. He's not a guy that's going to take himself out of a match."

Meanwhile 11th seed David Ferrer downed 18th seed Mario Ancic in straight 
sets, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. Eighth seed Gaston Gaudio recovered from two sets to love 
down only to lose in five to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro.

In an epic match played in searing 35-degree heat, Santoro eventually 
prevailed after almost four hours 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 1-6, 6-4.
