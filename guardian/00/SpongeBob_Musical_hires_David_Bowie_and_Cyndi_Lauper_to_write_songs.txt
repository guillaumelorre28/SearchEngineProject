“Music has always been an important part of the show and everyone saw this as 
a real creative challenge ... We have a story and a subplot, but it’s all 
spiced with the particular flavourings of the SpongeBob universe.”

Producers called it “a rousing tale of a simple sea sponge who faces the 
unfathomable. It’s a celebration of unbridled hope, unexpected heroes, and pure 
theatrical invention.”

It will open at Chicago’s Oriental theatre on 7 June, and run for at least one 
month, with an eye to a Broadway transfer.

No cast members have been announced yet, not even who will pay the titular 
role of SpongeBob.

 Landau said actors would not be dressed in prosthetics. Instead they would be 
put through their paces in circus-style workshops to explore “how the human 
body can transform itself into cartoon-like characters”.

The US animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants premiered on 
Nickelodeon in 1999, picking up a slew of awards over its nine-season run, and 
spawning two feature films.
