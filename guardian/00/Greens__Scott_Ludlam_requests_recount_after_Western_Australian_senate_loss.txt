<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/western-australia> Greens candidate 
Scott Ludlam has formally requested a partial recount of votes after losing his 
bid to return to the Senate, with Palmer United party candidate Zhenja Wang 
taking his place.

The Australian Electoral Commission is expected to determine the request 
within 24 hours, a spokesman for Senator Ludlam said.

A 14-vote difference between two of the micro-parties - the Shooters and 
Fishers Party, and Australian Christians - meant preferences went against 
Senator Ludlam.

The spokesman said he had not requested a full recount, "just the relevant 
ones".

Labor's David Johnston won the first spot, followed by Joe Bullock (Labor), 
Michaela Cash (Liberal), Linda Reynolds (Liberal), Wang and Louise Pratt 
(Labor).

The former Liberal senator Helen Kroger also lost her spot in Victoria.

In NSW, rising Liberal star Arthur Sinodinos has scraped into the Senate in 
the final spot behind the Liberal Democrat candidate David Leyonhjelm.

The Liberal senator Marise Payne and the Nationals senator John Williams were 
returned, as were former Labor premier and foreign minister Bob Carr and 
Labor's Doug Cameron, according to the Australian Electoral Commission.

Leyonhjelm has said his party benefited from the first spot on the NSW ballot 
paper and from confusion caused by the use of "Liberal" in the party's name.

In Queensland, Ian Macdonald, James McGrath and Matthew Canavan secured Senate 
spots for the Liberal National party, Chris Ketter and Claire Moore won for 
Labor and former footballer Glenn Lazarus of the Palmer United Party won a spot.

Senate results in all states and territories have now been released by the 
electoral commission.
