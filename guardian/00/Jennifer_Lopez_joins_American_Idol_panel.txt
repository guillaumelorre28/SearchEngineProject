Jennifer Lopez <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jennifer-lopez> and Steven 
Tyler will join Randy Jackson as American Idol judges next season, after months 
of speculation about the future of American television's top-rated show.

With pomp rivalling that of a US Supreme Court appointment, Fox TV has finally 
assembled the new pieces of the panel that will return to its original 
three-member format for season 10.

Actress-singer-dancer Lopez and Aerosmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aerosmith> frontman Tyler will have the job 
of trying to match the offbeat chemistry of former judges Simon Cowell and 
Paula Abdul.

Tyler said he wanted to join the show because "it's being a part of something 
much bigger than yourself ... I want to bring some rock to this rollercoaster 
and show if you've got the heart, the talent, the feeling to do this you could 
be the nextAmerican Idol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/american-idol>."

"I'm so excited," Lopez said. "I'm looking for the next Michael Jackson."

The likely Lopez-Tyler pairing had been reported so frequently that Fox would 
have had to produce Betty White and 50 Cent instead to generate any surprise.

Lopez and Tyler could help American Idol reinvent itself for the new season, 
when it will try to stem a ratings slide and bring in younger viewers. The 
show's audience has been gradually ageing, and advertisers prefer to pitch to 
young adults.

But Fox and the show's producers didn't match the new judges to the target 
audience when it comes to age: Lopez is 41 and Tyler is 62.

On the 6, Lopez's first album, came out in 1999 and launched a career in pop, 
Latin, hip-hop and R&B. Love? is the latest CD from the Grammy winner.

Tyler brings a colourful and tempestuous history with him. He's fought with 
his band mates, been in rehab for prescription drug abuse andfell off a stage 
in 2009, which forced the cancellation of Aerosmith's summer tour.
