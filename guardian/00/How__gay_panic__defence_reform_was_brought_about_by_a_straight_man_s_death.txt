Wayne Ruks was not gay, says the woman who raised him as a single mother. His 
opinion was in fact that homosexuality was “unnatural” and he opposed same-sex 
marriage.

But it stands to be the Queensland man’s legacy that, through the 
extraordinary legal aftermath of his death, the archaic “gay panic” defence 
available to violent offenders will be finally struck fromAustralian law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-law>.

On Wednesday the Queensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> government tabled a 
bill to strike down the use of “unwanted homosexual advances” as a cause of 
provocation by people who commit assault, manslaughter or even murder.

Plan to remove Queensland’s 'gay panic defence' welcomed but urgency called for

It is a hangover from old English common law that only Queensland and South 
Australia have so far failed to exclude 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/south-australias-gay-panic-defence-must-go-say-greens>
 by legislation.

The Queensland government reform, introduced in the last parliamentary sitting 
of 2016 and expected to pass early next year, follows promises by the South 
Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, to do likewise.

Both governments have finally responded to a tireless campaign by a Catholic 
priest, father Paul Kelly, in whose churchyard Ruks was found beaten to death 
in 2008.

One of his killers, Jason Andrew Pearce, argued during trial that Ruks tried 
to touch his crotch and sexually propositioned him – a claim at odds with CCTV 
footage from a camera that Kelly had installed.

The use of the gay panic defence was formally dropped but both Ruks’ mother, 
Joyce Kujala, and Kelly believe it influenced the outcome, which saw murder 
charges downgraded to manslaughter convictions. Pearce served four years of a 
nine-year sentence before getting out on parole in 2012. Richard Meerdink has 
applied for parole on his 10-year sentence.

Kujala told Guardian Australia upon learning of the Queensland bill: “If my 
son brought this about through his death, at least there is some good that came 
out of it.

“I would say really if that stupid law didn’t exist these men would have got a 
lot more time for taking a life.”

Kelly said the bill followed years of lobbying, including of three different 
Queensland governments, despite all other states barSouth Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> moving on the 
issue a decade ago.

“It’s been a massive effort, unfortunately,” he said. “At one point both sides 
[of politics] were sort of saying, aw no, the law didn’t exist and doesn’t need 
changing – but suddenly everyone’s saying it is a problem and does need 
changing, so that’s good to hear.

“This is as far as we’ve ever gotten and I’m fairly confident it will [pass]. 
Apparently the LNP have committed as well to support it.”

Kelly said his campaign came after following the Ruks murder trial and being 
astonished at why the judge had not “howled down” the use of the gay panic 
defence.

He said Kujala had “rightly picked up that this was perjorative and somehow 
going against the victim” and the fact she was forced to publicly clarify her 
son’s sexuality after his death beggared belief.

When the gay panic defence was again raised in the case of the bashing death 
of hitchhiker Stephen Ward 
<http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/hitchhiker-killer-snapped-after-homosexual-advance-20111013-1lnv9.html>
, found in bushland near Kelly’s Maryborough church just six months later, the 
priest decided it had “gone too far”.

Kelly eventually started a petition on Change.org 
<https://www.change.org/p/stop-allowing-gay-panic-as-an-excuse-for-murder-in-australia>
 that went on to attract almost 290,000 supporters, one of the largest in the 
site’s history.

His petition prompted a post from Weatherill in May pledging to abolish gay 
panic as provocation. Kelly said he looked forward to the South Australian 
government following Queensland “swiftly” in kind.

Yvette D’Ath, the Queensland attorney general, had Kelly at her side when 
announcing the reform bill on Wednesday.

Kelly says when he began the petition he “actually expected 100 people”.

“When it took off I hadn’t seen anything like it and it really opened my eyes 
the power of the community. But in some ways it was a no-brainer. The fact it’s 
taken so long sends a message. But that this law’s being changed now sends 
another message that the law is the same for everybody. It’s not going to give 
certain members of the community less protection from violence.”

The Queensland Greens spokeswoman Kristen Lyons applauded the move to “take 
the hate out of our judicial system” a week after the state was forced to mourn
the death of 13-year-old Tyrone Unsworth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/25/teenager-killed-himself-after-constant-bullying-about-his-sexuality>
, “another young person driven to suicide after suffering bullying because of 
their sexuality”.

Emile McPhee, the director of the LGBTI Legal Service, said the long-awaited 
reform “sends a welcome message of acceptance to the Queensland LGBTI 
community, showing that Queenslanders will not accept violence on the basis of 
sexuality”.

The irony that the plight of Ruks, who was hardly an advocate for legal 
equality for gay men, is nevertheless poised to bring this about is not lost on 
Kujala.

“It’s not a question of homosexuality here, it’s a question of what you say to 
a person,” she said.

South Australia's 'gay panic defence' must go, say Greens

“The CCTV footage didn’t show my son making any advance. You’ve got a defence 
lawyer who brings in an old law on his say so without any advance whatsoever 
but on their word that something happened.”

Kujala was close to her son, a handyman on a disability pension. She was 
developing an acreage with him as “our assignment together” when he was killed.

He was about to move south to be closer to her. Kujala last spoke to him on 
the phone. Three days later police knocked on her door. She drove through 
pouring rain to Nambour to identify his battered body. He had bled out after 
being left for dead.

“Time doesn’t heal to any great degree when it comes to murder,” Kujala said.

But with the Queensland reforms now before parliament and South Australia’s 
presumably to come, “there’s a little bit of an opening of promise now”.

“I never thought the day would come that my son had to die to bring about a 
change of law.”
