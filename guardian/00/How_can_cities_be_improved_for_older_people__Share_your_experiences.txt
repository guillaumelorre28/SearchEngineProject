As lifespans get longer, we are seeing the demographic balance in many of our 
cities transform, with a significant rise in ageing populations. But are cities 
well designed for older age – and what are the challenges and opportunities of 
urban life for older generations?

Ageing London, a report published by the Mayor’s Design Advisory Group on 
Friday 
<https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mdag_good_growth_agenda_-_ageing_london_interactive.pdf>
 [pdf], provides recommendations on how to support a more age-friendly UK 
capital. The report advocates the development of innovative new models of 
housing for older Londoners and the establishment of a “lifetime high streets” 
programme to support older residents in starting new businesses and to create 
new intergenerational community spaces.

By 2035, the report explains, the number of over-60s in London is expected to 
increase by 48%; the number of those aged over 80 is set to increase by 70% in 
the same period. For the first time, the over-60s could outnumber the under-16s 
as a proportion of the total population of Greater London.

How will ageing populations shape our cities? Whichever city you live in the 
world, we’d love to hear about your experiences as an older person of the 
challenges and benefits of urban life. How could your city improve for older 
residents? What physical or social changes would you like to see happen to 
enable a more inclusive, age-friendly city? Share your experiences, ideas and 
thoughts in the form below by Monday 11 April. A selection of the responses 
will form part of our upcoming ageing cities series.
