Qatar has banned The Danish Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-danish-girl> - the film about an artist 
who undergoes one of the world’s first sex changes and which stars Oscar-winner 
Eddie Redmayne - from cinemas, officials announced Monday.

The move follows protests online about the “depravity” of the film, which had 
begun screening at some cinemas in Doha this month.

“We would like to inform you that we have contacted the concerned 
administration and the screening of the Danish film is now banned from 
cinemas,” the culture ministry wrote on Twitter. “We thank you for your 
unwavering vigilance.”

The film, which is loosely based on the lives of two Danish painters in the 
1920s, had first been screened inQatar <https://www.theguardian.com/world/qatar>
 last Thursday. One member of staff at a Doha cinema, who did not wish to be 
named, said authorities had told them to remove the film on Monday. It was 
immediately pulled.

Redmayne, who won the best actor Oscar in 2015 for his portrayal of Stephen 
Hawking in The Theory of Everything, plays pioneering transgender woman Lili 
Elbe in the movie.

Its screening, though, had provoked an angry reaction among some cinemagoers.

The Doha News website reported that some had taken to social media to complain 
that the movie was being screened in Qatar, and one viewer complained about the 
film’s “moral depravity” after seeing the trailer.
