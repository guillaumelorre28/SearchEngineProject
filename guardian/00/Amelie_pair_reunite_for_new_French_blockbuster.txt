The director and star of Amélie, the highest-grossing French-language film in 
recent memory, are set to reunite for a new, and potentially equally lucrative, 
engagement.

Maverick director Jean-Pierre Jeunet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jean-pierre-jeunet> will be in charge of one 
of the biggest budgets ever for a French-language film - over €40m (£30m)- for 
Un Long Dimanche de Fiançailles (A Very Long Engagement), adapted from the book 
by Sebastien Japrisot.

Audrey Tautou <https://www.theguardian.com/film/audrey-tautou>, the word 
"gamine" made flesh in Amélie, will play Mathilde, a young woman who sets out 
on a quest to discover the truth of how her fiance died in no man's land during 
the first world war.

The budget for this film puts it in the same ballpark as the most expensive 
French-language productions thus far: the Asterix and Obelix films, Vs Caesar 
and Mission Cleopatra, each costing about €45m.

Shooting on the Warner Bros-produced film is set to commence on August 4 in 
locations across France. It is scheduled for release in October 2004.
