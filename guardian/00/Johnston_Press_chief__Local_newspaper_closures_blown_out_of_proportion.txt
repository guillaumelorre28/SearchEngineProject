The chief executive of Johnston Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press> has said the number of local 
newspapers closed over the last decade has been “blown out of all proportion”, 
with most of the 300 being shut not “papers of record” that are vital to most 
UK communities.

It is estimated more than 300 local newspapers 
<http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/johnston-press-closures-mean-more-300-uk-local-newspapers-have-been-closed-ten-years>
 have been closed in the last 10 years, with around 1,100 still published 
across the UK.

Ashley Highfield <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield> said it 
is too simplistic to look at the overall number of closures.

“The regional press has closed very few papers over the last few years,” said 
Highfield, speaking to the House of Commons culture select committee on 
Wednesday. “This is something that is often blown out of all proportion. The 
papers that have been closed were often the freesheets that were opened in the 
1990s to mop up low-yielding advertising revenues when the times were good.”

Highfield said the titles that had closed were opportunistically launched and 
existed alongside the far more important “paper of record” that most 
communities continue to rely on.

“The titles have been closed were those titles: weekly freesheets, usually in 
communities where a publisher has a paid-for title as well but wished to 
ring-fence out low yielding, often classified, ads into a secondary title. I 
think you’ll find the numbers of papers of record that have closed over the 
last decade is incredibly low. That is something that needs to be understood.”
