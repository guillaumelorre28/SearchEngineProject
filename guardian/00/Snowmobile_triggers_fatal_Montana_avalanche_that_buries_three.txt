The dead man and his companions, all of whom hail from North Dakota, have not 
been identified.

Undersheriff Clay Herbst said five people were riding snowmobiles when one of 
the riders got stuck. That started an avalanche, which buried three riders.

Authorities said all the riders were experienced, and had avalanche beacons, 
shovels, and backpacks with inflatable airbags. Authorities did not say if the 
airbags were deployed.

The Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center warned people in the backcountry 
about dangerous conditions. Officials said on Sunday that continuing snowfall 
and strong winds have made the snowpack unstable and natural and 
human-triggered snow slides are likely.

The warnings cover the mountains near Cooke City, the Madison Range, the 
Gallatin Range, the Lionhead area near WestYellowstone
