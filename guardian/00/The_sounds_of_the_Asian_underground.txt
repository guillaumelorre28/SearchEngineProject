Eastern sonics had long been a staple of dance music's cut-and-paste ethos. 
But in mid-90s London clubland, a new generation of British Asian kids, based 
around Talvin Singh's weekly Anokha night (at Old Street's Blue Note) and the 
Outcaste label's monthlies, blended eastern sounds with electro and drum'n'bass 
and – like the best musical subcultures – inspired hundreds of pop sociology 
essays in the process. A reaction to Britpop's jingoism? A new generation 
finding a voice? Or a previously marginalised youth group dancing to a new 
beat? Possibly, definitely and maybe.
