"It's good when people appreciate the work you do," Samuel Antwi says, 
standing in the shop where he works. "I received a present from someone the 
other day, thanking me for my help."

Antwi is 25 and works part time as a licensed chemical seller. He sells 
medication to the community and diagnoses their illnesses.

"I enjoy interacting with people and helping the community when I can. We have 
a lot of problems here, particularly with malaria."

The medium-sized shop where Antwi works is located by the side of a road in a 
small town. But he has bigger plans.

"I am a student. I work here to get my money so that I can study economics. I 
want to help my country. There is a lot of work to be done. But in the 
meantime, I enjoy it here. This project seems to be working."

Antwi points to a row of chairs running along one side of the room where his 
patients can sit. He explains that he likes to get to know his customers and 
spend time with them. It allows for a better diagnosis.

Outside, above the shop door, is a sign that roughly translates as "mind your 
own business", encouraging people not to meddle in others' affairs.

Fortunately for the community, Antwi's business is to find out their problems 
so that he can treat them effectively – and the community is happy to let him 
do so.HPW
