When a young man, Matthew Woods, thinks it's OK, after a five-year-old child 
has been abducted, to place cruel comments on a social network, he is revealing 
an almost sociopathic lack of empathy. When a fully grown adult, Barry Thew, 
reckons it's dandy to stroll around in a T-shirt exhorting the murder of police 
officers, he might as well be wearing a T-shirt saying: "I have lost all sense 
of humanity."

Yet the resort to custodial sentencing

both cases

 shows that our criminal justice system lacks empathy, too. It's clear these 
men are, at the very least, poorly socialised. "Anti-social behaviour" has been 
a political hot potato for years. The fact that people are now being jailed for 
being not criminal but simply inadequate is evidence of a systemic lack of 
confidence in this culture's ability to ascertain why they behave 
anti-socially. This itself is anti-social – and perpetrated by the people in 
authority.
