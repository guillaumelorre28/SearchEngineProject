Andre Agassi <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andre-agassi> has responded to 
criticism of his crystal meth use with a plea for compassion, saying he needed 
help when he took the drug while depressed in 1997.

Discussing his new autobiography on the US TV show 60 Minutes, Agassi became 
emotional when reacting to comments by Martina Navratilova, who said she was 
shocked that he lied about the drug use.

"It's what you don't want to hear," Agassi said. "I would hope along with that 
would come some compassion that maybe this person doesn't need condemnation. 
Maybe this person could stand a little help. Because that was at a time in my 
life when I needed help.

"I had a problem, and there might be many other athletes out there that test 
positive for recreational drugs that have a problem. So I would ask for some 
compassion."

In his book which goes on sale on Monday, the eight-time grand slam champion 
says he used crystal meth in 1997 and failed a drug test, but avoided a ban 
after telling ATP officials that he had unwittingly taken the substance.

Agassi told 60 Minutes he has no regrets about his revelations. "I had way 
more to lose by telling this story in its full transparency than I had to 
gain," he said. "The part that I worry and think more about is who this may 
help."
