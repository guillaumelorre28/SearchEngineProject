This book is an autobiography of Andrew Flintoff’s life. As you may know, 
Flintoff was an England cricketer between 1998 to 2009. He has already written 
a book, which is mainly about his statistics and cricketing life. However, 
Second Innings is generally more about his life before and after he has retired 
from the game, which will appeal to non-cricket fans as well.

This autobiography is about how there are there are two people who ‘control’ 
Flintoff’s life and that both of those people are him. They are completely 
opposite, one is unafraid to take risks who is called Fred; on the other hand, 
Andrew is shy.

Mostly, Fred dominates, but Andrew sometimes kicks in. Second Innings also 
involves the period when he put on the boxing gloves for a short amount of time.

Andrew, or Fred, will capture the reader’s attention straight away and has 
mentioned all of the interesting facts of his life and missing out the 
unessential items.

The first sentence immediately makes the reader want to carry on:

There have always been two people jostling for control of my life, two totally 
opposite characters.

I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 9; however, I would 
strongly suggest that anyone with a passion for cricket or for autobiographies 
to read this as Flintoff has structured it very well, allowing everyone to 
enjoy it.
