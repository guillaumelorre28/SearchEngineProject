Abbey National shareholders are set to mark the end of an era when they give 
their backing to a takeover by Spain's largest bank today.

Investors are expected to allow Santander Central Hispano (SCH) to take 
control in a deal worth more than Â£8.5bn when they gather to vote.

Although around 800 people normally attend Abbey's shareholder meetings, there 
will be space for 2,500 investors at north London's Wembley conference centre, 
with overflow rooms for a further 1,100.

Abbey has around 1.7 million small shareholders who received windfall shares 
when the bank converted from a building society in 1989.

SCH received a boost in its bid to secure the bank last night when City 
watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA) said it saw no reason to block 
the deal.

Although no formal decision has been made, the FSA said it saw "no material 
impediments" to the proposed takeover.

A spokeswoman for Abbey described the statement as welcome news ahead of the 
vote. A major development in SCH's battle for the bank occurred last month when 
rival HBOS group walked away from making an approach. The takeover bid was 
given approval by the European Commission on the same day.

Earlier this week, the Spanish bank said it would allow Abbey investors with 
2,000 or fewer shares and who live in the UK to use its free share dealing 
facility without needing to complete a Spanish tax form.

If the takeover is given the go-ahead by Abbey shareholders today and Banco 
Santander investors next week, the deal is expected to be completed in November.

As part of the tie-up, Abbey investors will receive one SCH share for each 
Abbey share owned, but most are expected to cash these in.
