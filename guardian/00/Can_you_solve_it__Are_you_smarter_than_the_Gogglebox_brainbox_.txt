Hello guzzlers,

In the the week that Gogglebox is back on the telly, we’re all going to try 
our hands at some brilliant puzzles.

The following four gems were all devised by Bill from Gogglebox: he’s the one 
that sits next to his pal Josef in a house in Cambridge.

Bill is William Hartston, a former British chess champion, a writer and a 
longtime lover of maths and puzzles. A kindred spirit.

To solve these brainteasers you will have to think laterally. If you are 
struggling I’ll be back at noon UK with some tips. (Tips now added below)

Now relax on your sofa, make sure you have refreshment at hand – a plate of 
biscuits, a Pot Noodle or a gin and tonic – and enjoy:

1) What is the next number in the following series?

23, 9, 20, 14, 14, 9, 20, 6, ...

2) Mary I; George III, Henry III, James II, George IV, Charles I, ...


Why might Henry I be an appropriate way to end the series?

3) What comes next in the following series?


2.1, 3.5, 3.3, 2.3, 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 1.8 ...

4) What comes next in this series: 


1, 2, 9, 12, 70, 89, 97, 102 ...

Thanks so much to Bill for letting me use these puzzles. His most recent book 
Even More Things That Nobody Knows: 501 Further Mysteries of Life, the Universe 
and Everything <http://amzn.to/2dd3zTp> is terrific and is out in paperback in 
November.

I’ll be back with the answers at 5pm UK.

I post a puzzle here on a Monday every two weeks. If you want to propose a 
puzzle for this column, pleaseemail me <mailto:bellospuzzle@gmail.com> I’d love 
to hear it.

I’m the author of several books on maths, as well as the kids book Football 
School: Where Football Explains the World <http://amzn.to/2bqxfYt> which tells 
you loads of amazing stuff parents don’t tell you such as when exactly 
footballers poo, why eagles are the most common mascot for football teams and 
how to play football on Mars

TIPS

1) Think about the alphabet.

2) Think what the numbers might be referring to.

3) Think about your keyboard.

4) Think about subtracting 1.
