Intriguing: Amazon.com will, if you search for "iPad" 
<http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=ipad&x=0&y=0>
, offer as the first result a page which compares its Kindle Fire with said 
iPad, gives you the price of the Kindle, and tells you that it has "All the 
popular movies, apps, music, and games, but at half the price."

Talk about using your marketing advantage and leverage to install yourself in 
the market.

? Still yes.

From which you can probably conclude that as far as Amazon is concerned, there 
are only two tablets in the Christmas race at the moment. And also conclude
