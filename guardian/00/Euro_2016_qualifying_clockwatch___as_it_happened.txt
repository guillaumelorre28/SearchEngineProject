Well, a sickener and no mistake for Turkey, but perhaps more so for Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, who despite the equaliser find 
themselves six points behind the group leaders with five games to play. Of 
course they aren’t completely borked, but it will take something fairly 
remarkable for them to get one of the two automatic spots. The playoffs it 
could be for them, then. Eesh.

Can Guus Hiddink survive this? Well, one wonders, but the long-term plan is 
for current assistant Danny Blind to take the top job - would it be any use to 
bin off the head coach and simply replace him with someone who is presumably 
part of the problem?

GOAL! Holland 1-1 Turkey (Huntelaar (90+2)

Oh my days. Just after six minutes of added time is signalled, Sneijder picks 
the ball up just outside the area, he shoots with some force and it may or may 
not be heading for the corner, but before it may or may not get there it hits 
Huntelaar on the back and flies into the net. Jammy gets.

Route one stuff from Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, 
as De Vrij hoofs one in the direction of Dost up top, and the home fans really 
have turned on their boys. The boos and whistles ring out when the Dutch have 
the ball, while it’s all ‘OLÉs’ when the Turks are in possession.

The Dutch really are in a state. After Narsingh, with the ball about five 
yards outside the Turkish penalty area, turns around and plays the ball all the 
way back to his defence, the Amsterdam air is ripe with boos and whistles. 
Colin Kazim-Richards has come on forTurkey

Close! Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy> so very nearly take 
the lead as the ball falls to Gabbiadini in the area, he controls, spins around 
and pulls a left-footed shot across goal, but he pulls it too much and the ball 
trickles past the post. Conte is, to say the least, super-miffed on the 
touchline.

GOAL! Belgium 5-0 Cyprus (Batshuayi 80)

They’re having great fun over there now, as the ball falls to Michy Batshuayi, 
who had only replaced Benteke a few moments earlier, and he measures a 
delightful finish into the corner of the net.

Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy> knocking on the door now,

GOAL! Belgium 4-0 Cyprus (Hazard 67)

More deliciousness from the Belgians, almost straight away, as Hazard twinkles 
in from the left, shifts onto his right foot and measures a marvellous shot 
that pings in off the far post, leaving the keeper rooted.

GOAL! Belgium 3-0 Cyprus (Fellaini 65)

Marc Wilmots spins around like an ice dancer mugging for the judges as 
Marouane Fellaini bags his second, and it was a beauty. The Big Fleshy Tree 
cuts in from the right and curls a delightful left-footed shot into the far 
corner.

Woof! A bit of life from Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>
 as Afellay launches a shell of a left-footed half-volley from a ways outside 
the box, which is just above Babacan so he should save, and does, but there was 
some spice on that shot. Meanwhile, amusing scenes as Sen is replaced by Hakan 
Calhanoglu, retreating from the pitch with the slowest run that humanity can 
imagine, all the while turning to the referee who was hurrying him along saying 
“What? I’m running!” Or something.

GOAL! Andorra 0-3 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Dzeko 62)

There he is again, Edin Dzeko swooping to collect his hat-trick and the 
matchball, once again set up by Lulic. Think they’re going to win this one.

Goal machine Bas Dost is warming up for Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, and might be doing so with more 
gusto as they miss a great chance. A cross comes over for Huntelaar that the 
striker can’t quite get to, but does enough to put off the keeper and the ball 
falls to Narsingh, who has half an open goal to aim at but pulls it wide of the 
post. Bad miss, that.

GOAL! Andorra 0-2 Bosnia-Herzegovina (Dzeko 49)

That’s the lead doubled in Andorra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/andorra>, as Manchester City’s Dzeko, 
after Senad Lulić breaks down the left, crosses and the striker is there to 
convert an easy finish.

Right, that’s yer lot. Cheers for joining and reading. Interesting night of 
European football. Yes.
 
Well, a sickener and no mistake for Turkey, but perhaps more so for Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, who despite the equaliser find 
themselves six points behind the group leaders with five games to play. Of 
course they aren’t completely borked, but it will take something fairly 
remarkable for them to get one of the two automatic spots. The playoffs it 
could be for them, then. Eesh.

Can Guus Hiddink survive this? Well, one wonders, but the long-term plan is 
for current assistant Danny Blind to take the top job - would it be any use to 
bin off the head coach and simply replace him with someone who is presumably 
part of the problem?
 
If it’s possible, both teams look disappointed with that result.
 
Oh my days. Just after six minutes of added time is signalled, Sneijder picks 
the ball up just outside the area, he shoots with some force and it may or may 
not be heading for the corner, but before it may or may not get there it hits 
Huntelaar on the back and flies into the net. Jammy gets.
 
Not so much the Italians. The Bulgarian players look devastated to have drawn 
that.
 
Likewise for the Bosnians. 
 
Easy, that for the Belgians.
 
Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy> pressing for a winner here. 
Immobile dances into the area from the left, and shoots a cross low across the 
face of goal, but it’s cleared just in time.
 
Exodus in Amsterdam, as the stands empty. Is this it for Hiddink?
 
Route one stuff from Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, 
as De Vrij hoofs one in the direction of Dost up top, and the home fans really 
have turned on their boys. The boos and whistles ring out when the Dutch have 
the ball, while it’s all ‘OLÉs’ when the Turks are in possession.
 
The Dutch really are in a state. After Narsingh, with the ball about five 
yards outside the Turkish penalty area, turns around and plays the ball all the 
way back to his defence, the Amsterdam air is ripe with boos and whistles. 
Colin Kazim-Richards has come on forTurkey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/turkey>, by the way.
 
Close! Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy> so very nearly take 
the lead as the ball falls to Gabbiadini in the area, he controls, spins around 
and pulls a left-footed shot across goal, but he pulls it too much and the ball 
trickles past the post. Conte is, to say the least, super-miffed on the 
touchline.
 
What. A. Goal. The sub does it for Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy>, picking up the ball outside the 
area out on the left channel, and the Sampdoria forward curls an absolute 
beauty right into the top corner.
 
They’re having great fun over there now, as the ball falls to Michy Batshuayi, 
who had only replaced Benteke a few moments earlier, and he measures a 
delightful finish into the corner of the net.
 
Calhanoglu tries one from way, way out for Turkey, but it flies wide. 
Meanwhile Jetro Willems comes on forHolland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, replacing Martins Indi.
 
Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy> knocking on the door now, 
but in the manner of a drunk man coming home from a ‘few quiet pints’ that 
turned into an eight-hours session after work. Gabbiadini tries a shot from 
range, but it sails wide.
 
The two Dutch subs combine as Jarsingh flinghs over a cross from the right 
looking for Dost, but he can’t quite get a proper header on it, and it bounces 
and loops to the keeper.
 
Chance for Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>, as Sneijder 
weighs up a free-kick, curls it over the wall but it just keeps on curlin’, 
curlin’, curlin’ past the post.

Not bad, Eden: https://t.co/wNvaHDyhNy <https://t.co/wNvaHDyhNy>

In Sofia, Valeri Bojinov - or as Manchester City fans know him the man Sergio 
Aguero could’ve been - is into the action.
 
Of course, Fatih Terim being involved recalls a favourite pun...
 
Chance for Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy>, as Immobile 
tries a shot, it’s saved and the rebound falls to Bertolacci, who - and this is 
a technical term - guffs it up good and proper.
 
Here’s Dost for the Dutch, the striker coming on for Nigel de Jong. Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> will be playing 
four-four-fucking-two.
 
More deliciousness from the Belgians, almost straight away, as Hazard twinkles 
in from the left, shifts onto his right foot and measures a marvellous shot 
that pings in off the far post, leaving the keeper rooted.
 
Marc Wilmots spins around like an ice dancer mugging for the judges as 
Marouane Fellaini bags his second, and it was a beauty. The Big Fleshy Tree 
cuts in from the right and curls a delightful left-footed shot into the far 
corner.
 
Woof! A bit of life from Holland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland>
 as Afellay launches a shell of a left-footed half-volley from a ways outside 
the box, which is just above Babacan so he should save, and does, but there was 
some spice on that shot. Meanwhile, amusing scenes as Sen is replaced by Hakan 
Calhanoglu, retreating from the pitch with the slowest run that humanity can 
imagine, all the while turning to the referee who was hurrying him along saying 
“What? I’m running!” Or something.
 
There he is again, Edin Dzeko swooping to collect his hat-trick and the 
matchball, once again set up by Lulic. Think they’re going to win this one.
 
Update from Belgium: Cyprus are rubbish, Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium> are still winning. Will let you 
know when that changes.
 
Oriundo ahoy - Eder has replaced Simeone Zaza for Italy
