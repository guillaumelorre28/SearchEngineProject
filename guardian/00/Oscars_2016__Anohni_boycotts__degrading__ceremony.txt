Transgender Oscar nominee Anohni <https://www.theguardian.com/music/anohni> 
has explained her decision to boycott the Oscars, saying that she feels 
“degraded” by not being invited to perform.

In a year of controversy for the Academy Awards over their lack of diversity, 
a nod for the song Manta Ray by Anohni – the first transgender performer to 
receive a nomination – should have been something to celebrate. Instead, she 
says she was left embarrassed and angered by the lack of invitation to perform 
her song, a duet with J Ralph commissioned for climate change documentary 
Racing Extinction.

 Listen to Manta Ray by Anohni and J Ralph 
In an online post on her website 
<http://www.antonyandthejohnsons.com/news/news.html> she wrote: “Everyone told 
me that I still ought to attend, that a walk down the red carpet would still be 
‘good for my career’. Last night I tried to force myself to get on the plane to 
fly to LA for all the nominee events, but the feelings of embarrassment and 
anger knocked me back, and I couldn’t get on the plane.”

She continued: “I imagined how it would feel for me to sit amongst all those 
Hollywood stars, some of the brave ones approaching me with sad faces and 
condolences. There I was, feeling a sting of shame that reminded me of 
America’s earliest affirmations of my inadequacy as a transperson. I turned 
around at the airport and went back home.”

Other nominees set to perform include Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, The Weeknd and 
Dave Grohl, who is not nominated for an Oscar.


Anohni says she doesn’t believe she was singled out for being trans, and 
accepts that the other performers are all names with more commercial heft. But 
she believes a lifetime of facing such rejections has made each one impossible 
to turn a blind eye to.

If you trace the trail of breadcrumbs, the deeper truth of it is impossible to 
ignore. It is not one isolated event, but a series of events that occur over 
years to create a system that has sought to undermine me, at first as a 
feminine child, and later as an androgynous transwoman. It is a system of 
social oppression and diminished opportunities for transpeople that has been 
employed by capitalism in the US to crush our dreams and our collective spirit.

She contrasted the awards ceremony with that of the UK’s Mercury Prize which 
she won in 2005 asAntony and the Johnsons for I Am a Bird Now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/11/popandrock.shopping5>: “All the 
nominees were invited to perform that night. They lifted me from obscurity and 
celebrated me, setting off a chain of events that changed my life forever.”

Anohni’s new album Hopelessness will be released in May.
