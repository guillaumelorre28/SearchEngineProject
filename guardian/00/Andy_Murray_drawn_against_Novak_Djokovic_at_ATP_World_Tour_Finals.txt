Andy Murray has been drawn against Novak Djokovic, the world No1, in the group 
stages of the BarclaysATP World Tour Finals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atp-world-tour-finals>, which start at the 
O2 Arena in London on Sunday.

The world No3 will also take on the Spaniard David Ferrer – who he defeated in 
the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year – and Tomas Berdych of the 
Czech Republic in Group A. The latter provides a chance for revenge for Murray,
after Berdych ended the Scot's 18-match winning run last week at the Paris 
Masters

.

Rafael Nadal is the top seed in Group B alongside Roger Federer – who won a 
record-equalling fifth circuit finale title in London last year – plus 
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France and the American Mardy Fish.

Djokovic has had a stunning season which has seen him claim the Australian 
Open, Wimbledon and US Open titles among a total of 10 tour successes. However, 
he is struggling at present with a shoulder problem which forced him to 
withdraw from the Paris Masters.

Murray has won five tour titles so far this season, in Shanghai, Tokyo, 
Bangkok, Cincinnati and at Queen's.

Nadal and Federer meet in a repeat of the 2011 French Open final, Federer's 
only grand slam final appearance of the season. The 30-year-old comes into the 
tournament fresh from victory in Paris, however, and can surpass Ivan Lendl and 
Pete Sampras with a sixth finals title with victory in London.
