Andrew Flintoff’s cricketing renaissance is set to continue with the former 
England all-rounder closing in on a deal to play in Australia’s Big Bash 
Twenty20 competition with Brisbane Heat.

The 36-year-old came out of retirement for Lancashire this summer and a 
surprise appearance in the T20 Blast final, where two bludgeoned sixes and a 
wicket with his first ball nearly set up a fairytale comeback before 
Warwickshire eventually prevailed,served as an eye-catching return to the game

.

Since then, according to the Daily Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/andrewflintoff/11158702/Andrew-Flintoff-to-continue-remarkable-comeback-by-closing-in-on-Big-Bash-deal-for-Brisbane-Heat.html>
, Flintoff has been in discussions with Brisbane Heat – coached by his former 
Lancashire team-mate Stuart Law – and looks set to join his fellow 2005 Ashes 
winner Kevin Pietersen, who will play for the Melbourne Stars, in the Big Bash, 
which begins in December.

Back in 2009, after retiring from Test cricket, Flintoff was heavily linked 
with a move to play Twenty20 for Queensland but his continued injury problems 
denied him the chance before forcing him into retirement in September 2010.
