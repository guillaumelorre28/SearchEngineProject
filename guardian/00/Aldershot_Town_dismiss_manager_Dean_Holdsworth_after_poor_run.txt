Aldershot Town <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aldershottownfootball> 
have sacked their manager, Dean Holdsworth, after a poor run of results. The 
Hampshire club have taken seven points from their past seven matches and, 
although they are sitting 20th in League Two, they are only two points above 
the relegation zone.

A club statement read: "Despite Tuesday evening's hard-fought result against 
Torquay [a 1-0 win] the board of directors have taken the decision to terminate 
the contract of first-team manager, Dean Holdsworth, with immediate effect.

"The board would like to place on record their thanks and appreciation for 
Dean's efforts during his time at the football club and acknowledge the 
difficult circumstances under which Dean has managed to steer us out of the 
relegation places.

"Dean also leaves as a Football League manager with the club remaining in 
Football League status.

"However, despite this and taking into account our current league position and 
game in hand of those teams around us, the board felt the time was right to 
maximise the positive momentum of Tuesday's result in order to give the best 
possible chance of retaining our League status.

"With this in mind and just 13 games left of the season we must now move 
quickly and make every effort to find a suitable replacement that can help us 
achieve those immediate ambitions.

"We understand the time-sensitive nature of any discussions and hope to be 
able to confirm the position prior to Saturday's home fixture against 
Fleetwood."
