Impact measurement often strikes fear into charities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/feb/24/charity-impact-measurement-results-outcomes>
 – large or small. It is something that organisations are increasingly expected 
to do, yet it can be difficult to know where to begin.

To shed some light on this, we went to the real experts – our Twitter 
followers – and asked them to share their top tips.

Here is a selection of our favourites, but we’d like to hear yours too - feel 
free to post them in the comments section, below.

@GdnVoluntary <https://twitter.com/GdnVoluntary> start somewhere. It can seem 
overwhelming otherwise. Also realise that there's learning in things with 
low/negative impact.

Work out how you'll use impact measurement before you do it. If you can't, 
don't start yet.@GdnVoluntary <https://twitter.com/GdnVoluntary> #twittertips

@GdnVoluntary <https://twitter.com/GdnVoluntary> Measurement is about 
improving & not just proving - if the measure doesn't help you make decisions, 
it's the wrong one

/@GdnVoluntary <https://twitter.com/GdnVoluntary> Forget about measurement for 
marketing/fundraising. What do you need to measure to MANAGE your programme?
