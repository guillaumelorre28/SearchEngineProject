How do you mostly listen to music?

On an iPhone with headphones. 


What was the first ever record/CD you bought? 

A record of Mozart Piano Concertos featuring Daniel Barenboim. (That’s not 
counting theAbba <https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba> record I was given 
when I was five.)


What was the last piece of music you bought? 

Schubert’s Complete Songs, performed by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. 


What is your musical guilty pleasure? 

I’m still enjoying the songs of the Mamma Mia! soundtrack 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN6ZMsnB_2E>. 


If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what 
would you choose? 


Violin or cello.

Is applauding between movements acceptable?

Yes.

What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert? 


I quite like the format as it is. Anything that helps the atmosphere of a 
performance is great, no matter where it takes place or what clothes people 
wear.


What has been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? 

The Berlin Philharmonic <https://www.theguardian.com/music/berlin-philharmonic>
’s performance of Bach St John Passion with Christian Gerhaher and Mark Padmore 
underSimon Rattle <https://www.theguardian.com/music/simon-rattle> last year, 
and watching Christian Tetzlaff play the Beethoven Violin Concerto with Daniel 
Harding this year: absolutely breathtaking.

We’re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, 
would you travel back (or forward) to and why?

It would be great to get to know Mozart or Brahms personally. Of the composers 
I love, they would probably be the most communicative and fun to talk to. I 
would also loved to have been present at that famous concert in Vienna that 
consisted entirely of Beethoven’s premieres, including the Fifth and Sixth 
Symphonies, Piano Concerto No 4 and his Choral Fantasy.

Do you enjoy musicals? Do you have a favourite? 

Not much. The ones by Leonard Bernstein are still by far the best; I very much 
enjoy West Side Story and Wonderful Town.


Which conductor or performer of yesteryear do you most wish you could have 
worked with? 


Carlos Kleiber.

What, in your opinion, is the best new piece written in last half century? 

Jörg Widmann’s Violin Concerto.

What is the most overrated classical work? Is there a warhorse whose appeal 
you really don’t relate to? 


Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsodies: I can’t bear them.

Which non-classical musician would you love to work with? 

Sting <https://www.theguardian.com/music/sting>, Elton John 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/elton-john>, Billy Joel, Roger Hodgson.

Imagine you are a festival director here in London with unlimited resources. 
What would you programme – or commission – for your opening event?

Bach’s St John Passion. Or a big concert with a mixed programme (chamber 
music, orchestral, concertos with different soloists) with the wonderful Royal 
Northern Sinfonia .
