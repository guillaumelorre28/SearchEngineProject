Neil Jones, the chief commercial officer with Johnston Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press>, has suddenly left the 
company after just five months in the role. He had previously spent two years 
as the publisher's commercial and marketing director.

His duties are to be taken on an interim basis by John Bills, managing 
director of Johnston's south Yorkshire division, until a permanent successor is 
appointed.

His departure, reported on Friday (4 July) 
<http://mediatel.co.uk/press/news/2014/07/04/neil-jones-to-stand-down-as-johnston-press-cco/>
, comes against the background of the group's recent Â£360m capital refinancing 
plan, which has had the effect of cutting its debt by more than a third.

Jones issued a statement saying: "I have decided it's the right time to look 
at other opportunities... As a result of the recent, successful refinancing 
Johnston Press is in far better shape than it was when I joined and I want to 
wish the company well going forward."

Johnston's chief executive, Ashley Highfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield>, thanked Jones for his 
contributions.

Jones joined Johnston Press from News International, where he was director of 
commercial strategy. He was previously managing director at Carat, where he 
worked for 17 years.
