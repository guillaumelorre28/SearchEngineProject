Colin Purdom (Letters

, 18 October) is mistaken in asserting that alcohol is not fattening. As any 
A-level biology student should be able to tell you, it is converted by the 
liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, then by aldehyde 
dehydrogenase to acetic acid. This then enters the breathtakingly complex Krebs 
cycle to be further broken down to water, carbon dioxide and ATP, which is the 
body’s source of chemical energy. Of course, a sugary alcoholic drink will 
still have more calories than the equivalent-strength non-sugary one, but 
sadly, dry champagne is not calorie-free.

• So the £1bn spent on troubled families “has had little effect” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/governments-448m-troubled-families-scheme-has-had-little-impact-thinktank>
, 18 October). Time then for the director of the troubled families programme, 
Louise Casey, to return the CBE she was given in the 2016 birthday honours list 
for services to families and vulnerable people? Or do we not expect 
accountability from those who preach the same message to others in public 
service?

• Surely it was the spectators who “braved the rain” in Manchester on Monday, 
not the Olympic athletes (Heroes of Rio brave the rain to celebrate record 
medal haul, 18 Octobert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/you-can-feel-the-atmosphere-britains-olympians-and-paralympians-enjoy-rainy-victory-parade>
, 18 October). Or does training stop when it’s damp?

• “London will probably cease to be the financial centre of the EU”, writes 
William Wallace (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/u-turns-are-possible-on-the-road-to-hard-brexit>
, 13 October). So, not all bad news then. It’s high time that the domination of 
our economy by self-serving, socially toxic, borderline criminal finance 
capital was broken.

• If the trend to scrap humanities A-levels such as art history and 
archaeology continues, a new area of inquiry may soon emerge: the study of now 
defunct A-levels (Burying A-level archaeology is barbarism, says Tony Robinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/17/scrapping-archeology-classics-a-levels-barbaric-tony-robinson>
, 18 October).
