Do you find that the intensity of the material makes it difficult to continue 
beyond a certain point?

MCCARTHY

No, it’s not that. I entertain most nights. In the afternoon you wear the mud 
mask of your being. And then the guests arrive and you are a new thing. It is 
the unspoken promise of nightfall. It takes time. Time that hunts you, time 
that is calamity.

Kickstarter said its rebranding and will now be a part of the "e" free tech 
club, which includes Tindr, Tumblr and Grindr.

This was not a decision we made lightly; there were a number of 
considerations. Let's talk about design. We think there is a profound and 
enduring beauty in simplicity, clarity, and efficiency. True simplicity is 
derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation. 
Sculptors do not add clay to their statues. Instead, they chisel away at the 
nonessential until their refined vision is revealed. To that end, we’ve chosen 
not to add but to minimize, and boldly remove the nonessential “e” from our 
name.

A Minnesota zoo has again set up four extra phone lines for Mr Lion, Ms Ella 
Fint, Mr Wolf and Ms Anna Conda.

Como Park Zoo and Conservatory 
<http://www.comozooconservatory.org/news/como-continues-april-fools-fun/> came 
up with the idea in response to a common prank where people leave trick 
messages for friends from people named things like Don Key and Sally Mander, 
then including the phone number for the local zoo.

"It helps that our front-line staff now has somewhere to quickly transfer 
these calls to instead of trying to explain that there is no one here with the 
name ‘Sally Mander,'" said zoo director Michelle Furrer in a release. "The 
ultimate hope is that, instead of people calling our main phone number and 
tying up our staff, pranksters will use the special numbers we’ve set up when 
leaving messages for their friends.”

Atlanta Magazine reports 
<http://www.atlantamagazine.com/covereddish/2014/04/01/ford-fry-signs-on-as-justin-biebers-personal-chef>
 that one of the city’s beloved chefs, Ford Fry, has signed up to be Justin 
Bieber’s personal chef.

Fry says he was initially hesitant to work with Bieber, but later convinced 
himself that the experience would be worth it. “I have kids myself,” Fry says. 
“They’re Beliebers. I guess I’m one now, too.”

The spirit of Bieber’s personal menu, according to Fry, will channel 
“adolescent sentiments” and “general angst.” Think dark chocolate cotton candy 
made with Peruvian cocoa powder, Lil’ PB&J brownies, deep-dish pimento cheese 
pizza, and “Gangnam Style” charcuterie. (Fry would not elaborate on this dish.)

New York City Coalition Against Hunger <http://nyccah.org/> sent out a gag 
press release claiming the House GOP wants infants to work for the food 
assistance program directed at women and children, WIC.

“We shouldn’t have to wait for children to turn five and get school lunches 
for them to learn the freedom-promoting value of work. Lazy bum babies 
shouldn’t be coddled with all sorts of indolence-promoting nutrition. Give an 
infant free food and, next thing you know, they’ll want health care, and we all 
know that turns them into takers,” said House Budget Committee Chair, Paul Ryan 
of Wisconsin. “Come to think of it, we shouldn’t have to wait for babies to 
even be born to teach them the necessity of self-sufficiency. Since the WIC 
program aids pregnant woman, we should install treadmills in their wombs so 
embryos learn the value of work while reading Ayn Rand.”

The gag is inspired by Georgia representative Jack Kingston, who suggested 
that kids should sweep floors to earn school lunch through a federal school 
lunch program. He then defended the comments by saying he thinks kids in all 
socioeconomic classes should have work ethic. Again,this part is not a joke

Bon Appetit has stories on “The World’s First Rat Cafe 
<http://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/article/brooklyn-rat-cafe>,” “The 
Normcore Diet 
<http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/slideshow/normcore-foods/?slide=1>
,” and “A Visit to a Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast Farm 
<http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/boneless-skinless-chicken-breast-farm>
.”

The farm looks just as the packaging promised. Red barn. Silo. Rolling hills 
and a big yellow circle that appears to be the sun, but might also be a 
jumbo-size Vitamin D lamp. Either way, the “sun” is radiating the premises, 
where it glistens off the vacuum-packed plastic of rows of boneless, skinless 
breasts, sunning themselves as far as the eye could see.

I say sunning, but closer examination reveals parasols and cabanas shielding 
the breasts. Some have their plastic wrap slathered in zinc oxide. “Without 
their skins, they gotta be careful outside,” comes a voice. “We don’t want them 
getting overcooked, now, do we.”

The Guardian Australia's April fools' story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/01/lamington-invented-in-new-zealand-new-research-proves-beyond-doubt>
 has gone down rather too well, even fooling Wikipedia.

Readers in Australia woke up to news, filed by Guardian reporter Olaf Priol, 
that their most famed dessert, the Lamington, was in fact created in New 
Zealand and called a "Wellington". Most readers saw a red herring, spotting 
instantly the date of the report and the reporter's dubious record for 
reporting non-facts. But a minority appear to have taken the story as fact.

The lamington's Wikipedia page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamington> 
referenced Priol's article, beginning with the sentence: "A lamington is a 
dessert of New Zealand origin."

Whilst local radio in Queensland, previously understood to be the home of the 
aforementioned sugary treat, called in a local baker to decry foul play by the 
New Zealanders.

"The lamington has apparently been spotted in a 19th Century water colour 
painting in Auckland.... and thus is no longer an Australian invention!" said 
drive time host Tim Cox.

A further search for the artist JR Smythe revealed it is likely he never 
existed.

It's 7am, your alarm has irritated you out of bed and you've made it to the 
breakfast table for your daily porridge. You spit it out. Somebody has switched 
the salt and sugar pots.


It can only be April 1st. But before getting stuck into financial years, 
serial rain showers and Easter holidays, it's time for some well planned 
practical jokes.


After midday if you crack an April Fool, the joke is on you. Which means there 
are a few short hours left to crack the clues on the worldwide web and hoodwink 
your family, colleagues and followers. Share your guesses online and your gags 
at home in the comments below. Tweet me your photos and tell me what I've 
missed on twitter@EmmaEHoward <https://twitter.com/EmmaEHoward>

I'll start you off with a trawl through the Guardian archives - every April 
Fool's prank we've ever pulled
