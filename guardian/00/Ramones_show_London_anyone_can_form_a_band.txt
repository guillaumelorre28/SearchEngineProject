On Independence Day 1976, the Roundhouse in London hosted the veteran San 
Francisco band Flamin' Groovies. All the young punks came out that night, but 
not to see the headliners. They were there to see and (in the cases of the 
Clash and the Sex Pistols) meet the support band, the Ramones, who had inspired 
the first wave of UK punks, and whose appearance here would galvanise many 
more. The NME, reviewing the show, said Ramones played "first step moronorock 
strung across a selection of imbecilic adolescent ditties". It was meant as a 
compliment, just about.
