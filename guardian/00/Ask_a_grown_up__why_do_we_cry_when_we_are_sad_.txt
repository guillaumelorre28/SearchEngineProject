Tears signal helplessness, especially during childhood when humans are at 
their most vulnerable. Quite simply, they show a need of support from others.

While other mammals show signs of distress by noisy crying, the sound of which 
helps keep mothers nearby, humans are the only species to produce emotional 
tears. We are also one of the few species who carry on crying into adulthood.

Scientists have been researching why this is for decades. Humans are unique in 
that we have very long, relatively independent childhoods. As we age, we move 
away from noisy crying to showing tears, so only those close to us can see that 
something is wrong. While making noise, as other animals do, does attract a 
mother, it can also draw the attention of predators. I believe humans show 
their distress by shedding tears rather than emitting sounds, because it helps 
protect us. Tears mean there is less chance of us attracting danger.
