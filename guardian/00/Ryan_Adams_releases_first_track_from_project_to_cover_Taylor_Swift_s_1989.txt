 in its entirety.

On Thursday, Zane Lowe played Bad Blood on his Beats 1 show. Adams’s version 
is smoother and more gentle than the original, sprinkled with pedal steel 
guitar that takes Swift back to her Nashville roots.

Adams announced that his 1989 album will be released digitally on 21 
September, with physical versions to follow. The wayward troubadour has shared 
clips from the sessions on Instagram, promising a string quartet on Blank 
Space, which also boasts a “deep-end Smiths vibe”.

Welcome to New York, meanwhile, promises to be “the saddest version ever – or 
your tears back”. However, other tracks – for instance Style – are more upbeat.

On Twitter, Swift described the news of the album’s release as “surreal and 
dreamlike”. Adams has form in unusual covers, recently bowing to the inevitable 
and covering his near-namesake Bryan Adams’ Summer of 69. In 2002,he covered 
the whole of the Strokes’s album Is This It

Ryan's music helped shape my songwriting. This is surreal and dreamlike.
