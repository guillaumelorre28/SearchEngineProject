Recent reports that Apple planned to cut iPhone production has put the 
company’s suppliers under pressure this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/jan/06/arm-loses-3-on-reports-apple-plans-iphone-production-cuts>
, and that trend is continuing.

The Nikkei in Japan said earlier in the week that Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> could cut production of the 
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus by about 30% in the March quarter compared to its 
original plans.

Last night two US suppliers to Apple issued warnings, with Radio Frequency 
chip supplier cutting fourth quarter revenues by 14% and audio chip company 
Cirrus unveiling a 10% decline.

This news has helped push UK chipmaker Arm down 14p to 954p while rival 
Imagination Technologies has fallen more than 5% to 118.5p and electronics group
Laird <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lairdgroup> is 0.1p lower at 
325.5p. Liberum analyst Eoin Lambe said:

Cirrus stated that the weakness only came through late in the fourth quarter 
and will predominately impact the first quarter. [There is a] negative read to 
Laird (18% of revenue from Apple), Imagination (34% of revenue ) and Arm 
(around 7% of revenue). Imagination’s balance sheet may start to get tight.
