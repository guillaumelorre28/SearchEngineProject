Adele has scored five nominations for her album 25. The singer has previously 
won 10 Grammys. She’ll duke it out against Beyoncé for album of the year 
alongside Drake,Justin Bieber <https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber> 
and country singer Sturgill Simpson, a surprise nominee for A Sailor’s Guide to 
Earth.

This year’s new artist category sees Chance the Rapper continue a banner year 
with a nomination alongside Anderson Paak, Maren Morris, Kelsey Ballerino and 
the Chainsmokers. The breakout rapper has received seven nominations in total, 
also featured in categories including best rap album.

David Bowie has also picked up posthumous nominations in five categories, 
including best rock performance and best rock song. Last year’s ceremony saw 
Lady Gaga perform a tribute to the late singer.

Amy Schumer has picked up two nominations for comedy album and spoken-word 
album for the audio version of her book, while breakout Netflix show Stranger 
Things has also scored two nods for its score.

The full list of nominees has a notable absentee, Frank Ocean, whose acclaimed 
album Blonde was not entered before the 30 September deadline. “That 
institution certainly has nostalgic importance,” Ocean told theNew York Times 
last month 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/arts/music/frank-ocean-blonde-interview.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0>
. “It just doesn’t seem to be representing very well for people who come from 
where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.”

West has said that he would boycott the awards if Ocean failed to receive any 
nominations.Speaking during a show 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLnWDXyQalA&feature=youtu.be> in California 
last month, West said: “The album I listen to the most this year is Frank 
Ocean’s album. I’ll tell you this right now, if his album is not nominated in 
no [sic] categories, I’m not showing up to the Grammys. As artists, we’ve got 
to come together to fight the bullshit.”

While West has eight nominations, he’s not included in major categories, such 
as record, song and album of the year. His album The Life of Pablo is only 
featured in rap-specific categories.

At the 2016 awards, Taylor Swift picked up album of the year
