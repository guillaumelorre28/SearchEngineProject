Maggie Smith kicks box-office butt

It was English national treasures (Maggie Smith, Alan Bennett) v American 
brainiacs (Aaron Sorkin, Steve Jobs) at the UK box office this week, with the 
former scoring a convincing victory.The Lady in the Van 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/lady-in-the-van> opened with a very healthy 
£2.26m, as against £913,000 for Steve Jobs.

The number compares very well with the last film adaptation of a Bennett play: 
The History Boys <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/13/drama> debuted 
with £795,000 in 2006, on its way to a total of £4.34m. Much of the difference 
can be attributed to the box-office power of Smith, who supported the film with 
an appearance on the Graham Norton Show, her first chatshow appearance in four 
decades. The film had a very defined (older) audience, which the distributor 
Sony was able to target with marketing.

 The Guardian film team review The Lady in the Van 
The debut number is similar to the opening frame of older-skewing titles such 
asThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145794/best-exotic-marigold-hotel> 
(£2.22m) andThe Iron Lady <https://www.theguardian.com/film/iron-lady> 
(£2.15m), and ahead ofPhilomena <https://www.theguardian.com/film/philomena> 
(£1.51m) andSuffragette <https://www.theguardian.com/film/suffragette> (£1.55m, 
excluding hefty previews). Sony reports a high number of tickets purchased at 
senior discount, and expects the proportion to rise on weekdays, when the older 
audience tends to be especially active.


The Steve Jobs <https://www.theguardian.com/film/steve-jobs> number can be 
compared with the UK debut of £2.49m, including £383,000 in previews, of the 
Sorkin-scriptedThe Social Network 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-social-network>. It’s perhaps fair to say 
that the story of Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg is relatable to more people than 
the story of Apple and Steve Jobs. The release of The Social Network, in 2010, 
was also arguably more timely.

Spectre pushes towards £80m

 The Guardian film show review of Spectre 
By most measures, third-weekend takings for Spectre of £7.83m are pretty 
impressive. Only in comparison toSkyfall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/skyfall>, which grossed £10.45m in its third 
frame, does the Spectre number suffer. After 21 days, Spectre has grossed a 
hefty £77.6m. Skyfall had reached a very similar £77.3m at the same stage of 
its run.


Skyfall went on to achieve a remarkable £102.9m, and you might say that 
Spectre looks on course to reach a similar number. One fly in the ointment is 
that Spectre’s grosses are more front-loaded, with successive weekly declines 
of 34% and 40%. The equivalent drops for Skyfall were 20% and 35%. In other 
words,Spectre <https://www.theguardian.com/film/spectre> is, so far, tailing 
off quicker.

Spectre is already the fourth-biggest hit of all time in the UK, behind only 
Skyfall, Avatar (£94.0m) and Titanic (£80.1m, including the 3D re-release). 
Next come Toy Story 3 (£74.0m) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 
(£73.1m).

Spectre faces a significant challenge from this Thursday, with the arrival of 
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/04/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-review-jennifer-lawrence>
. Skyfall faced an equivalent blockbuster challenge (The Twilight Saga – 
Breaking Dawn Part 2) in its fourth week of release, dropping 47% from the 
previous frame.

Released by Warners into 102 cinemas, Fathers and Daughters

, starringRussell Crowe <https://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe>, Amanda 
Seyfried and Aaron Paul, landed belly-up in 24th place, with just £25,200. Its 
screen average was a very poor £247. Crowe has had an uneven run lately: his 
last film, The Water Diviner, opened here with a weak £522,000 from a wide 420 
cinemas. In February 2014, he played a key supporting role in A New York 
Winter’s Tale, which began with £258,000 from 327 venues. In between, he proved 
much more appealing in Noah, which opened with £2.51m.

With Diwali falling last Wednesday, several new Hindi films were positioned 
for audiences, notablyPrem Ratan Dhan Payo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/16/prem-ratan-dhan-payo-review-salman-khan-sensitive-side-on-show>
, starring Salman Khan and Sonam Kapoor. The film’s debut of £725,000, plus 
previews of £187,000, is the biggest for a Bollywood title sinceBajrangi 
Bhaijaan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/19/bajrangi-bhaijaan-review-salman-khan-india-pakistan-movie>
 opened with £758,000 in July. Before that, you’d have to go December 2013 and 
Dhoom 3’s debut of £885,000. If you add in the previews, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo 
has the edge on those earlier openings.

number of those venues and dropped 82% in box-office revenue.Kill Your Friends 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/05/kill-your-friends-review-grubby-satire-on-the-britpop-industry>
, starring Nicholas Hoult as an amoral A&R music executive, plunged by 87%, 
contracting from 169 cinemas to 58. All these films look set to lose further 
screens and showtimes from this Friday.

 Jennifer Lawrence prepares for revolution in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, 
Part 2 
Thanks to continuing business from Spectre and a nice assist from Maggie 
Smith, the market overall delivered a 21% uptick on the equivalent weekend from 
2014, when Interstellar continued at the top spot and The Imitation Game was 
the top new release. A year ago, the next frame saw the arrival of The Hunger 
Games – Mockingjay: Part 1, and Lionsgate has picked the same slot for the 
series finale. Going by the box-office performance of other YA franchises when 
the final book was split into two films, expect Mockingjay: Part 2 to 
out-perform its predecessor. Other distributors are predictably running scared, 
but The Dressmaker, in which The Hunger Games’ Liam Hemsworth stars opposite 
Kate Winslet, may pick up some fans of the actor eager for second helpings.
