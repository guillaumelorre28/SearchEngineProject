Free banking in Britain is "idiosyncratic" according to Barclays boss John 
Varley <https://www.theguardian.com/business/john-varley>, below, who reckons 
it might be time to start charging customers for the privilege of putting their 
money in deposit accounts with close to zero return on investment.

At a public question-and-answer session organised by the government's 
commission reviewing the future of banking, Varley told his audience: "It's 
possible that free-if-in-credit banking is a structure that has outlived its 
time."

He's not the first to raise this recently. The Financial Services Authority 
chairman, Lord Turner, opined just last month that free accounts are loss 
leaders which encourage institutions to mis-sell loans and services to make up 
revenue.

So could we soon be paying for cashpoint withdrawals? Or facing an annual 
admin fee simply for having an account? Not likely. Much of the nation is still 
struggling with economic gloom. Banks, in contrast, are back to healthy profits 
and are swimming, once again, in six-figure bonuses.

Advisers to Varley stress that he was simply answering a question posed by the 
public – and that he is aware of how much customers value free banking. But 
Labour MP Chris Leslie isn't impressed – he says it's "quite remarkable to 
raise the spectre of charges" at a time when several of Barclays's rivals are 
yet to repay the money extended by taxpayers to rescue them from oblivion.

Americans, and many Europeans, pay for using cheque books or their cash cards. 
We haven't for a quarter of a century – and long may that tradition last.
