Battle Angel Alita <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/battle-angel-alita.html>, 
first published in 1990, tells the story of a female cyborg, called Alita, who 
is saved from a junkyard by a scientist who names her after his dead cat. She 
is rebooted with no knowledge of where she’s from or why she’s been dumped. The 
only skill she remembers is her martial arts training, which she uses to become 
a bounty hunter.

Cameron said he was “pumped” to be working with Rodriguez. “We’re already like 
two kids building a go-kart,” he said.

The director of Titanic and the first two Terminator films is still working on 
sequels to Avatar (2009), the highest-grossing film of all time. Set on a 
planet called Pandora, the franchise follows a soldier (Sam Worthington) who 
uses a computer program to transport his consciousness into an alien body. The 
next Avatar film recently had its release date pushed back to 2017. Cameron – 
who wrote the three films simultaneously –blamed the complexity of the project
