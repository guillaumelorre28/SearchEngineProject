The climbers, including British guides and their clients, had been trapped at 
camps one and two on the mountain’s Western Cwm since Saturday, when a series 
of avalanches triggered by the weekend’s powerful earthquake devastated Everest 
base camp below them, killing 18 foreign climbers and Sherpas, and injuring 61.

Although making the most of a window of fine weather, the rescue was 
complicated by the fact that the small helicopters could take only two or three 
climbers on each flight. Three helicopters flying nonstop shuttles evacuated 
all 140 mountaineers.


Canadian Nick Cienski said the climbers’ camps had been devastated by the 
avalanche, which hurled gear, people and tents hundreds of feet.

“Everything is strewn all over the glacier,” Cienski said in a video dispatch 
recorded on Monday as helicopters flew overhead. “The only thing they’ve got is 
what they land with in the helicopter, what’s in their packs,” he said of the 
rescued.

The climbers were trapped by damage to the route through the Khumbu icefall 
below camp one, a jumble of crevasses and ice cliffs which is equipped by the 
so-called Icefall Sherpas with fixed ropes and ladders every year.


Those trapped at the camps had descended to the icefall to examine the 
possibility of fixing it with ropes and other equipment dropped by helicopter 
on Sunday, but it was deemed too hazardous.

Among those ferried down the mountain was Dan Mazur, a Bristol-based guide who 
had been stuck at camp one in the Western Cwm since Saturday.

Also rescued was Alex Staniforth, a 19-year-old Briton who described being 
“emotionally trashed” after being rescued from his ascent.


Staniforth, from Chester, was at camp one when the earthquake and avalanches 
happened. In a statement, his support team said: “Alex was airlifted from camp 
one back to base camp earlier this morning. His sleeping tent was destroyed by 
the avalanche and he feels extremely lucky to be alive.

“Alex is completely devastated at the tragic loss of so many people, many whom 
he classed as friends both around Everest base camp and in the region. We are 
hoping that he can be airlifted to Kathmandu over the next 24 hours for his 
safe passage home to his family and friends.”

The evacuation got under way as one of those involved in helping organise 
treatment for injured from base camp described the scenes in the town.

Ben Ayers, country director for dZi , an aid group that works with remote 
rural communities, was in a village near Lukla for a ceremony when the 
earthquake occurred.

“I was in the area by chance and I went to Lukla and got involved in 
organising the triage for injured climbers coming down from base camp. We had a 
number of doctors and nurses volunteering,” he said.


“At about 11 in the morning a weather window opened and we started receiving 
casualties from base camp who had been flown first to Pheriche. We received 65 
injured from base camp, mostly blunt trauma injuries including broken backs. We 
assessed them and were able to send all the patients who were not able to walk 
to Kathmandu.

“We had two confirmed fatalities brought in but it was not clear if they had 
died on the flight to Lukla. We saw another two very serious injuries. There 
were a lot of Nepalese but also a lot of foreign climbers.”

Ayers added that the damage in the area where he had been before reaching 
Lukla varied by location. “There was a lot of damage in the village I was in 
but 15 minutes further towards Lukla there was another village without a broken 
window.”

Survivors on Everest described a cloud of rock and ice that smashed into base 
camp on Saturday. More than 60 people were injured, leading climbers to send 
frantic messages calling for helicopter assistance to evacuate the wounded.

Alex Gavan, a Romanian mountaineer among those still at base camp, tweeted the 
beginning of the helicopter evacuation. “Stranded climbers evacuation from 
camp1&2 continues. 3 helis fly non stop. Only 2 people per shuttle due to high 
altitude. Weather good.”

Jim Davidson, an American climber among those trapped at camp one, was one of 
the first to be evacuated and updated his Facebook page by satellite phone. 
“Weather good on Everest. Evacuation of C1 & C2 going well. I am safe in 
basecamp now … the injuries, fatalities & tragedy are heartbreaking.”
