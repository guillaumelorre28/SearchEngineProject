One of the most famous images of Winnie the Pooh is expected to fetch more 
than £100,000 at auction next month.

The illustration of the bear playing Poohsticks with Piglet and Christopher 
Robin was first published in 1928 and has been in a private collection for more 
than 40 years. But the ink drawing by EH Shepard will now be sold by Sotheby’s 
next month.

The illustration featured in AA Milne’s book The House At Pooh Corner. It 
accompanied the closing scene of Chapter 6, “in which Pooh invents a new game 
and Eeyore joins in”. The three characters stand on the Poohsticks bridge as 
the mood changes from the high excitement of their new game to a more wistful 
atmosphere.

“For a long time they looked at the river beneath them, saying nothing, and 
the river said nothing too, for it felt very quiet and peaceful on this summer 
afternoon,” Milne wrote.

The drawing will feature in Sotheby’s sale of English literature, history, 
children’s books and illustrations on 9 December and is estimated to fetch 
between £100,000 and £150,000.

The auction house said: “The illustration can be counted among the most 
familiar and most loved cultural references in English literature.”

The original wooden crossing on which the illustration is based – known as 
Posingford bridge, at Hartfield farm, East Sussex – had fallen into disrepair 
by the 1970s.

It was carefully restored and reopened in May 1979 by Christopher Milne – the 
author’s son, who inspired the character of Christopher Robin. At that 
unveiling ceremony it was described as “as important a bridge as any in the 
world”. It was completely rebuilt in 1999.
