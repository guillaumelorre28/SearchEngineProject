Poor Movie 43. It might have been an artistic, critical and commercial dud in 
every conceivable regard, but at least it could hold on to something. At least 
Movie 43 knew that it would go down in history as the worst willfully offensive 
comedy movie starring big-name actors ever to be released. Except it won't. In 
fact, it won't even go down as the worst willfully offensive comedy movie 
starring big-name actors to be released in the first three months of 2013.

Because here comes InAPPropriate Comedy. It has been written and directed by a 
man best known for appearing in late-nightcommercials 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns4mnmNBk1Y> for absorbent cloth. Its title 
contains the word "APP" in uppercase for seemingly no other reason than because 
some phones have apps on them now. It stars an Oscar winner in a role so 
comprehensively wrongheaded that logic dictates he must have been blackmailed 
into it under actual pain of death. Here's the InAPPropriate Comedy trailer, 
broken into chunks. I am sorry.
 InAPPropriate Comedy Trailer 1 
1) Obviously, like many films, InAPPropriate Comedy wanted to open its trailer 
with its splashiest moment. And here it is.Adrien Brody 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/adrien-brody>, who won the Oscar for best 
actor in 2002 for his work in The Pianist, is dressed up as Dirty Harry. But 
wait, that's not all. His catchphrase is "Go ahead, make me gay", because "gay" 
rhymes with "day" and also – get this – Brody's Dirty Harry is gay! His name is 
even Flirty Harry, because "flirty" rhymes with "dirty" and some gay people are 
considered to be rather flirty! Brilliant.

2) Also in InAPPropriate Comedy <https://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy> – 
jokes about Islamist terrorists. Because what wasn't very funny on Family Guy a 
decade ago must be hilarious now!

3) Adrien Brody isn't the only big-name star to appear in InAPPropriate 
Comedy. Rob Schneider, who must have won an Oscar for something at some point, 
is also in it.

4) And Michelle Rodriguez from Avatar. They play porn critics, because what 
could be funnier than the thought of that, right? Porn critics! What a world.

5) Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Rob Schneider and 
terrorist gags aren't funny. The only thing that makes me laugh is domestic 
violence. Is there any of that in InAPPropriate Comedy?" Well, good news – 
there is! Look, here's a woman getting flung through a wall! By a man! LOL!

6) Or maybe you prefer racism disguised as edgy social comedy. If that's the 
case, wait until you see the scene where a man tries to lure black Americans on 
to a one-way boat trip to Africa with a bucket of fried chicken. Sidesplitting 
doesn't even begin to cover it. The film also contains a Jackass spoof, 
possibly called Blackass, because the word "black" rhymes with the word "jack". 
Amazing.
 InAPPropriate Comedy Trailer 7 
7) Here's that wacky Flirty Harry character again. This time he's dancing on a 
wall in a pair of hot pink capri pants. Because he's gay, you see? Flirty Harry 
is gay. InAPPropriate Comedy can't really make this point any clearer.
 InAPPropriate Comedy Trailer 8 
8) But Adrien Brody, Michelle Rodriguez and Rob Schneider aren't the only big 
names to appear in InAPPropriate Comedy. Because, look, here's Lindsay Lohan 
shooting the paparazzi with two handguns, because the word "shoot" can mean 
"fire a gun" as well as "take a photo". Homonyms that involve the murder of 
actual human beings are probably the funniest homonyms of all. Thank youLindsay 
Lohan <https://www.theguardian.com/film/lindsay-lohan> and InAPPropriate Comedy 
for teaching us this.

9) Quick Flirty Harry update: he's now blowing on his nails in a way that 
InAPPropriate Comedy thinks that gay people do. That Flirty Harry, what's he 
like?
 InAPPropriate Comedy Trailer 10 
10) Finally, this happens. Man, those Asians sure do have funny-looking eyes! 
Why did nobody notice this before? In other news, if I have to type out 
"InAPPropriate Comedy" again, I'm going to turn to drink. LOLZ!
