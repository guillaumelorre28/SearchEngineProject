For any among you who missed Jana Bennett's performance in a special Media 
Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival edition of Britain's Got 
Talent, first of all: well done you. Second: do you want to see what you 
missed? The BBC's director of television teamed up with Dragons' Den series 
producer Sam Lewins for a unique take on 1960s group The Box Tops' song, The 
Letter. No, Monkey hadn't heard of it either. "Music to slit your wrists to," 
said judgeAmanda Holden <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/amanda-holden>
. "It was so depressing." Her judging colleague Louis Walsh was equally 
unimpressed. "I don't get the image. Have you got wigs on? You look a bit 
weird." They sounded weird as well.
