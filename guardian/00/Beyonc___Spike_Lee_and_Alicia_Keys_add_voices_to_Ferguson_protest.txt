Musicians, writers and film-makers have added their voices to the growing 
number of people speaking out after a Missouri grand jury decided to not indict 
Darren Wilson for fatally shooting teenager Michael Brown in August.

Some expressed solidarity with the protesters, while others signalled their 
disbelief and anger.

The Atlanta-based rapper Killer Mike gave a pre-show speech before a 
performance in St Louis with his groupRun the Jewels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2014/oct/31/run-the-jewels-2-elp-killer-mike-video-review>
. In a four-minute monologue he spoke about the fear he feels for his own sons, 
who are 12 and 20, as they grow up in a country where young black men are so 
frequently shot by police officers.

“I would like to say rest in peace to Michael Brown. I would like to give all 
my thoughts and prayers to the people who are out there peacefully protesting,” 
he said before mentioning his sons and saying: “These motherfuckers will not 
own tomorrow. We will not live in your fear.”

all allowed to feel right now.” She also posted a longer message on Instagram 
that ended with: “We are not Michael Browns family, but we are Michael Browns 
family. We don’t hurt like they do, but we do hurt. Hurt like hell. Thing about

when there aren’t even pieces to pick up.......and we will......again and again 
and again.”
