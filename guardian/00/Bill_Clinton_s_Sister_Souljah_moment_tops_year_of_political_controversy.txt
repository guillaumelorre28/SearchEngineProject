"If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill 
white people?" The question may have sounded rhetorical, but rapper Sister 
Souljah's inflammatory remark would prove to have both an instant and lasting 
impact.

In May 1992, the US media were already displaying a simmering displeasure with 
hip-hop following the release of the Ice-T-fronted Body Count's Cop Killer 
after the LA race riots. But whenBill Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton> compared the words of the New 
York rapper and Public Enemy associate to that of a white supremacist, racial 
tension graduated from the streets to the political classes. Was the future 
president scoring political points by condemning what many perceived to be 
black extremism? Accusations of racism were made on both sides, but with a 
general election looming Clinton's disapproval was seen as an attempt to play 
to an unsettled electorate. Thereafter, when a public figure seized an 
opportunity to confront a questionable cause, it would be referred to as their 
"Sister Souljah moment".
