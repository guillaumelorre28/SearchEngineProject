Confused.com’s claim that traffic lights would go red, white and blue if 
Britain backs Brexit, cartographersStrumpshaw, Tincleton & Giggleswick writing 
in to claim the EU wanted to ban dirty place names, and travel siteHoliday 
Extras mocking up a confusing Heathrow airport system to be installed if the UK 
votes leave. 
 * Animals, predictably, were another key theme for brands

As our April fool liveblog nears its close, it’s time to honour that other 
April fool tradition of people tweeting real and serious things are “not an 
April fool”.

China bans April Fools' Day

BRB moving to China. 

China’s state news service wrote a post on Friday, criticising tradition spoof 
news published on April Fools’s Day as ‘un-Chinese’, according to AFP.

The post on micro-blog Weibo declared: “Today is the West’s so-called ‘April 
Fools’.”

The occasion apparently “does not conform with our nation’s cultural 
traditions, nor does it conform with the core values of socialism”, it added.

“Don’t believe rumours, don’t create rumours and don’t spread rumours,” it 
said. It’s a bit of a hall of mirrors, though, because the post ended with a 
smiley emoticon.

Even the Global Times, a paper closely tied to the ruling Communist party, 
seemed to suggest Xinhua needed to loosen up, albeit on Twitter, which is not 
available in China.

Global Times (@globaltimesnews) 
#AprilFoolsDay <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AprilFoolsDay?src=hash> does not 
conform to socialist core values, says Xinhua News Agency Weibo account.

It's not easy being rich

Anti-poverty movement Live Below the Line have a new campaign to raise 
awareness of the plight of billionaires.

The fact that there are 1,810 people in this world who are not getting the 
help they deserve to continue living the way they do.

We believe all human beings deserve to live a life free of having to find ways 
to evade taxation. Do you know how long it takes to park a yacht? Do you know 
how much it costs to heat and cool mansions? Neither do we. But if the words of 
the great Biggie Smalls are true, “mo’ money, mo’ problems.”

That’s why this year, we’re doing things a little differently. Our challenge 
is simple. Instead of feeding yourself on $2 a day for 5 days, try eating on a 
budget of $10,000. Live Above the Line.

And the next stop is... Aperitif

The French public transport operator RATP, which runs the Paris Metro, has a 
jolly story about the renaming of metro stations for1er avril. 
<http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/v_149039/metro-rer-la-ratp-renomme-13-stations/>

Opéra station is now called Aperitif, Crimée is now called Crimée Châtiment in 
honour of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, amongst other puns that 
may only make sense to French speakers.

Note for fact fans, the French celebrate with a holiday called “Poisson 
d’Avril” ie April fish, not April fools. It involves French children sneakily 
sticking coloured paper fish on the backs of adults and running away.

WaterAid launches 'manpons'

WaterAid had a really rather good advert last year called “If Men had periods” 
and for April Fools’ Day, they’ve had satirical adverts posted in 375 different 
shopping centres for “Manpons”. Here’s to April Fools’ Day pranks with a proper 
message about access to sanitation for women and girls and taboos around 
menstruation.

Airbnb – but for universities

‘Airbnb for academia’ plan to inject pro-market ethos into sector 
<https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/airbnb-academia-plan-inject-pro-market-ethos-sector>

“Some professors’ offices are huge, so you could easily get a couple of IKEA 
bunk beds in the corner without too much difficulty,” said Don Believeit, 
professor of tourism studies at Bulgaria’sIvor Binhad

BRB moving to China. 

China’s state news service wrote a post on Friday, criticising tradition spoof 
news published on April Fools’s Day as ‘un-Chinese’, according to AFP.

The post on micro-blog Weibo declared: “Today is the West’s so-called ‘April 
Fools’.”

The occasion apparently “does not conform with our nation’s cultural 
traditions, nor does it conform with the core values of socialism”, it added.

“Don’t believe rumours, don’t create rumours and don’t spread rumours,” it 
said. It’s a bit of a hall of mirrors, though, because the post ended with a 
smiley emoticon.

Even the Global Times, a paper closely tied to the ruling Communist party, 
seemed to suggest Xinhua needed to loosen up, albeit on Twitter, which is not 
available in China.

Global Times (@globaltimesnews) 
#AprilFoolsDay <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AprilFoolsDay?src=hash> does not 
conform to socialist core values, says Xinhua News Agency Weibo account.

Anti-poverty movement Live Below the Line have a new campaign to raise 
awareness of the plight of billionaires.

The fact that there are 1,810 people in this world who are not getting the 
help they deserve to continue living the way they do.

We believe all human beings deserve to live a life free of having to find ways 
to evade taxation. Do you know how long it takes to park a yacht? Do you know 
how much it costs to heat and cool mansions? Neither do we. But if the words of 
the great Biggie Smalls are true, “mo’ money, mo’ problems.”

That’s why this year, we’re doing things a little differently. Our challenge 
is simple. Instead of feeding yourself on $2 a day for 5 days, try eating on a 
budget of $10,000. Live Above the Line.
 
The French public transport operator RATP, which runs the Paris Metro, has a 
jolly story about the renaming of metro stations for1er avril. 
<http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/v_149039/metro-rer-la-ratp-renomme-13-stations/>

Opéra station is now called Aperitif, Crimée is now called Crimée Châtiment in 
honour of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, amongst other puns that 
may only make sense to French speakers.

Note for fact fans, the French celebrate with a holiday called “Poisson 
d’Avril” ie April fish, not April fools. It involves French children sneakily 
sticking coloured paper fish on the backs of adults and running away.
 
Google’s April Fools’ Day prank has backfired, leaving the company looking the
