You've probably already heard about Alfie Allen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alfie-allen>, 20. His sister Lily Allen 
wrote the song 'Alfie' about him, accusing him of laziness, among other things. 
'I do get out of bed late sometimes, but I was getting a snowboarding 
qualification in Canada when she wrote it. The lyrics are very funny though. 
Not many people can claim they've been immortalised in song.'

He plays a servant in Joe Wright's Atonement. 'It was the first time I sat 
down with a director and properly worked through my character. There was a 
great family feel on set.'

Alfie's mother is film producer Alison Owen, his father actor and comedian 
Keith Allen. But he wasn't coerced into the family business. 'I don't feel 
under any pressure,' he maintains. 'I'm acting because I love it, and it's fine 
by me if I don't become famous like Lily. There's no competition between us 
whatsoever. I'm so proud of her it's unreal.'

Alfie also has roles in Stephen Poliakoff's drama Joe's Palace and film 
Flashbacks of a Fool with Daniel Craig. He's now in Liverpool shooting BBC 
series Casualty 1907, in which he plays a '15-year-old alcoholic gang leader'. 
After that, Alfie, who was brought up in north London, wants to do 'something 
urban and London based, a bit more relevant to me'.

Â·  Atonement is out now. Joe's Palace will be shown on BBC1 later this month
