The first major televised debate of the EU referendum has concluded in front 
of an audience in front of a young voters in Glasgow.

• The prospect of another Scottish independence referendum being triggered by 
a Brexit was raised by the former SNP leader,Alex Salmond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond>, who said that it would take 
place within the two year period of the UK negotiating for withdrawal from the 
EU.

“In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of 
the EU against their will I think the result would be yes this time,” he said.

“If you have the situation where, in four weeks time, Scotland voters remain 
and the rest of the UK, or England, drags Scotland out by voting to leave then 
that would justify in my opinion another referendum because during the 
referendum in 2014 the people of Scotland were told that voting no would secure 
Scotland’s position within theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”

• The Ukip MEP Diane James <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-james> 
told the debate that “we don’t know” if visas would be needed to travel to the 
EU in the event of a Brexit.

Both James and the Tory MP, Liam Fox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox>, appearing for the Leave side, 
focused heavily on immigration in their answers, telling the audience that 
leaving the EU would be the only way of alleviating pressure on public services 
and housing.

Describing the EU as a “political construct”, Fox also said that trade and 
tourism withEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> existed 
before the EU and would continue afterwards.

• The NHS once again loomed in the referendum debate. Alan Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson> said that the health service 
would suffer if the UK left the EU and caused the British economy to shrink.

More spending was needed on health, he argued, rather than departing from a 
bloc in which other members spent more on health.

James made the case for Brexit on the basis that it would potentially make it 
easier for the UK to bring in more Commonwealth doctors from New Zealand, 
Australia and Canada “who speak our language”.

There was at least one vaguely happy viewer it seems, judging from this tweet: 
Lee-Ann Galvin (@Rokincow) 
One thing I do like about this debate is the immediate feedback on whether the 
question was even answered. Usually it's not.#BBCDebate

It’s over. As political debates of this type go that was a fairly heated one, 
with perhaps more audience participation than usual.

At first glance, the political panel didn’t commit any gaffes. But neither did 
they land any significant blows. I’ll post a summary shortly.

And that, it seems, is that. Derbyshire takes a show of hands to see if the 
undecided voters in the audience have made up their minds. About half go up.

A young woman says she wants to stay, telling Derbyshire that the arguments 
about the loss of jobs swayed her.

A young man, who has now decided to vote for Brexit, says that the Remain camp 
has not given any idea of what type of reforms are needed in the EU.

Johnson says that if the UK’s economy shrinks then the NHS would suffer. It’s 
about spending, he argues, adding that funding for the NHS needs to be at the 
EU average.

“In Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> they spend about 9% 
of spending on health. We used to be at that but we have gone back to 6%.”

A student nurse, Dawn, wants to know what advantages there would be to the NHS 
about leaving the EU.

Diane James <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-james> comes in with – 
guess what? – a point linked to immigration: “I might seem like I’m repeating 
myself.”

“I would far rather see people like yourself go through the nurse training 
programme and come here,” James tells Dawn. She wants the UK to be able to go 
to other countries – Commonwealth ones – with which it has a good relationship 
and whose skill base it can trust.

Liam Fox <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox> says he doesn’t 
understand what the SNP didn’t understand about their defeat in the Scottish 
poll. The issue is another case of “fear-based” campaigning, according to the 
MP.

Elina Leslie from Dundee asks: if Scotland voted one way and the rest of 
Britain voted the other way would it lead to another “unwanted” referendum on 
Scottish independence?

By definition it wouldn’t be unwanted, according to Salmond, who cites Nicola 
Sturgeon’s view last year that if Scotland was “dragged” out of the EU against 
its own will then that would provide a democratic mandate for a new poll.

Ok, but when? “It would have to be within the two-year period of the UK 
negotiating withdrawal from the EU,” Salmond says.

“If Scotland votes Remain and the rest of the UK votes [Leave] then that in my 
mind would justify another referendum.”

Alan Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson> takes on the 
Leave argument that travel arrangements would not change for UK citizens in the 
event of a Brexit.

It could mean the return of watchtowers along the border between Northern 
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he says.

An audience member says he has been thinking about this too and asks what the 
Leave side have to say about Johnson’s point.

Fox says there have always been bilateral arrangements between the UK and the 
Republic of Ireland: “Why would that change?”

On this same issue, here’s some coverage recently from across the Irish border 
and how the referendum campaign is being received there:

Two more questions from the audience now – both linked to travel:

 * If we were to leave the EU how difficult would it be to travel in the EU in 
future?

 * What will we lose and gain in terms of travel and international obligations 
if we leave the EU?

There is a world out there outside of the EU, says Fox, who adds that he and 
his family used to have holidays inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> before the union came along.


“The idea that because we are not in the EU that you are not going to be able 
to have a holiday in Majorca is just...” he says, before Derbyshire says that 
no one is suggesting that.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-james>, who says that qualified 
doctors in Commonwealth countries are being denied entry to the UK.

“Why not have someone from the Commonwealth who speaks our language?” she says.


To cheers from Remain supporters in the audience, Salmond comes in with: “If I 
wanted a qualified doctor then a qualified Lithuanian, Danish, French one would 
do just now.”

Have the two sides been scaremongering? 

Yes, says a woman in the audience who supports Brexit but dislikes the 
messages from her own ‘side’: “Some of the noise that we have heard about 
immigration and how awful it is if we stay.”

“I do want to leave and I think it would be better if we leave.”

However, she wants to ask the Remain side if David Cameron really believes “it 
will be world war three if we leave then why are we even risking a referendum?”

An audience member from the Remain side says that a massive majority of people 
are not going to turn out because of the poor quality of the debate.

Salmond says that there are four weeks to go in the campaign and the Remain 
side really needs to engage people with positivity: “Leave the scaremongering 
behind and argue a positive case.”

But project fear won, says Derbyshire. “It works. You lost.”

Cue a short segue into the Scottish referendum’s twists and turns.

It’s livening up a bit now. “Hang on ... I know you have no interest in the 
facts,” saysAlan Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson>, in 
a comment that appears to have been directed at Liam Fox.

Fox wants to move things back to the issue of immigration: “When you have an 
uncontrolled figure then unavoidably put pressure on services. It’s for us in 
our own country to decide that number.”

Emily Wood, a music producer from Poole has the third question. She says her 
disabled mum needs a bungalow but that immigrants are “bumped up the list”. Is 
she right to want to leave?

Salmond: “I wouldn’t make that connection. If we have a housing crisis we 
should build more housing.”

He ventures the scenario of Boris Johnson dislocating his jaw from overuse 
(laughs from audience). The Tory MP wouldn’t turn away help from doctors who 
had migrated here, he says.

Emily Wood isn’t happy, saying that she didn’t claim that migrants were not 
happy: “You have not got enough houses now ... so where are you going to put 
them?

It then kicks off a little bit between Wood and Asma, another audience member 
who gets a “waheey” from Salmond when she says that she is from Aberdeen.

“When it comes to housing, it is because of the EU that we have certain 
regulations that allow us to have spacious rooms,” says Asma, who also cites 
the contribution of her own parents who she says immigrated into the UK.

The first major televised debate of the EU referendum has concluded in front 
of an audience in front of a young voters in Glasgow.

• The prospect of another Scottish independence referendum being triggered by 
a Brexit was raised by the former SNP leader,Alex Salmond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond>, who said that it would take 
place within the two year period of the UK negotiating for withdrawal from the 
EU.

“In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of 
the EU against their will I think the result would be yes this time,” he said.

“If you have the situation where, in four weeks time, Scotland voters remain 
and the rest of the UK, or England, drags Scotland out by voting to leave then 
that would justify in my opinion another referendum because during the 
referendum in 2014 the people of Scotland were told that voting no would secure 
Scotland’s position within theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”

• The Ukip MEP Diane James <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-james> 
told the debate that “we don’t know” if visas would be needed to travel to the 
EU in the event of a Brexit.

Both James and the Tory MP, Liam Fox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox>, appearing for the Leave side, 
focused heavily on immigration in their answers, telling the audience that 
leaving the EU would be the only way of alleviating pressure on public services 
and housing.

Describing the EU as a “political construct”, Fox also said that trade and 
tourism withEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> existed 
before the EU and would continue afterwards.

• The NHS once again loomed in the referendum debate. Alan Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson> said that the health service 
would suffer if the UK left the EU and caused the British economy to shrink.

More spending was needed on health, he argued, rather than departing from a 
bloc in which other members spent more on health.

James made the case for Brexit on the basis that it would potentially make it 
easier for the UK to bring in more Commonwealth doctors from New Zealand, 
Australia and Canada “who speak our language”.

 
There was at least one vaguely happy viewer it seems, judging from this tweet: 
Lee-Ann Galvin (@Rokincow) 
One thing I do like about this debate is the immediate feedback on whether the 
question was even answered. Usually it's not.#BBCDebate

<https://twitter.com/Rokincow/status/735923029407084544>  
It’s over. As political debates of this type go that was a fairly heated one, 
with perhaps more audience participation than usual.

At first glance, the political panel didn’t commit any gaffes. But neither did 
they land any significant blows. I’ll post a summary shortly.
 
And that, it seems, is that. Derbyshire takes a show of hands to see if the 
undecided voters in the audience have made up their minds. About half go up.

A young woman says she wants to stay, telling Derbyshire that the arguments 
about the loss of jobs swayed her.

A young man, who has now decided to vote for Brexit, says that the Remain camp 
has not given any idea of what type of reforms are needed in the EU.
 
Johnson says that if the UK’s economy shrinks then the NHS would suffer. It’s 
about spending, he argues, adding that funding for the NHS needs to be at the 
EU average.

“In Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> they spend about 9% 
of spending on health. We used to be at that but we have gone back to 6%.”
 
A student nurse, Dawn, wants to know what advantages there would be to the NHS 
about leaving the EU.

Diane James <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-james> comes in with – 
guess what? – a point linked to immigration: “I might seem like I’m repeating 
myself.”

“I would far rather see people like yourself go through the nurse training 
programme and come here,” James tells Dawn. She wants the UK to be able to go 
to other countries – Commonwealth ones – with which it has a good relationship 
and whose skill base it can trust.
 
Liam Fox <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox> says he doesn’t 
understand what the SNP didn’t understand about their defeat in the Scottish 
poll. The issue is another case of “fear-based” campaigning, according to the 
MP.
 
Elina Leslie from Dundee asks: if Scotland voted one way and the rest of 
Britain voted the other way would it lead to another “unwanted” referendum on 
Scottish independence?

By definition it wouldn’t be unwanted, according to Salmond, who cites Nicola 
Sturgeon’s view last year that if Scotland was “dragged” out of the EU against 
its own will then that would provide a democratic mandate for a new poll.

Ok, but when? “It would have to be within the two-year period of the UK 
negotiating withdrawal from the EU,” Salmond says.

“If Scotland votes Remain and the rest of the UK votes [Leave] then that in my 
mind would justify another referendum.”
 
It seems like Liam Fox <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox> is 
tweeting (or is someone in control of his iPhone) from inside the debate. He’s 
just retweeted this:

Alan Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson> takes on the 
Leave argument that travel arrangements would not change for UK citizens in the 
event of a Brexit.

It could mean the return of watchtowers along the border between Northern 
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he says.

An audience member says he has been thinking about this too and asks what the 
Leave side have to say about Johnson’s point.

Fox says there have always been bilateral arrangements between the UK and the 
Republic of Ireland: “Why would that change?”

On this same issue, here’s some coverage recently from across the Irish border 
and how the referendum campaign is being received there:

As debates go, this is a fairly boisterous one, perhaps even bad-tempered? The 
Guardian’s Heather Stewart picks up on this exchange between audience members 
earlier:

Two more questions from the audience now – both linked to travel:

 * If we were to leave the EU how difficult would it be to travel in the EU in 
future?

 * What will we lose and gain in terms of travel and international obligations 
if we leave the EU?

There is a world out there outside of the EU, says Fox, who adds that he and 
his family used to have holidays inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> before the union came along.


“The idea that because we are not in the EU that you are not going to be able 
to have a holiday in Majorca is just...” he says, before Derbyshire says that 
no one is suggesting that.

Back to immigration again, courtesy of Diane James 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-james>, who says that qualified 
doctors in Commonwealth countries are being denied entry to the UK.

“Why not have someone from the Commonwealth who speaks our language?” she says.


To cheers from Remain supporters in the audience, Salmond comes in with: “If I 
wanted a qualified doctor then a qualified Lithuanian, Danish, French one would 
do just now.”

Have the two sides been scaremongering? 

Yes, says a woman in the audience who supports Brexit but dislikes the 
messages from her own ‘side’: “Some of the noise that we have heard about 
immigration and how awful it is if we stay.”

“I do want to leave and I think it would be better if we leave.”

However, she wants to ask the Remain side if David Cameron really believes “it 
will be world war three if we leave then why are we even risking a referendum?”

An audience member from the Remain side says that a massive majority of people 
are not going to turn out because of the poor quality of the debate.
 
Salmond says that there are four weeks to go in the campaign and the Remain 
side really needs to engage people with positivity: “Leave the scaremongering 
behind and argue a positive case.”

But project fear won, says Derbyshire. “It works. You lost.”

Cue a short segue into the Scottish referendum’s twists and turns.

It’s livening up a bit now. “Hang on ... I know you have no interest in the 
facts,” saysAlan Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanjohnson>, in 
a comment that appears to have been directed at Liam Fox.

Fox wants to move things back to the issue of immigration: “When you have an 
uncontrolled figure then unavoidably put pressure on services. It’s for us in 
our own country to decide that number.”
 
Emily Wood, a music producer from Poole has the third question. She says her 
disabled mum needs a bungalow but that immigrants are “bumped up the list”. Is 
she right to want to leave?

It then kicks off a little bit between Wood and Asma, another audience member
