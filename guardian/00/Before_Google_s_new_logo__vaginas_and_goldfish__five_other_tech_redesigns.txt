Google, the company now owned by Alphabet, (do keep up) has unveiled a new logo
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/01/google-logo-history-new-doodle-redesign>
, replacing probably the best known tech branding in the world. The new logo, 
in a typeface cheekily (but accurately) titled “product sans” is thought to be 
cleaner and easier to read but also – crucially – quicker to load.

This isn’t the first time Google has played around with its logo, previous 
changes include the time the companyaltered the kerning 
<http://gizmodo.com/google-changed-its-logo-this-weekend-and-you-didnt-even-1582005359>
 (positioning of the letters), shifting the “g” and “l” letters by a single 
pixel each (see below).

Tech companies seem to like tinkering, frequently. Here’s five other distinct 
redesigns:

The rental website and app hit the headlines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jul/18/balls-vagina-both-airbnb-logo-internet-parodies>
 in July 2014 with its redesigned logo, which it named the Bélo. Air BnB called 
the logo “the universal symbol of belonging”, but to everybody else it looked 
like the universal symbol of vaginas. Online media, however, love things that 
look like vaginas –canoes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/15/vagina-selfie-for-3d-printers-lands-japanese-artist-in-trouble>
,football stadia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/18/qatar-accidental-vagina-stadium-al-wakrah-world-cup-stadium>
 – so the new logo racked upa lot of publicity. 

It quickly became the butt of jokes and memes 
<http://digiday.com/brands/10-best-reactions-airbnbs-revamped-logo/>, and 
people also pointed out it was very similar to the logo of tech firmAutomation 
Anywhere <https://www.automationanywhere.com/>.

Yahoo

Yahoo’s original logo <http://logos.wikia.com/wiki/Yahoo!> was literally just 
the word “Yahoo” in Times New Roman font. It wasn’t exactly grabbing. Later 
iterations just resembled awkward ClipArt, so it was about time for a lick of 
paint when the Yahoo logo wasredesigned 
<http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/05/tech/web/new-yahoo-logo/> in 2013. Chief 
executiveMarissa Mayer <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/marissa-mayer>, 
along with an intern, designed the new branding over a single weekend, 
describing it as “whimsical, yet sophisticated”.

“I’m not a pro, but I know enough to be dangerous”, Mayer said 
<http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/5/4696274/yahoo-reveals-its-new-logo>, of her 
Adobe Illustrator skills. Total badass.

 Various iterations of Yahoo!’s logo. The most recent is the purple one.

Microsoft’s first logo 
<http://www.jempp.com.au/images/improveyourlogo_clip_image008.gif> was so 70s, 
which was appropriate, given that Microsoft began life in 1975. Still one of 
the coolest tech logos, it had an arcade feel about it. One of the later and 
most loved logos, introduced in 1984, featured anitalicised typeface, and was 
familiar to PC users for almost a quarter of a century (see below).

The current Microsoft logo, rendered in the Segoe typeface and which came into 
being in 2012, is completely dull. But that hasn’t stopped the companyissuing 
guidelines 
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/logo.aspx>
 on how to use it.

AOL

AOL, or America Online, to give the company its full title, has had many logos 
over the years. There’s even been a version consisting of the Brazilian flag. 
The current branding however was introduced in 2009. Aseries of logos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/nov/23/aol-digital-media-new-brand-logo>
 features photos of a goldfish, a cassette type, an astronaut and a bunch of 
scribble. The designer,Wolff Olins 
<http://www.wolffolins.com/work/47/london-2012>, is also the man responsible 
for theLondon 2012 Olympic games logo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/jun/05/howlisasimpsontooktheolym>
. The less said about that the better.

The current AOL logo is set in a typeface similar to Futura, and without the 
brand’s olderplay button

 or triangle element.

In contrast to its parent company, Microsoft, the Windows operating systems 
package is constantly changing. Apparently, Windows has gone through more logos 
in the past 20 years than any other tech product, but the flying window, 
properly introduced in Windows 3.1, has remained consistent in the designs. You 
can see all of the past Windows logo designs (pre-Windows 10)here 
<http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2012/02/17/redesigning-the-windows-logo/>
.

The current logo, which was unveiled in September 2014 ahead of the summer 
2015 release of Windows 10 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/29/windows-10-launched-quietly-microsoft>
, follows on from the Windows 8 iteration. It’s less interesting, but I guess 
blue is the warmest colour.
 Windows 10, which is all blue unlike more colourful, earlier versions.
