Ofcom today imposed an £80,000 fine for irregularities in ITV1's British 
Comedy Awards, which included producers ignoring a premium rate phone vote to 
give an award to presentersAnt and Dec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ant-and-dec> that should have gone to 
Catherine Tate.

The media regulator fined the tiny Jersey-based ITV franchisee Channel TV, 
which had been responsible for compliance issues on the awards ceremony, after 
viewers had been encouraged to continue voting for the people's choice awards 
in 2004 and 2005, despite the winners having already been decided.

The winner of the 2005 award was also switched from Tate – who had polled the 
most votes – in favour of Ant and Dec.

Despite an investigation, Ofcom <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom> said 
it was no closer to knowing why it had occurred, saying it was "frustrated" by 
the lack of co-operation it had received.

Channel TV called for the police to be brought in, saying that it appeared to 
"have been a criminal conspiracy to defraud". Ofcom found that in both 2004 and 
2005 the public vote for the people's choice award was decided early, as the 
final 30 minutes of both shows were pre-recorded and broadcast after the ITV 
News at 10.30pm. However, viewers continued to be told to ring premium-rate 
phone lines to vote. Ofcom said the breaches were "entirely foreseeable and 
were serious, reckless and repeated".

Ofcom criticised Channel TV's procedures as "absent or totally insufficient 
and ineffective". Channel TV apologised for the "entirely unintentional but 
nonetheless stupid" voting breaches, but called for Ofcom to bring in the 
police to investigate the switching of the people's choice award winner.

The fine was the last major ruling from the spate of television fakery 
scandals that hit the industry in recent years, which affected everything from 
GMTV to Blue Peter.
