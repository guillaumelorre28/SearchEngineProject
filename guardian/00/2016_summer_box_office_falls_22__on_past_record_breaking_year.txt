“No matter how you slice or dice the calendar, there is no question that the 
summer of 2016 thus far has been a bit of a bummer, with the underperformers 
outnumbering the overperformers, and a general malaise that has struck the 
early part of this most important movie-going season,”comScore 
<http://www.comscore.com/> box-office analyst Paul Dergarabedian told the 
Hollywood Reporter.

He went on to blame failing sequels for the slump, a theory that was put 
forward by commentators from the main trade papers last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/08/will-finding-dory-buck-hollywood-summer-of-sequel-discontent>

 andThe Huntsman: Winter’s War

 posted opening weekend takes equal to their source material, suggesting the 
industry’s bout of “sequelitus” wasnot as severe as some had feared
