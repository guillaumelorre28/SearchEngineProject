The Ashes urn sat, as ever, in the Lord's museum yesterday but perhaps it was 
shifting more uneasily than usual. For the first time an England captain has 
recommended that Australia be allowed to take the Ashes home for real.

"That is what we are playing for," said Nasser Hussain. "In this modern age it 
should be possible to transport it without too much risk."

The MCC, custodians of the urn for 80 years, reiterated their polite refusal. 
Roger Knight, the chief executive, was not around but his stock reply was 
immediately available on database.

"The Ashes urn is very old and extremely delicate," said Knight. "We wouldn't 
be forgiven if anything happened to it."

Originally the minuscule pot was presented to the Hon Ivo Bligh, the England 
captain, in 1883 by a Melbourne society lady, Florence Morphy. Love blossomed 
and on Bligh's death more than 40 years later his widow asked the MCC to keep 
it safe in perpetuity.

"I'm hardly likely to leave it on the plane," said Australia's captain Steve 
Waugh. "If you can't touch it, what's the point of playing for it?"

The answer, of course, is tradition, but that goes only so far these days. 
Everybody wants the real thing. After all, the world's most successful soft 
drinks maker would never have made it with the slogan: "Coca-Cola - it's the 
concept."
