Wales's amazing youngsters grew up to claim their first away win in this Group 
Four qualifier. John Toshack had been shorn of 10 senior players for this long 
trip to the shores of the Caspian Sea and he must have had doubts that his 
bunch of raw youngsters could handle an occasion like this.

The Wolves midfielder David Edwards scored what proved to be the winner in the 
first half and from then on he and his team-mates battled for every inch to 
produce a victory. There were only 79 Wales fans in this stadium and, having 
had their tickets given to them free by the Football Association ofWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales>, they must have loved every minute.

Toshack said: "There was so much to be satisfied with. Considering the 
problems we have had building up to this game, it was a very pleasing 
performance and result.

"We were missing so many players and some of the lads who played have been out 
of training virtually for five weeks. There are a lot of better sides than us 
who have had a lot of trouble in Baku.

"We had a small handful of fans here who had paid a lot of money to follow us, 
and they deserved a result like this. I was more than happy to celebrate with 
them at the end. The team have done them proud."
