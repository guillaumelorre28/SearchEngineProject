Siri has begun to differentiate between iPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> owners who subscribe to Apple’s 
music streaming service and those who do not.

Apple Music launched in June 2015 with a free trial, which is now coming to an 
end. So far,6.5 million people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/20/apple-music-people-paid-streaming-service>
 have paid for their first month of the streaming service, but those who choose 
not to pay to continue may see some differences in the way Siri answers their 
questions.

I guess Siri won't talk to you about music unless you pay her boss?

I am not a subscriber to Apple Music, and when I asked Siri: “What is the most 
popular song in the US today?” she replied: “Sorry, Blackhawk, I can’t look up 
the music charts for you. You don’t seem to be subscribed toApple Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple-music>.”

I have no idea why Siri called me Blackhawk, but I received the exact same 
answer when I asked her about the top album in the US today.


When I asked Siri about the most popular song in the US today on the phone of 
a colleague who does subscribe toApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> Music, I got a different 
response, although it was no more informative: “Sorry, I don’t know what topped 
the charts on that date.”

When I dropped the word “today” from my question on my phone, Siri became a 
little more helpful.


In response to the question: “What is the most popular song in the US?” Siri 
opened the iTunes store on my phone to show me that Adele’s Hello is currently 
topping charts, followed by Justin Bieber’s Sorry and Drake’s Hotline Bling.


When I asked Siri the same question on my colleague’s phone, she responded by 
automatically playing Hotline Bling. A second try resulted in Working for It, 
by ZHU, Skrillex and THEY, which currently ranks at No 40 in iTunes’ top 100 
songs.


Apple Music is currently the second most popular music subscription service, 
behind Spotify, which has reached about20 million subscribers

.


Apple did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.
