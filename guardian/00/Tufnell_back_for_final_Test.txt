There was an unmistakeable sense that English cricket was suddenly back in 
partying mood last night: Phil Tufnell, persistent scourge of administrators, 
regular bane of captains and occasional Test match-winning bowler, was recalled 
to England's squad.

England's plans for Thursday's final Test at the Oval have been disrupted by 
injuries to Alan Mullally, who has been omitted from the 14-man squad, and Alex 
Tudor, who is named despite a hip problem. Leicestershire's Jimmy Ormond 
strengthens England's pace bowling resources and Robert Croft is also included.
