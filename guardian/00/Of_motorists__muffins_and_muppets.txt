If £600m will provide 100 extra free schools (More free schools, 40,000 extra 
places and nursery help 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/29/autumn-statement-free-nursery-education>
, 30 November), how many extra free schools would be provided if the £2bn the 
MoD plans to spend at Aldermaston ahead of the Trident renewal decision were to 
be spent on schools instead (MoD spends £2bn on new nuclear arms plants

• Britain's struggling motorists (£6bn to be spent on road building and rail 
projects 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/29/george-osborne-autumn-statments-transport-projects>
, 30 November) can be thankful that their plight has at last been recognised. 
Some had thought that they might be forced to splash out on a more economical 
car; others, more desperate still, to use public transport. But now, until 
August, they can turn fossil fuel into carbon as before, while the deficit 
rises by a mere £1bn.

• I note that the chancellor says that every household will "save £144 on 
petrol costs this year". This is good news indeed, but surely he has missed a 
trick. Since this "saving" is a result of announcing and then cancelling a 3p 
per litre price rise on petrol, why didn't he announce a £1 per litre rise, 
say, and cancel it? Then every household could "save" £4,800 this year.

• On the day the chancellor tells us we're going to have to work longer, it is 
reported thatDurham crematorium is considering generating power, and hence 
income, from its three furnaces 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/8917633/A-dead-heat-crematorium-to-sell-power-for-National-Grid.html>
. So we are not only going to have to work longer but, as a parting gesture, to 
put something back into the economy as well.

• Clare may have spent her strike day watching series one of The Killing on 
DVD (Clare in the Community 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/series/clareinthecommunity>, 30 November), 
but the social worker who lives here left for the picket line at 7am. In any 
case, the series one box set has been available for weeks, and true aficionados 
would have finished watching it in time for series two, which started on BBC4 
two weeks ago. On both counts, Clare, shame.

• Surely John Ellis must realise that Kermit & co would have done a better job 
than Cameron & co (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/nov/29/untidy-sums-local-government-pensions>
, 30 November). The Count would make a great chancellor of the exchequer.

• I was saddened to read of the closure of McDonald's in Rochdale (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/25/mcdonalds-quits-rochdale-town-centre?INTCMP=SRCH>
, 26 November). Is this another nail in George Osborne's economic muffin?
