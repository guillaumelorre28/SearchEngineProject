The Topshop Unique show always gives good front row, and on Sunday the vibe 
was decidedly regal. There was actual royalty (well, almost) in the shape of 
Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, who was flanked by two pillars of 
fashion royalty:Anna Wintour <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour> 
and Alexa Chung. And next to Topshop’s head honcho, Phil Green, sat RnB 
royalty, Ciara. All the outfits were strong, but Chung’s French blue jumpsuit 
was the perfect London fashion week outfit - relaxed and comfy but plenty chic. 
Third day in, third major look from Chung. We curtsey to her style prowess.
