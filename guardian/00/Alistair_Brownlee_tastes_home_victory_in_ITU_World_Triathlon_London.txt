Great Britain’s Alistair Brownlee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alistair-brownlee> recorded his second win 
of the season as he triumphed on home soil at the 2015 ITU World Triathlon 
London on Sunday.

The 27-year-old Olympic, European and Commonwealth champion captured a 
breakaway win with a familiar crowd cheering him on in Hyde Park as he crossed 
the finish line in 50 minutes and 39 seconds.

Brownlee, who was denied victory in Yokohama two weeks ago when he was pipped 
to the line by Javier Gomez, came home 12 seconds ahead of Spain’s Fernando 
Alarza in second and Vincent Luis of France, who clinched bronze.

South African Henri Schoeman and Richard Varga of Slovakia led the 
750-kilometre swim and into the first transition before Alistair’s younger 
brother Jonny suffered a mechanical problem on the bike and dropped down the 
field to eventually finish 42nd - just short of two minutes off the pace.

Alistair Brownlee took the lead in the four-lap bike around Hyde Park 
alongside Luis and Australia’s Aaron Royle in an 18-man pack before he and the 
Frenchman continued on their quest for a podium finish, with the Brit stepping 
up the pace on the first of the two run laps to seal victory.

“Some of the guys went really quick during the first kilometre of the run,” 
Brownlee told BBC Sport.

“I then got into my stride and felt really good. I was glad to be able to race 
to the best of my ability. I haven’t done that for a while.”

Despite his absence, the Spaniard Javier Gomez Noya maintained his Columbia 
Threadneedle leader position in the rankings ahead of his compatriots Mario 
Mola and Alarza, with South Africa’s Richard Murray fourth and Alistair 
Brownlee holding fifth position two spots ahead of his brother Jonny.
