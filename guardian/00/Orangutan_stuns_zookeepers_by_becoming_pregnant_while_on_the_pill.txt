A Sumatran orangutan at Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> zoo has fallen pregnant, 
despite being on contraceptives.

Karta the 34-year-old orangutan is due early in 2017. Jodie Ellen, a senior 
primate keeper, announced the “exciting but nerve-wracking” news onthe zoo’s 
Facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/AdelaideZoo/videos/1491918484169585/>. 
“It wasn’t a planned pregnancy,” she said. “Mother Nature actually intervened.”

Karta has lost six infants since 1995. Most recently, in 2014, she gave birth 
to a stillborn. The zoo said it was going ahead with the pregnancy because 
Sumatran orangutans are critically endangered. “We are doing everything we can 
in our power to support her in this pregnancy,” Ellen said.

Cameras have been installed to monitor Karta during the lead-up to the birth, 
and the zoo was prepared to train her to breastfeed, which she has struggled 
with in the past.

“It’s a very stressful time for all of us,” Ellen said. “We all desperately 
want this to be a positive outcome, and we all hope for the best.”

It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 orangutans left in the 
rainforests in Sumatra, Indonesia, and that population continues to decline by 
as many as 1,000 a year. The greatest threat to the species is habitat loss.

Karta was born in July 1982 at San Diego Zoo and arrived in Adelaide in 
November 1992. The zoodescribes her 
<https://www.adelaidezoo.com.au/animals/sumatran-orangutan/> as a “strong and 
independent, 21st-century woman”. She is one of its three Sumatran Orangutans.
