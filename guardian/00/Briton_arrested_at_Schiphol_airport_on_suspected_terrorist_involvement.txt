A British man has been arrested at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on suspicion 
of possible involvement in terrorism, Dutch authorities said today.

The man, of Somali origin, was held after flying in from Liverpool en route to 
Entebbe inUganda <https://www.theguardian.com/world/uganda>. He was detained by 
Dutch military police while sitting on an aircraft that was ready to depart.

The arrest followed a tip-off from UK authorities. The man is suspected of 
possible involvement with an unspecified foreign terrorist organisation.

Security at the airport was beefed up this year after the abortive Christmas 
Day terrorism attack

 involving Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a British-educated Nigerian. He attempted 
to detonate explosives in his underwear shortly before his flight from Schiphol 
to Detroit landed, before being tackled by passengers and crew.

The apparent plot led to plans for many airports, including in the UK, to 
install full body image scanners to detect concealed explosives.

Last month, two Yemeni men were arrested at Schiphol

 after flying in from Chicago, on suspicion they may have been conducting a dry 
run for an airline terror attack. The two were held for several days then 
released without charge after an investigation turned up no evidence to link 
them to a terror plot.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said she was aware of today's arrest and was 
seeking more information.
