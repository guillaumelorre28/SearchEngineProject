With the club's perilous financial state causing growing concern and with 
players still not paid their April wages, it was announced that Aldershot have 
entered administration â€“ bringing back dark memories of their past.

Quantuma Restructuring has been appointed as joint administrators and released 
a short statement: "At 10.05am today Carl Stuart Jackson and Paul Anthony
