Hi, Jennifer! How would you characterise your past year?
I would characterise it as: a hell of a year.

What accounts for this comeback you’ve had (1)? Was it a change of management 
or just good fortune?
I am well over 40. I feel like the door was closed, and I had made my peace 
with it and I was fine. I worried a little bit about money. “Am I going to work 
again … Maybe I’ll go more into writing.” But I’m very happy being a mom. I 
just thought I had a great run and that’s that.Anomalisa we voiced two years ago

Jennifer Jason Leigh: ‘I've been at this precipice so many times'

We did that two years ago, they lost the financing; or not “lost”: they ran 
out of money. I didn’t know if the movie was ever going to be completed. 
Charlie [Kaufman] didn’t know. To have that and then gettingThe Hateful Eight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hateful-eight> was beyond surreal.

That shouldn’t be surreal for someone like you. Sure, Tarantino’s great, but 
you’ve worked with the Coen brothers, David Cronenberg - the list goes on …
Thank you, I appreciate that, but a lot of times, this town, or this business, 
really only looks at your last three projects. Quentin is the exception to 
that. He looks at your whole body of work. He would talk to me about moments I 
had inFlesh+Blood <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089153/> as though they were 
yesterday. He’s that thorough and that’s just how his brain works. When he 
looks at you, he doesn’t see just what you did the last two years and he 
doesn’t think you’re not that person you were in, whatever, 1985.

 The Hateful Eight - video review 
 He doesn’t think in terms of box-office draw.
He just sees you and what you’re capable of. That’s such a blessing, and it 
really made me remember who I was as an actress; I just had forgotten. Not in a 
bitter or sad way; it was just like I didn’t feel particularly meaningful or 
relevant right now. I was OK with it, I had other things going on and that’s 
fine. It’s just the way things go.

This is really remarkable for me. Honestly, I still look at the poster for The 
Hateful Eight and I can’t believe I’m in the movie. I love it so much and the 
experience was so grand. It really was exceptional.

It clearly lit a fire under you. Did making it make you more ambitious going 
forward?
I’ve never been a careerist and I live in the present, so I don’t know where 
this is going to go, but I know I just had this experience and now it will live 
on forever and I feel really lucky.

Funnily enough, you were in the audience for Tarantino’s staged live reading 
of his initial draft of The Hateful Eight (2). Did he invite you?
No, I just happened to go. I didn’t think he was going to do it as a movie. 
Then, when he decided to do it as a movie, I was one of a handful of people 
that he was thinking of to come in and read.

Talk about a fluke!
Yeah, right!

 ‘She’s as tough as they come’ … Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue in The 
Hateful Eight. Photograph: Andrew Cooper/AP 
Daisy gets a beating in The Hateful Eight (3). Were you at all apprehensive 
about how that might be perceived?
She’s one of the Hateful Eight. She happens to be a woman, but it’s not about 
that. I never felt like the set was about that at all either. She’s as tough as 
they come. She’s seen a lot of violence in her life and you can tell by the way 
she takes a punch. She gets her sense of self from that, too.

She seems to enjoy it, somewhat.
Yeah, because she’s tough. They’re not going to break her. I don’t consider 
myself very tough. I could be this tough in this movie, because I was working 
with Kurt Russell and I knew I would never get hurt. He’s the best dance 
partner in the world. I really felt I was in safe hands, so I never anticipated 
one single blow.

You never got one?
I never did. Really, that’s a credit to Kurt. A lot of my performance is a 
credit to Kurt – Quentin, too, of course, but Kurt, a lot. He was so there for 
me.

I’ve had a competitive streak and sense of focus from a very young age – I can 
really focus in. Daisy has that. She’s not going to let them see that it hurts 
her. She’s not going to let them see her vulnerability. She’s not going to let 
them win in any way. She’s going to win.

Was that your real hair in the movie?
Yeah …

I’m asking because the brains and vomit must have been a pain to wash out.
Yes, it was all a bitch to get out, but luckily, we had dressing rooms. 
Luckily, that stuff was done on a stage here, so even though the stage was 
freezing, when you walked out of the stage, it was not freezing (4). We had 
these little bungalows with good water pressure.

Sitting in a chair at the end of the day and getting all my makeup taken off 
and the black eye, and the facial massage, was like a little luxury.

Did you relish the opportunity to get all mucked-up on screen?
I loved it! Also, there’s a funny thing that happens. There are moments where 
Daisy’s covered with blood with teeth missing and it’s maybe one of the 
prettiest images of me that’s been done, because it’sBob [Robert] Richardson 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724744/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr11>, and the light just 
happens to be beautiful. In that moment, that character shines. What is 
beautiful changes from moment to moment. Yeah, there are moments in the movie 
where it’s just like, oh, my gosh, right out of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, 
and it’s “the ugly”, but I love every second of it. It never even occurred to 
me to …

… think about how you would look?
Yeah.

Were the fake teeth painful to wear?
At first they hurt, but then you got used to it and they didn’t hurt at all.

You’ve done your fair share of theatre over the years.
The Hateful Eight is like theatre.

Did Tarantino ever talk about doing it as a play?
Yeah. I think it would be an amazing production, to see that kind of violence 
on stage. If you could figure out a way to do it, it would be such an exciting 
theatre piece. Even just seeing the reading was an exciting theatre piece and 
that was just people sitting down and reading.

 The Hateful Eight stars Tim Roth and Kurt Russell: ‘America will still be 
talking about race in 3015’ 
You strike me as a director-centric actor. Is that how you typically sway when 
it comes to projects?
Yeah, I do. It’s the director’s medium. There have been been some mistakes I 
made in the past, which I wish I hadn’t, because either I was tired at the 
time, or it was a great director I wanted to work with and I, for whatever 
reason, didn’t want to do the project. Now, with time, you realise: oh, that 
was dumb. If it’s a great director, you always do the project, so these were 
life lessons learned. Still, given that, yes, I’ve been really fortunate and 
worked with some of our greatest directors.

 Pick your favourite working experience.
I would think it was this, really. Georgia

 was great. Anomalisa is also another one that, particularly, is in my heart 
and will be forever. I do think it’s a masterpiece, I really do. This 
experience, doing this … I wish we were still filming.

recurring turns on the TV shows Revenge and Weeds, but her role as Daisy 
Domergue, a foul-mouthed criminal in The Hateful Eight, marks her first major 
role since Margot at the Wedding in 2007. Last year, she also received major 
acclaim for her voice work in Charlie Kaufman’s animated romanceAnomalisa
