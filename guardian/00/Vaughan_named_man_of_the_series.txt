England hero Michael Vaughan clinched a double award, claiming both the 
man-of-the-match and man-of-the-series titles as England clinched the fifth and 
final match in the Ashes series.

Australia won the series 4-1, but Vaughan's 183 in the second innings at 
Sydney was his third century of the series.

"It's been a tough Test match, and to be quite honest we were celebrating 
getting to the fifth day," Vaughan admitted.

"But to actually beat this side - they are a great team to play against - is a 
fantastic achievement and it shows we have a lot of character in that dressing 
room.

"I would like to congratulate Steve (Waugh) and his team for regaining the 
Ashes. They have been magnificent all series. "To my team thanks for all the 
support, not just the players but the management.

"To all the Australian public thanks for all support and encouragement, and 
last but not least thanks to all British supporters out here. The Barmy Army 
have been fantastic."
