Andy Roddick <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-roddick> has crashed out 
of the Aegon Championships at Queen's with a shock defeat to the French 
outsider Edouard Roger-Vasselin.

Roddick, a four-times champion in the tournament, recovered well after losing 
the first set, but lost his nerve towards the end, allowing the world No67 to 
win the second-round match 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.

Roger-Vasselin lost their previous meeting, but showed immense composure in 
the final set, successfully defending a match point against him in the 10th 
game.

Roddick, seeded seventh, then wilted under pressure, double-faulting to give 
his opponent three break points.

The Frenchman took the opportunity at the second attempt, forcing the American 
to net after pushing him to the baseline with a searching forehand.

Roddick, the world No32, had to break serve to stay in the match but could not 
do so, with Roger-Vasselin sealing the win thanks to a clever drop shot.

Roger-Vasselin will play the winner of the match between David Nalbandian and 
Ruben Bemelmans in the next round.
