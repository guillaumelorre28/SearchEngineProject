The death toll in some of the worst avalanches in Afghanistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan> for 30 years has risen to more 
than 180 people, with heavy snow set to last for two more days.

 Officials warned of an imminent humanitarian emergency in areas most severely 
hit by the bad weather, with snow sweeping through villages and blocking off 
roads.

 “We haven’t seen this much snow, or this many avalanches, for 30 years,” said 
Abdul Rahman Kabiri, acting governor of the mountainous province of Panjshir, 
north of Kabul, where 186 people were killed and more than 100 injured in 
avalanches.

 Despite bringing misery to so many people, the snow is vital for Afghanistan, 
where much of the rural population dependent on agriculture relies on snow 
melting in the mountains to sustain crops in the spring and summer. An 
unusually dry winter had led to fears of drought.

 Farming drives the troubled Afghan economy, with about three quarters of the 
people living in rural areas, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation 
estimated in 2004.

 Irrigation is not extensive in Afghanistan, most of which is semi-arid, and 
aid efforts over the past decade or more have focused on trying to extend it, 
with mixed results.
