Outdoor cinemas 

Outdoor cinema is a tradition dating back many years, as sharing is a very 
Greek characteristic – my grandma told me stories about people putting their TV 
set in the street so everyone could watch it. There was a set day every week 
when the Greek movies were shown and the cinema today works in more or less the 
same way. For Greeks, going to an outdoor cinema is connected to summer – the 
cinemas generally open in April/May and close in September/October depending on 
the weather. It is popular with Greeks of all ages. Usually they show films 
that came out the previous year or old classics, and when it's an English film 
they have Greek sub-titles.

The cinemas are all surrounded by greenery so people jump on walls to watch, 
while a canteen serves drinks and snacks such as the mandatory Greek version of 
a slush puppy, hot dogs and nachos. People are, of course, allowed to smoke 
during the films. The open-air, the smell of the flowers and the whole feeling 
is just so summer and so Greek.

Vicious Cycles Athens (VCA)

In a city not formerly geared up for cycling, riders are now reclaiming the 
streets and VCA is a glimpse of that new world. It's a small bicycle store that 
reflects the hopes for a more involved cycling generation, spiced up with a 
touch of adrenaline.

Apanemia music venue

Athens is famous for its ancient history. Plato and Socrates walked and talked 
here, but it's hard to find traces of that period today. However, one thing 
that does remain unchanged is the warm Athenian hospitality of yesteryear. I 
recommend an evening at Plaka's underground music restaurant, Apanemia. A lot 
of Greek alternative music began here in the 70s and it has kept the same style 
and atmosphere for years.

Kasseta Record Shop

I recommend Kasseta Record Shop because it swims against the current. To open 
a record shop in Athens in the middle of such a crisis needs a lot of courage. 
It has quite a variety of music. It is also really well designed inside, so you 
can easily search for records and I find it cute. It is hidden away in 
Sofokleous street.

The Art Foundation (TAF)

TAF is an alternative cafe/bar combined with an art gallery. Almost every 
month an innovative and underground exhibition – sculpture, photography, 
painting, even short plays and live concerts – takes place there so you can 
entertain yourself in many ways. Additionally, the place is very weird because 
the bar is outside in a courtyard of a very rundown building, then the 
exhibitions take place in the separate wooden rooms around the courtyard. The 
atmosphere is warm, the music is excellent and the people are beautiful.

Galaxy Bar

Walking into Galaxy Bar feels like crossing into a timeless dimension – gentle 
decadence, tobacco-tinted walls, padded bar arm rails and genius bartending. 
Everything about this bar implies an archetypical drinking experience so unlike 
the crazy nightlife many have come to know in Athens.
