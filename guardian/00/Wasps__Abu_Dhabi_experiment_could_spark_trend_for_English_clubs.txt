More English clubs are keen to organise matches on foreign soil following 
confirmation thatWasps <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-wasps> will 
become the first Premiership team to stage a competitive match outside Europe 
when they face Harlequins in an LVÂ Cup match in Abu Dhabi on 30 January.

The game will be played under floodlights in a specially constructed 5,000 
capacity stadium at the Emirates Palace hotel. No England squad players will be 
involved but Wasps believe the experiment will still prove worthwhile.

"To be the first club to take a competitive game of rugby overseas really 
reflects Wasps desire to be innovative and try new things," said Lawrence 
Dallaglio, a board director at the London club..

"We want to ensure Wasps has a long-term future and it is steps like this that 
strengthen the club and develop a global brand. We know there will be some 
disappointment for those fans that cannot travel but one-off opportunities like 
these can only help build our profile, appeal and reach."

Leicester will be among several clubs monitoring the transplanted Anglo-Welsh 
contest with interest. "AtLeicester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leicestertigers> there has already been talk 
of going to Abu Dhabi, Dubai or Hong Kong to meet one of the southern 
hemisphere sides in a Super 15 warm-up game," said the Tigers' director of 
rugby, Richard Cockerill.

"The experience would be good and it would take the Tigers brand to another 
part of the world but, as things stand, the calendar is too full."

Cockerill also warned it would be premature for England to pick his teenage 
centre Manu Tuilagi in their Six Nations squad.
