“Faith is an island in the setting sun,/ but proof is the bottom line for 
everyone,” wrote a certain songwriter who could well be among a wealth of 
treasures spilled onto the shores of this week’s nominations. But is an island 
a place to escape reality, or face it? An adventure where dreams come true, 
like that of 1970s series Fantasy Island featuring the smooth-talkingRicardo 
Montalbán <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Montalbán> and his squeaky 
sidekick, Tattoo, played byHervé Villechaize 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervé_Villechaize>? Or a place where hopes are 
dashed on the rocks of isolated despair, as in Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, 
before the protagonist eventually finds inner strength and friendship in 
Friday? The answer must surely include both – song takes us to a new place, but 
also seeks a new perspective from it. Islands are a place to provide that 
relief.

 Fantasy Island … no one leaves empty handed. 
The 17th-century metaphysical poet, John Donne said: “No man is an island, 
entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent.” He had something 
there. Sometimes we may a wish to escape society, catch up with ourselves, 
perhaps write a song, but we cannot deny our connection with or need for other 
people – for after all, how can a song exist unless someone else hears it? 
Abba’s Björn and Benny, for example, escaped to splendid rocky Scandinavian 
isolation to write their songs, but always came back to perform them. We, like 
all living things, need the recognition of others, otherwise we are damned. For 
there is only one good context in which to be dammed - when building a small 
island because you are a beaver.

 Busy Scottish beavers: ‘Islands in the stream, that is what we are …’ 
Photograph: Kent News and Picture/Corbis SYG 
Islands in song can be as much psychological as geographical, philosophical as 
geological. They may be sandy, and tropical, but are often topical, and tell 
you that life is often less of a beach, more of bitch. Thomas More’s Utopia 
conceives of an ideal society in the form of a fictional island. The third part 
of Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels describes the floating island of Laputa 
where fantastical science experiments take place, but they in fact parody the 
real world of ideas. Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island brings us 
escapism and adventure, but also teaches us the moral lessons of greed.

 Jurassic Park … an island project where things didn’t quite work out as 
planned. Photograph: Close Murray/Corbis SYGMA 
Shakespeare’s The Tempest takes us to a magical, poetic place, a mirror in 
which to view social control through the words of Prospero and the basics of 
half-formed humanity in Caliban. Isla Nublar is where dinosaurs are mistakenly 
recreated in the concept of Jurassic Park. Craggy Island is the place from 
which Father Ted wants to escape, but where others cannot function without him. 
Either that or it’s just a brilliant sitcom. Danger Island is where the Banana 
Splits have no danger, only fun. AndLost 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QljyXkRNOLU>, the behemoth fantasy TV series 
about plane crash survivors on a remote island, reveals one universal truth 
about how screenwriters can, where plot is concerned, become utterly and 
completely – lost.

BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs is, however, a true terra firma, a haven of 
treasure among splashy media awash with rocks, shingle and shite. One of my 
very favourite episodes features the Hollywood heart-throb actor George 
Clooney. In a surprisingly witty and charming edition, he revealed that the one 
record he would keep, if all the others were washed away from his choices, 
would beWilliam Shatner doing Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB3uVARNhmM>, because if forced had to listen 
to that to the end of his days, it would give motivation to “hollow out my own 
leg and make a canoe out of it to get off the island”. Pure class.

 The great escape … George Clooney’s Desert Island Discs 
But let us now also escape back to reality, and quickly fly over some actual 
islands that may also be mentioned in your song suggestions. What islands are 
richer in their musical heritage than the reggae of the Caribbean? Or the 
tropical from the Bahamas, South Pacific, or Hawaii, and the true sound of the 
ukelele? Or the volcanic beauty and utterly unique culture of Iceland and all 
of its output? If such songs refer to island culture, then they are valid.

 Coney Island, baby. Brooklyn. Photograph: Andy Buchanan / Alamy/Alamy 
By contrast, songs may be inspired by the more urban Coney Island or Long 
Island of New York, a different haunt of musical inspiration. And then there 
are the remoter places – the natural wonders of the volcanic Galápagos islands 
or Madagascar, where evolutionary isolation brought about extraordinary species 
such as the giant tortoise and lemur. Then there is the dark history of Easter 
Island, where former inhabitants destroyed their future by cutting down all the 
trees, and, perhaps more broadly related to human behaviour this,Vanuata, 
recently devastated by cyclone Pam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/19/developed-nations-sow-wind-vanuatu-reaps-whirlwind>
, surely evidence of human-induced climate change.

Islands are a prism through which we can see our world, but they have also 
been prisons from which to escape – if, for example, you are Papillon, akaHenri 
Charrière <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Charrière>, who fled Devil’s 
Island <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Island> in 1969, or Robben 
Island, from which the great Nelson Mandela escaped by other means - his 
strength of character and the willpower and bravery of those who supported him.

Some islands are artificial, such as the obscenely expensive projects of 
Qatar’s Pearl resorts or Dubai’s Palm Islands. For less recreational reasons, 
the Netherlands has the world’s largest artificial island – theFlevodolder 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevopolder> – built as part of a vast project to 
withstand flooding.


But of course thousands of islands made by natural upheaval, and course 
includes those closer to home – the cluster we call the UK and Ireland, which 
though are not desert, oceanic or tropical, are continental islands, special in 
their own form of isolation andinteresting genetic mix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/18/genetic-study-30-percent-white-british-dna-german-ancestry>
. Again if they are referred to as islands in song, they can come into 
contention. In Richard II, Shakespeare referred to it as “this scepter’d isle, 
this other Eden, demi-paradise, this fortress build by Nature itself”, but 
perhaps what has given the UK its true fertility, particularly in song, is best 
summed up by that cantankerous cultural figure John Lydon: “Britain is an 
island; it’s always had a constant ebb and flow of immigration – it makes it a 
better place.”
