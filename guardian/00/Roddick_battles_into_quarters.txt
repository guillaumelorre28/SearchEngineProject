A fist-pumping Andy Roddick produced a stirring comeback on Monday to beat the 
Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2 and reach the quarter-finals of 
the Australian Open.

The ninth-seeded American battled back from two sets down in sweltering 
conditions in Melbourne, finally breaking through when he forced the 25th seed 
Youzhny into a wild backhand on his second set point at 6-5 in the third.

Another backhand error from Youzhny gave Roddick the key break in the fourth 
game of the fourth set as he wrestled the initiative back from his fellow 
20-year-old, who had won both their previous meetings.

Roddick, pumped up and thumping his chest after the big points, pressed 
Youzhny into a loose forehand to break in the third game of the final set and 
fired down his 19th ace to consolidate for a 3-1 advantage.

The demoralised Youzhny surrendered his serve again in the next game and 
Roddick easily closed out the match to win in three hours 14 minutes. In the 
quarter-final he will play Younes El Aynaoui, who achieved the upset of the 
tournament by knocking out world no1 Lleyton Hewitt.

Roddick also reached the last eight of the U.S. Open in 2001 and 2002, his 
best results in a grand slam to date.

Youzhny, who famously won the deciding rubber to give Russia victory over 
France in the Davis Cup final in Paris last month, was trying to reach his 
first grand slam quarter-final.

Searing heat at the Australian Open had played havoc with the schedule and 
tournament officials were forced to evoke the extreme heat policy to protect 
the health of the competitors.

At 2.30pm local time tournament referee Peter Bellenger suspended the start of 
new matches for an initial period of two hours, although matches in progress 
continued.
