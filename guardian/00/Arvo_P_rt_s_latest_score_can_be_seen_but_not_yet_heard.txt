Here's a good idea, and another reason to celebrate the web's informational 
democracy: Universal Edition have published the score ofArvo Pärt's Symphony 
no. 4 'Los Angeles' <http://issuu.com/universaledition/docs/paert4thsymph> 
online. It's the first symphony thereclusive Estonian 
<http://www.arvopart.info/> has composed in nearly 40 years and it hasn't even 
had its premiere yet (Esa-Pekka Salonen and theLos Angeles Philharmonic 
<http://www.laphil.com/> will give the first performances next year). What's 
more, you can print it, too - the press release says it's "available to 
browse", but you can effectively give yourself an early Pärtian present of his 
latest symphony. A quick glance reveals music of typical slowness and radiant 
reflection, although the final third movement has a quicker coda.

I hope other publishers follow Universal's generous gesture. Unfortunately, 
it's probably a one-off, since music publishers can't afford to give away all 
the latest works by their composers for free. There's also the fact that - 
apart from the obvious illegality - there's nothing in theory stopping an 
enterprising orchestra putting on a clandestine run-through of Pärt's symphony 
before the LA Phil performances, as long as they've got a decent string 
section, and the timpani and percussionists the works needs. Best to enjoy 
Universal's online edition as a study score, and look forward to Salonen's 
recording next year.
