will be making his West End theatre debut this Christmas, in the Royal Opera 
House’s production of Wind in the Willows.

There’ll be a tinge of disappointment for anyone hoping he might dress up in 
racing goggles for the part of Toad, as he is merely appearing as the narrator 
of the classic children’s tale by Kenneth Grahame. Titchmarsh said he was 
“thrilled and delighted” to be involved, describing The Wind in the Willows as 
“my all-time favourite children’s book.”

The narration has been written by former poet laureate Andrew Motion, while 
the production is directed by Will Tuckett, who won an Olivier award for his 
recent staging of the show at the Duchess Theatre. It was originally conceived 
and staged 12 years ago, before finally making a West End transfer in 2013.

Performances will begin at the Vaudeville Theatre from 26 November onwards.
