News International confirmed today that it will block news aggregator 
NewsNow.co.uk <http://newsnow.co.uk/h/> from content on all its websites, 
including Sun Online and NotW.co.uk.

"We've been in communication with NewsNow for several months. We asked them to 
remove our content repeatedly from their indexing," said a News International 
spokesperson. "Now, we will update our files accordingly for all our titles."

News International started to block NewsNow from crawling its Times Online 
site on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/08/digital-media-newspapers>. It is 
still possible to produce a link to its content manually,as the internet 
consultant Malcom Cole pointed out 
<http://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/times-newsnow-crawling-linking/>. However, 
NewsNow is an automatic news aggregator that relies on "web crawlers" to index 
content.

"NewsNow has been using Times Online content as part of its paid-for, 
commercial as well as free services. They have continued to do so despite our 
direct requests for them to stop. As a result, we have taken the decision to 
disallow their indexing of our content," the company said in a statement.

"News International makes a significant investment in journalism and we 
believe that it is entirely appropriate for us to ask that our rights are 
respected. NewsNow has acknowledged that they require our permission to use our 
content and, in the absence of our permission, has ceased to do so."‬

There was no comment about any plans to block other news aggregators. 

Struan Bartlett, the NewsNow managing director and chairma, explained on 
Friday why NewsNow kept on crawling News International's content, despite being 
asked to stop: "We have been trying to solicit from them their reason for 
wanting us to stop, but not other search engines," he said. "They haven't given 
us a reason that we understand."
