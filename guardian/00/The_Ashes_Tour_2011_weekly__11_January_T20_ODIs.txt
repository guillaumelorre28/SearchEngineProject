Isa Guha on the other England v Australia

England bowler Isa Guha writes for the Guardian 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2010/dec/24/the-ashes-2010-isa-guha-swanny-santa>
 on the Women's tour of Australia:
 Isa Guha: England Women's Cricket bowler 
As the England boys retained the Ashes we were flying high somewhere over the 
Pacific so there was a real buzz amongst the group to find out the result when 
we landed.

Perth proved to be a real scorcher registering 38 degrees most days, a stark 
contrast to the freezing temperatures back home. We acclimatised well and 
dominated Western Australia in the warm-up games only to be plagued with three 
unfortunate injuries to our party. Claire Taylor, one of our most prolific run 
scorers was omitted from the first ODI after diving and sustaining a shoulder 
injury in the warm-up games and both Beth Morgan and Katherine Brunt were 
struck down in the 1st ODI.

This meant that our batting order was reshuffled and I took on the reins of 
opening bowler for the last 2 ODIs. Despite these setbacks we still nearly won 
in the first ODI and showed a lot of character in the last game to come back 
and win making the series 2-1. Charlotte Edwards certainly led from the front 
and fully deserved the Player of the Series award.

I also think it was testament to the way we rallied around and supported each 
other not just during cricket time but outside of that too. Whilst the men 
relaxed by playing macho army games on the wii we settled for dance wii, 
something that came naturally to some and not so much to others.

It was massive blow to lose Beth Morgan and Claire Taylor who had to return 
home as the rest of us set off to Adelaide. It was an emotional send off but 
this is now an opportunity for younger players to step up to the mark.

We trained at the Adelaide Oval at same time as the men and although our nets 
were in a separate area it was hard not to be distracted when fielding on the 
Oval as we watched the likes of Morgan, Trott and Bresnan hitting sixes for 
fun. There are more girls hitting sixes in the game now than there was a few 
years ago, but that is one part where the men remain superior. For instance you 
would favour a men's side chasing 20 runs off ten balls.

The presence of the men's side has definitely given us a boost as we look 
forward to the two Twenty20 headliner games at Adelaide and Melbourne and think 
of ways to entertain the crowd even more. We won't be getting out the sprinkler 
but look for something of our own.

Beyond the Ashes

So, how is the Ashes cold turkey going? Caught up on your sleep? Starting to 
think it was all a dream? Or will a string of T20 and ODIs be the perfect 
bridge to normality/the ICC World Cup 2011 
<http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2011?template=wcfixtures>?

Well, the cricket is about to start again in earnest, but with a schedule and 
timetable that will be slightly less draining on the England-based supporter:

Wednesday 12 Jan 8.35am GMT 1st T20 Adelaide
Friday 14 Jan 8.35am 2nd T20 Melbourne
Sunday 16 Jan 3.20am 1st ODI Melbourne
Friday 21 Jan 3.20am 2nd ODI Hobart
Sunday 23 Jan 3.20am 3rd ODI Sydney
Wednesday 26 Jan 3.20am 4th ODI Adelaide
Sunday 30 Jan 3.20am 5th ODI Brisbane
Tuesday 2 Feb 3.20am 6th ODI Sydney
Sunday 6 Feb 3.20am 7th ODI Perth

There will be OBO coverage 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/ashes+over-by-over-reports> of all these 
games. And this blog is here for you to discuss the games. (Or whatever else 
you fancy).

There are also a series of England v Australia Women's matches, with the first 
two T20s being played immediately prior to the men's games.

Wed 12 Jan 3.35am GMT 1st T20 Adelaide
Fri 14 Jan 3.35am 2nd T20 Melbourne
Sun 16 Jan 4.05am 3rd T20 Canberra
Mon 17 Jan 4.05am 4th T20 Canberra
Sat 22 Jan 11.30pm (Fri GMT) Ashes test, Sydney

Since the Ashes were won, England have done a bit of partying 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3336902/Tinie-Tempah-has-a-Wicket-time.html>
,Jimmy Anderson has been given a short break 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jan/08/ashes-england-james-anderson-australia>
,the IPL franchises snubbed the England players 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jan/09/james-anderson-ipl-england-ashes> 
(availability must have been a major issue),the IPL franchises have snubbed 
Yorkshire's players 
<http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/Yorkshire-relieved-as-players-are.6685189.jp>
 (much to the relief of some of us), andIan Bell scored a match-winning century 
in the ODI warm-up game 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jan/10/ian-bell-century-england> (he must 
feel like he has a mountain of runs to unload that were just unneeded batting 
at No6 in the Ashes).

Meanwhile, Australia have recalled Nathan Hauritz, Brett Lee and Shaun Tait 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jan/11/australia-recall-hauritz-lee-odi> 
for their one-day squad.

Oh, and Ma B is back in Britain.

Some post Ashes links

In case you missed it on the final day of the Ashes, here is Mike Skinner's 
tribute to England and to Mike Selvey's poetry:

Like The Sound blog reported 
<http://like-the-sound.blogspot.com/2011/01/english-corner-video-short-by-mike.html>
:

Mike Selvey told me that he does of course know of Mike Skinner and heard his 
work. When asked what Mike Selvey thought of Mike Skinner's video ***an english 
corner***, he said "Mike Skinner's video short here is just flattering really. 
actually makes it sound readable. my kids will think i'm seriously cool now."

The Full Toss brings: The ten best things about the Ashes 
<http://thefulltoss.com/2011/01/10/the-ten-best-things-about-the-ashes/>

Here's a blog about how England cricket supporters followed the Ashes by the 
Wisden Cricketer: "A day in the night of the Ashes." 
<http://wisdencricketer.com/blogs/blog/2011/01/10/the-ashes-a-day-in-the-night/>

The Best of Simon Hughes's Ashes videos 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/8248717/The-best-of-Analyst-at-the-Ashes.html>
, which features some splendid Hughes/Slater banter and an awful lot of the 
Barmy Army (perhaps the Telegraph was attempting to make amends forMatthew 
Norman's unwarranted assault 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/8225795/Matthew-Norman-lets-pack-Englands-phoney-Barmy-Army-off-from-Ashes-series-in-Australia-to-Helmand.html>
).

Donald McRae interviewed Jonathan Trott 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jan/11/jonathan-trott-interview-england-ashes>
. Says Trott:

We had a drink with the Aussies after Sydney. They're getting stick over here 
and they're obviously a bit down. I did feel some sympathy because you know how 
bad losing feels. We remember how devastated we felt after [the third Test at] 
Perth. So, while you're chuffed for yourself and your team-mates, you do think 
for a moment about how they're feeling. But, look, it's England-Australia. You 
can't be too sorry.

And finally, I can't believe that I didn't discover this from @CountyKitMan 
<http://twitter.com/CountyKitMan> until the end of the Ashes: The Secret Ashes 
Diary of Timothy Bresnan Esq (IQ 157½)
