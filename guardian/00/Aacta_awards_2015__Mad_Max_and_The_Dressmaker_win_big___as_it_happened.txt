See you in 2016.

And that’s that. No tie for best film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2015/jan/29/aacta-awards-2015-live-coverage>
 like last year, make that January. The Dressmaker takes the audience choice 
gong but Mad Max: Fury Road wins the all important academy vote. Sounds about 
right – at least Guardian chief film critic Peter Bradshaw would approve. 
Compare and contrast his reviews of the two films.

Here at Guardian Australia we’re actually fans of both movies, as well as 
Peter Allen: Not the Boy Next Door, which took the top TV award tonight, 
alongside acting nods for its old and young leads.

Tomorrow you’ll be hearing from our own boy next door, Luke Buckmaster, on all 
the worthy and not so worthy winners. Here’s a clue about his feelings.
Luke Buckmaster (@lukebuckmaster) 
There would/should have been (justifiably) riots on the street if 
#MadMaxFuryRoad <https://twitter.com/hashtag/MadMaxFuryRoad?src=hash> didn't 
win Best Film at#AACTAs <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AACTAs?src=hash>

We’ll also have news, pics and videos – all the fun stuff. As the media room 
goon just said: “Famous people! Winning awards! It’s great!” Thanks for 
reading, film fans.

And finally ... best film

The big one ... how did we get here already? 

So will it be:

• The cars and sand and searing fifth wave feminism of Mad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/11/mad-max-fury-road-review-tom-hardy>
; the Clint Eastwood with a sewing machine ofThe Dressmaker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/17/the-dressmaker-review-jocelyn-moorhouse-blows-small-town-drama-sky-high>
; the roadtrip and middle age romance ofLast Cab to Darwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/07/last-cab-to-darwin-first-look-review->
; the schooldays-to-deathbed love story ofHolding the Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/15/holding-the-man-review-memorable-performances-but-a-little-wobbly>
; or evenPaper Planes

people say will carry it right through to the Academy Awards next year.
 Just another excuse for a Tom Hardy pic.

In what frankly feels like a made-up award, Love My Way picks up the “AACTA 
SubscriptionTelevision <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/television> 20th 
Anniversary Award for Best Drama”.

Claudia Karvan is her usual composed self in the media room, crediting some 
amazing writers and producers who are now working across the world on all sort 
of major hits.

There’s some chat about why subscription TV is the way ahead for Australian 
drama ... and then a hugely enormous thunderclap. OMINOUS. Guardian Australia’s 
Steve Dow looked into this for us a few months ago if you’re interested in that 
sort of stuff.

Never mind the Netflix tax: when will the TV streamers make an Australian hit?

Best TV comedy series

The nicely satirical shortlist (who said the genre was dead?) is as follows:


• Danger Five
• Sammy J and Randy in Ricketts Lane
• Shaun Micallef’s Mad As Hell

Want to know more about how Danger Five took on Hitler and North Korea. Then 
read this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/30/danger-5-director-dario-russo-on-the-tricky-task-of-mocking-world-villains>
.

But the gong goes to Shaun Micallef, who talked to Guardian Australia recently 
about his latest big challenge: how to make Malcolm Turnball funny. Good luck 
on that, Shaun.

Shaun’s obviously working hard anyway, as he’s not here to pick up his gong. 
But his colleague talks about why it works so damn well.

Interview guy: “How do you make genuine fun that’s still intelligent?”

Stand-in dude: “You’ve got to allow people to be offended.”

A good lesson for Guardian journalists and commenters too.

Best supporting actor and actress award

... and talk of the devil. Best supporting actor in a film goes to Hugo Weaving
 for The Dressmaker.

He pays tribute to a whole bunch of women: Rosalie Ham, who wrote the book, 
producer Sue Maslin, but most of all, the director Jocelyn Moorhouse. “It was a 
treat to work with you again”.

Weaving’s referencing Moorhouse’s killer of a thriller, Proof, “the first film 
I ever did that really excited me”, he says. Here’s Luke Buckmaster’s blog on 
it.

Proof rewatched – an enormously compelling character study

The wonderful Judy Davis also takes best supporting actress for The 
Dressmaker, well on its way to becoming the biggest winner of the night.


(NB If you haven’t checked out Luke’s “rewatching 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films>” 
series yet, you should. It’s a weekly treat!

Cate is in the press room ... And she’s talking one of our favourite topics. 
WhyAustralian film <https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia> is so great. 
Here’s Cate’s take:

We should be celebrating not explaining away our industry ... or talking about 
it like it’s bigger than it is. It’s a jewel and I’m proud to be part of it.

Guardian Australia film critic Luke Buckmaster says this:
Luke Buckmaster (@lukebuckmaster) 
Cate Blanchett: so much dignity, so much poise, so willing to venture into the 
dramatic wilderness. A truly great actor#AACTAs

And while we’re talking up Australian film

had lots to add in this recent interview.

Peter Allen wins a second award or at least the teenager who played his 
younger self does, for best supporting actor in a TV drama –14-year-oldKy 
Baldwin is surprisingly composed in the press room.

Interviewer: “I’m shocked at the adult nature of your resume ... Bomb Blast 
Boy, in Underbelly Razor??”

A blase Baldwin: “I’ve died more times in shows than lived.”

Best television drama series

... goes to ABC’s new paranormal show Glitch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/31/glitch-australian-paranormal-tv-series-struggles-to-bring-its-undead-to-life>
. Which just goes to show you can’t go wrong with the undead, some wit in the 
media room comments.

Here’s its star Paddy Brammall (whose film Ruben Guthrie is also up in the 
film categories) talking about playing Sergeant James Hayes, an “unassuming, 
unambitious” cop in the small country town of Yoorana, who discovers a group of 
six naked and filthy figures wandering around the local cemetery. To further 
complicate matters, one of the walking undead is Hayes’ late wife. Uh-oh!

Best lead actor and actress in a feature film

Kate Winslet and Michael Caton take the crowns respectively for The Dressmaker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/17/the-dressmaker-review-jocelyn-moorhouse-blows-small-town-drama-sky-high>
 andLast Cab to Darwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/07/last-cab-to-darwin-first-look-review->
. No prizes for guessing who turned up and who phoned in via Skype.

Though credit to Winslet, she’s in jolly form, crediting her Aussie dialect 
coach (“I think we got away with it”) and bemoaning that she didn’t brush her 
hair for the camera.

“Comedies never win best actor,” says Caton (still best known for 1997’s The 
Castle) later in the press room. “It’s always drama.” And what a drama Last Cab 
to Darwin was - it had at least two Guardian Aus culture writers weeping in the 
Dendy Newtown anyway.

Oh and The Dressmaker is already racking them up. It’s won the audience choice 
award for bestAustralian film <https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia> too.

Is Max Mad furious yet? We’re spoiling for a fight. But here’s a fact for you 
...

In the media room, he says of his character: “His humility was something that 
astonished me. You can hear it and see it in his writings.” Here’s a great read 
on what made Allen such an Aussie legend.

“Now let’s sort out this snot stuff,” says Blanchett, accepting her award amid 
visible tears. “I’ve had my sinuses cauterised” (and that’s not a code for 
having her breasts done, she adds).

Sniff. “I’ve become one of these ridiculous people who cry! It’s just a 
fucking award ... Perhaps I’m old enough to get it. There are so many people 
who could be receiving this.”

Maybe Cate but here are your career highlights anyway:

Blanchett awarded the Longford Lyell Award
 Cate Blanchett Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images for AFI 
So let’s get this bit out of the way first. It wouldn’t be an Australian red 
carpet withoutCate Blanchett <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett> 
walking it. Or an film awards do without her winning one. Tonight it’s the 
lifetime achievement / contribution one.

The actor looked her usual serene self earlier posing for the paps. But now 
she’s super embarrassed in the stalls as her old muckers Richard Roxburgh and 
Hugo Weaving take to the stage to start the praisefest.

“Cathy Blankett” as the fresh-faced Melburnian used to be known, says Weaving, 
always gives everything she has. Even her snot, says the Rox, who remembers 
“exiting most evenings covered in it” when they co-starred in Hamlet back at 
the start of their careers.

(in fact, he told us the same story on the red carpet earlier)

Exciting moment: "exactly how much snot are we talking Rox?"

Cue tribute reel, with directors including Bruce Beresford, Sam Raimi, Ron 
Howard, Martin Scorsese and Alejandro González Iñárritu queueing up to eulogise 
La B.

Refreshingly, it’s a woman director, Gillian Armstrong who’s allowed on stage 
to talk about the fresh-faced NIDA graduate she auditioned for Oscar and 
Lucinda way back in 1997, before Blanchett arrives to accept her award.

Could she be in Oscar talks again next February? Let’s see.

And that’s that. No tie for best film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2015/jan/29/aacta-awards-2015-live-coverage>
 like last year, make that January. The Dressmaker takes the audience choice 
gong but Mad Max: Fury Road wins the all important academy vote. Sounds about 
right – at least Guardian chief film critic Peter Bradshaw would approve. 
Compare and contrast his reviews of the two films.

Here at Guardian Australia we’re actually fans of both movies, as well as 
Peter Allen: Not the Boy Next Door, which took the top TV award tonight, 
alongside acting nods for its old and young leads.

Tomorrow you’ll be hearing from our own boy next door, Luke Buckmaster, on all 
the worthy and not so worthy winners. Here’s a clue about his feelings.

And the Aacta award for best film presented by Presto goes to Mad Max: Fury 
Road. It’s only the latest in a long line of accolades for the film that some 
people say will carry it right through to the Academy Awards next year.
 Just another excuse for a Tom Hardy pic.

Mad Max: Fury Road’s first big win of the night! 

Luke Buckmaster recently chatted to the award-winning George Miller about the 
intricate plotting behind eachMad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road> character.

George Miller: 'There has been a massive talent drain in Australia'

In what frankly feels like a made-up award, Love My Way picks up the “AACTA 
SubscriptionTelevision <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/television> 20th 
Anniversary Award for Best Drama”.

Claudia Karvan is her usual composed self in the media room, crediting some 
amazing writers and producers who are now working across the world on all sort 
of major hits.

There’s some chat about why subscription TV is the way ahead for Australian 
drama ... and then a hugely enormous thunderclap. OMINOUS. Guardian Australia’s 
Steve Dow looked into this for us a few months ago if you’re interested in that 
sort of stuff.

Never mind the Netflix tax: when will the TV streamers make an Australian hit?

The nicely satirical shortlist (who said the genre was dead?) is as follows:


• Danger Five
• Sammy J and Randy in Ricketts Lane
• Shaun Micallef’s Mad As Hell
• Utopia

Want to know more about how Danger Five took on Hitler and North Korea. Then 
read this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/30/danger-5-director-dario-russo-on-the-tricky-task-of-mocking-world-villains>
.

But the gong goes to Shaun Micallef, who talked to Guardian Australia recently 
about his latest big challenge: how to make Malcolm Turnball funny. Good luck 
on that, Shaun.

<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/16/shaun-micallefs-new-comedy-dilemma-how-to-make-malcolm-turnbull-funny>
Shaun’s obviously working hard anyway, as he’s not here to pick up his gong. 
But his colleague talks about why it works so damn well.

Interview guy: “How do you make genuine fun that’s still intelligent?”

Stand-in dude: “You’ve got to allow people to be offended.”

A good lesson for Guardian journalists and commenters too.
 
... and talk of the devil. Best supporting actor in a film goes to Hugo Weaving
 for The Dressmaker.

He pays tribute to a whole bunch of women: Rosalie Ham, who wrote the book, 
producer Sue Maslin, but most of all, the director Jocelyn Moorhouse. “It was a 
treat to work with you again”.

Weaving’s referencing Moorhouse’s killer of a thriller, Proof, “the first film 
I ever did that really excited me”, he says. Here’s Luke Buckmaster’s blog on 
it.

The wonderful Judy Davis also takes best supporting actress for The 
Dressmaker, well on its way to becoming the biggest winner of the night.


(NB If you haven’t checked out Luke’s “rewatching

series yet, you should. It’s a weekly treat!
 
Cate is in the press room ... And she’s talking one of our favourite topics. 
WhyAustralian film <https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia> is so great. 
Here’s Cate’s take:

We should be celebrating not explaining away our industry ... or talking about 
it like it’s bigger than it is. It’s a jewel and I’m proud to be part of it.

Guardian Australia film critic Luke Buckmaster says this:

Cate Blanchett: so much dignity, so much poise, so willing to venture into the 
dramatic wilderness. A truly great actor#AACTAs

And while we’re talking up Australian film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia>, Blanchett’s buddy Hugo Weaving 
had lots to add in this recent interview.

don't exist

Peter Allen wins a second award or at least the teenager who played his 
younger self does, for best supporting actor in a TV drama –14-year-oldKy 
Baldwin is surprisingly composed in the press room.

Interviewer: “I’m shocked at the adult nature of your resume ... Bomb Blast 
Boy, in Underbelly Razor??”

A blase Baldwin: “I’ve died more times in shows than lived.”
 
... goes to ABC’s new paranormal show Glitch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/31/glitch-australian-paranormal-tv-series-struggles-to-bring-its-undead-to-life>
. Which just goes to show you can’t go wrong with the undead, some wit in the 
media room comments.

Here’s its star Paddy Brammall (whose film Ruben Guthrie is also up in the 
film categories) talking about playing Sergeant James Hayes, an “unassuming, 
unambitious” cop in the small country town of Yoorana, who discovers a group of 
six naked and filthy figures wandering around the local cemetery. To further 
complicate matters, one of the walking undead is Hayes’ late wife. Uh-oh!

Kate Winslet and Michael Caton take the crowns respectively for The Dressmaker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/17/the-dressmaker-review-jocelyn-moorhouse-blows-small-town-drama-sky-high>
 andLast Cab to Darwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/07/last-cab-to-darwin-first-look-review->
. No prizes for guessing who turned up and who phoned in via Skype.

Though credit to Winslet, she’s in jolly form, crediting her Aussie dialect 
coach (“I think we got away with it”) and bemoaning that she didn’t brush her 
hair for the camera.

“Comedies never win best actor,” says Caton (still best known for 1997’s The 
Castle) later in the press room. “It’s always drama.” And what a drama Last Cab 
to Darwin was - it had at least two Guardian Aus culture writers weeping in the 
Dendy Newtown anyway.

Oh and The Dressmaker is already racking them up. It’s won the audience choice 
award for bestAustralian film <https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia> too.

Is Max Mad furious yet? We’re spoiling for a fight. But here’s a fact for you 
...

In the media room, he says of his character: “His humility was something that 
astonished me. You can hear it and see it in his writings.” Here’s a great read 
on what made Allen such an Aussie legend.

“Now let’s sort out this snot stuff,” says Blanchett, accepting her award amid 
visible tears. “I’ve had my sinuses cauterised” (and that’s not a code for 
having her breasts done, she adds).

Sniff. “I’ve become one of these ridiculous people who cry! It’s just a 
fucking award ... Perhaps I’m old enough to get it. There are so many people 
who could be receiving this.”

Maybe Cate but here are your career highlights anyway:

Cate Blanchett: five best moments

So let’s get this bit out of the way first. It wouldn’t be an Australian red 
carpet withoutCate Blanchett <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett> 
walking it. Or an film awards do without her winning one. Tonight it’s the 
lifetime achievement / contribution one.

The actor looked her usual serene self earlier posing for the paps. But now 
she’s super embarrassed in the stalls as her old muckers Richard Roxburgh and 
Hugo Weaving take to the stage to start the praisefest.

“Cathy Blankett” as the fresh-faced Melburnian used to be known, says Weaving, 
always gives everything she has. Even her snot, says the Rox, who remembers 
“exiting most evenings covered in it” when they co-starred in Hamlet back at 
the start of their careers.

(in fact, he told us the same story on the red carpet earlier)

Cue tribute reel, with directors including Bruce Beresford, Sam Raimi, Ron 
Howard, Martin Scorsese and Alejandro González Iñárritu queueing up to eulogise 
La B.

Refreshingly, it’s a woman director, Gillian Armstrong who’s allowed on stage 
to talk about the fresh-faced NIDA graduate she auditioned for Oscar and 
Lucinda way back in 1997, before Blanchett arrives to accept her award.

Could she be in Oscar talks again next February? Let’s see.
 
Time comes round quickly doesn’t it! Particularly when The Australian Academy
