The Andy Roddick <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-roddick> story 
refuses to quit. In another hugely entertaining piece of high theatre, the 
fiery-eyed American won through to the quarter-finals by beating the affable 
Italian Fabio Fognini and declared: "This whole process, I'm not trying to 
over-think it. I'm enjoying it."

He revealed his dodgy serving shoulder gave him trouble when he got out of bed 
in the morning but not even that can make Mr Grumpy frown. "It's not great But 
it's good enough. I got max a week of tennis left, so it's good enough for 
that."

This is a man who seems more comfortable with his surroundings on the eve of 
leaving the sport than he ever did when in his pomp. The snarl is gone. He even 
smiled when he won. He nearly cried. In fact, he probably did cry. Andy Roddick 
is letting the facade drop and it's not a bad look.

Fognini gave him a decent workout, but now Roddick's got Juan Martin del 
Potro, who won here in 2009. From here, it gets serious.

If, against all odds, he carries the dream to its logical conclusion (logical 
to Roddick, that is), he will have a few friends to thank.

"I'm comfortable out there," he said. "I'd be an idiot not to use the crowd 
right now. It's a huge advantage. Each match is almost like it's another 
memory. I'm certainly going to use them.

"It was loud out there, about as loud as I remember. They definitely 
established themselves out there. It was a lot of fun."

Memories of Jimbo

If you admire what Roddick is doing at the US Open, just turned 30 and already 
officially retired, think back to the deeds of Jimmy Connors, from the start to 
the finish of his remarkable career.

It is 42 years to the day since Connors, full of bristling energy under that 
distinctive mop, shoulders hunched, eyes on fire and wearing those ridiculously 
tight shorts, barrelled into New York for the first time, on his 18th birthday. 
When Britain's Mark Cox dumped him out in the first round who, except the man 
himself, could be sure he would be around for a long time after that?

Fast-forward to 1991, when Jimbo gatecrashed his favourite tournament again 
after recovering from a bad wrist injury. He was ranked 194 in the world and 
given no hope of surviving more than a match or two, but he came back from two 
sets and 0-3 in the third to beat Patrick McEnroe in the first round, then 
swept aside Michiel Schapers and the tenth seed Karel Novacek to reach the 
final 16. There, on his 39th birthday, exactly 21 years since Cox beat him in 
the first round, he met 24-year-old Aaron Krickstein and, over four hours and 
41 minutes, won a memorable five-setter to reach the quarter-finals. A few days 
later, he did this against the Dutchman Paul Haarhuis in one of the sport's 
great rallies:

Connors won in four sets but had nothing left against Jim
Courier in the semis and the amazing journey was over. But it was some
trip. Nobody worked a crowd like Jimmy Connors – not even Roddick.

In the swim

Sam Smith, British No 1 for three years in the late Nineties, has plenty of 
good memories – and she left this tournament with another. Now commentating 
astutely for Sky, she said on air she would swim in the fountain outside the 
venue if Laura Robson won three matches here.

When Robson duly delivered, becoming the first British player to reach the 
fourth round of a major since Smith in 1998, Sam was determined to pay her 
forfeit. With the media in tow, she was thwarted by local officials who said 
she did not have the necessary permit for such activity – but, we can reveal, 
she sneaked back later and the deed was done.

Had Laura beaten Stosur, next on the starting blocks was Annabel Croft

See ya later, Lleyton?

The little Aussie battler, Lleyton Hewitt, went down fighting (he knows no 
other way) but gave not indication of following Roddick into retirement after 
his four-set loss to the fourth seed David Ferrer.

How much does he love tennis? Check this on how he is now playing with a 
bionic toe, but risked never being able to play again with radical surgery

.

He said on his way out he will play the Davis Cup in Germany in a fortnight 
and four more tournaments this year, but there was no mention of the R word.

He's done a complete round of majors this year on wild cards and, no doubt, 
will get another one at home in Melbourne in January. How long can he rely on 
the goodwill of tournament organisers? It won't do the ratings any harm. He is, 
after all, eight years younger than Connors was in that epic 1991 campaign at 
Flushing Meadows.

Standing your ground

Fans of confrontational tennis might like to catch the fourth-round contest on 
Monday between Tomas Berdych and Nicolas Almagro, first up in the Louis 
Armstrong Stadium.

They clashed famously at the Australian Open when the Spaniard banged a volley 
directly at Berdych, who did not take kindly to this breach of tennis etiquette 
and refused to shake hands with his opponent at the end of the match.

To my mind, the greater crime was Berdych's. For a start, the custom of 
refusing to physically inconvenience an opponent, to the detriment of your own 
point-scoring chances, has always seemed daft. Second, he should have had the 
good grace to accept the apology Almagro proffered.

That said, Berdych, 50-1 before this tournament, might be worth watching in 
the second week.
