Alan Titchmarsh was no fan of the BBC's coverage of the diamond jubilee boat 
pageant, reports the Daily Mirror. "I got very angry when the Queen was wrongly 
called 'her royal highness' and the presenters were vague on facts," the former 
Gardeners' World man told the Radio Times. "One said the Queen had outlasted 12 
prime ministers and 'at least' six American presidents. We all make mistakes 
but when somebody hasn't done their homework, that gets me a bit rattled." 
Titchmarsh also revealed he doesn't watch Gardeners' World, which he hosted for 
seven years. "I'd be irritated if I thought it wasn't as good as it used to be 
and a bit stunned if it was better." Are you going to tell him or am I?
