According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, 5,000 civilians 
left the besieged districts in 75 buses on Monday.

Another 25 buses were ready to take more people to the rebel-held town of 
Rashideen in countryside to the west of the city.

“These were the worst days we endured,” said Abu Jaafar, a doctor who left the 
city and arrived in Rashideen on Monday. “This week was terrible, people were 
in the streets, and most of the houses they lived in had been destroyed.

“When people were ready to be evacuated they stood in their tens of thousands 
in a square in the harsh cold, many of them children and women. There was 
nothing of the basics of life – little food, warmth and no shelter. All you 
heard was the screams and tears of children.”

The evacuations resumed on Monday after four days of limbo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/17/thousands-of-aleppo-residents-in-limbo-as-transport-fails-to-arrive>
, when it looked like the truce might unravel over the intransigence of Iran 
and its proxy militias on the government’s side and al-Qaida-linked militants 
on the rebel side.

The deal, brokered after intense shuttle diplomacy and pressure from Turkey 
and Russia,initially broke down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/aleppo-evacuation-suspended-as-blasts-heard-at-departure-point>
 over Iranian demands for a simultaneous evacuation of Fua and Kefraya, two 
Shia pro-government villages that have been besieged by rebels for years.

After rebels acceded to the demands, they were stymied by Jabhat Fateh 
al-Sham, the powerful al-Qaida-linked group, which initially refused to accept 
the deal. Fighters linked to the grouptorched buses

 that were meant to transport people from Fua and Kefraya on Sunday, once again 
putting the deal at risk.

But 500 people were eventually evacuated from the villages on Monday, allowing 
the evacuations from east Aleppo to resume.

A source with knowledge of the deal said Russian insistence on securing the 
evacuation agreement was the key element that prevented the talks from falling 
apart. Russia, a key ally of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, helped 
level much of east Aleppo in the months leading up to the regime’s assault, 
which was spearheaded by Shia militias backed by Tehran.

Moscow wishes to anchor itself as a global power with the diplomatic prowess 
to bring an end to the fighting in the country.

Among those who were rescued was Bana al-Abed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/19/where-is-bana-girl-who-tweeted-from-aleppo-is-safely-evacuated>
, a seven-year-old girl whose tweets about life in east Aleppo under bombardment
captured the attention of hundreds of thousands of people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/where-is-bana-syrian-girl-who-tweeted-from-aleppo-goes-silent>
 on social media, including prominent figures such as the author JK Rowling.

Humanitarian workers in the area published images showing a smiling Bana on 
their shoulders, wearing a winter jacket and woollen head cover. Her tweets had 
drawn attention to the suffering of east Aleppo’s residents, and there were 
fears that she might be killed or fall into the hands of government forces.

Nearly 50 children who had been trapped in an orphanage were evacuated on 
Monday, the United Nations children’s agency said. Some were in a critical 
condition from injuries and dehydration, Unicef’s regional director told 
Reuters.

The UN security council unanimously passed a resolution to deploy 
international observers to the city. The evacuation has so far been supervised 
by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red 
Crescent.


In the rebel-controlled areas of Aleppo, 13,000 civilians and the majority of 
fighters have now been evacuated. Refugees on buses sent desperate messages on 
Sunday night describing terrible conditions as they were held for hours with 
dwindling water and food.


Those still in east Aleppo, most of which fell under government control in a 
rapid offensive, are enduring harsh winter weather as they await rescue through 
the evacuation deal.

“The people we are welcoming have been through hell – the level of trauma they 
have experienced is impossible to describe or comprehend,” said Casey Harrity, 
the director of programmes at Mercy Corps, which is providing aid to civilians 
who have been evacuated. “We are working very hard to ensure they are received 
with as much dignity and support as possible.”
