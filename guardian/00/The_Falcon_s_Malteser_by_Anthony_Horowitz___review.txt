I have always enjoyed reading Anthony Horowitz books; therefore, I decided to 
read The Falcon’s Malteser, which is part of the Diamond Brothers series.

This spectacular book is about a Private Detective, Herbert, and his younger 
brother Nick. A dwarf came to their office and asked them to look after a box 
of Maltesers, ‘on their life’ and not to open it. What can be so special about 
a box of Maltesers? Little did they know the mystery behind it and they both 
find themselves in a lot of trouble.

I really liked this plot as it had a lot of detail and description and it was 
an action and adventure story, which is my favourite genre. However, even if 
the readers don’t particularly enjoy this genre, I am almost certain that they 
will not be able to put this book down due to its amazing storyline.

I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 10 because it is a very 
interesting plot, which is reasonably easy to understand, including some very 
dramatic and adventurous twists and turns.
