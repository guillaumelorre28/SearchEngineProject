Andreas Whittam Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andreas-whittam-smith>
 is standing down as president of the British Board of Film Classification on 
July 31 after four years in charge.

Mr Whittam Smith was appointed ninth president of the BBFC in 1997, succeeding 
Lord Harewood. He decided to step down after being made first church estates 
commissioner.

Mr Whittam Smith said, "I will be very sorry to leave the BBFC as I have 
enjoyed my time as its president very much." He also expressed his hope that 
classification in Britain would in time be advisory, as it is in most of Europe.

His presidency has been marked on the positive side by a marked drive to 
consult real public opinion on film classification, resulting generally in more 
relaxed censorship, especially of sex scenes.

The BBFC says his successor will be chosen by open competition, although it is 
likely that the government will exercise some influence over the decision.
