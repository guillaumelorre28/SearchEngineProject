Aldershot have confirmed the appointment of Kevin Dillon as their new manager. 
TheLeague Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> club had 
been managerless since Gary Waddock left to take over at Wycombe last month and 
have handed Dillon, 49, a two-year contract.

The former Southampton full-back Jason Dodd was in caretaker charge for four 
games – including Saturday's FA Cup win over Bury – but the Shots moved for 
Dillon after Dodd accepted a job at Southampton's academy.

Dillon was assistant manager to both Alan Pardew and Steve Coppell at Reading 
until he left at the end of last season. His first game in charge of Aldershot 
will be at home to Macclesfield on Saturday.

The club's acting chairman, John Leppard, said: "We went through the interview 
process last week and were impressed with the quality of applicants. Kevin's 
organisational qualities and professionalism was head and shoulders above the 
rest.

"He has done extensive research regarding the club and has watched the team 
play on a number of occasions. The whole appointment is a progressive move for 
the club and we are delighted to have Kevin on board as our new manager."
