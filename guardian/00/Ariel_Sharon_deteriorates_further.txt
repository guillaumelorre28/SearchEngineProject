The medical condition of Israel's former prime minister Ariel Sharon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ariel-sharon> is deteriorating further and 
only a miracle can stop the decline, the head of the hospital treating him said.

Dr Zeev Rotstein, director of the Sheba medical centre near Tel Aviv, said the 
comatose Sharon remained in a life-threatening condition.

"Unless there is a turn on the level of a miracle, his condition will get 
worse and worse from day to day," Rotstein told reporters at the hospital.

He said that while doctors had managed to stabilise some of Sharon's bodily 
functions, several vital organs, including his kidneys, were still in a decline.

Sharon, 85, has been in a coma for eight years after a devastating stroke 
incapacitated him at the peak of his political power.The hospital announced 
last week his health had dramatically worsened

Sharon was one of Israel's most controversial figures and his career stretched 
across the nation's 65-year history. As a politician, he became known as "the 
bulldozer" â€“ a man contemptuous of his critics while also capable of getting 
things done. He was elected prime minister in 2001.
