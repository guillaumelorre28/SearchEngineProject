The Consumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts Concluded Away from 
Business Premises) Regulations 1987 provide consumers with a seven-day cooling 
off period when they sign a contract to buy goods or services worth more than 
Â£35 from a trader during an unsolicited visit to their home.

Door-to-door sellers must provide a notice setting out cancellation rights 
before the agreement is signed. Failure to do so makes the agreement 
unenforceable, whether a deposit is paid or not.
