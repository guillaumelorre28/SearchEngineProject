Terminally ill Canberra residents will be allowed to use marijuana to ease 
their pain if a proposal by the ACT Greens is adopted.


Shane Rattenbury, a member of the ACT legislative assembly, has released draft 
legislation and a discussion paper for legalising medical cannabis.

But he will need support from either the Labor government or the Liberal 
opposition to get it through the territory's legislature.

Rattenbury is hoping community feedback over the next couple of months will 
help sway the major parties.

"This is an issue that can invite a knee-jerk response," he said. However, he 
said he was keen to have a sensible debate on the issue.

Under the proposal, the drug could be used by residents who are expected to 
die within a year, those with chronic illnesses such as cancer or Aids, and 
those whose doctors say cannabis could mitigate symptoms of continuing medical 
conditions.

Anyone wanting to use the drug would have to get a medical declaration from 
their doctor and apply for a one-year usage permit from the chief health 
officer.

The health officer would also issue permits to allow people to grow small 
amounts of cannabis for their personal use.

People convicted of a drug offence within five years could not apply.

The scheme is similar to one proposed by a NSW parliamentary committee in 2013 
and does not set up any system for selling the drug or government quality 
control.

Rattenbury is taking feedback on his proposal until 15 September and is 
confident the Canberra community will support the scheme out of compassion for 
the sick.

"Let's pass this legislation for the benefit of people who do have a terminal 
illness or suffer from chronic pain," he said.

Rattenbury is a minister with the minority Labor government but is proposing 
to introduce the bill as a private member.
