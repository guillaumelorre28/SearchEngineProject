Police were called to a youth detention centre in Victoria on Thursday to help 
quell an alleged riot.

A police spokeswoman said officers were called to Malmsbury youth justice 
centre, 100km north of Melbourne, at 1.50pm on reports that “detainees have 
locked themselves in a secure yard and are making trouble”.

A spokeswoman from the Department of Human Services said the unrest involved 
six detainees, and staff were working to resolve it. She said the perimeter of 
the facility remained secure.

It is the second disruption in a Victorian youth detention centre in four 
days, after 20 detainees tried to break out of a secure area at Parkville youth 
justice centre. Sevenreportedly climbed inside the roof cavity

to control the situation.

According to the state opposition, there have been 28 clashes at Victorian 
youth justice facilities in the past 12 months.

Last month the Andrews government responded to ongoing riots at Malmbury and 
Parkville by transferring a number of young people to a specially designated 
unit of Barwon maximum-security prison, dubbed the Grevillea unit.

The government won an appeal against a supreme court decision

 that found the holding of children in an adult jail unlawful, and the youth 
services minister, Jenny Mikakos, said riots had caused so much damage at 
Parkville that 70 beds – about half of all those available – were now unusable.

She also said children would have to be double-bunked if they could not be put 
in the new Grevillea unit, and wascriticised for saying that would increase the 
risk they would be raped or assaulted in detention
