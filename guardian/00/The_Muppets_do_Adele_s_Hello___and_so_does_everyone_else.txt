Last night, amid the chaos of the AMAs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2015/nov/22/american-music-awards-2015-justin-bieber-taylor-swift-one-direction-live>
 (like Gigi Hadid’s new bob and whatever happenedbetween Meghan Trainor and 
Charlie Puth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/23/american-music-awards-meghan-trainor-taylor-swift-one-direction>
), the Muppets delivered a gift we didn’t know we needed.


Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog re-enacted Hello by Adele

Which, in retrospect, makes sense. This year, Piggy and Kermit announced their 
breakup 
<http://www.people.com/article/miss-piggy-kermit-breakup-divorce-muppets> after 
a decades-long romance, so the stage has been set for an emotional response for 
more than a few months. Also, nobody tackles breakups musically like Adele, and 
since Kermit has allegedly alreadymoved on to Denise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/01/kermit-denise-muppets-miss-piggy>
 (ugh), it’s safe to assume that Piggy’s been taking advantage of 25since its 
release on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2015/nov/20/adele-25-review-tell-us-what-you-think-of-the-album>
. (Or maybe even before: girlfriend’s a legend in the entertainment industry, 
so an advanced listen wouldn’t be out of the question.)

But while Piggy’s stirring rendition of the power anthem articulated our own 
feelings about the end of Kermit and his longtime love,The Muppets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-muppets> are hardly the first to have 
jumped on the Adele marketing train over the last couple of weeks. (Just don’t 
tell Piggy this – she deserves to feel empowered and beautifully windswept for 
as long as humanly and/or pig-ably possible.) Observe:

What happens when Adele goes undercover to audition as an Adele impersonator? 
We found out last week on her BBC special, when she disguised herself as Jenny. 
(And, for the record, this is a reality TV series we would all totally watch.)

James Corden and Billy Eichner’s A Lonely Halloween

The sepia tone, the outdated cellphone, the reflections on memories past: 
through all of these things, James Corden and Billy Eichner tapped into our 
thirst for painful memories to remind us that we’re all too old to 
trick-or-treat (or even dress up, TBH).

And if you can read this, JJ Abrams, please include this song in the upcoming 
Star Wars soundtrack.

Because honestly there aren’t enough jokes about Adele’s flip phone in the 
world – nor are there enough crossovers between Hello and Hotline Bling for us 
to be truly pop-culturally satisfied. (And hi, Lionel Richie!)

But how dare we assume Hello is a song reserved solely for romantic endings. 
In their parody of The Greatest Song Ever™, Rob Riggle and Ken Jeong work out 
their feelings about the NFL, its losing teams, and its losing teams’ racist, 
racist names. (Surprise twist: even NFL commentators approve.)

save us from our families this year? (Spoiler: thanks, Adele.)

Sir David Attenborough narrates Hello

Even Adele’s voice is no match for esteemed broadcaster Sir David 
Attenborough, who narrates the video in velvety fashion and comments on 
everything from its murky visuals to Adele’s communication methods. “She hasn’t 
upgraded her handset since 1999 - hashtag flip phone!” he marvels, officially 
making hashtags seem legitimate for the first time in their short lives.
