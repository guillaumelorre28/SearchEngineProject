News that Europe was stuck firmly in recession took the shine off markets, but 
the leading faller was hit by more specific concerns.

Engineering consultancy Amec, which serves the mining, oil and gas, nuclear 
and renewable energy industry, fell more than 7% after a cautious outlook 
statement. The company said full year earnings rose 11% to £331m, helped by 
strong performances from the UK north sea, gulf of Mexico and contract wins in 
the middle east. But it added:
 In 2013 Amec expects low-to-mid digit revenue growth for the group on an 
underlying basis, excluding procurement. A strong conventional oil and gas 
performance across the board and more modest growth in the clean energy and 
environment and infrastructure markets in the Americas are expected to offset 
reduced oil sands revenue and softening demand in the mining market, and in 
Australia more generally. 
It also appeared to signal the end of its share purchasing programme, buying 
back £403m worth of shares at an average cost of £10.70 per share. Andrew 
Whittock at Liberum Capital issued a hold recommendation, saying:
 Margin guidance looks disappointing so forecasts will come back a little. 
This, and the apparent halt of the buyback programme, could be unhelpful but we 
expect to retain our neutral view on the shares. 
Its shares dropped 82p to £10.42, making it the biggest faller in a downbeat 
FTSE 100. The leading index lost 31.75 points to 6327.36, as investors cashed 
in after four days of rises. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital 
Spreads, said:
 A reality check was given to investors after a load of dreadful GDP figures 
were released across Europe with France, Germany, Holland and Portugal all 
seeing their economies shrink more than had been expected. This was enough to 
get anyone slightly nervous and press the sell button to bank some profit 
following the [recent] impressive gains. The fact that the engine of European 
growth, namely Germany, had seen its economy suffer badly in the last quarter 
of 2012 acted as a reminder that no one is immune to the eurozone debt crisis. 
Shire slipped 118p to £20.27 as competition worries outweighed a 4% rise in 
the pharmaceutical group's fourth quarter earnings.

Carnival closed 75p lower at £25 after the cruise company announced - after 
the UK market closed on Wednesday - a higher than expected hit from voyage 
disruptions and repair costs of $0.08 to $0.10 a share.

But Rio Tinto rose 11.5p to 3745.5p despite announcing its first full year 
loss, a massive $3bn. New chief executive Sam Walsh said he would cut costs, 
sell weaker assets and spend capital more carefully.

Following Wednesday's figures, Tullow Oil slipped 20p to £12.40.

Aberdeen Asset Management added 10.4p to 426.4p after it paid $175m in cash 
for US asset management firm Artio Global Investors, and agreed to take a 50.1% 
stake in private equity business SVG Advisors for £17.5m.SVG Capital, the 
current owner of Advisors, jumped 21.6p to 368.4p, helped by a 16% rise in its 
net asset value per share to 391p.

Next ended 50p higher at £41.82 after analysts at HSBC moved from neutral to 
overweight and raised their target price from £41 to £49.65. The bank said it 
expected online to make up two thirds of clothing and footwear sales by 2020 
driven by M-commerce, adding:
 We focus on stocks with high online revenue exposure and low sensitivity to 
bricks and mortar channels to market.

Elsewhere Finnish miner Talvivaara fell 2.75 to 86.5p after it said it wanted 
to raise €260m in a rights issue to reduce debt and keep its nickel mine 
running after recent water leaks.\
