 When Anita Roddick burst on to the business scene, taking her Body Shop chain 
to the stock market in 1984, the City had never seen - or heard - anything like 
her. The arrival of a woman who looked like a hippy and talked passionately 
about the environment and ethical trading came as a serious shock.
As one of the first female chief executives of a listed company, she was 
openly contemptuous of the City and its focus on the bottom line, believing 
that business had a responsibility to consider its impact on society, from 
civil rights to recycling.

Dame Anita made environmental protection a cornerstone of the company's ethos 
20 years before big retailers such as Tesco and Marks & Spencer started to 
emphasise their eco-credentials.

She also waged a vocal campaign against animal testing, forcing rivals to 
follow Body Shop's lead. The business now operates more than 2,000 stores 
worldwide in 50 separate markets.

By the early 1990s the shares had soared and the company was valued at £900m. 
But by the mid-90s profits growth had slowed. Last year she agreed to sell out 
to cosmetics group L'Oréal in a deal that valued Body Shop at £650m and 
generated £118m for the Roddick family. She insisted that she would be able to 
encourage L'Oréal to use more fair trade raw materials.

As for her fortune, she sought to give it all away. She recently declared it 
was "a joy" to be giving away £3m a year, and had lost none of her lifelong 
passion for campaigns and worthy causes.
