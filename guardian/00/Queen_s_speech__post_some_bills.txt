The Queen's speech <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/queens-speech> 
tomorrow will set out the legislative agenda for the new session of parliament. 
It is a politically crucial moment for the government, and decisions over what 
to put in or leave out would have been the subject of months of wrangling. 
Furthermore, with the general election due by June next year at the latest, 
Gordon Brown and his ministers have little time to ensure all theirdesired 
legislation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/16/whats-in-the-queens-speech> 
reaches the statute book.

Nick Clegg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/16/scrap-queens-speech-says-clegg>
 has called for it to be scrapped;David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/17/cameron-brown-queens-speech> 
claims it will be "shamlessley self-serving". But if you could add one piece of 
legislation to the Queen's speech, what would it be and why?
