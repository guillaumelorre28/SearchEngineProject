Being away from home can be tough at any time of the year, and it’s 
particularly difficult during the festive season. Every year many aid workers 
spend Christmas away from loved ones, so how do you plan to mark the holiday? 
Are you recreating your favourite family traditions? Decorating a DIYChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> tree? Or are you spreading 
the yuletide love by adapting to local customs and celebrations?

However you plan to create that festive feeling, we want to hear from you. 
Please send us your pictures and stories by Monday 19 December using 
GuardianWitness, and you may be featured on the Global Development 
Professionals Network.
