The defending champion, Rafael Nadal, gave a statement of intent with a 
thumping 6-2, 6-1, 6-3 victory over the AmericanAndy Roddick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-roddick> at the US Open to set up yet 
another grand slam semi-final with Andy Murray.

Nadal went into the match without having dropped a set in the tournament but 
there were still questions about his form, given that none of his previous 
opponents had been seeded.

Roddick had beaten the fifth seed, David Ferrer, in the fourth round and had 
looked in good form but he was simply blown away by the power and accuracy of 
his opponent.

It was an aggressive performance from Nadal, perhaps thinking about saving 
energy with a third match in three days to follow on Saturday.

The Spaniard was on the front foot from the off, breaking Roddick in the 
opening game and reeling off four in a row before the American, who was being 
passed time and again at the net, finally got on the board.

The pattern repeated itself in the second set, with Nadal getting off to a 
flying start, and this time he broke the big-serving American three times.

The second seed's charge was held up briefly when Roddick took a medical 
time-out to have his thighs massaged but by that point Nadal was 3-0 up in the 
third set and cruising.

A comeback never looked on the cards and Nadal wrapped up a convincing victory 
with his 35th winner of the match.
