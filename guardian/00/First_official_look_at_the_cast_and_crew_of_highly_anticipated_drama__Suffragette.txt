Given the popularity of a recent Twitter campaign which used the hashtag 
#filmherstory to demand more films centred on important female characters from 
history 
<http://www.pajiba.com/popular/twitter-has-spoken-filmherstory-demands-more-female-protagonists.php>
, the upcoming British drama Suffragette will be aiming to prove this to be a 
commercially lucrative proposition.

The film stars Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter as early footsoldiers 
of the feminist movement. Meryl Streep also has a small role as Emmeline 
Pankhurst, the celebrated political activist who helped women win the right to 
vote. The film has already made headlines for beingthe first time a commercial 
crew has been allowed to shoot inside the Houses of Parliament
