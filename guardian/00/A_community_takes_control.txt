In 2008, most of Chamwino was without access to safe water. Forced to drink 
from the local stream, 60% of children in school were urinating blood, a 
symptom of bilharzia, a water-borne disease that impairs cognitive development. 
"The municipal council provided no water and no funding," explains Victor 
Mulimila, acting director of the Faraja Trust Fund. "They said that Chamwino 
was a slum, an informal settlement, so it was not their responsibility to 
provide water."

With support from the International Childcare Trust, Faraja bought pipes, and 
the community dug a 3.5km trench to install four water points. Bilharzia has 
been largely eliminated as a result. Faraja then facilitated the election of a 
water committee to represent the community at the municipal council, giving 
them a voice where previously they had none.

This participatory approach has not always been embraced by the development 
community. In 2000 the World Bank made vital debt relief for Tanzania 
conditional upon the rapid privatisation of parts of the water system, a reform 
undertaken without meaningful public participation or consultation. The 
consideration given to the poor, Action Aid reported, was "paltry and 
tokenistic compared to the scale of unmet need". Such examples are not uncommon 
in Tanzania.

This is development undertaken at a distance from the people, under the 
pretence that some day the benefits will drip down. Faraja's approach is 
different. "This was a project," Mulimila explains, "designed to put control 
back in the hands of the community."
