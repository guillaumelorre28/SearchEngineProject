With the European Central Bank not impressing the market and the results of 
the latest bank stress tests revealed, financial stocks came under renewed 
pressure.

It was not just the banking sector either. Investors are also worried about 
the exposure of insurers to the beleagured eurozone.Aviva lost 9.8p to 314.2p 
after Exane BNP Paribas downgraded the company from outperform to neutral. 
Analyst Andy Hughes saidAviva 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/avivabusiness> could have recorded £811m 
of losses in Italy, mainly on government bond movements, and suggested the 
company could "hand back the keys of its Italian operations to their partners." 
He said:
 These [Italian] losses could be reversed out leading to a gain on disposal. 
This, despite giving away the business for zero on a local statutory basis in 
an extreme economic scenario. We still see upside in Aviva's valuation, but 
have cut our rating given our below consensus earnings forecasts and this level 
of sovereign sensitivity which increases risk within the business. 
Among the banks, Lloyds Banking Group lost 2.005p to 25.08p while Royal Bank 
of Scotland fell 1.22p to 20.92p after the European Banking Authority found a 
€114.4bn capital shortfall across all of Europe's banks, up from €106.5bn in 
October. Adding to the nervousness ahead of Friday's summit, the ECB failed to 
unveil increased bond purchases to help alleviate the crisis, which some 
optimists had been hoping for.

All this helped push the FTSE 100 down 63.14 points lower to 5483.77, with 
European markets down around 2% and Wall Street around 120 points lower by the 
the time London closed. Italian bond yields soared by 0.45 basis points to 
6.5%, while Spanish and French yields also moved higher.

GKN fell 6.5p to 183.4p after Credit Suisse downgraded the engineering group 
from outperform to neutral. It also cutIMI, 34.5p lower at 737p, from neutral 
to underperform.

Safe havens were in demand, with British American Tobacco 45.5p better at 
£30.15 andGlaxoSmithkline 12p higher at £14.40.

Among the mid-caps Ashtead added 25.7p to 211.7p after the equipment hire 
group reported a strong first half, but Imperial Leather soap groupPZ Cussons 
slid 36p to 308.7p following a profit warning, partly due to rising raw 
material costs and adverse exchange rate movements. Panmure Gordon said:
 Despite strong top line growth in the core markets of the UK, Nigeria and 
Indonesia, PZ's profits in the half have been below expectation due to the 
combination of continuing high raw material costs and very difficult trading 
conditions in Australia (retail environment) and in smaller markets of Greece 
(economy), Thailand (floods) and the Middle East (social unrest). We are 
reducing our earnings per share forecast for the full-year by 8% from 17.8p to 
16.3p and cut our 12-month price target from 380p to 355p. 
Lower down the market Bango, the mobile payments company, jumped 12p to 68.5p 
after unveiling a deal with Amazon. Mark James at Liberum Capital said:
 Bango has signed an agreement to provide services to Amazon (presumably to 
enable mobile billing for the Amazon portal). I would expect that to be very 
well received - it should help reverse some of the disappointment with recent 
results. 
Beowulf Mining, which has a number of iron ore projects in Sweden, has begun 
drilling at the north end of its Kallak licence area, with a second rig due to
