Now the weather's starting to bite, there are few things more pleasing than a 
warming fish stew. I use monkfish here but john dory and halibut are both 
robust enough to work. The stew is lovely with the last of the season's 
courgettes and can be spiced up with chilli.

Fish stew with samphire

Serves four

1 courgette, sliced
75 ml olive oil
2 cloves garlic, sliced
1 shallot finely sliced
4 tomatoes, de-seeded and halved
500ml of fish or vegetable stock
400g monkfish, cut into 8 pieces
200g tin of cannellini beans
50g samphire
1 tbsp basil, chopped
Pinch of salt

Wash and slice the courgette and leave to one side.

Put half of the olive oil into a pan with the garlic and shallot and saute on 
a medium heat for 2 minutes.

Add the courgette and tomato, season and saute for 3 minutes. Add the stock 
and simmer for 5 minutes until it thickens slightly. Remove from the heat and 
leave to one side.

Put the remaining olive oil into a pan on medium heat. Add the fish, season 
and saute for 3-5 minutes. Add the vegetables to the pan, add the drained beans 
and let everything simmer together for 3 minutes. Check seasoning, add the 
samphire and basil and serve.
