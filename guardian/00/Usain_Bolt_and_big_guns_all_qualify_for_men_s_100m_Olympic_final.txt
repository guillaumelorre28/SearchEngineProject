Usain Bolt <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usainbolt> strolled to his 
expected place in the men's 100m final but will know he faces big competition 
if he is to retain his Olympic title.

Bolt won his heat in 9.87sec ahead of the American Ryan Bailey (9.96) with 
Britain'sDwain Chambers <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dwain-chambers> 
missing out in fourth place (10.05), but it was the performance of Justin 
Gatlin in the opening heat, which the American won in 9.82, that caught the eye.

In the first of the three heats that saw the first two men directly qualify 
along with the two fastest losers from all three heats, Gatlin stormed home in 
9.82sec, and was joined in direct qualification for the final by the Dutchman 
Churandy Martina, who pipped Jamaica'sAsafa Powell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asafapowell> on the line to claim a surprise 
second place. Powell later qualified as one of the fastest losers along with 
Trinidad's Richard Thompson. Britain's James Dasaolu finished seventh in 10.18 
to bow out.

Jamaica's Yohan Blake <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yohan-blake> won the 
third heat in 9.85 with America's Tyson Gay second in 9.90. Adam Gemili, 
Britain's 18-year-old hope, came third in 10.06.

"It wasn't really there, I'm happy with the time though," said Gemili 
afterwards. "The start cost me a lot, I came third in the semi-final at the 
Olympics, it's great really. I've shown people that I am coming through and I 
can get better and better."

Chambers said afterwards: "I wanted to do well and get to the final but I am 
happy to be here. It was worth it, I am glad to have been in this atmosphere. I 
thought I had Bolt on 60m, but I ran out of petrol. He was flying!"
