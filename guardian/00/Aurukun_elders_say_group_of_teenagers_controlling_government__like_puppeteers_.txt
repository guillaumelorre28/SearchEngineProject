Aurukun elders have lashed out at the Queensland government’s decision to shut 
the community’s only school until July

, accusing it of abandoning the school’s 300-odd students.

The Wik Women’s Group accuses the government of letting itself be controlled 
by the actions of 10 to 15 lawless teenagers after a decision to close the 
school until the start of term three in response to ongoing violence.

The school’s principal, Scott Fatnowa, has been carjacked twice in two weeks

 and a group of children, some as young as six, were involved in a series of 
targeted attacks near the teachers’ accommodation on Tuesday night.

“We have 10 to 15 teenagers controlling the government like puppeteers,” the 
group said in a statement.

“These teens have worked out that they can carjack the school principal and 
control the town.”

The last of the school’s 20 or so teachers are being evacuated from the 
community on Thursday due to concerns for their safety.

The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/annastacia-palaszczuk>, will fly to 
the community on Friday to attend a community meeting called by the mayor, 
Dereck Walpo.

Meanwhile, an extra four police will be deployed to the community, adding to 
the five extra officers sent there after the first attack on the principal.

But the elders said the decision to close the school would deprive children in 
the community of their right to an education.

“We are mothers in shock that our children, high-achieving children, will be 
deprived of schooling for the next five weeks,” they said.

“Solving a problem with 15 disengaged youths by disengaging another 300 
children from school is a recipe for disaster.” .

The women placed the blame for the violence at the foot of police, saying they 
had turned a blind eye to problemslike sly grog

 for too long.

“They have set a climate for lawlessness,” they said. “Police need to do their 
job. This is a policing problem and we need a policing solution.”
