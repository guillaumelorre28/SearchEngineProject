Your body is a percussive instrument, and body percussion is about hitting and 
slapping yourself in a rhythmic way. It's rooted in South African culture and 
was a means of communicating when miners were not allowed to speak to each 
other. Bodies are like a drum kit. I use my hands, legs and feet, which become 
the bass drum.

Hitting a drum can raise endorphin levels; using your body as percussion does 
the same, yet it's a different feeling, because you're more in-tune with the 
material of your body.

I am happy, truly happy. It doesn't mean I have to go round smiling all day - 
I still cry, get upset - but there is a balance within that enables me to be 
happy when the world is spinning off its axis. Detachment and forgiveness are 
key: a person's unhappiness is often linked to something they choose not to let 
go of, be it a memory, a fear of the future, an addiction or a daily worry. Be 
grateful. Let go.

Every day I pray with my husband and 18-month toddler - I ground myself when I 
say prayers. I eat good food, and I don't drink alcohol - it never brought me 
happiness. I avoid things that make me feel burdened, accept tests and deal 
with them with logic and prayer. I watch films that make me feel good. I listen 
to music that feeds my soul.

There's body percussion, but there's also raw chocolate, the sound of rain, 
being still, dancing ...
