"Pandora and I are in love! It is official! She told Claire Nelson, who told 
Nigel, who told me. I told Nigel to tell Claire to tell Pandora that I return 
her love. I am over the moon with joy. I can overlook the fact that Pandora 
smokes five Benson and Hedges a day and has her own lighter. When you are in 
love such things cease to matter."

Join us for a very special Christmas Book Club with Sue Townsend, who will be 
talking to John Mullan aboutThe Secret Diary of Adrian Mole aged 13¾ 
<http://www.adrianmole.com/>. It's 1981: Margaret Thatcher is in power, the 
Falklands War is around the corner and Prince Charles and Lady Diana are 
getting married. But teenaged Adrian has other things to worry about: pimples, 
a drunk pet dog, his stuck up girlfriend, his parents' marital troubles and the 
BBC's repeated refusal to broadcast his poetry. This painfully honest, funny 
and moving novel launched a hugely popular series – eight diaries and counting 
– and introduced us to one of the most beloved characters in British fiction.
