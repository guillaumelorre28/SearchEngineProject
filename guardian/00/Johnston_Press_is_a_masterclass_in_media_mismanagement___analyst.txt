Before the EU referendum, and the consequent collapse in media stock prices, 
media analyst Jim Chisholm took a long, hard look at the state of the UK 
regional publisher,Johnston Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnstonpress>.

His report, A master class in media mismanagement 
<http://www.jimchisholm.net/media-mismanagement/>, will surely make for 
uncomfortable reading for the company’s chief executive, Ashley Highfield, and 
all the staff employed across its 280 or so titles.

At the time of writing, Johnston Press’s share price had just fallen below 
30p, a fifth of what it had been the year before and an all-time low (until its 
current post-Brexit plunge to 15p).

Accepting that the publisher’s problems are hardly unique, Chisholm argues 
that it has performed much worse than its rivals. His key points:

 * From 1988 onwards, JP acquired declining businesses with no clear strategy, 
other than, to quote the then chief executive, Tim Bowdler,“local papers can 
beat off the challenge of the web” 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tim-bowdler-meet-the-real-king-of-the-regional-press-industry-412709.html>
. 
 * The acquisitions were stripped of the expertise and intellect that could 
have defined a road to recovery, a move lauded by the City because JP realised 
operating profits in excess of 30%. 
 * Bowdler departed in 2009 and was replaced by John Fry. Two years later, he 
went and Ashley Highfield became CEO. He adopted a digital strategy but it is 
failing – in product, in audience and in revenue. 
Chisholm then details JP’s failure to deal with decline as well as its 
competitors, notablyTrinity Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/trinity-mirror>. It has suffered, he writes, 
larger circulation declines, lower digital engagement and lower digital 
advertising revenues

The results have been clear from the company’s falling share price. In 2014, 
Highfield preferred toextol the virtues of JP’s market captalisation

 and predicted that“the worst is over for the regional press” 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/11194988/Johnston-Press-chief-Ashley-Highfield-says-worst-is-over-for-local-papers.html>
. A year later, writes Chisholm, “JP’s market cap had halved.”

Chisholm writes: “One question that preoccupies us mere observers is why 
Highfield is still heading a media business which seems to be underperforming 
against any peer benchmark, and in particular one with particularly low digital 
credentials.”

As for the effect of this continuous decline on staff, Chisholm believes JP 
sees journalists as “an expendable commodity”, so “it is not surprising that 
staff morale is the lowest in the industry.”


But he concludes by pointing to “one great asset” in Johnston Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press>, “a white knight, hidden 
within the JP board”: Kjell Aamot, one its non-executive directors.

He is, claims Chisholm, “an iconic legend among leaders in the global 
newspaper industry”. In his 20 years as CEO of the Norwegian media company, 
Schibsted, he transformed the company into a global player and proved to be a 
true digital visionary.

According to Chisholm, Aamot is inspiring, beloved by his staff and has trust. 
“If I were a leading shareholder in JP,” he concludes, “I’d invite Kjell out 
for lunch, and simply ask: ‘What the hell do we do now?’”

 * This piece was edited on 13 July to remove some incorrect remarks. The 
first of these stated that Johnston Press had sent “regularly misleading 
messages to the City”. I did not intend to suggest that Johnston Press had 
provided misleading financial information to the City, or that there had been 
any dishonest or criminal conduct on the part of Johnston Press in regards to 
statements about its financial position.
In addition, I included a quote to the effect that Johnston Press’s outsourced 
national sales agency, Mediaforce was “surprised” by Johnston Press’s 
acquisition of the i. Mediaforce has never suggested that it was surprised by 
the acquisition of the i, or that there was a lack of consultation with 
Johnston Press over the acquisition. I also acknowledge that the piece 
contained unsupported claims which were not put to Johnston Press. I apologise 
to both Johnston Press and Mediaforce for having included the above remarks.
