He said it felt “mystifying” to receive the honour, and was awestruck to be 
introduced by Aacta president and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush.

“[Rush] is an actor. I only play one character,” Hogan told media at the 
presentation inSydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>.

“Crocodile Dundee started out as a sketch – it was supposed to be Hoges in New 
York, a fluke,” he said, describing his most famous role.

Cate Blanchett was last year’s recipient of the award
