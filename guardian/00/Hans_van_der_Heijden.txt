Hans van der Heijden is a partner in the Rotterdam based architectsÃª practice 
BIQ. The practice was founded in 1994 and has worked on a range of different 
housing projects. BIQ works in both the new build and the renovation sector and 
as a result many commissions are directed to redevelopment areas. Recently, the 
workload has expanded towards commercial and cultural tasks.

One of the first projects of BIQ was an award-winning scheme in the bi-annual 
Europan-4 competition for young European architects. This design for the 
conversion of two domestic buildings and landscape works in Liverpool lead to 
the firm's first design commission outside the Netherlands in 1996.

New commissions, teaching posts, publications, lectures and research 
contributions in the UK, Spain and Switzerland followed. BIQ was awarded the 
first prize for a design of a mixed-use development in Birkenhead in April of 
this year.

Projects and writing by BIQ have been published in international magazines 
including De Architect, Archis, Oase, Bouw, A+T, Arq andArchitecture

van der Heijden teaches at Delft and Liverpool University.
