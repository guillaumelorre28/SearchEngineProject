Sniffin' Glue wasn't the first fanzine – Punk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/punk> (which famously coined the genre's 
moniker) started self-publishing in New York six months earlier – but its 
primitive Xerox'n'Sellotape aesthetic was the perfect medium to capture British 
punk's early energy, and to inspire a generation of copyists.

Founded by bank clerk Mark Perry, aided by friends Danny Baker and Steve 
Micalef, its first cover boasted (in felt-tip scrawl) stories on the Ramones 
and Blue Öyster Cult. Soon, however, Sniffin' Glue was offering grass-roots 
reportage on British punk's first flowering, while also lambasting the Clash 
for signing to the major label CBS. Sniffin' Glue was primitive but 
opinionated, offering a crucial alternative voice to the mainstream music 
papers (most of which were late to cover punk's rise) at a time when none was 
available.

Though Sniffin' Glue never actually printed the legendary instructions often 
ascribed to it – "This is a chord. This is another. This is a third. Now form a 
band" – (that was Sideburns, another punk zine from 1977), its example spawned 
a slew of followers – including Jamming!, Burnt Offering and Chainsaw (which 
featured ribald cartoons from a young Andrew Marr) – and established a culture 
of DIY underground rock criticism that thrives to this day, both in print and 
online. Perry, meanwhile, ended Sniffin' Glue in 1977 after 12 issues, 
concentrating on his own punk group, Alternative TV.
