.

Clooney and Heslov's new project is said to be based on an as-yet-unpublished 
piece by Joshuah Bearman, whose 2007 Wired article"How the CIA Used a Fake 
Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran" 
<http://www.wired.com/magazine/2007/04/feat_cia/> inspired their Iran hostage 
crisis thriller. The new film, called Coronado High, will apparently focus on a 
group of teenage drug smugglers operating in the small town of Coronado, San 
Diego, near the Mexican border. Clooney, Heslov and Bearman have yet to comment 
on the production.

In the meantime, the two producers are following their Argo success with The 
Monuments Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/05/matt-damon-george-clooney-monument>
 â€“ another historical thriller, this time about the Monuments, Fine Arts and 
Archives programme, an Allied group responsible for saving culturally important 
items from destruction by the Nazis during the second world war. Matt Damon and 
Cate Blanchett have signed on to star in the movie, which will be directed by 
Clooney and is based on the bookThe Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves 
and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History
