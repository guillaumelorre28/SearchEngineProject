Adrien Brody this week signed to star in a romantic comedy opposite Lindsay 
Lohan <https://www.theguardian.com/film/lindsay-lohan>, a rare commitment since 
the low-profile actor won the Oscar in 2003 for The Pianist.

Speechless, formerly known as The Guided Man, centres on a shy man who uses 
another person to speak for him when he is asked to give a speech at a wedding.

Brody has picked his roles carefully since he lost 30lbs in six weeks to play 
Holocaust survivor Wladyslaw Szpilman in Roman Polanski's epic. His only 
starring role since the Academy Award has been opposite Keira Knightley in John 
Maybury's 2005 psychothriller The Jacket.

Apart from that the only evidence of his acting career has been a smattering 
of ensemble parts in the likes of M Night Shyamalan's The Village and Peter 
Jackson's King Kong remake.

He is currently in Spain shooting the bullfighting drama Manolete with 
Penelope Cruz, and recently completed work on the murder mystery Hollywoodland 
with Diane Lane and Ben Affleck.

Meanwhile Lohan has shown a taste for the low-key of late, eschewing the kind 
of studio fare that made her famous, such as Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, in 
favour of independent projects.

Upcoming releases include Robert Altman's ensemble musical A Prairie Home 
Companion, the John Lennon assassination drama Chapter 27, and the Robert 
Kennedy assassination drama Bobby.
