Visibly holding back tears, Vikander admitted to being in a total blur: “I’m 
still trying to remember anything that happened in the last five minutes!”

She recalling how she and her mother used to wake up at 2am in Sweden every 
year when she was young, to watch the ceremony.“This is a celebration of film 
and the people behind it. I’m just honored to be a part of this tonight.”

Vikander, a former dancer, first broke out in the 2012 Oscar-nominated Danish 
period romance A Royal Affair. She’s since appeared in mostly English-language 
features, including Anna Karenina, Ex Machina, The Man From UNCLE andThe Danish 
Girl <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-danish-girl>. “I never thought, back 
home, that I’d do films in English,” she said. “[I thought] if I could continue 
to work that would be great.”

Vikander is next to be seen opposite Michael Fassbender in drama The Light 
Between Oceans and Matt Damon in Jason Bourne.
