The return of Gotham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/06/gotham-tv-series-imagines-city-before-batman>
 in the US on Monday night is the starting gun for 2015’s autumn/winter spandex 
collection, a swarm of brand-new and returning comic book-related TV shows that 
are either building on previous successes or keen to learn from the mistakes of 
cancelled rivals. Where did we leave all those do-gooders, and who are the new 
ones? Here s a utility-belt-ready primer on the current state of superhero TV 
(including one UK outlier).


Gotham (US: Fox, 21 September; UK: Channel 5, date TBC)

 Before Batman begins … Gotham season two 
Despite a wobbly start, the neo-noir Batman prequel with precious little sign 
of Batman was a solid ratings performer on Fox andChannel 5 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/06/gotham-tv-series-imagines-city-before-batman>
. But the gangland turmoil at the end of season one means there’s a new, rather 
fishy-breathed kingpin in power just as lone white knight Jim Gordon (Ben 
McKenzie) has been demoted to traffic duty. Season two teases the origins of 
notable Batvillains Mr Freeze and Clayface, and sees the return of an 
ashen-faced chap who looks and laughs like a proto-Joker. Notable additions to 
the cast include The Shield’s burly badass Michael Chiklis as a new top cop, 
and reliable Brit baddie James Frain as a nominally philanthropic billionaire 
industrialist, presumably keeping that seat warm until 13-year-old Bruce Wayne 
(David Mazouz) is old enough to take over the role.

Brilliantman! (Sky Arts, 24 September)

In this silent one-off, part of the new physical comedy season on Sky Arts, 
Kevin Eldon plays a mild-mannered council worker with a high-visibility vest, a 
trusty trundle wheel and an enormous secret. When evil forces threaten the 
innocent, he becomes Brilliantman, a DIY superhero with an eye-catching costume 
but very little in the way of special powers or spectacular abilities. Could 
Brilliantman have met his match in the form of a wayward parrot? Johnny Vegas 
co-stars as a grumpy landlady.

Agents of SHIELD (ABC, 29 September; Channel 4, date TBC)

 ‘They built a team to defend the world …’ Agents of SHIELD 
After two seasons of variable quality and a long-gestating Hydra conspiracy 
that ripped the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics 
Division in twain,the Marvel TV spinoff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/agents-of-shield> in which Nick Fury 
occasionally pops his head round the door has a new direction for its third 
season. Interstellar space crystals are randomly transforming civilians into 
superpowered Inhumans. Daisy, SHIELD’s computer whiz-kid mascot who manifested 
Inhuman earthquake powers – from hacker to fracker – heads up a secret team 
tasked with locating and possibly recruiting new Inhumans as they pop up around 
the globe. Meanwhile, Hydra threatens to rise again and Agent Coulson adjusts 
to his new living circumstances after losing more than his pride in the season 
two finale.

 Flash! Ah-ah … 
The Flash box set review: this breezy, upbeat superhero series could run and 
run
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/17/the-flash-box-set-review-upbeat-superhero>
The first season of The Flash was the most buoyant superhero show in recent 
memory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/17/the-flash-box-set-review-upbeat-superhero>
, a zippy, quippy counterpoint to the sulky Arrow. But the cosmic forces that 
young Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) taps into to run really fast have opened up 
some sort of quantum singularity above his hometown of Central City. This means 
we’ll meet Jay Garrick, a Flash from another dimension with a dire warning, and 
presumably lots of new meta-human baddies too. The trailer also seems to 
feature what looks an awful lot like a Flash-signal on top of the police 
station, suggesting a potential overlap between Barry’s CSI career and his 
freelance hero-ing.

Arrow (CW, 7 October; Sky 1, date TBC)

 ‘The Arrow’s dead …’ 
The brooding patient zero of the current superhero TV boom, Arrow begins its 
fourth season with buff bowman Oliver Queen (recent WWE guest star Stephen Amell
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jigRNsCV6Xs>) apparently retired from the 
vigilante game, leaving the rest of Team Arrow to take over his duties in Star 
City. On one hand, this means his longstanding faithful bodyguardDiggle finally 
gets an actual crime-fighting costume, complete with ridiculous helmet 
<http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/09/09/arrow-more-photos-of-diggles-new-costume>
. On the other, it surely can’t be long before Oliver is pulled back in to 
crime-fighting, particularly with the arrival of a new power broker with the 
not-at-all-sinister name of Damien Darhk (Neal McDonough). We’re also promised 
a guest appearance byConstantine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/24/constantine-alas-this-comic-book-exorcist-is-demonically-dull>
 (Matt Ryan), the mouthy magician and demon hunter who had his own series 
cancelled earlier this year.

 Supergirl trailer 
When CBS decided to launch a show starring Superman’s cousin from Krypton, 
they wisely sought out writer/producer Greg Berlanti, the architect behind the 
CW’s successful, self-contained superhero universe of Arrow, The Flash and the 
soon-to-be-launchedLegends of Tomorrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/15/tv-upfronts-the-cw-crazy-ex-girlfriend>
 spin-off. After belatedly crash-landing on Earth, Kara Danvers (played by 
former Glee star Melissa Benoist) has opted to live in her cousin’s shadow, 
forgoing the chance to use her powers to pursue a career in the publishing 
industry. But it’s not long before she gives in to the lure of the supertights, 
balancing Devil Wears Prada-style high jinks with her demanding boss Calista 
Flockhart with battling baddies such as General Zod’s lumbering pal Non. 
Tonally, it doesn’t seem a million miles away from the breezy screwball ofThe 
New Adventures of Superman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/jul/15/cablegirlloisclarkthenew>
 with Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher, and Berlanti has proven himself a creator 
with (heat) vision.

 Jessica Jones trailer 
After the success of Daredevil, the next building block in Netflix’s 
street-level Marvel universe isJessica Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/sep/10/marvels-jessica-jones-first-teaser-for-daredevil-spin-off-on-netflix>
, centred around a former costumed hero who turns her back on the world of 
spandex to become a private investigator. Launching worldwide in November, it 
stars Breaking Bad’s Krysten Ritter as Jones, withDavid Tennant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-tennant> as Zebediah Killgrave – the 
mind-controlling villain known as the Purple Man in Marvel comics – and a key 
supporting role for Mike Colter from The Good Wife as hero-for-hire Luke Cage, 
Jessica’s close pal who will get his own headlining Netflix series in the new 
year.

 Agent Carter’s season one recap. 
Decent but unspectacular ratings for the brief first season of Agent Carter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jul/10/agent-carter-declassified-the-key-facts-about-marvels-1940s-spy-caper>
 – aCaptain America 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-america-the-winter-soldier> spin-off 
set in the late 1940s – meant that the return of karate-chopping English rose 
Peggy (Hayley Atwell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/19/hayley-atwell-doctor-who-agent-carter>
) was no sure thing. But common sense has prevailed, and the expanded 
10-episode season two relocates Peggy and her platonic investigative partner 
Jarvis (James D’Arcy) from New York to LA, seeking out larger-than-life 
evil-doers operating in the Hollywood demi-monde. After a long, rather rude 
delay when no British broadcaster seemed to want to mark Peggy’s dance card, 
the show was belatedly picked up by Fox UK, which recently confirmed it will 
screen season two promptly after it is shown in the US.
