Forget the streaming music service and the software update. Forget Drake’s 
walk-on appearance and The Weeknd’s closing performance. Apple has women! 
Jennifer Bailey and Susan Prescott presented on stage at theApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> Worldwide Developer Conference 
conference on Monday – the first time Apple’s own female executives have 
presented publicly since the event was first held 1976.


It was a major first for a company that has struggled, along with the rest of 
Silicon Valley, with a lack of diversity among its ranks, especially at the top.

Speaking from the Moscone Centre in San Francisco, Bailey, the vice-president 
of Apple Pay, updated the audience on the company’s contactless payment system 
and said it would soon be making its UK debut.

Bailey said “250,000 locations across the United Kingdom are ready to accept 
Apple Pay”, which is a greater number than the initial roll-out in the US. More 
than 70% of credit and debit cards would work with Apple Pay, Bailey said.

Merchants signed up include Boots, Marks and Spencer, and Waitrose. In London, 
commuters will be able to use Apple Pay for tube travel. Passbook is to renamed 
Wallet, and will allow users to store card information for easier transactions.

Prescott, Apple’s vice-president, also graced the stage to introduced Apple’s 
news app, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/08/apple-wwdc-newsstand-flipboard-news-app>
 in partnership with various media outlets including Conde Nast – which will 
make 17 titles available to the app. The New York Times will offer 30 free 
articles per day.

Prescott said: “News [the app’s name] has the latest stories, articles and 
posts, with over a million topics to choose from. The service would track over 
1m topics and allow readers to follow all their favourite news sources as well 
as using search to discover new sources.”

Last year Cook came out as gay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/30/apple-chief-tim-cook-proud-to-be-gay>
 and described his sexuality as “among the greatest gifts God has given me”.

According to the company’s 2014 diversity report, 70% of its 98,000 employees 
were male and 55% were white.

@jbenton <https://twitter.com/jbenton> They had conference jackets with 
female-specific sizing for the first time at registration. So I’m expecting big 
things.

Apple and other technology firms have been criticised for having a 
predominantly male workforce, a lack of ethnically diverse employees and a low 
number of women in senior management positions. Angela Ahrendts, senior 
vice-president of retail and online stores, is the sole woman on its 10-strong 
executive team.

The balance is typical for technology firms. Facebook reports a 69% male and 
57% white workforce, while Twitter has a 70% male and 59% white employee 
demographic.

Apple’s events typically feature slots from Craig Federighi, head of software 
engineering; marketing chief Phil Schiller; Eddy Cue, vice-president of 
internet services; and iOS software supremo Scott Forstall.

I’m incredibly impressed by these talented student scholarship winners. See

The more diverse speaker lineup is part of a concerted effort by Cook, who 
told technology news site Mashable on Sunday that “you’ll see a change 
tomorrow” with the speakers, and spent time meeting female student WWDC 
scholarship winners at Sunday’s orientation session.

Apple also remains a “lifetime” partner for the non-profit organisation 
National Center forWomen <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> & 
Information, which encourages women to enter into technology positions.
