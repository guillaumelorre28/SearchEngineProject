The Abbey Road film festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/abbeyroadfilmfestival> takes place from 
Saturday March 19 to Sunday April 3. Over the course of the fortnight visitors 
have the chance to see a selection of classic films including Yellow Submarine, 
Backbeat, Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Shrek, The 
English Patient, Aliens and Gangs of New York.

There will be three screenings every day, all in Studio 1, where the 
soundtracks to the films were originally recorded. Ticket holders also get 
access to an exhibition of archive photography in Studio 2, where the Beatles 
recorded.

On Saturday April 2 there will be a Guardian screening of A Hard Day's Night, 
attended by members of the film's original cast and crew including Victor 
Spinetti, John Junkin and Roy Benson, the film's assistant editor. After the 
screening there will be a Q&A session chaired by Martin Lewis, the Beatles 
scholar who produced the recently released DVD edition of A Hard Day's Night. 
Doors open at 6.30pm.

Over the past few weeks, Guardian readers have been voting for their favourite 
film scored at Abbey Road. The winner, which will be shown on Easter Monday at 
3pm, is Brazil, Terry Gilliam's darkly comical vision of the future. Tickets to 
this, and all the other screenings, cost from £15 to £20 and are available by 
phoning 0870 060 1767. For full programme information and to book tickets, go to
