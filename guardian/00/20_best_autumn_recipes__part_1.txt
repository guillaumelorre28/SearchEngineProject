Richard Olney’s pears in red wine (poires au vin rouge)


Serves 4
eating pears 4 or 5, slightly under ripe
orange 1
cinnamon
sugar 150g
good red wine 1 bottle

Cut the pears in two, lengthwise, core and peel them and arrange the halves in 
the bottom of an earthenware or enamelled ironware terrine – if they are to be 
cooked in the oven, Pyrex or porcelain will do as well. Wash the orange to 
remove any hint of insecticide or preservative, and shave a long spiral from 
the peel, keeping clear of the white, pithy material. Add it to the pears, 
sprinkle very lightly with cinnamon, add the sugar and the wine, bring to a 
boil, and leave, covered, to simmer for about 2 hours (with certain hard 
varieties of cooking pears, one may allow as much as 6 to 8 hours’ cooking 
time), or until they are coated in a thin syrup. Serve them chilled, 
accompanied by tuiles or other simple cookies.

 Blackberry and apple pie: ‘When you gather windfall apples to make this pie, 
quantity and variety of fruit do not much come into it’. Photograph: Martin 
Poole for the Observer 
When you pick blackberries in the autumn, and gather windfall apples to make 
this pie, quantity and variety of fruit do not much come into it. You make the 
best of what you have. This is the way it should be. This is how regional 
dishes once developed. People used what their garden and neighbourhood could 
provide. Sometimes a suggestion from a visitor or the arrival of a new 
ingredient with the development of trade and manufacture might give a new 
aspect to an old dish, with luck a new refinement, most likely – at least, in 
recent times – a short cut or substitute ingredient that did not improve it. I 
cannot help feeling that before the great bramley conquest – it was introduced 
in 1876 – blackberry and apple pie made with the windfalls of pippin or 
reinette varieties tasted much better. Nowadays, I use tart windfall Blenheim 
orange apples, and then after Christmas Belle de Boskoop. This is a real treat 
as we do not grow it in Wiltshire, and depend on the kindness of January 
visitors from France for an occasional supply.


With apples of this quality, you do not need so many blackberries (cookery 
books often give equal weights of each). If you are making the pie soon after 
picking blackberries, rather than from a store in the freezer, weigh them and 
add up to double their weight in apples.

Assuming you start with 1kg apples and ½kg of blackberries, put half the 
blackberries into a large saucepan. Peel, core and slice the apples, sprinkling 
them with lemon or orange juice to prevent them darkening: put the peel and 
cores into the blackberry pan and cover with water. Cook slowly at first, then 
faster as the juices run, so that you end up with about 150ml of strained 
liquid. Dissolve 200-250g sugar in the liquid, the quantity according to the 
tartness of the fruit.

Pack the sliced apples and remaining blackberries in layers in a deep pie 
dish. Mound up the fruit in a curve above the rim of the dish. Pour the 
sweetened, cool juice over the whole thing. Cover in the usual way with 
shortcrust pastry. Brush over the top with egg white and sprinkle with caster 
sugar.

Put into the oven at 200C/gas mark 6 for 45-60 minutes depending on the depth 
of the dish. Turn the heat down slightly once the pastry is set firm and 
lightly coloured. Protect it with butter papers from becoming too brown. Test 
the apples with a thin pointed knife through the central hole in the pastry: 
when it goes through them easily, they are done. Serve with custard sauce or 
cream, preferably cream, clotted cream above all.

 Trofie with walnut sauce: a Ligurian speciality. Photograph: Martin Poole for 
the Observer 
This sauce from Liguria is traditionally used with pansoti or corzetti, local 
pasta shapes made with a simple dough of flour and water. Pansoti are the 
Ligurian ravioli, filled with wild herbs, beet leaves, borage and ricotta.


Corzetti come in two shapes: in one, the rolled-out dough is cut in the shape 
of a figure of eight; in the other, a far rarer shape, the dough is cut in the 
shape of large coins and each coin is stamped with a special wooden tool carved 
with a pattern. In the old days, aristocratic families had their own stamp with 
the coat of arms on it. Corzetti are rarely found on the market, but another 
Ligurian pasta shape, trofie, can be used; these are more widely available from 
supermarkets.

As for the walnuts, they should be fresh-looking with no dark spots and in 
large pieces, showing no sign of powder. Of all nuts, walnuts are the ones that 
most quickly turn rancid and they become unpleasantly acid when old.

Serves 4
walnuts 100g, shelled
one-day-old crustless bread 30g
whole milk 3-4 tbsp
garlic 1 clove
extra virgin olive oil 100ml
double cream 2 tbsp
parmesan cheese 50g, grated, plus extra to serve
salt and freshly ground black pepper
trofie 350g

Soak the walnuts in boiling water for about 15 minutes and then drain and 
remove as much of the skin as you can. Preheat the oven to 120C/gas mark ½.


Break the bread into small pieces, put it in a bowl and pour over the milk. 
Leave it for a few minutes and then squeeze out the milk and put the bread in a 
food processor together with the walnuts and the garlic. Blitz while adding the 
oil through the funnel. Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and mix in the 
cream and the parmesan. Taste and season with salt and a little pepper. Place 
the bowl in the oven.

Cook the trofie in boiling salted water. Drain, reserving some of the water, 
and turn it into the bowl with the sauce. Add a little of the reserved pasta 
water to loosen the sauce, mix well and serve at once with a bowl of grated 
parmesan.

 Cep tarts: perfect for a light luncheon with a rocket salad and some thin 
slivers of parmesan. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer 
Persillade basically means chopped garlic and parsley. It is a classic of 
Provençal cookery and is added to many sautéed dishes at the last minute, 
together with a few breadcrumbs to soak up any excess olive oil or butter. When 
added to fried ceps, they become cèpes à la provençale and if you are not 
wishing to bother with the pastry, then this dish is wonderful just as it is.

If you are lucky enough, like me, to have been foraging for fresh ceps in 
Welsh forests, then these are the mushrooms to use for this dish. Obviously, 
these are not readily available in the shops! So, as an alternative, I would 
suggest either a combination of dried or tinned ceps (which are readily 
available in specialist food shops and some supermarkets) with large, black, 
flat mushrooms. Dried mushrooms are best because they have a much stronger 
flavour, and are easy to reconstitute.

This would be perfect for a light luncheon with a rocket salad and some thin 
slivers of parmesan.

Serves 4
fresh ceps 450g or dried ceps 110g
flat mushrooms 225g
butter 110g
salt and pepper
flat-leaf parsley 1 bunch, leaves only
garlic 4 cloves, peeled and chopped
dry breadcrumbs 50g
lemon grated rind of 1
egg 1, beaten
parmesan cheese 2 tbsp, freshly grated

For the pastry
strong plain flour 225g
salt a pinch
unsalted butter 225g, cold, cut into small pieces
lemon juice of ½
iced water 150ml

Begin by making the pastry, preferably the day before; certainly several hours 
in advance. Sift the flour and salt together into a bowl and add the butter. 
Loosely mix, but don’t blend the two together in the normal way of pastry 
making. Mix the lemon juice with the iced water and pour into the butter/flour 
mixture. With a metal spoon, gently mix together until you have formed a 
cohesive mass. Turn on to a cool surface and shape into a thick rectangle. 
Flour the work surface and gently roll the pastry into a rectangle measuring 
about 18cm x 10cm. Fold one third of the rectangle over towards the centre and 
fold the remaining third over that. Lightly press together and rest the pastry 
in the fridge for 10 minutes.


Return the pastry to the same position on the work surface and turn it through 
90 degrees. Roll it out to the same dimensions as before, and fold and rest 
again in the same way. Repeat this turning, rolling, folding and resting 
process three more times. (Phew! This is the moment when you wish you’d bought 
ready-made pastry.) Place the pastry in a polythene bag and leave in the fridge 
for several hours or overnight.

If you are using dried ceps, cover with lukewarm water and leave to 
reconstitute for 20 minutes. Drain and gently squeeze dry with your hands. 
(Strain the soaking water and use it to make a soup or stock.)

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Roll out the pastry into four circles 
measuring about 15cm across and 3mm thick. Place on a floured tray and keep 
cool in the fridge.

Slice the mushrooms thinly. Heat the butter in a large frying pan until just 
turning golden. Throw in the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook 
briskly until crusty and golden brown, driving off any moisture that builds up. 
Add the parsley, garlic, breadcrumbs and lemon rind and mix thoroughly. Turn 
into a bowl and leave to cool. Remove the pastry circles from the fridge, brush 
the edges with beaten egg to a depth of 1 cm and spread the mushroom mixture 
over the four circles up to the edge of the beaten egg. Sprinkle with the 
grated parmesan and put on to greased baking sheets. Bake in the oven for 15-20 
minutes or until the pastry has risen around the edges and is thoroughly crisp 
underneath (check by lifting with a palette knife). Serve piping hot.

 Baked squash with celery and herb cream: ‘sweet dumpling – a very pretty 
striped and dimpled squash – is ideal for this’. Photograph: Tessa Traeger 
This recipe was devised on one of the rare occasions that we had a major power 
cut, with three young children needing to be fed and only the wood burner for 
warmth and cooking. We wrapped the squash in foil and tucked them into the 
edges of the wood burner, away from the flames. The children dipped cubes of 
bread into the cheesy, fondue-style filling. It became a popular supper dish in 
less chaotic times, too.

Our favourite squashes to use for this recipe are uchiki kuri (also known as 
onion squash), buttercup and blue ballet. All have dense, strongly flavoured 
flesh that soaks up flavours and fat without becoming mushy and marrow-like. 
The skin of the squash retains its beautiful, vibrant colour and is thin enough 
not to need peeling. We think it is the best part.

You can also serve this dish as a starter, using individual smaller squashes. 
The photo shows sweet dumpling – a very pretty striped and dimpled squash that 
is ideal for this.

Serves 2 hungry people
squash 1, about 1-2kg
creme fraiche about 300ml (you need enough to fill the squash by ¾)
lemon juice of ½
celery leaves 3 sprigs, or 1 lovage leaf
rosemary, thyme or sage 2 sprigs
butter 1 knob
garlic 1 clove, finely chopped
nutmeg a little, grated, or ½ cinnamon stick
good melting cheese, such as comte, gruyere or cheddar 150g, grated
sea salt and black pepper

To garnish (optional)
olive oil 3 tbsp
sage 4-5 leaves

Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Cut the top off the squash to make a lid and 
set aside. Scoop out the seeds and a little of the flesh so that you are left 
with a clean squash bowl. To stop the squash toppling over, it is a good idea 
to make a base for it to sit on: take a roughly 30cm square piece of foil, 
squeeze it together and shape it into a “bracelet”. Put it in a roasting tin 
and place the squash on top.


Fill the squash three-quarters full with creme fraiche and then add the lemon 
juice, herb sprigs, butter, garlic and grated nutmeg or the cinnamon stick. 
Season with salt and pepper.

Place the lid back on the squash. Cover with foil and bake for at least an 
hour. The cooking time will vary, depending on the size of your squash. It is 
done when a sharp knife slides through the flesh with no resistance.

Remove the herb sprigs and sprinkle in the grated cheese. Place the squash 
back in the oven, without the foil, for about 10 minutes, until it has browned 
and the cheese is nice and gooey.

The fried sage garnish is optional, but it looks and tastes great. Heat the 
olive oil in a small frying pan and add the sage leaves, making sure they are 
completely dry if you have washed them. Fry for about 30 seconds, until crisp, 
then remove and place on kitchen paper to drain.Sprinkle the leaves on top of 
the squash filling.

The easiest way to serve this is to spoon out the creamy contents on to each 
person’s plate and then cut chunks off the squash horizontally, working your 
way down. Serve with toasted sourdough bread.
