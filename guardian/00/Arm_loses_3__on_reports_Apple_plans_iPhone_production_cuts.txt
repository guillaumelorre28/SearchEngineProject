Apple suppliers have come under pressure following a report the company may 
cut iPhone production sharply this quarter on weaker demand.

Inventories were said to have built up since the launches of the iPhone 6s and 
6s Plus in September, according to the report from Nikkei, prompting the cuts 
to allow dealers to sell their current stock.

Shares in Apple itself fell 2.5% following the report,

 and now UK chipmakers are also falling.Arm is down 32p or 3% at 972p, 
Imagination Technologies has fallen 0.5p to 131.25p and Laird is 5.5p lower at 
340.7p. Elsewhere Dialog Semiconductor is down 4.2% and ASML is off 2.5%. 
Analysts at Liberum said:

The Nikkei in Japan has reported that Apple may cut production of the iPhone 
6s and 6s Plus by about 30% in the March quarter versus original plans.Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> had initially told suppliers to 
keep production flat with last year’s levels.

Production is expected to return to normal levels by the June quarter. Such a 
cut to Apple’s shipment numbers will be negative for a number of companies in 
the semiconductor sector.

In Europe Imagination, Laird, ASML and ARM have significant exposure to Apple 
and its supply chain. Imagination derives about 34% of its revenues from Apple, 
ARM close to 10% andLaird <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lairdgroup> 
about 20%. ASML gets about 25%-30% of its revenues from foundries which are 
mainly spending on capex to cater to Apple’s demand. DRAM (50% of ASML’s 
revenue) is also partially Apple dependant. We remain cautious on all these 
stocks and see the risks being to the downside.
