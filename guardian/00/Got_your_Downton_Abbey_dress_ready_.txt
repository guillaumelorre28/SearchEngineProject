The magnificent Maggie Smith <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001749/> returns for 
a second series ofJulian Fellowes <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0271501/>' 
costume blockbuster. The first world war has broken out and the 
upstairs/downstairs dramas are relocated to the front, with Downton heir 
Matthew Crawley and servants Thomas and William in the trenches. Eight glorious 
episodes crowned with a Christmas special.

decanters, carpets, wallpaper and so on.

The album

What Biophilia <http://bjork.com/>, by Björk.
An ambitious multimedia album that includes live shows, a video by Michel 
Gondry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Gondry> and a different app for 
every song, this latest release shows that Björk remains a pop pioneer. The 
tracks are as beautiful and otherworldly as you'd expect, and who could fail to 
fall for an album introduced byDavid Attenborough 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/david_attenborough.shtml>?
When 10 October. 
Wear London fashion week designer Michael van der Ham 
<http://www.michaelvanderham.com/> has recently been making gear for the

 just landed.

The film

What Melancholia. <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzD0U841LRM>
When this art-house spectacular premiered at Cannes 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/may/18/cannes-2011-review-melancholia>, 
director Lars von Triers was booted out forhis weird Nazi rant 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2011/may/19/lars-von-trier-nazi-cannes>. 
Which makes it all the more remarkable that starKirsten Dunst 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000379/> still went on to scoop the best actress 
gong 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/may/22/cannes-live-blog-results>. 
The film mixes jaw-dropping CGI with intimate melodrama, as warring sisters 
Dunst andCharlotte Gainsbourg <http://www.charlottegainsbourg.com/> face the 
end of the world.
When 30 September.
Wear Take a screen grab of Dunst to the salon as she has the Best Shade Of 
Blond Ever.

The exhibition
 Betty by Gerhard Richter 
What Gerhard Richter: Panorama at Tate Modern 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/gerhardrichter/default.shtm>, London 
SE1.
Lucian Freud may be gone, but at nearly 80 Richter is still going strong. One 
of the great modern artists, his work straddles painting, photography, realism 
and conceptualism. This major retrospective covers five decades and includes 
September, his response to 9/11, but his subtle, photo-realist portraits are 
likely to be the stars of the show.
When 6 October-8 January 2012.
Wear Layered colour and texture are in this season.

The film 2

What Drive <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/>.
Buckle up for a white-knuckle ride. Tearing through LA's freeways and cruising 
its seedy strip malls, this sleek – and explosively violent – thriller stars
Ryan Gosling <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331516/> as an ice-cool movie 
stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver. Strong support fromCarey Mulligan 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1659547/> and Christina Hendricks 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376716/> and a retro pop- synth soundtrack make it 
autumn's most stylish release.
When 23 September.
Wear A silver bomber jacket and driving gloves, as per Gosling's lead 
character. He also wears a lot of good denim, which is worth studying.

The exhibition 2

What Degas And The Ballet 
<http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/events/exhibitions/degas-and-the-ballet-picturing-movement,1643,EV.html>
, the Royal Academy, London W1.
A rare solo show. The impressionist was obsessed with movement, and this 
exhibition shows how he drew on the new technologies of photography and film to 
capture the physical skill of his ballerinas. A chance to see little-known 
works along with favourites such as his bronzeLittle Dancer Aged Fourteen 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=3705>.
When Until 11 December. 
Wear A silk shirt in ballet pink, or introduce a little post-rehearsal 
cashmere – a knit tied round your shoulders or some fine-gauge joggers. Or just 
dig out those pumps.

The high street/designer collaboration

What Versace at H&M. <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGdJgKJB8qc>
The fact that H&M's designer collaborations are such big names means the 
latest launch becomes a sort of cultural event of its own. This one is 
va-va-voom. Donatella has looked at the archive – the vintage looks that Gaga 
has been parading around in all year – to develop a greatest hits collection 
for men and women. Expect leather, stilettos, baroque prints and lashings of 
sex.
When 17 November.
Wear Vintage Versace, of course.

tailoring. The show is designed like a house, with different rooms showcasing 
different stages of her 40-year career. There are videos and gear from the 
singer's own collection, as well as costumes,including the Union Jack suit she 
rocked at the Brit awards in 1999
