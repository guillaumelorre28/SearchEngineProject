In 1997, James Cameron’s Titanic made its sensational appearance at the 
cinema, and with it a colossally popular soundtrack album of that movie’s 
powerhouse orchestral score byJames Horner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/james-horner>, which won him Oscars for 
original score and song. The album sold 30m copies – and continues to sell – 
featuring the song which he co-wrote, My Heart Will Go On, sung by Celine Dion. 
Horner’s aria of emotional defiance and survival, hurled like flotsam from the 
oceanic swell of his overall composition, was a key moment of the film, a 
moment which existed both inside and outside its narrative. When we saw Leo and 
Kate at the prow of the ship, when we remembered the awful final moments in the 
lifeboats, it was Horner’s music that thrummed through our hearts and minds.

James Horner was one of the elite group of Hollywood composers – people like 
Alexandre Desplat, Carter Burwell, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Ennio Morricone 
or indeed Bernard Herrmann – who can be relied upon to score a movie with 
imagination, sensitivity and professionalism. Horner’s work would give film an 
all-important substance and solidity which we can feel almost subconsciously, 
perhaps without noticing what the music is doing, how it is working with the 
images on screen and how it is guiding our emotions. Horner created scores 
which worked on three levels: the film’s deep structure and texture, the 
higher, intermediate level of counterpoint with narrative (when the music 
underscores the apparent mood, and when it is in contradistinction) and the 
topmost flourish, the standalone whistle-outside-the-cinema tune, the As Time 
Goes By or Third Man moment.

 In one of the last TV interviews before his death in a plane crash in southern 
California, Oscar-winning composer James Horner talks about the success of 
Titanic and his musical score to the film 
Like the greats, Horner was staggeringly prolific, who produced music as 
naturally as breathing, but who set himself a daunting workload, often working 
16-hour days. Incredibly, for the year 1993 he scored 13 films, including Alan 
Pakula’s The Pelican Brief and Mel Gibson’s The Man Without a Face – more than 
20 hours of recorded music in a single year, all with complex arrangements. 
Billy Wilder said that in movies, you make the subtleties obvious, and that is 
part of what a Hollywood composer does: create music designed to be perceived 
in tandem with images, but subtlety and strength go together. When the music is 
jarringly obvious, the composer is not doing his or her job.

James Horner: from Star Trek to Avatar - 10 of his best film scores in clips

Horner’s breakthrough score is often thought to be Star Trek 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/star-trek> II: The Wrath of Khan, in 1982, 
in which music conveyed the excitement of voyaging through outer space; it 
combined a clamorous Williamsesque deployment of theme with something more 
distinctive, with a nautical signature, maybe even like something by Aram 
Khachaturian, a surging, propulsive score appropriate for journeying – ideas to 
which he, of course, returned in Titanic.

My favourite James Horner score is his work on another outerspace spectacular, 
Ron Howard’s Apollo 13, a thoroughly enjoyable movie for which the music is 
all-important – particularly Horner’s stirring theme for The Launch, which 
conveys the excitement, the rapture and the awe with a melodic line which at 
times suggests secularised church music and appears to quote the Christmas 
carol Oh Come All Ye Faithful.

 Listen to the Launch from the Apollo 13 soundtrack – audio 
It may have influenced Hans Zimmer’s score for the Christopher Nolan film 
Interstellar, although I prefer Horner’s theme. It is a tremendous score, and 
Horner was a Hollywood giant.
