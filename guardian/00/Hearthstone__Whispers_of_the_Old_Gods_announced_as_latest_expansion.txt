The next expansion pack for Hearthstone, Blizzard’s hugely popular collectible 
card video game, will be called Whispers of the Old Gods and will launch 
towards the end of April or the beginning of May, the company has announced.

Based around Warcraft’s Lovecraftian-style elder gods, C’Thun, Yogg-Saron, 
N’Zoth and Y’Shaarj, the expansion will bring a further 144 cards to the game, 
including a number of “corrupted” versions of previous minions. A selection of 
the new cards were revealed to journalists and community members at Blizzard’s 
headquarters in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

The expansion will also launch alongside the long-awaited introduction of 
rotation in Hearthstone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/03/hearthstone-retires-cards-limited-format>
. Announced in February, the change will see around 150 cards retired from the 
main format, renamed “Standard”. The entirety of the Curse of Naxxramas and 
Goblins v Gnomes expansions are being rotated out, but those cards will still 
be playable for the foreseeable future in the new “Wild” format.

The thematic heart of the new expansion, described by lead designer Benjamin 
Brode as “the darkest thing Hearthstone will ever do”, is split between two 
concepts: the old gods and their followers, and the corrupting effect they have 
on the denizens of the Warcraft world.

That corrupting effect leads to minions like “Polluted Hoarder”, a spin on the 
conventional “Loot Hoarder”, and “Corrupted Healbot”, whose deathrattle heals 
the opponent for 8 health. The latter minion, a corrupted version of 
Hearthstone mainstay Antique Healbot, also underlines Blizzard’s insistence 
that they won’t be using newer packs to simply reprint cards which have been 
rotated out of older ones.

Antique Healbot, which will leave Standard play when the Goblins v Gnomes 
expansion does, is regularly used in a number of popular deck archetypes. Those 
decks will be forced to change greatly when the expansion pack comes out in the 
spring.

Both the cultists affect the C’Thun, wherever it is: in the player’s deck 
hand, or on the board, leading to decks built around building the minion up to 
terrifying levels before unleashing huge amounts of damage in one turn.

Uniquely for Hearthstone, C’Thun and two copies of Beckoner of Evil will be 
given to every player for free when they open their first Whispers of the Old 
Gods booster pack. Brode explained that the motivation for the giveaway is to 
ensure that every player can play with C’Thun, since 16 of the 134 new cards 
introduced in the expansion interact with it in some way. The rest of the cards 
will be earned in the same way as every other Hearthstone expansion, however, 
through packs of five costing 69p or 100 in-game gold. Returning players will 
also get three free packs at launch.

The last card revealed at the event was also one of the last developed 
internally, and is another spinoff of an earlier card. But rather than being 
corrupted, “Validated Doomsayer” is just very, very happy. He’s been predicting 
doom for years, and finally he’s got it right – causing him to turn into a five 
mana 0/7 with text reading “at the start of your turn set this minion’s Attack 
to 7”.
