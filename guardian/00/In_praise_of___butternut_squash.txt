Was there ever a more overlooked delicacy than the butternut squash? The 
seasonal bulbous fruit has long lived in the shadow of the pumpkin, a rival 
relentlessly promoted by our cousins across the pond. Some serious elbow grease 
is requiredto peel and cut it

but the rewards – a ripe, sweet-tasting, deep orange pulp – are worth the 
cussing and its shape makes fora wonderful edible bowl

butternut might not be the most flavourful of ingredients; but its velvety 
texture speaks of comfort and heartiness. It makes a wonderful pairing with 
chorizo and pulled pork. And with spices, it comes to life. Stick it in the 
oven for half an hour, coated in olive oil with cumin seeds and cinnamon. It 
sounds minimal, but, honestly, magic will ensue. When warmth is needed, serve 
it as a thick, buttery soup, topped with a dollop of Greek yoghurt and roasted 
pine nuts. If you don't have a fireplace, this is the next best thing.
