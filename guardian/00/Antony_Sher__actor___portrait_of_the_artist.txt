What first drew you to acting?

Growing up in Cape Town, I was a very shy, weedy little kid – I didn't fit 
into the sports-mad world of white South Africa. Then my parents sent me to 
what was called "elocution" – in fact, a sort of acting – and I discovered that 
I didn't have to be this weedy little person. I could be all sorts of other 
people. That sense of liberation was intoxicating.

What was your big breakthrough?

The History Man <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081898/>, Christopher Hampton 
<http://literature.britishcouncil.org/christopher-hampton>'s 1981 adaptation of 
Malcolm Bradbury'sgreat novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/12/fiction1> for the BBC. I was 
given the wonderful break of playing the leading part, Howard Kirk, just as I 
turned 30. It took me up a rung on the ladder.

Who or what have you sacrificed for your art?

Peace of mind. All the creative arts involve struggle, and I do three of them 
– as I also write and paint. You don't often find yourself feeling calm.

Stage or screen?

Stage. With very few exceptions, the material you work with – the script – 
is much richer than in film or TV.

Your partner Gregory Doran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/22/royal-shakespeare-company-gregory-doran>
 is artistic director of the RSC. Is it helpful to have a partner working in 
the same area?

Luckily, it's not quite the same area – he's a director, and I'm an actor. So 
it works well: we're able to be genuinely interested in one another's work and 
come at it from a different perspective. I think it would be much more 
difficult to have another actor as one's partner.

Are you worried about the impact of government cuts?

Yes, terribly. Our theatre is the envy of the world; it has a huge value for 
us spiritually. I feel so sorry for younger actors who aren't able to have the 
opportunities that I had, starting out in repertory theatre. It's really tough 
on young actors now.

Which of your roles has been most challenging?

Macbeth. He's so wonderfully complex. He has strange little soliloquies early 
on in the play, in which he's flirting with the idea of murdering the king. 
But then he says he won't – and when he does, he botches it, and freaks out at 
the sight of blood. When I was firstmapping my way through the role 
<http://skyarts.sky.com/the-rscs-macbeth>, it was confusing – but it worked out 
well in the end.

Which artists do you most admire?

I'm a huge fan of David Hockney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney>. I love the way he keeps 
reinventing himself.

What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you?

After my Rada audition, when I first came to this country, they said: "We urge 
you to think of another career."

Is there anything about your career you regret?

I turned down the National's first production of Tony Kushner's Angels in 
America 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_in_America:_A_Gay_Fantasia_on_National_Themes>
 – one of the great plays of modern times. "Whoops," I thought afterwards, 
"Wrong call there."
