A vegetarian, teetotal, marathon-running Indian tycoon, Anil Ambani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/anil-ambani>, has emerged as the biggest 
financial loser from the global economic crisis. Ambani has seen $31.9bn 
(£23.2bn) of his personal wealth evaporate in a collapse in the value of his 
Reliance group of companies.

Ambani, 49, has a broad variety of business interests ranging from telecoms to 
mutual funds and Bollywood movie-making. A year ago, Forbes ranked him as the 
sixth-richest man in the world, with $42bn. His net worth has since dived to 
$10.1bn, pushing him to a lowly 34th.

Coming off the back of a boom, India's stockmarket has fared even worse than 
those elsewhere over the last year, dropping 44%. Shares in Ambani's Reliance 
Communications, Reliance Power and Reliance Capital have all plummeted.

A disciplined character, Ambani rises early in Mumbai – he once told the Hindu 
newspaper that he spent two hours on a treadmill and endured 30 minutes of yoga 
before work every morning.

On his fortune, he has remarked: "My dad always used to tell [me] wealth 
whispers, money shouts. Money, as you know, ceases to be important after a 
certain point."

What may be important to him, however, is that his fall down the rankings has 
left him badly trailing his older brother, Mukesh, who is worth an estimated 
$19.5bn. The pair do not get on – Anil last year sued for libel over a 
newspaper interview in which Mukesh accused Reliance of industrial espionage.
