In a Monday letter to fans apologising for the cancellation of his show at 
Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, the comedian Louis CK sounded a note of 
scepticism about the impending Winter Storm Juno.

“They are calling this storm ‘historic’ which … Well I didn’t know you could 
call a thing historic if it hasn’t happened yet,” he said.

On Tuesday, with the benefit of hindsight, many New Yorkers criticised state 
and city government for its reaction to the storm, which included shutting down 
the subway – for the first time in response to snow – and imposing a travel ban 
after 11pm. Other than bridges, there was no travel ban when the city was hit 
by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Some critics also cited empty subway trains running through the night as 
evidence of a too-zealous and inefficient reaction by authorities to a storm 
which instead of the predicted 26in or more of snow left 5in or 6in at most, as 
its effects were felt far more in New England.

Governor Andrew Cuomo <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo> and 
transportation officials said in response they had been correct to be cautious. 
The empty trains, it was explained, had run to keep tracks free of snow.

Many critics, nonetheless, took to social media to ask if the official 
response might have been just a little bit disproportionate:

So shuttering all of NYC may have been a bit of an overreaction, eh? I'm 
SHOCKED.#hype <https://twitter.com/hashtag/hype?src=hash>

Many others tweeted to ask the question: “Where is all the snow?”

A foot is a lot in nyc... City fell in range of the error zone and storm 
verified further east. It happens. But close subway? Overreaction

However, both Governor Cuomo and New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bill-de-blasio>, hit back at claims 
authorities had overreacted, the latter saying the city had “dodged a bullet”.

Cuomo announced on Monday that New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> City subway services would cease 
entirely at 11pm. A city-wide travel ban was also implemented from 11pm, with 
fines of up to $300 for any drivers found on the roads after curfew.

Several hundred national guard troopers were reportedly called out to help 
enforce the ban, and a text alert was sent to every smartphone in the city. It 
was only the fourth time the alert system has been used. The first three were 
all during Hurricane Sandy.

The scale of the shutdown was unprecedented. Sandy saw the MTA network shut 
down but no snow event had led to the complete shutdown of the transit network.

In a surreal twist, an MTA source told the Brooklyn Paper 
<http://brooklynpaper.com/stories/38/5/all-cuomo-ghost-trains-2015-01-30-bk_38_5.html>
 that despite Cuomo’s decision, the subway would be running empty trains on 
many lines anyway.

The source, which the paper described as an MTA “insider” said limited 
closures along low-lying, outdoor sections of track such as the Brighton B and 
Q line made sense, but told the paper the majority of the subway system that 
runs on underground and elevated lines was protected from the storm’s impact.

At a press conference on Monday, the MTA chairman, Thomas Prendergast, 
reportedly said there would be “no reason” to stop service entirely, saying: 
“We’d be able to run trains.” Later that day it was announced that all 
passenger transit – which is run by the governor’s office in Albany, not New 
York’s City Hall – would cease at 11pm.

In his press conference on Tuesday morning, Governor Cuomo said subway rolling 
stock had been “put away” for the night.

Nonetheless, users on Reddit spent the night comparing notes on which trains 
were still running. “I was just outside and the 1 trains are still definitely 
going,” wrote one user, Pierrebrassau, at 2.30am, adding: “Really embarrassing 
response by Cuomo.” Another user, EMCsq, posted at around the same time: “I 
just went out to buy beer and shovel snow. I can confirm the 2 line is 
currently running in the Bronx.”

Prendergast said at the press conference on Tuesday that it “takes a few 
hours” to shut down the system, and said that “there’s a difference between 
running what we call an equipment train and one with passenger service. Those 
trains run to try to keep the line open. They’re not running to schedule, nor 
are they making station stops.”

The governor’s office confirmed trains were running on some subway lines 
overnight, but said that they were “for the purpose of clearing train tracks”. 
That didn’t stop many from complaining that they had been left stranded.

José Holguín-Veras, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, said the response had been “on the cautious 
side”, but said that while putting the city effectively under house arrest 
might sound extreme, it was part of a calculation of risk.

“What is worse: being cautious, or being quote-unquote optimistic and praying 
nothing bad will happen?” he said. “Of course, they might get criticised for 
putting the city in lockdown, but I think it was reasonable. Because the 
forecast was pretty grim.”

“Of course, it’s hard to explain to the public why they have to go through all 
these inconveniences,” Holguín-Veras added. “But … the general public have to 
understand that in cases like this, randomness plays a role. It’s better to be 
safe than sorry.”

Gary Szatowski, a senior meteorologist, tweeted a heartfelt apology on Tuesday 
morning. “My deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members 
of the general public,” he wrote. “You made a lot of tough decisions expecting 
us to get it right, and we didn’t. Once again, I’m sorry.”

Many responded kindly to his mea culpa. “Better safe than sorry,” several 
users tweeted back.

Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York 
University, echoed their sentiment. “There is wisdom in being prudent,” he 
said. “There were no stranded trains, no massive auto collisions, and no reason 
to criticise public officials for responding to predictions of a heavy 
snowfall.”

In his press conference on Tuesday, Cuomo said: “Weather forecasters do the 
best they can, and we respond to the best information we have.”

Cuomo pointed to a storm last year in Buffalo, which saw 7ft of snow fall 
unexpectedly but where no roads were closed. “You can have a significant loss 
of life in these situations,” he said.

He also said that because the roads were clear of cars in the city on Tuesday 
morning, the snowploughs had been able to clear them much faster than they 
otherwise might have done.

“I don’t know that this wasn’t the most prudent course of action in any event, 
because it may have brought us back to full activity sooner,” he said.
