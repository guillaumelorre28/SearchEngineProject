Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> has pledged 
that theLabour party <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> under his 
leadership would introduce an arts pupil premium for primary schools and reverse
arts spending cuts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/arts-cuts-spending-review-council>
 made over the last six years.

The Labour leader launched his arts strategy in Edinburgh on Friday to 
coincide with the last few days of theEdinburgh festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival>.

He said: “Drawing on Britain’s rich cultural heritage, Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> under my leadership will commit 
to extending access and participation in the arts to all people and all 
communities across Britain.

“There is creativity in all of us but we need to give people the opportunities 
for this creativity to flourish.”

He said a radical, transformative vision for the arts would be central to his 
plans to rebuild and transform Britain.

“Labour will reverse Tory cuts to arts expenditure and set out a bold and 
inspiring policy programme for the arts, building on our proud cultural 
heritage,” Corbyn said.

Among his promises are:

• To introduce an arts pupil premium for every primary school pupil in 
England, in line with the existingPE pupil premium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/jul/22/how-schools-spend-pupil-premium>
 set up in 2013, which boosts school sports budgets byabout £150m a year 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/150-million-to-boost-primary-school-sport>. 
He would also look to extending this to secondary schools.

• To aim to increase the proportion of GDP the UK government spends on arts 
and culture to match the European average.

• To reverse “Tory real-terms cuts to arts expenditure and restore 
grant-in-aid funding of the Arts Council.”

• To introduce a cross-departmental cabinet committee on the arts and creative 
industries tasked with increasing participation.

• To develop a national policy on libraries and enforce in law that local 
authorities “provide a comprehensive and efficient library service extended to 
digital services”.

• To consider whether dance and drama should be made national curriculum 
subjects in their own right.

Labour claims Arts Council England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/arts-council-england> has lost, in real 
terms, £7.2m grant-in-aid since 2010, whileCreative Scotland 
<http://www.creativescotland.com/> has lost £4.1m and Arts Council of Wales 
<http://www.arts.wales/> has lost £4.5m.

The cost of restoring that money would be met from the £670m raised by 
reversing cuts to capital gains tax introduced by the former chancellorGeorge 
Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> in the last budget 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/budget-2016>, Corbyn’s team said.

The policies will be looked at with interest by arts leaders, although there 
is no mention of one of the most sought-after policy decisions: adding arts to 
the government’s focus on science, technology, engineering and maths – thus
making Stem become Steam

Corbyn’s strategy differs from that announced by Ed Miliband in February 2015, 
when he said he could not make any promises about reversing spending cuts. He 
did, though, pledge to give every child auniversal entitlement to a creative 
education
