There‚Äôs really two ways of looking at this current NBA season. We could look 
at how many questions we had during the preseason that have yet to be answered 
and be amazed that the All-Star break is almost upon us. Or we could look at 
the sheer number of storylines this season has produced and wonder how the heck 
we haven‚Äôt even reached the All-Star break yet. Time has gone much slower for 
some fanbases than others, we‚Äôre probably in year five or six of thisNBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> season in Minnesota.

Gregg Popovich gets 1,000th win

On Monday, San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich notched his 1,000th win 
when the Spurs defeated the Indiana Pacers 95-93 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/10/gregg-popovich-joins-1000-win-club-as-spurs-beat-pacers>
. He was the third-fastest to reach that milestone, behind Phil Jackson and Pat 
Riley. Popovich has won five championships with the Spurs, and was a Ray Allen 
three away from winning six NBA Finals in six opportunities. Popovich‚Äôs success 
is such that he has become the standard his peers are judged against. Much of 
the Hawks‚Äô current success is credited to head coach Mike Budenholzer 
installing a Spurs-like system.

Critics would rightfully note that Popovich‚Äôs success is wrapped up with the 
fact that the Spurs drafted and developed Tim Duncan, who is in conversation 
with Kobe Bryant as the best NBA player of his era. If Popovich takes Scott 
Pollard in the 1997 NBA Draft,as he claims he almost did 
<http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/gregg-popovich-swears-he-briefly-considered-drafting-scot-pollard-over-tim-duncan-200433189.html>
, he‚Äôs probably not celebrating win 1,000 this week.

This is undoubtedly true, but every great coach has relied on a superstar or 
two. The most legendary of legendary NBA coaches is Red Auerbach, and he would 
be the first to remind you that much of his success hinged on having Bill 
Russell to lead those championship-hogging Boston Celtics teams. Jackson had 
Michael Jordan and then, when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant.


And even though Duncan has been the constant in Popovich‚Äôs 
championship-winning teams, he‚Äôs won with a wide assortment of rosters who have 
played very different brands of basketball. The 2014 Spurs were one of the most 
exciting and dominating championship teams in recent memory and they played 
nothing like those Spurs aughts teams that methodically out-fundamental-ed 
their opponents on their way to multiple titles. As much as critics like to 
call Popovich ‚Äúold school,‚Äù in actuality he constantly adjusts his approach to 
suit his roster. Any coach who put Danny Green on route to snagging a Finals 
MVP award, for instance, knows how to use the three pointer as a weapon as 
least as much as, say, the statistically obsessed Houston Rockets.

Popovich is unquestionably the best currently active NBA head coach, 
especially now with Riley and Jackson working front office gigs, but where does 
he fit in among the best of all-time? Well, he‚Äôs certainly in the conversation, 
win number 1,000 only confirms what we have known for a while, but as fun as it 
might be to argue his place in the hierarchy, let‚Äôs not pretend that Popovich 
has finished making his case. As long as he still has Duncan on his side, his 
Spurs always have a chance to win another title and if he‚Äôs somehow able to 
clinch a championship after Duncan retires? Then there might no arguing that 
he‚Äôs the best of all time.

(No pressure Kawhi Leonard.)

Hawks out Warriors in possible NBA Finals preview

The best team in the Western Conference met up with the best team in the 
Eastern Conference on Friday and for once the Eastern Conference managed to 
have bragging rights at the end of the contest.The Atlanta Hawks defeated the 
Golden State Warriors 124-116 in the latest Biggest Game Of The Regular Season 
<http://grantland.com/the-triangle/big-birds-watching-the-hawks-hunt-nba-prey/>
, so obviously we should just hand them the Larry O‚ÄôBrien statue right now.


This game may have come down to the fact that the Hawks were at Philips Arena 
and had the all-important home court advantage. No, don‚Äôt laugh, an 
Atlanta-based pro team now officially has an advantage playing at home. Going 
into Friday‚Äôs game, the Hawks had a 24-3 home record, and the Warriors were 
heading all the way from the west coast. EST might have ended up being the 
game‚Äôs MVP.


The Warriors weren‚Äôt down for long. They bounced back with a 106-92 win over 
the lowly New York Knicks on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Hawks went on the road to 
face the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday and Memphis ended up scoring the final 
eight points in their 94-88 victory,which they topped off with a pretty choice 
burn on Twitter 
<http://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/02/09/grizzlies-hawks-twitter-account-haks>
.
Memphis Grizzlies (@memgrizz) 
üêª>üêî Good game Haks (No #W <https://twitter.com/hashtag/W?src=hash> tonight)

<https://twitter.com/memgrizz/status/564594800213897216> 
Atlanta shouldn‚Äôt feel too bad. A close loss to the No2 seed in the Western 
Conference on the road and a victory over the Knicks, in any context, should 
probably count for the same amount of points.

This Hawks team have begun winning over their critics 
<http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/5-on-5-150206/atlanta-hawks-golden-state-warriors?ex_cid=espnnbaTwitter>
, but let‚Äôs not automatically assume they‚Äôre destined to make the NBA Finals. 
While they have a pretty solid grasp on the top seed in the Eastern Conference, 
they‚Äôre 7.5 games ahead of the Toronto Raptors, and that may not mean anything 
when the postseason begins. The Cleveland Cavaliers, currently on a 13-1 run, 
might be playing even better basketball and they don‚Äôt necessarily need the 
higher seed if LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love end up peaking right 
around playoff time.

Could Hawks/Cavaliers be the new Eastern Conference Finals matchup to replace 
Miami Heat/Indiana Pacers? It at least is probably a safer bet than trying to 
predict a NBA Finals matchup this early.


All-stars fall: Blake Griffin has surgery, is Carmelo next?

A huge blow to the Los Angeles Clippers‚Äô already rocky season: power forward 
Blake Griffin is out at least three weeks, probably closer to six,after having 
surgery on Monday in order to deal with a staph infection in his right elbow 
<http://www.nba.com/2015/news/02/09/griffin-elbow-surgery/>. The Clippers had 
already been struggling with Griffin and it‚Äôs scary to think how they will 
respond to losing their leading scorer. They had lost four straight games, a 
significant speed bump in the competitive West, before finally notching a win 
over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. It‚Äôs to the point whereanalysts are 
wondering if the sixth-seeded Clippers are at risk of missing the postseason 
altogether 
<http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/2/9/8001497/los-angeles-clippers-playoff-chances-blake-griffin-injury>
.

Because of Griffin‚Äôs surgery, Damian Lillard will take his place in the 
All-Star Game much to the chagrin of the Memphis Grizzlies. After the 
announcement, the Grizzlies‚Äô Tony Allen went on Twitter to joke thatLillard 
only made the All-Star Team over Memphis‚Äôs Mike Conley and Zach Randolph 
because ‚Äúhe wrote a letter.‚Äù 
<http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/2/9/8005061/tony-allen-grizzlies-damian-lillard-all-star-snub>
 Allen was referring toLillard‚Äôs sarcastic note to fans, coaches and NBA 
Commissioner Adam Silver 
<http://www.sbnation.com/2015/1/30/7953169/damian-lillard-calls-out-coaches-adam-silver-for-all-star-snub>
 saying that he would be extra motivated by not being voted in or selected to 
replace the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô Kobe Bryant, who is out for the season.

Allen‚Äôs complaints, like Lillard‚Äôs before him, may turn out to be premature. 
The last few days have put several players‚Äô availability for the All-Star Game 
in question.At the New Orleans Pelicans, Anthony Davis‚Äôs status is uncertain 
<http://espn.go.com/nba/allstar2015/story/_/id/12306317/anthony-davis-new-orleans-pelicans-air-all-star-game-wake-shoulder-injury>
. Davis is suffering from a strained shoulder and the team won‚Äôt clear him for 
the All-Star exhibition until they see how he feels before today‚Äôs regular 
season game against the Indiana Pacers. If Davis can‚Äôt go, it‚Äôs quite likely 
that one of Allen‚Äôs team-mates will get the call to replace him on the Western 
Conference All-Star roster.

On Tuesday, it was announced that the Miami Heat‚Äôs Dwyane Wade, recovering 
from a hamstring injury, would definitely be out,freeing up a spot for the 
Atlanta Hawks‚Äô Kyle Korver 
<http://espn.go.com/nba/allstar2015/story/_/id/12306111/dwyane-wade-miami-heat-play-2015-nba-all-star-game>
. There were also rumors that Carmelo Anthony, who had been putting off having 
surgery so that he could represent the New York Knicks at Madison Square 
Garden, which hosts the All-Star Game,wouldn‚Äôt be able to hold up that long 
after aggravating his already injured knee 
<http://nypost.com/2015/02/10/carmelo-may-skip-all-star-game-with-knee-tendon-damage/>
. Presumably, Anthony‚Äôs potential replacement will be determined by which 
Eastern Conference All-Star snub writes the snarkiest comment on social media.


Chris Paul fined for criticizing female referee

Throughout this cold period, the Los Angeles Clippers have been letting their 
frustrations get the best of them 
<http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2355969-chris-pauls-beef-with-new-referee-a-symptom-of-larger-problem-for-clippers>
. Case in point: last Thursday night, during a demoralizing 105-94 loss to the 
ascendant Cleveland Cavaliers, point guard Chris Paul received a technical foul 
from referee Lauren Holtkamp that he very much believed that he didn‚Äôt deserve. 
After the game,Paul criticized Holtkamp directly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/06/chris-paul-blasts-female-referee-after-loss-this-might-not-be-for-her>
, something which the league dislikes in a general sense,but in this case his 
choice of words sparked a national debate 
<http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/12287430/chris-paul-los-angeles-clippers-frustrated-techs-female-rookie-ref-not-her>
:

The tech that I [got] right there was ridiculous. I don‚Äôt care what nobody 
says, I don‚Äôt care what she says; that‚Äôs terrible. There‚Äôs no way that can be a 
tech. We try to get the ball out fast every time down the court and when we did 
that she said, ‚Äúuh-uh.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWhy, uh-uh?‚Äù And she gave me a tech... That‚Äôs 
ridiculous‚Ä¶ If that‚Äôs the case, this might not be for her.

The troublesome part of Paul‚Äôs otherwise unremarkable airing of complaints was 
the ‚Äúthis might not be for her‚Äù line, where he was explicitly wondering whether 
or not Holtkamp was qualified to be an NBA official. To some, Paul‚Äôs wording 
made it seem like he was suggesting that Holtkamp, whom he explicitly addresses 
as a ‚Äúher,‚Äù might not belong because of her gender. In essence, that Paul was 
spouting a variation on the most common negative response whenever a woman 
enters into a workplace that has almost exclusively been the domain of men: 
‚Äúthey don‚Äôt belong in this line of work, it‚Äôs not their place.‚Äù

Paul, who does have a history of being vocal with officials, probably was not 
consciously intending any sexism in these remarks 
<http://www.bustle.com/articles/62946-chris-paul-criticizing-lauren-holtkamp-wasnt-sexist-but-his-defenders-are>
. After the fallout, Paul insisted that he was only referring to Holtkamp‚Äôs 
status as a rookie official and not her gender. The league apparently gave him 
the benefit of the doubt. The NBA fined Paul $25,000,but reports say this was 
solely for the public criticizing of an official and not for any sexism 
<http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/12292518/chris-paul-los-angeles-clippers-fined-25000-criticizing-official>
.


While the resulting media firestorm may have seemed excessive, it‚Äôs important 
to scrutinize how Holtkamp is treated by all NBA employees. Holtkamp is only 
the third female referee in NBA history and she‚Äôs entering one of the most 
male-dominated work environments in America 
<http://grantland.com/the-triangle/lauren-holtkamp-nba-referee-d-league-wnba/>. 
Even if Paul didn‚Äôt mean to imply that that she was out of her league because 
of her gender, he should have been aware enough in a post-game conference 
setting to know it would come off as sexist.

When the Indiana Pacers‚Äô Roy Hibbert was fined by the league for saying ‚Äúno 
homo‚Äù in a press conference two years back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/03/roy-hibbert-fined-gay-slur> it 
wasn‚Äôt because anyone believed he was consciously being homophobic. The strong 
backlash occurred because Hibbert was, wittingly or not, contributing a 
potentially harmful workplace environment. There was a brief controversy, a 
fine and then the incident was mostly was forgotten as anything but a teachable 
moment.

The same thing should happen here with Paul‚Äôs comments about Holtkamp. Nobody 
was unduly punished, but the controversy that emerged was hopefully enough to 
make players, and other NBA employees, more sensitive about the possible 
implications of what they say publicly.

Other things we‚Äôve learned

‚Ä¢ And we have the first clip for Anthony Davis‚Äôs Hall of Fame reel, this game 
winning three pointer in the New Orleans Pelicans‚Äô 116-113 win over the 
Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday. Note: this was Davis‚Äôs first three-pointer of 
the season. He‚Äôs got good timing.
