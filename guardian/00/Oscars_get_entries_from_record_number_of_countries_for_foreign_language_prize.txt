Academy Awards organisers have received submissions from a record 71 countries 
for this season's foreign-language prize.

This year's Oscar entries include Austria's Amour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amour>, from the director Michael Haneke, 
which won the top prize at last May's Cannes film festival and stars Emmanuelle 
Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant as an elderly couple coping with the wife's 
worsening health. They also include the feature director David "Tosh" Gitonga's 
Nairobi Half Life, the first ever entry ever from Kenya.

Other foreign-language entries include the French hit The Intouchables, from 
the directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, and Sweden's The Hypnotist, 
from Lasse Hallstrom, who also directed The Cider House Rules. Another entry is 
Norway's Kon-Tiki from the directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, which 
chronicles Thor Heyerdahl's Pacific Ocean expedition to prove that South 
Americans could have settled Polynesia. No Iranian film will be submitted in 
protest at the anti-Islam movie recently posted on YouTube.
