In the 1980s, I lived in some pretty shady places. After finishing at 
Sunderland Polytechnic I moved back to London and lived above a pawnbroker on 
Willesden High Road with my best friend and now business partner Richard. I got 
a job atJoe Allen <http://www.joeallen.co.uk>’s as a waiter and bartender, kind 
of by accident, and I started to get interested in food. I became really good 
at one-pot specials and classic dishes, with simple market ingredients – a good 
stew, tagliatelle al ragu, carbonara, risotto …

Living above a pawnbroker’s, there was a stream of interesting characters 
milling around the entrance to our flat. A lot of petty criminals used to think 
our place was connected to the shop, so we’d get broken into about once a week. 
They’d quickly realise though that there was nothing to steal.

It was a three-bedroom flat set over two levels, with pretty nasty decor – 
heavy curtains and old furniture; it may have had patterned wallpaper. It 
definitely had a psychedelic paisley patterned carpet. What made it our own was 
the music we were listening to, and the posters. We were still kids – I was 22. 
Although, I still listen to the same things: The Smiths, Echo and The Bunnymen, 
Orange Juice and Stone Roses. Lots of Stone Roses, Jonathan Richman and the 
Modern Lovers, Van Morrison, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. It was the era of 
VHS, and we had a video rental shop opposite us. We’d frequently be watching 
Withnail and I …

The kitchen was basic – linoleum floor, a small Formica work surface, an 
old-fashioned gas hob. The other two didn’t cook, but I didn’t mind. I was a 
bit of a bully and a control freak in the kitchen – nothing much has changed! 
My wife would probably concur …

It was a good time. We’d eat in once or twice a week. There was a great music 
venue, the Mean Fiddler, a couple of miles away; we’d go and see bands there. 
It felt like a home. And it’s where it all started. Richard and our other 
flatmate, Graham, started their own ad-sales business in our living room, with 
our old dial phone. I thought I was just doing something to tide me over, but 
now I run a business and operate 10 restaurants – so I’d started my career too. 
Nowadays, Richard sits across the office from me every day – we’ve known each 
other for 31 years.

Spaghetti carbonara is one of the dishes I used to make a lot when I was 
teaching myself classic Italian dishes. The internet didn’t exist but I was, 
even then, aware of the debate over whether to use cream or not. I consulted
Elizabeth David 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/oct/18/elizabeth-david-60-years>
,Anna del Conte <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anna-del-conte> and The 
Silver Spoon

. I decided, after trying various recipes, that cream was not necessary, egg 
yolks were better than whole eggs, and a combination of parmesan and pecorino 
gave the dish a lovely balance. The recipe below is the result of those 
experiments. It is important not to cook the yolks, so they must be added while 
the pan is off the heat, otherwise you end up with a scrambled egg appearance. 
The addition of the pasta cooking water takes a bit of practice – you want to 
loosen the sauce and make it yellow and glossy, not thin and watery.

I love cooking at home. I spend all my working hours managing my restaurants, 
but cooking for my family is relaxing. My children are unfussy and adventurous 
– they’ll eat anything I make for them. Lately they’ve started getting into 
spice and chilli, and Mabel, my youngest, is a huge Japanese fan – udon, 
sashimi, sushi.

Spaghetti carbonara

Serves 4
400g dried spaghetti
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
150g pancetta, cut into thick, short matchsticks
Black pepper
4 large egg yolks, beaten
100g parmesan, grated
20g pecorino, grated
1 Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti 
according to the packet’s instructions.

2 Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan and saute 
the pancetta until it is starting to crisp and is turning golden brown.

3 Just before the spaghetti is done, scoop out a cupful of the cooking water 
and set aside. Drain the pasta and transfer to the pan of pancetta. While still 
on a low heat, coat every strand of spaghetti with the oil and make sure the 
pancetta is well incorporated. Add a few good twists of black pepper, too.

4 Remove the pan from the heat. Add the egg yolks and parmesan, then stir well 
with a splash or two of cooking water. Continue until the glossy sauce coats 
all the pasta strands.

5 Divide equally on to four warmed plates. Add the grated pecorino and a few 
more twists of black pepper.
