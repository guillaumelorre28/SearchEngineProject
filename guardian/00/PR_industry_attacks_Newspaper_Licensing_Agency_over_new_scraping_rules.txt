The Chartered Institute of Public Relations is using "nonsensical" to describe 
Newspaper Licensing Agency plans to raise a levy on online news monitoring 
services. Its president Kevin Taylor,writing in PR Week 
<http://community.prweek.com/blogs/firehose/archive/2009/07/14/an-open-letter-to-the-newspaper-licensing-agency-by-kevin-taylor-cipr.aspx>
, says NLA plans to charge commercial B2B aggregators that scrape web stories 
and links are "absolute nonsense".

The agency, which charges news monitoring and PR companies to reproduce 
printed articles from 1,400 member newspapers, will in September extend its own 
remit to cover online services. Though it wasreported at the time 
<http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-wrong-headed-newspaper-biz-tries-again-to-charge-for-links/>
 as effectively taxing those who hyperlink to newspaper stories, the agency 
later confirmed to us that isn't targeting bloggers, consumer services or the 
likes of Google (NSDQ: GOOG 
<http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&Ticker=GOOG>), but the 
"industrial-scale copying of articles from newspaper sites, for private 
commercial purposes".

It named Meltwater <http://meltwater.com/mnews/en/why-media-monitoring>, which 
offers clients a searchable database of 90,000 online news sources in more than 
110 countries, andMoreover <http://w.moreover.com/> as offenders in the 
"content scraping" sector. Moreover hasthreatened to sue 
<http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-moreover-may-sue-newspaper-biz-over-online-copying-levy/>
, and it's thought others may follow suit.

Taylor's CIPR members face further bills if aggregators pass on licensing 
costs to their customers. But Taylor's reading of the new licence may not be 
entirely fair: " If I call someone and tell them a web address – no charge. But 
if I send them the web address by email – that requires an NLA licence."
