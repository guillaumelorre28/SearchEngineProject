An animal-tastic book full of funny animals and a boy with a silly granny.


It is Vince’s birthday and after visiting his gran, who gives him a big orange 
jumper, he goes to see his dad who works at the zoo. Vince normally finds the 
zoo boring, but today’s visit to the penguin reveals another birthday surprise.


 I like Zoo Boy because it is really funny and made me laugh lots. I laughed 
when Vince’s Gran gave him fish fingers for dinner, but forgot to cook them. 
She’s my favourite character, she’s silly and forgetful.

I really liked the song at the end of the book so I made a tune up for it (and 
sang it to my Mummy).

I think my school friends would like to read this book, because it is funny 
like Roald Dahl. I think 7 and 8 year olds might like it too. I give it 5 out 
of 5 because it’s funny and I just wanted to keep reading it.
