<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/harper-lee-author-to-kill-a-mockingbird-dies-alabama?CMP=soc_568>
 on Friday, which was marked by mourning for the novelist whom Barack Obama 
declared “changed America for the better” with her work.

“When Harper Lee <https://www.theguardian.com/books/harper-lee> sat down to 
write To Kill a Mockingbird, she wasn’t seeking awards or fame. She was a 
country girl who just wanted to tell an honest story about life as she saw it,” 
the Obama family said in a statement.

“But what that one story did, more powerfully than one hundred speeches 
possibly could, was change the way we saw each other, and then the way we saw 
ourselves,” they continued. “Through the uncorrupted eyes of a child, she 
showed us the beautiful complexity of our common humanity, and the importance 
of striving for justice in our own lives, our communities, and our country.”


Lee was hailed as a brilliant writer and an extraordinary woman by those who 
paid tribute to her – a crowd that included the friends who knew her and those 
who were inspired by her.

“Knowing Nelle these past few years has been not just an utter delight but an 
extraordinary privilege,” said her literary agent, Andrew Nurnberg, in a 
statement.“When I saw her just six weeks ago, she was full of life, her mind 
and mischievous wit as sharp as ever. She was quoting Thomas More and setting 
me straight on Tudor history. We have lost a great writer, a great friend and a 
beacon of integrity.”

The president and publisher of HarperCollins US, Michael Morrison, also 
commented on the loss of one of the publishing house’s most famous authors.

“The world knows Harper Lee was a brilliant writer but what many don’t know is 
that she was an extraordinary woman of great joyfulness, humility and kindness. 
She lived her life the way she wanted to – in private – surrounded by books and 
the people who loved her. I will always cherish the time I spent with her,” 
Morrison said.

Aaron Sorkin, the writer of The West Wing and The Social Network who last week 
announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/10/aaron-sorkin-to-kill-a-mockingbird-broadway-2017-2018>
 he was working on a Broadway adaption of Lee’s Pulitzer-winning 1960 novel 
about racial prejudice in the American south, told the Guardian: “Like millions 
of others, I was saddened to learn this morning of the passing of Harper Lee, 
one of America’s most beloved authors.”

“I’m honored to have the opportunity to adapt her seminal novel for the 
stage.” Sorkin added in his statement.

Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who has spoken previously about how Lee was one of 
two interviews she’d failed to get 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/11/my-lunch-with-harper-lee-oprah-winfrey-go-set-watchman>
, recounted a line the author told her over a lunch.

Young adult fiction author John Green, whose books include The Fault in Our 
Stars, Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska, recounted a story on Twitter about 
receiving a signed copy of his book from the notoriously media-shy author after 
the birth of his son.

When my son Henry was born, Ms. Lee signed a copy of Looking for Alaska for 
him with the inscription, "Welcome to the world Henry Atticus."

That book is my most prized possession. Ms. Lee lived a private life, but she 
was quietly and extraordinarily generous.
