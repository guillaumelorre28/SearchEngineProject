Shabani Ramadhani has not had an easy life. Orphaned as a young child and 
forced on to the streets, he survived by selling oranges at the side of the 
road. "It was a difficult time," he recalls. "Being a street child can be very 
dangerous." Many children living on the streets are drawn into gangs at a young 
age; they begin to abuse and deal drugs, and this soon leads to violence.

Shabani was offered a lifeline by a businessman who stopped to buy oranges 
from him. He helped Shabani enrol at the Faraja Street Side School, a school 
that helps ex-street children catch up with their missed education. When 
Shabani first arrived he could not read or write, but he studied hard and 
successfully won a place at primary school. "Faraja supported me with my school 
fees and other school materials," he recalls. "Without this, I would still be 
on the street."

Faraja also invited Shabani to undertake research on their behalf for a 
project focused on preventing other children from moving to the street. He 
presented the findings of the research to the minster of children and the 
British high commissioner at an event that received wide coverage in the 
national media. This participatory approach is central to Faraja's work in 
Chamwino, and it has had a transformative and empowering effect on Shabani.

"I face many challenges," he says. "But because of my experiences with Faraja, 
I believe many things are possible for me."
