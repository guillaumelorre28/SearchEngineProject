Earlier today I set you the following puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/07/can-you-solve-it-would-you-get-into-oxbridge>
, from a recent Oxford Mathematics Admissions Test. Thanks to everyone took 
part;more than a thousand comments  
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/07/can-you-solve-it-would-you-get-into-oxbridge#comments>
below the line and several very funny threads.

And I’m very impressed - about 80 per cent of you got each question correct. 
Congratulations, you are all admitted into Oxford! (And next time I will make 
the questions more difficult.)

The question: Alice, Bob and Charlie are well-known expert logicians; they 
always tell the truth. They are sat in a row, as illustrated above. In each of 
the scenarios below, their father puts a red or blue hat on each of their 
heads. Alice can see Bob’s and Charlie’s hats, but not her own; Bob can see 
only Charlie’s hat; Charlie can see none of the hats. All three of them are 
aware of this arrangement.

(i) Their father puts a hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of your 
hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat.” Alice then says 
“I know the colour of my hat.” What colour is each person’s hat?

(ii) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and again says: “Each 
of your hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat.” Alice 
then says “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” Bob then says “I don’t know the 
colour of my hat.” What colour is Charlie’s hat?

(iii) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of 
your hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat, and at 
least one of you has a blue hat.” Alice says “I know the colour of my hat.” Bob 
then says “Mine is red.” What colour is each person’s hat?

(iv) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of 
your hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat, and at 
least one of you has a blue hat.” Alice then says “I don’t know the colour of 
my hat.” Bob then says “My hat is red”. What colour is Charlie’s hat?

(v) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of your 
hats is either red or blue. Two of you who are seated adjacently both have red 
hats.” Alice then says “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” What colour is 
Charlie’s hat?

Solutions

(i) Alice’s hat is red, and the others are blue. It must be that Alice can see 
that neither of the others has a red hat, so can deduce the colour of her own.

Charlie’s hat is blue. 83.2 per cent of you got it correct. 16.8 per cent got 
it wrong.

(ii) Alice must be able to see a red hat, or would be able to deduce the 
colour of her own hat. Likewise, Bob must be able to see a red hat, or would be 
able to deduce the colour of his own hat (given Alice’s answer). Hence 
Charlie’s hat is red.

Charlie’s hat is red. 74.1 per cent of you got it correct. 25.9 per cent got 
it wrong.

(iii) Alice must be able to see two hats of the same colour in order to deduce 
the colour of her hat. Bob knows this, and so deduces his hat is the same 
colour as Charlie’s. Hence Alice’s hat is blue, and Bob’s and Charlie’s are red.

Charlie’s hat is red. 78.8 per cent of you got it correct. 21.2 per cent got 
it wrong.

(iv) Alice must be able to see two hats of opposite colours, or else she would 
be able to deduce her own hat colour. Bob knows this, so deduces his hat is a 
different colour from Charlie’s. Hence Charlie’s hat is blue.

Charlie’s hat is blue. 89.2 per cent of you got it correct. 10.8 per cent got 
it wrong.

(v) If Bob and Charlie had different colour hats, Alice would know that she 
and Bob both had red hats. Therefore Bob and Charlie both have red hats.

Charlie’s hat is red. 82.7 per cent of you got it correct. 17.3 per cent got 
it wrong.

The question was Q6 from the 2012 Oxford Mathematics Admissions Test and was 
for applicants to Computer Science,Mathematics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/mathematics> & Computer Science and 
Computer Science & Philosophy only.

I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. If you would like to suggest 
a puzzleemail me <mailto:bellospuzzle@gmail.com>.

My puzzle book Can You Solve My Problems? A Casebook of Ingenious, Perplexing 
and Totally Satisfying Puzzles 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/can-you-solve-my-problems.html> is just out. 
It is an anthology of almost 200 puzzles - some of them similar to the hat 
puzzle above - together with stories about the people who invented them and 
background on the maths involved.
