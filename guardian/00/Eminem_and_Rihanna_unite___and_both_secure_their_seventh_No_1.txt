This week's new charts show that seven is a lucky number for both Eminem and 
Rihanna. Eminem's comeback single The Monster, featuring Rihanna, is a seventh 
UK No 1 for both artists. What's more, Rihanna has become only the third act to 
score seven No 1s over seven years, followingElvis Presley

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles>.

The Monster held off One Direction's Story of My Life to take the top spot, 
despite being released a day later than 1D's single. It is Eminem's first UK No 
1 since he appeared on Akon'sSmack That

In the album charts, Reflektor by Arcade Fire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/24/arcade-fire-reflektor-review> 
went straight in at No 1, knocking Katy Perry's Prism off its perch.Lorde's 
album Pure Heroine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2013/nov/01/lorde-pure-heroine-video-review>
 is also a new entry, at No 4.

As expected, James Blake benefited from a sales bounce in the wake of his 
Mercury music prize win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/31/mercury-prize-winner-james-blake>
. His second album, Overgrown, was outside the top 200 last week, but has risen 
to No 23 since last Wednesday's awards.
