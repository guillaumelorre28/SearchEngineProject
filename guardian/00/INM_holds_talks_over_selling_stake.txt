Independent News & Media has received approaches from groups looking to take a 
strategic stake, one of which is understood to be German media giantAxel 
Springer <https://www.theguardian.com/media/axel-springer>.

The publisher of the Independent and Independent on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/independent-on-sunday> is said to have held 
discussions with Axel Springer, publisher of newspapers including Bild, with an 
eye to the German company taking a significant stake in the group. The recent 
talks, which are understood to have broken down, would have seen a dilution of 
the 28% stake held by INM founder Anthony O'Reilly and the 26% owned by his 
bitter rival, Denis O'Brien.

"There have been a number of approaches by parties with a potential interest 
in making strategic investments and reflecting the stated value of the company 
at present," said a spokesman for INM.

The discussions about new backers have emerged as relations between the 
O'Reilly and O'Brien camp have reached breaking point.

It has emerged that, in a conference call made in late August, O'Brien 
reportedly threatened to "destroy" Gavin O'Reilly

chief executive of Dublin-based INM, and his father Anthony if an outright 
battle for the company were to take place.

Last week O'Brien called for an extraordinary general meeting to put a set of 
resolutions to shareholders, including a call to replace chairman Brian Hillery 
and halt the sale of INM's South African outdoor advertising business.

In a six-page letter, O'Brien also described the Independent and Independent 
on Sunday as a"vanity project" which is losing €75,000 to €80,000 (£65,000 - 
£70,000) a day

.

"It is difficult to see how Mr O'Brien's obsession with historic losses at the 
UK nationals assists in any way with addressing the company's immediate 
priority of financial stability," said a spokesman for INM.

One source close to the company said that the papers' losses are less than 
half the amount stated by O'Brien and that it would cost more to close them 
than to bring them through to break even. Late last month Gavin O'Reilly 
pledged that the two papers, which earlier this year moved into Daily Mail & 
General Trust's Kensington offices in order to cut costs, wouldbreak even 
within the next two years

.

The company, which has debts of €1.3bn, has been locked in talks with its 
banks and bondholders for several months, trying to put together a finance 
package to cover €200m of debt which has been owed since May.

"INM has no intention of engaging in a 'tit for tat' review of history," said 
a spokesman for the firm. "The group's clear strategy is to bring the UK 
nationals to profitability and, assuming that the advertising market will 
neither recover nor worsen, the company anticipates the titles breaking even 
within 15 months."

"In contrast, an immediate closure of these titles – as mooted by Denis 
O'Brien – would carry significant guaranteed contractual costs for INM plc (up 
to £30m), which would further undermine the financial stability of the 
company," the spokesman added. "In fact, cash losses to break-even on the Indy 
are less than half estimated closing costs. UK Indy losses have been reduced by 
nearly 30% year on year, as reported in the recent first half results 
presentation."
