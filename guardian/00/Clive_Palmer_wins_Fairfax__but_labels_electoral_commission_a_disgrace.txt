Clive Palmer <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/clive-palmer> has 
labelled Australia's electoral commission "a national disgrace" despite 
apparently winning the seat of Fairfax.

Palmer finished 36 votes ahead of his Liberal National party opponent Ted 
O'Brien on Saturday, but the mining magnate will have to sweat out a recount 
before he can claim victory.

While Palmer calls for reform of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), 
O'Brien said the Fairfax count was a "great example of democracy in action".

Palmer said he was amazed he finished with more votes and would continue to 
"pursue the AEC and push for reform".

"I will continue to fight to hold the AEC accountable as they've shown 
themselves to be greatly incompetent with no transparency," Palmer said in a 
statement.

"We will be highlighting the many discrepancies we've uncovered in the court 
of disputed returns.

"The ballots have no security and the AEC is a national disgrace that needs to 
be heavily scrutinised."

O'Brien thanked those involved in the count.

"While the past two weeks may have been intense for everyone involved, it has 
also been a great example of democracy in action," the first-time campaigner 
said.

"When all is said and done, it's up to the people to decide who they want 
representing them."

The AEC will begin a recount of the Sunshine Coast based seat on Monday â€“ more 
than two weeks after the election.

"There will be a full distribution of preferences, which is a fresh count in 
any case," AEC spokesman Phil Diak said.

A recount is automatically triggered when there are fewer than 100 votes 
separating two candidates after all preferences have been distributed.

Palmer led by 111 votes when counting began on Saturday morning, but his lead 
shrank as votes were tallied.
