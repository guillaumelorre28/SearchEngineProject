Ok, that’ll do for tonight. Now go out and play. Thanks for your company and 
be sure not to be a stranger over the next few days, as there’ll be some great 
coverage of the rest of the Week Of Football in these here parts. ‘Night.

So that wraps that up. Anything you saw in any of the more “fringe” games that

In the end, the story of the night might have been that 
blink-and-you’d-miss-it Chiellini salvo.Nearly a very embarrassing night for 
Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy>, who you might remember were 
held at home by Armenia in a World Cup qualifier and similarly detained by 
Luxembourg in the friendly before Brazil 2014. Not quite that outcome tonight, 
though, as the Juventus man bagged all three – one of them for the Azerbaijanis.

FULL-TIME: WALES 0-0 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA

One of the better 0-0s. I think that goes down as a reasonable point for both. 
It drifted at times but there was always the sniff of a chance around the 
corner. Bale nearly won it at the end with a quite superb bit of solo play and 
Ashley Williams should really have scored before that. Bosnia controlled the a 
large chunk of play either side of half time and Wales were particularly 
thankful for Wayne Hennessey. Both teams kept a threat throughout without 
looking completely convincing in either box; both will have regrets but also 
reason to be grateful. Wales now host Cyprus on Monday; Bosnia welcomeBelgium

90+3 min: Bale nearly wins it! Bale is all on his own, nobody to help him in 
the Bosnian half, rakes in a wonderful low strike which Begovic fingertips wide 
brilliantly! Then Robson Kanu makes a hash of his corner right in front of 
goal! They really could have taken it here.

GOALS! ITALY 2-1 AZERBAIJAN!

Wow – firstly, Chiellini scores an own goal to score a shock leveller for the 
Azerbaijanis. Then, he pops up minutes later to score his third of the game! 
All in a night’s work for the defender.

GOAL! LATVIA 0-2 ICELAND!

Another goal from a Cardiff player. Goals everywhere tonight except for – wait

replacing Ibisevic.

GOAL! NETHERLANDS 2-1 KAZAKHSTAN!

And now the Dutch have their winner. Robben’s cross is headed out to Afellay, 
whose left-footed shot is speculative but takes a big deflection and 
wrong-foots Mokin. Harsh, but enough. Eight to play.

76 min: Save from Mokin! Robben cuts in yet again but eschews the blast and 
chips, Sneijder-like in Huntelaar, who controls, turns and sees a shot saved by 
the ‘keeper’s legs. Attack vs defence here.

73 min: From Paul Done – “I’m glad to see that Immobile survived that 
near-fatal touch of the boots. He was screaming like a man on fire, so I can 
only surmise that the players from the Land of Fire also have the Touch of 
Fire.”

Ah, I’ve not got that one on. How’s it looking?

73 min: Holland are yet to find the second goal that you fancied them for, but 
Robben has a free kick right on the edge of the area, a little to the right. 
BANG! It’s off the crossbar! Fine effort.

their first major tournament (which I’d back them to do....). It’s Swansea’s 
Gylfi Sigurdsson in the 66th minute.

69 min: Chester handballs Ibisevic’s dink through towards Dzeko, and it’s a 
free kick 25 yards out. Pjanic, hands on hips, means business. One step, two, 
three....and just wide of a flailing Hennessey’s right post! Fine effort.

65 min: Bale gets away down the left, fed by the recoverd Williams, and whips 
in a delicious ball just ahead of Church. The striker then comes off for 
Robson-Kanu, so Williams is clearly ok. There is still a corner to be taken, 
which Chester heads over.

63 min: Well would you look at that, Williams is back on. Hal Robson-Kanu had 
been readied but no, the youngster is made of very tough stuff. It had seemed 
like game over. The Bale takes a corner and Ledley heads towards goal, but it’s 
booted well clear.

61 min: Not good in Cardiff for Wales as Jonny Williams, who has been the 
subject of constant attention, needs extensive treatment and is helped very 
awkwardly to his feet. Not sure we’ll see loads more of him. Bad news for him,
Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales>, Palace and Ipswich.

GOAL! NETHERLANDS 1-1 KAZAKHSTAN!

But he’s beaten now as Huntelaar, who may be coming back from an offside 
position, guides a lovely header past him from 12 yards in the 62nd minute. 
They’ll do well to hold out now...

60 min: Kazakhstan’s goalkeeper, Mokin, is not the most imposing but is coming 
for absolutely everything and catching, fisting.....and not yet flapping, 
really. He’s right on the edge but it’s an admirable policy at the moment.

57 min: Now Medunjanin occupies what we shall dub the Pjanic Pocket, and hits 
a left-footer that Hennessey has to shovel away to his right. Bosnia have got 
this, at the moment.

In Amsterdam, close from Van Persie! He hammers across goal when he should do 
better and gets a glare from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who is on for Nigel de Jong 
in a move that should tell you how attack-minded the Dutch are going to be in 
the next half-hour.

straight to Pjanic, who drives another ball in and Ashley Williams has to clear 
hurriedly. They keep the ball and win a corner...

Ok, that’ll do for tonight. Now go out and play. Thanks for your company and 
be sure not to be a stranger over the next few days, as there’ll be some great 
coverage of the rest of the Week Of Football in these here parts. ‘Night.
 
So that wraps that up. Anything you saw in any of the more “fringe” games that 
might be worthy of comment?
 
In the end, the story of the night might have been that 
blink-and-you’d-miss-it Chiellini salvo.Nearly a very embarrassing night for 
Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/italy>, who you might remember were 
held at home by Armenia in a World Cup qualifier and similarly detained by 
Luxembourg in the friendly before Brazil 2014. Not quite that outcome tonight, 
though, as the Juventus man bagged all three – one of them for the Azerbaijanis.
 
Belgium 6-0 Andorra <https://www.theguardian.com/football/andorra>

Italy 2-1 Azerbaijan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/azerbaijan>

Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> 0-0 Bosnia

Turkey 1-2 Czech Republic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/czechrepublic>

Bulgaria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bulgaria> 0-1 Croatia

Latvia 0-3 Iceland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland>

Cyprus 1-2 Israel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/israel>

Netherlands 3-1 Kazakhstan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/kazakhstan>

Malta 0-3 Norway <https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway>
 
One of the better 0-0s. I think that goes down as a reasonable point for both. 
It drifted at times but there was always the sniff of a chance around the 
corner. Bale nearly won it at the end with a quite superb bit of solo play and 
Ashley Williams should really have scored before that. Bosnia controlled the a 
large chunk of play either side of half time and Wales were particularly 
thankful for Wayne Hennessey. Both teams kept a threat throughout without 
looking completely convincing in either box; both will have regrets but also 
reason to be grateful. Wales now host Cyprus on Monday; Bosnia welcomeBelgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium>.
 
90+4 min: That, by the way, was a really top-drawer save by Begovic.
 
90+3 min: Bale nearly wins it! Bale is all on his own, nobody to help him in 
the Bosnian half, rakes in a wonderful low strike which Begovic fingertips wide 
brilliantly! Then Robson Kanu makes a hash of his corner right in front of 
goal! They really could have taken it here.
 
90+2 min: We’re in the second of four added minutes in Cardiff.
 
GOAL! LATVIA 0-3 ICELAND!

Rurik Gislason puts the....errr....icing on this one at the end.
 
GOALS! ITALY 2-1 AZERBAIJAN!

Wow – firstly, Chiellini scores an own goal to score a shock leveller for the 
Azerbaijanis. Then, he pops up minutes later to score his third of the game! 
All in a night’s work for the defender.
 
88 min: Robson-Kanu’s shot is deflected just wide! Then Bale’s corner is taken 
just away from the waiting Ashley Williams by Lulic.Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> have ridden their luck at times 
and have had to defend, but they have always carried a threat here.
 
DUTCH PENALTY...AND A GOAL! 3-1!

That’s very much that. Van Persie converts to Mokin’s right and Kazakhstan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/kazakhstan>, their resistance very brave 
tonight, are finished. The Dutch have not played well though.
 
87 min: Strong run by Bale down the right though, goes down and there are big 
calls for a penalty, but the referee isn’t up for it.
 
86 min: Chris Coleman makes some odd cutty-throaty gestures. The Bosnian fans 
are dancing a Poznan.
 
GOAL! LATVIA 0-2 ICELAND!

Another goal from a Cardiff player. Goals everywhere tonight except for – wait 
for it – Cardiff. Aron Gunnarson, on 77, has surely won it there.
 
83 min: Now Jonny Williams does come off, and he deserves the rest to be fair 
– namesake George of Fulham is on. Izet Hajrovic is on for Bosnia too, 
replacing Ibisevic.
 
82 min: And now so close from another Pjanic free-kick! A marvellous Hennesey 
save under the crossbar. Then Bale, at the other end, drills a low right-footer 
to Begovic.
 
GOAL! NETHERLANDS 2-1 KAZAKHSTAN!

And now the Dutch have their winner. Robben’s cross is headed out to Afellay, 
whose left-footed shot is speculative but takes a big deflection and 
wrong-foots Mokin. Harsh, but enough. Eight to play.
 
80 min: And the chance of the match in Cardiff! Ashley Williams has the most 
free of headers at the back post from a Bale free-kick, but gets it all wrong 
and it’s well over! The Begovic is out smartly to deny Jonny.Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> rallying.
 
80 min: Something I missed in Holland-Kazakhstan (with thanks to a couple of 
you and Uefa.com) – the Kazakhs are now down to 10 men, red card for Dzolchiev. 
They’re hanging on like crazy.
 
77 min: Just a bit more ragged from the Bosnians now, and Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> aren’t really breaking their 
depleted back four down either. This one is, as things stand, petering out 
towards a mutually-acceptable draw.
 
76 min: Save from Mokin! Robben cuts in yet again but eschews the blast and 
chips, Sneijder-like in Huntelaar, who controls, turns and sees a shot saved by 
the ‘keeper’s legs. Attack vs defence here.
 
74 min: All of these games, apart from Malta 0-3 Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway>, are very well poised at the 
moment.
 
73 min: From Paul Done – “I’m glad to see that Immobile survived that 
near-fatal touch of the boots. He was screaming like a man on fire, so I can 
only surmise that the players from the Land of Fire also have the Touch of 
Fire.”

Ah, I’ve not got that one on. How’s it looking?
 
73 min: Holland are yet to find the second goal that you fancied them for, but 
Robben has a free kick right on the edge of the area, a little to the right. 
BANG! It’s off the crossbar! Fine effort.
 
GOAL! CYPRUS 1-2 ISRAEL!

Some late interest in this one? Constantinos Makridis has just scored for the 
home side and there are still 23 minutes to play.
 
GOAL! BELGIUM 6-0 ANDORRA!

Mertens again on 68.
 
GOAL! LATVIA 0-1 ICELAND!

And that’s the kind of outcome Iceland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/iceland> will want if they’re to make 
their first major tournament (which I’d back them to do....). It’s Swansea’s 
Gylfi Sigurdsson in the 66th minute.
 
69 min: Chester handballs Ibisevic’s dink through towards Dzeko, and it’s a 
free kick 25 yards out. Pjanic, hands on hips, means business. One step, two, 
three....and just wide of a flailing Hennessey’s right post! Fine effort.
 
GOAL! BELGIUM 5-0 ANDORRA!

Yeah, why not? Dries Mertens (65).
 
65 min: Bale gets away down the left, fed by the recoverd Williams, and whips 
in a delicious ball just ahead of Church. The striker then comes off for 
Robson-Kanu, so Williams is clearly ok. There is still a corner to be taken, 
which Chester heads over.
 
GOAL! TURKEY 1-2 CZECH REPUBLIC!

And that’s a big one in Istanbul! Borek Dockal in the 58th minute for the 
visitors!
 
GOAL! BELGIUM 4-0 ANDORRA!

It’s Divock Origi, of Liverpool-in-waiting, in the 59th.
 
63 min: Well would you look at that, Williams is back on. Hal Robson-Kanu had 
been readied but no, the youngster is made of very tough stuff. It had seemed 
like game over. The Bale takes a corner and Ledley heads towards goal, but it’s 
booted well clear.
 
61 min: Not good in Cardiff for Wales as Jonny Williams, who has been the 
subject of constant attention, needs extensive treatment and is helped very 
awkwardly to his feet. Not sure we’ll see loads more of him. Bad news for him,
Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales>, Palace and Ipswich.
 
GOAL! NETHERLANDS 1-1 KAZAKHSTAN!

But he’s beaten now as Huntelaar, who may be coming back from an offside 
position, guides a lovely header past him from 12 yards in the 62nd minute. 
They’ll do well to hold out now...
 
60 min: Kazakhstan’s goalkeeper, Mokin, is not the most imposing but is coming 
for absolutely everything and catching, fisting.....and not yet flapping, 
really. He’s right on the edge but it’s an admirable policy at the moment.
 
57 min: Now Medunjanin occupies what we shall dub the Pjanic Pocket, and hits 
a left-footer that Hennessey has to shovel away to his right. Bosnia have got 
this, at the moment.

In Amsterdam, close from Van Persie! He hammers across goal when he should do 
better and gets a glare from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who is on for Nigel de Jong 
in a move that should tell you how attack-minded the Dutch are going to be in 
the next half-hour.
 
55 min: “I noticed the Wales team includes Ledley and King - I was wondering 
if the great Spurs defender finally broke into two pieces, and each half was 
able to make it into theWales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> 
team?”

I’d always trusted people never to make that joke.
 
GOAL! MALTA 0-3 NORWAY!

Amid all that, Blackburn’s King has his second on 49 minutes. Norway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/norway> are another improving team.
 
54 min:...which Ibisevic keeps alive really well, finding Susic – whose cross 
loops off a defender’s head to Dzeko. Dzeko stands his ground and wins a really 
good header, down across Hennessey, who has to save very well indeed!
 
53 min: Bosnia really pressing. Taylor should leave a Susic cross but heads 
straight to Pjanic, who drives another ball in and Ashley Williams has to clear 
hurriedly. They keep the ball and win a corner...
 
51 min: End-to-end now in Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> 
as Hennessey is out to block from Medunjanin after a left-sided cross before 
Jonny Williams, bursting forwards with men to the left and right, shoots and 
sees it blocked. Then Dzeko has space to drive forward and his first effort is 
saved.
