A Jamaica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/jamaica> footballer tested 
positive for a banned substance after a World Cup qualifying match against 
Honduras, in the latest doping case involving the Caribbean island's athletes.

The Jamaica Football Federation said it was notified by Fifa that a "member of 
the Jamaican squad returned an adverse analytical finding on his urine sample" 
after the 11 June game. The player and the substance involved were not 
identified.

"The player has been informed and we await further information from Fifa," the 
federation said in a statement late on Wednesday. "The JFF has taken this 
matter very seriously and a thorough investigation has already started by the 
chairman of the JFF Medical Committee."

Last week, the Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson

were confirmed to have tested positive foroxilofrine, a banned stimulant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/15/tyson-gay-asafa-powell-oxilofrine>
, among five cases involving track and field athletes.

The JFF said that Fifa will manage the case. The player is likely to receive a 
provisional ban during disciplinary proceedings.

In a previous doping case, the Peru midfielder Joel Sánchez was provisionally 
suspended when testing positive for the stimulant methylhexaneamine after a 1-1 
draw in Bolivia last October.

Fifa suspended Sánchez from all football for two years in March. Jamaica lost 
2-0 in Honduras and are bottom of a six-team Concacef qualifying group led by 
the United States.
