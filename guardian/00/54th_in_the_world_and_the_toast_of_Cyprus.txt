The unheralded Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis is ranked only 54th in the world and 
comes from a country which, until recently, barely registered on the world of 
tennis.

Baghdatis, 20 - who had struggled to get exemption from mandatory military 
service that threatened his career - claimed easily his biggest victory when he 
toppled the second seed Andy Roddick in Melbourne.

Since turning professional in 2003 Baghdatis has earned less than $400,00 
(£225,000), compared with Roddick's $9.5m (£5.3m). The Cypriot, a former junior 
world No1, has reached only one final, in Basle last year. Victory over Roddick 
carried him into his first grand slam quarter-final at his sixth attempt.

Cyprus is bursting with pride. "We have no history in tennis," said Philios 
Christodoulou, chairman of the CyprusTennis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Federation. "A few years ago I would 
say that less than 1% of the population knew how to play.

"It was always affiliated with the colonial administration, the British 
playing in the tennis courts outside their homes, the elite. But the federation 
has managed to change that perception. It is a sport open to everybody. Now we 
have young children asking to become a second Marcos."

However, players still have to go abroad if they want to turn professional. 
Baghdatis left Cyprus at 14 for a tennis academy in France because he needed to 
train against players of the same calibre, Christodoulou said."We are so proud. 
This is a deep honour for us," he added.
