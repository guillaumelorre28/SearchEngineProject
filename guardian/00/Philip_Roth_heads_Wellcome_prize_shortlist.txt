With the niftiness of a small scouting submarine dodging the a fleet of 
battleships, theWellcome book prize <http://www.wellcomebookprize.org/> has 
darted between the flotilla of Nobel prizes to announce its shortlist for 
medicine in literature.

The three-year-old prize carries a Â£25,000 purse. It has yet to go to a work 
of fiction, but intriguingly four of this year's six shortlisted books are 
novels.

The highest profile of the quartet is Phlip Roth's Nemesis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780224089531/nemesis>, 
whose central character is a teacher faced in his youth with a polio epidemic 
in the days before a vaccine was invented. "A misplaced sense of responsibility 
can be a debilitating thing", his girlfriend's doctor father tells him.

Anne Patchett's State of Wonder  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781408818596/state-of-wonder>
sends a pharmacologist into the Amazonian jungle to investigate, among other 
things, why the women of a remote tribe are able to bear children into their 
seventies.

Louisa Young's My Dear I Wanted to Tell You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780007361434/my-dear-i-wanted-to-tell-you>
, meanwhile, involves plastic surgery in the first world war., while Alice 
LaPlante's debut novel Turn of Mind  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9781846554636/turn-of-mind>
joins the growing legions of novels dealing with the ravages of Alzheimer's.

The two non-fiction titles include Siddhartha Mukherjee's Pulitzer-winning 
biography of cancer,The Emperor of All Maladies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/healthmindandbody/9780007250912/the-emperor-of-all-maladies>
, which also features on theGuardian first book prize longlist. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/31/guardian-first-book-award-longlist?INTCMP=SRCH>

The sixth title is poet Sarah Manguso's memoir of dealing with an auto-immune 
disease,The Two Kinds of Decay. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/healthmindandbody/9781847083081/the-two-kinds-of-decay>

The winner will be announced on November 9.
