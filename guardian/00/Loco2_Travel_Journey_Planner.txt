Jamie Andrews and Eugene Bolshakov explain what they built and how they built 
it ina guest blog post on the Open Platform web site 
<https://www.theguardian.com/open-platform/blog/local-content-for-local-travel>:

We started building Loco2's journey planning application 
<http://loco2travel.com/journeyplanner> because we wanted to make it much 
easier for environmentally-aware travellers to find viable alternatives to 
flying. Taking the train instead of the plane can save up to 90% of CO2 for 
European journeys, but travelling beyond Paris or Brussels can seem a little 
daunting.

Once we have verified that the location name is recognised by Geonames we post 
it to the Guardian API. We search for all articles that have the location name 
in the body, and then filter the results to discard everything except those 
tagged with 'travel'.
