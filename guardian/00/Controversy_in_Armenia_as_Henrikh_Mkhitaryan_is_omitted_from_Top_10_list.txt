The Top 10 list was compiled by the Federation of Sports Journalists of Armenia
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenia> and there was not too much debate 
about the choice of the Greco-Roman wrestler, and Olympic gold medallist in 
Rio, Artur Aleksanyan, as No1 on the list.

However, the omission of Mkhitaryan, who joined United from Borussia Dortmund 
in the summer and scoreda brilliant goal in Monday’s 3-1 win over Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/26/manchester-united-sunderland-premier-league-match-report>
 at Old Trafford, raised eyebrows, especially as the same panel of journalists 
then voted him as Armenia’s footballer of the year for the seventh year in 
succession.

The president of the Football Federation of Armenia, Ruben Hayrapetyan, made 
an indirect statement on the federation’s website that not including Mkhitaryan 
had been done on purpose. He said: “We can’t deny Mkhitaryan’s contribution and 
achievements in this sport, and everyone knows about it, even those who tried 
to compose tales about how they chose the top athletes of the year.

“It’s immoral that the overwhelming majority of sport journalists, who have 
taken part in the same voting, start their professional business with news 
about Henrikh Mkhitaryan and end it again with Henrikh Mkhitaryan every single 
day.”
