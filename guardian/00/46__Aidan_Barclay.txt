Staff: 974

2009 ranking: 38

Aidan Barclay's year will be principally remembered for the sudden departure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/05/will-lewis-telegraph-media-group>
 of the Telegraph's editor,Will Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/08/will-lewis-talks-news-international>
. But it was also the year in which the Telegraph Media Group, owned and 
controlled byreclusive twins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/09/mediatop1002007.mondaymediasection31>
 Sir David (Aidan's father) and Sir Frederick Barclay,powered to pre-tax profits
 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/19/telegraph-media-group-profit> 
of £53.1m.

Profit-making newspaper groups are thin on the ground, and Barclay has 
overseen a transformation of the Telegraph Media Group since he was put in 
charge in 2004.

Lewis, the Telegraph's award-winning editor-in-chief, departed after a 
disagreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/may/06/willlewis-telegraphmediagroup>
 over the future direction of the publisher's digital operations which he was
put in charge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/30/telegraph-digital-will-lewis-euston-project>
 of last year. Barclay was close to Lewis, but not close enough to keep him his 
job.

Lewis's departure signalled yet another change at the top 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/26/telegraph-editor-tony-gallagher> 
of the Telegraph, which has now seen nine different editors on its daily and 
Sunday titles since the Barclaysbought the group for £665m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/22/thedailytelegraph.citynews>.

Aidan Barclay <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aidanbarclay> is in charge of 
the day-to-day running of the papers and also oversees another part of the 
Barclays' publishing empire, the Spectator.

He first appeared in this list in 2001 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/16/mediatop100200167> when, as the 
chairman of the Barclays' Press Holdings, he oversaw a much smaller media 
empire including the Scotsman stable of newspapers – sold in 2006 – and the 
now-defunct Sunday Business. Itexpanded with the purchase 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/23/pressandpublishing.business> of 
the Telegraph group three years later.

Barclay was responsible for a huge turnover in staff - and editors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/05/pressandpublishing1> – axing the 
Telegraph old guard and rushing to embrace the digital era with a move to a new 
HQ in Victoria. But he stopped short of changing the paper's broadsheet format.

Like his father and uncle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/09/mediatop1002007.mondaymediasection31>
, who live on a private island in the Channel Islands, Barclay avoids the 
public eye andrefused to appear 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/27/telegraphmediagroup.pressandpublishing>
 before a House of Lords committee investigating media ownership.

The extent to which he interferes in his paper's editorial line is in dispute 
– the former Sunday Telegraph editor Dominic Lawson saidhe tried 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/21/dailytelegraph.telegraphmediagroup>
; Lewis said hedid not 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/10/dailytelegraph.sundaytelegraph>.

The group's pre-tax profit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/19/telegraph-media-group-profit> of 
£53.1m last year, up from a £15.7m pre-tax loss the previous year, wasboosted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/25/telegraph-media-group-land-sale> 
by the sale of land and the lower than expected cost of ending its printing 
joint ventures.
