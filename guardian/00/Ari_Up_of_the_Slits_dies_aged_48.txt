Ari Up <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ari-up>, frontwoman of the 
celebrated British post-punk band the Slits, has died at the age of 48.

The singer, born Arianna Forster, passed away yesterday (20 October) after a 
"serious illness".

The announcement was made by representatives of Forster's stepfather, John 
Lydon, last night. A statement on his website reads: "John and Nora have asked 
us to let everyone know that Nora's daughter Arianna (Ari Up) died today after 
a serious illness. She will be sadly missed. Everyone at JohnLydon.com and 
PiLOfficial.com would like me to pass on our heartfelt condolences to John, 
Nora and family. Rest In Peace."

The Slits emerged from the British punk scene and became known for their 
fusion of post-punk with dub and reggae. They released two albums, 1979's Cut 
and 1981's Return of the Giant Slits, as well as an untitled collection of 
demos in 1980.

After the band split, Forster moved with her husband and children to the 
jungle regions of Indonesia and Belize, before heading to Jamaica and settling 
in Kingston. There, she continued to make music in the New Age Steppers and 
released solo material as Baby Ari, Ari Up and Madussa.

In 2005 the Slits re-formed and the following year they released a new EP, 
Revenge of the Killer Slits.
