Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga’s much anticipated collaboration Cheek to Cheek 
drops on Tuesday. The two are as unlikely a duo as it gets, and yet their debut 
album is surprisingly brilliant: a cheeky throwback record that that offers 
Bennett the chance to connect to younger fans, and gives Gaga the chance to 
showcase those fine pipes, often masked under layers and layers of dirty 
synths. In light of the wonderfully strange pairing, we look at 10 other odd 
couples who made beautiful music together.

The Grammys are known for throwing artists together and praying for something 
magical. The results vary from “meh” to “terrible.” But their instincts were 
wildly correct when pairing Imagine Dragons with Kendrick Lamar. Lamar 
certainly didn’t need any help in boosting his image, but collaborating with 
him helped Imagine Dragons gain new fans who had previously dismissed the group 
as “that band from those car commercials.” Their remix of the bro-y Radioactive 
with Lamar’s spitfire, mind-blowing rap verses finally proved that rap and rock 
could not only work together, but could make truly memorable music.

Kanye West and Bon Iver

Kanye has proved to be of this generation’s most inventive and unique 
performers; experimenting, innovating, and creating music that is thoughtful 
(Homecoming, featuring Chris Martin) and groundbreaking (Stronger, featuring 
Daft Punk’s Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger). Lost in the World, Kanye’s first 
collaboration with Bon Iver (Justin Vernon), was a timely and haunting 
conclusion to his last masterpiece, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Vernon’s 
haunting voice and lyrics about alienation pair perfectly with West’s sharp 
verse, as well as additional left-field samples from Manu Dibango’s Soul 
Makossa and Gil Scott-Heron’s Comment No 1.

James Blake and Chance the Rapper

Consider Blake and Chance to be the younger, fresher version of Bon Iver and 
Kanye West. Soulful, lonely singer-songwriter plus cheeky, introspective rapper 
equals winning combination. This track, however, was built from Blake’s synthy 
yet occasionally blank-sounding Life Round Here and turned into a complete gem. 
Chance’s sparkling flow is a perfect match to the starkness of Blake’s 
production work. This collaboration appears to have been a winner for both 
performers as they soon after announced they would live together as roommates 
in Los Angeles to work on more music.

Who would have thought the percussionist of an uber-buzzy British band would 
not only collaborate with a spoken word artist who first came to prominence in 
the 60s, but create an entire remix of his work? Jamie xx (Jamie Smith) andGil 
Scott-Heron <https://www.theguardian.com/music/gil-scott-heron> seem like the 
least likely of duos, and yet We’re New Here was a stunning masterwork of 
remixes that were perfect for dance floors and late nights. Smith was 
originally approached by XL head honcho Richard Russell to remix Scott-Heron’s 
album and the two communicated with each other through letters to rework 
material. Smith’s post-dubstep flourishes turned Scott-Heron’s stunning 2010 
studio album, I’m New Here, into an undeniable peak moment for both performers.

Phantogram and Big Boi

Anyone that knows Big Boi knows the Outkast rapper has outré tastes. For one, 
he’s probably the biggestKate Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush>
 fan in the world. And based on his numerous collaborations with New York-based 
Phantogram, he’s also clearly a fan of angular, trippy synth-pop. Objectum 
Shalama is one of their strongest collaborations, a throwback 80s funk jam 
mixing Big Boi’s Objectum Sexuality with Phantogram on the chorus and samples 
of Shalamar’s A Night to Remember. Clearly meant to be spun on dance floors for 
maximum booty-shaking everywhere, Objectum Shalamar is a flashy and sexy moment 
for both.

St Vincent <https://www.theguardian.com/music/st-vincent> (Annie Clark) and 
Byrne’s 2012 album, Love This Giant, was a winning moment of collaboration for 
the two. For Clark, it offered her a chance to break out of the complex yet 
isolating art rock of her previous album, Strange Mercy, and embrace more 
rhythm and funk (a change that was also felt with her next self-titled album). 
For Byrne, it was a chance to reconnect and collaborate on a scale previously 
unheard of (at least since the demise of Talking Heads) for the performer. 
Recorded for nearly three years, the results were sharp, slinky and downright 
fun.

Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel

Written by Gabriel, this duet of desperation and hope is also one of the most 
commercially successful tracks in Bush’s discography. That should come as no 
surprise to Bush’s dedicated and feverish fan base, who hold an intense 
appreciation for the musician’s witchy, literary and complex deep cuts which 
rarely get as much airplay as Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) and Hounds 
of Love. This quiet and contemplative collaboration, however, fits in nicely 
with both performers’ past work while still pushing the boundaries of their 
respective genres, mashing previously under-utilized instrumental and vocal 
flourishes like soulful R&B crooning and downtempo rhythms.

Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney

When two of the greatest artists of all time collaborate, only one of two 
results is possible: the most unfortunate and disappointing music imaginable 
(like Lou Reed and Metallica), or the most enjoyable and smartest earworms. 
Thankfully, Jackson and McCartney proved to be a winning match (at least until 
that whole “purchasing the entire Beatles catalogue” betrayal came to a head). 
Say Say Say from McCartney’s album Tug of War and The Girl is Mine from 
Jackson’s Thriller were potent early snapshots of how pop, rock and R&B would 
meld seamlessly during the next two decades and firmly dominate the airwaves.

Santana and Rob Thomas

There was a point in time in which you couldn’t escape Smooth. Top 40 radio, 
R&B, adult contemporary – nearly every radio station gave the Santana and Rob 
Thomas collaboration ample airtime. But that more than anything proves how 
strong of a cross-collaboration the two created. Smooth was a song for 
everyone, it seems, fitting in perfectly with Thomas’ mopey alt-rock in 
Matchbox Twenty, your parents’ traditional R&B and your pop-leaning 
sensibilities. And there’s no denying that chorus: one of the best and most 
melodic from the past 20 years.

Walk This Way will forever be known as the collaboration of all 
collaborations, and rightfully so. This genre-bending work (and its equally 
charming video) were a perfect response to the growing tension between rock 
music and the rising rap genre in the 1980s. It’s amazing to think that so many 
artists from different genres are hesitant to collaborate nearly 30 years 
later, but perhaps times are changing based on the recent works that prove the 
seemingly disparate connections between genres are quickly eroding.
