What to do

Benaki Museum, Pireos Street
It would be criminal to come to Athens and miss the Acropolis but visitors who 
stick only to the city’s ancient past are missing out. Part of the excellent 
Benaki art and design museum, which sprawls across seven sites, the Pireos 
Street gallery is a forbidding pink cube in the warehouse district of Gazi that 
hosts some of Athens’ best contemporary art exhibitions. It is particularly 
popular on weekend evenings, when it closes at 10pm.
• 138 Pireos Street, benaki.gr <http://www.benaki.gr/?id=40202&lang=en>. Open 
Thurs-Sun 10am-8pm, Fri-Sat 10am-10pm. Admission €6

Athens Central Market
While London and Paris have converted their historic markets into tourist 
traps and shopping malls, Athens’ glorious Central Market is just as it’s been 
for decades. The sheer variety of fish and meat on sale in its grand, 
slippery-floored arcades is a sight in itself, but it’s also a good place to 
buy whole spices, cheese and olive oil. Four fine no-frills restaurants dole 
out tripe soup, supposedly a hangover cure.
• Athinas Street, Mon-Sat 8am-6pm

Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghika Gallery
One of Greece’s most important 20th-century artists, Nikos Ghika was also a 
seriously minted scion of an aristocratic family (and a Rothschild by marriage) 
with exquisite taste in mid-century modern design. The artist’s grand art deco 
house at 3 Kriezotou Street, just off Syntagma Square, was reopened to the 
public two years ago, and contains the artist’s studio and apartment, plus a 
beautifully laid-out three-floor survey of mid-century Greek art and culture.
• benaki.gr <http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?id=40206&lang=en>, Wed-Sat 
10am-6pm. Admission €7

With more than 90 outdoor screens across the city during the hotter months 
(including September), open-air cinema is a key part of Athens’ cultural life. 
The best selection of films is arguably at historicVox cinema 
<http://www.athenscine.com/intro.php> in the Exarchia neighbourhood, which 
mainly screens arthouse films with subtitles. For the experience itself, 
however, it’s hard to beat the Thissio cinema, with its dramatic floodlit view 
of the Acropolis looming behind the screen.
• Apostolou Pavlou 7,cine-thisio.gr <http://cine-thisio.gr/>. Tickets from €6, 
late April-late October

Shopping
Athens is, as you’d expect, a great place to buy hard-to-find and often 
reasonably priced Greek designer goods. Try Plaka’s Forget Me Not (100 
Andrianou Street) to hunt down products from the cheekily namedSalty Bags 
<https://www.saltybag.com/>, a Corfu-based startup making beautiful bags out of 
old sails. Over in Exarchia,Paul Sarz <http://www.paulsarz.com/home.html> makes 
intriguingly spooky jewellery that looks part-Victorian, part-classical. For 
souvenirs that go beyond the usual tat, meanwhile, call +30 210 92 45 064 to 
book a visit to appointment-only design shopGreece is for Lovers 
<http://greeceisforlovers.com/>, which sells such tongue-in-cheek mementos as 
marble ice lollies and Zeus-style lightning bolt paper knives.

Philopappos Hill park
For the perfect view across to the Acropolis, Mount Lycabettus and out to the 
Saronic Gulf, visit the monument and park on Philopappos Hill. You probably 
won’t have to share it with anyone else.


Classical ruins
Athens boasts some of the most spectacular, imitated classical ruins in the 
world. From the Parthenon to the Hill of Pnyx, these crop up unannounced on 
street corners in Athens the way shops do in other cities.

The Acropolis
The Acropolis Museum <http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en> is almost flawless 
in content, architecture and layout: the only improvement could be replacing 
its mock-ups of the marbles frieze with the British Museum originals.

Alfresco drinking
Athens’ bar terraces are among its best features, especially at night. Go 
upscale on tree-lined Kolonaki Square, or try the punkier Plateia Exarchion in 
anarchist stronghold Exarchia, just down the road.

Where to eat

 Melilotos. 
Melilotos
Retooling traditional, local dishes at decent prices, Melilotos is at the 
forefront of an Athenian restaurant wave not unlike Britain’s gastropub boom. 
In a neo-rustic pistachio-coloured dining room, this restaurant near Syntagma 
Square serves excellent grills and unusual specialities such as one-year-old 
Cretan gruyère and aubergine salad with walnuts.
• 19 Kalamiotou, +30 210 32 22 458, melilotos.gr <http://www.melilotos.gr/>, 
€25pp

Kriti
The back of a humdrum shopping arcade may not sound like an obvious 
gastronomic hot spot, but Kriti has a reputation for serving the best Cretan 
food in Athens. Especially popular with local lawyers at lunchtime, this small 
taverna’s excellent menu includes such classic Cretan dishes as barley rusks 
topped with tomatoes andmizithra cheese and peppery sautéed wild greens.
• 5 Veranzerou, Kanigos Square, +30 210 38 26 998. Open Mon-Sat 11am-11.30pm, 
dinner from €20pp

Kosta
Late-night drinkers from Agias Irinis Square fill this classic souvlaki place, 
queuing for Kosta’s classic wrap of pork skewers or beef meatballs in pitta 
bread with salad, chips, tzatziki and hot tomato sauce. Quality is high and 
service is decent, given that you only need spend €5 to fill up here.
• 2 Agias Irinis Square. Open 6am until late, wraps from €2

Ama Laxei 
It’s hard to imagine Ama Laxei <https://www.facebook.com/amalaxeiresto>’s 
beautiful courtyard, now packed with bougainvillea and palms, in its former 
role as the playground of a school. The food is a similarly attractive revamp 
of Greek tradition, with highlights including pork sausage with orange juice 
and mussels with ouzo.
• 69 Kalliodromiou, +30 210 38 45 978, €25pp

 The roof terrace at Bios 
Bios roof terrace
Athens is one of those rare cities where sky bars don’t automatically mean a 
diet of white sofas and Cafe del Mar. Bios is a leftfield art space and music 
venue but its best asset is arguably its lovely, unkempt roof terrace, where 
you can watch the sun set behind the Parthenon while listening to anything from
Autechre <http://www.autechre.ws/l-event/> to the Smiths.
• 84 Pireos Street, bios.gr <http://www.bios.gr/>. Open daily 11am-4am

Some Bizzare
Athens’ current spot of the moment, this bar has an unlikely setting in the 
courtyard of a major bank. With no one to disturb outside office hours, Some 
Bizzare turns the courtyard into an open-air dancefloor until 5am at weekends. 
Expect a crowd of twenty- and thirtysomethings who (bar the tans) wouldn’t look 
out of place in London’s Dalston, and a shifting, largely electronic music 
policy.
• 7-9 Sofokleous Street, facebook.com/somebizzare.gr 
<https://www.facebook.com/somebizzare.gr>. Open Mon-Fri 8pm-4am (Sat 5am)

Bluebird
Tiny Bluebird is a gay-friendly bar-cum-bistro hidden up an alley near 
Syntagma Square. The decor is part Parisian cafe, part old-school tattoo 
parlour, though most of the very mixed crowd of drinkers stay out on the 
terrace, enjoying the (for Athens) unusually wide range of whiskies.
• 4 Ipitou Street. Open daily 5pm-2am 

Tailor Made
If you want something other than thick, syrupy Greek coffee, Tailor Made is 
perhaps the best place in Athens. Roasting its own single estate coffees, 
Tailor Made also looks great, with a high ceiling decorated with tailoring 
patterns and a huge sgraffito (scraped plaster) bust. It’s in one of central 
Athens’ busiest spots for bars and cafes, Tailor Made’s terrace is also ideal 
for people watching.
• 2 Agias Irinis Square, tailormade.gr <http://www.tailormade.gr/en/>. Open 
8am-2am (4am Fri-Sat)

Where to sleep
 Fresh Hotel 
Fresh Hotel
With sleek interiors, and a rooftop swimming pool and cocktail bar, Fresh 
Hotel looks more expensive than it is. The surrounding neighbourhood, near the 
Central Market, is lively if a little run-down.
• 26 Sofokleous Street, +30 210 52 48 511, freshhotel.gr 
<http://freshhotel.gr/>. Doubles from €76

A for Athens
Overlooking the square at Monastiraki, this boutique hotel could hardly be 
more central. Its rooftop bar can get rather crammed, but the intermediate 
floors with good-sized, sparely elegant bedrooms are calm enough. Book early 
and ask for a view of the Acropolis.
• 2-4 Miaouli Street, +30 210 32 44 244, aforathens.com 
<http://aforathens.com/index.php/pages/page/about>. Doubles from €80

City Circus
Housed in a neoclassical mansion, this excellent hostel-cum-hotel’s helpful 
staff and self-conscious decor seem a world away from the grotty budget options 
of old. The immediate area’s elegantly faded 19th-century streets are worth a 
look around, too.
• Sarri Street 16, +30 213 02 37 244, citycircus.gr <http://citycircus.gr/>. 
Dorm beds from €22, doubles from €60
