As Greece gears up for a bumper tourist season, with over 21 million visitors 
expected this year, Athens is surfacing from austerity. Its cultural and 
night-life scene is blossoming as locals start up creative cooperatives or 
become city guides.

Sleep

1 City Circus 
Two friends ditched corporate careers to set up this hip hostel in Psirri, a 
central neighbourhood of lively meze joints and gift shops. With mid-century 
antiques, frescoed ceilings, and graffiti art, it's way cooler and cheaper than 
the average boutique hotel. Nine rooms in an annex open this summer, along with 
a bar/restaurant that will screen films and serve cheap cocktails. The roof 
terrace has dazzling Parthenon views.

 Alice Inn guesthouse 
2 Alice Inn 
Decent lodgings are surprisingly scarce in Plaka, the touristy old town. This 
stylish "three-and-a-half-room" guesthouse is the exception. Greek-Irish 
architect John Consolas has converted a crummy hostel into a cosy, art-filled 
bolthole. Consolas, who lives on site, is a laid-back host who makes guests 
(everyone from top DJs to IMF inspectors) feel like old friends.

Eat and drink

3 Black Duck Garden 
Modern Athens' first public park was the gardens at the City of Athens Museum, 
with palm trees and fountains. One palm tree survives in the secret garden 
behind the museum, which now hosts a sweet, summer-only bistro. An oasis of 
shady calm, it's a relaxing spot for brunch or coffee.

 Neighbourhood cool … food and drink at Romantso 
4 Romantso 
The team behind Bios, the alternative arts space that turned the red-light 
Keramikos district into a hipster hotspot, have set their sights on another 
neighbourhood. Off seedy Omonia Square, Romantso is a coolly modern bar and 
cultural centre named after the magazine that was printed in this starkly 
beautiful industrial building for 60 years. The original neon sign flashes on 
after dark.

5 Greek Gastronomy Museum 
Dreamt up by four twentysomethings and run by volunteers, the first museum of 
Greek cuisine opens this summer, in a 150-year-old townhouse just behind the 
central food market. The admission price includes a half-hour cooking lesson. 
There's a lovely courtyard cafe and the restaurant does good-value tasting 
menus that showcase regional Greek dishes.

 Museum of Contemporary Art 
6 Museum of Contemporary Art
After 14 years of false starts, Athens' first modern art museum (EMST) 
launches this summer (date to be confirmed). It's in the old Fix brewery, a 
modernist landmark with a 92-metre facade of horizontal windows. The unveiling 
of the permanent collection is hotly anticipated. It includes works by more 
than 100 artists, from Jannis Kounellis to Bill Viola Diohanti (who represented 
Greece at the 2011 Venice Biennale). Eventually, a promenade will connect EMST 
to the Acropolis Museum nearby.

Shop

7 Forget Me Not 
Plaka's souvenir shops are a soul-sapping collection of Greek clichés. Smack 
on the main shopping drag, this shop breaks the mould. Everything is 
beautifully made in Greece. Owner Filippos is constantly on the lookout for 
innovative designers. Standouts areRainy July's waterproof pouches

Young designers Mirella Manta and Ioli Michalopoulou recently opened this chic 
boutique in Athens' most exclusive shopping street. They stock their own
