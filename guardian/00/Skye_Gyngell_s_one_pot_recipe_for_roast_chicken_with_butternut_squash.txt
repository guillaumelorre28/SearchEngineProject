It came about by accident, one day. It was a Sunday afternoon and I’d planned 
on doing a roast chicken and roasting some butternut squash too – a 
quintessentially Australian thing from my childhood. Everything was ready to 
put in the oven, but when I went to do so, it stopped working. So I browned the 
chicken with onions in a cast iron pot, then threw in the squash with some sage 
and tomatoes from the garden, and let it roast on the stove top. I finished it 
off with some creme fraiche. My kids couldn’t get over how good it was. “Oh my 
god, Mom, this is the best thing you’ve ever cooked,” they said. And they still 
really love it.

They’re both living in the US at the moment – Evie in New York and Holly in LA 
– and this is the dish they want whenever they’re home. I have dishes like this 
I always ask my Mom to cook when I go back to Australia – they’re so 
comforting; they make you feel warm inside. And I know my girls feel the same 
with this dish. I amso looking forward to Christmas, when they’ll both be home 
at the same time.

One thing I feel really proud of is seeing my daughters both so completely at 
ease in the kitchen. They take pleasure in food; they’re interested in it. A 
friend recently gave me a very old book from the 1920s or 1930s about dessert – 
no recipes, just paragraphs – from a time when women really did cook all the 
time. Nowadays, people often don’t seem to have confidence. Throughout my life, 
I’ve met so many women who have a really complicated relationship with the 
kitchen, who feel like they can’t cook. So, seeing my kids being so relaxed in 
the kitchen feels good.

The other day, Holly called me to talk about a dinner she was planning as a 
welcome-back present for her boyfriend. Their friends often come over and they 
all end up cooking together. They’re 18-19, and very health-conscious; they love
Deliciously Ella <http://deliciouslyella.com/>. And I think it’s so lovely that 
they’re interested. It’s like how Jamie Oliver got his generation cooking.

Most days I eat at the restaurant, but when I’m home alone, I just have toast 
and a boiled egg. But I do find that cooking at home for people gives me 
pleasure. A lot of my friends live really close and we often cook together. 
People often ask me: “How do I cook a restaurant meal at home?” I always think: 
“Why the hell would you want to?” Cooking simply with family and friends is so 
much more convivial.

Pot-roasted chicken with butternut squash and sage

Serves 6
1 lemon, halved
2 fresh bay leaves (dried is fine too)
A small bunch of fresh sage
1 whole chicken, cavity rinsed out with water, drained and excess fat around 
neck trimmed off.
2 tbsp olive oil
1 red onion, peeled and cut into chunks
5 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole
1.2kg butternut squash, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into large chunks
2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
2 tbsp creme fraiche

1 Put half the lemon, 1 bay leaf and half the bunch of sage inside the cavity 
of the chicken. Tie the legs together with kitchen string.

2 Heat a large, heavy-based pot or saucepan over a medium heat. Add the olive 
oil and heat till hot. Brown the chicken a little on each side, for about 10-15 
minutes or so in total. Remove from the pan and set aside.

3 Add the onion to the pan and cook till it’s slightly softened, stirring 
occasionally. Put the chicken back into the pan, and add the remaining 
ingredients, finishing with the chopped tomato.

4 Give it all a big stir, making sure that the vegetables are nestled around 
the chicken. The meat doesn’t need to be covered by the liquid. Once the lid is 
on, the chicken will steam and become nice and tender.

5 Cover with a lid and reduce the heat to medium-low, so it simmers away 
gently for about 45 minutes. Check the chicken is cooked by inserting a skewer 
into the thigh: the juices will run clear if it’s cooked.

6 When cooked, remove the chicken and pull apart, distributing it between the 
individual serving bowls. Stir the creme fraiche into the pan, then dish up 
vegetables and sauce over the chicken in the bowls. Serve with steamed greens.
