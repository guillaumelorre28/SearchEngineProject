The family of Meredith Kercher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/meredithkercher> has said that the Italian 
justice system has failed after the country’s top court annulled the conviction 
of Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, for murdering the 
British student.

In a statement outside the courtroom, the family’s lawyer, Francesco Maresca, 
said: “This is not so much a defeat for the prosecution as a defeat for Italy’s 
justice system. The judges said there is a lack of proof and whoever acted with 
[Rudi] Guede [the only person found guilty of the murder] has not been found.”

The decision by a five-judge panel on Friday night to clear the pair 
definitively ends the long-running case, following the 2007 murder. Kercher’s 
throat was slashed and she had been sexually assaulted while she was on an 
Erasmus year in the medieval hill town of Perugia.

Guede, from Ivory Coast, is almost halfway through a 16-year prison sentence 
after his trial was fast-tracked in 2008.

The Kercher family’s comments come a year after they expressed confidence in 
the Italian justice system. Late on Friday night, Kercher’s mother, Arline, 
said she was “surprised and very shocked” by the annulment.

It had been widely expected that the court would at least order a retrial, 
even if it overturned the previous convictions, but instead judges moved to 
definitively clear both Knox and Sollecito.

Speaking at her mother’s home in Seattle after the pair were cleared, Knox 
said she was “full of joy”.


“I’m grateful to have my life back,” she told reporters, standing alongside 
her family. “I’m still absorbing the present moment, which is full of joy.”

“Meredith was my friend,” she said. “She deserved so much in this life.”

Bill Knox, her grandfather, told reporters he was “relieved and ecstatic” that 
she could finally move on with her life in Seattle, where she has worked as a 
newspaper journalist.

“It’s been a long time coming. I just want for her to be happy,” he said. “She 
is an exciting granddaughter.”


Knox has tried to lead a normal life since she was freed from an Italian 
prison more than three years ago. She recently got engaged and has started 
writing theatre reviews and for a weekly newspaper.

Her Italian defence lawyer said she had been “crying with happiness”, over the 
court’s decision. He said: “We shouldn’t have had to wait all these years, but 
we have a good decision today, so we are happy.”

Tom Wright, who has known Knox since high school and wrote a book about the 
case, told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast: “Quite frankly there were tears 
everywhere, everyone in the room. This has been eight years, she served four 
years that she didn’t deserve.”

Asked about his thoughts of Kercher and her family, he said: “We are very 
hopeful that this helps brings some closure for them as well. There were 
prayers said for Meredith after the decision was announced.”

 Exclusive 2014 video interview with Amanda Knox 
In West Seattle, where Knox grew up, the news of her acquittal was accompanied 
by the sound of fireworks echoing across the water.


“I’m just ecstatic,” said Karen Pruett, a long-time friend of the Knox family. 
“The Italian courts did the right thing. It was very difficult for them, and we 
understand that, but we’re beyond pleased that they chose justice and truth.”

As the sound of cheers and celebrations filtered out to the terrace from the 
restaurant inside, Pruett said she thought the Knox family were feeling 
“jubilant and relieved and buoyant”, but also probably exhausted. “It was a 
long and excruciating and twisted journey,” she said.

Through her lawyer, Knox gave the Guardian a statement upon learning the news 
of her acquittal, saying she was “tremendously relieved and grateful”.

“The knowledge of my innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of 
this ordeal. And throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support 
from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say, thank you from the bottom 
of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me. I only wish that I could thank 
each and every one of you in person.”

Her family expressed “profound gratitude” to those who supported Knox, and 
said they were “thrilled with and grateful” for the Italian supreme court’s 
decision.

Pruett said she hoped the pursuit of justice for Meredith Kercher’s family 
would continue. “In my opinion the case file needs to be reopened and examined 
carefully, so that the proper information is given to the Kerchers and they get 
their questions answered,” she told the Guardian.

“Thank God it’s over. They can get on with their lives,” said Candace Dempsey, 
the author of Murder inItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, a book 
about the case, who was also celebrating at the restaurant.

“I’m very pleased and very surprised. Usually I’m an optimist, but I was sure 
this was going against them. I think it’s a brilliant move byItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>. They’ve averted a diplomatic crisis 
that no one needed. I couldn’t be happier that two innocent people are going 
free.

“I never thought when I wrote my book that this would happen. I’m so happy.”

Dempsey is also hopeful that the online abuse she said she has suffered from 
those who insisted Knox was guilty will come to an end. “I just hope the 
‘guilters’ can go home now, and this tragic saga will be over at last,” she 
said. “It’s made me an admirer of Italian justice.”
