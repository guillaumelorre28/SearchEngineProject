If you were to jump right now, you'd move away from the Earth and the Earth 
would move away from you: because every force exerts an equal and opposite 
force, your action leads to a reaction from the Earth.

There are 7 billion people on our planet – that's a 7 with nine zeros after 
it. Our Earth has a mass 600,000 billion times greater than all those people 
combined. If everyone in the world jumped at the same time, we'd all make the 
Earth move in different directions and all these effects would cancel out, so 
there would be no overall change in the Earth's motion.

If we all squeezed together into one giant person with a mass of 350 million 
tonnes and jumped up half a metre from one spot, the Earth would move by only 
100 millionth of the width of a strand of hair. This is equivalent to a 
ladybird jumping on something as heavy as twoGreat Pyramids of Giza
