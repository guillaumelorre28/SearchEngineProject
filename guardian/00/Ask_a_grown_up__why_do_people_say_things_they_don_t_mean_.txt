People might wish they'd never said something, and say they didn't mean it, 
but for the moment they said it, they did mean it.

A human being is a mixture of different moods and selfs and characteristics. 
Some we find acceptable – the nice, kind parts – and others we sometimes 
disown, which tend to be selfish and greedy. As we get older, we push down the 
selfish parts so we appear nicer to other people. Unfortunately, if we don't 
listen to our feelings and work out what's making us feel bad, the part we 
don't like can burst out and make us say things we later regret.

For example, your mother might want to make a sunny day perfect for everyone, 
but she's not admitting even to herself that she has needs, too, and wears 
herself out making a fabulous picnic. So when someone doesn't like her 
cupcakes, she snaps and says something horrible – but the next moment she's 
nice again and says she didn't mean it.
