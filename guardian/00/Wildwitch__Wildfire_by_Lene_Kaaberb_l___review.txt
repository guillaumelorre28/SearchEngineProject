Wildwitch: Wildfire by author Lene Kaaberbøl is a stunning and wonderful short 
novel for kids!

A girl called Clara is an ordinary girl but she is not ordinary in her aunty’s 
eyes. When Clara is attacked by a cat she doesn’t think it will be the start of 
her new life. The next day Clara starts to feel sick but instead of taking her 
to the doctor, her mum takes her to her aunty’s house. It is far out in a 
untouched place. They stay over night and she is told that she is very special. 
Clara thinks they’re all mad.


Clara goes back home and, while riding with her friend, strange things happen. 
The next day her mother drops her off at her aunty’s and says she must stay for 
a while. She is too scared to object. Will she be able to survive when her life 
could change rapidly? She now knows she is a wildwitch and a good thing too 
because an evil force is lurking right round the corner. And what about that 
pesky cat? Will he be a part of this amazing story too?

I really love this addictive book because of its simplicity. I can’t believe 
so much happened and I loved how the story flowed. The way it was told and the 
characters just made the book that much better. I love Clara because she is 
amazingly brave even though she must save the wildwitches. This was a very easy 
read and within about a week I had read 10 chapters! The whole book puts on an 
amazing show and is never dull. I would definitely recommend this book to 
anyone with the hope that you will enjoy it as much as I have.
