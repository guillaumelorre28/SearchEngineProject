The steamroller
Another week, another £7.5m in the bank as Harry Potter and the Half-Blood 
Prince 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/127057/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince>
 continues to dominate the box-office chart. With UK schools on holiday, the 
film took more each day Monday-Thursday than it did on Saturday and Sunday – 
this is one of the keys to its phenomenal success.

With £40.54m after three weekends, Half-Blood Prince is ahead of its immediate 
Potter predecessors at the same stage –Order of the Phoenix 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119377/harry.potter.and.the.order.of.the.phoenix>
 stood at £37.87m andGoblet of Fire 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/109039/harry.potter.and.the.goblet.of.fire>
 at £37.01m – but differences in previews strategy across the three pictures 
give an advantage to the latest film. True comparisons will emerge by the end 
of its run. Half-Blood Prince is now more than £10m ahead of the nearest 
competitor (Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130671/ice-age>) in this summer's 
blockbuster contest, and that margin will only increase.

The upstart
New kid on the block G-Force 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130994/g-force> earned a creditable 
£2.48m over the weekend, taking a decent bite of the currently buoyant family 
market. A hefty 73% of that haul came from the 222 screens showing the film in 
3D, with the rest coming from 273 venues projecting in 2D. The film, which 
mixes CGI guinea-pig spies and live action, opened stronger than comparative 
title Alvin and the Chipmunks did in December 2007 – but then that picture's 
debut of £1.43m was achieved in the pre-3D world.

The arrival of G-Force has proved particularly detrimental to Ice Age 3, which 
lost showtimes, or was elbowed out altogether, from 3D screens. Takings for the 
Ice Age movie fell a hefty 72% from 3D screens, but only 9% in 2D – families 
that could no longer find the film playing in 3D are evidently now making do 
with the 2D version. Distributors will be pushing cinemas to expand the 
capacity of 3D screens so that two big films can co-exist in the market 
successfully, a happy state that is currently not possible.

The also-ran
With a 26% Fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes and lacklustre box office in the US,
Land of the Lost <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/129891/land-of-the-lost> 
predictably stumbled out of the gate here. The Will Ferrell comedy landed at No 
6 with takings of £643,000: the comic actor's lowest opening since high-concept 
drama Stranger Than Fiction in December 2006. More recently, Step Brothers 
began its life with £1.68m, Semi-Pro with £775,000 and Blades of Glory with 
£1.02m. With Land of the Lost, backers Universal faced the additional challenge 
that the original American TV series is not well known here.

The arthouse sensation
In recent years, six French films have exceeded £1m at the UK box office, 
beginning withA Very Long Engagement 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/104538/very.long.engagement> in January 
2005, and continuing withCaché (Hidden) 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/108597/hidden>, Tell No One 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/117310/tell.no.one>, La Vie En Rose 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/117957/la.vie.en.rose>, The Diving Bell 
and the Butterfly 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122766/diving.bell.and.the.butterfly> and 
I've Loved You So Long 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/124741/i.ve.loved.you.so.long>. The first 
of those titles opened with £312,000, and La Vie En Rose began on £206,000, but 
all the rest debuted in the £100-200,000 range, which makes Coco Before 
Chanel's opening this weekend of £423,000 all the more impressive. This is the 
best debut of any foreign-language film sinceChe: Part One 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/124316/che> opened in January on 
£430,000, although that figure included a sizeable £118,000 in previews. Coco 
Before Chanel is also ahead of the debuts of The Orphanage, Curse of the Golden 
Flower (which benefited from a wide 223-print release) and Pan's Labyrinth. 
It's a very strong start for Anne Fontaine's Audrey Tautou starrer.

The Bollywood hit
The highest screen average of any film in the chart is enjoyed by Love Aaj 
Kal, which debuted with £406,000 from just 52 screens. It's the best start of 
any Bollywood release this year, beating previous winner Kambakkht Ishq, and 
the biggest debut for an Indian film since Singh Is Kinng began its life last 
August with £493,000. Love Aaj Kal stars Saif Ali Khan (who recently enjoyed a 
hit with Race) and Deepika Padukone (Chandni Chowk to China).

The future
Admissions for the first six months of 2009 are an impressive 14% up on the 
same period from last year, and takings are up an even more remarkable 22%, 
buoyed by premium prices for 3D tickets. Since then, July has failed to match 
the 2008 pace, with takings down on four of the month's five weekends when 
compared with the 2008 equivalents. Next weekend will almost certainly continue 
this downward trend since new entrants GI Joe: Rise of Cobra and The Ugly Truth 
will struggle to match the top titles from the corresponding weekend in August 
2008, when the third Mummy movie and The Dark Knight delivered £4m apiece.
