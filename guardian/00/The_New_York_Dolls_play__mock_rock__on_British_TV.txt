The Dolls' appearance on the Old Grey Whistle Test kickstarted the war between 
punks and hippies three years early. Before filming, Dolls frontman David 
Johansen told presenter Bob Harris he had "bunny teeth"; following the Dolls' 
vigorous mime through Jet Boy, Harris sniggered into camera and pronounced the 
band "mock rock". Among the few viewers outraged by Harris's dismissal was a 
young Mancunian, one StevenMorrissey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/morrissey>, on whom the Dolls would have a 
profound effect (when the three surviving members reunited in 2004 it was at 
Morrissey's behest; he had been president of their fan club). Today, Harris's 
comment seems more affectionate than disrespectful, but his card had been 
marked. In March 1977, at the height of punk, Harris was assaulted by a 
refreshed Sid Vicious; a year later, Harris exited the Test, replaced by the 
altogether more punk-friendly Annie Nightingale.
