Ever wondered how it would feel to crash through the verdant jungle on a 
six-legged steed or pray at the altar of a kindly tree-god? Then you're in 
luck: a new theme park attraction based on the blockbuster megalith Avatar 
looks set to deliver just such thrills. Disney has released the first images of 
Avatar Land, which is due to open in 2017 at the mouse house's Animal Kingdom 
park in Orlando,Florida <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida>.

show a family walking along a path through a multi-coloured jungle, floating 
through fluorescent foliage in a boat and even partying with Na'vi revellers. 
"As these concept renderings show in epic scale, in the world of Avatar, guests 
will encounter awe-inspiring floating mountains and wander through a night-time 
jungle of bioluminescent plants that are alive with light and sound," said 
Disney's Tom Staggs in a post. "Guests will also discover what it feels like to 
soar into the sky riding a Banshee."

Avatar-land is already two years behind schedule, the attraction having been 
due to open in 2015 when it was first announced two years ago. "This is a big 
endeavour, and we currently expect them to open in early 2017," said Staggs in 
response to the delay.

Director James Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamescameron> is 
planning three new films set in the same solar system as the forest moon of 
Pandora, where the action took place in Avatar. The 2009 film is the 
highest-grossing of all time, with a $2.7bn worldwide take.
