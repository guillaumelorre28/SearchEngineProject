The former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asafapowell> has made the startling 
confession that he was unaware of the World Anti-Doping Agency rules on the 
opening day of the hearing into his failed drug test.

Powell, who tested positive

 for the banned stimulant oxilofrine at the Jamaica national championships last 
June, also admitted he did not list all the supplements he was taking – as 
required – because they were new and he could not remember their names.

Under cross-examination, the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission lawyer Lackston 
Robinson asked him: "Are you acquainted with the Doping Control rule?" "I am 
now," said Powell. Powell testified that his former trainer Chris Xuereb gave 
him nine supplements, which he then checked out on Google to see whether they 
contained any banned substances. Powell said that he took the supplement 
Epiphany D1, which he blames for his failed test, at approximately 6.30am on 
the day of the national championships.

Xuereb has denied claims that he gave Powell a banned supplement. He said 
Powell was taking a supplement that he did not tell him about.

Powell also told the court that after police raided his hotel in Italy he 
posed for photographs and signed autographs and was allowed to drive a squad 
car. The case continues on Wednesday.
