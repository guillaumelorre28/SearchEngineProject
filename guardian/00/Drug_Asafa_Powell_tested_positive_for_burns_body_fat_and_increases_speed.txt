The banned drug oxilofrine that top Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asafapowell> and Sherone Simpson have tested 
positive for is a stimulant used to boost the body's ability to burn fat. The 
substance helps athletes boost their power-to-weight ratio with more lean 
muscle and less fat, and so increase their speed.

Powell said he had "never knowingly or wilfully taken any supplements or 
substances that break any rules", 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/14/tyson-gay-tests-positive-banned-substance>
 and Simpson also insisted she had not taken the drug intentionally.

The stimulant in question may also increase the rate at which the heart 
reaches its maximum performance during exercise, meaning a greater supply of 
oxygen can get to the muscles earlier.

Oxilofrine is an agent that stimulates part of the nervous system and was 
previously used to treat low blood pressure. More recently, it has started to 
appear in combination with caffeine in dietary supplements marketed as weight 
loss products.

However, the superiority of using oxilofrine over an exercise warm-up to 
achieve this appears unconvincing.

There have been no previous findings in Britain but competitors in cycling, 
athletics, weightlifting, rugby union and American football have been banned in 
the last three years.

They include the USA's Amy Dodson, one of the world's top amputee runners, who 
received a six-month ban in 2011 and American cyclist Flavia Oliveira who was 
banned for 18 months in 2009. Both said they had unknowingly ingested the 
stimulant via an over-the-counter supplement.
