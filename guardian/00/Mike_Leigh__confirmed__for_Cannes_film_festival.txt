One film is a dead cert for this year's Cannes film festival: Ridley Scott's 
Robin Hood, which hasalready been announced as the opening night gala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/26/robin-hood-russell-crowe>, 
screening out of competition. Now, ahead of tomorrow's Paris press conference 
in which festival director Thierry Fremaux will firm up the rest of the 
festival's line-up, film sites are abuzz with speculation as to the other key 
titles.

Today, Variety confidently reports 
<http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017723.html?categoryid=1061&cs=1> that 
Mike Leigh's Another Year, which stars Jim Broadbent and Imelda Staunton, has 
been confirmed, as has Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Biutiful, a 
Spanish-language drama starring Javier Bardem.

Other hotly-tipped titles include Fair Game, Doug Liman's spy thriller starring
Sean Penn <https://www.theguardian.com/film/seanpenn> and Naomi Watts, which 
Variety reports screened earlier this week for Fremaux and his selection 
committee, and Woody Allen's London-set You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger. 
Other British interest may be piqued by the inclusion of Stephen Frears's 
Tamara Drewe, an adaptation of the Posy Simmonds graphic novel first serialised 
in the Guardian.

Oliver Stone's Wall Street sequel, Money Never Sleeps, has been much rumoured 
to close this year's festival, which runs from May 13-23, but this remains 
unconfirmed, as does the gossip that Terrence Malick's Tree of Life - possibly 
the most eagerly-awaited of the titles -will be completed in time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/29/terrence-malick-tree-of-life-cannes>
 to screen in competition.

This year's festival runs from May 13-23. The emcee will be Kristin Scott 
Thomas, and the head of the juryTim Burton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/timburton>.

They could be contenders: the key titles vying for a spot at this year's 
Cannes film festival
