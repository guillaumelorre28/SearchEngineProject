The pair have faced justice together since the beginning, when they were 
questioned by police in Perugia and charged in 2007 with the murder of Kercher, 
a British university student.

But Sollecito’s attorney and family are now trying to exploit differences in 
their cases in an effort to convince the high court judges to give the 
30-year-old Italian another trial that is separate from Knox’s.

If both convictions are upheld it would lead to the immediate arrest of 
Sollecito, who arrived in court on Wednesday morning with his girlfriend, 
Greta, and his father, surrounded by dozens of camera crews and journalists.

Italy would then probably seek the extradition of Knox, an American citizen 
who is living in Seattle, back toItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>
 to serve a 28-and-a-half-year jail sentence.

Sollecito faces a 25-year sentence. “Raffaele cannot and should not be found 
guilty of a murder he did not commit by the mere fact of having had a brief 
romance withAmanda Knox <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amanda-knox>,” 
Sollecito’s aunt, Sara Achille, told the Guardian in an email.

She added: “One cannot help but take note of and reflect the differences – in 
the past and now – between Raffaele and Amanda, in their manner of being, the 
way they act, and they way they appear.”

At the court on Wednesday, a lawyer for Knox, Carlo dalla Vedova, said that 
the decision to try to separate the cases would not have an impact on his 
client.

“Sollecito is a shadow,” he said, adding that it made legal sense to separate 
the cases because there was less evidence claimed against him.

Dalla Vedova said he had last spoken with Knox last night. “She is worried,” 
he told reporters before the hearing began.

The Sollecito legal strategy is complicated and is largely centred on a 
contentious statement Knox gave police soon after Kercher’s body was discovered.


At the time, she admitted being in the house on the night Kercher was killed 
and hearing her screams. Knox later retracted the statement, saying it was 
coerced, and has maintained that she is innocent, as has Sollecito.

But in court on Wednesday, Sollecito’s attorney is expected to argue that, if 
Knox’s confession is believed to be true by the court, then the court must also 
believe that the confession exonerates Sollecito, because Knox never claimed he 
was there with her.

The verdict had been expected at some point on Wednesday – after Knox and 
Sollecito’s defence attorneys and prosecutors made their arguments in the case 
– but a court official said that no decision would be made until Friday.

 The high court can either uphold their earlier convictions for murder or send 
one or both cases back for retrial.

Knox and Sollecito were originally found guilty of murder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/05/amanda-knox-meredith-kercher-murder>
, along with Rudy Guede, who is serving a 16-year-sentence for stabbing Kercher.

An appeals court then threw out Knox and Sollecito’s conviction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/amanda-knox-raffaele-sollecito-cleared-murder>
, and Knox was able to return to the US after serving four years in prison. But 
the case was tried again under the rules of Italy’s multi-tiered justice system 
and in 2014the pair were found guilty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/30/amanda-knox-raffaele-sollecito-lose-meredith-kercher-murder-appeal>
.

That decision will only be final if the high court affirms it this week.

 Raffaele Sollecito arrives at Italy’s top court in Rome on Wednesday 
Sollecito’s aunt paints a picture of a young man who always sought to do the 
right thing – including being the first to try to enter Kercher’s room after 
becoming concerned that she might be hurt – and that he was caught up in the 
case through his association with Knox.

“From the first day Raffaele was the victim of what in mathematics is called 
‘transitive property’,” she said.

But prosecutors have also relied on some physical evidence in the case against 
Sollecito: his DNA was found on the clasp of Kercher’s bra in the room where 
she was killed.

Sollecito’s defence team has argued that the evidence was flawed and 
unreliable.

“In many ways, separating the two cases would placate everyone. Sollecito 
would be tried again and it would take pressure off the extradition process if 
he’s not in jail right away,” says Barbie Latza Nadeau, the journalist and 
author of Angel Face, about the Knox case.

Experts say any attempt to extradite Knox could drag on for years amid various 
Italian and US legal hurdles.

In Seattle, Sollecito is seen as a hero of sorts among Knox’s many supporters.

Mark Waterbury, the author of The Monster of Perugia: The Framing of Amanda 
Knox, said that for him the biggest issue at stake this week is the fate of the 
young Italian.

“[Sollecito is a] tremendously good man, totally innocent, at the wrong place 
at the wrong time,” he said. “And there’s a real fear that they’re going to try 
to lock him up again. That would be an absolute tragedy.”

The British embassy in Rome said its thoughts were with the Kercher family, 
whom they have offered to assist.

A spokeswoman added that the UK would expect any possible extradition request 
to be considered “in accordance with US and international laws”.
