By the time the Beasties arrived for UK dates with Run-DMC, only one gig 
hadn't sold out. The last few tickets evidently went to people who took 
exception to (untrue) tabloid stories. The Daily Mirror's "exclusive", which 
appropriated a Tory MP to reinforce the moral outrage, claimed that the trio 
had mocked disabled children in Montreux. After 10 minutes of booing and being 
pelted with beer cans, Ad-Rock picked up a baseball bat and started swatting 
the missiles back into the crowd. A female fan was hit by a can; Ad-Rock was 
charged with assault, but later found not guilty.
