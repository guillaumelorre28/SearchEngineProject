Ben Affleck <https://www.theguardian.com/film/benaffleck> – Gigli and all – 
has come into his own as an acting, writing, directing and producing 
jack-of-all-trades. He’s starring in David Fincher’s Gone Girl, out in UK 
cinemas this week, so we’ve looked back at his on-screen career and picked five 
of his top performances to date. But which roles have we missed? Tell all in 
the comments section.

Dazed and Confused

Affleck exhibited an almost feral energy in Richard Linklater’s quintessential 
high-school film, as notorious bully and jock Fred O’Bannion. Though in a 
peripheral role, on the edge of protagonist Mitch Kramer’s storyline, Affleck 
doled out vicious spankings to high-school freshmen (those in their first year 
of secondary school) with a paddle that rarely seemed beyond reach.

Argo

Flexing his multitasking muscle, Affleck picked up several awards and 
nominations for acting in, directing and producing this political thriller. The 
film whipped up controversy for its“ahistorical” take

 on the tale of six American hostages taken in Iran in 1979, and later smuggled 
out in an elaborate film-based ruse, but Affleck shone in his supporting role 
as CIA officer Tony Mendez.

Dogma

What would this list be without at least one Kevin Smith film? As fallen angel 
Bartleby, Affleck teamed up with longtime friend Matt Damon (cast as Loki) in 
this provocative, twisted and humorous look at Catholic dogma. And now, let 
mayhem begin in the comments, on how we’ve missed Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob 
Strike Back, Chasing Amy …

Hollywoodland

Before being somewhat controversially cast as Zach Snyder’s Batman last year, 
Affleck was Superman. Well, sort of. He played George Reeves, the Superman 
actor killed in an unsolved shooting case in the 1950s, and donned the iconic 
red pants and cape in the semi-biographical drama, earning a Golden Globe 
nomination for his hard work.

Good Will Hunting

 Affleck wrote this film’s screenplay with longtime friend and collaborator 
Matt Damon and pulled off a great on-screen performance, too. His cheerful 
Chuckie Sullivan character served as a foil to Damon’s Will Hunting, providing 
some of the film’s most memorable scenes.
