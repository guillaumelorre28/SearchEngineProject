Patricia Tombs, a retired nurse, first attempted to conquer her fear of 
computers 15 years ago, by going on an IT course. "I really tried â€“ but I got 
confused and muddled up." Recently diagnosed as dyslexic, she has also been 
"terrified of maths" for much of her life.

But in 2009 she had the chance to do a two-year advanced apprenticeship to 
become a gym instructor, and realised she would have to face her twin demons. 
She signed up at her local adult community learning centre to get some help 
with the English and maths tests required for the apprenticeship, and her maths 
tutor, Maria Martin, eventually persuaded her to do the tests online, in order 
to get the results more quickly.

"I was very afraid when they said about doing it online," says Patricia, "but 
I did a beginner's computer course, and after a colleague showed me how to get 
on to the Move On website, I did a lot of practice tests online."

As Patricia gained in confidence, Martin says she became an invaluable source 
of support to other students using the computers. "She's just inspirational to 
the rest of the class. From her work in the gym, she's used to getting people 
motivated, and she encourages everybody in everything she does."

Patricia qualifies as an advanced gym instructor this summer, and this Adult 
Learners' Week she will receives a regional senior adult learner award. As she 
wanted to send in her nomination by email, she set up an email account with 
help from the learning centre and from a Salvation Army club. So this is 
another part of technology Patricia has now mastered.

Martin hopes that Patricia will have her own computer at home before long. In 
the meantime, Patricia is embarking on further training to be a qualified 
personal gym instructor.
