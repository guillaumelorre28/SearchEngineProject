Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> has taken a 
dozen highly vulnerable refugees who faced deportation from the Greek island of 
Lesbos back to Rome, offering them refuge in a rebuke to the EU’s policy of 
sending migrants and refugees back to Turkey.

The leader of the Roman Catholic church made the unprecedented intervention on 
Saturday during a trip to the island to highlight the refugee crisis unfolding 
across the continent.

The pontiff spent five hours on Lesbos with Bartholomew I, the spiritual 
leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, and Ieronymos II, the archbishop of 
Athens and Greece, meeting refugees and holding a service to bless those who 
have died trying to reachEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

Fuelling belief that the Catholic church is at odds with the EU’s stance on 
the crisis, Pope Francis took 12 refugees back to the Vatican. An official 
confirmed all those taken from the camp were Syrian Muslims, six of them minors 
who arrived Lesbos beforethe deportation deal

A spokesman for the Holy See said: “The pope has desired to make a gesture of 
welcome regarding refugees, accompanying on his plane to Rome three families of 
refugees from Syria, 12 people in all, including six children.

“Two families come from Damascus, and one from Deir Azzor (in the area 
occupied by Isis). Their homes had been bombed. The Vatican will take 
responsibility for bringing in and maintaining the three families. The initial 
hospitality will be taken care of by the Community of Sant’Egidio.”

The pontiff spent the morning meeting hundreds of migrants and refugees in a 
notorious detention centre on the island. Men and women held in the camp wept 
as he toured the site.

The pope was met at Mytilene’s airport by the Greek prime minister, Alexis 
Tsipras <https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras>, at the start of his 
biggest effort yet to highlight the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Europe. 
Lesbos has borne the brunt of the refugee influx with more than 850,000 of the 
1.1 million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis who streamed into Europe last year 
coming through the island. “Greece has been an example of humanity,” he said.

The visit is also seen as a further warming of ties between the western and 
eastern branches of Christianity, almost a millennium after their bittersplit 
in 1054 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/05/pope-francis-to-meet-russian-orthodox-leader-in-cuba>
. In a break with protocol, the pope chose to be driven to the detention camp, 
in the hills above Mytilene outside the village of Moria, with Bartholomew.

Addressing refugees, he said: “I am here to tell you, you are not alone … The 
Greek people have generously responded to your needs despite their own 
difficulties. Yes, so much more needs to be done but let us thank God that in 
our suffering he never leaves us alone.

“We hope that the world will heed these scenes of tragic and indeed desperate 
need, and respond in a way worthy of our common humanity.”

After having lunch with eight refugees in Moria, the three church leaders held 
a memorial for the victims of migration at Mytilene’s port – earlier this month 
the site of the first deportations underthe EU-Turkey deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa>. 

Addressing a large crowd, the pontiff issued an appeal for “responsibility and 
solidarity” towards refugees from the picturesque harbour. He said refugees 
were forced to live in “a climate of angst and fear and uncertainty over their 
future”, adding: “Before they are numbers, refugees are first and foremost 
human beings.”

Greece’s leftist-led government described Saturday’s visit of religious 
leaders as extremely significant. Tsipras was expected to underline Greece’s 
increasingly fragile situation in talks with the pope.

The country has been struggling to house refugees in makeshift facilities even 
though the number of arrivals has dropped dramatically since the deportation 
deal came into effect on 20 March.


For detainees who have arrived since then, conditions have deteriorated 
dramatically. Human rights organisations have withdrawn from Moria and other 
detention centres for fear of being associated with an operation of mass 
expulsions.

On Friday, just hours before Francis’ scheduled visit, detainees in the Lesbos 
camp chanted “freedom, freedom” as demonstrators denounced their incarceration.

Standing under the razor wire-topped fence, Sham Jutt, a young Pakistani, 
spoke of the refugees’ plight, saying he hoped the pope could intervene. “We 
expected a life of hope and now he is our only hope,” said the 21-year-old, 
adding that he had seen the camp change from being a registration centre to a 
prison following the controversial pact the EU signed with Turkey.

“Now, with this agreement, we are very afraid they will deport us,” he said.

Before the church leaders’ visit, authorities had gone out of their way to 
clean up the camp, whitewashing graffiti-splattered walls, replacing tents with 
containers, installing air conditioning and taking families out of the 
overcrowded facility to an open-air holding centre nearby.

“In every sense of the word, they have given it a whitewash,” said Jakob 
Mamzzak, a volunteer from California. “Today we even heard they had given 
[detainees] clean clothes, let them have their first shower in 25 days and 
brought them good food when the truth is conditions are inhumane.”

Lesbos’s refugee solidarity movement was hoping the pope could bring 
international attention to the problem. “Since this crisis began we have acted 
in solidarity with refugees,” said Nikos Zartamopoulos who, with others in the 
communist-aligned Pame trade union, had demonstrated outside the camp. “We are 
not against the pope per se. If he can speak out, if he can highlight their 
plight so much the better.”

The trip came as the head of the Catholic church in England and Wales said the 
UK’s refugee resettlement programme set up by David Cameron was a “great 
disappointment”.


Cardinal Vincent Nichols 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/15/archbishop-signals-support-for-britain-staying-in-eu>
 saidBritain’s response to the crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jan/22/take-more-syrians-help-reunite-refugee-families-human-rights-body-urges-uk>
 was “going very slowly” and called for a major increase in the number of 
people being taken in. Asked if he believed governments needed to show more 
humanity, the archbishop of Westminster replied: “I do.”

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we have the resources as a 
very rich country. Think of a country like the Lebanon and some of the other 
Middle Eastern countries where they have a proportion of refugees present which 
represents 30-40% of the population and they cope.

“We are a very rich country and I think with a greater cohesiveness between a 
spirit of willingness that is there among many and mechanisms which governments 
can put into place, we could be doing more.

“There are aspects of the government policy that are commendable but I’ve said 
surely that can be speeded up. Surely in the first year we can see really how 
many could be taken and then multiply that by five. At the moment it’s going 
very slowly and it’s a great disappointment.”

David Cameron announced plans to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in Britain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/07/refugee-crisis-pushes-un-agencies-towards-bankcruptcy-live-updates>
 at the height of the crisis. The scheme will cost more than £500m, the 
government said earlier this week.

Nichols dismissed suggestions that the UK should not be taking in refugees 
because some Britons are struggling to make ends meet.

“I don’t think the struggle of people in the destroyed villages in and around 
Mosul and other parts of Syria, those struggles are not the same as our 
struggles,” he said.

“They are people like ourselves and they are desperate and we should open our 
hearts as well as our political and financial resources.”
