since biopic Mo, about the late Labour MP and secretary of state for Northern 
Ireland, Mo Mowlam, which was watched by 3.5 million people in January 2010.

The superhero show had a 26.7% share of the 16- to 34-year-old audience

rollercoaster ride of the first episode of Marvel's gripping series."

series launched with 3.1 million viewers, a 14.2% share of the audience between
