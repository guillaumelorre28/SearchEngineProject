mind,'' said federal district judge Jose Gonzalez in ruling that the 2 Live 
Crew's filthy album As Nasty As They Wanna Be was, in fact, obscene. That made 
it illegal in certain counties of the group's home state of Florida and so, 
when they subsequently performed some tracks at a local sex club, three members 
were arrested. An obscenity trial and media circus followed. Celebrated 
academic Henry Louis Gates Jr even addressed the court on behalf of the 
defendants, all of whom were eventually acquitted.
