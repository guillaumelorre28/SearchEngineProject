Anonymous <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous> splinter group 
GhostSec has taken its “war” on Isis to the darknet, replacing a propaganda 
forum with an advert for Prozac.


The site was only recently set up within the Tor darknet by Isis, allegedly in 
response to Anonymous taking down hundreds of the terrorist group’s websites on 
the open web.

Along with an advert for an online pharmacy, the hackers posted a statement 
saying: “Too Much ISIS. Enhance your calm. Too many people are into this 
ISIS-stuff. Please gaze upon this lovely ad so we can upgrade our 
infrastructure to give you ISIS content you all so desperately crave.”

The site was first taken down by GhostSec earlier this week 
<https://twitter.com/IsraelsACG/status/667937641225146368>, but Isis reinstated 
the site, despite security researchers finding that the terrorist group had 
used very poor web security to try and protect it.

Anonymous “declared war” on Isis at the beginning of the year, taking the 
terrorist group’s sites offline, butstepped up operations

 and requested crowdsourced help in the wake of the Paris attacks.

While some have said that hacktivists such as Anonymous, GhostSec and Ghost 
Security Group hinder the investigations of security services, Home Office 
security minister John Hayes said on Tuesday: “I am grateful for any of those 
who are engaged in the battle against this kind of wickedness.”
