Full-time: Portugal 0-0 Austria

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeep! I’m not sure how that game ended scoreless, but it 
has. Cristiano missed several great chances tonight, not least the penalty from 
which he hit the upright. Austria were under the cosh for much of the game, but 
had chances of their own to win the game. They must beat Iceland to advance to 
the second round. On two points,Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> will need a result against 
Hungary if they are to go through to the knockout stages.

76 min: This match is getting more and more scrappy the longer it goes on, 
with constant interruptions for niggley fouls, free-kicks and throw-ins.Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> aren’t as under the cosh as they 
were earlier, it must be said and you can sense the Portuguese nerves.

73 min: Austria win a free-kick about 10 yards outside the Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> penalty area. With David Alaba 
gone off the field, Marko Arnautovic will take this one. Or will he? No, is the 
answer. Instead, Marcel Sabitzer dinks it over the wall in a training ground 
manoeuvre that goes horribly wrong. Arnautovic is not one bit happy, having had 
to suffer the indignity of Alaba pulling rank on him at a previous free-kick.

Half-time: Portugal 0-0 Austria

Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> have done well to 
weather a Portuguese storm in the first-half of a very open game that has, 
curiously, remained scoreless. Both teams have had chances, with Cristiano 
Ronaldo missing the best of the lot, while the otherwise anonymous David Alaba 
went exceedingly close with a free-kick.

Portuguese centre-half frantically tries to prevent the Austrian playmaker from 
getting a cross in from the right. Free-kick for Austria just outside the

Vieirinha heads it clear off the line. Great free-kick, great defending. And a

36 min: Portugal win a corner, with Quaresma putting the ball out of play off 
Fuchs. Quaresma and Coutinho play it short, setting up a move that ends with 
Ronaldo hooking the ball into the arms of Almer from seven yards. He had to 
reach backwards to connect with that ball and was unable to get any power on

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeep! I’m not sure how that game ended scoreless, but it 
has. Cristiano missed several great chances tonight, not least the penalty from 
which he hit the upright. Austria were under the cosh for much of the game, but 
had chances of their own to win the game. They must beat Iceland to advance to 
the second round. On two points,Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> will need a result against 
Hungary if they are to go through to the knockout stages.

90+3 min: Sebastien Prodl wins the ball deep in his opwn half and plays it up 
the field. This is tense.
 
90+2 min: Austria drive forward, with Schopf and Hinterseer combining again. 
They win a throw-in deep inPortugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> territory, but the ball ends up 
going out for a goal-kick.
 
90+1 min: We’re into the first of three minutes of added time. Withy the 
number of late goals this tournament has produced thus far, who’d bet against 
one here?
 
90 min: Austria win a corner after good work down the left from Schopf, who 
attempted to pick out his fellow substitute Hinterseer with a cross from deep.
 
89 min: Silva makes an immediate impression, charging down the inside left 
before drilling in a cross that’s hacked clear.
 
87 min: Austria substitution: Stefan Ilsanker off, Kevin Wimmer on. Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> substitution: Nani off, Rafa 
Silva on.
 
86 min: That was a good decision - Ronaldo was standing a yard offside as that 
free-kick was being taken. He looks on the verge of tears.
 
85 min: From over by the touchline, the ball’s floated into the penalty area, 
where Ronaldo heads it home. Offside!

76 min: This match is getting more and more scrappy the longer it goes on, 
with constant interruptions for niggley fouls, free-kicks and throw-ins.Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> aren’t as under the cosh as they 
were earlier, it must be said and you can sense the Portuguese nerves.
 
73 min: Austria win a free-kick about 10 yards outside the Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> penalty area. With David Alaba 
gone off the field, Marko Arnautovic will take this one. Or will he? No, is the 
answer. Instead, Marcel Sabitzer dinks it over the wall in a training ground 
manoeuvre that goes horribly wrong. Arnautovic is not one bit happy, having had 
to suffer the indignity of Alaba pulling rank on him at a previous free-kick.
 
69 min: Julian Baumgartlinger is very lucky to avoid a booking for a nasty 
stamp on the instep of Joao Moutinho.Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> substitution: Ricardo Quaresmo 
off, Joao Mario on.
 
66 min: Ricardo Quaresma gets down the right and sends a woeful cross straight 
into the hands of Robert Almer.
 
64 min: Baumgartlinger concedes a free-kick about three yards outside the 
Portuguese penalty area, right-hand side. Ronaldo stands over the ball, then 
sends it fizzing over the cross-bar.Austria

after an uncharacteristically ineffective display, Alessandro Schopf on.
 
63 min: Martin Harnik wins his side a throw-in deep in Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> territory. Julian 
Baumgartlinger attempts to cross the ball into the Portuguese penalty area, but 
his effort is deflected into the hands of Rui Patricio off Guerreiro.

62 min: Another corner for Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal>, which Christian Fuchs heads 
clear at the near post.
 
61 min: Quaresma chips the dead ball into the Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> penalty area, where it’s headed 
clear by Martin Hinteregger.
 
60 min: Fuchs gets booked for a trip on Ricardo Quaresma in the space between 
the side line and the edge of the Austria penalty area. Free-kick forPortugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal>.
 
59 min: Austria enjoy a rare sortie into Portuguese territory, but cede 
possession when Christian Fuchs hoists a cross into the air and out of play for 
a goal kick.
 
56 min: Cristiano Ronaldo unleashes a rasping, swerving drive from outside the 
penalty area, which Almer does well to put around the post with a strong left 
hand. That’s a great save. From the corner, Ronaldo leaps highest and plants a 
downward header straight at Almer. It’s allPortugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> here, but they just can’t score.

55 min: Andre Gomes goes a galloping into the Austria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> penalty area, but runs down a 
blind alley in which three opposition defenders lurk.
 
54 min: Joao Moutinho wins a free-kick for Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> deep in Austria territory, over 
by the touchline, after being fouled by Christian Fuchs. Raphael Guerreiro’s 
delivery is dismal.
 
54 min: Joao Moutinho drills the ball into the penalty area towards Nani, but 
Hinteregger hacks clear.
 
53 min: Portugal win a corner, which prompts Nani to signal the crowd to make 
a bit more noise. They duly oblige, butAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> clear the ensuing inswinger.
 
51 min: Pepe surges forward and plays the ball to Nani on the edge of the 
Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> penalty area., He has 
his back to goal and is crowded off the ball.
 
49 min: Ricardo Quaresmo curls a cross into the Austria penalty area, aiming 
for Nani. His delivery is overhit andAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> clear. On the edge of the 
penalty area, a glowering Ronaldo was expecting the ball to be pulled his way.
 
48 min: Portugal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> free-kick, 
about 40 yards from the Austria goal, well right of centre. Cristiano Ronaldo 
gives it the full Jonny Wilkinson before driving his free-kick into the Austria 
wall.
 
47 min: Martin Harnik gets booked for catching Coutinho with his trailing leg. 
 
47 min: Rui Patricio is forced into action early in the second half, the 
Portugal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> keeper forced to dive 
low to his right to keep out a fine low drive from Austria defensive midfielder 
Stefan Ilsanker.
 
46 min: Austria get the second half under way with no changes in personnel on 
either side.

Ashton/AMA/Getty Images  
Austria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/austria> have done well to 
weather a Portuguese storm in the first-half of a very open game that has, 
curiously, remained scoreless. Both teams have had chances, with Cristiano 
Ronaldo missing the best of the lot, while the otherwise anonymous David Alaba 
went exceedingly close with a free-kick.
 
44 min: Christian Fuchs attempts a clearance that goes out of play for a 
throw-in off his team-mate Martin Harnik.
 
43 min: Andre Gomes swings a cross into the Austrian penalty area from a 
little pocket of space just outside the box on the right flank. It’s headed 
clear.

39 min: David Alaba is brought down just outside the Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal> penalty by Pepe as the 
Portuguese centre-half frantically tries to prevent the Austrian playmaker from 
getting a cross in from the right. Free-kick for Austria just outside the 
penalty area. David Alaba attempts to whip the ball inside the far post, but 
Vieirinha heads it clear off the line. Great free-kick, great defending. And a 
yellow card for Pepe.

36 min: Portugal win a corner, with Quaresma putting the ball out of play off 
Fuchs. Quaresma and Coutinho play it short, setting up a move that ends with 
Ronaldo hooking the ball into the arms of Almer from seven yards. He had to 
reach backwards to connect with that ball and was unable to get any power on 
his effort.
 
33 min: Ricardo Quaresmo charges through the centre and plays a low diagonal 
ball out to Nani on the right. Ronaldo meets his curled cross with a firm 
downward header, which Robert Almer does well to keep out. It wouldn’t have 
counted if it had gone in, as the linesman flags for offside. Incorrectly, as 
it happens.
 
30 min: Ricardo Quaresmo gets booked for dissent after being penalised for a 
petulant kick at Sebastian Prodl.
