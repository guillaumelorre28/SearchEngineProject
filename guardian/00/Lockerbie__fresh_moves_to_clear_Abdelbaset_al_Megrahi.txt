A new appeal is set to be launched in the Scottish courts to attempt to clear 
the name of the convicted Lockerbie bomber,Abdelbaset al-Megrahi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdelbaset-al-megrahi>.

Campaigners, including Jim Swire, whose daughter died in the 1988 Pan Am 
bombing, say efforts to overturn Megrahi's 2001 conviction for the murder of 
270 people will go ahead even after the terminally ill Libyan has died.

A book by a former member of Megrahi's legal team forced the Scottish justice 
secretary, Kenny MacAskill, to deny last week claims of a "nod and a wink" 
understanding, under which Megrahi dropped his appeal in exchange for his 
compassionate release and return to Libya.

Megrahi was convicted by a special court of three Scots judges who sat without 
a jury in Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, but John Ashton's book,Megrahi, You 
Are My Jury, quotes the Libyan as saying that he was framed, claiming that 
evidence seen by prosecutors was never passed to the defence. "There was a huge 
pressure to convict and it's clear now there was blatant intellectual 
dishonesty surrounding his trial," said Ashton. "Along with significant new 
forensic evidence, it's pretty clear this is an unsafe conviction."

Evidence not seen by the defence includes a break-in at Heathrow in the early 
hours of 21 December 1988, that could have allowed a device to be planted among 
security-screened Pan Am luggage. Doubts have also been cast over payments made 
to a key prosecution witness and a circuit board fragment found in the wreckage 
that prosecutors said was part of bomb timer made for Libyan authorities.
