Vivendi is to sell half its stake in Activision Blizzard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/activision-blizzard>, the maker of 
games including Call of Duty, worth more than $850m.

The French media conglomerate is looking to pay down debt and concentrate on 
its core media assets, which include pay-TV business Canal Plus and Universal 
Music.

Vivendi <https://www.theguardian.com/media/vivendi> is to sell 41.5m shares in 
Activision, representing about 5.8% of the games maker's shares.

Based on Wednesday's closing price the stake is worth about $866m, although 
the exact sale price will not be known later on Thursday when the US 
stockmarket opens.

Following the deal Vivendi will be left with 41.5m shares, about 5.8%, with 
the company intending to sell its entire holding eventually.

Last July Vivendi sold more than 85% of its stake in Activision, which makes 
titles including World of Warcraft, for $8.2bn.

As part of the deal the company agreed to sell-off the remaining stake over a 
15-month period, the next share sale can take place in 2015.

Last month Vivendi agreed to sell SFR, France's second largest phone company, 
to cable operator Numericable in a £14bn deal.

Last week the company completed the sale of Moroccan phone company Maroc 
Telecom.

executive of Cosmopolitan publisher Hearst magazines,will take over
