Blueberries aren't actually blue, but deep purple, which is the colour of 
anthocyanin, a pigment that is especially rich in blueberries.

Humans have evolved to be attracted to, and to want to eat, coloured foods. 
For example, our ancestors would have known to eat berries that had a rich 
colour, because that meant they were sweet and ripe. Animals would also have 
been attracted to the vivid colour of ripe berries, and would have eaten the 
berries, resulting in the seeds being spread around afterwards when they went 
to the toilet. This effectively ensures that there are more berries available 
the following year, so it's a clever way for a plant species to survive.

Blueberries are known to be high in antioxidants, which are good for the human 
body; the anthocyanin is thought to be useful for combating inflammation. 
A good rule to follow is, the darker the berry, the more anthocyanins 
are present.
