ITV has signed deals with two companies to produce a range of free and 
paid-for games based on Simon Cowell's new big-budget primetime showRed or 
Black? <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/red-or-black>.

The show, which will be fronted by Anthony McPartlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/anthonymcpartlin> and Declan Donnelly, gives 
contestants the chance to win £1m on the spin of a wheel.

ITV has signed a deal with online gambling company Gamesys to produce a series 
of four pay-to-play games based on the branding of the gameshow.

The games – called Red or Black Slots, Red or Black Instant, Red or Black Hi 
Lo and Red or Black Stacks – will be available at www.jackpotjoy.com.

The games will be promoted with a TV ad campaign and will cost from 5p to 50p 
to play. They will not be made available through ITV.com.

ITV and Cowell's Syco, which is co-producing the show, initially tried to 
negotiate a deal with Camelot, which runs the National Lottery,but failed to 
reach a deal

.

The broadcaster has also struck a deal with Monterosa, a company specialising 
in social TV, to create a play-along experience to go with Red or Black?.

The free game, which will be made available at ITV.com, will allow viewers to 
play along with contestants on the show.

They will also be able to compete with Facebook friends.

"A primetime production of the scale of Red or Black? clearly has a huge 
amount of potential off air," said Denise O'Donoghue, managing director of ITV 
Studios UK. "Working with Syco we have been exploring the best opportunities to 
fully exploit this fantastic programme idea."

An ITV spokeswoman said: "It made commercial sense to license the brand to 
market leaders, who run the UK's leading gaming website. ITV.com has strong 
plans to support Red or Black?, which includes the play-along game."

Channel 4 has had huge success with online play-along games for its gameshow 
Million Pound Drop.

Like Cowell's other ITV1 shows, The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, the 
production will be filmed in an arena – in this case, Wembley Arena. It airs 
from 3 September.

In June, ITV signed a £1m deal with Domino's Pizza to sponsor Red or Black?.
