fun-loving, heavy drinker was sealed by his animated victory celebrations, has 
opened up about now being teetotal as part of his battle with depression.

Flintoff was famously pictured looking the worse for wear on an open top bus 
tour through London and at a Downing Street reception after England had beaten 
Australia to win the 2005 Ashes series.

But on the eve of this year’s series, Flintoff told the BBC’s Desert Island 
Discs <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b060yk4m> radio programme that the days 
when he inspired team-mates by dancing naked to Johnny Cash’s Ring of Fire were 
now consigned to the past.

The retired all-rounder, who played in 79 Tests for England and is now a 
37-year-old father of three, told the presenter Kirsty Young about struggling 
with depression, his decision to stop drinking and his devotion to family life.

Flintoff said he stopped the all-night drinking bouts after making a 
documentary about depression in sport in 2012.

“It’s not so much the drinking, it’s actually the reasons why you are 
drinking,” he explained. “When you are drinking because you are trying to get 
away from something I think that is when you have got to look at everything.

“One of the reasons I probably stopped drinking is that I am prone to suffer 
from depression. Drinking doesn’t help one bit. I don’t touch it now.”

He realised his drinking had started to become a problem when he was sacked as 
the England vice-captain in 2007 after getting drunk and taking a pedalo out to 
sea in St Lucia following a World Cup defeat.

“My heart goes out to anyone out there who is struggling now,” he added.
