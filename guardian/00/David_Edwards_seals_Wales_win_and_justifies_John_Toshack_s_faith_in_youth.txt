Wolves midfielder David Edwards secured a hard fought victory for the youngest 
ever Wales international side againstAzerbaijan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/azerbaijan> to keep John Toshack's faint 
hopes of qualification alive.

Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> had been subjected to some 
intimidating tackling by former Scotland manager Berti Vogts's side but slowly 
got to grips with the match after a nervous start.

The goal came after a burst down the right by Rob Earnshaw in the 41st minute 
and a cross that caused panic in the Azeri area. Farkhad Velijev punched the 
ball out, but it hit Church and rebounded for Edwards to fire home.

Wales had earlier threatened From a corner in which Aaron Ramsey saw a shot 
charged down and Craig Morgan's effort was blocked and then hacked clear.

Simon Church was then presented with a good opening after 31 minutes when he 
latched on to a bad square pass from Vladimir Levin and set off towards goal 
only for a desperate saving tackle from Rashad Sadigov to stop him in his 
tracks.

But Wales were growing in confidence and goalkeeper Veliyev had to snatch the 
ball away from Earnshaw's toes as another Chris Gunter cross came low into the 
box.

Azerbaijan brought on Branimir Subasic for Ramin at the break and then Javid 
Huseynov for Nabiyev soon after the restart and the hosts set about bombarding 
Wales with long balls.

But the Wales youngsters held out with Wayne Hennessey making a vital save 
midway through the second half to keep out Subasic and secure three points for 
Toshack.
