Amanda Knox <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amanda-knox> has been cleared 
of slandering police officers and a prosecutor involved in the investigation 
into the 2007 killing of British student Meredith Kercher.

Knox, who shared a student house with Kercher in the Italian city of Perugia, 
served four years in prison for participating in Kercher’s killing before being 
released on appeal and thenfinally definitively acquitted last year

.

Knox, 28, retains a conviction for slandering a Congolese bar owner she 
incriminated in Kercher’s murder. She later said that claim had been extracted 
under duress during an interrogation in which she was yelled at, slapped and 
threatened by police.

It was that claim that led to the slander charges but a judge in Florence 
ruled Thursday that the comments did not constitute slander.

Local media quoted Knox’s lawyers as saying the former student, who is now 
working as a journalist in her hometown Seattle, was “very happy with the 
acquittal”.
