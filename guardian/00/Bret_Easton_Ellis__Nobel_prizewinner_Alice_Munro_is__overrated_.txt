The announcement of Alice Munro's Nobel prize in literature 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/10/alice-munro-wins-nobel-prize-in-literature>
 last week seemed to be universally hailed by fellow writers and devoted 
readers alike, with novelist AS Byatt describing it as as the Nobel "that has 
made me happiest in the whole of my life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/11/alice-munro-byatt-enright-toibin>
". One voice was raised in opposition, however: the sharp-tongued satirist Bret 
Easton Ellis, who branded Munro "so completely overrated".

Munro's reputation has grown steadily over decades, gradually persuading those 
who at first attempted to dismiss her as a "housewife", "domestic" or "boring",
according to Margaret Atwood

.

However, the author of American Psycho, the 1991 serial killer novel about a 
nihilistic Manhattan businessman, was unconvinced. He tweeted:

Alice Munro <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-munro> is so completely 
overrated.

Easton Ellis went on to dismiss the Nobel prize in literature in its entirety:

Alice Munro was always an overrated writer and now that she's won The Nobel 
she always will be. The Nobel is a joke and has been for ages...

The twitterati failed to fall in behind the controversial writer, however, 
with many sending up Easton Ellis. Short story writer Bev Vincent tweeted:

Bret Easton Ellis calls Alice Munro 'overated.' http://t.co/9SW0wpoxtr 
<http://t.co/9SW0wpoxtr> When asked for a comment, Ms Munro said, "Who?" (͡° ͜ʖ 
͡°)

Munro's win was hailed by writers including Byatt, Colm Tóibín and the 2007 
Man Booker prizewinner Anne Enright, who wrote that Munro's "stories do not ask 
for our praise, but for our attention. We feel, when we read them, less lonely 
than we were before."

Easton Ellis was eventually swayed by the tide of public support for Munro, 
conceding that maybe he needed to give Munro another read. He tweeted:

The sentimental hatred for me has made me want to re-read Munro, who I never 
really got, because now I feel like I've beaten-up Santa Claus.
