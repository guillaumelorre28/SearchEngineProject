The main attractions in Armenia are outdoor activities and historical 
sightseeing. The country boasts some beautiful scenery and its nature is 
relatively untouched. The Shikahogh reserve, in the south of the country, 
apparently features forest so dense no human has ever set foot there. In the 
cold and snowy winters, skiing opportunities abound in the country's small but 
well-equipped ski resort.

A mountainous country in the southern Caucuses, Armenia is landlocked between 
Turkey, Iran, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The former Soviet state's lowest point is 
396 metres (1,300 feet) and the country rises to its highest peak, Mount 
Aragats, at 4,090 metres. Mount Ararat, the Armenian national symbol, is just 
over the border in Turkey but at 5,165 metres (16,945 feet) high it looms over 
the capital, Yerevan. Compensating for the country's lack of coast is Lake 
Sevan, which covers close to 5% of Armenian territory.

The first country in the world to adopt Christianity as its state religion, 
Armenia features hundreds of churches and monasteries, which are usually 
located on the tops of hills or in the heart of steep gorges. Further off the 
beaten track there are carved monuments known as Khachkars, which bear a close 
resemblance to the Celtic cross. Yerevan is a small but pleasant capital that 
regularly features all kinds of cultural events.

The country has some excellent food and the increasing numbers of tourists, 
who mostly come from the 4 million-strong Armenian diaspora, are pushing up 
standards. Although Armenians are not quite as keen on drinking as their 
neighbours in Georgia they still make some excellent cognacs, vodka, wine and 
beer.

History hangs heavily around the neck of Armenia. Political discourse is still 
dominated by the genocide of 1915, in which Armenians say more than a million 
of their kin were marched out of their homes in eastern Turkey and killed by 
Turkish forces. Turkey denies these killings were genocide and describes the 
incident as a civil war in which Armenians and Turks were killed.

Climate

The climate is termed as highland continental, making for hot summers and cold 
winters. Temperatures on the plain around Yerevan can rise above 35C in the 
summer. Much of the country is under snow during the winter when temperatures 
in Yerevan sit at around 0C but can fall much lower. The mountainous regions 
can experience temperatures as low as -30C during winter.
Health

Vaccinations against diphtheria, hepatitis A, tetanus and polio are not 
required but recommended. There is a small risk of malaria in rural areas 
during the summer regions.Netdoctor.co.uk

Food

Armenian cuisine is divided into western and eastern styles, both of which are 
represented in restaurants in Yerevan. Simple eateries will serve a cheap but 
great meal of homemade cheese, bread, salad and pork chops. More sophisticated 
places will serve specialities such as pastry parcels of meat served in yoghurt 
known as Mante, a variation on Dolma and an Armenian sausage known as Sujuk.
