Wimbledon champion Roger Federer trounced Carlos Ferrero in straight sets 
today to reach his first Australian Open final and climb to the top of the 
world rankings.

In a surprisingly one-sided semi-final, the Swiss No2 seed won 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 
to set up a meeting with Russia's Marat Safin in Sunday's final in Melbourne.

Ferrero, the French Open champion, had been expected to give Federer a stern 
test but was swept aside. Federer's victory also earned him the world number 
one ranking when the new ATP standings are released on Monday.

"I knew I had the chance to be No1 in the world," the Wimbledon champion 
sighed with relief. "Maybe I have a poker-face most of the time but I felt 
nervous."

Those nerves were never on show as the stylish Swiss hit shots lesser players 
only dream of, humbling the French Open champion in the process.

"I am confident. I mean, have you ever seen a No1 in the world who is not that 
confident?" he joked on court, immediately settling into his new status.

Looking forward to Sunday's showpiece, Federer said: "(Marat is) a great 
player, it will be a great match. He's in the finals and it's very nice to see."

 Federer, who had never been beyond the fourth round of the Aussie Open, 
grabbed the opening set in just 32 minutes and never looked back against an 
out-of-sorts Ferrero who had complained of groin and elbow injuries during the 
two-week event.

In all, it took the Wimbledon champion, nicknamed the "Fed Express", less than 
90 minutes to complete a three-set whitewash and set up an intriguing contest 
with Safin.

On Thursday, the unpredictable Russian, back to his best form after being 
plagued by injury, downed defending champion Andre Agassi in five thrilling 
sets.
