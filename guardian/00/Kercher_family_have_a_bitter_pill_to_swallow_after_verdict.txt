The mother of murdered British student Meredith Kercher said she was 
“surprised and very shocked” by an Italian court’s decision to overturn the 
convictions of Amanda Knox andRaffaele Sollecito

death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia,Italy

Arline Kercher, Meredith’s mother, said she had heard little more about the 
decision other than the verdict.

She said last night: “I am a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is 
about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice so it’s a bit odd that 
it should change now.”

Francesco Maresca, the lawyer for the Kercher family, was also disappointed by 
the ruling, saying: “I think that it’s a defeat for the Italian justice system.”

On Friday night the long-running case appeared to have been brought to a 
conclusion after more than seven years of twists, turns and retrials. But it 
was not the conclusion the Kercher family would have wished for or expected.

When Meredith Kercher’s family first heard the news last year that Knox and 
her former boyfriend Sollecito had had their convictions for the Briton’s 
murder reinstated, they looked ahead to the day when the verdict might be made 
final by Italy’s highest court.


“Nothing, of course, will ever bring Meredith back,” her brother Lyle said at 
the time. “The best we can hope for is, of course, finally bringing this whole 
case to a conclusion, and then everyone can move on with their lives.”

Throughout the saga that has followed the Leeds University student’s murder, 
the family has sought to stay out of the spotlight and, before Friday night’s 
verdict, had expressed steady confidence in Italy’s notoriously slow and 
backed-up legal system, saying that the multiple tiers of appeals were designed 
to arrive at the right verdict.

Whether that faith would remain solid after the court of cassation’s ruling, 
however, was unclear. Although the family have always been careful not to 
personalise the legal battle, they may well find the definitive clearing of 
both Knox and Sollecito hard to fathom. An earlier verdict by the court of 
cassation, which found Rudy Guede, an Ivorian, definitively guilty of Kercher’s 
murder, specified that the murder could not have been carried out by him alone, 
and that he must have had accomplices.

How, therefore, the only other people who have ever been seriously considered 
suspects in the case are now to walk free – for good – as a result of the same 
court is likely to be a bitter pill for the family to swallow.

Previously in the case, observers have said the Kerchers often felt 
outmanoeuvred by what they called Knox’s “PR machine”.

In an article in Newsweek, reporter and author Barbie Latza Nadeau described 
how the media’s insatiable appetite for “Foxy Knoxy” had pushed Kercher, the 
British victim, off the front page.

“The American TV networks, especially, were generous to the Knox family, 
paying for airline tickets and meals when trials were in session. On the night 
of one of the verdicts, a high-powered American producer even babysat Knox’s 
little sisters in exchange for God only knows what,” she wrote.


Amid the media frenzy, Kercher’s sister, Stephanie, said in 2011 that she 
feared “Meredith has been almost forgotten in all this”.

And last year she admitted that the family may never be given the answers they 
so badly want. “I think we’re still on a journey to the truth,” she said. “It 
may be we don’t ever really know what happened that night and that’s something 
we’ll have to come to terms with.”
