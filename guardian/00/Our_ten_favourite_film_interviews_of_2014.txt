Thora Birch by Hadley Freeman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/23/thora-birch-hollywood-darling-disappeared>


On the surface Thora Birch (American Beauty, Ghost World) was the indie star 
who simply burned out. In fact, she’s been working since her heydey, plugging 
on with TV movies and stage shows to critical indifference. She was too angry 
and too smart for Hollywood, she says. Hadley Freeman found her skittish, 
unpredictable company: a victim of “bad luck, bad timing and a bad reputation”.


“She has the dazed but anxious air of someone who has just emerged from a long 
sleep and is astonished at how much time has passed”

Behind the icon lies - unsurprisingly - a fairly normal man. Catherine Shoard 
waded through the rabid fandom of the Toronto film festival’s “Bill Murray Day” 
to meet Mr Caddyshack himself. He has strong feelings about Ralph Nader and 
seatbelts.


“We’re shown to a room and I help him read the Coke bottle label (he only 
drinks Mexican, on account of the corn syrup). We inspect the facilities. He 
suggests we take a bath or watch a DVD. Four hardboiled eggs and some fried 
potatoes are ushered in. He doesn’t touch them.”

 Hollywood insider ... Julianne Moore Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters 
Where better to talk about phony old Hollywood then the Cannes film festival, 
the dream machine’s Riviera pop-up shop? Julianne Moore, star of David 
Cronenberg’sMaps to the Stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/maps-to-the-stars>, talked to Xan Brooks 
about fame, loneliness and the death of her regular co-star, Philip Seymour 
Hoffman.

“I do remember when I was starting acting, going from one set to the next, 
with not much else going on in my life,” she says. “And at the end of the day 
you get back to your hotel room and just feel this awful loneliness, because 
the cameras have stopped rolling. If you ever want to have an existential 
moment, that’s the time. You sit there and think, ‘Who am I?’.”

 Cinematography’s Keith Richards ... Christopher Doyle Photograph: Andrew H.

“The Keith Richards of the film world” ranted, shouted, raved and hollered at 
Alex Godfrey for a full hour from Hong Kong via Skype. The legendary 
cinematographer who swore at Scorsese and called Life of Pi’s Oscar “a fucking 
insult” was forthright, entertaining and very, very rude. He was promoting 
Sebastian Silva’sMagic Magic <https://www.theguardian.com/film/magic-magic>. 
The plug got lost in the storm.


“I’m fucking pissed off that [Charles] Bukowski stopped drinking when he was 
76,” he says. “If you’re gonna be a legend in your own Y-fronts, you better 
fill your Y-fronts with bottles of beer.”

Daniel Radcliffe by Tim Jonze

A pretend interview preceded Tim Jonze’s real one. A TV crew following Daniel 
Radcliffe <https://www.theguardian.com/film/daniel-radcliffe> wanted Tim to 
“meet” him for the cameras. The meta-logic makes sense in the ex-Harry Potter’s 
world, where the cameras are always on and privacy is a problem. That’s why 
Radcliffe went to the Reading festival in a gas mask ...


“There seems something slightly sad about having to go to a music festival 
dressed as if you were heading to the western front. Does Radcliffe worry that 
he missed out on a normal teenagedom? He sighs. “I mean, maybe? I don’t know. I 
still got to go to Reading. I still had a great time. It’s one of those things 
that everyone wants to tell me I missed out on ... but I wouldn’t know, I’ve 
only lived my life this way.”

 ‘Hollywood’s a whorehouse’ ... John Cusack Photograph: Karen Robinson 
Maps to the Stars is David Cronenberg’s Hollywood body-slam. It rages against 
the industry’s obsession with youth, it’s treatment of women and our 
willingness to let this shabbiness continue. Henry Barnes asked it’s star,John 
Cusack <https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-cusack>, how much of it was real. 
All of it, he said.


“I have actress friends who are being put out to pasture at 29,” he says. 
“They just want to open up another can of hot 22. It’s becoming almost like 
kiddie porn. It’s fucking weird.”

 Shaggy dog story ... John Sessions Photograph: Martin Godwin 
The improv pioneer behind Stella Street was struck by stage fright after the 
death of his mother. He left the theatre behind and could be seen this year as 
the larger-than-life villian of Pudsey: The Movie. He told Stephen Moss about 
living with depression and finding his feet again, even if they’re next to a 
talking dog ...

“Far more distinguished actors than I have done children’s films and then 
returned to putting on the tights and crown,” he says. But playing second 
fiddle to a dog? “If that’s the worst that happens to me,” he says, “I’ll be 
very lucky.”

People hate Keira Knightley <https://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley> 
and she’s not sure why. Xan Brooks found her forgetful, flustered fun as they 
attempted to explain the hostility she provokes. For his money she’s simply 
waiting for the right project to come along. Unfortunately, Begin Again - a 
soggy indie rom-com that sets her up as a folky singer-songwriter - wasn’t it.


“It’s terrible. I know nothing about music whatsoever,” she says. “I mean, I 
could probably bullshit you and come up with an album that I’ve heard is really 
cool, but you’d probably find me out.”

Abel Ferrara by Catherine Shoard

A sleepy Cannes competition left room for a noisemaker. Abel Ferrara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/abel-ferrara> - refused a spot on the 
official programme - rolled into town with tent and projector and decided to 
screen his film his own damn self. Welcome to New York was an outrageous romp 
“inspired” by the DSK scandal. It immediately caused a scandal. Catherine 
Shoard chased Ferrara up and down the Croissette to get his reaction to the 
hoo-hah.


“I’m the guy in front,” he says. “The bullets come; you get hit first. So 
what? I know the deal. It’s coming in the fucking window, you dig? It’s in my 
soul.”

The director of our film of the year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/the-10-best-films-of-2014-no-1-under-the-skin>
 took 10 years to make his adaptation of Michel Faber’s cult novel. Danny Leigh 
unpicked the elaborate making of a modern masterpiece with the film-maker, who 
still doesn’t seem sure if he’s happy with it.


“I’m a bit bereft without the film,” he says. “It’s like falling in love. You 
think, what do I love? I lovethis. Some people love it, some are repulsed. Fair 
enough.”
