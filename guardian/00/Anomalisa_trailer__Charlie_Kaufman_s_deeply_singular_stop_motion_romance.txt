has promised to campaign for the picture).

The film is quirky and, like all of Kaufman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlie-kaufman>’s work, deeply singular – 
and is the film-maker’s first stab at animation. It centers on Michael Stone, a 
middle-aged married motivational speaker (voiced by David Thewlis), haunted by 
memories of a woman he walked out on 11 years earlier. During a business trip, 
he encounters a woman (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh) who changes his dour 
outlook on his existence.


Anomalisa <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anomalisa> is on limited release 
from 30 December. It goes nationwide (in the US) in January.
