Wildlife <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife> officers have 
relocated a young cassowary, known by locals as Ruthie, after it threatened an 
elderly man and tried to enter his Innisfail home.

It is the second time this month a cassowary has been relocated in north 
Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> due to 
aggressive behaviour.

The Department of Environment and Heritage Protection said it was first 
alerted to potential problems with the bird in early August.

Rangers were called to the Coquette Point home last week after reports the 
bird was behaving aggressively and trying to break into an elderly man’s home.

“The decision was reluctantly taken to relocate the bird after it was clear it 
had become accustomed to associate people with being fed,” according to the 
department.

The cassowary was tranquilised and relocated to a remote area of rainforest, 
away from human interaction.

EHP has again urged people not to feed or interact with the endangered species.
