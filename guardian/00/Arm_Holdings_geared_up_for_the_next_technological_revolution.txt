The smartphone revolution has transformed Arm Holdings into the UK’s leading 
technology company, but while the pace of change is now showing signs of 
slowing, Arm is not. Instead, the Cambridge-based company appears to be at the 
heart of a new front in technological innovation.

Founded in a Cambridge barn 25 years ago, Arm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/armholdings> is now worth almost £14bn. 
With its hi-tech focus and non-London base, it is the sort of company the 
government wants at the forefront of the country’s economy.

Arm designs the key technology that goes into making chips and then licenses 
it to semiconductor manufacturers. It has become a key supplier toApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> and its technology is 
effectively the brains behind the iPhone.

However, only 45% of the 15bn chips that featured its technology last year 
were for mobile devices. Arm has now developed its technology so far that it 
could have major implications for day-to-day life. It has cut the size and cost 
and improved the energy efficiency of chips so much that, in theory, they can 
be embedded into many everyday objects and devices. The company is at the 
forefront of what has become known as the “internet of things”.

“Some of our licensees sell chips for 20 cents that have got more compute 
power in them than put a man on the moon,” said Simon Segars, the chief 
executive of Arm. “So if you put that everywhere, imagine what you can then do 
with the data.”

Segars was the 16th employee to join Arm and led the development of the Arm7 
and Arm9, the processors in the first digital mobile phones. He became chief 
executive in 2013, replacing Warren East, now the boss of Rolls-Royce.

Arm has already diversified into washing machines and digital televisions, 
meaning the proportion of the company’s technology in mobiles has rapidly 
decreased from a decade ago. However, the opportunities outside mobile are 
growing as devices across households and towns become connected to the internet.

Segars, who lives with his family in Silicon Valley, said: “You really won’t 
see a big ‘aha’ moment where you go ‘Aha the internet of things is here’. It is 
going to be quite gradual, but, as an overall technology trend, it can impact 
everything.

“A lot of it is in invisible infrastructure that just makes a city like London 
work more effectively. The fact that the street lights turn on when it gets 
dark instead of at 4.30 is because a computer somewhere worked out it is dark 
so turns the lights on. Most of embedded computing is going to be in things you 
never see.”

Arm believes more computers will be embedded into cars, creating a major new 
market for the company. Segars says automotive investment by technology 
companies, traditional carmakers and venture capitalists in the area has 
“exploded”.

“Automotive is another example where because of what you can economically 
build in silicon there is an opportunity to make cars smarter, safer, use less 
fuel and just better. That comes about through having computers embedded in 
cars,” Segars said.

“If you extrapolate that further, you can get the car doing things for itself. 
The ultimate goal of self-driving cars I think is a few years away. A 
self-driving car is going to need a lot of computer power in it, a car becomes 
a super computer on wheels.”

Arm is already working on automotive projects with a range of companies, but 
Segars refused to comment on rumours that Apple is planning a driverless car 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/18/apple-meets-california-officials-self-driving-car>
.

Despite Apple reporting a slowdown in sales of the iPhone, Segars said that 
Arm should continue to enjoy increasing revenues in mobile as smartphones get 
even more powerful and sales of entry-level and mid-range devices grow.

The increasing number of smartphones in emerging economies means Arm 
technology could be used to tackle a range of health and social problems. The 
company is working with Unicef, which has set up innovation labs that are 
working on using photos taken by smartphones to diagnose health problems.

“If you are a subsistence farmer in Africa and you upgrade from a basic 
handset that does voice and text to something that allows you to connect to the 
internet and gives you access to the world’s data, that is quite a 
life-changing moment and the positive side effects of all of that I think is 
going to be incredible,” Segars said.

As the spread of Arm’s technology and smartphones broadens, so does concern 
about security. The topic is high on the industry’s agenda afterApple 
criticised the FBI’s request to build a back door into the encrypted data in an 
iPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/fbi-director-james-comey-apple-encryption-case-legal-precedent>
. Arm would have to develop the backdoor into its technology if the FBI gets it 
way, but it is clear Segars shares the views of Apple boss Tim Cook.

“We believe users should own their data and control who has access to it,” he 
said. “Security systems should be as robust as possible to ensure that. New 
connected technologies will only achieve scale if they are trusted so 
maintaining a foundation of security is of paramount importance.”

 Segars declined to comment on the Apple and FBI row. On the possible Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/brexit-what-would-happen-if-britain-left-eu-european-union-referendum-uk>
, he said he was not one of the 200 company bosses who signed a letter stating 
that Britain should remain in the European Union. However, Segars says the 
company supports Britain remaining in the EU.

“We are pro low barriers to trade, and the EU enables that, and we are 
definitely a beneficiary of being able to hire easily from a larger pool of 
people. That helps our business. So from that angle, we would like those 
conditions to remain.”

The company employs 1,600 people in Cambridge-, just under half its total 
workforce, and this includes employees from 23 EU countries other than the UK.

 Segers said that Brexit might have little impact on Arm, which will give hope 
to campaigners pushing for the country to leave the EU. “I can’t imagine it is 
going to make that much difference really. We are a UK listed company, our 
headquarters is here – that ain’t going to change.”
