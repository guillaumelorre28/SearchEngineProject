Hitler himself was keen to destroy much of what was known about his early 
life, and when the Germans invaded Austria in 1938, an attempt was made to 
seize any material that might have cast him in an embarrassing light. But some 
things did survive. His reports from what we'd call primary school suggest that 
he was a fairly bright and normal child. Out of school, he liked playing 
cowboys and Indians or cops and robbers with pals in the fields around where 
they lived.

He seems to have been ordinary and well adapted, which, in a way, is 
remarkable given his fractured home life. The family moved around a lot. 
Hitler's mother, Klara, was his father's third wife, and she had six children, 
but only two survived infancy. She smothered Adolf, and tried to protect him 
from his father, a tyrannical man who often beat his son. If you saw a boy 
growing up in such a household now, you'd say, "My goodness, poor child."
