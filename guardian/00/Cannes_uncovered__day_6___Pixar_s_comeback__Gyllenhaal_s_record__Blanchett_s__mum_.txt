We’re at the halfway point of this year’s Cannes which gives us a bit of 
perspective on how this year’s set of films are shaping up, in comparison to 
previous festivals. Last year we awarded five stars to Leviathan, Two Days, One 
Night, Foxcatcher and Mr Turner while this year’s crop has already matched that 
number withCarol <https://www.theguardian.com/film/carol>, Amy, Tale of Tales 
and Son of Saul all getting top marks. It bodes well, given how many big movies 
are still set to be unveiled.

The sheer number of films does mean that not all are that well attended. As 
part of the festival, a set of classics are being shown on the beach, a 
beautiful setting for any screening, apart from maybeBlood Beach 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Beach> or Sand Sharks 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Sharks>. But last night’s was a damp, or 
rather dripping wet, squib:

As well as the big name actors and directors, Cannes always offers up a number 
of surprising celebrity attendees. This year, Cheryl Fernandez Versini aka Cole 
and Robbie Williams both turned up to big premieres without any clear 
film-related purpose. Still waiting on Robbie’s thoughts on The Sea of Trees.

It’s been a rocky few years for Pixar with underwhelming sequels and that one 
with the bears blurring the memory of all their triumphs. This morning saw the 
first screening of Inside Out, their first original film for three years, and 
the reaction has been pleasingly positive.Peter Bradshaw handed out four stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar>
, calling it “slick, smart and funny” while others have been equally enthralled:

Disney Pixar's Inside Out is fantastic. Audience snorting with recognition at 
so many of the jokes and sharp observations.#Cannes2015

The ambitious comedy plays out inside a young girl’s head as her conflicting 
feelings are represented as different characters. The voice cast includes Amy 
Poehler and Mindy Kaling and we’ll be hearing from the cast at a press 
conference later today - news on that coming later.

This year’s line-up, both in and out of competition, has been largely 
blockbuster-free with just Mad Max: Fury Road andInside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out> waving the pom-poms for the big 
studios. But both are now huge crowd-pleasing hits with critics, suggesting a 
more selective strategy, not just focusing on big names for the added column 
inches. Inside Out’s female protagonist should make for another girl-fuelled 
box office hit this summer, after Cinderella made over $520m earlier this year.

News/Corbis 
Last night saw the premiere of Carol, already the festival’s most talked about 
film, which has been gathering five star raves,including from Peter Bradshaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/carol-review-cate-blanchett-captivates-in-woozily-obsessive-lesbian-romance>
. Leads Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara were in attendance, alongside director 
Todd Haynes, as well as Eva Longoria, Sienna Miller, Jake Gyllenhaal and Salma 
Hayek. Apparently there was a 10-minute standing ovation for the film, which 
sounds somewhat exhausting. I spoke to Rooney Mara earlier today who told me it 
was “a bit awkward”. Director Todd Haynes also told me that while the 
overwhelmingly positive reviews make him happy, they also make him nervous. 
It’s a long campaign to sustain as the film won’t land until the end of the 
year but, given the Weinstein power behind it, most are still confident it’ll 
be a major awards contender in 2016.

We headed down to the vodka-fuelled after party, where Cate Blanchett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett> brought her mum June along, 
making everyone else’s mum feel jealous. We’ve got more from Blanchett on video 
coming up later, sadly without June.

The breakout hit
 The calm before the storm in horror Green Room. 
An exceptionally long queue to get into a 230pm screening should have been my 
first clue that gory horror Green Room was going to be something worth tweeting 
about and despite the odd setting for such a grimy film (it felt like a late 
night SXSW choice), it went down a storm:
Aaron Hillis (@cobblehillis) 
GREEN ROOM: Incredibly violent, punks-versus-skins thriller ups BLUE RUIN's 
ante with escalating tension and shocking humor. Bravo!#Cannes

Director Jeremy Saulnier’s followup to Blue Ruin (which premiered at Cannes in 
2013), stars Patrick Stewart as the head of a neo-Nazi group who hold a rock 
band hostage after they inadvertently witness a murder. It’s brutally 
effective, andI gave it four stars yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/green-room-review-horror-cannes-film-festival-2015-patrick-stewart>
. Horror fans will go nuts for it. Expect to hear much more about it when it 
finally lands at an unspecified date.

We’ve commented on some of the shlockier films being put on sale at this 
year’s market but at the higher end of the scale, some big names have also been 
involved in some classier deals. The biggest so far comes from directorTom Ford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford>, who is following up his 
Oscar-nominated drama A Single Man, with a high-concept thriller called 
Nocturnal Animals. His pitch, which apparently included him spraying a scent at 
certain buyers to evoke a certain mood, was a hit and Focus Features has picked 
it up for a whopping $20m.

The film is an adaptation of the creepy 1993 book Tony & Susan, written by 
Austin Wright, which tells two stories at once: one is about a woman who 
receives a manuscript from her ex husband which causes her to relive their 
relationship as she reads while the other is the story she’s reading, a violent 
survival thriller. Ford has already attachedJake Gyllenhaal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jake-gyllenhaal> and Amy Adams in the lead 
roles but lost his producer George Clooney, who backed out last week. There 
were rumours of a falling out but both actor and director have denied this.

 Emily Blunt in Sicario. 
Tomorrow morning sees the first press screening for Sicario, a new thriller 
from Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve, which stars Emily Blunt as an FBI 
agent on the trail of a drug cartel. We’ll also have news from Abel Ferrara’s 
press conference on his new movie Siberia. Which, given his recent track record 
for controversy, should prove interesting.

Right I’m off to ask Cheryl what she thought of Woody Allen’s latest. See you 
tomorrow.
