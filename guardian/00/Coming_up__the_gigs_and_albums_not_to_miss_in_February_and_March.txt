Elton John

The rumour mill is spinning like a wonderful, crazy top for this upbeat 32nd 
Elton album; media reports suggest many in the singer’s close circle have 
departed and that Elton’s now-former label, Capitol, passed on it.

Wonderful Crazy Night is released 5 February on Mercury Records

TI’s recent album, Currents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/19/tame-impala-currents-review-kevin-parker-hearbreak-album>
, only magnified the Australian psych band’s appeal: adding tunes that stirred 
glistening funk into the band’s heady swirl. Even groovier live than on record, 
the five-strong touring band drop by for three shows in Manchester and London.
