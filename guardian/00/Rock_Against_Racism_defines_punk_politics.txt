A group of activist artists were already bothered by the rise of the far right 
when Eric Clapton's boozy onstage endorsement of Enoch Powell spurred them to 
found Rock Against Racism. Described by co-founder Red Saunders as "a raggedy

Robinson and the Clash, the April 1978 carnival in east London's Victoria Park 
was its high-water mark. According to Billy Bragg: "It was the moment when my 
generation took sides."
