 Good to meet you ... Sheila Pana 
I come from a family forever being wrenched from the paper of their choice. My 
parents were loyal to the News Chronicle until it went under, before finally 
settling on the Times. On going to Reading University in 1971 I quickly learnt 
that anything but the Guardian and Private Eye was "not in", so I duly 
sauntered about the campus with both on view. I married a fellow student and 
arrived in Greece in 1976 (where, as a qualified psychometrician, I now work at 
a Jewish/Greek old people's home in Athens). My (Greek) husband and I still 
read the Guardian until, without warning, the International Guardian replaced 
it and all news of cultural Britain disappeared. We changed to the European, 
the Independent, and then the Times (reluctantly) until they all ceased, and 
finally the Telegraph, but at last, salvation! Browsing in the airport bookshop 
we spotted a UK Guardian â€“ It was like finding a nugget in the gold rush. After 
20 years I am once again enjoying a Saturday Guardian (both time and expense 
prohibit more frequency) and squirrelling away articles of interest to study 
later. Deborah Orr is a favourite who gently points out alternative values and 
I find the Family section fascinating and often professionally enlightening. I 
always start with the world coverage (and find your articles onGreece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> very useful).
