solo artists

 in music, with more than twice the income of the second-placed artist, Adele. 
The US business magazine estimated Swift earned $170m (£137m) between 1 June 
2015 and 1 June 2016, compared to Adele’s $80.5m.

Forbes notes that most of Swift’s earnings came from her 1989 world tour

, which sold more than $250m worth of tickets, while Adele is unusual in that 
the bulk of her revenue came from album sales. Adele’s most recent album, 25 – 
which was released in November 2015 – became the fastest selling album of all 
time in the UK, selling 800,307 copies in its first week. In the US, it became 
the first album to sell more than 3m copies in a week, with 3.38m sales within 
seven days of release, and was the best selling album of 2015.

While Beyoncé seems low on the list, in fifth place, with $54m, she is likely 
to be higher next year, when sales from herFormation world tour

 are taken into account.

Touring is the biggest generator of income for artists these days, and it’s 
noticeable that last year’s highest earner,Katy Perry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/katy-perry>, has slipped to sixth place. In 
2015, her Prismatic world tour sent her to the top by generating $135m. This 
year, without that cash machine, she earned $41m.

The bottom four of the top 10, however, did not have to crisscross the world 
to make money. Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, Shania Twain and Celine Dion all 
took on lucrative residencies in Las Vegas, wherecasino owners shell out huge 
sums for marquee acts

 to draw in gamblers.

Forbes said the figures were calculated using information from Pollstar, which 
tracks tour revenues, Nielsen, which measures music sales, Recording Industry 
Association of America, as well as interviews with those involved in the inner 
workings of business.

1. Taylor Swift <https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift> – $170m
