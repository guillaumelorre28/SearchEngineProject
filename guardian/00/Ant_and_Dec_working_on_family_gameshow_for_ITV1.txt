Anthony McPartlin <https://www.theguardian.com/media/anthonymcpartlin> and 
Declan Donnelly are developing a new family based gameshow for ITV1.

"Loosely it'll be us and two families competing," said McPartlin. "We love the 
Britain's Got Talent process, we love interacting and responding with the 
public, it's just good fun. There are lots of shows out there that don't 
feature that family dynamic anymore."

He added that it was not just about the traditional nuclear family with 2.4 
children but the "modern British family" that was fully representative of the 
ITV audience.

"It's good fun, and nice to develop something new. We can't wait for it to 
start," McPartlin said.

The new show is expected to air on ITV1 in the spring next year.

Donnelly added: "It is a little bit different and a little bit more formatted 
[than Saturday Night Takeaway]."

He said the pitch for their BBC1 show Friends Like These, which aired in 2000, 
had been that "friends were the new family". "We feel the family has returned a 
bit – that family is the new family."
