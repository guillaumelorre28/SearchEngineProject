I Am The Black Gold of the Sun was originally recorded in 1971 on Rotary 
Connection's classic psychedelic soul LP, Hey Love. Featuring Minnie Riperton's 
soaring vocals over Charles Stepney's epic symphonic production, it is one of 
those perfectly realised numbers you don't want to mess with ... unless you're 
Masters At Work.

NYC house DJs Kenny "Dope" Gonzalez and "Little" Louie Vega formed their 
Nuyorican Soul project with musicians from the Salsoul Orchestra, and guests 
such as Tito Puente, George Benson and Roy Ayers. The version of Black Gold 
they produced is a tight, club-ready proposition, beefing up the drums under 
Jocelyn Brown's vocals. When London's 4hero team were brought on board to remix 
the track, it was one of those moments that joins the dots between generations. 
The first four minutes retain the soulful feeling – until the double-time 
drum'n'bass fill kicks in and lifts it to a new dimension.
