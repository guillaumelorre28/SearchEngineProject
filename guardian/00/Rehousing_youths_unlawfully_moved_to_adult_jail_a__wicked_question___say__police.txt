One of Victoria’s top cops says deciding where to house young offenders is a 
“wicked” conundrum, after a court ruled it was illegal to send teenagers to an 
adult prison.

A group of youths will spend Christmas in Victoria’s maximum security adult 
jail,despite a court ruling their transfer to Barwon prison following riots in 
a youth detention centre was illegal

, because the government has said it has nowhere else to put them.

The teens were transferred in November

 after trashing the Parkville and Malmsbury youth detention centres during 
riots.

Victoria <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> police deputy 
commissioner Shane Patton acknowledged it was a difficult situation on Thursday.

“I would say that Parkville [youth justice centre] was trashed by youths who 
were there,” Patton told 3AW. “So where do you put them?

“They need to be housed so that they are safe and their human rights are 
protected, but the community needs to be protected as well, and the staff 
working there. This is probably best described as a really wicked question.”

Victorian supreme court judge Greg Garde on Wednesday ruled the state 
government’s decision to transfer youths to the Grevillea unit at Barwon prison 
“failed to give proper consideration to their human rights”.

He initially ordered their almost immediate release, but later relented when 
government lawyers claimed there was no alternative secure accommodation 
available.

A stay has been placed on their transfer out of Barwon prison until 28 
December.
