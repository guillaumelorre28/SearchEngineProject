tiggers is their versatility, clearly.

cathkidston.com

 <http://www.cathkidston.com/disney/disney-viewall/list?ctry=GB>Part of the 
lovely range produced by Cath Kidston in association with a certain 
golden-coloured bear (hope he’s holding out for a good slice of any profits, or 
at least crates and crates of honey), this sweet baby or toddler’s tray has 
three spaces for food, one for a cup and one for a sticky, honey-coated spoon.
