Before Iggy Pop <https://www.theguardian.com/music/iggy-pop> became a 
spokesman for visible sinews and betraying everything he used to stand for in 
exchange for money, he was widely credited with popularising the stagedive, a 
manoeuvre that came to encapsulate punk rock. Inevitably, the following decades 
saw the entropy of familiarity set in; stagediving creakily joined guitar 
demolition, night-time sunglasses and trousers so snug it looked as if someone 
had thrown paint in an aardvark's face in the lexicon of cliched onstage 
peacockery. Stagediving became boring. Expected. Managerially encouraged. The 
very things it once railed against.

When dinky rhymesmith Labrinth <https://www.theguardian.com/music/labrinth> 
bowled onstage at the University Of Kent's Summer Ball last month, he had no 
intention of becoming one of stagediving's saviours. In fact, he probably 
foresaw a gig much like any other: bass, beats, bantz. When he hurled himself 
into the arms of his expectant crowd he presumably expected to glide atop the 
ocean of palms like a silken hanky, allowing lucky folks to clutch a decent 
fistful of his arse before depositing him back on stage with the delicacy of a 
Jenga grand master. Instead, 50 students were flattened in a resounding domino 
effect of fail. It was wondrous.

It was also redolent of an incident in May in which R&B hormone-hose Miguel 
was similarly overcome with the urge to commit bystander facepain. His 
stagedive at the Billboard Music Awards was more of an airborne 
scissor-legdrop, a cross between ballet, niche pornography and Mad Max Beyond 
Thunderdome. It was if he was trying to kick God in both his testes, one nut 
per foot. A poor fan's head paid for his hubris, pinned between white-suited 
thigh and studiously polished floor. The victim is, unsurprisingly, suing him.

Miguel's manager had apparently advised against the dive before the show, and 
probably had nasal soulster Akon in mind when he did so. In February,Akon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> was notified that an ex-fan, into whom 
he'd imprinted the outline of his arse in 2009 during a dive, was seeking 
compensation. That same month, papers seeking monetary reparations also plopped 
through the letterbox of rapper Rick Ross, citing an incident in which he 
"negligently or wantonly leaped into the overcrowded mass of concertgoers". 
Rick Ross isn't a small man: think the pre-credits sequence of Raiders Of The 
Lost Ark, plus bling and a bushy beard. It's easy to see why the litigant's 
spine might have objected, compacted, as it was, like a crap, bony accordion.

Not since Metallic KO has live music been so dangerous. For the princely sum 
of a concert ticket you might witness something spectacularly funny that no 
grainy clip on YouTube will ever be able to replicate. Or, your face might be 
kicked out through the back of your hair by a rapper inflated to full-body 
Priapism with Self-ZOMG. It's a gamble. An experience. But to be part of it you 
have to be there. And live music needs all the help it can get.
