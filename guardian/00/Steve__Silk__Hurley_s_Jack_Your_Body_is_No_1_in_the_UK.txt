While Farley "Jackmaster" Funk's Love Can't Turn Around had climbed to No 10 
in 1986, it was in 1987 that dance stormed the charts. Steve "Silk" Hurley's 
Jack Your Body was the first to hit No 1. It arrived with no promotion, a video 
that was cut from old black and white films and barely any lyrics. The 
similarly anonymous Pump Up the Volume by M/A/R/R/S also charted at No 1 on 27 
September â€“ one of the first singles to exploit the possibilities of sampling. 
Also among 1987's dance hits were Frankie Knuckles's Your Love and Coldcut's 
Say Kids What Time is It.
