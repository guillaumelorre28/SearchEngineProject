Toyota was established in 1937 by Kiichiro Toyoda as a spin-off from his 
father's weaving company. At the time the city was known as Koromo, but changed 
its name toToyota <https://www.theguardian.com/business/toyota> in 1959 to 
reflect the carmaker's growing wealth and influence.

The spelling of the family name, Toyoda, and that of the city's name differs 
because the latter is thought to be more fortuitous: the katakana phonetic text 
for Toyoda comprises 10 strokes, while Toyota has eight, a number associated 
with luck and prosperity.

Last year Toyota ended the 77-year reign of General Motors as the world's 
biggest carmaker in terms of sales, selling 8.97m vehicles worldwide compared 
with GM's 8.36m. It employs more than 300,000 people, 70,000 of them inJapan

In January 2009 the firm looked again to its founders to lift its flagging 
fortunes, announcing thatAkio Toyoda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/akio-toyoda>, Kiichiro's grandson, would 
replace Katsuaki Watanabe as president in June 2009.

Akio, a former engineer who has long been talked about as a future leader, was 
the first member of the founding family to head Toyota since his uncle, 
Tatsuro, stepped down in 1995; Akio's father, Shoichiro, ran Toyota throughout 
most of the 80s and into the early 90s.
