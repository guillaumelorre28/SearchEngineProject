Third seed Lleyton Hewitt survived a hip-injury and a dramatic fightback by 
David Nalbandian to win 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 3-6, 10-8 and reach the semi-finals for 
the first time.

Hewitt, who needed the trainer after the fourth set, held on grimly to win in 
four hours and five minutes to wild cheers from a Rod Laver Arena crowd on 
Australia Day.

In the semi-finals, Hewitt will face Andy Roddick, whose stroll through the 
tournament continued today when Nikolay Davydenko was forced to retire from 
their quarter-final.

Roddick was two sets to love and 4-1 ahead when Davydenko indicated he was 
unable to continue in the stifling heat in Melbourne.

The Russian had received treatment on court during the second set, using an 
inhaler and wearing an ice vest during the change of ends as he seemingly 
struggled to catch his breath.

He surprisingly managed to break Roddick's serve on the resumption but 
eventually lost the set 7-5 and decided enough was enough after going two 
breaks down in the third set.

Davydenko had beaten Britain's seventh seed Tim Henman in the third round and 
Guillermo Canas in the last 16, but admitted afterwards he may have been unable 
to continue if his match with Canas had gone into a fourth set.

"It's unfortunate it had to end that way," said No2 seed Roddick, who has lost 
just one set, against Britain's Greg Rusedski, on his march to the last four 
and spent just over seven and a half hours on court.

"But I'm happy to be through to the semi-finals and hopefully my best tennis 
is ahead of me."
