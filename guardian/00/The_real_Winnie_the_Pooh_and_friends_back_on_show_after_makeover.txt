Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga and Tigger look as good 
as new and are ready to go back on display after more than a year of 
much-needed repairs by a textile conservator.

The toys, which belonged to Christopher Robin Milne when he was a boy, are 
back on show from Wednesday at theNew York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> public library, where they have 
resided since 1987.

Christopher Robin received the toys in the 1920s from his father, the author 
AA Milne <https://www.theguardian.com/books/aa-milne>, who based the 
Winnie-the-Pooh children’s stories on the stuffed animals.

“Being ever mindful of their care and condition, and given recent advances in 
textile conservation techniques, we decided that the time was right to 
undertake restorative work on these treasures,” the library’s curator, Michael 
Inman, said in a statement.

“The dolls have been not only cleaned, repaired and stabilised, thereby 
ensuring their continued survival, but also returned to a state that is in many 
ways closer to how they appeared when they were in the possession of the Milne 
family.”

Christopher Robin first called the stuffed bear Edward Bear. He later renamed 
him, combining two names: Winnie,for a real black bear at the London zoo

 that had once served as a military mascot in Winnipeg, Canada, and Pooh for a 
pet swan.

Pooh will be 95 on 21 August. The toys were donated to the library by Milne’s 
publisher.
