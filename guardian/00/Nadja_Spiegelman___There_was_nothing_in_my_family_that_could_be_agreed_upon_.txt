Nadja Spiegelman is the 29-year-old daughter of Maus creator Art Spiegelman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/art-spiegelman> and New Yorker art director 
Françoise Mouly. Her extraordinary memoir,I’m Supposed to Protect You From All 
This, traces her maternal line back four generations and explores the 
fallibility of memory.

What prompted you to write about the unreliability of memory?
It was always something I was conscious of growing up. We spent so much time 
as a family fighting over our differing memories, from the minute details of 
what had happened during an argument the weekend before to the grander 
narrative that shaped our lives together. To see that play out between my 
mother and my grandmother’s memories was fascinating. One of my professors in 
college said that we must only write things that we are 100% certain are true. 
But when I began thinking about my family it just seemed like such an 
impossible task – there was nothing that could be agreed upon as true.

Your memoir is also a fascinating study of how patterns of behaviour are 
repeated by one generation after another…
I think in a lot of cultures there’s this psychological idea of the impacted 
family secret that keeps getting played out generation after generation until 
it’s suddenly revealed, and then future generations can be freed from it. 
That’s something that speaks to me. I had a strong desire to understand where 
my mother had come from and what she’d been like as a girl – and that really 
helped illuminate and lighten our relationship.

Your father documented his relationship with his own father in the Pulitzer 
prize-winning graphic novelMaus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/fiction.art>. Were you conscious 
of his fame growing up?
I was incredibly conscious of it in the sense that I felt that whatever I did 
with my life – whether it was artistic or not – would get compared to my 
father’s work. For a long time I didn’t want people to know who my father was, 
I didn’t want to be seen as his daughter. I was afraid that the things I 
achieved or the relationships I made would be somehow less authentic. In 
writing this book I found a way to reconcile both identities, and to 
acknowledge that my father’s book is part of what has shaped who I am.

Did being a character in Maus make you more aware of how you were portraying 
others in your memoir?
I’d like to think so, yes. The few times I did appear in my father’s work I 
felt very strongly as if something had been taken away from me. I think in some 
ways it made me very conscious of what it meant to write about someone else and 
in some ways it made me much more blind to it.

In what way blind?
Because I grew up with this idea that of course my grandparents were in a 
book, of course I could appear in a book. It seemed like a natural process to 
have people appear in your work.

How did your mother and grandmother react to your book?
The act of telling these stories changed our relationship. It eased things 
with my mother. But it wasn’t easy for her and my grandmother to see themselves 
represented through my work. They’re both self-made, powerful women who have 
their own storytelling force. 

Your father hardly features at all in your memoir…
That is very intentional. I was more interested in following one straight 
matrilineal line and having the very subjective stories resonate with each 
other.

If your memoir was turned into a movie, who would you like to play the part of 
you?
It would be very interesting to have my mother try to play the part of me and 
see what happens.

You grew up in a family of storytellers, but which authors most influenced 
your own writing?
I read almost exclusively fiction. I really love James Baldwin, Elena Ferrante,
Elizabeth Strout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/elizabeth-strout-i-dont-want-to-write-melodrama-interview>
,Karen Russell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/08/swamplandia-karen-russell-review>
. In nonfiction, I very much admireRebecca Solnit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/07/faraway-nearby-rebecca-solnit-review>
.

What are you reading now? And what’s next on your reading list?
I’m reading The Shipping News by Annie Proulx 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/annie-proulx>, and I’m loving it. Next, I 
want to readBird By Bird 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bird-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1479412629&sr=1-1&keywords=bird+by+bird>
by Anne Lamott, andHousekeeping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/22/100-best-novels-92-housekeeping-marilynne-robinson>
 by Marilynne Robinson.

You’ve obviously grown up around a lot of famous authors. But which writers – 
dead or alive – would you have at your fantasy dinner party?
Joan Didion, Oscar Wilde, George Eliot and George Saunders.

And which authors would you most like to be friends with?
There are so many! I think it’s difficult not to have a literary crush on 
Zadie Smith, especially when you see her eloquence and elegance in person. Also 
Annie Proulx, Karen Russell andMavis Gallant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/18/mavis-gallant> – I would have 
loved to have been friends with her.
