the Swiss Alps

 has risen to four after a man died from his injuries, police said on Sunday.

The man was part of the group hit by an avalanche on Saturday in an area of 
the Swiss Alps known as Death Valley.

Two women and two men died while a fifth skier was wounded. A sixth member of 
the group was not swept away and escaped unharmed.

All of those involved were either 51 or 52 years old and from the Milan region.

They were skiing cross-country near a guesthouse in the Great Saint Bernard 
Pass, not far from the Italian border, when a massive sheet of snow dislodged 
and swept them away.

The accident happened at an altitude of around 2,300 metres. Poor weather 
conditions and thick fog complicated the rescue operation.

Rescuers managed to locate the skiers, who were all carrying avalanche victim 
detectors. Some were buried under as much as 2.5 metres (8ft) of snow.

Avalanches <https://www.theguardian.com/world/avalanches> are taking a heavy 
toll in the Swiss Alps this winter season, killing at least 25 people so far, 
including Saturdayâ€™s deaths.
