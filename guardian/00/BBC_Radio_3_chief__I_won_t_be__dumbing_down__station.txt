The incoming controller of Radio 3 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-3> 
has insisted he will not “dumb down” the highbrow BBC station in response to 
tumbling listener figures.

In the latest figures from industry body Rajar in July, the classical music 
station saw its audience shrink by 120,000 year on year to 1.88 million, 
falling behind digital-onlyRadio <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> 6 
Music for the first time.

Alan Davey <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-davey>, who takes over as 
controller in January, rejected suggestions that the solution was to follow the 
more popular Classic FM by concentrating on more accessible music.

He said he will continue to offer “complex culture” - such as operas by 
avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen - but will seek to provide audiences 
with the context that will help them understand it.

Mr Davey, who is chief executive of Arts Council England, told BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s one 
quarter’s listening figures we are talking about. We don’t yet have a trend.

“I will be addressing it by doing what Radio 3 does best – offering complex 
culture, arts and ideas within the reach of lots of people.

“That’s what the original Third Programme did beautifully, but what the 
original Third Programme didn’t do was offer people context, was offer people a 
way of approaching the complex culture that’s offered.”

Asked if his arrival meant Radio 3 becoming more like Classic FM, Davey 
responded: “It does not. If you look at what I’ve done at the Arts Council, 
it’s not been about dumbing down, it’s about wising up.

“It’s about putting on Stockhausen’s Mittwoch aus Licht in a way that’s 
intelligent and explains it, and that got a thrilled audience in Birmingham.

“If you do complex culture properly, it makes sense to people.”
