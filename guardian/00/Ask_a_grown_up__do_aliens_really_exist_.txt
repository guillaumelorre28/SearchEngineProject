At the moment we do not know whether there are such things as aliens. We read 
about them in stories and watch them on television and at the cinema, but 
all of these are made up – they are not real. Aliens may exist, but until we 
have seen them or heard from them or found some clues that they really exist 
then we cannot say for sure.

What we do know is that there are probably millions of planets out there in 
space – well beyond our solar system – and that some may support forms of life. 
Unfortunately, it will be many centuries before we are able to travel to these 
planets, so for now we must just use telescopes to look at them.

Hopefully in a few years we will have new, powerful and very advanced 
technology – a bit like theHubble space telescope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/hubble-space-telescope> – that will be 
able to detect any clues of alien life that may be out there.
