McCarthy was one of four players ruled out of the game at the Ernst Happel 
Stadium through injury when O’Neill confirmed his squad on Monday evening, 
along with the Burnley defender Stephen Ward, Derby’s Cyrus Christie and the 
Reading midfielder Stephen Quinn.

McCarthy played for his country in the victories over both Georgia and Moldova 
last month after recovering from groin surgery but returned to Merseyside to 
find Koeman less than impressed.

He and O’Neill have since traded blows over the player with the Republic 
manager insisting he has always had the player’s welfare in mind.

The Sunderland defender John O’Shea is one of those who will be assessed as he 
fights his way back from a hamstring injury.

Christie had earlier revealed that he faces at least three months on the 
sidelines after breaking a bone in his right foot during Derby’s 3-2 
Championship win at Wolves on Saturday.

The Republic are currently level on points with the group leaders, Serbia, 
after winning two and drawing the other of their opening three qualifiers.
