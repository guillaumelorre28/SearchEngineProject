Victorian students have received their Atar results five days early because of 
a technical glitch.

Hordes of students and parents took to social media on Wednesday night to post 
that the results had been sent early. Rankings were not due to be released 
until 7am on Monday.

“My daughter got her ATAR results via text tonight, it’s not supposed to come 
out til the 12th,” one woman tweeted.

A student posted: “What’s going on? I’m too scared to see my results.”

Early on Thursday morning the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority 
and the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre said 2,075 Victorian certificate 
of education students had received the early SMS results and both the VCE 
result and the Atar were correct.

In a brief statement the education minister, James Merlino, said it was not 
known why the results had been sent out early. “Clearly a significant error has 
been made and a full investigation will be carried out to get to the bottom of 
this,” he said.

VTac and the VCAA will be contacting schools and each of the students affected 
to confirm the accuracy of the information and provide further support.
