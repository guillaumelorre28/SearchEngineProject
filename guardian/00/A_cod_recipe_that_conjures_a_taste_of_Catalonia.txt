This is about a home from home. I learned to make this dish while in Spain 
recovering from an illness, and writing my book. I had fallen ill while skiing, 
and so the writing trip I’d planned to Spain subsequently became a 
convalescence.

It was an important moment in my life. Until then, I’d always been extremely 
healthy, and so getting double vision and high blood pressure made me suddenly 
reconsider what I was eating, and how I could make myself better. I had given 
up meat prior to that, which is the simplest way to change your diet, because 
it makes you find other things to fill your plate with, and they tend to be 
healthier. I believe diversity matters. Including as many varieties of fruit, 
veg, nuts, seeds and dairy as possible is really important. So, the Spanish 
diet was wonderful.

It was pure serendipity. As I was in Barcelona, I was talking to researchers 
who were on the brink of finishing the largest study of the Mediterranean diet 
that had been done up to then – the five-year longPredimed diet 
<http://www.predimed.es/> study. They compared the high-fat Mediterranean diet 
(lots of nuts and olive oil, the occasional piece of meat without worrying 
whether it’s fatty or not) and the low-fat English-style diet (avoid dairy and 
fatty cuts of meat, use only low-fat spreads). They found that it makes a big 
difference. Deaths, cancer, strokes and diabetes were a third less common in 
the Mediterranean group. It went against all the prevailing information I’d had 
up to that point. Suddenly I became a big fan of olive oil and gave up the 
whole idea of low‑fat dairy and spreads.

So Spain was the perfect place for me to be at the time, and this dish sums up 
that whole experience and everything that is so good about the Mediterranean 
diet in a very simple way. It’s delicious, easy to make and it encourages 
microbial diversity, plus it is designed to be flexible depending on your 
fridge contents.

The dish has the rich colours of all the beautiful Spanish produce: peppers, 
aubergines, artichokes, leeks, onions and garlic. And it has the fish. Fresh 
cod cooked just right is pretty hard to beat. You don’t need anything with it, 
although sometimes I do it with wild rice. Or a tomato salad on the side.

I have managed to go back to Barcelona every year since. I have Spanish 
friends now, so I keep learning. I love the fact that even if they buy a simple 
gazpacho soup from the shop, they’ll spend five minutes cutting up lots of 
fresh veg to put on top – a bit of garlic, a bit of onion, some peppers, a few 
tiny tomatoes … There’s constantly fresh fruit and veg being used, and so much 
care is taken. In Britain, you wouldn’t try to add to something simple, whereas 
in Spain, they do that naturally. Seek out things that are colourful and look 
good on your plate.

Catalan cod

Serves 2 
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 onion, chopped
1 green pepper, deseeded, finely sliced
1 red pepper, deseeded, finely sliced
1 courgette, chopped

1 tsp paprika
A handful of fresh basil, torn

2 large cod steaks
1 tbsp lemon juice

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put 1 tbsp of the olive oil into a

about 15‑20 minutes, depending on the size of the cod.
