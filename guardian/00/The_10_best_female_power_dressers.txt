Margaret Thatcher

Thatcher, Thatcher, style limelight-snatcher. The former PM cleverly refined 
her clothing to reflect her rising power. The pussycat bows of her early career 
were ditched. She stopped wearing hats, seen as too middle class, to appeal to 
the widest possible demographic. Instead, she came to favour tailored suits 
with matching handbags and low Ferragamo heels – ideal for state functions and 
the televising of Parliament. She could adapt this look for different 
locations: blue for Conservative party conferences, adding fur in Russia and 
often incorporating the colour of the national flag of the country she was 
visiting. She enlisted Aquascutum director Margaret King as her fashion adviser 
and kept files on what she wore when, with outfits named “Reagan Navy” or 
“Election ’87”.

One shudders to think how many cans of Elnett they got through on the set of 
1988 yuppie fableWorking Girl. When her scheming Wall Street stockbroker boss 
Sigourney Weaver broke her leg skiing (how 80s), Melanie Griffith’s ambitious 
Staten Island-raised secretary came into her own. After all, she had “a head 
for business and a bod for sin”. Griffith was Oscar-nominated and won a Golden 
Globe for her career-defining performance but it’s her Cinderella-like makeover 
– going from leather blousons, brassy jewellery and candyfloss mullet to 
sensible bob, slinky frocks and Armani power suits – that sticks in the memory.

Anna Wintour

“Nuclear Wintour”, the notoriously aloof editor-in-chief of American Vogue and 
unofficial mayoress of New York, is the most powerful woman in fashion. Her 
understated minimalist look reflects that lofty status. As a front-row fixture, 
her every stitch gets scrutinised but the London-born 64-year-old knows exactly 
what suits her and sticks to it: a shift dress, tweed suit, kitten-heeled 
Manolo Blahniks, Peta-infuriating fur, chunky necklace, twice daily blow-dry of 
her perfectly polished, blunt-edged pageboy bob (framing the face with steely 
conviction) and those omnipresent over-sized black shades. The devil might wear 
Prada but she looks goddess-like in it.

Alexis Carrington

The only things bigger than 1980s super-soap Dynasty’s ratings were the 
characters’ hair and shoulder pads. Linda Evans, who played leading lady 
Krystle Carrington, was naturally broad-shouldered so costume designer Nolan 
Miller decided to embrace them – and padded the other female cast members’ 
shoulders to match. Krystle’s nemesis and frequent catfight opponent was Joan 
Collins’s queen bitch Alexis, who became the show’s clothes-horse-in-chief: all 
nipped-in waists, batwing sleeves, fur coats, outsized diamante jewellery and 
red lip gloss. It was the epitome of capitalist excess and a global audience of 
250 million lapped it up. Well, until everyone started getting amnesia and that 
massacre at Prince Michael of Moldavia’s wedding.

Madonna

If Bowie is the chameleon of pop, Madonna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> Louise Ciccone is music’s mistress 
of disguise, constantly reinventing her image over the course of her 32-year 
career. When she arrived in the 80s, her unique style – be it a bridal dress, 
thrift-shop punk, Marilyn Monroe gown, religious iconography or bra and bangles 
– blended confidence, power and femininity. This reached its apex with her 
power suit in the David Fincher-directedExpress Yourself video, wide-legged 
trousers adding elegance to her tailored jacket. Later came the infamous Jean 
Paul Gaultier cone bra, disco leotards, corsets, military and cowgirl 
ensembles. Don’t go for second best, baby.

Victoria Beckham

She might be half of one of showbiz’s biggest power couples but the artist 
formerly known as Posh Spice struggled sartorially when she first moved to Los 
Angeles in 2007. Goldenballs had signed for LA Galaxy so the Beckham clan upped 
sticks, but Queen Wag Victoria was just too glossy, groomed and 
high-maintenance. Her body-hugging frocks, five-inch stilettos, statement 
handbags and perma-pout just didn’t look right on the studiedly laidback, 
expensively dressed-down west coast. She nailed it eventually, of course. Now, 
as a surprisingly successful fashion designer with an eponymous label, she’s 
helping a whole new generation of women to power dress.

Stella Gibson

Like Helen Mirren as Prime Suspect’s Jane Tennison before her, Gillian 
Anderson’s icily enigmatic cop from psychosexual TV crime thrillerThe Fall 
reminded us of the power of the silk shirt: white or cream, tailored fit, a few 
buttons undone, tucked into a black pencil skirt or subtly high-end grey suit. 
Accessorised with carefully coiffed hair, stilettos and quiet confidence, DSI 
Gibson ran rings around her mostly male colleagues but couldn’t quite catch 
Belfast’s best-looking serial killer Paul Spector (played by Jamie Dornan). 
She’s back soon for another go on BBC2 and retailers will be hoping those silk 
shirts are too – they reported a spike in sales when the first series aired.

Princess Diana

The Princess of Wales famously couldn’t wear high heels while married to 
Prince Charles – she was marginally taller than him but took great pains to 
look like she wasn’t. As the 80s poster princess for Sloanes and wannabe 
Sloanes, she inadvertently started a trend for lower footwear. As their 
marriage disintegrated, the gloves came off and Diana started towering over 
Charles in stilettos. As the world’s most photographed woman, her style evolved 
from demure, dutiful wife to glamorous global celebrity. Post-divorce, she was 
free to venture further into the fashion world, gracing catwalk shows and the 
cover ofVogue – all while working ye olde “check out what you’re missing” look 
to perfection.

 Michelle Obama 
Michelle Obama

The most fashion-conscious first lady is a very modern sort of power dresser. 
She’s almost always seen in strong, structured outfits, yet doesn’t shy away 
from bold colours or graphic prints. Her wardrobe teams high-end designers such 
as Jason Wu, Michael Kors, Céline and Stella McCartney with more accessible 
pieces from J Crew or Target – usually finished off by a cardigan, kitten heels 
and kitschy brooch. Classy, confident and a fixture on world’s best-dressed 
lists, Obama has been a big sartorial influence on a generation of American 
women climbing the corporate career ladder. Her style-icon status has been 
compared to Jackie Kennedy’s and she’s only the second first lady to become a
Vogue cover star.

Cruella De Vil

“If she doesn’t scare you, no evil thing will…” Who could be more power-dressy 
than a super-rich heiress obsessed with making a fur coat out of puppy pelts? 
The antagonist of Dodie Smith’s 1956 novel,101 Dalmatians, sports 
black-and-white hair, a white mink cloak and tight satin gowns with clashing 
ropes of jewels. She also drinks ink, eats pepper and lives in a sinister 
Suffolk mansion, Hell Hall. Disney based its 1961 film version on Hollywood 
diva Tallulah Bankhead. In the 1996 live action movie, Glenn Close played her 
as a chainsmoking fashion magnate, heading the House of De Vil – all PVC, 
corsets, spiked heels, long nails and jewellery made from teeth and claws.
