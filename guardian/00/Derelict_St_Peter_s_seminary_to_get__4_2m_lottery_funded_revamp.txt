A ruined Roman Catholic seminary near Glasgow, hailed as a modernist 
masterpiece when it was built 50 years ago, has been rescued with a £4.2m 
lottery grant.

The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) announced that it was backing a project to 
convert St Peter’s and its surrounding woodland, near Cardross on the north 
bank of the Clyde, into an arts venue and tourist attraction.

The project will be overseen by the Glasgow-based environmental and public 
arts company NVA, which specialises in kinetic and light-based open-air 
installations. It has just opened its latest event,Hinterland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/scotland-blog/2016/mar/22/st-peters-seminary-its-ruins-remade-by-rippling-spectral-light>
, at St Peter’s to critical acclaim. The seminary will be renamed Hinterland.

NVA’s recent productions have included the ghost peloton 
<http://nva.org.uk/artwork/ghost-peloton-glasgow/>, with riders and bikes 
decked in custom-built LED suits; its Speed of Light events on Arthur’s seat in 
Edinburgh, in Salford and Yokohama, where runners were again fitted in LED 
suits; andIsland Drift <http://nva.org.uk/artwork/island-drift/>, which 
illuminated Loch Lomond and its islands.

St Peter’s was built in 1966 as a training centre for priests to a design by 
the architects Gillespie, Kidd and Coia, and immediately became known as one of 
Europe’s finest modernist buildings. Never entirely watertight, it was closed 
in 1980 and fell into ruins, its arches and walls covered in graffiti and 
battered by the elements.

The HLF said the grant – £3.806m from the lottery and £400,000 from the arts 
funding agency CreativeScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> – 
would allow key parts of the building to be restored and other sections 
protected against the weather to ensure the structure was safe for public 
performances and activities.

The triple-height chapel will be partially restored to create a 600-capacity 
venue while the former sacristy and crypt will be used for exhibitions. A path 
network, walled garden and bridges in the surrounding 104-acre estate – which 
includes the remnants of Kilmahew castle, which dates to the 15th century – 
will also be restored.

Angus Farquhar, creative director of NVA, said the money would allow the 
company to create a permanent arts centre of international value.

“After the overwhelming response to Hinterland, our first major animation of 
the site and the new name for Kilmahew/St Peter’s, we have real hope that our 
vision for progressive, socially focused art will connect strongly with people 
and together we will forge a new place for public art and its significance in 
the world.”

Lucy Casot, the HLF’s Scottish director, said the scheme “has the potential to 
save an internationally significant building, exploiting its commanding 
presence to produce an exceptional arts venue. Its transformed estate will 
become a natural haven for the local community to explore, enjoy and be proud 
of.”
