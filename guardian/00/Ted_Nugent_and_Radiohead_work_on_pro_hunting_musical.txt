Following Atoms for Peace – his collaboration with Flea of the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers – Thom Yorke is believed to have lined up an even more unlikely 
collaboration: Radiohead are suspected to be working with Ted Nugent on a 
musical adapatation of the children's bookWe're Going on a Bear Hunt

The US magazine Pool Flair reported that Nugent and Yorke had hit it off at a 
charity event recently, where the reputedly glum star told the US rocker that 
Radiohead often soundchecked with versions of his 70s hitsCat Scratch Fever

"Thom told Ted he was working on a musical based on a kids' book and the Nuge 
offered to help," a source told Pool Flair. "He went to Nuge's hunting ranch in 
Texas, and goddam if it didn't turn out he was a natural with a rifle and 
sights. That boy bagged him some game when he was there."

The pair worked on the music for We're Going on a Bear Hunt for three weeks 
late last year, and Yorke was apparently receptive to Nugent's suggested 
changes to the plot. "In the story, right, these kids go looking for this huge 
momma grizzly, and when they find it, they just run," the source said. "Nuge 
and Thom reckoned it would be more fun if the kids just pulled out some serious 
firepower and blew the damn bear away – then skinned it and brought the hide 
home to their folks. Nuge thought Thom would be pinko about it, but Thom 
thought it was hilarious."
