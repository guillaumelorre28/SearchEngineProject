Drum'n'bass <https://www.theguardian.com/music/drum-n-bass> and its 
near-cousin jungle had been bubbling under in clubs in Bristol and London for a 
few years. But for many people, Goldie's debut album, released on Pete Tong's 
FFRR label and blending the two genres with atmospheric strings and vocals, was 
the first exposure to the impossibly fast drum rolls and sub-bass frequencies 
that made it such an exciting diversion from the solid four-to-the-floor 120bpm 
that had characterised house music. Never mind that half of the audience who 
heard tracks such as Inner City Life for the first time couldn't quite work out 
how to dance to it (fast like hardcore or slow like reggae?).
