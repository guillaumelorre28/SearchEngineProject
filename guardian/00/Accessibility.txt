This site uses the same content management system as Guardian.co.uk, and 
shares several of that site's accessibility features.

Text resizing

This can be activated through the 'Text larger / smaller' links at the top of 
the page. When the text size reaches 20px a new wide layout is triggered 
ensuring that the layout is not compromised. (Please note, our text resizing 
feature is dependent on javascript being turned on.)

Where our text resizing feature is not available, you can achieve the same 
result independently by following these instructions:

• PC / Internet Explorer 6 From the top menu bar, select View and point to 
Text size

• PC / Internet Explorer 7 From the menu bar underneath the search field, 
select Page and point to Text size

• PC / other browsers Increase text size: Hold down the CTRL key and press + 
Decrease text size: Hold down the CTRL key and press -

• Mac / all browsers Increase text size: Hold down the Command key and press + 
Decrease text size: Hold down the Command key and press -
