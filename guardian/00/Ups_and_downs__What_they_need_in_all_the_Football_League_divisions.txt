Championship 

Hull City will be promoted to the Premier League if Watford lose at home 
against Blackburn and Crystal Palace draw at home to Leicester. Cardiff will 
become champions if they take at least a point at Burnley.

League One

Doncaster Rovers would return to the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> with a home victory in 
their penultimate game against Notts County if either Bournemouth or Brentford 
fail to win their games. Only victory at MK Dons could prolongScunthorpe's stay 
in League One. Survival is out of their hands, however, as wins for Colchester 
and Oldham would relegate the Iron.

League Two

A win over Northampton in their penultimate game would all but secure Port 
Vale's return to League One. Defeat to Dagenham & Redbridge would see Aldershot 
drop out of theFootball League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league>. Barnet could also be 
relegated if they lose to Wycombe and the three sides above them win.

Blue Square Bet Premier

Mansfield will be promoted if they beat Wrexham. If they lose, Kidderminster 
will be promoted with a win against Stockport. Stockport need a win to have a 
chance of avoiding relegation.Dan Matthews
