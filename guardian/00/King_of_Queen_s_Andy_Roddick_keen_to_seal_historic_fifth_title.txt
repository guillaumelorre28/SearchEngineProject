Andy Roddick <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-roddick> will try for a 
historic fifth Queen's Club title at the Aegon Championships in June.

The American will look to become the first player to achieve the feat at the 
tournament, having tasted success there already in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2007.

"Over the years I've had a lot of success at the Queen's Club. It has real 
tradition and I love the whole month in London," said Roddick.

"Queen's has the best grass courts in the world, they play perfectly and so 
the Aegon Championships is a great way to prepare for Wimbledon."

The 28-year-old, a three-times Wimbledon finalist, will be up against the 
likes of Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic at the Aegon Championships, which run 
from 6 to 12 June.
