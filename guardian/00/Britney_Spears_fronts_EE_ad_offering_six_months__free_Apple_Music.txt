have a bit of fun. Britney was the perfect choice with her red rubber catsuit 
and her world famous Oops I did It Again track. Timing-wise it was perfect for 
her as her new album is about to be released.”

Spears is currently in the headlines as she promotes her new album Glory, 
appearing on James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke this week and poised to guest at 
the MTV VMAs for the first time in nine years on Sunday.
