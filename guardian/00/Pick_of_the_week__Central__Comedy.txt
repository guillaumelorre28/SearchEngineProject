Andrew Lawrence Glee Club
Birmingham, Sat; Engine Sheds, Lincoln, Sat 
With his shark eyes, shambling gait and gravelly voice, Lawrence has a unique 
stage presence, and with hilariously oddball material to match.

Jeremy Hardy 
Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Sun; Norwich Playhouse, Fri 
Not so much a grumpy old man as a middle-aged man bristling with righteous 
indignation, Hardy is as full of fire and hilarity as ever.

Barry Cryer: Still Alive 
Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Fri 
A bona fide comedy legend after more than 50 years in the business, the I'm 
Sorry I Haven't A Clue star is accompanied by pianist Colin Sell.
