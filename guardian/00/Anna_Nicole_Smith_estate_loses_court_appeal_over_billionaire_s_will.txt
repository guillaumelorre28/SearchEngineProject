The Texan billionaire who married Anna Nicole Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/anna-nicole-smith> in the last year of his 
life never intended to leave her any part of his fortune, a federal appeals 
court has ruled.

The ninth US circuit court of appeals backed a Houston jury that said J Howard 
Marshall was mentally fit and under no undue pressure when he wrote a will 
leaving nearly all his $1.6bn (£1bn) estate to his son, E Pierce Marshall, and 
nothing to Smith.

Friday's ruling was the latest development in a 15-year battle. Smith, who 
died in 2008, claimed Marshall had promised her more than $300m

The battle between Smith and Marshall started in a Houston probate court and 
continued to the US supreme court, outliving the two combatants. It may reach 
the high court again.

Kent Richland, a lawyer for Smith's estate vowed to appeal against the latest 
ruling, possibly to the supreme court, on different issues than those it first 
considered.

"It really is a unique decision," Richland said. "We have to take it farther."

The younger Marshall's widow and two sons said they hoped the legal battle was 
close to ending. "Our only wish would be that Pierce were here to see his 
vindication," the family said in a statement.

The decision – if it is upheld – is bad news for Smith's ex-boyfriend Larry 
Birkhead and their three-year-old daughter, Dannielynn.

The child was named Smith's heir in 2008 after she died at the age of 39 of a 
drug overdose at a Florida hotel.

Birkhead and lawyer Howard K Stern were placed in charge of Smith's estate. 
Neither returned calls seeking comment.
