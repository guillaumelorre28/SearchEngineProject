The Guardian iPhone app <https://www.theguardian.com/iphone> is the best way 
to access our content on the move if you own an iPhone or iPod Touch. The app 
has been optimised for Apple's mobile devices and offers a range of features to 
help you stay in touch with theguardian.com content.

The app offers an offline mode which allows you to stay in touch even if you 
don't have a signal; easy access to audio and podcasts (including 'download for 
listening later'); elegant personalisation; a topic-based search engine; the 
ability to follow all your favourite Guardian authors and contributors, and 
superb picture galleries - all presented within an interface specifically 
designed for the iPhone and iPod Touch.

Virtually all recent content on theguardian.com is available using the app. It 
was built using the Open Platform's RSS feeds.
