Game of Thrones returns to the screens on Monday and to get you in the mood 
for some Westeros action we’ve got Arya Stark, aka Maisie Williams,playing a 
prank <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnQZFoNsJ68> on fans in a comic shop 
using hidden cameras by pretending to be a shop assistant called Lorraine. 
Meanwhile Robert Downey Jr visits the Eiffel Tower 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmV8vVIDA2c> for the premiere of Captain 
America: Civil War and reveals a light show spectacular to encourage team Iron 
Man. The action continues as Matt Damonreprises his role  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uLVIUuEfFY>as Jason Bourne in the latest 
action spy thriller from Paul Greengrass, which also stars Alicia Vikander and 
Tommy Lee Jones.

2016 has robbed us of some of the biggest names in showbiz and this week has 
been no exception. We have a funny, but very poignant, tribute to comedian, 
writer and director Victoria Wood in the clipSwim the Channel 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2poRHmFvLI> and we remember the musical 
genius of Prince with a film of him performing at a Super Bowl XLI Halftime 
Show in 2007during a storm <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NN3gsSf-Ys>, with 
a set that included Purple Rain.

To cheer you up a little, the Evian babies return 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWG3rtGoIlI> as surf dudes, we’ve got a fight 
between two diggers <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPj-SPD_NIg>, and we mark 
the Queen’s 90th birthday <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW5abat5NEU> with 
the clip of her “parachuting” into the 2012 Olympics. One Purple Rain over, one 
still going on …
