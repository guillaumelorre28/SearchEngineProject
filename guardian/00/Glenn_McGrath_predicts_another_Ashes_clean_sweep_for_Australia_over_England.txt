The former Australia fast-bowler Glenn McGrath has claimed that England will 
succumb to a 5–0 defeat in this summer's Ashes series, which begins in Cardiff 
tomorrow. McGrath made the same claim in 2005, before Australia lost a series 
in which he played 2–1.

McGrath believes Australia's recent performance in South Africa, where they 
won 2–1 after losing a home series to the Proteas, has stiffened the team's 
resolve.

"My prediction is it will be 5–0 to Australia," McGrath said. "I've got total 
confidence in the boys, especially watching the way they played in South Africa 
in the last Test series. I thought that would have given them a lot of 
confidence. They showed what they can do and the huge potential that they've 
got.

"If they can do the same here and maybe even improve in one or two areas they 
will do really well and probably win 5–0."

McGrath, who retired two years ago with 563 Test wickets, has been working 
with Australia's fast bowlers ahead of the Ashes series. He was among a number 
of experienced players who retired from Test cricket after Australia reclaimed 
the Ashes on home soil in 2006-07 – by winning 5–0.
