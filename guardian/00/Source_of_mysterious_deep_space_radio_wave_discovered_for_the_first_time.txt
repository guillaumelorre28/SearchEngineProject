A mysterious type of radio wave from deep space, discovered only a decade ago, 
has been traced to a precise source for the first time, astronomers said on 
Wednesday.

So-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) picked up in 2016 by a telescope in New 
Mexico likely emanated from a dwarf galaxy some 3bn light years from Earth, the 
scientists reported inthe journal Nature

.

FRBs flash only for an micro-instant, and can emit as much energy in a 
millisecond as the sun does in 10,000 years.

Exactly what causes these high-energy surges of long waves at the far end of 
the electromagnetic spectrum remains the subject of intense debate.

The new discovery will not settle the issue, but it definitively eliminates 
several theories that had been in the running, scientists said.

There have been 18 fast radio bursts registered since 2007, but only one – 
observed in 2012 at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, and dubbed FRB 
121102 – recurred numerous times.

That prompted a team of scientists led by Shami Chatterjee of Cornell 
University to prepare in case it happened again.

Will scientists ever prove the existence of dark matter?

The idea paid off: in 83 hours of observation over six months, the Karl G 
Jansky multi-antenna array of radio telescopes – more powerful that any to have 
spotted a FRB in the past – detected nine distinct pulses.

 The Sound of Fast Radio Burst FRB 121102 
“We now know that this particular burst comes from a dwarf galaxy more than 
3bn light years from Earth,” Chatterjee said in a statement.

The discovery does not answer the core question of what produces these strange 
emanations that long escaped the notice of professional stargazers.

“Still, even without a clear answer, the finding is a real game-changer,” said 
Heino Falcke, an astronomer at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands 
who was not involved in the research.

Until recently, many experts speculated that FRBs are produced by cataclysmic 
events such as stars exploding into supernovas, or neutron stars collapsing 
into black holes.

While it is possible that these one-off scenarios also produce such bursts, 
all of them are inconsistent with multiple pulses such as those generated by 
FRB 121102.

The new data also dispels another widely discussed possibility, explained 
Shriharsh Tendulkar, a scientist at McGill University in Montreal.

“Before we knew the distance to any FRBs, several proposed explanations for 
their origins said they could be coming from within, or near, our own Milky 
Way,” he said.

Such a close source can now be ruled out – at least in this case.

“It’s not something in our backyard,” said co-author Casey Law, an astronomer 
at the University of California in Berkeley.

That still leaves plenty of room for speculation.

One of the top candidates, the astronomers suggested, is a neutron star – 
possibly a type known as a magnetar – surrounded by material ejected by a 
supernova explosion.

A neutron star – small but extremely dense – is formed by the gravitational 
collapse of a star not quite massive enough to produce a black hole when it 
explodes.

A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field.
