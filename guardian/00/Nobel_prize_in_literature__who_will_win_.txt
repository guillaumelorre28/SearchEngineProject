This year's Nobel prize for literature - arguably (in fact, inarguably) the 
most prestigious literary award in existence,will be announced today at 1pm CET 
<http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2012/announcement.html>
 (that's midday in the UK). The announcement will be live-streamed from the 
Swedish academy, but for those of you who are at work/don't speak Swedish, 
we'll be live-blogging the announcement here. Meanwhile, though, in the absence 
of any actual news, let the speculation begin.

Haruki Murakami is favourite

 according to Ladbrokes at 6/4, but does he have the heft to take the 
laureateship? Is the academy more – or less – likely to favour Syrian author 
and perennial Nobel bridesmaid Adonis in light of the ongoing conflict in his 
country? William Trevor's and Alice Munro's odds have both shortened 
considerably in the last few days – signs of insider knowledge? Who knows? Not 
us, for certain: the books desk's track record on spotting Nobel winners is 
abysmal (so far, we've been right a grand total of never).

So, basically, we're hoping you can do better. Tell us: who's going to win?
