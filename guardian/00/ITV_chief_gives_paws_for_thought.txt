ITV has gone to the dogs, but in a good way, reports the Daily Telegraph. The 
broadcaster's chief executiveAdam Crozier flagged up Paul O'Grady's For the 
Love of Dogs – it's a ratings hit, don't you know – as a "favourite in our 
household". Let's hope he really does like it, and not just because it's on 
ITV, otherwise that would be a case of, er, the tail wagging the dog. Anyway, 
former Football Association man Crozier gave short shrift to a shareholder who 
complained that Crystal Palace's play-off with Watford was not on ITV. "You 
have my deepest commiseration for being a Crystal Palace supporter," replied 
Crozier.
