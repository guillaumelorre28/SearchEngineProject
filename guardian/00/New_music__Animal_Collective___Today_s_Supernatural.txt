during the first ever show on Animal Collective Radio, the dizzying Today's 
Supernatural is the first song to be taken from the quartet's ninth album, 
Centipede Hz. While the highlights of 2009's excellent Merriweather Post 
Pavilion felt spacious and airy, on first listen Today's Supernatural feels as 
if it's trying to cram in as many sonic niggles as humanly possible. The 
half-shouted vocals tumble over layers of gargling beats, eerie 
ghost-in-the-system sound effects and explosions of percussion. It is, quite 
frankly, a bit of a racket, but on second listen the chorus of "Come on, let, 
let, let, let, let, let it GO!" worms its way to the surface and a fairly 
straight-ahead rock song, complete with big, pounding piano chords, starts to 
emerge. There's even a lovely middle-eight section that strips away most of the 
sonic chatter and features lyrics about "good things like friends" that sounds 
almost celebratory.

â€¢ Today's Supernatural is released digitally tomorrow and Centipede Hz is 
released on September 3 via Domino
