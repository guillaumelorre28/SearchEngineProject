Afternoon summary

 * Owen Smith is set to challenge Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership in a 
head-to-head race following the decision by Angela Eagle to pull out. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-angela-eagle>
Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, said she would back Smith in the 
bid to lead the party after she attracted 72 nominations from MPs and MEPs, 18 
below Smith’s 90. Smith told the BBC a few minute ago that Eagle was a “star” 
and that he she would be “at [his] right hand” if he won the Labour leadership. 
 * Boris Johnson, the new foreign secretary, has brushed aside claims that he 
is a liar and that should apologise for offensive comments he has made in the 
past about foreign leaders in his first press conference as foreign secretary. 
Standing alongside John Kerry, the US secretary of state, Johnson faces 
particularly hostile questions from American journalists, one of whom said he 
had a history of lying and another of whom quoted unflattering things he had 
written about President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Johnson insisted that he was 
focusing now on the big issues he had to deal with as foreign secretary. He 
said: 
We can all spend an awfully long time going over lots of stuff that I’ve 
written in the last 30 years - all of which, in my view, have been taken out of 
context, but never mind. There are some serious issues before us today ....

I’m afraid that there is such a rich thesaurus now of things that I have said 
that have been, one way or another, through what alchemy I do not know, somehow 
misconstrued that it would really take me too long to engage in a full-blown 
itinerary or apology to all concerned. And I think most people who read these 
things, in their proper context, can see exactly what was intended.

 * Downing Street has insisted that the government remains committed to 
getting net migration below 100,000.The prime minister’s spokeswoman clarified 
the government’s stance afterAmber Rudd, the new home secretary, suggested this 
was no longer a target. Rudd told the BBC: 
The prime minister has said is that we must bring migration down to 
sustainable levels so that’s what is going to be my aim at the moment.

Pressed on whether the net migration target had changed, Rudd said: 

I’m going to stick to my comment which is about bringing it down to 
sustainable levels. That has to be the most important thing for the country. 
Immigration was a key factor in the Brexit campaign as net levels exceeded 
330,000 last year.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Asked if she had done a deal with Owen Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> about taking a job, Angela 
Eagle replied:

I’m supporting Owen. We are going to be in lockstep together arguing for an 
effective, unitedLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party 
doing its job as Her Majesty’s Opposition in opposing this government.

She also said that the gap between her and Smith in terms of nominations was 
“quite narrow” but that she did not think it was in Labour’s interests for the 
contest between Eagle and Smith to continue.

Eagle says she is withdrawing 'in best interests of Labour party' to let Smith 
challenge Corbyn

This is what Angela Eagle <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/angela-eagle> 
told the BBC about her decision to quit.

I want to thank my own supporters for the faith that they showed in me in this 
leadership election. We’ve finished the first day of nominations.Owen Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> has a lead, and I think that 
it’s in the best interests of the Labour party that we now come together so 
that we can have one candidate.

So I’m announcing tonight that I’m withdrawing from this race and supporting 
Owen. I would like to congratulate Owen on coming top in this race and then 
going on to take onJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>.

We have the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party at the 
moment that is not working. We’ve got a leader that does not have the 
confidence of his members of parliament and isn’t reaching out to the country.

We need to have a strong and united Labour party so that we can be a good 
opposition, take the fight to the Conservative government and heal our country. 
So I am announcing tonight that I will be supporting Owen in that endeavour 
with all of my enthusiasm and might.

And I would also like to say to the people outside watching this, if you are a 
supporter of the Labour party, if you want the Labour party to be an effective 
opposition who can take on the Tories and win, please go to the Labour party 
website, sign up as a registered supporter and join this fight. You have until 
5 o’clock tomorrow.

Angela Eagle 'set to make leadership contest statement'

Angela Eagle is set to make a statement, Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh reports.
Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) 
Angela Eagle <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/angela-eagle> set to make 
statement any minute...

<https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/755434472376528900> 
There are suspicions that she will announce she is pulling out from the Labour 
leadership <https://twitter.com/GuidoFawkes/status/755433787320889344>, 
allowing Owen Smith to take on Jeremy Corbyn, because Smith has more support 
amongst MPs. (See 5.04pm.)

nominatingAngela Eagle <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/angela-eagle> and 
Owen Smith, but my colleagueAnushka Asthana has a steer.
Anushka Asthana (@GuardianAnushka) 
Still waiting but if right Smith gets 90 nominations, of which 88 MPs, Eagle 
gets 72, of which 9 are MEPs... So pressure on Eagle.

Here are two tweets on Boris Johnson’s performance.

From Bloomberg’s Robert Hutton
Robert Hutton (@RobDotHutton) 
All the US questions to Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> are basically: You're a liar, how 
can we trust you?
His answer: It was all a long time ago.

<https://twitter.com/RobDotHutton/status/755423914831011840> 
Except it wasn’t a long time ago, Adam Bienkov from politics.co.uk points out.
Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) 
Boris Johnson under fire for past comments, repeatedly claims they “go back 30

his record of telling lies. (See 4.34pm.)

Q: [To Johnson] You have a history of misrepresentations and lies. Why should 
Kerry believe what you say?

Johnson says people are “more than welcome” to rake over what he has written 
over many years, but he wants to get on with the problems facing the world 
today. Most people paying their taxes would want that, he says.

Q: Is there any chance of prioritising the UK over countries already in the 
queue for a trade deal?

Kerry says that would be impossible. Until the UK leaves the EU, it is still 
part of the EU. He says he is working to make progress on TTIP. TTIP is even 
more important for Europe now than it was, he says. He says he wants to 
demythologise it. Regulations do not go downwards, he says. It won’t stop 
countries having strict standards, he says. He says there has not been enough 
pro-advocacy of its benefits. He accepts that people may have voted for Brexit 
because they felt they were not getting the benefits of globalisation. He says 
TTIP will help to ensure that people do benefit from globalisation.

He says in Europe people’s incomes and chances have been significantly 
improved by globalisation.

 * Kerry says TTIP will help people share in the benefits in globalisation. 
Johnson says he passionately agrees with this.

People on low wages have not felt the benefits of globalisation.

The answer to that is to invest in skills and to increase people’s 
productivity. We have to be more outward looking, more free-trading, he says.

 * Johnson says UK needs to become more outward-looking and more free-trading 
after Brexit. 
The press conference is over.

I will post a summary soon.

Q: Is the UK still going to be at the back of the queue for a trade deal?

Kerry says that the US trade representative has said that the US will talk 
about a trade deal with the US.

Johnson says it is impossible to enter into a trade deal while the UK is still 
in the EU.

Q: Amber Rudd has refused to commit the government to getting net migration 
below 100,000.

Johnson says Rudd is right not to commit to numbers, because you do not want 
to disappoint people.

But when the UK leaves the EU, it will be able able to exert controls.

And, as for the heat (mentioned by the questioner), we have some spare water 
cannon, he says.

Johnson jokes that apologising for all his past comments deemed offensive 
would take too long

Q: [To Johnson] You said President Obama disliked the UK because he was 
part-Kenyan. And you have likened Hillary Clinton to a sadistic nurse, and to 
Lady Macbeth. Do you take these comments back?

Johnson says he would like to repeat what he said earlier. There is a rich 
thesaurus of things he has said that have been misconstrued that it would take 
too long to apologise for them.

And people who read them in their context will see that he was misunderstood.

He says the current problems are more important than any obiter dicta from the 
past.

 * Johnson says that his past comments have been “misconstrued” - and that 
apologising for them all would take too long. 
Q: [To Kerry] Given what Johnson said during the EU referendum campaign, is he 
what the UK and the US needs?

Kerry says the subjects he is working on with Johnson have nothing to do with 
the EU referendum. He is confident that they will be able to work together.

On the referendum, he says the people have voted. We all respect democracy. He 
and President Obama wanted a different vote. But they respect the result.

He says he is “absolutely confident” that he can work with Johnson.

 * Kerry says Johnson’s EU referendum record will not stop them working 
together. 
 * He praises Johnson’s “considerable intellect and values”. Facebook

 * Owen Smith is set to challenge Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership in a 
head-to-head race following the decision by Angela Eagle to pull out. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-angela-eagle>
Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, said she would back Smith in the 
bid to lead the party after she attracted 72 nominations from MPs and MEPs, 18 
below Smith’s 90. Smith told the BBC a few minute ago that Eagle was a “star” 
and that he she would be “at [his] right hand” if he won the Labour leadership. 
 * Boris Johnson, the new foreign secretary, has brushed aside claims that he 
is a liar and that should apologise for offensive comments he has made in the 
past about foreign leaders in his first press conference as foreign secretary. 
Standing alongside John Kerry, the US secretary of state, Johnson faces 
particularly hostile questions from American journalists, one of whom said he 
had a history of lying and another of whom quoted unflattering things he had 
written about President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Johnson insisted that he was 
focusing now on the big issues he had to deal with as foreign secretary. He 
said: 
We can all spend an awfully long time going over lots of stuff that I’ve 
written in the last 30 years - all of which, in my view, have been taken out of 
context, but never mind. There are some serious issues before us today ....

I’m afraid that there is such a rich thesaurus now of things that I have said 
that have been, one way or another, through what alchemy I do not know, somehow 
misconstrued that it would really take me too long to engage in a full-blown 
itinerary or apology to all concerned. And I think most people who read these 
things, in their proper context, can see exactly what was intended.

 * Downing Street has insisted that the government remains committed to 
getting net migration below 100,000.The prime minister’s spokeswoman clarified 
the government’s stance afterAmber Rudd, the new home secretary, suggested this 
was no longer a target. Rudd told the BBC: 
The prime minister has said is that we must bring migration down to 
sustainable levels so that’s what is going to be my aim at the moment.

Pressed on whether the net migration target had changed, Rudd said: 

I’m going to stick to my comment which is about bringing it down to 
sustainable levels. That has to be the most important thing for the country. 
Immigration was a key factor in the Brexit campaign as net levels exceeded 
330,000 last year.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Asked if she had done a deal with Owen Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> about taking a job, Angela 
Eagle replied:

I’m supporting Owen. We are going to be in lockstep together arguing for an 
effective, unitedLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party 
doing its job as Her Majesty’s Opposition in opposing this government.

She also said that the gap between her and Smith in terms of nominations was 
“quite narrow” but that she did not think it was in Labour’s interests for the 
contest between Eagle and Smith to continue.
 
This is what Angela Eagle <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/angela-eagle> 
told the BBC about her decision to quit.

I want to thank my own supporters for the faith that they showed in me in this 
leadership election. We’ve finished the first day of nominations.Owen Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> has a lead, and I think that 
it’s in the best interests of the Labour party that we now come together so 
that we can have one candidate.

So I’m announcing tonight that I’m withdrawing from this race and supporting 
Owen. I would like to congratulate Owen on coming top in this race and then 
going on to take onJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>.

We have the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party at the 
moment that is not working. We’ve got a leader that does not have the 
confidence of his members of parliament and isn’t reaching out to the country.

We need to have a strong and united Labour party so that we can be a good 
opposition, take the fight to the Conservative government and heal our country. 
So I am announcing tonight that I will be supporting Owen in that endeavour 
with all of my enthusiasm and might.

And I would also like to say to the people outside watching this, if you are a 
supporter of the Labour party, if you want the Labour party to be an effective 
opposition who can take on the Tories and win, please go to the Labour party 
website, sign up as a registered supporter and join this fight. You have until 
5 o’clock tomorrow.

There are suspicions that she will announce she is pulling out from the Labour 
leadership <https://twitter.com/GuidoFawkes/status/755433787320889344>, 
allowing Owen Smith to take on Jeremy Corbyn, because Smith has more support 
amongst MPs. (See 5.04pm.)

The Labour party has not yet published the figures for how many MPs are

Anushka Asthana (@GuardianAnushka) 
Still waiting but if right Smith gets 90 nominations, of which 88 MPs, Eagle 
gets 72, of which 9 are MEPs... So pressure on Eagle.

Here are two tweets on Boris Johnson’s performance.

From Bloomberg’s Robert Hutton
Robert Hutton (@RobDotHutton) 
All the US questions to Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> are basically: You're a liar, how 
can we trust you?
His answer: It was all a long time ago.

Except it wasn’t a long time ago, Adam Bienkov from politics.co.uk points out.
Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) 
Boris Johnson under fire for past comments, repeatedly claims they “go back 30 
years”. Comments about Obama go back less than 3 months.

Turning back to the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
leadership contest, my colleague Anushka Asthana has an update.
Anushka Asthana (@GuardianAnushka) 
Hearing that Owen Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> is 
25 MPs ahead. But Eagle is 7 MEPs ahead... Total difference 18...
 <https://twitter.com/GuardianAnushka/status/755426086935224320> July 19, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/GuardianAnushka/status/755426086935224320>  
Q: [To Johnson] You have a history of misrepresentations and lies. Why should 
Kerry believe what you say?

Johnson says people are “more than welcome” to rake over what he has written 
over many years, but he wants to get on with the problems facing the world 
today. Most people paying their taxes would want that, he says.

Q: Is there any chance of prioritising the UK over countries already in the 
queue for a trade deal?

Kerry says that would be impossible. Until the UK leaves the EU, it is still 
part of the EU. He says he is working to make progress on TTIP. TTIP is even 
more important for Europe now than it was, he says. He says he wants to 
demythologise it. Regulations do not go downwards, he says. It won’t stop 
countries having strict standards, he says. He says there has not been enough 
pro-advocacy of its benefits. He accepts that people may have voted for Brexit 
because they felt they were not getting the benefits of globalisation. He says 
TTIP will help to ensure that people do benefit from globalisation.

He says in Europe people’s incomes and chances have been significantly 
improved by globalisation.

 * Kerry says TTIP will help people share in the benefits in globalisation. 
Johnson says he passionately agrees with this.

People on low wages have not felt the benefits of globalisation.

The answer to that is to invest in skills and to increase people’s 
productivity. We have to be more outward looking, more free-trading, he says.

 * Johnson says UK needs to become more outward-looking and more free-trading 
after Brexit. 
The press conference is over.

I will post a summary soon.
 
Q: Is the UK still going to be at the back of the queue for a trade deal?

Kerry says that the US trade representative has said that the US will talk 
about a trade deal with the US.

Johnson says it is impossible to enter into a trade deal while the UK is still 
in the EU.

Q: Amber Rudd has refused to commit the government to getting net migration 
below 100,000.

Johnson says Rudd is right not to commit to numbers, because you do not want 
to disappoint people.

But when the UK leaves the EU, it will be able able to exert controls.

And, as for the heat (mentioned by the questioner), we have some spare water 
cannon, he says.
 
Q: [To Johnson] You said President Obama disliked the UK because he was 
part-Kenyan. And you have likened Hillary Clinton to a sadistic nurse, and to 
Lady Macbeth. Do you take these comments back?

Johnson says he would like to repeat what he said earlier. There is a rich 
thesaurus of things he has said that have been misconstrued that it would take 
too long to apologise for them.

And people who read them in their context will see that he was misunderstood.

He says the current problems are more important than any obiter dicta from the 
past.

 * Johnson says that his past comments have been “misconstrued” - and that 
apologising for them all would take too long. 
Q: [To Kerry] Given what Johnson said during the EU referendum campaign, is he 
what the UK and the US needs?

Kerry says the subjects he is working on with Johnson have nothing to do with 
the EU referendum. He is confident that they will be able to work together.

On the referendum, he says the people have voted. We all respect democracy. He 
and President Obama wanted a different vote. But they respect the result.

He says he is “absolutely confident” that he can work with Johnson.

 * Kerry says Johnson’s EU referendum record will not stop them working 
together. 
 * He praises Johnson’s “considerable intellect and values”.
