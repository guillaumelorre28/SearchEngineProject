From her window 61-year-old Radif Shamoyan can just about see the benches 
under the mulberry tree outside, where locals gather every evening to talk 
about the day’s events. The last time Shamoyan was able to join in the 
conversation was nearly 10 years ago. Since then, she has been a virtual 
prisoner in her home.


Shamoyan has been unable to walk since an accident when she was 19, but says 
she would be able to get around in her wheelchair perfectly well – if only she 
could get it out of the flat.

The problem is that her neighbours have built a storage room near the entrance 
to the building, blocking the space where Shamoyan had hoped to install a ramp 
for her chair.

She tried to take her neighbours to court to force them to remove the store 
room, but the case failed because she was unable to afford a lawyer. The court 
ruled that she had not provided sufficient evidence to support her case.

“I have to ask someone to do all the shopping for me,” she said. “It is not 
easy to ask people every time. [But] I could do everything for myself, if I 
could just leave home.”

Shamoyan tried to appeal against the court’s decision, but the case was 
dismissed because it had not been lodged by a licensed advocate.

“When I received the response I felt bad, lost hope totally,” she said. “I 
wish the judges would put themselves in my place, just for a moment.”

Shamoyan’s particular problem may be unique, but the Armenian government’s 
failure to provide adequate facilities is a frustration she shares with almost 
200,000 people with disabilities in the country.

According to a recent survey by the advocacy group Agat, eight percent of 
Armenian women with disabilities are not able to leave their homes more than a 
few times a year.

A Unicef report in 2012 found that up to 200 girls with disabilities have 
never left home, or only go out when visiting the doctor.

In 2010 Armenia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenia> ratified the UN 
convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, yet activists say the 
government has failed to implement its recommendations.

“The authorities of Armenia don’t think that the provision of facilities is 
their responsibility,” said Zaruhi Batoyan, the president of Armenia’s National
Disability <https://www.theguardian.com/society/disability> Advocacy Coalition. 
“They say they cannot afford it because of financial problems, but they always 
find resources for buying new government cars or upgrading officials’ offices.”

Despite this lack of care from authorities, Shamoyan has not given up. When 
her appeal was refused she applied to the European Court of Human Rights to 
have her neighbour’s store room declared illegal.

Last year the court ruled that her right to a fair trial had been violated, 
but Armenians authorities have yet to respond. The local municipality said it 
had no knowledge of the ECHR’s ruling and refused to comment on the case.

In the meantime Shamoyan’s health has deteriorated, but she says she will keep 
on fighting. She believes that a new government is needed to improve facilities 
for people with disabilities, and is determined to vote during next year’s 
election.

As is customary in Armenia, where there is no postal voting, she will have to 
rely on political parties to take her to the polling station. “If they know 
where I am, they will come, carry me and take me in order to get a vote,” she 
said.
