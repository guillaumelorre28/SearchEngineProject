Yet those thick, sweeping lines with a slanted flick remain notoriously hard 
to get right – especially with any sense of symmetry. Can dedicated fans and 
festival-goers imitate Saturday’s headliner at a rainy Glastonbury without a 
mirror?

“I couldn’t do my eyeliner this morning – I was crying over the referendum 
result,” says Heather, gamely taking up our challenge. She blends both the 
liquid and felt nib liner, drawing those all-important wings like a pro.
VERDICT: Adele!

Using liquid liner, Tom recreates Adele’s thick, opaque makeup – but largely 
under the eye itself, rather than across the upper lid. Starting out as an 
eyeliner novice, he soons gets the hang of it: “Once you find your eye, you’re 
fine!”VERDICT: A-Don’t!

Opting for the felt-nib liner, Amber draws strong bold lines along her lids. 
It’s a speedy application, following an initial under-the-eye blip. Those 
all-important flicks are subtly added on afterwards, having been initially 
forgotten.VERDICT: A-Don’t!

Keen to replicate the high drama of Adele’s signature sultry style, Hugh 
adopts an unusual method of application: rolling the liquid and felt-nib liners 
down both lids, before adding further definition using the pencil.VERDICT: 
Adele!

When she’s without a mirror, Lori’s go-to eyeliner hack is to use a pair of 
reflective sunglasses. Without access to either, she applies her liquid liner 
precisely in one smooth, gliding motion.VERDICT: A-Dept!

Moley

Despite being unfamiliar with Adele’s famous flicks, Moley soon gets the hang 
of it: “I can do anything – I’m Adele!” he announces, just one eye in, using 
the pencil and felt-nib liners to recreate her look – on both his upper and 
lower lids.VERDICT: A-Dont!
