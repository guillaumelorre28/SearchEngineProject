Each week before the Oscars, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/how-to-win-your-oscars-pool> which 
take place on Sunday, Guardian film reviewerTom Shone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-shone> breaks down the likely winners 
at this year’s Academy Awards. Today: best picture, best director, best 
editing, best original screenplay and best adapted screenplay.

It feels like another of those years. Why does it feel as if the Academy 
Awards are in great shape except when it comes to the annual mouse-hunt known 
as “the search for best picture”? The acting categories have never been more 
competitive; each year we get a raft of great nominees and winners, each making 
new claims for performance in a tech-heavy universe. The same goes for director 
race, with the likes of Ang Lee, James Cameron andAlfonso Cuarón 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron> pushing the envelope of that 
technology to diamond-cut their vision of a glittering, global cinema.

But my, how ill-fitting the crown of best picture seems to fit on the recent 
pretenders to that throne: The Artist, Argo, The King’s Speech. The great 
consensus that lifted the winners of yesteryear – from The Godfather and One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest to Amadeus – seems long since scattered to the four 
winds. This year, you should be able to list the winners for best picture, best 
director, best actor, best actress and best original screenplay and not list 
the same film twice.

The film I have for best picture, meanwhile, faces the narrowest path to 
victory – just three wins – since, well, last year, when Argo constructed a 
three-Oscar path to the podium. Have winners ever wound such skimpy paths to 
best picture? Argo’s measly three were beaten by Life of Pi’s four, Million 
Dollar Baby’s four were beaten by The Aviator’s five, and Crash’s three were 
equaled by both Brokeback Mountain and Memories of a Geisha. We live in an era 
of half-strength best picture winners.

Split years – with best director and picture going home separately – used to 
occur once a decade, but it happened three times in the 2000s, the year of 
Gladiator/Soderbergh (2000), Chicago/Polanski (2002), Crash/Ang Lee (2006), and 
then again, last year, when Ang Lee peeled away best director while Argo drove 
off with best picture. Not only does it look like happening again this year, 
but for very similar reasons. If anyone wants to see in these splits an echo of 
the much deeper divide currently bifurcating Hollywood, between blockbuster 
dollars and indie creativity, then give yourself a gold star.

Again and again at the Oscars, voters seem to have been confronted with the 
same choice between a technological marvel like Avatar, Hugo, Life of Pi or 
Gravity, and something smaller, critically acclaimed, with dust in its lungs 
and dirt on its feet, like The Hurt Locker, Argo or 12 Years A Slave that 
connects with the Academy’s sense of importance.

It’s going to be a long night for supporters of 12 Years a Slave but then they 
should be used to it by now, their powers of endurance tested by the film 
itself, whose neo-brutalist aesthetic has been giving Hollywood such agita, and 
making for some nail-biting evenings at the Globes (where it went one for 
seven) the CCMAs (three for 13) the Baftas (two for 10). Oscar night looks like 
being no different, with Gravity pinching everything in sight – winning six 
maybe seven Oscars, including cinematography, VFX, score, sound mixing and 
editing, as well as best director for Alfonso Cuarón.

So why won’t Gravity simply sweep, as some are predicting? Gravity’s weakness 
as a candidate for best picture is revealed by its lack of a screenplay writing 
nomination, something no a best picture winner since Titanic has been able to 
do without. As the other awards have peeled away, centrifugally, writing has 
been the one to grow closer. So expect the first sign of Slave’s eventual 
strength to be a best adapted screenplay win for John Ridley.

Why will 12 Years will win best picture? In a word, history. Or as the 
billboards on the Fox lot have it:“It’s Time.” The Academy will not be able to 
live with themselves if they pass up the opportunity to reward the definitive 
treatment of slavery or the black experience, something they haven’t even 
touched since In The Heat of the Night in 1968, in much the same way they 
couldn’t miss out on their only opportunity to reward WiIl Shakespeare back in 
1999, the first Mr-Potato-Head Oscars of the modern era, with Shakespeare in 
Love swooping in at the last minute to pilfer four Oscars, including best 
picture, away from Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan.

It’s not just best director that has gone walkies lately. During the 1970s, 
best picture also drove best actor and best actress nine times out of 10 – only 
The Sting and Rocky failed to generate wins for its leads. That’s wins, not 
nominations. Compare that with the 2000s, when director came apart from picture 
on three separate occasions, and only Gladiator and Million Dollar Baby 
followed through for Russell Crowe and Hillary Swank. Everyone briefly joined 
hands to coronate Colin Firth and Jean Dujardin for The King’s Speech and The 
Artist in 2011 and 2012. No wonder Meryl Streep called Weinstein “God” – when 
Harvey has a bad year, the closest thing the Oscars has to a centre or 
consensus is gone.

This year, the acting nominees come from the same place they usually do: 
small, gritty indies like Nebraska and Dallas Buyer’s Club, tucked far away 
from the ever-more frantic hunt for best picture. The film that could have 
solved all of this, the answer to everyone’s prayers, uniting best picture, 
director and all the acting categories, is David O Russell’s conman fantasia, 
American Hustle, which garnered nominations in all four acting categories, just 
a year after Russell pulled off the same feat with his previous film, Silver 
Linings Playbook – a feat that has never happened in the Academy’s 86-year 
history.

And yet there is a strong chance that the director may go home empty-handed. 
American Hustle felt under-powered to some, too self-conscious an elaboration 
of the Capra-in-indie-land aesthetic that powered up The Fighter and Silver 
Linings Playbook. Russell’s best chance is probably in best original 
screenplay, but there he faces tough competition fromSpike Jonze 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/spike-jonze>, who’s coming off successive 
wins at the Critics’ Choice, Golden Globe and WGA awards, not to mention a 
prize from the New York Film Critics Online group for his futuristic love story 
Her.

Jonze’s script has the light-bulb factor – the sense of an original idea, 
worked through in all its detail, that make writers seem worth their salt on an 
evening like this. Can the Academy face reducing Russell’s nine nominations to 
zilch? They did something similar to Spielberg’s Lincoln last year, sending the 
most nominated film of the evening home with just two wins. I’m not sure the 
right hand knows what the left hand is doing with enough accuracy to give out 
consolation prizes. I think it’ll be Jonze, by a hair, but check back at the 
end of the week for my final predictions.
