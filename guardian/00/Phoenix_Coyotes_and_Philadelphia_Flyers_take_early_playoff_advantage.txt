<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/philadelphia-flyers> 4-3 victory over the 
New Jersey Devils on Sunday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinal series

Briere had his second chance at the winner count minutes after an apparent 
goal was overturned on review because he kicked it into the net. He also scored 
in the second period.

He wasted no time making up for the missed opportunity, firing a slapper past 
Martin Brodeur for his seventh goal of the playoffs. Brodeur was screened in 
front by Philadelphia forward James van Riemsdyk.

Game 2 is Tuesday in Philadelphia.

Van Riemsdyk and Claude Giroux also scored for the Flyers.

Zach Parise, Travis Zajac and Petr Sykora scored for the Devils.

Phoenix leads series 2-0
At Glendale, Arizona, Shane Doan, Radim Vrbata, Antoine Vermette and Martin 
Hanzal each had a goal and an assist, Mike Smith made 30 saves, and Phoenix 
avoided its usual overtime theatrics, beating Nashville to take a 2-0 lead in 
the Western Conference semifinal series.

Taylor Pyatt also scored for the Coyotes. Ryan Suter, Patric Hornqvist and 
Andrei Kostitsyn scored for the Predators.

Phoenix scored three times on 19 second-period shots. The Coyotes built a 
two-goal lead early in the second period. Nashville twice cut it to one only to 
see Phoenix quickly respond.

The Coyotes did not go into overtime for only the second time in eight playoff 
games.

The best-of-seven series shifts to Nashville for Game 3 on Wednesday night.
