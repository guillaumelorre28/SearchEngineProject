Bliss was it to be alive in that process of editing that Guardian partwork 
about hip-hop and R&B. I may be paraphrasing Ghostface Killah there (at least, 
I think it was him), but editing this supplement that you should surely hold in 
your hands today (or look at on the internet 
<http://www.guprod.gnl/music/series/a-history-of-rnb-and-hip-hop>) was great 
fun.

This is the space for you to share your favourites, both in terms of acts and 
recorded output, plus – naturally – your own suggestions for inclusion on the 
list. I acknowledge upfront that this list skews more towards hip-hop than R&B 
– we could have done with some more moments to play with – so recommendations 
in that area especially are welcome.

As a parting gift I give you a few links to things I found along the way, but 
were unable to include for reasons varied: an archive ofMr Magic's WBLS radio 
show
