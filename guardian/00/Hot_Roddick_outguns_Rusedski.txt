Andy Roddick produced a stunning performance to overcome a gritty display from 
Greg Rusedski in the second round of the Australian Open.

After a delayed start due to previous long matches on the same court, Roddick 
looked intent on taking care of business as soon as possible. Rusedski was 
subsequently blown off court by Roddick in the first set, winning just 11 
points as the second seed produced a superb array of shots to storm through the 
set 6-0 in only 18 minutes.

But Rusedski refused to give up without a fight and took the second set 6-3 
after breaking Roddick's serve in the eighth game, the American serving his 
first two double faults of the match.

The British No2 had done superbly to get back on level terms and only two 
pieces of bad luck effectively cost him the third set.

A net cord in the sixth game put Rusedski 15-40 down on his own serve and, 
although the left-hander got back to deuce, he could do nothing when another 
net cord gave Roddick another opportunity which he gratefully accepted.

A second break to seal the set 6-2 was largely immaterial, although it did 
give Roddick the advantage of serving first in the fourth set.

A double fault and easy volley into the net gave Roddick more break points in 
the second game of the fourth set and a superb backhand return winner down the 
line put the 22-year-old in total command.

Roddick duly served out for a 6-0, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 win to secure a third round 
clash with Austria's 32nd seed Jurgen Melzer.
