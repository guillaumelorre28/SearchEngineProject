Käthe Kollwitz Museum

Of all Berlin's artists, no one captured the pain suffered in and exported 
from this place more than Käthe Kollwitz. The intense intimacy of her work 
revealed residents' hopes and horrors, as well as the unspoken pains of the 
poor, in images and forms which – 60 years after her death – still appear to 
burst from the artist's heart. This privately owned museum, just off the 
Ku'damm, includes hundreds of her finest drawings, etchings and sculptures. A 
passageway connects the museum to the neighbouringLiteraturhaus 
<http://www.literaturhaus-berlin.de/>, with one of the city's most civilised 
cafes.

Neues Museum

Over the last decade the Neues Museum, a bombed-out ruin since 1945, has been 
repaired and rebuilt by British starchitect David Chipperfield. His recreation 
is a striking building which can be read like a book, telling – through its 
original walls, surviving textural details, all-but-lost classical frescos and 
soaring new spaces – the story of man's ability to create, destroy and 
preserve. It is the perfect museum for Berlin. The collection, which includes a 
Neanderthal skull, the bust of Egyptian queen Nefertiti and Heinrich 
Schliemann's Trojan antiquities, isn't half bad either.

Bauhaus Archives – Museum of Design

Berlin has long been a capital of creativity but unlike London, Paris and New 
York the radiance of its arts shines brightest against the darkness in its 
past. The city is the spiritual home of the Bauhaus, the most influential 
school of architecture, design and art in the 20th century. Its Archive – or 
Museum of Design – houses a sensational collection of sculptures, ceramics, 
furniture and architectural models by Walter Gropius, Moholy-Nagy, Klee, 
Kandinsky and the many others who – with the Nazis' rise to power – fled 
Germany and carried modernism to the New World. A free guided tour runs every 
Sunday at 3pm.

Museum Berggruen

Heinz Berggruen bought his first painting in 1940 for $100 – a watercolour by 
Paul Klee. Half a century later, he gave to Berlin the bulk of his fabulous 
collection, then valued at $450m and including 165 masterpieces by Braque, 
Matisse, Klee and Giacometti. This intimate gallery, situated opposite the 
Schloss Charlottenburg, also has more than 100 works by Picasso from early 
student sketches to the blue and rose period through his cubist years and up to 
the year before his death in April 1973. Guided tours for children are offered 
on most Saturdays (paper and crayons provided).

Topography of Terror
 Photograph: Alamy 
That Germany is open and dynamic today is a consequence of taking 
responsibility for its history. In a courageous, humane and moving manner, the 
country is subjecting itself to a national psychoanalysis. This Freudian idea, 
that the repressed (or at least unspoken) will fester like a canker unless it 
is brought to the light, can be seen in Daniel Libeskind's tortured Jewish 
Museum, at the Holocaust Memorial and, above all, at the Topography of Terror. 
Be aware that this outdoor museum, built on the site of the former headquarters 
of the SS and Gestapo, is not for the fainthearted.

Jewish Museum
 Photograph: Bitter and Bredt <http://www.bitterbredt.de/> 
At the start of the 20th century, Berlin was the largest Jewish city in the 
world. One third of the 100 richest Prussians were Jews. By 1945 Hitler had 
destroyed Germany's rich diversity, making it both poorer and more homogeneous. 
Berlin's Jewish Museum – with its extension by Daniel Libeskind – explores two 
millennia of German Jewish history. But far from being locked in the past, the 
museum looks forward with child-friendly tours, weekend workshops and special 
shows including a histories of Jewish football and radical Jewish music in New 
York.

Allied Museum

At the end of the second world war, the victorious Allies divided Berlin into 
four sectors. Stalin's secret intention was to draw Berlin – and then the whole 
of Germany – into the Communist orbit. In 1948 he blockaded the city as a means 
of driving the Americans out of Europe, but the Allies retaliated by launching 
the Berlin airlift to sustain its freedom. The cold war heated up and in 1961 
the Soviets built the Wall to completely encircle the western sectors. The 
Allied Museum tells the story of those years. Displays include the guardhouse 
from Checkpoint Charlie, an RAF Hastings, as well as a section of the Berlin 
spy tunnel, the largest ever SIS/CIA operation.

The Berlin Wall Memorial
 Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters 
Bernauer Strasse witnessed some of the most tragic scenes when the city was 
divided in 1961: East Berliners jumped from apartment windows, vaulted over 
barbed wire, tunnelled beneath the streets in an attempt to reach freedom. The 
Berlin Wall Memorial – which includes the city's only unadorned stretch of 
border fortifications and a superb museum – marks the iniquity, compliance and 
heroism of East and West Berliners during those tragic years. A must.

DDR Museum
 DDR Museum 
Trabants, hidden microphones, beach volleyball nudists and Spreewald pickles: 
Ostalgie (or nostalgia for life in former East) might worry parts of country (a 
recent survey found half of 16-year-olds believed East Germany was never a 
dictatorship), but at the DDR Museum visitors can safely experience life in 
under communism – at least for their 90-minute visit. Watch TV in the authentic 
East Berlin living room, spy on your neighbours, join the FDJ pioneers or march 
in the May Day parade. The museum is located on the river Spree opposite Berlin 
cathedral.

Currywurst Museum

 Photograph: Ray Tang / Rex Features 
The currywurst is as much a part of Berlin as the Brandenburg Gate, with more 
than 70,000,000 curried sausages scoffed in the city every year. No surprise 
then that Berliners should celebrate their civic dish with a feel-good museum. 
Uncover the story of fast food through the ages, learn about the "currywurst 
war", lie back on the Sausage Sofa and discover why Volkswagen is one of 
Germany's largest sausage makers. Entrance is far from cheap but the souvenirs 
are among the best in Berlin (for non-vegetarians) and the complimentary 
"Currywurst in a Cup" has the tastiest, fruitiest sauce I've found anywhere in 
town.
