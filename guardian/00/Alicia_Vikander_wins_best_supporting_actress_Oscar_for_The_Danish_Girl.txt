<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-danish-girl>.

The 27-year-old star beat favourite Kate Winslet for the award. The Steve Jobs 
star was seen as the frontrunner after winning both the Bafta and Golden Globe 
for her performance. Vikander had also won the Screen Actors Guild award for 
her role.

The film, directed by Oscar-winner Tom Hooper, focuses on the first ever 
recipient of gender reassignment surgery and the effect this has on his 
marriage. Vikander stars opposite Eddie Redmayne, who is also nominated for his 
performance.
