The Hello singer claimed she turned down an offer to play the slot in 2017 
during a gig at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday night (13 
August). She told the crowd: “First of all, I’m not doing theSuper Bowl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/super-bowl>. I mean, come on, that show is 
not about music. And I don’t really … I can’t dance or anything like that. They 
were very kind, they did ask me, but I said no.”

However, both the NFL and the halftime show sponsor Pepsi have denied an 
official offer was ever tabled. In a joint statement, they said: “The NFL and 
Pepsi are big fans of Adele. We have had conversations with several artists 
about the Pepsi Super Bowl halftime show. However, we have not at this point 
extended a formal offer toAdele <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele> or 
anyone else. We are focused on putting together a fantastic show for Houston 
and we look forward to revealing that in good time.”

Adele has a reputation for turning down big shows, and it was seen as a major 
coup when she agreed toheadline Glastonbury this year

. Were she to perform at the Super Bowl she would join a long list of stars who
