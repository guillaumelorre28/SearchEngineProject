The resignation of Mark Wigglesworth, English National Opera’s music director (
Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/eno-music-director-mark-wigglesworth-quits>
, 23 March), does not augur well for the future of the company.

There is only one question that matters. Is there the political will to 
support two full-time opera companies in London, supposedly the world’s 
cultural capital? ENO’s current grant from the Arts Council is almost exactly 
the same in cash terms as it was more than 20 years ago when I was responsible 
for fundraising. The answer would appear to be no.

Under current proposals, ENO will become a part-time producer of opera and 
musicals. It will cease to be a company and is likely to lose many of its 
private donors.

Many will be blamed if ENO falls but the lack of political commitment should 
be seen for what it is: a disgrace.
John Nickson
Director of development, ENO, 1989-96
