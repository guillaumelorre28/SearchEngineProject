Engineering group Amec has dropped more than 4% after disappointing results 
from a US company it is taking over for £2bn.

Foster Wheeler - which Amec is due to officially take over imminently - 
reported earnings well below expectations, sending Amec shares down 43p to 
£10.13. Analysts at Liberum issued a sell note onAmec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/amec>, saying:

Foster Wheeler yesterday reported adjusted earnings per share of 31 cents, 
missing consensus 49 cents hit by a higher tax rate and poor performance in its 
Global Power Group. It states the environment is “challenging” and reported 
lower new orders in Engineering and Construction due to delays in prospect 
awards.

Amec’s acquisition of Foster Wheeler is scheduled to complete tomorrow. The 
Foster Wheeler comments appear consistent with our view that the environment 
for Oil Service shares is deteriorating. Some of this is already in prices but 
Amec, on 2015 enterprise value/EBITDA of 6.7 times is far from a 
bottom-of-cycle rating.
