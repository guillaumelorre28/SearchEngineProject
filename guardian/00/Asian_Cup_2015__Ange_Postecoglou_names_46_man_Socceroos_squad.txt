Ange Postecoglou <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ange-postecoglou> 
insists he has an open mind to the final make-up of his Asian Cup squad after 
naming a 46-strong preliminary group.


From 17-year-old Daniel de Silva to 35-year-old veteran Tim Cahill, 
Postecoglou has given a nod to the future as well as including each of the 23 
Socceroos from the World Cup squad.


But there’s no room for veterans Luke Wilkshire and Lucas Neill, ending their 
Socceroos careers.


Neill – named as tournament ambassador by FFA chairman Frank Lowy – was never 
a realistic prospect, while he remains without a club.


But Wilkshire travelled to Brazil with the Socceroos in June before being cut 
at the last minute, and had been playing regularly in the Dutch top flight 
competition.


Postecoglou said he had “no idea” where Neill was but a recent hamstring 
injury didn’t help Wilkshire.


“Everyone’s considered, there isn’t a footballer that I wouldn’t consider,” he 
said.

 Postecoglou says the team must be ready to win the tournament 
The Socceroos coach said there was no perfect science behind the number of 
players, which will be cut to a training squad of around 26 before a final 
group of 23 goes into camp on December 27.


The large group ensures there is cover in all areas and gives “a little bit of 
encouragement” to players on the radar.


“I can’t afford to think about 23 players right now, that’s why we’ve cast the 
net far and wide,” he said.


“I feel a lot more comfortable a month out from our first game than I did 
prior to the World Cup in terms of the options and the depth that we have.”


There are 16 A-League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league> players 
in the squad and four without Socceroos experience; De Silva, Luke Brattan, 
Josh Risdon and Mustafa Amini.


De Silva’s selection is a bolt from the blue but Postecoglou said the Perth 
Glory starlet wasn’t making up the numbers.


“If his form warrants it, he’ll get selected,” he said.


Injuries could yet wreck the chances of several players.


Rhys Williams hasn’t played since January and is unlikely to resume national 
duty despite being almost back to full training.


World Cup regular Adam Taggart has yet to play for Fulham after surgery, while 
Josh Kennedy and Bailey Wright are under injury clouds.


But Robbie Kruse, who is playing in Germany, is a lock for the tournament 
after missing Brazil through a knee injury.


Postecoglou said the final make-up would be a strong contender for the January 
tournament.


“Everything we’ve done post-World Cup is to make sure we’ll be ready for 
January 9, and we will be,” he said.
