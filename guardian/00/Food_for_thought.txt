The National Schools' Nutrition Programme (NSNP) now reaches approximately 
eight million pupils in poorer schools across South Africa.

The programme supplies school children with one nutritionally balanced meal a 
day, educates students about nutrition and encourages sustainable gardening in 
schools and communities.

For Principal Mbatha, the NSNP has boosted attendance, providing starving 
orphans with an incentive to go to school: "When you say 'have you eaten' they 
say, 'if I'm given a plate, I eat half in the evening, and half in the 
morning'". Many arrive at school with an empty stomach after walking up to 15km.

Although provincial governments fund the NSNP, it remains up to the schools to 
choose their service provider, ensure deliveries are met and children fed on 
time. It is in this area that education group Fuel is working with the 
government to enable schools to take control of the programme – strengthening 
sustainability and the impact on communities.

Working in 15 schools supported by The David Rattray Foundation, Fuel 
discovered that many were not completely committed to the programme: menus and 
nutritional advice were confusing, children weren't fed on time and schools 
didn't understand the role they played in choosing their service provider, 
often picking the cheapest and most overstretched.

Having now delivered training to school officials and food handlers, Fuel 
plans to revisit the schools to evaluate them on their progress. Although 
gardens lack a variety of vegetables, they are now visible in schools and 
communities – improving health and productivity at home and in the classroom.
