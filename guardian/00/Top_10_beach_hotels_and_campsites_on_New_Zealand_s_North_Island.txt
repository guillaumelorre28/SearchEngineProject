Although the geysers at Rotorua and lunar landscape of Tongariro tempt many 
visitors inland, New Zealand’s North Island is a rewarding destination for 
beach lovers, too. As with the South Island, the North has many brooding vistas 
where wild seas meet rocky shores, but it is also home to brilliant blue water 
and gorgeous stretches of white sand.


The most enticing beaches are in three distinct areas. There’s the 
sub-tropical Bay of Islands, in the far north, with its abundant marine life 
and scenic ferry trips; the sun-drenched Coromandel peninsula, east of 
Auckland; and Hawke’s Bay in the south-east, which is considerably more rugged. 
Visitor numbers in all three regions drop dramatically outside of the main 
holiday months of December and January, bringing cheaper rates and plenty of 
opportunities for seclusion.

If there’s such a thing as a tourist hotspot in New Zealand, it’s the Bay of 
Islands – but those accustomed to holidaying in the Mediterranean or along 
Australia’s east coast will still find the place comparatively quiet. It’s 
worth spending a few days or more in the area to take in the beaches, diverse 
marine life (particularly the dolphins) and the titular islands. The 25-room 
Duke of Marlborough, in thehistoric port town of Russell 
<http://www.russellnz.co.nz/russell-history/>, holds New Zealand’s oldest 
liquor licence, and although the building has burned down twice since 1827, it 
still boasts plenty of period detail (including some stunning 20th-century 
furniture). In the 1930s extension at the rear, you’ll find inexpensive rooms 
with bright white decor, or you can splash out for a larger room with a balcony 
overlooking the promenade and the bay. Local craft beer rules in the 
restaurant, and the attractive Long Beach is a few minutes’ walk away.

Breakfast on the balcony at Arcadia Lodge is almost too good – by the time 
you’ve gorged yourself on the home-made muesli, rich organic yoghurt and local 
fruit, then sampled the ever-changing cooked special, you may find yourself 
ready for a nap. Hosts Brad and David are some of the friendliest you’ll find 
in Russell, and the pride they take in maintaining the lodge’s three nautically 
themed suites is evident: there’s not a scuffed edge to be seen. Small touches, 
like the jar of ginger cookies in the kitchen and the books on New Zealand 
flora, fauna and history, give the place a genuinely homely feel.

Paihia can’t match Russell for colonial history, but it has a decent beach and 
its wharf is the departure point for many Bay of Islands day cruises. If you 
base yourself here, opt for a property on the hillside, so you can watch the 
sun set over the water. Allegra House, run by enthusiastic European expats 
Heinz and Brita Marti, looks an unassuming place from the street, but each of 
its three bed-and-breakfast rooms boasts a balcony with postcard views of the 
bay. The property’s native garden is well tended, and the beach is a quick 
stroll away.

This campground on the outskirts of Paihia looks out over its own small bay, 
with a pebbly beach that’s ideal for a tranquil stroll. There’s dense bushland 
behind the site and plenty of birdlife. Recently upgraded bathrooms, a smart 
communal cooking area (with a shared fridge) and reliably strong wifi give the 
place an edge over some of the run-down campsites in the area. There’s even a 
herb garden that guests are welcome to raid before cooking their meals. The 
sites are small, and not all offer water views, but pricing – particularly for 
en-suite cabins – is competitive.

 View of nearby Bethells Beach 
Auckland’s beaches are underwhelming, but drive out of the city and you’ll 
find good strips of sand that feel far more remote than they really are. 
Bethells Beach is one such spot; it’s fringed by dramatic hills and home to 
dark sand and crashing waves. Although the place is only an hour away, many 
Aucklanders have yet to discover it, which means you’ve a good chance of 
securing one of the three suites at Bethells Beach Cottages. It’s an 
unpretentious property run by fifth-generation landowner Trude Bethell and her 
husband. There are generous hampers of local produce for breakfast, and compact 
but functional kitchens in each suite for guests to cook other meals.

It’s easy to fill a few days in the Hawke’s Bay region: there are vineyards to 
explore, wide beaches, and lush, hilly hiking terrain. The centrepiece of the 
area is Napier, a seaside town that was almost completely destroyed byan 
earthquake in 1931 <http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/historic-earthquakes/page-6> 
and then rebuilt in art deco style. The Crown is great value for independent 
travellers – undercover parking is free, as are the DIY laundry facilities, and 
the 42 guest rooms are well maintained; request one with a water view.

This is the Napier hotel to book if you’re after a full art deco experience – 
the exterior is one of the finest in town, and the staff deliver courteous, 
old-fashioned service. The 42 guest rooms have recently been refurbished, and

atmospheric, and popular with locals too. The juicy, local, braised lamb is 
deservedly popular.

 View of Waipatiki Beach, from the Holiday Park 
Unlike some of the family-focused holiday parks around the North Island, this 
spot, about 30 minutes’ drive north of Napier, has a peaceful, cut-off vibe. 
The campsites and cabins are generously spread out, and there’s a no-noise 
policy after 10pm which is gently enforced by the staff. The water off the 
compact beach can get rough, but lifeguards patrol during peak times, and 
there’s a shallow stream for young children to splash about in. Hosts Shona and 
Paul are brimming with suggestions for local day trips, though city slickers 
may find the unreliable Wi-Fi (which must be paid for) frustrating.

The north-facing, rainforest-clad Coromandel peninsula (known as “the 
Coromandel”) is popular with Aucklanders during the Christmas break, but feels 
pleasantly sleepy at other times of the year. The white-sand beaches are some 
of the most impressive in New Zealand, and several still feel undiscovered. 
Sheltered by the coastal bushland and with no near-neighbours, Otama Beach 
Hideaway is a single studio apartment with impressive views of Mercury Bay 
islands from the timber deck. This is real “get away from it all” 
accommodation: there’s no phone reception and the nearest proper shops are a 
20-minute drive away. You receive a breakfast hamper upon arrival but the rest 
is up to you (there’s a kitchenette and an outdoor grill for your daily catch).

 The beach at Hahei Holiday Resort 
This family-centric campsite feels crowded when full, but visit outside the 
December/January peak season (particularly in February and March, when the 
water is warmest) and you can enjoy a summer-holiday experience without too 
much bustle. Unlike many Kiwi beaches, Hahei is calm and clear, making it an 
excellent spot for kids to splash around and for adults to kayak. The 
campground changed hands last year, and the new owners have added a range of 
welcome new features, from spade-hire for children who want to build 
sandcastles to a pop-up pizzeria that operates during the warmer months. Most 
impressive? The on-site shop now serves Auckland-quality espresso.
