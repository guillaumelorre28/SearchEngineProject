As anyone who has been to a Rolling Stones concert in the past 26 years will 
tell you, there is a moment where Mick Jagger, for all his grandiose stage 
swagger, is briefly, but undeniably, upstaged.

As the opening chords of Gimme Shelter begin, Lisa Fischer steps out from 
behind the backing microphones and roars, in vocals that can fill any stadium, 
some of the most famous lyrics in pop music: “Rape, muuuurder / It’s just a 
shot away / It’s just a shot away.” Hers is a voiceso big and so 
spine-tinglingly beautiful 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iUleCk0Va8&list=RD_iUleCk0Va8#t=140>that on a 
nightly basis it does the near impossible: it steals the show from the Rolling 
Stones. As Jagger himself once said, that duet is “always the high point of the 
show for me”.

Fischer’s name might not be familiar but if you listen closely, her voice is 
everywhere. From records by Luther Vandross, Billy Ocean, Dionne Warwick,Aretha 
Franklin <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aretha-franklin> and Alicia Keys, 
to live shows from Tina Turner, Chaka Khan and Dolly Parton, Fischer has 
provided the vocal backdrop and harmonies to some of best-known songs of the 
past four decades.

Yet the music industry remains one defined by ego, and the giant, complex 
personalities of those at the front of the stage are the ones who history 
remembers. The talented – mostly female – voices that rose up behind them have 
mostly melted into musical oblivion.

Film-maker Morgan Neville changed all that. In 2013, he decided to seek out 
these seminal but maligned singers and tell their stories, filled more with 
disappointment and heartache than wealth and glory. The resulting documentary,
20 Feet from Stardom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/27/20-feet-from-stardom-review>, 
went on to win an Oscar, and elevated Fischer – along with three other 
generations of backing singers, Darlene Love, Merry Clayton and Judith Hill – 
to a level of fame that none had ever achieved.


On the back of that film’s success, Fischer embarked on her first solo world 
tour at the age of 57, with dates in Australia beginning this week before she 
returns to the United States. Performing with backing band the Grand Baton, her 
set is made up of covers from Led Zeppelin to Tina Turner.


It is easy to position this tour as Fischer’s long-awaited moment to finally 
step out of the shadow of the musical giants she has spent her life serving. 
But even now the singer visibly shuffles uncomfortably when described as a 
frontwoman.

“This would be scary if I felt like the real focus were on me per se, but in 
my head, in order to deal with it, it’s the music that’s really being 
presented; it is about the music flying. Not so much me,” she says.

There is very little of the rockstar musician in Fischer. Dressed in a floaty 
black outfit, sandals on her feet, her neck draped in beads, and a small stud 
in her nose, she speaks in hushed, soothing tones more reminiscent of a 
meditation instructor than someone with lungs that are a match for Aretha 
Franklin.

Even when pressed for stories of wild times on tour and in the studio with the 
Stones, Luther Vandross and Tina Turner, Fischer instead only recounts intimate 
moments: being jokingly reprimanded by Jagger for eating raw garlic before 
singing with him on stage; Vandross buying her a specially made fur coat; 
children’s birthday parties on the Rolling Stones tours. She recalls these 
memories with her eyes closed and a small contemplative smile plays across her 
face.

Fischer may appear at peace with the world, but, as she later adds, “it’s 
taken me almost 50 years to get there”.

“I’m accustomed to being in the background doing my thing and being really 
content with that,” she says. “But I also wasn’t aware that I was sacrificing 
myself. My younger self was just really happy when anyone asked me to do 
anything to do with singing, it was just that simple.”

Indeed, unlike others featured in 20 Feet from Stardom, Fischer never 
harboured a great desire to forge a solo career (“I was never the girl who was 
sat in the basement doing my demos or hunting for a record deal”).How Can I 
Ease The Pain <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4ZyCPhVvvM>, from her one solo 
venture, So Intense, beat off Aretha Franklin to win a Grammy in 1992, but the 
singer struggled with the pressures of a follow-up album and slipped easily 
back into background singing with a “sense of relief”.

Growing in Brooklyn to an alcoholic mother who gave birth to her at 16, and a 
father who left when Lisa was 14, hers was not an easy childhood, but it was 
filled with music. She won a scholarship to study opera at Queens College, but 
dropped out as she struggled to balance her studies with late-night gigs in New 
York clubs to pay the bills.

Then, in her early 20s, as she was becoming a new fixture of the local backing 
singer circuit, she was invited to an audition. Walking in to a New York ballet 
studio in a leather mini-skirt and blue rayon blouse (“it was the nicest things 
I had, which wasn’t a lot”), she found herself in front of a man standing 
behind a piano, smiling and eating a large bucket of chicken. It was Luther 
Vandross, and this audition would mark the beginning of a long working 
relationship, with Fischer providing the backup vocals on every Vandross tour 
and album until he died in 2005. It was also Vandross who pushed her into her 
brief and successful foray as a solo artist in 1991.

But he meeting with Vandross would also mark the beginning of a life where she 
relinquished control over her own singing voice – and a large part of herself 
by extension.

“I guess I didn’t have a sense of self, I was never really thinking much 
beyond the studio,” Fischer says. “I knew I could sing but as far as content, I 
didn’t know what I wanted to sing or who I was at all really. But singing 
background that didn’t matter; speaking your mind has nothing to do with the 
job requirement. So I got used to keeping quiet.”

Though Fischer professes to love both singing and performing, the spotlight 
has always been an uncomfortable place for her – and the pressure of being a 
woman in the music industry eventually grew into an eating disorder that she 
battled for years.


It was always this war between not being in touch with what I needed, either 
emotionally or just physically
Lisa Fischer 
“Yeah, for me that’s how it manifested,” she says, her voice growing almost 
imperceptibly soft. “It was always this war between not being in touch with 
what I needed, either emotionally or just physically ... and my weight would 
represent whether or not I had a job.”

Did this lack of self-worth contribute to her reluctance to fully pursue the 
spotlight for herself, even after a No 1 single and a Grammy?

A lengthy silence follows.

“Yes, maybe that’s why I felt like I just wasn’t ready,” Fischer says slowly, 
her eyes closed again. “Not making the second album was disappointing at first 
but then after that it was a sense of peace, because back then I couldn’t deal 
with the expectations that came with even that teeny bit of fame. There was so 
much to sort out that I hadn’t sorted out – how could I connect with me when I 
spent all of my time serving everyone else?”

The pressures, Fischer admits, have never really gone away; she says Neville’s 
film came along at a fortuitous time, as the perils of being an older woman in 
the music industry had begun to kick in.

She smiles sadly as she recounts a recent session singing with Alicia Keys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aliciakeys>. “After I was done singing the 
part she said, ‘Yeah, that old-school sound’. Old school? Right then I knew it 
was happening.”

She adds: “I realised as I get older, visually the demand for someone who 
looks like me, at my age, is not as strong and I could see the beginnings of 
the work slowing down. I started to worry about what I would do, because I 
still wanted to sing.”

Fischer throws her head back in good-natured laughter, then gets up to leave. 
She has to board an airplane for the millionth time. That same night she steps 
to the front of the stage in Oslo, dressed all in black with no shoes and no 
makeup, able, for the first time in her musical career, to “actually make some 
decisions of my own, musically and personally”. And as she begins to sing, one 
thing is clear: stardom is finally right beneath her bare feet.
