There are reasons to praise Ara Darzi, but his role in the continuing drive 
for commercial involvement in the NHS is not one of them (In praise of... Ara 
Darzi <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/16/ara-darzi>, 16 
July). During his tenure as health minister, the quality of patient care has 
moved up the political agenda and the use of targets has become less obsessive. 
We welcome his wish to see greater clinician involvement in the day-to-day 
management of the health service. And we have finally seen moves, long overdue, 
to set up an NHS constitution.

However, we are surprised by your assertion that the emphasis on private 
involvement in the NHS, a central theme of Darzi's Next Stage review, is 
neither dogmatic nor detrimental to staff morale. Doctors did not share his 
apparent determination to set up commercially run health centres in every 
primary care trust, regardless of local wishes. We remain frustrated by the 
amounts of public money diverted from frontline care to the bureaucratic costs 
of establishing healthcare markets or private management consultants as trusts 
compete. We share our patients' frustration at the increasing fragmentation of 
their care. We are angered to see independent providers being allowed to 
cherry-pick the most straightforward cases, while theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is left to deal with the 
complications when things go wrong.

The government is yet to provide convincing evidence that forcing NHS 
providers to compete with each other and the private sector is either 
beneficial to patients or a cost-effective use of taxpayers' money. Darzi's 
successor could win back the support of NHS staff by re-examining the dogma 
that competition and private provision are good for the NHS.
