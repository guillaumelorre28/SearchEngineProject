Kentz, the Irish contractor to the oil, gas and mining industries, started on 
the back foot whenAmec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/amec>, a practised 
acquisition machine, came knocking last week.

The problem was simple: the Malaysian investors who had successfully rescued 
Kentz in the 1990s had sold half their 26% stake a year ago, at 430p a share. 
Since one of the investors is also Kentz's chairman, there was a credibility 
issue in resisting Amec's indicative offer at 565p-580p, or about £700m.

A lot can happen in a year to change a company's value, of course. But if 
Kentz is serious about putting up a stout defence, it may have to produce 
stronger stuff than was contained in yesterday's interim numbers. Revenues were 
up 2%, to $775m, and reported pre-tax profits were 3% higher, at $52.7m. That 
was all in line with analysts' forecasts but was still lacking a certain 
transformational quality.

True, the backlog of orders – up 12%, to $2.8bn – looks solid enough. Kentz is 
also chatting about a busy period for bidding for new work, and expressed its 
confidence by pushing the half-year dividend up 20%. All the same, there were 
few specific gems to encourage long-standing shareholders to stay loyal.

They may reflect that if the bid buzz evaporates Kentz may once again be 
viewed as a well-run but ultimately lower-margin contractor whose shares 
traditionally trade at a discount to larger, engineering-focused rivals.

We shall see. Amec clearly hasn't offered its best shot yet, and it would have 
to go well above 600p to persuade Kentz to open its books, especially if the 
German M+W Group is still sniffing. But the share price, steady at 565p, is 
saying Kentz has not killed the takeover talk yet.
