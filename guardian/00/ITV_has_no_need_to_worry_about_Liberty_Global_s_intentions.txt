Close your eyes and you might almost think ITV's interim results incorporated 
an early draft of a defence document shouldLiberty Global 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/liberty-global>, the cable group that is now 
a 6.4% shareholder, put a takeover bid on the table. The centrepiece of the ITV 
show was a shiny new dividend policy: investors can expect ordinary 
distributions to rise by an eye-catching 20% a year for the next three years.

Actually, the idea that ITV was playing clever Liberty-inspired games is 
clearly nonsense. The broadcaster emerged from its crisis at least two years 
ago – it even paid a chunky special dividend last year – so shareholders 
deserved to know what a "normal" dividend policy would look like. A commitment 
to 20% a year sends the right message about "capital discipline" given that its 
chief executive,Adam Crozier <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-crozier>, 
has developed a strong appetite for buying production houses.

ITV's interim figures – revenues up 7% and adjusted pre-tax profits 16% better 
at £312m – were less flashy than the dividend, despite the World Cup boost. 
Overall share of viewing in the UK fell 5%, but there is a reasonable argument 
that the in-house production division has a stronger release schedule for drama 
in the second half.

Either way Crozier shouldn't waste a minute wondering about Liberty's 
intentions. Gut instinct says Liberty boss John Malone is up to something – 
paying £481m for Sky's stake in ITV looks like more than a casual flutter, even 
by his standards – butITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> should 
just get on with the job.
