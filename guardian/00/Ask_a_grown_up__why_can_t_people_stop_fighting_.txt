Some might argue humans are hard-wired to fight. I don't agree: we are 
conscious beings who have the capacity to make decisions. Many people, though, 
and through history, have thought they had to fight. Knights in the Middle Ages 
were like gang members can be today – always on the lookout for insults, they 
would rather die than be dishonoured.

People also fight to defend themselves. If a bully wants to beat you up, you 
have the choice of running away or standing your ground. In our society, we 
have police forces who try to control bullies, sometimes by force. On a larger 
scale, countries fight to conquer land or to prevent being overrun themselves. 
In the second world war, Britain thought Hitler and the Nazis had to be 
stopped, and the only way to do that was to fight.

We can prevent fighting by limiting weapons or finding nonviolent ways to end 
disputes. It's not going to be easy to create a world where both sides prefer 
peace, but we have to try.
