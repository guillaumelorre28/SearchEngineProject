It was a wonder of the western world: a tribute to the hidden grottos and 
secluded springs of classical mythology. Yet Alexander Pope’s great folly, a 
network of caves and tunnels built below his home on the banks of theRiver 
Thames at Twickenham 
<http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.php?aid=9&cid=1&ctid=2>, is largely 
forgotten.

A plan to restore the grotto, now grubby after three centuries of neglect, 
will get under way this month with the support of heritage grants, leading 
conservationists, fans of Pope’s poems and essays such as formerUniversity 
Challengepresenter Bamber Gascoigne and television gardener Monty Don, and 
schoolchildren who study inside the school that stands above it.

“The repair work we now have permission to carry out on the Grade II-listed 
structure will bring it back to life,” said Mike Cherry, an historian and 
secretary ofPope’s Grotto Preservation Trust 
<http://www.popesgrotto.org.uk/trust.html>. “It is very dirty, since it is 
lying under 300 years of dust. Little has been done to it since Pope died in 
1744. It needs proper lighting to show the quartz and other precious stones and 
metals to best effect, and some of the decoration is not entirely secure.”

The trust is holding a symposium, to be opened by Gascoigne, at the site on 21 
May, Pope’s birthday, to publicise the plans and raise funds.

Pope, the reclusive literary star of 18th-century society, was the best-known 
English satirist and poet of his age, but also had an influential passion for 
landscape gardening and lobbied for the use of natural forms, rather than 
formal, geometric shapes. His grotto was built around a natural spring as a 
grand gesture and was copied across the fashionable estates of Britain, but it 
was also a place of tranquillity and mystery.

Pope recorded his feelings about it in 1741 in his Verses on a Grotto by the 
River Thames at Twickenham, composed of Marbles, Spars and Mineralscorrect:

“Where ling’ring Drops from Mineral Roofs distil,

And pointed Crystals break the sparkling Rill,

Unpolish’d Gemms no Ray on Pride bestow,

And latent Metals innocently glow.”

The grotto is the last remaining relic of Pope’s Thameside villa, built in 
1720 after his visits to Italy. The river was wider at the time and visiting 
luminaries would arrive by boat and moor at the bottom of his garden. One 
guest, Sir John St Aubyn, wrote: “I have seen Mr Pope’s grotto in which … he 
has most strictly followed nature … [He has] made it a cabinet of the natural 
history of the growth of minerals.”

Pope continually added to the grotto and by the time he died, at the age of 
56, its walls were studded with 200 geological features, including fossils, a 
stalagmite from Wookey Hole in Somerset, shells, flints, a “mother amethyst” 
from Northumberland, sections of the basalt Giant’s Causeway in Northern 
Ireland, and pieces of fossilised wood from Knaresborough in Yorkshire.

His villa was demolished in 1808 and repeated redevelopments followed over the 
next 200 years. During the 1960s the grotto functioned as a passageway for the 
school above it, allowing pupils to pass under the A310 road into an annexe. In 
2005, the boys’ school on the site set up a charitable trust to preserve the 
grotto and the first serious fundraising plans for restoration began.

It has been a long wait, but, as Pope himself wrote in his Essay on Man, “hope 
springs eternal”. Five years ago, with the grotto listed onHistoric England’s 
at-risk register <https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/heritage-at-risk/>, 
ownership of the building passed to the independent Radnor House School, which 
is also campaigning for its restoration and will hold open days over the next 
two months.

“We have a school Grotto Society which raises money and the children learn 
about its history so they can give tours,” said Rosie Gill, headteacher and a 
preservation society trustee.

“The gates are locked during the school week, but foxes sometimes get in and 
the younger children stick their heads in. There are rumours it is haunted by 
the ghost of an old teacher, but we take new kids down for a dinosaur hunt so 
they know what is down there. Some say Pope used the caves as a wine cellar, 
but we prefer to think of him using it to cross unseen over to his five acres 
of garden.”

Arts Council England has funded Giles Abbott to perform his new work, 
Alexander Pope: A Search for Perfection 
<http://gilesabbott.com/current-projects/alexander-pope/>, at the symposium.

“Pope was described as being of ‘unparalleled sweetness and gentleness’ 
despite his vicious satires,” said Abbott. “You don’t find the real Pope in his 
writing, just his opinions and his skill. It is his grotto that is his truest, 
greatest work, I believe. He was trying to recreate the landscape of his 
imagination and created what was perhaps the first British ‘museum’, in the 
classical sense of a place for the nine inspirational muses who were always to 
be found gathered around a natural spring.”
