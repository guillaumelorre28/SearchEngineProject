, directed by the young Canadian film-maker Xavier Dolan. Both Formation and 
Hello are nominated for the top award, video of the year: the others in the

.

Last year the nominations caused a spat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/21/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-twitter-feud-vma-awards>
 between Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift, after the latter took offense at Minaj 
complaining that she had not been nominated for video of the year for Anaconda. 
However, neither has been nominated this year.
