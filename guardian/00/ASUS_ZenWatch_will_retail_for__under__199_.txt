ASUS has revealed more details of its long-teased Android smartwatch, the 
ZenWatch, at the IFA conference in Germany.

Running Google’s Android Wear operating system, the watch will sport a 
320-pixel-square touchscreen housed in a stainless steel case with a leather 
strap included in the box. Unlike many smartwatches, the guts of the device are 
entirely contained within the face, letting users swap out any standard 
watchband as they see fit.

Those innards are essentially the same as most other Android Wear watches 
announced so far, with the main processor, a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 SoC, being 
shared with Samsung’s Gear Live, and LG’s G Watch and G Watch R. The watch will 
also come with 512MB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage, and a microphone and 
heart rate sensor.

The heart monitor is claimed to let the watch measure “relaxation levels” 
using a built in “Wellness” app, providing users with a single relaxation score 
based on the results, along with tips for how to reduce stress. The app also 
generates a combination of other stats, including steps taken, calories burned, 
activity duration, heart rate, and exercise intensity. It will retail at “under 
£199” before Christmas.

Alongside the ZenWatch, ASUS also announced a new entry in its EeePC line, the 
2007 range of super-cheap, super-small laptops that kickstarted the “netbook” 
craze. The EeeBook, a £169.99, 11.6 inch Windows 8.1 laptop with a full-size 
keyboard, will go on sale in November.
