When Alt-J unveiled their new single, Every Other Freckle 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Q_pNdMeGg>, last week, there was one lyric 
that stood out. “Turn you inside out and lick you like a crisp packet,” crooned 
Joe Newman suggestively – a phrase at odds with the group’s geeky exterior, but 
very much in touch with their raunchier side. Especially when you consider the 
meaning behind the lyrics to theirdebut single, Tessellate 
<http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/altj/tessellate.html>.

Alongside love and pain, sex is a topic covered so frequently that musicians 
must find new and vivid ways of describing their virility and prowess – and if 
that means comparing their lover to a bag of salt and vinegar McCoy’s then so 
be it. There are some lines, however, that aren’t so endearing. So, just as 
literature has its own Bad Sex award –given to the author of 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/poll/2013/dec/03/bad-sex-awards-extracts-poll>
 the most egregious passage of sexual description in a novel – here we trawl 
pop music’s archives to pick out some equally bizarre erotic phrases from 
lyricists who should know better.

1. Radiohead – Thinking About You <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG3R7conSuc>

Been thinking about you, and there’s no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I’m playing with myself, and what do you care?

No long, unwieldy metaphors for Thom Yorke here. The image of the Radiohead 
frontman in such a compromising situation may not be particularly pleasant, but 
at least this Pablo Honey track is direct. Though his lyrics have become 
increasingly ambiguous since, Yorke also claimed that Black Star was about 
having sex in the morning (“It’s the best time to have it. Especially if you 
have brushed your teeth before,”said Thom 
<http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7041>, apparently). 

2. Prince – Dead On It 
<http://www.wat.tv/audio/prince-dead-on-it-418pj_3i2x1_.html>

All the sisters like it when you lick ’em on the knees
Don’t believe me? (No)
Try it once then stop, they’ll be begging

No list of bizarre sexual lyrics would be complete without Prince 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince>. Whether it’s sharing a bed with a 
new lover or describing his sexual organs as a “sugarcane”, the Purple One’s 
almost pornographic output has seen him outline every scenario imaginable, 
including some you maybe haven’t thought of before, such as in this whole verse 
about licking knees.

3. Led Zeppelin – The Lemon Song <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyhu2ysqKGk>

Squeeze me, baby, till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, I’m gonna fall right out of bed

Answering the age-old question of what to do if life gives you lemons, this 
song finds Robert Plant talking about his penis as if he were the seediest of 
fruit and veg sellers. Though the phrase can be traced back to Robert Johnson’s
Travelling Riverside Blues <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrExBI7PtLc>, Plant 
became so fond of the fruity metaphor it went on to be one of his signature 
lyrics. On the BBC Sessions album, he used it inHow Many More Times 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVmv712yIF4> and Communication Breakdown 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZp-D3tHKTc>, and often included the lines in 
the Whole Lotta Love medley during live shows.

4. Justin Timberlake – Cabaret ft Drake  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFfNkYHkYU0>

Say my name, do you know 
Cause I got you saying Jesus so much,
It’s like we are laying in the manger

It may come as no surprise, but Justin thinks a lot of things are a bit like 
sex. The former Disney star has used a vast range of clunky metaphors, from 
boxing to cartoon animals, to describe his desires throughout his career. On
Strawberry Bubblegum <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRXCfOYnSZM>, Timberlake 
even tells his partner their privates are pink gum and a blueberry lollipop. 
(The most grim moment being his exclamation “I’ll love you till I make it 
pop”.) But it is this invocation of the nativity scene and the infant son of 
God that proves to be the most disturbing.

5. Amanda Palmer and the Young Punx 
– Map of Tasmania <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcoreV10hI8>


Freedom down there, I swear, do you see me smirkin’?
Do you see me wearing a merkin?
Get in the formation, let’s start triangle jerkin’

Included in the list mostly because it rhymes “merkin” with “triangle jerkin”, 
this song began as a joke to be played only once in Australia (in Aussie slang, 
“map of Tasmania” is a euphemism for female pubic hair) and is Amanda’s 
statement for freedom of expressionvia pubic hair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/feb/03/woman-pubic-hair-beyond-fashion-bikini-wax-brazilian>
. It has become, says Michael Pope, the director of the video, “a call to 
everyone, woman and man alike, to discover the courage to be themselves”.
