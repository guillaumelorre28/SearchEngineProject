 I set you the following puzzle:

You and a friend have been captured on a desert island ruled by a crazed 
mathematical despot. You will be locked in separate cells in the island’s 
prison, and then set the following task:

Every minute for an hour you will each flip a coin. The flips are 
simultaneous, and after each flip you will make a prediction as to whether the 
other person’s flip was heads or tails.

So, you both make 60 flips and 60 predictions.

The despot rules that he will kill the two of you if on any one of the 60 
predictions you areboth correct. (In other words, you both flip, both predict 
the result of the other person’s flip, and are both right). To escape with your 
lives at least one of you must predict wrongly each time.

You are given ten minutes to think up a survival strategy before being taken 
to the cells. Once you are in the cells you cannot communicate with each other, 
although you are obviously able to see the results of your own flips.

Can you guarantee your survival, and if so, how?

Solution

This puzzle seems difficult at first, requiring some kind of trick or extra 
clever strategy, but the solution is simple.

You will survive if you use the outcome of your coin flip as your prediction, 
and your friend uses the opposite of their coin flip as their prediction. (Or 
vice versa).

So, if you flip heads, you predict heads. If your friend flips heads, they 
predict tails.

Here’s the full table:

You flip H, friend flips H. So you call H, friend calls T. Only one correct 
prediction.

You flip H, friend flips T. So you call H, friend calls H. Only one correct 
prediction.

You flip T, friend flips H. So you call T, friend calls T. Only one correct 
prediction.

You flip T, friend flips T. So you call T, friend calls H. Only one correct 
prediction.

You might not have thought that the table would work out so neatly, but when 
you go through the options you will find that it does. Evil despot outfoxed!

Since this strategy always results in one correct prediction, the question 
could have been phrased with that requirement, as one reader noted:

@alexbellos <https://twitter.com/alexbellos> nice puzzle. the solution also 
works in reverse i.e. the despot insists the at least 1 person gets it correct

Of the lateral-thinking answers, I liked this one best:

@alexbellos <https://twitter.com/alexbellos> if the coins aren't fair, then 
yes, if they are fair then predict edge and you should be fine

Since coins have a 1 in 6000 chance of landing on their edge on a flat surface,
according to science.... <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhRvE..48.2547M>

Hope you enjoyed the puzzle, I’ll be back in two weeks.
