Sacha Modolo won stage 17 of the Giro d’Italia on Wednesday as the race leader,
Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador>, was 
given some respite.

Modolo (Lampre) won the 134km stage from Tirano to Lugano in a sprint finish 
ahead of Giacomo Nizzolo (Trek) in second and Luka Mezgec (Giant-Alpecin) in 
third.

The top of the general classification was unchanged, with Contador 
(Tinkoff-Saxo) leading by 4min 2sec from Mikel Landa (Astana) after finishing 
safely in 23rd place.

Fabio Aru (Astana) is third overall, 4min 52sec adrift, before Sunday’s finish 
in Milan.

Modolo said after his second win of the Giro: “On paper, the stage looked 
easy, but in reality it was hard, with a real ramp at 4km to go. I looked 
around me on the ramp and I saw lots of potential sprinters in difficulty. 
Perhaps they were more tired than me. I have one of the best lead-out trains 
going. I’m afraid of no one.”

Contador said: “In theory it was a transitional stage but it was hard. The 
road went up and down and we were riding into a headwind for most of the day. 
I’m very happy because I got through the stage safely and arrived in Lugano, 
where I live, on my home roads. I’m one day closer to Milan.”
