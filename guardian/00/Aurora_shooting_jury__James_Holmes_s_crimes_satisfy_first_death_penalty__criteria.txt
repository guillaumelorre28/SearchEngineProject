Jurors in the Aurora shooting

three required to sentence James Holmes to death.

 Twelve people died and 70 were injured in the July 2012 shooting, which took 
place at a showing of The Dark Knight Rises. Earlier this month, Holmes was
convicted on 165 counts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/16/aurora-shooting-james-holmes-murder-trial-verdict>
, including 24 for first-degree murder.

In Colorado <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado>, jurors are 
required to consider death sentence in three phases. In the first, prosecutors 
attempt to prove the crimes being considered had at least one “aggravating 
factor”.

In Holmes’s case, prosecutors attempted to prove five aggravating factors for 
most of the counts of first-degree murder against him, and jurors found at 
least one aggravating factor in each of the 24 counts.

One aggravating factor was the murder of a child younger than 12. Another 
proved by prosecutors was that Holmes ambushed his victims by “lying in wait”; 
he also created a grave risk to another person during the commission of a crime.

The jury’s verdicts, which were read by Judge Carlos Samour Jr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/16/aurora-shooting-james-holmes-murder-trial-verdict>
, brought the case to the next phase:consideration of capital punishment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/17/aurora-shooting-james-holmes-death-penalty>
. Had the jury not found aggravating factors, Holmes would have been sentenced 
to life in prison.

In the second phase, jurors will consider factors that could mitigate the 
aggravating factors. If a third phase is needed, jurors will decide whether to 
sentence Holmes to life without parole, or death.

If Holmes is sentenced to death, he will be one of four people on Colorado’s 
death row 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/16/aurora-shooting-james-holmes-murder-trial-verdict>
. The state has executed one person since 1977. Nineteen states in the US do 
not use capital punishment.
