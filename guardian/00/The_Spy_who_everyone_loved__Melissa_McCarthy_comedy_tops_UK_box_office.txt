The winner: Spy

The first properly sunny weekend of the summer is always a difficult time for 
cinema operators, as audiences shun darkened theatres in favour of parks and 
barbecues, and it’s no great surprise to see every held-over title in the top 
10 decline by at least 50% from the previous weekend.

It’s in this challenging context that Spy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/spy-review-melissa-mccarthy-hotshot-heroine>
’s sturdy debut session (£2.36m plus £198,000 in previews) must be viewed. That 
compares with a £1.59m opening salvo (plus £910,000 in previews) for the 
previous team-up between Melissa McCarthy and director Paul Feig,The Heat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/the-heat-review>. That film 
benefited from the star power of an equal-billed Sandra Bullock, whereas 
McCarthy is front and centre in Spy, supported by Rose Byrne, Jason Statham, 
Jude Law and Miranda Hart.

Feig previously directed McCarthy in Bridesmaids 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/23/bridesmaids-review> – debut of 
£2.41m plus £1.03m previews – but her role was supporting. Audiences so far are 
giving Spy a robust approval rating of 76/100 at IMDb, which is well aligned 
with the MetaCritic score of 75/100. Spy performed particularly well at Vue and 
Cineworld venues, with the two chains dominating the top 10 sites for the film. 
Vue Westfield leads the way, ahead of Vue West End and Cineworld Glasgow 
Renfrew. The film faced competition fromPitch Perfect 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/pitch-perfect-2-anna-kendrick-review>
, which is holding stronger in its fourth week of play than Spy distributor Fox 
presumably imagined when it selected a 5 June release date.

However, most of the major releases currently are action fare, with Spy 
offering a clear alternative. McCarthy’s last leading role was inTammy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/02/tammy-review-melissa-mccarthy-susan-sarandon>
 – a film that underwhelmed its audience, earning a 4.8/10 IMDb user rating. 
Tammy didn’t poison the McCarthy well, with audiences coming out in force for 
Spy, presumably reassured by the Feig brand, supporting cast and the film’s 
classic fish-out-of-water premise.

The event: Secret Cinema

Crashing straight into the top 10 despite playing at just a single venue, 
Secret Cinema’s presentation of The Empire Strikes Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/mar/11/secret-cinema-star-wars-empire-strikes-back-lost-the-force>
 grossed an impressive £304,000 in four days. The event is now playing Tuesday 
to Sunday until 27 September, so has another 16 weeks to run. In total, there 
are 100 play dates. This is a more ambitious presentation thanBack to the 
Future, which ran for 20 days 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/secret-cinema-back-to-the-future-olympic-park>
 over five weeks last August, grossing £3.37m. The Empire Strikes Back’s Secret 
Cinema debut compares unfavorably with Back to the Future’s £720,000 for its 
first four days, although the capacity of the venue this time is smaller than 
last year’s east London location.

How the ticket revenue splits between Secret Cinema and Empire Strikes Back 
distributor Fox is a topic of much speculation. If Fox pushed for too big a 
piece of the pie,Secret Cinema <https://www.theguardian.com/film/secret-cinema> 
had the option to select another film. On the other, the organiser needs an 
iconic title, now that the event is on such a gigantic scale, with a potential 
audience this year of 100,000, and a ticket price of £78.

Ever since Mad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/mad-max-fury-road-review-extravagantly-bizarre>
 andPitch Perfect 2  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/pitch-perfect-2-anna-kendrick-review>
were released on 15 May, they have been tussling for supremacy. The Barden 
Bellas convincingly won the first round, were edged out by Mad Max a week later 
over the Bank Holiday weekend, pulled ahead again in the third session and now 
find themselves behind the dusty road warriors in week four.

In terms of cumulative box-office, Fury Road has closed the gap, and is now 
£510,000 behind Pitch Perfect 2’s £16.08m. Both films seem to be heading for 
the high teens in £m, and it’s anyone’s guess which will end up on top. Mad Max 
looks more vulnerable to the arrival this weekend of heavyweight contender

Insidious: Chapter 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/insidious-chapter-3-review-solidly-made-effective-horror-sequel>
 has opened at a level exactly the same as the original film in the series, 
from 2011, but only half of the debut of the 2013 sequel. The firstInsidious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/28/insidious-review> began its life 
with £1.44m, going on to achieve a lifetime gross of £7.14m.Insidious: Chapter 2
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/12/insidious-chapter-two-review> 
began with a much more robust £2.88m, but then fell away rapidly – as you’d 
expect with a horror sequel – ending up with a similar total, £7.24m. The worry 
for distributor eOne is that Chapter 3, having begun with a number identical to 
the first film, may now burn out at a rate similar to the second. On the other 
hand, Chapter 3 will have been knocked by the weekend sun, and the missing 
audience may now catch up with it.

The flop: Survivor

Landing outside the top ten, generic-appearing Survivor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/survivor-review-milla-jovovich-goes-rogue-in-baffling-action-thriller>
 struggled to define itself for audiences. The cast, led by Milla Jovovich, 
Pierce Brosnan and Dylan McDermott, doesn’t add up to a very compelling 
proposition, and, without a strong hook, it was hard to imagine a large 
theatrical audience for this title. So it has proved, with a limp £130,000 
debut from 176 cinemas, yielding a £740 average. Survivor currently has a weak 
MetaCritic score of 26/100, and an IMDb user approval rating of 5.4/10.

With no major blockbusters released at the weekend, takings are an 
unsurprising 29% down on the equivalent frame from 2014. This is now the third 
session in a row with box office down on the year-ago equivalent weekends. 
Salvation looks to be immediately at hand with the arrival on Thursday of 
Jurassic World, starring Guardians of the Galaxy’sChris Pratt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/06/chris-pratt-jurassic-world>. The 
commercial planets look well aligned for this franchise revival from Universal.

Rival studios are giving the date a wide berth, which opens a window of 
opportunity for modest, home-grown indie flicks London Road (adapted from the 
National Theatre stage production) and a nationwide roll-out forQueen and 
Country
