Johnston Press has launched an online platform, the hub <http://thehub.tips/>, 
in a bid to forge relationships with small businesses in areas served by its 
regional and local newspapers.

The website, which is free to access, features tips, videos, infographics and 
advice guides along with resources for business people.

According to the publisher’s press release, the hub “marks the launch of 
Johnston Press’s content marketing strategy for its business-to-business arm”.

It sits alongside JP’s digital marketing service for small and medium-sized 
enterprises,Digital Kitbag <http://www.digitalkitbag.com/>, and follows 
research conducted by the company with theCentre for Economics and Business 
Research <http://www.cebr.com/>. 

JP, with 208 paid-for titles including 13 dailies, claims to reach one in 
three people in the UK plus 300,000 local business customers.

Chief executive Ashley Highfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield> calls the initiative “a 
major step” to transform the company’s approach to business-to-business 
marketing.

Our news brands, he says, “have always recognised that small business is the 
lifeblood of all communities they serve and today’s launch of the hub enables 
us to continue to connect with our local businesses in a fresh and relevant 
way”.
