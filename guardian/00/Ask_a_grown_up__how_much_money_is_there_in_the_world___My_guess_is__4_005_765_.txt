Grown-ups cannot agree on what "money" really is. Originally people used 
precious commodities such as gold and silver as money, and each coin was worth 
the value of the metal it contained. Some people still believe that gold is the 
only real money, and that paper money is a sort of pretend money, called fiat 
money.

But even this is not correct. A prime minister called Margaret Thatcher tried 
to control the amount of money in circulation, but failed because her advisers 
hadn't realised that banks can create new money just by lending it to their 
customers. This is called account money, and is electronic data on computer 
systems.

According to the Bank of England, all this comes to about £1.7tn – and that's 
just for the UK, or £30,000 for every person in the country. The more money 
banks produce, the less value it has. Personally, I'd prefer to have lots of 
gold.
