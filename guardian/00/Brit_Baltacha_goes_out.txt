Britain's sole interest in the Australian Open failed to last beyond the first 
day afterElena Baltacha <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/elena-baltacha> was 
blown away by 15th seed Alexandra Stevenson.

Baltacha, who made the third round of Wimbledon last year, could not cope with 
the power of the 22-year-old from California and lost 6-1, 6-4.

Stevenson, who has only once before made the second round here at Melbourne 
Park, is a star in the making who rose from 60th to 18th in the world in 2002.

She peppered Baltacha with aces, defended two crucial break points while 2-0 
up in the first set and left the 19-year-old flat-footed and frustrated with a 
searing passes.

Baltacha was guilty of making crucial errors at crucial times. 

She fell a break down in the first set after double faulting on her own 
advantage and then in the second, having fought back valiantly to level at 3-3, 
she double faulted again to hand Stevenson three break points.

Another of the young brigade with a delightful single-handed backhand, 
Stevenson pounced to claim the crucial break that sealed the match.
