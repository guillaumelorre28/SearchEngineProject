ITV1 picked up the wooden spoon in a tight five-way 9pm ratings scrap last 
night, Tuesday 9 February, with Amanda Holden's Fantasy Lives the least-watched 
show in the slot on the main analogue terrestrial channels.

The final part of Amanda Holden's Fantasy Lives, in which the Britain's Got 
Talent judge tried out as a country singer, drew just 2.1 million viewers and 
an 8% share, the worst performance of its three-part run, according to 
unofficial overnight ratings.

BBC1's post-apocalypse drama Survivors won the 9pm hour, but with a relatively 
low 3.8 million viewers and a 15% share.

One Born Every Minute, Channel 4's new documentary series about a maternity 
unit in Southampton, debuted with 2.9 million viewers and 12%, with another 
440,000 tuning in an hour later on digital catchup service Channel 4 +1.

There was a two-way tie for third place, between BBC2's science documentary 
How Earth Made Us and Channel Five's ratings banker CSI, which both brought in 
2.8 million viewers and an 11% share.

ITV1 also struggled in the 8pm hour, drawing just 2.5 million viewers and a 
10% share for the start of a new series of Cops with Cameras.

This put it behind both BBC1, which drew 6.4 million viewers and 25% of the 
audience for Holby City – up 500,000 on last week, but with the same share – 
and BBC2, whose offbeat cookery show The Hairy Bikers: Mums Know Best attracted 
3.3 million and 13%.

Jo Frost: Extreme Parental Guidance, in which the Supernanny presenter 
dispensed advice on a variety of family problems, started an eight-part run 
with 2.1 million viewers and an 8% share, with another 271,000 on Channel 4 +1.

Five's Ice Road Truckers had 1.3 million viewers and 5% in the 8pm hour.

Emmerdale was a rare bright spark for ITV1, winning 7.3 million viewers and a 
32% share at 7pm and beating BBC1's The One Show, with 5.5 million and 24%.

At 7.30pm, EastEnders gave BBC1 the day's biggest audience – 9.8 million 
viewers and a 41% share – while ITV1's The Krypton Factor drew 2.6 million and 
11%.

The first part of Five's new cookery course, Chinese Food in Minutes, with 
chef Ching-He Huang, served up 1 million and 4% at the same time.

Later in the evening, Shameless brought 2.4 million and 13% in the 10pm hour, 
with another 259,000 on Channel 4 +1.

The BBC news won the ratings tussle at 10pm, as usual, with 4.8 million 
viewers and a 23% share, while ITV's News at Ten drew 2 million and 10%.

A CSI: Miami repeat drew 1.3 million and 7% to Five, while BBC2's documentary 
Muslim Driving School attracted 800,000 viewers and a 4% share over half an 
hour.

BBC3's new show Last Woman Standing, in which female athletes tour the world 
to take on tribal challenges, drew 375,000 viewers, a 1.5% share of the 
multichannel audience in the 9pm hour.

In the same slot, the third episode ITV2's US import The Vampire Diaries was 
watched by 494,000, a 2% multichannel share, down 353,000 viewers on its launch 
episode last week. Another 132,000 tuned in an hour later on catchup service 
ITV2 +1.

On Sky1, the Battlestar Galactica prequel Caprica drew 142,000 viewers, a 0.6% 
multichannel share, down 27,000 on the first episode shown last week.

A narrative repeat of EastEnders at 10pm on BBC3 also performed strongly, 
attracting 872,000 viewers and a 4.2% multichannel share.

The documentary True Stories: Mafia Hunters brought 195,000 to More4 between
