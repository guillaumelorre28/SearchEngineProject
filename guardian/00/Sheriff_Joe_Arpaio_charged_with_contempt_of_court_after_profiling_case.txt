The notorious Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> sheriff 
Joe Arpaio has been charged with criminal contempt of court for ignoring a 
judge’s order in a racial-profiling case, leaving the 84-year-old lawman in a 
tough spot two weeks before election day as he seeks a seventh term.

The US Department of Justice promised two weeks ago that it would prosecute 
Arpaio

, sheriff of metropolitan Phoenix, but the misdemeanor count was not officially 
filed against him until Tuesday, when Susan Bolton, a US district judge, signed 
it.

Arpaio could face up to six months in jail if convicted. A misdemeanor 
conviction would not bar Arpaio from serving as sheriff.

His Democratic challenger, Paul Penzone, said Arpaio, through his acts of 
political defiance, had no one to blame but himself for the charge. “It’s 
another example of the sheriff putting his own personal objectives ahead of the 
best interest of the community at our expense,” Penzone said.

 Arpaio’s lawyer Mel McDonald said the sheriff will contest the charge. “We 
believe that when the final chapter is written, he will be vindicated,” 
McDonald said.

McDonald said Arpaio would not be arrested and no mugshot would be taken. He 
will plead not guilty in a court filing.

The criminal charges stem from the profiling case that Arpaio lost three years 
ago that morphed into a contempt case after the sheriff was accused of defying 
a 2011 court order to stop his signature immigration patrols.

Arpaio has acknowledged violating the US district judge Murray Snow’s order 
but insists his disobedience was not intentional.

Snow disagreed, concluding Arpaio knowingly continued the patrols because he 
believed his immigration enforcement efforts would help his 2012 re-election 
campaign.

Arpaio ran a TV political ad last week saying the Obama administration’s 
justice department planned to prosecute him because of its opposition to his 
immigration enforcement efforts.

In the past, Arpaio has walked away from criminal investigations without 
facing charges and still has managed to get re-elected.

He faced a federal investigation four years ago on allegations that he 
retaliated against two local officials and a judge at odds with him by accusing 
them of corruption.

His office also was investigated for misspending more than $100m in jail 
funds, including on those failed investigations into rival officials and his 
traffic patrols targeting immigrants who are in the country illegally.

Neither investigation led to prosecution of the sheriff or his employees. 

County taxpayers have spent $48m so far to defend Arpaio and his office in the 
profiling case. The cost is expected to reach $72m by next summer.

The contempt violation led the judge to order the creation of a 
taxpayer-funded system for compensating Latinos who were illegally detained 
when Arpaio ignored the order.

Maricopa County officials have set aside $1m for funding the system. 

A 6 December trial has been scheduled in Arpaio’s criminal contempt case.
