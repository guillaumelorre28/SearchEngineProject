After Primal Scream's Screamadelica win in 1992 and Suede's triumph in 1993, 
theMercury prize <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mercuryprize> threw up one 
of its many curveballs in its third year. The judges decided against Britpop 
favourites Blur (Parklife) and Pulp (His 'n' Hers), Paul Weller's acclaimed 
Wild Wood and the Prodigy's edgy Music for the Jilted Generation in favour of M 
People, the pop-dance act formed by ex-Ha√ßienda DJ Mike Pickering, and their 
second album Elegant Slumming, packed with chart-friendly hits such as One 
Night in Heaven and Moving on Up.
