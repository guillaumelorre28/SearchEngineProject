Henrik Stenson (Swe)

Highest Open finish 2nd 2013

Stenson suffered illness in the lead-up to the Masters and watched his caddie 
slip and seriously injure a wrist immediately before the US Open. The 
39-year-old is due some major luck. Stenson tied third at St Andrews in 2010. A 
major success seems inevitable before too long, with his right to left shot 
shape an advantage here. He also looks to have the better side of the draw.

Martin Kaymer (Ger)

Highest Open finish 7th 2010

The German’s focus all year has been on this event, which is significant. When 
properly focused, Kaymer, 30, is hard to beat. He has tasted success before at 
St Andrews, when claiming the Dunhill Links Championship in 2007. One worry is 
how Kaymer’s high ball-flight may handle the wind. But he is adaptable and 
showed a timely return to form at his last event, the French Open.

Paul Casey (GB)

Highest Open finish 3rd 2010

Because of injury and the loss of form triggered by the same, people tend to 
forget just how talented Casey is. He didn’t reach No3 in the world rankings 
and claim 13 European Tour victories without serious ability. Casey’s St 
Andrews record is good. The 37-year-old is desperate to announce his obvious 
return to form; there would be no better platform.

Adam Scott (Aus)



Highest Open finish 2nd 2012

Has been strangely under the radar recently, a curious scenario for one of the 
best golfers in the world. Scott has Steve Williams back as caddie, which 
appeared to kick-start his form at the US Open. The value of Williams to Scott 
shouldn’t be dismissed. Scott, 34, is the Open’s Mr Consistent. He has finished 
no worse than fifth in his past three starts and should have won in 2012.
