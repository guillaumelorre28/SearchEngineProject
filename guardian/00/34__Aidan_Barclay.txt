Industry: publishing
Age: mid-40s
Salary: Aidan's father, David Barclay, and his uncle Frederick, have a 
combined value of £1bn
Star in: ascendant


Aidan Barclay <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aidanbarclay> is set to 
inherit the company created by his father, David, and uncle, Frederick.

The reclusive Barclay brothers originally made their fortune through property 
investments. It was only in the 1990s that they moved in to publishing.

They rescued the now-defunct European in 1992, bought Scotland's leading 
papers in 1996 and two years later relaunched Sunday Business.

At 65, the twin brothers who founded the business are now getting close to 
retirement.

But Aidan, who describes himself as in his mid-40s, is in pole position to 
take the helm as publisher and is beginning to regain readers after a period of 
heavy staff losses and cost-cutting.

He showed the depth of his ambition last year when he made a tentative £75m 
bid for the Express Group, pulling out at an early stage when he believed that 
the then owner, Lord Hollick, was not taking his bid seriously.

Sunday Business has suffered falling circulation and is now under a new 
editor, Nils Pratley.

Aidan, who also runs the Ritz Casino in London, has yet to prove himself in 
the cut-throat world of newspapers and the next few years should be revealing.
