Earlier today I set you these four questions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/12/can-you-solve-it-four-bookish-brainteasers>
:

1) Volumes I, II and III of a dictionary are stacked vertically side by side 
on a shelf, in that order and with spines visible in the normal way. The 
thickness of the pages in each volume is 6cm, and the thickness of the cover of 
each volume is 5mm.

What is the horizontal distance from the first page of Volume I to the final 
page of Volume III?

Solution: 8cm

Now this is embarrassing - only 25.06 per cent of you got this one right! More 
than half – 54.68 per cent – said 20cm. And you may have worked out why you 
made the mistake as soon as you saw the answer.

When books are stacked in volumes, the first page of each volume ends up on 
the right side (as you face the shelf) and the last page is on the left side. 
So to get from the first page of Vol 1 to the last page of Vol 3, you need to 
count only the thickness of the (front) cover of Vol 1, the (back) cover of Vol 
2, the pages of Vol 2, the (front) cover of Vol 2 and the (back) cover of Vol 
3. Which is 5mm + 5mm + 6cm + 5mm + 5mm = 8cm

2) Count upwards from ZERO thinking about the letters used in the names of 
numbers. The letter F appears for the first time inFOUR. The letter A first 
appears in ONE HUNDREDAND ONE.

Keep on counting, noting the first appearance of each letter in the names of 
numbers. What is the final letter that you will note down? In other words, when 
counting upwards, what is the final letter to appear in the name of a number?

Solution: C

By the time we get to 101, we have used 19 letters of the alphabet - leaving 
B, C, J, K, M, P and Q. Lets tick them off:

MILLION, BILLION, QUADRILLION, SEPTILLION, OCTILLION

So C is the last one to appear. J and K never appear in the name of any 
number. (Kazillion doesn’t count).

Again, most people got this one wrong. Your favourite choice was Q, with 22.74 
per cent, then C (19.72), B (19.44), J (11.95), P (7.65), Y (6.76), M (5.23), K 
(4.23), and D (2.29).

3) The following statement is correct

< F is the first and the seventh letter of this sentence.>

Using the sentence above as a model, fill in the gap in the following sentence 
to make it correct:

<C is the first and the [...] letter of this sentence.>

Solution: 

C is the first and the forty-sixth letter of this sentence.

4) Reorganise the letters of READING SLOW to form a single word.

Solution:

A SINGLE WORD

Not really a trick question, but required some lateral thought...
