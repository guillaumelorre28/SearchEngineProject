Nene, 44, is a striking woman with a bald head. Her life is a skein of 
tragedies, but you wouldn't know it from her spirited smile. She lowers her 
voice as she speaks.

"I have two children," she says, but her last three pregnancies resulted in 
"miscarriages", a euphemism here for an abortion.

"I had to," she explains. It was not an easy decision, but she knew that she 
could not afford another mouth to feed. In fear and desperation she went to a 
hilot, a traditional birth attendant.

"I had some bitter herbs, then jumped down the stairs," she says. After a few 
attempts she saw a patch of blood. Nene knows she was luckier than most, but 
can't help wondering if her breast cancer may be related to the toxins she 
consumed.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit organisation which works 
to advance sexual and reproductive health, nearly 1,000 women in the 
Philippines die every year because of unsafe abortions and many thousands more 
are admitted into hospitals because of abortion-related complications. Nearly 
68% of those who resort to abortions are poor.

Nene is hopeful that the reproductive health bill will help women like her 
find the information they need to prevent unwanted pregnancies. But the 
Catholic church is a major obstacle to better reproductive healthcare.

"Reproductive health and the Church don't jive," says Nene.

The church believes that the bill is an attempt to promote and legalise 
abortion in the Philippines. Rather than risk its ire, advocates of the bill 
remain silent on lifting the ban on abortion, which remains illegal even in 
cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.
