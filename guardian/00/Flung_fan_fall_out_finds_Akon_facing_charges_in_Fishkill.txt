Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> is set for an entanglement with 
the legal apparatus of the town of Fishkill, New York, having been charged with 
offences relating to his alleged hurling of a fan from the stage during a 
concert there last summer.

The R&B singer who likes to call himself "Konvict" will once again find 
himself in court after a concertgoer hit by the person Akon allegedly hurled 
into the audience filed a complaint against Akon to the Fishkill authorities.

The incident occurred at a June 3 concert at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, a 
town north of New York City. After audience members said a spectator lobbed 
something at Akon, the singer asked the crowd to point out the culprit. A 
security guard picked out a 15-year-old and sent him up to the stage, where the 
singer hoisted him onto his shoulders and flung him into the crowd.

The boy landed on Abby Rosa, who told a local newspaper the Poughkeepsie 
Journal she was later diagnosed with a concussion resulting from the falling 
boy. She said she hired a lawyer and spoke to Fishkill police about the 
incident.

Akon is scheduled to be arraigned on a misdemeanor charge of endangering the 
welfare of a minor and second-degree harassment next Monday morning, according 
to the Fishkill chief of police, Donald Williams. The singer's lawyer, Benjamin 
Brafman, released a statement a few days after the original incident saying 
there was no basis for criminal charges.

In April, Akon drew criticism for performing simulated sex with a 14-year-old 
girl at a concert in Trinidad. He later apologized, saying he didn't realize 
the girl was underage.
