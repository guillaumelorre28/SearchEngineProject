"Women have a key role in spreading the use of LLINs [long-lasting 
insecticidal nets]. As mothers, wives and caregivers they are at frontline of 
malaria control." These are the words of Amina Yahayaddeen, an eloquent and 
impassioned representative of the Federation of Muslim Women's Associations in 
Nigeria (Fomwan), a group that works "to empower women and enable them to 
impact positively on their society".

Yahayaddeen's face is bright with enthusiasm as she explains the work Fomwan 
is doing as a partner of the Malaria Consortium-led project SuNMaP. Accessing 
women in some of the most conservative Muslim communities in Nigeria – where 
women are otherwise out of reach to outsiders – to promote the use of LLINs, 
Fomwan play a crucial grassroots monitoring and advocacy role.

"We go to the communities to speak to the women. If they don't have a net or 
aren't using one we talk to them about the benefits and give them advice on 
where to get one. If they do, we see if they are hanging it properly and if 
they haven't tied it correctly we help them to do so."

Yahayaddeen goes on: "More and more women understand the benefits and want to 
use a net but often they are very poor. We are looking at working with the many 
vocational training centres in our communities to give women training in 
vocational skills so that they can buy nets with their own money and help to 
protect their family and community."CJ
