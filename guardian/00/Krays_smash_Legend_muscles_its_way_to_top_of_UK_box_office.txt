The winner: Legend

Until a year ago, Tom Hardy had mostly juggled supporting roles in major 
films, includingInception 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/10/film-review-inception-christopher-nolan>
 andThe Dark Knight Rises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/19/the-dark-knight-rises-review>, 
with lead roles in smaller movies, such asBronson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/12/bronson-film-review> and Locke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/17/locke-review-tom-hardy>. He’d 
also starred alongside Shia LaBeouf in ensemble dramaLawless 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/06/lawless-review>, with Joel 
Edgerton inWarrior 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/22/warrior-film-review>, and 
alongside Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine in action romcomThis Means War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/01/this-means-war-review>. Over the 
past year, his lead roles became increasingly high profile with The Drop, Child 
44 and Mad Max: Fury Road.

Mad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/mad-max-fury-road-review-extravagantly-bizarre>
 opened in May with £4.54m, the biggest ever for Hardy in a lead role by a 
significant margin. SinceChild 44 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/16/child-44-review-tom-hardy> had 
debuted with just £506,000 in April andThe Drop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/the-drop-review-james-gandolfinis-review-film-tom-hardy>
 with a similar £615,000 (plus £23,000 in previews) in November, many industry 
commentators viewed the Mad Max result as reflecting audience excitement about 
the franchise reboot, rather than for the actor.

 Legend – video review 
Now arrives Legend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/09/legend-review-tom-hardy-krays-reg-ron>
, which lands with a stunning £3.70m plus £1.49m in Wednesday/Thursday 
previews, for a five-day total of £5.19m.Brian Helgeland’s film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/22/legend-krays-film-tom-hardy-brian-helgeland-interview>
 certainly benefits from the UK audience’s existing awareness of, and interest 
in, the film’s subject – the Kray brothers remain the most notorious London 
gangsters. However, Hardy is also a key selling point: given his reputation as 
a highly committed actor, his performance in the dual roles of Ronnie and 
Reggie Kray exerted a powerful curiosity factor.

The success of Legend shows once again how a film can achieve more than the 
sum of its parts – as happened last autumn when Benedict Cumberbatch took on 
Alan Turing withThe Imitation Game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/08/the-imitation-game-review-script-fails-to-sizzle>
 (£16.4m at the UK box office). Hardy may have picked up fresh fans with Mad 
Max: Fury Road (£17.4m UK lifetime), further stoking interest in his Legend 
performances.


In 1990, Peter Medak’s The Krays, starring Spandau Ballet brothers Gary and 
Martin Kemp, kicked off with £606,000, on its way to a total of £3.71m.

September is viewed with caution by UK film distributors, and last year the 
top openers wereThe Boxtrolls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/the-boxtrolls-review-animated-childrens-film>
 (£2m including £689,000 in previews) andThe Equalizer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/09/the-equalizer-review-toronto-film-festival-denzel-washington>
 (£1.89m), plus event cinema presentation Billy Elliot the Musical Live 
(£1.90m). With Legend, distributor StudioCanal proves that the right film can 
connect with audiences at any time.

The runner-up: Scorch Trials

With The Hunger Games film series finally reaching its conclusion later this 
year, rival YA franchises jostle for position.Divergent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/23/the-divergent-series-insurgent-rises-up-with-54-million-at-the-us-box-office>
 has already delivered two episodes, with two more to come. The Maze Runner now 
likewise sees its second entry land before audiences with the release ofThe 
Scorch Trials 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/10/maze-runner-the-scorch-trials-review-a-ya-franchise-runs-out-of-steam>
. The film opens with an encouraging £2.45m plus £349,000 in previews, for a 
£2.8m total. That compares with £2.04m including £112,000 forits original 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/18/the-maze-runner-review-young-adult-novel>
 last October.

For comparison, the two Divergent films opened with £1.77m and £2.94m. 
However, the production budgets for these films are reported to be $85m and 
$110m, against $34m and $27m for the Maze Runner pictures. Worldwide, The Maze 
Runner achieved a handy $341m, making it a profitable investment for backers 
including Fox and Ingenious Media.

Third place: The Visit

Thanks to previews totalling £209,000, M Night Shyamalan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mnightshyamalan>’s new film The Visit  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/10/the-visit-review-m-night-shyamalans-found-footage-loser>
cracks seven figures, with combined box office of £1.03m. That’s not a bad 
result for a film with a production budget of $5m, although global marketing 
costs will dwarf that sum.

It’s hard to make valid box-office comparisons with Shyamalan’s past films, 
most of which benefited from much bigger production budgets and star names. 
It’s arguably more pertinent to look at the opening grosses for films from 
producer Jason Blum, who teams with Shyamalan on The Visit. Blum’s last 
non-sequel wasThe Gift 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/06/the-gift-review-a-sly-thriller-of-social-transgressions>
, which kicked off with £585,000. Before that wasThe Gallows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/the-gallows-review-horror-at-the-high-school-play>
, a significant commercial misstep with a debut of £336,000. More successful 
efforts includeInsidious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/28/insidious-review> and Sinister 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/04/sinister-review>, which both 
debuted with £1.44m.

 No Escape – video review 
Perhaps as a result of attention diverting to the major new releases, but also 
surely reflecting general audience indifference, many films saw big drops from 
the previous frame. Owen Wilson thrillerNo Escape 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/28/no-escape-review-owen-wilson-and-lake-bell-suffer-boggle-eyed-panic-attack>
 fell a hefty 58%, but that result positively sparkles next toMe and Earl and 
the Dying Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/me-and-earl-and-the-dying-girl-review>
, down 70%, and American Ultra, down 74%.The Transporter Refuelled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/the-transporter-refuelled-review-reboot>
 did even worse, dropping 81% from its opening session, and Meryl Streep starrer
Ricki and the Flash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/ricki-and-the-flash-review-meryl-streep>
 plunged 82%. The latter is an example of a film not being well aligned with 
the existing audience for its lead actor – the direct opposite of Legend.

The re-entry: Secret Cinema

Popping back into the Top 10 in its 15th week, Secret Cinema’s The Empire 
Strikes Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/12/secret-cinema-the-empire-strikes-back-review-the-force-is-weak-with-this-one>
 is nearing the end of its run. After 88 days, the event has grossed £5.51m, 
and looks likely to achieve a final tally of about £6.25m. The 100-date 
residency ends on 27 September.

The future

Thanks to the arrival of Legend and Scorch Trials, takings are 85% up on the 
previous disastrous session and also 57% up on the equivalent weekend from 
2014, when The Boxtrolls andPride 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/pride-film-review-miners-strike-gay-people-1984>
 were the top new releases. Legend now faces a challenge from another Working 
Title production,Everest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/02/everest-review-star-studded-adventure-proves-a-difficult-summit>
, which is achieving impressive screen averages with its current Imax previews. 
Also joining the fray is family filmBill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/13/bill-film-interview-creators-horrible-histories-william-shakespeare>
, a comedic take on Shakespeare from the Horrible Histories team.A Walk in the 
Woods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/14/nick-nolte-in-a-walk-in-the-woods>
, adapted from the Bill Bryson memoir, should play to the older audience. Dark 
comedyThe D Train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-the-d-train-jack-black>
, starring Jack Black and James Marsden, underperformed when it opened in the 
US last month.
