The cobnut <http://www.kentishcobnutsassociation.org.uk/> is a lovely 
cultivated variety of hazelnut. You can buy them fresh in their husks from 
early autumn. They make a great garnish for soups and a delicious crunchy crust 
in this recipe.

Serves 2

100g cobnuts, roughly chopped 
50g white breadcrumbs
2 chicken breasts
50g flour
1 egg, beaten well
2 large potatoes, 1cm diced
150ml olive oil
Sprig rosemary
1 clove garlic
1 lemon, halved

Mix the nuts and breadcrumbs on a flat plate, season the flour on another and 
add the egg to a third.

Dip the chicken breasts into the flour, then egg, then the cobnut mix to coat 
and leave to one side.

Dice the potatoes and add 100ml oil to a frying pan on medium heat. Test the 
temperature with a piece of potato – it should sizzle – then add the rest with 
a sprig of rosemary and the garlic.

Fry until golden and crisp (this should take about 15 minutes but keep an eye 
on it and turn the heat down if necessary to ensure they don't scorch).

Keep the potatoes somewhere warm and add the remaining oil to another pan, on 
medium heat.

Cook the chicken breasts for at least five minutes on each side, then drain on 
kitchen paper. Serve with the potatoes and a half lemon.
