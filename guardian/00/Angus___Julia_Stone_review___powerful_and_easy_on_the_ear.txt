Two years after going their separate ways, siblings Angus and Julia Stone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/13/angus-julia-stone-review-wiltons-music-hall>
 are back with an album that fails to shed much light on the tensions that 
drove them apart. Certainly their music, an easy-on-the-ear hybrid of 
blissed-out Laurel Canyon folk and eerie MOR, functions exactly as it did 
before – Angus's enervated drawl offset by Julia's little-girl-lost cry. What 
producer Rick Rubin has added, though, is power: A Heartbreak is quietly 
menacing, while the six-minute-long jam Main Street expertly channels drone 
rock through Fleetwood Mac.
