Public inquiry style hearings into key institutions in the national child 
abuse investigation are being reduced to speed up the process and refocus on 
preventing abuse now and in the future.

In an internal review published on Friday, the inquiry chair, Prof Alexis Jay, 
says she is committed to pursuing all 13 investigations into non-recent abuse 
within institutions. But in some cases, the review reveals, there will only be 
one public hearing into a key area or institution, although the single hearings 
are likely to last days or weeks.

The apparent move away from a public inquiry in the mould of the Leveson and 
Bloody Sunday inquiries may anger some participants and their lawyers, who 
pressed the then home secretary, Theresa May, for a statutory public inquiry in 
which witnesses would be forced to answer questions under oath.

In 2017 four public inquiry-style hearings will be held: two on child 
migrants, one on abuse within the English Benedictine congregation of the Roman 
Catholic church, and one on Knowl View school in Rochdale, which was linked to 
abuse by the late MPCyril Smith

Each public hearing is likely to last weeks it is understood. In the case of 
child migrants two weeks have been set aside for each hearing.

But key hearings into the late Greville Janner, the Anglican church and 
Westminster will not be held until 2018 at the earliest.

Jay’s review said the inquiry had failed to demonstrate progress overall and 
that she did not think it had carried out its work in a “timely, inclusive and 
transparent” way.

 “It was apparent to me and the panel that the inquiry could not be delivered 
through a traditional public inquiry approach alone,” she said. “Children are 
being abused and exploited today – we cannot wait until the inquiry has 
concluded before it has a positive impact on their lives … I am determined the 
inquiry makes substantial progress by 2020.”

Jay’s review also revealed that an increased programme of research and public 
seminars which will aim to deliver evidence about the current state of child 
protection. These will be based on research into how child sexual exploitation 
networks are formed - including interviews with perpetrators - and will advise 
on how to prevent abuse taking place.

The programme will include a survey of the scale of sexual abuse in 
residential schools and research with the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches 
to understand how national safeguarding policies had been implemented at a 
local level. Seminars will be held on the health sector, the criminal justice 
system and “the social and political narratives about child abuse”.

Jay said the inquiry had two equally important tasks: to unravel institutional 
failures of the past and make meaningful recommendations to keep children safe.

Friday’s review comes after a troubled period for the inquiry that has seen 
the departure of senior lawyers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/16/lawyer-quits-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-aileen-mccolgan>
, and the decision by the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association – one of the 
biggest victims’ groups –to pull out of the investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/18/child-abuse-survivors-group-withdraws-from-contrived-uk-inquiry>
 into Lambeth council because it had lost faith in the inquiry and wanted a 
more forensic, judge-led investigation.

The review reveals there will be only two public hearings into the Anglican 
church. The Church of England bishop Peter Ball wassentenced to 32 months in 
prison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/07/bishop-peter-ball-escaped-charges-mps-royal-family-intervened-court>
 last year for abusing 18 young men between 1977 and 1992.

The inquiry into the Roman Catholic Benedictine congregation will hold one 
full public hearing in December 2017. Future public hearings – the review does 
not specify how many – in connection with the archdiocese of Birmingham and the 
wider Catholic church will follow in 2018.

 In February 2017 the first public hearing will begin into the child migration 
programmes that sent children to Australia, New Zealand and Canada. There will 
be a second child migrant hearing in July.

In October 2017 a single public hearing will be held in relation to the 
Cambridge House boys’ hostel and Knowl View school in Rochdale, where more than 
25 pupils alleged they were abused by Smith and others.

The review said the Janner investigation, which has been delayed due to an 
ongoing investigation by Leicestershire police and the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission, was considering 100,000 pages of material. The public 
hearing will not be held until at least 2018.

Jay said a “robust delivery plan” was required to fulfil the terms of the 
abuse inquiry with a renewed focus on identifying the most important actions to 
protect children today.


“Since becoming chair I have spoken to many people who have been affected in 
some way by child sexual abuse … The message to me is loud and clear: this 
inquiry must deliver on its promise to expose what went wrong in the past and 
provide a safer future for today’s children,” she said.

Jay said the issue of abuse within football was being monitored and that she 
would request that the Football Association provide her with the findings of 
its review into allegations of historical abuse.
