ITV’s chief executive has admitted the broadcaster must address a slump in 
ratings, after revealing that primetime stalwarts, including Downton Abbey and 
The X Factor, had shed viewers this year.

ITV’s total revenues rose 8% in the first nine months of the year to £1.8bn, 
with advertising revenues up 6% in the first nine months to £1.16bn.

Adam Crozier <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-crozier> said the 
broadcaster would see TV ad revenue up 5% for the full year, which will be 
ITV’s “best outperformance of the market for five years”.

However, Crozier said ratings across its family of channels was “not as good 
as would like”, with its share of viewing down 5% so far this year.

“In 2015 we will focus on improving [share of viewers] and we have a strong 
programme schedule, with new and returning drama, including the second series 
of Broadchurch, as well as the Rugby World Cup,” said Crozier.

The broadcaster’s share of commercial impacts, an important measure used by TV 
advertisers, fell 6% on the main channel in the year to the end of October.

But there was a strong performance in terms of online, pay and interactive 
revenues, which grew revenue by 24% in the first nine months.

Crozier said that online, pay and interactive revenues would show double-digit 
growth again next year. Video-on-demand viewing also grew strongly, up 24% to 
497m in the first none months. Production armITV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> Studios grew revenues by 10% over 
the first nine months of the year to £609m.

The company said it would make £15m in cost savings this year.
