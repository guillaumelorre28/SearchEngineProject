Here's a back-to-the-future moment - a large regional newspaper publisher is 
planning to launch a newsprint title in a town where another large regional 
newspaper publisher has long held sway.

It looks as though an old-fashioned circulation war is likely to break out in 
January in Grantham when Local World is due to publish a paid-for weekly, the 
Grantham Target, in opposition to the established Johnston Press weekly, the the
Grantham Journal <http://www.granthamjournal.co.uk/>.

So Local World's chief executive, David Montgomery, will be going head-to-head 
with Johnston's chief executiveAshley Highfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield>.

The new paper, an addition to Local World's Target series in Lincolnshire, 
will have a cover price of 50p compared to Johnston's 95p Journal.

Lincolnshire Media publisher Steven Fletcher, in announcing the launch at the 
Lincolnshire Echo business awards, said the Target will launch on 7 January 
with a companion website due to go live in December.

It will be edited by Adam Moss, who already edits the Boston and Sleaford 
Targets. He is quoted in the Boston Target as saying:

"The Targets are a well-known brand in large parts of Lincolnshire and we feel 
Grantham is the ideal place to go into next. It's a very newsy area, with a 
real mix of residents...

"I'm looking forward to getting stuck in and making sure we give a voice to 
communities, individuals, and special interest groups across Grantham."

According to the most recent ABC figures, for the first half of this year, the 
Boston and Seaford Targets together sold an average of 12,464 copies.

The Grantham Journal has not had an audited sales figure since 2013. At the 
time, its average weekly sale was 14,072.
