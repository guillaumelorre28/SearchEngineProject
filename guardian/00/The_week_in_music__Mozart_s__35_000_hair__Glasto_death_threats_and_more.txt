Emily Eavis got death threats for booking Kanye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/28/glastonbury-emily-eavis-death-threats-kanye-west>

Repeat after me: Kanye West performing at Glastonbury is not the end of the 
world. That didn’t stop people sending festival organiser Emily Eavis death 
threats about booking the rapper to headline one night of this year’s event, or 
signing an online petition to have him struck off the lineup. Eavishas already 
written about

 discovering, perhaps for the first time, why reading the bottom half of the 
internet often feels like stepping right into the fiery depths of hell, and 
this latest piece of news seems to support her initial shock.

Eurovision happened, and Sweden won 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/24/swedish-eurovision-win-spares-russian-conservatives-an-awkward-moment-gay-sex>

I’ll spare you the gory details, but Austria hosted the 60th annual 
celebration of musical Euro-kitsch on Saturday – in a touching gesture of 
appreciation, the host country picked up precisely zero points from fellow 
voters. Sweden won, with a dance-pop song that sounded half-finished and a 
performance that featured an animated pencil drawing and a man resembling a 
budget Enrique Iglesias in leather trousers.

BB King’s death sparked a dispute between his children and estate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/25/bb-king-may-have-been-poisoned-daughters-allege>

BB King’s death last week hit his fans hard. The legacy of his contribution to 
the blues has this week been slightly sullied by a public dispute between his 
children and his estate, which has played out in a series of back-and-forth 
statements. Two of King’s 11 children wrote in affidavits that they believed 
their father had been poisoned, before the claims were swiftly dismissed by 
King’s estate’s lawyer. In this case, the musician’s estate and his offspring 
aren’t one and the same, as they often are.

Michael Jackson’s Neverland ranch is up for sale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/29/michael-jacksons-former-home-neverland-ranch-on-sale-for-100m>

Are you rich? If so, and you can’t decide what to do with the spare $100m 
(£65.5m) burning a hole in your deep pockets, you may be keen to spend it on 
Jacko’s former home and grounds. Sadly, the zoo and amusement park have been 
removed, and you may never be able to separate the property from its 
association with a series of child sex abuse allegations lodged against Jackson 
before his death in 2009, but don’t write it off quite yet.

Morrissey praised Ireland’s referendum on gay marriage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/25/morrissey-irish-gay-marriage-vote-animal-rights>

The singer expressed his happiness with the world’s first ever popular vote in 
favour of gay marriage. But he didn’t leave it there. This wouldn’t be a 
Morrissey story without a footnote from him on the treatment of animals – a 
sweet little addendum to remind everyone that even if you support gay marriage, 
you’re still a waste of space yet to “welcome yourself into the 21st century” 
if you haven’t sorted out all aspects of animal abuse and the fur industry.

Azealia Banks was cast in a film, to be directed by Wu-Tang’s RZA

A heartfelt so-called skit <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPftrlfMrRg> on 
her Fantasea mixtape may be the closest Banks has previously come to showing 
fans her acting chops, but that’s set to change. The Harlem rapper has beencast 
as the lead character in Coco <http://time.com/3897588/azealia-banks-coco/>, a 
rap-based drama to be directed by RZA and feature Jill Scott and Common. Will 
this be what it takes to convince her detractors that she means business, and 
has moved on from her past Twitter spats? We’ll see.
AZEALIA BANKS (@AZEALIABANKS) 
Today was my first day on the movie set and I had a blast !!! Such a change 
from what I'm used to but it's really fun!

Angelo Badalamenti is going to score the Twin Peaks reboot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/25/angelo-badalamenti-compose-new-music-twin-peaks-score>

It’s all coming together now. The forthcoming season of Twin Peaks not only 
has original director David Lynch on board, but also composer Badalamenti, who 
wrote the music and generally created the sonic style that we’ve come to 
understand as “Lynchian” today. Someone get me a slice of cherry pie, because 
this should be good.

A lock of Mozart’s hair fetched £35,000 at auction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/25/wolfgang-amadeus-mozart-hair-lock-sotheby-auction>

A lock of the composer’s hair, wrapped around a note about its origins and 
kept safe in a locket, may sound like the most twee gift for a fan of period 
dramas. But it’s also hugely valuable, and was put up for auction at Sotheby’s 
on Thursday. Rather than sell for the estimated £12,000 (seriously, who are the 
people buying stuff like this?)it went for a solid £35,000

Daniel Barenboim designed a new kind of piano 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/26/daniel-barenboim-reveals-radical-new-piano-design-ive-fallen-in-love-with-it>

The classical pianist showed off his new piano to a few journalists this week, 
and we’ve got the video to prove it. Though it looks similar to the average 
concert grand piano, Barenboim swapped the traditional Steinway’s diagonal 
strings for straight ones that run in parallel lines. Whether or not the 
average listener will be able to tell the difference is another matter, but 
congrats to Barenboim in any case.
