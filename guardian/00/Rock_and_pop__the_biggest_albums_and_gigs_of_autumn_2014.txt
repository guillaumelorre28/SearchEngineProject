Pharrell

The promotional blitzkrieg for Pharrell Williams’s second studio album, Girl, 
has included not just this global arena tour but a Williams-curated art 
exhibition at Paris’s Gallerie Perotin and the launch of a fragrance by Comme 
des Garcons; such are the spoils of being one of the defining pop figures of 
our times. The 10m-selling Happy will doubtless make an appearance on the 
setlist, but rumours insist that, controversially, so will Blurred Lines: the 
furore over which apparently inspired this “feminist almost-concept” album in 
the first place.Alexis Petridis

Mercury nominations <http://www.mercuryprize.com/>

The Mercury prize has lost a little of its spark over the last few years: a 
lack of on-the-night drama combined with strangely indie-centric shortlists has 
left the event struggling to seem relevant. Last year’s bash was memorable only 
for the fact the host mispronounced the winner James Blake’s name as James 
Blunt, so clearly there is room for improvement here. As for the music: expect 
nominations for Damon Albarn’s Everyday Robots, FKA Twigs’s LP1, Kate Tempest’s 
Everybody Down and whatever Elbow/Wild Beasts/Metronomy have released this year.

Chris Brown – X

Perhaps understandably, there’s been a great deal of talk about maturity and 
moving on from R’n’B star Brown recently: his forthcoming sixth album 
apparently sees him ditching the pop-rave production and autotune in favour of 
a more “classic soul sound”. Whether it can succeed in distracting attention 
from his permanent residency in the tabloids is a moot point, but clearly 
plenty of his fellow urban stars don’t consider him too toxic: Lil’ Wayne, 
Kendrick Lamarr, Usher, Rick Ross and Nicky Minaj are among X’s guest stars.AP

 Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: I Can’t Give You Anything but Love 
Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga <https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga> – 
Cheek to Cheek

The question of whether humanity really requires yet another album on which a 
latterday pop star tangles with the Great American Songbook hangs a little 
heavy over Cheek to Cheek. That said, there’s a weird chemistry between Gaga 
and the 88-year-old Bennett. Either way,boosted by the pair’s appearance 
together in H&M’s Christmas ad campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/aug/27/lady-gaga-tony-bennett-hm-christmas-campaign-2014>
 and not one but two TV specials, it’s clearly going to be ubiquitous as 
Christmas lurches into view.AP

Alt-J – This is All Yours

Miley Cyrus’s recent live shows were stuffed with curious moments, from Dylan 
covers to a 30ft inflatable of the singer’s deceased dog. There was also a 
short video featuring the pop moppet gyrating to Fitzpleasure, a track by 
experimental indie bandAlt-J <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alt-j>. 
Clearly, the admiration is mutual. Hunger of the Pine, the first track from 
Alt-J’s second album, featured a Miley Cyrus sample: she takes her place on 
This is All Yours alongside sitars, a track about John Hurt’s death in Alien 
and the thought-provoking offer to “turn you inside out and lick you like a 
crisp packet”.AP
This is All Yours, 22 September.

Aphex Twin – SYRO <http://warp.net/records/aphex-twin/syro-listening>

It was announced firstly via a mysterious green blimp 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/18/aphex-twin-teases-return-symbol-london-new-york>
 hovering over South London, then with a tweeted link accessible only through 
the deep web – Richard D James knows a thing or two about stoking excitement 
around a release. Not that he needed any help here: the thought of hearing the 
first Aphex Twin studio album since 2001’s Drukqs should be enough to get 
electronic music fans salivating, and a first listen suggests their hunger for 
bafflingly rhythmic, headspinning compositions called things like 4 bit 9d 
api+e+6 [126.26] will be more than sated.TJ
SYRO, 22 September.

Leonard Cohen – Popular Problems

News of Leonard Cohen’s 13th studio album was kept under wraps: the first the 
world knew about it was a month before its release, when the Finnish accountant 
who runs Cohen’s official website mentioned its existence at a Dublin fan 
convention. His second album in two years – its predecessor, Old Ideas, topped 
the charts in 14 countries – is scheduled to come out the day after Cohen’s 
80th birthday. He is, as Rolling Stone pointed out a few years back, making 
music from and about “an uncharted age” for a rock musician, and, if the couple 
of tracks he’s debuted thus far are anything to go by, doing it with enviable 
panache.AP

 Jessie Ware’s Tough Love 
Jessie Ware <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jessie-ware> – Tough Love

This followup to Jessie Ware’s 2012 debut Devotion is another hushed, 
sophisticated affair that aims to slowly seduce you rather than brashly demand 
attention. The list of collaborators makes a bit of noise, however, from 
futuristic R&B supremo Miguel to Drake producer Nineteen85 and Ed Sheeran, who 
co-wrote Say You Love Me. Expect lots of shimmery falsetto and subtle 
electronic pulses as Ware once more puts the beat into downbeat.TJ
Tough Love, 6 October.

Caribou – Our Love

Canadian producer Dan Snaith has cut an enviably idiosyncratic path through 
dance music in recent years, both as Caribou and in his more 
dancefloor-friendly guise Daphni. The two tracks he’s released so far from his 
fifth album under the former name are strange, bewitching excursions into 
weirdly moving late-night electronica; the remainder feature guest appearances 
from acclaimed electro singer-songwriter Jessy Lanza and composer, 
multi-instrumentalist and sometime Arcade Fire collaborator Owen Pallett. Great 
things are expected.AP
Our Love, 7 October.

Lady Gaga <https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga>

Lady Gaga’s SXSW show in March was accused of ignoring the hits in favour of 
visual fireworks, but at the end of the day you still got to watch her being 
roasted on a spit while a “vomit artist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/24/millie-brown-vomit-artist-lady-gaga>
” puked all over the stage, and you certainly don’t get that with Two Door 
Cinema Club. Reports from the ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour indicate the big 
numbers have been reinstated, but the fact she performs dressed as a 
psychedelic squid, and from inside the grasp of a giant glass fist, suggests 
she’s not about to rein things in performance-wise.TJ

 Taylor Swift: Shake It Off 
Taylor Swift <https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift> – 1989

Live web streams! Fevered fan reaction! A video with depressing elements of 
cultural appropriation! It can only be the return of a massive pop star, and 
Taylor Swift is as massive as they come right now. This album promises to 
follow in the footsteps of lead single Shake It Off, with Swift ditching her 
country roots in a quest to make her “first straight-up pop album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/19/taylor-swift-new-album-1989-single-shake-it-off>
”. Which is great, as long as it doesn’t involve more twerking.TJ

Lil’ Wayne – Tha Carter V

For two years, Lil’ Wayne has been suggesting that his 11th album will be his 
last: offering an excuse more commonly given by MPs than rappers, he claims he 
wants to spend more time with his family. Then again, he’s also suggested he’s 
going to release an album of love songs, a collaborative album with Juelz 
Santana and another with Drake and Baby, which doesn’t sound much like a 
retirement. Either way, Tha Carter V arrives at a crucial juncture in his 
career: will it arrest claims he’s in creative decline, spurred by 2013’s 
mediocre I Am Not A Human Being II?AP Young Money, 28 October.

Pink Floyd – The Endless River

Apparently, this is Pink Floyd’s final studio album: a selection of 
ambient-inspired tracks begun during the recording of their 1994 album The 
Division Bell, recently divested of their original title – The Big Spliff – and 
completed by the band’s surviving members David Gilmour and Nick Mason as a 
kind of eulogy to late keyboard player Rick Wright. A degree of consternation 
has been caused by the notion of Pink Floyd making a new album out of what are 
essentially 20-year-old outtakes, but, equally, there’s the sense that Gilmour 
and Mason – hardly the most prolific artists – wouldn’t bother if they didn’t 
think they had something worth putting out.AP
Month of release for The Endless River may change.

Bob Dylan – Shadows in the Night/The Basement Tapes Complete

Rumours have abounded that Dylan is preparing to release a new album called 
Shadows in the Night ever since he uploaded a cover of Frank Sinatra’s 1945 hit 
Full Moon and Empty Arms to his website, along with an image that looked as if 
it might be album artwork influenced by the classic jazz label Blue Note. More 
concrete plans come in the shape of Volume 11 of The Bootleg Series: a six-CD 
set that fully documents Dylan and The Band’s legendary “Basement Tapes” 
sessions from 1967.AP
Basement Tapes Complete, 3 November.

Foo Fighters – Sonic Highways

Dave Grohl has been talking up the Foo Fighters’ eighth album as a record 
“made in a way no one’s ever done before”. This turns out to mean that each of 
the eight songs has been recorded in a different US city, with different “local 
legends” appearing on the tracks – Joe Walsh of the Eagles and Joan Jett among 
them – and an accompanying eight-part TV series details the band’s journey 
around the country. How much effect this has had on the sound of the album 
remains to be seen, although the presence of New Orleans’ Preservation Hall 
Jazz Band on one track suggests a certain pushing of boundaries.AP
Sonic Highways, 10 November.

Jack White

White’s last live performances in the UK were pretty strange stuff: there was 
a secret gig in London in collaboration with theatre group Punchdrunk where the 
audience were required to wear surgical masks and gowns and White concluded the 
show by being carried to an ambulance on a stretcher, and a chaotic Glastonbury 
appearance during which he claimed to have been visited by the spirits of 
Abraham Lincoln and Elvis Presley. Whether or not those are a foretaste of his 
forthcoming dates, he is invariably a compelling live performer and his current 
band make a hell of racket.AP

 Banks: Brain 
Banks

LA-based Jillian Banks is apparently 2014’s most blogged-about artist and her 
debut album Goddess has been greeted with critical acclaim. She’s certainly not 
the only artist around seeking to explore a downtempo, experimental type of 
R&B, but her take on it is particularly bewitching.AP

The Who 50th Anniversary

Insert obligatory joke about dying before you get old here if you must, or 
indeed, raise a cynical eyebrow and point out that (a) their 50th Anniversary 
was actually last year and (b) the Who have, of course, announced a final tour 
before, a mere 32 years ago. But if it doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the 
band – Pete Townshend has mooted the possibility of another studio album – the 
fact Roger Daltrey is 70 and Townshend 69 indicates that this may well be the 
last time the Who embark on a major tour.AP
