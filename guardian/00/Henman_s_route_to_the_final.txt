Jiri Novak (Cz) 

 Age  26  World ranking  24

Efficient Czech baseliner, more at home on clay than any other surface. 
Reached the semi-finals in Auckland last week but has never been beyond the 
fourth round of a grand slam.

 Dominik Hrbaty  (Slovak)

 Age 24  World r anking 24

An explosive forehand and metronomic consistency from the back of the court 
make this former French Open semi-finalist a dangerous opponent.

 Stefan Koubek  (Aut)

 Age 25  World ranking 65

The straw-haired Austrian is a patchy performer. Most at home several feet 
behind the baseline, he is already putting in his best ever performance here 
having made the fourth round.

 Fernando Gonzalez  (Chile)

 Age 21  World ranking 140

The 6ft right-hander had never won a match here before this year. In 2002 he 
has already come through qualifying and won three main-draw matches. The 
biggest surprise of all.

 Tim Henman  (GB)

 Age 27  World ranking 8

Three times a semi-finalist at Wimbledon, elsewhere the British No1 has never 
got beyond the fourth round of a grand slam - but could make the breakthrough 
in Melbourne next week.

 Jonas Bjorkman  (Swe)

 Age  29  World ranking  64

Last big year was 1997, when beaten in the US Open semi-final. Since then 
success has mostly been in doubles, but he has a winning record against Henman.

 Thomas Johansson  (Swe)

 Age  26  World ranking  18

Apart from Henman the most accomplished and consistent of the group. He has 
the trademark Swedish game: relentless counter-punching from the baseline.

 Adrian Voinea  (Rom)

 Age  27  World ranking  107

Surprise winner over the young American hotshot Taylor Dent in the third 
round, this Romanian journeyman has already exceeded his highest expectations 
here.
