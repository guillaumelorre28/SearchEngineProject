The ancient Babylonians were probably the first culture to create 
multiplication tables, more than 4,000 years ago. They did their mathematics on 
clay tablets, some of which have survived until today. As their civilisation 
grew, they needed to do more and more sophisticated mathematics to help them 
build and trade. In order to speed up calculations, merchants would carry 
around tablets with these multiplication tables on, much as modern-day 
engineers might carry calculators in their pockets.

Those who could remember these tables by heart were able to trade more 
successfully than those who had to pull out the tablets. But spare a thought 
for the ancient Babylonian students. Because they counted in powers of 60 
rather than the powers of 10 we use today, they were required to know their 
sums all the way up to their 59 times table.
