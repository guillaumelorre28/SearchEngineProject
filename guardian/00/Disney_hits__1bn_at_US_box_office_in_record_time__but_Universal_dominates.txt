The studio still has Star Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii> – the bookies’ 
favourite to be the year’s highest-grossing movie – to come in 2015, but has 
also released a number of box-office bombs. The George Lucas-produced Strange 
Magic, an animated fairy tale set to a pop-music score, was part of the for 
$4.05bn package that brought Star Wars rights-holder Lucasfilm to the studio in 
October 2012. It made just $12m in receipts. Futuristic fantasyTomorrowland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/tomorrowland-review-george-clooney-turns-mr-incredible-as-a-man-genius-world-saver>
, starring George Clooney as an inventor who travels with a teenage girl to a 
strange utopia, is expected to lose up to $140m.

Disney would usually be expecting a box-office bounce from the release of its 
second Marvel film of the year, but doubts overAnt-Man

Edgar Wright was ditched in favour of Peyton Reed, who directed Jim Carrey’s 
middling Yes Man.Early trailers have also failed to find favour with fans
