The prospect of a Donald Trump presidency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/19/donald-trump-republican-nominee-convention-video>
 is a scary one, but at least now we have Mike Pence to soften the blow. Sure, 
Trump’s running mate might be a terrifying hard-right creationist fanatic who’s 
been dubbed “the most anti-abortion VP candidate ever”, but on the plus side 
he’s also an amateur film critic who in 1999 declared Disney’s Mulan to be “
Walt Disney’s attempt to add childhood expectation to the cultural debate over 
the role of women in the military 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/mike-pence-disney-mulan-mischievous-propaganda-us-presidential-election-film>
”. So that’s something.

Welcome, then, Mike Pence, to the pantheon of political cineastes. Here are 
your new peers.

 Only connect … Donald Trump identifies with Citizen Kane. 
Early last decade, film-maker Errol Morris interviewed Trump about Citizen Kane
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/22/citizen-kane-voted-greatest-ever-american-film-bbc-poll>
, and Trump revealed that he connected with “the wealth, the sorrow, the 
unhappiness”, before adding: “The table getting larger and larger, with he and 
his wife getting further apart as he got wealthier? Perhaps I can understand 
that.” It seems like a different Trump altogether – he’s thinner, paler, more 
prone to introversion – but his close reading of the movie does at least set up 
the prospect of a fortnightly Don and Mike’s Sad Old Man Film Club podcast if 
they lose the election.

 Nihilism …watch a trailer for Fight Club <https://youtu.be/BdJKm16Co6M> 
During a 1999 discussion with Roger Ebert, Bill Clinton veered off into a long 
tangent aboutFight Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,102483,00.html>
. Disagreeing with the film’s central argument that material possessions are an 
inherent barrier to personal identity, he pointed out: “It’s important not to 
disparage prosperity, for it gives people opportunity and leisure and security 
… It’s not all there is to life, but it creates the possibility of fashioning a 
life that has integrity and meaning.” He also took issue with the film’s 
nihilism: “There are things outside yourself to throw yourself into. You don’t 
have to get beat up by somebody, you know.”

North Korea’s late Dear Leader was a notorious cinephile who first attempted 
to revolutionise his country’s film-making industry by writing a 344-page 
treatise entitled On the Art of the Cinema and then, when that failed,
kidnapping a South Korean director and keeping him prisoner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/21/kim-jong-il-movie-star-kidnap-plot-north-south-korea-godzilla>
 for eight years. Kim was also a fan of western cinema, singling out James Bond 
and the films of Elizabeth Taylor as his favourites. In 2010, he even madeBend 
It Like Beckham <https://youtu.be/XsmbObwStSQ> the first western film ever to 
be broadcast on North Korean state TV – either because it depicts a mobilised 
working class, or because Keira Knightley is lovely.

The Wisconsin senator hates The Lego Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/dec/01/10-best-films-2014-the-lego-movie>
. He really, really hates The Lego Movie. Last year he was filmed telling an 
audience that he’d heard grievances from voters about the film. One of them, he 
said, was upset when he took his six-year-old children to see the film, only to 
discover that the villain was “Evil Mr Businessperson”. “It’s insidious how 
they start that propaganda early,” he said. And they told us that everything 
was awesome. For shame.

Remember in The Dark Knight, when the Joker invades Bruce Wayne’s apartment 
and the old, balding white-haired man says: “We’re not intimidated by thugs”? 
That’s Vermont senator Patrick Leahy, and he likes Batman more than you. He 
wrote the forewords to two separate Batman graphic novels in the 1990s, and has 
been rewarded with cameo appearances in five different Batman films. Admittedly 
only one of these films was any good, but that just shows what a fan he is.

 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs … Hitler admired its technical prowess. 
Photograph: Walt Disney Company/Ronald Grant Archive 
In 1938, Roy Disney sold Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to the German 
propaganda ministry, largely on the basis that Hitler considered it one of the 
greatest films of all time. It helps, of course, that Snow White was based on a 
German folk tale, but the technical mastery of the film is reportedly what 
Hitler most admired. In fact, in 2008, a Norwegian war museum claimed to have 
discovered watercolour sketches of Bashful and Doc that were painted by Hitler 
himself in 1940.

 Moneyball … a metaphor for Labour’s front bench? 
One of Miliband’s key election tactics last year appeared to be an 
enthusiastically repeated declaration of love for the CBeebies showOctonauts 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/shows/octonauts>. This is a vast improvement on 
the ex-Labour leader’s previous attempts to discuss his love of film. “Justine 
and I went to the cinema on Saturday,” he said during an interview in 2011. “I 
inflicted a baseball film on her –Moneyball 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/24/moneyball-review> with Brad Pitt. 
She loved it. As we left a man said to me: ‘Are you Ed Miliband?’ ‘Yes,’ I 
said. He went: ‘Oh, then I’ve just lost a £50 bet with my wife.’” Stand down, 
Peter Bradshaw.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1291454,00.html>
 – the world’s greatest ever film – dodge, dip, duck, dive and dodge”. The 
world’s greatest ever film. Has a British politician ever lauded a more 
gratuitously lowbrow film?

 Kung Fu Panda … Clegg shakes a leg. 
Actually, yes. In 2013, right in the dog days of his tenure as browbeaten, Lib 
Dem party-destroying deputy prime minister,Nick Clegg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg> told LBC that Kung Fu Panda 
was “one of the greatest movies made in recent years”, adding: “I don’t want to 
belittle this. I know you’re chortling like it’s just for children, but 
actually it is incredibly funny for adults as well. The characters are 
bemusing, endearing. I challenge you, once you watch Kung Fu Panda, whether you 
are an eight-year-old child or an adult, whether you can resist getting up off 
your sofa and starting to do some kung fu chops in your living room.” That must 
be the worst of it, surely.

Nope! In 2014, David Cameron revealed that one of his favourite films is “the 
last 10 minutes of Shrek 2”. This, you remember, is the segment where a 
gingerbread man dies, a fairy explodes, everyone singsLiving La Vida Loca 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu0CUmS17fM> by Ricky Martin all the way 
through from beginning to end, a prince gets off with a transgender bartender 
voiced by Larry King and a puppy dies. You can’t deny that the man’s got taste.
