I feel incredibly connected to Athens. It’s somewhere I’ve visited every few 
years of my life. I’m originally from Iran and grew up in the UK but Athens – 
and also Sounion, which makes a great day trip out of the city – is where my 
family and I would meet up for holidays and visit friends.

We were incredibly lucky to film at the Acropolis when we made The Two Faces 
of January <https://www.theguardian.com/film/two-faces-of-january>, which I 
adapted for the screen from Patricia Highsmith’s book, and directed. I don’t 
think anyone had been allowed to shoot there for about 20 years. Initially, we 
were told that we should film “Athens” in Istanbul because of the economic 
problems at the time. But I insisted. You can’t really replicate the city and 
there was no way of building sets to get a sense of the Acropolis!

There are great “tourist” cities that feel very constant: Paris hasn’t moved 
on much since the 1980s or Geneva from the 70s but Athens, like London, keeps 
evolving and reinventing itself. It has an energy that I love.

It’s a city where the new sits beautifully with the ancient. You can wander 
through modern areas, bars, tourist shops and restaurants and then stumble upon 
a little fenced-off area that’s an extraordinary ruin – almost as if it’s not a 
big deal, when it is. In the historical centre there’s a 3km section that’s 
been turned into a pedestrianised zone – an essential area to wander through.

The Acropolis Museum <http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en> is the most 
stunning museum I’ve been to, with enormous windows overlooking the Acropolis. 
The minimalism of the layout makes it exceptional, every object is given its 
space.

The Kolonaki district is more modern and hip. There are bars, restaurants and 
higher-end shops – especially around Kolonaki Square – but you’ll also come 
across several galleries, including theBenaki Museum 
<http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?lang=en> (for Greek and Byzantine art, 
admission €3-€7) and the Theatre Museum (50 Akademias Street, admission €2).

Take the funicular to the top of Mount Lycabettus while you’re in Kolonaki. 
It’s the highest peak in Athens, but only a 10-minute ride, and gives the 
biggest view of the city – all the way to the harbour at Piraeus. It’s 
spectacular up there and there’s a cafe and theOrizontes restaurant 
<http://www.orizonteslycabettus.gr/en> on hand, too.

The bar Oinoscent <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oinoscent/198585923485643> 
has a superb collection of Greek wines. It became a favourite while we were 
filming. They serve small plates but it’s really all about the wine; they are 
passionate about it.

The Hotel Grand Bretagne <http://www.grandebretagne.gr/> on Syntagma Square is 
an absolutely beautiful building.It’s where we had the characters Chester and 
Colette stay (though Highsmith had them at the King George Place close by). It 
can be frighteningly pricey but worth going for a drink onthe rooftop bar

 Fine for wine … Oinoscent 
It may surprise you but Athens’ underground system is clean and beautiful and 
great for navigating what is a sprawling city. I use it to get to 
neighbourhoods like Monastiraki, with its market, or Plaka, with its history.

There is a misconception that Athens is full of waiters beckoning you in to 
tourist-trap restaurants. Of course they exist but it is also a living, 
breathing, energetic city full of culture, whether ancient or modern.

Athens is a place where great travel writers have been … Henry Miller, Freya 
Stark, Patrick Leigh Fermor. There is a memoir by Patricia Storace called 
Dinner with Persephone that made me realise there’s a lot more to the city than 
just the centre. I love books that transport me back to the history of a place 
and its culture.

There’s a great walking guide by John L Tomkinson called Athens: The City 
(Greece Beyond the Guidebooks), but if you want a simple stroll, the Agora is a 
lovely place to wander – amid the scattered ruins and greenery. It’s never as 
busy as the Acropolis, either.
