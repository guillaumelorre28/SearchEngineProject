will be ready."

November at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, and he is finishing the season with 
considerably more momentum than his near rivals in the top 10.

last month, and the Spaniard, who has looked out of sorts since losing the 
final of the US Open to Novak Djokovic, has pulled out of Paris to prepare for 
London.

rest, hit three consecutive double faults in front of his home supporters on 
Thursday then had to find 10 aces to beat Jarkko Nieminen 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 to 
reach the quarter-finals. It is the first set the Finn has taken off Federer in 
12 matches over nine years.
