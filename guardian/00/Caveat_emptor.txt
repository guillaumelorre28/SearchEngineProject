Latin for "let the buyer beware", caveat emptor is a legal principle that 
applies to the sale of property. It means the onus is on the buyer to ascertain 
the quality and condition of a property before proceeding with its purchase.

If it transpires that there are problems with the property such as dry rot or 
subsidence, purchasers do not have the right to seek redress subsequent to the 
purchase. That is why it is so important to have a building survey carried out 
before buying a house. Not only will this tell you about the condition of the 
property, it will also give you valuable protection if the property is riddled 
with defects.
