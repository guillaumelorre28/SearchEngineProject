As leading shares struggle to find direction, Amec has found one.

Unfortunately for shareholders in the engineering consultancy group, that 
direction is down.

Its shares have slumped 65p to £10.59, a near 6% decline which makes it the 
biggest faller in the leading index, after a cautious outlook.

The company, which serves the mining, oil and gas, nuclear and renewable 
energy industry, said full year earnings rose 11% to £331m, helped by strong 
performances from the UK north sea, gulf of Mexico and contract wins in the 
middle east.

But its statement added:
 In 2013 Amec expects low-to-mid digit revenue growth for the group on an 
underlying basis, excluding procurement. A strong conventional oil and gas 
performance across the board and more modest growth in the clean energy and 
environment and infrastructure markets in the Americas are expected to offset 
reduced oil sands revenue and softening demand in the mining market, and in 
Australia more generally 
.

It also appeared to signal the end of its share buyback programme, buying back 
£403m worth of shares at an average cost of £10.70 per share.

Andrew Whittock at Liberum Capital issued a hold recommendation, saying:
 Margin guidance looks disappointing so forecasts will come back a little. 
This, and the apparent halt of the buyback programme, could be unhelpful but we 
expect to retain our neutral view on the shares.


Stuart Joyner at Investec kept his buy rating however:
 Overall the results and outlook are solid and, after Saipem's recent profit 
warning, we are not complaining! The one surprise is that management has chosen 
not to roll the buyback into 2013 – instead the dividend rises 20% to 36.5p.

Elsewhere Carnival has dropped 56p to £25.19 after it announced - after the UK 
market closed - a higher than expected hit from voyage disruptions and repair 
costa of $0.08 to $0.10 a share.

But Rio Tinto has risen 11.5p to 3768.5p despite announcing its first full 
year loss, a massive $3bn. New chief executive Sam Walsh said he would cut 
costs, sell weaker assets and spend capital more carefully.

Overall, and despite gains in the mining sector, the FTSE 100 is down 9.04 
points at 6350.07.

Following Wednesday's figures, Tullow Oil has slipped 14p to £12.46 but 
Reckitt Benckiser has recovered 71p to £44.90.

Aberdeen Asset Management is up 10.2p at 426.2p after it paid $175m in cash 
for US asset management firm Artio Global Investors, and agreed to take a 50.1% 
stake in private equity business SVG Advisors for £17.5m.SVG Capital, the 
current owner of Advisors, has added 9.2p to 356p, helped by a 16% rise in its 
net asset value per share to 391p.

Next has added 55p to £41.87 after analysts at HSBC moved from neutral to 
overweight and raised their target price from £41 to £49.65. The bank said it 
expected online to make up two thirds of clothing and footwear sales by 2020 
driven by M-commerce, adding:
 We focus on stocks with high online revenue exposure and low sensitivity to 
bricks and mortar channels to market.
