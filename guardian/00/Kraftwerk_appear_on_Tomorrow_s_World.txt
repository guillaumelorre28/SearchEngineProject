The germinating moment for British dance music occurred, strangely, in a 1975 
edition of Tomorrow's World, which featured four young Germans dressed like 
geography teachers, apparently playing campingÂ stoves with wired-up knitting 
needles. This wasKraftwerk <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kraftwerk> 
performing Autobahn.

"The sounds are created in their studio in Dusseldorf," presenter Raymond 
Baxter explained, "then reprogrammed and then recreated onstage with the 
minimum of fuss." Here was the entire electronic ethic in one TV clip: the 
rejection of rock's fake spontaneity, the fastidious attention to detail, the 
Europhile slickness, the devotion to rhythm. It was sublime.

When Kraftwerk toured Britain later in 1975, David Bowie's patronage ensured a 
long line of followers from OMD to Underworld. Not that everything they planned 
came to fruition. "Next year, Kraftwerk hope to eliminate the keyboard 
altogether," Baxter told us, "and create jackets with electronic lapels that 
can be played by touch". It could still happen.
