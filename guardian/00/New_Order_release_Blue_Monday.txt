"How does it feel, to treat me like you do?" Bernard Sumner's deadpan vocal 
introduced what was to become the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time. Did it 
really start as a test-pattern for the band's new Oberheim DMX? Did they just 
write it so they'd have a song they could use as an encore while they walked 
off stage? The video for the follow-up single, Confusion, makes it clear just 
how much they were influenced by clubbing at the time, hanging out with 
producer Arthur Baker in New York and playing the FunHouse in shorts and 
espadrilles.
