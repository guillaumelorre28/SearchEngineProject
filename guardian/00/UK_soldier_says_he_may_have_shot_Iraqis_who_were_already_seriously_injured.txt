A British army sergeant told a public inquiry on Monday he may have shot and 
killed Iraqis who were already seriously wounded after a fierce gun battle with 
insurgents north of Basra.

Paul Kelly, a sergeant in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, said he fired 
his rifle as he felt in danger after encountering two "standing" men with AK47 
rifles.

"What I'm saying is when I lifted my weapons up to fire, I possibly swept 
across those bodies that were on the floor and if they are people who were 
alive I could have killed them. I don't know," Kelly said.

Asked if he had deliberately aimed at injured Iraqis, he replied: "What I am 
saying is I walked into a trench and somebody pointed a weapon at me and I 
started firing."

Kelly was giving evidence to the al-Sweady inquiry, named after an alleged 
victim of abuse by British troops following what is known as the Battle of 
Danny Boy, a British checkpoint in south-eastIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> in May 2004.

Kelly refused to give evidence until the inquiry chairman, Sir Thayne Forbes, 
agreed to an interim order preventing the publication of photographs of him in 
central London and closing down a video link to prevent his picture from being 
seen outside the inquiry room.

Questioned about claims made by other British soldiers, he told the inquiry on 
Monday that his recollection was very clear.

He denied a claim by Duncan Aston, a soldier in the 2nd Battalion of Princess 
of Wales Royal Regiment who gave evidence to the inquiry last week, who said 
Kelly emptied a full magazine into the "twitching" bodies of insurgents.

Kelly was awarded the Military <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/military> Cross 
for his actions in two earlier engagements in Iraq but left the army in 2006 
"having become disillusioned with army life".
