Lake Yarrunga at Acacia Flat, South Coast


Here it’s just you, a few canoeists and the boundless water and sky. The lake 
sits within Morton national park, and it’s amazing that a relatively short walk 
brings you to somewhere so remote. It’s the only Sydney Catchment Authority 
reservoir where you’re allowed to swim and, at over 19km, there’s certainly 
more than enough space for it. It’s such a pretty setting, though, that you’ll 
probably be just as content to spend the day wading in and out of the water. A 
gently sloping, grassy campsite juts out into the lake. Shaded by tall gum 
trees and acacias, which bloom with frothy yellow flowers in spring, it’s a 
fantastic spot for a quiet weekend.

The word swamp doesn’t usually entice swimmers but this pool is actually a 
lovely place to swim and looks like the quintessential Australian billabong. A 
medium-size pool with a small sandy beach, surrounded by ferns and long-legged 
white gums, it’s part of a system of highland swamps. These swamps act like 
giant purifiers, slowly filtering water through layers of peat. During times of 
low rainfall, the water changes from golden brown to blood red. The nearby 
village of Penrose has some of the friendliest locals you could hope to meet, 
and there’s also plenty of wildlife at the pool, including black cockatoos, 
blue wrens and an orchestra of frogs. You may even be lucky enough to see a mob 
of kangaroos bound into the pool for a cooling swim.

Upper Kangaroo Creek is characterised by astonishingly clear water, coloured 
as if it were distilled from the leaves of the surrounding trees. A bushwalk 
leads you past several bush pools on the creek – one is famous locally, the 
others little known, and the last is one of the very best waterholes in Sydney. 
But don’t expect to have beautiful Karloo Pool to yourself, as it’s justifiably 
popular. Best come midweek or else carry on downstream for some solitude. Here, 
you’ll discover a couple of pretty, smaller pools rimmed by red aquatic 
grasses. For the stuff of wild swimming dreams, however, continue on to Olympic 
Pool. The water in this 50m pool shimmers with the iridescence of an abalone 
shell. There are plenty of rock ledges for sunbathing and a few from which to 
plunge into the water.

This wild river courses through the vast, untrammeled bush of the 
Kanangra-Boyd national park. It’s a landscape of colossal boulders wrought from 
towering cliffs. If you love leaping over rocks and jumping into the water, 
only to hop out again as you explore further along, this is the place for you. 
The Kowmung is one of only seven rivers in New South Wales that have been 
declared as wild rivers: a status only given to rivers in near-pristine 
condition. It’s off the beaten track, remote and difficult to access, so gets 
few visitors, but there is fantastic swimming to be had.

By the time the Grose River has descended to the lower reaches of the 
world-famous Blue Mountains, it’s sedate and meandering. Here, though, it feels 
gurgling, active and bracing. Swimming here, you’re right in the middle of 
classic Blue Mountains scenery. One of the most scenic bushwalks in all the 
mountains gets you to this spot, and while it receives a few visitors, it’s 
definitely not on the tourist map. The river bustles around large boulders, 
pausing temporarily at a series of sunlit pools, where the pale green water is 
so clear that you feel as though you’re levitating as you float.

Fittingly named, people come here to catapult themselves into the deep pool. 
And if testing your nerve isn’t your thing, it also happens to be a gorgeous 
setting for a swim. In the lush, narrow valley of a national park, the cliffs 
offer jumps between 3m–10m. A knotted rope enables jumpers to get from the pool 
to the launching points. From here, it’s just a matter of psyching yourself up 
before stepping off the edge. It’s exhilarating and the rumbling cascades are 
so loud that any screams that might slip out mid-jump should be obscured.

Jingga means nice and sweet in the indigenous language, and while this may be 
an appropriate reference to the taste of the water, the pool itself has too 
strong a presence to be summed up by the phrase. A thick sandstone-slab 
waterfall that looms over Jingga spans the width of one end of this 65m pool. 
The falls drop almost 5m down the slab’s flat face, and the weight of their 
gushing waters pushes you under as you swim below. There is something about 
being beneath a waterfall – it only takes a few moments to feel renewed. When 
the sign says that the path to this pool is steep, it’s not kidding. This walk 
is certainly more taxing than the one to a nearby pool; however, the flip side 
is that it receives fewer visitors. It’s a magical place to swim.

This is such an enticing place to escape the city and spend a weekend: a 200m 
pool bordered by a large sand bank that’s perfect for pitching a tent or two. 
The bush seems to melt right into the pretty pool and, compared to many swims 
in the Blue Mountains, it’s easy to get to. Sculptured cliffs loom over the 
deep water, and little swallows dart above its surface. In the morning, you’ll 
be woken by a joyful assault of birdsong. You can pepper a couple of idyllic 
days with lazy swims right here but, for the more adventurous, it is also 
possible to explore up and downstream.

In a lush rock amphitheatre, with a 10m-high waterfall, this is a freshwater 
haven in a coastal area. It’s the perfect antidote to a hot day, as the 
surrounding trees and rock ledges create delightfully shady spots. The light is 
beautiful and, when the sun breaks through the tree canopy, it bounces off the 
surface of the water and reflects back on everything in golden waves. The pool 
is small, with deep, clear, chilly water, even in summer. Dragonflies streak 
along the surface and cicadas compete with the din of the high, tumbling 
waterfall. The thick trunk of an old fallen tree sits at the end of the pool in 
a column of sunshine, and is a great spot to dry off.

Nayook creek courses through the narrow canyon before opening onto a bush 
campground. The journey here to the edge of the Wollemi Wilderness – first by 
car through a maze of increasingly rough, forestry roads and then on foot – 
only adds to the sense of adventure. The canyon contains a number of deep 
pools. By Sydney standards, the water is perishingly cold and a quick dunk will 
likely be enough to leave you feeling terrific. The best pool has a high, 
plunging waterfall, which mists the fern-dotted cliff face, creating intense 
rainbows. There are several rock ledges that provide excellent jumping 
opportunities. Although it’s a bit of an effort to get here, it’s well worth 
it. The campground is one of the prettiest in Sydney, consisting of a protected 
bowl of downy grass with a creek and fire-circle.
