Andy Roddick <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-roddick> served 20 aces 
on Tuesday to defeat a 21-year-old American qualifier, Rhyne Williams, 6-3, 
6-4, 6-4 in the first round of the US Open.

Roddick, the 2003 US Open champion who has fallen to No22 in the world and is 
seeded 20th at Flushing Meadow this year, won the last 16 points on his serve 
and finished the match with a 127mph ace.

It was a tough grand slam debut for Williams, who won three matches in 
qualifying and then learned he had a first-round match against the 2003 
champion (and 2006 finalist) in Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Williams, ranked 289th coming into the week and glorying under the nickname 
'Rhyno', put in a respectable performance, but dropped a break in each set. He 
will still earn $23,000 as a first-round loser in the year's final grand slam.

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France, the No5 seed, beat the Slovak qualifier Karol 
Beck in straight sets. Tsonga won 6-3, 6-1, 7-6, after rallying from down a 
break in the third set. Both players made 36 unforced errors, but Tsonga had 41 
winners to 25 for Beck.

The Frenchman made the quarterfinals at the US Open last year, his best 
showing at Flushing Meadows. He was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this year. 
Beck, who is No143 in the world, reached the round of 16 at the 2004 US Open 
but the 30-year-old has now lost in the first round in 16 of his 24 Grand Slam 
appearances.

The No6 seed, Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic, advanced with a 
straight-set win over the 56th-ranked David Goffin of Belgium, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3

Canada's Milos Raonic won a match at the US Open for the first time, with a 
five-set victory over Santiago Giraldo. The 15th-seeded Raonic won 6-3, 4-6, 
3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in three hours and 25 minutes. Giraldo, a Colombian who is ranked 
No46 in the world, is now 1-6 in his career in five-set matches.

In the women's draw the No2 seed, Agnieszka Radwanska, of Poland, ignored a 
shoulder problem to breeze past the Russian world No91, Nina Bratchikova, in a 
6-1, 6-1 win. Radwanska, who was beaten in the Wimbledon final by Serena 
Williams, wore visible strapping.

"It's sometimes worse but it feels better right now," Radwanska said. "That's 
about it. It's always different when I'm playing matches or I'm just practising 
and not pushing that much. Of course I had some rest before the US Open. I'm 
really taking care of it right now. It's really better."
