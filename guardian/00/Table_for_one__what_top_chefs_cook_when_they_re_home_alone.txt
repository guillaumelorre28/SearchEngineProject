Karam Sethi



Cheese <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cheese> on toast is the 
ultimate comfort meal for one, plus it takes all of five minutes to put 
together. It’s what I always eat when I’m in a rush, don’t really want to cook, 
or just need a lift after a long day.

Cheese on challah toast with green chilli and coriander

The addition of chilli and coriander, and the use of challah, the Jewish 
braided bread, take the instant gratification levels up a notch or two. If you 
want to pull out all the stops, once your cheese on toast is cooked, top with a 
fried egg; or, even better, spread leftover keema (spiced minced lamb) on the 
toast before adding the cheese, chilli and coriander – now that’s really lush. 
Serves one.

1 tsp finely chopped green chilli (or more or less, depending on how hot you 
want it)
1 tbsp picked coriander leaves, finely chopped 
1 generous chunk good cheddar, grated (in my book, it has to be Isle of Mull)
1 thick piece challah bread (or sourdough or good crusty bread), lightly 
toasted on both side
Fried egg and/or keema (optional)

In a bowl, mix the chilli, coriander and grated cheese, and spread over one 
side of the toast. Grill for two to three minutes – the bread should get a 
slight char at the edges – and serve piping hot.

My ideal Valentine’s meal for one is a cheese platter with crusty bread, a 
fruity chutney or a sharp mostarda, and a cold bottle of Pouilly-Fumé. Well, of 
course it is – I’m French. Come to think of it, cheese is my ideal meal for 
one, full stop.

There’s no need to go overboard with your choice of cheeses: just make sure 
you have a hard cheese, a blue cheese and a goats’ cheese, and you’re all set. 
For me, that means a comté, a roquefort andBrock Hall Farm’s Dutch Mistress 
<http://shop.brockhallfarm.com/products/dutch-mistress>, a real personal 
favourite.

Mostarda di frutta is great with cheese, but it’s expensive to buy, so a few 
years ago I decided to see if I could come up with my own version – the perfect 
piquant treat for cheese. While cheese is my default meal for breakfast, lunch, 
dinner or any time in between, I have to admit I’ve also got a bit of a soft 
spot for peanut M&Ms: they’re an irresistible combination of chocolate, crunch 
and peanuts.

 Mustard apricots: the perfect spicy accompaniment to a cheese board, says chef 
Bruno Loubet. Photograph: Dan Matthews. Food styling: Jack Sargeson/Dan Matthews
Mustard apricots

Even a jar of average mostarda will set you back £6 or more. Here’s a homemade 
version at a fraction of the cost. It’s also dead easy. Makes 800g, or enough 
for two jars.

300ml white-wine vinegar
200g caster sugar
½ cinnamon stick
2 tbsp English mustard powder
2 drops almond essence
500g dried apricots

In a medium saucepan, bring the vinegar, sugar and cinnamon to a boil, leave 
to bubble for 30 seconds, then whisk in the mustard powder and almond essence. 
Add the dried apricots, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover with a lid and 
leave to cook for an hour – the liquid will reduce and go syrupy.

Remove from the heat, then pour into hot sterilised jars. Seal and set aside 
to cool. Once cool, store in the fridge and use with a month.

Jasmine Hemsley, Hemsley + Hemsley

My sister Melissa’s go-to dish is a bowl of broth with miso, ginger, greens 
and fresh chilli, plus an egg dropped in at the last second to poach (we both 
always keep a jug ofbone broth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/26/bone-broth-chicken-soup-recipe>
 in the fridge, and more in the freezer, just in case). When I’m feeding just 
myself, it’s eggs any way or leftover roast veg, all topped off with kimchi and 
extra-virgin olive oil.

If I was treating myself, though, it would have to be fish amok. I came across 
it on holiday in Cambodia last year, and loved the fresh flavours, the mild 
spicing and the creamy comfort so much, I ordered it for breakfast, lunch or 
dinner every day. Melissa’s more a steak and chips kind of girl, though she’d 
jazz it up by serving it with a bone marrow butter.

Fish amok

There will be quite a bit more spice paste than you need for this dish, but it 
freezes very well and is handy to have around; that said, if you’re anything 
like me, you’ll use it all up by making this mild fish curry three days on the 
spin. Serve with steamed broccoli or sautéed pak choi. Serves one.

100-150g sustainable firm white fish fillet (such as pollock), skinned and 
pinboned (go tomsc.org <http://www.msc.org> for a list of sustainable fish in 
season)
Sea salt and black pepper
1 tsp coconut oil (or ghee)
200ml full-fat coconut milk
1 handful coriander, Thai basil, basil or mint leaves (or a mix), chopped

For the spice paste (aka yellow kroeung)
40g lemongrass (4 or so sticks), outer leaves discarded, roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled
3 shallots, peeled and chopped
2 kaffir lime leaves (or 1 tsp lime juice plus ½ tsp zest)
½ tsp galangal, peeled and sliced very thin (or ¾ tsp fresh ginger)
1 tsp fresh turmeric, peeled (or ½ tsp powder)
½ tbsp fish sauce (or tamari)
¼ tsp palm or coconut sugar (or maple syrup)
Chilli flakes or fresh chilli, to taste

Blend the paste ingredients until smooth (or pound in a pestle and mortar, for 
a more authentic approach). Depending on the strength of your blender, you may 
need to pulse it a few times to get the desired consistency.

Cut the fish into 2cm x 2cm dice and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. 
Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a medium flame, add a third to half of 
the paste mix and fry for 30 seconds, stirring to prevent it catching. Pour in 
the coconut milk, stir to combine, bring to a simmer and leave to bubble away 
for 10 minutes. Add the fish, cover and poach gently for about four minutes, 
until cooked.

Sprinkle most of the herbs into a deep bowl, then ladle on the pieces of fish 
and sauce. Garnish with the remaining herbs and serve.

Deep down, I’m a man of pretty simple tastes, so my idea of the perfect meal 
for one would have to be eggy. Quite apart from being delicious, there’s 
something just so soothing and satisfying about an omelette. The only thing 
that could improve it is a bit of pork and cheese; mind you, just about 
everything is improved by adding pork and cheese to it.

My more usual solo meal also features pork: I’ve been known to come home from 
work, fry up a packet of bangers, smear them with lots of English mustard (and 
I mean lots) and devour, before heading to the fridge in search of some cold 
grapes for pudding.

 Tom Kerridge’s chorizo and chilli omelette: Simple, but oh so satisfying.

Spicy chorizo and chilli omelette

Get the best chorizo you can afford for this – it makes a hell of a 
difference. If spicy isn’t your bag, take the seeds out of the chilli, but I 
like it hot. Serves one.

2-3 tbsp vegetable or olive oil 
100g chorizo, cut into 2cm dice 
3 eggs, whisked
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ garlic clove, peeled and grated 
½ tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped
¼ green chilli, thinly sliced, seeds and all
75g manchego, crumbled (or a good cheddar)
The zest of ¼ lemon, to finish

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Warm a 16cm nonstick ovenproof frying 
pan over a medium heat, then add the oil. Once hot, fry the chorizo until it 
starts to release that lovely, smoky, red paprika oil; if there’s a lot of fat, 
drain some of it off (don’t throw it away, though – it’s great for frying 
spuds) and turn the heat to low.

Season the eggs, then pour into the pan. Add the garlic and half the parsley 
and chilli, and stir gently until the eggs begin to firm up. Scatter the cheese 
over the top, then transfer the pan to the oven to finish off cooking for four 
to five minutes, until the eggs are set and the cheese melted. Remove, sprinkle 
over the remaining chilli and parsley, and turn out on to a plate. Finish by 
grating lemon zest on top, and tuck in.

When I’m after a quick bite, it’s invariably canned tuna on toast with Heinz 
mayo, but for a treat I honestly can’t think of anything I’d rather eat than 
scrambled eggs on toast. That might seem an odd choice for my ultimate solo 
dining experience, but I’m not talking the rubbery stuff you get at motorway 
service stations, rather a soft tumble of rich, creamy, golden goodness. As 
with all cooking, even with something so apparently simple,really good 
scrambled eggs take a bit of time and effort. And when white truffles are in 
season, I’d up the ante and shave a generous dose on top. Sadly I’ve now got to 
wait all the way until next October for that.

Scrambled eggs and soldiers

We’re talking solo luxury here, so long, slow cooking is the key, rather than 
a jug of eggs nuked in the microwave. And by “soldiers”, I don’t mean plastic 
white sliced, but sourdough toast, generously spread with cold, unsalted butter 
and cut into batons. Serves one.

1 knob of butter
2-3 free-range eggs (I’d go for Clarence Court’s Burford Browns – they have 
gloriously golden yolks)
Sea salt and freshly ground black or white pepper
1 slice sourdough, toasted
White truffle, for shaving (when in season)

Over a very low heat, melt the butter in a heavy-based pan (some chef friends 
even advocate making scrambled eggs in a heatproof bowl over a bain-marie, so 
give that a go if the fancy takes you). The crucial factor here is that the pan 
and butter must not be so hot that the eggs start setting the moment you put 
them in – long, slow and gentle cooking is the order of the day here. Crack in 
the eggs, and leave for a couple of minutes, until they start to set slightly. 
Break up and scramble gently with a wooden spoon – not too much, mind. With the 
heat still very low, cook your eggs, stirring regularly, for 15-20 minutes at 
least, until you have soft clouds of fluffy, just-cooked egg. Season to taste, 
tip on to a warm plate alongside your buttered soldiers, shave some truffle on 
top and dive in. Unbeatable.

If I get home late, or if I’m home alone at the weekend, I often find myself 
reaching for a little bowl of ice-cream. Winter or summer, it is, for me, the 
perfect snack: refreshing and comforting all at the same time. Chocolate is one 
of my favourite things in the world, and in ice-cream form it is, if anything, 
even more of an indulgence; exactly how you want to feel when in search of a 
tasty morsel. This recipe is quick to knock together and keeps well in the 
freezer, for those moments when you are home alone and craving something sweet.

richer, the better. Chocolate ice-cream. Photograph: Dan Matthews. Food 
styling: Jack Sargeson/Dan Matthews 
Rich chocolate ice-cream

It’s not really worth making ice-cream in smaller quantities than this, plus 
homemade ice-cream is at its best for only a couple of days. But the upside is 
that this means you can treat yourself two or three days in a row. Makes two to 
three single servings (depending on how greedy you are).

75ml whole milk
175ml double cream
½ vanilla pod, split in half lengthways
30g good-quality dark chocolate
3 free-range organic egg yolks
60g caster sugar
1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder

Pour the milk and cream into a heavy-based saucepan, add the split vanilla 
pod, place over a medium heat and bring to a boil. Chop the chocolate into 
rough chunks, add to the hot, creamy milk and stir once or twice, to encourage 
it to melt.

While the chocolate is melting, beat together the egg yolks and sugar for a 
minute or two, until thick and pale. Sift the cocoa powder over the surface and 
stir to combine. Pour in the hot cream, whisking as you do so, then pour 
everything back into the pan.

Turn the heat to very low and stir, using a figure-of-eight motion, until the 
custard thickens – this will take eight to 10 minutes. Be patient: rushing the 
process by turning up the heat will cause the custard to curdle. As soon as the 
custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, remove from the heat and 
strain through a fine sieve into a bowl.

Leave to cool completely, then pour the custard into an ice-cream maker and 
churn until thickened, then pour into a suitable container, cover and freeze; 
the ice-cream will be ready in a couple of hours. If you don’t have an 
ice-cream machine, pour the mix into a freezer-proof container, freeze for an 
hour, until the sides start to get solid. Stir with a fork, mixing the frozen 
sides into the liquid centre, and return to the freezer for another hour. 
Repeat twice more, then leave to set solid.

I’m usually tasting food on and off all day, so I often get home at night 
without having had anything resembling a proper meal. My idea of a solo treat 
then is a few Jaffa cakes (OK, half a packet) and a strong cup of tea. In 
summer, I’m also very partial to sliced super-ripe tomatoes on buttered 
sourdough toast and topped with good olive oil, salt and pepper. If I were to 
pick my favourite meal for one, though, it would have to be steak and chips.

Steak, peppercorn sauce, chips and Caesar salad

Choose whichever cut you like – rump, sirloin, fillet, onglet – but for me it 
has to be ribeye, cooked rare. Life’s too short to make chips for one, so use 
decent oven chips instead – I like Marks & Spencer’s hand-cut ones; or, if 
you’ve got a good one nearby, pop down the chippy for a takeaway portion. A 
Caesar salad is essential, too, as far as I’m concerned. Serves one.

200g ribeye steak (bone off)
25ml olive oil
1 small sprig fresh thyme
1 small sprig fresh rosemary
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1 bay leaf
25g unsalted butter, cut into cubes
½ tsp table salt
2 large tbsp duck fat

For the sauce
15g unsalted butter
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
2 sprigs thyme, leaves picked
½ tsp Maldon salt and freshly milled black pepper
2 tsp French mustard
1 tsp grain mustard
50ml brandy
25ml ruby port
50ml red wine
100g crème fraîche
1 tsp brined green peppercorns, roughly chopped

For the Caesar salad
1 egg yolk
1 tsp Dijon mustard
100ml vegetable oil
1 tbsp chardonnay vinegar
½ clove garlic, peeled and crushed
A splash of fish sauce
10g parmesan, finely grated 
1 baby gem, leaves washed and dried
20g parmesan, finely shaved
1 slice good bread, cubed and fried in butter to make croutons
2 anchovies

For the sauce, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the shallots, thyme, salt 
and pepper, and cook until the onions are soft but not coloured. Stir in the 
mustards, then deglaze with the brandy and simmer to reduce to a syrup. Add the 
port and wine, reduce down to a syrup again. Stir in the crème fraîche and 
peppercorns, adjust the seasoning and set aside somewhere warm.

For the chips, set the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7, and heat the duck fat in 
a roasting pan. Once it’s smoking hot, carefully add the chips and roast until 
golden and crisp – about 20 minutes (check the packet).

Meanwhile, make the mayonnaise for the salad. Whisk the egg yolk with the 
mustard until fluffy. Slowly whisk in half the oil bit by bit, then add the 
vinegar and garlic. Now gradually incorporate the remaining oil and, once it’s 
all emulsified, stir in the fish sauce and parmesan, and adjust the seasoning 
to taste (you’re unlikely to need much, if any salt, because the fish sauce and 
parmesan are already salty, as is the anchovy you’ll be adding later). If the 
dressing is too thick for your liking, loosen with a little cold water.

Just before you cook your steak, put the lettuce in a bowl and dress with the 
mayonnaise. Toss through the anchovies, parmesan and croutons, add a good few 
twists of black pepper and put on the table.

To cook the steak, heat the oil in a frying pan. When smoking, season the 
ribeye on both sides and sear all over. Add the butter a cube at a time, until 
melted and foaming, then add the herbs and garlic. Baste the steak in butter 
until it’s done to your liking – for rare, about four minutes in all – then 
remove from the pan and set aside to rest for five minutes. Serve topped with 
the warm sauce, and with the chips and salad alongside.
