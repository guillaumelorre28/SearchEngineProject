Tim Henman crashed out of the Australian Open, losing in straight sets in the 
round of 16, as Swede Jonas Bjorkman reached the quarter-finals with a 
commanding victory (6-2, 7-6, 6-4) over the British hopeful.

Henman played nervously from the outset, holding his service only once in 
losing the first set 2-6 in just 42 minutes.

The crucial point came as the second set went to a tie-break. Henman had two 
set points to level the match, but failed to convert them. Bjorkman retured 
spectacularly at the key moment before winning the set.

Bjorkman remained in control but required five match points before finishing 
Henman off. The Briton, struggling with his service throughout the match, 
sought tenaciously to stay in the game before finally succumbing after two 
hours and 48 minutes on court.
