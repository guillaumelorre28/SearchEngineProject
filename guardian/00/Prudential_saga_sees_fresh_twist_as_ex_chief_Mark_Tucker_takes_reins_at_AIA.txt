The former chief executive of the Prudential 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/prudential>, Mark Tucker, is to be named 
as the new boss of AIA, the Asian insurer that is part of the American firm AIG.

The appointment is an unexpected twist in a long-running saga, in which the 
current management of the Prudential, led byTidjane Thiam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tidjane-thiam>, were almost toppled in 
their failed attempt to take control of AIA.

Tucker, 53, helped build Prudential's Asian franchise in the 1990s and was 
chief executive of the company from early 2005 until September 2009. He had 
previously lived in Hong Kong, where AIA is based.

AIG <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aig> is aiming to raise more than 
$20bn (£13bn) by selling shares in AIA in a Hong Kong stock market flotation 
later this year, after the Prudential's $35.5bn bid for the business collapsed 
in spectacular style at the beginning of last month.

The aborted bid landed the company with a £450m bill – equivalent to last 
year's dividend payments – and had irate investors calling for the head of 
Thiam and the chairman, Harvey McGrath. Tucker's name had been mentioned as a 
possible replacement at the helm of the Prudential.

AIG had been planning the initial public offering of its Asian division before 
Prudential expressed an interest in buying the business and has now revived the 
plan. The cash raised in the flotation will go toward repaying billions in 
taxpayers' funds after the insurer was bailed out by Washington during the 
financial crisis. It aims to raise $15bn from selling 40% of the company on the 
market plus between $5bn and $8bn from strategic investors.

Tucker replaces Mark Wilson, who has been chief executive of AIA since 2006.
