The Brighton Argus is championing a move to place a blue plaque on the site of 
Anita Roddick's original Body Shop, which she opened in 1976. The paper 
discovered that a city council rule dictates that somebody must be dead for 
five years before a plaque can be erected. But there is overwhelming local 
support for the rule to be revoked. (ViaArgus
