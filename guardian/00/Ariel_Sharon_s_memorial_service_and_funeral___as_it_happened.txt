Now that funeral is over here's summary of today's events:

• Amid tight security Israel paid homage to former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ariel-sharon> at a memorial service at the 
Knesset in Jerusalem followed by a funeral at his farm in southern Israel.
Sharon, died on Saturday at the age of 85 eight years after he went into a 
coma. US vice president Joe Biden and Middle East envoy Tony Blair were among 
those who laid wreaths.

• Missile alert sirens were installed around the Shikmin farm where Sharon was 
buried. The area has been hit by Gaza-launched rockets in the past. No private 
cars were allowed access to the funeral. Instead special coaches have been laid 
on from a nearby technical college, where mourners' possessions were passed 
through scanners. The event passed off peacefully.

• US vice president Joe Biden urged Israelis to remember Sharon's mistakes as 
well as his triumphs, and acknowledge US differences with the former prime 
minister. But speaking at the memorial service, he added: "History will judge 
that he lived in complex times, in a very complex neighbourhood."

• Middle East envoy Tony Blair <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair>
 said Sharon fought for the state of Israel both in the field of war and the 
diplomacy chamber. "He had the imagination to know that genuine peace, if 
attainable with honour and dignity both for Arabs and Israelis, was the anchor 
ultimately for Israel's security," Blair said.

• Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu> acknowledged that he had 
not always seen eye-to-eye with Sharon particularly over the pull out from 
Gaza. But he added: "Arik understood that in matters of our existence and 
security, we must stand firm. We are sticking to these principles." In his 
eulogy at the funeral Sharon's son Gilad, said Israelis angry at the withdrawal 
from Gaza should credit his father for building more settlements than anyone 
else.

• Human Rights Watch said Sharon died without facing justice for his role in 
the massacres of hundreds civilians by Lebanese militias in the Sabra and 
Shatilla refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. The killings constituted war crimes 
and crimes against humanity, it said

• Two rockets were fired from Gaza <https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza> 
ahead of the memorial service, according to the Israeli army. No one was hurt.
 It was reported that the IDF deployed an Iron Dome rocket interceptor near the 
farm where Sharon's funeral took place.

Despite the Sabra and Shatila massacres, Sharon is being hailed as a war hero, 
Gurvitz argues. This is certainly how the IDF would like Sharon to be 
remembered.

12.07pm GMT 

Sharon leaves a "murderous legacy" 
<http://972mag.com/his-finest-hours-on-sharons-murderous-legacy/85596/>, 
according to Yossi Gurvitz.

Writing on the +972 news site, which was set up by Israeli and Palestinian 
writers, Gurvitz says:

In 1982, Sharon, with extensive support from the IDF, mislead the Israeli 
government and embarked on a much larger campaign in Lebanon than that 
envisaged by his colleagues. The goal of the campaign — expelling the PLO from 
Lebanon and dealing a deadly blow to Palestinian national aspirations– was 
presented to the public as a quick-fix operation of short duration, with the 
expressed purpose of removing the Palestinian Katyusha rockets from the border 
region. Somehow, the public was duped into forgetting the fact that a ceasefire 
between Israel and the PLO had been kept for 13 months, and was only violated 
whenIsrael <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> attacked PLO bases, 
located in Palestinian refugee camps, from the air.

The war became the most divisive event in Israel’s history until that point. 
The lies being put out by the IDF, Sharon and the government were so farfetched 
that they were exposed as ridiculous within a short time. The media, of course, 
jumped to attention. The best example was the conquest of Beaufort castles: 
since Sharon informed Begin that Israel took no casualties during that 
operation – it is not clear if he was mistaken or lied per his usual habit – 
and Begin repeated it to reporters, no newspaper dared challenge the prime 
minister’s word. Anyone who wanted to know what happened needed to read the 
deaths notices.

As far as large segments of the Israeli public were concerned, the war reached 
its nadir with the massacre of Sabra and Shatila 
<http://972mag.com/a-letter-to-the-idf-soldiers-at-sabra-and-shatila/55847/>. 
The notion that it was a massacre committed by Christians against Muslims has 
been very well inculcated in the minds of the Israeli public. Technically it is 
true – but in the process of accepting that interpretation, some critical facts 
were made to vanish, including: the IDF armed those who carried out the 
massacre; the IDF surrounded West Beirut; the perpetrators made their way into 
West Beirut at the invitation and with the assistance of the IDF; IDF artillery 
fired flares which facilitated the massacre and later on the helped the 
Phalangists conceal the bodies.

The massacre shocked the Israeli public. Then came that mythological 
demonstration of the 400,000 people, and eventually the government was forced 
to established the Kahan Commission of Inquiry. It concluded that IDF officers 
knew about the massacre in real time and failed to act decisively to stop it

11.49am GMT 

Joe Biden's convoy has arrived for the funeral at the Negev ranch 
<http://www.timesofisrael.com/foreign-dignitaries-fly-in-ahead-of-sharon-funeral/#ixzz2qHJPPgrE>
, according to the Times of Israel.

It points out that the US vice president is under protection of Iron Dome 
missile defence system that the US helped develop.

The security envelope around the event, where Israel’s top leadership and many 
senior foreign dignitaries are in attendance, is being managed by the Shin Bet.

“We are preparing for every conceivable scenario,” Israel’s Southern District 
Police chief Yoram Halevy said yesterday, “from minor provocations” by Israeli 
extremists “to gunfire from the Gaza Strip.”

11.40am GMT 

The funeral cortège has arrived at the Shikmin farm where Sharon is due to be 
buried, Harriet Sherwood reports.

11.31am GMT 

The Times takes Biden's "bulldozer" comment  
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article3973757.ece>as the 
cue for its headline for a report on the memorial service.

Speaking to an audience of hundreds of Israeli and overseas dignitaries, 
including Tony Blair, Mr Biden talked about his decades-long friendship with Mr 
Sharon, saying the death felt “like a death in the family”.

When the two discussed Israel’s security, Mr Biden said, he would understand 
how Mr Sharon earned the nickname “The Bulldozer”, explaining how he would pull 
out maps and repeatedly make the same points to drive them home.

“He was indomitable,” Mr Biden said. “But like all historic leaders, all real 
leaders, he had a north star that guided him, a north star from which he never, 
in my observation, never deviated.

Blair chose similar imagery in his eulogy, talking of Sharon leaving "debris 
in his wake" (see earlier)

Security is very tight in the area surrounding Shikmim Farm, the ranch where 
Sharon will be buried in just over an hour, writesHarriet Sherwood from the 
Negev desert.

No private cars are being allowed access. Instead special coaches have been 
laid on from a nearby technical college, where mourners' possessions are passed 
through scanners.

The farm is surrounded by orange groves and ploughed fields - and for today at 
least, hundreds of police officers. A helicopter is circling overhead and a 
surveillance balloon is hovering nearby.

An area on top of a hill near to the spot where Sharon will be laid to rest 
alongside his late wife Lily has been penned off with crash barriers. At least 
six huge screens will show the proceedings live. Israeli soldiers are offering 
plastic chairs and bottles of water.

It feels a bit reminiscent of Wimbledon's Henman Hill, but more sombre of 
course. And the winter sun is hot here on the edge of the Negev desert.

Sharon made known his wish to be buried at his beloved farm as opposed to the 
official state cemetery at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.

The official funeral party is currently en route from Jerusalem, via a 
military base in Latrun.

AP has more from the eulogy delivered by Israel's president Shimon Peres, a 
longtime friend and sometimes rival of Sharon. 

Arik was a man of the land, He defended this land like a lion and he taught 
its children to swing a scythe. He was a military legend in his lifetime and 
then turned his gaze to the day Israel would dwell in safety, when our children 
would return to our borders and peace would grace the Promised Land.

 The speakers at Monday's ceremony largely glossed over the controversy that 
surrounded Sharon, and instead focused on his leadership and personality, 
according AP said.

 "I didn't always agree with Arik and he didn't always agree with me," said 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who resigned from Sharon's government to 
protest the Gaza withdrawal. Nonetheless, he called Sharon "one of the big 
warriors" for the nation of Israel.

 "He was pragmatic. His pragmatism was rooted in deep emotion, deep emotion 
for the state, for the Jewish people," Netanyahu said.

Summary

While Sharon's coffin makes its way from Jerusalem to his family farm in 
southern Israel, here's a summary of the main points so far:

• Amid tight security Israel paid homage to former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
at a memorial service at the Knesset in Jerusalem. Sharon, who died on Saturday 
at the age of 85 eight years after he went into a coma, will be buried later on 
Monday at the family farm at Negev.

• US vice president Joe Biden urged Israelis to remember Sharon's mistakes as 
well as his triumphs, and acknowledge US differences with the former prime 
minister. But he added: "History will judge that he lived in complex times, in 
a very complex neighbourhood."

• Middle East envoy Tony Blair said Sharon fought for the state of Israel both 
in the field of war and the diplomacy chamber. "He had the imagination to know 
that genuine peace, if attainable with honour and dignity both for Arabs and 
Israelis, was the anchor ultimately for Israel's security," Blair said.

• Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that he had not 
always seen eye-to-eye with Sharon particularly over the pull out from Gaza.But 
he added: "Arik understood that in matters of our existence and security, we 
must stand firm. We are sticking to these principles."

• Two rockets were fired from Gaza ahead of the memorial service, according to 
the Israeli army. No one was hurt. It was reported that the IDF deployed an 
Iron Dome rocket interceptor near the farm where Sharon's funeral is due to 
take place. The area has been hit by Gaza-launched rockets in the past.

Human Rights Watch says Sharon died without facing justice for his role in the 
massacres of hundreds civilians by Lebanese militias in the Sabra and Shatilla 
refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. The killings constituted war crimes and 
crimes against humanity, it said.

In a statement 
<http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/11/israel-ariel-sharon-s-troubling-legacy> it 
added:

Sharon also escaped accountability for other alleged abuses, such as his role 
expanding settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, prosecutable as a 
war crime. Sharon ordered the removal of all Israeli settlers from the Gaza 
Strip and from four West Bank settlements in 2005, but the overall number of 
settlers in occupied territory increased significantly during his term as prime 
minister.

Two rockets were fired from Gaza ahead of the memorial service

The military says Monday's rocket fire caused no injuries or damage. Israeli 
media said the rockets were fired into the sea.

Media in Israel also say the Iron Dome anti-missile system has been deployed 
near Sharon's ranch in southern Israel to protect against rockets during the 
funeral. The military declined to comment.

Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld says increased police forces have 
been deployed for Sharon's funeral.

Here's more from Tony's Blair speech:

Over the years we worked together as prime ministers. He took actions no one 
ever thought he would take: agreeing the Road Map, withdrawal from Gaza, 
forming Kadima. But the idea that he changed from the man of war to the man of 
peace, misses that which defined him. Actually he never changed his strategic 
objective never wavered. The state, from which the age of 14 he fought to bring 
into being, had to be protected for future generations. When that fighting, he 
fought. When that meant making peace, he sought peace. The same iron 
determination he took to the field war, he took to the chamber of diplomacy. 
Bold unorthodox, unyielding.

Once decided he was unflinching. He carried all before him. And in this mode 
he didn't move, he charged. Positions, parties, policies, he could leave 
considerable debris in his wake. But always his destination was clear. As was 
his motivation ...

He had the toughness of mind to despise all illusions about the threats facing 
Israel. But he had the imagination to know that genuine peace, if attainable 
with honour and dignity both for Arabs and Israelis, was the anchor ultimately 
for Israel's security. 

Haaretz columnist Anshel Pfeffer commented:

Biden also paid tribute to Sharon's decision to order thousands of Israelis to 
leave Gaza. "As a student of the Jewish state, I can't think of a more 
controversial and difficult decision," Biden said. "But he believed it, and he 
did it."

And the US vice president openly acknowledged US differences with Sharon.

"The security of his people was always Arik's unwavering mission - an 
unbreakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years 
from now," Biden said.

Arik was never uncertain. But there were times when he acted, and those 
actions earned him controversy and even condemnation. And in certain instances 
American leaders, American presidents, had profound differences with him. And 
they were never shy about stating them. Nor was he ever shy about stating his 
position. As I said, from my observation, he was a complex man ... History will 
judge that he also lived in complex times, in a very complex neighbourhood.

It's right for the Israeli people to reflect on all aspects of his life. The 
triumphs, as well as the mistakes. Taking full measure of the man. The arc of 
his life. I would argue that the arc of his life traced the journey of the 
state of Israel. And through it all, the United States, whether we agreed or

Speaking about this photograph of Sharon as a soldier, Biden said: "I remember 
as a young Senator, that iconic picture of him with that bandage around his 
head, standing there after a decisive victory, which seemed to symbolise, as 
the prime minister said, an Israel that had reclaimed its roots of standing up 
and fighting, needing no help, standing on its own."

Here's a first take on the funeral from Reuters 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/13/us-israel-sharon-idUSBREA0C0DZ20140113?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=992637>

Israel paid homage to former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at the first of two 
funeral services to be held on Monday for a man hailed as a war hero at home 
but seen by many in the Arab world as a war criminal.

US Vice President Joe Biden joined the sombre ceremony in front of the Israeli 
parliament, Sharon's coffin draped in the Israel's blue and white flag, bathed 
in winter sunshine.

"We are accompanying to his final resting place today, a soldier, an 
exceptional soldier, a commander who knew how to win," said Israeli President 
Shimon Peres.

Sharon died at the age of 85 on Saturday after spending the last eight years 
in a coma caused by a massive stroke.

His death has reopened debate into his legacy, with foes denouncing his 
ruthless conduct in military operations while friends praised him as a 
strategic genius who had stunned the world in 2005 by pulling Israeli troops 
and settlers out of the Gaza Strip - a Palestinian territory in the south.

"The security of his people was always Arik's unwavering mission - a 
non-breakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years 
from now," Biden said, using Sharon's nickname.

After the memorial service at parliament, Sharon's body will be driven from 
Jerusalem to his family farm some 10 km (6 miles) from Gaza, where he will be 
buried later in the day.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, noting he had not always seen eye-to-eye 
with Sharon on policy matters - particularly the Gaza withdrawl - hailed the 
former leader's commitment to Israel's security.

"Arik understood that in matters of our existence and security, we must stand 
firm. We are sticking to these principles," Netanyahu said.

"Israel will continue to fight terror. Israel will continue to strive for 
peace, while protecting our security. Israel will act in every way to deny Iran 
the capability of arming itself with nuclear weapons."

Israel has beefed up security for Sharon's burial and warned Gaza's Islamist 
rulers not to allow rocket fire during the ceremony, which Biden is also due to 
attend.

An Israeli security source said Israel had "passed the message" to Gazan 
authorities to prevent any rocket fire during the ceremony at the farm. Gaza is 
governed by Hamas Islamists who fought several times with Israel over the past 
few years.

"It was made clear to them that ... it would be a very bad day for anyone 
there to test Israel's patience," said the source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity.

A Reuters correspondent heard two explosions in northern Gaza on Monday 
morning which sounded like rocket impacts. An Israeli military spokeswoman said 
there had been no launches across the border. Israeli media said the blasts 
appeared to have resulted from Palestinian militants testing their weapons.

Security sources said Israel had deployed an Iron Dome rocket interceptor near 
Sharon's Sycamore Farm, which has been hit by Gaza-launched rockets in the past.

Avi Shlaim, professor emeritus of international relations at S Antony's 
College, Oxford University,takes issue with the idea that Sharon was a man of 
peace. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/13/ariel-sharon-no-man-of-peace-israel>

Writing for Comment is free he says: 

Sharon was the unilateralist par excellence. His ultimate aim was to redraw 
unilaterally Israel's borders, incorporating large swaths of occupied 
territory. Stage one was to build on the West Bank the so-called security 
barrier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/27/israel-extends-border-fence-critics>
 which the Palestinians call the apartheid wall. The international court of 
justice condemned this wall as illegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/10/israel3>. It is three times as 
long as the pre-1967 border, and its primary purpose is not security but 
land-grabbing. Good fences may make good neighbours, but not when they are 
erected in the neighbour's garden.

Stage two consisted of the unilateral disengagement of Gaza in August 2005. 
This involved the uprooting of 8,000 Jews and the dismantling of many 
settlements <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/17/israel4> − a 
shocking turnaround by a man who used to be called the godfather of the 
settlers. Withdrawal from Gaza was presented as a contribution to the Quartet's 
road map but it was nothing of the sort. The road map called for negotiations; 
Sharon refused to negotiate. His unilateral move was designed to freeze the 
political process, thereby preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state 
and maintaining the geopolitical status quo in the West Bank ...

His enduring legacy has been to empower and embolden some of the most racist, 
xenophobic, expansionist, and intransigent elements in Israel's dysfunctional 
political system.

Sharon's true love of country is rare in politics, Blair said. There was no 
higher calling than this for Sharon, Blair said. The idea of a Jewish homeland, 
was clear and unalloyed in Sharon, Blair said. He was warrior but knew that war 
alone could not secure Israel's future, Blair said.

8.28am GMT 

 Sharon fought for the state of Israel since the age of 14, Blair pointed out. 
He had the quality of leadership in abundance, Blair said. "Once decided he was 
unflinching ... He could leave considerable debris in his wake," Blair said.

Sharon was a standard bearer for Israel leadership, Blair. 

He did not pursue peace as a dreamer, but he did pursue peace, Blair said. 

8.25am GMT 

Former British prime minister and Middle East envoy Tony Blair is speaking. He 
starts by saying his meetings with Sharon were "difficult".

When he invited Sharon to a personal dinner, he said he saw a different Sharon 
who was warm-hearted about Israel, his family and his farm.

Blair said Sharon changed from a man of war to a man of peace, by signing up 
to the road map.

8.22am GMT 

He left us too soon, but the work of trying to find peace continues, Biden 
said. We shall not look upon Sharon's like again, Biden said.

8.21am GMT 

Prime minister Sharon loved the land of Israeli, not just the idea, but the 
land itself, Biden said. He tilled it as a farmer and fought for it as a 
soldier, Biden said. He added that Sharon loved maps.

Biden cited James Joyce who said: "When I die Dublin will be written on my 
heart." Biden said: "I'm absolutely sure that the land of Israel is etched on 
his [Sharon's] heart."

8.17am GMT 

Israel's very survival was against all odds. But thankfully it had a 
generation that understood those odds, Biden said.

Historians will look back and say but for that generation, it is hard to see 
how we would be here today.

Biden brackets Sharon with the generation that founded the Israeli state. 

8.14am GMT 

Biden acknowledged "profound differences" between Sharon and US presidents. 
But he said Sharon lived in "complex times". The arc of Sharon's life traced 
Israel's history, Biden said.

"We have never failed to support Israel's legitimacy ... that will never 
change," Biden said of US foreign policy. "Israel is not going anywhere. As 
long as there is a United States of America, you are not going anywhere," Biden 
added.

8.11am GMT 

Biden remembers an "iconic image" of Sharon as a soldier with a bandage on his 
head. It symbolised Israel's independence and self-sufficiency. The security of 
his people was Arik's unwavering commitment, Biden said using Sharon's nickname.

8.10am GMT 

Biden says Sharon's nickname "bulldozer" was easy to understand. Like all 
leaders he had a "north start" from which he never deviated, Biden said. 
"Before and above all else I am a Jew," Biden remembered Sharon saying. 
"Because he possessed such physical courage, and I would add political courage, 
he never deviated from that interest," Biden said.

8.07am GMT 

US vice president Joe Biden likened Sharon's passing to a "death in the 
family".

He said it was a great honour to speak at the ceremony. "I knew him for over 
30 years," Biden said. He said he was a powerful man who "filled the room".

7.59am GMT 

Harriet Sherwood says there is a notable absence of foreign bigwigs at the 
funeral.

There are no leaders from Africa, the Middle East or Latin America, she points 
out. Most of those attending are fairly junior ministers, she says. The Czech 
republic is the only country to have sent a head of state

7.55am GMT 

Netanyahu has begun his eulogy for Sharon at the Knesset ceremony 

He desribed him as was one of Israel's founding fathers, according to Barak

parliament. Speakers will include Binyamin Netanyahu, Shimon Peres, Tony Blair 
and Joe Biden.

We will have regular updates from our Jerusalem correspondent Harriet Sherwood
. She reports thatSharon divided opinion in death as much as he did in life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/12/ariel-sharon-divides-opinion-sharply-death-life>
.

Here's a Reuters preview of the funeral:

Israel beefed up security for former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's funeral 
near the Gaza border on Monday and warned the enclave's Palestinian rulers not 
to allow rocket fire during the ceremony, which US Vice President Joe Biden 
will attend.

Sharon died at the age of 85 on Saturday after eight years in a coma caused by 
a stroke. A memorial service will be held on Monday in parliament in Jerusalem 
and an afternoon funeral near the Sharon family farm some 10 km (6 miles) from 
Gaza.

The United States was among 18 countries to send delegations to the state 
ceremony for Sharon in Jerusalem. The White House said Biden would also travel 
to the burial at Sycamore Farm's Poppy Hill, in the southern Negev desert.

An Israeli security source said Israel had "passed the message" to Gazan 
authorities to prevent any rocket fire during the funeral. Gaza is governed by 
Hamas Islamists who fought several times with Israel over the past few years.

"It was made clear to them that tomorrow would be a very bad day for anyone 
there to test Israel's patience," said the source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity.

There was no immediate response from the Hamas government or other armed 
Palestinian factions. Egyptian officials, who in the past have served as 
mediators between Israel and Gaza, were unavailable for comment.

A Reuters correspondent heard two explosions in northern Gaza on Monday 
morning which sounded like rocket impacts. An Israeli military spokeswoman said 
there had been no launches across the border. Israeli media said the blasts 
appeared to have resulted from Palestinian militants testing their weapons.

At times of heightened tension Israel steps up aerial patrols of Gaza with 
combat helicopters and drones designed to spot Palestinian rocket crews and hit 
them with guided missiles before they can carry out launches.

Security sources said Israel had deployed an Iron Dome rocket interceptor near 
Sycamore Farm, which has been hit by Gaza-launched rockets in the past.

The rockets are often inaccurate and carry small warheads, causing relatively 
little damage. When fired in salvoes they spread panic and paralyse routine 
life in south Israel.
How to handle Gaza is among the sticking points in Israel's US-sponsored peace 
negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas's rival based in 
the occupied West Bank.

During his brief visit to Israel, Biden will discuss the so far fruitless 
diplomatic efforts with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon 
Peres, U.S. officials said.

The vice president will also seek to ease Netanyahu's concerns about world 
powers' interim nuclear deal with Israel's arch-foe Iran, which takes effect on 
20 January. 

Biden is seen by Israel and its US supporters as one of its best friends in 
Washington in a career dating back to his decades on Capitol Hill, where he 
chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before assuming the vice 
presidency.
Israel's Army Radio said there had been no intelligence indications that 
Palestinians were planning to shell Sharon's funeral. Yet authorities braced 
for any surprise.

"We are taking the full range of possible scenarios into account," southern 
police commander Yoram Halevy told the station. "The IDF (Israel Defence 
Forces) is prepared, informed and ready to respond if so required."
Since a 2012 eight-day war with Israel, which killed some 170 Palestinians and 
six Israelis, Hamas has largely held fire but smaller militant groups have 
occasionally challenged its authority with their own rocket attacks into the 
Jewish state.
