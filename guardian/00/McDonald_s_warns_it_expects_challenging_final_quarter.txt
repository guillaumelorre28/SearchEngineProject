McDonald's <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mcdonalds> warned on Monday 
that it expected to "remain challenged" in the final quarter of its financial 
year as it faced increasing competition and a tough economic climate around the 
world.

The UK was one of the fast food chain's strongest markets, where president and 
chief executive Don Thompson said McDonald's continued to gain share and 
increase underlying sales by drawing in breakfast customers and making itself 
into a "beverage destination" with the launch of fruit smoothies over the 
summer. The firm wants to build on that by launching its McCaf√© range of 
espresso-based coffees in the next months.

But it revealed that underlying sales rose just 0.9% worldwide in the three 
months to the end of September, as total revenues rose 2% amid declining sales 
in its Asia, Middle East and Africa region.

Operating income slumped 4% in constant currencies in that region, reflecting 
falling underlying sales in China and Japan. In Europe, a strong performance in 
the UK, Russia and France was offset by poor sales in Germany, while sales 
growth remained sluggish in the US.

McDonalds said it expected "the dynamics of the current environment to 
persist," into its fourth quarter. The lacklustre sales and profits growth 
increases pressure on relatively new boss Thompson. He has shaken up the 
management team and brought in menu ideas to try and boost sales and profits.
