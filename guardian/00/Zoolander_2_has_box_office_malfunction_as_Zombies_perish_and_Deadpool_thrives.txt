Hollywood’s association with Marvel has produced pretty reliable returns for 
Paramount (early films in the Avengers series) and Sony (Spider-Man), and 
Disney’s $4bn acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2009 has proved a cash 
bonanza for the studio, with more Avengers films, Guardians of the Galaxy and 
Ant-Man.

Over at Fox, which arguably kick-started the current cycle of comic-book 
blockbusters with 2000’s X-Men, results with Marvel characters have been more 
mixed. X-Men 2 (£20.7m) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (£27.3m) are the only 
two in the series to crack £20m at the UK box office, while two attempts at 
Fantastic Four never got the formula quite right. Spinoffs X-Men Origins: The 
Wolverine and The Wolverine managed £16.4m and £13.8m respectively.

Based on the performance of those films, expectations might have been modest 
forDeadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
, a spinoff featuring a character briefly introduced in X-Men Origins: 
Wolverine, and starring an actor (Ryan Reynolds) who had already commercially 
failed as a superhero in DC Comics’ Green Lantern. Director Tim Miller, known 
for animation and visual effects, had never helmed a feature film, and Deadpool 
didn’t look an obvious fit for the Valentine’s Day audience.

At the Baftas <https://www.theguardian.com/film/baftas-2016> on Sunday night, 
with Rentrak returns flooding on to attendees’ hand-held devices, executives 
across the UK film industry confessed themselves stunned by the Deadpool 
numbers. A debut of £13.73m including previews of £3.76m – that result is way 
bigger than anyone expected. It’s bigger than the opening weekends of all three 
of Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man films (although Spider-Man 3’s £11.8m debut has the 
edge if Deadpool’s previews are stripped out). It’s pretty much dead level with 
the opening of Iron Man 3 (£13.71m including £2.32m in previews), and far ahead 
of the debuts for Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Guardians of the Galaxy kicked off 
with £6.36m, including £1.37m in previews – numbers that were considered a 
surprise success at the time.

Deadpool <https://www.theguardian.com/film/deadpool> is rated 15 for “strong 
bloody violence, strong language, sex references” and its tone and content 
clearly distinguishes the film from other Marvel properties. While that 
represented a risk for Fox, its distinctiveness was also an opportunity to 
offer audiences something different in an increasingly crowded space. The risk 
has paid off handsomely.

The runner-up: the Chipmunks

Fox has even more to smile about this week, as Alvin and the Chipmunks: the 
Road Chip 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/alvin-chipmunks-road-chip-review-minions-uptown-funk>
 is convincingly winning the battle for the half-term audience. The fourth film 
in the series begins its run with £4.30m including previews of £1.70m. Previous 
entry Chipwrecked began in December 2011 with £2.36m including £675,000 in 
previews, when it faced direct competition from Arthur Christmas, Puss in 
Boots, Hugo and Happy Feet 2. Predecessor The Squeakquel kicked off with £5.35m 
including very extensive previews totalling £4.00m. The Road Chip is benefiting 
from its February half-term release date – a key slot that in past years has 
been nabbed by big hitters such as Big Hero 6, The Lego Movie and Wreck-It 
Ralph. Alvin is facing off against family adventureGoosebumps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/05/goosebumps-review-jack-black-horror-writer-rl-stine>
 and lesser titles.

Third place: Zoolander 2

Although the original Zoolander film enjoys significant affection with film 
fans, it was commercially modest on its cinema release (2001), grossing just 
£2.18m in total in the UK. Still, the same is also true of the first Anchorman 
film (grossing £1.59m here) and the sequel went on to huge success (£14.51m). 
Paramount had every reason to expect a big opening forZoolander 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/zoolander-2>, with media happily exploiting 
images of Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and other cast members performing photo 
stunts at a series of premieres (technically billed as “fan screenings”) all 
around the world.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/feb/10/has-ben-stiller-become-derek-zoolander>
The result: a UK debut of £2.09m, including previews of £670,000. While 
Paramount will take comfort from having already almost matched the lifetime of 
Zoolander, it must surely be disappointed not to have pushed the number higher. 
Zoolander 2 enjoys a weak 5.3/10 IMDb user rating and a 35/100 MetaCritic 
score. Prospects do not look great for a strong sustain, although this week’s 
half-term holiday will work in the 12A-rated film’s favour.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, adapted by the book credited to Seth 
Grahame-Smith and Jane Austen, was always a risky proposition: would fans of 
Austen’s Georgian-era romances be enticed by the addition of zombies, and would 
genre fans be intrigued by the mash-up with the world of the Bennett sisters 
and Mr Darcy? It didn’t help that Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, similarly 
adapted from a Grahame-Smith work, commercially underperformed.

In this instance, the risk has not paid off, since the tonally unusual film 
has debuted here with a poor £357,000 from 332 cinemas, including £65,000 in 
previews. A quick exit looks likely.

Concussion <https://www.theguardian.com/film/concussion>, starring Will Smith 
as an African-born doctor taking on the American football establishment on the 
issue of head injuries, always looked a very tricky sell in the UK. Awards 
attention would have helped push the film across to audiences, but Concussion 
made no headway at the Baftas or Oscars, and a Golden Globe nomination for 
Smith wasn’t enough to create excitement. Sony released the film in 169 
cinemas, achieving an opening gross of £112,000.

Jem and the Holograms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/22/jem-and-the-holograms-review>, 
based on the 1980s American TV cartoon series, pretty much evaporated on 
contact with cinemas, beginning with £8,900 from 98 venues, yielding a woeful 
£91 site average.

Landing just outside the top 10, A Bigger Splash  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/11/a-bigger-splash-review-tilda-swinton-ralph-fiennes-luca-guadagnino>
begins its run with £348,000 from 101 cinemas, including previews of £43,000. 
Comparisons are tricky since director Luca Guadagnino’s previous feature I Am 
Love was primarily in Italian, despite Tilda Swinton in the lead role. That 
film began with a robust £172,000 from just 35 cinemas, on its way to a 
lifetime total of £927,000. A Bigger Splash, starring Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, 
Matthias Schoenaerts and Dakota Johnson, is an English-language film, and a 
loose remake of 1969 French title La Piscine.

Thanks to Deadpool, grosses overall are 135% up on the previous frame, and 
also 15% up on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when Fifty Shades of Grey 
exploded with a £13.55m debut. Cinema bookers will be hoping for a strong hold 
from Deadpool and solid returns from family titles this weekend as kids prepare 
to go back to school next Monday. As for newcomers,How to Be Single 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/12/how-to-be-single-review-rebel-wilson-dakota-johnson>
 should play both as a date movie and a chick flick, while John Hillcoat’s 
nicely cast Triple 9 should skew more male, as will the 18-certificateBone 
Tomahawk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/15/craig-zahler-on-bone-tomahawk>, 
starring Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson. Coast Guard rescue true tale The 
Finest Hours has already opened softly in the US. Alternatives include indie 
drama Freeheld, with Julianne Moore and Ellen Page.
