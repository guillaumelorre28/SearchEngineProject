The Italian man who spent four years in prison for the murder of the British 
studentMeredith Kercher <https://www.theguardian.com/world/meredithkercher> has 
denied that his new business venture, “a social network for graves”, is morbid.

Raffaele Sollecito – who announced last month that he is seeking more than 
€500,000 (A$790,000) in compensation for wrongful imprisonment – hasexpanded on 
his vision 
<http://www.thelocal.it/20160208/raffaele-sollecito-creates-a-social-network-for-the-dead>
 for Memories to the English-language Italian newspaper the Local.

Members will be able to create profile pages for their deceased friends and 
relatives, on which they can post photos and videos.

They will also be able to order “graveside services” such as flowers, candles, 
wreaths and even the cleaning of tombstones and mausoleums online through 
Memories’ bespoke “e-commerce portal”. Prices for services will start at €45.

Sollecito is also hoping to offer a personalised urn service.

Memories’ website <http://beonmemories.com/> describes it as a “work in 
progress”. Sollecito has been contacted by email for comment.

Asked by the Local if he did not think that the enterprise was “a little 
morbid”, he said it was “innovative”.

“There’s no other service like this at the moment,” he said. “I think it’s a 
really sweet idea and a good way to remember the dead.”

He said he had come up with the idea after the death of his mother in 2005.

The 31-year-old and his former girlfriend Amanda Knox spent nearly four years 
in prison for the murder of Kercher beforebeing cleared by

 Italy’s highest court last March.

He announced in January that he is seeking more 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/raffaele-sollecito-sues-for-wrongful-imprisonment>
 than €500,000 – the maximum amount he could have asked for – in compensation 
for wrongful imprisonment.

Sollecito completed a degree in computer science through the University of 
Perugia while in prison in 2008.


He received a €66,000 grant from Puglia’s regional government for Memories, as 
well as some funding from his family “to cover small expenses”.

He began working on Memories in October 2014 and told the Local it would be 
online by the European spring.

Though people can sign up to Memories from anywhere in the world, it will only 
cover graves inItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, says Sollecito, 
though he has ambitions of global expansion.
