What are your earliest memories of writing?
Doing family plays – Christmas shows, that kind of thing – with my sister (1 <>
 <>) at home. Then writing short stories and sonnets at school in York in my 
teens.

What was your big breakthrough?
Being forced by circumstance to sit down and write my first novel (2 <> <>). 
I'd just left Cambridge, I was newly married and unemployed, so I needed 
something to do.

How has the publishing industry changed during your career?
Beyond recognition. When I finished my first novel, I put it in a brown 
envelope and sent it to Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Now, I don't imagine they'd even 
look at it. From what I hear, there's much more pressure on novelists, too: 
you're very lucky to get your first book published, then the publishers watch 
the bottom line on the second book – and if they don't like it, they drop you. 
That just wasn't true in my day.

Of which book are you most proud?
The Needle's Eye (3 <> <>), for most neatly getting across what I was trying 
to say about equality and the human condition.

Novels by women are often dismissed as "domestic fiction". Have you had to 
work harder to be taken seriously?
No. I don't think this is as true as it's perceived to be. Alice Munro has 
just won the Nobel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/21/alice-munro-nobel-ceremony-82-health>
 for very small-scale stories. And in the 1960s, women's fiction was both 
fashionable and intellectual – just think of Sylvia Plath and Doris Lessing. I 
hear that feminism has died a death now, and that everyone just talks about 
makeup. Presumably the mis-categorisation of "domestic fiction" could be part 
of that. I'm just lucky not to have been affected by it.

Do you suffer for your art?
No. I find writing increasingly difficult, but I still think being a novelist 
is a fairly pain-free choice.

What advice would you give a young writer?
Stick at it. It's very important to finish a novel rather than begin lots of 
new ones. You learn a lot just from getting to the end.

What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you?
Al Alvarez (4 <> <>) once said I'd never written a sentence worth reading, or 
something like that. It seemed quite harsh.

What's the biggest myth about being a novelist?
That everything is autobiographical. But it's even more of a myth that nothing 
is.

Which artists do you most admire?
I think about Shakespeare every day. And reading Wordsworth makes you feel 
that ordinary life has dignity and beauty.

Is there anything about your writing life that you regret?
There were times when I regretted taking on The Oxford Companion to English 
Literature(5 <> <>). It took five years, and was a tremendous burden – but in 
the end, I was rather glad I'd done it.

How would you like to be remembered?
For keeping faith with the world I lived in. I see books as part of a 
continuum – you do your bit in your lifetime, and hope it adds to the sum of 
things.
