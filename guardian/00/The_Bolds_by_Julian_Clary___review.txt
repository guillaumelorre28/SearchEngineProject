The Bolds starts with a funny start:

Once I told a lie at school and my friends bit me on the leg and put tomato 
sauce on me and from that day on I’ve never told a lie again.

But if you hear these words please don’t think The Bolds is a true story 
because it is actually not! If you’re wondering who the Bolds are, they are 
hyenas that are in England, living as humans.

At the beginning they were just normal hyenas in a park, and people were in 
the water having a swim and a crocodile came and ate them. So the woman hyena 
said “can you stand up on your back legs?” and the boy one said “yes I can”. So 
they tried on the clothes of humans and used their passports to go on an 
aeroplane up to England. They were hardly recognised as hyenas, they kept their 
tails well hidden.

I really liked this book. There were lots of funny bits, like Miranda, if 
you’re wondering, is actually a.... ooh ooh aah aah monkey! Once she actually 
stuck her head and hands in the toilet and threw splashes out on the next door 
neighbour! I would recommend this to someone who really likes funniness and 
cheekiness. I really liked this story.
