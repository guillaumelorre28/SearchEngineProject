Andr√© Villas-Boas <https://www.theguardian.com/football/andre-villas-boas> has 
admitted he had "great ambitions" to win a trophy at Tottenham this season and 
dropped a heavy hint that his next job in management will not be in England.

Villas-Boas, speaking for the first time since his dismissal as Spurs manager 
earlier this month, said he was looking at "repositioning" his career after his 
two disappointing managerial spells in England.

"I wish I could have responded to the confidence shown by the fans with a 
trophy," Villas-Boas told the Portuguese newspaper O Jogo. "I had great 
ambitions to win a trophy this season."

With his reputation in England having taken a big hit, Villas-Boas looks set 
to be planning a return to management on the continent. The 36-year-old was not 
short of offers last summer. He rejected overtures from Paris St Germain and 
has recently been linked with AC Milan.

In the interview he refers to his time in England in the past tense and talks 
of "re-positioning" his career, suggesting that he will not be looking for a 
new post in the Premier League any time soon.

"This is a time of reflection for me and my staff and for repositioning of our 
careers," he said. "Nevertheless England was a great experience."

Meanwhile the Spurs midfielder Lewis Holtby believes Tim Sherwood and his 
coaching staff must be given time to adapt.

"The coaches who are in, they've only had a short time. It's not that easy for 
them to come in and show you a different style," he said. "We're trying to 
adapt that as quickly as we can and I think we're positive about the coming 
weeks. I think we can get there quickly.

"I think they've done a really good job coming in here in a very hectic period 
of the season and we just have to follow their lead and try to do everything 
they say."
