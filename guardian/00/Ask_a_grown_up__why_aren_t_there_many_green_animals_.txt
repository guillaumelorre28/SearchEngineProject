That's a very good question, considering so much of the natural world is green 
and camouflage so important in it, but I'm afraid there is no simple answer. 
Many animals are green, for instance snakes, frogs, lots of insects and some 
birds, but many mammals are not, because they have found other ways to protect 
themselves from predators. For example, many are nocturnal or live underground 
in burrows in the dark, so colour isn't a necessity for camouflage. Other 
larger animals, such as zebras, prefer to live in the long grass, where it is 
far better to have a pattern that will break up the animals' body shape, and to 
be equipped to be very agile under threat of attack.

Many mammals do not differentiate colours – in other words, they are 
colour-blind – so it wouldn't matter if they were green or brown. And as 
humans, we see colour differently from animals, so what we perceive to be good 
camouflage actually may not be to them.
