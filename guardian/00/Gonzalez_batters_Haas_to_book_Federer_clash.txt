Fernando Gonzalez will take part in his first grand slam final after 
bludgeoning his way past Tommy Haas in straight sets.

The Australian Open's second semi-final had much to live up to after defending 
champion Roger Federer's imperious dismissal of sixth seed Andy Roddick 
yesterday, but Gonzalez has been in a rich vein of form himself so far in 2007, 
and his 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 win here was every bit as emphatic.

Dominating twelfth seed Haas with a series of powerful baseline strokes, 
Gonzalez hit 42 winners and just three unforced errors in the 23 games. 
Shellshocked Haas only registered his first point mid-way through the third 
game, and never threatened to break his opponent in a match that lasted a 
meagre 91 minutes.

"Today was really good," said Gonzalez afterwards. "The last three or four 
matches I have been playing really great tennis. I'm enjoying it a lot and I'm 
playing all over the court. I was very calm at the important moments."

Gonzalez, the tenth seed, has won his last three games - against Haas, fifth 
seed James Blake and world No2 Rafael Nadal - in straight sets, but remains a 
heavy underdog for Sunday's match against Federer, who is yet to drop a set in 
this year's tournament.

"Roger is number one by far," acknowledged Gonzalez. "I have lost many times 
to him, but I know that I am playing much better than the last time that we 
played. This is only one match, I am playing well myself and I will look 
forward to playing him."
