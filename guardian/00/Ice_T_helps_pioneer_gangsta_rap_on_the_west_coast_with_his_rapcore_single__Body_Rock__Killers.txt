Hip-hop <https://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop> had planted roots on the 
west coast by the early 80s but it was stylistically in hock to the east coast. 
When Ice T released Body Rock he was already 25. His rapping style is straight 
New York, short sing-song rhymes in the style of Kurtis Blow. The B-side, 
Killers, is more interesting; the style is the same, but the content different 
â€“ short violent parables both fantastical and offering social commentary. The 
seeds are planted of a new style of rap.
