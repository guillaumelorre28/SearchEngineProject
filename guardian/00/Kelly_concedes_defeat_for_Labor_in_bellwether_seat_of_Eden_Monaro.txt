The former minister for defence materiel, Mike Kelly, has conceded defeat in 
his NSW electorate of Eden-Monaro, confirming its status as a bellwether seat.

Kelly had been trailing the Liberals' Peter Hendy since the weekend's 
election, and on Friday morning finally threw in the towel.

"To all my valued friends on Twitter, I'm sorry to have to say I will be 
conceding this morning," he tweeted. "It's over. Thank you for your support."

Kelly, a former army officer who entered parliament in 2007, had on Saturday 
night been hopeful of bucking the national trend against Labor.

However, his slight lead quickly evaporated during the week, and on Friday he 
trailed by 633 votes.

Eden-Monaro has long been thought of as a bellwether for the overall federal 
result, the seat having fallen to whichever party takes government since 1972.

The electorate stretches from Queanbeyan in the southern tablelands to the NSW 
coast and down to the Victorian border.

Hendy is a former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry and in 2008 was chief of staff to then Liberal leader Brendan Nelson.
