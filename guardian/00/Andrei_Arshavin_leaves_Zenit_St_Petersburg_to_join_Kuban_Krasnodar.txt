The former Arsenal forward Andrei Arshavin has joined the Russian Premier 
League side Kuban Krasnodar after leavingZenit St Petersburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zenitstpetersburg>.

The 34-year-old Arshavin won his third Russian title with Zenit last season 
but was a fringe player in André Villas-Boas’s team and departed when his 
contract expired at the end of the campaign.

He joins a Kuban team who struggled last season with a below-expectations 
10th-place finish in the league amid reported financial problems.

The club is backed by the regional government and Arshavin met with the acting 
governor before signing with Kuban.

Arshavin has 75 caps for the Russian national team but last played for Russia 
in 2012 when he was booed by fans during the coach Fabio Capello’s first game 
in charge.

He joined Arsenal from Zenit in 2009

 when Arsène Wenger played a club record fee of £15m, but he rarely lived up to 
his potential and returned to Zenit on loan in 2012, before making the move 
back permanently in 2013.
