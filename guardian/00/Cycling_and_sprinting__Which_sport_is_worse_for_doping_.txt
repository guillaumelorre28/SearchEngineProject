It has not been a good few weeks for the reputations of cycling and 100 metre 
sprinting.

The ghost of Lance Armstrong's dope-fuelled achievements has haunted Team Sky 
and its BritishTour de France <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> 
leader Chris Froome all the way on their trip through the mountains.

Froome's team manager Dave Brailsford has even offered to hand over all of 
Team Sky's data 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/15/sky-dave-brailsford-doping> to the 
authorities to prove that the South African-born Brit is not using drugs.

Meanwhile on the track, the world's two fastest men over 100 metres this year, 
Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay, have both taken doping tests thatcame out positive 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/14/tyson-gay-tests-positive-banned-substance>
. They follow the shaming of Jamaica's female Olympic champion Shelley-Ann 
Fraser-Pryce andtriple Olympic gold medallist Veronica Campbell-Brown 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/18/veronica-campbell-brown-drugs-suspended>
, and cast a further shadow over the successes of sprinters globally.

To see the extent of doping in both sports we have looked at the data since 
the formation of the World anti-doping authority (WADA) in 1999 to see which 
sport has been hit worst by doping scandals.

Doping: a dangerous cycle

Despite accusations of drug-use in the Tour de France having been around since 
the 1920s, the spokes really came off the wheel in January when seven-time 
winner Lance Armstrongfinally confessed to extensive drug-use 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/18/lance-armstrong-admits-doping-oprah-winfrey>
 throughout his victories.

Indeed, the Tour de France has fared much worse than its fellow grand tours, 
the Giro D'Italia and the Vuelta D'España, when it comes to top three finishers 
who have admitted to doping or been found guilty of doing so.

Over half of the 42 top three finishers in the Tour de France from 1999 to 
2012 have been found guilty of doping at some point in their career. This is 
relatively unsurprising when you consider that multiple winners Armstrong and
Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> are 
making up almost half of those drug users.

Only three general classification champions of the Tour de France since 1999, 
Carlos Sastre, Cadel Evans and Froome's fellow Team Sky member Bradley Wiggins, 
have never been found guilty of doping offences.

This means that a blood-spinning 79% of tour winners since the late 90s have 
been dopers. It would be a tough climb for any sport to top the drug problems 
of cycling, which is why some have questioned whether it is impossible to win 
the Tour de France without doping

.

Doping endemic to successful sprinting

The revelations over the last few weeks that so many top sprinters have tested 
positive for doping offences have led to perhaps the darkest days for sprinting 
since the2002 BALCO scandal <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BALCO_scandal>. 

Shamed sprinter Tyson Gay has lost his lucrative sponsorship deal 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/15/asafa-powell-sherone-simpson-tyson-gay>
 with Adidas and some inside athletics havecalled for the punishment for doping 
offences to be pumped up 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/15/sprinters-drug-tests-london-olympics-anniversary>
.

Of the top ten male 100 metre sprinters each year since 1999, including 2013 
so far, just under 40% have been found guilty of doping offences at some point 
in their career. The chart below shows how the layout of the top ten was made 
up of dopers and non-dopers each year.

In several years the number of dopers in the top ten actually exceeded the 
number of those who were not doping. In 2013 so far, four of the top ten 
sprinters have been found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs at some 
point in their career.

Between 2004 and 2007, the best time each year was run by someone who has been 
found guilty of doping. In 2004, it was American sprinter Justin Gaitlin and 
then for the next three years JamaicanAsafa Powell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/asafapowell> continuously run the best time.

The world's fastest man Usain Bolt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usainbolt> has never registered as positive 
on a drugs test. His record of 9.58 set at the 2008 Beijing Olympics remains 
untainted by a drug conviction.

The records do not include sprinters who have subsequently had their times 
erased because of doping scandals. However, the frequency of drug usage in the 
revised statistics shows how much of modern sprinting history is still affected 
by drug-use.

Everyone is a loser

While cycling and sprinting are in the news for these recent revelations, it 
is worth noting that the use of illegal supplements is not confined to these 
pursuits.

Take a look at wider athletics and the accusations of widespread doping in 
Russia, which has been embarrassing sporting authorities in the run up to the 
country's hosting of the World Championships later this year.

Even the seemingly clean sport of tennis has been tainted by scandals 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/mar/26/wayne-odesnik-drugs-australia> in 
the past. With such a high percentage of sportsmen doping and famed champions 
continually being revealed as cheats, no sport seems safe from drugs scandals.

It might even be the case that cycling and athletics are disproportionately 
good at detecting it.
