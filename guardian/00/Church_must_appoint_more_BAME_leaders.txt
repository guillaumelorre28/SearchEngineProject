We are pleased to receive the news Rev Dr Woyin Karowei Dorgu will be the next 
bishop of Woolwich (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/20/church-of-england-appoints-first-black-bishop-20-years-woyin-karowei-dorgu>
, 21 December). We congratulate Dr Dorgu and the diocese of Southwark on this 
decision. We have no doubt that Dr Dorgu, through his skills, experience and 
background, will enrich the leadership team of the diocese and add to its 
effectiveness in God’s mission. The Anglican Minority Ethnic Network (Amen) has 
been a strong advocate for greater diversity in the senior leadership of the 
Church of England, primarily because we believe it makes the church more 
effective in its mission. A diverse senior leadership team pulls experience and 
skills from a more diverse background, which experience shows makes for better 
teams and stronger leadership. Diversity at the very top also shows people 
inside and outside the church that we are a church for everyone.

Sadly, even with this appointment, the C of E is still well behind where it 
should be on this issue. So we hope that this would be one of many. Much more 
needs to be done to correct the church’s weakness in the area of ethnic 
diversity in leadership and redress the 20-year gap before this appointment was 
made.
Rev Shemil Mathew
Secretary, Amen
