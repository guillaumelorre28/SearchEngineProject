The Magic Mates go on a holiday which they won but they all split up and end 
up in a movie place on a tropical island. The tension builds when the girls are 
scared a mysterious man is behind them. I love all of the girls in this series 
because they are all so funny and giggly. I would recommend this book to 
readers from age 8-12 as it is quite short and very easy to read. I give this 
book a rating of 4/5.

The Worst Witch by Jill Murphy
 Jill Murphy, The Worst Witch 
The Worst Witch is about a school for witches and there is a horrible teacher. 
They all get a cat each and they all have to try and persuade the cat to ride 
on the broomsticks. I liked the part where Mildred got her cat to get on the 
broomstick. My favourite character in the book is Mildred and I would recommend 
this book to readers of all ages from 11-16. I give this a rating of 3/5 
because I liked it but have read better books.

Undead by Kirsty Mckay
 Kirsty McKay, Undead 
Undead is about a group of teenagers caught in the middle of a zombie 
apocalypse whilst they are on a school trip. The characters were really good 
because they represented the four different student groups in the classroom: 
the genius, the popular, the rebel and the new kid. This made the story 
interesting. I liked Bobby so much because she reminds me of myself. If you are 
a fan of comedy and horror together then I recommend this book to you and I 
give this book 5/5 because I enjoyed it!

Granny by Anthony Horowitz
 Anthony Horowitz, Granny 
This book is about a family and Joe is very suspicious of his Granny. This is 
because she is always secretly being mean to him but when he says this, nobody 
believes him. But Joe knows she is pure evil! The best thing about this book is 
the concept of the story because it really drew me in from the first page. It 
is very funny and interesting. Granny is my favourite character in the book 
because she is so mean and always gets what she wants. I would recommend this 
book to any reader who likes mysteries or comedies as this is both! I give this 
book 5/5.
