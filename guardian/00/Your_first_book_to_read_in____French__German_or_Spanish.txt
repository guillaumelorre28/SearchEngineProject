Reading in another language feels like taking a trip to another country 
independently! No parents allowed. I felt so empowered when I first read The 
Little Prince in French, or Harry Potter in English (not my native language). 
The feeling hasn’t really ever gone away.

So we’ve collected some of the best stories in French, Spanish and German to 
help you improve your foreign language skills. They’re easy to read but fun and 
magical.

And we’ve got some tips to make reading easier: 

Tip number one: read the book in original next to the book translated into 
English, and check the sentences or words you don’t know in the English 
edition. But don’t cheat and only read it in translation! You won’t learn much 
French that way (or indeed Spanish or German).

Tip number two: write down the word you don’t know in your vocabulary notebook 
– it sounds tedious but it’s so useful to have one – and look up the word in 
the dictionary. I know it can be a fuss but trust me, it’s such a good habit to 
cultivate - I still use the dictionary all the time today, and it has become a 
pleasure (I mean some words are just weird!) and not just a chore, to do it.

And now let’s get going! 

French




1. Big Wolf and Small Wolf, or Grand Loup et Petit Loup, by Nadine Brun-Cosme 
and Olivier Tallec is the most poetic and heartwarming book about friendship. 
Big Wolf is morose and looks mean. But really he’s just lonely. This is only 
until Small Wolf comes into his life with two oranges and Big Wolf realises he 
can never get back to solitude afterwards. This contemporary Little Prince has 
won lots of hearts in France.

2. The Secret Life of Princesses, or Princesses Oubliées ou Inconnues by 
Philippe Lechermeier and Rebecca Dautremer is the most magical and 
sophisticated book. It’s a Who’s Who of the princess world. None of those old 
princesses we already know and have got over. I mean, these princesses have got 
character - Doremi, Capriciosa, Catch-catch, von Badaboum... Find out their 
stories, secrets and follow them in their bath or on the... battlefield.

inspired by one of the greatest novelists of all time, Leo Tolstoy, beautifully 
adapted and illustrated for young readers.

4. The Little Prince <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-prince-23.html>, 
orLe Petit Prince 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/333714/> by Antoine de 
Saint-Exupéry- it’s the absolute classic. A book for both adults and children 
about a prince fallen from asteroid B-612, where he has left three volcanoes 
and a rose he loves. On earth he meets all sorts of odd grown ups – a king, a 
conceited man, a drunkard, a lamplighter, a geographer… and he makes friends 
with a fox. The story is so good that it’s one of the most translated French 
books, published in 253 languages. I promise you will carry it with you in your 
hearts for the rest of your life. Or at least I have.

1. Cali and Mona, or Cali y Mona by Pepe Valle and Margarita Sada, tells the 
story of Cali, a blind girl who lived for 23 years without a guide dog. Cali’s 
strict Muslim parents thought dogs were too unclean so they forbade her to have 
one. But when she hears a story about ponies that get trained to help the 
blind, she starts saving money to get one even if no one else believes this 
works. The book is published in both Spanish and Braille (the alphabet read by 
the blind with their fingers). The story is inspired by a real case.

Maria to dedicate herself to plants and flowers.

4. Forbidden to Read Lewis Carroll, or Prohibido Leer a Lewis Carroll by Diego 
Arboleda and Raul Sagospe (illustrator). An amusing read about Alice Liddell, a 
total fan of Lewis Carroll’s story, dressing exactly like Alice in Wonderland 
and looking for her rabbit in the garden. Her parents are driven to despair by 
Alice’s passion so they forbid the new nanny to tell the girl that the real 
Alice who inspired Lewis Carroll, now 80, is visiting their town. A fascinating 
tale about lies, truth and the liberty of imagination. The book was a total 
sensation in Spain, winning several prizes for children’s fiction. But I must 
warn you: this is a slightly longer read than the books above!

1. The Trip to Panama 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/343769/>, or Oh, Wie 
Schön ist Panama, by Janosch.A lovely story about a little bear and a little 
tiger going to find the land of all possibilities, the land where bananas grow. 
They find their dreamland, although it’s not exactly what they imagined it to 
be. A book German children have been reading for 40 years. It feels freeing and 
joyful to read for both adults and children.

2. Momo <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/momo.html> by Michael Ende is a 
beautiful story about how we spend our time. Momo is a girl who has an 
extraordinary ability to listen. This makes her loved by her village as she 
helps everyone overcome their problems, and is great at thinking of new games. 
But the Men in Grey, who are actually paranormal parasites and not humans, come 
and trick the community in order to steal their time. As people start 
depositing their time to the Bank, their life becomes dry and sad. All social 
activities, art, imagination and sleeping are gone as they are considered time 
wasting. People realise that instead of saving, they lose time. Momo is the 
only person the Men in Grey haven’t tricked and she parts on an adventure to 
save her village.

4. Heidi <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/heidi.html> by Johanna Spiry is one 
of the most loved characters of all time. Born in the Swiss Alps, Heidi is an 
orphan who grows up with her morose grandpa. As soon as she comes to her 
grandpa’s house she melts everyone’s heart with her warmth and spark. She then 
leaves for the city and befriends Clara, a disabled girl based in Frankfurt who 
is amused by Heidi’s inability to get her head round city life. Back to the 
mountains, Clara learns how to walk without her wheel chair! A book about 
friendship within and across generations and making the best of your 
circumstances, whatever they are! Now admittedly, you may need the English 
version of the story to sway to with this one.
