Award ceremonies fairly often choose the right winners. Occasionally, they can 
also make a bit of history.The Oscars 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16700124> made one such award 
this week by choosingAsghar Farhadi's movie A Separation 
<http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/01/09/120109crci_cinema_lane>
 as best foreign-language film. The choice was right because the movie is a 
beautifully judged depiction of the way marital breakdown in any culture can 
suck children, parents, friends and strangers into its bleak vortex. But the 
award makes history because A Separation is the first Iranian movie to win an 
Oscar.Millions of Iranians followed the Hollywood ceremony

via illegal satellite dishes, enabling them to hear Mr Farhadi tell a wider 
world there is a richer modern Iran than is covered by"the heavy dust of 
politics".

 Mr Farhadi is a master film-maker. He has also provided a glimpse of Iran that 
reveals an intimate and poignantly familiar human fallibility that transcends 
all political posturing and vaults all the world's religious and cultural 
barriers.
