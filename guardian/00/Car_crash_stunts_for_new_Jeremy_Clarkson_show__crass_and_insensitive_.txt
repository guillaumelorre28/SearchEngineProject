Road safety charities have condemned mock car crashes staged as a publicity 
stunt for Jeremy Clarkson’s new motoring show as “crass, insensitive and 
desperate”.

The fake collisions appeared in London, Berlin and Los Angeles to promote the 
former Top Gear presenter’s return to TV alongside sidekicks Richard Hammond 
and James May.The Grand Tour 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Grand-Tour-Season-1/dp/B01J93ZNN2> will launch on 
Amazon Prime Video this week.


In King’s Cross, central London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, a 
white Toyota Prius – a hybrid vehicle frequently mocked by Clarkson – appeared 
to have been crashed into a postbox, crumpling its bonnet.

Similarly wrecked cars also appeared in Berlin’s Hackescher Markt and on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame, where a blue Prius with the number plate CLARK50N had 
been made to look as if it had fallen from the sky.

 Gary Rae, the campaigns director for the road safety charity Brake 
<http://www.brake.org.uk/?gclid=CKLcjtOpq9ACFZUW0wodTvUK9w>, said: “This is a 
crass, insensitive and desperate stunt. Though I’m not surprised, as this team 
has a track record of glorifying speed, and ignoring the devastating 
consequences of dangerous driving. Programmes like Top Gear and its new rival, 
Grand Tour, need to recognise that car worship is dated and misplaced.”

 Edmund King, the president of the AA, said: “The picture clearly illustrates 
that crashing cars can be incredibly dangerous. However, looking on the 
brighter side we note that the 2016 Toyota Prius scores the top-rated five 
stars inEuroNCAP crash tests 
<http://www.euroncap.com/en/results/toyota/prius/24572>. We wonder whether The 
Grand Tour will rate five stars with the viewers.”

Clarkson, the presenter and Sunday Times columnist, was dropped by the BBC in 
March last year after he punched and verbally abused a junior Top Gear producer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/25/jeremy-clarkson-top-gear-contract-bbc>
. Hammond and May opted to leave the programme with him.

Clarkson once said the Prius was a “God-awful” car bought by “morons who think 
they’re saving the planet”.

“This is one of my least favourite cars in the world because as far as I can 
see it appeals on no levels at all,” he said in one Top Gear episode. “It 
certainly isn’t pretty. Honestly I’d rather look at a baboon. In fact, some to 
think of it, I’d rather look at the back of a baboon … and in a desperate bid 
to keep the weight down, they seem to have made it out of tracing paper.”

Toyota, meanwhile, was not aggravated by the stunt. A spokesperson said they 
were “very much looking forward to the series”.
