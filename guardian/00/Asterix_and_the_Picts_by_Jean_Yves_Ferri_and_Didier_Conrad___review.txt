Quickly, they call all of the Gauls to help them free the Pict man. Together 
they take the Pict man to Getafixi's hut. Suddenly the Pict man pops out of the 
ice and starts to walk. The Pict man sees a tiny man with a stone tablet 
talking to him and also writing things down on his stone tablet. As the Pict 
man can't speak he tells them his story in actions and carves the way to his 
land on one of Obelix's menhirs. Then the Gauls decide to haveAsterix

land: the land of the Picts. While on the boat the Pict man gets his voice back 
and tells them his name is MacAroon.

If you didn't already know this book wasn't written by the same writer then 
you wouldn't notice the difference. However, if you did already know then you 
would notice small differences like how each character seems to get a more 
equal time in the spotlight. Even though these books might be meant for young 
children, we still never cease to be amused by them. The reason for this is 
that our favourite character, Obelix, plays a great part in all the books and 
we are pleased to see that the new writer still gives Obelix a big role to play.

We think all ages that can read should definitely read this book. For all off 
the Asterix and Obelix books we give five out of five stars; for this book by 
itself we give four and a half stars.
