I don't spend a lot of time looking in the mirror – it takes too much energy – 
but when I do, I see a work in progress. I am constantly changing and, 
unfortunately, I've seen my best days. I don't wear earrings any more, although 
I still have the holes, which won't go away. I have kept one particular earring 
for posterity: I wore it when I won the French Open.

Through my tennis career, I have weighed in the low 160lbs up to the high 
170lbs. I am now in the low 180lbs – two to four pounds heavier than I was in 
my playing days. I lift weights and jog up and down hills, but it's an ongoing 
battle.

I didn't expect my hair to fall out. I first noticed it when I was about 19. 
It was hard; I felt my hair was such a big part of me – it was what everyone 
associated me with, and I didn't know how the public would react. So I hid from 
it. I wore headbands to cover my receding hairline, hats and then eventually 
wigs. I felt very fraudulent. I was somebody who talked honestly about 
searching for yourself and being comfortable in that search, even if it means 
pain and difficulty, and here I was not talking about something because I was 
so scared and couldn't come to terms with it.

It wasn't until Wimbledon 1994, when I was 24, that I finally decided to go 
for it and drop the charade.
