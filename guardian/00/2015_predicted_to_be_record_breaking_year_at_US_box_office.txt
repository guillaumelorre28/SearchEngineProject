This is expected to be a record-breaking year at the US box office, according 
to analysts at Morgan Stanley – after which film-industry profits will dip in 
2016.

The firm predicts that blockbusters such as Jurassic World and Avengers: Age 
of Ultron, as well as the forthcoming James Bond film Spectre and JJ Abrams’s 
Star Wars reboot, will push domestic receipts to $11bn (£7.1bn) in 2015,reports

<http://variety.com/2015/film/news/2016-box-office-down-2015-record-1201619066/>
. That’s 2% higher than in 2013, when The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Iron 
Man 3 helped set the current record.

However, Morgan Stanley suggests that profits will fall in 2016, despite the 
planned release of reliable franchise money-makers such as Captain America: 
Civil War and Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

2015 has proved a bumper year for two studios in particular: Disney, which 
owns Marvel, and Universal. Universal had an exceptional year, with a string of 
surprisingly good domestic results for Pitch Perfect 2 ($183m to date), Minions 
($334m) andStraight Outta Compton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/straight-outta-compton> ($160m), each of 
which topped the US box office in their opening weekends. Jurassic World, a 
reboot of the franchise that began with Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg’s 
Jurassic Park, took a record-breaking $500m in its opening weekend, with 
$204.6m of that coming from the US.
