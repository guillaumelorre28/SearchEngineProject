By the time the Slits (above), a rare all-woman band, recorded their debut, 
they had outgrown the bulldozing clatter of their earlier Peel sessions for 
something altogether more intriguing. Produced by Dennis Bovell, Cut cooked up 
a restless, offbeat art-pop from fractured guitar, ever-shifting rhythms and 
the joyful polyglot patois of singer Ari Up, all itchy energy and fizzing with 
invention. Return of the Giant Slits (1981) stepped deeper into dub; Cut, 
meanwhile, still sounds unlike anything else, despite the countless followers 
it has inspired since.
