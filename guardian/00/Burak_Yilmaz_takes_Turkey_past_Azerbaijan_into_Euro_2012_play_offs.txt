Group A with 17 points, two points ahead of the Belgians.

Turkey dominated the first half but rarely threatened to score, except for a

Kazim Kazim that went narrowly wide in the 14th minute.

Yilmaz finally provided Turkey with the goal they needed in the 60th minute, 
converting a perfect through-ball by the Galatasaray midfielder Selcuk Inan, 
who had come on as a substitute just a minute earlier.
