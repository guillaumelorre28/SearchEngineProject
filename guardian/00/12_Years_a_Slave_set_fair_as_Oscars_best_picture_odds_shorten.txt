12 Years a Slave, the epic drama directed by Steve McQueen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen>, has long led the pack in 
the race for best picture. But as the ceremony approaches, its odds continue to 
shorten, tonight inching in at 2/9.

The most striking indicator of its impending triumph, however, is the 
lengthening of Gravity's odds, which stand at the moment at 6/1. That's still 
considerable ahead of the next contenders, American Hustle (39/1) and Dallas 
Buyers Club (74/1).

The 86th Academy Awards are about to commence in Los Angeles, hosted by Ellen 
DeGeneres.
