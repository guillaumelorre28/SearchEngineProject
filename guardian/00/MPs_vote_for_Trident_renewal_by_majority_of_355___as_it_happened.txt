Summary

 * Parliament has voted in favour of renewing Britain’s nuclear deterrent, 
Trident, by a majority of 355 after it was backed by almost the entire 
Conservative party and more than half of Labour MPs. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/18/mps-vote-in-favour-of-trident-renewal-nuclear-deterrent>
AsAnushka Asthana and Rowena Mason report, the vote was passed despite 
opposition from Scottish National party MPs and the Labour leader, Jeremy 
Corbyn, a lifelong unilateralist who spoke out against the plans during a 
debate in parliament on Monday afternoon. Other members of Corbyn’s frontbench 
team, including the shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, and the shadow 
foreign affairs secretary, Emily Thornberry, abstained after claiming in a
Guardian article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/trident-vote-abstaining-nuclear-submarines>
 that the government was turning an issue of “national security into a 
political game”. 
Commons votes for Trident renewal by majority of 355

SNP demands removal of nuclear submarines from Scotland

The SNP is demanding the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Scotland. This is 
from its leader at Westminster,Angus Robertson.

The UK government must respect Scotland’s clear decision against Trident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> renewal and remove these nuclear 
weapons of mass destruction from the Clyde.

As a nation Scotland has consistently shown itself to be opposed to the 
possession of nuclear weapons – a position taken by the Scottish government, 
the Scottish parliament, Scotland’s MPs, a majority of Scotland’s political 
parties, churches, trade unions and other civic organisations.

It would be democratically unacceptable if in the face of this clear 
opposition the UK government were to impose Trident nuclear weapons on the 
Clyde against Scotland’s wishes.

On becoming prime minister Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> claimed that she wanted to 
govern in the interests of all nations and people in the UK – if that is true 
she must now make clear she respects Scotland’s decision.

The UK government must work with the Scottish government to ensure the 
earliest safe withdrawal of nuclear warheads from Scotland, and to discuss the 
retention and diversification of HMNB Clyde as a conventional naval base.

 * Parliament has voted in favour of renewing Britain’s nuclear deterrent, 
Trident, by a majority of 355 after it was backed by almost the entire 
Conservative party and more than half of Labour MPs. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/18/mps-vote-in-favour-of-trident-renewal-nuclear-deterrent>
AsAnushka Asthana and Rowena Mason report, the vote was passed despite 
opposition from Scottish National party MPs and the Labour leader, Jeremy 
Corbyn, a lifelong unilateralist who spoke out against the plans during a 
debate in parliament on Monday afternoon. Other members of Corbyn’s frontbench 
team, including the shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, and the shadow 
foreign affairs secretary, Emily Thornberry, abstained after claiming in a
Guardian article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/trident-vote-abstaining-nuclear-submarines>
 that the government was turning an issue of “national security into a 
political game”. 
Commons votes for Trident renewal by majority of 355

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.
 
The SNP is demanding the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Scotland. This is 
from its leader at Westminster,Angus Robertson.

The UK government must respect Scotland’s clear decision against Trident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> renewal and remove these nuclear 
weapons of mass destruction from the Clyde.

As a nation Scotland has consistently shown itself to be opposed to the 
possession of nuclear weapons – a position taken by the Scottish government, 
the Scottish parliament, Scotland’s MPs, a majority of Scotland’s political 
parties, churches, trade unions and other civic organisations.

It would be democratically unacceptable if in the face of this clear 
opposition the UK government were to impose Trident nuclear weapons on the 
Clyde against Scotland’s wishes.

On becoming prime minister Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> claimed that she wanted to 
govern in the interests of all nations and people in the UK – if that is true 
she must now make clear she respects Scotland’s decision.

The UK government must work with the Scottish government to ensure the 
earliest safe withdrawal of nuclear warheads from Scotland, and to discuss the 
retention and diversification of HMNB Clyde as a conventional naval base.
 
The Lib Dem MP Tim Farron says he voted against Trident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> renewal.

Look on the plus side, Corbynistas. After 2020, there won't be 138 Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs to vote in favour of Trident.

This is from ITV’s Robert Peston.
Robert Peston (@Peston) 
.@theresa_may <https://twitter.com/theresa_may> should enjoy her 472 to 117 
Trident victory, because she's not going to win many important votes by that 
margin

<https://twitter.com/Peston/status/755151902506094592>  
Assuming those figures are correct, 60% of all Labour MPs voted with the 
government for Trident renewal. Another 21% voted againstTrident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> renewal. And 19% abstained.
