In the frenetic dash to election day, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will swing through the 
usual key target states for any Democratic candidate: Ohio, Florida, North 
Carolina – and Arizona?

On Wednesday, Clinton will visit the Grand Canyon State for the first time 
since winning the Democratic nomination, a move that signals the campaign’s 
increasing confidence in her chances of turning a traditionally red state blue.

“This is very rare,” said Richard Herrera, an associate professor in the 
school of politics and global studies atArizona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> State University, of a visit from 
a Democratic presidential nominee. Democrats have carried the state only once 
since Harry Truman was in office: Bill Clinton in 1996.


If the Clinton campaign is this confident to make a play for Arizona, she is 
serious about her chances of winning here
Richard Herrera 
“If the Clinton campaign is this confident that it makes sense to make a play 
for Arizona, she is serious about her chances of winning here,” Herrera said.

The Democrat’s hope of a victory in Arizona largely rests with the state’s 
rapidly growing Hispanic population, a group Trump repeatedly has antagonized 
throughout his nativist campaign. As many asone in five 
<http://www.pewhispanic.org/fact-sheets/2016-state-election-fact-sheets/latinos-in-the-2016-election-arizona/>
 eligible voters in Arizona are Hispanic, but turnout rates have lagged behind 
those of other groups.

“It’s tight,” a senior Clinton campaign aide said on Tuesday of the race in 
Arizona. “We think it’s about even right now.”


A number of polls in the past few months have shown Clinton slightly ahead or 
within striking distance of Trump in the Grand Canyon State. The
RealClearPolitics polling average 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-6087.html#polls>
 has Trump ahead by about one percentage point.

At campaign rallies in Las Vegas and Phoenix on Wednesday, Clinton is expected 
to appeal directly to Latino voters in an effort to harness the backlash 
against Trump into a surge of support for her campaign.

The Democratic nominee will rail against Trump’s policy on immigration and 
offer her candidacy as a riposte to the divisive campaign he has run in a 
speech that highlights the disparaging comments he has made about immigrants, 
Mexicans and a federal judge of Mexican heritage, according to a campaign aide.


In Phoenix, she will be introduced by the parents of Damian Lopez Rodriguez 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHdnfWnHhig>, an Arizona native who was killed 
by a roadside bomb in Iraq, the aide said. The parents appeared in a 
Spanish-language ad for Clinton.

Clinton’s visit is a continuation of the campaign’s vigorous push in the 
state. Early last month, the campaign announced that it had ramped up its 
efforts in the state, investing another $2m to be spent on TV and digital 
advertising as well as voter registration efforts.

Ahead of her south-western swing, the campaign released on Wednesday a pair of 
Spanish <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ls6Ts9TvmY&feature=youtu.be>- and 
English <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVuH42xybVM&feature=youtu.be>-language 
TV and radio ads aimed at mobilizing the Latino community against Trump. The 
ads are titled “27 million strong”, a reference to the estimated number of 
eligible Latino voters.

On Thursday, Clinton’s running mate Tim Kaine will deliver a speech entirely 
in Spanish at a community center in Phoenix and will hold a rally at a high 
school in Tucson, a rare blue bastion in the state.

Last week, the campaign deployed top surrogates to rally troops in the state, 
including Senator Bernie Sanders, Chelsea Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama.


Before Obama took the stage in Tempe, the crowd heard from congressman Ruben 
Gallego, a Democrat. “We are officially a swing state!” he boomed into the 
microphone, drawing loud applause from the more than 6,000 people who turned 
out to see the first lady speak.

The decision to compete in Arizona is based on assessment of factors, 
including internal polling and early voter numbers. Campaign manager Robby Mook 
said that based on early analytics showed a higher than anticipated turnout 
there among minority groups, young people, women and independents.

Campaign aides have repeatedly said that they believe Arizona is a true 
battleground state – and not a potential cherry atop a pleasing electoral map. 
Still, stealing the red state would all but deny Trump a path to an electoral 
college victory.

“Arizona ain’t an indulgence,” campaign spokesman Brian Fallon 
<https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/792043601463283713> said on Twitter 
last week. “It’s a true battleground. Perhaps even more favorable-looking right 
now than some other places we’ve been on TV.”


Clinton’s visit to Arizona less than a week before voters go to the polls was 
made before the announcement that theFBI was reviewing emails related to her 
private server while she was secretary of state 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation>
, and perhaps reflects a confidence that has been somewhat dented since then.

Trump has visited Arizona seven times, including once to give a major speech 
on immigration in which he doubled down on his improbable but central campaign 
plank: build a border wall that is paid for by Mexico.

Arizona ain’t an indulgence. It’s a true battleground
Brian Fallon, Clinton campaign spokesman 
He also touts endorsements from two of the state’s most stalwart 
conservatives: former Arizona governor Jan Brewer, known for ushering through a 
hardline immigration law that inspired a rash of copycat legislation, and 
Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has beencharged with contempt of court 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/sheriff-joe-arpaio-charged-contempt-court-arizona>
 for disobeying a judge’s order in a racial profiling case.

Trump, who faces a difficult path, has embraced new polling that shows the 
race tightening as reason to spend his finally days campaigning in 
traditionally Democratic states like Michigan, New Mexico and Wisconsin.

Herrera expects Clinton’s visit to the desert will energize Democrats across 
the state and may help boost Latino voter registration.

A Clinton victory in the historically red state could prove to be the start of 
a long-anticipated political shift – or it could be one-off twist in a wild 
election year.

“That’s the big question,” Herrera said. “And the answer is, we just have to 
wait and see.”
