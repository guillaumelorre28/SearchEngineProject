1 We by Yevgeny Zamyatin (1921)

Zamyatin’s novel has often been called out as a significant catalyst for 
George Orwell’s better known 1984. In We’s future, as in 1984’s, privacy and 
individuality are non-existent. People are known by impersonal strings of 
numbers, live in a city made entirely out of glass – spying on someone is a lot 
easier if the walls are see-through – and are told that dreaming is a sign of 
mental illness. The concepts present in this dystopian world, cosicos believes, 
are important and very relevant to our society now: “The vision of all citizens 
living in glass-walled flats is very important given the current debates around 
the future of privacy online.”

2 Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

As recommended by: Cube3d

As almost always in dystopian story-lines, our protagonist, Guy Montag, is 
made to question the society he has – up until the reader joined him – had full 
faith in. Firemen are employed to burn the frightful banned objects that are 
books, in fear that they will make people think differently, question or, even 
worse, develop an imagination. The stories of firemen putting out fires in the 
past is merely a myth, and their new occupation is all in the name of “public 
happiness”. Bradbury’s classic novel has attracted many different adaptations 
in its time, most notably François Truffaut’s 1966 film and a BBC radio 
dramatisation, broadcast in 1982.

3 Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

As recommended by: Callanish 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/39189384>, JoannaDark 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/39194282>

The World State in Brave New World is where human beings are not conceived and 
born, but conditioned, hatched and bred, and where, before “hatching”, embyros’ 
futures are decided for them: each one is made to only think and look as 
impressively as their assigned caste – a dystopian class system. Families and 
emotional relationships are discouraged, while recreational and social sexual 
activities are taught as a part of society from a young age. It is conceivable 
ideas like this that JoannaDark recognises as making a great dystopian novel: 
“you can see the appeal and how an ideal, which many of us might recognise in 
places, became corrupted. Almost certainly the greatest dystopian work of all 
time.”

Alfonso Cuarón’s critically acclaimed picture looks at a world not too far in 
the future from our own. World-wide infertility has led to a collapse of 
society, as Theo (Clive Owen) narrates in the opening sequences. Cheery. It is 
based on PD James’s 1992 novel, and draws a scary picture of a future without a 
future. The film won a Best Cinematography Bafta.

5 V for Vendetta (1982-1989)

As recommended by: Insolito 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/39191983>

Much better regarded than its film counterpart, the graphic novels of V for 
Vendetta are far more intricate and gritty. The hero pulls a Guy Fawkes type 
persona- wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, aiming to destroy parliament and having 
explosives as his eventual weapon of choice. Although it is regarded a classic, 
readers point out that the supposingly big and tough facist rulers don’t last 
very long, or as Insolito so-correctly puts it, “the regime itself seems 
particularly brittle”.

The threat of nuclear war is the subject of Threads, a BBC television drama 
set in Sheffield. BenMacdui summarises it as a “terrifying portrayal of nuclear 
attack, totalitarian state, and subsequent total collapse of human values” 
that, after viewing, “haunts the mind for years afterwards”.

goingdown described Brazil as “1984 meets The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”.

“Does The Matrix not count?” asks Patrick Armstrong. Dave Thompson replies: 
“Only if you can explain the plot.” Challenge accepted: Neo (Keanu Reeves) is 
your average Joe computer programmer who has always thought something was not 
quite right; cue mysterious rebels in head-to-toe leather, that reveal yes, 
indeed, something is not quite right. Neo discovers that all humans are 
unconscious and their “reality”, is in fact happening inside their heads.

Judge Dredd has featured in 2000AD since 1977. In 2099, in Mega-City One 
robots and clones such as Judge Dredd keep the city in line. Dredd practically 
runs the town in this comic-book dystopia. “Gaze into the fist of Dredd!” says 
Pipotchi.

George Lucas’s THX 1138 plays on a fear that should be near the top of 
anyone’s list: a future where all emotions are suppressed by the use of 
compulsory drugs. And by all, this means sexual desire, too. Although failing 
to make an impact upon its release, over time the film has gained a significant 
cult following.
