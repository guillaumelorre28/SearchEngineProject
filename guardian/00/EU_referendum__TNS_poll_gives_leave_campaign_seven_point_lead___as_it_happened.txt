Afternoon summary

 * A TNS poll has given Leave a 7-point lead. (See 3.48pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/14/eu-referendum-live-polls-sun-brexit-remain-panic?page=with:block-57601800e4b05dd32a9fb29b#block-57601800e4b05dd32a9fb29b>
 * Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has called for restrictions on the EU’s 
freedom of movement rules, saying David Cameron should start pushing for this 
during the UK’s presidency of the EU next year. (See 4.38pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/14/eu-referendum-live-polls-sun-brexit-remain-panic?page=with:block-576020fbe4b0505cd1bcb9b0#block-576020fbe4b0505cd1bcb9b0>
The Labour MP John Mann, who is backing Brexit, said this was pointless. 
While some in the In campaign are desperately trying to hang on to the idea 
that Cameron’s renegotiation could reduce immigration, seniorLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> figures are openly admitting 
defeat on this issue - and calling for a change to the EU’s obsession with 
freedom of movement.

While it is welcome that they are finally admitting that uncontrolled 
migration is a problem, the truth is that they still have no solutions. If 
Cameron’s “renegotiation” told us one thing, it is that the EU will not move on 
this founding principle.

The only way to take back control of our borders and introduce an Australian 
style points based immigration system is to Vote Leave on 23 June.

 * Britain’s stock market has hit a new three-month low as Brexit worries 
sweep through the City. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/14/pound-uk-inflation-bank-of-england-brexit-liquidity-push-business-live?page=with:block-57602308e4b0505cd1bcb9c4#block-57602308e4b0505cd1bcb9c4>
AsGraeme Wearden reports, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed down 121 
points at 5923, its lowest level since late February, and its fourth day of 
heavy falls. That wipes around £30bn off its value. The Footsie has now shed 
378 points since the start of trading on Thursday, when Brexit fears began to 
mount.That means a staggering £98bn has been wiped off the value of Britain’s 
biggest companies in four trading days. 
 * Leave.EU has announced that it has cancelled plans for its ‘Last Night of 
the Brexit Proms’, also known as BpopLive. It said that Electoral Commission 
regulations had led to it taking this decision and it accused the commission of 
pursing “a spiteful vendetta”. 
 * Andrea Leadsom, a leading Brexit minister, has claimed that immigration 
could “overwhelm” Britain, arguing that her constituents complain about not 
hearing English spoken when they walk down the high street. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/immigration-could-overwhelm-britain-says-pro-brexit-minister-andrea-leadsom>
 * Sir Charlie Maylfied, chairman of John Lewis, has said withdrawal from the 
European Union would have an “adverse impact” on consumer confidence and 
spending in the UK for as much as five years and would probably lead to higher 
prices in the shops. 
That’s all for me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Leave has got an endorsement from the Sun, but Remain has got - the British 
Medical Journal. As the Press Association reports, it says that that the health 
case for Britain staying in the EU is “overwhelming” and that it is taking 
sides in the referendum after being unable to find any prominent health 
organisation that backs Brexit.

Mandleson says Brexit would make financial crash look like 'a walk in the park'

Lord Mandelson, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
former business secretary and former European trade commissioner, has said that 
Brexit would make the financial crash look like “a walk in the park”. At a 
business lunch organised by London First he said:

Far from being able to transfer savings from leaving the EU to more spending, 
for example, on the NHS, or schools, or universities, or farmers, we will 
eventually be facing cumulative, year-on-year post-Brexit austerity that would 
make the last financial crisis look like a walk in the park.

He said that people should not be “conned” into thinking leaving the EU would 
solve their concerns about immigration.

We will be taking the message across the country to Labour voters. There is so 
much riding on this, there is so much at stake. Do not be conned into thinking 
you can solve your concerns about immigration by leaving theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> because all that will do is wreck the 
economy and make everything you rely on weaker and everything else you want in 
life harder to get.

And he said the future of the City was hanging by a thread.

The future of this great global city, in my opinion, hangs by a thread. If 
Britain votes to leave Europe a lot ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> will have to leave London.

On the World at One Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of John Lewis, said that 
Brexit would be bad for his business. He said it was up to members of staff to 
decide for themselves how they voted, but he said management had been asked by 
staff about the impact leaving the EU would have. He told the programme:

What we have said to them is if the UK votes to leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> it would have an adverse impact on 
consumer confidence and activity. It is very, very hard to say for how long 
what would last, but it could easily be for a period of five years. And if, for 
example, you have things like a weaker currency, it will probably mean that 
prices rise. If there is less investment, which seems possible, then that could 
have an impact on jobs. And so there are concerns.

Watson says Cameron should push for reform of EU free movement rules during UK 
presidency in 2017

The BBC has now released the full transcript of Laura Kuenssberg’s interview 
withTom Watson in which he proposed curbs on EU freedom of movement rules.

It was not just a casual reference. Watson repeatedly said that Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>, and other parties fighting the 
2020 election, would have to propose some form of restriction on EU migrants 
because this is what voters wanted.

He also said that David Cameron should push for reform in this area when the 
UK holds the rotating presidency of the EU next year.

Watson said:

I think it’s very likely that a Labour government would want to reform the 
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and yes, if we get to a 
general election in 2020, of course we would have to listen to our voters. 
They’re giving us a pretty clear signal in this referendum, and I think we 
should be listening very clearly to what they’re telling us ...

I’m very proud of Jeremy’s very long-held view that Britain should rightly 
lead the world in its reputation for providing haven for people fleeing 
war-torn areas or fleeing persecution, but that pride risks being undermined if 
we don’t address the concerns of British workers who have been affected by a 
de-regulated labour market. And they’ve been telling us for some time now that 
we need to look at these issues. So I think it could be that we go into a UK 
general election with that reform proposals on offer ...

With freedom of movement, it’s one issue that’s coming up on the doorstep. A 
future government - whether it be Labour or Conservative - has to hear what 
voters are telling them and if you look across the continent ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, voters are telling political 
elites the same thing. So to me it’s inevitable that whoever wins the next 
general election will have to make it their negotiating position when it comes 
to future European reform and David Cameron has the opportunity to do that as 
prime minister now if he makes it the priority for Britain’s leadership of the 
presidency of the EU next year.

One problem with this proposal is that Cameron pushed very hard for reform of 
the freedom of movement rules during his EU renegotiation and found that 
Germany and other EU member states were refusing to budge. If the threat of the 
UK leaving was not enough to trigger reform, it is hard to what Cameron could 
achieve during the UK’s presidency.

Another problem for Watson is that Jeremy Corbyn said in a speech earlier this 
month that Britain “cannot and must not close the borders” to workers from the 
European Union.

"A toxic mix of misrepresentations, half-truths and folly' - Bild on UK's EU 
referendum debate

Philip Oltermann

Europe’s bestselling tabloid, Germany’s Bild, has today published a scathing 
comment piece on the level of debate ahead of the British referendum. “On the 
island they are writing history – but in mud”, the paper’s deputy editor 
Nikolaus Blome writes. “It’s a toxic mix of misrepresentations, half-truths and 
folly.” He goes on:

It is a disgrace, not worthy of politicians, the media and all proud Britons. 
Because it is they who once taughtEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> how to conduct intelligent 
political debate and what an enlightened, pragmatic democracy looks like.

While it is welcome that they are finally admitting that uncontrolled 
migration is a problem, the truth is that they still have no solutions. If 
Cameron’s ‘renegotiation’ told us one thing, it is that the EU will not move on 
this founding principle.

Around 16% of pupils in England did not get into their first choice of 
secondary school this year,according to figures out today. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36527159>

In a Vote Leave press statement the employment minister Priti Patel says:

The shortage of school places - with one in six children in England missing 
out on a place at their top choice of secondary school - is yet another example 
of how uncontrolled migration is putting unsustainable pressures on our public 
services. Education is one of the most important things that government 
delivers, and it’s deeply regrettable that so many families and young people 
have been let down in this way.

TNS have now published details of their new poll.  
<http://www.tnsglobal.co.uk/press-release/leave-campaign-ahead-latest-tns-poll>
It was supposed to be embargoed, but the headline findings were published early 
on Twitter.

Here are the key findings.

Remain: 40%

Leave: 47%

Undecided/would not vote: 13%

TNS polled 2,497 people online.

This is from Luke Taylor, head of social and political attitudes at TNS UK.

It should be noted that among the entire general public the picture is more 
balanced with 33% supporting Remain, 35% supporting Leave and 32% undecided or 
planning not to vote.

Taking into account likelihood to vote and whether or not people are 
registered to vote, benefits ‘Leave’ over ‘Remain’. In particular, our turnout 
model penalises younger people and those that did not vote in the previous 
general election, as historically these groups are less likely to vote. 
However, this model is based on general elections and as this is a referendum 
turnout among these groups may be higher than expected, boosting the Remain 
score.

Furthermore, while this poll presents a substantial lead for ‘Leave’ over 
‘Remain’ among those voters that have now made up their minds, the proportion 
selecting ‘Leave’ is still a minority of all voters. There are still many 
undecided voters out there and the history of referendums suggests that they 
will largely opt for the status quo.

This swing towards Leave since our last poll in late May might be due to a 
genuine change in opinion among voters but it could also be due to random error.

Watson says EU free movement of labour rules may need revising

Here is the full quote from Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, saying free 
movement of labour in the EU may have to be curbed in future. He told the BBC:

For the last decade I would say immigration has been the backdrop to every 
election we’ve had in Britain. Woe betide politicians who don’t listen to what 
voters tell them.

And that’s a familiar story across Europe as well, you know, if you look at 
Germany or Austria or other European countries. I think what we have to say, I 
did say the immigration issue was complicated, I think what we have to reassure 
people is that if they vote remain on Thursday June 23, that isn’t the end of 
the reform package for Europe. I think a futureEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> will have to look at things 
like the free movement of labour rules.

According to the New Statesman’s George Eaton, Jeremy Corbyn’s office is 
trying to downplay the significance of this.

It is clear from the quote that Watson was going further than Corbyn’s 
spokesman is implying. However, according to another source, Watson was not 
trying to float new policy ahead of the referendum. He made his remark at the 
end of a relatively long interview, and he was just making a general point 
about the future. He was also arguing that Britain could end up being affected 
by free movement rules even if it left the EU (as Norway is) and that therefore 
it needs to remain in to have a say over how they develop, the source says.

The Labour MP John Mann, who is backing Brexit, said this was pointless. 
While some in the In campaign are desperately trying to hang on to the idea 
that Cameron’s renegotiation could reduce immigration, seniorLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> figures are openly admitting 
defeat on this issue - and calling for a change to the EU’s obsession with 
freedom of movement.

While it is welcome that they are finally admitting that uncontrolled 
migration is a problem, the truth is that they still have no solutions. If 
Cameron’s “renegotiation” told us one thing, it is that the EU will not move on 
this founding principle.

The only way to take back control of our borders and introduce an Australian 
style points based immigration system is to Vote Leave on 23 June.

AsGraeme Wearden reports, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed down 121 
points at 5923, its lowest level since late February, and its fourth day of 
heavy falls. That wipes around £30bn off its value. The Footsie has now shed 
378 points since the start of trading on Thursday, when Brexit fears began to 
mount.That means a staggering £98bn has been wiped off the value of Britain’s 
biggest companies in four trading days. 
 * Leave.EU has announced that it has cancelled plans for its ‘Last Night of 
the Brexit Proms’, also known as BpopLive. It said that Electoral Commission 
regulations had led to it taking this decision and it accused the commission of 
pursing “a spiteful vendetta”. 
 * Andrea Leadsom, a leading Brexit minister, has claimed that immigration 
could “overwhelm” Britain, arguing that her constituents complain about not 
hearing English spoken when they walk down the high street.

European Union would have an “adverse impact” on consumer confidence and

prices in the shops. 
That’s all for me for today.

Leave has got an endorsement from the Sun, but Remain has got - the British 
Medical Journal. As the Press Association reports, it says that that the health 
case for Britain staying in the EU is “overwhelming” and that it is taking 
sides in the referendum after being unable to find any prominent health 
organisation that backs Brexit.

Lord Mandelson, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
former business secretary and former European trade commissioner, has said that 
Brexit would make the financial crash look like “a walk in the park”. At a 
business lunch organised by London First he said:

Far from being able to transfer savings from leaving the EU to more spending, 
for example, on the NHS, or schools, or universities, or farmers, we will 
eventually be facing cumulative, year-on-year post-Brexit austerity that would 
make the last financial crisis look like a walk in the park.

He said that people should not be “conned” into thinking leaving the EU would 
solve their concerns about immigration.

We will be taking the message across the country to Labour voters. There is so 
much riding on this, there is so much at stake. Do not be conned into thinking 
you can solve your concerns about immigration by leaving theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> because all that will do is wreck the 
economy and make everything you rely on weaker and everything else you want in 
life harder to get.

And he said the future of the City was hanging by a thread.

The future of this great global city, in my opinion, hangs by a thread. If 
Britain votes to leave Europe a lot ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> will have to leave London.

On the World at One Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of John Lewis, said that 
Brexit would be bad for his business. He said it was up to members of staff to 
decide for themselves how they voted, but he said management had been asked by 
staff about the impact leaving the EU would have. He told the programme:

What we have said to them is if the UK votes to leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> it would have an adverse impact on 
consumer confidence and activity. It is very, very hard to say for how long 
what would last, but it could easily be for a period of five years. And if, for 
example, you have things like a weaker currency, it will probably mean that 
prices rise. If there is less investment, which seems possible, then that could 
have an impact on jobs. And so there are concerns.
 
The BBC has now released the full transcript of Laura Kuenssberg’s interview 
withTom Watson in which he proposed curbs on EU freedom of movement rules.

It was not just a casual reference. Watson repeatedly said that Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>, and other parties fighting the 
2020 election, would have to propose some form of restriction on EU migrants 
because this is what voters wanted.

He also said that David Cameron should push for reform in this area when the 
UK holds the rotating presidency of the EU next year.

Watson said:

I think it’s very likely that a Labour government would want to reform the 
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and yes, if we get to a 
general election in 2020, of course we would have to listen to our voters. 
They’re giving us a pretty clear signal in this referendum, and I think we 
should be listening very clearly to what they’re telling us ...

I’m very proud of Jeremy’s very long-held view that Britain should rightly 
lead the world in its reputation for providing haven for people fleeing 
war-torn areas or fleeing persecution, but that pride risks being undermined if 
we don’t address the concerns of British workers who have been affected by a 
de-regulated labour market. And they’ve been telling us for some time now that 
we need to look at these issues. So I think it could be that we go into a UK 
general election with that reform proposals on offer ...

With freedom of movement, it’s one issue that’s coming up on the doorstep. A 
future government - whether it be Labour or Conservative - has to hear what 
voters are telling them and if you look across the continent ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, voters are telling political 
elites the same thing. So to me it’s inevitable that whoever wins the next 
general election will have to make it their negotiating position when it comes 
to future European reform and David Cameron has the opportunity to do that as 
prime minister now if he makes it the priority for Britain’s leadership of the 
presidency of the EU next year.

One problem with this proposal is that Cameron pushed very hard for reform of 
the freedom of movement rules during his EU renegotiation and found that 
Germany and other EU member states were refusing to budge. If the threat of the 
UK leaving was not enough to trigger reform, it is hard to what Cameron could 
achieve during the UK’s presidency.

Another problem for Watson is that Jeremy Corbyn said in a speech earlier this 
month that Britain “cannot and must not close the borders” to workers from the 
European Union.

Europe’s bestselling tabloid, Germany’s Bild, has today published a scathing 
comment piece on the level of debate ahead of the British referendum. “On the 
island they are writing history – but in mud”, the paper’s deputy editor 
Nikolaus Blome writes. “It’s a toxic mix of misrepresentations, half-truths and 
folly.” He goes on:

It is a disgrace, not worthy of politicians, the media and all proud Britons. 
Because it is they who once taughtEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> how to conduct intelligent 
political debate and what an enlightened, pragmatic democracy looks like.

According to the BBC, <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-36454645> 
this is what the pro-Brexit Labour MP John Mann is saying about Tom Watson’s

Around 16% of pupils in England did not get into their first choice of 
secondary school this year,according to figures out today. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36527159>

In a Vote Leave press statement the employment minister Priti Patel says:

The shortage of school places - with one in six children in England missing 
out on a place at their top choice of secondary school - is yet another example 
of how uncontrolled migration is putting unsustainable pressures on our public 
services. Education is one of the most important things that government 
delivers, and it’s deeply regrettable that so many families and young people 
have been let down in this way.
 
TNS have now published details of their new poll.  
<http://www.tnsglobal.co.uk/press-release/leave-campaign-ahead-latest-tns-poll>
It was supposed to be embargoed, but the headline findings were published early 
on Twitter.

Here are the key findings.

Remain: 40%

Leave: 47%

Undecided/would not vote: 13%

TNS polled 2,497 people online.

This is from Luke Taylor, head of social and political attitudes at TNS UK.

It should be noted that among the entire general public the picture is more 
balanced with 33% supporting Remain, 35% supporting Leave and 32% undecided or 
planning not to vote.

Taking into account likelihood to vote and whether or not people are 
registered to vote, benefits ‘Leave’ over ‘Remain’. In particular, our turnout 
model penalises younger people and those that did not vote in the previous 
general election, as historically these groups are less likely to vote. 
However, this model is based on general elections and as this is a referendum 
turnout among these groups may be higher than expected, boosting the Remain 
score.

Furthermore, while this poll presents a substantial lead for ‘Leave’ over 
‘Remain’ among those voters that have now made up their minds, the proportion 
selecting ‘Leave’ is still a minority of all voters. There are still many 
undecided voters out there and the history of referendums suggests that they 
will largely opt for the status quo.

This swing towards Leave since our last poll in late May might be due to a 
genuine change in opinion among voters but it could also be due to random error.

Here is the full quote from Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, saying free 
movement of labour in the EU may have to be curbed in future. He told the BBC:

For the last decade I would say immigration has been the backdrop to every 
election we’ve had in Britain. Woe betide politicians who don’t listen to what 
voters tell them.

And that’s a familiar story across Europe as well, you know, if you look at 
Germany or Austria or other European countries. I think what we have to say, I 
did say the immigration issue was complicated, I think what we have to reassure 
people is that if they vote remain on Thursday June 23, that isn’t the end of 
the reform package for Europe. I think a futureEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> will have to look at things 
like the free movement of labour rules.

According to the New Statesman’s George Eaton, Jeremy Corbyn’s office is 
trying to downplay the significance of this.
