A crimson pout. It should be so simple – it's been a trend for centuries. Our 
primitive ancestors weresmearing scarlet-hued berries 
<http://english.pravda.ru/health/20-10-2005/9099-lipstick-0/> on their mouths 
to capture the perfect red pout before they even discovered the loincloth. 
Which makes sense, evolutionally speaking. Recent research found the higher the 
contrast between the different parts of our facial features – ie the colour of 
our lips compared to our foreheads – the healthier–looking and more attractive 
we appear. But the simple red lip, for a good few of us, is fraught with 
conundrums. Ones that need to be settled, for good, before we digress on to 
skin tones.

First: "Is there an age limit on red lipstick?" To which the answer is always 
a resolute, unquestionable no. We're talking red lipstick here, it's timeless; 
a true beauty classic and all women deserve to wear it with abandon. The next 
quandary: "My partner/friend/husband/colleague/daughter says I don't suit it." 
I can't really help you if you let other people tell you what to do, sorry.

My final point is spurred by comments from rapper A$AP Rocky, who was quoted 
as saying that only fair-skinned women suit red lipstick. Untrue, deplorable 
and frankly, none of his concern. I know women, fair-skinned and dark, who feel 
positively reborn just by slicking on their favourite red. A red lip on any 
skin tone has the power to mesmerise and stop you dead in your tracks. That's 
why it has passed the test of time, and its transformative powers are second to 
none.
 Left to right: Dolce & Gabbana, Mac and Tom Ford 
Tried, tested and adored: my all-time favourite reds – magnificent for any 
skin tone

Classic Cream Lipstick in Devil, £23, Dolce & Gabbana 
<http://www.dolcegabbanamakeup.com/> An elegant all-rounder red that's a 
brilliant choice for daytime. It's not too boisterous and feels utterly 
luxurious to wear.

Lipstick in Riri Woo, £14, Mac  <http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/index.tmpl>
Based on its predecessor Ruby Woo (a beautiful blue-toned, almost neon red) 
this shade is an ultra-matte, blood red that's undeniably mesmerising.

Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick in Beso, £15, Stila  
<http://stila.co.uk/?gclid=CLmEkMzB_LcCFSGWtAodnF4Abg>My ultimate, all-time 
favourite red. It applies like a gloss, but dries to a long-wearing matte 
finish that stays put through all-nighters. I'm not exaggerating when I say 
this lipstick will change your life.

Lip Colour in Cherry Lush, £36, Tom Ford  <http://www.tomford.com/>There's a 
one-of-a-kind feeling that comes from wearing a Tom Ford lipstick. It makes you 
feel different, somehow. Like the super version of yourself, and this suit-all 
hue can be layered up for extra intensity.

Sinner 90 Percent Pigment in Scarlet Red Sinner, £18, Lipstick Queen 
<http://www.lipstickqueen.com/> A glossy, jovial little red that contrasts 
beautifully against darker skins. It's a little lighter than the other reds on 
this list.

Creamy Matte Lip Colour in Heart, £18, Bobbi Brown  
<http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/>It's matte, deep and moisturising, so it's a 
really safe work bet, but still bestows a 40s-chic look upon the wearer – that 
lasts.
