For 12 hours yesterday, Ava DuVernay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ava-duvernay> – the Golden Globe-nominated 
director of Selma – wielded both her increasing influence and the connective 
power of social media to host a Twitter conversation in which more than 40 
black directors dispensed advice to fans and fledgling film-makers.

The online event, entitled the ‘Rebel-a-Thon’, was also intended to raise 
awareness of a membership drive for DuVernay’sAFFRM <http://www.affrm.com/>, an 
organisation dedicated to releasing independent work by black film-makers 
(DuVernay released her first two films, I Will Follow (2010) and Middle of 
Nowhere (2012), through the company).

Each participating film-maker had a short slot in which to respond to 
questions asked via Twitter, after users were encouraged to submit thoughts and 
questions using the hashtag#ARRAY <https://twitter.com/hashtag/ARRAY?src=hash>. 

Amid a wide range of talent, there were galvanising contributions from big 
names such as Tyler Perry, who lauded DuVernay for her ability to mobilise.

There was even a light-hearted cameo from Oprah Winfrey, who recently starred 
as activist Annie Lee Cooper in Selma.

Up-and-comers such as Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) and Justin Simien (Dear 
White People) offered thoughtful contributions, while the more experimentally 
inclined film-maker Terence Nance spoke about the process of making his debut, 
An Oversimplification of Her Beauty, and also shed light on issues like the 
troubling paucity of black female cinematographers.

In an email, Nance expanded on why DuVernay’s drive is so crucial: 

“Black film-makers acting collectively is the only way for us to break through 
the white supremacy that permeates the film industry and [will allow us to] get 
our films made and distributed consistently,” he wrote.

“Our collective talent and numbers as creatives and producers is far outpacing 
our collective output (less than 10 movies a year from ‘art first’ black 
film-makers). We can’t increase our output without pooling our resources and 
strategizing and acting collectively.”


He also took time to pay tribute to DuVernay’s vision, saying “Ava is 
spearheading this effort and her skill, talent, bravery and generosity are 
unprecedented. What she is doing is very necessary and the rest of us should 
feel a responsibility to build institutions with each other and act in our 
collective interest.”

Experienced stalwarts played a part, too, illustrating the breadth of 
DuVernay’s reach, and calling attention to a rich depth of black film-making 
history. John Singleton, the first black director to be nominated for an Oscar 
(for Boyz N The Hood in 1992), chipped in to explain – among other things – 
where he came up with the name Furious Styles, the character memorably played 
by Laurence Fishburne.

High named Furious...and the last name is from my USC buddy Yon!

Also offering advice were veterans Haile Gerima and Julie Dash, who cut their 
teeth during the 1970s “LA Rebellion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/the-la-rebellion-when-black-film-makers-took-on-the-world-and-won>
”, one of the most important and influential movements in black cinema history. 
Dash urged young film-makers to break away from well-trodden narrative ground.

Dash was only one of a host of female film-makers in a list notable for its 
refreshing gender parity. Others included Gina Prince-Bythewood (Beyond The 
Lights) and Kasi Lemmons (Black Nativity). Meanwhile, Roger Ross Williams, 
Rodney Evans and Patrik-Ian Polk addressed the importance of developing more 
LGBT-focused narratives in black cinema.

While largely US-focused, the Rebel-a-Thon had an intermittently international 
flavour, with appearances from Jamaican Storm Saulter and Londoner Amma Asante, 
whose latest film –A United Kingdom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/27/david-oyelowo-rosamund-pike-african-king-marriage-british-woman-seretse-khama-ruth-williams>
, starring David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike - has just been announced.


Asante said: “It’s empowering but also inspiring. It’s a good feeling to know 
that we are not insignificant in numbers (though there are still not enough of 
us), and that we can inspire others through our presence.” I asked her if this 
type of event, with its relentlessly upbeat, welcoming tone, is 
quintessentially American in nature.

“I do feel this kind of support is beautifully American,” she said. “Unlike in 
England, they have a substantial black press that contributes to bringing them 
to the attention of other, mainstream media, so this kind of event can create 
impact on many levels.”

The Rebel-a-Thon constituted a show of solidarity and an affirmation of sheer 
presence in the face of an industry which has long struggled with diversity – 
this year’soverwhelmingly white and male Oscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/19/the-great-awards-whitewash-diversity-loses-out-on-the-red-carpets>
 is only the most recent, surface-level example. Yet while never wavering from 
the central thrust of the mission – to spotlight and develop black talent – 
DuVernay took a moment to laud contributions and well-wishes from non-black 
supporters.

Don't have to be black to support black film. Or brown for brown, etc. Allies 
come in all stripes. Thx@jes_chastain <https://twitter.com/jes_chastain>.

Ultimately, though, yesterday’s event was an unambiguous call to action 
boasting a clear central philosophy: black film-makers matter.
