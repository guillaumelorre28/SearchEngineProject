For years newspapers publishers, media academics and the National Union of 
Journalists <https://www.theguardian.com/media/nationalunionofjournalists> have 
been arguing that the government should step in to support the local news 
industry.

At last the chancellor, George Osborne, appears ready to do something positive 
for ailing local newspapers. He said in his budget speech that there should be 
“consultation” on tax support for local newspapers in terms of relief on 
business rates.

I’m not certain, given the uncertainty of the election outcome, whether this 
is anything more than a pious promise. But it could be a step in the right 
direction as far as the current owners are concerned (note the warm response 
from Johnston Press’s chief executive, Ashley Highfield).

Newspaper publishers have argued against public subsidies, but would surely 
view tax breaks as a more acceptable below-the-line support.

It is sobering to recall that as long ago as 2010, the Media Trust 
commissioned the Goldsmiths Leverhulme media research centre to consider 
whether tax breaks could be introduced.

The result was a report calling for just that, Meeting the news needs of local 
communities <http://www.mediatrust.org/uploads/128255497549240/original.pdf>. 
Its authors - Natalie Fenton, Monika Metykova, Justin Schlosberg, and Des 
Freedman - recommended a review of the tax regime for media organisations as 
well as urging the use of “foundation grants and local government subsidies for 
genuinely local news-hub start-ups”.

However, that they were not necessarily seeing mainstream proprietors as the 
beneficiaries. Their calls was for “new ownership models rooted in the local 
community”.

At the same time, they made out a case for newsprint papers as the best 
provider of local news. At one point they argued: “Nothing beats the 
old-fashioned local paper for ease, for accessibility, for relevance, and for 
social impact”.

I’m not sure I go along with that because all news will eventually be 
delivered online. ButI have previously made calls for public subsidies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jul/19/advertising-local-newspapers>
 (rather than tax breaks) to ensure the gathering and transmission of local 
news, as has the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger.

I think’s it’s fair to say we agreed that it would be fine for the government 
to provide funding to support public service journalism as long as a structure 
was erected to prevent it having any control over editorial content.

This is very different from giving relief on business rates, of course. What 
counts is the funding and preservation of journalism rather than a form of 
ownership that views profit as of overriding importance.
