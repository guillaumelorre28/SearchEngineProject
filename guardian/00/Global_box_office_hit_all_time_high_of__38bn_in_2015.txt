 Star Wars: The Force Awakens - video review 
Jurassic World <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world> remains the 
year’s highest-grossing film, with $1.67bn in receipts, though The Force 
Awakens is likely to end up the biggest film released in 2015. Abrams’ movie is 
currently in third place, with a haul of $1.510bn, just behind Fast & Furious 
7’s $1.515bn.

China’s $6.78bn total was a staggering 48.7% up on 2014’s figure 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/china-box-office-grows-astonishing-851629>
, as the world’s second-largest box office continued to grow at an impressive 
rate. The globe’s most populous nation is now expected to overtake North 
America as cinema’s highest-grossing territory as early as 2017, though doubts 
persist as to the accuracy of accounting.

In September, the homegrown fantasy Monster Hunt was hailed as the 
highest-grossing film of all time in China, with 2.428bn yuan ($379m) in 
receipts. But last monththe film was accused of manipulating its box-office 
figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/07/china-box-office-record-breaker-monster-hunt-manipulated-figures>
 in order to break the record. The respected Hollywood trade siteBox Office Mojo
 <http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/china/> has removed Monster Hunt’s listing 
from its pages, and stated that it will no longer update Chinese box-office 
results due to the absence of “consistent and accurate” data.

Cinema does appear to be enjoying something of a renaissance worldwide, even 
if fewer films are providing the bulk of the profits. Variety reports that 
2015’s top 10 movies at the North American box officeaccounted for close to 35% 
of overall ticket sales 
<http://variety.com/2015/film/box-office/box-office-has-record-year-as-few-share-the-wealth-1201668037/>
, against a corresponding figure of 25% in 2014.

 Fast and Furious 7 - video review 
The record $38bn figure is based on estimates from box-office analyst Rentrak. 
“The importance of the [non-North American] marketplace to the overall success 
of the motion picture studios, the exhibition business and the movies 
themselves cannot be overstated, with key territories across the globe plus 
North America providing the collective horsepower to push us near the $40bn 
mark for the first time ever,” said the firm’s senior media analyst, Paul 
Dergarabedian.
