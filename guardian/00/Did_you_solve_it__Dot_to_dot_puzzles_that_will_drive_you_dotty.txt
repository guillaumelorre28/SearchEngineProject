Earlier today I set you the following dot-to-dot puzzles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/23/can-you-solve-it-dot-to-dot-puzzles-that-will-drive-you-dotty>
. You had to draw lines between the dots, with the constraint that the number 
by the dot determines the number of lines joining that dot.

 Linking park 
I also said that any two dots can be linked by at most one line, and that for 
the 3-dot and 4-dot hexagons no lines could cross. Here are a set of solutions, 
but there are others.

 A hexagon in braces skipping, a hexagon in braces and a sash showing off and a 
star. 
The last challenge was to fill in this one with only two ‘repeat’ lines, which 
repeat a link between two dots.
 Who eight the dots? 
Here’s a solution. Again, there are variations.
