As long as there is pop music, there will be massive egos, and where there are 
massive egos, there are deeply unnecessary fights over who is better at 
rhyming, dressing or eating a fondue plate somewhere. Here are some of the 
year’s best.

On November 12, 2014, 36 year-old DJ Diplo finally broke his legendary silence 
on the topic of Taylor Swift’s butt, tweeting “someone should make a 
kickstarter to get taylor swift a booty. 
<https://twitter.com/diplo/status/532630767479058432>” When Swift’s pal Lorde 
responded with “should we do something about your tiny penis while we’re at it 
him,” Diplo pointed out that Lorde is a “high school student 
<https://twitter.com/diplo/status/533774214718046208>,” which, it must be said, 
is more of a fact than a burn. The adult man who is pushing 40 continued the 
online feud with two much younger women by taking time out of his busy schedule 
as a performer and producer toPhotoshop a fake tweet 
<https://twitter.com/diplo/status/533774297333239808> from Taylor and respond 
to it. He then tweeted “Disappointed the swift boat veterans didn’t get my tiny 
dick a fundly going (enlarge me bae) 
<https://twitter.com/diplo/status/533774687390932992>.” Silent throughout all 
of this was Diplo’s girlfriend and rumoured Swift mortal enemy, Katy Perry. 
Perry is thought to be the subject of Swift song Bad Blood, and recently stole 
three dancers fromSwift’s camp mid-tour

 War On Drugs, available in Starbucks according to Mark Kozelek pr Photograph: 
PR Image 
Canada’s capital is a classic location for beefing, as critical darlings The 
War On Drugs and Sun Kil Moon showed us this year. Their dispute took place 
during the oddly stacked Ottawa Folk Festival, where the bands were scheduled 
to play simultaneously on adjacent stages. Apparently, the sound from The War 
On Drugs’ stage bled into Sun Kil Moon’s performance, leading the band’s Mark 
Kozelek to record classic diss track, “War On Drugs: Suck My Cock/Sun Kil Moon: 
Go Fuck Yourself.” After The War On Drugs failed to respond in time to a public 
challenge by Kozelek to perform that song at an upcoming War On Drugs gig, 
Kozelek released asecond diss track, “Adam Granofsky Blues” (the song is a 
spoken word recording of Kozelek reading a recent post about the feud by War On 
Drugs frontman Adam Granduciel). He also told Granduciel, “Maybe when I get 
home from tour I’ll go to Starbucks and buy your record.” Ouch.

 P Diddy: likes his beef very salty Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images 
Drake got punched in the face by the artist formerly known as Puffy outside a 
Miami night club this year. According to “insiders” “connected” to “the 
situation,” the beef surrounded a song given to both artists by producer 
Boi-1da. Allegedly, Diddy hadn’t done anything with the track in months, soDrake
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake> went ahead and recorded it on his 
own, rubbing salt in the wound by ignoring Puff Daddy at the club. Forty-five 
year-old Sean Combs took matters into his own hands, clocking the Toronto 
Raptors’ most dedicated fan right in his sensitive face while saying “You’ll 
never disrespect me again.”

Drake also got in fresh trouble this year with Jay Z, with whom he has a 
longstanding respectful rivalry. After Rolling Stone interview where Aubrey 
mocked Jay’s reliance onart references in his lyrics 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/drake-high-times-at-the-yolo-estate-20140213?page=4>
, the two have been trading disses back and forth, with Hov calling Drizzy 
“soft as a lacrosse team,” and Champagne Papiinsinuating that Jay loves fondue 
<http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6062689/drake-makes-another-jab-at-jay-z-at-raptorsnets-game>
. It’s getting very tense. Who knows who will accuse the other of loving 
yachting next?

 Ariana Grande: Bette wouldn’t melt Photograph: Nancy Rivera/ACE Pictures/REX 
Bette Midler <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bette-midler> was quoted in 
the Telegraph saying a number of unkind things about tiny sexy pop sensation 
Ariana Grande, including “You don’t have to make a whore out of yourself to get 
ahead.” The sentient ponytail and “Problem” singer responded like a classy 
princess, tweeting: “Bette was always a feminist who stood for women being able 
to do whatever the F they wanted without judgement! not sure where that Bette 
went but i want that sexy mermaid back!!! always a fan no matter what my love.” 
That sexy mermaid did indeed come back, with Midler narrowly avoiding a teen 
Twitter storm by saying: ”About my screed on @arianagrande, all I can say is, 
“Spoken like a reformed old whore!” and “’Yes, it’s my birthday! And my 
birthday wish is that @ArianaGrande forgives me soon and let’s me direct her 
next video…”.

In a kind of reverse-Christmas, iTunes dumped U2’s new album Songs Of Innocence
on every single one of its customers in 119 countries worldwide. Surprised 
iTunes users responded with enthusiasm, saying things like “Arrogant and 
presumptuous!! <https://twitter.com/LipglossJill/status/509648049040535552>” “
the equivalent to your cat leaving a mouse carcass in your kitchen as a gift 
<https://twitter.com/Jontofski/status/509650846435774464>” and “no I don’t want 
the new U2 album take it out of my iTunes 
<https://twitter.com/AndyyBurgess/status/509426283869384704>.” In response to 
widespread whining across social media and mainstream media, many sites offered 
explainers to help us all get rid of it. Bono himself eventually apologized and 
admitted “a drop of megalomania” was responsiblefor the terrible plan

It might be more convenient to list who Australian-born Iggy Azalea WASN’T 
beefing with this year. FromInstagram brawls with Snoop 
<http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/iggy-azalea-and-snoop-doggs-beef-wasnt-as-pointless-as-it-seemed/381554/>

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/05/azealia-bankss-beef-with-wigger-iggy-azalea-over-us-race-issues-misses-point>
, to an apparentlynever-ending battle 
<http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/know-your-beef-nicki-minaj-vs-iggy-azalea/>
 with Nicki Minaj Iggy wasn’t here to make friends. She also beefed with 
Eminem, although to be fair to Iggy that was less of a beef and more “it’s very 
uncool to threaten to rape me in your lyrics, you sad old man 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2843109/Iggy-Azalea-responds-rapper-s-threats-rape-vile-song-lyrics.html>
.” Just look out, girl. If Azealia Banks says she wants to “throw a jar of [her 
own] piss” at you, she probably will. Things heated up between Iggy and Azealia 
once again last week, with Azealia releasing a long series of tweets and going 
on Hot 97 to accuse Iggy of appropriating black culture and denying her white 
privilege.She’s got a point 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11308082/Azealia-Banks-Vs-Iggy-Azalea-White-people-shouldnt-steal-hip-hop.html>
