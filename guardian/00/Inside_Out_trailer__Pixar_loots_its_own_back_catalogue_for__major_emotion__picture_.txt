In what looks like a kiddified version of that Everything You Always Wanted to 
Know About Sex segment inside a lothario’s head,Pixar’s new film, Inside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/12/inside-out-pixar-risk-animation>
, features personifications of individual emotions – joy, sadness, anger, 
disgust and fear – that are competing to control a small girl called Riley. 
Could this be the most abstract effort yet from this pioneering animation 
outfit?

Well, the first trailer has now been released, and there’s now a little flesh 
on the bones. The back end of the 1’40” teaser features the requisite pop-eyed 
kid, uncertain over moving house, dolefully registering her feelings to a 
soundtrack of Aerosmith’s Sweet Emotion (and capped with a card wittily 
claiming this is a “major emotion picture” – I think we can see where this is 
going).

But it’s the first part of the teaser that is bit of a departure: Pixar have 
ransacked their own back catalogue for clips to illustrate the emotions in 
question. Toy Story, Up,Finding Nemo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/finding-nemo>, Monsters Inc, Wall-E ... even 
A Bug’s Life and Brave get a look-in in the blizzard of funnies and 
heartstring-tuggers that flood past.

So have you now got Inside Out <https://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out> 
on the brain? Or would you rather forget the whole thing? Let us know in the
