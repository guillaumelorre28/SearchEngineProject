Summer 1983. Nick Guest, a young outsider, moves into the Notting Hill 
household of the Fedden family – his fellow Oxford graduate Toby, Toby's 
bi-polar sister Catherine, their wealthy mother Rachel and her husband, 
ambitious Tory MP Gerald. In the heady boom years of the early 80s, Nick is 
seduced by the Feddens' world of money and privilege, and equally drawn to the 
freedoms and possibilities of metropolitan gay life. Through Nick's 
relationship with the super-rich Wani Ouradi, and the rising and falling 
fortunes of the Fedden family, the novel examines the wider political context 
of a greedy, ruthless decade – there is even a cameo for Margaret Thatcher 
herself – and the dark spectre of the AIDS epidemic looms over the latter 
stages of the novel.
