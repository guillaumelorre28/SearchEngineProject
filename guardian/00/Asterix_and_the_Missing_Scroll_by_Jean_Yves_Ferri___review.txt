This story is all about Asterix, his friend Obelix, and a missing scroll. 
Caesar’s attendant wrote a manuscript on his conquests with the Gauls except 
one small town named Armorica where our heroes Asterix and Obelix live.

His advisor, called Blockbustus, advises him to remove that particular chapter 
so that his reputation remains intact and Caesar is known as the invincible one.

However, one of his scribes called Bigdatha steals the scroll to show his 
solidarity with the Gaulish people of Armorica. He couldn’t stand a key chapter 
in their history getting censored. Bigdatha passes on the scroll to a 
newsmonger so that it becomes big news.

The newsmonger comes to know that the Romans are after him and seeks shelter 
in Armorica. He also lets the citizens of Armorica know of Caesar’s intention 
at hiding the truth.

Asterix, Obelix and their town druid go on a mission to find the druid’s 
teacher. He alone can memorise the scroll and pass on the knowledge to future 
generations that Armorica was never defeated by the Gauls.

Eventually they do find him and he inks the story to his memory to pass on as 
a word of mouth. The Gauls then again go on a battle with the Romans and win 
however the Romans do get their hands on the scroll.

But the damage is done word of mouth travels and everyone just knows the truth 
that Caesar never won over Armorica.

I like this story because it is full of adventure and it is funny. However at 
times it is hard to understand because a reader needs some historical context 
given by Asterix and Obelix comics and this is my first Asterix comic.


I would recommend this story to adventure fans everywhere. This story is for 
kids from 8-12 years old.
