That’s all we’ve got time for i’m afraid, but here’s a parting note from Akon: 

Thank you very much for joining the conversation. With your help the 
commitments can turn into actions - we’re doing our part by launching the 
Solektra Solar Academy on 15 December in Bamako, Mali.

We have a great time at COP 21, we’re meeting potential partners, we’ve seen 
interesting commitments being made

The case for aid

By email Tom Moore asks: 

Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon>, love the work you’re doing. I 
believe there is still a place in this sector for aid agencies. Many use the 
term loosely and still promote business and enterprise. SolarAid for example 
use grants to help them catalyse markets and reach the very last mile while 
still selling light and building sustainable markets. There is definitely room 
for partnerships.

Can I ask what you’re doing to ensure the very poorest aren’t overlooked? Many 
still can’t afford the cost of a home system and need help getting on the 
energy ladder.

Akon replies: I don’t believe in aid in Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>, I don’t believe it works.

Aid has been the central point for Africa for years and there has been no 
progress. If you want to help people you have to empower them, employ them and 
educate them so that they can provide for their own

Constant giving only weakens a person’s morale but if you put people in the 
position to the be one giving it strengthens them. This project is designed to 
keep the very poorest out of poverty.

Democratic Republic of Congo

My question would be what is he doing to highlight the ongoing situation in 
DRC the worst humanitarian disaster since WW2 according to the UN. It makes 
Syria look like a playground scuffle. Officially, 8 million dead since 1997 and 
likely much more, millions displaced. The wealth of the "heart of Africa" going 
to the west and technology in things like lamp posts, computers, mobile phones 
and other devices, what has he done to highlight this? What has he done to get 
a hydro plant at the mouth of the Congo river where water flow is enough to 
provide electricity to the entire African continent according to scientists? 
What is he doing to harness the wealth and stop the exploitation of the DRC 
which is the richest country in the world based on natural resources.

Am just an African citizen doing my part in the development of Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> in general. Unfortunately I don’t 
have the power to make decision like that. But you on the other hand should 
spread the information and raise awareness on the issue in Congo. And I will 
support anyway I can to raise the awareness.

The trickle down effect 
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13071394> Ashden_Awards

We'd love to ask Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> how he thinks 
that innovation can be nurtured and fostered at a community level so that 
communities are able to take control of their own energy needs, even in the 
remotest of places.

The winner of this year's Ashden Award for Business Innovation, SteamaCo, is 
pioneering remote-controlled renewable energy microgrids for rural areas inKenya
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya> which work like mini power stations 
for each village, supplying enough energy to run small businesses, as well as 
power TVs, radios and bright lights in the home:

http://www.ashden.org/winners/Steamaco15 
<http://www.ashden.org/winners/Steamaco15>

How can we make sure that the benefits of clean energy are passed on to the 
hardest to reach?

The communities need to start by themselves by supporting each others’ 
businesses. That unity will attract other businesses.

We’re working to develop the cheapest microgrid system in the world for the 
hardest to reach

What is Akon Lighting Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> doing 
to work with other aid agencies working in the energy access/lighting space?

I know that the UK's Department for International Development has a similar 
campaign, calledEnergy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> Africa, 
is there any scope for collaboration?

… Again we’re a for profit company, promoting public-private partnerships - so 
we do not work with aid agencies.

Women in Senegal are working hard to provide solar lighting products to their 
off-grid communities. Limited awareness and availability of products are one of 
the main factors impeding women’s breakthrough within the energy sector.

GVEP International is supporting these women in Tambacounda and Kédougou, 
Senegal:

<http://www.gvepinternational.org/en/business/energy-opportunities-women-senegal>

Akon, would you support these women's efforts by raising awareness of their 
activites in the energy sector and the key role they play in delivering solar 
lighting to rural regions in Africa?

Will do my best – send the information, I’ll have my people blast it on my

Respecting local economies: 

Also by email Nico Tyabji asks:


Many entrepreneurs, local as well as international, are setting up sustainable 
businesses selling solar lanterns and solar home systems that bring people 
access to electricity, for less than they currently pay for kerosene and 
charging phones. It’s a really exciting story forAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> already. How will he make sure he 
doesn’t kill what’s already happening by giving away lanterns for free?

Akon replies: Our pilot projects are “for free” – free equipment but our plan 
is to participate in official tenders, which will be ‘for profit’ at a later 
stage.

We’re setting pilots in rural areas where people cannot afford lanterns at all 
– the purpose of a pilot is to showcase the business model

We promote the business model for the people that can afford it, at a later 
stage (the tender phase)

Why doesn't Africa open it's electricity markets to western companies who have 
proven track records in providing electricity for more then a 100 years? There 
is no need forAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> to reinvent 
electricity production/distribution.

The truth is: all western companies were approached at the beginning and all 
declined, so we started ourselves. Now that we managed to draw attention on the 
issue, everybody wants to work with us! We have partners from all backgrounds 
and all corners of the world now

That’s all we’ve got time for i’m afraid, but here’s a parting note from Akon: 

Thank you very much for joining the conversation. With your help the 
commitments can turn into actions - we’re doing our part by launching the 
Solektra Solar Academy on 15 December in Bamako, Mali.

We have a great time at COP 21, we’re meeting potential partners, we’ve seen 
interesting commitments being made

The case for aid

By email Tom Moore asks: 

Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon>, love the work you’re doing. I 
believe there is still a place in this sector for aid agencies. Many use the 
term loosely and still promote business and enterprise. SolarAid for example 
use grants to help them catalyse markets and reach the very last mile while 
still selling light and building sustainable markets. There is definitely room 
for partnerships.

Can I ask what you’re doing to ensure the very poorest aren’t overlooked? Many 
still can’t afford the cost of a home system and need help getting on the 
energy ladder.

Akon replies: I don’t believe in aid in Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>, I don’t believe it works.

Aid has been the central point for Africa for years and there has been no 
progress. If you want to help people you have to empower them, employ them and 
educate them so that they can provide for their own

Constant giving only weakens a person’s morale but if you put people in the 
position to the be one giving it strengthens them. This project is designed to 
keep the very poorest out of poverty.

My question would be what is he doing to highlight the ongoing situation in 
DRC the worst humanitarian disaster since WW2 according to the UN. It makes 
Syria look like a playground scuffle. Officially, 8 million dead since 1997 and 
likely much more, millions displaced. The wealth of the "heart of Africa" going 
to the west and technology in things like lamp posts, computers, mobile phones 
and other devices, what has he done to highlight this? What has he done to get 
a hydro plant at the mouth of the Congo river where water flow is enough to 
provide electricity to the entire African continent according to scientists? 
What is he doing to harness the wealth and stop the exploitation of the DRC 
which is the richest country in the world based on natural resources.

Am just an African citizen doing my part in the development of Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> in general. Unfortunately I don’t 
have the power to make decision like that. But you on the other hand should 
spread the information and raise awareness on the issue in Congo. And I will 
support anyway I can to raise the awareness.

We'd love to ask Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon> how he thinks 
that innovation can be nurtured and fostered at a community level so that 
communities are able to take control of their own energy needs, even in the 
remotest of places.

The winner of this year's Ashden Award for Business Innovation, SteamaCo, is 
pioneering remote-controlled renewable energy microgrids for rural areas inKenya
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya> which work like mini power stations 
for each village, supplying enough energy to run small businesses, as well as 
power TVs, radios and bright lights in the home:

<http://www.ashden.org/winners/Steamaco15>

How can we make sure that the benefits of clean energy are passed on to the 
hardest to reach?

The communities need to start by themselves by supporting each others’ 
businesses. That unity will attract other businesses.

We’re working to develop the cheapest microgrid system in the world for the 
hardest to reach

I have a question for Akon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/akon>.

What is Akon Lighting Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> doing 
to work with other aid agencies working in the energy access/lighting space?

I know that the UK's Department for International Development has a similar 
campaign, calledEnergy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> Africa, 
is there any scope for collaboration?

… Again we’re a for profit company, promoting public-private partnerships - so 
we do not work with aid agencies.

Women in Senegal are working hard to provide solar lighting products to their 
off-grid communities. Limited awareness and availability of products are one of 
the main factors impeding women’s breakthrough within the energy sector.

GVEP International is supporting these women in Tambacounda and Kédougou, 
Senegal:
http://www.gvepinternational.org/en/business/energy-opportunities-women-senegal 
<http://www.gvepinternational.org/en/business/energy-opportunities-women-senegal>

Akon, would you support these women's efforts by raising awareness of their 
activites in the energy sector and the key role they play in delivering solar 
lighting to rural regions in Africa?

Will do my best – send the information, I’ll have my people blast it on my 
social networks
 
Respecting local economies: 

Also by email Nico Tyabji asks:


Many entrepreneurs, local as well as international, are setting up sustainable 
businesses selling solar lanterns and solar home systems that bring people 
access to electricity, for less than they currently pay for kerosene and 
charging phones. It’s a really exciting story forAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> already. How will he make sure he 
doesn’t kill what’s already happening by giving away lanterns for free?

Akon replies: Our pilot projects are “for free” – free equipment but our plan 
is to participate in official tenders, which will be ‘for profit’ at a later 
stage.

We’re setting pilots in rural areas where people cannot afford lanterns at all 
– the purpose of a pilot is to showcase the business model

We promote the business model for the people that can afford it, at a later 
stage (the tender phase)
 
Why not use western energy?

Why doesn't Africa open it's electricity markets to western companies who have 
proven track records in providing electricity for more then a 100 years? There 
is no need forAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> to reinvent 
electricity production/distribution.

The truth is: all western companies were approached at the beginning and all 
declined, so we started ourselves. Now that we managed to draw attention on the 
issue, everybody wants to work with us! We have partners from all backgrounds 
and all corners of the world now
