Andrea Arnold has expressed her “shock” at how few women are making films, and 
that positive discrimination in hiring may be necessary.

Speaking to the BBC <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37551382>, 
Arnold was commenting on figures released in 2015 by the Directors Guild of 
America, which suggested thatonly 6.4% of Hollywood films in 2014 and 2014 were 
directed by women

. She said: “The figures were so small. We actively have to employ more 
females, perhaps we need to at this point. There are a lot of capable women out 
there.”

Arnold has directed four features since 2006, and received a string of awards, 
including an Oscar for best short film and three jury prizes at Cannes.

She added: “We’ve grown up mainly on male stories, and most of the films have 
been written and directed by men – and that’s only half of the human race.”

“I remember going to a women’s film festival and feeling a slight amount of 
trepidation, but actually it was fantastic. Some of the films made me cry 
because they really spoke to me.”
