Nasser Hussain's embarrassment at a sequence of 13 winless matches since 
clearing Australian customs on October 18 lifted yesterday as Sri Lanka were 
beaten at the Gabba.

"It's a relief to win, especially for the lads who have been out here since 
the start," Hussain said. "We came here and had to turn things around. The 
fielding was much better, we showed enthusiasm and played sensible cricket."

Hussain scored 79, six of the top seven batsmen contributed to the total of 
292, the bowlers obeyed their captain's orders by putting the ball in the 
desired areas, and catches were held.

The fledgling fast bowlers Jimmy Anderson and Steve Harmison shared four 
wickets and bowled with a consistency which may suggest brighter days ahead for 
England. "I was overjoyed by the young bowlers' performance," Hussain said. 
"For Anderson to bowl in the first 15 overs at Sanath Jayasuriya and get him 
out is exceptional.

"We played well for a large part of the game but we were very poor in the last 
five overs of our innings. To be 280 for five and get 292 is a disgrace. I was 
not amused by that and we should have got 310.

"I've told the lads to enjoy this moment but they know they have to work 
harder now."
