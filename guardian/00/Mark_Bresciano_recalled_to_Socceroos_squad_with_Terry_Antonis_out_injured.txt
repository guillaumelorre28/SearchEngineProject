Mark Bresciano has been summoned into the Socceroos squad in the clearest 
signal yet that he wants to extend his career into next year’s Asian Cup.


The 34-year-old will replace injured Sydney FC midfielder Terry Antonis in 
Australia’s squad for next month’s friendlies against Belgium and Saudi Arabia.


Antonis strained a hamstring in an A-League pre-season match against Newcastle 
on Wednesday night.


Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ange-postecoglou> wanted to use the 
looming internationals as opportunities for younger players to press their 
claims for Australia’s next tournament – the Asian Cup on home soil in January.


But Antonis’s injury prompted Postecoglou to again turn to evergreen 
Bresciano, who has so far remained non-committal about playing in the Asian Cup.


“It is a shame for Terry because we were looking forward to getting him into 
the Socceroos camp and giving him an opportunity,” Postecoglou said in a 
statement on Friday.


“Mark Bresciano will come into the squad, which certainly adds quality and 
experience for what will be two tough matches.”


Bresciano, a veteran of 77 internationals, will be Australia’s most-capped 
player in the 20-man squad for the friendlies against world No.5 Belgium in 
Liège on 4 September and Saudi Arabia in London four days later.


Fellow 34-year-old Tim Cahill (71 caps) is also in the squad – one of only 
four players with more than 30 internationals, along with Bresciano, Carl 
Valeri (50 caps) and captain Mile Jedinak (47 caps).


Bresciano battled back and hip injuries at the World Cup in June, but 
Postecoglou said then he would definitely be selected for the Asian Cup if his 
form and fitness merited it.
