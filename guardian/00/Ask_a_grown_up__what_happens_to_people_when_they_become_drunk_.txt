Alcohol <https://www.theguardian.com/society/alcohol> enters the blood via the 
stomach and bowel, and then flows through the body to the heart, brain and 
muscles. This happens quickly, and many people like the feeling of a warm buzz.

Alcohol affects the parts of the brain that control important body functions, 
for example eyesight, hearing, muscles and sense of balance. Normally, when our 
brain gets information from our eyes and ears, it makes sense of it and tells 
the body what to do. But after a lot to drink, the brain can no longer use the 
information well. People experience blurry vision, they stumble or don't speak 
clearly.

Alcohol also affects the bit of the brain that helps us to think clearly. 
Sometimes not being too aware of the consequences can make people less shy. But 
you can see why it is a bad idea to drive a car, go mountain climbing or do 
important work when you have been drinking.
