The cover of Modern English's single Gathering Dust was nothing special, aside 
from the fact it was designed by Vaughan Oliver, commencing a relationship 
between Oliver and the 4AD label that rivalled that between Peter Saville and 
Factory Records. Oliver's sleeve designs – abstract, dreamlike, elegant – 
seemed to be a perfect visual representation of the label's music, which was 
often, unsurprisingly, abstract, dreamlike, elegant.
