Disney had been courting DuVernay for some time to make the film. It is the 
second big project she has been attached to in recent weeks, the first being 
the sci-fi thriller Intelligent Life,which is set to star Oscar winner Lupita 
Nyong’o 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/09/lupita-nyongo-sci-fi-thriller-intelligent-life-ava-duvernay-poss-director>
. There is no confirmation about which film she will make first.

DuVernay declined the opportunity to direct a screen adaptation of Marvel’s 
Black Panther, which will now be directed by Creed’s Ryan Coogler.

Since breaking into the mainstream with the Martin Luther King biopic Selma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/05/selma-review-martin-luther-king-civil-rights>
, DuVernay has been involved with a number of projects that have yet to come to 
fruition. She is also working on a new show called Queen Sugar, for Oprah’s OWN 
network, and is involved in a Hurricane Katrina-set mystery with David Oyelowo.

A Wrinkle in Time was previously made into a film in 2003, starring Alfre 
Woodard. It received poor reviews and authorMadeleine L’Engle was also 
unimpressed <http://www.newsweek.com/i-dare-you-127959>: “I have glimpsed it … 
I expected it to be bad, and it is.”
