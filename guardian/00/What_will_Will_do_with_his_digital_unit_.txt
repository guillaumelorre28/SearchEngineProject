I note that Will Lewis is travelling four stops up the tube line from Victoria 
to Euston. First thought, the guy has been kicked upstairs. Second thought, 
that's far too simplistic a response.

It was clear from the moment that he went off to Harvard some months ago, to 
take the advanced management programme, that he was destined to move on within 
theTelegraph Media Group (TMG).

As an early convert to the wonders, and potential, of digital media, he has 
been something of a missionary, both within the company and outside. So, in 
that sense, his new digital mission 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/26/telegraph-will-lewis-tony-gallagher>
 is no surprise.

Then again, it's all a bit mysterious too. According to the press release 
announcing his new role, he is "to oversee TMG's digital businesses and set up 
a new entrepreneurial unit based in Euston, with a team of 50."

And what does that mean exactly? Lewis evidently says it's "to step on the 
digital gas" (I've always loved his phraseology). I'm also told it's about 
"building new revenue streams through digital innovations." Golly.

I am led to believe this move is the result of intense discussions involving 
Lewis, chief executiveMurdoch MacLennan and chairman Aidan Barclay, who manages 
the business on behalf of his father and uncle (theBarclay Bros). I am told 
that, in effect, it makes Lewis number two to MacLennan.

Anyway, the upshot is that Will gets to keep the editor-in-chief title - while 
Tony Gallagher is promoted from deputy ed to editor - and he also becomes 
managing director (digital) at TMG's new Euston base.

It's certainly good news to hear that he will be hiring 50 people (maybe some 
of my digitally-focused City University students will get a look-in).

But it is still difficult to grasp exactly what the unit will do to "extend 
the Telegraph brand" - another description of the enterprise. Still, where 
there's a Will, there's surely a digital way.
