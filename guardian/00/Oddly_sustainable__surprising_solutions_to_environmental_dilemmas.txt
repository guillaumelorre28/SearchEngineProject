What do Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash have in common? All three may 
have contributed to the ivory trade and the slaughter of elephants.

Of course, they probably didn’t do it on purpose. But they all strummed one of 
the classic, iconicMartin guitars 
<http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/martin-guitar-and-the-nature-conservancy-partner-to-save-elephants-264752201.html>
. And, if they bought it before the 1970s, it may have included parts made with 
ivory. CF Martin & Co, worried about the elephant slaughter, eventually dropped 
ivory from its repertoire and now – perhaps to shake the ghosts of elephants 
past – is hoping to do even more.

Elephants rock!

The company, created in 1833 when Andrew Jackson was in the White House, is 
teaming up with the Nature Conservancy 
<http://www.martinguitar.com/saveelephants> to help protect African elephants. 
“Forty-five years ago we phased out the use of ivory,” says Chris Martin, CEO 
of the company. “And yet today I’m still concerned about the horrible slaughter 
of elephants. This is a terrible shame and it should stop.”

Decimated by poaching and trophy hunting, the elephant population in Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/jun/13/kenyas-biggest-elephant-killed-by-poachers>
 has shrunk by nearly two thirds since 1980, falling from 1.2 million to a mere 
430,000. Recently, one of world’s largest tuskers, Satao, was slaughtered by 
poachers in Kenya, sparking outrage across the world.

Martin and the Nature Conservancy 
<https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/how-can-guitars-save-elephants> are looking 
to raise money and awareness to better protect the prized mammal. The pair have 
launched a fund raising campaign at Indiegogo and have already topped their 
initial fundraising goal of $12,000.

“Martin Guitar is lending their star power to help end this crisis and the 
awareness they raise for the issue will make a real difference,” says David 
Banks, managing director for the Nature Conservancy’s Africa Program.

You’ve taken the peanuts. Now our contrails? 

Airlines, especially in America, are famous for their constant cutbacks. But 
here is one we can all get behind: finding a way to cut theirrapidly rising 
carbon emissions 
<http://www.climatenewsnetwork.net/2014/06/longer-flight-paths-can-cut-climate-impact-2/>
.

Researchers at the University of Redding in Britain recently demonstrated that 
jets contribute less to global warming if they can dodge the places that help 
produce condensation trails – even if it means flying longer. So, by cutting 
their vapor trails, airlines could cut their carbon.


Contrails form when jets fly into cold and moist air, often when it is 
combined with a high pressure system. Just like clouds, contrails can trap some 
of the infrared energy radiating from Earth, and so have a net warming effect 
on the planet.


“If we can predict the regions where contrails will from, it may be possible 
to mitigate their effect, routing aircraft to avoid them,” says Emma Irvine at 
Reading’s department of Meteorology.

Trees: make some noise!

Here is a twist on an age-old question: if an illegal logger hacks at a tree 
in a rainforest, does anybody else hear it?


Soon the proper authorities might.

Between 50% and 90% of rainforest logging is illegal; unfortunately, the 
authorities aren’t always around to hear – much less catch – tree poachers in 
action. However, a California startup, Rainforest Connection, may have found a 
solution: a listening device made up of old smart phones. The gadget, which 
looks like a rather dumb pinwheel of techno-detritus when tacked high in a 
tree, will be able to tell authorities when bad guys are up to no good in the 
forest.

“This technology enables the forest to talk to the world,” said Neil Young, 
the Canadian born rocker who spoke on a video for the company’sKickstarter 
campaign 
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/topherwhite/rainforest-connection-phones-turned-to-forest-guar>
.


The campaign has already raised nearly $40,000 of its $100,000 goal to help 
make the solar-powered gizmos. Besides helping saving the tress and the natural 
habitat, the company says it will also slow global warming.


“With each one of these devices we are able to do something equivalent of 
taking 3,000 cars off the road by protecting an entire square mile of 
endangered forest,” says Topher White, a physicist and founder of the company.

The devices, which will be installed in Cameroon this year with expansion 
plans to other countries, “can detect and pinpoint signs of environmental 
destruction activity – such as chainsaws, gunshots and animal distress calls – 
at great distance.”


“This is the most exciting critical new tool I’ve seen that I think can help 
us get the job done,” says Randy Hayes, the founder of the Rainforest Action 
Network.
