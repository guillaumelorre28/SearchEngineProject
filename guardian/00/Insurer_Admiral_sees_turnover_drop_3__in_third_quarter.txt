Car insurer Admiral <https://www.theguardian.com/business/admiralgroup> saw 
turnover fall in the third quarter by 3% compared with a year earlier in a 
competitive market, it said on Friday.

Admiral competes in the UK with rivals including RSA, Direct Line and esure 
and increasingly popular price-comparison websites.

“We anticipate that future earnings will be impacted by the decline in 
premiums experienced across the market in recent years, coupled with a return 
to higher claims inflation,” chief executive Henry Engelhardt said.

Turnover at the group, whose other brands include Elephant, Diamond and Bell, 
fell to £513m while its UK car insurance turnover fell by 5% to £419m. Group 
customers rose by 10% to 4.03 million, compared with the third quarter of 2013, 
and UK customers rose by 5% to 3.18 million.

Admiral also said it expected the performance of its UK price comparison site, 
Confused.com, to be weaker in the second half compared with the first half of 
2014.

Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, reiterated his “sell” 
recommendation on the stock, citing a “deteriorating” claims environment for 
the sector.

The Admiral results came a day after rival Aviva said the number of traffic 
accidents staged by criminal gangs to make money from whiplash compensation has 
hit an all-time high.

So far this year the levels of organised fraud are already 21% higher than in 
the whole of 2013, the insurer said, with more than 50% of fraudulent motor 
injury claims it was detecting being made by organised gangs.

The majority involve “crash for cash” incidents, where fraudsters either 
deliberately crash two of their own vehicles together in private or brake 
sharply in front of an innocent driver’s car, causing that driver to go into 
the back of them.
