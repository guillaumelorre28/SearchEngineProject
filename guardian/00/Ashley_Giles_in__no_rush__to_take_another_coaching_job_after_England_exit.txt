Ashley Giles <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashley-giles> is in "no rush" 
to take another job after his brutal dumping by England last month, and will 
instead take time out to wait for the right role in which to return.

Giles stood down as an England selector

 to take over from Andy Flower as coach, leaving him without any direct 
involvement in the game for the first time since the start of his playing 
career more than 20 years ago.

"I think it's important in the short-term to take some time out and reflect â€“ 
with the family as well, because since I retired in 2007 I went straight into 
coaching and since then I've been pretty busy, as a selector and a coach," the 
41-year-old said on Sky Sports on Sunday, making his first public comments 
since losing the job as England's one-day coach, while working as a member of 
the commentary team for the County Championship match between Durham and 
Yorkshire. "It depends on opportunities, I guess, around the world and in this 
country. At the moment I'm not rushing."

However Giles made it clear that he still sees his future as a coach. "I love 
coaching, I don't think anything's changed on that front," he added. "Of course 
through recent experiences your confidence takes a little bit of a hit. But I 
enjoy working with players, improving players, that's the buzz."
