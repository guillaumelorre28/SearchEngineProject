andThe West Wing <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-west-wing>.

Molly’s Game will tell the story of Molly Bloom, also known as the “poker 
princess”, who started out as a world-class skier but, once she failed to make 
the Olympic grade, used her smarts to run a high-stakes weekly poker game.

book as a moody player and a poor tipper. Her luck ran out when she became the 
subject of an FBI investigation. She was ultimately fined $1,000 and sentenced 
to a year’s probation.

awards glory, having picked up Bafta and Golden Globe nominations. He is also
