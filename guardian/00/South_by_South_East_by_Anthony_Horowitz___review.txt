 Anthony Horowitz, The Diamond Brothers in South by South East 
I really enjoyed reading this book because it is really descriptive and 
intriguing as well as gripping. The Diamond Brothers are now my favourite 
series to read. I think that the best one in the series is I Know What You Did 
Last Wednesday.

Anthony Horowitz <https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthony-horowitz> is a 
great writer. In his writing he includes very bad puns that are so bad it makes 
them funny. As an example:

"That had brought in a bit more cash but we'd spent most of it on a skiing 
holiday and medical bills for Tim's broken leg. We'd have gone National Health 
but it was someone else's leg he broke."

In short, South by South East is about a 'detective' called Tim Diamond 
(Herbert Simple) and his younger brother Nick. A mysterious man knocks on their 
door who apparently works for MI6. Tim and Nick are sent on a mission to hunt 
down the mass murderer Charon, but it isn't as easy as it sounds…

I don't think that there is anything Anthony could improve on, as South by 
South East is perfect.
