Panda Bear, aka Noah Lennox – one quarter of the Animal Collective 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/animalcollective> line-up – has been working 
on the follow-up to his Person Pitch album for what seems like an eternity. 
Each new announcement about his fourth solo set seemed to arrive with a new 
release date, and despite tracks being released as 7in singles every so often, 
things seemed to have stalled. Now Tomboy finally has a set release date (11 
April) and another new track is available, the typically lush-sounding Surfer's 
Hymn, which marries layers of distorted vocals with snatches of frenzied 
percussion and the literal sound of waves crashing against a shore. It's also 
been remixed by London-based DJ/producer Darren Cunningham, aka Actress, who 
strips out most of the vocals and creates a tribal dance cacophony.

Surfer's Hymn is out on the 28 March via Kompakt. You can hear the Actress 
remixhere <http://soundcloud.com/kompakt/panda-bear-surfers-hymn-actress-remix>.
