 appeared in court charged with illegally entering the country.

Two days after landing a Black Hawk helicopter in the border town of 
Alexandroupoli, the military personnel, who have sought refuge inGreece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, were given until Thursday to 
prepare for a trial that has unsettled officials in both countries.

Calling for their extradition, Turkey’s government has been quick to brand 
them traitors.

“They fear for their lives and do not believe they will be given a fair trial 
there,” said Vasiliki Marinaki, one of three Greek lawyers representing the 
men. “They insist they were not involved in the coup,” she added, saying that 
the officers had been on a mission to save wounded civilians when they decided 
to flee after coming under police fire.

The eight, who had initially removed the insignia from their uniforms but have 
since been identified as two colonels, four captains and two sergeants, left 
court handcuffed to each other in pairs.

Their appearance – in civilian clothes and with heads covered – elicited howls 
of protest from members of Greece’s Turkish-speaking Muslim minority who had 
also gathered for the hearing.

Marinaki said she had asked that all eight remain in detention for security 
reasons.

The sight of the Black Hawk not only entering Greek airspace but requesting to 
make an emergency landing after issuing a May Day alert unnerved the 
leftist-led Athens government and military top brass, who immediately demanded 
the scrambling of F-16 fighter jets.

Though Nato allies, the two countries are also long-time regional foes that 
have clashed over Cyprus and come close to war on numerous occasions. This is 
the first time Turkish military personnel have requested asylum in Greece.

The attempted coup had barely been foiled when Turkey’s president, Recep 
Tayyip Erdoğan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan>, called 
the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to demand that the men be speedily 
returned.

“Politically and diplomatically it is a hot potato for Greece,” the defence 
expert Thanos Dokos told the Guardian. “This is a government that is sensitive 
to human rights issues but also knows that the cost of not sending them back 
could be great. Ultimately much will depend on whether the death penalty is 
reinstated [in Turkey].”

With officials in crisis-hit Greece also concerned about the ability of 
Turkish authorities to stop new waves of migrants pouring into the country 
following the coup, Athens has attempted to walk a middle line.

On Monday, the deputy defence minister, Dimitris Vitsas, insisted that while 
the asylum requests had to be dealt with under international law, Turkey had a 
strong argument for their extradition because the officers were accused of 
participating in an attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government.
