So this one's about Justin Timberlake?

I'm pretty sure you're thinking of *NSync, the late-90s American boy band. 
This is actually aboutNails Inc, the British nail bar chain. Started in 1999 by 
a young lady named Thea Green, Nails Inc is now a big player in the dizzy world 
of nails with two stores in London, fifty-odd outlets in department stores 
scattered throughout the country, and recently launched concessions in the US 
and Canada. Every week, over 30,000 polishes are sold worldwide and Nails Inc 
see over 10,000 women for manicures. Shades are named after London streets and 
boroughs chosen to reflect the colour –Carnaby Street

 is a 60s inspired acid yellow andCamden

 is an edgy black crackle top coat.

And what's the verdict?

At around £11 a pot, colours from Nails Inc are a bit dearer than your 
standard fare. But I must admit that I'm a fan. I'm not all that loyal to nail 
colour brands - it's more of an as-and-when kind of thing. I'm in Boots, I need 
a nice red, I'll buy a £4.59 pot fromRimmel 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/jan/23/brief-history-rimmel>
 and it will do the job nicely. However I always notice that a Nails Inc nail 
polish will last considerably longer than other brands I wear. Is a few extra 
days of non-chipped nails worth it for more than twice the price? I'm not so 
sure. But there are some shades available in a £5 mini-version which means 
experimenting is a bit more purse-friendly. TryShoreditch (a classic hot pink) 
orElizabeth Street (a lovely creamy neutral shade) for starters (available from 
nailsinc.com <http://www.nailsinc.com/>). If you're feeling a little braver, 
it's possible to buy a whole collection at once and it's actually a very 
economical way to update your nails. The newly launchedNeon & Nude collection 
(£22 for six mini pots) is a jazzy little set combining three mushroomy-beige 
shades with three ultra-bright colours. Wear them on their own, or create your 
own trendy little manicure using a nude base and a neon tip.

Anything else?

• To mark the Queen's jubilee, Nails Inc are launching Jubilee (£15, from 
May), a glittery mix of blue, red and silver sparkles so even your nails can be 
patriotic.

• If £11 is a bit too much on the spenny side, then take a look at Models Own (
modelsownit.com <http://www.modelsownit.com/>). Loads of great shades all at £5 
(or less the more you order) and with a staying power that comes a close second 
to Nails Inc.
