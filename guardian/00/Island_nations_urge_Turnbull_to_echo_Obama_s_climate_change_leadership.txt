Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> 
has been urged to show the same interest in the impact of climate change on low 
lying island island states as Barack Obama and to return Australia “to its 
former leadership role in the Pacific.”


Speaking after foreign minister Julie Bishop ridiculed a Labor claim that one 
of theMarshall Islands <https://www.theguardian.com/world/marshall-islands> had 
disappeared into the sea, Marshall Island’s foreign minister Tony de Brum told 
Guardian Australia he was hoping Australia might soon start to take the 
countries’ fears about the impact of climate change as seriously as the US 
president did.

Obama recognised the importance and special concerns of the low lying states 
in a meeting on the sidelines of the Paris conference on Tuesday with leaders 
from Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, St Lucia, Barbados and Papua New Guinea.

Speaking after the meeting, Obama described himself as “an island boy”, 
referring to his childhood on Hawaii, and urged the conference to listen to 
their concerns.

“Their population are amongst the most vulnerable to the ravages of climate 
change ... Some of their nations could disappear entirely and as weather 
patterns change, we might deal with tens of millions of climate refugees in the
Asia Pacific <https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific> region,” he said.

He said Paris summit must “serve the interests of the most vulnerable” as well 
as the most powerful.

Bishop had mocked her Labor counterpart Tanya Plibersek in parliament on 
Tuesday for claiming the island of Eneko had “disappeared” due to rising sea 
levels when in fact it was a “beautiful and accessible beach getaway”.

 “You can rent a bungalow for $50 a night. It is in good condition, we’re 
told. There are houses, lawns, gardens, there is a toilet block and there are 
picnic tables,” Bishop said.

It subsequently emerged that Plibersek’s transcript had misnamed the island, 
and that she had been referring to a different island, called Anebok, which had 
disappeared.

De Brum said Australia had in recent years “not been very supportive of our 
goals.”

“The meeting with Obama was one of the most significant meetings we have had 
in a long long time. He bolstered the idea that even though we are small we 
have to have a voice in these negotiations. We did not meet with Turnbull in 
Paris but we hope we might engage with him in the future. He an island boy as 
well, from a very big island.

“There is a lot of room for improvement for Australia to return to its former 
leadership role in the Pacific,” de Brum said.

Speaking to Guardian Australia in Paris, opposition leader accused Bill 
Shorten accused Bishop of having a “Peter Dutton moment” –a reference to the 
immigration minister’s joke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/11/peter-dutton-jokes-with-tony-abbott-about-rising-sea-levels-in-pacific-nations>
 – picked up on a boom mic – about rising sea levels in the Pacific.

“Her comments makes Australia look stupid. The Pacific islands see Australia 
as a big brother and Julie Bishop is treating their concerns as a political 
football,” he said.

“This was a Peter Dutton moment for Julie Bishop. She is a more sophisticated 
personality than Peter Dutton and she should know better than to play gotcha 
games with this policy.”

Shorten and Plibersek travelled to Kiribati and the Marshall Islands in 
October to investigate the impacts of climate change and Shorten had pictures 
of where Anebok had been on his mobile phone.

Leaders of neighbouring Pacific nations have long tried to put pressure on 
Australia and New Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/06/australias-inaction-on-climate-change-set-to-dominate-pacific-island-talks>
 to take a tougher stance in the international talks on climate change and to 
take on more ambitious domestic policies.

Obama did not change his administration’s opposition to some of their demands, 
including so-called “loss and damage” payments from major economies based on 
historical emissions and the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees 
instead of 2 degrees.

Former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who is also at the climate summit said the 
South Pacific countries had been “utterly contemptuous of the positions being 
adopted by the Abbott government and that was beginning to fracture Australia’s 
foreign policy position in the Pacific: but were now “suspending doubt” to see 
whether the new Australian prime minister implemented policy changes.

In the detailed negotiations in Paris Australian officials are understood to 
be backing some of the island states goals, including looking for a way to 
“reference” the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees and their 
particular vulnerability to climate change.
