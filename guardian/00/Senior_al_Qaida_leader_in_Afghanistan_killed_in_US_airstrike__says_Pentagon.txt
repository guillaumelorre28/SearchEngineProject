The US military <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military> killed 
al-Qaida’s leader for northeastern Afghanistan in an air strike last month, in 
a major blow to the group as it seeks to re-establish safe havens in the 
country.


Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook described the assault that killed Farouq 
al-Qahtani as a “precision strike” and said it took place on October 23 in 
Kunar, east of the capital, Kabul.

“This successful strike is another example of US operations to degrade 
international terrorist networks and target terrorist leaders who seek to 
attack the US homeland, our interests and our allies abroad,” Cook said in a 
statement.

Qahtani has operated in Afghanistan since at least 2009 and led an al-Qaida 
battalion since at least mid-2010.

His deputy Utabi was seen as the second- or third-most senior al-Qaida leader 
in Afghanistan.
