Walk the line

Like most of the portraits by one of Glasgow’s famous sons – artist, novelist 
and playwrightAlasdair Gray <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alasdairgray> – 
this pen drawing recalls the work of his hero William Blake. Its clean, 
delicate lines and mannered features suggest the gothic art Blake loved.

Back to the future

Its subject – a frequent model for the artist – is a 20th-century woman in 
shiny boots and patterned tights. Yet with her otherworldly gaze, Marion Oag 
could easily be a statue on a cathedral, as Gray marries old and new.

Guiding light

While Blake saw angels on street corners, Gray’s portrait gives us a goddess 
in a living room, Venus hovering in the background like his model’s guardian 
spirit. Behind her, an imaginary fusion of local waterscapes glints.

Ordinary to extraordinary

As with Lanark, Gray’s great experimental novel of 1981, his artworks 
transform his immediate surrounds into something fantastical – full of both 
personal and mythic symbolism. This little drawing, created in his former 
lodgings, packs a lot in.
