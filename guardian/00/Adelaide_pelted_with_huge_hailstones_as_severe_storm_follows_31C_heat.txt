The Bureau of Meteorology warned wind gusts of more than 125 km/h were 
possible in the North East Pastoral, Mid North and Riverland areas.

Localised flash flooding was reported as some areas received up to 10mm of 
rain in as many minutes. The bureau said areas that may be particularly 
affected include Adelaide, Whyalla, Renmark, Mount Gambier, Leigh Creek and 
Moomba.

Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Mark Anolak told the ABC: “Larger hail 
has fallen, particularly through the north-eastern areas of the Adelaide 
metropolitan area.”

“I don’t now how often we see hailstones this big in Adelaide,” he said.
