The singer’s third album, 25, has reclaimed the top spot thanks to a 
post-festival sales surge of 231% on last week, according to the Official 
Charts Company.

Buoyed by its release on internet music streaming services on 24 June, the 
recording has logged a 13th week at the top. The Londoner’s back catalogue is 
also enjoying a resurgence, with her second album, 21, ranked at No 10, while 
her debut album, 19, is back in the top 40 at No 12 after a six-month break.

Adele is not the only artist basking in the glow of Glastonbury: Coldplay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay>, who headlined on the closing 
night of the festival, have enjoyed a 28% rise in sales week on week. The band, 
fronted by the singer Chris Martin, are up to No 2 with their latest release, A 
Head Full of Dreams.

Electric Light Orchestra, who performed during Sunday’s legends slot at 
Glastonbury

, are up to No 3 with their greatest hits collection All Over The World.

The top 30 also sees Glastonbury’s Friday headliners Muse’s album Drones, as 
well as What Went Down by Foals, selling well. The 1975’s album I Like It When 
You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It is also moving 
upwards. Post-Glastonbury, chart interest continues in Tame Impala’s Currents 
and The Last Shadow Puppets’ Everything You’ve Come to Expect.
