Journalists often talk about “lucky” reporters, meaning those who go somewhere 
and find themselves in the middle of a story. I think I am a lucky reporter. Or 
maybe it is just that when you get out of London things happen.

I visited Angela Eagle’s Merseyside seat, Wallasey, last week in the vague 
hope of attending a constituencyLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party (CLP) meeting. I have got 
to know many party members on Merseyside through this project, but it was 
always a long shot. These are private meetings and if only one member present 
objected to the presence of a reporter, I would not have been able to cover it.


Just hours before members were due to meet, party officials were told that all 
meetings of CLPs and their branches were suspended until after the leadership 
election in September. There was no such suspension during last year’s 
leadership contest. Maybe feelings are running so strong that MPs did not fancy 
facing critical members of their CLPs.

Sarah Byrne, a Labour member, shares her thoughts on constituency meetings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/jul/20/labour-liverpool-meeting-new-members-new-expectations-video>
In response to the suspension, members of the New Brighton branch of the 
Wallasey constituency went ahead anyway with an unofficial meeting – which 
meant there was no bar to me attending. In Birkenhead, there was a similar act 
of defiance, with members there holding an “unofficial” pub meet-up, which I 
also attended.

I wrote about both events  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/labour-grassroots-rebel-against-nec-restrictions-on-leadership-contest>
at the end of last week, sent out tweets and emails, and received hundreds of 
responses from Labour members applauding the actions of Wallasey and Birkenhead 
and saying they too had held – or were planning to hold – unofficial meetings.

What was happening on the ground locally was mirrored elsewhere around the 
country. This was always the point of this project: to tell the story of what 
is happening to the Labour party at grassroots level across the country through 
the prism ofLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/liverpool>.
 A letter submitted by Sarah Byrne, a long-term Labour voter, asking for 
advice on how to engage with CLP meetings when she feels they do not encourage 
working people to participate 
And that story has turned out to be of a divided and dysfunctional Labour 
party. Even before the failed coup and the new leadership contest, I’d heard 
from Sarah Byrne, a party member in Liverpool, about how CLPs were handling the 
influx of new members.

Sarah, a marketing manager, had switched from the Greens to Labour when Corbyn 
became leader last year. She had not found the Liverpool Riverside CLP’s 
meeting a positive experience, she said. “Each time I have gone, I come away 
feeling worse and less engaged.” It is the paperwork, the lack of objectives 
and loads of jargon, she said, but also the “shouty” atmosphere.

One of the reasons for the “shouty” atmosphere is the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict: Liverpool Riverside MP Louise Ellman is a member of Labour Friends of 
Israel.

Sarah wrote a letter to councillors offering feedback as a new member, and 
asking for advice on how she might better learn, engage and participate. I 
spoke to her this week about the response she had had from party officials, 
which she said has so far proved to be limited. There was an attempt to 
respond, she said. “But in a super-defensive way.” We approached them for 
comment for this piece, but they declined.

Determined to remain positive, Sarah has put forward a seven-point plan to 
make CLPs more welcoming to new members, which she last week shared onour 
Labour and Liverpool facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/LabourandLiverpool/posts/1626117841031733>. She is 
sticking with Labour for the time being but if there is no change, she might go 
somewhere else.

Joining a party is one of the few ways ordinary people have to participate in 
the politics which affect their lives. If joining means only attending meetings 
which are unpleasant and ineffective, we are left with a democratic deficit.

1. Clarify the meeting’s objectives. Are we here to listen to a report from 
our MP and a councillor and have a discussion on each? Maybe that is more than 
enough for two hours and little else should be scheduled. Perhaps the reports 
could be emailed in advance to allow time for more discussion.

2. Consider ward meetings for all wards so that there is extra opportunity for 
engagement and discussion. Smaller meetings could help develop friendlier 
relations between members and thereby facilitate friendlier, less 
confrontational CLP meetings.

3. Consider an online forum for the constituency and/or ward so that debate 
can continue after meetings.

4. Consider topic-based meetings or organised debates so that members have 
further opportunity to learn about and discuss wider political issues. Some 
ward meetings (eg in Chester) have 45 minutes of a topic-based debate added 
into each ward meeting. Members take turns researching and presenting for the 
debates.

5. Ask for feedback from members on meetings in order to facilitate continuous 
improvement on how we communicate and organise.

6. Offer welcome/induction meetings to new members to get to know them, find 
out why they joined and give an introduction to current issues, how the party 
operates and how they can get involved.

7. Consider alternative ways for people to volunteer and engage other than 
leafleting and canvassing. To some members this seems to be an old-fashioned 
way to campaign. Could there be a use for those with skills in research, 
presentation, event management, social media etc?”

The call to make CLPs more welcoming for new members – and the overarching 
need for reform – has become more pertinent in the last few weeks, withmore 
than 100,000 new members reported to have joined since the EU referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/jeremy-corbyn-stands-defiant-after-labour-membership-surge>
.

What do you make of Byrne’s proposals? Should they be embraced? Does the party 
structure need much more fundamental changes? Are reforms likely to be even on 
the agenda any time soon given the bitter infighting under way at present? Have 
you had a similar experience?
