The country simply cannot go on like this over the question of official 
secrecy. The fundamental problem is easy to spell out: because the present 
administration of Mrs Thatcher tries to make everything secret, there is no 
national consensus over what should properly be kept secret and what the public 
has a right to know. The Government, aware it is going against the grain of 
public and press opinion, uses erratic tactics, depending on what it thinks it 
can get away with: ranging from the prison cell under theOfficial Secrets Act 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/official-secrets-act> for the hapless – and 
harmless – Miss Sarah Tisdall, to wretched dithering over the forceful, 
left-wing journalist Duncan Campbell and his well-advertised plans last week to 
expose the Zircon satellite project.

Meanwhile basic civil liberties go by the board. The BBC is leant on behind 
the scenes; the High Court is asked to grant injunctions against MPs. The Prime 
Minister herself set a very bad example to us all by conniving at the leak of a 
classified letter by her own law officer during the Westland affair.

Key quote

“Short stories still get short shrift. They are hard to review, hard to sell, 
not often awarded prizes. ForAlice Munro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-munro>, it is clearly the natural 
medium. She is never going to write a blockbuster, thank goodness. Read not 
more than one of her stories a day and allow them to work their spell slowly: 
they are made to last.”Claire Tomalin reviews The Progress of Love

Talking point

Europe may become a completely independent space power within a decade, with 
its own launcher, manned spacecraft and space station. [It] will have to look 
carefully at the experiences of the American space programme - in which case 
the bitter lessons of Challenger may not have been in vain.
