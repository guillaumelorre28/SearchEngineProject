Used to be married to Whitney Houston right?
Erm... No. This is Bobbi with an "i", the woman behind the huge cosmetics 
brand soon to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Bobbi started working as 
professional make-up artist in 1980 and increasingly became frustrated with the 
lack of suit-all shades available to her, so often mixed her own. A chance 
meeting with a chemist lead her to design her own lip colours and in 1991 ten 
brown-based shades went on sale in Bergdorf Goodman in New York, selling over a 
100 in the first day. In 1995, Bobbi sold the empire to Estee Lauder, but the 
brand still maintains the same ethos it started with - to create make-up for 
"women who want to look like themselves only prettier and more confident".

Eh?
I think what she's trying to say is that hers are products that aim to enhance 
what you already have. Neutral colours for lips, eyes and cheeks rather than 
outlandish, more fashion-led shades. Bobbi Brown is your go to brand for that 
"Oh-I've-hardly-got-any-makeup-on-honest" look that takes half an hour to 
perfect.
 Bobbi Brown make-up is soon to celebrate its 20th anniversary. 


What should I be looking out for?
Over the 20 years since Bobbi Brown entered the market, she has created 
numerous best-sellers including handy foundation sticks, excellent brushes, and 
the hugely popular range of shimmer bricks (one of which is apparently sold 
somewhere in the world every minute). The long wear cream eye shadow is a 
particular favourite of mine (£17 from the website <>). So quick and easy to 
apply with your finger, I recommend picking a colour close to your skin tone to 
wear on its own or as a great base on which to build up powder eye-shadows. It 
really won't shift or crease. The creamy concealer (£17, as before <>) is also 
another can't-live-without-it product. It's the perfect consistency and in 14 
shades it's highly likely there'll be one that's a good match. My make-up bag 
looks as though it's sponsored by Bobbi Brown, so I could go on...

And for the future?
To mark the brand's 20th anniversary, Bobbi Brown are launching a special 
'1991' lip palette (£43, out in October). It includes the ten original shades, 
plus ten new colours of a more pink, red, or coral base so it covers the whole 
lip colour spectrum.
