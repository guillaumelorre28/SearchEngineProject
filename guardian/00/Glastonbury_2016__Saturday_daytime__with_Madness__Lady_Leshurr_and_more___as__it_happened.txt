M√∏: party on the Peel stage

Forget the Theatre stage: all the drama is taking place at M√∏‚Äôs John Peel 
party. An unrelenting barrage of dance moves, fist-clenching and general 
limb-trashing sets the tone for Glastonbury‚Äôs Saturday night. While the slower 
bits of the set feel a little bulbous and billowy, the Danish punk turned 
Scandipop superstar‚Äôs uptempo songs are totally club-ready. She ends her set on 
theMajor Lazer track Lean On <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqeW9_5kURI> ‚Äì 
the most-streamed song ever on Spotify ‚Äì which she co-wrote, before 
crowdsurfing, hands still pumping the air, the audience carrying her towards a 
truly triumphant finish.

They call it Madness

Michael Hann
 Suggs ‚Ä¶ Not an embarrassment, or a living endorsement. Photograph: Stoyan 
Nenov/Reuters 
Very much a set of two halves from the Nutty Boys on the Pyramid stage. Though 
they open with Embarrassment, and follow it with The Prince, then throw in My 
Girl and Wings of a Dove, there‚Äôs a lot of less familiar material. That run 
ends when guitarist Chris ‚ÄúChrissy Boy‚Äù Foreman performs a bizarre karaoke 
version of AC/DC‚Äôs Highway to Hell. After that, it‚Äôs hit after hit after hit, 
and the crowd are getting as nutty as they can. given the fact they can‚Äôt move 
their feet. They encore with a version of David Bowie‚Äôs Kooks, and finish with 
It Must Be Love, as perfect a moment as you could wish for.

Paradoxically industrious US slacker Kurt Vile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/29/kurt-vile-wakin-pretty-daze> has 
been bringing his jams to The Park. Kate Hutchinson was there:

Here is the world‚Äôs most chipper festival act, Kurt Vile, bringing smiles and 
stage banter that would put Vince Staples to shame. Just kidding. His hair 
hangs over his eyes as he announces ‚ÄúI think I prefer mud‚Äù in that distinctive, 
wonderfully sneery drawl of his, and launches into his morose outlaw banjo 
blues. Luckily his guitar playing, all spangly and twangly grunge Americana, is 
the real draw here.

Guardian contributor Hannah J Davies went to see Aussie trio Jagwar Ma:

With their swirling synth hooks and shimmy-ready basslines, the Aussie trio 
had crowds floating off to another dimension at the already 
laidback-as-harem-pants location of the Park stage. Expect even more ephemeral 
grooves later on as Tame Impala carry on the psych rock rollercoaster.

Ed Miliband chats Brexit

Lisa O‚ÄôCarroll went down to the Green Futures to see Ed Miliband speak:


Ed Miliband has said Jeremy Corbyn is not to blame for the failed Remain 
campaign.

He said the referendum result reflected deafness in Westminster to problems 
outside London and a wider discontent about jobs and housing.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should blame Jeremy Corbyn for the seismic earthquake,‚Äù he 
said at the Speakers forum.

The task ahead was to focus beyond party politics and the future of the 
country, he told a small crowd in a muddy arena. ‚ÄúPart of the problem is that 
Westminster has been talking to itself too much,‚Äù he said.

He added that Labour‚Äôs political vision for a post-Brexit Britain is ‚Äúnot 
there yet‚Äù and called on the left to regroup to build that.


‚ÄúOur task is to come up with that vision and to use this opportunity to 
recognise what‚Äôs driven this decision,‚Äù he said.

Miliband is the only senior Labour figure to appear at Glastonbury after both 
Jeremy Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell pulled out of scheduled 
panel discussions.

Miliband said the exit vote reflected years of pent-up ‚Äúlegitimate grievances‚Äù 
about jobs, housing as well as immigration. ‚ÄúThis is a moment when many people 
are feeling fear but, in my view, we have got to accept the vote and then shape 
it [the future] around progressive causes,‚Äù he said.

He also called on David Cameron to ratify the Paris climate change agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations>
 as his last act in office.

Geoff Barrow: ‚Äòthe racists won‚Äô

Coming up in a bit on the William‚Äôs Green stage are BEAK>, aka Geoff Barrow 
from Portishead‚Äôs other band. Reckon there‚Äôll be a good chance of some 
anti-Brexit bants, judging by his Twitter:

It‚Äôs actually quite hard to tell there‚Äôs been a sea change in the European 
sociopolitical climate ‚Äì Glastonbury actually feels more like its own nation 
state operating independently of the rest of Somerset, as if founded by some 
cider-quaffing libertarian.

M√∏: party on the Peel stage

Forget the Theatre stage: all the drama is taking place at M√∏‚Äôs John Peel 
party. An unrelenting barrage of dance moves, fist-clenching and general 
limb-trashing sets the tone for Glastonbury‚Äôs Saturday night. While the slower 
bits of the set feel a little bulbous and billowy, the Danish punk turned 
Scandipop superstar‚Äôs uptempo songs are totally club-ready. She ends her set on 
theMajor Lazer track Lean On <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqeW9_5kURI> ‚Äì 
the most-streamed song ever on Spotify ‚Äì which she co-wrote, before 
crowdsurfing, hands still pumping the air, the audience carrying her towards a 
truly triumphant finish.

Very much a set of two halves from the Nutty Boys on the Pyramid stage. Though 
they open with Embarrassment, and follow it with The Prince, then throw in My 
Girl and Wings of a Dove, there‚Äôs a lot of less familiar material. That run 
ends when guitarist Chris ‚ÄúChrissy Boy‚Äù Foreman performs a bizarre karaoke 
version of AC/DC‚Äôs Highway to Hell. After that, it‚Äôs hit after hit after hit, 
and the crowd are getting as nutty as they can. given the fact they can‚Äôt move 
their feet. They encore with a version of David Bowie‚Äôs Kooks, and finish with 
It Must Be Love, as perfect a moment as you could wish for.

Paradoxically industrious US slacker Kurt Vile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/29/kurt-vile-wakin-pretty-daze> has 
been bringing his jams to The Park. Kate Hutchinson was there:

Here is the world‚Äôs most chipper festival act, Kurt Vile, bringing smiles and 
stage banter that would put Vince Staples to shame. Just kidding. His hair 
hangs over his eyes as he announces ‚ÄúI think I prefer mud‚Äù in that distinctive, 
wonderfully sneery drawl of his, and launches into his morose outlaw banjo 
blues. Luckily his guitar playing, all spangly and twangly grunge Americana, is 
the real draw here.

Guardian contributor Hannah J Davies went to see Aussie trio Jagwar Ma:

With their swirling synth hooks and shimmy-ready basslines, the Aussie trio 
had crowds floating off to another dimension at the already 
laidback-as-harem-pants location of the Park stage. Expect even more ephemeral 
grooves later on as Tame Impala carry on the psych rock rollercoaster.
 
Last night‚Äôs legends

  Ed Miliband MP speaks to Roger Harrabin, the BBC‚Äôs environment analyst.

Lisa O‚ÄôCarroll went down to the Green Futures to see Ed Miliband speak:


Ed Miliband has said Jeremy Corbyn is not to blame for the failed Remain 
campaign.

He said the referendum result reflected deafness in Westminster to problems 
outside London and a wider discontent about jobs and housing.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should blame Jeremy Corbyn for the seismic earthquake,‚Äù he 
said at the Speakers forum.

The task ahead was to focus beyond party politics and the future of the 
country, he told a small crowd in a muddy arena. ‚ÄúPart of the problem is that 
Westminster has been talking to itself too much,‚Äù he said.

He added that Labour‚Äôs political vision for a post-Brexit Britain is ‚Äúnot 
there yet‚Äù and called on the left to regroup to build that.


‚ÄúOur task is to come up with that vision and to use this opportunity to 
recognise what‚Äôs driven this decision,‚Äù he said.

Miliband is the only senior Labour figure to appear at Glastonbury after both 
Jeremy Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell pulled out of scheduled 
panel discussions.

Miliband said the exit vote reflected years of pent-up ‚Äúlegitimate grievances‚Äù 
about jobs, housing as well as immigration. ‚ÄúThis is a moment when many people 
are feeling fear but, in my view, we have got to accept the vote and then shape 
it [the future] around progressive causes,‚Äù he said.

He also called on David Cameron to ratify the Paris climate change agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations>
 as his last act in office.

Geoff Barrow: ‚Äòthe racists won‚Äô

Coming up in a bit on the William‚Äôs Green stage are BEAK>, aka Geoff Barrow

It‚Äôs actually quite hard to tell there‚Äôs been a sea change in the European 
sociopolitical climate ‚Äì Glastonbury actually feels more like its own nation 
state operating independently of the rest of Somerset, as if founded by some 
cider-quaffing libertarian.
