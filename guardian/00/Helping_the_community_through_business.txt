When the Jew Dendi group gathers at the church in Muranga, Kenya to discuss 
money, Christina Oketch sits at the table. As chair, she is flanked by the 
secretary and the treasurer. They listen to the other women and decide the 
amounts necessary for loans, but part of Christina's job is to make sure that 
the rules are followed. When one of the members arrives late, she stands up and 
politely demands a five shillings (3p) fine. "The members decided to elect me 
as chairwoman. I am very proud to have been selected and I am happy because 
every time I ask them to do something, they obey."

In Muranga, women have to walk 3km to get water and the land is not productive 
unless they use fertilisers. It was precisely because of this that they called 
the group Jew Dendi, meaning strength in the body. "We decided on this name 
because here, life is difficult and if members do not work they will not 
achieve much. We chose it to motivate us."

A 15-minute walk through barren land leads Christina home, where she is a wife 
and a mother of four. Her husband has five children from a previous marriage 
for whom she cares as well because their mother has died. With the capital she 
got from the group, Christina started travelling to neighbouring Uganda to buy 
clothes, which she sells in the local market. "I feel that through my 
businesses, I can help my community".
