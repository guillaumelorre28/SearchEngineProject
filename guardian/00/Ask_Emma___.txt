I am 30 and still have acne on my face. My GP won't refer me to a specialist 
and doesn't appear to know how to help. What can I do? I can't afford expensive 
treatments.

Avoid fried foods, saturated fats and all stimulants (nicotine, alcohol, tea, 
coffee and chocolate). Eat lots of vegetables, but avoid eating too much fruit, 
because it has a high sugar content. Cutting out dairy foods - especially hard 
cheese and cream - can also help. To remove toxic waste from your body, drink 
lots of water, and take some exercise. Try to reduce stress - it stimulates 
increased sebum production. If there is no change after three months, have a 
food-allergy test.

 I have lots of small, flat warts on my hands. I've been told that they'll go 
over time, but it has been years now. 

Warts indicate a low immune system. The application of any topical treatments 
will only get rid of the warts permanently if the immune system is strong 
enough to overcome the virus causing them. If warts appear on certain 
reflexology or acupuncture points, this can indicate weaknesses in related 
organs, which need to be addressed. To find a therapist, call the British 
Acupuncture Council on 020-8735 0400 (Acupuncture 
<http://www.acupuncture.org.uk>), or the Association of Reflexologists on 0870 
567 3320 (Association of Reflexologists <http://www.aor.org.uk>).
