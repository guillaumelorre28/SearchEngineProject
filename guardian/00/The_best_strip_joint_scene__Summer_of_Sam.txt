New York, 1977. Richie (Adrien Brody) takes new girlfriend Ruby (Jennifer 
Esposito) to his place of employment, Male World. In the foyer, his boss 
Midnight (Michael Imperioli) sits on the phone, lightly fingering his stetson.

"What you got this time?" he mutters. "Because I heard it before from you and 
I got trouble from you - that's because you send me chicken. I don't need no 
chicken, I don't need no trouble from the law, thank you very much."

He looks up, noticing Richie. 

"Hey." 

He returns to the phone. 

"Let me get back to you, OK? I'm working, I'm working. Somebody's gotta make 
some money here."

He replaces the receiver. 

"Hell-o Richie." 

"Hey - this is Ruby." 

"Hell-o Ruby." 

"Midnight, let me do a show tonight. One show." 

"One show? I got rules, Richie, and you know the rules - five shows a day, 
seven days a week."

"I know." 

"Oh, you know. But if I break the rules for you, I'm going to have every 
crabby little punk coming up here wanting to dance every time they need a dime 
bag."

"This girl's special to me." 

Midnight places his hand on his heart. 

"Oh! Well, then you appeal to my sense of romantic. Let me see how special she 
is - "

He leans around to take a look at Ruby. 

"What colour panties you have on, honey?"
