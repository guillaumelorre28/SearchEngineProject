Running parallel to the history of dance is the history of music technology: 
software such as Cubase, Logic and Reason, and hardware like the Akai MPC-60, 
Kaoss Pads and the Yamaha DX7 have all had a hand in shaping the genre, as much 
as Stratocasters and four-tracks did for rock. One of the first boxes to define 
the sound of electronic dance music was the Roland TB-303 Bassline. Roland 
engineer Tadao Kikumoto's machine is a happy accident: not great at doing what 
it was designed to do (simulate the sound of a bass guitar), but brilliant once 
it got into the right (wrong) hands. Production stopped in 1984 because the 
target audience was disappointed with the lack of realism. But its thrilling, 
squelchy, endlessly tweakable sound was perfect for the emerging house and 
techno scene – check Phuture's Acid Tracks from 1987 – it could only have been 
written on a machine. Even though you can now replicate the 303's sound on 
inexpensive music programs, the original rarely eBays for less than £1,200.
