One night in 1981, Chicago DJ Frankie Knuckles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/frankie-knuckles> was driving through the 
city's suburbs with a friend when he saw a sign in a bar window: "We play house 
music." "Now, what's that all about?" he asked. "It means music like you're 
playing at the Warehouse," his friend replied. And that's how Knuckles realised 
he'd inadvertently invented a new genre.

Knuckles had begun his residency atÂ the westside club in 1977 at the height of 
disco fever, but by 1980 a backlash had swept the craze away. Knuckles began 
playing obscure imports and re-editing oddball disco records for maximum 
dancefloor impact. The crowd, overwhelmingly black and gay, went nuts for this 
new style, which became known as "house" as the new underground style spread to 
clubs across the city. Knuckles's and fellow pioneer Ron Hardy's merging of 
Salsoul classics with mutant disco, electro and European synth-pop paved the 
way for the first tailor-made house tracks in 1984. Six years later, Knuckles 
proudly described his creation as "disco's revenge".
