The Daily Mirror gets a good plug for its Pride of Britain awards, to be 
screened on ITV1 on Wednesday night, in today's paper with a story aboutAnt and 
Dec <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ant-and-dec> coming under fire 
while in Afghanistan to present one of the gongs. Under the headline Ant & 
Duck, the paper breathlessly recounts how the pair were "attacked by the 
Taliban" as they were waiting at Kandahar airport for a military flight. But 
don't worry, folks, the telly duo were unharmed and went on to present the 
award to British army's Medical Emergency Response Team. In these times of 
celebrity overload, it seems that even the Afghan conflict can only find its 
way on to the front pages of the tabloids if there is a famous face or two 
involved.
