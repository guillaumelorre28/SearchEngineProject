One of the joys of autumn is the arrival of figs. I love to celebrate this 
glorious fruit simply, by eating them with the skins still on. But they are 
also wonderful paired with smoked duck.

(Serves 2)
1 smoked duck breast
4 spring onions
1 bunch watercress, washed and torn
1 red apple
4 figs
100ml olive oil
½ tsp dijon mustard
25ml red wine vinegar
Rock salt and pepper

Remove excess duck fat by laying the knife flat between the skin and meat and 
running it down the breast. Cut the fat into strips and set aside. Cut the duck 
into thin slices across the breast.

Slice the spring onions and put them into a large bowl with the watercress. 
Quarter the apple, remove the core and slice thinly. Add the pieces to the 
salad.

Cut the figs into quarters and leave to one side.

Warm a pan under a high heat, add the duck fat and fry until crispy. Remove 
strips and drain on to greaseproof paper.

Whisk the oil, mustard and vinegar until emulsified to a vinaigrette.

Add the duck and figs to the salad and dress. Add salt and pepper to taste and 
toss together. Finish with the crispy fat on top and serve with crusty bread.
