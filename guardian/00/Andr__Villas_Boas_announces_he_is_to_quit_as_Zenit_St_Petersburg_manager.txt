André Villas-Boas <https://www.theguardian.com/football/andre-villas-boas> has 
said he will resign as Zenit St Petersburg’s manager at the end of the season 
after he was blocked from doing so in the summer.

The former Chelsea and Tottenham manager won the Russian Premier League with 
Zenit last season

.

The 37 year-old said on Zenit’s website: “At the end of the last season the 
club offered me the chance to extend my contract, but I refused this offer and 
at the end of this season I will leave my post.

“We did not undertake the work during the transfer window that we had expected 
and the squad is limited. It has not been strengthened with the exception of 
those players who came at the start of the transfer window. The limit on 
foreign players has changed.

“Even despite this we will carry on working and we need to get points to catch 
those who are in front of us, while we will also try to be successful in the 
Champions League.”

Zenit lie third in the table after seven games of the season, six points 
behind CSKA.
