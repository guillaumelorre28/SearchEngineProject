We are senior professionals with many years of practice, management, education 
and research experience in child protection nationally and internationally. We 
are very concerned that the government consultation, launched with a very short 
period of only six weeks, intends that all children's social work services in 
England, including child protection, be opened up to the market and without 
regulation. The only exception is adoption services.

England has one of the most successful child protection systems in the world. 
This is based on strong accountability, stability, continuity, good local 
partnership working across professionals and agencies, and with experienced and 
committed professionals and leadership. The intention that private sector 
organisations such as G4S,Serco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sercogroup>, Atos and others should be 
able to run child protection services causes considerable concern.

Their track record elsewhere has hardly been unblemished in providing Olympics 
security, over-claiming payments for tagging offenders, misreporting on GP 
out-of hours contracts, and delaying and denying disability benefits (Reformers 
renew call for G4S and Serco ban 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/13/call-for-serco-and-g4s-to-be-barred-from-prison-contracts#history-link-box>
, 13 May). Child protection is much too important to be exposed to their 
fickleness and failings.
