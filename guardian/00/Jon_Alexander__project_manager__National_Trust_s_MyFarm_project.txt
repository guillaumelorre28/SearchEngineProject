Jon is the project manager for the National Trust's MyFarm project, seeking to 
recruit 10,000 'farmers' (no experience necessary) to help run the Wimpole Farm 
in Cambridgeshire. Jon's background is in advertising and brand innovation, but 
he abandoned this in 2010 to pursue the MyFarm concept, excited by the 
opportunity to use digital media to facilitate a connection with real, big 
issues while still having some fun. Â He won the inaugural Ashridge Sustainable 
Innovation Award in 2009 for his work on the new meaning of value, is part of a 
blog community on the future of the creative industries at
