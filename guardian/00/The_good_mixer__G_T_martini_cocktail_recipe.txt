So simple, so delicious, and a neat twist on the trad G&T. You’ll need to make 
the reduced tonic in advance, but it’s a cinch. Per serving:

50ml reduced tonic
50ml gin (I’d use Boodles <http://www.boodlesgin.com> for this)
10ml fresh lime juice
1 twist lime zest, to garnish

To make reduced tonic, put 500ml tonic in a pan and simmer on a low heat until 
reduced by half. You’ll be left with tonic essence, basically, and it keeps in 
the fridge for a few weeks.

Shake the liquid ingredients over ice, double-strain into a chilled martini 
glass and serve with the lime.
