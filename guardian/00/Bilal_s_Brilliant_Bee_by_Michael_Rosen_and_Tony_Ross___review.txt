I really, really enjoyed Bilal’s Brilliant Bee. I’ve read Choosing Crumble by 
Michael Rosen before and thought he was a very good author.

I liked how an ordinary boy who always got bullied turned out to be famous 
after being on the quiz show, “What’s what? Win the Lot!” Bumble the Bee was 
great - he was very clever and he helped Bilal.

My favourite character was Bilal’s grandmother, Nanu because she was very 
supportive of Bilal and told him he could do anything, particularly inventing 
and imagining. The illustrations reminded me of Quintin Blake’s and I really 
liked them.


And those are all of the reasons I enjoyed Bilal’s Brilliant Bee!
