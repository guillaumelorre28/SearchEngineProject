Bah. Lists: can't live with them, can't live without them (you can, actually, 
but it would probably be duller). I've already done my shift with Granta in 
choosing the Best of Young British, so, judges, please take the following 
suggestions with a pinch of salt. Apart from the 20 names below, Zadie Smith 
may well appear again (Adam Mars-Jones,Kazuo Ishiguro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/kazuoishiguro> and AL Kennedy are, to date, 
the three writers to be featured in two lists), as may Adam Thirlwell, the only 
other of last time's bunch not to have grown too old. Other than that, I've one 
apology to make and that is to Jon McGregor (first on my list below). It 
wouldn't be quite true to say his omission last time has been bothering me for 
a decade but I'm glad to have said it now.

JON McGREGOR, 37

A wonderful writer who should surely have featured last time but for some 
reason I genuinely can't remember, didn't. He won last year's Impac award for
Even the Dogs  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/21/even-the-dogs-by-jon-mcgregor>at 
the top of the list – and I can't imagine the Granta judges overlooking this 
expert dissector of everyday life this time round. He's also versatile: a few 
months ago he wrote#MatlockMystery 
<http://storify.com/jon_mcgregor/matlockmystery>, a story in which his Twitter 
followers watched him construct a spoof mystery online and in real time.

GWENDOLINE RILEY, 33

Riley published her first novel, Cold Water 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099437154/cold-water>, 
at 22, and a decade later is working on her fifth. Last year'sOpposed Positions 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780224094238/opposed-positions>
, the story of a rootless woman, won praise from no less a writer than Anne 
Enright

EVIE WYLD, 32

Her first novel, After the Fire a Still Small Voice 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099535836/after-the-fire-a-still-small-voice>
 (2010), was an ambitious dual narrative that drew on her upbringing in 
Australia; her second,All the Birds, Singing, will tell of an Australian sheep 
farmer who relocates to an English hill farm. Wyld also runs the Review booshop 
in Peckham.

JOE DUNTHORNE, 30

 Joe Dunthorne. 
He got off to a good start when his first novel, Submarine 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780241955154/submarine>, 
was made into a film. His second,Wild Abandon 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780141033952/wild-abandon> 
– the tragicomic story of an imploding commune in Wales – won the Encore award. 
He's also part of writers' collectiveAisle 16 <http://www.aisle16.co.uk/people/>
 and helped to set up Nick Hornby's literacy project,The Ministry of Stories 
<http://www.ministryofstories.org/>.

SAM BYERS, 33

 Sam Byers. 
UEA graduate Byers might be the list's unpublished writer, though only just – 
his debut,Idiopathy 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780007412082/idiopathy>, 
described as a novel of love, narcissism and ailing cattle, comes out in April.

EDWARD HOGAN, 32

 Edward Hogan. 
His two novels, Blackmoor 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781847370983/blackmoor> and 
The Hunger Trace 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781847391551/the-hunger-trace>
 – its title taken from a falconry term – are set in Derbyshire and 
distinguished by the author's powerful, original way of writing about the 
natural world.

STUART EVERS, 36

His first book was a collection of short stories, the intriguingly titled and 
well reviewedTen Stories About Smoking. He followed it last year with a novel, 
If This is Home 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781447217404/if-this-is-home>
, which explored the lure of America for young men from dreary English towns.

NED BEAUMAN, 27

 Ned Beauman. 
Boxer, Beetle, Beauman's debut novel, was shortlisted for the Guardian First 
Book award; his second, the equally audacious and genre-bustingThe 
Teleportation Accident 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780340998427/the-teleportation-accident>
, was longlisted for the Man Booker prize.

COURTTIA NEWLAND, 39

 Courttia Newland. 
His first novel, The Scholar 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780349108445/the-scholar-a-west-side-story>
, came out in 1997 and he has since written short stories and crime novels.The 
Gospel According to Cane 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781846591570/the-gospel-according-to-cane>
, about a woman whose baby was kidnapped decades ago, has just been published.

STEPHEN KELMAN, 36

In Pigeon English 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781408810637/pigeon-english>
, Kelman took a risk by having his first novel narrated by a Ghanaian boy who 
had just arrived in London. It paid off; the book, inspired by the murder of 
Damilola Taylor, was shortlisted for the Booker.

SAMANTHA HARVEY, 38

 Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Observer 
Her first novel, The Wilderness 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099526537/the-wilderness>
, was a powerful and subtle exploration of the effects of Alzheimer's. Her 
second,All is Song 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780224096324/all-is-song>, 
is an equally delicate depiction of family relationships.

ADAM FOULDS, 38

 Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer 
The multi-award-winning Foulds is a poet as well as a novelist, which partly 
explains why the subject of his extraordinary second novel,The Quickening Maze 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099532446/the-quickening-maze>
, was John Clare. It was shortlisted for the Booker and won the Encore award.

REBECCA HUNT, 32

 Rebecca Hunt. 
It takes chutzpah to make the protagonist of your first novel a talking dog – 
especially if he's the realisation of the black dog of depression that stalked 
Winston Churchill. Yet in 2010'sMr Chartwell 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780141049878/mr-chartwell>, 
it worked.

ROSS RAISIN, 33

 Ross Raisin. 
Yorkshire-born Raisin burst on to the scene with God's Own Country, a 
linguistically striking story of the isolation of rural life. He followed it 
withWaterline, set in Clydeside and London.

NAOMI ALDERMAN, 38

Not only has Alderman written three novels – Disobedience, The Lessons and 
last year'sThe Liars' Gospel 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/26/liars-gospel-naomi-alderman-review>

Hall is a hugely accomplished writer, author of novels that include Haweswater 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780571209309/haweswater>, 
The Electric Michelangelo 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780571219308/the-electric-michelangelo>
 andHow to Paint a Dead Man 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780571224906/how-to-paint-a-dead-man>
. Without wishing to jinx her chances, she might be the nearest this list has 
to a dead cert.

FRANCESCA SEGAL, 32

 Francesca Segal. 
Her first novel, The Innocents 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099569527/the-innocents>
, took its inspiration from Edith Wharton's New York but located itself firmly 
in Jewish north London, and won the Costa First Novel award in the process.

HELEN OYEYEMI, 28

She was still at school when she wrote her first novel, The Icarus Girl 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780747578864/the-icarus-girl>
, which drew on the folklore of Nigeria, where she was born. Her fourth,Mr Fox 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fairytales/9780330536264/mr-fox>, 
continues her fascination with fairytale.

OWEN SHEERS, 38

<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780571229642/resistance>,

mentioning his time as artist in residence for the Welsh Rugby Union.
