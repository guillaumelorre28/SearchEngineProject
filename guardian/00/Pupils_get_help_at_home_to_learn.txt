Learning support adviser Diana Masitla works in five schools within her 
community, making home visits to the most vulnerable pupils. She was employed 
in January by the Siyanakekela Project, a joint initiative of the David Rattray 
Foundation and MIET Africa. The position has not only lifted her from 
depression and unemployment but provides a support for children away from the 
classroom.

"If the educators in the schools find some of the learners need support, I am 
there to provide it," Masitla explains. Keeping an eye out for unfed, ill or 
poorly clothed children, teachers consult Masitla, who then goes home with the 
child to discuss the issues with the family. Unlike many of the teachers, she 
is local to the area and so has a greater insight into its problems.

One of the most prevalent problems for orphans, is that their birth 
certificates are missing. These must be produced if the children are to receive 
an orphan grant or any medical treatment. Children who are not orphans often 
have this problem too, as their parents may refuse to co-operate by hiding 
information. Masitla blames this on their own lack of education.

Her role reveals the frustrating clash between private cultural beliefs and 
educational efforts that are extending beyond academic education, working to 
overcome deep-seated problems in theÂ community.

The parents, she says "don't want their health problems to be known ... you 
find that the child is sick ... they don't want to listen ... in health 
situations, they don't want to give me the information."
