1. At the hardware store, you are told that 1 will cost you 50p, 12 will cost 
£1 and the price of 144 is £1.50. What are you buying?

2. Reconstruct the following long division:

SOLUTIONS

1. You are buying house numbers.

2. Let’s first clarify the terminology. The number doing the dividing is the 
divisor, the number being divided is the dividend, and the answer is the 
quotient, as I have marked in below.

 Step 1 
Now, let’s refresh ourselves wth how long division works: each line marked A 
above is a multiple of the divisor. Consider the top one. We subtract this 
number from the number above it to give us another number, to which we append a 
digit, and then subtract a multiple of the divisor. If, however, we cannot 
subtract a multiple of the divisor (because the number with a single digit 
appended is smaller than the divisor), then we put a 0 in the quotient in the 
space directly above the appended digit, and then append a second number. As 
you can see in both lines B, two digits have been appended, which means that in 
both cases there must be a zero in the quotient. So we know that the quotient 
must be of the formx080x.

 Step 2 
Now, we also know that 8 times the divisor is equal to the number circled in 
red, which has three digits. We know that the final digit of the quotient times 
the divisor is equal to the number circled in green, which has four digits. So 
the final digit of the quotient must be larger than 8, so it is 9.

 Step 3 
From above, 8 times the divisor is a three-digit number, which means that the 
divisor must be less than 125, since 8 x 125 = 1000, which is a four digit 
number. So the divisor is 124 or less.

Now imagine the first digit of the quotient is 7. Then 7 times the divisor is 
the number in blue, which has 3 digits. But since the divisor is 124 or less, 
the number in blue must be 7 x 124 = 868 or less. But if it was 868, then when 
subtracted from the first four digits of the dividend, you would get a three 
digit number, not a two digit number (marked orange). So the first digit of the 
quotient cannot be 7 and likewise we can eliminate all digits less than 7. But 
we can also eliminate 9, since we know from above that 9 times the quotient has 
four digits, not three! So the first digit must be 8, and the quotient is 80809.

If the divisor was 123, then the dividend (which is 80809 x 123 = 9939507) has 
only seven digits. So the divisor must be larger than 123. We already know it 
is 124 or less. So it is 124. The dividend now works out as 10020316, and the 
reconstructed long division looks like:
