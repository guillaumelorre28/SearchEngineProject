 has released her video for the track Obama, along with a statement about the 
incarceration ofChelsea Manning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning> that is addressed to the 
US president.

In the text accompanying the video on YouTube, the British musician urges 
Obama to end the sentence of Manning, a former US soldier who is serving 35 
years in prison for leaking state secrets.

“Please let Chelsea Manning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning> out of prison,” she 
writes. “Recognise her tremendous sacrifice, and her vulnerability. With Trump 
incoming, if you leave Chelsea in prison, she will never see the light of day, 
or worse.”

In her message, Anohni <https://www.theguardian.com/music/anohni> adds: “If 
you leave Chelsea Manning in prison for whistle-blowing, you send the final 
message to our nation that the Obama administration brutally punished moral 
courage in these unforgiving United States.”

The song, taken from this year’s Mercury nominated Hopelessness, is a stark 
description of the musician’s fluctuating relationship with the president. It 
begins by describing her support for the Obama, before condemning him for 
“punishing the whistle blowers / those who tell the truth”.

Following the US election, and fearing the repercussions of Donald Trump’s 
presidency,Manning has appealed to Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/chelsea-manning-appeals-obama-trump>
 to commute her sentence and release her from military prison so she can have 
her “first chance to live a real, meaningful life”.

Anohni concludes: 

She has suffered enough, President Obama.
She poses no threat.
Show us the heart of the Obama administration now.
