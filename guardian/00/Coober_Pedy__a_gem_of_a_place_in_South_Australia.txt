There is such a thing as too many dappled piazzas. Too much tapenade. Such a 
thing as too much everything. Look around, see how many things there are. Too 
damned many. It’s an experiment for rats. But we see no irony in trading it for 
another ruckus abroad and calling it a holiday. The essential test of freedom 
asks how far in any direction we can move from where we now sit without 
deviating or meeting obstacles. I’m going to say 20 metres, tops. And the 
masterpiece of our containment, if we ponder it? We think it flows from free 
choices.

 Coober Pedy has been celebrating its centenary this year. Photograph: Alamy 
This year marked the centenary of a favourite antidote of mine. A dreamer’s 
place in the middle of nowhere, it’s easy enough to get to these days – 
although bear in mind that every resident I know is a visitor who never went 
home. When I ask what keeps them around, they say freedom, and I get it. But I 
also know what made them stop in the first place – apart from 360° horizons, a 
camaraderie peculiar to outposts, and clouds of galaxies in the night sky – and 
it was a chance, with no more than their hands and some luck, to get suddenly, 
stupidly rich.

Coober Pedy – Kupa Piti in the indigenous Arabana language, meaning “White man 
in a hole” – lies in the state of South Australia to the south-east of a desert 
the size of France and Germany put together. White men started digging holes 
here after 14-year-old Willie Hutchison, minding a gold-prospectors’ campsite 
one Monday in February 1915, wandered off and found opals. It’s still the 
biggest opal find in the world by a huge margin: some gems are as close as 
eight inches below ground, and some are even found lying on the surface.

The only issue for prospectors was desert heat and cold, so they built 
dwellings underground as well, where sandstone holds the temperature at about 
24C year-round. The town now also has underground hotels and even churches. The 
only issue left for builders looking to extend their premises is opal: one 
miner who set out to dig a spare bedroom saw colour glinting from the walls of 
his first attempt so decided to mine it and try again, but hit opal on his next 
try, and his next, till he ended up with 10 rooms.

 An opal drilling rig forms the welcome sign for Coober Pedy. Photograph: Alamy 
Coober Pedy isn’t the first place you’d think of to visit in South Australia, 
given the state’s thousands of miles of beaches, vineyards and ocean-front 
capital, Adelaide. But it’s a modern tonic, an elastic snap back to a reality 
where labels can’t help you, where you’re alone with the sum of your foibles on 
a curious planet. Plus this is real Australia, the netherworld we hoped for, 
one that no amount of sushi on Sydney harbour can explain.

On my Regional Express <http://www.rex.com.au/> flight to the outback there 
are no geologists or suits among the handful of passengers. Unlike gold or 
diamonds, nothing can help pinpoint precious opal. “It’s either there or it’s 
not,” said one miner. So as the plane descends, a woodworm colony grows beneath 
it of human-sized holes beside piles of excavated rubble. Opal is a democratic 
gem. There’s no industrial mining here; you have as much chance as anyone.

A man comes out to meet the turboprop. Shamil, from India, also turns out to 
be the driver for theDesert Cave Hotel <http://www.desertcave.com.au/> – a 
fail-safe airport shuttle. Of the places to stay here, chosen according to how 
much like a prospector you want to feel, the Desert Cave is the sort of place 
where you might imagine you are an international gem buyer. From a varnished 
sandstone room, I set off to see what’s new in town. For one thing, the 
4,000-strong population of more than 40 nationalities now has a council. A road 
has been paved. ButJohn’s Pizza Bar <http://johnspizzabarandrestaurant.com.au/> 
still makes pizza the way it was made back when pizza was pizza and rocket was 
something you fired into space. The drive-in movies are enjoying their 50th 
year, and still screen the warning: “Patrons: explosives are not to be brought 
into this theatre.”

 Visitors ‘noodling’ or fossicking for opals. Photograph: Alamy 
I also see that “noodling” has been on the rise. The town is an ant-farm of 
mounds caused by digging or blasting, and because the serious prospector is 
after whole seams, he sacrifices lone gems. Noodling is the Zen pursuit of 
“fossicking” through that rubble for flashes of brilliance. Easy enough to 
spot, opals are the only gems with more than one colour, and their unearthly 
sparkle shows in the rough. Noodling is no idle game, though: bright opals 
fetch more per carat than diamonds. One tip I hear is to watch where local 
indigenous women noodle – they have a sense.

As for a sense of where this whole Priscilla-Queen-of-the-Desert-meets-Mad-Max 
caboodle started – both films were shot around here – there are glimpses. While 
digging an extension in the 1960s, someone broke through the wall of a sealed 
underground complex dating from 1916. Part mine, part home, the network is now 
a walk-through exhibit, intact right down to the opal shining from the walls.

 Uncut opals at the Old Timers Opal Mine. Photograph: Alamy 
Trevor Berry, a one-time psychiatric nurse still on holiday from the 1990s, 
now runs the Old Timers Mine (oldtimersmine.com <http://www.oldtimersmine.com/>
) like an enthusiast, and soon reminds me that opal isn’t the main story here, 
just a damn good excuse. Among the artefacts proudly displayed in his cave is a 
letter from the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, confirming 
reciprocal rights with the Coober Pedy Golf Club – the only such rights in the 
world. Berry sells tees packaged with squares of turf, the course here being 
desert; and glowing balls can be used at night when temperatures and flies are 
more agreeable. This might seem very odd, but not when you consider that there 
is an 850-mile-long, 18-holegolf <http://www.nullarborlinks.com/> course 
<http://www.nullarborlinks.com/> on the Nullarbor Plain, south-west of here.

Nothing here seems plausible or implausible. Without reference to a conforming 
standard, whatever could happen can happen, and does. Everyone’s laws of 
probability have abandoned the main flock; or there’s just not a main flock to 
follow. Then add opal fever. Berry keeps a noodling pit: watch kids’ eyes focus 
like puppies who’ve spotted bones.

Still, I’m not here for opals. Desert fever strikes me harder: the place is a 
gateway to relentless space. Lit corner-to-corner like a studio, the outback 
isn’t isolating but strangely intimate and close. You feel you can touch 
distant views with your hands, stand like the Petit Prince on an empty planet. 
Daesh can sod off, the government can sod off, the news can sod off.

But it’s best if your wingman doesn’t sod off, and the place offers a logical 
if unexpected companion for desert roaming – the outback postman. Peter Rowe 
arrived in 1967 on his way to Alice Springs and, like everyone else, is still 
here. You can ride with his mail run (mailruntour.com <http://mailruntour.com/>
) to cattle stations and food stops at William Creek and Oodnadatta. With 
ranches the size of Slovenia, it’s a 12-hour run; but on top of expert 
knowledge, Rowe is smart, easy company. “Know how to make a million mining 
opal?” he gibes. “Start with two million and stop when you get to one.”

There’s a theme-park vibe to the outback here, Desert 101, with some 
moonscape, some red dust, desert scrub, and gibber plains to infinity. The 
world’s longest manmade structure passes here too, the 3,448-mile Dog Fence, 
built to keep dingoes out of the south-east. As you stand scanning for 
crestfallen dingoes, two things begin to dawn: one is that your phone still has 
a signal. Then you notice that some of those things on the ground are 
seashells. The terrain makes sudden sense: it’s an ocean bed. Not only that, as 
Rowe explains, the evenly spaced stones around here were dropped by melting 
glaciers. Every footfall you make could be the first human footfall. Every 
shell you lift was left by the sea. And some areopalised 
<http://australianopalcentre.com/opalised-fossils/>, as are some marine 
fossils. A beachcomber’s party, 120 million years from the beach.

Before flying back to the rat experiment, I glean one final angle on the 
“queen of all gemstones”. The Desert Cave Hotel turns out to have a fine dining 
eatery, Umberto’s, like something from a David Lynch movie, 56 steps up into a 
sandstone hill, with muzak. There’s premium whisky at the bar, the wine list 
has legs, and I spot Yanni Athanasiadis, the go-to man for serious opals. He 
owns the Umoona Opal Mine and Museum (umoonaopalmine.com.au 
<http://www.umoonaopalmine.com.au/>) under the ground next door, by far the 
slickest such complex I’ve seen: it’s a museum not only covering mining but 
outback and indigenous Australian life and art, too, with what must be 50 
metres of rough and polished opals and jewellery for sale.

Over barramundi (Asian sea bass) and wine, Athanasiadis outlines his plan to 
lure visitors to remote Manguri. Then we drift back to opal fever – two flights 
a week full of banknotes for the town’s only bank, one man’s £18m find – and as 
he speaks, still wearing the boyish smile he must have landed with, I pick up a 
nostalgia more common to 1990s East Berlin. It seems there were good old days 
here. He remembers them as an extension of his family’s table in Thessaloniki, 
15 people eating, drinking, cavorting and mining day and night, throwing the 
dice of their lives.

Now he feels like one of the last of a breed: “I’m amazed, but it seems young 
people today would prefer to get a big mining job, without risk, than try their 
luck.”

But is there still plenty of opal around?

“Nobody can say that the biggest find isn’t still out there,” he says. “If a 
few people turned up here who didn’t know a thing and asked where should they 
dig, I’d leave my job and show them. That’s what this town was all about.”

The cost of a Precious Stones Prospecting Permit in the opal fields is less 
than £40. According to Trevor Berry, foreigners with a work visa are entitled 
to try their luck.

So you in your gap year, you with a sticky divorce, you with urban fatigue … 
bye-bye. Shout the boys a drink for me.
