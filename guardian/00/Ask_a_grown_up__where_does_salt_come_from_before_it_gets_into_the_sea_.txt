There are, on average, 35g of salt in every litre of seawater. It gets there 
because rain continuously washes it off the land as it erodes the rocks. Salt 
builds up in the oceans and, because it is very soluble, it tends to stay there 
a long time.

Three hundred years ago, scientists such as Edmond Halley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/nov/08/edmond-halley-birthday-google-doodle>
 (who predicted the comet named for him) thought the oceans must be getting 
saltier, and that if you measured the amount of salt and estimated the rate at 
which it came off the land, you could work out the age of the Earth. But this 
method does not work because salt does in fact sometimes come out of solution 
and go back into rock form, very slowly over geological time. For example, 
there is a thick layer of salt under the floor of the Mediterranean, because 
six million years ago it was cut off at the Strait of Gibraltar and evaporated. 
In general, the oceans' average salt content is in equilibrium and does not 
change over time.
