Perhaps. Acne <https://www.theguardian.com/society/acne> is an inflammatory 
skin condition that causes spots on the face, neck, shoulders and upper back 
which is said to affect some 80% of people at some point in their lives. The 
spots can vary in size and colour; black, white, red and yellow zits all 
qualify. At its worst, acne can result in cysts beneath the skin's surface 
which, if ruptured, can cause scarring.

How does it happen?

It is usually triggered by a hormone imbalance that causes tiny oil-producing 
glands to generate a surplus of sebum (natural oils) which combine with dead 
skin cells to block hair follicles.

Is it just a teen thing?

Although acne typically begins during adolescence it can afflict adults too. 
Also, while most sufferers find that symptoms quickly disappear, acne has 
sometimes been known to last for decades.

How is acne treated?

There is no magic "cure" as such, but a plethora of treatments can be obtained 
over the counter, containing anti-bacterial agents to alleviate the symptoms 
and prevent spots from spreading. If symptoms persist, contact your GP.

Am I going to die?

Not from acne, no. But you should be aware that the drug Roaccutane, used by 
13 million people worldwide to treat more severe cases of acne, has been linked 
to depression and suicide.

Bursting to squeeze?

Be careful - squeezing spots can make matters worse. For the Traffic Light

Acne myths

Contrary to popular opinion, acne is neither contagious nor the result of 
eating fatty or greasy foods. Oh yes, and blackhead spots are not dirt-ridden - 
in fact, they get their colour from an excess of skin pigment.
