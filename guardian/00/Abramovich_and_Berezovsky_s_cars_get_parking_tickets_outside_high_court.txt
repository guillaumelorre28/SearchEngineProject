Parking wardens have handed tickets to drivers ferrying Roman Abramovich and 
Boris Berezovsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/04/pass-notes-boris-berezovsky> to 
and from the high court after limousines were spotted waiting on single yellow 
lines.

Berezovsky is suing the owner of Chelsea Football Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/06/berezovsky-abramovich-high-court>
 for more than $5bn (£3.2bn). He claims that Abramovich "betrayed" him after 
Berezovsky fell out with the Kremlin and fled to Britain in 2000, forcing him 
to sell his share in the Russian oil company Sibneft for a knockdown price.

Council civil enforcement officers swooped on Abramovich's silver Mercedes 
people carrier and Berezovsky's black Maybach in a side street outside the 
court building in centralLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>.

Wardens from the City of London wrote out tickets and photographed the 
vehicles after the hearing concluded on Tuesday.

Drivers are allowed to load and unload and pick up or drop off on a single 
yellow line – but not wait. Motorists who breach the rule in central London 
face a fine of at least £65.
