Australia is being challenged to speak up on behalf of Malaysia’s opposition 
leader as he faces “a travesty of justice” and the prospect of prison this 
month.

Anwar Ibrahim <https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-ibrahim> is appealing 
against a highly controversial sodomy conviction, and one of his lawyers has 
been charged with sedition for saying the scandal is politically motivated.

Anwar, too, is under further investigation, accused of making seditious 
comments in a political speech.

His 28 October appeal against the sodomy conviction may spark political 
tensions inMalaysia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia>.

On Friday he met the independent senator Nick Xenophon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon> in Jakarta. Xenophon 
was detained and deported when he tried to visit Anwar in Kuala Lumpur last 
year.

Xenophon said if Australia was any kind of friend to Malaysia, it would speak 
up.

“This is a travesty of justice,” he told reporters in Jakarta.

“It feels like Anwar has more charges against him than Muhammad Ali has had 
punches. It is a very serious issue.”

Anwar agreed Malaysian authorities, “on direction from the government”, were 
determined to put him behind bars.”

In his 2011 speech, he says, he said the words “fight the evil government”. 
That was now being considered sedition.

“I convey my appreciation to senator Nick Xenophon and my friends here who 
conveyed their concern for me,” he said.

Xenophon said he also remained concerned about the voter irregularities he had 
wanted to examine last year when he was detained.

“I think unofficially it’s expected that the real vote was much greater for 
the Malaysian opposition,” he said.

“So, this is the man who should be the prime minister of Malaysia today.”
