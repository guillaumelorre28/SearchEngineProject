. Whether its ice skating , rollerskating or skateboarding, having a character 
travel around on tiny wheels/blades can add a certain speedy excitement to a 
film.

Here are a few of our favourite cinematic skaters - but can you think of any 
others? Let us know in the comment thread below.


1. Back to the Future

“What’s that thing he’s on?” “It’s a board with wheels.” According to BTTF’s 
slightly revisionist history, Marty McFly invented skateboarding in 1955 when 
he vandalised a child’s homemade scooter in order to evade some thugs. A few 
days later he went on to invent rock and roll. It was a busy week for Marty.

2. The Simpsons

This scene combines two of conservative middle America’s favourite bêtes 
noires - nudity and kids on skateboards – for a masterclass in low-level 
juvenile delinquency from Bart Simpson.

4. Modern Times

This clip from Charlie Chaplin’s 1936 film packs in more wit, tension and 
excitement in two minutes than some films manage in 90.

5. Prayer of the Rollerboys


In the late 80s a bunch of film producers got it into their heads that 
rollerblading was going to be the next big thing – and henceforth Prayer of the 
Rollerboys was born. Corey Haim plays Griffin, a pizza delivery boy recruited 
by the cops to infiltrate a band of white-supremacist rollerbladers.
