Stepping out from under scaffolding, Sihle Buthelezi, 21, surveys the 
structure that he and his team have almost completed. Trained and accredited, 
this is Buthelezi's third building project with the David Rattray Foundation 
and through his commitment and good leadership skills, he is now team leader.

Built of rammed earth, a technique using a soil, clay and sand mixture taken 
directly from the ground with a small cement stabiliser, the building is 
self-regulating: cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The buildings have 
culturally appropriate rounded edges and include rooms almost twice the size of 
a government regulated classroom, costing half the price.

The project employs members of the local community – mixed-sex teams of 15-20 
people at a time – to erect school structures: a prerequisite of the community 
building project. Each worker receives skills training and an income for the 
duration of the project, a sum which rises with experience.

Providing the local community with a direct cash injection and lasting skills, 
the project is encouraging the community to use easily accessible materials for 
their own means.

Nombuso is a site supervisor, now on her third project. By the age of 23, 
Nombuso had resigned herself to a future of poverty. "Why should it matter if I 
catch HIV?" she once asked a neighbour.

But now she has taken a course on fumigation, meaning that she can provide a 
solution to the termite problem inside her homestead and others – and earn R150 
fumigating other houses. With further plans to open up her own hair salon, she 
is an inspiration to her community.
