, which won her a César award for best female performance in 2015.

There’s a sense of political defeat right now, not just in France but across 
Europe

Playing Dr Jenny Davin in The Unknown Girl, you’ve clearly absorbed the body 
language of a GP – we see you taking pulses, filling in forms, doing a lot of 
routine daily stuff.
That felt like the basic minimum I had to do. The Dardennes have a certain way 
of working – you rehearse all the scenes for a month on the actual locations. I 
trained with a woman who taught me the right way to hold a stethoscope, give 
injections, the lot. If you could tell I was having trouble getting such and 
such a movement right, that would screw up the whole language of the film.

Watch the trailer for The Unknown Girl.

It’s very much an existential story. We know the doctor is having a crisis of 
conscience, we see how she responds and we see her at work. Otherwise, we know 
nothing about her. Did you need to know her backstory, the way a lot of actors 
do?
No. That approach always seems so 19th-century to me – constructing a 
character as if they were a real person. For me, it’s much more important to 
say: this character is me placed in a particular situation, and it’s that 
situation that makes the character exist. She doesn’t exist outside the film. 
For me, she absolutely isn’t a hero and I knew I shouldn’t make her a hero. 
She’s just someone – she could be anyone – who suddenly wakes up to things. 
It’s about the minimum of humanity that can affect any of us – the fact of 
waking up to the needs of others.

The Dardenne brothers: ‘Attacks on Obama to democratise healthcare are 
pathetic’ – video interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/27/the-dardenne-brothers-attacks-on-obama-to-democratise-healthcare-are-pathetic-video-interview>
This year, you appeared in a film that was very controversial in France – 
Bertrand Bonello’sNocturama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/09/nocturama-review-bertrand-bonello-paris-terrorism-toronto-film-festival->
, about a young terrorist cell. You play a woman who witnesses the aftermath of 
a bombing and says: “Sooner or later, it had to happen.” What is that line 
about?
It’s not for me to explain – it’s not my line, it’s the film’s. But for me, 
the film is saying that things don’t come out of nowhere, they always emerge 
out of some past friction. In France right now, it’s really difficult to talk 
about that. It’s a year since [the attacks of] 13 November, and everyone gets 
really stressed talking about that because they feel they have to take sides. 
Perhaps now it’s a question of being able to think clearly again.

We’re talking just a stone’s throw from the Bataclan. How has life changed in 
Paris in the past year on an everyday level?
There are soldiers everywhere, the power of the police is crazy. There’s 
something really wrong about the current state of emergency. They can search 
your bag at any time, and they say: “If you have nothing to hide, what’s the 
problem?” But that’s the real danger – imposing a way of talking about things 
which claims to be rational, but that’s really a collective mindlessness. 
There’s a sense of political defeat right now, not just in France but across
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> – people call you a 
dreamer if you try to think about anything other than pursuing the boundless 
expansion of capitalism.

You’ve just appeared in a Belgian film, made another in German and acted on 
stage in Harold Pinter’sOld Times. Do you feel as European as much as French?
I never thought about it much before working abroad. I never thought of myself 
as French beyond the fact that I speak French. I have an attachment to my 
nation without necessarily being a patriot, it’s just my culture – nothing to 
do with walking around with a baguette under my arm. But our history in France 
is about lots of different histories coming together, and when I see a magazine 
cover with some shitty politician, some white guy proclaiming, “MyFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> – Without Islam”, that really 
depresses me.

I like to think if you do things sincerely, it’ll connect with people. For me, 
[coming out] was simple, no big deal

It’s always traditional to ask young European actors when they’re going to 
make their first Hollywood film. But judging from your interviews, you couldn’t 
be less interested in that.
It’s not my thing. People say: “Oh, you’ve got to reach the maximum number of 
people…” What’s the difference if I reach  3 million people, or 20 people, or 
three? The great thing is when teenagers say to me: “Wow, that really made me 
want to see this, or read that, or do that for myself.” That’s what really gets 
me.

You’ve just shot a film in which you play an activist in the early years of 
the direct action group Act Up [Aids Coalition To Unleash Power]. And when you 
came out on stage at the César awards you proclaimed your love for your 
partner, director Céline Sciamma. Do you hope this will also inspire your 
young viewers?
That’s possible, but for me it’s about the whole thing. I like to think if you 
do things sincerely, it’ll connect with people. For me, [coming out] was very 
simple, really no big deal. I have to say, I’m kind of a pain in the arse – I’m 
pretty rash, I just act on instinct.

Are theatre and film very different for you?
Right now I’m doing another play, by Dennis Kelly – The Ritual Slaughter of 
Gorge Mastromas. I love theatre. For me, it’s like total acting, it’s a 
laboratory for exploring the possibilities of performance. A lot of cinema 
actors feel awkward about themselves – we know we’re really not that great, and 
theatre gives you a chance to work on yourself. The one thing they can’t take 
away from me is my stage work – it’s smaller, it’s more modest, but it belongs 
to me.

France probably has more female film-makers than anywhere else in the world, 
yet French cinema still abounds with stereotyped female roles. Is that a 
problem for you?
I try not to make those films. Recycling cliches is a sign that a film lacks 
freedom, lacks courage. I like films that are in revolt against the previous 
generation. It’s a question of saying: “This is the world we live in, this is 
how it is” – and maybe saying it in a way that’s like screaming out loud. Just 
following the same old codes is a kind of submission. It’s like, “Thanks for 
leaving the world exactly as it is so I can carry on telling the same old 
boring stories.”
