Istanbul, Memories of a City, Orhan Pamuk
Poignant, lyrical childhood memoir from Turkey's foremost writer that brings 
the monuments, dilapidated Ottoman villas, backstreets and waterways of the 
anarchic, unusual city of his birth brilliantly to life. One of his earlier 
works, Black Book, is a fictional evocation of Istanbul in the repressive 
mid-1980s, a twisted detective novel that tackles the question of Turkey's 
cultural identity and reveals the city to be complex and crumbling.
 Faber and Faber, £9.99

A Fez of the Heart, Jeremy Seal
A wry, lively quest for the heart of a country by way of the history of a hat 
that symbolises Turkey's cultural fault line. Not so much a book about headgear 
as an eccentric, entertaining portrait of a contradictory country culturally 
and spiritually at odds with itself, which reveals the tensions of Turkish life.
Picador, £7.99

Turkish Coast Through Writers' Eyes, Various
Excellent anthology of classical and contemporary writings, from the Odyssey 
and Plutarch to Freya Stark and Louis de Bernière, that examines the stretch of 
coast from Izmir to Antalya, covering subjects as varied as archaeological 
discovery, the march of Alexander's army, the pleasures of the hammam and 
Turkish cooking.

Rebel Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/20/rebel-land-christopher-de-bellaigue>
, Christopher de Bellaigue
Acclaimed account of a journey to Turkey's inhospitable eastern provinces to 
examine the legacy of the violent conflict between Turks, Kurds and Armenians. 
Intensely personal and rigorously researched, it throws light on a dark 
subject, sifts fact from propaganda, partisan accounts and vague oral 
histories, and allows the reader to make up their own mind.
 Bloomsbury, £8.99 

Lords of the Horizon, Jason Goodwin
A loosely chronological history of the Ottoman Empire from its swift expansion 
to protracted decline, full of cultural snapshots that illuminate a variety of 
aspects of Ottoman life, from an author also responsible for a series of 
cleverly crafted, playfully humorous novels about a crime-solving eunuch in 
1840s Istanbul.
Vintage, £8.99
