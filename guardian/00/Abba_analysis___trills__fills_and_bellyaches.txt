Tim Jonze, writing about Dancing Queen in his article on Abba (Thank you for 
the music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/10/abba-interview-bjorn-ulvaeus-frida-lyngstad>
, G2, 11 April), refers to the song's "piano trills (famously ripped off by 
Elvis Costello for Oliver's Army)". It's unlikely that Mr Costello ripped off 
the trills in Dancing Queen, because there are no trills in Dancing Queen. 
There are no trills in Oliver's Army either. In the Abba song, the piano player 
plays a downwards glissando in the intro and then has little fills, which are 
all played in dramatic, noble octaves, reminiscent of Liberace. Not a trill to 
be heard. Similar octaves do occur in the Costello song.

• In response to Bill Hawkes (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/apr/09/praise-off-key-economics-saga>
, 10 April) and Mike Hine (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/apr/10/idle-talk-working-mens-club>
, 11 April), here's a brief analysis of The Winner Takes it All. The 
"predominant piano theme" is made up of four descents of a G flat major scale 
from different notes. The first two descents are of five notes and the 
following two of four notes. May I suggest an editorial, In praise of... the 
arpeggiated Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!?

• The descending scale figures in Abba's song are in both five- and four-note 
groups. But forget the "bean-counting". The really affecting moment in the song 
for me is the little catch in Agnetha's voice on the words "You've come to 
shake my hand".

• Whether Abba used descending scales, arpeggios or glissandos, could I ask 
Mike Hine to read Tim Jonze's G2 article, borrow a copy of Abba Gold, and then 
tell us if he really believes thatAbba <https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba> 
wrote only one memorable song?
