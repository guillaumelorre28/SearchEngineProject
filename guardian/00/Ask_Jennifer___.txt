My 15-year-old son has just finished a drug treatment course for acne which 
has not helped. Any tips?

During adolescence, as the levels of the hormone testosterone rise, it is 
common for teenage boys to develop acne. These hormonal changes usually 
coincide with blood impurities, exacerbated by junk food, saturated fats, etc, 
which can lead to an overburdened liver that can't detoxify. Taking cleansing 
herbs such as burdock, red clover and dandelion can help purify the blood 
(anti-acne formula contains these and other herbs to help the skin). To help 
scarring, Nutritone lotion includes aloe vera, tea tree and horsetail to soothe 
the skin, or try Rose Mosqueta (both available by mail order, 01273 570987).

 I suffer from multiple sclerosis, and would like to jump-start my energy 
levels. What can I do? 

When physically and mentally exhausted, the Bach flower remedy Olive helps to 
restore vitality and strength. Klamath blue green algae is a nutritional 
supplement that would be worth taking with breakfast, because it contains a 
complete nutritional profile that converts easily into energy. It includes all 
eight essential amino acids and is a good source of arginine, an amino acid 
known to support muscles, together with pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), which 
reduces fatigue by helping the adrenal glands to function more effectively 
(0800 252875).
