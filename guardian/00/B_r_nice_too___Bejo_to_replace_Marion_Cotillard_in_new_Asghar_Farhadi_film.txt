Bejo is to replaceMarion Cotillard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/marion-cotillard> in the new film from Asghar 
Farhadi, the Oscar-winning Iranian director ofA Separation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142608/separation>, according to 
Deadline

Cotillard has been forced to quit production of the untitled project due to a 
scheduling conflict. Bejo, who was nominated for an Oscar following her turn in
Michel Hazanavicius <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michel-hazanavicius>'s 
silent paean to Hollywood's golden era, will take her place opposite Tahar 
Rahim, star ofA Prophet <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129970/prophet>.

The new film, described by its director as an "emotional social thriller" with 
multiple twists in the vein of A Separation, will be Farhadi's first shot 
outside Iran, and his first in the French language. It will be filmed in and 
around Paris in October on an 11m-euro budget. Producers hope to have it ready 
for the spring, which would place it in line for a debut at theCannes film 
festival <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival>.

Farhadi's A Separation won the Oscar for best foreign language film at last 
year's Academy Awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/27/a-separation-best-foreign-language-oscar>
, where it was also nominated for best original screenplay.
