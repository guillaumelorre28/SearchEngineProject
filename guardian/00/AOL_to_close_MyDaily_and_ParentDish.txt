AOL <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/aol> is to shut the glossy women’s 
site MyDaily and parenting site ParentDish as part of a restructures to focus 
on key global brands including HuffPost, TechCrunch and Engadget.


AOL UK launched MyDaily in 2010 in a major push to target 35- to 44-year-old 
women. ParentDish was launched in 2009.


The brands do not exist in international markets and AOL has decided to scrap 
local spin-offs to focus on its four core global brands.


AOL said the new structure would mean increased investment in HuffPost UK, 
including the launch of parenting and style channels to replace MyDaily and 
ParentDish.


HuffPost UK will double its lifestyle team to six members, and its politics 
team double to four members.


In addition, the company is also hiring a video person and a social media 
writer.

Stephen Hull, editor-in-chief of HuffPost UK, said: “This investment is 
testament to the great work we have done at turning HuffPost into an 
established news brand in the UK marketplace over the last three years.

“By doubling our lifestyle and politics teams and building on our success in 
entertainment, social and video, we’re continuing to bring our valuable mix of 
hard news, thought-provoking journalism, entertainment and lifestyle content to 
our readers, while at the same time putting a renewed emphasis on coverage of 
positive stories.”
