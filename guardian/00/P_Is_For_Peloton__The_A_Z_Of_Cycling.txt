ABANDON


When a rider is forced to climb off his bike during a race because of illness 
or injury, he “abandons” and may end up in the broom wagon (see B).

AERODYNAMICS

A cyclist’s greatest enemy is wind (no, not that kind). In order to cut 
through the air with maximum efficiency you need to be as aerodynamic as 
possible in order to reduce the drag effect that wind creates. Even though you 
feel you’re moving forward, wind drag is always pulling you backwards. 
Minimising drag is the key for making a cyclist go faster, and cycling teams 
often spend a significant amount of money sending riders into wind tunnels to 
measure how aerodynamic they are. There are several key factors to making a 
cyclist more aerodynamically efficient:


Clothing – Team Sky have popularised the use of skinsuits for time trials, 
where aerodynamics are of huge importance, with individual cyclists riding 
alone against the clock, with no rider or peloton in front to take the brunt of 
the wind. Imagine going swimming fully clothed and the effort you need to 
expend to get through the water; the same is true of a cyclist passing through 
air; if less immediately appreciable. This is the reason cyclists wear clothing 
that’s as streamlined and form-fitting as possible.

Aero bars and helmet – aero bars protrude straight out from the front of the 
bike and you can rest your entire forearm on them and lie flatter on the bike, 
which helps to shrink the ‘wall’ your body presents to the wind in front: less 
wind slams into your body, and more flows over. Aero helmets work by smoothing 
the shape your head makes and improving airflow around it and make a 
significant time saving in a time trial – a small price for looking like an 
alien.

Position – this is the biggest single factor in the 
rider-plus-bike-versus-wind equation, as a cyclist’s body accounts for 70–80% 
of drag. The bigger you are, the higher that percentage goes, which is why so 
many of today’s professional cyclists are so skinny, giving them a far better 
power to weight ratio and better aerodynamics. The rule is: the flatter you can 
get on the bike, the better. Get into a good aerodynamic tuck and you’ll scythe 
through the air like a Cavendish or a Wiggins – or you’ll go faster, anyway.

BLUFF FACT > “In the decisive time trial at the end of the 1989 Tour de 
France, Greg LeMond used aero bars and an aero helmet. If Laurent Fignon had 
worn a cap he would have won the Tour.”

ALLEZ!

YOU SAY > AL (rhyme with pal) – AY (rhymes with hey!)
WHAT IT MEANS > Go! Come on! Allez is the universal expression of cycling 
encouragement, shouted from French roadsides since 1868 when Englishman James 
Moore won a 1200-metre race on 31 May 1868 at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, Paris. 
Equivalents includevai in Italian and venga in Spanish. Somewhat bizarrely, the 
Dutch and Belgian fans shout “hop” at their riders.

ALPE D’HUEZ

YOU SAY > ALP – DOO – EZ (rhymes with fez)
ALTITUDE > 1,850m
HEIGHT GAIN > 1,150m
AVERAGE GRADIENT > 8%
MAXIMUM GRADIENT > 13%
LENGTH > 14.5km
LOCATION > French Alps

The Alpe d’Huez is probably the most famous mountain climb in cycling and 
certainly the most glamorous in the Tour de France, where it was the scene of 
the first ever mountaintop finish in the race. First climbed in 1952, its 21 
hairpins (or lacets) loop their way from the village of Bourg-d’Oisans to the 
ski resort at the summit. Your prize for winning the stage? Your name on a sign 
at one of those famous lacets. Fausto Coppi’s name is there – he was the first 
to win on the Alpe. Lance Armstrong’s name is not, though he won there twice – 
the Alpe doesn’t acknowledge some of its miscreants. Christophe Riblon is the 
most recent winner – in 2013 he won the historic “double d’Huez” stage in the 
Tour de France when the Alpe was climbed twice in the same stage. The 21 signs 
on the 21 hairpin bends each bear the names of the riders who have won on the 
most glamorous mountain in cycling:

1. GIUSEPPE GUERINI (1999). The Italian climber was knocked off his bike by a 
young German photographer – eager to take a photo. Guerini got up, hopped back 
on his bike and was so far ahead he still won the stage.
2. MARCO PANTANI (1997). The pirate won 19 months after an accident at 
Milan–Turin which would have ended the career of many riders – he suffered 
multiple compound fractures to his left leg.
3. MARCO PANTANI (1995). This is generally agreed to be the record ascent at 
37 minutes and 35 seconds, and was Pantani’s first stage win in the Tour.
4. ROBERTO CONTI (1994). Eros Poli had won the day before on Mont Ventoux and 
now another gregario had his day. This was 30-year-old Conti’s first ever 
professional win.
5. ANDY HAMPSTEN (1992). The first – and now only – American winner on the 
Alpe.
6. GIANNI BUGNO (1991). This was Bugno’s second success on the Alpe, and he 
became the first rider to climb the Alpe in under 40 minutes.
7. GIANNI BUGNO (1990). Bugno beat Greg LeMond who would go on to win the Tour.
8. GERT-JAN THEUNISSE (1989). The last Dutchman to win here – the Alpe has 
been known as the Dutch mountain because of the extraordinary success of Dutch 
climbers. The only man to win on the Alpe in the polka dot jersey.
9. STEVEN ROOKS (1988). Another Dutchman.
10. FREDERICO ECHAVE (1987). This was the first win on the Alpe by a Spaniard. 
The Irish are now trying to claim this one as “Irish Corner”.
11. BERNARD HINAULT (1986). Hinault is credited with the win though he and 
team-mate LeMond crossed the finish line hand in hand at the finish of one of 
the most iconic stages in Tour de France history.
12. LUIS HERRERA (1984). “Lucho” was riding for the amateur Colombian team.
13. PETER WINNEN (1983). A double winner, the Dutchman said he felt the climb 
had taken five years off his life.
14. BEAT BREU (1982). The only Swiss to win on the Alpe, he attacked from the 
foot of the climb and was never caught.
15. PETER WINNEN (1981). Winnen was in his first year as a professional when 
he scored his first win on the Alpe.
16. JOOP ZOETEMELK (1979) and Pierre Rolland (2011). In 1979 the Alpe was 
climbed twice on successive days, Zoetemelk won the second time around. Rolland 
was only the second Frenchman to win on the Alpe where he sealed the white 
jersey. ‘I know the Alpe by heart’ he said afterwards.
17. JOACHIM AGOSTINHO (1979) and Carlos Sastre (2008). Agostinho was the only 
Portuguese rider to win on the Alpe and was 36 at the time. Sastre won the Tour 
on this stage with a well-orchestrated attack to take the yellow jersey from 
his team-mate Frank Schleck.
18. HENNIE KUIPER (1978) and Frank Schleck (2006). Kuiper, yet another 
Dutchman; and Schleck, the first rider from Luxembourg to win on the Alpe.
19. HENNIE KUIPER (1977). The Dutchman’s win from the year before.
20. JOOP ZOETEMELK (1976) and Iban Mayo (2003). In 1976 Dutchman Father Jaap 
started a tradition with Zoetemelk’s win of ringing the church bells for every 
Dutch victory, which made him a very busy man. The Spaniard Mayo attacked seven 
kilometres from the summit and won a la Pantani, completing the climb in 39 
minutes and 6 seconds.
21. FAUSTO COPPI (1952). The Italian’s style beat Robic’s sheer guts in a 
classic duel to take the first ever mountaintop finish in the Tour. His time 
for the first ever ascent was 45 minutes and 52 seconds.

BLUFF IT > “Frenchman Michel Pollentier actually won on the Alpe in 1978, but 
he was disqualified for trying to fool the doping control with a condom full of 
someone else’s pee.”

ANGLIRU

YOU SAY > ANG (rhymes with hang) – LEE – ROO
ALTITUDE > 1,573m
HEIGHT GAIN > 1,245m
AVERAGE GRADIENT > 10%
MAXIMUM GRADIENT > 24%
LENGTH > 12.2km
LOCATION > Picos de Europa, Spain

The Alpe d’Huez might be more famous, but the Angliru is one of the hardest 
climbs ever used in cycling where it forms part of the Vuelta a España. The 
Angliru was originally for goats – not cars or cyclists – and the hardest part 
is still called “the Goat Track”. In fact it’s so difficult and so steep that 
some riders just get off and walk.

Often compared to Monte Zoncolan in Italy, the Angliru was unknown before 1996 
when a member of a Spanish cycling team decided to check out rumours of a 
super-steep climb hidden away in the Picos de Europa, the razor sharp mountain 
range that isolates the Asturias region from the rest of Spain. It was 
introduced into the Vuelta a España in 1999, and one of the riders who won 
there, the Spanish climber Roberto Heras, described it simply as “hell, there’s 
nothing like it”. Abandoning the Vuelta a España in 2002, British rider David 
Millar shouted “We’re not animals and this is inhuman!” as he refused to cross 
the finish line.

Deceptive in its early kilometres, the Angliru saves its savagery for the last 
six kilometres, which ramp up to an alarming 13% with the coup de grâce, the 
Cueña les Cabres, that infamous goat track, reaching an almost impossible 24% 
just 3km from the summit.

BLUFF IT > “It would have been impossible to climb the Angliru even 20 years 
ago, old-fashioned gear ratios were just too high.”

ANQUETIL, Jacques

BORN > 8 January 1934, Mont-Saint-Aignan (Normandy), France
DIED > 18 November, 1987, Rouen (Normandy), France
NATIONALITY > French
ACTIVE > 1953–1969
RIDER TYPE > All-rounder, Anquetil was a quite outstanding time triallist
NICKNAMES >Maître Jacques (Master Jacques), Monsieur Chrono (Mr Time Trial)
BIG WINS > Tour de France (1957, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964), Giro d’Italia (1960, 
1964), Vuelta a España (1963), Grand Prix des Nations (1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 
1957, 1958, 1961, 1965, 1966), Liège–Bastogne–Liège (1966), hour record (1956)
MAJOR RIVAL > Raymond Poulidor

Jacques Anquetil was the French rider, born in Normandy, who became the first 
man ever to win the Tour de France five times, taking only eight years to do 
so, the first in 1957 with four wins in a row from 1961 to 1964. He was the 
first rider to achieve the Tour de France–Vuelta a España double, and the first 
to win all three of the Grand Tours. He was an excellent all-round rider but 
his big strength was time trialling – the Bradley Wiggins of his day.

His intense rivalry with Raymond Poulidor “the Eternal Second” divided France. 
Anquetil was considered to be cold and calculating, though in the peloton he 
was as admired for his courteousness and sense of fair play as Poulidor was 
disliked for his bad temper and selfish tactics. In 1964, their enmity 
culminated in one of the most famous stages of the Tour de France when Anquetil 
and Poulidor climbed the Puy de Dôme literally elbow to elbow, with the time 
triallist bluffing the climber every pedal stroke of the way, clinging to him 
like a limpet. Poulidor, realising too late that he had been conned, attacked 
in the final kilometre and ended the stage only 14 seconds behind his rival, 
but it was too little too late. Anquetil’s response? “That’s 13 seconds more 
than I need.”

Anquetil was a notorious party animal, staying up late during races drinking 
champagne, but he would do anything to beat Poulidor. After withdrawing from a 
race in 1967 owing to the pulmonary trouble that dogged his career, he was on a 
drinking binge with friends when one of them toasted to Poulidor’s anticipated 
success the next day. “Set the alarm for seven,” he told his wife. He was on 
the start line the next morning and beat Poulidor yet again.

But it was Anquetil’s life off the bike that was truly bizarre – he was 
involved in a love triangle with the wife of his doctor and her step-daughter 
for many years, a self-confessed doper and lover of astronomy and CB radio. He 
became great friends with Poulidor, saying that cycling had robbed them of 15 
years of friendship. Anquetil’s love of the good life finally caught up with 
him – he was dead at 53 from stomach cancer. But he never lost his dry humour, 
saying on his deathbed: “Raymond, you’re going to finish second again.”

ARDENNES

The Ardennes, along with the Flanders region in north-west Belgium, have been 
called the “beating heart of Belgian cycling”. This wooded and hilly region in 
southern Belgium is famous for the races known as the Spring Classics, the 
Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The climbs may not have the grandeur 
of the Alps or the Pyrenees, but they are steep. The Cauberg has a maximum 
gradient of 12%, la Redoute 17% and the Mur de Huy a whopping 26%. The Mur de 
Huy really is like climbing a wall. Try doing that on your bike.

ATTACK

When a rider launches himself off the front of the peloton, he goes on the 
attack. Baroudeurs (see B) live for the opportunity to launch a long range bid 
for glory. For the GC contenders, the mountains are the place where Grand Tours 
are won and lost, though Hugo Koblet – the “pedaleur de charme” – won the 1951 
Tour de France by attacking on a flat stage.

BLUFF IT > “As Bernard Hinault, one of the most aggressive riders ever, used 
to say: ‘As long as I breathe, I attack.’”

ARMSTRONG, Lance


BORN >18 September 1971, Plano (Texas), United States
NATIONALITY >American
ACTIVE > 1992–2011
RIDER TYPE > All-rounder, strong in the time trials and the mountains
NICKNAMES > The Boss, Big Tex, Mellow Johnny
BIG WINS > Tour de France* (*Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France 
titles gained between 1999–2005 in 2012), world championships (1993), San 
Sebastián Classic (1995)
MAJOR RIVALS > Jan Ullrich, Marco Pantani

The world now knows, thanks to Oprah Winfrey and the work of the US 
Anti-Doping Agency, thatLance Armstrong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong> did not win a 
record-breaking seven Tours de France. Even though the world saw him ride up 
the Champs-Élysées in the yellow jersey seven times, he had used 
performance-enhancing methods including EPO and blood doping to achieve those 
victories and they were stripped by the UCI in 2012.

All those career-defining moments – the attack on Sestriere in 1999 when he 
was likened to a motorbike; the “look” he gave Jan Ullrich on the Alpe d’Huez 
in 2001; the “Blue Train” of his US Postal team dominating the 2002 team time 
trial; the off-road bike handling skills when he avoided the Joseba Beloki 
crash in 2003 and the recovery from the crash on Luz Ardiden to win the stage 
and the race in the same year; even his third place comeback in 2007 – all were 
a product of what the US Anti-Doping Agency called “the most sophisticated, 
professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen”.

ARRIVÉE

YOU SAY > A (as in apple) – REE – VAY (rhymes with say)
WHAT IT MEANS > Let’s start at the finish – Arrivée is the French word for the 
finish line of a race, usually marked by a giant inflatable archway. In 2013, 
the Orica-Greenedge team bus managed to get wedged underneath the finish line 
at the Tour de France but the arrivéeis usually the stage for a rider to cross 
the finish line and throw their arms aloft in the traditional V of victory.

AUTOBUS

YOU SAY > OR – TOE – BOOS (rhymes with loose)
WHAT IT MEANS > This is the large group of riders that forms at the back of 
the race, usually during the mountain stages. This is where you find the 
sprinters and the big men, the domestiques who have done their job of 
shepherding their team leader for the day, the worn out and injured and those 
who just haven’t got the “legs” that day.

Team rivalries are set aside as these riders unite around one common aim – to 
get to the finish line before they’re eliminated for being outside the time 
limit, which is set at a percentage of the winner’s finish time. The other good 
reason for staying in the autobus orgrupetto is that there’s safety in numbers: 
while the commissaires might be happy to exclude one or two riders, they’re 
less happy about excluding a large group, especially if some of the star 
sprinters are facing the chop.

BAROUDEUR

YOU SAY > BAA (like a sheep)– ROO – DUR (rhymes with fur)
WHAT IT MEANS > Who doesn’t love a long, lone breakaway – those plucky 
underdogs trying, usually hopelessly, to stay away from the speeding peloton? 
The French have a word for them, and that word isbaroudeur. It comes from the 
Arabic, where its meaning is “dynamite”. The French use it to mean “adventurer” 
and in bike racing it’s all about the riders who like to put a bomb under the 
race and go off on the attack.

BLUFF IT > “Look there’s Jens Voigt in the break – he’s a typical baroudeur.”

BARTALI, Gino

BORN >18 July, 1914, Florence (Tuscany), Italy
DIED >5 May 2000, Florence (Tuscany), Italy
NATIONALITY >Italian
RIDER TYPE >All-rounder with excellent climbing abilities
ACTIVE >1935–1954
NICKNAMES > The Man of Iron, Gino the Pious
BIG WINS > Tour de France (1938, 1948), Giro d’Italia (1936, 1937, 1947), 
Milan–San Remo (1939, 1940, 1947, 1950), king of the mountains at the Giro 
d’Italia (1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1946, 1947)
MAJOR RIVAL >Fausto Coppi

Gino Bartali holds the record for the longest time between two Tours de France 
wins, 10 years (1938 and 1948). His performance in the 1938 Tour de France is 
the stuff of legend and he finished the race as the king of the mountains as 
well as the yellow jersey, the first time the feat was ever achieved. In 1948 
he was credited with helping Italy to avoid civil war by winning again, 10 
years later (a record never equalled) – it’s a legend, but of such legends the 
Tour de France is made.

Bartali enjoyed such an intense rivalry with Fausto Coppi that the two riders 
were ordered to sign a peace pact in the 1949 Tour when Coppi made his debut at 
the race. It started in the 1940 Giro when the young star, newly signed for 
Bartali’s Legano team, decided to win the race himself and the older man 
ordered his team to ride Coppi down at every opportunity. In the 1948 world 
championships, both riders abandoned rather than ride to support the other. The 
pact held in 1949 with Coppi winning Bartali finishing as runner-up. There was 
a famous incident in the 1952 Tour when the riders shared a bottle, and even 
then a dispute raged as to who offered a bidon to whom.

One of the greatest riders ever, his greatest achievement didn’t happen on the 
bike. In 2013 he was named “righteous among the nations” at the Yad Vashem 
Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem for his work saving the lives of Italian Jews 
in the second world war. Bartali worked as a courier for the Jewish-Christian 
rescue network in Florence, hiding photographs and forged identity documents in 
the handlebars and seat post of his bicycle – if stopped and searched he would 
specifically ask that those parts of his bike be left untouched as they were 
calibrated for maximum speed. He was responsible for helping a Jewish friend 
Giacomo Goldenberg and his family to hide in a cellar and supported them 
throughout the war, despite the enormous risk involved – at one point he was 
even arrested and questioned by the secret police in Florence.

Yet he never spoke about his role as a secret hero, only telling his son: “If 
you’re good at a sport, they attach the medals to your shirt and then they 
shine in some museum. That which is earned by doing good deeds is attached to 
the soul and shines elsewhere.” When people told him he was a hero he would 
reply: “No, no. I want to be remembered for my sporting achievements. Real 
heroes are others, those who have suffered in their soul, in their heart, in 
their spirit, in their mind, for their loved ones. Those are the real heroes. 
I’m just a cyclist.”

BLUFF IT > “Years before Nike, Bartali had the words ‘Just Do It’ written in 
Italian on his cycling cap.”

BICYCLE

Ah, the bicycle – the most efficient vehicle ever invented – and the most 
environmentally friendly, not to mention the healthiest. This simple, 
affordable machine can be used for transportation, fun, fitness and sport. The 
first human powered land vehicle was invented in 1418 but the mountain bike 
didn’t appear until 1977. There are a billion bicycles in the world and 50m 
more are manufactured every year.

The first real bicycle was the velocipede or boneshaker (1865) – an aptly 
named wooden machine with metal tyres – then came the penny farthing and then 
the safety bicycle, popular in the 1880s. This is the prototype for all modern 
bicycles with its diamond shaped frame, two wheels of equal size and chain 
driven back wheel. The bicycle has brought more personal and social mobility 
and a greater sense of liberation to more people than any other invention – no 
wonder it became known as ‘the freedom machine’.

BLUFF FACT > The pneumatic tyre was used on bikes before cars. 
BLUFF IT > “Of course metal wheel rims weren’t used in the Tour de France 
until 1935 – until then they used wooden wheels.”

BIDON

YOU SAY > BEE – DON
WHAT IS IT? > If you’ve ever been to a bike race you might have been part of 
the scramble to grab a plastic drinking bottle tossed to the roadside. These 
are bidons and they’re usually branded with sponsors’ logos. They make a great 
souvenir – especially if they came from a Wiggins or a Cavendish. In case 
you’re worried about the ecological impact of all that litter, most races now 
have designated sections along the route where riders can dispose of their 
empties.

BLUFF IT > “I saw rider x stuff 13 bidons up his jersey in two minutes – I 
believe that’s a record.”

BONIFICATION

Or, more simply, bonif. A bonification is a time bonus awarded to a rider for 
winning a stage, an intermediate sprint, or taking the king of the mountains 
prize on the summit of a climb. Somewhat confusingly, the bonification – or 
bonus – is subtracted from the rider’s time, not added to it. For the 
definitive pronunciation of the word, try listening to Sean Kelly commentating 
on a bike race.

BONK

The bonk is that horrible sinking feeling when your body’s energy stores hit 
“empty”. Runners call it “hitting the wall” and it’s the moment when you can’t 
go any further and start pedalling squares.

BREAKAWAY

In any race a breakaway will form at some point, often gaining huge time gaps 
over the main field. On a flat stage, the sprinters’ teams will work together 
to bring back the breakaway using Chapatte’s Law. Robert Chapatte, a French 
ex-professional cyclist turned TV commentator, noticed that a speeding peloton 
takes 10km to gain back one minute on a breakaway, though with advances in bike 
technology and rider fitness it’s now more like 90 seconds. His law is so 
precise that you often see riders caught inside the final kilometres. On a 
mountain stage you’ll see the teams of the main contenders riding a fast tempo 
on the climbs to keep their riders out of trouble and in contention, but when 
it comes to a mountaintop finish it’s every man for himself.

Very occasionally a breakaway gains such a huge advantage that it affects the 
result of the race – Roger Walkowiak won the Tour de France in this way in 
1956. The longest solo breakaway ever was 315km by Eugene Christophe in the 
1912 Tour de France. The post-war record is held by Albert Bourlon, who rode 
the entire 253-kilometre stage from Carcassone to Luchon – including the climbs 
of the col de Port and the col de Portet d’Aspet – alone from start to finish. 
Chapeau Albert Bourlon!

BROOM WAGON/VOITURE BALAI

YOU SAY > VWAH – CHEWER BAL (as in balance) – EYE
WHAT IS IT? > They say it ain’t over till the fat lady sings. In bike racing 
it ain’t over till the broom wagon goes past, signalling the end of the race. 
Henri Desgrange introduced the broom wagon in 1910 when the Tour de France 
first hit the climbs of the high Pyrenees – its purpose was to “sweep up” 
riders too ill or exhausted to continue.

The original broom wagon was a Citroen H van with an actual broom tied to the 
back doors. These days, riders are more likely to climb into a team car rather 
than face the indignity of a ride to the finish line in the voiture balai. 
Whereas in the early days of the Tour, a rider could abandon a stage but still 
rejoin the race the next day (though his result no longer counted for the 
overall win) these days an abandon is final and the rider has his race number 
stripped from his back to prove it.

This is the vehicle no rider wants to go home in – French rider Pierrick 
Fédrigo called his ride in the broom wagon “a humiliating and humbling 
experience” and British rider Graham Jones (20th in the 1981 Tour) said of his 
own experience: “I defy any rider to say that he hasn’t shed a tear at climbing 
into the Tour broom wagon. Maybe not immediately but at some time in that 
journey to the finish ... the reality will hit home. You climb off the bike 
followed by the horrible moment when the commissaire takes off your race number 
... it’s an experience that you will never forget.”

BURTON Beryl

BORN > 12 May 1937, Halton (Yorkshire), England
DIED > 8 May 1996, Morley (Yorkshire), England
NATIONALITY > British
RIDER TYPE > Track and road with extraordinary time-trialling capabilities
ACTIVE > 1957–1996
MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS > World road race champion (1960, 1967), world pursuit 
champion (1959, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1966), national pursuit champion, national 
road champion, national 100-mile time-trial champion, national 50-mile time 
trial champion, 25-mile time trial champion, 10-mile time trial champion 
(Burton was in her 40s when the 10-mile distance was introduced), British best 
all-rounder 1959–1983 (25 years!)

Burton was one of Britain’s greatest ever athletes, male or female. In terms 
of sheer number of records, she’s the female Eddy Merckx, though Marianne Vos 
is snapping at her heels. Burton shared their competitive spirit too, once 
refusing to shake hands with her daughter – quite uniquely, mother and daughter 
both competed for Great Britain – after a race which Denise had won (Beryl 
claimed it was because she felt her daughter – who had won by the narrowest of 
margins – “hadn’t done her whack”).

Burton was born in Yorkshire, where the Tour de France started in 2014, and 
held 90 national titles and seven world titles. She held many UK time-trial 
records and was invited to ride the highly prestigious Grand Prix des Nations – 
the time trial for elite male riders – in 1967. There was no world championship 
time trial when Burton was riding, and women’s cycling wasn’t introduced to the 
Olympic games until Burton was 47 so how many more rainbow jerseys she might 
have won or how many gold medals might have hung around her neck remains a 
tantalising “what if”.

Burton had also set her sights on riding the inaugural women’s Tour de France 
– introduced in the same year as the Olympic women’s road race, 1984 – but 
British Cycling in their wisdom refused, saying she didn’t have sufficient 
road-racing experience. When a rider dropped out at the last minute, Burton was 
approached to take her place – she none too politely told BritishCycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling> to go and practise a spot of 
taxidermy on itself ...

But self-financed and with her husband acting as coach, mechanic and soigneur, 
she was a voracious record setter – the first woman under the hour for 25 miles 
and she went on to break the two and four-hour barrier for the 50 and 100 
miles. A perfectionist, Burton was always trying to better her own records and 
many stood for 20 years – in fact her 12-hour record of 277.25 miles, set in 
1967, still stands, in an age of disc wheels, carbon fibre and skinsuits. 
Burton died in 1996at the age of 59, while delivering birthday-party 
invitations on her bike.

BLUFF FACT > “Burton once rode past a male competitor in a race and offered 
him a sweet from her jersey pocket – he went on to set a national men’s record 
shorter than the distance Beryl herself set that day. She said later ‘the poor 
dear seemed to be struggling a bit’. His cycling club later honoured her with a 
huge version of that liquorice allsort.”

C is for ...

COPPI, Fausto

BORN > 15 September 1919, Castellania (Piedmont), Italy
DIED >2 January 1960, Tortona (Piedmont), Italy
NATIONALITY > Italian
ACTIVE > 1939–1959
RIDER TYPE > All-rounder – Coppi was a superb climber and time triallist
NICKNAME > Il Campionissimo (the Champion) 
BIG WINS > Giro d’Italia (1940, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953), Tour de France (1949, 
1952), Giro/Tour double (1949, 1952), world champion (1953), Milan–San Remo 
(1946, 1948, 1949), Tour of Lombardy (1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1954)
MAJOR RIVAL>Gino Bartali

It’s arguable that Il Campionissimo Fausto Coppi, and not Eddy Merckx, was the 
greatest rider of all time. He was the first rider to achieve the Giro 
d’Italia-Tour de France double, and unlike modern riders who tend to specialise 
in one type of event, Coppi rode all season long and won Grand Tours and 
Classics in his career.

A prisoner of war in the second world war, what he might have achieved had his 
career not been interrupted is one of the great “what ifs” of the sport. He was 
prone to illness and injury – childhood malnutrition left him with brittle 
bones and he suffered over 20 major fractures during his career. Coppi was the 
first man to win on Alpe d’Huez and Puy de Dome in France and the Stelvio in 
the Italian Alps. Known as “perfection on two wheels” for his style on the 
bike, his exploits are both legendary and legion: winning the 1946 Milan–San 
Remo Classic by 14 minutes, having attacked just 5km into the 292-kilometre 
race; the 1942 hour record that stood for 14 years; the 190km he rode alone 
through the high peaks of the Alps in the 1949 Giro, much of it on dirt roads, 
over the passes of the Colle della Maddalena, Vars, Izoard, Monginevro and, 
finally, Sestriere before arriving in Pinerolo 11 minutes and 42 seconds ahead 
of his deadly rival Gino Bartali.

Coppi was dogged with scandal and tragedy during his life – he left his wife 
for the “Woman in White”, Giulia Occhini, who was married to an army captain. 
The affair had started in 1948 when the two met at the Tre Valli Varesine race 
but was made public in 1954 when La Stampa published a photograph of the 
Italian champion embracing the mysterious woman in a white dress at the finish 
line of a race in St Moritz. He fathered an illegitimate son, Faustino, 
incurring the wrath of the Roman Catholic Church who threatened to 
ex-communicate him – adultery was still frowned upon, even in a modernising 
Italy and the Pope refused to bless the Giro when Coppi competed. Occhini was 
forced to have her baby son in Argentina and the couple’s hotel room was raided 
by police eager to see if they were sharing a bed.

Coppi had already endured the tragedy of his beloved brother Serse’s death. 
Also a professional, the younger brother died after injuries sustained in a 
crash in a race in 1951 where the two brothers had been competing together. 
Suffering an undiagnosed concussion, Serse died in Fausto’s arms.

Coppi arguably invented the modern approach to bike racing – he was meticulous 
about his diet and training regime, though he was equally open about his use of 
amphetamines, which he referred to as “la Bomba”. His rivalry with Bartali lit 
up the roads of Europe but also reflected a wider conflict in Italian society 
between the religious and the secular, the traditional and the modern. Coppi 
lived fast and died young – he contracted malaria while racing in Africa and 
was dead at 40. When a reporter once asked him what it took to be a great 
champion, Coppi’s answer was simple: “Ride your bike, ride your bike, ride your 
bike.”

BLUFF IT > “Imagine, Coppi’s prize for winning his first race aged 15 was 20 
lire (about £8) and a salami sandwich.”

CADENCE

The number of revolutions of the crank per minute (rpm) – in other words, how 
fast or slow a cyclist is pedalling. The biggest contrast in recent years was 
between Jan Ullrich – who favoured a big gear and a low cadence (65–70 rpm) – 
and Lance Armstrong who used smaller gears and rode at 110 rpm. High cadence 
riding is generally accepted to be better for overall performance, which 
Armstrong’s success would indicate if he hadn’t confessed to doping in 2013.

BLUFF IT > “Look at rider x twiddling those tiny gears with a high cadence” or 
conversely “Look at rider y grinding out those big gears with his low cadence”.

CARAVAN

They say you’ve never seen the caravan until you’ve wrestled a pensioner for a 
freebie. The caravan is the long string of publicity vehicles that precede the 
Tour de France – you might catch a keyring, grab a cap or get squirted by the 
water cannon. You can feed yourself for the day on little sausages (if you like 
little sausages). All the major sponsors of the Tour have vehicles in the 
caravan – you’ll see the PMU horses, the Festina watches and the Coca-Cola 
wagons. There have been some weird and wonderful vehicles over the years 
featuring everything from garden gnomes to baguettes.

It made a star of Yvette Horner, a young French accordion player, in the 1950s 
and 60s when she would serenade spectators and podium presentations alike from 
her specially adapted van. The organisers of the Tour de France say that over 
50% of people who watch the race have actually come to see the caravan.

BLUFF IT > “Did you know there are 160 vehicles in the caravan which give away 
16m items during the three weeks of the race? That’s about 32 tons of freebies 
or the weight of seven elephants.”

CHAPEAU

YOU SAY > SHAP (rhymes with nap) – OH (rhymes with low)
WHAT IT MEANS > A Frenchman’s chapeau is his hat, and he tips it to indicate a 
job well done. Love it or loathe it – and many British fans prefer the more 
Anglocentric “hat” (or Scottish “bunnet”) – it is the universal term of 
approval that indicates a good win or a great exploit. So chapeau for buying 
this book [buy it here, online readers 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/335262/?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
].

CHASSE PATATE

YOU SAY > SHASS (rhymes with lass) PAT – AT
WHAT IT MEANS > Literally? Hunting potatoes. In a bike race, when a rider is 
wedged between the breakaway and the peloton, pedalling furiously but making 
little headway to catch the group ahead, he is en chasse patate. It’s a term 
from the old Vélodrome d’Hiver (the winter velodrome) in Paris and the six-day 
races that took place on the boards there. These marathon events, originating 
in the UK, involved riders refuelling on the go – the sprints to catch the 
leaders were noticeably slower after dinner whilst the riders digested the 
contents of their musettes. These slow-motion sprints became known as
chasse-patate, sometimes translated as “ploughing potatoes”.

CHEATING

Cycling has become synonymous with doping in recent years, but other forms of 
cheating have dogged racing over the years. Taking the train, getting a lift in 
a team car, the “magic spanner” and the “sticky bottle” have all helped riders 
to get to the finish over the years. Riders now get fined for hanging on to the 
team car too long or accepting a push from a fan.

BLUFF IT > “In 1904, Hippolyte Aucouturier held a cork between his teeth 
attached to a piece of wire to get a tow from his team car – hope he had a good 
dentist.”

CHUTE

YOU SAY > SHOOT
WHAT IT MEANS > Now say “ow”. Hope you were wearing a helmet – you just 
learned the French word for crash. Anything can cause a crash – a narrow pinch 
point in the road, the fight for position as the peloton head towards a tough 
section of the race or a stray spectator wanting a closer look at the action – 
one memorable crash at a Tour de France stage finish in 1994 was caused by a 
policeman stepping out into the road to take a photo. If you’re going to crash 
in a race, make sure you do it inside the last three kilometres, then you’ll be 
given the same time as the rest of the peloton.

CLASSIC

WHAT IS IT? > A one-day race that’s been staged for a number of years is known 
as a “Classic”. There are Classic races in the spring and the autumn raced over 
the flat (Paris–Tours: the Sprinters’ Classic), small to medium climbs (Amstel 
Gold, Flèche Wallonne, Liège–Bastogne–Liège) and, most famously, the cobbles of 
the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix. Five of these super-hard races are 
known as ‘the Monuments’: Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders Paris–Roubaix, 
Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Tour of Lombard. Three men have been the King of 
the Classics, winning all five Monuments in a season, and all three are Belgian 
– Roger de Vlaeminck, Rik van Looy and of course Eddy Merckx.

BLUFF IT > “The original Classics could be over 400km long – the longest is 
now Milan–San Remo at 298km or 185 miles – that’s like riding from London to 
Sheffield.”

CLIMBING

This is part of the key skill set for any jersey contender in a Grand Tour or 
one of the hilly Classics like Milan–San Remo. Of the great stage-race riders, 
all have been able to climb with the true mountain goats (think Merckx and 
Coppi) or been able to stamp their authority on the race in the time trial and 
then control the climbers in the mountains – that’s how Wiggins won the 2012 
Tour. But even sprinters need to have some climbing chops if they want to win 
the points jersey in a Grand Tour.

BLUFF IT > “You don’t wear green in Paris if you can’t get over the mountains.”

COBBLES

Britain has its very own equivalent of the pavé climbs of the Tour of Flanders 
– the Michaelgate in Lincoln is a narrow, cobbled climb with an average 16% 
gradient, making it the equivalent of the Cauberg.

COMMISSAIRE

YOU SAY > COM – EE – SAIR (rhymes with hair)
WHAT IT MEANS > The commissaire is cycling’s equivalent of an umpire or a 
referee. It’s their job to check a rider’s eligibility to compete, to ensure 
that they’re using equipment that complies with the rules and to resolve 
disputes and judge results. It’s the commissaires who make the call on a photo 
finish or declassify a rider for dangerous riding.

CONTADOR, Alberto

BORN > 6 December 1982, Pinto (Madrid), Spain
NATIONALITY > Spanish
ACTIVE > 2003–
RIDER TYPE > All-rounder, climbing specialist
NICKNAME > El Pistolero (Contador has a trademarked finger-bang victory salute)
BIG WINS > Tour de France (2007, 2009), Giro d’Italia (2008), Vuelta a España 
(2008, 2012), Paris–Nice (2007, 2010)
MAJOR RIVAL > Lance Armstrong, Andy Schleck, Chris Froome

Spain’s Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> 
is the only Spanish rider to have won all three Grand Tours – the Tour de 
France, the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España. He has also achieved a rare 
Giro-Vuelta double in 2008 after his Astana team were not selected for the Tour 
de France because of the previous year’s doping scandals, though the Spaniard 
was not a member of the team in 2007.

Always an athletic and sporty kid, Contador switched focus from football and 
athletics to cycling at the age of fourteen when his older brother, Javier (now 
his manager), introduced him to the sport. The pair had a loving but 
hardscrabble childhood in Pinto – where Contador continues to live – as their 
parents struggled to provide for a younger brother with cerebral palsy. Cycling 
gave the young man an opportunity to help out financially.

Success was swift: he won five Grand Tours in three years, including three 
Tours de France, though he lost his 2010 victory after failing a test for 
clenbuterol, which the rider blamed on eating contaminated steak. The race was 
notable for the infamous “chaingate” incident on stage 15, when Contador 
appeared to attack his closest rival, Andy Schleck, after the Luxembourg rider 
had a mechanical when his chain came off. The incident was controversial 
because Schleck was wearing the leader’s yellow jersey at the time and one of 
the sport’s unwritten rules is that you don’t attack the yellow jersey when 
he’s in trouble – a rule that is oft quoted and rarely observed. Contador took 
the jersey and held it to the finish line in Paris, only to lose it again when 
the UCI banned him for two years (the ban was backdated) in 2012.

After winning the 2008 Giro d’Italia with virtually no preparation it was his 
2009 Tour win that sealed Contador’s reputation as the greatest stage-race 
talent of his generation. It was a titanic struggle with team-mate Lance 
Armstrong – Contador would later say he’d had to contest two races, one on the 
road and one in the hotel, calling the race “psychologically tough”. Isolated 
in the team, with Armstrong commandeering not only the best equipment but also 
the team’s entire fleet of cars so the Spaniard was forced to rely on his 
brother to get back to the team hotel after summit finishes, Contador disobeyed 
team orders and attacked on the uphill finish to Arcalis in the Pyrenees and 
finally took the yellow jersey on stage 15, cementing the lead with a victory 
on the final time trial in Annecy.

But it might all have been so different – in 2004, Contador collapsed during a 
race and was rushed to hospital suffering from a cerebral cavernoma (a cluster 
of abnormal blood cells in the brain), a congenital condition that required 
delicate surgery and threatened to end his career. The Spaniard maintains that 
the best victory of his career was winning the queen stage of the 2008 Tour 
Down Under in Australia.

BLUFF FACT > “Though he was inspired to get into cycling by his compatriot 
Miguel Indurain, his boyhood heroes were Italian Marco Pantani and America’s 
Lance Armstrong. He claims he read Armstrong’s book ‘It’s Not about the Bike’ 
twice when he was recuperating from his cerebral cavernoma.”

BLUFF FACT > “Contador’s first set of cycling gear was homemade. His mum sewed 
some old shoulder pads into a pair of shorts and cut the toes off some old 
socks for arm warmers.”

MAJOR RIVAL > Marianne Vos

Nicole Cooke is one of the greatest cyclists the UK has ever produced and one 
of the best female riders of all time. She began cycling aged 11 and was 
awarded the Birdlake Memorial Prize for outstanding contribution to British 
cycling by becoming world mountain bike, road and time-trial champion. But 
arguably her greatest contribution was her ongoing fight to establish British 
championship racing for girls which has paved the way for a whole generation of 
stars like Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott.Cooke published her autobiography 
The Breakaway in 2014 and continues to campaign for women’s cycling.

BLUFF IT > “Nicole is one of the few cyclists, male or female, to win Olympic 
gold and the rainbow stripes in the same year.”
