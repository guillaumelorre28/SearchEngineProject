When drawing up the article on “pink” (Colour coded, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/10/think-pink-how-the-colour-is-being-reclaimed>
 G2, 11 September), one initiative was missed: Code Pink. This is a
women-initiated peace and social justice movement 
<http://www.codepink4peace.org/>working to end US-funded wars and occupations 
and challenge militarism, and campaigning for funds for welfare not warfare. It 
was founded in November 2002 at a vigil in front of the White House to stop the 
US invading Iraq, which inspired hundreds to stand for peace.

Medea Benjamin <http://www.codepink.org/article.php?id=51>, one of its founder 
members, was recently in Cardiff speaking at the Nato Counter Summit in 
solidarity with those opposing the nuclear armed military alliance. This US 
peace group brings a powerful message with pink.
