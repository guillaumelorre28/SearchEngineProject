Around 10am on 14 August 2014, an unremarkable man walked into a café near 
Tishinskaya Square in Moscow. He ordered a coffee, sat down, opened up a cheap 
laptop and launched a few applications: a text editor, an app for encrypted 
chat, and a browser.

Then, he opened Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> and 
wrote: “I’m resigning. I am ashamed of this government’s actions. Forgive me.”


The tweet immediately appeared on prime minister Dmitri Medvedev’s official 
Twitter account <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28786683>, visible to his 
2.5m followers.

Taking a sip of his coffee, he wrote a few more tweets: “I will become a 
photographer. I’ve dreamed about it for some time”; “Vova [Putin]! You are 
wrong!”


The tweeter is a member of Anonymous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous> International, better known 
as Shaltai Boltai (Humpty Dumpty in Russian), arguably the most famous hacker 
group in the country after claiming responsibility for a series of high-profile 
leaks.

In the past two years, they’ve gained access to documents detailing the 
Russian state’s game plan for a supposedly “grassroots” demonstration inMoscow 
in support of its actions in Crimea 
<http://slon.ru/russia/kak_kovalas_pobeda_v_krymu-1095637.xhtml>; details about 
how the Kremlin prepared Crimea’s secessionist referendum; and private emails
allegedly belonging to Igor Strelkov 
<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-igor-strelkov-i-am-responsible-for-war-in-eastern-ukraine/511584.html>
, who claims he played a key role in organising the pro-Russian insurgency in 
Donetsk, Ukraine.

The group also released documents about how Concord 
<http://www.fontanka.ru/2014/05/29/170/>, a company owned by Kremlin-connected 
restaurant owner Evgeny Prigozhin, apparently coordinates anarmy of pro-Putin 
internet trolls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/putin-kremlin-inside-russian-troll-house>
 through an outfit called the Internet Research Agency.

Last week the collective released roughly 40,000 text messages apparently 
taken from the mobile phone of Timur Prokopenko 
<https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/03/31/data-leaking-group-releases-thousands-of-text-messages-revealing-mechanics-of-kremlin-censorship>
, manager of the Kremlin’s Internet policy between 2012–2014.

Salutin' Putin: inside a Russian troll house

Speaking about the Medvedev Twitter hack, one of Anonymous International’s 
members said they had “monitored him for two years, but nothing interesting 
ever happened, so we decided we’d just troll him instead”.

Thirty minutes after they sent the first tweet, Putin’s press secretary, 
Dmitri Peskov, announced to reporters, “I can say with high probability that 
we’re looking at a hacker attack.” The government soon confirmed it: “The prime 
minister’s Twitter account has been hacked. The last several messages posted 
are untrue.”

The first leaks

On a dark and humid evening in Bangkok in early January, I met one of the 
heads of Shaltai Boltai, where he told me the Twitter story. He wouldn’t tell 
me his name, forbade me from recording our conversation and refuses to let me 
describe his appearance. For the sake of convenience, I’ll call him Lewis. 
(After all, Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, with its inside-out logic, 
most accurately captures the world of Russian politics,Shaltai’s members have 
said <http://apparat.cc/world/boltai/>.)


It took three months of emailing to arrange a meeting. At first, it was 
supposed to take place in Istanbul, then in Kiev. I asked the group whether 
they were changing our meetings because the police were on their trail. “We 
don’t think so :) :) :),” they wrote. “We’ve got too many trails. Really, we’re 
not afraid of anything, honestly :) :).”

Really, we’re not afraid of anything, honestly :) :)
Shaltai Boltai 
Back in December 2013, Anonymous International registered its website on 
Wordpress and later that month published the full text of Vladimir Putin’s New 
Year’s national address – several hours before it aired on television.

Over the next 12 months, they released what was mainly correspondence from 
email accounts and mobile phones belonging to Russian politicians of varying 
degrees of influence.


Igor Osadchy, named in the leaked emails as the director of a project tasked 
with placing “trolling” comments in foreign news media later sued Boltai 
Shaltai for personal data theft. A representative at Roskomnadzor, Russia’s 
federal agency for media oversight, then announced: “A court has determined 
that the information [published by Shaltai] must be deleted, but the website’s 
hosting provider has not responded to our notification. Therefore, our agency 
has orderedInternet <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet> Service 
Providers to block this blog.”


Acting on orders from Roskomnadzor, in July Russian service providers blocked 
access to the domain b0ltai.org. The group’s main Twitter account, @b0ltai, was 
also blocked.

Today, Shaltai’s website is accessible in Russia only via a virtual private 
network or amirror site <http://b0ltay.blogspot.de/>. The group also runs 
@b0ltai2 <https://twitter.com/b0ltai2>, a duplicate Twitter account still 
unblocked in Russia that reproduces all the first account’s posts, down to its 
retweets.

In August, Anonymous International released the archives from three different 
email accountsallegedly belonging to Dmitri Medvedev 
<http://top.rbc.ru/society/14/08/2014/942938.shtml>, as well as correspondence 
from Duma deputy and United Russia member Robert Shlegel about an organised 
“troll” attack on the websites of major American and British news media 
(including The New York Times, CNN, BBC, USA Today, and The Huffington Post).

Our mission is to change the world for the better, helping to bring greater 
freedom and social awareness
Shaltai Botai 
In an interview conducted over encrypted chat, Anonymous International’s press 
secretaryclaimed 
<http://www.lookatme.ru/mag/people/manifesto/206757-shaltay-boltay> that the 
group publishes leaks because it is “dissatisfied with the restrictions on free 
speech online and with Russia’s aggressive foreign policy.”

It has complaints about Russian domestic policy, too: “They only let the 
convenient candidates participate in elections,” and it’s “impossible to work 
peacefully in a small or medium business”.

Shaltai Boltai’s stated mission <http://apparat.cc/world/boltai/> is “to 
change the world for the better, helping to bring greater freedom and social 
awareness”.

One of the group’s members quotes the 2009 film Watchmen 
<http://spektr.delfi.lv/novosti/my-ne-slivaem-my-rasskazyvaem-pravdu.d?id=45161768>
, saying, “We don’t do this thing because it’s permitted. We do it because we 
have to. We do it because we’re compelled. Once a man has seen society’s black 
underbelly, he can never turn his back on it.”

‘Changing reality’

With a bang of the exhaust, we come to a halt in the centre of Bangkok, where 
Lewis suggests another ride, this time on the subway. If Lewis is to be 
believed, leaking documents in the public interest is Shaltai Boltai’s “side 
project”. The group’s main work is getting hired to dig up information about 
private and public individuals.

The whole company consists of a dozen people, he said. Apart from the 
technical staff, there are Shaltai and Boltai, who manage communications with 
the outside world, two co-founders (one of whom is Lewis), and a woman called 
Alice. “She’s a field officer doing extremely important work,” Lewis explains.

Our prices start at around $30,000. I won’t say how high they go. We earn 
enough to live comfortably and to travel.
Lewis 
The company’s structure, Lewis says, resembles an “online gaming clan”: the 
staff don’t know each other in person, but they spend hours chatting together 
every day. No one collects a regular salary, and the size of one’s earnings 
depends on how much he or she contributes to an operation. Fees are paid in 
cash, and sometimes in bitcoins.


I ask Lewis if the group has many clients? “We have a small circle of regular 
ones,” he says. “It’s enough for us. Our prices start at around $30,000. I 
won’t say how high they go. We earn enough to live comfortably and to travel.”

Buying and selling information, the group “are hired by private individuals 
and groups within the state, and we never work with anyone tied to the drug 
trade. But we maintain that we’re an independent team.”

At its core, Lewis says, their job is about “changing the current reality.” 

“Generally, we only release information that’s socially useful. We never share 
personal data.” I ask him whether, if they had access to the data like that 
Edward Snowden leaked, would they publish it? “Most likely not. Not everything 
needs to be released.”

I ask Lewis if I can photograph his laptop, or his hat. He agrees and hangs 
his hat on a nearby fence so that none of the signs in the background are 
visible. “It would be easy to come here later, pay someone some money, and get 
the camera footage from this area,” Lewis says, as he buys some orange juice 
from a street vendor.

He takes a small bottle of gin out of his bag and has a sip. Then he fishes 
out the mobile he used to phone me from his pocket. Using a handkerchief, he 
rubs off the fingerprints and removes the sim card and battery, tossing them in 
different bins.

With that, he runs off to catch a train to the airport.
