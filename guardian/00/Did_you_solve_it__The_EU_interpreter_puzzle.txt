Earlier today I set you this puzzle: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/04/can-you-solve-it-the-eu-interpreter-puzzle>

Fran French, Geraldine German, Dudley Dutch, Spike Spanish, Polly Polish and 
Ron Romanian are six British interpreters at the EU.

They each speak two European languages, as well as English, but none speaks 
the language indicated by their name.

No two interpreters speak the same two foreign languages and each of the six 
foreign languages is spoken by only two of them.

Spike speaks Dutch and German while his cousin speaks Dutch and Polish.

Fran and Dudley speak all the four languages not indicated by their names. Of 
the two languages that Dudley is fluent in, both of their namesakes speak 
French. No German speakers knows any Polish.

Which two languages does Ron speak?

The answer is French and Spanish, and here’s why:

If the languages are F, G, D, S, P and R then we know:

1) Spike speaks D and G

2) Fran and Dudley speak G, S, P and R. 

There are six possible combinations of splitting these four languages between 
Fran and Dud:

(i) Fran speaks G, P and Dud speaks S, R: IMPOSSIBLE since no German speakers 
know Polish.

(ii) Fran speaks S, R, and Dud speaks G, P: IMPOSSIBLE since no German 
speakers know Polish.

(iii) Fran speaks G, R, and Dud speaks S, P: IMPOSSIBLE since namesakes of 
both of Dud’s languages can speak French, but we know Spike Spanish does not 
speak French.

(iv) Fran speaks P, R and Dud speaks S, G: IMPOSSIBLE since namesakes of both 
of Dud’s languages can speak French, but we know Spike Spanish does not speak 
French.


(v) Fran speaks S, P and Dud speaks G, R: IMPOSSIBLE since this would mean 
that both Geraldine and Ron speak French, which means that Spike’s cousin, the 
only one left, is Polly, who speaks Dutch and Polish. But Ms Polish cannot 
speak Polish because no one speaks the language indicated by their name.

(vi) Fran speaks G, S and Dud speaks P, R: This would mean that both Polly and 
Ron speak French, and therefore Spike’s cousin is Geraldine who speaks Dutch 
and Polish. Since each language is spoken by two of the interpreters, the 
second Romanian speaker must be Polly (since it can’t be Ron) and the second 
Spanish speaker must be Ron. This is the unique solution: Ron speaks French and 
Spanish.
