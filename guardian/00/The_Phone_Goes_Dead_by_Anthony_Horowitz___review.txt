 Anthony Horowitz, Horowitz Horror 2: More Horowitz Horror: v. 2: Eight 
Sinister Stories You'll Wish You'd Never Read 
Linda James is walking across Hyde Park and a stranger called Steve calls her, 
but all she can hear is scruffy voices. Then a lightning storm starts and, to 
take shelter, she goes under a tree. Still trying to work out what the scruffy 
voices are, she is suddenly struck by lightning and disappears – all that is 
left is her phone! A boy called David picks up her phone and uses it as his 
own. David's phone won't stop ringing, but these are no ordinary callers. He 
seems to have a hotline to heaven… OR HELL!

The appropriate age for this book would be 9+, only because most Anthony 
Horowitz books are gruesome. I like the book because it's spine-chilling and 
makes you want to read more. I would rate the book 10/10 because it is written 
well and I like a horror book. If you are stuck with ideas for a book you could 
read this book. If you like it try any otherAnthony Horowitz
