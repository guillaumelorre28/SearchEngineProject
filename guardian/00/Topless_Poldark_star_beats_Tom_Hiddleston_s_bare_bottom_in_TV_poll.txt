Topless Aidan Turner in the BBC1 drama Poldark has won best TV moment for the 
second year running, asRadio Times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-times> readers show their taste for 
steamy scenes.

Ross Poldark, played by Turner, washing in a tin bath topped the list a year 
after histopless scything scene from series one got the most votes in 2015

.

Another scene from the second series, in which Poldark appears to force 
himself on former lover Elizabeth, came fourth. Its broadcast led tothe BBC 
being accused of airing a “rape fantasy” which blurred the lines around consent

.

The 2,000 RadioTimes.com readers who voted were asked to choose the “funniest, 
most dramatic, inspiring and emotional moments” from a shortlist of 35.

Tom Hiddleston’s briefly bared bottom in The Night Manager came third, just 
behind the finale of the third series ofPeaky Blinders

Shelby gang were arrested.

The top-ranked sporting event was Alastair Brownlee sacrificing his chance to 
win the final race of the World Triathalon Series in Mexico by supporting his 
exhausted brother Jonny over the finishing line.

Donald Trump’s victory in the US election failed to make the top 10, with his 
acceptance speech beaten into 12th place by Mo Farah’s trip during the 10,000m 
at the Rio Olympics, which did not stop him from taking the gold.

Adele’s appearance in Carpool Karaoke on James Corden’s The Late Late Show 
came 15th despite being watched mainly online in the UK, while the top 16 was 
rounded off withDanny Dyer in Who Do You Think You Are? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/14/danny-dyer-related-two-kings-thomas-cromwell-eastenders-william-the-conqueror-edward>
