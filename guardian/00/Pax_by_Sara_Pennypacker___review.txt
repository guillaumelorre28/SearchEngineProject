Pax is a book about a boy and his pet, but the funny thing is that his pet is 
a fox!

One day Peter’s dad takes him and his fox to the woods and he leaves the fox 
in the woods on his own. Peter is very sad about this and worries about his 
pet. Peter is then sent away to live with his granddad as his mum is dead and 
his dad has to go away.

Peter doesn’t want to live with his granddad and he really wants to find Pax – 
he thinks he might be dead because he can’t hunt for food. But Pax, though very 
hungry, is still alive and has made friends with some other foxes.

Not long after getting to his granddad’s house, Peter leaves with a few things 
in a bag to try and find his fox. Although he can remember how to get there, it 
is a very long way to walk. Eventually, he falls over and breaks his leg and 
finds a barn owned by a weird lady called Vola. She helps Peter get better and 
fixes his leg so he can see his fox again.

When his leg is much better and he can walk on crutches, Peter goes to find 
Pax.
After a long and hard journey, Peter finds Pax and they recognise each other 
straight away, but Pax has a new family and doesn’t need Peter anymore.

I liked this story because it is like me and my dog. I wouldn’t want my pet to 
be sent away and I would walk a long way to find her too. The ending is sad and 
I wanted them to go home together.

I would recommend this book because the characters are very real and I like 
that it’s about a boy and his pet fox because that’s quite unusual. The story 
is happy and sad and I think many people will like it.
