Q Dear Tim, I'm going on a tour of Andalusia and feel I should take the 
opportunity to learn about the finer points of Sherry at source. Where would be 
a good place to start for a novice? Graham Coates

A Make sure you visit the Sherry towns of Jerez and Sanlúcar de Barrameda. 
Hang out in a few tapas bars (I like Bar Juanito and Las Bridas in Jerez and La 
Gitana and Bigote in Sanlúcar) and visit a couple of Sherry bodegas for a tour 
and tasting so that you can understand "flor" and the solera system, both of 
which are essential to Sherry.Gonzalez Byass <http://www.gonzalezbyass.com/> and
Hidalgo <http://www.lagitana.es/html/index1.htm> would be my recommendations. 
Also have a look atwww.sherry.org 
<http://www.sherry.org/en/intro.cfm?CFID=285098&CFTOKEN=53611964>, which is 
full of good tips.

Q I once saw someone on TV recommend Gewürztraminer with Chinese food. Since 
then I have always served this at supper parties when I cook Chinese, but it 
must be getting a bit boring for my friends. I don't drink alcohol at all, but 
do you have any other recommendations? Margaret Hung

A Gewürz is best with Thai food and OK with Szechuan dishes, but you're right 
to expand your horizons as with Cantonese food it's less successful. With this 
I would serve whites such as Grüner Veltliner, off-dry German Riesling and 
oaked Chardonnay or reds such as Pinot Noir, Gamay, Chianti and Argentinean 
Malbec.
