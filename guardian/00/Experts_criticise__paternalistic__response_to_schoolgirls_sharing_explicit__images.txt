The response of education departments around the country to teenagers taking 
explicit images of themselves and sharing them has been “woefully inadequate”, 
outdated and overly paternalistic, youth development experts say.

It follows confirmation by the Australian federal police

 last week that it is investigating a website encouraging pupils to upload 
sexually explicit images of their female, underage peers andinvolving students

 from 70 Australian schools.

Guardian Australia contacted every state and territory education department 
and asked how they educated students to respond if they received an explicit 
image of one of their peers.

In the ACT, Western Australia and Queensland, parents were described as having 
a pivotal role by monitoring their children’s behaviour on the internet outside 
of school hours. In New South Wales, students are taught the importance of not 
sharing “inappropriate images and of reporting such activity to relevant 
staff”, a department spokesman said.

Prevention by not taking the images in the first place was also an overarching 
theme among the responses from the departments, as were lessons around cyber 
safety in general.

Many departments, including the Northern Territory, South Australia and the 
ACT said schools used the resources provided by the federal government’s 
e-safety commissioner.

“One lesson within these resources focuses on the topic of ‘sexting’ and 
clearly teaches students the legalities of receiving and sending explicit 
images of themselves or other people,” a Northern Territory department 
spokeswoman said.

“In summary, the lesson explains that the production, storing and sharing of 
images of individuals under the age of 18 can amount to a criminal offence 
under applicable commonwealth, state or territory laws.”

The ACT education directorate was the only department to specifically mention 
that students were taught about respectful relationships, and safe and healthy 
emotional and sexual relationships.



Professor Catharine Lumby from Macquarie University, whose research spans 
young people, media consumption and relationships, said educational programs 
about digital content needed to start from a premise that young people will 
take explicit images of themselves, rather than telling young people not to 
snap the images altogether.

“Prevention is a pipe dream,” Lumby said. “The way adults and the people 
making policy approach these issues are often moralistic, authoritarian and 
paternalistic, and teenagers just laugh at the people who call themselves cyber 
safety experts.

“Teenagers also find it amusing that adults and experts call this ‘sexting’, 
because teenagers themselves never use that term. Parents and educators are 
just fundamentally out of touch, and we will get nowhere until we let young 
people start by telling us about their own perspectives on these practises in a 
safe and open environment.”

Lumby, who has worked with high school students and asked them for their views 
on sharing images as part of research, said young people should never be put 
down or shamed for taking the images.

“Taking these images is a very common practice, it is part of how young people 
express themselves sexually and form relationships now, and we must give them 
space to explore that safely and manage any risks,” Lumby said.

“We’re living in a fantasy land if we think stopping boys and girls from 
taking the images is the right approach.”


Good education would involve talking with students about the double standards 
around gender and sexuality, she said, and addressing the attitude that meant 
some young men were prepared to share images of women without consent and make 
derogatory comments about them.

“Girls are under enormous pressure to be attractive, but if they’re seen to be 
flaunting it, then they’re at risk of being called a slut,” she said. “Girls 
are in a no-win position. The good thing is, a lot of young men recognise that 
and don’t think it’s fair.

“Conservative attitudes about gender are the real problem here, and a lot of 
experts and educators have conservative ideological and religious agendas.”

Dr Amy Shields Dobson, a University of Queensland postdoctoral fellow and 
author of the bookPostfeminist Digital Cultures: Femininity, Social Media, and 
Self-Representation

, said part of the issue was resources provided to schools were “woefully 
inadequate”.

“So many of the resources put an emphasis on cyber safety and prevention 
without a great emphasis on ethics, respect and responsibility,” Dobson said. 
“To be fair to teachers, they aren’t given great materials to work with.”

Young people were increasingly challenging the logic and fairness of the 
narratives presented to them, she said, noting the unfairness of girls being 
labelled “sluts” for sexual behaviour that boys are rewarded for.

“What seems more difficult for youth, as for adults, is to imagine the 
possibility that girls are legitimately entitled to digitally mediate sexuality 
or express sexual desire, for example, through taking, sending or posting 
images of their bodies via phones privately, or on social network sites more 
publicly,” she said.

“Boys’ right to public bodily display and sexual ‘attention seeking’ on and 
offline is largely assumed. Tools are needed for going beyond the discourses 
available in common sext education resources to develop critiques of sexism as 
part of creating gender equity in schools.”

Dobson said education needed to explore and challenge norms around 
masculinity, and Dobson said that “sext education” needed to promote schools as 
places of friendship and support, while challenging norms around masculinity.

A more nuanced public conversation about social media as spaces of legitimate 
courtship and sexual exchange for youth was also required, she added.
