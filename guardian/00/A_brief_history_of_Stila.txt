Stila? That rings a bell…
And so it should. Founded in 1994 by makeup artist Janine Lobell, the Stila 
range was available in UK stores until 2006 when a change in owner meant a 
strategic retreat. Imagine that favourite chocolate bar you've happily devoured 
for years, almost to the point of addiction, being discontinued. Sad times 
indeed. But fear not, Stila arrived back over here this summer and hopefully 
they won't be deserting us again any time soon. Currently available online at 
ASOS and boots.com and in larger Boots stores, Stila is also soon to launch in 
Harvey Nichols, House of Fraser, and Selfridges nationwide. Hurrah!

Why is this so exciting that it warrants an exclamation mark?
Absence has made the heart grow fonder. Personally, I'm rather excited about 
the return of the Stila lip glazes (£15 each

). This was actually the first item of "posh" makeup I ever bought (ie. it was 
over a tenner) so I do have something of a soft spot for the little treasures. 
Lightweight and glossy, the colour goes on super-easy with the brush 
applicator. There are 20 shades to choose from which ups the odds of finding 
one that suits you.
 
What other products should I know about?
Stila have some fantastic multi-taskers. The smudge pots

 (£13 each, 8 different shades) work well as either an all over eye colour or a 
smoky eyeliner. The Kitten shade could also be used as a highlighter if you 
were that way inclined. And theconvertible colours

 (£16 each, 7 shades) are a splendid handbag staple for giving lips and cheeks 
a subtle colour boost when needed.
 
And what about new stuff?
There's a lovely new eye shadow palette (£25, launched August 15th, see above) 
with 10 neutral shades and a dark brown liner too. It also comes with a handy 
guide giving tips on creating different looks. So, welcome back Stila. We've 
missed you.
