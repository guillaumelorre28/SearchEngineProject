I read with increasing queasiness the story of Mark Wood, an employment and 
support allowance (ESA) claimant with mental health problems, whose death by 
starvation was largely attributable to the Atos assessment of his being fit for 
work and the subsequent stopping of his sickness benefits (Vulnerable man 
starved to death after cut to benefits 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/28/man-starved-to-death-after-benefits-cut>
, 1 March).

Years after the Holocaust, ordinary German citizens were called upon by the 
younger generation to justify themselves: Surely you knew what was going on? 
Why didn't you put a stop to it?

I hope I may crave an indulgence to use your paper to put on public record 
that I was one of those opposed to this government's policy of abscission 
against the vulnerable. I submitted to the Harrington reviews on ESA and its 
assessment processes. I inveighed against the callous manipulation of public 
attitudes against claimants by the popular press that has driven many people to 
turn a blind eye to the real agenda. And it is in vain that I now look towards 
other political parties to protect the weak, when they so obviously realise 
that the propaganda battle has been lost.

The benefits system has failed those that have most needed help for decades, 
but it has not until now sought to eradicate them entirely.

• Your article quotes a DWP spokesman stating: "A decision on whether someone 
is well enough to work is taken following a thorough assessment and after 
consideration of all the supporting medical evidence from the claimant's GP or 
medical specialist". But the DWP does not itself request medical documentation, 
and it is up to the ESA claimants to produce it. Reasons for claimants not 
doing this include them assuming the DWP has requested medical records, 
claimants not realising the importance of such records, and disability such as 
depression or psychosis resulting in default.

Assessors rely on claimants to say what their medical illnesses are, but 
claimants sometimes give the wrong diagnoses and often don't understand the 
complexity of their illnesses. Although Atos assessors fill in a "medical 
report form", Atos nurses and physiotherapists far outnumber medical 
practitioners. Even when hospital records are obtained, the 
nurse/physiotherapist may not understand important details eg that an eGFR of 
17 means that renal function is severely impaired. Without medical records, the
Atos <https://www.theguardian.com/society/atos> medical practitioner assessors 
also make decisions having woefully inadequate information. On appeal to 
first-tier tribunals, a significant proportion of sessions are adjourned to get 
medical evidence covering several years. A "thorough assessment" it is 
habitually not.

• Following the death of Mark Wood, who starved to death after his benefits 
were withdrawn, it is surely time for a citizen's arrest campaign targeting 
Iain Duncan Smith. The death of Mr Wood, who was disabled, follows the call for 
a woman in a coma to attend job training, and cuts to benefits after letters 
were sent to a blind man that he could not read. The responsibility for these 
appalling infringements of basic human rights lies squarely with the minister 
who designed and implemented the system. Could legal experts please advise on 
the case for charging him with manslaughter? I would be happy to place a hand 
on his shoulder.

• Our twin 41-year-old sons, who have learning difficulties, epilepsy and 
other problems, have just been informed that they will have to reapply for 
their welfare benefits through a process conducted on behalf of the coalition 
government by the French-owned private company Atos.

Dr Giles Youngs, who wrote a letter to the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/18/question-over-capability-of-atos>
 (19 February) about his recent resignation as a medical assessor for Atos, in 
which he referred to "unrealistic criteria, set by the DWP, for a claimant 
being awarded employment and support allowance", is absolutely right in 
expressing his concerns that people with disabilities are unlikely to be given 
even a job interview, never mind a job. Despite the Disability Discrimination 
Act, discrimination still continues, eg in February 1999 we arranged for one of 
our sons to meet the North Wales personnel manager of the Benefits Agency, 
requesting that he give our son work experience in its Wrexham office. At the 
interview the manager said that although they had given work experience to 
physically disabled people, they had never done so for a person with a learning 
disability. We heard no more from him.

What confidence, if any, should all disability welfare claimants now have of 
the work capability assessment in light of Dr Youngs' revealing and damning 
indictment of both Atos and the DWP?

• We are beginning to see the results of several years of campaigning against 
unjust welfare reforms that target disabled people. But Atos attempting to pull 
out of its contract (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/21/atos-early-exit-fitness-for-work-contract>
, 22 February) represents only a partial victory. Other private corporations 
are already lining up to take over. So long as the work capability assessment 
(WCA) regime continues, so will the misery it causes to disabled people and 
their families, and to the workers involved in implementing a system they don't 
agree with.

The WCA should be replaced immediately with a rigorous and safe system that 
does not cause avoidable harm to disabled people or those with chronic health 
issues or terminal illnesses. The UK government and opposition should follow 
the Scottish government's pledge that private for-profit companies are removed 
entirely from having anything to do with the assessment of disabled people. 
This area of public policy belongs firmly within the NHS and the public sector.

The PIP contract must be removed from Atos with immediate effect: targets in 
its handling of the WCA have affected thousands of disabled people, leading to 
hastened deaths, waits of up to a year, and leaving people without income or 
food.
