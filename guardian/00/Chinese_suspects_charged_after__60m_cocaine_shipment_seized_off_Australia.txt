The 10 crew members, all men aged between 23 and 50, were charged with 
attempting to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. If 
convicted, they could face a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The boat was first detected in international waters off Western Australia and 
was tracked south where suspicions were raised as it started circling.

Border force personnel boarded the boat, which was subsequently escorted by 
the navy’s HMAS Adelaide intoHobart

“The investigation into the origin and destination of the drugs is continuing, 
however it is unlikely that [an alleged] criminal venture of this nature would 
target the small Tasmanian market,” theTasmania

commissioner, Glenn Frame, said.

The men remain in custody after a series of brief court appearances and are 
due to face a magistrate again on 13 January.
