The piano on which the glissando that kicks off Abba’s disco hit Dancing Queen 
was played will be one of the star attractions at a rock and pop auction at 
Sotheby’s next month where it is expected to sell for up to £800,000.

 The instrument comes with a certificate of authentication from the band’s 
co-founder Benny Andersson, who describes it as “one of a kind and a great 
source of inspiration”.

It was designed by Swedish instrument-maker Georg Bolin, and comes from the 
collection of Atlantis Grammofon, formerly known as Metronome Studios, in 
Stockholm whereAbba <https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba> recorded the song 
released in 1976, Sotheby’s said.

 Bolin’s piano was built for the American jazz pianist and composer Bill 
Evans, who died in 1980. It was described in the New York Times in 1964 as a 
“apace-age piano” that “gives the pianist the sensation of playing ‘directly on 
the strings’ as a guitarist would”.

 “The piano itself is an instrument of real importance and with the added Abba 
provenance we expect it will have worldwide appeal,” Philip Errington, 
Sotheby’s specialist in books and manuscripts, said in a statement. The London 
sale is scheduled for 29 September.
