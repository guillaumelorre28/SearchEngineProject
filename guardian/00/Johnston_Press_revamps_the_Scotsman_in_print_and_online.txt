Johnston Press <https://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press> is revamping 
the Scotsman, its Edinburgh-based flagship daily title. The changes affect the 
newspaper itself and its website.

The redesigned paper and its online platform will appear on Tuesday (29 
September). At the same time, there will be a new app.

The most significant change will be to the website, Scotsman.com 
<http://www.scotsman.com/>. Having seen a preview of the beta version I was 
struck by its resemblance to the Guardian’s website (and none the worse for 
that, of course).

According to a press release issued by the company, it will be a 
fully-responsive site, meaning that it will adapt to whatever device - desktop, 
tablet or smartphone - people use.

I understand that the newspaper will also seek to be more national in outlook 
in terms of its editorial content. There will be less UK news. Instead, it will 
concentrate on what is happening inScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> and in the wider world outside the UK.

Ian Stewart, the Scotsman’s editor is quoted in the press release as saying 
that his newspaper “is part of the fabric of Scotland”, adding: “Never has it 
been more important to be at the heart of what’s going on - fuelling passion 
whilst driving discussion and debate.”

Eagle-eyed readers may also notice a subtle tweaking of the Scotsman’s 
masthead.

Johnston Press’s chief executive, Ashley Highfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield>, is hosting a relaunch 
party at the paper’s headquarters at lunchtime on Tuesday with rumours of 
bagpipers and poetry.

The Scotsman’s new-look website will act as template to be rolled out to other 
Johnston Press titles in the coming months.
