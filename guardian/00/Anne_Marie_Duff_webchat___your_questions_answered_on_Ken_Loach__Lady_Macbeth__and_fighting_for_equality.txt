Thank you for asking me so many interesting questions, and all the offers of 
drinks. I'm just so stunned and flattered that anyone would be interested in 
anything I have to say. PS: come see the play. It's really good.

For me, coming from a non acting family, a non business family, it meant going 
to drama school. That felt like my only way in, and perhaps it is the easiest 
way in because training is really important.

You really have a good sense of humor. I saw you in Wild West on YouTube. 
Would take a break from all the heavy drama roles and do comedy?

I'd love to. I find it a bit scary. I think I'm really funny in my kitchen 
with my friends. There's a lot of comedy in Oil though - I get to do some funny 
things. Write me something funny!

When I was with Dawn French in Wild West, I had a scene where I had to do this 
thing where my dress was accidentally tucked in my knickers. Being the method 
actor I am, I did it really accurately. Dawn was like: no! And tucked them in 
massively. I was like, oh sorry, I wanted it to be realistic. She said: when 
Monica in Friends came out with a turkey on her head, was that funny?

What do you think the Irish element of your background has given you 
professionally (if anything)?

It's enabled me to work in Ireland on exciting projects. My first job in 
Ireland was on an adaptation of A Monk's Women, I've worked in Irish theatre... 
I've had a double life, which has been pretty awesome.

Thank you for your work highlighting the harsh realities and injustices for 
refugees, particularly women and girls. I saw you at the Women for Refugee 
Women and CARE International UK in September where you read some of the 
testimonies of women facing danger on their journey to safety as well as their 
resilience and strength. Given the hostility to refugees by some in the media, 
do you think your activism on refugees and gender equality has affected your 
career?

I honestly don't think so. I don't see how it would, the kind of work that I 
do. I live here in this planet to have opinions too, so it's important for me 
to participate, especially for my sisters, for women. I'm fortunate enough to 
have an incredibly privileged life, I am educated, I have had the opportunity 
to be educated, I can read whatever books I want, make love to whoever I want, 
do the job I choose to, I can walk into a polling station and vote. So I see it 
as my duty to stand up for other women whose lives are not so full of good 
fortune.

This was my first animation, and I had a great time. It's a real leap of 
creative faith, but I saw the preliminary sketches and they're beautiful and 
I'm very excited to see the end result. I've been wanting to do animation for 
years, actually.

I'm disappointed and shocked, at the lack of vision. It's this lack of 
celebrating potential, again. She was innovative, what's wrong with that?

Irish roots

Lindon <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2072418> asks:

Do your Irish roots feel important to you, or do you feel more English/a 
Londoner?

I feel like a Londoner. Because I didn't grow up in an English household, my 
roots are hugely important to me, they define me and they feel and taste and 
smell like home. Most of my family are in Ireland, my best sister-friend is in 
Ireland, and it's a huge part of my life. London is where I grew up, I'm proud 
of our attitude, especially recently in the Brexit vote. I love the melting pot 
of London. It's just one of the greatest cities in the world - I think we 
forget what we have. I know it's a tough eight year old boy, sometimes living 
here. It's combative and expensive. But it's glorious and creative and cool as 
hell.

I'm so promiscuous musically, I like so many different things... I have just 
been listening to Nick Cave's Skeleton Tree album, that's my latest 
inspiration. Anyone who is a total artist inspires me - Patti Smith, Bjork... 
anyone who commits to unashamed creative energy, and the point of it, and 
celebrating the necessity of it inspires me. And it's in that Nick Cave album, 
really clearly. And his capacity to see the beauty in imperfection.

Start writing roles for black and ethnic actors, and then casting them in 
them. Colour blind casting, as well. What about the UK though? We're losing so 
many actors to America because we're not casting them in our dramas.

You used to be on a lot of TV series early on, then did film roles. Now I 
associate you more with theatre. Do you find this the most satisfying of all 
your roles? Which stage role is your favourite?

I started acting in the theatre, so it feels like home. That said, a really 
good film or TV set is incredibly thrilling. All mediums are defined by how 
good the yarn is you're telling. I just like working.

For example, when we made Suffragette, we knew that this was an important 
story. And it galvanised all the crew and cast, and made us want to do the best 
we could. In the way that a great rehearsal room is a real equaliser, it's not 
about trailer size or billing, or who's worth more. Because the story is always 
the star.

I think that television is a hugely powerful medium, and wish that artists 
like Ken Loach would have exposure on TV. I think I, Daniel Blake is a superb 
film, but the right people aren't getting to see it. Arthouse cinemas have a 
nice woolly liberal audience; Cathy Come Home was so powerful because everybody 
saw it.

I guess it would have to be the thing that you couldn't live without. 
Stanislavski says you should love the art in yourself, rather that yourself in 
the art - it's about the process of acting, not what it might be for you. Just 
loving acting in a room for five people, that has to be the thing for me. It's 
not about being a big star, because you'll only be disappointed.

For me, coming from a non acting family, a non business family, it meant going 
to drama school. That felt like my only way in, and perhaps it is the easiest 
way in because training is really important.

When I was with Dawn French in Wild West, I had a scene where I had to do this 
thing where my dress was accidentally tucked in my knickers. Being the method 
actor I am, I did it really accurately. Dawn was like: no! And tucked them in 
massively. I was like, oh sorry, I wanted it to be realistic. She said: when 
Monica in Friends came out with a turkey on her head, was that funny?

I honestly don't think so. I don't see how it would, the kind of work that I 
do. I live here in this planet to have opinions too, so it's important for me 
to participate, especially for my sisters, for women. I'm fortunate enough to 
have an incredibly privileged life, I am educated, I have had the opportunity 
to be educated, I can read whatever books I want, make love to whoever I want, 
do the job I choose to, I can walk into a polling station and vote. So I see it 
as my duty to stand up for other women whose lives are not so full of good 
fortune.

I feel like a Londoner. Because I didn't grow up in an English household, my 
roots are hugely important to me, they define me and they feel and taste and 
smell like home. Most of my family are in Ireland, my best sister-friend is in 
Ireland, and it's a huge part of my life. London is where I grew up, I'm proud 
of our attitude, especially recently in the Brexit vote. I love the melting pot 
of London. It's just one of the greatest cities in the world - I think we 
forget what we have. I know it's a tough eight year old boy, sometimes living

anyone who commits to unashamed creative energy, and the point of it, and 
celebrating the necessity of it inspires me. And it's in that Nick Cave album, 
really clearly. And his capacity to see the beauty in imperfection.

Start writing roles for black and ethnic actors, and then casting them in

I started acting in the theatre, so it feels like home. That said, a really 
good film or TV set is incredibly thrilling. All mediums are defined by how 
good the yarn is you're telling. I just like working.

For example, when we made Suffragette, we knew that this was an important 
story. And it galvanised all the crew and cast, and made us want to do the best 
we could. In the way that a great rehearsal room is a real equaliser, it's not 
about trailer size or billing, or who's worth more. Because the story is always 
the star.

I think that television is a hugely powerful medium, and wish that artists 
like Ken Loach would have exposure on TV. I think I, Daniel Blake is a superb 
film, but the right people aren't getting to see it. Arthouse cinemas have a 
nice woolly liberal audience; Cathy Come Home was so powerful because everybody 
saw it.

I guess it would have to be the thing that you couldn't live without. 
Stanislavski says you should love the art in yourself, rather that yourself in 
the art - it's about the process of acting, not what it might be for you. Just 
loving acting in a room for five people, that has to be the thing for me. It's 
not about being a big star, because you'll only be disappointed.
