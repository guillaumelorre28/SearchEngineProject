The park’s crocodile production manager, Olivia Plume, said the large adult 
male then made a break for it through the hole that had been cut. “It was a 
dangerous situation for not only our staff that had to retrieve it but also for 
the general public,” she told NT News.

Plume said anybody walking through the adjacent Holmes Jungle Nature Park at 
the edge of Darwin’s northern suburbs could potentially have been killed. The 
crocodile is an Indonesian breed, which raised concerns about an exotic animal 
roaming loose.

Plume said it was “extremely irresponsible” to climb into a pen with hundreds 
of crocodiles, with some up to 1.5m long. “They could have potentially lassoed 
a few of the animals and got them out if they knew what they were doing,” she 
said.

Plume is concerned the thieves will try to sell the stolen juvenile as a pet 
or harvest its skin.
