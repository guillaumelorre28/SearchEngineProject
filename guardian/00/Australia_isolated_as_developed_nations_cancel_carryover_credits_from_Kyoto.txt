Five big developed countries have voluntarily cancelled emission reduction 
“credits” achieved by overshooting their first Kyoto Protocol greenhouse 
targets – the same kind of credits Australia is banking to boast it has already 
“met and beaten” its international pledges.

Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain have announced they will 
cancel 634.6m tonnes of emission reduction credits they were technically able 
to count towards their targets for the second Kyoto period, in a bid to 
overcome what has been described as a giant “hot air” loophole.

Australia, in stark contrast, is banking 128m tonnes of carryover 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/27/welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-climate-talks-where-less-means-more>
 from overshooting its lenient target in the first Kyoto commitment period and 
using it to be able to claim – as the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, did in 
his speech to the Paris summit – that it is already on track to meet its second 
pledge.

“By cancelling surplus units we hope to send a strong positive signal of 
support for an ambitious global climate agreement here in Paris,” the European 
nations said in a joint statement.

Deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute Erwin Jackson said the 
European countries were demonstrating a commitment to actually reduce emissions 
by cancelling the same kind of credits on which Australia is counting.

“The Australian government has previously committed to do the same. Our 
current 2020 target is woefully inadequate. Strengthening our 2020 target 
though cancelling leftover emissions credits would close the gap between what 
we currently have on the table and what other leading nations doing,” Jackson 
said.

In the lead-up to the United Nations meeting, Australia’s environment 
minister, Greg Hunt,announced that Australia had already met its 2020 
greenhouse emissions reduction target 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/greg-hunt-describes-analysts-focus-on-expected-rise-in-emissions-as-desperate>
in large part due to overshooting its first lenient Kyoto target in 2012. 
(Unlike most developed countries, Australia was allowed to increase its 
emissions by 8% by that date, an achievement it knew it had already when it 
signed on to the pledge because it also secured special rules to allow it to 
count a reduction in land clearing that had already happened.)

Most forecasts show Australia’s actual emissions will rise by 2020. The latest 
analysis by the research firm RepuTex shows they will rise 4% by 2020 compared 
with 2000 levels, and 6% compared with today. The government has not yet 
released its updated actual emission projections.

Hunt described the idea that the government should consider actual emissions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/greg-hunt-describes-analysts-focus-on-expected-rise-in-emissions-as-desperate>
 rather than achieving a target via accounting rules as “one of the oddest and 
strangest and I’ve got to say ... desperate arguments” he had heard, and 
pointed out that the accounting rules had been accepted internationally and by 
successive Australian governments.

Asked again in Paris when Australia’s actual emissions would start falling he 
said “what matters for Australia is that we achieve our targets”.

In the Paris announcement, Germany has also promised to cancel any surplus it 
achieves in the second commitment period – out to 2020 – and not count it 
against the longer term targets being pledged in Paris.

The Australian government has promised a longer-term climate pledge of 
reducing emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030.

Hunt said that overshooting the 2020 target might once again allow Australia 
to use the accounting rules to “carry over” reductions to help meet the 2030 
target.

“The rules haven’t been set, so of course that is an option which Australia 
would consider,” he said last month.

A spokesman for Hunt said Australia would not be forfeiting its carryover.
