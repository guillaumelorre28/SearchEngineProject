An ABC investigation has cleared the satirical election program The Hamster 
Decides for broadcasting an image of a conservative columnist having sex with a 
dog, but the managing director has labelled it tasteless and undergraduate.

Mark Scott revealed the result of the internal review in an interview on 
Melbourne's 774 radio on Friday morning, explaining the program did not breach 
the corporation's editorial policies.

"I thought it was pretty full-on and tasteless and undergraduate," Scott said 
on 774. "I didn't like it."

But Scott said the segment was in context in a satirical program and he would 
defend it even if he didn't agree with it.

The image attracted only one complaint when it was broadcast to a million 
people, but after columnists started writing about it more people complained to 
the ABC's consumer affairs department.

Scott said there were parallels with cartoons in newspapers, in particular a 
similarly themed cartoon by Bill Leak several years ago.

He said the program was trying to make a point about a high-profile person and 
issue but understood how it could have caused offence.

The program from The Chaser team poked fun at conservative commentator Chris 
Kenny who told Sky News on election night that an incoming Abbott government 
should look at decreasing funding for the public broadcaster.

"They need to actually start to question the $1.1bn they throw to the ABC," 
Kenny, also a Sky News presenter, said.

Feigning agreement with the Kenny stance, The Chaser's Andrew Hansen said the 
ABC was "a network that broadcasts images of Chris Kenny strangling a dog while 
having sex with it".

A manufactured image depicting Kenny in a sexual act with a dog was then 
flashed across the screen.

Kenny is furious and has engaged lawyers, sources said.
