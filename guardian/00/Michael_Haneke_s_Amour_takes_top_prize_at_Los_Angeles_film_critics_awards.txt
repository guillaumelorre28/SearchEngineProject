Michael Haneke's Palme D'Or-winning drama Amour was named best picture at the 
Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards 
<http://www.lafca.net/years/2012.html> at the weekend.

Haneke's film about an elderly French couple dealing with the aftermath of a 
series of debilitating strokes triumphed over Paul Thomas Anderson's The 
Master, but it was still a good night for the period drama about an L Ron 
Hubbard-style cult leader. Anderson won best director, Joaquin Phoenix received 
best actor and Amy Adams took best supporting actress.

Silver Linings Playbook's Jennifer Lawrence shared the best actress prize with 
Amour's Emmanuelle Riva, while best supporting actor went to Beasts of the 
Southern Wild's Dwight Henry, a baker who made his acting debut on Benh 
Zeitlin's critically acclaimed tale of life on the Louisiana bayou. TheLos 
Angeles <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles> Film Critics 
Association handed its best screenplay prize to Ben Affleck's Argo and its best 
cinematography award to Skyfall's Roger Deakins.

Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow's chronicle of the decade-long search for Osama bin 
Laden, had to be content with the prize for best editing, but it remains an 
early frontrunner for February's Academy Awards. Last week the drama won best 
film prizes from the US's National Board of Review and the New York Film 
Critics Circle, and at the weekend it added accolades from theNew York Film 
Critics Online 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/new-york-film-critics-online-399668> and 
theBoston Society of Film Critics 
<http://www.bostonfilmcritics.org/current-winners>. Bigelow also picked up the 
best director prize from all four bodies.

Other frontrunners for the Oscar for best film include Argo, Tom Hooper 
musical Les Miserables and Steven Spielberg historical drama Lincoln, about the 
16th president of the United States. Awards season predictions trackerGoldDerby 
<http://www.goldderby.com> also suggests that The Master, Amour, David O 
Russell's Silver Linings Playbook, Ang Lee's Life of Pi and – surprisingly – 
Sam Mendes's Skyfall could all be in with a shout of a nomination.
