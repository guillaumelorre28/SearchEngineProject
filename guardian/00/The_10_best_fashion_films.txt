1 | Zoolander

“There’s more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good-looking.” 
Ben Stiller’s gleeful 2001 satire set in the vapid world of male modelling 
(tagline: “3% body fat, 1% brain activity”) saw pouting himbo Derek Zoolander 
and hippy chic rival Hansel (Owen Wilson) teaming up to defeat evil fashion 
fuhrer Mugatu (Will Ferrell). The plot bore certain similarities to Bret Easton 
Ellis’s novelGlamorama, resulting in an out-of-court settlement, but it’s 
essentially a string of glorious set pieces – notably David Bowie refereeing a “
walk-off <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8720XS-pquc>” between our heroes. It 
flopped at the box office, partly due to being released a fortnight after 9/11, 
but became a cult favourite on DVD. A long-awaited sequel lands on 12 February, 
so start practising that Blue Steel face in the mirror.

“Think pink! Red is dead! Blue is through! Green’s obscene! Brown’s taboo!” 
This classic 1957Audrey Hepburn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/19/cult-audrey-hepburn-how-can-anyone-live-up-level-of-chic>
 musical romcom, set in the haute couture worlds of New York and Paris, was a 
knowingly affectionate forerunner toThe Devil Wears Prada and TV comedy Ugly 
Betty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/08/next-box-set-ugly-betty>. 
Fred Astaire stars as photographer Dick Avery (based on the film’s visual 
consultant Richard Avedon), who is told to find a “new face” by his stern 
editor (based on Diana Vreeland). He discovers nerdy Greenwich Village 
bookstore clerk Jo (Hepburn), whisks her off to Paris and transforms her into 
the world’s hottest model. Cue catwalks, photoshoots and song’n’dance numbers 
as Dick and Jo fall in love - despite a 30-year age gap between the stars.

 Bill Cunningham New York trailer 
3 | Bill Cunningham New York 

“We all get dressed for Bill,” says Anna Wintour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/06/anna-wintour-who-is-the-real> 
in this warmly intimate 2010 documentary. Richard Press’s film profiles the 
indefatigable octogenarian who zips around the Big Apple on his beloved Schwinn 
bicycle, snapping local scenesters for his two columns in theNew York Times 
style section: On the Street (which pretty much invented thestreet style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/24/how-to-master-the-street-style-pose>
 genre) and Evening Hours (dressed-up socialites at charity soirees). At home 
in his cramped Carnegie Hall apartment, Cunningham wryly discusses his art form 
(“He who seeks beauty will find it”) and gives a tour of his filing cabinets 
full of negatives. As well as La Wintour, talking heads include David 
Rockefeller and Tom Wolfe.

Robert Altman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/19/robert-altman-genius-who-reinvented-language-of-cinema>
’s biting 1994 satire on the rag trade was shot at Paris fashion week. It found 
the likes of Julia Roberts, Sophia Loren and Tim Robbins playing 
inter-connected characters in the buildup to a catwalk show, with cameos from 
designers and supermodels. It was panned by critics – a comedown from Altman’s 
similarly episodicShort Cuts the previous year – and is best remembered for its 
climactic two-minute sequence of nude models strutting down the runway to the 
strains ofPretty <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQZmH6nwNPc> by the 
Cranberries. Distributors Miramax decided American audiences wouldn’t 
understand the French title, so it was translated intoReady To Wear for its US 
release.

 Blow-Up trailer 
5 | Blow-Up

Michelangelo Antonioni’s elliptical 1966 thriller captured the style of 
swinging 60s London, shocked middle America with its casual sex and won the 
Palme d’Or at Cannes. Mop-topped David Hemmings stars as the dope-smoking, 
Rolls Royce-driving photographer, inspired by David Bailey, who seduces a 
string of beautiful women including Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Birkin – before 
unwittingly capturing a murder on camera. Featuring a guitar-smashingYardbirds 
gig <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zeza1xeWKM> and a hip score by Herbie 
Hancock, it glamorised fashion photography as a profession and was memorably 
spoofed inAustin Powers: International Man Of Mystery. Look out for a young 
Janet Street-Porter, dancing in the nightclub scene wearing a silver coat and 
Carnaby Street striped PVC trousers. Strong look.

 The Devil Wears Prada trailer 
6 | The Devil Wears Prada

Adapted from the bestselling novel by Lauren Weisberger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/28/fiction.features> – who had 
real-life experience of being personal assistant to USVogue editor-in-chief 
Anna Wintour – this 2006 hit comedy starred Anne Hathaway as the graduate who 
lands a job that “a million girls would kill for” at powerful New York glossy
Runway. Silver-haired, Hermès-scarfed Meryl Streep stole the show as her 
demanding, ruthless boss, earning her a 14th Oscar nomination. So many 
designers lent clothes and accessories to the production – wardrobe was 
overseen bySex and The City’s Patricia Field – that it’s the most expensively 
costumed film of all time. Even Wintour enjoyed it, after attending a press 
screening – wearing head-to-toe Prada, naturally.

 Notebook On Cities & Clothes trailer

When German film-maker Wim Wenders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/mar/04/wim-wenders-retrospective-five-to-watch-one-to-miss>
 was first approached by the Pompidou Centre to make a short about the world of 
fashion, he responded: “Fashion? I’ll have nothing of it.” But Wenders soon 
relented: “Maybe I was too quick to put down fashion. Why not look at it 
without prejudice? Why not examine it like any other industry? Maybe fashion 
and cinema had something in common.” The result is this beautiful, poetic (if 
pretentious) 1989 portrait of Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto as he prepares 
for the Paris spring shows in his Tokyo studio, packed with backstage footage, 
visual experimentation and thoughtful, free-flowing discussions of creativity, 
identity and east versus west.

 Cover Girl trailer 
8 | Cover Girl

Rita Hayworth’s biggest hit was this dazzling 1944 Technicolor musical in 
which she played Rusty, a chorus girl working at a Brooklyn club run by her 
boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly), who is shot to stardom when a rich, elderly 
magazine editor who was once in love with her grandmother (Hayworth in a 
tongue-in-cheek dual role) offers her the chance to be a cover girl. The 
highlight is the Kern and Gershwin title song, performed against a backdrop of 
camera lenses and magazine covers. The score won an Oscar but the lavish 
couture is equally ravishing. Midway through shooting, Hayworth eloped with 
Orson Welles. The film also made her the first of only six women to dance 
on-screen with both Kelly and Fred Astaire.

 The September Issue trailer 
9 | The September Issue

“Fashion is a religion. This is the bible.” RJ Cutler’s 2009 documentary 
chronicles famously frosty editor-in-chief Anna “Nuclear” Wintour’s 
preparations for USVogue’s fall fashion edition – which weighed in at a 
thudding 5lb and 840 pages (727 of them ads), the biggest issue of a magazine 
ever published. Eye candy comes from the luxurious photoshoots, runway shows 
and designer cameos. Laughs are added by waspishly witty editor-at-large André 
Leon Talley. Behind-the-scenes drama is supplied by Wintour’s spikily 
long-suffering, grudgingly respectful relationship with creative director and 
“greatest living stylist” Grace Coddington – who has juststepped down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/20/grace-coddington-american-vogue-anna-wintour>
 after 28 years.

 Mannequin trailer 
10 | Mannequin

“Just because Jonathan’s fallen in love with a piece of wood, it doesn’t make 
him a dummy.” A decade beforeSex and The City, Kim Cattrall had another 
memorable fashion role as the titular mannequin in this none-more-80s romcom. 
Struggling artist Jonathan Switcher (played by the Brat Pack’s sensitive one, 
Andrew McCarthy) gets a job as a department store window dresser and falls in 
love with one of his dummies. By night, she comes to life and helps him create 
spectacular displays that become the talk of the town. It all gets increasingly 
silly, but in an irresistible climax the couple get married in the shop window, 
while grinning viewers air-punch along to Starship’s Oscar-nominated theme song,
Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wxyN3z9PL4>.
