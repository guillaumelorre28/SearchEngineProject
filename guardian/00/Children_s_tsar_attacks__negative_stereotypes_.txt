The children's commissioner for England donned a hoodie and baseball cap today 
as he laid into politicians and the media for demonising young people.

Al Aynsley-Green <https://www.theguardian.com/society/alaynsleygreen> said 
there had been "an explosion of negative stereotypes" of young people in the 
press this year.

Nearly three-quarters (71%) of newspaper articles about young people were 
negative, but only 8% bothered to quote their views, he told the national 
social services and education conference in Birmingham.

The commissioner questioned whether antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) and 
bans on hooded tops were anything more than a "sticking plaster" that failed to 
address the root causes of poor behaviour.

The professor also cast doubt over whether the government's crackdown on 
antisocial behaviour was proportionate.

He said: "I had my first cigarette at 13, my first pint at 14, and the things 
I did at 15 you'd get an Asbo for now.

"Sadly now Dennis the Menace would have an Asbo on him."

As he put on a hoodie and baseball cap, he asked the audience of social 
services managers how many of them also owned a hooded top - leading nearly a 
quarter to raise their hands.

"The best way to stop young people from wearing them is for us wrinklies to 
wear them," he said.

"I wore a hoodie in the Department for Education and Skills last week and 
escaped without an Asbo on me."
