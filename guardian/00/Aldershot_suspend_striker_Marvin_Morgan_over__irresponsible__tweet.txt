Aldershot have suspended Marvin Morgan, fined him two weeks' wages and placed 
him on the transfer list after a "foolish" comment he made about the club's 
fans via Twitter.

The League Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> club 
issued a statement after meeting the striker, who was booed when substituted 
during the club's 2-1 defeat to Hereford on Monday.

Morgan responded to the crowd's reaction by later posting a Twitter message 
saying: "Like to thank the fans who booed me off the pitch. Where's that going 
to get you! I hope you all die."

According to Aldershot, Morgan has expressed remorse, while the club branded 
the remarks "completely irresponsible".

Their statement read: "The player accepted that his conduct was totally 
misguided and inappropriate and he accepts that his actions were incorrect and 
ill disciplined.

"Accepting that his actions had been foolish he explained that they had been 
made in the heat of the moment and apologised for the distress he had caused.

"The football club are satisfied that the player meant no malice with his 
comments. However they were completely irresponsible and contrary to the values 
ofAldershot Town <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aldershottownfootball> 
Football Club. The player has also undermined the good work that he and his 
colleagues have done servicing the local community.

"The club is also of the opinion that careful consideration is required for 
all future use of social networking sites by players and staff as a means of 
communication.

"The hearing decided to fine the player the maximum two weeks' penalty during 
which time he will be absent from the club. He has also been placed on the 
transfer list."
