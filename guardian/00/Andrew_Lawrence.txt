With his coldly methodical approach to the world, Andrew Lawrence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/andrew-lawrence> is not your typical 
everyman comic. A relative newcomer, Lawrence first started getting attention a 
few years back with an act revolving around ultra-bleak guitar-based comedy 
songs that were a little like a cross between The Mighty Boosh and Bergman. 
He's now trimmed back on the music, broadening the scope of his comic canvas. 
The gloom and banality are still present, but they're now applied to explicitly 
autobiographical material rather than whimsy; familiar stand-up staples like 
childhood misadventures and romantic mishaps are present, but given Lawrence's 
own uniquely downbeat spin. This increased accessibility means that his brutal 
(and devastatingly funny) nihilism hits home all the harder. Negativity is 
rarely such an enjoyable experience.
