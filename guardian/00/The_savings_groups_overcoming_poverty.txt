In the 18 months that Judy has worked as a franchisee for GS&L, she and her 
team of five have managed to convince 7,552 people that they need to save 
together in order to overcome poverty. These individuals have formed more than 
200 savings groups. As a mother of seven, Judy was well aware of the struggles 
women face in Kenya to bring up their children, but knew from experience the 
value of owning a business. She had opened a bookshop more than 20 years ago 
with money that her husband had saved while working in Nairobi.

When she read an advertisement placed by Care International looking for people 
to promote GS&L, Judy decided to apply. "I saw it as a chance for me to expand 
my business." After the application, Judy was called for an interview and 
eventually was selected to be trained as a franchisee in Vihiga, in western 
Kenya. The franchisee model as a method of creating awareness about the project 
was in its pilot phase, but it soon became clear that it was beneficial for 
both sides. "The clients in the groups have also become my customers in the 
business. We saw that in the most remote areas, people didn't know about the 
bookshop and when I went there, I told them about what I do."

As she talks about her work with GS&L, it is impossible not to notice her 
enthusiasm, especially when it comes to figures. To date, her groups have 
managed to save cumulatively about 20m shillings (Â£127,000).
