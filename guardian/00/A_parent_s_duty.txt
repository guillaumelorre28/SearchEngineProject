Phindile Mazibuko's eyes light up as her children return home. A member of the 
Isandlwana community, widow and mother of three, she encourages her girls to 
not only complete school but continue to university. She did not graduate from 
school herself but, like many parents in her community, she sees education as 
the only way to a more fulfilling future.

Yet unlike most of her neighbours, Mazibuko has a job – cleaner in her local 
school. Her position remains voluntary, and until the government re-advertise 
the post she relies on the parent-school governing body to collect her wages 
from the local community. As it stands the Department of Education does not pay 
for cleaners or security staff in schools.

Although the community understands the importance of education, Mazibuko says 
most parents lack the skills to support their children's education at home. 
"Our schools need to teach parents how to carry our children, how to teach our 
children to go to school, how to do homework, how to talk about [the dangers 
of] HIV​/Aids," she sighs.
