Father Ted, played by the late Dermot Morgan, may have been the first to say 
“the money was just resting in my account’’, but the timelessness of this 90s 
sitcom means he certainly wasn’t the last. Craggy Island’s holy trinity of 
comedic clergymen, completed by Father Dougal McGuire and Father Jack Hackett, 
must not only contend with Mrs Doyle’s unrelenting insistence to “go on” and 
have a cup of tea, but also the overbearing, insipid and idiotic residents of 
the remote isle. These characters exist to torment the long-suffering Ted, 
especially the shrill, incessant chatter of Graham Norton’sFather Noel Furlong 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk_-E2eBrrQ>, who would test the patience of a 
saint.

“For nearly 20 years, Ashley’s been at the heart of the show and has at times 
struggled with his own demons and with giving answers to his parishioners,’’ 
says Adamskie ofEmmerdale’s vicar, Rev Ashley Thomas. John Middleton, who plays 
the character, recently announced he would be departing the show, and Ashley’s 
final storyline, involving a diagnosis of early onset dementia, will mark the 
end of an eventful tenure as the village’s soft-spoken cleric.

Stephenjameshyde suggests the “magnificently menacing’’ Caleb should have made 
our list, and this former preacher and right-hand man to big baddie First Evil 
is not your average country vicar. A serial killer with a penchant for luring 
unsuspecting choirgirls to their death with his solemn good looks, the 
misogynistic sociopath finally meets his demise after five episodes in season 
seven when our girl Buffy cuts him in half vertically with her trusty scythe, 
ironically castrating him on the way.

In its 1982 adaptation of Anthony Trollope’s first two Barchester novels, The 
Warden and Barchester Towers, the BBC presented “plenty of vicars – the sainted 
Septimus Harding (Donald Pleasence), and the oilyObadiah Slope

 (Alan Rickman), who would outsmarm Mr Collins any day of the week,’’ says 
Nimeth. The mini-series, set in the fictional cathedral town, centres on the 
lives of the local clergy and gentry and provides all kinds of innocuous 
satire, the kind of wit that sees Rev Slope remark upon greeting the Bold 
family: “Mrs Bold, Miss Bold and young master Bold. I am quite overcome with 
your boldness.’’ Ecclesiastical comedy gold.

GK Chesterton’s crime-solving Roman Catholic priest is as devoted to God as he 
is to finding rational explanations for mysterious misdeeds. Father Brown’s 
talent for sleuthing was brought to life on screen by BBC1, who created a 2013 
eponymous period drama loosely based on Chesterton’s books, while also 
including new stories. His philosophical approach is often contrasted with the 
scientific methods of Sherlock Holmes – he once commented that it’s bad 
theology to attack reason – but ensures that the criminals in his parish are 
brought to justice.

‘’Where is Nimmo? This is like listing the best Gandalfs and not mentioning 
Ian McKellen,’’ says ID8766442 on our exclusion of Derek Nimmo, the actor who 
made his name as Rev Noote in the 1960s BBC sitcomAll Gas and Gaiters 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSCxUlyiMIc&list=PLojjXPGfaTfEGAOd-hpPK3FHVU8rBWd_8>
. Rev Noote is the bumbling chaplain to worldly Bishop Hubert Cleaver at the 
fictional St Ogg’s Cathedral, where life is a rather comical affair thanks to 
the incompetence of the clergy. The series, later adapted for Radio 4, sees Rev 
Noote’s plans for a quiet life constantly thwarted by the meddlesome but 
well-intentioned Dean. The fact that it was popular with Anglican clergymen is 
a testament to its appeal.

The comedy show Scotch & Wry <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6a5RMnzba0> 
began as a series in the 1970s and went on to become a hugely popular Hogmanay 
special for more than a decade. Many of the jokes were based on Scottish humour 
and featured a number of clerics played by Rikki Fulton, with the despondent 
and ironically named Rev IM Jolly one of the standout sketch characters. In his
Last Call show, the gloomy minister recounts his week’s antics to the audience, 
monologues which often irked the church with their blasphemy.

Rev Kate Bottley of Gogglebox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/11/gogglebox-everyones-favourite-show>
, Channel 4’s addictive reality programme, has been bringing her own brand of 
comedy-with-a-collar to Friday night television. Her role on the show makes her 
a positively 21st-century vicar, but off the couch she is alsoan active Twitter 
user <https://twitter.com/revkatebottley> and known as The Dancing Vicar thanks 
toa viral video of her leading a wedding flashmob to disco hits 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfULxwy1RJE>. Often compared to Geraldine 
Granger inThe Vicar of Dibley <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgfj>, Rev 
Bottley is a real-life clergywoman whose sharp wit achieves the feat of 
transcending religion and simply entertaining.
