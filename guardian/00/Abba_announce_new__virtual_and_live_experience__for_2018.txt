Swedish quartet are pushing themselves back towards the spotlight. Four months 
after theyperformed together

Stockholm in June – they have announced that they will launch a “virtual and 
live experience” next year.

The project, in partnership with Spice Girls svengali Simon Fuller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/14/spice-girls-annie-lennox-simon-fuller>
 and Universal Music Group, is being billed as “a groundbreaking venture that 
will utilise the very latest in digital and virtual-reality technology … which 
will enable a new generation of fans to see, hear, and feel Abba in a way 
previously unimagined”.

Abba’s Benny Andersson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/17/abba-benny-andersson> said: 
“We’re inspired by the limitless possibilities of what the future holds and are 
loving being a part of creating something new and dramatic here. A time machine 
that captures the essence of who we were. And are.”

Singer Frida Lyngstad added: “Our fans around the world are always asking us 
to reform and so I hope this newAbba <https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba> 
creation will excite them as much as it excites me!”

What, exactly, the project entails remains unclear. Further details are to be 
announced in 2017, with the launch taking place in 2018.

Since their last official performance in December 1982, Abba have proved adept 
at managing their legacy – and maximising their revenues. The stage musical
Mamma Mia! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/11/mamma-mia-broadway-closing-abba-new-york>
 has grossed more than $2bn worldwide since opening in London in 1999. The2008 
film adaptation <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/10/film.reviews> 
became the highest-grossing musical ever, with a worldwide take of nearly 
£500m. The 1992 compilationAbba Gold 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold:_Greatest_Hits>, meanwhile, has sold nearly 
30m copies worldwide.

Speaking to the Guardian in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/10/abba-interview-bjorn-ulvaeus-frida-lyngstad>
, Lyngstad left open the possibility that Abba might one day record again. 
“It’s difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be: 
‘Abba is going to record another song!’” she said. “But as long as we can sing 
and play, then why not? I would love to, but it’s up to Björn and Benny.”
