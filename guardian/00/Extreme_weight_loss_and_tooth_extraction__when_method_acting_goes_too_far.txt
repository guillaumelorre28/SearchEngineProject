Marlon Brando may be the most famous Hollywood exponent of method acting, even 
if the double Oscar-winning star of On the Waterfront and The Godfather always 
refused to accept the tag. But even Brando’s efforts to prepare for a part – 
which once involved him living alongside wounded soldiers in a veteran’s 
hospital for a full month to play an injured second world war lieutenant in his 
1950 film debut, The Men – pale into comparison with those of some of his 
spiritual successors.

 In ‘living hell’ … DiCaprio in The Revenant. 
Alejandro González Iñárritu’s visually spectacular frontiersman epic was shot 
in brutal conditions in remote, frozen corners of Argentina, the US and Canada. 
But at least the film’s crew,who complained of being subjected to a “living 
hell” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/24/director-defends-leonardo-dicaprios-the-revenant-as-crew-call-shoot-a-living-hell>
 of long hours, extensive delays and temperatures dropping to -25C (-13F), had 
DiCaprio along for the ride. Perhaps with one eye on awards season glory, the 
Titanic star, who is vegetarian, chowed down on raw bison liver,climbed inside 
a horse’s carcass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/19/leonardo-dicaprio-revenant-bear-attack-stuntman-blue-suit>
 and waded through a frozen river. He did not, however, fight it out with a 
real bear: the movie’s central animal attack was Iñárritu’s only concession to 
CGI, and was shot with a rather foolish-looking bloke in a mo-cap bear suit.

Effort: 6/10

Was it worth it? Indubitably. DiCaprio won his first best actor Oscar, while 
Iñárritu took home best director and Emmanuel Lubezki won best cinematography 
for his searing camera work.

To prepare for his role as a Bible-toting tank gunner in David Ayer’s 
claustrophobic second world war drama, the one-time teen idol made himself 
hugely popular with fellow cast members by refusing to wash for four months, 
resulting in his banishment to a bed and breakfast in a remote village far from 
the production’s regular hotel. And just in case anyone imagined the 
Transformers star might not be fully immersed in the horrors of life on the 
battlefront, LaBeouf also pulled out a tooth and cut his face.

Effort: 9/10

Was it worth it? Fury was well received and LaBeouf is no longer best known 
for his role in Michael Bay’s moronic sci-fi saga. But Shia didn’t receive any 
awards-season glory.

 Fast fingers … Brody in The Pianist. Photograph: Rex Features 
Brody lost 13.6kg (2st 2lb) to play real-life concert pianist and Holocaust 
survivor Władysław Szpilman in Roman Polanski’s harrowing war drama. He also 
practised piano four hours a day until he was able to play passages by Chopin – 
all this after quitting his US apartment and selling his car to get to the 
German shoot. “There is an emptiness that comes with really starving that I 
hadn’t experienced,”Brody told the BBC 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2688547.stm>. “I couldn’t have acted 
that without knowing it. I’ve experienced loss, I’ve experienced sadness in my 
life, but I didn’t know the desperation that comes with hunger.”

Effort: 7/10

Was it worth it? Absolutely. Brody became the youngest person to win an Oscar 
for best actor and Polanski was the surprise winner of the best director gong.

More tooth pulling from Nicolas Cage in Birdy

Cage’s early effort saw the actor engage in a spot of amateur dentistry to 
play a Vietnam war veteran with horrible facial injuries. “They were baby 
teeth,” the future Oscar winnertold the Telegraph’s Anne Billson in 1985 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10155965/The-wonderfully-mad-world-of-Nicolas-Cage.html>
. “So I took advantage of it and had them out. I thought it would add an 
interesting dimension to the role.” Cage also took to wearing a bandage around 
his head during filming, which when removed gave him a sinister, sickly 
appearance due to the resulting acne and ingrowing hairs. “The reactions on the 
street were brutal,” Cage revealed. “Men and women laughing, kids staring.”

Effort: 8/10

Was it worth it? Alan Parker’s tale of blue-collar Philadelphian vets won the 
grand jury prize at Cannes, and if nothing else, helped established Cage’s 
reputation for risk-taking and theatricality.

man Brandon Teena 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/10/hilary-swank-a-long-way-to-go-before-transphobia-wiped-out-lgbt>
. Her transformation was so convincing that neighbours at the actor’s home 
thought her brother was visiting. At the behest of director Kimberly Peirce, 
Swank also wore socks in her underwear and bound her breasts, as Teena had done.

Effort grade: 8/10

Was it worth it? Swank was catapulted to overnight fame, winning the first of 
two best actress Oscars.

 Kilmer gets in the groove … The Doors. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy 
To get in the groove for the role of the Riders on the Storm crooner, Kilmer 
learned 50 songs from the band’s back catalogue and interrogated former Doors 
producer Paul Rothschild for months, learning specific intonations to help him 
perfectly channel the spirit of the 60s rocker. “Val knows Jim Morrison better 
than Jim ever knew himself,” Rothschildtold the Washington Post in 1991 
<http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-03-14/lifestyle/9103130412_1_kilmer-jim-morrison-val/2>
. “To the extent that the Doors had difficulty telling whether it was Val 
singing or Jim singing. Early on, I’d bring them into a recording studio and I 
randomly switched Val and Jim and they guessed wrong 80% of the time.”

Effort: 6/10

Was it worth it? Kilmer won praise for his performance, but critics thought 
Oliver Stone’s direction was self-important and the Doors themselves said they 
failed to recognise their former bandmate.

To prepare for his role as paranoiac ex-marine Travis Bickle in Martin 
Scorsese’s 1976 classic, De Niro lost more than two stone and drove a real New

: “Well, that’s acting. One year the Oscar, the next you’re driving a cab!”

Effort: 6/10

Was it worth it? Taxi Driver <https://www.theguardian.com/film/taxi-driver> 
won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1976 and picked up four Oscar nominations, 
including best actor for its star, who appeared in almost every scene. 
Scorsese’s fractured, dreamlike neo-noir is now considered one of the 
film-maker’s best movies.

 Holds nothing back … Day-Lewis in My Left Foot Photograph: ITV/Rex Features 
Day-Lewis is famous for overdoing it a bit, and once lived for days in the 
wilds of Alabama to prepare for his role as a frontiersman living as a Native 
American warrior in Last of the Mohicans.While shooting Jim Sheridan’s biography
 
<http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/25/daniel-day-lewis-in-lincoln-hail-to-the-chief/>
 of the paralysed Irish poet Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy, 
the English actor refused to come out of character even while the cameras were 
not rolling. In practice, this meant Day-Lewis spent the entire shoot in a 
wheelchair, occasionally having to be carried to different parts of the set, 
and even had to be spoon-fed at mealtimes.

Effort: 8/10

Was it worth it? Day-Lewis won the Oscar, but no doubt really annoyed the 
kitchen staff.
