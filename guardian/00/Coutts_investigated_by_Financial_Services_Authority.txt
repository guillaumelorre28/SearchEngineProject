Royal Bank of Scotland's private banking arm, Coutts, which counts the Queen 
as a client, is being investigated by the Financial Services Authority over the 
sale of savings products to customers includingFrank Skinner

Jeremy Clarkson.

In its half-year results, RBS said the City regulator notified the bank last 
month that it was launching an investigation into the sale by Coutts ofAIG

variable-rate fund to customers between 2001 and 2008"as well as its subsequent 
review of those sales". RBS said it was "cooperating fully" with the inquiry.

The investments went sour two years ago, when US life insurer AIG was forced 
to freeze the money during the credit crunch and had to be bailed out by the US 
government. The bonds were bought by investors including comedian Skinner, who 
lost millions of pounds, as well asJeremy Clarkson

Gear show.

Another investor, Air Miles founder Sir Keith Mills, launched a high-profile 
ad campaign against Coutts in 2008. He took out full-page ads in national 
newspapers, urging other disgruntled investors to join an action group. He also 
placed billboard advertisements criticising Coutts over the sale of the bonds 
close to its headquarters on London's Strand.

Mills says on his website that he wrote to the FSA to ask about investigating 
Coutts' sales of the product, and that he met the regulator's chief executive 
Hector Sants.

Mills, who is suing Coutts for negligence after he was advised to invest Â£65m 
of his savings in AIG Life Premier Bonds, said: "I am delighted that the FSA 
has initiated an investigation into the sale of AIG bonds by Coutts. I have 
long maintained that Coutts misrepresented the nature of the investments it 
sold to me and others."

RBS has said it made clear the investment was low-risk but not risk-free.
