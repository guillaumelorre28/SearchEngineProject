A hobbling Monica Seles was knocked out of the Australian Open this morning by 
Czech qualifier Klara Koukalova after twisting her ankle at the start of their 
second round match.

The former world number one fell to a 6-7, 7-5, 6-3 defeat after playing on 
with her left ankle heavily strapped.

It was only the second time since Seles made her grand slam debut in 1989 that 
she has failed to progress past the second round in any of the four majors.

Seles was unable to run or move freely around the court after injuring herself 
in the third game.

Admirably, the sixth seed still managed to grab the first set tiebreaker but 
struggled to stay in the match as her opponent began tormenting her by 
repeatedly dropping the ball just over the net.

Koukalova, playing in her first grand slam event, plays American Meghann 
Shaughnessy in the third round after the 28th seed beat Slovakian Ludmila 
Cervanova 6-1, 6-1.

Clijsters romps through

Kim Clijsters took just 33 minutes to thrash Petra Mandula 6-0, 6-0 and reach 
the third round.

The ruthless manner of her win - the quickest of the week so far - underlines 
her intent to make her grand slam breakthrough Down Under.

"I'm happy with my game - I'm playing well," she said. "I feel very much at 
home here."

Hungarian Mandula, who last year scalped world number nine Jelena Dokic, was 
overwhelmed by the intensity of Clijsters' baseline aggression.

The one-sided thrashing also sent a message of intent to world number one 
Serena Williams, still a little off her best, as she looks to bag the only 
grand slam not in her possession.
