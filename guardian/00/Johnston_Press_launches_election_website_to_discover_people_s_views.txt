I mentioned Trinity Mirror’s general election project last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/mar/31/trinity-mirrors-regional-papers-launch-my-manifesto-election-project>
. Now it’s the turn of a rival publisher of regional and local newspapers, 
Johnston Press, to announce an election initiative.


It is launching a site called What Matters to Me 
<http://www.whatmatterstome.co.uk/home> to curate video clips of people talking 
about the political issues that concern them.

They have been filmed by Johnston Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press> (JP) journalists taking to 
the streets of Britain and asking one basic question: “what matters to you in 
this election?”

Visitors to the site can then vote (or share) their favourites. A ‘map’ will 
eventually show which of the views emerge as the most insistent over the coming 
weeks before 7 May.

Ashley Highfield <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield>, JP’s 
chief executive, believes the site will offer “a fascinating overview of 
sentiment across the UK, outlining how it differs in the smallest of towns to 
the biggest of cities.

“More importantly, it shows where attitudes are the same – connecting 
communities not just by their location, but by what matters to them.”
