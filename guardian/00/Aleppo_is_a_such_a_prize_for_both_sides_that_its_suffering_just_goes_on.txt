Aleppo’s fate has always been at the heart of Syria’s war. The northern city 
was the biggest in the country, and its commercial hub, before fighting pounded 
whole neighbourhoods to rubble, and its streets and mosques are rich with 
historical and religious significance.

Rebel fighters infiltrated the eastern suburbs that are still a main 
stronghold nearly four years ago, and they have beenbattling the forces of 
President Bashar al-Assad

 for control ever since.

The fighting has always been intense because winning control of this city 
would be a major strategic and propaganda victory for either side.

Aleppo became infamous for the government’s use of barrel bombs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/25/syria-barrel-bombs-hundreds-locations-human-rights-watch>
 to terrorise remaining civilians, and famous for theWhite Helmets

[paywall], an unarmed rescue group who are among the few untarnished 
participants in a war that has spiralled into horrifying brutality.

The opposition was driven at first by the heady sense of possibility awakened 
by theArab spring revolutions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline>
 in nearby countries, and a conviction that in taking on Assad they had not 
just moral authority but the backing of America and its allies.

That was a tragic mistake, and has contributed to Aleppo’s destruction. While 
western leaders were eager to see Assad gone, they were not willing to make it 
happen.

Electorates in the west were disillusioned by the conflicts in Afghanistan and 
Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/armed-conflict-deaths-increase-syria-iraq-afghanistan-yemen>
, and there was neither the will nor the money to match the support Assad would 
get from his allies, Iran and Russia.

“There was a dangerous rhetorical encouragement of the opposition that was 
never matched with the means to make it possible,” said Julien Barnes-Dacey, of 
the European Council on Foreign Relations.

“Since 2011 the west has been unprepared to match its stated ambition of 
regime change with the necessary means.

“Faced with the absolute commitment of Assad and his allies to remaining in 
power, regime change was always going to be dependent on politically unfeasible 
military intervention.”

In Aleppo, that mismatch played out in a long war of attrition that saw rebels 
expand their control, at one point laying siege to government-controlled areas, 
beforeRussian air support

last year helped put government troops back on the offensive.

By February this year, the last reliable rebel route into the city was cut 
off, bringing fears that hundreds of thousands of residents who had hung on in
Aleppo could be subjected to a starvation siege 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/aleppo-under-bombardment-fears-siege-and-starvation>
.

A ceasefire brought a temporary reprieve, but as the peace talks to which it 
was tied broke down, the horror has started up again.

Last week, for the first time since the war began, Friday prayers were 
cancelled across the city 
<http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/friday-prayers-cancelled-aleppo-security-grounds-first-time-122744398>
, and a doctor from Médecins Sans Frontières told the BBC that there might be 
as few as 40 doctors left in the city to care for a population of tens of 
thousands of civilians.

A new partial truce does not cover Aleppo 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/world/middleeast/partial-truce-said-to-be-restored-in-syria-but-not-yet-in-aleppo.html?ref=middleeast&_r=0>
: the government apparently regards it as too much of a prize to halt its 
advances, particularly as it has been signalling preparations for a new 
offensive for weeks.

Western countries have failed to find or nurture opposition groups that they 
find palatable enough to support, and are unwilling to back the fighters who 
are currently holding some ground against Assad, much less provide air support 
themselves.

But with funds and weapons still trickling through from other sources to an 
opposition with nothing left to lose, neither side is likely to claim a 
decisive victory any time soon.

That means another uneasy ceasefire might be the only way to halt the 
suffering of Aleppo’s remaining civilians, even if it must be forced on Syria’s 
factions by their backers.

“The question now is whether there is any space to revive this ceasefire, in 
terms of engaging the Russians and Assad, but also managing our own 
expectations with regard to the removal of Assad,” said Barnes-Dacey. “Any 
political approach geared at saving lives has to recognise the reality that his 
backers will not accept his departure.”
