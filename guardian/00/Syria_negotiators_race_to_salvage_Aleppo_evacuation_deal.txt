The residents of besieged east Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> have endured another day of 
uncertainty and fear as a truce and evacuation agreement hung by a thread, with 
negotiators racing to rescue a deal that could save tens of thousands of lives.

About 8,000 civilians had been evacuated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/syria-ambulances-on-the-move-as-aleppo-evacuation-operation-begins>
 from the shrinking patch of rebel territory but tens of thousands more were 
still trapped when the government of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, 
suspended the pact, which was negotiated by Turkey and Russia.

The abrupt suspension resulted from the refusal of al-Qaida-linked militants 
to allow the evacuation of wounded civilians from Fua and Kefraya, two Shia 
villages in Idlib province that have been besieged by Islamist rebels for years 
and whose relief was part of the agreement, offered as a concession toIran

Also threatening the deal was the detention by pro-Assad militias of a convoy 
of 25 vehicles that was on its way out of the Aleppo enclave, accompanied by 
workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab 
Red Crescent who are overseeing the evacuation.

“Today was another difficult day for the Aleppo people,” said one teacher who 
was still in the city. “We went there from 6am until 5pm. No bus was there.”

“I have to say it to the world: if they don’t save Aleppo now, they will not 
save it forever,” he added. “Aleppo is now without any kind of life. Aleppo now 
is the place of death. The world should do something.”

The UN Security Council could vote as early as this weekend on a 
French-drafted proposal to allow international observers in Aleppo and ensure 
urgent aid deliveries. US ambassador Samantha Power said after a closed-door 
council meeting that UN officials were ready to be sent quickly. “The presence 
of independent observers can deter some of the worst horrors,” she said.

Few residents in east Aleppo could be reached because of an apparent internet 
outage through most of the day, but those who were able to speak described 
scenes of chaos and thousands of families braving the winter cold to wait for 
hours for buses to take them out of their home city. Residents faced a choice 
of making a last stand against an overwhelming force led by Iranian-backed 
militias, or surrendering to those groups, who are accused by the UN of killing 
civilians in newly reclaimed areas.

Residents have lived for months under debilitating siege and airstrikes with 
dwindling food stocks and medicine and no functioning hospitals.

“The situation of the wounded who remain in Aleppo is horrible,” said one 
rebel fighter in the city. “No medicine, no disinfectants, nothing at all. The 
situation is tragic.”

Sources with knowledge of the evacuation deal told the Guardian it had been 
suspended over the refusal of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS), a powerful 
al-Qaida-linked group, to allow the evacuation of wounded civilians from Fua 
and Kefraya.

But by the early afternoon, a senior rebel source said the al-Qaida affiliate 
had given its consent to the deal. Rebels in Idlib are part of a predominantly 
Islamist coalition, of which JFS is one of the most powerful.

Opposition activists accused the regime of detaining a convoy of 25 vehicles 
from Aleppo that left early in the morning, separating them from their Red 
Cross and Red Crescent escort, and shooting dead four people there. The 
allegations could not be independently confirmed.

If the evacuations of 400 wounded people from Fua and Kefraya were to go ahead 
as planned on Friday, it could allow the Aleppo evacuation to continue, hours 
after theagreement reached on Wednesday night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/aleppo-ceasefire-syria-civilians-evacuate>
 appeared to be on the verge of collapse.

Buses and ambulances that had been waiting to evacuate more people had left 
the departure zone after gunfire and explosions were heard.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the truce deal was the last 
hope for Aleppo’s civilians and urged both sides to abide by it.

“The Turkey-brokered truce in Aleppo and the continuation of evacuations is 
the only hope left for innocent people,” Erdoğan tweeted. “I urge all parties 
and the international community to abide by the truce agreement and support the 
implementation of the evacuation process.”

He added: “The people of Aleppo are not alone. We will do everything in our 
power to save innocent lives.”

In his final news conference before he steps down as UN chief on 31 December, 
Ban Ki-moon said Aleppo had become a “synonym for hell”. “The carnage inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> remains a gaping hole in the global 
conscience,” he added.

A rebel source said negotiations were continuing to try to rescue the deal, 
but Iran was deliberately attempting to undermine it by demanding a “Christmas 
wishlist” of concessions that included handing over the bodies of Shia 
fighters, releasing prisoners of war, and a full evacuation of all of the 
inhabitants of Fua and Kefraya.

“The recent statements that you’re hearing from the Russians about the 
evacuation being over are false, they just lost control over the Iranians and 
they don’t want to look bad, so they’re saying the whole evacuation is over,” 
the source said, referring to an announcement on Russian state news agencies 
that the evacuation was complete, despite tens of thousands of civilians 
remaining in the enclave.

“Iranian militia, with the regime, are planning a massacre in east Aleppo and 
[of] the hostages,” the source added.

The delicate operation to evacuate remaining civilians and fighters from east 
Aleppo began on Thursday and continued through the night. Turkish government 
officials said about 8,000 people had left the city to go to rebel-held 
territory in the west of the province.

A ground assault to recapture all of Aleppo, led by Iranian-backed militias 
supporting Assad, began in mid-November and had overrun more than 90% of the 
former rebel bastion before the evacuation began.

The evacuation of the wounded from Fua and Kefraya was agreed after Iran 
blocked an initial ceasefire and evacuation deal that was negotiated on Tuesday 
night.

Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> said it would convene Syrian 
peace talks later this month to be attended by Iran and Turkey but none of the 
Gulf states or western powers. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the 
talks on 27 December would complement rather than compete with the UN-led 
Geneva peace process, and were being convened on the basis of retaining Syria 
as a unitary state.

In a separate development on Friday, a girl blew herself up at a police 
station in the Midan neighbourhood in the capital, Damascus. The state-run 
Ikhbariya news channel showed blurred images of what looked like the blackened 
head of a girl in a blanket, and scenes of destruction. The Al-Watan newspaper, 
which is close to the government, said the suicide bomber was seven years old.

A witness in the area of the blast told Reuters a young girl entered the 
police station and, after asking to go to the toilet, blew herself up. The 
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said there had been an explosion and 
that there were reports of casualties.
