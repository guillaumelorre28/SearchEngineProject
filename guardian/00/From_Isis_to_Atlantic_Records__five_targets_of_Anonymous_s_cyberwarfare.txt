Anonymous <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous> is one of the 
fightiest groups on the internet. The loose collective of hacktivists,born from 
the notorious 4chan forum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/08/anonymous-behind-masks-cyber-insurgents>
, has declared war on nearly every hate figure imaginable, from Scientology in 
2008 to, most recently, Islamic State. Here are some of its most notorious 
clashes.

Isis

Why: Initially, the Charlie Hebdo murders, but the opposition was stepped up 
following the Paris attacks on Friday.
What it said: “You, the vermin who kill innocent victims, we will hunt you 
down like we did those who carried out the attacks on Charlie Hebdo.”
What it did: A crowdsourced campaign to identify and report Isis supporters 
and propaganda videos on social media, as well as bring down websites using
distributed denial-of-service attacks

Church of Scientology

Why: The attempted suppression of a video featuring Tom Cruise promoting the 
religion.
What it said: “We shall proceed to expel you from the internet and 
systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form.”

What it did: The clash led to the formation of Anonymous, and saw protesters 
outside Scientology centres worldwide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/04/news>. The church’s habit 
of filming protesters and disseminating video footage directly led to the 
adoption ofthe Guy Fawkes mask 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/30/irony-of-anonymous-mask> 
that is now a central part of the group’s iconography.

Atlantic Records

Why: The record label wouldn’t confirm a release date for a delayed album by 
the rapper Lupe Fiasco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/03/lupe-fiasco-lasers-atlantic>, 
which the group saw as censorship.
What it said: “You have 24 hours to present a statement announcing the 
immediate release of [Tetsuo & Youth]. If you do not comply, we will launch a 
direct attack against your website, your associates, and your executives … 
Blatantly censoring @LupeFiasco is inexcusable.”
What it did: In the end, nothing. Atlantic Records announced a release date 19 
hours later, andAnonymous claimed victory

.

Ku Klux Klan

Why: The group threatened to hurt protesters in Ferguson, Missouri 
<https://news.vice.com/article/kkk-missouri-chapter-threatens-ferguson-protesters-with-lethal-force>
.
What it said: “We are not attacking you because of what you believe in, as we 
fight for freedom of speech … The Ku Klux Klan is a terrorist group. The blood 
of thousands of human beings is on the hands of the Klansmen.”
What it did: A long-running campaign of deanonymisation. Anonymous has been 
attempting to uncover the identities of Klan members since November 2014, and 
earlier this monthreleased the latest tranche of accused Klan supporters.

Government of Cambodia

Why: The country arrested two members of Anonymous Cambodia over hacking 
allegations.
What it said: “You have made an enemy of Anonymous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous>. You have angered us 
considerably and we now pose a significant threat to you. You have once again 
disregarded the requests of the people, and continue to operate for your own 
unfair, selfish and pathetic gain.”
What it did: Hacked Cambodian government and military websites, and claimed to 
have stolen the data of mobile phone users from the country’s biggest carrier, 
Cellcard.
