It's a real battle when it comes to skincare for us teenagers. Finding a 
balance between gentle products and potions that will combat spots is tricky. 
It is essential to get into a regime of cleansing, exfoliating and 
moisturising, even if it seems a hassle. Gel-based cleansers play well with 
oily skin types, while those that give a creamy lather work better for dryer 
skins. It all gets a bit more interesting when you're the lucky one with a 
combination of both – the key is finding a balance that's just right for you.
