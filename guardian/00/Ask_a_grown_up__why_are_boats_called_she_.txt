Old sailors used to answer this with a sexist joke: "Like a woman, a ship is 
unpredictable." A more likely suggestion relates to the idea of goddesses and 
mother figures playing a protective role in looking after a ship and crew. 
Linked to this is the common practice of giving ships female figureheads and 
names, often after deities or members of a shipowner's family.Christopher 
Columbus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus> famously crossed 
the Atlantic in a ship called La Santa Maria, named after the Virgin Mary.

Another theory comes from the roots of language. Many Indo-European languages 
have "male", "female" and sometimes "neuter" words. English instead has evolved 
into using neuter words such as "the". So it could be that making ships female 
and calling them "she" is an example of a really ancient, English-speaking 
practice of giving a gender to an inanimate object. It's worth noting that 
Lloyd's Register of Shipping now calls ships "it".
