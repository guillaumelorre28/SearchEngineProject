Bourjois? Sounds French …
Ah oui, tres bien! In Paris way back in 1863, Alexandre Napoleon Bourjois 
created the world's first powder blush. Unimpressed with the greasy stage 
makeup he saw at the theatre, Bourjois created his alternative lightweight 
blush, which fast became the preference for performers across Paris. Word 
spread beyond the theatre walls and in 1879 the blushers became widely 
available to the public. Now, almost 150 years after its conception, the little 
round pot of Bourjois blusher (£7.49,boots.com <http://www.boots.com>) is still 
one of the brand's bestselling lines – the company shifts something in the 
region of 3.5m pots worldwide each year.
 Pot of old ... Bourjois blusher, circa 1881 
That's beaucoup de petits pots!
Yes, quite … and it's not just the blusher that comes in the hallmark Bourjois 
packaging. In the 1980s, the "Little Round Pot" range expanded to eyeshadows, 
of which there are now over 30 shades (£5.99 each,boots.com 
<http://www.boots.com>) to play with.

And what if you don't like little round pots?
Over the years, Bourjois has developed a full arsenal of makeup. A favourite 
of mine is their range of 1 Seconde Nail Polish (£5.99). I defy anyone to 
actually paint a nail in just one second without going over the lines, but for 
sausage-fingered people like myself this range does make the process somewhat 
easier. It's all down to a fan-shaped brush which means just one stroke is 
needed. Very clever.

What has it got for us to look forward to?
In October, Bourjois will be launching Smile Enhancing Gloss for lips. Yes, 
you read that right: a gloss to improve your smile. It does this not by making 
the sun come out or showing you pictures of kittens, but through a 
multi-tasking wand containing a gel to brighten teeth and a gloss to brighten 
the lips. Yes, it's a gimmick and no, I can't see it catching on, but points 
(maybe only five though) to Bourjois for still innovating after 150 years in 
the business.
