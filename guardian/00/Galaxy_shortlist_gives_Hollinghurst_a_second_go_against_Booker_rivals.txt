He might have missed out on the Booker shortlist, but Alan Hollinghurst is set 
to compete for the author of the year prize at theGalaxy National Book awards 
<http://www.galaxynationalbookawards.com/> with two writers who did make the 
Booker line-up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/06/booker-prize-shortlist-drops-hollinghurst>
: Julian Barnes and Carol Birch.

Criticism of this year's Booker judges has centred around their failure to 
shortlist Hollinghurst's novel about a bisexual poet killed during the first 
world war,The Stranger's Child 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780330483247/the-strangers-child>
. The Galaxy awards, which have announced their line-up, will allow an industry 
academy of more than 750 book experts to decide whether Hollinghurst should 
have trumped Barnes and Birch. The author of the year award also pits The 
Stranger's Child against poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy's new collectionThe Bees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/poetry/9780330442442/the-bees>, 
children's author Anthony Horowitz's authorised new Sherlock Holmes novelThe 
House of Silk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9781409133827/house-of-silk-the-new-sherlock-holmes-novel>
 and Andrea Levy's tale of the end of slavery,The Long Song 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780755359400/the-long-song>
.

The Galaxy prizes are intended to "celebrate books with wide popular appeal, 
critical acclaim, and commercial success", with categories ranging from popular 
fiction book of the year – where Terry Pratchett competes with Joanna Trollope, 
Dawn French and Daisy Goodwin – to biography of the year, where judges will be 
comparing Claire Tomalin's take on Charles Dickens with Keith Richards' look 
back at his own life.

A new "writer of the year" prize throws Booker-shortlisted authors Stephen 
Kelman and AD Miller up against the acclaimed thriller debutBefore I Go To Sleep
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857520173/before-i-go-to-sleep>
 by SJ Watson, while the international author prize is being competed for by 
Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami, Pulitzer prize-winning US novelist Jennifer 
Egan, Irish writer Sebastian Barry, Norwegian author Jo Nesbo, American debut 
novelist Erin Morgenstern and Orange prize winner Téa Obreht.

The winners will be announced on 4 November, with the ceremony to be broadcast 
over six weeks on More4.
