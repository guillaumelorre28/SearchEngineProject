The big picture

It’s Theresa May’s first cabinet meeting this morning, and her freshly minted 
foreign secretary is talking Syria with his US and European counterparts, but – 
as frequently tends to be the case these days – much attention will be on 
Labour, nursing apost-Trident vote hangover 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/18/mps-vote-in-favour-of-trident-renewal-nuclear-deterrent>
 as it decides who to put forward as the “unity candidate” againstJeremy Corbyn.

Labour MPs have until 5pm on Wednesday to nominate one of the three leadership 
candidates:Angela Eagle, Owen Smith or Corbyn (who, of course, doesn’t actually 
need any nominations to make the ballot paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/12/jeremy-corbyn-must-be-on-labour-leadership-ballot-paper-party-rules-nec>
, but probably wouldn’t mind at least a handful). Pressure is growing within 
the PLP for Eagle or Smith to make way for the other once we know which of them 
has mustered most support from colleagues – an indicative list of who’s backing 
whom this afternoon might be enough to give one of them a nudge.

Smith has said he would concede if Eagle wins more support, but it’s not yet a 
reciprocal deal.Asked at a hustings on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/yvette-cooper-calls-for-single-unity-candidate-to-take-on-corbyn>
 byYvette Cooper if the contender with fewest MPs would step aside, Eagle 
replied:

The person with the fewest nominations is Jeremy.

A YouGov poll of Labour members published in the Times today 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/corbyn-defies-his-critics-with-boost-in-grassroots-support-svmvc338s>
, though, says Corbyn would still thwack his rivals convincingly, with 44% 
saying they would definitely vote for him and another 13% saying they probably 
would.

Against Eagle, the poll of 1,019 members found Corbyn would emerge with a 
24-point advantage, 58% to her 34%. A battle with Smith would incite a little 
more wavering: 56% for Corbyn v 34% for Smith.

Corbyn is hitting back – and doing his bit for the survival of the print media 
– with a full-page ad on the back of the Guardian today, urging supporters to 
sign up inthe short window – more of a cat-flap, really – open to new voters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/new-members-may-be-barred-from-voting-in-labour-leadership-contest>
.

Written in the tone of a teacher who’s not angry so much as terribly 
disappointed, Corbyn’s ad says he’d “rather be fighting the Tories” than waging 
a leadership contest: “I want to get back to work.”

Ah, work, yes, that thing MPs do in between leadership tussles and reshuffles 
and battle bus-riding. There was a reminder of that last night as theCommons 
voted thumpingly in favour of renewing Trident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/18/mps-vote-in-favour-of-trident-renewal-nuclear-deterrent>
, by 472 to 117, a majority of 355. Among the nays, one J. Corbyn, who answered 
criticism from his own MPs that this was in breach of the party’s own 
pro-Trident policy:

Party policy is also to review our policies.

A retort that suggests there are no policies now, except perhaps for a policy 
that says policies can be changed, but then maybe you can change that policy, 
too, who knows?

There were 140 Labour MPs who voted for renewal, 47 against, and one (Rupa Huq
) who abstained by voting in both the aye and no lobbies. Shadow foreign 
secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis, having 
slammed the timing of the vote as “shameful game-playing” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/trident-vote-abstaining-nuclear-submarines>
, were marked as absent,along with seven other members of the shadow cabinet 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-mps-vote-for-to-renew-trident-with-new-submarines-jeremy-corbyn-votes-against_uk_578d4170e4b0885619b103a6?37arwejm45nd59izfr&utm_hp_ref=uk>
, and presumably will need to bring in a note from a parent today.

Plus one Tory MP risks having his phone confiscated:

Fifteen minutes into the PM's Trident speech, and backbench MP David Cameron 
gets bored and surreptitiously pulls out his iPhone.

See how MPs from all parties voted here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/19/trident-how-your-mp-voted>. 
Some 58 of Scotland’s 59 MPs (there’s one Tory MP in Scotland, 
non-coincidentally) voted against the renewal of Trident, giving the SNP afresh 
chance to dangle the prospect of a second independence referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/19/snp-push-again-for-scottish-independence-vote-after-trident-result>
 – a move that could potentially seesubmarines evicted from Faslane

.

Does anyone have a Brexit plan yet?

On the subject of evictions … the high court today will hear a legal challenge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/government-awaits-first-legal-opposition-to-brexit-in-high-court>
 over whether parliament – and not simply a nod from the prime minister – can 
set in motion article 50, the instrument that starts the two-year countdown to 
Britain’s actual, you-really-have-to-leave-now exit from the EU.

Two senior judges, Sir Brian Leveson (remember him? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry>) and Mr Justice Cranston, 
will hear the case brought byDeir Dos Santos, which claims the notification of 
withdrawal “can only be given with the prior authorisation of the UK 
parliament” and not, as the government argues, by royal prerogative.

Whichever side you’re on, don’t prepare the victory bunting just yet: this is 
a preliminary hearing. But the judges could allow a full hearing, perhaps in 
the autumn, and might ask that this case be combined withanother challenge that 
is also underway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/03/parliament-must-decide-whether-or-not-to-leave-the-eu-say-lawyers>
.

Meanwhile, as May holds her first cabinet meeting this morning, she is keen to 
stress that her premiership won’t be all about Brexit, while making it sound 
all about Brexit:

It will be the responsibility of everyone sitting around the Cabinet table to 
make Brexit work for Britain …

We will not allow the country to be defined by Brexit; but instead build the 
education, skills and social mobility to allow everyone to prosper from the 
opportunities of leaving the EU.

But new cabinet squabbles have already begun, with the Times reporting 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/hands-off-our-staff-foreign-office-tells-brexit-secretary-6hr8r55tc>
 a “my ministry’s bigger than your ministry” spat, as Brexit secretaryDavid 
Davis seeks to lure foreign office staff over to his new digs, which he has 
labelled “the place to be”. LikeClub Tropicana 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYX0sjP6Za8>, all that’s missing is the E(U).

Is she personally prepared to authorise a nuclear strike that can kill a 
hundred thousand innocent men, women and children?

May’s response:

Yes.

In the Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/liz-truss-is-entirely-unsuited-to-the-job-of-lord-chancellor-p6d67rclb>
,Lord Falconer, a former lord chancellor, says Liz Truss, the newly appointed 
lord chancellor, is not legally eligible for the role:

 The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 said that the prime minister could only 
appoint someone who appears to be qualified by experience. The lord chancellor 
is the only job in cabinet where there are personal conditions, laid down by 
statute, which have to be satisfied by the holder.


There is no one who could possibly suggest that Ms Truss met the bar set by 
that law. I wonder if the prime minister was even told about the statutory 
requirements before she appointed her.

So the prime minister broke the law in appointing Ms Truss, but more 
importantly showed she did not regard protecting the rule of law as a priority 
at all in making her cabinet.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/owen-smith-to-offer-referendum-on-brexit-deal-if-elected-labour-leader>
 on Brexit:

 What Owen Smith and other Leave deniers clearly believe, however, is that 
millions of voters have taken an ill-informed and reckless decision, one that 
proper grown-ups should have the chance to revoke. But instead of trying to put 
the sand back into the egg-timer, perhaps they should consider that for many 
Brexiters, their choice will have been as considered and closely argued as that 
of EU champions and liberals.

In terms of their own lives, leaving Europe and seeing an end to freedom of 
travel, or trade tariffs, or whatever else they object to, is obviously 
preferable. Who are Mr Smith and people like me to say that their view is less 
valid than ours, or that in their situation we might not feel the same? Are the 
majority of those 17.4 million far worse educated than the 16 million 
Remainers? It’s unlikely.

Maïa de la Baume, writing for Politico 
<http://www.politico.eu/article/foreign-secretary-boris-johnson-diplomat-eu-referendum-brexit/>
, says Britain’s new foreign secretary emerged from his first Brussels meeting 
unscathed:

 On Monday, [Boris] Johnson was gaffe-free and trying his best to be 
statesmanlike and switching between English and French. He told reporters the 
UK would maintain a ‘leading role’ in Europe and was not going to abandon it 
‘in any way’ after leaving the EU …


There was even praise for the way in which Johnson spoke about the events in 
Nice. ‘Johnson spoke without looking at his notes at all,’ said another 
European diplomat. ‘He spoke in good French, saying the British people would 
stand united behind the French.’

us, say Italy’s on-the-rise Eurosceptics
