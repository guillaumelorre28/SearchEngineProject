A break clause is a term in a tenancy agreement that allows a tenant to leave 
before the tenancy period comes to an end, without incurring any financial 
penalty.

If such a clause is not included in a tenancy for a fixed period - for example 
six months - the tenant is usually responsible for the rent for the whole 
period, even if they move out before that period ends.
