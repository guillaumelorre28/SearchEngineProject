A video montage was played at the opening ceremony and a moment of silence was 
held in memory of the seven-time major champion, who played on six victorious
Ryder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> teams and captained one.

“We have a captain working for both teams, our friend Arnold Palmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/arnold-palmer>,” Love said. “Arnold was my 
captain 20 years ago at the Presidents’ Cup and he loved team play. His 
enthusiasm touched all of us. Arnold, this one’s for you.”

Europe’s captain, Darren Clarke, paid tribute on behalf of his team, saying: 
“We have lost a true legend. The thoughts of everyone of Ryder Cup Europe are 
with Arnold’s family at this time.”

Palmer’s close friend Jack Nicklaus echoed Love’s sentiments. “We all feel his 
loss and we dedicate these games to his honour,” he said.
