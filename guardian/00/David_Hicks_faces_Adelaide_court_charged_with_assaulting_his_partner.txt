Former Guantánamo Bay <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/guantanamo-bay> 
detainee and terror suspect David Hicks has faced court in Adelaide charged 
with assaulting his partner.

Hicks, who spent five years in the US prison camp, appeared in the Elizabeth 
magistrates court on Tuesday over an assault charge. He is accused of 
assaulting his partner at Craigmore in September 2016. He did not enter a plea 
and his case was adjourned to 28 February.

The magistrate did not allow journalists inside the court for the pre-trial 
conference.

“I’m here to see my dad. He works here,” Hicks told reporters as he arrived at 
court wearing jeans and a grey, collared shirt.

Hicks, 41, married human rights activist Aloysia Brooks after his release from 
prison but the couple has since split and the alleged assault victim is another 
woman.

Hicks was picked up in 2001 by US forces in Afghanistan, where he joined an 
al-Qaida training camp, and detained at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba until 2006.

He pleaded guilty in 2007 to providing material support for terrorism in a 
deal that allowed most of his seven-year sentence to be suspended and for him 
to return to Australia. The terrorism conviction was appealed in 2013 and 
overturned by a US military court in 2014, bringing an end to the long legal 
saga.
