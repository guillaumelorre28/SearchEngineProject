Hello guzzlers,

Last week some of the smartest sixth formers in the country sat Oxford 
University’s annualMathematics <https://www.theguardian.com/science/mathematics>
 Admissions Test. For today’s puzzle I’ve chosen one of its most fun questions 
from recent years.

It has five parts – successful applicants scored 4.73 on average out of the 5. 
So you need to get them all right!

(Logic puzzles like this one involving people wearing hats who can see only 
other people’s hats date from the 1930s. But logic puzzles as a genre date back 
at least to the time of Charlemagne. My new bookCan You Solve My Problems? 
<http://amzn.to/2f3GJNd> tells the history of puzzles in 125 brainteasers, and 
in it you’ll find lots more like this one to chew on.)

Now hold on to your hats!

Alice, Bob and Charlie are well-known expert logicians; they always tell the 
truth. They are sat in a row, as illustrated above. In each of the scenarios 
below, their father puts a red or blue hat on each of their heads. Alice can 
see Bob’s and Charlie’s hats, but not her own; Bob can see only Charlie’s hat; 
Charlie can see none of the hats. All three of them are aware of this 
arrangement.


(i) Their father puts a hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of your 
hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat.” Alice then says 
“I know the colour of my hat.” What colour is each person’s hat?

(ii) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and again says: “Each 
of your hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat.” Alice 
then says “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” Bob then says “I don’t know the 
colour of my hat.” What colour is Charlie’s hat?

(iii) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of 
your hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat, and at 
least one of you has a blue hat.” Alice says “I know the colour of my hat.” Bob 
then says “Mine is red.” What colour is each person’s hat?

(iv) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of 
your hats is either red or blue. At least one of you has a red hat, and at 
least one of you has a blue hat.” Alice then says “I don’t know the colour of 
my hat.” Bob then says “My hat is red”. What colour is Charlie’s hat?

(v) Their father puts a new hat on each of their heads and says: “Each of your 
hats is either red or blue. Two of you who are seated adjacently both have red 
hats.” Alice then says “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” What colour is 
Charlie’s hat?

If you want to find the answers now - please submit your answers below. In 
each case write down onlythe colour of Charlie’s hat. 

I’ll be back at 5pm GMT with a full explanation of the answers, and also the 
results of how well you all did. How many of you are Oxbridge material?!UPDATE: 
Results and explanations now up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/07/did-you-solve-it-would-you-get-into-oxbridge>
.

And, **PLEASE**, no spoilers until the answers are up! Don’t ruin everyone 
else’s fun. There are lots of other things to comment on, such as why the hats 
drawn in maths questions are always pointy ones, or what are the chances of 
having three expert logicians in the same family.
