Awards season is now upon us and here, as every year, is my personal fantasy 
award nomination list for 2013, whimsically called the Braddies, which covers 
the period running from the beginning of the calendar year to the present. 
There are 10 nominations in eight categories: film, director, actor, actress, 
supporting actor, supporting actress, screenplay and documentary.

The reader is invited to nominate the winner in the comments section below, 
and perhaps to note omissions and evidence that the list betrays suggestions of 
sociocultural bias.

I like to think that these awards will one day evolve into an actual ceremony 
with chrome-and-glass statuettes, sponsorship from Sky Atlantic and a televised 
evening presided over byDara Ó Briain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dara-o-briain> or Mariella Frostrup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mariellafrostrup>. But until then, it 
exists in a world of fantasy only. And so, the excited chatter from guests at 
the Grosvenor House hotel in central London dies to a quiet … The stage lights 
dim … Dara or Mariella takes to the stage …And the nominees are….
