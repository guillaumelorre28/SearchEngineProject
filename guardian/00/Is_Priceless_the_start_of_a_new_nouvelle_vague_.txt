Gold-digger with a heart ... Audrey Tautou 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/audrey-tautou> in Priceless

Priceless, a delightful French comedy <http://www.pricelessmovie.co.uk> about 
an innocent hotel waiter who falls for the charms ofAudrey Tautou's 
gold-digging femme fatale 
<http://blogs.theguardian.com/film/2008/06/film_weekly_meets_audrey_tatou.html>
, is a fun and fluffy comedy of manners that is breaking new ground in the UK. 
Gallic features making it big on this side of the Channel tend to fall into two 
categories: the well-made, serious film with a message about the human 
condition (Hidden 
<http://film.theguardian.com/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1697178,00.html>
, The Beat that My Heart Skipped) or the movie which perpetuates the clichés 
les rosbifs have of the frogs (Amélie).

Those which don't make it on to the Eurostar are generally genre movies: cop 
thrillers, family dramas, and especially, comedies. Countless Gallic comedies 
that have thrilled millions of French cinemagoers never make it to the UK. 
Take, for instance, OSS 117: Le Caire Nid D'Espions (OSS 117: Cairo Nest of 
Spies), a French piss-take of the James Bond films - you will never look at 
Sean Connery in the same way again.

Tautou is brilliant in Priceless, killing off her sugary sweet image as 
Amélie. One could argue that the film perpetuates a certain cliché, as it's 
about French people having lots of sex and it takes place on the Riviera. But 
it is unlike anything Brits can catch at the multiplex. So bonne chance 
Priceless! Hopefully it will mark the start of more varied French fare here.
