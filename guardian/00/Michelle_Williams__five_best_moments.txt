Michelle Williams, currently starring as good witch Glinda in Oz the Great and 
Powerful, has racked up an impressive filmography since first coming to public 
attention for her role in Dawson's Creek (although some film fans might also 
remember a few notablepre-Dawson roles <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931329/>).

Here's some highlights from her film career, including recommendations from

1. My Week with Marilyn

Michelle played Marilyn Monroe opposite Kenneth Branagh's Laurence Olivier, in 
a film charting the making of ill-fated light comed The Prince and the Showgirl.
In his review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/nov/24/my-week-with-marilyn-review>, Peter 
Bradshaw said: "In art as in life, Olivier's spotlight is taken away by 
Marilyn, played terrifically well by Williams: this is a figure she recreates, 
not by hamming up the pouty lips and breathiness, but the scared and brimming 
eyes, wide with unshed tears."

3. Wendy and Lucy

Michelle is Wendy, Lucy her pet dog, and the two of them are on a road trip to 
Alaska on a tight budget. That might sound like the makings of a family comedy 
– instead, it's a quiet, melancholy film about loneliness, poverty and 
desperation, entirely carried by its star's performance.
