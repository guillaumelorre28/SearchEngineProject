<https://www.theguardian.com/film/helena-bonham-carter> and the voice of 
Barbara Windsor return, while Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen (playing Time) 
join the cast.

this time. So there’s a level of comfort going into something like this.”

Alice Through the Looking Glass is released in US and UK cinemas on 27 May 
2016.
