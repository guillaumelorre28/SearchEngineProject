If your main experience of Arthur Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/arthur-smith> comes from his appearances 
among the armchair wits and sworn enemies of thought that make up the cast of 
BBC2's Grumpy Old Men, you might get the impression that he's now a fairly 
safe, faintly dated relic from the dawn of alternative comedy. In fact, away 
from the small screen, Smith stands out among his generation for a willingness 
to keep pushing himself and experimenting with new forms of comedic expression. 
Past Smith projects have included a one-man show wringing jokes out of the not 
notoriously humorous songs of Leonard Cohen, and the annual Arturart gallery at 
the Edinburgh Fringe, which features a huge array of Smith's unserious, 
self-deflating artworks (last year's collection included giant blow-ups of 
letters from Smith's landlord asking him to turn the noise down). This tour 
offers audiences another chance to see why today's hottest young comics still 
see him as an inspiration.
