Hello guzzlers,

As schools break for summer holidays and some of us fly abroad to a newly 
expensive world, here’s a puzzle that at least may improve the journey out. 
It’s a conundrum you may have asked yourself the last time you took a plane.

You are in an airport, and you are walking from security to your gate. The 
distance includes stretches of travelator, or moving walkway, and stretches of 
floor. You have a constant walking speed,u, and the travelators also have 
constant speed,v. So, when you are on the travelator you are traveling at u + v.

1. You need to stop to tie your shoe. If tying your shoe always takes the same 
time, will you get to the gate quicker if you tie your shoe on the travelator, 
off the travelator or does it make no difference?

2. You have enough energy to walk at faster speed, w, for a fixed time. In 
order to get to the gate quicker, do you increase your speed when you are on 
the travelator, off the travelator or does it make no difference?

I’ll open the comments at noon, and will post my answers at 5pm. The 
submissions here are for me to see how well you do.


Today’s puzzle was devised by the mathematician Terence Tao. More about him 
when I post the solutions.
