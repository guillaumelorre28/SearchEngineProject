The Malaysian opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-ibrahim>, has won a defamation suit 
against a government-linked newspaper publisher over an article that, he said, 
portrayed him as untrustworthy. Anwar sued the New Straits Times Press, 
claiming that a 2002 article examining his ties to a US thinktank made him seem 
like an "American agent" who was unprincipled and disloyal to Malaysia. The 
newspaper argued it was only reporting the contents of a foreign magazine 
article about Anwar. The high court ordered the newspaper's publisher to pay 
him 100,000 ringgit (Â£17,800) in damages. A representative of the publisher's 
legal team said they had not decided whether to appeal.

Anwar was Malaysia's deputy prime minister from 1993 until 1998 when he was 
ousted after falling out with the then leader, Mahathir Mohamad. In 1999 he was 
sentenced to six years imprisonment for corruption followed in 2000 by a 
nine-year sentence for sodomy. He claimed the government fabricated the charges.

Anwar was freed from prison in 2004 when Malaysia's top court overturned the 
sodomy conviction. Soon after, he built an alliance out of three opposition 
parties that wrested one-third of the seats in parliament in last year's 
general elections. It was the ruling coalition's worst performance during its 
five decades in power.

Most mainstream media in Malaysia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia> 
are controlled by, or closely linked, to parties in the ruling coalition.
