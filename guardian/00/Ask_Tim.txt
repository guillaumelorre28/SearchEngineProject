Q Years ago I had a delicious wine from New Zealand. It was from Gibbston 
Valley. Is it available in the UK?
Marius Abramczuk

A Gibbston Valley is currently "seeking representation" in the UK. Good 
alternatives, also from Central Otago, are Rippon from Lea & Sandeman (020 7244 
0522), Mount Edward from Jeroboams (020 7730 8108) and Bald Hills and Mount 
Difficulty, both from Ellis of Richmond (020 8744 5550).

Q Dear Tim, I want to start a wine collection on a budget and am looking to 
spend between £10 and £20 per bottle. I prefer reds, but would like to include 
some whites. I would like to keep the wines for some years if possible but am 
not in it for an investment... Just to get a nice stock of good wines. Any 
advice?

A The first thing to do is find yourself a wine merchant you trust. Berry 
Brothers (bbr.com <http://www.bbr.com>), The Wine Society (winesociety.com 
<http://www.thewinesociety.com>) and Tanners (tanners-wines.co.uk 
<http://www.tanners-wines.co.uk>) all have very good general lists. At the 
prices you are talking about, I'd avoid most Bordeaux and red Burgundy and 
concentrate on the Loire, the Rhône, Chile, Argentina, Australia, southern 
Italy, South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, Portugal and Spain. Make sure you 
buy wines with different windows of maturity so that you stagger your drinking.
