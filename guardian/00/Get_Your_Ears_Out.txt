"About the hack - A website plugin to provide relevant 7digital MP3 streaming 
and Guardian Music News to users. The plugin searches for known music artists 
within any website's content, and adds links to streaming MP3 and Music News 
content via a little overlay box.

Why did you create it? - To test out the 7digital and Guardian news APIs, and 
build something that may be useful to users, and to website owners as an easy 
way to integrate 7digital MP3 links, potentially a nice revenue generator!"
