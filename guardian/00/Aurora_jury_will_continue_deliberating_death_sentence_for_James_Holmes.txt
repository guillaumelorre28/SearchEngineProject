Judge Carlos Samour read the jurors’ verdict one-by-one on Monday, saying each 
of 12 deceased victims’ names before reading the verdict related to their 
murder.


Jurors had the option of deciding if the mitigating factors of the crime 
outweighed certain aggravating factors, which would have allowed them to 
sentence Holmes to life in prison without the option of parole. They will now 
move on to the third phase of sentencing.

Jurors reached the verdict in the second phase of the case on Monday, after 
less than a half a day of deliberation, Reuters reported. Deliberations began 
on Thursday, after a panel of nine men and three women determined that there 
were aggravating factors to Holmes’s crimes, a finding necessary to sentence a 
defendant to death in Colorado.


Holmes has already been convicted of 165 counts against him, including 24 
counts of murder, attempted murder and a weapons charge. In the second phase of 
sentencing, which Monday’s verdict represents, defense attorneys attempted to 
convince jurors thatmitigating factors such as mental illness

 should spare Holmes from the death row.

Prosecutors are reportedly planning to call up to 15 victims of the shooting 
in the third phase, when jurors begin considering how to punish Holmes for his 
crimes.
