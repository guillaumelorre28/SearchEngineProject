André Villas-Boas <https://www.theguardian.com/football/andre-villas-boas> 
will look to "refresh his batteries" before considering a return to football 
after being sacked by Tottenham.

The 36-year-old former Porto and Chelsea manager left White Hart Lane on 16 
December following inconsistent results despite more than £100m spent on 
players after the summer departure of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for a world 
record fee.

Villas-Boas was linked with an immediate return to the Premier League at West 
Bromwich Albion but he needs an extended time away before considering where his 
next position within football will be.

"I have decided to take a break. I want to learn a bit and refresh my 
batteries, but I can't imagine a life without football," Villas-Boas told 
Abendzeitung Munich during a visit to Bayern Munich's winter training camp in 
Qatar.

"I have learnt that it [next job] has to fit 100%, and the club has to value 
the coach."

Villas-Boas was impressed by the work of the Bayern coach Pep Guardiola 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/pep-guardiola>. He said: "His legacy is 
already huge, he is highly valued by every coach in the world. It is an honour 
for me to look over his shoulder

"He has changed football. The way it should be played. He has opened the 
world's eyes. If you look how the top teams in Europe are playing, you see the 
inspiration he gave with Barcelona."
