The distinctive jangle of the Rickenbacker on Mr Tambourine Man wasn't 
actually the invention of the Byrds. The Beatles had already been there: the 
Byrds had heard George Harrison's outro to A Hard Day's Night and decided a 
clever band could base a whole career around it. But the Byrds became 
touchstones for indie pop. Not for nothing didEdwyn Collins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/edwyn-collins> later sing: "I wore my fringe 
like Roger McGuinn's."
