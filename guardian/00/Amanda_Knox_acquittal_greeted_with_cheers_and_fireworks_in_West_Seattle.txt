In West Seattle, where Amanda Knox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amanda-knox> grew up, the news of her 
acquittal by Italy’s highest court was accompanied by the sound of fireworks 
echoing across the water.

“I’m just ecstatic,” said Karen Pruett, a longtime friend of the Knox family. 
“The Italian courts did the right thing. It was very difficult for them, and we 
understand that, but we’re beyond pleased that they chose justice and truth.”

As the sound of cheers and celebrations filtered out to the terrace from the 
restaurant inside, Pruett said she thought the Knox family were feeling 
“jubilant and relieved and buoyant,” but also probably exhausted. “It was a 
long and excruciating and twisted journey,” she said.

“To say the least”, interrupted Al Semple from West Seattle, a longtime Knox 
supporter who along with Julie Rogers organised the earliest fundraisers for 
Knox at this restaurant by the bay.

Through her lawyer, Knox gave the Guardian a statement upon learning the news 
of her acquittal, saying she was “tremendously relieved and grateful”. “The 
knowledge of my innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of this 
ordeal. And throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from 
family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say, thank you from the bottom of my 
heart. Your kindness has sustained me. I only wish that I could thank each and 
every one of you in person.”

 Exclusive video interview with Amanda Knox. 
Her family expressed “profound gratitude” to those who supported Knox, and 
said they were “thrilled with and grateful for” the Italian supreme court’s 
decision.

Pruett said she hoped the pursuit of justice for Meredith Kercher’s family 
would continue. “In my opinion,” she told the Guardian, “the case file needs to 
be reopened and examined carefully, so that the proper information is given to 
the Kerchers and they get their questions answered.”

“Thank God it’s over – they can get on with their lives,” said Candace 
Dempsey, the author of Murder In Italy, a book about the case, who was also 
celebrating at the restaurant. “I’m very pleased and very surprised. Usually 
I’m an optimist, but I was sure this was going against them. I think it’s a 
brilliant move byItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>. They’ve 
averted a diplomatic crisis that no one needed. I couldn’t be happier that two 
innocent people are going free.

“I never thought when I wrote my book that this would happen. I’m so happy.”

Dempsey is also hopeful that the online abuse she said she has suffered from 
those who insisted Knox was guilty will come to an end. “I just hope the 
‘guilters’ can go home now, and this tragic saga will be over at last,” she 
said. “It’s made me an admirer of Italian justice.”
