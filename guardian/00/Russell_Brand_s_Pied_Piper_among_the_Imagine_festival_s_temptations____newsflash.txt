We are very excited to be the first ones to tell you what’s happening at the 
Imagine children’s festival <http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/imagine> 2015, 
which is held at the Southbank Centre in London from 9-22 February.


So here, drum roll…, are just some of the highlights:


 * Judith Kerr, the beloved author of The Tiger Who Came To Tea 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tiger-who-came-to-tea-9.html>, who will read 
from her semi-autobiographical book for older childrenWhen Hitler Stole Pink 
Rabbit <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/when-hitler-stole-pink-rabbit.html>
 This year’s festival will be graced with a rare appearance from Judith Kerr.

 * Russell Brand will be giving an enthusiastic (or even slightly giddy) 
reading of his first children’s bookThe Pied Piper of Hamelin 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/russell-brand-s-trickster-tales-the-pied-piper-of-hamelin.html>
 – with Chris Riddell providing mesmerising live illustration 
 * They’ll be readings and events with authors including Philip Ardagh, Cerrie 
Burnell, Steven Butler, Cathy Cassidy, Lauren Child, Jonny Duddle, Neil 
Griffiths, Petr Horacek, Anthony Horowitz, Gareth P Jones, Liz Pichon, Kate 
Saunders, Axel Scheffler, Helen Skelton, Holly Smale, Jeremy Strong, Guardian 
children’s fiction award winner Piers Torday, Philip Womack and David

Allen Anderson, Suzanne Barton, Jennifer Gray, Jane Bull, Benji Davies, Sarah 
Dennis, Emma Dodd, William Grill, Faye Hanson, Hilda Offen, and Gary Parsons 
 * More fun with book-inspired theatre including Charlie and Lola’s Best 
Bestest Play and gorgeous theatre installations to celebrate Alice In 
Wonderland’s 150th anniversary, which is celebrated in 2015 
 * … and if the days at the festival just aren’t long enough, children are 
also invited to The Big Sleepover right on the Royal Festival Hall stage  Last 
year children got to hop into Grandpa Joe’s Giant storytelling bed. There will 
be more wonders in 2015. Photograph: Southbank Centre 
The festival is in London, so the Guardian children’s books site is joining in 
online so young people all over the world can take part in the mega literary 
fun. We’ve asked the children who make up the Festival Ideas Cloud (and decide 
what goes on at the festi) to guest edit the site for one week from 14 February 
2015.

Super fans of Guardian children’s books may remember that the Festival Ideas 
Cloud did the same last year –catch up with everything they did here
