The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> is to pay Â£50,000 libel 
damages to the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda over news items suggesting 
he had expropriated "enormous" sums of money from his country's health care 
funds and spent it on parties.

A high court judge heard today that Radio 4's highly respected Today programme 
and the World Service both ran stories in July alleging Lester Bird took more 
than $200m of public money and spent it on parties, presents, foreign trips and 
cosmetic surgery for friends and colleagues.

The Today item also suggested he had been involved in gun-running and drug 
trafficking.

But in a humiliating climbdown the BBC today apologised in court and agreed to 
pay damages and full legal costs. It will also broadcast an apology on Today.

The allegations followed a commission of inquiry held in Antigua into the body 
that administers the country's medical benefits scheme.

The commission found evidence of widespread maladministration and misconduct. 
But the inquiry did not find that Mr Bird had misappropriated any funds or was 
guilty of misconduct, said his counsel, Tom Shields QC.

No such allegations had been made during the investigations. Nor had the 
British or American authorities ever accused him of trafficking in arms and 
drugs, as alleged on Today.

To be falsely condemned here and abroad by an influential broadcaster, 
renowned for the accuracy of its news, had been an unpleasant experience for Mr 
Bird, the court heard.

Not least of his concerns was the poor image created of his country and the 
damage that might have been done to its economically important tourist 
industry, Mr Shields told Mr Justice Gray.

A spokesman for the BBC said: "We will look into how it happened but it would 
be wrong to say there was an investigation."
