Kurt Walker has a number of claims on the history of hip-hop. Under the 
moniker Kurtis Blow, he was the first rapper to sign to a major label, Mercury. 
He was the first to embark on a national tour. He was also the first rapper to 
appear on network television, performing The Breaks. Built around a series of 
disco breaks, but also bemoaning the bad luck a person can have in love, Blow's 
Soul Train show (in suit jacket with nothing underneath) helped to catapult The 
Breaks to gold record status â€“ another first.
