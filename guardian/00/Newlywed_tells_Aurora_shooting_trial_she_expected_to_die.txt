“I didn’t know if it was the last time I would be able to do so,” Denise 
Axelrod told the jury.

Axelrod testified on the sixth day of the trial of James Holmes, who is 
charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 in the July 2012 attack.

Axelrod said she and her husband, Brandon, had just returned from their 
honeymoon when they went to the suburban Denver theater with a friend, Joshua 
Nowlan, to watch a Batman movie.

Brandon Axelrod suffered leg injuries when they dropped to the floor to hide 
from the gunfire. Nowlan was also shot.

Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His attorneys have 
acknowledged he was the shooter but say he has schizophrenia and did not know 
right from wrong.

Prosecutors maintain Holmes was sane. They are seeking the death penalty.

On Monday, jurors watched a video of Holmes after the attack asking 
detectives, “There weren’t any children hurt, were there?”

The video shows detectives interviewing a dazed-sounding Holmes at police 
headquarters about two hours after the shooting.

The detectives do not answer Holmes directly about children but say, “We’ll 
get to that.” One of the 12 people killed was six-year-old Veronica 
Moser-Sullivan.

Detective Chuck Mehl testified later that Holmes saw a sign for the Crimes 
Against Children Unit in police headquarters while he was being taken to the 
interview room, which may have prompted the question.

Some of Holmes’s interview answers are odd. Asked if he needs anything, he 
says, “Oxygen.” The detectives ask if he is having trouble breathing or wants a 
fan, but he says no.

When asked how to spell “Holmes”, he answers: “Like Sherlock.”
