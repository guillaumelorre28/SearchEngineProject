Confusingly, the Second Summer of Love was really two summers. The first, 
1988, was the warm-up as acid house graduated from hipster secret to the 
dominant sound of British clubland. A year later, it went viral. The implied 
comparison to 1967 may have been wishful thinking, but it was nonetheless a 
lifestyle revolution for young Britons. The old nightlife hierarchies were 
temporarily obliterated as unlicensed raves and affordable ecstasy promised 
state-of-the-art hedonism for all, not just the in-crowd, even if police raids 
and scamming promoters took some ofÂ the shine off it.

The top 40 enjoyed its most utopian phase since the Beatles assured All You 
Need Is Love, with producers such as S'Express and the KLF becoming stars 
thanks to cheap samplers and can-do chutzpah. TheHappy Mondays 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/happy-mondays> spearheaded Madchester, and 
even hip-hop, via De La Soul, seemed to sign up to a new idealism. Like the 
first Summer of Love, it seems somewhat naive in retrospect, but its shockwaves 
reshaped British youth culture for good.
