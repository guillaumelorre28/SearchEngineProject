The family of Dane Chinnery, a 19-year-old who was among those to die, have 
asked Palace fans at the game against Manchester City on Saturday to join them 
in a minute’s applause. The Eagles have also announced a minute’s silence will 
be held before the game.

Pardew said: “It has had a massive impact on us, not just the club but the 
areas around it. [It was] shocking really. We as a club have made a 
contribution to the fund. We will do everything we can for the families that 
will be at the game on Saturday.

“We are holding a minute’s silence, it is such a difficult thing. How can we 
get across the emotion they are feeling, it is such a personal thing.

“We are going to do the best we can. Some of the people injured were connected 
and two of the people who died were fans. We as a club are fully behind them 
and want to help them as best we can. We have an important role to help the 
fans.”
