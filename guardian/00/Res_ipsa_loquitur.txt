Res ipsa loquitur is a legal term used in negligence claims meaning the thing 
speaks for itself. So if, for example, a cap fitted by your dentist fell out 
after a week you could argue res ipsa loquitur.

You would not have to pinpoint precisely how the dentist was at fault in order 
to prove negligence because you could say the fact that the cap has fallen out 
is evidence enough. If the judge accepts this argument the burden falls on the 
dentist to prove they were not professionally negligent. Otherwise they will 
have to pay you compensation.
