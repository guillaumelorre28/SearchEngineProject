The white cars sailed to the church and to the parliamentary forecourt. The 
blow waves were immaculate, new suiting, freshly dry-cleaned.

On the opening day of the 45th parliament, our elected representatives wore 
the satisfied expressions of people who had triumphed in the festival of 
democracy that played out brutally over the winter of 2016.

They were back in the green place and the red place, and all was right with 
the world.

Malcolm smiled genially at Bill and Bill at Malcolm. Bill’s smile lingered as 
he wedged the prime minister by flagging a motion at the opening of the session 
that would affirm the rights of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be 
treated with equal respect “regardless of race, colour, creed or origin”.

Hello, Pauline! (Who was cheerful in zebra stripes, Qur’an in handbag.) Hello 
Cory! (Who was tiptoeing around the Senate chamber gathering signatures for 
another notice of motion that would allow consideration of watering down 
protections in the Racial Discrimination Act.)

The pomp and squirrel-gripping rolled on. Barnaby Joyce, dabbed in ceremonial 
paint from the welcome to country ceremony, chatted amiably with Tanya 
Plibersek as parliamentarians drifted between the chambers for the swearings 
in. Behind them, Julie Bishop gazed at the ceiling and Chris Bowen at the 
floor, obviously short on small talk.

The Speaker was dragged to the chair. The prime minister got emotional. Over 
in the Senate, Stephen Parry, who carries, etched, in his bearing the remnants 
of his two former professions, detective and undertaker, told the red place he 
would be “fair-minded” in a chamber that now boasts 11 crossbenchers.

Outside the bubble of the parliamentary precinct, meanwhile, in the toxic 
tabloid talkback bubble in Sydney, Ray Hadley clearly got up on The Great 
Occasion on the wrong side of the bed.

Mostly, Hadley invites the treasurer Scott Morrison to join him in the pool 
room, in the bro-zone, every week on 2GB. But sometimes, demagogues need to 
show their house pets just who is boss, even if the resident guest is the most 
powerful cabinet minister after the prime minister. Respect is for wimps.

Tuesday was one of those occasions. Morrison landed like a juicy bone in 
Hadley’s bowl, and after a brief baring of teeth, the Hadley jaws locked 
decisively around the treasurer.

What a mob of good for nothing, lazy numpties federal politicians were, Hadley 
thought, dialling things straight up to 11. That parliament hardly bothered to 
sit at all. It was populated by “a lot of bludgers and leaners … who are 
delighted to go home every Thursday, have a long weekend and then come back on 
Sunday night or Monday morning,” Hadley insisted, with the triumph of a person 
who was absolutely On To It, The Big Lark.

Hadley warmed to his monologue, giving Morrison a moment to consider whether 
fight or flight was the best recourse. On Tuesday it was fight.

Now, now Ray. Mate.

“Politicians work 60-70 hours a week, that’s what we do all the time,” 
Morrison said. “And we do it in the parliament, we do it in our communities, 
we’re doing it at events in our electorates at night, supporting local 
charities, supporting all of these events that take place, working with 
constituents in our offices.”

Ray was engaging in a cheap shot, the treasurer thought, which of course he 
was, and in this case, a cheap shot in the pool room, which is against the 
rules, even though the rules don’t exist, a fixed reality Morrison rediscovers 
periodically, each time, a new epiphany.

But while Ray was mauling the treasurer to punctuate the placid formalities in 
Canberra, another puncturing of the bubble of one-upmanship, ego and political 
tactics was in progress.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption had produced its long awaited 
Operation Spicer report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/icac-recommends-criminal-charges-against-joe-tripodi-and-chris-hartcher>
. It wasn’t pretty. A former Liberal state minister, Chris Hartcher, faces 
potential charges, as does the former Labor minister Joe Tripodi, who was found 
to have engaged in corrupt conduct.

Fundraising. Disclosure. Influence. Profound questions about culture, 
questions about whether parliaments serve people or undisclosed interests, 
floated like a question mark up the Hume and then then Federal Highway in the 
direction of the capital. The imaginary question mark floated over the top of 
the parliament building in Canberra, but the denizens were too intent on their 
various intrigues to notice.

From his Speaker’s chair in the House of Representatives, Tony Smith, was 
buckling in for a new term where theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> holds a majority of one. 
He surveyed his charges with a fixed expression you’d perhaps characterise as 
anticipatory indigestion.

Smith is a modest fellow for a professional politician, a person of neat and 
orderly habits, and his aspiration for the parliamentary new session was both 
modest, and revolutionary in context. He thought the new parliament could start 
with the simple objective of not “demoralising” the public.

“In this 45th parliament, can I say at the outset, I welcome the kind words 
but it is my job never to be satisfied. I will be doing everything I can to 
improve standards further,” Smith said.
