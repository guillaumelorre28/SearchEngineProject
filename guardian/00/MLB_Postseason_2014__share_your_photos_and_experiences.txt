With the MLB <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb> playoff set to begin this 
week this is an ideal opportunity to show us what your team means to you, and 
what your favourite moments of the season have been so far. How long have you 
supported your team? If your team has made it to the play offs this year, what 
do you think their chances are?

Perhaps watching baseball is an important family activity, or maybe you have 
certain friends that you religiously watch the games with. Do you have a 
particular item of memorabilia that you hold dear that brings you luck on match 
days? We would love to see photos and stories about how you plan on supporting 
your team in the postseason matches, as well as your most treasured baseball 
memories from games and seasons gone by.

Share your photos and experiences of the 2014 season and we will publish the 
best contributions on the Guardian site.

You can submit your photos and stories by clicking on the blue ‘contribute’ 
buttons or by uploading a photo via theGuardianWitness mobile app
