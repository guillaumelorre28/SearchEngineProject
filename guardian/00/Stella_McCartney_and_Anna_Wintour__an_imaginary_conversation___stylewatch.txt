Stella: ‘Hey Anna! Nice frock. How’s it going?’
Anna: “I’m fine, Stella. But you could have warned me about all this mud on
 the catwalk. Not great with kitten heeled sandals, you know.”
Stella: “Soz! It’s because Alasdhair [Willis, her husband] is really ramming
 home the festival thing this season. It’s Hunter’s thing, innit?”
Anna: “Has he done any pastel footwear for me?”
Stella: “Yes degrade lilac wellies actually. And some lovely parachute parkas.”
Anna: “Fine.”
Stella: “You know Jennifer Saunders and Sharleen Spiteri are here too?
Anna: “Fine.’
Stella: “U OK?”
Anna: “Fine.”
Stella: “K, so see you in them at Glasto next year?”
Anna: “Are Sleaford Mods playing?”
Stella: “Um, yes?”
Anna: “Fine.”
