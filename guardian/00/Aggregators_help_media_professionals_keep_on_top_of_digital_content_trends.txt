The internet is not like trying to drink from a firehose but rather like 
trying to drink from Niagara Falls. For any media professional trying to remain 
up to speed on digital content trends, it is often overwhelming. I've had to 
develop a lot of methods and constantly change the tools I use to manage this 
torrent of information. I've mentionedPopurls <http://popurls.com/> before as 
an easy one-stop shop to follow internet buzz, and once registered you can 
personalise the site to show your favourite digital content sites first.

You can log into Popurls using your user name and password from several other 
services such as Google or Yahoo. You can create your own Popurls sharing page 
and automatically post items you share to Facebook, Twitter or Friendfeed or 
mini-blogging sitesTumblr <http://www.tumblr.com/> or Posterous 
<http://posterous.com/>.

However, if you don't want to take the time to personalise Popurls, there are 
a number of aggregators that pull together a great sample of digital trends. 
Sites such asOriginal Signal <http://web20.originalsignal.com/> are good if you 
want a single page to have a quick glance at sites covering web 2.0 
developments, such asTechCrunch <http://www.techcrunch.com/>, GigaOm 
<http://www.gigaom.com/>, Mashable <http://www.mashable.com/> and ReadWriteWeb 
<http://www.readwriteweb.com/>. There is a North American bias to a lot of the 
content because most of the aggregators operate from there, but it's a good 
start for a filtered view of the web based on the interests of a digital media 
professional.

These sites cover the world of web 2.0 with great depth, but if your interests 
are even more specific, you may want to check out the aggregator Alltop. It 
takes Popurls to the next level, not just featuring buzz and top-level topics 
but aggregated pages from sites and blogs covering a wide range of subjects. 
For instance, you can quickly find blogs and sites covering such specialist 
topics asweb analytics <http://web-analytics.alltop.com/>, virtual worlds 
<http://virtual-worlds.alltop.com/>, rich internet applications 
<http://ria.alltop.com/> or mobile <http://mobile.alltop.com/>. You can even 
filter Alltop based on location.

The newest addition to these media news aggregators is also the newest 
addition to the popular TechMeme family,MediaGazer <http://mediagazer.com/>. 
TechMeme uses an algorithm and human editors to filter tech stories that are 
generating conversation. MediaGazer takes the TechMeme model and focuses on 
media coverage, and it has a very good transatlantic spread, at least in terms 
of English-language media reporting.

Aggregators <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aggregators> are just one way 
to manage information but, with a little tweaking, they can help the flood of 
information seem more manageable and relevant.
