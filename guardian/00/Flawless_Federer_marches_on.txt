Defending champion Roger Federer maintained his imposing start to the 
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> with 
another straight sets victory in the third round.

Federer, yet to drop a set in the tournament, took just over two hours to 
dispose of the 25th seed Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) at the Rod Laver 
Arena.

The top seed squandered three match points during the third-set tie-break but 
closed out the match at the fourth attempt. He will meet 14th seed Novak 
Djokovic in the fourth round after the Serbian downed Thailand's Danai 
Udonchoke 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.

The 19-year-old Djokovic insists he will approach playing the world number one 
in a positive frame of mind. "If I go with the white flag on the court, what am 
I doing here?" he said. "I have nine wins in a row now, but that doesn't mean 
if I play Federer that I'm going to stop here, that I'm already giving up. I 
will do everything to win. I'm going to be motivated, that's for sure."

Also advancing was American Mardy Fish, who went through after Australia's 
Wayne Arthurs retired from their third match while trailing 3-0 in the opening 
set.
