South Australian production Girl Asleep was awarded the nation’s richest film 
prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/28/girl-asleep-australia-richest-film-prize-cinefestoz-rosemary-myers>
 at CinefestOz in Western Australia this weekend – and, the morning after the 
gala night in Busselton, the film’s writer, Matthew Whittet, still seems 
stunned.

“We’re totally blown away that it happened and we’re still just processing,” 
he says. “It’s incredible to have this sort of support going into our release 
[in a week]. The timing couldn’t be better for us.”

With a creative team that hails from Adelaide’s Windmill Theatre 
<http://windmill.org.au/> company, led by artistic director Rosemary Myers, the 
film has beengarnering acclaim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/girl-asleep-first-look-review-the-magical-realism-of-being-a-teenager>
 worldwide since its premiere at the Adelaide film festival in 2015. It’s gone 
on to play festivals in Berlin, Stockholm, Buenos Aires and Seattle, where it 
won the grand jury prize. Meanwhile Oscilloscope, a film distribution company 
founded by Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys has bought it for release in the USA.

Acclaim is one thing but AU$100,000 in prize money is another – and Whittet 
says they’re still working out what to do with it.

“Because we didn’t expect to win, we never in our minds thought about the 
money. I think there’ll be some serious planning ... for helping to get it out 
there in the next period of time, which is make or break for the film. [The 
money] means that there are a lot more options open to us as to what to do – 
both with this one and hopefully the next.”

Girl Asleep was first produced as a play 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/09/girl-asleep-review-as-inventive-and-surprising-as-its-audience>
, the third in a trilogy of works focusing on teen rites of passage, each 
directed by Myers and written by Whittet, who co-stars in the film as the daggy 
dad to 15-year-old protagonist Greta. After moving to a new school, Greta 
(Bethany Whitmore from The Family Law) struggles in her new friendships with 
quirky kid Elliot (Harrison Feldman from Upper Middle Bogan) and a trio of 
fiercely intimidating teen girls.

When her parents throw her a devastatingly awkward birthday party, with all 
her new schoolmates invited, Greta’s inner anxieties spring to surreal life.

The film version began with creative workshop 
<http://adelaidefilmfestival.org/about-aff-investment-fund/hive-lab> in 2011 
hosted by the Adelaide film festival, which brought together artists from 
various disciplines and encouraged them to consider filmmaking. Though Myers 
had never turned her hand to cinema before, she and Whittet (an experienced 
screen actor, with credits in The Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge) were 
encouraged to pitch a feature.


That cross-disciplinary background may account for some of its success, as 
Girl Asleep is one of the most inventive creations to hit local screens in some 
time. The dense production design by Jonathan Oxlade conjures 1970s Australian 
suburbia and the symmetrical compositions have drawn comparison to the work of 
Wes Anderson – though some will be reminded most of the freewheeling British 
sitcom The Mighty Boosh.

There’s a definite theatricality to the visuals, shot by cinematographer 
Andrew Commis, but Myers’ keen sense of staging gives it a fully cinematic feel.

“Rose [Myers] is incredibly good at creating a picture,” Whittet says. “When 
we do it on stage, a lot of it becomes about finding where you sit in the space 
and how to get the most dynamic tension out of a scene, using bodies. We’ve had 
a lot of experience doing that. Andrew Commis and Rose together had a very 
strong grasp of how to create that tension and that energy inside the frame.”

Myers emphasises the importance of finding collaborators willing to work with 
the “maverick sensibility” of a company like Windmill Theatre. “We work 
incredibly closely together, Matt and myself, and also with our designer, 
Jonathan Oxlade. We have a very aligned aesthetic. It was key to get Andrew and 
our editor, Karryn de Cinque, to fit within that mix. If you just get one voice 
wrong in any collaboration the whole thing goes skewed.”

One of the film’s most distinctive decisions – to shoot in a 4:3 aspect ratio 
– was made by Myers over the course of a day’s discussion with Commis. “It is 
slightly problematic,” she jokes now, “because the [film] is going to be 
screened on the ABC and they’re going to want to show it in widescreen. 
Apparently you can blow people’s minds pretty quick if you do something in 4:3. 
They are all going to start fiddling with their dial and ringing up the station 
and complaining that something’s wrong with the picture.

“We didn’t know whether film was going to travel. Every step along the way we 
just wanted to make something that excited us.”

That their idiosyncratic vision made it to the screen intact is a credit to 
the flourishing film culture in South Australia, represented by institutions 
such as the South Australian Film Corporation, one of the funders behind the 
film, and theAdelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> 
film festival, which has its own screen fund and which has supported other 
innovative Australian productions like 52 Tuesdays – two stars of which also 
appear in Girl Asleep.

“There are some really amazing champions in Adelaide,” Whittet says. “I think 
individual voices get a chance to speak. It’s very hard in a market-driven 
industry to find ways in which people will take a punt on individual voices. As 
long as the budget and the cost are not exorbitantly expensive, then it means 
there’s room for risk. Sometimes that won’t work but sometimes you get things 
out of it that are really exciting.

“It’s the individuality of the voices that come out of Australia that’s 
actually what sets a film apart when you take it overseas.”

• Girl Asleep previews in Perth and Melbourne on 1 September, before an 
Australian release on 8 September.
