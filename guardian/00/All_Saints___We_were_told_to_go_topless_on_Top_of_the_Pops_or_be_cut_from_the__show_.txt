The group, who recently reformed after a decade apart, said they were told if 
they did not remove their tops, they would be cut from the popular BBC 
programme.

In an interview with the BBC 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36014166>, the group – made up of 
Shaznay Lewis, Melanie Blatt and sisters Natalie and Nicole Appleton – said 
producers wanted to shoot the band from the shoulders up to create the illusion 
they were performing naked.

“They were filming images of us to use as a backdrop and they wanted us to 
take our tops off,” said Lewis.

Natalie Appleton said the band “did not want that vision” of nudity but were 
given no choice.

“The girl that worked with us was in tears because she was trying to fight our 
corner. We ended up having to compromise with the producers. We dropped our 
tops to here [armpits] so it would look like we were topless.”

Her sister added: “Because it was such a huge show, we were told: ‘If you 
don’t do it, you don’t get to go on the show’.”

The quartet emphasised how little autonomy they had been given as women in the 
male-dominated music industry, and were regularly expected to take part in 
provocative stunts and photoshoots. Blatt said their resistance had meant they 
were described as “stroppy” or “difficult”, labels that were never given to 
their male counterparts.

“A lot of [male] Britpop groups at the time would act very arrogantly and very 
stroppy, but that was never seen as a negative thing,” she said.

“We weren’t half as bad – but if we didn’t want to smile one day, or we 
weren’t really interested in doing an interview, we’d be labelled as stroppy 
cows.”


All Saints <https://www.theguardian.com/music/all-saints> first formed in 
London in 1993, and in 1997 released their acclaimed debut album, which went to 
number two in the charts. Their second album went platinum around the world, 
but they split up the following year after discord in the band. They reunited 
briefly in 2009 to record their third album, Studio 1, but it flopped and 
barely entered the Top 40.


The group announced their latest return at the beginning of 2016, releasing 
their fourth studio album Red Flag this week. It has been favourably received, 
withthe Guardian describing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/10/all-saints-red-flag-review-michael-cragg>
 it as “a sassy and soulful return to form”.
