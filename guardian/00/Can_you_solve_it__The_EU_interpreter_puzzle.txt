Hello guzzlers,

Among the potential casualties of last month’s Brexit vote are the jobs of 
many British interpreters in Brussels.

In their honour, today’s polyglot puzzle:

Fran French, Geraldine German, Dudley Dutch, Spike Spanish, Polly Polish and 
Ron Romanian are six British interpreters at the EU.

They each speak two European languages, as well as English, but none speaks 
the language indicated by their name.

No two interpreters speak the same two foreign languages and each of the six 
foreign languages is spoken by only two of them.

Spike speaks Dutch and German while his cousin speaks Dutch and Polish. 

Fran and Dudley speak all the four languages not indicated by their names. Of 
the two languages that Dudley is fluent in, both of their namesakes speak 
French. No German speaker knows any Polish.

Which two languages does Ron speak?

I’ll publish the answer at 5pm BST later today. No spoilers in the comments 
please.


I post a puzzle here on a Monday every two weeks. Today’s puzzle is inspired by
Hubert Phillips, who devised many puzzles like between the 1930s and 1960s.
