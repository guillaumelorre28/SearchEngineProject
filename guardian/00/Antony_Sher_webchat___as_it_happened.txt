I hope people can see the Henries - both parts! Which play at the Barbican 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican> until the end of January.

And then I hope they'll come and see Death of a Salesman, which plays in 
Stratford in March and April. This should be very exciting - it's the first 
time we're doing a modern classic on that great Shakespeare stage. But I think 
that Arthur Miller's play ranks as one of the great tragedies ever written. So 
it should be just the right home for it.

I hope people buy my book Year of the Fat Knight next June! And read all about 
the rollercoaster ride I've had with the Fat Knight.

Having seen and enjoyed your portrayal of Falstaff in Henry IV parts 1 and 2, 
I wonder if you would like to play the plump Knight in The Merry Wives of 
Windsor at some point in the future?

The Falstaff of Merry Wives of Windsor is very different to the Falstaff of 
Henry IV Parts I and II. In Merry Wives he is, pardon the pun, a lightweight 
version of himself. And lacks all the layers of characterisation that he has in 
the Henries, as we call them. Having played him in the Henries, I think I would 
find it a less satisfying experience to play him in Merry Wives.

I saw you recently as Falstaff: I was so utterly convinced by the performance 
that I felt almost as if the man himself had stumbled into the theatre to 
present a show of scenes from his life. It was a style of acting that was 
plausible and Shakespearean at the same time. Do you think there is a “style” 
of Shakespearean acting and how has it changed over the years?

I, like many other actors who have joined the RSC, used to believe that there 
is a prescribed way of playing Shakespeare. There isn't. Each generation 
devises their own way dependent on how audiences want to receive Shakespeare. 
Earlier generations of audiences were happy to hear him almost sung or 
performed in a very grand operatic manner. Modern audiences want him to be done 
more realistically, they want to recognise the characters on stage as people 
they know in their lives.

So it will keep changing, but there are some basic rules about playing 
Shakespeare that it is best for actors to know about even if they then choose 
to discard them. Playing Shakespeare in a totally naturalistic way with the 
mumbling of modern speech, the tendency to fall away towards the end of a 
sentence, this simply wouldn't work when speaking Shakespeare verse.

In an earlier piece for The Guardian you alluded to the golden generation of 
actors that you found difficult to identify with (Gielgud, Olvier, Michael 
Redgrave). Personally I think you carry the mantle of verse acting with both 
integrity and a similar panache to those mentioned. As to those, they all 
worked with the John Barton and Peter Hall.

How influential are the ideas of Barton and Hall (as well as Trevor Nunn) 
among members of the RSC today, including an artistic director like Greg Doran, 
who, among other things, is a respected Shakespeare scholar?

I was very lucky to join the RSC in the early 80s at a time when the company 
existed almost like a training school as well as a performing ensemble. And we 
had workshops and one-to-ones with some truly great Shakespearians, like John 
Barton and the great voice guru Ciss Berry. It often struck me that it was 
incredible that we were being paid to learn about Shakespeare from these 
people, it felt like it should have been the other way round! But Greg is very 
much carrying on that tradition. He's a great disciple of John Barton - he's 
absorbed and learned a lot of his principles about speaking and performing 
Shakespeare. And they meet up regularly to discuss things, and I think of them 
as the spirit of RSC past and present in wise consultation with one another.

Hello Mr Sher, I’m a student studying Richard III for my A-Levels. As a 
Shakespearean actor, what are some of your favorite and most disliked traits 
about that character, and what things did you consider in your critical 
evaluation of Richard before you played him? Thanks in advance for taking the 
time to reply to this.

I talked earlier about the theme of persecuted people turning into persecutors 
- Richard is a fine example of this. In his famous opening speech, which begins 
"Now is the winter of our discontent", he describes very graphically what it is 
like for him as a disabled man to be in society. It has clearly damaged him 
considerably. I think there's a lot of evidence of self-hatred in him. But it 
also fuels a very special energy that he possesses, which is a destructive 
energy, in that he goes on to destroy the lives of quite a few people around 
him.

But in typical Shakespeare fashion, he is written with such wit and black 
humour that an audience ends up relishing his machinations. It's one of the 
fascinating things about Shakespeare: how he makes an audience enjoy characters 
whom if they met in real life they'd run a mile from. I just enjoyed playing 
the complexity of a man whom nature has given a rough deal, and yet who ends up 
being such a huge force in the story.

What acting role has been your favourite so far and why?

It tends always to be the one you're playing at the moment. But in this case, 
it could end up being an all-time favourite. Partly because Falstaff is not a 
part I'd ever dreamed of playing - look at me! He's so far away from me, in 
every aspect, that when Greg did suggest it, I just couldn't picture myself 
doing it. And spent quite a long time with him trying to persuade me, and me 
trying to work out whether I could do it. Every actor who plays Falstaff has to 
wear a fat suit, but it isn't just his physical aspect - his personality is 
enormous, everything about him is different to me.

Eventually that became the hook for me. Like what I was saying about how I 
love character acting - here was going to be a feast of character acting, 
bigger and better than anything I had tried before. Now that I have done it, 
and it seems to have worked out quite well, I just keep thinking about how much 
poorer my life would have been had I not done it. It's been a really special 
experience.

I think Macbeth is possibly Shakespeare's perfect play, it's a perfect play in 
the writing. It's very hard to do, and defeats most productions, because the 
themes of the supernatural, murder... they're very hard to make real and put on 
stage and be as frightening as they are when you just read it. But in the 1999 
production that Greg directed, and I played Macbeth with Harriet Walter as Lady 
Macbeth, we did succeed in making it work. That was something we all felt very 
proud about. We went on to film the production for Channel 4, it exists as a 
DVD if anyone wants to look at it and agree with what I'm saying!

Hi Anthony,
Just finished teaching at the Guildhall after 15 years and trying to set 
myself up locally in Cambridge as I believe there is a shortage of enthusiastic 
Shakespeare teaching - teaching which inspires - where students are allowed to 
perform and hear the words - understand characters and themselves far deeper 
through the language as opposed to analysis and iambic pentameter. Keep hearing 
the words - boring and outdated - SOS - Save Our Shakespeare - my question is 
what do you believe is missing in educating our young people in Shakespeare - 
so many love it when they visit Stratford and see actors make sense of the 
language but still many are not given that chance - what can we do?

I agree that the teaching of Shakespeare in schools is very important. I was 
not taught it well at my school, and it almost put me off it for life. I 
suspect this is quite a common experience. I wish that kids could be brought to 
see plays performed at Stratford, before they even read them - he was after all 
written to be performed, rather than read. But I think a very hopeful thing is 
happening at the moment, that our Live From Stratford broadcasts, which go out 
to cinemas round the country and round the world, are then streamed live into 
schools, and we've had some terrific responses of teachers saying that it's 
really engaged the kids in a way that other more conventional ways of teaching 
haven't always achieved.

The iambic pentameter side of it is secondary to his powers of 
characterisation and storytelling. If kids get bogged down in trying to 
understand what iambic pentameter is, they'll miss out on the really exciting 
stuff in Shakespeare. The great stories, the things they can identify with. 
That's at the heart of Shakespeare, not the way he writes verse.

I think Meryl Streep is the greatest actor in the world. I'm very passionate 
about character acting, and her powers of character acting are phenomenal. Her 
powers of transformation, whether its becoming a British prime minister or a 
Polish survivor of the Holocaust, or a Danish farmer in Out of Africa, they're 
just phenomenal transformations.

But what she does that makes her really, really good, is put her own heart and 
soul into these characters so that it isn't just a technical exercise of 
changing her accent. There is a living, breathing person there, that you care 
about. That combination of transforming herself through acting, and yet playing 
with her own heart and soul, is a great gift, and I would just love to have 
some close up view of her working. I'd be prepared to play a doorman opening 
the door for her, if I could just have a couple of days on set with her, 
watching her work. She does theatre work I suppose... we could do a play 
together, in my dreams.

After your stint at the Barbican <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican>

I've had very good training for this particular hurdle, in that every time you 
come to play one of the great Shakespeare roles, you're following in very 
famous footsteps. If you thought about that too much, you'd become paralysed, 
and wouldn't be able to play it at all. You just have to get over it! And get 
on with the job.

That early experience of Richard III, I was up against it there, Olivier had 
done a very famous interpretation, and the bastard even went and filmed it. 
People around the world can do interpretations of his Richard. That was a very 
good baptism of fire: "stand aside Larry, just give me a little bit of space to 
do my own version!"

Luckily I haven't seen Death of a Salesman on stage, ever. I've seen a couple 
of the filmed versions and they're not quite as powerful as I think the 
experience will be on stage. The play is more of a dream than film versions do, 
because everything becomes a bit literal on film. In Arthur Miller's writing, 
you go right into Willy's head as he's falling apart. It's very painful, very 
poignant, I think.

It's very rare that film scripts are as good as theatre scripts, so I just 
haven't really been that lucky to get many of those really well written films 
come my way.

Yes, absolutely, I'm putting the finishing touches to one of my theatre 
journal books. The first of these was called Year of the King, about playing 
Richard III; this one is called Year of the Fat Knight, about playing Falstaff. 
And like that earlier book, it's diary entries over the year of preparing and 
rehearsing it, interspersed with my drawings and sketches of other members of 
the cast, various famous actors who have played Falstaff over the years, etc. 
That's being published in June next year.

Both. And Falstaff's a really good example. I don't think there's any other 
character in Shakespeare that's described as physically as much as Falstaff is, 
in terms of his size and weight. The actor who's going to play him, together 
with the designer and director is going to have to conceive of how to play that 
physical shape. That's from the outside in. But on the other hand there is also 
a wonderfully complex, rich character that Shakespeare has written, that you've 
also got to investigate and play, and certainly that's from the inside out.

Falstaff is a totally selfish man, completely egotistical. He has a line at 
one point about "this little kingdom man"; he is a kingdom called Falstaff. He 
can be the life and soul of the party, is enormously witty and subversive and 
exciting to be with. Which is why the prince has become best buddies with him. 
There's a terrific contradiction - he lives just for himself, but you don't 
half have a fun time with him, if you spend an evening in the Bull's Head 
tavern.

My favourite work of yours is Indian Summer, aka Alive and Kicking - a 1996 
film you did with Jason Flemyng. Several of my friends, no longer with us, were 
ill at the time... and the film just helped me deal with that and support my 
friends even better. It appealed on so many personal levels - I used to dance 
and knew many dancers, my friends were ill, and I was also at college at the 
time, to become a community social service worker, much like your character. 
You got the pain and frustration so exactly right. Did you consult with any 
social workers for your research?

I'm really proud of doing that film. I fear that the HIV/Aids theme meant that 
it wasn't perhaps seen as much as it should have been. I did as part of my 
research consult with social workers, and they gave me very valuable material 
in creating my character.

It's always so important what the quality of writing is like, and Martin 
Sherman, the way he had written my character who is a social worker working 
with people with HIV and Aids, and who then falls in love with one of these 
people, it was a brilliant piece of characterisation. Because he shows how the 
pressure on my character leads him to drink too much, to be flawed in many 
ways, although he's doing such good work. I love that ambiguity and 
contradiction in characters.

What has it been like living with the current artistic director of the RSC,

When Greg got the job, we both took a deep breath and said right, well, we've 
got to find a way of making this work. Because there are many stories of the 
artistic directors at these big companies having nervous breakdowns, or their 
marriages falling apart. It is a superhuman job. So far, touch wood, we've 
incorporated it into our lives and a really important thing is we make sure to 
take regular holidays together, to actually carve out times together. That has 
really been an important part of the equation.

We've worked together so many times over the years as director and actor - 10 
or 12 times. That hasn't altered with his new job.

Hi Tony, I’m currently in the process of reading your book on RIII, ‘Year of 
the King’; it’s wonderfully written and the drawings are fantastic, although 
the high point so far has undoubtedly been the anecdote about Michael Gambon. 
Utterly brilliant and hilarious. At the start you mention that you promised 
Harold Pinter that you’d leave the RSC, so what made you stay for all these 
years?

There's a strange inverted snobbery about the RSC. I just discovered that if I 
was to have my career as a theatre actor, rather than in movies and TV, there 
was simply nowhere better to be than the RSC and to devote my career to playing 
Shakespeare. I can't picture a more satisfying career than the one I've been 
lucky enough to have.

We take Shakespeare too much for granted in this country, we can almost forget 
what a genius he is, how brilliant he is. When you play one of the great parts 
and if you succeed in finding a way to play it, it's more satisfying than any 
other acting. It's his remarkable insight into what it is like to be human, his 
characters together become an astonishingly comprehensive picture of us all. He 
deals with every single aspect of all of us - there's no other playwright 
that's ever done that, will ever do that.

Hi Mr Sher, the first time I ever went to the theatre was when my parents took 
me to see you as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice at theBarbican

most incredible experience i’ve ever had at the theatre - you were absolutely 
extraordinary and gave me a love of Shakespeare for life - thank you. My 
question is do you believe Shakespeare was who we all think he was, the actor 
from Stratford, or do you subscribe to any of the conspiracy theories regarding 
his real identity, Marlowe, Bacon etc?

and I've never seen a shred of evidence in any of the conspiracy theories to

You performed the title role in Peter Flannery’s play “Singer” in the Swan in 
the late 1980s; what a cast, you, Joe Melia, Malcolm Storrie. I don’t believe 
it’s been revived since, although there was a readthrough done as part of a 
“things the RSC has done in the past” event in Stratford a few years ago. It’s 
a play of its (Thatcherite) times, but what are your memories of performing it, 
and do you think it would speak to audiences today in similar times of 
austerity?

I think Peter Flannery's Singer is one of the best modern plays. It was a 
tremendous experience being in it. It was revived at the Tricycle about ten 
years ago but I'd like to see it go into the repertoire of modern classics and 
be performed regularly.

The theme of the play is one which has preoccupied me a lot in my writing as 
well as acting of the persecuted turning into the persecutor, and with Singer 
we see a man who was in a concentration camp, and suffered there, and turns 
into this ruthless Notting Hill landlord based on the real life character 
Rachman, and then eventually being redeemed.

Classics are just always contemporary - you just apply them to whatever is 
happening. That's why Shakespeare can be done again and again.

Post your questions for Antony Sher

Richard III, Iago, Shylock, Malvolio... in a career with the Royal Shakespeare 
Company that started in 1982 Antony Sher has tackled some of the Bard’s most 
reprehensible and rich characters, his own favouritebeing Macbeth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/12/antony-sher-portrait-artist>. 

Not only has his RSC work helped earn him a knighthood and constant critical 
acclaim, his partner Greg Doran runs the company – the pair met during a 
Merchant of Venice production in 1987, and became one of the earliest 
high-profile couples to get a civil partnership.

Doran is currently directing Sher as Falstaff in a production of Henry IV, 
described as a “magnificent” performanceby the Guardian’s Michael Billington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/17/henry-iv-parts-i-and-ii-review-antony-sher-falstaff>
: “Sher balances Falstaff’s cruelty with sufficient charm to justify his role 
as magnetic pub entertainer. But, just as you start to warm to this Falstaff, 
you are reminded of his rapacity.”

With the play continuing at London’s Barbican 
<http://www.rsc.org.uk/whats-on/henry-iv/> until mid-January, Sher is joining 
us to answer your questions about it and anything else in his career – be it 
his own direction, the plays he’s written, or big-screen roles like Disraeli 
opposite Judi Dench’s Victoria in Mrs Brown. It runs from 12.30pm onwards on 
Tuesday 9 December; post your question in the comments below, and he’ll try to 
answer as many as possible.

I hope people can see the Henries - both parts! Which play at the Barbican 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican> until the end of January.

And then I hope they'll come and see Death of a Salesman, which plays in 
Stratford in March and April. This should be very exciting - it's the first 
time we're doing a modern classic on that great Shakespeare stage. But I think 
that Arthur Miller's play ranks as one of the great tragedies ever written. So 
it should be just the right home for it.

I hope people buy my book Year of the Fat Knight next June! And read all about 
the rollercoaster ride I've had with the Fat Knight.

The Falstaff of Merry Wives of Windsor is very different to the Falstaff of 
Henry IV Parts I and II. In Merry Wives he is, pardon the pun, a lightweight 
version of himself. And lacks all the layers of characterisation that he has in 
the Henries, as we call them. Having played him in the Henries, I think I would 
find it a less satisfying experience to play him in Merry Wives.
 
fitba1 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14146586> asks:

I saw you recently as Falstaff: I was so utterly convinced by the performance 
that I felt almost as if the man himself had stumbled into the theatre to 
present a show of scenes from his life. It was a style of acting that was 
plausible and Shakespearean at the same time. Do you think there is a “style” 
of Shakespearean acting and how has it changed over the years?

I, like many other actors who have joined the RSC, used to believe that there 
is a prescribed way of playing Shakespeare. There isn't. Each generation 
devises their own way dependent on how audiences want to receive Shakespeare. 
Earlier generations of audiences were happy to hear him almost sung or 
performed in a very grand operatic manner. Modern audiences want him to be done 
more realistically, they want to recognise the characters on stage as people 
they know in their lives.

So it will keep changing, but there are some basic rules about playing 
Shakespeare that it is best for actors to know about even if they then choose 
to discard them. Playing Shakespeare in a totally naturalistic way with the 
mumbling of modern speech, the tendency to fall away towards the end of a 
sentence, this simply wouldn't work when speaking Shakespeare verse.
 
Bullfinchington <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1960359> asks:

In an earlier piece for The Guardian you alluded to the golden generation of 
actors that you found difficult to identify with (Gielgud, Olvier, Michael 
Redgrave). Personally I think you carry the mantle of verse acting with both 
integrity and a similar panache to those mentioned. As to those, they all 
worked with the John Barton and Peter Hall.

How influential are the ideas of Barton and Hall (as well as Trevor Nunn) 
among members of the RSC today, including an artistic director like Greg Doran, 
who, among other things, is a respected Shakespeare scholar?

I was very lucky to join the RSC in the early 80s at a time when the company 
existed almost like a training school as well as a performing ensemble. And we 
had workshops and one-to-ones with some truly great Shakespearians, like John 
Barton and the great voice guru Ciss Berry. It often struck me that it was 
incredible that we were being paid to learn about Shakespeare from these 
people, it felt like it should have been the other way round! But Greg is very 
much carrying on that tradition. He's a great disciple of John Barton - he's 
absorbed and learned a lot of his principles about speaking and performing 
Shakespeare. And they meet up regularly to discuss things, and I think of them 
as the spirit of RSC past and present in wise consultation with one another.
 
MrJohnDoe <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14145899> asks:

Hello Mr Sher, I’m a student studying Richard III for my A-Levels. As a 
Shakespearean actor, what are some of your favorite and most disliked traits 
about that character, and what things did you consider in your critical 
evaluation of Richard before you played him? Thanks in advance for taking the 
time to reply to this.

I talked earlier about the theme of persecuted people turning into persecutors 
- Richard is a fine example of this. In his famous opening speech, which begins 
"Now is the winter of our discontent", he describes very graphically what it is 
like for him as a disabled man to be in society. It has clearly damaged him 
considerably. I think there's a lot of evidence of self-hatred in him. But it 
also fuels a very special energy that he possesses, which is a destructive 
energy, in that he goes on to destroy the lives of quite a few people around 
him.

But in typical Shakespeare fashion, he is written with such wit and black 
humour that an audience ends up relishing his machinations. It's one of the 
fascinating things about Shakespeare: how he makes an audience enjoy characters 
whom if they met in real life they'd run a mile from. I just enjoyed playing 
the complexity of a man whom nature has given a rough deal, and yet who ends up 
being such a huge force in the story.

It tends always to be the one you're playing at the moment. But in this case, 
it could end up being an all-time favourite. Partly because Falstaff is not a 
part I'd ever dreamed of playing - look at me! He's so far away from me, in 
every aspect, that when Greg did suggest it, I just couldn't picture myself 
doing it. And spent quite a long time with him trying to persuade me, and me 
trying to work out whether I could do it. Every actor who plays Falstaff has to 
wear a fat suit, but it isn't just his physical aspect - his personality is 
enormous, everything about him is different to me.

Eventually that became the hook for me. Like what I was saying about how I 
love character acting - here was going to be a feast of character acting, 
bigger and better than anything I had tried before. Now that I have done it, 
and it seems to have worked out quite well, I just keep thinking about how much 
poorer my life would have been had I not done it. It's been a really special 
experience.

I think Macbeth is possibly Shakespeare's perfect play, it's a perfect play in 
the writing. It's very hard to do, and defeats most productions, because the 
themes of the supernatural, murder... they're very hard to make real and put on 
stage and be as frightening as they are when you just read it. But in the 1999 
production that Greg directed, and I played Macbeth with Harriet Walter as Lady 
Macbeth, we did succeed in making it work. That was something we all felt very 
proud about. We went on to film the production for Channel 4, it exists as a 
DVD if anyone wants to look at it and agree with what I'm saying!

Hi Anthony,
Just finished teaching at the Guildhall after 15 years and trying to set 
myself up locally in Cambridge as I believe there is a shortage of enthusiastic 
Shakespeare teaching - teaching which inspires - where students are allowed to 
perform and hear the words - understand characters and themselves far deeper 
through the language as opposed to analysis and iambic pentameter. Keep hearing 
the words - boring and outdated - SOS - Save Our Shakespeare - my question is 
what do you believe is missing in educating our young people in Shakespeare - 
so many love it when they visit Stratford and see actors make sense of the 
language but still many are not given that chance - what can we do?

I agree that the teaching of Shakespeare in schools is very important. I was 
not taught it well at my school, and it almost put me off it for life. I 
suspect this is quite a common experience. I wish that kids could be brought to 
see plays performed at Stratford, before they even read them - he was after all 
written to be performed, rather than read. But I think a very hopeful thing is 
happening at the moment, that our Live From Stratford broadcasts, which go out 
to cinemas round the country and round the world, are then streamed live into 
schools, and we've had some terrific responses of teachers saying that it's 
really engaged the kids in a way that other more conventional ways of teaching 
haven't always achieved.

The iambic pentameter side of it is secondary to his powers of 
characterisation and storytelling. If kids get bogged down in trying to 
understand what iambic pentameter is, they'll miss out on the really exciting 
stuff in Shakespeare. The great stories, the things they can identify with. 
That's at the heart of Shakespeare, not the way he writes verse.

I think Meryl Streep is the greatest actor in the world. I'm very passionate 
about character acting, and her powers of character acting are phenomenal. Her 
powers of transformation, whether its becoming a British prime minister or a 
Polish survivor of the Holocaust, or a Danish farmer in Out of Africa, they're 
just phenomenal transformations.

But what she does that makes her really, really good, is put her own heart and 
soul into these characters so that it isn't just a technical exercise of 
changing her accent. There is a living, breathing person there, that you care 
about. That combination of transforming herself through acting, and yet playing 
with her own heart and soul, is a great gift, and I would just love to have 
some close up view of her working. I'd be prepared to play a doorman opening 
the door for her, if I could just have a couple of days on set with her, 
watching her work. She does theatre work I suppose... we could do a play 
together, in my dreams.

I've had very good training for this particular hurdle, in that every time you 
come to play one of the great Shakespeare roles, you're following in very 
famous footsteps. If you thought about that too much, you'd become paralysed, 
and wouldn't be able to play it at all. You just have to get over it! And get 
on with the job.

That early experience of Richard III, I was up against it there, Olivier had 
done a very famous interpretation, and the bastard even went and filmed it. 
People around the world can do interpretations of his Richard. That was a very 
good baptism of fire: "stand aside Larry, just give me a little bit of space to 
do my own version!"

Luckily I haven't seen Death of a Salesman on stage, ever. I've seen a couple 
of the filmed versions and they're not quite as powerful as I think the 
experience will be on stage. The play is more of a dream than film versions do, 
because everything becomes a bit literal on film. In Arthur Miller's writing, 
you go right into Willy's head as he's falling apart. It's very painful, very 
poignant, I think.

It's very rare that film scripts are as good as theatre scripts, so I just 
haven't really been that lucky to get many of those really well written films 
come my way.

Yes, absolutely, I'm putting the finishing touches to one of my theatre

And like that earlier book, it's diary entries over the year of preparing and

Both. And Falstaff's a really good example. I don't think there's any other 
character in Shakespeare that's described as physically as much as Falstaff is, 
in terms of his size and weight. The actor who's going to play him, together 
with the designer and director is going to have to conceive of how to play that 
physical shape. That's from the outside in. But on the other hand there is also 
a wonderfully complex, rich character that Shakespeare has written, that you've 
also got to investigate and play, and certainly that's from the inside out.

Falstaff is a totally selfish man, completely egotistical. He has a line at 
one point about "this little kingdom man"; he is a kingdom called Falstaff. He 
can be the life and soul of the party, is enormously witty and subversive and 
exciting to be with. Which is why the prince has become best buddies with him. 
There's a terrific contradiction - he lives just for himself, but you don't 
half have a fun time with him, if you spend an evening in the Bull's Head 
tavern.

friends even better. It appealed on so many personal levels - I used to dance

I'm really proud of doing that film. I fear that the HIV/Aids theme meant that 
it wasn't perhaps seen as much as it should have been. I did as part of my 
research consult with social workers, and they gave me very valuable material 
in creating my character.

It's always so important what the quality of writing is like, and Martin 
Sherman, the way he had written my character who is a social worker working 
with people with HIV and Aids, and who then falls in love with one of these 
people, it was a brilliant piece of characterisation. Because he shows how the 
pressure on my character leads him to drink too much, to be flawed in many 
ways, although he's doing such good work. I love that ambiguity and 
contradiction in characters.

When Greg got the job, we both took a deep breath and said right, well, we've 
got to find a way of making this work. Because there are many stories of the 
artistic directors at these big companies having nervous breakdowns, or their 
marriages falling apart. It is a superhuman job. So far, touch wood, we've 
incorporated it into our lives and a really important thing is we make sure to 
take regular holidays together, to actually carve out times together. That has 
really been an important part of the equation.

We've worked together so many times over the years as director and actor - 10 
or 12 times. That hasn't altered with his new job.

Hi Tony, I’m currently in the process of reading your book on RIII, ‘Year of 
the King’; it’s wonderfully written and the drawings are fantastic, although 
the high point so far has undoubtedly been the anecdote about Michael Gambon. 
Utterly brilliant and hilarious. At the start you mention that you promised 
Harold Pinter that you’d leave the RSC, so what made you stay for all these 
years?

There's a strange inverted snobbery about the RSC. I just discovered that if I 
was to have my career as a theatre actor, rather than in movies and TV, there 
was simply nowhere better to be than the RSC and to devote my career to playing 
Shakespeare. I can't picture a more satisfying career than the one I've been 
lucky enough to have.

We take Shakespeare too much for granted in this country, we can almost forget 
what a genius he is, how brilliant he is. When you play one of the great parts 
and if you succeed in finding a way to play it, it's more satisfying than any 
other acting. It's his remarkable insight into what it is like to be human, his 
characters together become an astonishingly comprehensive picture of us all. He 
deals with every single aspect of all of us - there's no other playwright 
that's ever done that, will ever do that.

Hi Mr Sher, the first time I ever went to the theatre was when my parents took 
me to see you as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice at theBarbican 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican> in the ‘80’s. It is still the 
most incredible experience i’ve ever had at the theatre - you were absolutely 
extraordinary and gave me a love of Shakespeare for life - thank you. My 
question is do you believe Shakespeare was who we all think he was, the actor 
from Stratford, or do you subscribe to any of the conspiracy theories regarding 
his real identity, Marlowe, Bacon etc?

I believe 100% that the actor from Stratford, William Shakespeare, wrote the 
plays byWilliam Shakespeare <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shakespeare>, 
and I've never seen a shred of evidence in any of the conspiracy theories to 
make me believe otherwise.

You performed the title role in Peter Flannery’s play “Singer” in the Swan in 
the late 1980s; what a cast, you, Joe Melia, Malcolm Storrie. I don’t believe 
it’s been revived since, although there was a readthrough done as part of a 
“things the RSC has done in the past” event in Stratford a few years ago. It’s 
a play of its (Thatcherite) times, but what are your memories of performing it, 
and do you think it would speak to audiences today in similar times of 
austerity?

I think Peter Flannery's Singer is one of the best modern plays. It was a 
tremendous experience being in it. It was revived at the Tricycle about ten 
years ago but I'd like to see it go into the repertoire of modern classics and 
be performed regularly.

The theme of the play is one which has preoccupied me a lot in my writing as 
well as acting of the persecuted turning into the persecutor, and with Singer 
we see a man who was in a concentration camp, and suffered there, and turns 
into this ruthless Notting Hill landlord based on the real life character 
Rachman, and then eventually being redeemed.

Classics are just always contemporary - you just apply them to whatever is 
happening. That's why Shakespeare can be done again and again.

Richard III, Iago, Shylock, Malvolio... in a career with the Royal Shakespeare 
Company that started in 1982 Antony Sher has tackled some of the Bard’s most 
reprehensible and rich characters, his own favouritebeing Macbeth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/12/antony-sher-portrait-artist>. 

Not only has his RSC work helped earn him a knighthood and constant critical 
acclaim, his partner Greg Doran runs the company – the pair met during a 
Merchant of Venice production in 1987, and became one of the earliest 
high-profile couples to get a civil partnership.

Doran is currently directing Sher as Falstaff in a production of Henry IV, 
described as a “magnificent” performanceby the Guardian’s Michael Billington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/17/henry-iv-parts-i-and-ii-review-antony-sher-falstaff>
: “Sher balances Falstaff’s cruelty with sufficient charm to justify his role 
as magnetic pub entertainer. But, just as you start to warm to this Falstaff, 
you are reminded of his rapacity.”

With the play continuing at London’s Barbican 
<http://www.rsc.org.uk/whats-on/henry-iv/> until mid-January, Sher is joining 
us to answer your questions about it and anything else in his career – be it 
his own direction, the plays he’s written, or big-screen roles like Disraeli 
opposite Judi Dench’s Victoria in Mrs Brown. It runs from 12.30pm onwards on 
Tuesday 9 December; post your question in the comments below, and he’ll try to 
answer as many as possible.
