Second seed Andre Agassi <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andre-agassi> 
wasted no time brushing aside fellow American Brian Vahaly 7-5 6-3, 6-3 at the 
Australian Open.

The three-times champion took just over two hours to advance to the second 
round where he will meet South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik, who won his first ATP 
title in Sydney at the weekend.

Agassi was unable to defend his title here last year because of a wrist injury 
and looked thrilled to be back on court, blasting 36 clean winners past Vahaly.

"To be back here... there is a lot of nerves," Agassi said courtside 
afterwards. "It's been a while."

Looking forward to Wednesday's match, Agassi added: "He's been playing some 
great tennis and is a great ambassador for tennis in that part of the world - I 
look forward to the challenge.

"Every match needs to get better so let's get started now."

The 32-year-old, bidding to become the first overseas male player to win four 
Australian Open titles, said that his priority in 2003 would be grand slam 
success rather than ranking points.

"It's fair to say that my focus is not on being number one. My focus is being 
No1 at the end of a two-week tournament in one of the slams," Agassi told 
reporters.

Agassi was in the running to become the oldest player to end the year in the 
top spot right until the season-ending Master Cup in Shanghai last November.

But his failure to win the event ensured that Australian Lleyton Hewitt 
finished the year as world No1 for the second year running.

"To be No1, what Lleyton has managed to do, (takes) all year and I'm not 
convinced I have that in me anymore. The fact that I had a shot at it last year 
came as a pleasant surprise to me."

On the eve of the first grand slam of the season, Agassi's coach, Darren 
Cahill, predicted another tight race with Hewitt for the year-ending No1 spot.

Meanwhile Yevgeny Kafelnikov safely booked his place in the second round of 
the Australian Open with a 7-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 win over Jeff Morrison. 
Australian Open champion in 1999 and runner-up in 2000, Kafelnikov recovered 
from a lapse in concentration in the third set to post a comfortable win over 
his American opponent.

Kafelnikov, 28, had considered retiring at the end of last year after helping 
Russia win the Davis Cup for the first time but decided to keep playing.

A former French Open champion and world No1, he plays Jarkko Nieminen in the 
second round after the Finn beat Russia's Australian hardcourt champion Nikolay 
Davydenko 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5.
