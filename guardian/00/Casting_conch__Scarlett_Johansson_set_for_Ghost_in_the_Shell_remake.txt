. The top-dollar pay cheque recognises the US actor’s newfound status as an 
A-list action star following standout turns in Lucy and Marvel Studio’s 
Avengers series of superhero films.
Hollywood’s plan for a debut English-language take on the seminal 1995 Mamoru 
Oshii anime moved a step closer to reality in January when Snow White and the 
Huntsman’s Rupert Sanders washired to direct by studio Dreamworks

. Reports back then suggested the remake would be based on a new screenplay by 
The Reluctant Fundamentalist’s William Wheeler.
The Ghost in the Shell comic book series, film rights to which were picked up 
by Dreamworks co-owner Steven Spielberg in 2009, follows cyborg detective Major 
Motoko Kusanagi, team leader of a futuristic Japanese counterterrorism 
organisation focused on cyber-crime. Three anime films (one made-for-TV) have 
been based on the comic, of which the1995 Ghost in the Shell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ghost-in-the-shell-review-adult-manga-animation-fantasy>
 was the first, as well as an animated Japanese TV series and three video 
games. Spielberg’s planned 3D movie failed to make it to the production stage 
but the approach for Johansson suggests the new iteration may have legs.
In related news, Deadline also reports that Will Smith, Tom Hardy and The Wolf 
of Wall Street’s Margot Robbie are in line to star in comic-book epic Suicide 
Squad for studio Warner Bros. Robbie’s interest may have encouraged Dreamworks 
to approach Johansson for Ghost in the Shell, as the Australian actor was said 
to be an early frontrunner to star in the anime adaptation.
Suicide Squad, about a team of supervillains recruited to take on 
near-impossible black-ops missions in return for the commutation of their 
sentences, is on Warner’s newly announced slate of 10 movies set in the DC 
Comics universe. It is due to follow Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice into 
cinemas some time in 2016.
