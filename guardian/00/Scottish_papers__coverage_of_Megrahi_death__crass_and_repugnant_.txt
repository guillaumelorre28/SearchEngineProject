Scottish journalist Kenneth Roy laments the way in which newspapers in 
Scotland covered the death of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, the man convicted of
the Lockerbie plane bombing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103>. 

In a piece headlined The coverage of his death has been crass and repugnant  
<http://www.scottishreview.net/KRoy274.shtml> he railed against the way in 
which most papers saw the death in terms of controversy over his early release 
on compassionate grounds rather than "the extreme doubts over the safety of his 
conviction."

Here's his round-up of the page one headlines:- Daily Record: DO NOT MOURN 
THIS MONSTER. The Sun: NO PITY (page 2: He finally dies...2 years 6 months too 
late). Daily Mail: DEATH OF BOMBER AND THE SHAMING OF JUSTICE. The Scotsman: 
THE BOMBER IS DEAD

But the Daily Express <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailyexpress>, noted 
Roy, "was at least prepared to admit a doubt of its own, avoiding dogmatic 
certainty". Its headline: NOW TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT LOCKERBIE.

Roy writes: "Only the Herald and The Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian> afforded the dead man the 
dignity of a name in its main headline.

"Both also studiously avoided calling him 'the Lockerbie bomber'... instead, 
it more accurately described him as the only person convicted of involvement. 
Pedantic, of course; but honourably and essentially so."

He was also critical of BBC Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> 
for having "the Lockerbie bomber" label across its coverage. He writes: "It is, 
as ever, interesting that the Scottish controller is unable or unwilling to 
impose journalistic standards on his own staff."
