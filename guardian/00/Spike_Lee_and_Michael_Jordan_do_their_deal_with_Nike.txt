The spread of hip-hop culture has gone hand in hand with the global rise of 
sportswear and trainers are the touchstone between the two. Run-DMC made 
trainers cool – even cooler if unlaced – but it was the prodigious Chicago 
Bulls shooting guard Michael Jordan who turned that coolness into a business 
phenomenon. Jordan signed with Nike in 1985 and the Air Jordan followed shortly 
after, its black and red colouring a new twist that caused it to be banned by 
the NBA. The ensuing controversy helped make millions of dollars for Nike. In 
1988, Jordan was paired withSpike Lee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/spikelee> in a series of iconic commercials 
for the Air Jordan 3. Lee plays his Mars Blackmon character, a motormouth B-boy 
who appeared in She's Gotta Have It. All Jordan wants to do is play basketball, 
while Lee is obsessed with the trainers. "Do you know who the best player in 
the game is?" asks Lee, arms resting on the rim. "Me. Mars Blackmon. Do you 
know how I get up for my game? That's right. Air Jordan," he says as the camera 
pans down to show him standing on Jordan's shoulders. After this ad, street and 
sports cool were fused fast.
