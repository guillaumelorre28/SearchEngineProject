Interestingly enough, it was the cry for inclusion of the fictional cities of 
Besźel and Ul Qoma that commanded most attention in the comments accompanying 
our 10 best city novels. Brought to life in China Miéville’sThe City & The City,
the novel seems to have struck a chord with readers, with Eisenhorn commenting, 
“I can only prostrate myself in wonder at the mere notion of the city of 
Besźel. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

Based in rather more familiar settings, another popular nomination was Patrick 
Hamilton’sHangover Square. Set between Earls Court and Brighton, this novel 
benefits from the author’s intimate relationships with the two areas, and 
explores the mood of a life of intoxication in 1939. The hero’s foray to 
Brighton provides a brief interlude to the gritty realities of inter-war London.

Described by robmcinroy as “bringing the city to life in a remarkable way”, 
Cormac McCarthy’sSuttree is set in Knoxville, Tennessee. It’s a 
semi-autobiographical novel that sees its protagonist living alone and in exile 
on the Tennessee River. Despite most of the novel’s action taking place on the 
river, McCarthy still leaves room to immortalise the characters found in 1950s 
Knoxville.

Dubbed the “German Ulysses” by spaknapak, Döblin’s Berlin Alexanderplatz 
explores the criminal underbelly of Weimar-era Berlin. Following the exploits 
of Franz Biberkopf, a small-time criminal desperately trying (in vain) to go 
straight, Döblin depicts with his all-seeing authorial voice the life of 
late-1920s Berlin, with its tapestry of gangsters, thieves and rapidly 
approaching political and social upheaval.

Despite not winning points with readers for the “whining of the midlife-crisis 
narrator”,Night Train to Lisbon has nonetheless captured attention for its 
“grasp of Lisbon’s atmosphere”. Adapted for cinema in 2013, the novel is a 
philosophical one, showcasing the city as the protagonist abandons his current 
life to explore the one he never lived, investigating an obscure Portuguese 
doctor in the process.

Another popular suggestion is one that, again, combines reality with fictional 
settings.Lanark combines its author’s imagined city of Unthank with his real 
life experiences of Glasgow, and was hailed by the Guardian in 2008 as ‘one of 
the landmarks of 20th century fiction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/alasdair.gray>’. Divided into 
four books, this dystopian novel has been described by readers as ‘wonderful’.

Pedigree

Suggested by Yasuda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/15/the-10-best-city-novels#comment-52225257>

Published in 1948 and capturing the essence of Liege, Pedigree is ‘about the 
most you’ll ever need to know about a city in Belgium’, according to Yasuda. 
The novel, based almost entirely on the author’s childhood, chronicles the 
growth of both man and city from 1903 until Liege’s liberation from German 
occupation in 1918.

Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky 

Patrick Hamilton (1935)

Suggested by RedComyn

Chronicling ‘a lost Fitzrovia’, Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky is 
another London-based favourite. Originally published as a trilogy of 
semi-autobiographical novels by Hamilton, the books centre on a pub, The 
Midnight Bell, and those who frequent it, immortalising a neighbourhood of 
London and its residents.

Mikhail Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita made it into the original list 
thanks to its depiction of Moscow. Less well known, hisThe White Guard captures 
the atmosphere in Ukraine as a civil war rages in Kiev. Bulgakov’s detailed 
knowledge of the city is obvious to any reader, and his “memorable” 
descriptions have ensured the lesser-known novel a place on this list.

The final reader suggestion comes courtesy of FattMatt, who credits the 
Inspector Morse series for its thorough coverage of Oxford. Spanning 13 books 
and immortalised by John Thaw in the ITV television series, these crime novels 
detail the city’s streets and attractions. The novels have led to several 
Inspector Morse-themed Oxford tours.
