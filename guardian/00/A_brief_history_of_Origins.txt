What are Origins' origins?
Launched in 1990 by Leonard Lauder, son of Estee, Origins was the first 
prestige skincare brand to focus on using natural ingredients in its products. 
Born from an awareness in beauty industry quarters of a market that was 
becoming increasingly concerned with environmental issues, Origins' plan was to 
create high-performance products "powered by nature and proven by science". 
With a range of ingredients that sound like they've been gathered from a 
collection of pretentious gap years (bark of the mimosa tree found in northern 
Brazil, silver tip white tea found in the Fujian Province of China...), what 
damage they may create in air miles are somewhat made up for by a serious 
attitude to using recycled or responsibly sourced packaging, not testing on 
animals and using wind and hydro-power in their production processes.

All sounds great, but are the products any good?
Yes indeed. Their VitaZing moisturiser (£26 for 50ml, origins.co.uk) is a 
brilliant multi-tasker. It's made using fruits of the Mangosteen tree of India 
(I'm not making this up, honest) which possesses anti-oxidant properties great 
for the skin. The fab thing about this product though is that it looks 
un-pigmented when applied but actually develops a sheer colour, enhancing skin 
tone while evening it out. It just makes you look a little bit more healthy. I 
find it's that rare thing - a tinted moisturiser that actually moisturises as 
well as giving a subtle but noticeable coverage.

What's coming up in the future?
New for October is the Plantscription eye treatment 
<http://www.origins.co.uk/products/3855/Skincare/Category/Eye-Care/index.tmpl?cm_sp=Gnav-_-Skincare-_-EyeCare>
 (£45 for 30ml), building on the success of the Plantscription anti-ageing 
serum launched earlier this year (£45 for 30ml). More bizarre sounding plants 
from ridiculously exotic places have been used in such a way to mimic the good 
bits of retinoic acid – the prescription anti-wrinkle ingredient that can come 
with some nasty side-effects. The Plantscription products, thankfully, come 
without those risks of flaking, burning and itching, and are therefore seen as 
something of a scientific breakthrough. All thanks to some tree native to Ghana 
harvested by local tribes (again, I'm not making this up).
