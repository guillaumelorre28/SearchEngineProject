It scarcely seems credible now, but ahead of Studio 54 as Billboard's Best 
Disco in the World 1978 was a northern ballroom that didn't even have a bar. 
However, in its pomp, the Casino (capacity: 1,200) had more than 100,000 
members. And testament to its influence – aside from spawning a pop subculture 
and proto-breakdance moves – is the fact that the next decade's hipsters, from 
Marc Almond to Paul Weller, and svengalis from Pete Waterman to Ian Levine, 
took the train to Wigan and put the communal spirit of Casino soul into their 
work.
