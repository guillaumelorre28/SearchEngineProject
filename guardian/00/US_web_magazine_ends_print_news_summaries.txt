Slate <http://slate.com/> magazine has retired one of the earliest news 
aggregators, as its daily print news summaryToday's Papers is making way for 
The Slatest. The Washington Post (NYSE: WPO 
<http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&Ticker=WPO>) 
Company-owned online mag's editor David Plotztells the NYT 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/business/media/24slate.html?ref=media> that 
news moves a lot faster these days than it did 12 years ago, when the 
once-a-day newspaper and magazine round-up debuted. Therefore,The Slatest will 
be updated three times a day, along with a Twitter feed. The change, which has 
been in the works for a year, isn't a commentary on the importance of 
newspapers. However, Plotz says it does reflect that in a constantly moving 
24-hour news cycle, "the daily newspaper is only one part of the news universe. 
That's why we're expanding our aggregation efforts so aggressively."
