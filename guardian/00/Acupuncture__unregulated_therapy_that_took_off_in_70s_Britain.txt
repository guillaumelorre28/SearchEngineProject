The first known British acupuncturist was John Churchill who, in 1821, 
published a series of results on the treatment of tympany [ear infections or 
deafness] and rheumatism with acupuncture.

Acupuncture <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/acupuncture> has become 
increasingly popular since the early 1970s when travel restrictions between the 
east and west were eased.

It is hard to estimate the number of acupuncturists in Britain as the practise 
is unregulated. The British Acupuncture Council, the UK's largest body of 
professional acupuncturists, has about 3,000 members.

The NHS offers limited acupuncture and most patients pay for private 
treatment. Currently, the National Institute forHealth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> and Clinical Excellence (Nice) 
only recommends acupuncture as a treatment option for lower back pain.

Conclusive evidence of its effectiveness has proved hard to establish. Some 
studies suggested that acupuncture can slightly improve the chances of a woman 
become pregnant during IVF treatment. But others found it made no difference.

There have been similarly mixed results on the affects of acupuncture on 
arthritis. Two studies on osteoarthritis of the knee found that the procedure 
helped, but more recent research found there wasn't much difference between 
people having acupuncture or sham (placebo) acupuncture.

Trials on treatment for headaches took into account the placebo effect by 
comparing authentic acupuncture to a sham procedure. Overall traditional 
acupuncture produced slightly better results.
