The prime minister of Antigua & Barbuda has appointed the actor Robert De Niro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro> as special economic envoy of 
the twin-island nation in the eastern Caribbean.

The administration of Gaston Browne said in a statement on Saturday that the 
appointment comes after De Niro signed a memorandum of agreement on Friday for 
a $250m hotel investment in Barbuda.

Officials said De Niro and Australian businessman James Packer will help 
renovate and expand a former five-star luxury resort that closed several years 
ago.

Browne said he expects the deal to be signed in late December and for 
construction to begin in the next 12 months.

He said De Niro will help attract more investment and American celebrities to 
Antigua & Barbuda as special economic envoy.
