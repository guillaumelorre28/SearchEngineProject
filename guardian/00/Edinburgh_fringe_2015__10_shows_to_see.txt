Vertical Influences
Assembly at Murrayfield ice rink 
<https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/vertical-influences>
Dancing on ice … but not as you know it. The Canadian company Le Patin Libre  
<http://lepatinlibre.com/en/>are five former figure-skaters whose audacious ice 
shows share the style and humour of street dance – think B-boys on blades. The 
audience sit right on the rink for the second show in this high-speed 
double-bill. If you’re thinking of booking, get your skates on – they perform 
at weekends only.

Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour
Traverse theatre 
<https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/our-ladies-of-perpetual-succour>
An adaptation of Alan Warner’s riotous novel The Sopranos, about six Catholic 
schoolgirls from a seaside town who are out on the lash in Auld Reekie before a 
choir competition. Billy Elliot’s Lee Hall has turned the book into a show that 
he describes as being more like a gig than a play or a musical. Vicky 
Featherstone directs a cast of six, who play some 50 characters between them.

James Acaster: Represent
Pleasance Courtyard 
<https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/james-acaster-represent>
Will it be fourth time lucky for James Acaster at the Edinburgh comedy awards 
after three consecutive years’ nominations? The angular standup, whose delivery 
has been likened to Jarvis Cocker’s, specialises in indignation, revels in the 
guise of a man who thinks he has the world sussed, and makes you reconsider the 
most seemingly innocuous items (this year, it’s the humbleChristingle 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christingle>).

Close Up
Underbelly, George Square <https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/close-up>
The Australian circus company Circa are known for dizzying displays of 
endurance but, as they proved in last year’s show, they can also create poetry 
from nothing more than a man dancing with a sheet of paper. This year, in a 
piece inspired byAntonioni’s Blow-Up 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu0-keZ4KKY>, they are performing against a 
video backdrop that displays their moves in slow motion, whileaudience members 
are invited to touch the acrobats’ bodies

The Solid Life of Sugar Water
Pleasance Dome 
<https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/solid-life-of-sugar-water>
In between his Royal Court drama about local government budgets (Hope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/03/hope-jack-thorne-royal-court-review>
) and his forthcomingHarry Potter show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/26/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-to-open-in-west-end-in-2016>
 in the West End, Jack Thorne presents a play that looks at the impact of a 
stillbirth on a couple’s relationship, and in particular, their sex life. This 
two-hander will be raw, for sure, but apparently finds room for humour, too. 
It’s directed by Amit Sharma of the disabled-led company Graeae.

wrestles with, among other things, her identities as a comedian, a performance 
artist and a feminist.

A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing
Traverse theatre 
<https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/girl-is-a-half-formed-thing-by-eimear-mcbride>
According to Annie Ryan, who adapted it, Eimear McBride’s award-winning 
coming-of-age novel A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing “begs to be spoken”. That 
much is clear from the first lines: “For you. You’ll soon. You’ll give her 
name. In the stitches of her skin she’ll wear your say. Mammy me? Yes you. 
Bounce the bed, I’d say.” Ryan has refashioned the tale as aBeckettian solo show
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/30/a-girl-is-a-half-formed-thing-review-eimear-mcbride-dublin-theatre-festival>
 in which Aoife Duffin plays the disturbed heroine.

Paradise Lost (lies unopened beside me)
Summerhall

London’s contemporary dance centre The Place <http://www.theplace.org.uk/> has 
a residency at the fringe this year, presenting a trio of productions including 
Lost Dog’s irreverent take on Milton’s epic poem. Retold through spoken word, 
music (including Janis Joplin) and movement, it’s a solo show performed byBen 
Duke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/may/19/a-nations-theatre-ben-duke-lost-dog-on-leaving-london>
, who has won acclaim for his witty and stylish dance-theatre performances such 
as Like Rabbits, adapted from a Virginia Woolf short story.

In his sharp, 2014 free-fringe show Capitalism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/10/liam-williams-review-edinburgh-festival-2014-capitalism>
, Liam Williams presented us with a Fight Club-style alter ego and took himself 
to task for his revolutionary posturing and ultimate submission to the 
capitalist machine. This year, he brings a new solo set,Bonfire Night 
<https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/liam-williams-bonfire-night-1>, and 
performs with his sketch trioSheeps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/10/invisible-dot-cabaret-review-manchester-international-festival-mif-sheeps-mae-martin-phil-ellis>
, whose knockabout energy contrasts with his downbeat solo style. With fellow 
Sheeps Alistair Roberts and Daran Johnson, he’ll present an hour of sparky, 
topical satire. It’s a non-ticketed free show, so turn up early. And watch out 
for two other sketch trios:Massive Dad
