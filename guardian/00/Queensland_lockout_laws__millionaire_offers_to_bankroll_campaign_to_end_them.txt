A Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> 
rich-lister has vowed to “bankroll whatever is necessary” for a campaign to 
wind back the state’s lockout laws, saying the full force of a popular backlash 
is yet to come.

The Palaszczuk government has hinted it may consider dropping its “one-way 
door” measure if earlier closing times, which begin on Friday as the first 
phase of new statewide licensing laws, are shown to cut drunken violence.

But Scott Hutchinson, the chairman of the state’s largest private construction 
company and a longtime live music supporter, says he has given up on lobbying 
the government and doubts whether anything short of a full-blown political 
campaign to rob it of votes will change its mind.

“I’ve tried to change things internally the quiet way but you’re not going 
to,” Hutchinson told Guardian Australia. “All you can do here is ram through.”

The 1am lockout, which mirrors measures in Sydney which have been acused by 
some of having a chilling effect on the city’s night life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/04/sydney-lockout-laws-a-sledgehammer-to-night-life-clover-moore>
, is due to be introduced in Queensland from next February.

From Friday night, liquor shots will be banned after midnight and late-night 
venues closed from 3am and others from 2am.

The police minister, Bill Byrne, talking about the laws on Thursday said he 
had “an open mind on many things”.

“Let’s just wait and see what happens,” he said.

“I have an open mind to all sorts of propositions from time to time. But right 
now we want to see the measures that we have fought very hard for, that we’ve 
taken through parliamentary debate, we have had a full engagement with the 
community on, I want to see those measures brought in and see the results we 
expect.”

But Hutchinson said it was hard to see the government changing its position in 
view of the key role played by cabinet member Anthony Lynham. Lynham, a 
maxillofacial surgeon, was a vocal and perennial campaigner for curbing alcohol 
licensing conditions for late night venues before entering politics.

“How are you going to do it? I tried to get it stopped on the floor,” 
Hutchinson said.

“I help the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> a lot and I’ve been a 
member of the CFMEU for nearly two decades and most of them are not in favour 
of it.

“This is all about one doctor whose vote they needed … That’s all it’s about.

“And the people they’re treating so shabbily at the moment are their 
supporters, which is generally the music industry, and the arts in general 
leans towards Labor.

“But the Liberals are going to take it from them.”

A spokeswoman for Lynham said he was on leave and unavailable.

Hutchinson is co-owner of inner-Brisbane music venue The Triffid with former 
Powderfinger bassist John Collins. The builder, whosefamily’s fortune was 
estimated by BRW at $260m in 2013

, said the Triffid venture would not be affected under a lockout as it did not 
operate with a late-night licence.

“It’s negative for me to be the poster boy for all this crazy stuff,” he said. 
“For me, this is isn’t about money. I’m not going to make more or less money 
out of this. This is aboutBrisbane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/brisbane>.

“And of course [the lockout] doesn’t apply to the casino. It’s so cynical. 
They don’t care about music but they care about money.”

Hutchinson said the government would lose votes from a natural constituency 
which it had ignored in bringing in the laws.

“Brisbane’s a real incubator for music at the moment and they didn’t consult 
us at all about this, they didn’t consult the music industry one bit, they 
didn’t care less,” Hutchinson said.

“They’ve taken those people as Labor voters and they won’t change their vote. 
Well, they will.

Given time, lockout laws will spark a Sydney underground renaissance

“Young people are already turning. This is going to give Labor a stupid look 
for the next decade if they’re not [willing to change policy].”

Hutchinson, who for years has been a mainstay in the crowd at local music 
festivals and gigs, said the consolation for the Queensland music scene was the 
cautionary tale offered bySydney’s experience with lockout laws 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/21/thousands-march-through-sydney-to-protest-against-nightlife-lockout-laws>
.

“It didn’t really start getting people in Sydney angry until it actually came 
in,” he said.

“People here just can’t actually believe it’s coming in. Once it comes in, 
then they get angry, they see people going broke, the streets start getting 
cleared, businesses are in trouble.”

Hutchinson said a local anti-lockout campaign would be able to match a protest 
crowd of 15,000 people and “I’m going to bankroll whatever is necessary”.
