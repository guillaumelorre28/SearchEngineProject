I happened to run into one of the artists who has organised this exhibition. 
He was lamenting that, since theStedelijk Museum <http://www.stedelijk.nl/> 
closed for renovation, there are very few places where contemporary art can be 
displayed. So he and his team decided to make just such an expo, and Beeld Hal 
Werk is the result.

Beeld Hal Werk can have different meanings but, when pronounced, it sounds 
like the Dutch word for sculpture, some 60 examples of which are on display.

Climb the tower in the middle for a nice overview - it's also is a good 
location for watching my favourite exhibit:Zoro <http://www.zorofeigl.nl/>'s 
spinning cloth disc, which makes a very industrial sound and is a hypnotising 
image.

The location is a former industrial factory where the light changes frequently 
during the day, giving different views to the works. For a nice contrast with 
all the metal and concrete, get a beer or two from the bar and enjoy views of 
the lake. Closure is planned for the end of October so go while it lasts.

• Beeld Hal Werk <http://www.beeldhalwerk.nl/>, Gedempt Hamerkanaal 85.

The Na und?! is one of the original pubs in the St Pauli area, with jukebox, 
lots of smoke, more alcohol and typical St Pauli regulars.

When you enter, you are welcomed by Klaus, who seems to have been born behind 
the bar, and chain smokes despite having hardly any voice. If you meet him, he 
will surely tell you about his parrot and pour you some of his green booze-mix.

This mix - and Klaus - are what make this bar famous. Just ask for the green 
special-mixed booze (I can't remember the name, as it is very hard). He will 
know what you mean. And only take one! I can tell you, that is enough. Than go 
to the jukebox and listen to some hits from past decades. When you want to move 
on there is theToast bar 
<http://www.spottedbylocals.com/hamburg/toast-bar-peanuts/> across the street.

At weekends you might meet young people on their way to bars and clubs here, 
but during the week it has more character when it fills with regulars.

• Na und?!, Wohlwillstraße 47, Sankt Pauli. Beer €2. Open from 5pm daily. Show

One of the most charming restaurants I have been to in Ghent. At De Avonden 
there is no fancy fusion cuisine, just some nice homemade cooking - real simple 
plates like hutsepot, beans and other stuff that you can choose from the big 
blackboard on the wall.

When we last went there, my friend and I both ordered some oysters. The 
portions are really generous, there was not one table that could finish 
everything.

As they don't have a large menu, some items can sell out and you may have to 
compromise, like we did with our wine. But it is entirely forgiven. Making 
reservations is a must.

• De Avonden <http://www.deavondengent.be/> (Grandmother's kitchen), Ham 39, 
city centre; +32 9233 5349. Meal €10. Open Mon–Fri from 6pm.Show on map

M1 is a charming tram that guides you from TrashArt Museum 
<http://www.spottedbylocals.com/berlin/trashart-museum/> (next to Pankow subway 
station) to Pergamon Museum (next to Am Kupfergraben). It is a lyrical 
transition from an upcycling museum (TrashArt lends new eyes and colours to 
disposable things collected together in a garage complex) to a classical, 
imposing, centrally located museum.

The journey takes you through the packed bar district of Kastanienallee 
<http://www.spottedbylocals.com/berlin/kastanienallee/>, past the Weinerei 
restaurant where you only pay what you think it's worth 
<http://www.spottedbylocals.com/berlin/weinerei-fra-rosa/>, the pioneering 
grafitti art houseTacheles <http://www.spottedbylocals.com/berlin/tacheles/> and
Friedrichstadt-Palast <http://www.show-palace.eu/> theatre. M1 will not 
disappoint you as a guide.

M1 never sleeps; it works the whole night, all week long. M1 keeps you warm, 
dry and can take you from north to middle Berlin. Above all, the tour will only 
cost you €2.10 (price of a one-way trip). M1 is the coolest tram Berlin has!

• M1, Pankow subway station. Ticket: €2.10. 24 hours daily. Show on map

Athens: Jazz 'n' Jazz – it's all about jazz

I always arrive out of breath at this bar, longing for a beer, as it's a 
little bit of an up-hill climb. There is a big, old bike outside the door that 
always makes me think, are you kidding me? No way I am coming here by bike!

Filled with vintage decoration, pictures of jazz musicians, CDs and jazz music 
(played at exactly the right volume), you will most probably stay here until 
they throw you out. (They are quite strict with the curfew.) On big nights out 
it is full and, as it's not big, finding a seat is a victory.

Right as you walk into the bar, take a look at the door intercom. You will 
find the names of some great musicians - sometimes, they do live there.

• Jazz 'n' Jazz, Deinokratous 4, Kolonaki; +30 2107258362. Drinks €6.50.
