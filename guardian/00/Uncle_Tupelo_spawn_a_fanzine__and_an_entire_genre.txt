Jeff Tweedy and Jay Farrar were punk rock kids from Illinois who decided to 
try their hands at country. As Uncle Tupelo, they named their first album after 
a 1936 song by the Carter Family, No Depression (in Heaven), and found their 
return to American roots music had struck a nerve: soon there was a fanzine 
with the same name, and like-minded bands springing up around the US. 
Alt-country had been born.
