In this three hour course, you’ll learn the age-old principles of storytelling 
in order to develop and give a knock-out presentation.TEDx 
<http://tedxsydney.com/>Sydney performance director, Stephen Feneley, will run 
you through how to grab an audience’s attention from the opening line and 
provide a story arch that holds them to the end.

Stephen will give you tips on how to make your audience care by foregrounding 
the human dimension, telling the story from a personal perspective, no matter 
how dry or technical the subject matter might be. There are basic principles of 
effective communication that remain true regardless of the type of media 
through which we choose to speak to our target audience, whether it be 
customers (existing and potential), the financial markets, regulators or our 
own workforce.

This three hour lecture will involve participation from attendees. If you 
choose, you will have the chance to have your presentation style constructively 
critiqued. After an intense and hopefully not too anxiety inducing session 
attendees can head to the venue bar to unwind and debrief.

This course is for you if...

 * You work in an industry where you have to express ideas clearly and concise 
way 
 * You’re a consultant and you need develop new clients 
 * You’re a startup looking to engage backers 
 * You’re a communications professional 
Course description

This course looks at the top line of presentations. The emphasis is on 
audience engagement and is driven, to a large degree, by the audience’s 
comments and observations. Numbers are limited to 60 people to encourage 
participation (individual pitching sessions will be no longer than 3-5 minutes).

Topics on the day include:

 * Why engage?

 * The importance of establishing a business case for going public

 * A step-by-step guide on how to prepare

 * Control technique – owning the interview and presentation tips

 * Understanding what the media wants & how to provide it on your terms

 * The risks and opportunities of social media 
Stephen Feneley will have a videographer on site to film some participants and 
offer constructive feedback. You will leave this Masterclass with the tools and 
confidence to build an engaging presentation using specific storytelling 
techniques.

Please note: it is strongly encouraged that participants come armed with ideas 
and a pitch ready to be workshopped.
