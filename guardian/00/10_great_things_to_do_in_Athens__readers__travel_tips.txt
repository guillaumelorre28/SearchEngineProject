Food Str

Super range of options at this burger joint for both meat-lovers and veggies 
alike – the parmesan and mushroom burger is a particular delight. Perfect way 
to end a night out in Athens.

A great place to eat, whether it’s in the winter when it’s snug and 
atmospheric, or the summer when you can sit on the roof terrace with a 
spectacular view of the Acropolis. Prices are reasonable and the food is 
delicious, particularly the smoked pork with prunes.

Lake Vouliagmeni

At this lake 20km from the city, underground hot springs keep the temperature 
at 24C and the mineral and salt in the water are said to cure almost anything 
from arthritis to skin complaints. Look out for early- and late-summer special 
events at the lake, such as jazz nights and theatre performances.

Gazarte

A venue that blends live music with a cinema, bar-restaurant and bookshop. The 
music is high-quality, with artists such as Eli Paspalla or Dave Holland. The 
cinema is non-mainstream, and the food and ambience very pleasant.

Skoufias Taverna

Hidden in the Omonia area, this taverna is popular with local housewives and 
workers. It is terrific value and many dishes have a Cretan influence – my 
favourite is red rooster with ouzo.

Thea Terrace Bar, Central Hotel

Panoramic views of Athens and the Acropolis from this rooftop bar. Time your 
visit to coincide with the sunset – made more dramatic by the gradual 
illumination of the Acropolis. Sip a cocktail and enjoy mezze served by 
friendly staff. Pure theatre!

The Art Foundation

Great space for drinks during the day and then even better at night, when the 
place is lit up. Grab a drink and explore the art exhibitions within the 
building. There is no roof in the middle so it’s a great place to admire the 
stars on a warm Athens night.

Kokkinos Lotos

Sip your favourite tipple lounging on comfy cushions round a rustic table or 
standing at the bar where you order, which helps keep prices very reasonable. 
The atmosphere’s buzzing.
