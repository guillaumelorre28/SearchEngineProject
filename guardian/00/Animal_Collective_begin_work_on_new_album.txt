Animal Collective <https://www.theguardian.com/music/animalcollective> have 
begun work on their ninth studio album. The Technicolor indie tribe have 
written 15 new songs, which they plan to record in January.

"We're really excited about this record," Avey Tare told Madison.com

"We just finished another two weeks of writing sessions and put together five 
[more] new songs â€¦ It's been really fun jamming with those guys again."

Whereas 2009's Merriweather Post Pavilion was recorded in Mississippi, Animal 
Collective's forthcoming LP may be laid down in their hometown of Baltimore, 
Maryland. The band relocated there from New York almost a year ago, "hunkering 
down" with new material, Tare told theBaltimore Sun

. "[The album's] informed more by being in a wooded setting, by the nature in 
Maryland," he said in July. At that time they had 10 songs written, described 
as "more immediate" than Merriweather Post Pavilion. It also marks the return 
of Deakin, an Animal Collective co-founder, who took a break from the band's 
last album.

Merriweather Post Pavilion has been Animal Collective's most successful 
release, reaching No 26 in the UK and No 13 in the US.
