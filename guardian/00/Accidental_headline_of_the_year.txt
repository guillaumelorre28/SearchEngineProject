The Daily Express had a prime example over the weekend of what can happen when 
you fiddle around with a headline.
 First edition 
The first edition of Saturday's paper carried the headline "Can Dec finally 
match Ant?" on a two-page feature about the ITV presenters, with the word 
"finally" cut between two pages.
 Final edition 
Apparently, there were too many headlines with "finally" in, so it was changed 
to "Can Dec at last match Ant?" But along the way, someone forgot to change 
both sides of the spread, leaving the "a" of "at" on one page and "nally" of 
"finally" on the other, creating the memorable headline "Can Dec anally match 
Ant?" in some later editions. One for the scrapbook, Monkey thinks.
