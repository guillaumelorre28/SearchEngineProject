Telling the story of Zoro, a misunderstood graffiti artist who finally garners 
the respect he craves when he comes into contact with a posh uptown journalist, 
Wild Style is not necessarily a movie worth watching for the plot. But what the 
first entry in the annals of hip-hop cinema lacks in narrative, it makes up for 
in documentary value. With a cast made up of the likes of Fab 5 Freddy and 
Grandmaster Flash, and the lead role taken by graffiti artist Lee Quinones, 
Wild Style turns the camera on real-life, old-school icons. Furthermore, with 
the movie filmed on location uptown, it also captures the city of New York at 
the height of the hip-hop boom.
