 A US judge has banned a doctor's wife from releasing a 1994 videotape showing 
a breast implant operation being carried out on former Playboy model Anna 
Nicole Smith, who died earlier this year.
Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff's preliminary injunction against Alana 
Johnson on Friday is similar to one he issued last month against her husband 
Gerald, from Texas, who performed the surgery.

Both injunctions were sought by Smith's former attorney and executor of her 
will, Howard Stern. His attorney, Bruce Ross, said they prevent the sale, 
distribution or dissemination of the tape and order the couple to give the tape 
to Stern. Smith died of an accidental drug overdose in Florida in February. She 
was 39.

Stern maintained Smith never consented to having her surgery recorded and the 
doctor sent a tape of the procedure to Thomas Riccio, a Los Angeles-based 
memorabilia dealer.
