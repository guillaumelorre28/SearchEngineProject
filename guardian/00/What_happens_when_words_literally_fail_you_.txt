I am a word nerd. I collect them. I play about with them. And I like being a 
little bit mystified by them as well. Take that phraseword nerd for instance. 
It shouldn’t really rhyme quite so perfectly, should it? And yet it does. How 
doesthat work?

And then there are other little mysteries hidden inside every word we speak 
and every sentence we write. I first spotted how fantastically random language 
can be when I was a lot younger than I am now. I was sharing a flat with a 
Belgian girl in the middle of Brussels, and our conversations would flip 
backwards and forwards between French and English in an effort to help each 
other learn. My dodgy French was never going to win me any prizes but I began 
to see English in a whole new light. Everyday exchanges would suddenly spin off 
in strange directions and turn into something mind-melting. It would happen 
like this:

Me:  Sandrine, have we got any teabags?

Sandrine:  Yeah, we have any.

Me:  (trying to be helpful) Yeah, but what you mean is… we’ve got SOME 
teabags. So where are they then?

Sandrine: (confused) Huh? You asked me if we have ANY teabags and I mean YES 
we have ANY! So what are you saying? What is this SOME?

Me:  (long pause) I dunno.

Sandrine:  And in reality, Hayley, what is even the point of this word called 
GOT?

Me:  (even longer pause) I dunno that either.

 My word-boggling experiences in Brussels are a joy I won’t ever forget. It’s 
hardly any wonder then that, years later, when I decided to write a book about 
secrets and shock and what happens when wordsliterally fail you, I chose 
Brussels as the setting of my story. That story becameSophie Someone

It’s a mystery story really. Sophie Nieuwenleven is 14 and lives with her mum, 
dad and little brother in a flat in the heart of Brussels. Her mum reads 
English magazines, her brother likes Dr Who and her dad supports Norwich City. 
In fact, the family are English in every single way - except for their Brussels 
address and their Belgian surname. But Sophie has dim memories of a life before 
they moved to Brussels. And sometimes, it isn’t clear whether Sophie’s dad is 
called Gurt or Gary. And quite a lot of things about the family’s history just 
don’t quite add up.

The mystery is locked inside the family, and Sophie has the responsibility of 
being both my narrator and my detective. And what she discovers leaves her so 
flabbergasted that she doesn’t know how to put her story into words. Which left 
me with a challenge. As a writer, I always try to choose exactly the right 
words for the job. But how could I let my readers shareany sense of Sophie’s 
confusion if I carefully took every bit of confusion away?

And then I remembered my conversations with Sandrine and I had an idea. 
English is already fairly random so why not deliberately make it a little more 
random? Why not give Sophie her own special way with words? That way, she’d be 
back in control. She could say whatever she wanted without having to go through 
the pain ofactually saying it at all.

So page by page, I started drip-feeding Sophie’s code words into the story. 
And soon it was paragraph by paragraph and then sentence by sentence. And 
before I knew it, Sophie had her own unique voice which could only make sense 
to those readers who had started at the beginning and stayed with her every 
word of the way.

I knew I was taking a risk. After all, not everyone wants to read a novel 
where friends are freckles and secrets are serpents, do they? Or where the only 
person who can provide an answer to all of Sophie’s quibbles is an old wombat 
called Jean whose profile she found on Faxbucket.

But once I had the idea, it was always a risk I was going to take. Because an 
idea isn’t really anything at all if you don’t do something with it. And 
anyway, I knew that I wasn’t the only word nerd in the world. And I wanted to 
flush out a few more of them. I know Sophie’s story is safe with them.
