Hymns

The urge to sing hymns

has recently

caught on amongst bank-robbers

With stentorian voices

they praise God

while the cashier sinks to her knees

and the bank manager

chiming in

turns out his pockets

Pianos

That pianos

should not merely be cooked

but also smoked

has recently been discovered

by pure chance

A fire in the local piano store

surprisingly revealed

that smoked pianos

sound nobler than cooked ones

In huge fireplaces

they now hang

those dispensers of musical delight

like blackened hams

before

smokey-grey and spicy

they satisfy the cognoscenti

Henceforth

the famous house of Bösenstein

will refrain

from boiling pianos hard or soft

according to taste

Laughing angels

Where those laughing angels

could have emerged from

remains obscure

Unfit for singing

they appear to some of us

devils in disguise

if not downright human

Others

see them as children

who never learnt to be wise

giggling

in the face of a threatening world

unfeeling like gods
