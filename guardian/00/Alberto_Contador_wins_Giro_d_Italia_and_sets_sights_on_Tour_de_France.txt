Alberto Contador <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador> enhanced 
his status as one of the greatest grand tour riders when the Spaniard clinched 
his second Giro d’Italia title on Sunday after finishing safely in the bunch in 
the final stage won by Belgian Iljo Keisse.

The Tinkoff-Saxo leader, who won the three-week race for the first time in 
2008, became the second rider after Frenchman Bernard Hinault to have won the 
three grand tours (Tour de France, Giro, Vuelta) at least twice.

His seventh title also takes him up to fourth place in the list of the 
all-time grand tour winners behind Eddy Merckx (11), Hinault (10) and Jacques 
Anquetil (8), and level with Miguel Indurain and Fausto Coppi.

Contador, who lost his 2010 Tour and 2011 Giro titles after a positive dope 
test, will now attempt to become the first rider since the late Marco Pantani 
in 1998 to achieve the Giro-Tour double.

The competition, however, will be fierce as most of the Tour de France 
pretenders were not competing in the Giro – Chris Froome, Nairo Quintana, 
Vincenzo Nibali, and Thibaut Pinot having opted to solely focus on the world’s 
greatest stage race.

Contador finished the Giro one minute 53 seconds ahead of up-and-coming 
Italian Fabio Aru, who took every opportunity with a strong Astana team to 
attack the Spaniard.

A 59.4-km flat time trial, however eventually cost him dearly and Contador 
hung on for dear life in the final mountain stage on Saturday after both 
riders, and Astana’s Mikel Landa - third overall 3min 5sec off the pace – 
traded attacks throughout.

Sunday’s stage was a mere parade for Contador, whose outspoken team owner and 
manager Oleg Tinkov unveiled pink-dyed hair.

Contador often found himself isolated against Astana in the mountain stages 
but the Spaniard lived up to his reputation as being a tough nut to crack, 
notably when he countered Aru in the 16th stage after being attacked by Astana 
as he suffered a mechanical before the climb up to the punishing Mortirolo.

Landa prevailed on that day but it signalled the end of Aru’s ambition of 
overall victory.

Contador now heads to a rest period before taking part in the Route du Sud 
from 18-21 June and the Tour de France, which starts from Utrecht, Netherlands, 
on 4 July.
