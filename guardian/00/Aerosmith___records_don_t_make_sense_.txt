Aerosmith <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aerosmith> see "almost no reason" 
to ever make another album. The band's drummer has revealed that the group have 
given up plans for a follow-up to 2012's Music from Another Dimension, claiming 
that there's not enough money for records to "make sense".


"It would be great to make another record, but it's almost, why bother?" Joey 
Kramer toldUltimate Classic Rock magazine 
<http://ultimateclassicrock.com/joey-kramer-interview-2014/>. "Records don't 
sell, and they don't do anything … There's almost no reason to do it, you know, 
judging from the last one and how it went over."


Music from Another Dimension 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/01/aerosmith-another-dimension-review>
 was the lowest-selling album of Aerosmith's career, peaking at No 5 in the US 
and No 14 in the UK. But Kramer says it's "a really good record" that's 
"[still] going to be played 20 years from now". "Certain things held it back," 
he said, suggesting the poor state of the music industry affected the success 
of the album.


"We used to make a lot of money on records," Kramer explained. "Now all of our 
money is made on touring." And although "artistically, it would be fun to make 
another record", "to what avail?" he asked. "Music now is so disposable … We're 
not the Justin Biebers and the Nicki Minajs of the world, so unfortunately, 
records don't make sense."


Aerosmith are among the bestselling bands of all time.
