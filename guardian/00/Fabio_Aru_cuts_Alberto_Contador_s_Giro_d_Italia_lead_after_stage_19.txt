Italian Fabio Aru attacked in the final climb to win the 19th stage of the 
Giro d’Italia to reclaim second spot overall form his Astana team mate Mikel 
Landa on Friday.

Aru, one of the pre-race favourites, slumped to third overall after cracking 
in a gruelling mountain stage on Tuesday, leaving Spaniard Landa to move up 
behind dominant leaderAlberto Contador

But on Friday, the 24-year-old Aru jumped away from a group of favourites and 
Contador, sitting on a comfortable cushion two days before the finish in Milan, 
did not react.

Aru did not look back and beat Canadian Ryder Hesjedal (Cannondale-Garmin) and 
Colombian Rigoberto Uran (Etixx-Quick Step), who were second and third 
respectively, 28 seconds and one minute 10 off the pace.

Contador, who finished alongside Landa 1:18 behind, leads Aru by 4:37 and his 
compatriot by 5:15 ahead of Saturday’s last punishing mountain stage.

Contador is aiming for a first Giro/Tour de France double since the late Marco 
Pantani of Italy in 1998.
