Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> has said 
Sunday’s Singapore Grand Prix will be “very emotional” if he manages to equal 
the 41 victories achieved by Ayrton Senna.

The great Brazilian has been Hamilton’s idol since childhood and this weekend 
the Briton has the chance to match the record in his 161st start – the same 
number that Senna had when he was killed at Imola in 1994. If Hamilton wins on 
Sunday he will trail only Michael Schumacher (91) and Alain Prost (51) in terms 
of most race victories.

He said here on Thursday: “I always wanted to emulate Ayrton Senna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ayrton-senna> and I am very close to the 
races he did, just one race away, and one from the races he won.

“But I don’t feel under any particular pressure this weekend. I would imagine 
if I was to achieve the same amount at some stage, even this weekend, it would 
be very emotional.”

Hamilton has been utterly dominant this season, with 11 poles out of 12 and 
seven victories. He leads his only rival for the world championship, Nico 
Rosberg, by 53 points with seven races remainingafter winning the Italian Grand 
Prix

 while his Mercedes team-mate failed to finish.

Hamilton added: “I am focused on trying to do the same job as the last race 
but it is a milestone that I am approaching in my career.”
