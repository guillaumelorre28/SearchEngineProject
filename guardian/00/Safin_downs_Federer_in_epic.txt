Fourth seed Marat Safin brought a crashing end to Roger Federer's 26-match 
unbeaten run by downing the defending champion in an epic Australian Open 
semi-final today.

Safin survived match point in a fourth set tie-breaker to come back and clinch 
the match 5-7, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6, 9-7, after four hours 38 minutes, thereby 
exacting his revenge for his humiliating straight-sets defeat to Federer in 
last year's final. The Russian will now meet either Andy Roddick or local 
favourite Lleyton Hewitt in Sunday's title decider.

Federer, who picked up three grand slam titles last year, had cruised to the 
last four of the tournament and looked likely to progress to the final as he 
surged into a two sets to one lead and held matchpoint in the fourth-set 
tie-breaker.

Safin, however, recovered to win that set before breaking in the fifth set 
when the Swiss double-faulted at 3-2 to concede a crucial break of serve. 
However Federer, who several times in the match sought treatment for a sore 
back, then showed his determination to cling on to his crown by saving two 
match points at 3-5 down and breaking back.

Federer wasn't finished there either: he survived three further matches point 
at 5-6 and 6-7, and rescued another two games later, until a simple forehand 
brought Safin a brilliant and ultimately deserved victory.
