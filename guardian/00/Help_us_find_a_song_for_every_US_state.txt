Recent efforts to make Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers' song Roadrunner 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZUSF0Zd_Yw> the official state song of 
Massachusetts – a movement inspired byan article by the Guardian's Laura Barton 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/feb/24/laura-barton-article-massachusetts-roadrunner>
 – made us wonder which other US states have rock numbers to their name.

If we're to believe Wikipedia 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_songs>, while every one of the 
50 states has an official song, only a tiny handful have named an official rock 
song as well – Ohio hasHang On Sloopy 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvJ4FhjgTl4> by the McCoys, Oklahoma named The 
Flaming Lips'Do You Realize?? <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk76rsV71S0> its 
official track in 2009, and Washington has an unofficial rock song in the shape 
ofLouie Louie <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-2CKsaq5r8> by Richard Berry.

Assuming Massachusetts picks either Roadrunner or the other song under 
consideration, Aerosmith'sDream On 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/feb/27/roadrunner-massachusetts-dream-on-aerosmith>
, that'll leave another 47 states in serious need of some officially sanctioned 
rock action. Can you help?

What would be the ideal rock song for Alaska, California, New York, New 
Jersey, Wyoming …? Help us put together a musical map of the US. Leave your 
suggestions in the thread below.
