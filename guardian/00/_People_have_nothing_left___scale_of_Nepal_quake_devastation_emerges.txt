Helicopters have been crisscrossing the skies above the mountains of Gorkha 
district inNepal <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nepal>, ferrying the 
injured to clinics, and taking emergency supplies back to remote villages near 
the epicentre of the weekend earthquake that has killed more than 4,400 people 
across the region.

Around noon on Tuesday, two helicopters brought in eight women from Ranachour 
village, two of them clutching babies to their breast, and a third heavily 
pregnant.

“There are many more injured people in my village,” said Sangita Shrestha, who 
was pregnant and visibly downcast as she got off the helicopter. She was 
quickly surrounded by Nepalese soldiers and policemen and ushered into a 
waiting van to be taken to a hospital.

The little town of Gorkha, the district’s administrative and trading centre, 
is being used as a staging post to get rescuers and supplies to those remote 
communities after Saturday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake. Some villages were 
reachable only by air after landslides blocked mountain roads.

Some women who came off the helicopters were grimacing and crying in pain and 
unable to walk or speak, in agony three days after being injured in the 
disaster.

Sita Karki winced when soldiers lifted her. Her broken and swollen legs had 
been tied together with crude wisps of hay twisted into a makeshift splint. 
“When the earthquake hit, a wall fell on me and knocked me down,” she said. “My 
legs are broken.”

After an hour of dark clouds gathering and threatening rain, the wind kicked 
up in Gorkha and sheets of rain began to pour down.

Geoff Pinnock, of the UN’s World Food Programme, was leading a convoy of 
lorries north toward the worst-affected areas when the rain began to pound, 
leaving them stuck.


“This rain has caused a landslide that has blocked my trucks,” he said. “I can 
maybe get one truck through and take a risk driving on the dirt, but I think 
we’ll have to hold the materials back to try to get them out tomorrow by 
helicopter.”

Aid workers who had reached the edges of the epicentre described entire 
villages reduced to rubble.

“In some villages, about 90% of the houses have collapsed. They’re just 
flattened,” said Rebecca McAteer, an American physician who rushed to the quake 
zone from the distant Nepal hospital where she works.

And yet, the timing of the earthquake near midday, when most rural people were 
working in the fields, meant most villagers were spared of injuries when 
buildings collapsed, she said. So far, police say they have 373 confirmed 
deaths in the Gorkha district.

Most of those injured, she added, were young people and the elderly, since 
most young men long ago left their villages in search of better-paying work. 
“The immediate need is getting support to where it’s needed, but there will be 
a lot of work rebuilding,” said McAteer, who was heading back soon to the 
centre of the quake zone.

Thomas Meier, an engineer with the International Nepal Fellowship who 
accompanied McAteer to the devastated villages, said the disaster’s aftermath 
would stretch long into the future: “This is a long-term emergency. This will 
need major attention for the next five years. People have nothing left.”
Gorkha district, Nepal

Across central Nepal, including in Kathmandu, the capital, hundreds of 
thousands of people are still living in the open without clean water or 
sanitation. It rained heavily in the city on Tuesday, forcing people to find 
shelter wherever they could.

At Kathmandu airport, flights arrived with emergency aid and helicopters 
brought in both foreign trekkers and local villagers from quake-struck areas. 
Helicopters chartered by trekking companies reached the Langtang area, about 40 
miles north of Kathmandu and a popular area for trekking – a key contributor to 
the country’s economy.

Dave Gordon, a trekker from San Francisco, in the US, said he was in the area 
until Tuesday waiting for the rescue flight.

“Cliffs came down, four or five porters were deceased, buried in the 
rockfall,” he said of the quake. “Trails are completely destroyed. People are 
stuck. They can’t get out. It was very bad.”

The United Nations said it was releasing $15m (£10m) from its central 
emergency response fund for quake victims. The funds would allow international 
humanitarian groups to scale up operations and provide shelter, water, medical 
supplies and logistical services, UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters on 
Monday.

Trucks carrying food were on their way to affected districts outside the 
hard-hit and densely-populated Kathmandu valley, and distribution of the food 
was expected to start on Tuesday.

Nepal earthquake: how to donate

Citing government figures, Haq said an estimated 8 million people had been 
affected in 39 of Nepal’s districts, and more than 1.4 million need food 
assistance, including 750,000 who live near the epicentre in poor-quality 
housing.

The UN humanitarian country team for Nepal is co-ordinating international 
relief efforts with the government and a clearer picture of needs should emerge 
within the next 48 hours, he said. The immediate priority was search and 
rescue, and removing debris to find survivors still trapped, he said.

Many of the ornate, historic buildings in Bhaktapur, a tourist site just east 
of Kathmandu, were reduced to rubble. Residents began returning to collect 
whatever belongings they could.

The number dead in Nepal has risen to 4,355, said the deputy inspector general 
of police, Komal Singh Bam. Another 61 were killed in neighbouring India, and 
China’s official Xinhua news agency reported 25 dead in Tibet. At least 18 of 
the dead were killed at Mount Everest as the earthquake unleashed an avalanche 
that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing for 
summit attempts.

Some 8,063 people have been injured, Bam said. Tens of thousands are believed 
to be homeless.

Rescue workers and medical teams from at least a dozen countries were helping 
police and troops in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, said Maj Gen Binod 
Basnyat, a Nepal army spokesman. Contributions came from countries such as 
India and China, but also from Nepal’s tiny Himalayan neighbour of Bhutan, 
which dispatched a medical team.

Medical and rescue teams from Russia, Japan, France, Switzerland and Singapore 
were expected in Kathmandu over the coming days, the Nepal army said.
