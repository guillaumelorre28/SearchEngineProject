The South Australian towns of Virginia and Port Wakefield have been threatened 
with flooding after the Gawler and Wakefield rivers burst their banks.

Floodwaters could breach a rail line and flood Virginia on the northern 
outskirts ofAdelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide>, 
authorities warned on Saturday night.
The State Emergency Service issued an emergency warning to residents at 
6.30pm, telling them to enact their flood plans. A flood levee protecting the 
small town failed earlier on Saturday when the Gawler river broke its banks.

‚ÄúFloodwater is flowing along the eastern side of the railway line and there is 
a risk the water will breach the railway line and flood the Virginia township,‚Äù 
an SES spokeswoman said.

The Wakefield river 70km further north also broke its banks on Saturday 
morning, the breach coming at Balaclava Road and threatening the town of Port 
Wakefield.


Emergency services have begun sandbagging the town, parts of which have become 
cut off by the closure of Port Wakefield Road. The town‚Äôs 500 residents have 
been told to enact their emergency flood plans as floodwaters continue to rise.

In Western Australia, more than 9000 properties were without power on Saturday 
night as wild weather continued to lash the state. Some 24,000 customers lost 
power on Saturday after a front started to move across WA overnight.

A severe weather warning remains in place for the Great Southern, southwest of 
a line from Albany to Ravensthorpe to Israelite Bay, including Esperance and 
surrounding areas.

In South Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia>
, the warning for Port Wakefield was downgraded late on Saturday as floodwaters 
stabilised, but residents were warned a small increase in water levels was 
expected during the night.
Road closures and diversions remained in place.

‚ÄúThere are people who are actually trapped in their houses and that at the

An extra 60,000 sandbags were expected to be flown into South Australia and 
would be distributed across the state for collection. Around 100 members of the 
ADF are helping with the ongoing sandbagging efforts.
State premier Jay Weatherilll said about 20 structures around the town of 
Balaclava had been affected, but authorities were not sure if they were houses. 
Homes had been flooded at Old Noarlunga as well.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for us to get into these communities at the moment and we are still 
getting patchy information,‚Äù Weatherill said, also thanking emergency services 
workers who were set to be relieved by interstate colleagues over the coming 
days.

‚ÄúExtraordinary effort ... the care, the professionalism, the capability and 
the energy they have shown has been nothing short of extraordinary,‚Äù he said on 
Saturday.

SES chief officer Chris Beattie told Sky News on Saturday afternoon that there 
was a ‚Äúhigh level of operational tempo‚Äù around the Gawler and Wakefield rivers, 
with the Wakefield in particular continuing to rise and Port Wakefield 
remaining cut off.

‚ÄúBut we have crew on the ground working closely with the community to ensure 
people are as prepared as they can be,‚Äù he said, adding that he was confident 
sandbagging would protect the town.

Beattie said emergency services had to pull 12 cars out of floodwaters in the 
past 24 hours.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly frustrating for emergency service workers when people 
continue to put themselves and their passengers at risk by driving into flooded 
culverts or roadways,‚Äù he said.

Adelaide suburbs affected by flooding on Saturday include Hillier, Angle Vale, 
Penfield Gardens, Two Wells, Lewiston, Virginia, Port Gawler and Buckland Park.

The Gawler river peaked at 10pm on Friday night but the historic town was 
spared major damage. Australian defence force personnel joined emergency 
services in sandbagging properties and shoring up flood defences.

They‚Äôre now focusing their efforts on protecting properties at Virginia.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very low-lying floodplain and there is a significant amount of water 
coming down the Gawler River and so there is every likelihood that there will 
be properties inundated,‚Äù Beattietold the ABC earlier on Saturday

‚ÄúIf you live or work in these areas, put your Emergency Flood Plan into 
action,‚Äù the South Australia SES said.

‚ÄúPrepare your family and home for flooding in your area. Move items of value 
to a safe place. If your plan is to leave, if you require time to leave or if 
you are not prepared, you should consider leaving now.

‚ÄúIt is very important that residents of these areas remain vigilant for 
flooding. You are urged to closely monitor local conditions and listen to ABC 
radio for updates.‚Äù

The SES said residents who had not prepared for flooding should leave if it 
was safe to do so.

Traffic was diverted around Port Wakefield and between Virginia and Two Wells.

The SES also reminded residents not to walk, ride or drive through floodwater, 
or allow children to play in or near floodwater.

They admonished media who ignored the warning.
