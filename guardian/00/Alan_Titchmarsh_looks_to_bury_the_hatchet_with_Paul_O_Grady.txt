Alan Titchmarsh claims he has no problem with Paul O'Grady 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/paul-o-grady> after the presenter 
said that Alan's show pinched its format from his. The Sun reports Titchmarsh 
as saying: "I don't bear him any animosity, but I don't know why he got so hot 
under the collar about it. If you can't say anything nice about someone, don't 
say anything at all." Titchmarsh is working on a new ITV show, Best British 
Gardens, which Monkey assumes won't be nicking anything from O'Grady's show.
