’s voice.

Last week, the producer suggested that the singer’s vocals might have been 
digitally enhanced.

“You turn the radio on and it’s fluff, you are listening to 90% computerised 
voices,” Visconti toldThe Daily Star

 on 8 June. “We know Adele has a great voice but it’s even questionable if that 
is actually her voice or how much has been manipulated. We don’t know.”

 – who is currently promoting the new TV talent show Guitar Star, in which he 
hopes to find “virtuosos like Hendrix, Cobain and Bowie” – has since told
Billboard 
<http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7401285/producer-tony-visconti-apologizes-to-adele-exclusive>
 that his comments were not meant to be spiteful.

“I’m sorry that what I said in regards to what’s being played on radio was 
misconstrued yet I cannot apologise for something taken the wrong way,” he 
said. “IfAdele <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele> has taken my comments 
as offensive that was certainly not my intent.”

He added: “Adele has a great voice and it brings pleasure to millions.”

Since his original comment, the story had already reached Adele herself. 
During a gig at Paris’s Accor Hotels Arena, the singer is captured stating: 
“Some dickhead tried to say that my voice was not me on record … Dude, suck my 
dick.”
