When Antonio Conte <https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-conte> 
thought about what to name his daughter, he wanted something beautiful and also 
something that would resonate with him. In the end, there was only one choice. 
He and his wife, Elisabetta, called her Vittoria, which translates from the 
Italian as Victory.

“This name is nice and it’s an important name – above all, in England,” the 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> manager said, with a 
smile. “My wife is Elizabeth, so I have two English queens! It was because I 
knew one day I would arrive here in England to work. I wanted this name for my 
daughter. I like the name and then, I like the word [and its meaning].”

Conte has been obsessed by winning since long before Vittoria came along – she 
is now nine – and he has spoken of how he struggles to sleep on the night 
before a match, such is the sense of anticipation, and how he finds it even 
more difficult the night afterwards if his team have not won.

It is easy to present Conte as a restless soul, one who can never work hard 
enough and for whom victory is the only thing that sates him; which makes it 
all feel worthwhile. The temptation would be to say he ought to be pretty 
content, because his team stand on the brink of equalling the top-division 
record in English football for consecutive wins.

If Chelsea beat Tottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> at White Hart Lane on 
Wednesday night, they will extend their sequence to 14 games, which Arsenal 
managed in 2002. But that run was spread over two seasons – with 13 having come 
at the end of 2001-02 and one more at the beginning of the following campaign.

Conte, though, does not do contentedness; at least, not halfway through a 
season. He is pleased Chelsea have won 13 on the spin to put themselves clear 
at the top and he also made the point that “at the start of the season, no one 
could imagine this”.

But what stuck in the mind from Conte’s briefing with the media was how he saw 
the wins mainly for the points they have provided. “This is a great achievement 
– above all because now, after these 13 wins in a row, we took 39 points,” 
Conte said. And what do points make? Yes. Surprise championship triumphs.

It was equally noticeable that Conte stressed how Liverpool were only five 
points adrift in second place and it was plain he was not about to get carried 
away by the prospect of equalling Arsenal’s winning record or even overhauling 
it for a single top‑flight season.

Conte did attempt to quantify what Chelsea had achieved with their sequence 
and he did so in the context of what is a hugely competitive six-way fight for 
the title. In his final season at Juventus, which was 2013-14, Conte’s team won 
12 successive fixtures in Serie A from late October to late January but, he 
suggested, there were more easy games in that division. Juventus ended up 
winning the championship with a record 102 points.

“In that moment, in the Italian league, there was only Roma to try to fight 
for the title,” Conte said. “Here, there is a different situation because there 
are six teams that are very strong. Last season, all of our rivals were placed 
above us and, also, they spent a lot of money – more than us. For this reason, 
I think it’s more difficult here in England to keep this position.”

Conte’s claim that the other members of the top six had spent more than 
Chelsea last summer did not bear scrutiny. It was only the Manchester clubs 
that did so, in terms of fees and net spend.

However, he was on safer ground when he talked up the factors behind his 
club’s excellent first half to the season, which included his players’ 
willingness to embrace the change of formation to three at the back and the 
bravery of some – notably David Luiz – to play on through the pain of injuries. 
The centre-half, according to Conte, has been “playing in this situation” since 
the win at City on 3 December, when he was the victim of a high, red-card 
tackle by Sergio Agüero.

Conte’s team have also beaten Manchester United

 andTottenham at Stamford Bridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/26/chelsea-tottenham-premier-league-match-report>
 during the run but it sounded as if he considered the visit to White Hart Lane 
as the acid test.

He described Spurs as being “better” and “stronger” than they were last 
season, partly because what is a young team have had more time under Mauricio 
Pochettino.

It was interesting to hear him single out the defensive midfielder Victor 
Wanyama for praise. “This season, there is a very important player for 
Pochettino, who is Wanyama,” Conte said. “I like his quality and quantity – in 
terms of his stamina, work rate and commitment.”

Conte said Pochettino could be “one of the best coaches in the world” and he 
discussed the similarities in their approaches, which took in the desire to 
build from the back with options, prepare in meticulous fashion and be 
clinical. A tantalising showdown beckons. For Conte, as ever, victory will be 
everything.
