Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> unveiled its highly 
anticipated health data monitoring app on Monday, announcing a slate of more 
than 20 medical partners in the US and Europe.


Speaking at Apple's annual conference for developers in San Francisco, the 
senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, introduced 
Health, an app for iPhone and iPad.

It will be powered by Healthkit, a set of tools that will allow developers to 
build bespoke apps around health and wellbeing, from sleep monitoring and 
stress reduction to exercise and blood testing.

"Developers have created a lot of apps for monitoring your health," he said. 
"But up to now the information gathered by those applications lives in silos. 
But now you can with HealthKit. A single place where applications can gather 
the data. And there's an app - Health.

Federighi assured the audience that the privacy of users health information 
would be protected. "We carefully protect your privacy – you can decide what 
you want to share between apps."

Partners include Cambridge University Hospitals NHS in the UK, and Mount 
Sinai, UCLA Health and Stanford Hospitals in the US.
