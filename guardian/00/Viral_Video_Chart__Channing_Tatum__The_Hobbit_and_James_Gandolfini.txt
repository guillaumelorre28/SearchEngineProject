Life can be a beach – especially if you are Channing Tatum. Jimmy Kimmel's new 
music video, <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPOUgobWTT0> (I Wanna) Channing 
All Over Your Tatum, has the actor and his White House Down co-star Jamie Foxx 
singing on the sands. The song also features Tatum's Magic Mike co-star Olivia 
Munn and Precious actress Gabourey Sidibe – plus a cameo role for Miley Cyrus 
who gets trapped under a vending machine.

If that video enters the realms of fantasy, wait until you see our trailer for 
the latest installment of the The Hobbit 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnaojlfdUbs>. Continuing the story begun in An 
Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug stars Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, 
Richard Armitage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lee Pace, Sylvester McCoy, Luke Evans, 
Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly. Peter Jackson's trilogy is set to conclude 
with There and Back Again next year and the three films together act as 
prequels to Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy.

The appetite for sequels continues unabated and we've got sneak previews of 
Anchorman 2 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ-JX-7B3uM> and Kick-Ass 2. 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td921lYSBIA&feature=player_embedded> It took 
two years to make trials riderDanny MacAskill's latest cycling video 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv3xVOs7_No&feature=youtu.be> and it's a gem. 
Meanwhile the world of entertainment is mourning the loss of Sopranos actor 
James Gandolfini and we have avideo tribute 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEyhCZK2jJM>.

To end on a laugh, make your own mind up about Hull health boss Phil Morley 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW3kRj_MCv8> who has divided opinion after 
dressing as Superman to promote fitness at work. Clark Kent, he ain't, but it's 
life-affirming stuff!
