"I got very excited when I came across the Guardian data set of Winter Olympic 
Medals published as an Excel document for me to play with...

Seeing the data released, I thought to myself: "Wouldn't it be cool to have an 
interface where I can explore the history of medals won when I need it"? And 
thus, I took the data provided by the Guardian, and built 
http://winterolympicsmedals.com in a few hours. This interface allows you to 
analyze the medals data by games, country, sport, discipline and medal type - 
and it was dead easy to build."
