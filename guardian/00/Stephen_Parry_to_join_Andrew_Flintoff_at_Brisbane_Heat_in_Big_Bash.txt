 at Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League. Parry, 28, who has made two one-day 
and three Twenty20 international appearances for England this year, will 
replace another left-arm spinner, the former New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori 
in the squad.

Ashley Giles, the Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> 
cricket director and head coach, said: “This is a good move for Stephen who 
will gain valuable experience playing in such a high profile competition.”

Parry will be available for the Heat’s three remaining fixtures as well as the 
knockout stages, should they progress, and is expected to make his debut 
against Sydney Sixers at the Gabba on Sunday. “He’s a good lad and a seasoned 
competitor for Lancashire,” said the Brisbane head coach, Stuart Law. “He’s a 
solid all-round cricketer so we expect him to slot in and play a similar role 
as the one Dan performed for us.”

Meanwhile, New Zealand took control of the second and final Test against Sri 
Lanka as Kane Williamson and BJ Watling compiled a world-record sixth-wicket 
partnership in Wellington. Williamson and Watling put on 384 as New Zealand 
declared on 524 for five, setting Sri Lanka a target of 390 in just under three 
sessions. Williamson was undefeated on 242 off 438 balls, while Watling was 142 
not out from 333 balls. Sri Lanka then reached 45 for one by the close, still 
needing to bat out all three sessions on the final day to avoid defeat.
