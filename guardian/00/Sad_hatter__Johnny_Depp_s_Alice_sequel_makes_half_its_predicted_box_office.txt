Hopes had been high for Alice Through the Looking Glass, the Tim 
Burton-produced follow-up toAlice in Wonderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/alice-in-wonderland-review>, 
which made more than $1bn for Disney in 2010. But a combination of the time lag 
between the films, lukewarm reviews and the negative publicity generated by its 
star being issued witha restraining order against his wife

 on the day of release, appear to have required some expectation adjustment.

Pundits had predicted a take between $60-79m from the US over the Memorial Day 
weekend; $35m now seems realistic, after the film made just $28m from the first 
three days.

That was $1m more than the film took in China, contributing to a $65m foreign 
total, with Russia and Mexico also performing well. The UK take of $3.2m was in 
line with the disappointment across the pond.

“It’s disappointing,” Disney distribution chief Dave Hollis told the Hollywood 
Reporter. “The domestic opening is wildly less than what every tracking service 
had us at. We’re in the tentpole business. More often than not, they turn out 
to be huge successes. We’ll continue to take those big bets. In this instance, 
it didn’t turn out as we hoped.”

Alice’s flattened figures appear to have bolstered business for other films, 
however, with X-Men: Apocalypse adding another $55m towards a $250m global 
total, andThe Angry Birds Movie <http://variety.com/t/the-angry-birds-movie/> 
adding $31m to its $224m global total. Captain America: Civil War is still in 
the top five, and with $1.1bn globally is still 2016’s best-performing release.
