Paul Merton

I was on at midnight and did a show about a policeman giving evidence in 
court, after someone has given him a hallucinogenic drug. It was April 1982 and 
the venue was a bit of a bearpit: the original SohoComedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy> Store in London. I’d been working 
on my four-minute piece for about six weeks. It was full of surreal 
non-sequiturs, as the policeman describes his hallucinations in a 
straightforward, policeman-like manner. My favourite line was: “I then saw 
Constable Parish approaching me, disguised as a fortnight’s holiday in 
Benidorm.”

I’d read about police busteding an LSD factory in Wales and ingesting some of 
the dust. One of them had said: “I was sitting in the pub with Detective 
Inspector Norris when I noticed my pint of beer was getting bigger.” But he 
said it in a matter-of-fact way, like it was: “The Ford Cortina was parked 
outside for 25 minutes.”


I bought a policeman’s helmet from a tourist shop and took along a notebook, 
in which I had written down the whole monologue. Knowing it was all there gave 
me tremendous confidence. I had no performance experience – but I stormed it! 
The audience went wild. I walked all the way home, getting back to my bedsit in 
Streatham at 7am. It was something I’d dreamed about doing since I was four. 
I’d left the civil service in 1980 to do comedy. That routine got me through 
the next 18 months. Every time I had a mediocre gig, I thought back to that 
first night.

It was 10 years ago at the Stand Comedy Club in Glasgow. I arrived an hour 
early and chain-smoked a pack of cigarettes. I’d imagined my fellow comics 
would be genial, welcoming clowns. But I was greeted by silent, swaggering boys 
who didn’t look in my direction. I realised this was kill or be killed. The 
show was sold out, nearly 200 people were waiting to be entertained, and I was 
so nervous I wanted to run for the door. The audience laughed at least once and 
I was sick afterwards. I realised, through the cigarette smoke and vomit, that 
being a standup was the only thing I wanted to be.

 ‘What a cheek’ … Jo Enright in 1992. Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock 
It was August 1991 and I’d just completed a drama degree, so I knew how to 
look unafraid on stage even when I was terrified. The gig was an open spot at 
London’s Comedy Store and, once I’d finished, I stood alone off stage as a guy 
came over. “Your confidence is good,” he said, “but you need to get as much 
stage time as you can, anywhere you can get it.” I was irritated. “Who is this 
guy?” I thought. “One of the bar staff? A tech guy?” I hadn’t asked for 
feedback. I just listened, smiled, thanked him – and, after about five minutes, 
he walked away. “What a cheek,” I thought. “Who does he think he is?” I later 
found out who he was: Eddie Izzard. And he’d been kind enough, in his gentle 
manner, to give me tips.

Al Murray

I’d been doing some sketch comedy at university, mucking about with friends, 
and we decided to go to the Edinburgh festival. We did a sketch about Wilfred 
Owen being called in by his commanding officer and, like a tutorial, being 
told: “Well, this poem’s not good enough! You need to come up with something a 
little better.” As he was coming in, Rupert Brooke was leaving, being told: “I 
want that on my desk the same time next week.” The thing you have when you’re 
20 – or that I had – was that you think: “Well, I’m funny. I can do that.”

 ‘Fell headfirst off the stage’ … Omid Djalili in 1997. Photograph: Piers 
Alladyce/Rex/Shutterstock 
The guy on before me was an “alternative ventriloquist” who drank beer while 
working his puppet’s mouth. He got booze everywhere. “Please will you welcome 
Omar Darjeeling!” said the compere. I pranced on and slipped in all his 
spillage. I picked myself up and clambered to the microphone, which refused to 
budge from the stand. When it finally did, it hit my head with such force a 
three-inch cut appeared across my brow. “Bollocks!” I said. Then I realised I’d 
pulled the mic so hard the cord had disconnected. So I took a step forward to 
pick it up and fell headfirst off the stage. I was helped back up by punters 
(“Brilliant, mate, don’t stop”) but the stage was so high that I had no choice 
but to heave my left leg up and walrus myself back up stomach first. As I 
lifted my leg, my black trousers ripped, revealing my white underwear. Then, as 
I shuffled chest-first on to the stage, my grey shirt soaked up the beer. 
Sweaty and concussed, I waited for the noise to die down and said: “Can I start 
again?”

Andrew Hunter Murray

I’m six and this is The Big One. Got my costume: yellow jumper, brown cords. 
I’m relaxed but edgy. Got my pre-show patter: approach sideways, mumble hello, 
look at my shoes. I have my set: a single joke from The Big Joke Book. I 
eyeball the crowd. Tough-looking group. Load of other six-year-olds. Couple 
could be seven. Half of them aren’t even facing the right way. I look for the 
mic. There’s no mic. Christ. Who booked this? And the acoustics in this play 
area are shocking. OK, off I go. “What did the football manager do when the 
pitch flooded?” The crowd perks up. Silence descends. But nobody bites. This is 
torture. Oh God, I’m Icarus. I’ve flown too high. I dreamed too big. Why didn’t 
I go for the knock-knock stuff? Eventually, a girl called Angharad mumbles: 
“What?” I’ve got them. I drop the punchline: “He brought on the subs.” 
Angharad’s nose wrinkles. “That’s stupid.” she says. I’ve bloody made it.

 ‘I wrote it on the way’ … Romesh Ranganathan at the Comedy Cafe. 
I blagged my way to a gig at the Comedy Cafe in London and didn’t tell any of 
my friends about it. I thought it would be easy and wrote most of my set on the 
way to the venue. I remember doing bits on Batman, gym cafes and 24-hour petrol 
stations. I was supposed to do five minutes, but overran so badly they blinked 
the stage lights on and off. I didn’t know that was why they did it, however, 
and talked about lights for another minute or so. One of the punters came up to 
me after and said that I seemed confident, but he’d spent the whole time 
wondering when I was going to tell a joke.

Lazy Susan

It was open-mic night and no one knew what was happening or why. The crowd in 
Shoreditch, London, had just half-watched a woman dressed as a fox mouth along 
to a voiceover of a children’s story. Enter Lebensmüde, which is what we used 
to call ourselves. It means “tired of life” in German, but the only thing we 
were tired of was having to explain our stupid and pretentious name. We did a 
sketch about a date. Only one joke really landed. The fox lady was very 
complimentary. It was just enough for us to book another gig.

 ‘One laugh – a sarcastic one’ … Mark Thomas in 2004. Photograph: Justin

I remember virtually nothing of the gig except that I got one laugh – a 
solitary sarcastic one. It was at the White Lion pub in Putney, London, on 19 
November 1985. What I do remember were the other acts on the bill: Andy Johnson 
and John Lenahan. John was a frequent compere who would later introduce me by 
saying: “I compered this next guy’s first gig. He was crap then but he’s great 
now!” Andy’s stage name was Cyril the Tortoise and he would impersonate 
tortoises for 20 minutes. Occasionally, he’d stray into being a bee, sporting a 
couple of tea strainers over his eyes.

 ‘I felt like I’d walked on the moon’ … Shappi Khorsandi in 2000. Photograph: 
BBC 
I climbed up the stairs of the Comedy Brewhouse in Islington in a state of 
terror. At the top, some comics stood in a huddle. An exuberant Scot, Brian 
Higgins, was warm and friendly. He showed me a fistful of cash he’d earned that 
night already: “This’ll be you, pet – in a few years.” The idea of making money 
from comedy made me giddy. There was another “open-spot” comic shuffling 
nervously around the door. He was from Bristol, sweet and shy, the tallest man 
I’d ever met. Stephen Merchant was his name. There were about 20 people in the 
audience. The compere called my name. My legs didn’t stop shaking, I did some 
jokes, the audience laughed, and the promoter gave me a fiver I felt like I’d 
walked on the moon.

My first gig was at a pizzeria in a neighbourhood of Boston called Chestnut 
Hill. It was an open mic. A music open mic. I was 16 and I hadrollerbladed to 
the gig. The host was a nice lady with a ukulele who asked what instrument I 
played. I told her I wanted to do standup. She looked at me for a long time 
before asking how much time I’d like to do. I asked: “How long do the musicians 
do?” She said: “Fifteen minutes.” I thought to myself: “Fifteen minutes isn’t 
that long.” It was the longest 15 minutes of my life. Afterwards, as I 
shamefully put my rollerblades on, I heard her say: “Maybe he’ll get better and 
come back.” So I did. Thanks, Ukulele Lady.

 ‘Another tequila?’ … Isy Suttie’s first gig. 
“Another tequila?” chirped the builder. It was October 2002 and I was first up 
after the interval in a small pub in Greenwich. The trio of Glaswegian builders 
buying me drinks comprised half the audience. The others: a drunken hipster and 
two German students, one of whom spent the entire first half changing a 
dressing on his leg. On stage, I rattled through my prepared material in less 
than a minute.Then I improvised, talking mostly about my scoliosis, AKA my

 Performance art … Rachel Parris. 
This glamorous Serbian performance artist got chatting to me about her next 
“event” and mentioned she needed a comedian for the bill. I told her I was one. 
I’d wanted to do comedy for ages. She booked me for the opening 20-minute slot 
and paid me in wine on the night. The room was filled with smoke and dusty 
antique furniture. I played my songs on a rickety old miniature piano. There 
were a lot of candles. There was a French artist painting a picture of the 
evening on an easel and an actor doing one-to-one short plays in a cupboard. My 
act went well, people laughed plenty, and so I kept doing it. I don’t know if 
it was the nerves or inhaling the oil paints, but I’ve rarely felt such a high.

Nish Kumar

I played the basement of the student union in November 2005. The room was 
normally used as a nightclub, so it stank of alcopops and sick. It was a sketch 
show we’d been working on for two months. The room was pretty packed, probably 
about 160 people in, including all – both – my friends. I remember a rising 
sense of panic. I honestly think I would have done a runner if I hadn’t been 
attached to my friend. We were playing Siamese twins in the opening song. 
That’s student comedy for you.

Lou Sanders

My first gig was in a London pub which, years later, I was ejected from. I 
suspect for being too much of a legend. I felt the fear all over my body. 
Pre-gig, I couldn’t eat my dinner. I thought that could be an upside of 
gigging: fewer calories. We were all brand new comics and all very scared, but 
much to my own bamboozlement they laughed in all the right places. I thought: 
“Well, this is easy. I should probably quit my day job, take several lovers and 
plan the film rights right now.” They booked me for the following week and, I’m 
delighted to say, I died.

 ‘Booed off in 17 seconds’ … Vir Das. 
I did a 90-minute show for a crowd of 800 people. It was in my final year of 
drama school. I’d written a show called Brown Men Can’t Hump and did it in the 
college theatre. It was like my rebellion against how serious the acting 
programme was. What’s worse than bombing the first time you do comedy? Killing. 
Because you fail to realise that you’re only getting laughs because you’re 
cussing, cracking inside jokes, and horsing around with friends. Then you try 
that stuff at an amateur night and get booed off in 17 seconds – true story! 
But I can happily report that, since then, people who aren’t my friends now 
find me funny.

Lucy Porter

In 1995, I played a comedy night at Alexander’s Jazz Cafe in Chester. It was 
run by a double act called the Comedy Police and if the audience didn’t like 
you, they’d scream: “Wooo-wooo-woooo!” If the siren was loud enough, the boys 
in blue would beat you off the stage with rubber truncheons. I stammered out a 
few one-liners I’d written, and a couple of bits about being short largely 
filched from Ronnie Corbett. The audience laughed rather than woo-wooed. I was 
so giddy with success that I stayed for a few drinks and ended up missing my 
train home. Sleeping rough at Chester station prepared me for the glamour of my 
subsequent showbiz career.

 ‘Quit the day job’ … Ellie Taylor. Photograph: Karla Gowlett 
My first gig was at a little pub in front of around 15 people, at least 13 of 
whom were co-workers I had pressured into coming to watch. Yep, I wasthat 
person in the office. I wore a tartan dress specifically so I could open by 
saying that I looked like a tin of shortbread. Classic biscuit-based 
observational comedy. I rattled through my act in about 90 seconds, with my 
teeth sticking to my lips in fear. I ended by saying something about my home 
town in Essex being very cultured because it had the big three: “New Look, 
Nando’s, Costa.” It got a surprisingly big laugh. I quit my day job a year 
later, much to everyone’s relief.

Seann Walsh

It was at the Marlborough theatre, a small space above a lesbian pub in my 
home town of Brighton. It was a sell-out as one of the acts had brought a 
coachload of family and friends from Bournemouth. I was so nervous, I didn’t 
say a word all day. But my five-minute set went well. I now know that’s because 
I was opening the second half, what we call the baby spot. If I’d been first 
on, I probably would have tanked. The guy from Bournemouth died

 ‘Shame spiral’ … Jen Kirkman in 2010. Photograph: Michael Schwartz/WireImage 
My first gig was in 1997 at a bar in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The show was a 
celebration of absurdist humour. I didn’t have to do anything weird: it was 
just expected that I wouldn’t do anything hacky like tell overly 
punchline-driven jokes about airplane food. Smoking a cigarette takes me six 
minutes – exactly the amount of time I was given. So I lit up and started to 
talk. I told a story off of the top of my head about how it felt to graduate 
high school without having lost my virginity and the shame spiral going on in 
my head during the graduation ceremony. I didn’t quite have punchlines, just 
honest assessments of my feelings. I got laughs and lots of other sounds that 
let me know that the crowd understood me, sympathised with me, and fully 
supported my entire being. I naively assumed that this audience represented 
every single person in America. Thank God this is about my first time, not my 
worst time. I’m still not ready to talk about that.

 ‘My mother was disgusted’ … Jason Byrne in 2006. Photograph: David 
Rose/Rex/Shutterstock 
It was at the Coach House in Dublin, I was asked to MC a gig for two local 
nurses going to Romania. I didn’t even want to do the gig. When someone tells 
you you’re funny in the pub, it doesn’t mean you’re going to be funny on stage. 
It’s a craft, for God’s sake. So I arrive in flared, pin-striped trousers, 
braces, with a big badge on my silly shirt screaming: “I am 1.” I looked like 
an idiot and I thought this was what you did. Up I went, MC for the night, 
bands playing, poets, fiddle and squeezebox players, all great at their craft. 
My mother in the audience, priest, nuns, all the neighbours. I’d seen Billy 
Connolly do his stage act, so I thought I’d be blue like him. Everything that 
came out of my mouth was so blue: women’s bits, men’s bits, juices etc. My 
mother and co watched with open mouths. They were disgusted. And the two nurses 
didn’t speak to me for the rest of the night.
