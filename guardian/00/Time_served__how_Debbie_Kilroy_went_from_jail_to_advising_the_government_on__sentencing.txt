Debbie Kilroy, whose story is one of the great reversals of fortune in 
Australian legal history 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/queensland-to-stop-locking-up-17-year-olds-in-adult-prisons>
, has broken another mould.

The only convicted drug trafficker to be admitted as a lawyer in this country, 
Kilroy is now almost certainly the only person who advocates abolishing prisons 
to sit on a statutory body guiding governments and courts on criminal 
sentencing.

Her appointment to the Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council 
<http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/11/10/palaszczuk-government-names-members-of-reinstated-sentencing-advisory-council>
 last month was the latest example of defying expectations in a life that, 
according to the government that chose her, meant she “brings a unique set of 
experiences”.

Kilroy was a young mother of two and the wife of a rugby league star when she 
was sentenced to six years in jail in 1989 for selling cannabis to undercover 
police.

The product of a childhood disrupted by abuse and stints in juvenile prisons, 
Kilroy got a degree in social work while behind bars. Building on her prisoner 
advocacy through the Sisters Inside organisation and her award-winning human 
rights work on her release, she stunned many in the legal community by gaining 
court approval to become a solicitor in 2007.

Kilroy is certainly the only sentencing council member who has ever witnessed 
a prison murder. She was sitting beside her friend Debbie Dick when Dick was 
stabbed to death with sharpened barbecue forks in 1990. Kilroy was wounded when 
she tried to intervene to stop the attack.

Invited months later to a mediation session in the prison chapel with the 
killer and her friends, Kilroy and her friends planned to arrive with hidden 
weapons, bent on revenge.

The idea of a “calm conversation in the chapel” – which Kilroy says came 
courtesy of a “do-gooder” organisation that failed to grasp the volatile, 
escalating reality of prison violence – could have proved catastrophic had a 
suspicious guard not scotched the meeting.

We were going there to kill these other women that had just killed our friend 
… This is how volatile it was
Debbie Kilroy 
“Knives had been stolen from the kitchen, knives had been stashed, because 
prisons are violent places and the only way you respond to violence is with 
more violence,” Kilroy says now. “We were going there to kill these other women 
that had just killed our friend a few months ago. This is how volatile it was. 
This is when people don’t understand how prisons operate and they think they 
do. They actually can cause murder or violence, a lot of trauma.”

Dick’s murder shone a light on conditions in the overcrowded women’s section 
of Brisbane’s notorious Boggo Road jail and, in time, prompted a new approach 
by prison authorities. This included setting up prisoner committees that 
engaged the women in the running of the prison, a move driven by the then head 
of corrective services, Keith Hamburger. As the running of the prison became 
less oppressive, and rival factions of inmates bitterly divided by Dick’s death 
remained separated, Kilroy’s impulse for vengeance faded.

It was Hamburger who last month told the royal commission into the protection 
and detention of children in the Northern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/06/royal-commission-told-new-detention-centres-no-solution-to-incarceration-crisis>
 that building new prisons would simply lock in an endless cycle of 
incarceration.

Kilroy is familiar with the dynamic. She reflects that after Boggo Road, which 
was overcrowded with 104 women at the time of the murder, “we built a new 
260-cell prison at Wacol to stop overcrowding and now we’ve got over 700 women 
in prison”.

Kilroy, who was one of Hamburger’s “guinea pigs” as a member of a “street 
kids” prisoners committee, has proposed that corrective services revive the 
idea to cope with present overcrowding.

“It gives women something interesting to do, gives women a say in the running 
of the prison,” she says. “Obviously it’s not about looking after the front 
door, which people freak out about. But have a committee about the food.

“Women are starving and that’s why they’re assaulting each other, because 
they’re fighting over goddamn food. Right now.

“Women who I get bail through our bail program, they’re saying, ‘I’m fucking 
starving, there’s no food.’ You get punched out for your food. They’re even 
back to rations like the old days in Boggo Road.”

Kilroy’s support for the abolition of prisons is well-known to others on the 
sentencing council, including the assistant police commissioner Tracey Linford, 
who heads the intelligence, terrorism and major events command.

Kilroy has argued that the failure of prisons 
<https://griffithreview.com/articles/power-with-sisters-inside/> as a model of 
punishment and rehabilitation is shown by the fact more than half of female 
inmates who are released will return behind bars. She is influenced by 
abolitionists including the US academic and activist Angela Davis, who argues 
that a future beyond prisonslies in a justice system rooted in the idea of 
reparations for wrongdoing rather than retribution

Kilroy does not believe she will see the end of prisons in her lifetime. But 
“the struggle that we’ve got to be in is to look at how we … get people out of 
prison and keep them out of prison”, she says.

“I definitely won’t be on the Sentencing Advisory Council advocating for 
harsher sentences or mandatory sentencing.”

Kilroy says there will be “robust conversations” about sentencing and its 
effects on “the most marginalised and disadvantaged”, particularly Indigenous 
Australians, and the need to break down “racism, misogyny and sexism within the 
legal frameworks”.

advocates

The council, which is called on by the court of appeal and the attorney 
general to advise on sentencing matters 
<http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/Documents/TableOffice/TabledPapers/2016/5516T327.pdf>
, was revived in 2016 after being disbanded by the former Liberal National 
government in a cost-cutting exercise.

Kilroy says the council has a key role in educating the public amid the 
“law-and-order hysteria” conveyed by politicians and media. She says basic 
misunderstandings persist about sentences, such as the seemingly “early” 
release of criminals after time served on remand and the fact that charges 
don’t equate to guilt.

She also notes the deeply dispiriting effect of remarks occasionally out of 
the mouths of judges and youth prison officers to the effect that offenders are 
a lost cause.

“I get overwhelmed with grief at times in court when I’m representing someone 
and a judge or magistrate actually says to a person, ‘There’s no hope for you 
ever, is there?’,” she says. “You can’t say that to a person because there’s 
always hope, there’s always a chance for change.”

Kilroy should know. A child victim of domestic violence, she spent her youth 
in and out of detention and institutional care. She married someone else with a 
troubled background, Joe Kilroy, an Indigenous man who had grown up in an 
orphanage and Queensland’s notorious BoysTown facility. He became a rugby 
league star and she was a young mother who worked behind the bar at football 
clubs.

Kilroy recalls the racism that stood in the way of “Smokin Joe”, who was 
considered “too black” for signing by a major Sydney club despite being named 
the world’s best fullback. Police in the Brisbane city watchhouse had a picture 
of Joe with a carton of “goon” – casked wine – pasted to his lips with a racist 
slogan, in full view of anyone who walked in, Kilroy says.

The couple, who smoked cannabis and sold it to cover the expense, were 
targeted in an undercover police sting. They had come to the attention of 
investigators pursuing Joe’s brother-in-law, who, unbeknown to them, was then a 
major trafficker.

An undercover investigator continued to hit them up for drugs while they were 
on bail (Kilroy for the Ronald Biggs-worthy surety of $150,000).

Kilroy at one point faced a mandatory life sentence, with police accusing her 
of trafficking heroin. “It was insane,” she says. Kilroy fought that charge but 
she and Joe both pleaded guilty to the cannabis charges and went to jail in a 
high-profile fall from grace, with Kilroy framed as “the wicked witch of the 
west”. They remain married.

In jail, looking beyond the shock of her friend’s murder and a crushing stint, 
Kilroy pushed hard for study opportunities. She began a University ofQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> degree in social work, 
recalling the role of misguided social workers in her own youth.

Kilroy was told at her first lecture that “my own life was worth five credit 
points” right away as relevant experience.

Finding that social work “didn’t challenge me intellectually because I was 
taught about things I’d lived through or was living through”, Kilroy pursued a 
law degree. Her admission as a solicitor, the first convicted criminal to be 
accepted by the Queensland supreme court, was a watershed moment.

The judge who admitted Kilroy, the future chief justice and Queensland 
governor Paul De Jersey, also offered congratulations after signing off on her 
appointment to the sentencing council.

De Jersey was among the many – though not all – judges who “actually believe” 
in the role of the justice system in rehabilitation, Kilroy says. Her drive to 
become a lawyer, despite her past, was in part to test that idea.

“That was going to be my next argument to take on with the state and the court 
system: ‘You keep telling us every time you sentence us to prison and still do 
till today, you’re going to prison for rehabilitation.’ Well if I’m not 
rehabilitated at that time with my law degree, stop saying it.”

Her other reason to become a lawyer?

I definitely won’t be on the Sentencing Advisory Council advocating for 
harsher sentences or mandatory sentencing

“Because that’s another arena that fucks us all over,” she says. “You get done 
over by social workers, the professionals or psychs, and you get done over in 
the criminal injustice system because they talk about equality before the law, 
natural justice, all this stuff, and it’s actually not true in practice.”

One of Kilroy’s best friends, now a judge but then a barrister, told her she 
wouldn’t be admitted. “Just another argument,” Kilroy told her, and disclosed 
everything she could possibly track down about her voluminous juvenile and 
serious adult criminal history.

De Jersey’s judgment in Kilroy’s favour, which boiled down to the fact that 
she had overcome her past to become a fit and proper person at that time, is 
still studied in law schools.

Kilroy recalls later appearing before De Jersey to support the admission of a 
law graduate who had worked in community legal centres after doing jail stints 
for armed robbery.

“There I was, a convicted drug trafficker, moving the admission of a convicted 
armed robber: ‘Your honour, we’re here,’” Kilroy says, laughing. “You want to 
talk about rehabilitation? Here we are.” No one opposed.
