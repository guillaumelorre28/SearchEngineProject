They said thanks to their girlfriends, friend and singer. And that seems to be 
it. The awards come to a close with an amazingly gratitous shot of some poor 
woman's breasts, and a last look at best appliance winner Timomatic. Thanks for 
watching it with us. Good night!

Tame Impala play us to the end of on a night that has, let's face it, gone on 
a bit. A good night for Flume and formerly talent show folk, and a bad night 
for Birds of Tokyo, although on the upside for them, their song is now tattooed 
onto my brain. We finish with best album – and its Tame Impala again! What are 
they going to say?

11.29am GMT 

We've had some intriguing suggestions that things haven't run too smoothly 
behind the scenes. There's talk of a malfunctioning lift meaning that the 
artists couldn't get on the stage, various people missing their cues and a crew 
member dislocating a shoulder. We could have done with some of that drama out 
front.

11.22am GMT 

As Mauboy points out, it's more significant still that she's winning this 
award as an Indigenous Australian.

11.19am GMT 

Former talent show contestants have done pretty well tonight. The Arias losing 
their musical snobbery or becoming less discriminating? Discuss.

11.18am GMT 

Best female now. In the course of swotting up on he Arias I got quite keen on 
the work of Abbe May ... not, I suspect, that she has much chance of winning. 
And sure enough, the winner is former Australian Idol contestant Jessica Mauboy 
AKA armpits woman.

11.15am GMT 

It is starting to feel like there aren't enough musicians in Australia to give 
these awards to. Here's Flume up for the fourth time – he's won best male.

11.14am GMT 

Lorde stole the night for my money there. Great song, great look, fantastic 
intensity. Or as a tweeter puts it more succinctly ...

We've now cut to two women playing a record - Drake's Hold On, We're Going 
Home, before Lorde takes to the stage resplendent in black everything 
(including lipstick).

11.05am GMT 

Well that was indeed awkward. They just gave a shout-out to "all the guys who 
do the stuff that isn't creative". That won't do them many favours when their 
next album but one's tanking and they need that extra promo push from the 
record company ...

11.02am GMT 

Tame Impala have won best group! That means that the awkward ones at the back 
have a second chance to shine ...

10.58am GMT 

Guy Sebastian has won best live act. That's a turn-up for the books, I imagine.

Did the presenter just say "hello, sexy human"? What an excellent greeting. 
Meanwhile, Vicky observes "a lot of the men in this show look like they're 
wearing wigs." I leave that thought with you.

10.45am GMT 

No, it's One Direction. And a video message. With Harry not saying anything. 
Boo ...

10.45am GMT 

Samantha Jade has bounced back from her earlier embarrassment and now she's 
presenting the best international artist award. Will Pink win? Melbourne is her 
biggest market per capita and this year she played 18 consecutive nights at the 
Rod Laver Arena, more than John Farnham (yes, that'll be the research again) ...

10.42am GMT 

And it's more acoustica! Vance Joy this time, who is performing his song 
Riptide accompanied only by ukelele. Maybe Alicia swallowed the budget.

10.35am GMT 

This poignant tweet has just reduced me and Vicky to hysterics (it's been a 
long night ... and it's not over yet). It also reminded me that Darren Hayes 
once recited a scene from In Bed With Madonna to me when I interviewed him back 
in the Savage Garden days. He wasn't out at the time – although that may have 
done the job.

extravangant earrings. She's just a girl, and she's on fire. She's also 
acoustic. Not sure this is really delivering the high-octane thrills this show 
could do with.

10.28am GMT 

These infomercials about the making of the various nominated albums are REALLY 
boring.

10.27am GMT 

Not the Stafford Brothers who gave him the award, mind. Awk?

10.26am GMT 

Australian music is killing it and he's proud to be part of it, says Flume. He 
rules off a bunch of his peers, which is nice.

10.26am GMT 

It's best dance act, and what a surprise! It's Flume. But what will he say? 
Who can he thank?

God, the Potbelleez are still at it. Here's a safety note, meanwhile.

bad?

10.20am GMT 

"This is too much for me and my band of idiots" says Kevin Parker from Tame 
Impala. They haven't prepared a speech either. There's always the awkward band 
member hanging at the back when an indie band gets an award isn't there, hoping 
to speak but not quite seizing the moment? And Tame Impala are no different. In 
fact, they've got two.

10.17am GMT 

There's been a mild flap about the urban category, some of the nominees 
complaining that it's an old and slightly embarrassing euphamism "black music". 
Anyway, it's won by Illy, a Melbourne MC who hasn't prepared a speech but seems 
chuffed none the less.

Now it's the Best rock category sponsored by the Hard Rock Cafe - yikes. And 
it's won by Tame Impala, who are up for seven awards.

I Touch Myself but this song, Pleasure and Pain, shows that there were plenty 
of other great songs in the band's arsenal too.

"I keep looking at those video clips and wondering why I was wearing those 
clothes" ... I suspect you might be saying that when you watch the Arias back 
next week, man from Air Supply.

Updated at 9.59am GMT

9.55am GMT 

"A perfect recipe of comfort for the broken hearted and lovers of love" – 
that's Air Supply, according to the extraordinary voiceover.

9.54am GMT 

There's some very strange perspective at work in this Air Supply video clip. 
The guitarist looks about nine foot tall.

9.53am GMT 

It's Air Supply, says the incredibly orange man presenting their award. They 
met as part of the Melbourne chorus for Jesus Christ Superstar ... so something 
else we can blame Andrew Lloyd Webber for. (I jest of course.) I have to say 
that my knowledge of their music begins and ends with All Out of Love – what 
are their other big tunes?

9.51am GMT 

It's the Aria Hall of Fame! Two men with a common dream, which they took to 
the world, sailing uncharted waters, taking it all the way to the top. But who 
can it be?

We are played out to the ads with a man leaping around dressed as a kangaroo 
to the unpleasant strains of Hello by the Stafford Brothers, feat. Lil Wayne & 
Christina Milian a number which inevitably rhymes "ass" with "grass". Does 
anyone remember when Lil Wayne actually used to be good?

9.44am GMT 

It was worth Samatha Jade doing that slightly embarrassing performance 
outdoors by the red carpet because she's just won best video!

Now there's a thrilling discussion about band T-shirts with Birds in Tokyo. If 
you're wearing one, we are told, take a selfie, hashtag that baby and upload it 
to social media!

9.39am GMT 

Cody Simpson is a clean-cut young man isn't he? He's presenting best video.

9.38am GMT 

As an Aussie hip hop novice, I'm assuming that this is a kind of megamix of 
their greatest hits rather than one song with a lot of very diverse parts ... 
but I could be wrong.

9.36am GMT 

Is this very long piece of video about Guy Sebastian an ad or part of the 
Arias? Anyway, it's time for Bliss N Eso, and a lot of violinists. Bliss is 
beatboxing up a storm. It's enjoyably raw-edged after Tokyo Patrol and armpit 
lady.

In the course of researching this blog (yes, there was some) I very much

"I have such an objection to these dresses without armpits" says Vicky, my 
companion on the couch. One of said dresses is being worn as we speak by 
Jessica Mauboy. It's creating a much bigger impression than the uber-generic 
song she's singing.

9.23am GMT 

Best indie release now, and my money's on the Drones ... except that Nick 
Cave's just won, accepted via video link. "Sorry we can't be there," says Nick

That was Alison Wonderland <http://www.alisonwonderland.com.au/aw/> DJing, 
former cellist with the Sydey youth orchestra (really!). I just thought that 
her set was a bit lacking in spectacle when we cut to an ad break.

9.15am GMT 

I can't believe how long these pop stars are rambling on. We need an orchestra 
to strike up after 90 second like the Oscars, or failing that someone coming on 
with a big net.

9.14am GMT 

Guy Sebastian has won. He's been nominated five times this year, and 
apparently 22 in total. The crowd are going beserk, perhaps because former 
talent show alumni like him don't really tend to win industry awards like this 
- as he's just said in his speech.

9.12am GMT 

It's my musical hero Rodney Jerkins, producer of such incredible records as 
It's Not Right, But It's Okay. I've even been to Darkchild studios in Atlantic 
City just before Jacko worked there. He's presenting the best pop act award.

Flume wins the breakthrough award, the first of a few tonight I would wager. 
He's wearing a nice suit - Dior Homme, so my spies on the black (or red?) 
carpet tell me. The award is given to Flume by Tom and Alex in a giant album 
cover (is it?).

9.08am GMT 

Expect to hear this song being covered by an awful lot of people on the X

It's Birds of Tokyo starting the show or "the Aussie Snow Patrol" as I read

clean shaven than he did bearded.

On the black carpet

I'm now watching the Go! channel – a first time for me. Various pop stars are 
being interrogated about what they're wearing. The Rubens are wearing Jack 
London (me neither, but he got a good plug) whereas Lorde has favoured an 
Aussie designer. Tame Impala seem to have come in their own clothes. The 
drummer looks like he's about to cry.

Welcome to our Arias live blog!

It's the evening that Australian music gets together, puts a nice suit on, 
pats itself on the back and no doubt gets horribly drunk. How seriously the 
Aria awards are taken depends on who you ask –to some, it's the cheesiest night 
of the calendar 
<http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/aria-awards-hall-of-shame-the-worst-bits-of-the-awards-ceremonies/story-e6frfn09-1226771195875>
 – but there's no doubt that Australian music has had a good year, and that's 
got to be worth celebrating.

It's the first time that there have been 13 homegrown No 1s in a calendar 
year, while rock, pop and (particularly) electronic music are all booming. The 
latter in particularly will get a good showing tonight in the shape ofFlume, 
the 22-year-old dance wunderkind 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/21/flume-i-prefer-to-be-mainstream-because-more-people-will-hear-it>
 who has beennominated for eight awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/15/flume-aka-harley-streten-dominates-aria-award-nominations>
, and seems poised to sweep the board.

The awards are happening as we speak, but we've decided to avoid spoilers and 
blog them as they go out and TV. That way, hopefully you, the reader, can share 
your thoughts on the embarrassing speeches, dodgy outfits and attempts to 
create an extravaganza by the performers, who tonight includeVance Joy 
<http://vancejoy.com/>, Tame Impala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/04/tame-impala-lonerism-review>, 
Birds of Tokyo <http://www.birdsoftokyo.com/>, Bliss N Eso 
<http://blissneso.com/> and token non-Aussies Alicia Keys and Lorde. Even 
younger than Flume, the Kiwi is undoubtedlyone of the toasts of 2013 thanks to 
her world-eating hit Royals

(red is clearly not rock'n'roll enough for the Arias)@jennynoise 
<https://twitter.com/jennynoise>. Moral support (and wine) is being provided by 
@vickyfrost <https://twitter.com/vickyfrost>. I'm afraid that if you want the 
wine you'll have to come round to Vicky's kitchen.

The, ahem, black carpet coverage starts on Go! at 7.30 Sydney time. In the 
meantime, let's see what's been happening down at the Star Event theatre in 
Sydney ...

A group of people seem to be showing that they're united by music by, er, 
wearing a T-shirt with 12 armholes and 6 neckholes. Here, they do the Presets.
