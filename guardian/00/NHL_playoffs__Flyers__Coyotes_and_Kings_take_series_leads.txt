We're off to another interesting start in the second round. Here's how things 
are looking as of Tuesday.

EAST

New York Rangers vs Washington Capitals
Series tied 1-1

The biggest knock against this series was that in the early going, it was a 
bit slow. Bruce Arthur from the National Post tweeted that it was "coma 
hockey." The Edmonton Journal classified it as "trench warfare." That's the 
kind of game the Rangers probably want to have every time against a Capitals 
team that has the potential to be high-flying and, should Ovechkin have the 
chance (though he didn't get much chance in Game 1), high-scoring. But against 
a Rangers team that is heavy on defence and has gone all season without 
worrying too much about out-scoring their opponent by more than just what's 
absolutely necessary to win, it might be a tough slog for Ovie. And Backstrom, 
for that matter.

Here's some idea of what Game 1 was like. The Capitals only managed 11 scoring 
chances in the whole affair. The Rangers? Only seven. They made good on three 
of those, while the Caps were only able to bury one. To their credit, though, 
the Capitals were no slouches in the defensive department.Josh Alper at NBC New 
York put it this way 
<http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/Rangers-Capitals-NHL-Playoffs-Game-2-Chris-Kreider-Henrik-Lundqvist-Alexander-Ovechkin-Braden-Holtby-Dan-Girardi-Ryan-McDonagh-Brad-Richards-149472275.html>
 after Game 1:


"The Capitals might be taking a page out of the Rangers' style book, but, like 
almost all facsimiles, they don't have the same strength or power as the 
original. This kind of life comes naturally to the Rangers and maximizes their 
skills while the Capitals are playing this way out of a necessity that leaves 
their most talented players fairly contained."

That might have changed after Game 2. The Caps were just as good as the 
Rangers in may respects, holding them back 2-1 until just minutes into the 
third period, until finally the Rangers notched one on the power play. Then, 
after the Rangers gave up about a billion penalties in the third, finally 
Ovechkin put the Caps ahead with an amazing wrist-shot from near the circle. It 
was only his seventh shot of the game.

One other thing both the Rangers and Capitals have been doing that I'm sure 
has not gone unnoticed, but is worth mentioning anyway, is blocking shots. In 
their series against the Senators, the Rangers were falling to the ice over and 
over again, making life easier for Lundqvist on numerous occasions. Guys like 
captain Ryan Callahan, and defenceman Ryan McDonagh are among the best on the 
team, and some of the more frequent shot-blockers in the league. But the 
Capitals are right in there, too. They blocked just as many shots in Game 1 as 
the Rangers (15).

Main question for the Rangers? Where is Marian Gaborik? Hasn't scored in seven 
games.

Philadelphia Flyers vs. New Jersey Devils
Philadelphia leads series 1-0

I personally wasn't sure what to expect from this one, and was surprised it 
went to OT, when finally Danny Briere put in his second (of the overtime frame 
– we'll get to that in a minute). The Devils only at times during their series 
against the Panthers looked like a club that could rack up a decent number of 
goals in one game without letting a few in. Most of the time, though, they were 
hard-pressed to keep a lead. We all know the Flyers' advantages and 
shortcomings. They can score, but the goaltending can be shaky.

So, it was probably no surprise that all of those aspects of both teams' games 
were apparent this weekend. The Devils got out to an early lead, only to see it 
disappear. The Flyers, as they can do, came back and regained their energy – 
and got the crowd back into it. But between the pipes, Ilya Bryzgalov was at 
times a little shaky, and still isn't making it clear to anyone that he'll be 
any good in the clutch. Basically, the Flyers are going to have to keep scoring.

Speaking of which, Briere's overtime goals. He scored his first one not long 
into the extra frame. It was called back very quickly, as it was clear he was 
making a kicking motion at the puck, sending it in behind Martin Brodeur (who, 
it must be said, looked much more like vintage Brodeur than he did against the 
Panthers). At the time, Briere was a fair distance from the net, so it's 
probably fair to say Briere was not intending for that to go as far as it did, 
let alone past Brodeur, who couldn't get his stick down against the ice quickly 
enough. Still, the motion was there, so it was the right call. But no matter. 
Not long after that, Briere did it the old fashioned way,sniping one in from 
just inside the blue line <http://youtu.be/5GE4egIC3nQ>.

The Devils could put up a good fight against the Flyers, should their gameplay 
continue was it was in Game 1. Worth keeping an eye on.

WEST

St Louis Blues vs. LA Kings
LA leads series 2-0

The Kings are a tough team, and proved it yet again Saturday with a 3-1 win on 
the road in a windy St. Louis. Jonathan Quick was, yet again, one of the main 
reasons for that, turning away 28 shots and putting the Blues in their place. 
By the way, going into that game, Quick had a 1.59 GAA and a .953 save 
percentage, thanks to his great series against the Canucks. The fact that Quick 
stood out again this weekend against Brian Elliott, arguably the best goalie 
all year, hammers home the fact a bit more. Quick is good, that is.

He did it again Monday. Quick was great. But the rest of his team was as well, 
overall, confounding the Blues at almost every turn. They were quicker, more 
physical and capitalized on their chances against Brian Elliott, who looked 
sluggish at the other end.

Because, let's get to the most important thing: What was with all the goals?

It was 4-0 for LA by the end of the first period in St. Louis Monday night, 
and 5-2 by the end. It's not clear at what point the Blues really lost it, but 
it was probably sometime shortly after Anze Kopitar netted a short-handed goal 
just past the half-way point. The two that followed only added to the 
embarrassment. After the fourth goal, just before the period ended, Blues fans 
booed their team. Elliott smashed his stick against his post in frustration. 
Giving up five goals to LA is one thing, given they barely managed that many in 
any game all year. Giving up four in the first period? Trouble. Being 0 for 9 
on the power play? Deeper trouble.

Late in the game, things got a bit chippy and physical as the Blues were 
clearly frustrated. But it brought to mind a question about whether the hit in 
Game 1 against Pietrangelo had a psychological effect on the Blues. That hit – 
from behind, administered by Dwight King – put him awkwardly into the boards, 
which he met mostly with his chin. King only got a minor for his troubles.
Here's the hit <http://youtu.be/fsSWSWt_rbU>. Pietrangelo was out Monday.

Care of CBC, we have a quote from Kay Whitmore 
<http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/stanleycup2012/2012/04/status-of-blues-pietrangelo-uncertain-for-game-2.html>
, the league's officiating supervisor for the playoffs. Here's what he said 
about it:

"[The referees] see the whole play unfold and they didn't deem in this 
instance obviously that King drove [Pietrangelo] into the boards. It was a hit, 
he was in a vulnerable position, but they didn't deem it violent enough to call 
a major."

Consistently inconsistent or good call? Did it play a role in the Blues' 
collapse? Thoughts welcome.

Nashville Predators vs. Phoenix Coyotes
Phoenix lead series 2-0

This is crazy. Honestly, even after Phoenix's performance against the 
Blackhawks, I never would have expected them to play so well against Nashville. 
The Blackhawks were arguably not at their best for most of the year, and even 
going into the playoffs, they seemed a bit shaky. So, a few losses against an 
upstart, highly defensive Coyotes team with a hot goalie seemed plausible in 
hindsight. But for the Predators to equally be unable to solve the 'Yotes? 
Hmmm. Interesting.

There are a number of factors playing into this, but arguably one might be the 
difference in time off. The Predators wrapped up their series against Detroit 
rather early, giving them plenty of time to rest, but at the same time, just as 
much time to lose whatever momentum they might have had. Not so for the 
Coyotes, who entered this fresh from an upset win, and with the ability to keep 
goalie Mike Smith in game mode, where he has obviously thrived.

Phoenix scraped away with an overtime victory (what else) in Game 1 against 
the Predators, but looked much more in control in Game 2, and seemed to always 
have an answer to whatever the Preds threw at them, including goals. They ended 
it with a 5-3 win and with a frustrated Nashville team heading back home down 
two games to none. Pekka Rinne, goaltender extraordinaire for the Predators, 
might have met his match, as perhaps has the defensive style of the entire 
team. But there are still home games to be played, so we'll wait to see whether 
this really is the upset it's looking like already.

Extra bonus!

Just in case you thought Vancouver, Chicago or maybe Pittsburgh fans were the 
only ones still complaining about their team's early exit, you'd be wrong. The 
guys at Leafs Beefs are still going over the playoffs that never were in 
Toronto. Even worse? Ottawa made it. [NSFW, so headphones up.]
