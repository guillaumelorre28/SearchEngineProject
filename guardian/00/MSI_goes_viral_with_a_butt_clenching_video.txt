MSI (Micro Star International) is the junior member of Taiwan's big three PC 
brands, but a viral video on YouTube will increase its name recognition, even 
if it doesn't sell too many machines.

The video -- billed as Guy Catches Laptop With His Butt 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiNaadVOQEM> -- sort of demonstrates just how 
thin are the laptops in its X-Series range. (Ireviewed an X-340 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jun/04/technophile-x-slim-x340> in 
Technophile.) But it's also a challenge. MSI is alsoholding a competition 
<http://xslimvideoevent.msi.com/> for people to make their own "crazy" X-Slim 
videos. The prize is an X-Slim laptop plus the chance to Xperience Paradise in 
the form of a free trip to the Great Barrier Reef, and there will be 15 
winners. That could tempt at least a few video experts to have a go.

The video might have been inspired by Guy Catches Glasses With Face 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prfAENSh2k>, but it's funnier than the average 
computer promotion. There's obviously a downside, but it might not be as much 
of a downside in Asia as it is in the pretentious parts of California. And at 
this stage, MSI presumably takes the view that all publicity is good publicity.
