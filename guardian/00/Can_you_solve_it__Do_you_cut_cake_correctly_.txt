Hi guzzlers

To celebrate my birthday this week I thought I’d serve up three cake-based 
puzzles. Ent-icing! No soggy cerebellums please. Ready. Steady. THINK

1.You have a square cake, and four friends. How do you divide the cake into 
five slices of equal size? Each slice must be slice-like, meaning that the 
knife cuts vertically through the cake and the tip of each slice is at the 
centre of the cake. You have no ruler or tape measure, but you can use the 
horizontal grid here.

2. You have a rectangular cake, and two friends. One of your friends (the 
annoying one) just cut herself a rectangular slice, as below. With a single 
cut, show how to divide what’s left into two portions of equal size.

3. You have a circular cake. You sprinkle exactly 100 hundreds and thousands 
on the cake. These aremathematical hundreds and thousands, meaning that each 
one is a single point with no length or width. Show how it is always possible 
to slice the cake into two with a single cut of the knife so that each slice 
has exactly 50 hundreds and thousands on it. You can assume that the surface of 
the cake is perfectly horizontal.

Oh, and if you have any space for an extra mouthful, here’s the puzzle from 
the cover of my new puzzle book reinterpreted as a patisserie window display.

 Which is the odd one out and why? 
I’ll be back at 5pm GMT with the answers.

In the comments, please try to avoid spoilers, and instead discuss the many 
interesting aspects of the mathematics of cake. Or maybe give hints as to how 
to solve question 3, as it is harder than the others.
