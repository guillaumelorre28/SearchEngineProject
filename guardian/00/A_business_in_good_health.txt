"If you are fully qualified, you can do anything and no one interferes with 
your business", says 45-year-old Mary Adhiambo, as she sits behind the counter 
of her business. She sells utensils, cosmetics, clothes and, although they are 
not on display, medicines. For many years, Mary worked as a nurse alongside her 
brother-in-law, who is a doctor, but she never got a qualification, apart from 
a certificate in community help that she received from Kiboso hospital.

It is clear that her passion is medicine, but for the time being the business 
she opened with capital from GS&L keeps her happy. "I still sell medicines, but 
now I hide the pills so when the Drugs Board comes, they see the other 
products. People know about it, so they come here when they are ill. I can do 
injections. I can manage common diseases. The only thing I don't have is a 
degree."

A divorcee and a mother of three, Mary dreams of being able to manage her own 
pharmacy. She hopes that by saving money and taking loans, she will eventually 
obtain a qualification that would allow her to operate in the field she enjoys, 
just like her daughter who is studying journalism. Thanks to the training 
provided by the Women Economic Development programme that Care International 
developed in association with the Cherie Blair Foundation, Mary remains 
optimistic. If getting a degree turns out to be too expensive, she can always 
rely on starting other businesses.
