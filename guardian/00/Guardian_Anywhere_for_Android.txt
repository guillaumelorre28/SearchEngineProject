The Guardian Anywhere is an Android application which helps you get
Guardian content on your mobile, ready for the morning commute. It
pulls in the days stories and all the excellent (and surprisingly
voluminous) photography that gets published, whenever you need it. You
can set it to collect the news in the early hours of the morning, and
ask it to only download using Wi-Fi, if you'd like to save your 3G
connection.

We've also tucked away some other useful features:

 You can save any photo to your phone and use it as a wallpaper, or
send it to a friend;
 You can choose to subscribe to, or avoid, individual sections of the
newspaper; handy if you don't like reading about sport!
 Saved articles let you mark a story or photo as being interesting,
and read it later. I like to do this in the morning on the way to
work: I scan through articles quickly, marking the interesting ones,
then read them later at my leisure;
 You can browse articles by section, author or tag. This makes it
easy to find other articles in the paper relating to the same subject
or by the same author as the one you're reading. You can also
subscribe to tags to keep up-to-date with specific stories;

If you have an Android phone, please do try it out and let us know
what you think by leaving some comments in the marketplace or emailing

"It's an app for Android phones that lets you read The Guardian, anywhere. 
We've imaginatively called it "Guardian Anywhere". Scan [the barcode] with the 
barcode scanner on your Android phone to be taken to the right place in the 
Android Market, click the link if you're reading this with an Android phone, or 
just search the Market for "Guardian"."
