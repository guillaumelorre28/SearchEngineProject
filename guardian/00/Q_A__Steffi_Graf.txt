to make it last.

What keeps you awake at night?
Andre, the kids, my foundation and sometimes the dogs.

How would you like to be remembered?
As a happy, caring mother and wife.

What is the most important lesson life has taught you?
A new day means a new chance to be the person you want to be.

Where would you most like to be right now?
Around the kitchen table with Andre, the kids, their friends, our families. 
It's noisy, fun and carefree, and there's not another place I'd rather be.
