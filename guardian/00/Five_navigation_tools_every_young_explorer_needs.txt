Maps

Learn how to read a map! Maps use special lines called contours, to show you 
where there are mountains, hills and valleys. They can also show rivers, lakes 
and streams, they can even show you things like areas of forest or boggy 
ground. Learning how to read a map will help you to navigate safely and 
accurately.

 Use your watch as a compass! 
A compass

A compass points the way! Did you know that there’s a giant magnetic field in 
the Earth that makes a compass needle spin? It doesn’t matter where you are in 
the world, your compass needle will always point north. When you use a compass 
and a map together, it’s really easy to find out where you are and plan a route.

GPS phones

GPS and phones help with navigation too. Did you know that there are no fewer 
than 24 GPS satellites orbiting the Earth at any one time? Those satellites are 
bombarding the surface of the planet with messages that get picked up and read 
by GPS devices. These gadgets can then tell you, really accurately, where you 
are – anywhere in the world! Your mobile phone can work in a similar way, and 
most mobiles have a mapping app that will work really well… so long as your 
phone has signal...

 Find your way using the stars! 
Nature

Let nature lead the way! You might not realise it, but nature provides us with 
loads of clues to help us navigate, from using the sun and the stars to working 
out which side of a tree has the most moss on it. If you live in the northern 
hemisphere and stand with your back to the sun at mid-day, your shadow will be 
facing due north. From that, you can work out all of the other points of the 
compass. You can use your watch as a compass too, so if you need to know which 
way is north, you don’t have to wait until 12 o’clock to do it. At night you 
can use the stars. You can find the North Star by using two constellations 
called the Little Dipper and the Big Dipper. Once you’ve found the North Star, 
you just draw an imaginary line down on to the horizon to find north, and from 
there you can work out all of the other points of the compass.


Curiosity

The world is an AWESOME place, full of amazing things to see and experience 
and not all of them are a long way from home! Be nosey, be inquisitive, be 
curious and and explore the world, whether its your back garden and the local 
park or mountains and jungles.
