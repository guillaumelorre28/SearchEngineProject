Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> denounced what 
he called the ideologically twisted and planned “genocide” of Armenians by 
Ottoman-era Turks a century ago as he arrived in Yerevan, Armenia, on Friday 
for a symbolic weekend visit to mark the centenary of the massacre.

 In the most carefully watched speech of his three-day trip, Francis ad-libbed 
the politically charged word “genocide” to his prepared text that had 
conspicuously left it out.


And rather than merely repeat what had said last year – that the slaughter was 
“considered the first genocide of the 20th century” – Francis declared it a 
genocide, setting the stage for another Turkish protest after it withdrew its 
ambassador last year and accused the pontiff of spreading lies.

“Sadly that tragedy, that genocide, was the first of the deplorable series of 
catastrophes of the past century, made possible by twisted racial, ideological 
or religious aims that darkened the minds of the tormentors even to the point 
of planning the annihilation of entire peoples,” he said.

“It’s so sad how, in this case and in the other two, the great international 
powers looked the other way,” he added, in apparent reference to the subsequent 
horrors of Nazism and Stalinism.


In the run-up to the visit, the Vatican had refrained from using the term 
“genocide,” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/pope-francis-to-visit-genocide-memorial-in-armenia>
 mindful of Turkish opposition to the political and financial implications of 
the word given Armenian claims for reparations.


But Francis, never one to shy from speaking his mind, added the word at the 
last minute in a speech at the presidential palace to President Serzh Sargsyan 
and Armenian political and religious leaders. They gave him a standing ovation.

“One cannot but believe in the triumph of justice when in 100 years … the 
message of justice is being conveyed to mankind from the heart of the Catholic 
world,” marvelled Sargsyn in his speech to the pope.

Many historians consider the massacres of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians 
genocide. Turkey rejects the term, says the death figure is inflated and that 
people died on both sides as the Ottoman empire collapsed during the first 
world war.


In a largely Orthodox country where Catholics are a minority, Armenians have 
been honoured to welcome a pope who has long championed the Armenian cause from 
his time as an archbishop in Argentina and now as leader of the 1.2 
billion-strong Catholic church. His 2015 declaration that the massacres were 
genocide sealed their affection for him.

“I shook the pope’s hand but didn’t have the time to kiss it,” 42-year-old 
Yerevan resident Nazik Sargsyan said on Friday as Francis arrived. “I’m sure 
God’s blessing has come down on me with that handshake.”


Small groups of residents lined his motorcade route, and a gaggle of 
schoolchildren wearing white T-shirts and yellow neckerchiefs – the colours of 
the Vatican flag – greeted him at the airport with a banner written in Italian 
that read: “Armenia welcomesPope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis>.”

In his initial remarks in the ornate Apostolic church in Etchmiadzin, Francis 
praised Armenia for becoming the first country to declareChristianity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity> the state religion in AD301 
and for keeping alive the “light of faith” even in its darkest times.

With the Apostolic patriarch Karekin II by his side, Francis urged all 
Christians to unite to prevent religion from being exploited and manipulated 
today, a reference to the Islamic extremist attacks on Christians in the Middle 
East.

“It is vitally important that all those who declare their faith in God join 
forces to isolate those who use religion to promote war, oppression and violent 
persecution, exploiting and manipulating the holy name of God,” he said.


The Vatican has long cheered the Armenian cause, holding up the poor country 
of 3 million mostly Orthodox Christians as a bastion of faith and martyrdom in 
a largely Muslim region.

Sargsyan, Karekin and a handful of other officials greeted Francis on the 
tarmac at Yerevan airport in a low-key ceremony. A girls’ choir serenaded and 
the pope, patriarch and president then walked behind a goose-stepping military 
official along a red carpet into the VIP lounge before heading to Echmiadzin, 
the seat of the Oriental Orthodox church where Francis will stay as a guest of 
Karekin.


“Blessed is the hour when the feet of Pope Francis touched our soil!” 
exclaimed local resident Simon Samsonya. “He won the love of the Armenian 
people with his message at St Peter’s Cathedral on the eve of the 100 years 
anniversary of the genocide.”


The pontiff will have another opportunity to pay respects to the victims of 
the slaughter when he visits Armenia’s genocide memorial on Saturday.
