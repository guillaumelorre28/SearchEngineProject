Snapshot: Pround grandparents with Dad at Oxford

The photograph may smack of Oxbridge privilege. It is indeed a snapshot of 
proud parents with an adored son who was taking a degree in history at Keble 
College, Oxford, c1958. But that’s my grandad Pat and my nan Hettie with my dad 
and they had none of the advantages we might infer from the picture.

My grandad was brought up by deaf Irish parents in a tiny Guinness Trust flat 
in London. When the stammer he subsequently developed was deemed too serious, 
he was sent to Gloucester to live with a kindly Catholic family who could hear 
and speak. He lost his stammer and excelled at school until he was a teenager 
and his education was no longer affordable.

After service in the war, he worked as a bus conductor for 37 years, walking 
up and down collecting cash fares and winding the handle on his ticket machine 
until the receipt rolled out.

Nanny had little education and later cleaned houses and worked in a shop where 
she scrubbed floors till they shone. She also pickled vegetables, made jams, 
bottled sloe gin, knitted jumpers, sewed clothes and, at her council house in 
Surrey, cared for two boys who were the light of her life.

I have to really pay attention to those details to fully understand the 
magnitude for Pat and Hettie of what is happening in this photo.

They look quite relaxed but how must they have been feeling as they posed for 
the shot? Were they wondering just how on earth they got to be standing in that 
grand Keble quad? My dad is 80 next year but has never stopped marvelling at 
where in life his grammar school education and some hugely influential sixth 
form teachers took him. Privilege of another sort. His family continue to reap 
the benefits. RIP Nan and Grandad.

Super Trouper by Abba

“Tonight the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me / Shining like the sun”

Our TV stood on a cabinet full of LPs. Almost all of them were classical 
albums – Mozart, Bach, Haydn. Dad turned his nose up at Beethoven as too 
modern. He was mild-mannered, but fiercely opinionated about music.

The exceptions to the classical music rule belonged to Mum. There were two 
Beatles albums and Nana Mouskouri’s Passport, which never got played. Then 
there was Abba’s Greatest Hits Volume 2 – and Super Trouper.

There they are on the album cover, dressed in white and bathed in light like 
angels. What was a Super Trouper anyway? Some sort of space superstar? My 
child’s brain had mixed up Abba’s white outfits and the beam of light with 
spacey things, andI Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8sfrg4bFoc> added to the confusion. I know 
now that a super trouper was a stadium spotlight, but I think my version was 
better.

Mum would put the record on carefully; we’d listen to the crackle, and wait. 
The a capella opening was as precisely enunciated as any choir, but the best 
bit was the chorus. We didn’t sing along or dance; we sat and imagined 
ourselves famous, shining like suns, on tour in space.

Dad might peep round the door and shake his head at us in disgust, but we 
didn’t care. We were Super Troupers. Thanks,Abba

 Crisis pie. 
In a small pan make the white sauce by melting the rest of the butter and 
making a roux with the flour. Slowly add the milk, salt and pepper and whisk 
over the heat until it forms a lump-free sauce. In a large bowl add the sauce 
to the chicken and onion and mushrooms. I usually add the dregs of the frying 
pan into this mix also. Don’t worry about the white sauce turning a slightly 
mushroomy brown colour. Put the mixture into a pie dish and cover with the 
rolled-out puff pastry. Glaze with the beaten egg and bake at 220C for 45 mins 
to an hour.

This pie is made whenever there is a family crisis. It’s quick and easy and 
can be eaten as the main course with spuds for six people or in smaller 
portions as part of a “using up the scraps” buffet laid out on a table with 
salads etc. I make it in times of uncertainty – after a death for example. Or 
if someone in the extended family is seriously ill and I want to bring 
something homemade instead of buying processed food. It can be made while your 
mind is on something else.

Last year, Annie was born at just over 6lb, 11 days early. Our new 
grand-daughter slept like an angel. As the days rolled by she slept and never 
cried, not even for feeds. This was my son’s first child and as grandparents we 
had no recent experience of small babies, but I felt something strange in the 
pit of my stomach. Living a three-hour drive away worried me but I put it down 
to the newness of the situation.

Annie slept longer and the weight dropped off her. After six days she was in 
intensive care. Meningitis was top of the list. My son and daughter-in-law were 
pale and weepy. I felt helpless.

Annie’s frail body was put through rigorous testing over 48 hours. I camped in 
their kitchen and as a change from endless cups of tea I made the crisis pie. 
It came in and out of the fridge endlessly and we all toyed with it. When 
Annie’s tests came back clear and we were told she was responding well to 
antibiotics for an infection, we started to eat.

One year on, we are looking forward to celebrating Annie’s first birthday on 
12 October. She gobbles her food now and is bouncing well towards her toddler 
years. I am glad that some good old-fashioned comfort food helped us all 
through a very difficult family time.
