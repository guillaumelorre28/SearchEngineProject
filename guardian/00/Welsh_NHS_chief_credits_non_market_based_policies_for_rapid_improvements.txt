David Sissling, chief executive of the Welsh NHS <http://www.wales.nhs.uk/>, 
has said the country's integrated health system has allowed rapid improvements 
in its performance on emergency admissions, and that this would not have been 
possible in England's more fragmented and market-orientated health service.

He told a session at the NHS Confederation conference 
<http://conference.nhsconfed.org/Pages/default.aspx> in Manchester that the NHS 
in Wales has cut emergency admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
and diabetes by 16.5% and 14.6% respectively in just one year, with emergency 
readmissions falling even faster, although from relatively high starting points.

"We don't work in a market. We work much more on an integrated basis," 
Sissling said, with seven health boards providing both primary and secondary 
healthcare to their areas. "There is no 'them'."

"We have a Labour administration in Wales that has made a very firm decision 
to move away from the market. That's partly a political stance, partly what's 
right forWales <https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/wales>," he 
added. Welsh health boards receive income based on the number of people in 
their areas, with adjustments based on local health needs.

Sissling said that integration means that primary and secondary healthcare 
staff can co-operate for the good of patients without worrying about the 
financial effect on their organisations. In reducing emergency admissions, the 
Welsh NHS brought together GPs and hospital specialists for discussions on 
patients' pathways through the healthcare system, and this led to the 
establishment of community teams to manage patients before and after hospital. 
"Change can happen in smart, real time," he said.

Sissling said the improvements took place at the same time as a severe 
financial squeeze on the Welsh NHS, which last year saw no growth in its budget 
in cash terms, meaning it shrank in real terms. This provided another 
motivation to cut emergency admissions, which are expensive as well being 
generally worse for patients. The Welsh NHS also reduced Clostridium difficile 
cases by a third in the last year, although Sissling said this was down to 
adopting good practice rather than anything to do with health service 
structures.

He added that the NHS in Wales shares problems with other parts of the UK, 
such as too much hospital capacity. A consultation will take place on this, 
which will be "turbulent, difficult but necessary," Sissling said.
