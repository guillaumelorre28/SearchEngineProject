Iannucci’s follow-up to his hit HBO comedy Veep will centre on the aftermath 
of the Soviet leader’s demise in 1953, which led to a power vacuum and days of 
political infighting. It is based on Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin’s 2011 
graphic novel The Death of Stalin, which was first published in French.

Buscemi will play Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin’s eventual successor, with Tambor 
as Georgy Malenkov, the chairman of the council of ministers in the wake of 
Stalin’s death. Dalton will play Georgy Zhukov, a war hero and former 
confidante of Stalin who was another key figure in the power struggle.

The Death of Stalin will be Iannucci’s second film, following In the Loop
