Abortion Rates in the United States, 1970-2005

"The darker the shade of green, the higher the number of reported abortions 
per 1,000 live births.

New York has the highest rate with a whopping 507, which is a little over a 
third. That I'm not so sure about though. I'm thinking that there might be some 
high numbers in the '70s driving that rate up, but I'd have to look deeper into 
that. Wyoming, on the other hand, only had a reported 14 abortions between 1970 
and 2005."
