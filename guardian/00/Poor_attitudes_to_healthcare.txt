Fifty-year-old tribal villager Gopalan walks slowly in the rain, holding an 
umbrella with his one functioning arm. He drags his left foot behind him as he 
limps, while his left arm dangles by his side.

Gopalan was working as labourer in his local town about a year ago, when he 
felt his left side go numb. Neither Gopalan nor his workmates were aware he was 
having a stroke and he fell from a height he estimates to be about 15 metres 
(50ft).

After the incident he awoke frightened and unable to talk or move his left 
side. He was taken back to his village, deep within the Kerala forest. His 
family consulted an untrained local doctor, who prescribed a course of 
traditional medicine.

As Gopalan's speech and movement partially returned, he and his family 
believed he was getting better. However, a year on, Gopalan's condition is now 
deteriorating.

As a result of not getting treatment for the stroke, he has a large lump on 
his shoulder, where his arm has fallen out of the socket, causing him 
considerable pain. He has continued to work for the past year but now, due to 
his partial paralysis, his productivity levels are much lower, meaning he is 
paid less than half of his previous wage.

He says: "I have to work, I cannot stop, we need money." Lack of medical care, 
at the appropriate time, has had a high price for Gopalan.
