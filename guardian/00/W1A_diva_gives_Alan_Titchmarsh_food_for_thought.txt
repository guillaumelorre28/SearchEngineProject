It's said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and Alan Titchmarsh 
certainly seems to go along with that. TheBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> spoof W1A has a diva-like character, 
based on telly's green-fingered great, who refuses to take part in a show 
because of the low star-rating of the co-host, reports the Daily Telegraph. 
Alan was unaware of the character, but didn't seem to be at all put out by it. 
"It was very funny," he said. "How could anyone pull out of a programme called 
Britain's Tastiest Village? You've got to do it, haven't you? I'm waiting for 
the call." Could this be an insight into how the Beeb comes up with programme 
ideas? Keep an eye on the TV listings, folks.
