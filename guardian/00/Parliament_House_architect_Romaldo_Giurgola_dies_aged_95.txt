Romaldo Giurgola, the architect who designed Canberra’s Parliament House, has 
died aged 95.

Italian-born Giurgola designed new Parliament House at the invitation of the 
federal government in 1980 after his design was selected from 329 entries 
worldwide. The building was opened by the Queen in 1988.

The architect Ann Cleary, a friend of Giurgola for 35 years, said his legacy 
was “up there with all of those who make an imprint on the understanding of who 
we are as a people, as a culture”.

“He’s really a man of humility and he really showed us how to see with a sense 
of perspective,” she told ABC radio on Monday.

She said he fell in love with Canberra

place, deciding to call the city home.

Giurgola was born in Rome in 1920. He studied at the University of Rome and 
Columbia in the US before creating Mitchell/Giurgola Architects, one of the 
world’s leading architectural firms.


In 2003, Giurgola came out of retirement to help bring another landmark, 
Parramatta’s St Patrick’s Cathedral, out of the ashes after the Catholic church 
was razed by an arsonist.

The then 83-year-old said he donated his time as an offering.

He was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Sydney that year, 
along with Jørn Utzon, the architect who designed the Sydney Opera House.
