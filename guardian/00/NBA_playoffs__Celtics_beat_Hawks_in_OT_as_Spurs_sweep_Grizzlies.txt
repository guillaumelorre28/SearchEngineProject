The Spurs finished off their ninth sweep of a postseason series in franchise 
history, their third against the Grizzlies. San Antonio also swept Memphis in 
the 2004 first round and the 2013 Western Conference finals.

The only thing that delayed the Spurs advancing was a power surge that knocked 
out the lights, stopping the game for about 20 minutes in the second quarter.

San Antonio now await the winner of Oklahoma City-Dallas, a best-of-seven 
series that the Thunder lead 3-1.

LaMarcus Aldridge scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the Spurs. Tony 
Parker added 16 points. David West had 11. Lance Stephenson scored 26 points 
off the bench for the Grizzlies. Zach Randolph and Matt Barnes each had 15 
points, and Vince Carter 14.

Elsewhere, Isaiah Thomas scored 28 points, hitting a corner three-pointer with 
30 seconds left in overtime and then adding a pair of clinching free throws as 
theBoston Celtics <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boston-celtics> beat the 
Hawks 104-95 on Sunday night to send their first-round playoff series back to 
Atlanta tied two games apiece.

Paul Millsap scored 45 for the Hawks — a career playoff high and one off his 
all-time best — and added 13 rebounds.

Marcus Smart scored 20 points and Jonas Jerebko had 10 rebounds for Boston. 
Game 5 is Tuesday night in Atlanta.
