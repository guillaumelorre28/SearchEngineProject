 Aka:  Washboard stomach. 
 Age:  62, but you wouldn't want to be kicking sand in his face. 

 Why, tough, is he?  Tough? Tough!? Have you seen the latest statistics from 
the Notting Hill Gate health club?

 No, what with Ireland, the Chechen conflict, Emma Thompson's baby, they seem 
to have passed me by. Well, Andreas, founder of the Independent, president of 
the British Board of Film Censors and all round big brain, likes nothing better 
than pumping iron in his spare time.

 What, rippling pecs, bulging deltoids, rock-like abs?  The lot. Andreas 
(that's Mr Whittam Smith to you) has come top of 1,500 members at his local 
health club for "most weights lifted in one month" and third in the key "most 
hours spent exercising" category.

 Golly, those other censors at the film board won't want to get on the wrong 
side of him. Quite. When Andreas says he's going to give a certificate to A 
Clockwork Orange, he's gonna give a certificate to A Clockwork Orange, got it?

 I hear there's interest in making a film of his exploits.  If this is a cheap 
attempt at getting in a joke about censoring his own breast shots, I'm not 
interested.

 Damn, you saw right through me.  Wasn't difficult. 

 Apart from agreeing to release Stanley Kubrick's film and his gargantuan 
muscles, what else is Andreas well known for? He used to be known as Saint 
Andreas. Not any more. Within three months of taking up his post as chief 
cinema censor he had nodded through the new film of Lolita and also licensed 
Kissed, about necrophilia, on video. Not bad going for the son of an Anglican 
clergyman from Birkenhead.

 Also famous for:  His signature, seen at the beginning of every film showing. 

 Do say:  How are the squat thrusts/ bench presses/leg curls going? 

 Don't say:  Fancy a fight?
