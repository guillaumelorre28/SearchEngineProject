Big bottles of MoÃ«t by the poolside, cars bouncing up and down, women in 
bikinis; the hip-hop video has its fair share of cliches. There is an 
alternative history, though, and one which reaches an apogee with Hype 
Williams's video for Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check. Busta Rhymes's natural, 
playful effervescence is matched by Williams's fish-eye visuals. Essentially 
it's still a man singing and dancing, but the delivery was so innovative it 
influenced music promos of all stripes.
