ACT Labor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/13/uncharted-territory-why-the-act-election-result-cannot-be-predicted>
 has won another four years in power after the Canberra Liberals failed to 
convince Australian Capital Territory voters to change government.

While a final result won’t be known for another week, Labor is in a position 
to form minority government with the support of the Greens.

There is an outside chance Labor could form a majority in the 25-seat 
legislative assembly.

With 76% of the vote counted from Saturday’s election both major parties are 
guaranteed 10 seats and the Greens one. Four seats remain in doubt.

“We’re not going to know the final outcome tonight,” the chief minister, 
Andrew Barr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/act-election-labor-will-rack-up-two-decades-in-power-if-it-wins>
, told the Labor faithful on Saturday night. “What we do know is Canberrans 
have voted for another Labor government.”

The Liberals went backwards on their 2012 performance, recording a 3.8% swing 
against them.

The Labor vote was up slightly – 0.2% – while the Greens held their ground 
with 10.6% of the primary vote.

The Liberal leader, Jeremy Hanson, has all but conceded defeat.

“It is the case that it is very difficult for us to form government and we 
have to acknowledge that from here, it is unlikely that we will do so,” he told 
supporters.

Barr said Canberrans had voted for a positive vision of a city that was 
confident, self-reliant and where everyone had the opportunity to achieve their 
potential.

“Tonight I want to thank the people of Canberra for backing a positive plan 
for our city,” he told theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> faithful.

The Labor leader confirmed he would work with returned Greens MLA Shane 
Rattenbury to form a government.

“There is absolutely no doubt that we will form a government in the coming 
week,” Barr said.

Labor won 39% of the primary vote, with the Liberals on 35.6% and the Greens 
10.6%. Both major parties are on track to win at least 10 seats in the 25 seat 
legislative assembly.

ABC election analyst Antony Green expects the best the Liberals can get is 11 
seats, possibly 12.

The Greens will have at least one seat – in the central electorate of 
Kurrajong – with an outside chance of winning a second.

 Rattenbury, who is likely to retain a ministry in a minority Labor 
government, says the minor party remains in the game.

“We will not know until next Saturday if there are going to be more Greens,” 
he told the party faithful.

But he said Canberra voters clearly rejected the Liberals as a party “looking 
backwards, a party that brought no vision for this city”.

ACT Labor has been in power for 15 years.
