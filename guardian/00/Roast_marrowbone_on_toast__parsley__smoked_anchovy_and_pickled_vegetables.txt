SERVES 4

bone marrow 200g
chopped parsley 40g
anchovy fillet 1, finely diced
shallot 35g, finely diced
Japanese breadcrumbs 50g
lemon finely grated zest of Â½
bread 4 slices
spring onions 8
radishes 8
olive oil 20ml
pickled onion juice 50ml
smoked anchovy fillets 12
mixed leaves
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Carefully dice the bone marrow into 1cm pieces and reserve.

Mix the chopped parsley, diced anchovy, diced shallot, Japanese breadcrumbs 
and lemon zest together and carefully combine with the diced bone marrow.

Lightly toast both sides of the bread and allow to cool standing up, to avoid 
going soggy.

Divide the bone marrow mix between the 4 slices of toast and gently press 
down. Place any crumb mix that is left over in the bowl on top of the bone 
marrow mix.

Trim the spring onions and blanch in boiling water for 1 minute until just 
soft but a slight crunch remains. Cut in half and reserve. Cut the radishes 
into quarters and reserve.

Preheat oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Place the marrow toasts on to a baking tray 
and bake for 4-5 minutes until the marrow is soft and the crumb is golden in 
colour.

In the meantime, combine the olive oil and pickled onion juice and pour over 
the spring onions and radishes. Gently mix and leave to pickle while the marrow 
toast cooks.

Remove the marrow toasts from the oven and place on kitchen paper to drain any 
excess fat, then place in the centre of each plate.

Lay 3 smoked anchovy fillets on top of the marrow mix. Season the vegetables 
with salt and freshly ground black pepper and spoon over and around the toast.

Place the leaves over the toasts and drizzle over the remaining pickle 
dressing.
