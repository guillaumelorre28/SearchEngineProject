An Italian prosecutor has asked the nation’s highest court to definitively 
condemn Amanda Knox and her former boyfriendRaffaele Sollecito 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/raffaele-sollecito> for the murder of 
British university student Meredith Kercher, saying the pair undoubtedly played 
a role in her brutal death in 2007.

“All the characters in this story are part of a perfect reconstruction, like 
in a [Henri] Cartier-Bresson photograph where every detail has its 
corresponding place,” argued Mario Pinelli, the chief prosecutor.

The panel of judges, who will rule on whether to uphold Knox and Sollecito’s 
convictions on Friday, listened attentively as details of the murder were 
rehashed for what could be the last time, from the defendants’ alleged attempt 
to clean up the murder scene and stage a break-in at the home where Knox and 
Kercher were housemates, to Knox’s initial statements to the police, in which 
she falsely accused a black pub owner she worked for of committing the crime.

The long-awaited hearing in Italy’s court of cassation in Rome could seal the 
fate of both Knox and Sollecito in the Italian justice system, following
multiple trials and appeals

.

If their convictions are upheld, Italy will likely seek the extradition of 
Knox from her native Seattle, where she is currently living, back toItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> to serve her 28-and-a-half year jail 
sentence. Sollecito, who will be 31 years old on Thursday, would likely be 
arrested right away if his conviction is upheld. He has been sentenced to 25 
years in prison.

Although observers in the case initially believed a verdict could be announced 
as early as Wednesday evening, the presiding judge in the case, Gennaro 
Marasca, said the hearing would continue at 9am on Friday.

Carlo Dalla Vedova, Knox’s attorney, said he was confident justice would 
prevail, even if his client was less certain. “She’s worried,” he told 
reporters shortly before the hearing began. He said he would be calling her 
with updates.

Both Knox and Sollecito deny any wrongdoing. Sollecito arrived in the high 
court on a rainy morning in Rome with his girlfriend, Greta, and father and 
sister. He looked bored at times – more consumed by a hang-nail than the long 
monologues offered by various attorneys in the case.

One thing that remained unclear on Wednesday was what might have motivated the 
vicious crime. While some accounts have suggested that the murder was the 
result of an alleged spat between Knox and Kercher, and others said that she 
was killed after a sex game had gone wrong, the prosecutor on Wednesday said, 
in effect, the motive was irrelevant. Hypothesising on the issue, Pinelli said, 
was a slippery slope.

Sollecito’s lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, is seeking a formal separation between 
her client’s case and Knox’s case. While Bongiorno said before the hearing 
started that she hoped the case would be annulled because it was “littered with 
errors”, it is extremely unlikely that the Italian court will throw out the 
charges.

The two most likely scenarios are that the panel of judges will either uphold 
both convictions or send one or both cases back for retrial. Dalla Vedova 
shrugged off any suggestion that separating Knox’s case from Sollecito’s could 
isolate and hurt the American’s chances of an eventual acquittal.

In fact, such a move made sense for Sollecito’s team, he said, because there 
was less evidence being held against him than against Knox. “Sollecito is a 
shadow,” he told reporters.

The long-running trial has been criticised in international press as a circus, 
but in Italy, where the case is less closely followed than in the UK and the 
US, it was business as usual.

The trial was originally slated to be conducted in a small hearing room until 
– more than an hour into arguments – the top judge observed that many of the 
attorneys and their staff did not have adequate seating. Even Sollecito had 
trouble finding a seat initially.

The hearing was then moved into a larger venue, where court police kept a 
close eye on journalists trying to use their mobile phones – which is against 
the rules – and issued stern threats that they would be confiscated.

The hearing also attracted some of the people who profess to be supporters of 
the defendants. An American named Michael from Hawaii – he did not want to give 
his last name – and a German woman named Anke Ahlbrink held signs that said 
“Raffaele and Amanda are innocent” in front of the courthouse.

Ahlbrink said she had been attracted to the case because of the witchhunt to 
which Knox, she said, had been subject. “It is like in the Middle Ages,” she 
said.

The pair followed Sollecito into the courthouse and gave him a pastry that was 
wrapped in a bag that had the word “innocent” on it. Michael said it was a 
birthday gift.

Diya “Patrick” Lumumba was also present in the court. He was the owner of a 
pub whom Knox initially accused of the crime in a statement that she later 
retracted. The accusation was false and Lumumba was exonerated after it was 
clear he had an alibi.

Knox has said she would have to be dragged “kicking and screaming” back to 
Italy to complete her prison sentence if her conviction is upheld. The pair 
were believed to have acted in concert with Rudy Hermann Guede, a drifter from 
the Ivory Coast who was found guilty of murder following a fast-track trial. He 
has already served about half of his 16-year sentence in the case.
