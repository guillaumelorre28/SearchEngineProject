Google <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> is a fount of knowledge 
for all would-be UK voters trying to get a grasp on the political landscape 
before next month’s general election. The bad news for Ukip is that the public 
are mostly preoccupied with finding out whether it is racist or not.

Exclusive data provided to the Guardian by Google Trends reveals the commonest 
search terms related to each party in the UK in March. For Farage’s party it 
was “Are Ukip racist?” followed by “Why should I not vote for Ukip?”

On the flip side, people are more interested in the policies of Ukip than any 
other party.

Here’s how the parties rank, when sorted by the number of Google searches for 
their party name, followed by “policies”:

 * Ukip policies 
 * Green party policies 
 * Labour policies 
 * Conservative policies 
 * BNP policies 
 * SNP policies 
 * DUP policies 
 * Lib Dem policies 
 * Sinn Féin policies

 * FUKP policies (Al Murray’s anti-Ukip protest party) 
There are a few striking things about this list: 

First, Ukip and the Greens – often characterised as protest votes – are ahead 
of Labour and theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives>, the two parties most 
likely to lead the next government.

Second, the far-right BNP <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/bnp> – which 
is not really registering at all on national polls – have policies more likely 
to be searched for than the Lib Dems.

Al Murray’s anti-Ukip protest party is in last place – but it is only running 
in South Thanet wherethe comedian is up against the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage

.

Good news for Ed Miliband – interest in the Labour leader spiked way ahead of 
all other party leaders after his appearance on last Thursday’s televised 
interview and Q&A

.

Some of the searches are not particularly election-related (most people are 
only just tuning in to the campaign). For example, the most popular question 
about the Conservatives is why the party is also calledthe Tories 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tories_%28British_political_party%29>? 


The search data also confirms the fervour around Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish 
Nationalists is not confined within Scotland’s borders. One of the top queries 
about the SNP is “Can people live in London and vote SNP?”

The full set of questions reveals how voters are interested in the record of 
the Lib Dems in government, what theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party stands for, and also hints 
at the likely concentration and niche aspect of the Greens’ vote.

Those in the east of England, where Ukip is particularly popular according to 
the polls, want to know what Farage would actually do if the UK left the EU.

Here is the full list:

Top questions relating to the Conservative party in the UK

 * Why are the Conservative party called Tory? 
 * Who is the Conservative party? 
 * How many Tory MPs are there in Scotland? 
 * Who is the leader of the Conservative party?

Other interesting notes: in the north-east of England the top two searches for 
the Conservatives are 1. “How likely is it that the Conservative party will win 
350 seats?” (a majority) and 2. “Who is Grant Shapps?” –a very good question, 
indeed
