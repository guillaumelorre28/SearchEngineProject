Exhale for Melbourne dance


Melbourne City Ballet <http://melbournecityballet.com.au/> presents a two-week 
showcase of new contemporary dance pieces from four top choreographers. Former 
Royal New Zealand ballet dancer Brendan Bradshaw combines early 20th-century 
opera, intricate pas de deux and vintage footage for his piece Caruso, and 
ballet dancer Iona Marques pays tribute to her Brazilian heritage for Ciranda, 
a work inspired by the hypnotic traditional dance. Rising dance stars Michael 
Pappalardo and Yuiko Masukawa reflects the everyday life of contemporary 
society in Grind, while Melbourne City Ballet’s artistic director Michael 
Pappalardo seeks out curious inspiration for Arachnid.
