Individuals afraid of cyber-attacks may soon be able to buy insurance that 
would allow them to clean up the damage caused by hackers.

The insurance company Axa <https://www.theguardian.com/business/axa> is 
already offering such policies in France and is looking at devising a similar 
policy for the UK market.

Nicolas Moreau, a senior executive at the French insurance company, said the 
policy, which is sold as an add-on to house insurance, was intended to clean up 
private images posted online rather than hide information legitimately 
published.

Speaking on the fringes of the Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> meeting of the World Economic 
Forum, where the risk of cyber-attack became a topic of debate, Moreau said: 
“If your reputation has been damaged, or your kids’ reputation, we have people 
to clean up the issue.”

The aim, he said, was not to remove news articles but private information made 
public. He gave the example of images of a teenage girl taken by her boyfriend. 
“We’re not looking at dictators trying to improve their reputations,” he said.

Moreau did not give a timescale for when such insurance might be available in 
the UK and said the company was looking at how best to develop it.

He said cyber-attacks on infrastructure such as stock exchanges, the payments 
system or energy supplies “could be as effective as a bombing of a city”.

Axa, which hires hackers to test its own online security, sells insurance to 
companies to cover any liabilities they face as a result of a cyber-attack.

Moreau was making his first visit to Davos to discuss climate change, a major 
topic for debate among delegates after the former US vice-president Al Gore 
launched his 24-hour concert Live Earth to promote public awareness of climate 
change.
