Andre Agassi <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andre-agassi> admitted he was 
"out of line" and apologised for poking fun at Pete Sampras during a charity 
match on Monday.

Agassi and Sampras were wearing microphones during the match, and the crowd at 
Indian WellsTennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Garden in 
California could hear an exchange that started lighthearted but turned testy.

At one point Sampras mimicked Agassi's pigeon-toed walk, which drew laughs 
from the crowd.

Then Agassi chided Sampras for being stingy. In his book, Agassi criticised 
Sampras for being a poor tipper.

Sampras responded with a high, hard serve that forced Agassi, who was 
partnering Rafael Nadal, to duck. Both Agassi and Sampras were smiling, but 
neither showed up at the post-match news conference.

"It was out of line," Agassi told ESPN.com. "It was inappropriate. We were all 
having fun. I was trying to be comedic. I went for it and it fell flat. 
[Sampras] didn't really roll with it. I've texted Pete to ask him if I can 
apologise in person."

"The joke fell flat and I'm sorry," he added. "My hope was that the night was 
still enjoyable."

Nadal was asked about Sampras and Agassi after his Monday night match. 
"Everybody told me after the match what's happened, but during the match, you 
know how fast Americans speak, and I am Spanish. I didn't understand nothing," 
he said.

A capacity crowd of 16,100 filled the stadium for the Hit for Haiti 
fundraising exhibition. The event helped raise $1m (Â£660,000) to aid relief 
efforts in the earthquake-ravaged island nation.
