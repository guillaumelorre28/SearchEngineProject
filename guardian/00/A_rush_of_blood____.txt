 At last I have found something I have in common with Chris Martin (Martin 
plans to rock the vote for Cameron's Tories, April 1). Just like him, whenever 
I invite the prime minister round to discuss my approach to fair trade, poverty 
in the third world or Iraq, he fails to show up. Who in the world does Chris 
Martin think he is that he can summon the prime minister to account and "give 
him one last chance"?

Olaf Priol reports that David Cameron and Chris Martin's wives were soon 
"meeting to practice Kegel exercises in the Camerons' Notting Hill house". 
Given that Kegel exercises are best known in this country, following Sex in the 
City, as an aid to enhanced sexual performance and enjoyment, are you sure that 
Gwyneth and Samantha would want us to know this? Or are they battling urinary 
incontinence together?

Please tell me that Chris Martin supporting the Tories was a spoof. 
Disillusionment with Labour is bad enough, but to lose respect for Coldplay and 
their music would exacerbate the situation.

I was so angry that I had to delete all the Coldplay albums from my iPod. I 
may have even foamed at the mouth at one point. Well done - you got me.

I spotted your April Fool right away: "Premiership title race open - Sir Alex".

"Blair tells MPs their phones won't be tapped"! Can't you be a little more 
subtle?

Given the growth of eco-tourism in San Serriffe (Archive, April 1) I am 
surprised that you did not mention the large number of Pica pica san serriffa, 
an indigenous sub-species discovered in the highlands and named for the 
President by his cousin Oddie Pica, the eminent ornithologist.
