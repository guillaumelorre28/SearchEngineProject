Alan Titchmarsh is many things – gardener, TV presenter, novelist and … poet. 
Yes, Monkey didn't know either. The great man, currently entertaining the 
nation with his ITV1 afternoon show, has penned a poem called So Far … for the 
latest issue ofGardeners' World <http://www.gardenersworld.com/> magazine. It's 
all for a good cause: to find the nation's best poem inspired by a garden. Alas 
there's no room – not even in the whole of the wide world web – to reprint his 
effort in full. Here's the opening verse. "I started at this gardening lark, 
When I was young and green, Upon my grandad's cabbage patch 'Neath rows of 
runner bean." And the last: "But when I'm one and sixty, I'll toddle out the 
door 'Cos now that I'm a Sex God, It don't matter any more." Currently on the
Alan Titchmarsh Show website 
<http://www.itv.com/lifestyle/thealantitchmarshshow/>: "Alan and Rosemary cook 
a delicious rack of lamb" and "Enter the singing pensioner competition".
