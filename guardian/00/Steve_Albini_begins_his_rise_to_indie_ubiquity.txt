Rants in US fanzines had already earned Steve Albini 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/steve-albini> the enmity of the Chicago 
music community, and his group Big Black were as uncompromising as their 
frontman: a martial assault of painfully trebly guitar riffs, bleak barked 
vocals and the inhuman pulse of their drum machine, a Roland TR-606. The sleeve 
to Atomizer, their 1986 debut LP, presented the pending destruction of Earth 
with the lunatic wit of a Chuck Jones cartoon. The album itself spun deadpan 
tales of a world that deserved atomizing. It was disturbing and thrilling in 
equal measure.

Big Black broke up the following year, on the eve of releasing their second 
album – "to prevent us from overstaying our welcome", as Albini explained. He 
went on become better known as a producer, bringing his characteristically 
sparse, arid sound to albums that became landmarks – by Pixies andNirvana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana>, among 2,000 or so others. He 
retains his indie ethics: he says he records bands, rather than produces them, 
and he works for a flat fee, believing a percentage of profits would encourage 
him to make a hit record rather than a good record.
