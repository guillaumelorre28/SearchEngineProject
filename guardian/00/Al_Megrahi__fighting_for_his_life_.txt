The convicted Lockerbie bomber is fighting for his life after receiving a 
blood transfusion in hospital, his family has said.

Former Libyan intelligence officer Abdelbaset al-Megrahi's health is said to 
have deteriorated quickly.

Al-Megrahi's son, Khaled, said his father was taken to hospital for the second 
time in two days.

"My dad's health is very bad and has been worsening," Khaled said at the 
family home in Tripoli. "He is on his last breath. I don't think he can make it 
this time."

Al-Megrahi's brother Abdulhakim earlier told Reuters: "His health began to 
deteriorate quickly and we were worried about him, so took him immediately to 
the hospital where he is receiving a blood transfusion."

Al-Megrahi is the only man convicted of the bombing, which killed 270 people 
when Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie four days before Christmas in 
1988.

He was sentenced to life in prison in 2001, but was released on compassionate 
grounds in August 2009 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.

At the time, doctors estimated he had around three months to live.

Since his return to Libya <https://www.theguardian.com/world/libya>, 
al-Megrahi has rarely appeared in public. His family has on several occasions 
said that he is near death, in what was seen as an attempt to justify his 
release.
