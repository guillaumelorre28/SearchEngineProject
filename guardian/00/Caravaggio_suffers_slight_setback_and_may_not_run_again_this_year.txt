Plans for Caravaggio are up in the air after a tweaked muscle interrupted his 
training 10 days ago. Aidan O’Brien, his trainer, said on Sundayhis classy 
juvenile is now “fine” but might not be ready in time for the Middle Park at 
Newmarket on 24 September. “I imagine if Caravaggio doesn’t make the Middle 
Park, he might not run again this year,” O’Brien added.

“Originally we were thinking of going for the Middle Park and then maybe going 
on to the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile ... but, if he’s not ready in time for the 
Middle Park, he wouldn’t do the rest.” O’Brien also cast doubt on whether he 
would go for the 2,000 Guineas in May, for which he is no bigger than 9-2., 
calling him “a very quick horse”. He said he might opt for a spring trial over 
seven furlongs to start next year.
