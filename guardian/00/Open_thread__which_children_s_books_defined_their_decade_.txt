Here’s a poser: the first Harry Potter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter> novel wasn’t published until 
June 1997, but by July 1999 - when the third in the sequence, The Prisoner of 
Azkaban, was released - JK Rowling’s wizarding series was making muggles of 
everyone who ever doubted it (a roll of dishonour that included several 
publishers and a fair few early critics).

The impact of the books was undeniably swift, global and galvanising, but can 
they – as the actor and writer Brandon Robshaw assertsin a blog over on our 
children’s books website 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/29/childrens-books-sum-up-decades-back-in-time-brandon-robshaw>
 - be the defining books of the 1990s, given how late in the decade they came 
into being?

Literary judgments are always subjective but my own memory of the 1990s is 
that the towering achievement was Philip Pullman’sHis Dark Materials  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/15/philippullman>trilogy, of which 
the first two instalments were published in 1995 and 1997.

with his choices? If not, what would your alternatives be?
