The 2013 Masters champion had long indicated he had little interest in going 
to Rio for golf’s long-awaited return to the Games, preferring to focus all his 
efforts around the sport’s traditional four major championships.

But Australia’s Olympic golf captain Ian Baker-Finch had held out hope he’d 
have a change of heart and join world No1 Jason Day in a high-powered two-man 
men’s team.

“My decision has been taken as a result of an extremely busy playing schedule 
around the time of the Olympics and other commitments, both personal and 
professional,” said Scott.

“I have informed the Australian team captain and relevant authorities, who are 
understanding of my position and I wish the Australian Olympic team the very 
best of luck in Rio.”

Leishman is the next highest-ranked Australian man at No34 in the world, 
followed by Matt Jones at No70.
