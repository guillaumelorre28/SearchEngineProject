Eoin Morgan has been named the captain of a strong-looking England Lions squad 
for two four-day games against Australia A next month.

The 25-year-old Middlesex batsman is one of four players with Test caps – 
along with the Yorkshire batsman Jonny Bairstow, the Nottinghamshire 
all-rounder Samit Patel and the Kent off-spinner James Tredwell – included in 
the 13-man squad for the matches at Old Trafford on 7 August and Edgbaston on 
14 August. All members have already been capped for England Lions.

The national selector Geoff Miller said: "This is an opportunity to show they 
are capable of representing England at Test level. We expect Australia A to 
provide tough opposition and look forward to seeing how some of our most 
talented players outside the Test squad perform in these two matches."
