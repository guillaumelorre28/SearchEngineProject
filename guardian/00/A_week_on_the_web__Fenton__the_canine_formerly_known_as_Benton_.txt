It's a shaggy dog story this week. Fenton, the (actually-not-at-all-shaggy) 
dog in question, caused his owner some palpitations on Monday when he ran amok 
in Richmond Park. Someone was there to film the scene. They uploaded the clip on
YouTube <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube>. The rest is internet 
history.
