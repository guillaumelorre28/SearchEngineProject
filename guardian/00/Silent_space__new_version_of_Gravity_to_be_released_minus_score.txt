A new version of Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity> will allow viewers to enjoy the film 
minus Steven Price’s Oscar-winning score, for that true “silent space” 
experience.

Released in February on a diamond luxe edition Blu-ray, the new take 
“corrects” a key concern of some filmgoers. While Cuarón’s movie largely stuck 
to the rules of space, where objects colliding do not make a sound, Price’s 
score remained throughout. Now the new version promises to let fans “experience 
the film without music for a surprising cinematic experiment”.

 Watch the Gravity trailer 
Prior to Gravity’s release, Cuarón found himself at odds with the people at 
Warner Brothers responsible for creating trailers for the film. Explosive 
sounds had been added to the mix, despite not being present in the theatrical 
cut.

However, it is not thought that the “silent space” version represents the 
director’s true vision for Gravity. Instead it simply offers another way to 
experience the film, which won seven Oscars, includingbest director for Cuarón
