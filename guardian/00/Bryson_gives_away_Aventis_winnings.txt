Bill Bryson <https://www.theguardian.com/books/billbryson>, who last week won 
the 2004 Aventis prize for science books despite his almost complete lack of 
scientific background, today announced his decision to donate the £10,000 prize 
money to the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) children's charity.

Bryson was awarded the prize for his bestselling book A Short History of 
Nearly Everything, which traces the history of Earth, humankind and the 
universe from the Big Bang to the present day.

In response to his announcement, the Aventis Foundation declared that it will 
match Bryson's donation with a further £10,000 gift to the hospital. Bryson 
will present the entire sum of money to Great Ormond Street Hospital on June 23 
at 10am.

"The Aventis prizes were created to promote and celebrate popular science 
writing for adults and children," said Bryson, explaining his decision to 
donate the money to the GOSH children's charity. "I felt that it was 
appropriate to donate my prize money to a cause which stands for the same 
principles; the promotion and advancement of scientific thought and progress. 
Great Ormond Street Hospital children's charity is currently raising funds 
towards a new gene therapy centre at the Institute of Child Health, the 
hospital's research partner. I am thrilled that this donation will be used to 
help buy a piece of equipment for the new laboratories within the centre."
