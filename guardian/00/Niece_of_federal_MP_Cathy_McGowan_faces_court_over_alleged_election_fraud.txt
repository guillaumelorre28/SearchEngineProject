Australian federal police charged Maggie Ellen McGowan, 27, and her friend, 
Sophie Petrea Fuschen, 24, with providing false and misleading information 
because the pair allegedly voted in the seat of Indi while living in Melbourne 
during the 2013 election.

McGowan’s lawyer, Robert Stary, told the Melbourne magistrates court on Friday 
that both women were students at the time and the Australian Electoral 
Commission website clearly said students did not need to change their “home” 
address.

Stary told the court the prosecution’s case was weak and called for the 
charges to be dropped.

“If it has to be contested, it will be contested hard,” Stary told the court.

The prosecutor, Thomas Crouch, requested an adjournment so police could decide 
whether the case could proceed.

The matter was adjourned until 5 April.

Both women are excused from attending as McGowan now works in the Northern 
Territory and Fuschen will be studying abroad.

Cathy McGowan narrowly defeated Indi’s then sitting Liberal frontbencher, 
Sophie Mirabella, at the poll.
