, dubbed the “poker princess”, a former skier who spent eight years running 
exclusive games for high-end clientele until she was arrested by the FBI in

“The casting of Jessica and Idris in the two lead roles is any film-maker’s 
dream come true,” said Sorkin in a statement. “They’re two of the greatest 
actors of their generation, paired for the first time, and their chemistry will 
be electric.”

Bloom became embroiled in the world of high-stakes gambling after decamping to 
California when she failed to qualify as an Olympic skier – she was the No 3 
ranked mogul competitor in north America at the age of 21. After waitressing in 
Los Angeles, she began to host poker matches at the famous Viper Room club, but 
got in trouble with the law after demanding a share of the pot rather than tips.

Bloom was sentenced to a year’s probation and a fine of $1,000 in June 2014. 
Her memoir Molly’s Game was optioned by Sorkin’s producing partner Mark Gordon 
the same year. In the book, Bloom is kind about Affleck, DiCaprio and Damon,but 
describes Spider-Man star Tobey Maguire as a moody player and poor tipper
