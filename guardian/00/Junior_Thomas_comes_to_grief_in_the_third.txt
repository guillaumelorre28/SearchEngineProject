Britain's Guy Thomas, a 17-year-old left-hander from Hertfordshire, was 
knocked out in the third round of the Australian Open junior event by Brendon 
Evans of the United States.

Thomas, with career earnings of $585 (about Â£360) and playing his first 
tournament at Melbourne Park, lost 6-1, 4 -6, 6-2 to the American, who came 
into the event with earnings of five times that amount. The Briton had a 
tournament to remember, however, opening up with a straight-sets victory over 
the No9 seed Scott Oudsemer and then completing a straight-sets win against 
Somdey Dev Varman of India.

The world No4 Juan Carlos Ferrero, meanwhile, will lead Spain in their Davis 
Cup first-round match against Belgium next month. He will be joined by Alex 
Corretja, Carlos Moya and Albert Costa for a tie to be played on clay in 
Seville on February 7-9.

The 2000 champions will have to find a new doubles pairing, however, as Juan 
Balcells has been dropped due to a dip in form. "He is an important part of 
this team and will be a strong candidate to play again in future ties," said 
Juan Avendano, one of the coaches.

Mikhail Youzhny, 20, who snatched last year's Davis Cup for Russia with a 
five-set win over Paul-Henri Mathieu, will lead their defence in next month's 
tie against the Czech Republic. "We're counting on him now to be one of our 
leaders for many years to come," said the coach Sergei Leonyuk.
