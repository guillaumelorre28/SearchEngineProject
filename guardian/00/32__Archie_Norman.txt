ITV1's Titanic flopped, but Archie Norman has steered ITV to calmer waters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/26/itv-profits-down-almost-8percent?INTCMP=SRCH>
. The former Tory MP, who spent a decade transforming the once-ailing Asda into 
the UK's second largest supermarket chain, has stabilised ITV's performance and 
boosted the share price, despite signs of an advertising slowdown in recent 
months.

A business hit hard by the worst advertising recession in living memory has 
recovered, thanks in part to the success ofITV

Some questions still remain about the degree to which the management's 
long-term aim of reducing ITV's near-total dependence on advertising revenues 
can be fulfilled.

online, subscription services and production to drive growth – is not original, 
it seems to be working so far.
