Hi guzzlers,

On Tuesday we will again learn how much better Asian children are at maths, 
science and reading than we are with announcement of the OECD’s Pisa rankings, 
which compare the abilities of 15-year-olds from around the world.

In the last two Pisa tables, in 2009 and 2012, the top three countries for 
maths were Shanghai*,Singapore <https://www.theguardian.com/world/singapore> 
and Hong Kong*, and this year’s results are expected to be the same or similar.

(*Yes, OK, not countries, but I didn’t make the rules.)

Even though many educationalists are cautious about what we can infer from 
international comparisons, they are a major reason why theUK government 
recently announced £41m funding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/12/41m-funding-drive-to-help-schools-adopt-asian-style-maths-lessons>
 for primary schools to copy the east Asian approach to maths teaching.

But just how good are these Asian kids? Today I am setting you ten questions 
from this year’sInternational Singapore Maths Competition <http://www.ismc.sg/>
, aimed at primary Years 5 and 6. (That’s kids aged 10-11 and 11-12). The 
questions are all based on Singapore’s much lauded maths syllabus, which aims 
to teach fewer topics in greater depth. I think you will be impressed at the 
level of these problems, and many adults may find them quite challenging!

The children taking these tests had a total of 25 questions to answer in 90 
minutes. They did not have the multiple choice responses, but had to work 
everything out by themselves. They were, however, allowed to use calculators.

Make a note of your answers since the form will not give you a score but 
instead give you the answers. I will collate your submissions so when I post 
full explanations of the answers at 5pm GMT you can see how well you did 
compared to everyone else. [The percentage in square brackets is the percentage 
of Singaporean schoolchildren expected to get the right answer.]

UPDATE: The interactive element has ended but you can still answer the 
questions below.

For Year 5 pupils:

1. Mary cut off 2/5 of a piece of string. Later, she cut off another 14 m. The 
ratio of the length of string remaining to the total length cut off is 1 : 3. 
What is the length of the remaining string?

 * A. 5 m

 * B. 7 m

 * C. 10 m

 * D. 14 m 
2. The areas of the faces of a rectangular box are 84 cm2, 70 cm2 and 30 cm2. 
What is the volume of the box?
