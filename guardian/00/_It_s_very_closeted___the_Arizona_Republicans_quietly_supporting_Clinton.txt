Ruben Alvarez is upfront about the choices he has made in his own life. But he 
is not surprised that others like him tend to lurk in the shadows.

After all, it’s 2016, and it takes some guts to be a proud Republican and a 
publicHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
supporter. Especially in battleground Arizona.


“It’s not so much that Republicans in Arizona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> are supportive of Hillary Clinton 
and her candidacy,” said Alvarez, a political consultant who has worked for two 
Republican governors in the state but will be casting his ballot for Clinton in 
November.


“They’re holding their support close to the chest, but come election time, 
they’ll vote for her,” Alvarez said. “It’s very closeted.”

There aren’t all that many people like Alvarez in the Copper State, where 
every statewide office is held by a GOP member, no Democratic presidential 
candidate has prevailed in the last 20 years and Trump is scheduled to make his 
sixth campaign appearance on Tuesday afternoon. (Clinton has been here once 
this election cycle.)


But RealClear Politics’ average of the latest Arizona polls – the most recent, 
from early September, came long before Trump’s disastrous debate performance – 
shows Trump and Clinton in a virtual dead heat. The Republican was up just 2.2 
percentage points over his Democratic rival; the margin of error for the five 
polls ranged from 2.8% to 3.8%.


And just last week, the Arizona Republic shocked the political establishment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/newspaper-endorsements-donald-trump-arizona-republic>
 byendorsing Clinton 
<http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/>
 – the first time the paper has backed a Democrat in its 126-year history. The 
paper has since lost subscribers and received at least one death threat.


Phil Boas, the paper’s editorial page editor, derided Trump’s “complete 
disrespect” of this country and its institutions: “There will be no majesty to 
the presidency if you treat it like Animal House.” He said he “could not be 
more proud” of his paper and his publisher.

And he told the Guardian that he, too, is part of the 7.4% of Arizona 
Republicans that one recent poll showed support Clinton – the GOP’s favorite 
target for a generation.


“I have voted Republican my entire life,” Boas said. “This is the first time I 
will be voting for a Democrat for president. My parents were strong 
Republicans. My grandparents were Republicans.”


However, “you have a man who is so dangerous and so unfit for office that he 
has to be stopped,” Boas said. “The only way you’ll stop him is with Hillary 
Clinton.”


All of this happened before revelations in the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html> this 
weekend that the real estate mogul may have avoided paying federal taxes for 18 
years because of a nearly billion-dollar loss he claimed on his 1995 personal 
tax filing.


“It never ends with this guy,” said Grant Woods, shaking his head in disgust. 
Woods is an Arizona native. He was John McCain’s first congressional chief of 
staff. A two-term state attorney general. An influential force in Republican 
politics here for decades.


Today, he is part of Together for America, a group of more than 50 prominent 
Republicans who are helping the Clinton campaign reach out to independent 
voters and members of the GOP throughout the country.

Over coffee in downtown Phoenix, Woods was scathing in his assessment of the 
current Republican standard bearer.


“Arizona gave us Barry Goldwater, Sandra Day O’Connor, John McCain,” Woods 
said. “Straight talk works here. You’d have thought that Trump could have done 
well here, but his deficiencies are overwhelming.”


“He is the least qualified nominee in the history of the country,” Woods added.


That said, he continued: “It’s clear that the public is ready for change. The 
problem for Hillary Clinton is that she’s many things, but she doesn’t 
represent change.”

People like Woods, Alvarez and John Stubbs have their work cut out for them. 
Stubbs is co-founder of R4C16 (AKA Republicans for Clinton in 2016), a group of 
conservatives who say they want to rebuild their party in the optimistic mold 
of Ronald Reagan and believe that Trump could ruin the GOP.


Stubbs said polls show there are six million Republicans who say they could 
never vote for Trump, between 18% and 22% of those registered. But only 3.5% 
nationwide are willing to vote for Clinton.


“Our goal is closing that gap,” said Stubbs, whose group is not affiliated 
with the Democrats. “You either can live with Trump or you can’t. And if you 
can’t, you have to vote for her.”


Tell that to the Arizonans who ignored the rain on Sunday afternoon and headed 
out to the 2016 Pumpkin & Chili Party at Schnepf Farms in Queen Creek, a 
semi-rural enclave around 40 miles south of downtown Phoenix.


Mike Jones, a videographer who runs the festival’s pig races, says he hears 
lots of chatter from Republican friends who say they cannot stand Trump, but “I 
don’t know the reality of their commitment”. Jones is definitely not a Trump 
fan either.


“For the Republican side, we wanted someone Donald Trump-esque that would 
fight back,” Jones said. “Typically we have Republicans who don’t. When he 
decided not to pull punches, a lot of people got excited. I’m not one of them.”


On election day, he said, “I will probably vote more party platform. I’m 
voting for [GOP running mate] Mike Pence. That’s my wife’s only solace.”


On Sunday night, Betsy Boyer was eating barbecue with her family across the 
farm from the pig races. She is a former Chicago prosecutor who now lives in 
Scottsdale and is the major caregiver for her ailing mother.


Boyer started out as a Republican, but she now describes herself as an 
independent, like 34% of the Arizona electorate. Another 35% are registered 
Republicans; at 32% of registered voters, Democrats are outnumbered.


Boyer and her husband Tom, also a Republican-turned-independent, plan to vote 
for Clinton next month. Her 13-year-old son, Collin, would, too, if he could.


“I’m voting against Trump,” Boyer said. “I don’t think anyone else has a 
chance to beat him, so I’m voting for Hillary.”


Boyer does have a friend who is still a registered Republican but plans to 
vote for Clinton. Sitting at a picnic table, Boyer picked up her cellphone and 
dialed this elusive Arizona voter to see if the woman was willing to go public 
with her political views.


It was a short conversation.


“She doesn’t want to talk about it,” Boyer said. “She said there’d be too much 
bad language.”
