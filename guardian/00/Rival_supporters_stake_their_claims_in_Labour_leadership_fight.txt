As general secretaries of unions that have nominated Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> to remain as leader of the 
Labour party, we are writing to explain why the millions of members in our 
unions and the millions of workers beyond should vote for Jeremy.

We have all known him for many years. He has supported us, stood on our picket 
lines, celebrated our successes, and campaigned alongside us for trade union 
rights.

Jeremy’s pledge is to rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no 
community is left behind. His commitment to introducing sectoral collective 
bargaining, and mandatory collective bargaining for companies with more than 
250 employees would transform and rebalance industrial relations to make them 
fit for the 21st century.

For more than three decades Jeremy’s track record and socialist credentials 
make him the choice for leader of the Labour party. We need a Labour government 
committed to workers’ rights, social justice, government investment in our 
manufacturing sector and public sector and good quality jobs. Jeremy campaigns 
for all of these and is the person to lead theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party into government to make 
them a reality. He is the only choice to get the job done.

• The reaction from diehard Corbyn fans to Kezia Dugdale’s public declaration 
in favour of Owen Smith betrays the depth of their ignorance of the shifting 
political landscape north of the border and the possible implications for 
Labour at UK level (Scottish Labour leader backs Owen Smith against Jeremy 
Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/scottish-labour-leader-kezia-dugdale-backs-owen-smith-against-jeremy-corbyn>
, theguardian.com, 22 August). To illustrate the point, let’s look at who has 
chiefly profited from Scottish Labour’s ongoing demise, with reference to the 
most recent Scottish parliamentary elections. It wasn’t Rise, the new leftist 
party claiming to represent Old Labour values. It wasn’t Solidarity, the 
socialist Trotskyist alternative. And it wasn’t the old school Trade Unionist 
and Socialist Coalition. In theory, all of them should have gained from the 
burning desire of ordinary voters supposedly thirsting for a leftwing socialist 
alternative, but shock horror it was the centre-leaning Tories who came second 
to the SNP.

Even taking into account the split between those favouring independence and 
those favouring the status quo, that’s a funny way for disillusioned Labour 
voters to punish Scottish Labour under Dugdale for not being leftwing enough 
(though her manifesto was distinctly leftist). But I suspect this is perhaps 
too nuanced a reading for people who have already made up their minds and 
condemn anyone who doesn’t agree with them 100% as a traitor.

• As ballot papers are sent out to the 640,000 people entitled to vote in the 
Labour leadership contest, it is critical to debunk some outstanding myths that 
have grown over recent months.

For instance, that Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign will mobilise those who over 
recent years have ceased to vote for Labour and therefore will re-engage with 
the so called “core vote”.

Out of the hundred constituencies with the lowest turnout in the last two 
general elections, 92 are already held by Labour. The point being that, 
critical as mobilisation is, the issue of how to win a general election is much 
more complex than the question of engaging those who currently fail to vote at 
all.

The second key issue is the notion that it is Jeremy Corbyn and Momentum who 
are creating new ideas and putting forward radical policies that do not exist 
in other parts of the Labour family.

For instance, Zoe Williams (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/courageous-thinking-labour-education-jeremy-corbyn>
, 15 August) takes to task those she dismisses as Blairites who failed to 
encapsulate a radical agenda of change. In her words “any thought deemed to be 
redistributive found broad acceptability wrapped in a nappy. Hence Sure Start, 
the child trust fund and child poverty target.”

As the person (along with Tessa Jowell, and supported by Tony Blair and Gordon 
Brown) responsible for the introduction of Sure Start, the child trust fund and 
giving substantial support to the successful child anti-poverty target, I take 
deep offence at the Corbynistas and Momentum parading themselves as offering 
new thought and being more radical and progressive than those of us who held 
office.

I have no idea whether the shadow secretary of state for education, Angela 
Rayner, understands what is meant by a national education service because I 
have not yet ever had the privilege of meeting her.

What I do know is that it was a Labour government, not a Labour opposition, 
that transformed the life chances of children in the constituency I was proud 
to represent, and that it was Sure Start and would have been the child trust 
fund that gave the prospect of real liberation from dependency on others, and 
the ability to “control” their own lives.

Posturing is not the same thing as winning popular support.

• With reference to your report “Labour rivals vow to ensure a woman has place 
at the top 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/corbyn-smith-promise-woman-labour-leader-deputy>
” (22 August), female Labour MPs were rightly disappointed that the latest 
opportunity of having a woman as leader of the Labour party came to nothing (as 
yet). However, it is incorrect to suggest that this chance was missed “when 
[Owen] Smith knocked Angela Eagle out of the competition”. She was not “knocked 
out”; she chose to withdraw from the contest in the interests of party unity 
and in doing so showed a high degree of statesmanship and real concern for the 
party – but precious little acknowledgement she received for it.

• Steve Richards considers that local government was a “powerless desert” in 
the 1980s in contrast to the current trend to move powers from the centre (
Don’t despair – devolution offers Labour a chance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/this-is-not-the-1980s-devolution-has-changed-politics>
, 22 August). He has forgotten the role of local education authorities in those 
days, often a force for innovation and an important counter balance to central 
government and special interests. He is sadly not alone in failing to propose 
the return of this function.

• Time and time again in the media we hear that Jeremy Corbyn is a poor 
leader. In British politics since time immemorial, party leaders have adopted 
an autocratic and dictatorial style, laying down policy and instructions from 
the top, and it appears that all the PLP 80 including Heidi Alexander (Corbyn’s 
leadership shoddy, says MP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/19/corbyns-leadership-unprofessional-and-shoddy-says-heidi-alexander>
, 20 August), take it as a given.

Corbyn’s leadership style is consensual; policy is formed by debate and 
discussion. Corbyn promises a major revolution in leadership style, which this 
country so desperately needs: the PLP 80 need to grasp this simple and 
blindingly obvious notion, and, should Corbyn win the leadership election, work 
alongside him on a consensual platform.

Humankind has steadily and progressively ditched autocrats and dictators – 
let’s do it in British politics.

• Before I fill in my Labour party ballot paper, I would like to know the 
candidates’ proposals as to how (if elected) they will seek to bring about 
peace and reconciliation within the party .
