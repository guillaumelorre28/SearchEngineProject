Roger Federer looked more like his usual self as he beat Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 
5-7, 6-0, 6-2 to set up a final date with unseeded Marcos Baghdatis.

Federer had stuttered through this week, his usually immaculate game suddenly 
showing signs of weakness - but so far ahead is he that it hasn't stopped his 
advance to the final. He still looked slightly off the pace as this match 
started, but soon found the power and the sparkling shots to outdo Kiefer.

The world No1 took the first set from Kiefer without too much of a struggle 
and looked likely to take only three sets to reach his final encounter with the 
young Cypriot. But Kiefer fought back with some strong serving to take the 
second.

That was where his fightback ended, however, as Federer found his rhythm to 
demolish the German 6-0 in the third set. Federer sealed the win in the eighth 
game of the fourth set, snatching a fourth match point with a powerful serve 
that Kiefer could only parry.

Federer has beaten Baghdatis in all three of their previous meetings and 
though the Cypriot will have plenty of support on Sunday, Federer will be 
confident of victory.
