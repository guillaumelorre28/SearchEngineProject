In central Australian desert country made famous by the painter Albert 
Namatjira, an art studio, adorned with a tiled mosaic and surrounded by red 
dirt and a pink fence, houses a group of internationally respected artists.

It’s buzzing inside the studio when Guardian Australia visits. The 
Hermannsburg potters, a collective of female Western Arrernte artists who 
recently celebrated 25 years of making their distinctive clay and terracotta 
pots, are preparing to travel to Melbourne for an exhibition that brings 
together the worlds ofAustralian rules football 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-rules-football> and remote 
Aboriginal community living.

The National Gallery of Victoria show, Our Land Is Alive, 
<http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/exhibition/our-land-is-alive/> will feature a set of 
20 themed pots celebrating iconic Aboriginal players and historic moments in 
AFL history. The studio just sent off the last of them to the gallery, and 
several of the women will attend as artists-in-residence to talk to visitors 
and teach young children the art of pottery.

But first they have a class to teach at the local school and an appearance at 
the central Australian art world’s night of nights, the Desert Mob exhibition, 
opening130km away in Alice Springs. The women chat and joke with each other in 
their own language. Flustered managers try to ensure everything is organised for
Melbourne <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne>, Alice – and 
tomorrow’s class.

Senior artist Judith Inkamala works on a tribute to the Melbourne Demons, 
painting a small red, white and blue bird, while teaching her granddaughter the 
skill. Behind her, Anita Ratara works quietly, keeping warm under a Collingwood 
beanie. In front of Rahel Ungwanaka is an unfinished lion figurine, which will 
eventually sit on top of a pot dedicated to the Brisbane team.

Hermannsburg’s AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> loyalties are 
spread across the national competition and the potters’ studio is dotted with 
tributes to various teams. Those famous moments on the exhibition pots include 
a goal by Michael Long, and Nicky Winmar lifting his shirt to point to his 
black skin in response to racial abuse he received at a 1993 game.

Australian rules football is a big deal in remote Indigenous communities, 
particularly for young people who usually only see their favourite sporting 
stars on TV. The recentAdam Goodes controversy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes>, in which the nation was 
gripped by debate over racial taunting and abuse of the Aboriginal AFL player, 
has lent extra significance to the potters’ exhibition.

“It made us really down when Adam Goodes was on the news for the racism. He 
was doing the motion like our Aboriginal players when they kick a goal,” says 
art centre assistant manager Selina Malbunka, referring to Goodes’s celebratory 
war dance.

“It’s really important for Aboriginal people that we are proud we can see our 
colour playing in the AFL,” she says. “When [the kids] see an AFL player come 
to the community they’re really proud ... Out here young people have never been 
to the city and they only see the AFL players on the TV.”

Each pot takes about a week to make, although they normally feature community 
teams. The artists usually create work around their own experience and 
knowledge, explains centre manager Isabelle Waters.

“Some of the senior artists have been down to the MCG and met Michael Long so 
they have that connection. They all have their own take on it – Hayley did 
really current players, like Cyril Rioli and Lewis Jetta, whereas some of the 
older ladies did past players, even further back than Michael Long, players 
like Jeff Farmer and Syd Jackson.”

Hayley Coulthard is painting the side of a vase with a landscape of nearby 
Glen Helen Gorge. The dramatic environment of the central desert region 
features heavily in most of the artists’ work, and has translated surprisingly 
well to the football exhibit, says Waters.

We are proud [when] we can see our colour playing in the AFL
Selina Malbunka 
“What’s made these so great is they’ve approached it as landscape painters. So 
where they’d normally do their mountain, their country, they’ve instead got 
this sea of people. They’ve really captured that interaction between the 
audience and the game in a way I think they pull off because they’re 
essentially landscape artists.”

Taking a break from her pottery, Inkamala leads Guardian Australia through the 
community’s historic precinct – now a popular stop on the Grey Nomad trail – 
and shares stories of her childhood, and the old mission days.

Hermannsburg, or Ntaria as it is known to Indigenous people, was established 
as a religious mission in the late 1800s by German Lutherans. It is now home to 
approximately 700 people, and serves as a hub for surrounding outstations. 
Inkamala was schooled on the mission and later employed by staff, paid in 
rations.

We walk past the old meat store, bakery, and morgue, and go inside the church, 
built by missionaries in 1877, which is still used for services.

“Men, women, children, boys and girls, they sing in Aranda, out of the Aranda 
hymn book,” says Inkamala, before singing a snippet of Hallelujah, popping 
segments of mandarin into her mouth between verses.

“I learned from my mother and from my aunty our Aranda songs, but sometimes 
the schoolteacher, a white person, she translated with English and made a book 
for singing in the choir.”

While much of the focus has been on the AFL pots, the Melbourne exhibition 
will also include a full clay model of the Hermannsburg church, built by German 
Lutherans in 1877. Inkamala describes how the details of the church, down to 
the hanging lights and baptismal font, were recreated by the artists.

The following day the women gather again to work a little more, and hold a 
class at the local school before heading to Alice Springs.

The exhibition opens with speeches and music outside the Araluen cultural 
precinct gallery. Then the hordes of art collectors are allowed to rush through 
the doors. Some have been lined up for hours, hoping to make the first savvy 
“acquisitions” of prestigious works.

The potters’ display is front and centre in one of the gallery halls.

The gallery is packed. It’s a big night out and the artists are swamped by 
admirers, keen to hear the stories depicted in the paintings. Ungwanaka 
describes the clay frill-neck lizard she created. Malbunka translates for Rona 
Rabuntja, who is deaf and signs the story of the horseriding on her pot. Ratara 
points out a small figure on Inkamala’s work – it’s her as a young girl, 
wearing a yellow dress at Thanksgiving in Kuprilya Springs in the 1960s.

“The potters are a really important part of the Desert Mob exhibition, but 
also the Desart family,” Philip Watkins, CEO of Desart, tells Guardian 
Australia inside.

“They’re telling their stories … creating their work, using their hands,” he 
says.

“I feel very privileged and honoured when I’m in their studio space, and the 
fun they have and the joy they have in their work and with each other. It’s a 
beautiful place to be.”
