For iOS <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ios> 10, Siri has been opened 
up to third-party developers, letting users book Ubers, send WeChat messages, 
and watch sports, all by asking Siri to do it for them.

Faces and Places have returned to the iPhone and iPad’s Photos app, after they 
were removed when iPhoto was replaced by Photos. Places arranges pictures by 
the geolocation information, just like it used to, but Faces has seen a boost: 
the app now uses “advanced computer learning” to recognise, not only individual 
faces, but also other things such as horses and objects, and to cluster 
together events based on more than just time and location.

Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> strongly emphasised the 
fact that all this processing is done “locally, on the device” – a clear swipe 
at competitor Google, which relies on uploading photos and personal data to its 
cloud for further processing.

Apple announced a “redesign from the ground up” for Apple Music, its streaming 
service. The update cleans up the look of the already-minimalist interface, as 
well as adding lyrics to playing songs for the app’s 15 million subscribers.

The Phone app received the same treatment Music got a few years back: 
third-party voice calling apps can now get almost the same access as the 
built-in phone app, with a full-screen calling dialogue, and the ability to 
pick which app – say, WhatsApp or Skype – becomes the default for calling each 
contact.

Apple also overhauled its Messages app, making emojis three times bigger and 
adding predictive emoji. It introduced visual effects for text and pictures 
plus inline rich linking. Messages will also be opened up to third-party 
developers.

 Apple unveiled, macOS Sierra, its latest desktop and laptop OS and replacement 
for OS X. Photograph: Apple 
MacOS replaces OS X and is called macOS Sierra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/mac-os-sierra-apple-os-x-siri-desktop-wwdc>
 in this iteration. The naming change brings the desktop OS name inline with 
the format of iOS, watchOS and tvOS.

Siri, Apple’s personal assistant, will come to desktop and laptop computers 
for the first time. It will answer questions on Macs and can be used for 
messaging as well as search and music control.

The new macOS will have much greater iCloud integration, with a universal 
clipboard and automatic sharing of files from the desktop across multiple 
devices. Apple says by deleting local content and hosting it in the cloud it 
will free up large amount of hard drive space. It also announced Apple Pay for 
the web, authenticated using an iPhone or Apple Watch.

Announcing WatchOS 3, Apple sought to tackle some of the biggest criticisms of 
the Apple Watch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/09/apple-watch-smartwatch>: 
its slow speed, poor user interface and over-reliance on Siri. WatchOS 3 will 
load apps into memory before they are launched – making them seven times faster 
to launch according to Apple – and will enable background refresh so that apps 
are already up to date the second they’re tapped.

The interface is also improved with the death of Glances, the watch’s 
confusing semi-apps that could be accessed by swiping up from the bottom. 
Instead, the up-to-date apps can be accessed from a tap of the side button. The 
over-reliance on Siri is tackled with a second method of text input. Users will 
be able to write out individual letters on the screen, typing short messages if 
they want to reply to texts or emails.

And if you have a Mac as well as an Apple Watch (presumably most people who 
own the wearable technology), you’ll be able to unlock your computer 
automatically, just by being near it while you’re wearing the watch.

 Apple tvOS updates are introduced at WWDC. Photograph: Apple 
The Apple TV received a few new features for its update due this autumn. A new 
remote app lets users control their TV through their iPhones. A new single 
sign-on service lets them log into various TV apps with just a simple, 
Apple-mediated screen. And Siri has been opened up to a third-party developer, 
letting users search for YouTube videos with their voice.

The Apple TV can also become a remote-control hub for the company’s smart 
home, Internet of Things control system called HomeKit.
