We Are What We Are <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPG9kZmEwcs> (18) 
(Jim Mickle, 2013, US) Bill Sage, Ambyr Childers, Julia Garner. 103 mins

The story of an archaic backwoods family with very good reasons for their 
insularity, this spends such a long time laying out its twisted domestic 
set-up, it's almost as if it's in denial about being a horror movie (remade 
from a Mexican original). It's a wise decision. If you don't know the family's 
Big Secret already, it would be a shame to spoil it; let's just say it pulls 
the story into real shock and gore territory.

The Book Thief <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92EBSmxinus> (12A) 
(Brian Percival, 2013, US/Ger) Sophie Nélisse, Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson. 
131 mins

A smart but syrupy wartime tale that traverses well-trodden territory – from 
The Reader to Life Is Beautiful – as a young girl is adopted by goodly Germans, 
who then harbour a Jewish refugee. Literary wisdom and Nazi intolerance battle 
for youthful souls.

Non-Stop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/feb/26/non-stop-liam-neeson-julianne-moore-video-interview>
 (NC)
(Jaume Collet-Serra, 2014, US/Fr) Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Lupita Nyong'o. 
106 mins

Neeson seems rather taken with his Taken persona. Here, he's an action-ready 
air marshal charged with foiling an unknown in-flight killer/hijacker, who's 
making it look like he's the villain. The action is more thumbs texting than 
bullets flying, for the most part.

Ride Along <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKPULWWK-Xk> (12A) 
(Tim Story, 2014, US) Ice Cube, Kevin Hart, Tika Sumpter. 100 mins

This mismatched buddy cop comedy has been a huge hit in the US, despite being 
so by-the-book it's almost criminal. Thus, a macho, rule-bending cop (Cube) 
agrees to take his screeching prospective brother-in-law (Hart) out on duty. 
Etcetera. The personalities of the leads are just about all you've got.

As The Palaces Burn <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn4L8QYQclo> (15) 
(Don Argott, 2014, US/Col/Ind/Isr/Ven) 121 mins

Metal goes on trial in this rockumentary, via the strange case of little-known 
(but apparently globally huge) US band Lamb Of God, whose lead singer found 
himself facing manslaughter charges following a fatal stage-diving incident in 
the Czech Republic.

Bafta Shorts 2014 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zZB4USKxWY> (15) 
(Various, 2013, UK) Tom Cullen, Mackenzie Crook, Maxine Peak. 124 mins

Feature-length programme of eight nominees from this year's awards, including 
live-action winner Room 8, animation winner Sleeping With The Fishes and space 
sci-fi Orbit Ever After.

Unforgiven <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qDzUq7Xevs> (15) 
(Lee Sang-il) Ken Watanabe, Akira Emoto, Kôichi Satô. 135 mins

Clint Eastwood's latter-day western translated, perfectly acceptably, to 1880s 
Japan. Consider it payback for all Hollywood's Kurosawa-plundering.

Funny Face <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6VLdVrVQGQ> (U) 
(Stanley Donen, 1957, US) Audrey Hepburn, Fred Astaire, Kay Thompson. 103 mins

Reissue for the breezy musical romcom/fashion satire, with Hepburn's reluctant 
model leading snapper Astaire a merry dance around Paris.

Shaadi Ke Side Effects <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu18_rNpTA0> (12A) 
(Saket Chaudary, 2014, Ind) Farhan Akhtar, Vir Das, Vidya Balan. 142 mins

Sequel to hit romcom Pyaar Ke Side Effects, with different actors playing the 
lead couple, now coping with parenthood.

Siva Senai <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYUuy9NM1AE> (12A) 
(N Ratha, 2013, Ind) Sujith, Dharsiya, Anushya. 124 mins

UK-set Tamil action movie.
