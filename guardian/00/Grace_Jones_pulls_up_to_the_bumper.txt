A regular with Andy Warhol on the Studio 54 scene, Grace Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/grace-jones> had successfully made the 
transition from model to singer with her first three albums produced under the 
tutelage of disco producer Tom Moulton (Never Can Say Goodbye, Disco Inferno). 
For her next move, she decamped to the Bahamas to record a trio of albums at 
Island's Compass Point Studios that would define her career: Warm Leatherette, 
Nightclubbing and Living My Life. With reggae's premium rhythm section Sly 
Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare and Island's Chris Blackwell co-producing, 1980's 
Warm Leatherette did OK, but it was Nightclubbing that perfected her 
post-disco, new wave sound and propelled seductive hits such as Pull Up to the 
Bumper into the charts around the world. Dub production, Chic-style funk licks, 
sound effects, pulsing drums (and more than a dash of innuendo:pull up … to the 
… bumper, baby …) – it's one of those rare records that manages to replicate 
the sensation of actually being in a club.
