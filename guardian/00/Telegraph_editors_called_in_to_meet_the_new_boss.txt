The editors of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, and senior executives from both 
titles, will this week have one-to-one meetings withAidan Barclay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/aidanbarclay>, the representative of the 
family that bought the papers for Â£665 million.

'It will not be a grilling, more a getting-to-know-you,' said one Telegraph 
executive. 'The family hasn't had the opportunity to meet us individually yet.'

But Martin Newland and Dominic Lawson, daily and Sunday editors, respectively, 
will be keen to make a good impression. While the Barclays have said there will 
not be a 'revolution', there are some who believe a change of proprietor 
eventually means a change of editor.

The Barclays are also thought to be concerned about high-cost units within the 
titles' managerial and advertising structure, associated with the Telegraph ' 
old guard'.

The Barclays do not complete the acquisition of the papers until the end of 
July - a timetable that could be delayed if legal moves by Lord Black, the 
former owner, are successful.

A Delaware court is expected to rule this week on Black's application to have 
the sale considered by all shareholders, including himself, before it is 
officially completed. If the completion misses the deadline, it will be put off 
for a full month.
