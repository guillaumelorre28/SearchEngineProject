Disney fantasy Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney as an inventor who 
travels with a teenage girl to a strange utopia,scored a disappointing $40.7m 
in its first four days to top the US box office

Directed by The Incredibles’ Brad Bird, the film is reported to have cost 
$180m to produce, a figure the studio may now struggle to see a return on with 
the film having also performed weakly outside North America. Globally, it has 
just £67.4m going into its second weekend.

Tomorrowland’s failure was immediately labelled a sign of Hollywood’s 
inability to produce successful original content by observers. Of the top 10 
highest-grossing movies at the US box office in 2015 so far, six are sequels 
and three more are based on comic books, novels or fairy tales. Only Home, 
Dreamworks Animation’s tale of a young girl who befriends an alien visitor to 
Earth, could be cited as a genuinely original property.

Tomorrowland is another low point in Clooney’s career: the actor-director’s 
filmThe Monuments Men

 failed to win over audiences or critics last year.

Second place on the North American chart went to last week’s number one, the 
comedy sequelPitch Perfect 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/pitch-perfect-2>
, with $30.3m in its second week. Elizabeth Banks’s film may yet emerge as the 
the top movie of the weekend once estimates are confirmed. Tomorrowland’s total 
for the same three-day period was only $32.2m – a whisker ahead.

Horror remake Poltergeist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/poltergeist-2015-review> debuted 
in fourth space with a respectable $23m. The new version of Tobe Hooper’s 
celebrated 1982 chiller about a family who discover they are sharing their new 
home with a malevolent ghost stars Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt and Jared 
Harris.

Mad Max: Fury Road landed just ahead in third place, with another $23.8m in 
its second week for a two-week total of $87.3m. The top five was rounded out by 
superhero sequel TheAvengers: Age of Ultron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/avengers-the-age-of-ultron>, with another 
$20.8m for a four-week total of $404m. Joss Whedon’s film also overtook Iron 
Man 3 to become the seventh highest-grossing film of all time globally, where 
it boasts a $1.263bn haul.


There were no other new movies in this week’s top 10.
