Andy Murray is expected to decide after practice on Tuesday afternoon whether 
to pull out of theATP World Tour Finals

The world No3 picked up a groin injury in practice last week and struggled 
through a 6-4, 7-5 defeat by David Ferrerbefore revealing he was considering 
his future in the tournament

Murray does not have to make a decision until just before the start of his 
second round-robin match against Tomas Berdych on Wednesday afternoon, but he 
will assess his condition in a practice session at the O2 Arena on Tuesday.

If the Scot feels the injury, which appeared to affect him particularly on his 
favoured backhand against Ferrer, is too inhibiting then he is likely to bring 
a premature end to his season and allow the Serb Janko Tipsarevic to take his 
place.

The round-robin format of the tournament means Murray can still reach the 
semi-finals despite Monday's defeat, but he is now a firm outsider and will 
probably have to beat both Berdych and the world No1, Novak Djokovic, a tough 
task even if he was fully fit.

Murray, who has losing records against both players, is renowned for his 
reluctance to pull out of tournaments and the last time he withdrew midway 
through an event was in Dubai nearly three years ago.
