By turns affectionate and exasperated, Rodge Glass documents the life and 
eccentricities of the mercurial novelist, muralist, playwright and poet who has 
been hailed as Scotland's greatest writer since Walter Scott. Aping many of the 
stylistic techniques of Alasdair Gray's seminal novel, Lanark, Glass draws 
together diary entries, critical commentary and punning footnotes, gently 
subverting the biographical tradition and disrupting the broad chronology of 
Gray's life with personal anecdotes. The result is a picture as sprawling and 
rich as one of Gray's own murals, but tinged with a self-effacement that has 
more in common with the man than the work and risks making Gray appear a rather 
minor figure.
