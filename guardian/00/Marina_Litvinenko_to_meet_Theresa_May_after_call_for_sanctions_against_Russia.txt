The widow of Alexander Litvinenko will meet the home secretary, Theresa May, 
on Thursday, a week after the government indicated it would not take punitive 
measures against Russiadespite a report

 finding Vladimir Putin “probably approved” the former spy’s murder.


Marina Litvinenko 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/marina-litvinenko-alexander-murder-inquiry-report>
 will visit the Home Office in the afternoon, her solicitor Elena Tsirlina 
said. She is likely to make a statement afterwards. It is unclear whether May 
intends to take any action on a list of demands Marina Litvinenko submitted by 
letter to David Cameron.

She has called for the government to expel all Russian intelligence agents 
from the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/widow-alexander-litvinenko-calls-for-further-sanctions-russia>
 – both those based at the Russian embassy and others working under deep cover. 
She also wantstargeted sanctions against named individuals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/widow-alexander-litvinenko-calls-for-further-sanctions-russia>
 connected with the polonium murder.

The individuals include Putin and Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s FSB 
spy agency at the time of the murder in 2006, as well as several other 
politicians and Kremlin officials. The letter calls for asset freezes and 
travel bans similar to those imposed by the US in 2012 following the death in 
prison of the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.

Speaking in the Commons last week, May condemned Litvinenko’s murder as a 
“blatant and unacceptable” breach of international law. She described it as a 
state-sponsored act and one that was deeply disturbing.

However, she said there was a wider national security interest in retaining a 
guarded engagement withRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>, 
including working with Moscow to bring about a peace settlement with Syria.

Litvinenko’s lawyer Ben Emmerson QC said the government’s response was 
“craven” He argued that Cameron had said he had zero tolerance for terrorism 
but was apparently prepared to overlook nuclear terrorism carried out on the 
streets of London by foreign states.

In 2013, May turned down Litvinenko’s request for the inquest into her 
husband’s death to be converted into a public inquiry, which could consider 
classified government documents. May cited relations with Russia as a factor. 
Litvinenko applied for a judicial review and won.


At the time, Litvinenko said: “As one woman to another, I ask her [May] to 
consider how she would feel in my position. If her husband had been murdered in 
this horrible way, wouldn’t she want to get to the truth?”

The inquiry ran for five months last year 
<https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/hearings>, and included secret sessions at 
which British intelligence agents gave evidence. Last Thursday its chairman, 
Sir Robert Owen,published his report <https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/report>
. It was more damning than expected. It found that two Russian assassins, 
Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi, had poisoned Litvinenko, acting “on behalf of 
others”.

It concluded: “The FSB operation to kill Mr Litvinenko was probably approved 
by Mr Patrushev and also by President Putin.”
