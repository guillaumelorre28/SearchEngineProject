Masters with a comprehensive 6-2, 6-2 win overAndy Roddick

The 24-year-old Scot dominated throughout to record his 27th win in his last 
28 matches and extend his unbeaten run to 18 matches.

Murray comfortably claimed the first set in 31 minutes, setting the tone when 
he broke Roddick's serve in the first game before holding his own serve.

He continued to apply pressure on the American's serve and produced a stunning 
backhand to earn three break points in game seven, and duly converted one to go 
5-2 up. He wrapped up the first set in style with a sensational winner as 
Roddick seemed to have few answers to the one-way traffic.

Things went from bad to worse for the American when Murray immediately broke 
his serve in the second set before holding serve in the second game.

Roddick vented his frustration to the umpire, Mohamed Lahyani, by destroying 
his racket, earning a code violation for racket abuse as a result, as Murray 
won the next two games to take a 4-0 lead in the second set.

The 29-year-old from Texas then dug in and held serve to get himself on the 
scoreboard, but Murray hit back immediately with a hold to love to put himself 
on the brink of victory.

Roddick finally tested Murray on the way to claiming his fourth game but it 
was too little, too late as Murray unleashed his sixth and seventh aces of the 
day to seal an emphatic straight-sets triumph.
