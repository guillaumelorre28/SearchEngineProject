Officials said an inmate assaulted the Aurora movie theater gunman James 
Holmes and a security officer at theColorado 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado> state penitentiary.

Adrienne Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections, 
told the Denver Post <http://goo.gl/SJeY1w> the inmate lunged at Holmes and 
took a few swings at him while the officer was escorting Holmes through a 
hallway on 8 October. Holmes was not injured.

Jacobson said the 27-year-old inmate accused of attacking Holmes would be 
disciplined at a hearing inside the prison.

In August, a judge sentenced the 27-year-old to life in prison without parole 
for killing 12 people and wounding 70 others at a movie theater in suburban
Denver <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/denver> in July 2012. 


Holmes is allowed to spend four hours each day in a day hall. No other inmates 
are in his cellblock.
