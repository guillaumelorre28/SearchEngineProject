Built for art enthusiasts and professionals, Curiator <http://curiator.com/> 
is an online community where you can store your favourite works and discover 
new art through other people. Unlike most other art platforms it's a place not 
to buy, but to enjoy art. It's a bit like a museum – a huge, digital, 
user-generated one. This museum, however, was in urgent need of a mobile app.

If you've been to an art fair, you will have seen people take a photo of an 
artwork and then one of the label to remember the artist. Then their photos 
disappear in the catacombs of iPhoto, never to be looked at again.

We decided that we wanted our app to take care of that, not just by storing 
the artwork in your digital art collection so you can find it again later, but 
by actually reading and analysing the label using optical character recognition 
(OCR) technology, so it could then extract the artist's name and artwork title. 
We knew it would be a tool that every art fair hopper was waiting for.

There were, however, two initial steps to overcome in our masterplan to 
transform how people consume art on and offline: a four-month timeline and a 
practically nonexistent budget.

We got quotes from a few app-developing friends, but we were looking at 
numbers for which one can buy a nice Mercedes – one with bullet proof glass, 
seats made of baby whale leather and a 24-carat gold exhaust pipe. Luckily, 
there was Marc, our friend who runsDu Da Group <http://www.dudagroup.com/>, a 
boutique app development agency in Zurich. Marc had been on Curiator from the 
early days and he got what we were doing, and what could be in it for him. Marc 
was our man.

There were quite a few hiccups on the long road to the App Store. One of them 
being that there were too many boobs in our app – it's art, things can get 
graphic – so we had to build a censorship cloak and a way for users to flag 
explicit content. The App Store also told us to ban the users who had uploaded 
the inappropriate content which, for obvious reasons, we never did.

Less than two weeks before our launch event, the first, simple version of the 
app was approved, but it was missing the most crucial part: a way to add art. 
During the time that Du Da Group had been fighting the App Store lords, we had 
been developing and testing the OCR part on our side.

We used Tesseract <http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/>, an open source 
software library maintained by Google to take care of the text recognition. 
It's quite straightforward to implement but OCR is slow. There was no way we 
were going to get this information back instantaneously, so we had to design a 
queue where a user's uploads would be waiting for his or her approval after 
they had been processed in the background.

All of this would be communicated to the app using a custom built API. The 
user experience was quite complex, but we managed to boil it down into an 
intuitive and easy interface.

Our event was getting dangerously close. The plan was to give a live demo of 
the OCR functionality. The press, people from the New York art scene and our 
friends were going to be there. The different parts eventually fell in place 
four days before the event. As if by magic, it somehow worked out, but despite 
our request for an "expedite approval" we failed to get in the App Store in 
time.

Luckily we had our development version ready to go, so at least we were able 
to do our live demo. There were a few hundred people watching the big screen 
when we, completely unrehearsed, took a photo of the label and waited for the 
servers to respond. A few long seconds of suspense later, applause. It was a 
miracle … or great engineering.
