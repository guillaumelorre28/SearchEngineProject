1. Socceroos yet to see out a 90-minute performance

Fox Sports’ pundit Mark Bosnich described the Socceroos’ first half 
performance against Japan as the most promising football he had seen since the
Ecuador game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/06/australia-v-ecuador-five-things-we-learned>
. In that game, Australia took a 3-0 lead into half-time only to be pinned back 
in the second half, losing 4-3 after being reduced to 10-men early in the 
second half. It’s not the first time the Socceroos have failed to play out a 
consistent 90 minute display. In the past 12 months, Australia have performed 
in patches – 20 minutes here, 60 minutes there. At the World Cup, 45 minutes of 
dominance against the Dutch and 70 minutes of quality football against Chile 
was enough for the fans to being positive about steps being taken but, 
increasingly, these patches have been not enough to outweigh the negatives of 
losing.

After the defeat to Japan, “We were excellent first half and then, to begin 
the second half, I thought we looked comfortable but we conceded that goal and 
that gave them the momentum and we lost a little bit of belief,” said coachAnge 
Postecoglou <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ange-postecoglou>, who will 
have to continue to use all his managerial nous and experience to ensure the 
Socceroos are ready come 9 January.

2. Defensive lapses continue to prove costly

hadn’t defended set pieces well all night and fell behind after, once again, a 
lapse in concentration without the ball.

Australia has been plagued by these costly errors. In the past, Australia’s 
inability to hold a consistent high line has beenan issue 
<http://www.australiascout.com/2014/socceroos-tactics-defensive-problems/>. The 
failure of one defender to step out with the rest of the back four has often 
kept opposition attackers onside as they move into the box to finish off moves. 
Jason Davidson against the Netherlands, Davidson, again, against Spain and more 
recently Alex Wilkinson against Qatar have been just a fraction too slow. But 
that is all opponents need to be kept onside and Australia has been made to pay.

Against Japan, Australia kept a consistent back line and, even though they 
were helped by the linesman in the first half, they didn’t suffer from the same 
defensive issue. But it was the lapse in concentration at a set piece that 
proved to be just as costly.

3. Ange Postecoglou has settled on a formation but not his players 

“We played as a 4-3-3 in the Middle East,” said Ange Postecoglou 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-17/top-of-the-league-november-17/5896232> 
in the build up to the Japan game, “and that’s probably why we weren’t as fluid 
because we changed the system and played with just the one holding midfielder. 
Changing to a 4-3-3 was always going to be part of the evolution of the team 
... In the Middle East, when we played with only the one holding midfielder, 
that’s certainly what we’ll be doing going into the Asian Cup.”

The Socceroos had briefly experimented with the 4-3-3 formation in their 1-1 
draw with South Africa in May but Postecoglou turned back to the formation in 
the matches againstQatar and United Arab Emirates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/15/socceroos-asian-tour-five-things-we-learned>
. With a recognised holding midfielder in Mile Jedinak and an abundance of 
mobile, box-to-box players, the 4-3-3 formation suits the current playing squad 
which does not have a natural, creative attacking playmaker. One of those more 
mobile players is Melbourne City’s Aaron Mooy, who came off the bench to become 
the 42nd player used during his reign as manager. Of those 42 players, some are 
no longer in the picture of national team selection, but Postecoglou has 
created a large pool of players who have been exposed to his training and 
playing methods and who have now all been exposed to international football. 
That is a positive step in the regeneration of the Socceroos. But the next 
step, the Asian Cup in January, is about nailing down a strong 23-man squad 
from Postecoglou’s pool of 40-50 players.

4. Japan were superior technically and tactically

Few would have expected Australia to dominate possession and the proceedings 
in the first half against Japan. But a tactical and personnel change at half 
time allowed the hosts to improve and shine in the second half.

Japan had started as a 4-3-3, with Makoto Hasebe as the only holding 
midfielder. But a deeper than anticipated defensive block and the movements of 
Australia’s wingers, who moved inside when in possession, saw Hasebe 
overwhelmed. Javier Aguirre changed formation at half-time, with Yasuhito Endo 
making way for Konno who moved into a second holding midfielder role next to 
Hasebe.

That freed up Shinji Kagawa and Japan to pressure higher up the pitch and 
limit Australia’s possession. The swap proved effective and Japan quickly 
established their dominance. Not only because they were able to react 
tactically, Japan’s technical superiority also allowed them to turn the screws 
on Australia. Shinji Okazaki’s sublime finish to put Japan 2-0 up was an 
example of that technical ability, while behind Okazaki, Honda and Kagawa 
pulled the creative strings.

5. New attacking style, same outcome

Australia are still reliant on Tim Cahill for goals. Twelve months to the day 
since Postecoglou’s first game in charge againstCosta Rica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/19/ange-postecoglou-socceroos-tactics-costa-rica>
, Cahill remains the only Australian to score from open play. It’s a worrying 
statistic and one that needs rectifying. Australia need a variety of attacking 
threats to avoid being one dimensional, a label that could be placed on the 
side given their reliance on Cahill’s forehead.

Australia had started the Japan game with Cahill on the bench and Mathew 
Leckie playing as the central striker in a 4-3-3. James Troisi and Robbie Kruse 
flanked Leckie, but when Australia had possession, both wingers took up narrow 
positions in between Japan’s line of defence and midfield. This allowed 
Australia to create overloads in the centre of midfield but once again that 
crucial final pass and/or finish was lacking.

In the absence of goals elsewhere, Australia will have to rely on Cahill for a 
little while longer. Perhaps afuture strike pairing 
<https://twitter.com/JoeGorman_89/status/534678576923041793> of Tomi Juric and 
Kerem Bulut will be the solution to all Australia’s woes? We can all dream.
