Have you ever wondered what language Oompa-Loompas speak, or what the plural 
is ofquadropus, or what rhymes with frobscottle? Or what the difference is 
between awhangdoodle and a giant wangdoodle (hint: only one is deadly)? Then the
Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary 
<https://www.roalddahl.com/shop/books/oxford-roald-dahl-dictionary> is here to 
help you.

Roald Dahl <https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl> invented over 500 
words and character names, from the famousOompa-Loompas and whizzpopping to 
lesser-known Dahlisms like humplecrimp, lixivate, sogmire and zoonk, but this 
is the first time many of them have featured in a dictionary. It may also be 
the first time that the wordssnozzberry, snozzcumber and snozzwanger have 
appeared on the same page as one another, as they occur in different stories. 
Whereas slimysnozzcumbers grow in Giant Country, the more appetizing 
snozzberries are found, contrariwise, in the land of the tiny Minpins (though 
somehow Willy Wonka also manages to source them for hislickable wallpaper). And 
snozzwangers? Well, you’ll have to look in the dictionary for those.

Dahl knew how much children (and their grown-ups) love words like these, with 
letter combinations that are fun to pronounce, such as –ozz or –izz, or –iggle 
or-obble: hence creations like the fizzwiggler, the whiffswiddle and the 
grobblesquirt (who wouldn’t like saying grobblesquirt?), as well as gobblefunk 
itself, the name we now give to the lexicon of words he invented. He often 
built new words from old, swopping prefixes and blending syllables to create 
words likemispise, poppyrot and sogmire; and he particularly loved the word 
play of alliteration (good for insults such asgrizzly old grunion) and 
spoonerisms, such asmideous harshland or the inspired Dahl’s Chickens (aka 
Charles Dickens).


All these words, and many like them, feature in the new dictionary. But a Dahl 
dictionary needs to help readers young and old to navigate through thewhole of 
Dahl’s world, so it also explains unusual words you may encounter there, such as
steeplejack and rapscallion, as well as more humdrum words which have special 
significance in the stories, such as the humblealarm-clock and egg-beater (used 
in unlikely ways by witches and giants respectively). And if you are a budding 
Matilda, it will also help you to find the perfect word to describe Dahl’s 
characters, whether they behirsute (Mr Twit), asinine (Mr Wormwood) or oviform 
(Knids) – and to learn some very rude words used by giants (let’s just say
bopmuggered).

So don’t be biffsquiggled any longer! Here are some key Dahl words from the 
dictionary:


If you feel biffsquiggled, you are confused or puzzled. The word biffsquiggled 
is made up ofbiff ‘punch’ and squiggled, as when you are biffsquiggled, you 
feel as if your brain is reeling from a punch and is as muddled as a squiggly 
piece of doodling.


Frobscottle is a green fizzy drink that giants drink instead of water. Unlike 
snozzcumbers it tastes delicious. The bubbles in frobscottle sink down rather 
than rise up, so if you drink a lot, you end upwhizzpopping.


If you gobblefunk with words, you play around with them and invent new words 
or meanings. The wordgobblefunk sounds a bit like gobbledegook, a kind of 
language that some grown-ups use that is full of meaningless words.


A human bean is what the giants of Giant Country call a human. (It sounds a 
bit likehuman being, but tastier.) Most giants eat human beans, but the BFG is 
a vegetarian giant, so he only eatssnozzcumbers.

A snozzcumber is a knobbly vegetable like an enormous cucumber with black and 
white stripes.Snozzcumbers taste disgusting but they are all the BFG has to 
eat, as he refuses to hunthuman beans like other giants.


Phizz-whizzing and whizzpopping may sound similar, but they mean very 
different things! Something that isphizz-whizzing is excellent or splendid. 
Whizzpopping, on the other hand, is what happens when air comes out of your 
bottom with a popping sound (as when you drink a lot offrobscottle). Giants find
whizzpopping more socially acceptable than burping.


Scrumdiddlyumptious food is utterly delicious. The Fleshlumpeating Giant is 
very keen to eat the Queen, as he thinks she will have ‘an especially 
scrumdiddlyumptious flavour.’


A trogglehumper is one of the very worst nightmares you can have. (Words that 
Dahl invented that start withtrog- always mean unpleasant things!)


Zozimus is what dreams are made of. The BFG whisks zozimus with an egg-beater 
until it forms bubbles just like soapy water.
