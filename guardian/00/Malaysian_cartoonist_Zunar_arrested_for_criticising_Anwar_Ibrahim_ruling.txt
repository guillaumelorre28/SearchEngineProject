One of Malaysia’s best-known political cartoonists has been arrested for 
sedition over a Twitter posting that criticised the jailing of opposition leader
Anwar Ibrahim <https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-ibrahim>, the artist’s 
wife said Wednesday.


Zulkifli Anwar Ulhaque - better known as Zunar - was arrested Tuesday night, 
hours after Anwar was jailed for five years in a politically charged sodomy 
case.

“Of course this is a form of intimidation, with the purpose that society does 
not question the authorities,” his wife Fazlina Rosley told AFP.

“Zunar will not bow down to this intimidation. He will continue to criticise 
even if he remains in jail.”

The cartoonist’s lawyer Melissa Sasidaran said he is expected to be held for a 
few days.

Zunar, 52, had suggested in a Twitter post that Malaysia’s judiciary - whose 
independence has been questioned before in political cases - had bowed to the 
country’s authoritarian regime.

“Those in the black robes were proud when passing sentence. The rewards from 
their political masters must be lucrative,” the tweet had said.

Prime Minister Najib Razak’s government has been condemned at home and abroad 
for filing a wave of sedition cases against its opponents over the past year, 
apparently in response to the opposition’s growing electoral successes.

Tuesday’s Anwar ruling was also criticised by international human rights 
groups and the United States, which said it raised questions over the rule of 
law.

Anwar called the ruling a “political conspiracy” to run him out of politics.

Zunar has courted the attention of authorities in the past through his 
cartoons, which often take aim at Najib, his notoriously spendthrift wife 
Rosmah Mansor, and contentious issues such as Anwar’s sodomy trial.

Earlier this month, he said his office was raided by police as part of an 
apparently separate sedition investigation.

The country’s hardline police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said on Twitter Tuesday 
that authorities also would investigate two opposition politicians for sedition 
over tweets critical of the Anwar ruling.

Human Rights Watch, in a statement criticising Zunar’s arrest, said Najib’s 
government was “turning peaceful criticism into a criminal act that threatens 
the state.”
