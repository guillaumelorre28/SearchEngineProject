The Oscar-nominated actor and media mogul previously appeared in DuVernay’s 
drama Selma, about Martin Luther King, and the pair are collaborating on a new 
TV show, Queen Sugar.

A Wrinkle in Time, which has been in development at Disney for six years, is 
an adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s 1963 novel about a girl’s search for her 
scientist father in a mysterious fifth dimension. Frozen screenwriter and 
co-director Jennifer Lee will provide the script. Winfrey will play Mrs Which, 
a witch who helps the central character. Other roles are yet to be cast, but 
Amy Adams and Kevin Hart are rumoured to be in talks to co-star.

The project will be DuVernay’s first feature-length narrative film since her 
Oscar-nominated civil rights biopic in 2014. Her documentary The 13th, about 
how the legacy of slavery affects contemporary US society,was recently selected 
to open the New York film festival
