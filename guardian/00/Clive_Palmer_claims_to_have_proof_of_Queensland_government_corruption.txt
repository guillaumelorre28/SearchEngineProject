Mining magnate Clive Palmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/clive-palmer> used the occasion of 
the official declaration of his winning of a federal parliamentary seat to say 
he will produce proof that the Queensland state government is corrupt.

Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 more votes than his 
closest contender, the Liberal National party candidate Ted O'Brien.

The Australian Electoral Commission officially declared the victory on Friday 
after a recount and Palmer took the opportunity to put the boot into the state 
government.

He had declared them corrupt on Thursday night on ABC's 7.30 Report and at the 
victory declaration said theQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> government was 
favouring particular private companies and he had "direct evidence".

"We'll be revealing that information soon so people can see that," he said.

Palmer also praised the AEC workers who had spent the past two months counting 
and recounting the votes, despite being a vocal critic of the commission.

"Today is not about a celebration of a party, it's about a triumph of 
democracy," he said.

"The AEC plays a critical role in an important moment to protect the rights 
that we've all got as Australians."

Palmer said he would push for reform of the electoral system so voters would 
never again have to wait so long for a result â€“ it took almost two months after 
the election for Palmer to be declared the winner.

"Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting? The 
Electoral Act of 1918 may be different from the Electoral Act of 2014. It would 
be great if we could get the result on the night of election so that so many 
people wouldn't have to spend so long counting votes," he said.
