When I was about 11 my dad took me to see Arsenal vs Bolton and he got the 
players to sign my programme afterwards because he knew them from doing 
football songs. All my mates used to come round and completely trash my room 
back then so I decided to put it down in the cellar. I completely forgot about 
it until I went down there about six months ago and found it again. It was 
signed by the 93/94 squad - the double-winning squad. I've put it in a frame 
and it's up in my room now.

As a teenager I didn't have all that much stuff up on the walls, just some rap 
posters. When I got a bit older I thought it should look a bit more grown up so 
I've got a painting my mum's friend painted while she was in rehab and my 
Arselnal programme. I don't know if it's fooling anyone.

There's a couple of pictures I really love as well. There's one of me, Lily 
and my best mate Theo. We're all about three or four and my mum always says it 
shows how nothing's changed, we all look just the same - Lily's got her teeth 
really clenched and she looks like she's about to punch the photographer. 
There's another of me and my nan that I love, too. My nan had this water 
feature fountain thing in her garden and my mum's got this picture up in the 
lounge with my nan in the foreground doing her knitting and me in the 
background pissing in her fountain.
