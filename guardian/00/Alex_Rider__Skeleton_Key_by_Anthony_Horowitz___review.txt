Having read the first two books in the Alex Rider Series – Stormbreaker and 
Point Blanc – I was so gripped by the thrilling suspense and drama that I could 
not help but read the third book, Skeleton Key. If anyone else has read this, I 
am sure that they would agree with me that Horowitz catches the reader’s 
attention straight away and for those of you who have not read it, I would 
definitely recommend it.


 ‘Night came quickly to Skeleton Key’.

 I am sure that everyone would want to carry on reading this book after this 
beginning. However, even if the start does not appeal to you, I am sure that 
reading the rest of the book would be worthwhile.

This book is about a fourteen year old boy, named Alex Rider, who is a spy for 
MI6 and has to prevent a bomb exploding, which would kill lots of people. He 
finds himself in lots of trouble, escaping death on a few occasions. However, 
Alex has a job to fulfil. Can he accomplish it and save many innocent beings? 
Read the book to find out.

 I recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 because it is a very 
interesting, action packed book, which involves bombs, fire and shooting. I am 
certain that adults will also love this adventurous novel. I am looking forward 
to reading the rest of the series sometime soon.
