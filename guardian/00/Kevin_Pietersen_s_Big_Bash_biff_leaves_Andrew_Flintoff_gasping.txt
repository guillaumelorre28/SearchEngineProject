England outcast Kevin Pietersen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen> helped to set up a Super 
Over Big Bash win for Melbourne Stars in a thrilling match at the MCG. 
Pietersen hit his second half-century of the tournament as his team tied the 
match after chasing Sydney Sixers’ 150 for six.

James Faulkner then sealed victory with two sixes off Brett Lee as the Stars 
racked up 19 to overwhelm their visitors in overtime. Their second victory 
keeps them in the reckoning for a semi-final spot after Pietersen hit eight 
fours and a six in his 37-ball 50. The former England batsman Michael Lumb made 
80 for the Sixers.

Pietersen’s 54 left his former England team-mate Andrew Flintoff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-flintoff> gasping for superlatives in 
the commentary box and pondering the batsman’s split from the England set-up.

Flintoff said: “There will be people around the world watching and thinking 
‘He doesn’t even play for England – why, oh why?’” Pietersen lost his way a 
little after reaching his 50 with a boundary and was caught behind off a 
mis-pull at Doug Bollinger. Flintoff said: “He played well. But you’ve got to 
say he did half of his job here.” The Stars appeared to have wasted their 
chance until late hitting from Tom Triffitt and Faulkner tied the scores.

England’s selectors and management have made it abundantly clear that after 
the 34-year-old Pietersen’s controversial sacking 11 months ago he will never 
again figure in their plans.

They have picked their 15 for the World Cup which England begin against 
Australia in Melbourne on 14 February. The squad will be re-confirmed when all 
14 competing nations announce their final line-ups.
