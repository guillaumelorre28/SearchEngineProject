"I love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch. Here it goes down, down into my 
belly."

With that catchy chant, Ron Burgundy did more than establish his fondness for 
the drink of the gods; he also paved the way fora new flavour of ice cream

As a tie-in for the upcoming Anchorman sequel, The Legend Continues, ice cream 
giants Ben & Jerry's have developed a limited edition variety of the frozen 
dessert, to be named Scotchy Scotch Scotch.

The new flavour, which contains "butterscotch ice cream with ribbons of 
butterscotch swirl", instead of any actual alcohol, was unveiled at a launch in 
New York.

The launch also featured the waterskiing squirrel from the first Anchorman 
film.


It will be available from US stores, but there are no plans as yet to bring it 
to the UK.

If nothing else, the ice cream has Burgundy's own seal of approval. The news 
presenter was quoted as saying: "Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch is a delicious ice 
cream and I hope Ben and Jerry consider my other suggestions. Malt liquor 
marshmallow, well liquor bourbon peanut butter, and cheap white wine sherbet."

We have been warned.
