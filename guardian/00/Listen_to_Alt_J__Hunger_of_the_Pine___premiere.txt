Alt-J's career trajectory has been one filled with surprising successes. They 
won the Mercury prize forAn Awesome Wave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/dec/06/guardian-best-albums-2012-alt-j>
 in 2012, and sold a million copies of their debut album in a climate where 
brand new artists rarely do so. They even found time to becomeAaron Paul's best 
mates <https://twitter.com/alt_J/status/364162911553339395/photo/1>. But 
soundtracking a gigantic image ofMiley Cyrus nude save for some gaffer-taped 
nipples <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjWRyWWXGDg>? Well, that is something 
none of us could have predicted.

To reciprocate the love, Hunger of the Pine, Alt-J's first single from their 
second album, samples the lyric "I'm a female rebel" from the pop singer's track
4x4 feat. Nelly <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcp9AFwj2GE>, from her album 
Bangerz. Whether or not the band will show a projection of themselves pivoting 
nude while the original plays on their forthcoming tour is yet to be confirmed.

A momentous and shadowy return, the track is available to download and stream 
now. Alt-J's new album,This Is All Yours 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/10/alt-j-second-album-this-is-all-yours>
 will be released in the UK on 22 September via Infectious Music in CD, digital 
and double-vinyl editions.

â€¢ The Guardian Guide have an exclusive interview with the band about their 
"difficult" second album and hanging out withMiley Cyrus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus>. Coming in July.
