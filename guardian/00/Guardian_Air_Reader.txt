Kipcast, makers of Yippidu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/open-platform/guardian-yippidu-for-blackberry>, 
developed an Adobe Air Guardian Reader app.

"The GuardianReader has been developed to support the Guardian readers in 
their quest for effective and portable news browsing independently of the 
underling operating system. More and more readers/subscribers need to stay 
up-to-date on fast-changing information while on-the-go. However, quite often 
communications can be spotty and/or expensive. The GuardianReader overcomes 
those hurdles by quickly downloading online information and then letting 
readers delve into stories of their liking in offline mode. Based on Adobe Air 
Text Layout Framework renowned quality for readability and text formatting, the 
GuardianReader is a very pleasant e-reader of current events happening world 
wide thereby reducing the need for printing news."
