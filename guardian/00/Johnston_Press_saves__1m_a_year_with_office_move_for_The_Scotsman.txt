The Scotsman <https://www.theguardian.com/media/the-scotsman> is on the move 
again. After 15 years at Barclay House on Holyrood Road in Edinburgh, it is 
relocating, and also downsizing, to Orchard Brae House in Queensferry Road.

The Scotsman's move will save its owner, Johnston Press, a considerable sum, 
according to an article in the Sunday Herald.

 The rent of the new headquarters is estimated at around £555,000 a year as 
against the current £1.5m.

The Scotsman, along with its sister titles, Scotland on Sunday and the 
Edinburgh <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/edinburgh> Evening News, will occupy 
two floors in the refurbished building along with a string of Johnston's weekly 
papers.

Johnston Press's chief executive, Ashley Highfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield>, has been pursuing a 
rationalisation policy in order to cope with a debt burden of more than £300m.

In an illustration of the changing nature of media, the new tenants at Barclay 
House will be Rockstar North, the computer games company behind theGrand Theft 
Auto <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto> series.
