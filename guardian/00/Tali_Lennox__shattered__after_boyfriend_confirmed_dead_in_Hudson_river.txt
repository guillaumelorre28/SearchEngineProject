through this. I know that he is so so happy that I was safely rescued.”

Lennox, whose father is the record producer Uri Fruchtmann, continued: “I have 
eternal gratitude for experiencing a love from Ian that was so unbelievably

Dutchess county sheriff’s captain John Watterson said that a postmortem 
examination confirmed the body was that of Jones, 32. Watterson said the kayak 
overturned near historic Mills Mansion in Staatsburg, 75 miles north of New 
York City.

Police said the pair were not wearing lifejackets and that strong currents in 
the river are thought to have played a role in the capsizing.

Jones’s body was found near Poughkeepsie Yacht Club on 10 August, and his 
death is considered an accidental drowning.
