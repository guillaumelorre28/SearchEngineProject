It's been a quiet year for Anna Calvi, the kohl-eyed, guitar-wielding singer 
whose self-titled debut album took her fromCheap Hotel 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQluouOwug> frontwoman to solo star in her own 
right. It was during her time with Cheap Hotel that she met the Invisible's 
Dave Okumu at the Asylum club in London, and the pair have remained friends 
ever since. The Wall – premiered here – is Calvi's bluesy take on the highlight 
of the Invisible's excellentRispah <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwsadlOW5FE> 
album. Here she replaces the electronic throb and shimmering textures of the 
original with serrated guitar and distant drums. Calvi's sighs add to the 
tension before the drums take over and the whole thing explodes into life.

Rispah is out now via Ninja Tune.
