The only formula one race to be held at Donington Park was the European grand 
prix on April 11, 1993. The race was won byAyrton Senna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ayrton-senna> in his McLaren-Ford from 
fourth on the grid. Damon Hill finished second and his Williams-Renault 
team-mate Alain Prost, who started on pole, came third.

There were 14 retirements in the rain-lashed race and only two of the 11 
finishers completed the 76 laps. The Brazilian won in 1hr 50min 46.570sec and 
clocked the fastest lap of the race on lap 57: 1min 18.029sec.

Donington will be the fifth circuit used by the British grand prix which was 
first held at Brooklands in 1926 and 1927. It was not staged again until 1948 
at Silverstone which then alternated with first Aintree racecourse and then 
Brands Hatch before becoming the sole venue from 1987.

Thankfully, at Donington in 1993 the appalling weather and the fact that it 
was Easter weekend ensured that only around 25,000 fans braved the elements to 
savour the spectacle.

Everybody in the business was happy that the track's popular owner, Tom 
Wheatcroft, escaped with his shirt, but there was no question of his risking a 
financially ruinous repeat performance. The pits were cramped, the track was 
too short and too narrow by today's standards of safety and security.
