And the biggie ... best Australian film

And, breathe, we’re almost there. Cate and Debs are back on stage to lead into 
the final and biggest gong of the night: the award for best Australian film of 
2014.

And it goes to The Water Diviner. Cue a very jolly looking Russell Crowe live 
on video and an army of his creative team pouring onto stage. Crowe’s 
directorial debut, which was released on Boxing Day, made more money in two 
weeks than its nearest competitor did during the rest of the year.

Here’s our interview with Rusty from just before Christmas.

Oh, but what’s this? There’s a second award. Best film is tied (surely an 
oxymoron).

And the joint award goes to The Babadook!

It’s an unusual but not unprecedented turn of events. And it kind of feels 
right. A belated but well-deserved nod that thumbs its nose (hmm, mixed facial 
metaphors there) at the OTHER Academy over in LA and should help the growing 
cult fanbase for this tiny Aussie horror hit.

Then again ...
Luke Buckmaster (@lukebuckmaster) 
Last year the best "Australian" film at the #AACTAs 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/AACTAs?src=hash> was a Hollywood blockbuster that 
cost $200 million. This year there was no Best Film.

2015 <https://twitter.com/lukebuckmaster/status/560739765285183488> 
We’ll be getting all the reaction from Luke and you lot on Friday.

Best television drama

Goes to The Code, its fourth award of the night (and that’s not even including 
its two “luncheon” awards). So really, the big winner. When we wrote about the 
show last year, we suggested this political thriller was“set for a world stage” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/19/the-code-abc-shelley-birse-interview>
, having already been sold to multiple countries before even airing in 
Australia.

We’re not sure it made such a big splash when it actually did hit our screens, 
but this award suggests otherwise. Let us know what you made of it in the 
comments below.

Best lead actor in a film

The contenders are:

Russell Crowe in The Water Diviner.
David Gulpilil for Charlie’s Country.
Damon Herriman in The Little Death.
Guy Pearce in The Rover.

Aaaaand in perhaps the best decision of the night the award goes to David 
Gulpilil.
 David Gulpilil. Photograph: Don Arnold/WireImage 
Cannes recognised David’s extraordinary performance in Charlie’s Country and 
now, not before time, his own country has too. We’ll be running a full 
interview on the Guardian Australia site very soon, but David did tell us 
earlier how much this recognition would mean to him if he won.

This is a story of my people, he tells the press room, after his win.

Best reality TV and best performance in a TV comedy

The Voice beats Masterchef, The X Factor and its own baby, The Voice Kids, in 
the first category.

And actor Debra Lawrence beats her on-screen son and fellow nominee Josh 
Thomas in the second.

Enough with the child-beating. Call in social services.
AACTA (@AACTA) 
This is the first win of Debra's career, which began with an appearance on THE 
SULLIVANS in 1976! Congrats Debra#AACTAs

Best director of a feature film

Goes to Jennifer Kent. Her second award of the night after picking up best 
original screenplay. Hugely well deserved.

We think it might have been an oblique reference to best film nominee Tracks. 
A nice flashback for Mia Wasikowska there. Even if there’s no Adam Driver.

The point though was to award this much coveted telly gong.
So best light entertainment show in a contested category goes to...

Not really (and not even our joke, soz). It actually goes to Hamish and Andy’s 
Gap Year, South America.

Gap Yah.

 Two words I can’t even say seriously anymore. But well done Hamish and Andy.

Best television comedy

Those who thought this was a shoo-in for our pal Josh Thomas were wrong. The 
award goes to ABC’sUtopia. 

As its star Celia Pacquola said of this popular satire of government 
bureaucracy and the absurdity of infrastructure policy, “often, fact trumps 
fiction”.

The big winners? The Water Diviner and The Babadook for film, and The Code for 
its multiple awards in the telly categories.

Plenty more to celebrate and debate in the coming days. We’ll be back on 
Friday with the best quotes and pictures. Not to mentionour weekly film column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films> 
that sees Luke Buckmaster re-watching the cult classics of Australian cinema, 
week in week out, for your reading/viewing pleasure.

Aussie (film) rules okay. 
 
And, breathe, we’re almost there. Cate and Debs are back on stage to lead into 
the final and biggest gong of the night: the award for best Australian film of 
2014.

And it goes to The Water Diviner. Cue a very jolly looking Russell Crowe live 
on video and an army of his creative team pouring onto stage. Crowe’s 
directorial debut, which was released on Boxing Day, made more money in two 
weeks than its nearest competitor did during the rest of the year.

Here’s our interview with Rusty from just before Christmas.

Oh, but what’s this? There’s a second award. Best film is tied (surely an 
oxymoron).

And the joint award goes to The Babadook!

It’s an unusual but not unprecedented turn of events. And it kind of feels 
right. A belated but well-deserved nod that thumbs its nose (hmm, mixed facial 
metaphors there) at the OTHER Academy over in LA and should help the growing 
cult fanbase for this tiny Aussie horror hit.

Then again ...
Luke Buckmaster (@lukebuckmaster) 
Last year the best "Australian" film at the #AACTAs 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/AACTAs?src=hash> was a Hollywood blockbuster that 
cost $200 million. This year there was no Best Film.
 <https://twitter.com/lukebuckmaster/status/560739765285183488> January 29, 
2015 <https://twitter.com/lukebuckmaster/status/560739765285183488> 
We’ll be getting all the reaction from Luke and you lot on Friday.
 
Goes to The Code, its fourth award of the night (and that’s not even including 
its two “luncheon” awards). So really, the big winner. When we wrote about the 
show last year, we suggested this political thriller was“set for a world stage” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/19/the-code-abc-shelley-birse-interview>
, having already been sold to multiple countries before even airing in 
Australia.

We’re not sure it made such a big splash when it actually did hit our screens, 
but this award suggests otherwise. Let us know what you made of it in the 
comments below.
 
The contenders are:

Russell Crowe in The Water Diviner.
David Gulpilil for Charlie’s Country.
Damon Herriman in The Little Death.
Guy Pearce in The Rover.

Aaaaand in perhaps the best decision of the night the award goes to David 
Gulpilil.

Cannes recognised David’s extraordinary performance in Charlie’s Country and 
now, not before time, his own country has too. We’ll be running a full 
interview on the Guardian Australia site very soon, but David did tell us 
earlier how much this recognition would mean to him if he won.

This is a story of my people, he tells the press room, after his win.
 
Next presenters up are Kerry Packer and Roberta Williams, aka Lachy Hume and 
Kat Stewart.

And, just because, why not, cricketer and budding film star, Brett Lee, who we 
hobnobbed with earlier on the carpet.

But it’s all okay, because Josh wins this one, and for episode seven of the

 anoraks out there. Third season coming up soon, thank to US channel Pivot, who 
funded it.
 
The Voice beats Masterchef, The X Factor and its own baby, The Voice Kids, in 
the first category.

And actor Debra Lawrence beats her on-screen son and fellow nominee Josh 
Thomas in the second.

Enough with the child-beating. Call in social services.

This is the first win of Debra's career, which began with an appearance on THE 
SULLIVANS in 1976! Congrats Debra#AACTAs

Goes to Jennifer Kent. Her second award of the night after picking up best 
original screenplay. Hugely well deserved.

We think it might have been an oblique reference to best film nominee Tracks. 
A nice flashback for Mia Wasikowska there. Even if there’s no Adam Driver.

The point though was to award this much coveted telly gong.
So best light entertainment show in a contested category goes to...

Not really (and not even our joke, soz). It actually goes to Hamish and Andy’s 
Gap Year, South America.

Gap Yah.

 Two words I can’t even say seriously anymore. But well done Hamish and Andy.
 
First a Gosling. Now a camel (led in by Dan Wylie and Stephen Currie).

I repeat a camel.

Called Geoffrey.

Cue close-up of Geoffrey.

Me Out of Here

, which kicks off in Oz on Sunday.

This is taking quite the surrealist turn.
 
The Code (ABC) wins its third award of the night for best TV direction, after 
best actor and best supporting actress, making it one of the biggest successes 
so far.
 
Those who thought this was a shoo-in for our pal Josh Thomas were wrong. The 
award goes to ABC’sUtopia. 

As its star Celia Pacquola said of this popular satire of government 
bureaucracy and the absurdity of infrastructure policy, “often, fact trumps 
fiction”.
