Meryl Streep <https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep> and three other 
cast members of the film Suffragette have been the subject of criticism online, 
after appearing in a photo shoot last week wearing T-shirts featuring a 
controversial slogan.

“I’d rather be a rebel than a slave,” the slogan read, quoting a 1913 speech 
by women’s rights activist Emmeline Pankhurst. The photos were published in 
Time Out London alongside interviews with Streep, Carey Mulligan, Romola Garai 
andAnne-Marie Duff <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/anne-marie-duff>.

On Twitter, the photos inspired ire over the alleged racial insensitivity of 
the use of the quote, which for some carried connotations of the American 
history of slavery and Confederate rebellion. While someapplauded

 the use of the quote, others were less impressed.

“Meryl Streep has to know better. And if not, her publicist should have,” wrote
 <https://twitter.com/deray/status/651073916836933634> activist and organizer 
Deray McKesson.


Pankhurst’s full quote: “I know that women, once convinced that they are doing 
what is right, that their rebellion is just, will go on, no matter what the 
difficulties, no matter what the dangers, so long as there is a woman alive to 
hold up the flag of rebellion. I would rather be a rebel than a slave.”

According to Time Out 
<http://www.timeout.com/london/film/meryl-streep-and-the-stars-of-suffragette-on-feminism-family-and-fame>
, the quote used on the T-shirts encapsulates the “idea of finding your voice, 
keeping your nerve and fighting the impulse to be a ‘good girl’” – a powerful 
theme in the film.

In a statement 
<http://www.timeout.com/london/film/statement-response-t-shirt-complaints>, 
Time Out acknowledged it had invited the lead actors from the film to wear the 
t-shirts with the quote, and said the context of the photoshoot and the feature 
“were absolutely clear to readers who read the piece” when it was published 
last week.

“It has been read by at least half a million people in the UK and we have 
received no complaints,” the publication said.


“The original quote was intended to rouse women to stand up against oppression 
- it is a rallying cry, and absolutely not intended to criticise those who have 
no choice but to submit to oppression, or to reference the Confederacy, as some 
people who saw the quote and photo out of context have surmised.”


Others do not see it that way.


This is the second time in a week that Streep has come under a harsh 
spotlight. Streep, who portrays Pankhurst in the film,disappointed bloggers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/02/meryl-streep-on-feminist-question-im-a-humanist>
 by saying in the Time Out interview, when asked if she was a feminist: “I am a 
humanist, I am for nice, easy balance.”

The film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/05/suffragette-review-historical-drama-tub-thumps-hard-despite-having-your-vote>
, set for release in the US later this month, centers on the first members of 
the British women’s suffrage movement.
