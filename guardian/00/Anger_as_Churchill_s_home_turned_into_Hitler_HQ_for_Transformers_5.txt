The conversion of Winston Churchill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/30/winston-churchill-50th-anniversary-of-funeral-commemorated>
’s former home into the swastika-draped headquarters of Adolf Hitler for a 
Transformers movie has been denounced by veterans’ groups and former military 
commanders.

Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, has been reimagined as the 
headquarters of the Nazi leader in The Last Knight, the fifth Transformers 
film, which is currently shooting.

The set-dressing includes enormous swastika flags, a variety of German 
military equipment and SS stormtroopers filling the forecourt.

“I know it’s a film,” Col Richard Kemp, the former commander of British forces 
in Afghanistan, told the Sun. “But it’s symbolically disrespectful to 
Churchill. He will be turning in his grave.”

Churchill is buried around a mile away from the palace in Bladon. Tony Hayes, 
of Veterans Association UK, said he felt surviving ex-servicemen and women who 
fought in the second world war would be “appalled by this”.

The house, which is open to the public, is owned by a distant relative of 
Winston Churchill <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/winston-churchill>, Jamie 
Spencer-Churchill, the 12th duke of Marlborough.

The Last Knight, scheduled for release in June 2017, sees the return of Mark 
Wahlberg <https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-wahlberg> and Stanley Tucci to 
the franchise. They are joined byAnthony Hopkins
