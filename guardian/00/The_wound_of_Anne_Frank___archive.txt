The small town of Bergen is at the centre of a controversy over attempts by 
Social Democrat councillors to have a street renamed afterAnne Frank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/anne-frank-diary-archive-1952>, 
the Jewish child diarist who perished inBergen-Belsen

camp.

The plan, revived after the Social Democrats’ failure in 1982 to name a school 
afterAnne Frank <https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-frank>, looks likely to 
be foiled by the Christian Democrat majority on the town council, representing 
Bergen’s 13,000 inhabitants.

The leader of the Social Democratic group, Mr Wilhelm Hohls, said his party’s 
intention was to test the public mood after the visit to Belsen of President 
Reagan and Chancellor Kohl last May. Both men referred to the 15-year-old girl 
and her diary.

“We did not intend anything spectacular, we just wanted to show that the 
people of Bergen-Belsen live with their past, without attributing to them any 
special guilt,” Mr Hohls said.

His proposal has met opposition from the Christian Democrats, and principally 
from Mr Gunther Ernst, a Conservative councillor who has given ample space in a 
weekly advertising magazine he publishes to letters of complaint.

“The people of Bergen are fed up with shouldering an additional burden of 
guilt for what happened at Bergen-Belsen,” Mr Ernst said.

Among the views expressed in the letters were that the people of Bergen-Belsen 
did not want “to be left with the mark of Cain” or have a “daily reminder” of 
the horrors of the Nazi regime.

Belsen was liberated by British troops in April, 1945. More than 50,000 Soviet 
prisoners of war, and the same number of Jews and gypsies, died there, most of 
hunger and disease.

Mr Hohls said that the views published in the advertising magazine were not 
representative of the people of Bergen-Belsen, the majority of whom were 
indifferent to the issue. “Many people tell me they have nothing against 
renaming a street, but none want it to be the street they live in,” he said.

If the motion is defeated, as Mr Hohls expects, the Social Democrats, 
supported by the local church, will again ask for a school to be named after 
Anne Frank.
