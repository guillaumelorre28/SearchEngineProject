Goodnight!
 Jennifer Lopez Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images 
J-Lo thanks everyone for making her dreams come true. She was hardly even on 
screen in the end. She did a decent job, but on the whole compared to the 
genuine glitz of the Grammys and the manufactured drama of the MTV awards, this 
all felt a bit budget.

The Weeknd’s performance was great. Bieber was good too, as was Ariana Grande. 
Jared Leto’s speech was a real moment as was Celine Dion’s tribute. The snog 
and the Star Wars debacle were utter nonsense that should have been scraped at 
the rough draft stage though.

Spare a thought for Michael Cragg who’s been cramped up in a hangar in 90 
degree heat while he tries to get glimpses of the stars, many of whom didn’t 
bother with a press conference. He did get some Cheetos though, so every cloud 
and all that.

Here are some thoughts from Mr Cragg:

Go to the AMAs they said, rub shoulders with the rich and glamorous I assumed. 
But no, in a chilly tent me and some other ‘hacks’ sat on the floor with bags 
of Cheetos watching Jennifer Lopez’s own interpretation of Pan’s People, a 
weird nod to 1995 featuring Alanis Morissette and Demi Lovato prowling around a 
stage and an acappella group humming over an orchestra.

It’s hard to get excited about an Ariana Grande performance while a security 
guard keeps asking you to move aside so a prop can be stored in a cupboard.

Having said that overall it was an enjoyable if slightly unspectacular 
evening, with pop’s future megastars allowed to showcase their talents without 
the pesky powerhouses (Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor) getting in the way. Mind you, 
The Weeknd seemed to step up a level, whileJustin Bieber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber> did his usual slightly bored 
teenage routine to three gold-played mega-bangers.

I’d give the whole thing 5/10, and I’m not just bitter because nearly all my 
predictions were wrong.

Thanks for joining us and thrashing it out in the comments, and for the 
tweets. Here’s Edith Piaf’s Hymne à L’Amour to close things out in style. Adieu!

Here’s a short video on the making of Where Are U Now. It’s pretty impressive 
and explains where that weird “dolphin” sound comes from (it wasn’t an actual 
dolphin btw).

WINNER!

For the second year in a row it’s One Direction. They’re thanking their 
families and their record label, saying “Obviously we’re going on a little 
break - we’re going to spend time with our families and it’s going to be 
amazing.”

WINNER!

The Weeknd just won best soul/R&B male. It’s been his year - the second AMA 
he’s scooped of the evening too. He’s dominated the airwaves with Earned it, 
Can’t Feel My Face and The Hills, and his speech is short and sweet.

Here’s a full list of winners including the gongs they didn’t give out on the 
night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/22/american-music-awards-2015-the-winners-so-far>
. Taylor Swift actually won three, including two biggies – song of the year and 
album of the year.

J-Lo thanks everyone for making her dreams come true. She was hardly even on 
screen in the end. She did a decent job, but on the whole compared to the 
genuine glitz of the Grammys and the manufactured drama of the MTV awards, this 
all felt a bit budget.

The Weeknd’s performance was great. Bieber was good too, as was Ariana Grande. 
Jared Leto’s speech was a real moment as was Celine Dion’s tribute. The snog 
and the Star Wars debacle were utter nonsense that should have been scraped at 
the rough draft stage though.

Spare a thought for Michael Cragg who’s been cramped up in a hangar in 90 
degree heat while he tries to get glimpses of the stars, many of whom didn’t 
bother with a press conference. He did get some Cheetos though, so every cloud 
and all that.

Here are some thoughts from Mr Cragg:

Go to the AMAs they said, rub shoulders with the rich and glamorous I assumed. 
But no, in a chilly tent me and some other ‘hacks’ sat on the floor with bags 
of Cheetos watching Jennifer Lopez’s own interpretation of Pan’s People, a 
weird nod to 1995 featuring Alanis Morissette and Demi Lovato prowling around a 
stage and an acappella group humming over an orchestra.

It’s hard to get excited about an Ariana Grande performance while a security 
guard keeps asking you to move aside so a prop can be stored in a cupboard.

Having said that overall it was an enjoyable if slightly unspectacular 
evening, with pop’s future megastars allowed to showcase their talents without 
the pesky powerhouses (Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor) getting in the way. Mind you, 
The Weeknd seemed to step up a level, whileJustin Bieber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber> did his usual slightly bored 
teenage routine to three gold-played mega-bangers.

I’d give the whole thing 5/10, and I’m not just bitter because nearly all my 
predictions were wrong.

Thanks for joining us and thrashing it out in the comments, and for the 
tweets. Here’s Edith Piaf’s Hymne à L’Amour to close things out in style. Adieu!

break - we’re going to spend time with our families and it’s going to be 
amazing.”

The Weeknd just won best soul/R&B male. It’s been his year - the second AMA 
he’s scooped of the evening too. He’s dominated the airwaves with Earned it, 
Can’t Feel My Face and The Hills, and his speech is short and sweet.

Alex Needham’s one-word review: “terrible”. Let’s all move on.
 
Oh, there’s an orchestra and now they’re just playing the Star Wars theme with 
Pentatonix singing “lallalalalalalalala” over the top of it.
 
Ok, this is terrible. Worse than the snog. Worse than if the snog had never 
finished and that was the only thing my eyes could ever see again. Someone pull 
the plug
