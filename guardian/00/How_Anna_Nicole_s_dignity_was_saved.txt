To Los Angeles, where the late Anna Nicole Smith's lawyer wins a victory for 
dignity, making him one-for-three after failing to secure custody of her 
remains, and failing to have produced the sperm that fathered the 
gazillion-dollar heiress's daughter.

Still, Howard K Stern has used his powers for good and successfully blocked 
the sale of what can only be described as a somewhat specialist piece of 
memorabilia. Namely, a video of the breast enlargement operation the erstwhile 
Playmate underwent in 1994, and which was performed by a Texan surgeon who 
recently attempted to sell it to an LA-based souvenir dealer. Aren't people 
enchanting? One would assume it to be the type of product whose sale is 
traditionally preceded with the words: "For you, sir, I do have something at 
the back of the shop ... "

As for the future, it is to be hoped Howard will now turn his weirdo-avenger 
energies to eradicating every copy of a second film showing Anna Nicole's 
caesarean section - a fairly involved task following her decision to sell it to 
US TV show Entertainment Tonight, whose own way-more-unconscionable decision to 
broadcast it has ensured it lives on in the internet's least Elysian fields.
