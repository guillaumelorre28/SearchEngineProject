Cameron: report a step closer to the truth
 Prime Minister David Cameron Photograph: Justin Tallis/PA 
David Cameron said the report advances the search for truth about how MH17 was 
shot down.

In a statement the prime minister said: 

“We have always been clear that justice must be done for all of the victims of 
MH17 and today’s report brings us one step closer to establishing the truth. 
We, alongside our partners, will continue to send a clear message; those 
responsible for downing this plane will be held to account.”

Claudio Villaca-Vanetta, whose husband Glenn Thomas, from Blackpool, died on 
board MH17, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One:

“We had some of the answers we were looking for today, but by far not all of 
them.

“We now know for sure that Malaysia Airlines was allowed to fly there, and we 
know now that it was a bad decision byUkraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> to leave the airspace open and that 
by just raising the cruise height it was safe for commercial airliners. We know 
there was a missile which is manufactured in Russia only.

“Of course, this doesn’t tell us who did it, who is accountable for it. That 
is where we want to get now.”

Mr Villaca-Vanetta said victims’ families had been told their loved ones would 
have died instantly or very quickly. But he added: “Even if it was the 
estimated nine seconds for somebody to lose consciousness, it is still a lot of 
time. For most families of victims, including myself, we went through 
counselling and this was maybe the hardest point to accept - the cruelty and 
the violence on bodies.”

Rob Fredriksz, whose son Bryce was killed on the flight MH17 says that those 
on board felt and knew nothing when they died.

In case there is still any doubt that Buk missile was used to shoot down MH17, 
Julian Borger picks out a section from Annex X of the report - an analysis of 
the high-energy objects that hit the plane conducted by the Dutch National 
Aerospace Laboratory.

“Based upon the damage examination it is concluded that the impact damage on 
the wreckage of flight MH17 is caused by a warhead with various types of 
preformed fragments in the 6-14 mm size range, including one type with a bowtie 
shape detonating to the left of, and above, the cockpit.”

“The damage observed on the wreckage is not consistent with the damage caused 
by the warhead of an air-to-air missile in use in the region in amount of 
damage, type of damage and type of fragments. The high-energy object damage on 
the wreckage of flight MH17 is therefore not caused by an air-to-air missile.”

“Of the investigated warheads only the 9N314M contains the unique bowtie 
shaped fragments found in the wreckage. The damage observed on the wreckage in 
amount of damage, type of damage, boundary and impact angles of damage, number 
and density of hits, size of penetrations and bowtie fragments found in the 
wreckage, is consistent with the damage caused by the 9N314M warhead used in 
the 9M38 and 9M38M1 BUK surface-to-air missile.”

Julian Borger picks out more key passages from the report. 

Missile shrapnel found in debris

The investigators collected pieces apparently from a surface-to-air missile. 
“In order to not risk impeding the criminal investigation, the Dutch Safety 
Board has decided not to publish images of all of the recovered fragments,” it 
says, but it does show three parts: an engine nozzle, part of one of the four 
stabiliser fins and a data cable. The report says: “The shape and form of the 
parts recovered is consistent with a 9M38 series surface-to-air missile.”

As a reference, the report shows pictures of a 9M38M1 missile, but in the text 
it just refers to the missile involved more vaguely as a ‘9M38 series’ missile.

Metal fragments bound in the bodies of crew members 

120 objects (mostly metal graments) were found in the body of the First 
Officer, mostly in the left side of the upper torso.


More than 100 objects werre found in the body of the Purser. “Hundreds” of 
metal fragments were found in the fragmented body of the Captain

Explosive traces found

“Approximately 30 of the 126 swab samples showed traces of mainly two 
different explosives; the nitroamine RDX and the trinitrotoluene (TNT). A few 
of the 30 samples showed traces of PETN. On the tested missile part traces of 
RDX was found.”

Fragment analysis 

“72 fragments that were similar in size, mass and shape were further 
investigated”

“43 of the 72 fragments were found to be made of unalloyed steel and four of 
these fragments, although heavily deformed and damaged, had distinctive shapes; 
cubic and in the form of a bow-tie.”

Victim found with emergency oxygen mask 

“During the victim identification process in the Netherlands, one passenger 
was found with an emergency oxygen mask ... The strap was around the 
passenger’s neck and the mask was around the throat.”

Here’s a summary of the Dutch Safety Board account of the MH17 crash, and the 
reaction to its report.

The report discusses the difficulty in recovering the wreckage, writes Julian 
Borger. He picks out this passage:

“It should be noted that many pieces of the wreckage were not physically 
examined by the Dutch Safety Board until four months after the crash. During 
this period some parts were removed, therefore it was not possible to retrieve 
all wreckage pieces. Wherever possible, the photographs taken immediately after 
the crash were used in conjuction with the wreckage found.”

When investigators first arrived at the crash site, they photographed upper 
parts of the fuselage above the business class, which showed perforation and 
soot. But the report adds: “The upper parts of the fuselage above the business 
class were no longer present at the time of the recovery mission.”

The British Airline Pilots’ Association has called for clear No Fly Zone 
guidance to prevent a repeat of the MH17 tragedy.

Stephen Landells flight safety specialist at Balpa, said: 

“Pilots want to make every flight safe and comfortable for passengers and need 
cast-iron information to ensure where they are flying is safe. Passengers and 
pilots want an open and uniform level of safety, not one that is decided in 
secret and in different ways by airlines and countries.

 “The aviation community worldwide needs to work together to share 
information. We would like ICAO and the UN to use their influence to encourage 
all nation states to take advantage of this unique resource to ensure the 
safety of the travelling public worldwide.”

With that we are going to bring this blog to a close. 
 
Dutch investigators released this animation of what they conclude happened to 
flight MH17.
 
Cameron: report a step closer to the truth
 Prime Minister David Cameron Photograph: Justin Tallis/PA 
David Cameron said the report advances the search for truth about how MH17 was 
shot down.

In a statement the prime minister said: 

“We have always been clear that justice must be done for all of the victims of 
MH17 and today’s report brings us one step closer to establishing the truth. 
We, alongside our partners, will continue to send a clear message; those 
responsible for downing this plane will be held to account.”
 
Claudio Villaca-Vanetta, whose husband Glenn Thomas, from Blackpool, died on 
board MH17, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One:

“We had some of the answers we were looking for today, but by far not all of 
them.

“We now know for sure that Malaysia Airlines was allowed to fly there, and we 
know now that it was a bad decision byUkraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> to leave the airspace open and that 
by just raising the cruise height it was safe for commercial airliners. We know 
there was a missile which is manufactured in Russia only.

“Of course, this doesn’t tell us who did it, who is accountable for it. That 
is where we want to get now.”

Mr Villaca-Vanetta said victims’ families had been told their loved ones would 
have died instantly or very quickly. But he added: “Even if it was the 
estimated nine seconds for somebody to lose consciousness, it is still a lot of 
time. For most families of victims, including myself, we went through 
counselling and this was maybe the hardest point to accept - the cruelty and 
the violence on bodies.”

Rob Fredriksz, whose son Bryce was killed on the flight MH17 says that those 
on board felt and knew nothing when they died.
 
In case there is still any doubt that Buk missile was used to shoot down MH17, 
Julian Borger picks out a section from Annex X of the report - an analysis of 
the high-energy objects that hit the plane conducted by the Dutch National 
Aerospace Laboratory.

“Based upon the damage examination it is concluded that the impact damage on 
the wreckage of flight MH17 is caused by a warhead with various types of 
preformed fragments in the 6-14 mm size range, including one type with a bowtie 
shape detonating to the left of, and above, the cockpit.”

“The damage observed on the wreckage is not consistent with the damage caused 
by the warhead of an air-to-air missile in use in the region in amount of 
damage, type of damage and type of fragments. The high-energy object damage on 
the wreckage of flight MH17 is therefore not caused by an air-to-air missile.”

“Of the investigated warheads only the 9N314M contains the unique bowtie 
shaped fragments found in the wreckage. The damage observed on the wreckage in 
amount of damage, type of damage, boundary and impact angles of damage, number 
and density of hits, size of penetrations and bowtie fragments found in the 
wreckage, is consistent with the damage caused by the 9N314M warhead used in 
the 9M38 and 9M38M1 BUK surface-to-air missile.”
 Images from the final report into the investigation of MH17 crash which 
killed 298 people. Photograph: Dutch Safety Board/PA  
Julian Borger picks out more key passages from the report. 

Missile shrapnel found in debris

The investigators collected pieces apparently from a surface-to-air missile. 
“In order to not risk impeding the criminal investigation, the Dutch Safety 
Board has decided not to publish images of all of the recovered fragments,” it 
says, but it does show three parts: an engine nozzle, part of one of the four 
stabiliser fins and a data cable. The report says: “The shape and form of the 
parts recovered is consistent with a 9M38 series surface-to-air missile.”

As a reference, the report shows pictures of a 9M38M1 missile, but in the text 
it just refers to the missile involved more vaguely as a ‘9M38 series’ missile.

Metal fragments bound in the bodies of crew members 

120 objects (mostly metal graments) were found in the body of the First 
Officer, mostly in the left side of the upper torso.


More than 100 objects werre found in the body of the Purser. “Hundreds” of 
metal fragments were found in the fragmented body of the Captain

Explosive traces found

“Approximately 30 of the 126 swab samples showed traces of mainly two 
different explosives; the nitroamine RDX and the trinitrotoluene (TNT). A few 
of the 30 samples showed traces of PETN. On the tested missile part traces of 
RDX was found.”

Fragment analysis 

“72 fragments that were similar in size, mass and shape were further 
investigated”

“43 of the 72 fragments were found to be made of unalloyed steel and four of 
these fragments, although heavily deformed and damaged, had distinctive shapes; 
cubic and in the form of a bow-tie.”

Victim found with emergency oxygen mask 

“During the victim identification process in the Netherlands, one passenger 
was found with an emergency oxygen mask ... The strap was around the 
passenger’s neck and the mask was around the throat.”
 
Here’s a summary of the Dutch Safety Board account of the MH17 crash, and the 
reaction to its report.

 * The report concluded that MH17 was shot down by a Buk surface-to-air 
missile which exploded less than a metre from the cockpit. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/mh17-crash-report-plane-partially-reconstruced-blames-buk-missile-strike>
It said the front of the aircraft was destroyed by the missile, killing the 
three pilots instantly and causing the rest of the plane to break apart. 
 * Bow-tie shape fragments in the debris and traces of paint were crucial in 
determining the precise model of warhead involved.

The report named the missile used as a 9N314M warhead as carried on a 
9M38-series missile and launched by a Buk surface-to-air missile system.

 It said it had performed two experiments proves one of its missiles could not 
have been launched from areas under pro-Russia separatist control. 
 * Barry Sweeney, whose son Liam, was one of 10 British victims of the crash 
said he hoped all the passengers were killed as soon as the plane was hit.

He said: “We can’t be 100% sure [that nobody suffered on the flight] but we’ve 
got to sort of think that was the case.”

 * But the report found that some passengers could have been conscious after 
the missile hit.

 It said: “It could not be ascertained at which exact moment occupants died, 
but it is certain that the impact on the ground was not survivable.” 
 * The Russian government has challenged the finding that a Buk missile shot 
down the plane.

on those responsible to be “held to account”.

. A second criminal investigation by the Dutch prosecutor’s office, scheduled 
to conclude early in 2016, is expected to answer the most politically charged 
question: who shot down flight MH17?  
The report discusses the difficulty in recovering the wreckage, writes Julian 
Borger. He picks out this passage:

“It should be noted that many pieces of the wreckage were not physically 
examined by the Dutch Safety Board until four months after the crash. During 
this period some parts were removed, therefore it was not possible to retrieve 
all wreckage pieces. Wherever possible, the photographs taken immediately after 
the crash were used in conjuction with the wreckage found.”

When investigators first arrived at the crash site, they photographed upper 
parts of the fuselage above the business class, which showed perforation and 
soot. But the report adds: “The upper parts of the fuselage above the business 
class were no longer present at the time of the recovery mission.”

The British Airline Pilots’ Association has called for clear No Fly Zone 
guidance to prevent a repeat of the MH17 tragedy.

Stephen Landells flight safety specialist at Balpa, said: 

“Pilots want to make every flight safe and comfortable for passengers and need 
cast-iron information to ensure where they are flying is safe. Passengers and 
pilots want an open and uniform level of safety, not one that is decided in 
secret and in different ways by airlines and countries.

 “The aviation community worldwide needs to work together to share 
information. We would like ICAO and the UN to use their influence to encourage 
all nation states to take advantage of this unique resource to ensure the 
safety of the travelling public worldwide.”
