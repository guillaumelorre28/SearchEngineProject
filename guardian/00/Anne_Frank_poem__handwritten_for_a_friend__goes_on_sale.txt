A short poem by Anne Frank <https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-frank> 
written in Amsterdam in 1942 and autographed by the teenager is expected to 
fetch up to €50,000 (£44,000) at auction.

The handwritten eight-line poem was written in the “poezie album”, or 
friendship book, of the older sister of Frank’s classmate and best friend 
Jacqueline van Maarsen, according to Dutch auction houseBubb Kuyper

. The first four lines of the poem can be found in a 1938 periodical, but the 
next four are not traceable, said Bubb Kuyper, which has put a guide price of 
€30,000 to €50,000 on the poem.

“My sister (nicknamed Cricri) tore this page out of her poezie album and gave 
it to me around 1970,” writes Jacqueline van Maarsen in a letter accompanying 
the poem. “I know that my sister was not as attached to this verse from Anne to 
her as I am to the verse Anne addressed to me, and that is the reason that I am 
now putting it up for sale.”

Signed by Frank, the poem “is a typically edifying poem of the sort that was 
often written in poezie albums, exhorting the owner to do her best and be 
diligent at work, so that anyone who reproves her is answered in an honourable 
manner,” said the auction house.

The poem is dated 28 March 1942. By July that year, Anne’s parents would take 
the family into hiding in an annexe by Otto Frank’s office, where Anne would 
write the diary that would make her posthumously famous. The Frank family 
remained in hiding until 1944, when they were arrested and taken to Auschwitz. 
Anne died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in February 1945, at the age of 
15.
