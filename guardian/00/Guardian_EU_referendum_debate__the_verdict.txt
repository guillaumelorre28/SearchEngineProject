Key points

Anyone who thought the EU referendum campaign was going to be dull will have 
to revise their thinking after that event. It was lively and raucous, mostly in 
a good way. By comparison, the general election debates were rather turgid.

Project Fear was out in force – on both sides. On the Leave side, Ukip leader 
Nigel Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> – 
unsurprisingly – labelled the EU a “failing political project” and warned that 
remaining in the union would mean Turkey joining at some point in the future. 
The Tory MP Andrea Leadsom claimed the EU was imposing laws on the UK that were 
out of Britain’s control.

Remain campaigner Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats> said Brexit would lead 
to “considerably worse terms of trade” and Labour’s Alan Johnson said the 
French would tear up the deal that allows border checks at Calais if Britain 
left the EU.

Snap verdict - who won? 

Judging by the reception in the auditorium, no one. The people who came to 
listen seemed for the most part engaged and committed but, at no point, did one 
get a sense of minds being changed. At the end, when the Guardian’s political 
editor and chair of the event, Anushka Asthana, asked if anyone had been 
persuaded to rethink by what they had heard, hardly any hands went up.

Yet it is probably the Remain camp that has more to worry about from Thursday 
night at the London Palladium. Over the past three weeks, in speeches and 
interviews, David Cameron has made a calm and coherent case for remaining in 
the EU, while his opponents have fought for Brexit with turbo-charged press 
backing but a lot less consistency and discipline. Cameron has been winning the 
argument.

Farage started with a striking soundbite, about Britain being more than just 
“a star on somebody else’s flag” and then, time and again, he was able to press 
emotive buttons, for example on Turkey, onLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and the working class, on 
Eurocrats and even on Scotland (where he was withering about the prospect of it 
ever voting for independence with the oil price so low). He even managed to 
brush aside the perfectly sound argument about a Norway-style trade deal not 
being in the UK’s interest with a rather good riff about the delights of 
Scandinavia. If anyone on the platform was going to sway undecided voters, it 
was probably him.

In many ways it did turn out to be a Farage/Clegg rematch because the most 
effective opposition to Farage came from the former deputy prime minister. 
Clegg was sharp and punchy, and he had a terrific moment when he mocked Farage 
for what he had said about Barack Obama and Russia, and for his faith in 
conspiracy theories.

Johnson delivered at least one excellent put-down to Farage, too, when he 
ridiculed the idea that Ukip wanted to exclude EU migrants so that they could 
let in more Indians. But Clegg and Johnson were in reactive mode more often 
than not; Farage was setting the agenda.

Best lines

Farage says Norway is rich, happy and successful - and worth following.

How dreadful would be it be be like Norway, he asks. Rich and happy and 
successful?

Clegg denied the Sun’s story that the Queen backed Brexit at an event he 
attended five years ago, saying it was “ludicrous rubbish”.

A-grade, 24-carat bilge.

Farage calls Obama (who has suggested he wants the UK to remain in the EU) the 
“most anti-British president America has ever had”.

Leadsom then dismisses the view of “a couple” of Americans.

Clegg counters that by reminding her that she is talking about President 
Obama. He is not just “Joe Bloggs from Cleveland” and is worth hearing out. 
That gets the biggest cheer of the night.

Johnson says Farage is pessimistic about everything, until he talks about 
leaving the EU, when he turns into “Anne of Green Gables”. Under the EU, 
countries in the east have gone from “oligarchy to democracy”.

Leadsom says no one has a “crystal ball” and can predict what will happen 
under Brexit. But she insists that it is “perfectly possible to negotiate terms 
of exit” with time.

Snap Twitter verdict

Nick Clegg <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg> seemed to attract 
the most attention on Twitter. Seems people have missed him.
