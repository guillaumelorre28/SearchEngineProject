Alejandro González Iñárritu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu> has won the 
Oscar for best director for Birdman at the 87th Academy Awards. Iñárritu beat 
Boyhood director Richard Linklater, who had gone into the night a strongly 
fancied contender after taking both the Golden Globe and Bafta award in this 
category.

Collecting the award, Iñárritu said: “Ego loves competition, because for 
someone to win, someone has to lose. But the paradox is that true art can’t be 
compared, can’t be labelled, can’t be defeated. My work and the work of my 
fellow nominees will be judged only by time.”

Iñárritu’s film was a startling flight of fancy about a disillusioned 
superhero movie star called Riggan Thomson who tries to reignite his career by 
putting on a stage production of a collection of Raymond Carver short stories; 
it provided a showstopping role forMichael Keaton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-keaton>, whose own career has certain 
similarities to Thomson’s.

 The film team review Birdman 
This is Iñárritu’s first Oscar win, though he has previously been nominated in 
this category for his ensemble drama Babel in 2007. However, despite losing out 
to Linklater at the Globes and Bafta, Iñárritu scooped the DGA award for best 
director for Birdman, the most reliable Oscar bellwether. Iñárritu also becomes 
the second Mexican film-maker in a row to win the best director Oscar, after
Alfonso Cuarón <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron> triumphed last 
year for Gravity.

The Academy Awards are taking place at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles and 
are being hosted by Gone Girl star Neil Patrick Harris.
