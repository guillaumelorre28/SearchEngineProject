Sue Klebold: A Mother’s Reckoning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/14/mother-supposed-know-son-columbine-sue-klebold>


Sue Klebold is the mother of Dylan Klebold 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/12/columbine-massacre-killer-dylan-klebold-mother-sue-guilt>
, one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre. She lost her son and all 
she had believed to be true about him, and has spent 17 years trying to figure 
out what happened and why. Her writing this took vast courage: she hated the 
exposure, but felt she had a social responsibility to explain how these things 
happen. A theme in my work is how people take traumatic circumstances and turn 
them into occasions of dignity: this is an extraordinary study in that. I hope 
people will come away from it with a deeper understanding of what it means to 
immerse yourself in being a parent.

States of Mind 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/07/states-of-mind-tracing-edges-consciousness-review-wellcome-collection>


I saw this last week at the Wellcome Collection in London and I was astonished 
by the way it combines scientific material and art. What I felt was brave, 
given thatWellcome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/16/what-is-the-wellcome-trust>
 is a scientific institution, is that the show was unabashed about the fact we 
don’t know very much about what consciousness is at the scientific level. There 
are fabulous items that are eerie and haunting, like a weird installation with 
the character fromThe Cabinet of Dr Caligari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/28/the-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-film-review>
. I walked out of it wondering, what is my consciousness? What is the 
consciousness of the people I love? It was really a kind of existential 
exhibition.

Lacy Gallery, London <http://www.lacygallery.co.uk/>


My first serious boyfriend in 1986-87 got me some prints he had framed at this 
gallery. It’s a funny place that’s only open a few days a week, but they have 
the most amazing, odd old frames, and if you put your art in them it suddenly 
has an elegant patina of history. The right frame can do miracles. The people 
are incredibly specialised in what they do. I don’t know whether any of them 
talk much about other subjects when they’re not there. They know how to do 
frames that are not so showy they compete with the artwork, but have a certain 
elegant splendour that amplifies the artwork’s beauty.

 Brilliantly constructed: Dada Woof Papa Hot at the Lincoln Center in New York.

Dada Woof Papa Hot <http://www.lct.org/shows/dada-woof-papa-hot/>


This play at the Lincoln Center in New York is about a gay couple who have a 
child 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/20/gay-parenting-emma-brockes>
. I went with my husband and when we got home we had a big argument. There was 
so much we had both put aside in our experience of being gay parents that was 
so brilliantly delineated by the play that it was brought up to the surface. 
It’s about howbecoming a parent changes who you are 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/same-sex-parenting-good-gay-community>
, and for gay people, especially of my generation, there is a sense that I 
never planned on this, so even though it’s appealing in a lot of ways, it 
represents a gross disruption of everything that I expected to happen. The play 
spoke deeply to me, and was so brilliantly constructed, and in many places 
hilarious.

Paul A Young <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-a-young>


A friend stays in my house in London when I’m not here and sends me chocolates.
Paul A Young <http://www.paulayoung.co.uk/about-paul/>’s have become a driving 
obsession. Their billionaire’s shortbread is of almost indescribable 
deliciousness. Their chocolates are such weird flavours – salted caramel or a 
fruit called kalamansi – and I’ve learned not to avoid what sounds peculiar. 
The only way I seem to be able to keep going while I’m writing is to munch my 
way through boxes of chocolates. Whatever good writing I’ve done in the UK has 
been at least partly fuelled by those chocolates.

St George’s, Bloomsbury, London 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George's,_Bloomsbury>


When I first saw this I thought, it’s a nice church but it seems to be falling 
down. Then there was this gigantic conservation effort and I saw how Wren’s 
pupilHawksmoor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/sep/21/architecture.artsfeatures>
 understood architectural proportion. I could no more tell you how to get the 
right proportions to make a church beautiful than I can fly on my own wings in 
outer space, but there is a certain elegance to that building. I like the 
neoclassical facade and it’s got a stunning interior, with this huge 
chandelier. I’m not a person of enormous faith, but if I were, it’s a place I’d 
be happy to pray in. It somehow makes you feel calm and at peace. Whenever I’m 
feeling overwhelmed, I go and sit inside it.

Fiona Shaw’s Rape of Lucretia
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/07/the-rape-of-lucretia-review-fiona-shaw-glyndebourne>

I was very struck by this Glyndebourne production. My father’s an opera nut 
and my stepmother used to work at the Metropolitan Opera, so I had a lot of 
opera immersion. I like the grandness and pretention of it. In this production, 
the darkness of the piece is brought to the surface. It’s disturbing: you don’t 
go home singing the arias.Fiona Shaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/fiona-shaw> directed it as if it were a 
play. I don’t often leave an opera with a sense of its tremendous connection to 
reality, but I walked out of this trembling because it got so real and intimate.
