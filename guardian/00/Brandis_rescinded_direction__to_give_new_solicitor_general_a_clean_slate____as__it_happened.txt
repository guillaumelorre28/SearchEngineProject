Nighttime politics

Well that is it for this blog for what has been a very long and fascinating 
week. It stretched from the Senate referrals of One Nation senatorRod Culleton 
and former senatorBob Day on Monday to the election of Donald Trump. The times 
are a-changing.

This is what happened today:

 * George Brandis overturned his controversial legal direction regarding the 
solicitor general, almost three weeks after the former SG Justin Gleeson 
resigned over the consequential stoush. The Senate was going to overturn the 
direction anyway so the attorney general saved himself an embarrassing vote on 
the floor of the Senate.

 * Malcolm Turnbull had a conversation with Donald Trump. They talked 
alliances, their mutual business background and the US plans in the region. The 
government spent question time talking up the Australian-American relationship 
generally on trade, defence, border security and also accusing Bill Shorten of 
bad judgement for dissing the Donald’s views as “barking mad”.

 * Shorten suggested that Australia be the ally that American needs, not 
wants. He said we should not step away from our values, highlighting respect 
for women and rejecting prejudice.

 * Australia ratified the Paris agreement on climate change at the same time 
as Craig Kelly, the chair of its environment committee, said Paris was “cactus”.

 * Ethnic community groups are starting to come out and push back against 
plans in sections of the Coalition to amend 18C and D of the Racial 
Discrimination Act.

 * The migration bill for a lifetime ban of refugees from Manus and Nauru 
passed the house. Andrew Wilkie, Cathy McGowan and Adam Bandt tried to amend 
it, to no avail. Labor voted against it. The bill’s passage is not assured 
through the Senate.

Thanks for your company and to my brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and
 Gareth Hutchens. Mike Bowers is a legend. We now have a week off and then 
#politicslive will be back for the final sitting fortnight.


Good night.

Greens call for National Integrity Commission

The senate is debating a private members bill for a National Integrity 
commission. Greens senatorLee Rhiannon is speaking to a motion first moved by 
former Greens leaderChristine Milne in 201 
<http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Fbillhome%2Fs936%22>
3.

Establishes a National Integrity Commission as an independent statutory agency 
which will consist of the National Integrity Commissioner, the Law Enforcement 
Integrity Commissioner and the Independent Parliamentary Advisor and provide 
for:

 * the investigation and prevention of misconduct and corruption in all 
Commonwealth departments, agencies, and federal parliamentarians and their 
staff;

 * the investigation and prevention of corruption in the Australian Federal 
Police and the Australian Crime Commission;

 * and independent advice to ministers and parliamentarians on conduct, ethics 
and matters of proprietary.

 * Also provides for the establishment of a Parliamentary Joint Committee on 
the National Integrity Commission.

Labor has spoken against it so no chance.

Even though George Brandis has repealed the solicitor general legal direction, 
Senator Wong has given notice of a motion that would stop Brandis effectively 
reactivating his legal direction. It was just a mention at this stage.

November 21: First court date for Bob Day and Rod Culleton on Senate 
eligibility

Paul Karp

The president of the Senate, Stephen Parry, has just notified the Senate that 
the high court will first consider the eligibility of One Nation senatorRodney 
Culleton and former Family First senator Bob Day at a directions hearing on 21 
November.


Directions hearings just set out the way forward, rather than hearing 
substantive argument, which lends weight to reports the cases won’t be heard 
and decided for months.

George Brandis: new solicitor general should have a clean slate

Paul Karp

In Senate Question Time, the attorney general George Brandis has been asked 
about his decision on Thursdayto rescind his order giving him control over 
access to advice from the solicitor general 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/10/george-brandis-reverses-order-giving-him-control-over-solicitor-generals-advice>
.

Brandis said that he had rescinded the direction because acting solicitor 
generalTom Howe believed the new solicitor general “should be greeted with a 
clean slate”.

Brandis maintained the direction was a mere matter of “housekeeping” that did 
not change the process reflected in the Legal Officers Act.

The attorney general said the process for how the solicitor general is briefed 
would be discussed when the position is filled shortly.

Brandis denied the direction was made to target former solicitor general 
Justin Gleeson and said that it was Labor’s actions that had caused him to 
appear before the Senate committee and ultimately resign.

There was an interesting query from Joel Fitzgibbon at the end of question 
time. He wants to know, afterBarnaby Joyce had to correct Hansard in 2014, he 
never explained to the house why he had to correct the Hansard.

This relates to the breakdown of Joyce’s relationship with his head of 
department,Paul Grimes. Eventually Grimes was sacked and only recently we 
discovered that Grimes wrote suggesting thathe could no longer work with Joyce 
on matters of integrity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/24/barnaby-joyce-accused-of-sacking-department-head-for-challenging-his-integrity>
. Speaker Smith says there are many ways to raise the matter with him outside 
of this particular time.

Write me a letter, the Speaker says.

Barnaby Joyce gets a Dixer question on the backpacker tax.

There was a group that decided that it wasn’t the rate they wanted, and that 
was SenatorJacqui Lambie who became the leading economic liability of the 
AustralianLabor party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>. 
She proposed a different rate, a rate of 10.5%. The problem with 10.5% is it 
doesn’t create fairness, it creates a mechanism to attract foreign workers into 
Australia to take Australian jobs.

Labor’s Kate Ellis to Christopher Pyne, representing the education minister: 
The minister representing the minister for education has repeatedly claimed 
that the $1.84m grant to a college linked toBob Day went through the normal 
processes. Can the prime minister provide any other example where a college was 
awarded an amount which exceeded their entire annual revenue and will the prime 
minister now admit this grant was excessive?

Pyne says yes I can.

Dreyfus to Turnbull: I refer to the attorney general’s humiliating backflip on 
the legal services direction just before question time. Given this backflip 
follows the attorney general’s litany of scandals, including repeatedly 
misleading the parliament, appointing over a dozen Liberal cronies to jobs 
worth up to $370,000 a year, and claiming people have the right to be bigots, 
what does the attorney general have to do to be sacked?

Turnbull laughs at the question.

I’m not sure if there is anything in the standing orders about unhealthy 
obsessions or stalking ...

Turnbull says a new solicitor general will be appointed shortly and the 
attorney generalGeorge Brandis will consult with that person.

I wonder if that will be a consultation under the Oxford dictionary definition?

George Christensen to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, (triumphantly): 
Will the minister update the house on the importance of cooperation with the 
United States on border security, particularly in the wake of the stunning 
election of the courageousDonald J Trump as president of the USA?

The answer from Dutton is all about the information sharing around border 
security, including technological advances which have allowed the government to 
pick up 20 “persons of interest” in the asylum seekers applying from Syria.

Labor to Turnbull: Speaking about the US election this morning, Senator Ian 
Macdonald said about Queenslanders at the last election: “They also thought 
that in the member for Warringah they had someone they could relate to, and I 
think all those things did impact upon the result and did lead to a 
bigger-than-expected vote forPauline Hanson”. Does the prime minister think 
Queenslanders relate to the member for Warringah in a way they don’t relate to 
the current prime minister and his government?

Turnbull says there are plenty of commentators who can talk about that.

Paul Karp

As the government is turning up the rhetoric on the US-Australian alliance in 
the lower house, the Greens were questioning the very same alliance.

Greens senator Nick McKim tells the Senate Australians understand “we cannot 
automatically be best friends with the US under a Trump presidency”.


It is not business as usual anymore, this has been a seismic geopolitical 
event.

McKim rattles off Trump sins, including plans to undo the deal that froze 
Iran’s nuclear program, promising to commit war crimes such as extra-judicial 
killings in the Middle East, and starting a trade war with China.


We can no longer simply lock in behind the United States like a sycophantic 
little brother or sister. In the past, the cost of the unquestioning alliance 
with the US has been disastrous.

McKim cites the Vietnam and Iraq wars, the latter he says created the 
conditions for Islamic State (Daesh).

Well that is it for this blog for what has been a very long and fascinating 
week. It stretched from the Senate referrals of One Nation senatorRod Culleton 
and former senatorBob Day on Monday to the election of Donald Trump. The times 
are a-changing.

This is what happened today:

 * George Brandis overturned his controversial legal direction regarding the 
solicitor general, almost three weeks after the former SG Justin Gleeson 
resigned over the consequential stoush. The Senate was going to overturn the 
direction anyway so the attorney general saved himself an embarrassing vote on 
the floor of the Senate.

 * Malcolm Turnbull had a conversation with Donald Trump. They talked 
alliances, their mutual business background and the US plans in the region. The 
government spent question time talking up the Australian-American relationship 
generally on trade, defence, border security and also accusing Bill Shorten of 
bad judgement for dissing the Donald’s views as “barking mad”.

 * Shorten suggested that Australia be the ally that American needs, not 
wants. He said we should not step away from our values, highlighting respect 
for women and rejecting prejudice.

 * Australia ratified the Paris agreement on climate change at the same time 
as Craig Kelly, the chair of its environment committee, said Paris was “cactus”.

 * Ethnic community groups are starting to come out and push back against 
plans in sections of the Coalition to amend 18C and D of the Racial 
Discrimination Act.

 * The migration bill for a lifetime ban of refugees from Manus and Nauru 
passed the house. Andrew Wilkie, Cathy McGowan and Adam Bandt tried to amend 
it, to no avail. Labor voted against it. The bill’s passage is not assured 
through the Senate.

Thanks for your company and to my brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and
 Gareth Hutchens. Mike Bowers is a legend. We now have a week off and then 
#politicslive will be back for the final sitting fortnight.


Good night.
 
The senate is debating a private members bill for a National Integrity 
commission. Greens senatorLee Rhiannon is speaking to a motion first moved by 
former Greens leaderChristine Milne in 201 
<http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Fbillhome%2Fs936%22>
3.

Establishes a National Integrity Commission as an independent statutory agency 
which will consist of the National Integrity Commissioner, the Law Enforcement 
Integrity Commissioner and the Independent Parliamentary Advisor and provide 
for:

 * the investigation and prevention of misconduct and corruption in all 
Commonwealth departments, agencies, and federal parliamentarians and their 
staff;

 * the investigation and prevention of corruption in the Australian Federal 
Police and the Australian Crime Commission;

 * and independent advice to ministers and parliamentarians on conduct, ethics 
and matters of proprietary.

 * Also provides for the establishment of a Parliamentary Joint Committee on 
the National Integrity Commission.

Labor has spoken against it so no chance.

Even though George Brandis has repealed the solicitor general legal direction, 
Senator Wong has given notice of a motion that would stop Brandis effectively 
reactivating his legal direction. It was just a mention at this stage.
 
The president of the Senate, Stephen Parry, has just notified the Senate that 
the high court will first consider the eligibility of One Nation senatorRodney 
Culleton and former Family First senator Bob Day at a directions hearing on 21 
November.


Directions hearings just set out the way forward, rather than hearing 
substantive argument, which lends weight to reports the cases won’t be heard 
and decided for months.

Facebook.

In Senate Question Time, the attorney general George Brandis has been asked 
about his decision on Thursdayto rescind his order giving him control over 
access to advice from the solicitor general 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/10/george-brandis-reverses-order-giving-him-control-over-solicitor-generals-advice>
.

Brandis said that he had rescinded the direction because acting solicitor 
generalTom Howe believed the new solicitor general “should be greeted with a 
clean slate”.

Brandis maintained the direction was a mere matter of “housekeeping” that did 
not change the process reflected in the Legal Officers Act.

The attorney general said the process for how the solicitor general is briefed 
would be discussed when the position is filled shortly.

Brandis denied the direction was made to target former solicitor general 
Justin Gleeson and said that it was Labor’s actions that had caused him to 
appear before the Senate committee and ultimately resign.

There was an interesting query from Joel Fitzgibbon at the end of question 
time. He wants to know, afterBarnaby Joyce had to correct Hansard in 2014, he 
never explained to the house why he had to correct the Hansard.

This relates to the breakdown of Joyce’s relationship with his head of 
department,Paul Grimes. Eventually Grimes was sacked and only recently we 
discovered that Grimes wrote suggesting thathe could no longer work with Joyce 
on matters of integrity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/24/barnaby-joyce-accused-of-sacking-department-head-for-challenging-his-integrity>
. Speaker Smith says there are many ways to raise the matter with him outside 
of this particular time.

Write me a letter, the Speaker says. 
 
Barnaby Joyce gets a Dixer question on the backpacker tax.

There was a group that decided that it wasn’t the rate they wanted, and that 
was SenatorJacqui Lambie who became the leading economic liability of the 
AustralianLabor party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>. 
She proposed a different rate, a rate of 10.5%. The problem with 10.5% is it 
doesn’t create fairness, it creates a mechanism to attract foreign workers into 
Australia to take Australian jobs.
 
Hmmmm.

Labor’s Kate Ellis to Christopher Pyne, representing the education minister: 
The minister representing the minister for education has repeatedly claimed 
that the $1.84m grant to a college linked toBob Day went through the normal 
processes. Can the prime minister provide any other example where a college was 
awarded an amount which exceeded their entire annual revenue and will the prime 
minister now admit this grant was excessive?

Pyne says yes I can.

More American cooperation questions.

We love Americans.
 
Dreyfus to Turnbull: I refer to the attorney general’s humiliating backflip on 
the legal services direction just before question time. Given this backflip 
follows the attorney general’s litany of scandals, including repeatedly 
misleading the parliament, appointing over a dozen Liberal cronies to jobs 
worth up to $370,000 a year, and claiming people have the right to be bigots, 
what does the attorney general have to do to be sacked?

Turnbull laughs at the question.

I’m not sure if there is anything in the standing orders about unhealthy 
obsessions or stalking ...

Turnbull says a new solicitor general will be appointed shortly and the 
attorney generalGeorge Brandis will consult with that person.

I wonder if that will be a consultation under the Oxford dictionary definition?
 
George Christensen to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, (triumphantly): 
Will the minister update the house on the importance of cooperation with the 
United States on border security, particularly in the wake of the stunning 
election of the courageousDonald J Trump as president of the USA?

The answer from Dutton is all about the information sharing around border 
security, including technological advances which have allowed the government to 
pick up 20 “persons of interest” in the asylum seekers applying from Syria.
 
Labor to Turnbull: Speaking about the US election this morning, Senator Ian 
Macdonald said about Queenslanders at the last election: “They also thought 
that in the member for Warringah they had someone they could relate to, and I 
think all those things did impact upon the result and did lead to a 
bigger-than-expected vote forPauline Hanson”. Does the prime minister think 
Queenslanders relate to the member for Warringah in a way they don’t relate to 
the current prime minister and his government?

Turnbull says there are plenty of commentators who can talk about that.
 
As the government is turning up the rhetoric on the US-Australian alliance in 
the lower house, the Greens were questioning the very same alliance.

Greens senator Nick McKim tells the Senate Australians understand “we cannot 
automatically be best friends with the US under a Trump presidency”.


It is not business as usual anymore, this has been a seismic geopolitical 
event.

McKim rattles off Trump sins, including plans to undo the deal that froze 
Iran’s nuclear program, promising to commit war crimes such as extra-judicial 
killings in the Middle East, and starting a trade war with China.


We can no longer simply lock in behind the United States like a sycophantic 
little brother or sister. In the past, the cost of the unquestioning alliance 
with the US has been disastrous.

McKim cites the Vietnam and Iraq wars, the latter he says created the 
conditions for Islamic State (Daesh).
