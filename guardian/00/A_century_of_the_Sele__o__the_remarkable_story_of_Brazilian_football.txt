Chapter One: Exeter City?


From the weathered stands at St James' Park in Exeter, the song is sung with 
great pride: 'Have you ever, have you ever, have you ever played Brazil?' It's 
a chant which is typically greeted with bemusement by traveling supporters 
oblivious to its significance. That a success-starved club in the fourth tier 
of English football would pose such a question must seem ridiculous. It's not 
as ifExeter City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/exetercityfc> have ever 
played Brazil, have they?﻿

Chapter One of our series tells the curious tale of a game staged in front of 
3,000 spectators at Laranjeiras stadium in Rio de Janeiro on 21 July, 1914 ... 
a game in which two goals were scored and much blood was shed ... a game which 
would kick-start Brazilian international football and precipitate unparalleled 
success for the Seleção.

Chapter Two: Maracanazo


When Moacir Barbosa Nascimento lit his barbecue, he hoped to incinerate all 
memories of what had happened thirteen years prior. The wooden goalposts from 
Maracanã stadium were his chosen fuel, but even as he watched them burn he knew 
redemption would forever escape him. Barbosa had been the goalkeeper for Brazil 
against Uruguay in what was, in all but name, theWorld Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> final of 1950. Brazil 
had needed only a draw in their final pool match to claim the Jules Rimet 
trophy on home soil. They were the overwhelming favourites and 200,000 people 
flocked to the stadium in Rio de Janeiro expecting to see them triumph.

Chapter Two of our series tells a story which has haunted Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil> for the past 64 years. The 
national team may have won five World Cups in the years that have followed, but 
the nation will never forget the events of 16 July, 1950.

Chapter Three: Little canary

Imagine the Brazilian football team turning out for this summer's World Cup 
dressed in white. It may seem absurd, but those were in fact Brazil's original 
colours. It wasn't until 1953 that Aldyr Garcia Schlee designed the now famous 
yellow football kit as part of a national competition held in the wake of 
Brazil's 1950World Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football>
 defeat to Uruguay. His simple design beat submissions from 300 other entrants.

Chapter Three of our series examines why Canarinho – 'little canary' – as the 
kit is known, is almost universally adored. Its evolution through the decades 
has seen many highs and a few lows, yet it remains a symbol of design and 
sporting excellence – a proud emblem of Brazilian culture. How ironic, then, 
that Schlee was a passionateUruguay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uruguay> fan.

Chapter Four: Joga bonito

Nine slick passes from back to front, a slaloming run, that gloriously 
insouciant lay-off and an unstoppable shot with the outside of a right boot;
Brazil's unforgettable team goal scored by Carlos Alberto against Italy in the 
World Cup final of 1970 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrjevD2vhk> has been 
lauded as one the greatest goals in World Cup history, if not the greatest goal 
ever scored. It is the epitome of joga bonito – the art of playing beautifully.

Part Four of our series explores the defining characteristics of Brazilian 
football. What is so special about Brazilian footballers? And can the current 
Seleção squad play with freedom and swagger despite the burden of expectation 
at this summer's World Cup?
