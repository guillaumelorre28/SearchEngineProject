"We are very proud of our malaria projects," says Dr Henry Narh Nagai, in FHI 
360's offices in Accra, Ghana's capital. "The future is bright. There is a lot 
of good work going on in Ghana with support of both public and private sector 
organisations."

FHI 360 has been running two malaria programmes, the Mobilize Against Malaria 
(Mam) project, in conjunction with Pfizer, and the GlaxoSmithKline Community 
Malaria Project. These projects have been designed to work within Ghana's 
National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP).

"Malaria is a complex problem," he says. "That is why we need to complement 
what the NMCP is doing and work alongside it with our international partners. 
We need to have a multifaceted approach to reducing the burden of malaria.

"FHI 360 looks to identify the areas where we can have a positive impact and 
make a difference in a most cost-efficient manner. Our two projects are doing 
that."

The main focus of both of the FHI 360 projects is prevention and early 
treatment. Realising that malaria is a curable disease, if treated correctly 
and quickly, they have created a network through which to distribute the 
medication.

To do this they have formed partnerships within the Ghana health service and 
with other NGOs. Although, the current projects focus on treating malaria, it 
is hoped that the same distribution network and partnerships can be used to 
target other diseases in the future.
