Anne Karpf says she feels confused and helpless in the face of climate change (
You can't ignore this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/30/climate-change-you-cant-ignore-it>
, 1 December), and seems inclined to blame herself for this. But in a week when 
we have yet another apocalyptic warning about unsustainability (World 'on 
collision course with nature', OECD green growth report warns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/dec/04/world-collision-nature-oecd-green-growth>
, 4 December), while the chancellor gets set to authorise up to 40 more 
gas-fired power stations (Osborne's gas plan will harm economy, says energy 
adviser 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/04/gas-strategy-plan-z-climate-adviser>
, 5 December), who could reasonably be blamed for feeling confused and/or 
powerless?

Meanwhile the international climate change talks meander pointlessly on, 
radiating an eerie feeling that their processes were actually designed to 
achieve stasis. Even this paper's green guru George Monbiot has despaired (Now 
we know. Governments have given up on the planet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/rio-governments-will-not-save-planet>
, 26 June). Worse still, the only coherent mechanism for addressing the problem 
– contraction and convergence – remains mostly shunned by the powers that be 
and reviled by the major environmental non-governmental organisations. It's too 
late now, anyway. Confused? Understandably. Powerless? Undeniably.

• Your article on the chancellor's gas strategy is right to highlight the 
risks to the UK's carbon targets resulting from his plans for gas expansion. 
However, there is another option to the scenario presented by Damian 
Carrington. The expansion of "green gas" would allow the chancellor to align 
his plans for gas expansion without becoming dependent on expensive, 
subsidised, controversial and unproven shale gas exploration or on foreign gas 
for our energy security.

There may be a need for gas, in preference to coal, in our energy mix but this 
does not have to come from expensive fossil fuels. Substitute natural gas can 
be created directly from abundant commercial and municipal waste and other 
biomass sources for injection into the national grid. This is a viable, 
efficient and green alternative.
