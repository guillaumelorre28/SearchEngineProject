Nighty night

Yes people, that’s enough.

Let’s take stock of Monday with a parting summary that’s wider than today, in 
the spirit of where are we at the campaign midpoint?

 * The Coalition is clearly having trouble landing the core “jobs and growth” 
message. The budget message has been wound back progressively to focus on the 
tax cut as a small business measure, not a tax cut for big companies. 
Economists have also picked apart the benefits of the policy to the point where 
it must now be clear to anyone paying attention that the budget roadmap is a 
distance short of a magic bullet.Malcolm Turnbull is also starting to go to 
work on his negatives. A new advertisement featuring the prime minister talking 
about his upbringing and his father (the personal being political) is clearly 
designed to create a connection between the voters and the candidate, which 
suggests there may be trouble on that front. Given how presidential the 
Coalition campaign is, given all the Coalition eggs are in the Turnbull basket, 
it is a problem, potentially, if the voters are feeling disconnected from the 
candidate. The Coalition can’t exactly revert to a team campaign from here, 
this play has got to work, or they all sink.

 * Labor is just chugging along with its game plan, which has been to contrast 
its social capital and inclusive growth agenda with the Coalition’s trickle 
down proposal. It’s been steady-as-she-goes, there’s been no significant 
repositioning, or recalibration of the messaging, and the polls (as well as 
some of the factors I’ve outlined above) suggest we have a genuine contest.Bill 
Shorten looks relaxed, and his communication is mostly effective. But things 
are going to get tougher from here. Labor remains weak on costings and 
spending, and I think it’s risky to launch big spending initiatives without a 
very clear sense of the specific savings that will pay for the policies. Small 
tells like a childcare policy that isn’t means tested suggests there’s not 
enough internal discipline, that election spending imperatives are crowding out 
the budget imperatives. And how about jobs and the economy? This territory does 
need to be occupied at some point.

But, we are only at the half way point. All things liable to change without 
notice.

Thanks for your company today, I’ll be back, doing it all again, tomorrow.

GetUp! has referred the LNP backbencher George Christensen to the Australian 
Electoral Commission for seeking to giveLibby Barge of Eco Barge Turtle 
Sanctuary $12,000 “personal contribution” if he’s re-elected. The activist 
group says in a press release issued this afternoon that Christensen, in a 
Facebook post, says he will provide a “$12,000 personal contribution” toLibby 
Barge of Eco Barge Turtle Sanctuary – but only if he is re-elected. GetUp! 
national directorPaul Oosting contends this sort of proposition is “against the 
laws and conventions of our democracy. He’s got serious questions to answer”.

The shadow education minister, Kate Ellis, is being pressed on Sky News about 
how Labor will fund its childcare policy.

Kate Ellis:

The way we fund it is to make it a priority and find savings elsewhere.

Ellis says Labor will save more than it spends over the cycle. Is this over 
four years or over 10 years, Sky political editorDavid Speers, wonders? Ellis 
says the shadow treasurer,Chris Bowen, will make the announcements at the 
appropriate time.

Speers asks Ellis whether it is OK for Bill Shorten to characterise childcare 
as a responsibility that falls on women. Ellis says the Labor leader is just 
talking about reality. The evidence is clear, she says, that women do the 
majority of unpaid work in this country.

But what if Tony Abbott had said that, would Labor be sanguine? Ellis says 
Shorten is not saying that it’s right orthe way it should be, just that it’s 
the current reality. A better childcare system would make it less of a reality, 
she says.

I do love the idea of the two campaign planes snarling at each other on the 
tarmac.Malcolm Turnbull was due to go to Tasmania this afternoon, but the bad 
weather has apparently scotched that.
 Snarling at one another. @turnbullmalcolm

It was quite funny though, how Malcolm Turnbull corrected himself when he 
thought he’d gone in too deep on fathers. Mothers, great. Engineers, great, 
kiddies, great, everyone – great. If you don’t do that, you wake up lathered in 
a fresh moral panic about some key demographic disdained – like all the faux 
outrage today aboutBill Shorten being a Jurassic creature who thinks only women 
are responsible for childcare (despite the fact he’s produced a policy which is 
clearly intended to help women work more). God, campaigns, excruciating.

The personal is political
 The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at a press conference in Melbourne on 
Monday where he emotionally described his father and what he meant to him.

Malcolm Turnbull’s self-identification as a feminist this afternoon gives me 
the organising idea to work through what I need to work through with the prime 
minister’s statement about his father in the press conference just then: let’s 
grab the catchcry of second-wave feminists,the personal is political.

Let’s do this step by step.

Overnight (as has been referenced several times today), the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> campaign has produced an 
advertisement which featuresMalcolm Turnbull talking about his father. The 
purpose of this conversation with voters is obvious. The campaign needs to 
counter perceptions about the candidate being removed from the life experience 
of ordinary Australian voters. What better way to counter that perception than 
with a testimonial about your lived experience, and by producing a lived 
experience common to a lot of people who have been through the visceral trauma 
of parental separation. Anyone who has lived through a similar experience 
immediately understands what Turnbull is talking about, empathy with that case 
study is immediate – it cuts across gender, social class and economic 
circumstances. Even if you haven’t been through that, there’s an element of 
“there but for the grace of God go I”.

Personal stories are powerful, that’s why modern politicians trade in them.

So let’s come now to where the campaign objective (humanising Malcolm) meets 
the personal.Malcolm Turnbull can deliver this version of himself because it’s 
real. The loss he still carries floats to the surface entirely organically. 
This is a foundational story for this man, who also happens to be a politician 
and, currently, the prime minister. He dives deep into the story to tell it – 
you saw it just then. It’s not a campaign conceit, it’s core to his personal 
mythology. That’s why it has currency, it’s a kernel of real in an ocean of 
tactics and strategy.


It’s a bit like where I started this morning. I mentioned there’s an overlay 
of nostalgia in Turnbull’s framing and styling: he needs that sense of 
continuity to take the edge off his aggressive modernity, lest he get typecast 
as the tech guy, or the venture capital guy, or the let markets rip guy – he’s 
creating something more timeless in the way he’s presenting himself. It’s also 
part of the Coalition’s stability pitch, the “let’s reduce the chaos and 
turnover in Canberra” pitch, being the person who projects to voters as calm, 
and prime ministerial. The affect is deliberate. It’s not an accident.

It boils down to a simple proposition. Election campaigns for candidates are a 
process of reducing your negatives. The higher the negatives get, the harder it 
is for you to be elected. If you have a negative (and Turnbull’s negatives are 
pretty obvious), best get about reducing them.

Quite fascinating in it’s way, this. All the turning on the head of a pin, and 
the pulses of human emotion in the middle of the choreography.

As I said, fathers rock, mothers are great, engineers are great, girls can do 
anything.

Q: I asked before about the Sky News people’s forum with the ‘Courier-Mail’. 
Will you go to that on Wednesday and Mr Shorten said that it would be offensive 
to Queenslanders if you don’t?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I’m sure he did. Look, we are actually - we are having some -we are looking at 
some alternatives and what I’m hoping to do is to have a debate that is a bit 
different, that is - that involves Facebook and that involves a larger 
audience, and that is more engaging. So, I can assure you, I enjoy debating and 
I want to reach as many people as I possibly can in the debate because we have 
a great story to tell.

Our national economic plan is vitally important for our nation’s future, and I 
want to have the opportunity to explain it and take questions on it for as many 
people as possible. So we’re looking at some so we are looking at how we can 
achieve wider and greater reach for the debate.

If that’s all, thank you very much for being here. As I said, fathers rock, 
mothers are great, engineers are great, girls can do anything.

See you.

Fathers rock, and so do the mothers ..

Q: Mr Turnbull, could I just ask you about the video your campaign released 
last night, your reflections on your relationship with your father and your 
upbringing. Why was it important to release that? Was that to counter 
misconceptions?

Malcolm Turnbull:

It’s important to honour your parents Mark. It is important to honour your 
father. I was - I was brought up by my father. He ... He taught me so many 
things, some of them I talked about in that video. He taught me how to cook, 
not with great talent, I hasten to add, but competently. He taught me how to 
iron competently. I’ve been given high marks by Mrs Turnbull on that score. And 
he taught me respect and loyalty. Well, as I said, I would not be the man I am 
today without him. He was a great – you know, the most – there are many 
remarkable things about my dad, but I tell you one thing that was in some ways 
the most remarkable. When my mother left us, we had nowhere to live and Dad 
rented a flat and didn’t have any furniture. I think the only bit of furniture 
we had left was my bed, so it wasn’t – he had every reason to be a bit unhappy, 
to say the least.

And yet he never ever said a bad word about her. You think about, you know – 
you think about how rare that is. He never uttered a critical word of my mother 
in all of those years. And when he died and then – he was killed young, he was 
killed in an aeroplane crash when he was 56 ... I had both of their sets of 
correspondence and I could read the letters that Bruce wrote to my mother, the 
letters this he were filled with sadness and reproach and, you know, how could 
you do this, why did you do that, and the back and forth. I literally have the 
two sides of the correspondence. And I thought: “What does it say about a man? 
What does it say about his love that he could sit down and write letters like 
that, pouring out his heart and then turn to his little boy and say, your 
mother is the greatest woman in the world and she loves you more than anything.”

What a man. What a great man. So, fathers, fathers rock. There you go. Fathers 
rock. And so do the mothers, too.

Are there any other questions?

A reporter notes the prime minister flagged changes to the Fair Work Act over 
the weekend. What exactly would they be?

(I gave you that quote a couple from Turnbull a couple of posts back).

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, as you know, under the Fair Work Act there are a number of - there is a 
list of what are called objectionable clauses in EBAs, in industrial 
agreements, and what we would do - what we propose to do is to include into 
that list of objectionable clauses ones which would have the impact ... have an 
adverse impact on volunteer organisations such as the CFA.

Turnbull goes on to reference the floods over the weekend: Bill Shorten has to 
decide whether he is on the side of theheroes of the emergency services 
brigades or whether he’s on the side of the trade unions. They aren’t heroes in 
this calculation.

A question about union governance, which gives the prime minister an 
opportunity to reference the Country Fire Authority dispute in Victoria. And 
infernos.

Malcolm Turnbull:

You’ve seen the extraordinary events here in Victoria where you would have the 
60,000 volunteers of the CFA – these are the men and women who stand between 
Victorians and the inferno of the Australian bushfire.

Those heroes, those volunteers, those community organisations are, if the 
government has its way, if the premier has his way, are going to be 
subordinated to the firefighters union, at the union’s demand.

this is now the real Malcolm campaigning?

Several questions about childcare. Will the government bring forward its 
package?

Malcolm Turnbull:

If we can secure the passage of our legislation after parliament gets back, 
assuming we are returned to government, then, and if we can start it earlier, 
then we will ...

We have a genuine reform package, it’s a genuine reform package, and it is one 
that will provide the greatest support, considerably enhanced support to 
families on lower incomes.

Q: Do you have any alternative savings for childcare, if the Senate does block 
these measures in the next parliament?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, it is a package, as you know, we have savings out of the – we have other 
savings, as you know, in the social welfare budget. We believe they are prudent 
savings. Look, the reality is Labor is proposing to spend $3bn extra and they 
have not indicated at all where it is going to come from.

Let’s take stock of Monday with a parting summary that’s wider than today, in 
the spirit of where are we at the campaign midpoint?

 * The Coalition is clearly having trouble landing the core “jobs and growth” 
message. The budget message has been wound back progressively to focus on the 
tax cut as a small business measure, not a tax cut for big companies. 
Economists have also picked apart the benefits of the policy to the point where 
it must now be clear to anyone paying attention that the budget roadmap is a 
distance short of a magic bullet.Malcolm Turnbull is also starting to go to 
work on his negatives. A new advertisement featuring the prime minister talking 
about his upbringing and his father (the personal being political) is clearly 
designed to create a connection between the voters and the candidate, which 
suggests there may be trouble on that front. Given how presidential the 
Coalition campaign is, given all the Coalition eggs are in the Turnbull basket, 
it is a problem, potentially, if the voters are feeling disconnected from the 
candidate. The Coalition can’t exactly revert to a team campaign from here, 
this play has got to work, or they all sink.

 * Labor is just chugging along with its game plan, which has been to contrast 
its social capital and inclusive growth agenda with the Coalition’s trickle 
down proposal. It’s been steady-as-she-goes, there’s been no significant 
repositioning, or recalibration of the messaging, and the polls (as well as 
some of the factors I’ve outlined above) suggest we have a genuine contest.Bill 
Shorten looks relaxed, and his communication is mostly effective. But things 
are going to get tougher from here. Labor remains weak on costings and 
spending, and I think it’s risky to launch big spending initiatives without a 
very clear sense of the specific savings that will pay for the policies. Small 
tells like a childcare policy that isn’t means tested suggests there’s not 
enough internal discipline, that election spending imperatives are crowding out 
the budget imperatives. And how about jobs and the economy? This territory does 
need to be occupied at some point.

But, we are only at the half way point. All things liable to change without 
notice.

Thanks for your company today, I’ll be back, doing it all again, tomorrow.
 
GetUp! has referred the LNP backbencher George Christensen to the Australian 
Electoral Commission for seeking to giveLibby Barge of Eco Barge Turtle 
Sanctuary $12,000 “personal contribution” if he’s re-elected. The activist 
group says in a press release issued this afternoon that Christensen, in a 
Facebook post, says he will provide a “$12,000 personal contribution” toLibby 
Barge of Eco Barge Turtle Sanctuary – but only if he is re-elected. GetUp! 
national directorPaul Oosting contends this sort of proposition is “against the 
laws and conventions of our democracy. He’s got serious questions to answer”.
 
Look out Sturt.
 Knock knock  
The shadow education minister, Kate Ellis, is being pressed on Sky News about 
how Labor will fund its childcare policy.

Kate Ellis:

The way we fund it is to make it a priority and find savings elsewhere.

Ellis says Labor will save more than it spends over the cycle. Is this over 
four years or over 10 years, Sky political editorDavid Speers, wonders? Ellis 
says the shadow treasurer,Chris Bowen, will make the announcements at the 
appropriate time.

Speers asks Ellis whether it is OK for Bill Shorten to characterise childcare 
as a responsibility that falls on women. Ellis says the Labor leader is just 
talking about reality. The evidence is clear, she says, that women do the 
majority of unpaid work in this country.

But what if Tony Abbott had said that, would Labor be sanguine? Ellis says 
Shorten is not saying that it’s right orthe way it should be, just that it’s 
the current reality. A better childcare system would make it less of a reality, 
she says.
 
Gracious.

Sorry. Thread, calls, people coming and going, will pick up the threads now.
 
I do love the idea of the two campaign planes snarling at each other on the 
tarmac.Malcolm Turnbull was due to go to Tasmania this afternoon, but the bad 
weather has apparently scotched that.
 Snarling at one another. @turnbullmalcolm 
<https://www.instagram.com/turnbullmalcolm/> and @billshortenmp

Melbourne.  
It was quite funny though, how Malcolm Turnbull corrected himself when he 
thought he’d gone in too deep on fathers. Mothers, great. Engineers, great, 
kiddies, great, everyone – great. If you don’t do that, you wake up lathered in 
a fresh moral panic about some key demographic disdained – like all the faux 
outrage today aboutBill Shorten being a Jurassic creature who thinks only women 
are responsible for childcare (despite the fact he’s produced a policy which is 
clearly intended to help women work more). God, campaigns, excruciating.

Malcolm Turnbull’s self-identification as a feminist this afternoon gives me 
the organising idea to work through what I need to work through with the prime 
minister’s statement about his father in the press conference just then: let’s 
grab the catchcry of second-wave feminists,the personal is political.

Let’s do this step by step.

Overnight (as has been referenced several times today), the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> campaign has produced an 
advertisement which featuresMalcolm Turnbull talking about his father. The 
purpose of this conversation with voters is obvious. The campaign needs to 
counter perceptions about the candidate being removed from the life experience 
of ordinary Australian voters. What better way to counter that perception than 
with a testimonial about your lived experience, and by producing a lived 
experience common to a lot of people who have been through the visceral trauma 
of parental separation. Anyone who has lived through a similar experience 
immediately understands what Turnbull is talking about, empathy with that case 
study is immediate – it cuts across gender, social class and economic 
circumstances. Even if you haven’t been through that, there’s an element of 
“there but for the grace of God go I”.

Personal stories are powerful, that’s why modern politicians trade in them.

So let’s come now to where the campaign objective (humanising Malcolm) meets 
the personal.Malcolm Turnbull can deliver this version of himself because it’s 
real. The loss he still carries floats to the surface entirely organically. 
This is a foundational story for this man, who also happens to be a politician 
and, currently, the prime minister. He dives deep into the story to tell it – 
you saw it just then. It’s not a campaign conceit, it’s core to his personal 
mythology. That’s why it has currency, it’s a kernel of real in an ocean of 
tactics and strategy.


It’s a bit like where I started this morning. I mentioned there’s an overlay 
of nostalgia in Turnbull’s framing and styling: he needs that sense of 
continuity to take the edge off his aggressive modernity, lest he get typecast 
as the tech guy, or the venture capital guy, or the let markets rip guy – he’s 
creating something more timeless in the way he’s presenting himself. It’s also 
part of the Coalition’s stability pitch, the “let’s reduce the chaos and 
turnover in Canberra” pitch, being the person who projects to voters as calm, 
and prime ministerial. The affect is deliberate. It’s not an accident.

It boils down to a simple proposition. Election campaigns for candidates are a 
process of reducing your negatives. The higher the negatives get, the harder it 
is for you to be elected. If you have a negative (and Turnbull’s negatives are 
pretty obvious), best get about reducing them.

Quite fascinating in it’s way, this. All the turning on the head of a pin, and 
the pulses of human emotion in the middle of the choreography.
 
Well we are having an interesting day, bit strange, but interesting, I’ll be 
back with some thoughts on that shortly.
 
Q: I asked before about the Sky News people’s forum with the ‘Courier-Mail’. 
Will you go to that on Wednesday and Mr Shorten said that it would be offensive 
to Queenslanders if you don’t?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I’m sure he did. Look, we are actually - we are having some -we are looking at 
some alternatives and what I’m hoping to do is to have a debate that is a bit 
different, that is - that involves Facebook and that involves a larger 
audience, and that is more engaging. So, I can assure you, I enjoy debating and 
I want to reach as many people as I possibly can in the debate because we have 
a great story to tell.

Our national economic plan is vitally important for our nation’s future, and I 
want to have the opportunity to explain it and take questions on it for as many 
people as possible. So we’re looking at some so we are looking at how we can 
achieve wider and greater reach for the debate.

If that’s all, thank you very much for being here. As I said, fathers rock, 
mothers are great, engineers are great, girls can do anything.

See you.
 
Q: Mr Turnbull, could I just ask you about the video your campaign released 
last night, your reflections on your relationship with your father and your 
upbringing. Why was it important to release that? Was that to counter 
misconceptions?

Malcolm Turnbull:

It’s important to honour your parents Mark. It is important to honour your 
father. I was - I was brought up by my father. He ... He taught me so many 
things, some of them I talked about in that video. He taught me how to cook, 
not with great talent, I hasten to add, but competently. He taught me how to 
iron competently. I’ve been given high marks by Mrs Turnbull on that score. And 
he taught me respect and loyalty. Well, as I said, I would not be the man I am 
today without him. He was a great – you know, the most – there are many 
remarkable things about my dad, but I tell you one thing that was in some ways 
the most remarkable. When my mother left us, we had nowhere to live and Dad 
rented a flat and didn’t have any furniture. I think the only bit of furniture 
we had left was my bed, so it wasn’t – he had every reason to be a bit unhappy, 
to say the least.

And yet he never ever said a bad word about her. You think about, you know – 
you think about how rare that is. He never uttered a critical word of my mother 
in all of those years. And when he died and then – he was killed young, he was 
killed in an aeroplane crash when he was 56 ... I had both of their sets of 
correspondence and I could read the letters that Bruce wrote to my mother, the 
letters this he were filled with sadness and reproach and, you know, how could 
you do this, why did you do that, and the back and forth. I literally have the 
two sides of the correspondence. And I thought: “What does it say about a man? 
What does it say about his love that he could sit down and write letters like 
that, pouring out his heart and then turn to his little boy and say, your 
mother is the greatest woman in the world and she loves you more than anything.”

What a man. What a great man. So, fathers, fathers rock. There you go. Fathers 
rock. And so do the mothers, too.

Are there any other questions?
 
A reporter notes the prime minister flagged changes to the Fair Work Act over 
the weekend. What exactly would they be?

(I gave you that quote a couple from Turnbull a couple of posts back).

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, as you know, under the Fair Work Act there are a number of - there is a 
list of what are called objectionable clauses in EBAs, in industrial 
agreements, and what we would do - what we propose to do is to include into 
that list of objectionable clauses ones which would have the impact ... have an 
adverse impact on volunteer organisations such as the CFA.

Turnbull goes on to reference the floods over the weekend: Bill Shorten has to 
decide whether he is on the side of theheroes of the emergency services 
brigades or whether he’s on the side of the trade unions. They aren’t heroes in 
this calculation.
 
A question about union governance, which gives the prime minister an 
opportunity to reference the Country Fire Authority dispute in Victoria. And 
infernos.

Malcolm Turnbull:

You’ve seen the extraordinary events here in Victoria where you would have the 
60,000 volunteers of the CFA – these are the men and women who stand between 
Victorians and the inferno of the Australian bushfire.

Those heroes, those volunteers, those community organisations are, if the 
government has its way, if the premier has his way, are going to be 
subordinated to the firefighters union, at the union’s demand.
 
Q: Your family has been a big focus of the campaign the last couple of days. 
Do you want Australians to get to know you better and why, and would you say 
this is now the real Malcolm campaigning?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I will leave you to the commentary.
 
Several questions about childcare. Will the government bring forward its 
package?

Malcolm Turnbull:

If we can secure the passage of our legislation after parliament gets back, 
assuming we are returned to government, then, and if we can start it earlier, 
then we will ...

We have a genuine reform package, it’s a genuine reform package, and it is one 
that will provide the greatest support, considerably enhanced support to 
families on lower incomes.

Q: Do you have any alternative savings for childcare, if the Senate does block 
these measures in the next parliament?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, it is a package, as you know, we have savings out of the – we have other 
savings, as you know, in the social welfare budget. We believe they are prudent 
savings. Look, the reality is Labor is proposing to spend $3bn extra and they 
have not indicated at all where it is going to come from.
