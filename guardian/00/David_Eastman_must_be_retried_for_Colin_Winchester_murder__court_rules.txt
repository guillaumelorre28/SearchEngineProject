David Eastman has lost his bid to stay a retrial over the murder of Australian 
Federal Police assistant commissioner Colin Winchester murder in 1989.

Eastman, 70, spent nearly 20 years behind bars before his original conviction 
was quashed in 2014. He was released from prison when an inquiry found there 
were errors in forensic analysis used to link him to the Canberra crime scene. 
Since then he has been fighting a retrial.

On Thursday acting ACT supreme court judge David Ashley dismissed Eastman’s 
application for a stay of proceedings.

Eastman argued, among other points, there had been adverse publicity about his 
alleged role in Winchester’s killing and that the cost of a new trial was 
unwarranted.

He also cited what he said was deliberately unfair conduct by the prosecution 
in the 1995 trial, and police harassment between 1989 and 1992.

The application took nine days of hearings in February, much of it behind 
closed doors.

“Eastman has not satisfied the court that the proceeding against him should be 
permanently stayed,” acting Justice Ashley said. How the judge came to that 
decision will not be made public for fear it could compromise the retrial.

Only Eastman’s legal team and the prosecution will have access to the reasons 
behind the decision.

Winchester was shot twice in the head as he parked his car in the driveway of 
his Canberra home on 10 January 1989.

The matter will return to court on 5 May for directions.
