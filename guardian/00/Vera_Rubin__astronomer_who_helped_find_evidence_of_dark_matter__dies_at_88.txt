Vera Rubin, a pioneering astronomer who helped find powerful evidence of dark 
matter, has died aged 88, her son said on Monday.

She died on Sunday night of natural causes, Allan Rubin told the Associated 
Press. The professor of geosciences at Princeton University said his mother, a 
Philadelphia native, had been living in the Princeton area.

Vera Rubin found that galaxies don’t quite rotate the way they were predicted, 
and that lent support to the theory that some other force was at work, namely 
dark matter.

Dark matter, which hasn’t been directly observed, makes up 27% of the universe 
– as opposed to 5% of the universe being normal observable matter. Scientists 
better understand what dark matter is not rather than what it is.

Rubin’s scientific achievements earned her numerous honours, including 
becoming the second female astronomer to be elected to the National Academy of 
Sciences. She also received the National Medal of Science from President Bill 
Clinton in 1993 “for her pioneering research programs in observational 
cosmology”.

Her interest in astronomy began as a young girl and grew with the involvement 
of her father, Philip Cooper, an electrical engineer who helped her build a 
telescope and took her to meetings of amateur astronomers.

She was the only astronomy major to graduate from Vassar College in 1948. When 
she sought to enrol as a graduate student at Princeton, she learned that women 
were not allowed in the university’s graduate astronomy program, so she instead 
earned her master’s degree from Cornell.

Rubin earned her doctorate from Georgetown University, where she was later 
employed as a faculty member for several years before working at the Carnegie 
Institution in Washington, a nonprofit scientific research centre.

During her career, Rubin examined more than 200 galaxies.
