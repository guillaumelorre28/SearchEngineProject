The extra resources will go towards improved housing and healthcare for people 
living with HIV and Aids and is part of the state’s official aim to eradicate 
the disease by 2020.

The $200m to be committed from next year’s state budget will represent an 8% 
increase on the $2.5bn currently spent annually on programs aimed at education, 
treatment, prevention and provisions, including antiretroviral medication that 
has had a dramatic effect on preventing infection.

“New York was once the epicenter of the Aids crisis. But now we are showing 
the nation how to fight back and make this epidemic a thing of the past,” Cuomo 
said in a statement.

The New York department of health has said its aim is to bring HIV infection 
rates below 750 new cases a year in the state, from the current level of 
approximately 3,000 a year. Achieving that would reduce the illness to a level 
that would be regarded as a negligible public health threat, officials said.

“We are making rapid progress toward a future where more people know their 
status, medication is easily accessible, and new cases are more and more rare,” 
Cuomo added.

“As we mark World Aids Day, we remember all those we have lost, and we 
recommit ourselves to ending this epidemic once and for all.”

The New York-based nonprofit Gay Men’s Health Crisis called the extra funding 
pledge “major money”.

The Cuomo administration has put a strong focus on a drug called Truvada, 
which protects against HIV infection, for use by people currently HIV-negative 
but deemed at risk of exposure to the virus.

Also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), it is believed to have been 
effective in preventing infection when taken diligently, and prescriptions are

.

Cuomo announced there had been a 300% increase in PrEP use among those 
enrolled in Medicaid in the state since June 2014, from 303 patients then to 
1,687 now.

The Gay Men’s Health Crisis chief executive, Kelsey Louie, said that New York 
was seizing an “historic opportunity” to make progress in the fight to end Aids.

“This new $200m in funding … will go to life-saving programs, from housing to 
treatment and prevention, to access to PrEP, which can prevent new infections,” 
Louie said. “New York is well on its way to our collective goal of ending the 
epidemic by 2020.”

Cuomo also announced a milestone in the state, in that there had not been any 
new cases of HIV transmission from mothers to their babies in more than a year, 
the first time that figure has been at zero since the Aids epidemic took hold 
in the early 1980s.

To date, 202,000 New Yorkers have been diagnosed with Aids and more than 
112,000 individuals in the state are currently living with an HIV-positive 
status or a diagnosis of Aids, the statement said.
