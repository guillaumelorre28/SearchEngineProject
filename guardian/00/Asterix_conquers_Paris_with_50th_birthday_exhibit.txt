For half a century they have been fending off Roman attacks from their 
village, armed only with fearlessness, flying menhirs and a cauldron of magic 
potion. But nowAsterix <https://www.theguardian.com/books/asterix> and his band 
of indomitable Gauls are invading Lutetia – modern-day Paris – and determined 
to make their presence felt.

Fifty years after Albert Uderzo and Réne Goscinny unveiled their comic stars 
on the pages of Pilote magazine, Parisians are to be besieged by tributes to 
France's most popular comic strip. Today, among the third-century Gallo-Roman 
baths upon which the Musée de Cluny is partially built, an exhibition of 
original plates and manuscripts opened to allow fans a glimpse of the creators' 
inspirations.

Goscinny's daughter Anne said the show would reflect the "perfect osmosis" 
that existed between her father and Uderzo. "It is the first time that people 
will see this," she said. "My father and Albert were very different … But it is 
always out of differences that the most beautiful things are born."

To add to the Asterix fervour gripping the capital, various symbols of the 
books such as giant menhirs (pictured above)and speech bubbles of famous 
exchanges will be erected at eight locations including the Place de la Concorde 
and in front of the Eiffel Tower.

Since it first appeared in October 1959, Astérix has sold 325m copies and been 
translated into 107 languages.
