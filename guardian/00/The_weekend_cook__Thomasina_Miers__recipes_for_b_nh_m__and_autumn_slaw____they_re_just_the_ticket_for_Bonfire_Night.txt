Ilove fireworks in any guise, so this week’s recipes are for Guy Fawkes. Eat 
them outside while you take in the local display, or enjoy them snuggled up in 
the warmth of home. Wherever you eat them, though, make double or triple the 
pork mixture, if you can (or make it with beef instead), because it will hold 
you in good stead for the rest of the week. Lemongrass is one of those 
ingredients that’s always worth having to hand (lemongrass gin fizz, anyone?). 
And stock up on good dark chocolate and make a flask of tequila-laced hot 
chocolate – it’s as good a way as any to beat the cold.

Vietnamese meatball sandwich with pickles

I adore Vietnamese food, especially street dishes such as bánh mì, or stuffed 
baguette. In my version, fried meatballs lend a salty-rich-savoury feel that is 
offset by all the pickley bits. I haven’t used pâté, a traditional ingredient, 
but feel free to put some in – a non-authentic chicken liver marries very well 
with the pork. Serves four.

For the pickles
½ cucumber
1 carrot, peeled
½ bunch radishes, washed
1 tbsp red-wine vinegar
100ml rice-wine vinegar
2 tbsp caster sugar

For the meatballs
400g pork mince
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 lemongrass stalks, tough outer layer removed, core finely chopped
½ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
1 big handful coriander leaves, chopped
2 tbsp fish sauce
Vegetable oil, for frying

For the sandwich
Mayonnaise
2 baguettes, cut in half lengthways
Coriander leaves
Hot sauce (optional; I like a chile de arbol one, but just use your favourite)

Make the pickle first. Using a peeler, peel long strips from the cucumber, 
avoiding the watery core, and place in a bowl. Do the same with the carrot. 
Finely slice the radish and chilli. Combine the vinegars, then add the sugar 
and stir to dissolve. Pour over the vegetables and leave to marinate for at 
least 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, put all the meatball ingredients (except for the oil) in a bowl, 
season with a little salt and a healthy amount of pepper, and mix with your 
hands. Fry a little bit of the mix in a saucepan, then taste to check the 
seasoning is right; adjust the rest of the mix if necessary. Once you’re happy 
with it, roll the mix into ping pong-sized balls (you should end up with about 
20) and transfer to a plate. If you have time, chill for 30 minutes.

Put a large frying pan on a medium-high flame and, when hot, add a splash of 
oil. Fry the meatballs (in batches, if need be) for four to five minutes, 
turning often, until golden brown all over and just cooked. The moment they’re 
cooked, put the meatballs on the lower halves of the bread, and leave to rest 
for a couple of minutes, so the juices soak in.

To finish the sandwich, spread the other baguette halves with a generous 
helping of mayo, top the meatball halves with the pickles and a few coriander 
leaves, put the mayo’d bread on top and serve while still warm.

We make a slaw similar to this at DF/Mexico <http://www.dfmexico.co.uk>, our 
new restaurant in east London. The sweet sharpness of the apples makes it very 
moreish, and it is also exceptionally pretty. When I’m not eating it out under 
the stars and fireworks, I love it with grilled chicken and lots of mayo on the 
side.

2 Granny Smith apples
2 carrots, peeled
½ small red cabbage
¼ small white cabbage
½ bunch radishes
½ small red onion
3 spring onions
2 tsp white sesame seeds
1 tsp black sesame seeds (optional)
1 handful coriander leaves, chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing
The juice of 1-2 limes
2 tbsp cider vinegar
3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1 tsp caster sugar

Wash the apples, peel the carrots and coarsely grate both into a large bowl, 
avoiding the apple core. If you have a mandolin, use it to slice the cabbages, 
radishes and red onions wafer thin; otherwise use a sharp knife to cut them as 
thinly as possible. (If you cut the vegetables too thickly, the salad will 
taste quite coarse, crunchy in an uncomfortable way and the flavours won’t get 
a chance to shine through.) Top and tail the spring onions, then slice very 
thinly. Toast the sesame seeds.

Toss the whole lot with the coriander leaves and the dressing ingredients, 
seasoning generously. It should taste quite sharp, vivid and bright, but by all 
means add extra oil or a dash of mayonnaise if you prefer a salad with more 
creaminess. And if you like heat, there’s nothing to stop you adding a touch of 
hot sauce, too.

And for the rest of the week

With extra meatball mix, brown balls in hot oil, then simmer with noodles in 
chicken or pork stock, and serve with beansprouts, lots of mint and coriander, 
and chopped, toasted peanuts; or shape into patties, fry and serve with rice 
and the same trimmings as the noodles. Make extra pickles, too, not only to 
snack on, but also to stuff into jacket potatoes with grated cheddar, lots of 
butter, chopped spring onions and flaked smoked mackerel. The slaw makes a 
great packed lunch, either as a simple side or stuffed in a sandwich; it’s also 
lovely in a bowl of chilli con carne or with deep-fried tofu and sesame-oiled 
noodles. And mince any leftover lemongrass: it keeps brilliantly in the freezer.
