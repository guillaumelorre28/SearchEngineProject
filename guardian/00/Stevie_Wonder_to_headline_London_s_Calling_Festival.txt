, will top the bill during a new strand of the Hard Rock Calling event, which 
takes place on Clapham Common from Saturday 28 June to Sunday 29 June. Live 
Nation’s Vice President of Promotions, Toby Leighton-Pope commented: "We’re 
thrilled to welcome Stevie Wonder to Calling Festival. His music is timeless 
and this show will be one of the highlights of the summer! Richie Sambora joins 
the Saturday bill which is looking fantastic, it’s going to be an unforgettable 
event."

"I’ve been so involved writing my autobiography I did not realise how long it 
had been since we have played across the big pond," guitarist Joe Perry said in 
a statement. "It's been far too long since we have performed in the UK. We 
can't wait to bring back some of the classics as well as some of the new songs 
from Music from Another Dimension. We miss our UK fans. See you soon."

Over 20 names are due to be announced in the coming months, with acts such as 
Thunder, Walking Papers and Joe Bonamassa so far confirmed to appear.
