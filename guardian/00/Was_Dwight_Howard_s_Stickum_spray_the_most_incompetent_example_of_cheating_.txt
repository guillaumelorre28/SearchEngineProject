On Saturday night, the Houston Rockets lost a game, which was anything but a 
news story, especially not this season. What made the 109-97 loss to the 
Atlanta Hawks notable was an incident where Rockets center Dwight Howard was
caught using the adhesive substance Stickum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/20/dwight-howard-sticky-spray-nba-review-houston-rockets-atlanta-hawks>
 during the game. It was the latest embarrassing development for a team that’s 
hada season full of them 
<http://espn.go.com/blog/houston-rockets/post/_/id/2199/from-pink-slips-to-stickum-rockets-have-had-issues-all-season>
.


“I’ve never felt the ball like that ever,” said Atlanta’s Paul Millsap, who 
discovered the substance on the ball while lining up for a free throw, “It was 
sticky. It was like super glue or something was on there. I couldn’t get it off 
my hands. It was the weirdest thing ever.”

The officials confiscated a bottle of what ended up being Stickum and warned 
both teams that it was prohibited. Afterwards, Howardadmitted 
<http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/03/houston-rockets-dwight-howard-got-caught-using-stickum-spray-and-laughed-it-off>
 that he used the product “every game,” while denying that it was a big deal. 
The NBA apparently agreed, to an extent. While the leaguesent out a warning 
<http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15037229/no-fine-nba-issues-warning-rockets-dwight-howard-admitted-stickum-use>
 to all teams emphasizing that the “use of an adhesive substance” was not 
allowed during games, it declined to suspend or even level a fine at Howard.

The NBA might have declined to take action against Howard because it seems 
doubtful that Stickum, mostfamously used 
<http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/basketball/stickums-sticky-history-sports/nqpss/>
 in the NFL by wide receivers seeking a better grip, could even help a 
basketball player. Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens spoke to thiswhen he 
commented on the situation 
<http://www.csnne.com/boston-celtics/stevens-never-heard-using-stickum-basketball-dwight-howard-rockets>
, “I’d never really heard of it. Like, I’ve never heard of it being used ... I 
can’t figure out why you’d want to have it on.”

It’s certainly hard to imagine why Howard, notoriously one of the worst free 
throw shooters in the league, would be using a substance designed to make it 
more difficult to get the ball out of one’s hands. Did he think it would help 
him collect rebounds? Does he live in constant fear of ill-timed, grip-related 
turnovers? Would whatever imagined edge that he thinks Stickum would give him 
be worth the negative effects it could have on every other aspect of the game?


Because his reasons for using Stickum remain puzzling, Howard should stop 
worrying 
<http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25525880/dwight-howard-admits-to-cheating-doesnt-like-being-called-a-cheater>
 that the incident will cause fans to label him a “cheater”. The most likely 
outcome to the quasi-controversy is him becoming an even bigger target of 
ridicule than he was before. Only Dwight Howard could discover a way to break 
the rules of basketball that may have made him objectively worse at it. It’s 
like a famous hitter in baseball getting caught trying to use a foam bat.


Perhaps the Stickum situation would have led to more condemnation if Howard 
and the Rockets were still threatening enough to be hated. Last season, the 
Rockets made it to the Western Conference Finals and many believed (at the time 
at least) that James Harden, not Steph Curry, deserved last year’s MVP. Howard, 
Harden and company were considered to be dangerous enough to be worthy of the 
label“villains”. 
<http://hoopshabit.com/2015/03/17/houston-rockets-new-villains-nba/>


This year, Houston’s best case scenario involves a first round playoff exit, 
presumably in four or five games. The Rockets have been such underachievers 
this year that they are establishing themselves as something of a joke, or 
maybe even worse. After months of laughing at Howard’s free-throw numbers, 
Harden’s indifferent defense and the front office’s frequent failures, the 
Stickum fiasco might mark the point where the situation in Houston has gone 
from comic todownright sad

Three random thoughts on this footage of the Stickum incident:


1) A+ George Brett <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbEHAsZxRYo> reference by 
the announcers.
2) When watching this video for the first time, a sponsored ad for Stickum 
popped up and it’s either the best or worst timed algorithmic product placement 
in YouTube history.
3) The Rockets disguised the can of Stickum by wrapping it in white tape so 
that it would look like one of the “generic” cans of consumer items inRepo Man

Quote of the week

It comes and goes. You wake up, and just because it’s raining, it’s gonna 
start hurting. It’s just any situation, it can start hurting. Especially when 
you get hit on it, or it gets pulled back a certain way—it starts hurting

New Orleans Pelicans’ Anthony Davis on the injuries 
<http://deadspin.com/anthony-davis-says-hes-been-playing-hurt-for-three-year-1766194764>
 that will end his season

On Monday, the Pelicans announced they would be shutting down Davis for the 
season. Davis will undergo surgeries on his left shoulder and his left knee, 
leaving him unable to participate in theupcoming Olympics 
<http://deadspin.com/who-will-take-anthony-daviss-spot-at-the-olympics-1766261759>
.


 More disturbing was the later revelation 
<http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/3/21/11277978/anthony-davis-injury-shoulder-torn-labrum-3-years>
 that Davis had been playing with a torn labrum for three years. The Pelicans, 
whoknew about this injury 
<http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15035714/anthony-davis-new-orleans-pelicans-skip-rio-games-says-shoulder-hurt-3-years>
 since Davis’s rookie season, allowed the future of their entire franchise to 
play through it for this entire time. It’s a little scary that we haven’t yet 
seen a fully healthy Davis in the NBA yet, and it might be even more 
frightening that we may never see it if the Pelicans continue to put their star 
player at risk like this.


How did LeBron carry the Cavaliers this week?

LeBron James did his part in helping the Cleveland Cavaliers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-cavaliers> clinch the Central 
Division on Monday by scoring 33 points in their 124-91 win over the Denver 
Nuggets. Not that this was what anybody was talking about afterwards.


 Earlier in the day, James made news by unfollowing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/22/lebron-james-unfollows-cavaliers-twitter-account>
 the official Cavaliers Twitter account. Accordingto sources 
<http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/03/lebron_james_unfollowed_the_ca.html>
, James is merely attempting to limit distractions in preparation for the 
postseason. Considering that he’s still dealing with the fallout fromthe 
oblique tweets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/02/cleveland-cavaliers-struggles-nba-lebron-james>
 he made earlier in the month, maybe someone close to James should clue him in 
on the drama-avoiding virtues of Twitter’s mute function.

Power rankings

1. Golden State Warriors (last week: 1)

A win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday put the Warriors back on track 
afterSaturday’s loss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/20/san-antonio-spurs-golden-state-warriors-nba-stephen-curry>
 to San Antonio Spurs. Still, Golden State can only afford to lose two more 
times if they want to surpass the 72-10 record of the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls.


2. San Antonio Spurs (2)

By defeating the Warriors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/20/golden-state-warriors-san-antonio-spurs-nba>
 on Saturday night, the Spurs cut Golden State’s lead in the Western Conference 
to three games. Their chances of keeping pace looked pretty good when they held 
the Charlotte Hornets to seven points in the first quarter of their game Monday 
night. Instead, the Hornets pulled off an epic comeback, beating them 91-88 
while a Warriors win extended their lead back to four.


3. Cleveland Cavaliers (3)

Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue is saying 
<http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15033602/tyronn-lue-says-cleveland-cavaliers-prioritize-resting-players-east-top-seed>
 that he’s going to concentrate more on keeping players healthy rather than 
doing everything he can to make sure that Cleveland remains the top seed in the 
East. The Toronto Raptors, who are just 1.5 games behind them in the standings, 
should be happy to hear that.

4. Oklahoma City Thunder (4)

The funniest thing about Kevin Durant’s upcoming free agency is now that any 
time he saysanything positive 
<http://www.masslive.com/celtics/index.ssf/2016/03/kevin_durant_boston_celtics.html>
 about the city he happens to be in, fans freak out. Sorry Celtics fans, Durant 
is notcoming to Boston 
<http://www.boston.com/sports/commentary/2016/03/17/celtics-cant-steal-kevin-durants-thunder-but-they-might-just-be-able-to-steal-him-in-free-agency>
. That situation’s about as likely to happen as someone making a successful 
perpetual motion machine or a legitimately funny Fuller House episode.


5. Toronto Raptors (6)

The magic number for the Raptors to clinch a playoff spot? That would be one, 
as in one Raptors win, or one loss by the Bulls, Detroit Pistons or the Indiana 
Pacers.


6. Los Angeles Clippers (5)

The Clippers have lost four out of their last five games, including a loss to 
the Pelicans, who were playing without Anthony Davis. Before that, they lost to 
the Memphis Grizzlies, who have been playing without, well, the Memphis 
Grizzlies.

7. Miami Heat (8)

The fight for the three-through-six seeds in the super-tight Eastern Conference
 
<http://www.sbnation.com/2016/3/22/11279812/2016-nba-scores-wizards-hawks-pistons-pacers-bulls-east-playoffs-eighth-8-spot>
 will be incredibly stressful on a micro-level while mostly uninteresting from 
a big picture perspective. The Heat, the Hawks, the Hornets and the Celtics 
will almost certainly win those spots, but they will probably be fighting for 
playoff positioning for the remainder of the regular season.


8. Atlanta Hawks <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-hawks> (11)

The stressful part about the Eastern Conference mid-seeds is that every single 
loss from here on out could feel like a major setback. A double-digit loss to 
the Washington Wizards, like the one the Hawks experienced on Monday night, 
might feel like multiple major setbacks.


9. Charlotte Hornets (10)

In their 91-88 win over the Spurs, the Hornets overcame a 23 point deficit. 
Jeremy Linoutscored the entire Spurs bench 
<https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/watching-the-houston-rockets-a-team-in-shambles/?utm_source=vicesportstwitter>
.


10. Boston Celtics (7)

Think the Celtics miss Jae Crowder? Playing without the small forward, the 
Celtics lost four straight games before being bailed out by the schedule. 
Nothing like a Philadelphia 76ers game to return a team to its winning ways.


11. Memphis Grizzlies (9)

Memphis forward Matt Barnes was suspended one game 
<http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15018840/matt-barnes-memphis-grizzlies-suspended-one-game-verbally-challenging-john-henson>
 for heading to the Milwaukee Bucks locker room to confront John Henson. 
Basically, at this point, if you see Barnes’ in a story you should just assume 
some variation of the phrase “heading to confront” will shortly follow.


12. Indiana Pacers (12)

With the three to six spots in the Eastern Conference all bundled up, it’s 
looking like the Pacers, Bulls and Pistons will be fighting for the two 
remaining playoff spots.

13. Portland Trail Blazers (13)

Damian Lillard’s response 
<http://deadspin.com/damian-lillard-has-the-best-response-to-kendrick-perkin-1765943195>
 to a Kendrick Perkins attempted decapitation? “It was dirty for sure, but it’s 
a physical game. I’m from Oakland, I’ve been punched before, I’ve been tackled 
before.”

14. Chicago Bulls (15)

“Fred Hoidberg’s idea of progress: Bulls don’t choke against a bad team” is 
one of themost gloriously snarky NBA headlines 
<http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/ct-bulls-kings-derrick-rose-rosenbloom-20160322-column.html>
 of the year.

15. Dallas Mavericks (14)

Dallas’s Chandler Parsons will most likely be undergoing season-ending knee 
surgery 
<http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-mavericks/mavericks/2016/03/22/report-mavericks-forward-chandler-parsons-likely-undergo-season-ending-surgery>
.

16. Detroit Pistons (16)

If the Pistons don’t make the playoffs, it won’t be because of lack of effort 
on Andre Drummond’s part.

18. Utah Jazz (18)

Cheer up Jazz, even if you end up just missing out on the playoffs, that just 
means avoiding a near-certain soul-crushing sweep courtesy of the Warriors.


19. Washington Wizards (19)
