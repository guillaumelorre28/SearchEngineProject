Scorpia Rising is a really exciting book. Alex Rider’s life is on the end of 
the line. Scorpia are forever growing deadlier. Their sting is growing 
stronger. Death is beckoning him on.

Killing Alex Rider’s mum, dad and uncle isn’t enough. Somebody else close to 
his heart is consumed by dangerous death. Alan Blunt, chief executive of the 
Special Operations division of MI6, is sacked leaving his successor Mrs Jones 
as the new boss. Everything is crumbling will things ever get better?

My favourite character is Alex. 

This is definitely up there with my favourite books, if not even the best I’ve 
read. I would give Scorpia Rising 9 out of 10.
