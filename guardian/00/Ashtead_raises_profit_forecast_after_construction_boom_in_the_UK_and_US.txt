Ashtead <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ashteadgroup> has increased its 
guidance for annual profits after booming construction markets in the US and 
Britain increased demand for its industrial equipment hire business.

Ashtead, which makes 85% of its revenue in the US, said rental revenue there 
rose by 22% in the first quarter of the financial year. Revenues at its British 
business increased by 19%.

Excluding currency fluctuations, pre-tax profit in the three months to 31 July 
rose by a third to a record £120m. Business continued strongly in August.

Geoff Drabble, Ashtead's chief executive, said: "As a result of this strong 
performance, and with a strong balance sheet to support future growth, we now 
anticipate a full-year result ahead of our previous expectations."

The upbeat statement sent Ashtead's shares up 2.8% to £10.09.

US construction spending rose by 1.8% to a high not seen since December 2008, 
while in the UK, construction output jumped at its fastest rate in seven months 
in August, industry data showed on Tuesday.

However, economists are concerned that the resurgent market for UK residential 
construction is supported by an unsustainable property boom, fuelled by low 
interest rates and the government's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme.
