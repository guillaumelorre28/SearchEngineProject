Michael Vaughan, who was today voted the player of the Ashes series, has 
climbed to the highest rating for an England batsman since former captain 
Graham Gooch was top a decade ago.

Vaughan, who scored 183 in England's second innings in their only victory in 
the fifth and final Test, is second in the ratings behind Australian opener 
Matthew Hayden and ahead of third-placed South African Jacques Kallis.

The Australians, who clinched the Ashes series after only three tests, have 
three batsmen in the top 10 with Adam Gilchrist fourth and Ricky Ponting eighth.

Andy Caddick is in sixth place on the bowlers' list headed by Glenn McGrath of 
Australia after taking seven wickets for 94 in Australia's second innings in 
the fifth test and 10 altogether in the match.

South Africa batsman Herschelle Gibbs, sixth, and bowler Makhaya Ntini, 
eighth, both achieved their best ratings after helping their team to a 2-0 
series victory over Pakistan which put them top of the test championship 
standings.
