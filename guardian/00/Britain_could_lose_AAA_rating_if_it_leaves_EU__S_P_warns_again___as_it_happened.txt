Wall Street opens lower

Despite earlier hopes that the US market would move higher at the open, it has 
slipped back in early trading.

Investors appear to be unsettled by another move lower in the oil price, with 
Brent crude currently down 0.8% at $38.34 a barrel on concerns that a meeting 
this month between producers would be unable to agree a freeze in output.

So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 24 points or 0.14%, which has 
seen European markets come off their best levels. The FTSE 100 is now up 0.2%, 
Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac are both 0.4% better.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.

Three possible solutions 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/207591/article/ekathimerini/business/three-possible-ways-forward-for-greek-talks>
 to the Greek situation are examined by newspaper Kathimerini:

Under the circumstances, there are three possible ways forward. First, 
continue on the same muddling-through path with the IMF in an advisory role. 
Obviously, the Fund has to compromise its positions. Second, the European 
lenders show the IMF the exit and assume the responsibility for the Greek 
program, sticking to the targets, accepting a milder austerity package and 
providing a politically acceptable version of debt relief. However, this may 
face political resistance in Germany and other countries. Third, the European 
Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Stability Mechanism 
accept the IMF’s action plan. In this case, the primary surplus target should 
be lowered and generous debt relief should be provided.

Undoubtedly, the three stakeholders in the Greek program have different 
political incentives. This makes a reasonable solution more difficult to reach. 
On the three possible ways forward outlined above, it seems the 
muddling-through approach would be the least productive but politics could 
continue to make it the dominant one. The remaining two approaches would face 
bigger political hurdles but could work better for all parties involved.

Worries about the Greek bailout after the weekend’s reported IMF threat have 
sent Greek bond yields higher.

The two year yields climbed to a one month high of 11.15% while 10 year yields 
rose 26 basis points to 8.99%. The Greek bond prices are weakening following 
the report that the IMF threatened to leave the third bailout programme to put 
pressure on creditors - notably Germany - to reach a deal on debt relief.

The IMF has denied this but managing director Christine Lagarde unsettled 
investors by sayingthe sides were a good distance away from a deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/04/imf-denies-claim-it-threatened-to-pull-out-of-greek-bailout-business-live?page=with:block-57020b2de4b0d29fa4d0c5c6#block-57020b2de4b0d29fa4d0c5c6>
.

The Athens stock market has also been hit, and is currently around 1.5% lower. 
Economist Stuart Culverhouse at distressed debt broker Exotix told Reuters:

Markets are nervous that it could either delay progress on the subsequent 
reviews or lead to something more significant. I don’t think there is much of a 
risk of default in the very near term but clearly if it absents official 
financing then it becomes more of a concern.

Talks are due to restart today after a series of delays amid disagreements on 
the size of Greece’s fiscal gap and the progress on pension reforms and bad 
debts.

The review of the Greek bailout programme is expected to be completed by the 
end of April or early May, according to a spokesman for the German finance 
ministry.

But the Germans say a debt haircut is not on the agenda, Reuters is reporting, 
afterthe weekend’s leak about supposed IMF plans.  
<https://wikileaks.org/imf-internal-20160319/> The spokesman said Germany was 
confident a solution would be found, but more work needed to be done.

That tallies with comments from the EU:

EU official on Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> bailout: "Key 
issues such as spending cuts, pension reforms and non-performing loans are 
still open".

S&P warns again on Brexit risk to Britain's AAA rating

Standard & Poor’s has repeated its  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/brexit-vote-would-affect-uks-top-credit-score-says-standard-and-poor>
earlier warning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/brexit-vote-would-affect-uks-top-credit-score-says-standard-and-poor>
 that Britain could lose its much-prized AAA rating if the country votes to 
leave the European Union.

Writing an opinion piece on the Politico website, 
<http://www.politico.eu/article/opinion-brexit-puts-uks-aaa-rating-at-risk-says-sp-ratings-chief/>
 S&P’s chief sovereign ratings officer Moritz Kraemer said:

When Britain last held a referendum on its European Union membership in 1975, 
the stakes were not nearly as high. The U.K. had joined the European community 
only two years earlier. But today, given the U.K.’s deep political, financial 
and trading ties in Europe, an exit would be much more fraught — and the risks, 
when it comes to its credit worthiness, are therefore considerably higher.

While Brexit supporters share a collective skepticism about the “European 
experiment,” they lack consensus on what Britain’s trading options and 
political alliances will look like outside of the EU. If the Brexit camp wins 
the vote on June 23, the U.K. would enter a protracted period of uncertainty 
while its people debate the alternative. Markets dislike uncertainty — 
especially protracted uncertainty — and this “working out” period will likely 
have adverse credit consequences for the U.K...

Brexit would further polarize the U.K.’s political system, increase risks to 
effective, transparent and predictable policymaking, and diminish the U.K.’s 
long-term sovereign creditworthiness. Brexit also heightens potential risks to 
economic growth and the balance of payments, as well as domestic political 
threats to territorial integrity.

Consequently, a vote for “Leave” would likely lead Standard & Poor’s to lower 
the U.K.’s AAA rating — a rating it has held, without interruption, since 1978. 
While the U.K.’s rating would likely remain high given its many institutional, 
financial and economic strengths, the U.K. would lose its place in the 
increasingly exclusive club of AAA-rated sovereigns.

The falls in the eurozone unemployment rate could slow down in the coming 
months, says Bert Colijn at ING Bank:

While dark clouds packed over the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the 
year, the labour market has continued to provide tailwind. The improvements in 
unemployment continue to fuel domestic demand in times when consumers have 
become more cautious. This will likely mitigate the negative effects of people 
more concerned about the state of the global economy.The improvements are not 
evenly spread across the Eurozone though. France and Italy saw the number of 
unemployed increase in February, although in France this did not lead to a 
higher unemployment rate. Germany and Spain saw unemployment decline again, 
with the unemployment rate in Spain falling from 20.5% to 20.4%. The continued 
struggle to reduce unemployment in France and Italy will likely have a 
dampening effect on domestic demand in the coming months.

While the labour market continues to improve, unemployment is known to be a 
lagging indicator. Surveys have recently indicated that employers are currently 
cautious to see how the market turmoil of the beginning of the year is playing 
out, which could result in more subdued hiring in the months ahead. The 
momentum of hiring is also not as strong as it was a few months back. The 
3-month decline in unemployment has fallen from over half a million in 
September, to 224 thousand in February. With employers being cautious, this 
could mean that the relatively high pace of declines in the Eurozone 
unemployment rate over the past year could be slowing down somewhat in the 
months ahead. With the unemployment rate still well above its natural rate, 
that is bad news for price pressures.

Eurozone unemployment and producer prices fall

More data from the eurozone, with unemployment falling for a thirteenth 
successive month and producer prices dropping by more than expected in February.

The unemployment rate fell from 10.4% to 10.3% but the jobless decline of 
39,000 was the smallest drop since last May.

Producer prices fell by 0.7% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% 
decline.

Meanwhile Peter Praet, chief economist at the European Central Bank, said it 
was prepared to ease monetary policy further if inflation remained stubbornly 
low. He said at an event in Rome (quote from Reuters):

The prolonged period of low inflation we are in today has increased the risks 
that inflation misses might become persistent, which would be deeply damaging 
for the economy.

This is why we have reacted so forcefully to secure our objective - and will 
continue to do so in the future if necessary.

The UK construction data i 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/04/imf-denies-claim-it-threatened-to-pull-out-of-greek-bailout-business-live?page=with:block-5702261ee4b0d29fa4d0c5ed#block-5702261ee4b0d29fa4d0c5ed>
s disappointing, says economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight:

This is a largely disappointing survey, which suggests that construction 
output was of little help to GDP growth in the first quarter. Latest hard data 
show that construction output disappointingly dipped 0.2% month-on-month and 
0.8% in January, marking a soft start to 2016.

The government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth 
almost ground to a halt in March when it was at its weakest level since January 
2013 - given that it is looking to address the UK’s acute housing shortage.

With the corresponding manufacturing survey also weak for March, first quarter 
GDP growth again looks to have been heavily dependent on the services sector – 
so much attention will be focused on the purchasing managers survey for the 
services sector for March that comes out on Tuesday, especially as the February 
survey was at a near three-year low.

Furthermore, there is not much in the survey to indicate that the construction 
sector’s fortunes are going to pick up in the near term as it shows orders 
growth at an 11-,month low, business expectations stuck at the lowest level 
since December 2014 and employment growth at the lowest level since mid-2013.

The construction sector is seemingly currently being affected by increased 
caution among clients (especially for major projects) amid heightened UK and 
global economic uncertainties – and it notable that the purchasing managers 
indicated that clients are “unwilling to commit to new contracts or expand 
existing work”.

The looming 23 June referendum on UK membership of the EU adds to the 
uncertainties dogging the construction sector – especially given the tightness 
of opinion polls.

On a relatively encouraging note, the purchasing managers reported that 
“survey respondents cited a generally supportive economic backdrop”

Also on the positive side, there is increasing government support for 
housebuilding (which needs to see prolonged decent expansion to make genuine 
inroads into the UK’s acute housing shortage). In November’s Autumn Statement, 
the Chancellor announced plans to double the housing budget to over £2 billion 
a year and to build 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade. 
Additionally, the government has announced measures aimed at speeding up the 
planning system and reducing the obstacles to building new houses.

Despite earlier hopes that the US market would move higher at the open, it has 
slipped back in early trading.

Investors appear to be unsettled by another move lower in the oil price, with 
Brent crude currently down 0.8% at $38.34 a barrel on concerns that a meeting 
this month between producers would be unable to agree a freeze in output.

So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 24 points or 0.14%, which has 
seen European markets come off their best levels. The FTSE 100 is now up 0.2%, 
Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac are both 0.4% better.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Three possible solutions 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/207591/article/ekathimerini/business/three-possible-ways-forward-for-greek-talks>
 to the Greek situation are examined by newspaper Kathimerini:

Under the circumstances, there are three possible ways forward. First, 
continue on the same muddling-through path with the IMF in an advisory role. 
Obviously, the Fund has to compromise its positions. Second, the European 
lenders show the IMF the exit and assume the responsibility for the Greek 
program, sticking to the targets, accepting a milder austerity package and 
providing a politically acceptable version of debt relief. However, this may 
face political resistance in Germany and other countries. Third, the European 
Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Stability Mechanism 
accept the IMF’s action plan. In this case, the primary surplus target should 
be lowered and generous debt relief should be provided.

Undoubtedly, the three stakeholders in the Greek program have different 
political incentives. This makes a reasonable solution more difficult to reach. 
On the three possible ways forward outlined above, it seems the 
muddling-through approach would be the least productive but politics could 
continue to make it the dominant one. The remaining two approaches would face 
bigger political hurdles but could work better for all parties involved.
 
After a slow start, European markets are edging higher.

The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% while Germany’s Dax is up 0.66% and France’s Cac has 
climbed 0.63%.

Meanwhile US futures are showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average virtually 
unchanged, up around 8 points.
 
Worries about the Greek bailout after the weekend’s reported IMF threat have 
sent Greek bond yields higher.

The two year yields climbed to a one month high of 11.15% while 10 year yields 
rose 26 basis points to 8.99%. The Greek bond prices are weakening following 
the report that the IMF threatened to leave the third bailout programme to put 
pressure on creditors - notably Germany - to reach a deal on debt relief.

The IMF has denied this but managing director Christine Lagarde unsettled 
investors by sayingthe sides were a good distance away from a deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/04/imf-denies-claim-it-threatened-to-pull-out-of-greek-bailout-business-live?page=with:block-57020b2de4b0d29fa4d0c5c6#block-57020b2de4b0d29fa4d0c5c6>
.

The Athens stock market has also been hit, and is currently around 1.5% lower. 
Economist Stuart Culverhouse at distressed debt broker Exotix told Reuters:

Markets are nervous that it could either delay progress on the subsequent 
reviews or lead to something more significant. I don’t think there is much of a 
risk of default in the very near term but clearly if it absents official 
financing then it becomes more of a concern.

Talks are due to restart today after a series of delays amid disagreements on 
the size of Greece’s fiscal gap and the progress on pension reforms and bad 
debts.

The review of the Greek bailout programme is expected to be completed by the 
end of April or early May, according to a spokesman for the German finance 
ministry.

But the Germans say a debt haircut is not on the agenda, Reuters is reporting, 
afterthe weekend’s leak about supposed IMF plans.

UK home construction growth slows down

Standard & Poor’s has repeated its  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/brexit-vote-would-affect-uks-top-credit-score-says-standard-and-poor>
earlier warning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/brexit-vote-would-affect-uks-top-credit-score-says-standard-and-poor>
 that Britain could lose its much-prized AAA rating if the country votes to 
leave the European Union.

Writing an opinion piece on the Politico website, 
<http://www.politico.eu/article/opinion-brexit-puts-uks-aaa-rating-at-risk-says-sp-ratings-chief/>
 S&P’s chief sovereign ratings officer Moritz Kraemer said:

When Britain last held a referendum on its European Union membership in 1975, 
the stakes were not nearly as high. The U.K. had joined the European community 
only two years earlier. But today, given the U.K.’s deep political, financial 
and trading ties in Europe, an exit would be much more fraught — and the risks, 
when it comes to its credit worthiness, are therefore considerably higher.

While Brexit supporters share a collective skepticism about the “European 
experiment,” they lack consensus on what Britain’s trading options and 
political alliances will look like outside of the EU. If the Brexit camp wins 
the vote on June 23, the U.K. would enter a protracted period of uncertainty 
while its people debate the alternative. Markets dislike uncertainty — 
especially protracted uncertainty — and this “working out” period will likely 
have adverse credit consequences for the U.K...

Brexit would further polarize the U.K.’s political system, increase risks to 
effective, transparent and predictable policymaking, and diminish the U.K.’s 
long-term sovereign creditworthiness. Brexit also heightens potential risks to 
economic growth and the balance of payments, as well as domestic political 
threats to territorial integrity.

Consequently, a vote for “Leave” would likely lead Standard & Poor’s to lower 
the U.K.’s AAA rating — a rating it has held, without interruption, since 1978. 
While the U.K.’s rating would likely remain high given its many institutional, 
financial and economic strengths, the U.K. would lose its place in the 
increasingly exclusive club of AAA-rated sovereigns.
 
The falls in the eurozone unemployment rate could slow down in the coming 
months, says Bert Colijn at ING Bank:

While dark clouds packed over the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the 
year, the labour market has continued to provide tailwind. The improvements in 
unemployment continue to fuel domestic demand in times when consumers have 
become more cautious. This will likely mitigate the negative effects of people 
more concerned about the state of the global economy.The improvements are not 
evenly spread across the Eurozone though. France and Italy saw the number of 
unemployed increase in February, although in France this did not lead to a 
higher unemployment rate. Germany and Spain saw unemployment decline again, 
with the unemployment rate in Spain falling from 20.5% to 20.4%. The continued 
struggle to reduce unemployment in France and Italy will likely have a 
dampening effect on domestic demand in the coming months.

While the labour market continues to improve, unemployment is known to be a 
lagging indicator. Surveys have recently indicated that employers are currently 
cautious to see how the market turmoil of the beginning of the year is playing 
out, which could result in more subdued hiring in the months ahead. The 
momentum of hiring is also not as strong as it was a few months back. The 
3-month decline in unemployment has fallen from over half a million in 
September, to 224 thousand in February. With employers being cautious, this 
could mean that the relatively high pace of declines in the Eurozone 
unemployment rate over the past year could be slowing down somewhat in the 
months ahead. With the unemployment rate still well above its natural rate, 
that is bad news for price pressures.
 
More data from the eurozone, with unemployment falling for a thirteenth 
successive month and producer prices dropping by more than expected in February.

The unemployment rate fell from 10.4% to 10.3% but the jobless decline of 
39,000 was the smallest drop since last May.

Producer prices fell by 0.7% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% 
decline.

Meanwhile Peter Praet, chief economist at the European Central Bank, said it 
was prepared to ease monetary policy further if inflation remained stubbornly 
low. He said at an event in Rome (quote from Reuters):

The prolonged period of low inflation we are in today has increased the risks 
that inflation misses might become persistent, which would be deeply damaging 
for the economy.

This is why we have reacted so forcefully to secure our objective - and will

s disappointing, says economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight:

This is a largely disappointing survey, which suggests that construction 
output was of little help to GDP growth in the first quarter. Latest hard data 
show that construction output disappointingly dipped 0.2% month-on-month and 
0.8% in January, marking a soft start to 2016.

The government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth 
almost ground to a halt in March when it was at its weakest level since January 
2013 - given that it is looking to address the UK’s acute housing shortage.

With the corresponding manufacturing survey also weak for March, first quarter 
GDP growth again looks to have been heavily dependent on the services sector – 
so much attention will be focused on the purchasing managers survey for the 
services sector for March that comes out on Tuesday, especially as the February 
survey was at a near three-year low.

Furthermore, there is not much in the survey to indicate that the construction 
sector’s fortunes are going to pick up in the near term as it shows orders 
growth at an 11-,month low, business expectations stuck at the lowest level 
since December 2014 and employment growth at the lowest level since mid-2013.

The construction sector is seemingly currently being affected by increased 
caution among clients (especially for major projects) amid heightened UK and 
global economic uncertainties – and it notable that the purchasing managers 
indicated that clients are “unwilling to commit to new contracts or expand 
existing work”.

The looming 23 June referendum on UK membership of the EU adds to the 
uncertainties dogging the construction sector – especially given the tightness 
of opinion polls.

On a relatively encouraging note, the purchasing managers reported that 
“survey respondents cited a generally supportive economic backdrop”

Also on the positive side, there is increasing government support for 
housebuilding (which needs to see prolonged decent expansion to make genuine 
inroads into the UK’s acute housing shortage). In November’s Autumn Statement, 
the Chancellor announced plans to double the housing budget to over £2 billion 
a year and to build 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade. 
Additionally, the government has announced measures aimed at speeding up the 
planning system and reducing the obstacles to building new houses.
 
Eurozone investor confidence has risen but by less than expected. The Sentix 
index came in at 5.7, up from 5.5 but below the forecast of 6.9.
