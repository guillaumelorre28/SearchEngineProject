The chief minister of the Australian Capital Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-capital-territory>, Katy 
Gallagher, will resign from her position in order to enter federal politics.


Gallagher announced on Friday she would was seeking to fill the Senate vacancy 
created by the departure of the ACT Labor senator Kate Lundy.

“Because of my decision and out of respect for the office of chief minister I 
have informed my colleagues that I will be resigning as chief minister on 
Wednesday next week,” Gallagher said in a statement.

“After much consideration I have decided that I can use the skills I have 
gained in my time as chief minister to step into the federal arena to stand up 
forCanberra <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/canberra>, defend our 
city and be a strong local voice for our nation’s capital.

“This job has never been more important than now. This has been a very 
difficult decision for me. I love the job of chief minister and it has been an 
absolute privilege to serve the people of the ACT in that capacity over the 
last three and a half years.”

Gallagher was elected to the ACT legislative assembly in 2001 and entered the 
territory ministry a year later. The Labor member became chief minister in May 
2011.

Her announcement followed a decision by Lundy to step down from the Senate. 
Lundy said last week that she would not contest the next election and would 
“work with the ACT ALP to ensure a smooth transition over the next six months”.
