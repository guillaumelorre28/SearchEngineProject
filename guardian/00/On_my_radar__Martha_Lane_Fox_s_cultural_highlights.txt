 Crawick Multiverse: ‘It combines art and science in a fabulous way.’ 
This is a massive piece of landscape art that represents the entire known 
universe and beyond in an old coal mine in Scotland. It combines art and 
science in a fabulous way as well as providing an extraordinary place for a 
fairly disadvantaged community. It’s probably a mile long, and there are mounds 
that represent bits of the universe: the Milky Way, Andromeda, the multiverse 
itself (this latest notion in cosmology is about us being a part of many 
universes at once). But more than that, it’s a beautiful landscape, designed by 
my stepfather,Charles Jencks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/jun/23/charles-jencks-gardens-in-pictures>
, and built using what was there already: big green mountains, huge open 
expanses. There’s also an amphitheatre, so there can be performances on an
omphalos – the ancient Greek tradition of a belly button in the centre of 
everything.

 Alice Oswald: ‘She brings another dimension to your understanding of the 
original poem.’ 
This poem is such a knockout. It’s her interpretation of The Iliad: she takes 
out 90% of the plot and just focuses on the soldiers who fell during the 
battles. It really brings another dimension to my understanding of the original 
poem. I remember the first time I read it, it was that brilliant luxury of 
having an afternoon in my sitting room at home and reading it through and being 
in complete tears by the end. Just having an amazingly profound experience, 
randomly on a Saturday afternoon. I read her poemDart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview13>
, about the river, first. I think it was my mum – she’s brilliant at everything 
and always putting things into my hand – who gave it to me, and then I gave it 
to everybody else.

 Isa Genzken: ‘Her work combines installation, sculpture, painting and drawing.’
Isa Genzken is a fabulously interesting feminist artist who combines lots of 
different things: installation, sculpture, paintings, drawings. This exhibition 
looks at how she has constructed lots of her paintings. She has experimented 
with different art forms: photography, film, video; these are paintings that 
she has built up about landscape and architecture. I’ve always thought that she 
is a very remarkable woman: she was married toGerhard Richter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gerhard-richter>, so you can imagine 
what incredibly interesting conversations they must have had in their household.

 Medea at the Almeida: ‘The Greek dramas are about everything – politics, 
family, women, war.’ 
I enjoy Rachel Cusk’s novels and it’s always interesting when people move 
between media, so I’m looking forward to seeing what she does withMedea. It’s 
not until September but I think we need to get our tickets now. At the minute, 
there’s a resurgence of Greek plays. I did ancient history, Latin and Greek, so 
I love seeing these things coming back in. I wonder what it is that we’re 
searching for. I think sometimes, in periods of confusion and complexity, we 
look back for inspiration. We go back to the absolute clarity and humanity at 
the centre of these extraordinary Greek dramas, which are about pretty much 
everything: politics, family, women, children, war. The original playwrights 
address all of these huge themes, and they do it with extreme clarity of 
thought.

 Kovert: ‘It’s jewellery, a website and a way of life.’ 
This is technically a piece of jewellery, but it’s also a website and a way of 
life. It’s by a brilliant young computer scientist called Kate Unsworth. She 
thinks we need to reinvent our lives around being detached from the internet – 
so rather than an iWatch, which notifies you constantly about everything that’s 
happening, you use a very subtle, beautiful-looking USB gemstone, which you 
link via bluetooth to your smartphone, and only when something very important 
pings into your phone will your gemstone give you a little nudge. You programme 
it so that it only pings when, say, your boyfriend or best friend get in touch. 
It’s a carefully constructed way of having a bit of a digital separation from 
the madness of being connected to your smartphone all the time.

 Mary Shelley: ‘A hero to any woman.’ 
This is about the lives of Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley, mother and 
daughter. I’ve always been absolutely fascinated by the family tree that starts 
withWilliam Godwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview28>
, who was a huge influence on me when I read his writings when I was a youngish 
woman. And obviously Mary Wollstonecraft is a hero to any woman and Mary 
Shelley is pretty much the same. I’d never read a combined biography of the 
pair of them and this looks fantastic. It goes behind the scenes of these two 
women. I’ve just read the first chapter, but it’s really sharp and vivid about 
their extraordinary relationship.
