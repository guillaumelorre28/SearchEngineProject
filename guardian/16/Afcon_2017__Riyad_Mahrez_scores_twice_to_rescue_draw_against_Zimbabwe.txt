Algeria twice hit the woodwork before levelling, first through a Ramy 
Bensebaini header and when Zimbabwe defender Elisha Muroiwa narrowly avoided an 
own goal when he sliced a clearance.

Kuda Mahachi made it 1-1 just four minutes after Mahrez’s opening goal, and 
Nyasha Mushekwi’s penalty on 30 minutes put Zimbabwe ahead. Algeria surged 
forward in the last 10 minutes and Mahrez’s long-range shot found a way past 
goalkeeper Tatenda Mukuruva.

The Desert Foxes could have snatched victory, when Mukuruva came flying out 
and left his goal wide open but Yacine Brahimi could not take advantage, as 
Zimbabwe, making their first appearance at the tournament finals since 2006, 
held on for the draw.

The result followed hosts Gabon being surprisingly held 1-1 by outsiders and 
tournament debutants Guinea-Bissau
