An 18-year-old reached out apparently to slap former prime minister Manuel 
Valls <https://www.theguardian.com/world/manuel-valls> when he was on an 
election tour in France’s Brittany region on Tuesday and was wrestled to the 
ground by a security guard, a video by local media showed.

Valls, 54, who was walking past a group of people in the town of Lamballe 
after coming out of the municipal offices, appeared to first shake hands with 
the youth who said something and then appeared to try to slap the former prime 
minister.

As Valls recoiled, a security guard seized the youth in a choke-hold, pushed 
him back against a fence and then forced him to the ground, the video aired by 
Le Telegramme showed.

Police said later that the youth was aged 18 and had been detained. 

Valls, who is running in the left’s primaries on Sunday to be a candidate for 
president, did not appear to have been hurt.

Valls, speaking to local reporters shortly after the incident, said: “I have 
never been afraid of having contact with French people. Democracy can never 
mean violence.”
