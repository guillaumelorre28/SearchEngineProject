Although it’s routinely placed at the top of lifestyle rankings, Zurich is 
rarely, if ever, rated as one of Europe’s cultural capitals. There’s a 
perception that it’s a bankers’ city – a Swiss Square Mile without any West End 
to escape into. While it is true that high salaries and a strong currency mean 
Switzerland’s biggest city is expensive for visitors, with some planning, and a 
focus on culture instead of cuisine, it makes for an enjoyable break, whether 
or not it is made part of a skiing holiday.

The city boasts cultural big-hitters including the Kunsthaus (see below), one 
of Europe’s great modern art museums, and Museum Haus Konstruktiv (
hauskonstruktiv.ch <http://hauskonstruktiv.ch/>), which showcases “concrete, 
constructive and conceptual art” in a former electricity substation.Zurich-West 
<https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/attractions/zurich-west>, a former industrial 
district, is a hub for contemporary art, design, food and architecture. The 
whole city is relatively car-free and bike-friendly.

The city has great rail and bus connections to many of the country’s stellar 
ski resorts, and great sledging on the Ütliberg, Zurich’s own small mountain 
(870 metres); once the snow melts, the latter is a popular hiking and 
mountain-biking spot.

From this month, Zurich will be celebrating the centenary of the Dada 
movement, which came into being on 5 February 1916 with the opening of the 
Cabaret Voltaire nightclub. War was raging across Europe and the Swiss city was 
a haven for pacifists, exiles, artists and dropouts. Dada principals Tristan 
Tzara, Hugo Ball and Francis Picabia kicked off a movement that influenced 
surrealism, beat poetry, the US’s 1960s “downtown music” scene and pop art.

From 5 February to 18 July, Cabaret Voltaire <http://www.cabaretvoltaire.ch/> 
will host165 Days of Feast 
<http://www.cabaretvoltaire.ch/tl_files/cabaretvoltaire/presse/pressemitteilungen/dada100_cabaret%20voltaire_Pressetext%2016.9.2015_EN.pdf>
, which looks at the ideas behind 165 Dada-related poets, visionaries and 
thinkers in a cycle of performances, readings and other events, including aDada 
“mass” honouring Lady Gaga 
<https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/events/165-days-of-feast>.

From 5 February until 1 May, the Kunsthaus hosts Dadaglobe Reconstructed 
<http://www.kunsthaus.ch/en/exhibitions/coming-soon/dadaglobereconstructed>, an 
exhibition of self-portraits, photomontages, drawings, book designs, poems and 
essays sent to Tzara in 1921. TheNational Museum 
<http://www.nationalmuseum.ch/e/index.php>, Museum Haus Konstruktiv and Museum 
Rietberg <http://www.rietberg.ch/de-ch/home.aspx> will host art shows, and 
Zurich’s main railway station will put on a dance event on 13 May.

The city is also hosting Manifesta <http://manifesta11.org/en>, a roving 
biennial contemporary art festival. The very Swiss-sounding theme is What 
People Will Do for Money, and shows and talks promise to debate and deconstruct 
Zurich’s prowess in finance, tech and urbanism.

The Dada centenary is also a celebration of art over real estate. After its 
brief moment of glory in 1916, the Cabaret Voltaire building was left to decay, 
serving a variety of commercial uses until, in 2002, it was occupied in protest 
at plans by owner Swiss Life to convert it into luxury apartments. The squat 
was a success and, two years later, it reopened as a cool cultural space in the 
otherwise quaint and bourgeois Old Town.

 – up the hill towards the zoo (Zürich Zoologischer Garten

Guildhalls (self-guided walk)
In 1336, Zurich’s first independent mayor, Rudolf Brun, established the guild 
laws, effectively shifting power from the abbeys in favour of the merchant 
nobility. The city’s commercial clout was established there and then. The 
handsome guildhalls 
<http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/historic-guilds-houses-in-the-old-town-of-zurich.html>
 (zunfthäuser) lend themselves to a walking tour. See the bakers’ guild 
(Oberdorfstrasse 20) and then go down to the east bank of the river to see the 
guilds of the carpenters, builders and wainwrights, the food and wine dealers, 
and the textiles and spice merchants at numbers 40, 52 and 54 Limmatquai, 
respectively. In the same area – close to the Rathaus (town hall) – are 
guildhalls for black-, silver- and goldsmiths (Marktgasse 20) and tailors 
(Stüssihofstatt 3); over the river are the mansions of the weavers (Münsterhof 
8) and saddlemakers, painters and winemakers (Münsterhof 20).

Stained glass windows
There are beautiful windows created by artist Marc Chagall in 1967 at the 
Fraumünster church <https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/attractions/fraumuenster>; 
Sigmar Polke’s windows in theGrossmünster 
<http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/grossmuenster-zuerich.html> are also 
stunning.

Cabaret Voltaire
A great place for sipping absinthe among Dada’s ghosts, the space also has a 
shop selling souvenirs and art-themed gifts. Entrance to the space is free but 
there will be a charge for any special exhibitions and shows during the Dada 
centenary.

Conditorei Schober 
At this mid-19th century grand cafe, the thick carpets and baroque interior 
calm even the kick of a double espresso. It’s great for pastries, too.

Did you know?

One early Dadaist often omitted from the history books (and sadly also from 
the list of 165 legends for the centennial festival) is Cyril Seaton, a lace 
pattern designer from Nottingham who, via Lille and the trenches at Verdun, 
found himself hanging out at Cabaret Voltaire with the artists and even 
performing “sound poetry” (nonsense verse) using a megaphone. George Melly 
called him “the sexy surrealist from naughty Nottingham”. Read about himhere
