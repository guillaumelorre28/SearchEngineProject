Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

 I recently lost my job as a senior manager in manufacturing. I have vast 
experience in facilities management but it is 10 years out of date. Now that I 
am nearer 50 I feel I am a jack of all trades and master of none.

 I have considered retraining but can’t afford not to work. I’ve also 
considered being self-employed but that frightens me more.

 My question is this: are career development agencies worth the money and what 
will they actually do to help?

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a 
brief email todear.jeremy@theguardian.com <mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com>.
