The fallout from the Brexit vote dominated our business coverage in 2016, led 
by Graeme Wearden and his daily live blog.


Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock referendum 
result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the plummeting pound and 
the prospect of negative interest rates.


There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from 
economists in January to “sell everything” before a new crash.

 Based on the number of page views, here are our 10 most popular business

With more than 2m page views, our live blog of the aftermath of Trump’s 
election victory was the most-read business article of the year.


Our teams in New York, London and Sydney tracked the initial panic as it swept 
through world markets, followed by an extraordinary rally. Shares in private 
prison groups and gun makers did particularly well on Wall Street. There were 
warnings of trouble ahead, but traders appeared to pay no heed.

Friday 24 June brought shock, horror and sheer panic to trading floors around 
the world. Wearden and Nick Fletcher covered it all in an 18-hour live blog of 
the turmoil that greeted Britain’s decision to leave the EU.


It was an extraordinary day’s trading. More than $2tn was slashed from the 
value of global markets and sterling suffered its biggest selloff in recent 
history.


The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, stepped up with a promise to take 
any measures necessary, but economists said the Brexit vote had left Britain on 
the brink of a recession that would reverberate around the world.

In January economists at RBS issued an apocalyptic warning that stock markets 
could crash by 20% and oil prices slump to $16 a barrel. “Sell everything 
except high quality bonds,” they said.


China could be the crisis point, they argued. Their numbers were wrong but 
they were right when they said it would be a “cataclysmic” year. Just as well 
they didn’t know then about Brexit and Donald Trump.

In the turbulent aftermath of the EU referendum result, as the pound hit 
31-year lows and shares tumbled again, Britain was stripped of its last AAA 
credit rating.

Standard & Poor’s downgraded the nation’s creditworthiness to AA, with a 
negative outlook. The agency said Brexit would hit growth and had weakened the 
predictability, stability and effectiveness of policymaking in the UK.

Oxfam’s annual analysis of how global wealth is (not) shared always makes grim 
reading. Its analysis in 2016 was timed to coincide with the gathering of many 
of the world’s superrich at Davos, and the figures laid bare the vast gap 
between rich and poor.


The charity called for urgent action to tackle the growing inequality that saw 
the wealth of the poorest half of the world’s population drop by 41% between 
2010 and 2015, while the wealth of the planet’s richest 62 people jumped by 
$500bn to $1.76tn.

The fallout from the Brexit vote continued to reverberate through the markets, 
as City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the 
Bank of England said risks to the financial system had begun to crystallise.

The then chancellor, George Osborne, held a summit with the heads of the major 
high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans 
available.

referendum. Six months on, we’re still waiting.


The leading economist Mohamed El-Erian, meanwhile, piled on the pain for the 
battered pound, saying it could slump to parity with the dollar.

chains would carry a red warning if they were forced to label them.


Some hot chocolate and other trendy chai drinks contained staggering amounts 
of sugar, up to 25 teaspoons, in one serving.

Nat West bank raised the spectre of negative interest rates, telling its 
business customers it might have to charge to accept deposits.

The bank, which is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland and so owned by the 
taxpayer, issued its warning in a letter changing the terms and conditions for 
its 850,000 business customers, which range from self-employed traders to 
clubs, charities and large corporations.
