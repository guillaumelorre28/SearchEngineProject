, home of the defunct Bethlehem Steel mill and one of only 209 counties in the 
US to vote for Trump after voting for Barack Obama twice. Northampton has been 
climbing back since the steel plant closed in the mid-1990s, but some locals 
say the new jobs can’t compare with the proud work at the mill, and residents 
describe a sense of untapped potential. McCarthy wanted to know what moved 
voters, and what Trump supporters hoped the new president would do about jobs, 
healthcare and immigration – and how they hoped he would restore what some 
described as a lost way of life. McCarthy will ask voters whether they feel 
that Trump has delivered: is America on its way to being great again? McCarthy 
has invited readers to contribute to, guide and help shape this series.
