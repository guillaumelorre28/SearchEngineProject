of his career in an interview with the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, which 
stated “events in his family” had caused him to turn down a lucrative offer 
from Asia worth £11m a season.

He told the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser on Tuesday that he is just taking 
a sabbatical after leaving Old Trafford last May, although he admitted 
retirement was a still a possibility.

“Whether I continue or not will also depend on the offers I get,” Van Gaal 
said. “I’ve coached many clubs and I think it’s very difficult to improve on 
that level of clubs. It’s not true I’ve retired, not at this moment, but I’ll 
decide at the end of my sabbatical, next June or July.”

He also admitted he rejected the chance to manage Valencia last month. Van 
Gaal has not worked since leading United to victory overCrystal Palace in the
