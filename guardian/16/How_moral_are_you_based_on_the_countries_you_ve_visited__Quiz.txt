Moral values are notoriously tricky to measure. But the findings of a 2016 
study conducted atINSEAD Business School 
<https://www.insead.edu/executive-education?CampaignId=GGL_Search_A&SiteId=GGL&AdId=BRAND&device=c&term=insead%20business%20school&gclid=CKiNwbf9tNECFRG6GwodyfoA2A>
 suggest a surprisingly simple way to do so. From the list below tick off all 
the countries you have visited:

France, USA, Spain, Italy, China, UK, Russia, Mexico, Canada, Germany, 
Austria, Poland, Hungary, Greece, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, 
Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, 
Israel, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, 
South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Turkey, Macau, Cyprus, Malaysia, Dominican 
Republic, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Senegal, Namibia, Australia.

What does this say about your morals?
0-5: a paragon of virtue
6-10: about average
11-20: a little slippery
20-50: Dick Dastardly

In a study of more than 600 Montreal residents, researchers found that the 
more countries a participant had ticked off, the more likely they were to cheat 
on a computerised trivia quiz. Researchers also found that high-school students 
were more likely to cheat after rather than before taking part in a 
study-abroad programme. The researchers suggest that the more we are immersed 
in foreign cultures, the more we come to view morality as relative rather than 
absolute. It’s not all bad news, though: previous studies associate overseas 
travel with increased creativity and decreased prejudice; so don’t cancel that 
spring break just yet.
