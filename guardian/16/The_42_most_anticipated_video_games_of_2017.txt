Every new year brings with it the promise of astonishing video games, but what 
does 2017 have in store? Will this be a vintage year?

From returning legends to innovative new projects, there’s an impressive 
amount of fascinating stuff on the way – and we’ve tried to cram in everything, 
including big budget sequels, unexpected offshoots and tiny independent 
projects.

If we’ve somehow overlooked your highlight of the coming year, let us know in 
the comments section!

 Magical realist adventure … 29 by Humble Grove. Photograph: Humble Grove 
Described as a magical realist adventure, 29 is set within a single flat 
(actually owned by the game’s development team), and follows the lives of its 
inhabitants as they prepare to move out and move on with their lives. Beautiful 
visuals and atmosphere.

 Haunting … Below. Photograph: Capybara Games 
The latest project from Toronto-based studio Capybara Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> (Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery 
EP, Super Time Force), is an overhead-view adventure game, where players 
explore a mysterious island riddled with caves. The roguelike structure and 
sharp, minimalist visuals promise a haunting – and demanding – experience.

It feels like we’ve been waiting years for this beautiful side-scrolling

hand-drawn characters, painted backgrounds and a vintage jazz soundtrack, it’s 
a remarkably faithful tribute to the era.

 A zombie game, but not as we know it … Days Gone. Photograph: Sony 
Yes, it’s another apocalyptic zombie game, but this time, rather than a 
straightforward narrative adventure, players get a vast open world to explore 
and survive in, crafting tools and developing strategies to deal with vast 
swarms of intelligent monsters. It looks astonishing too.

Everyone knows Bungie is working on a full sequel to its 2014 online shooter 
after a series of major expansion packs – but that’s essentially all we know. 
After the studio advertised a number of narrative designer roles last year, the 
expectation is for a major story overhaul, with regular plot updates added 
through the year. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, the lead designers onThe 
Taken King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/22/destiny-taken-king-review-finally-good-game>
, are believed to be in charge.According to Eurogamer 
<http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-09-28-destiny-2-will-launch-for-pc-characters-may-be-left-behind-reports>
, social areas will now include an element of gunplay, breaking down the 
barriers between different facets of the game.

The futuristic gravity-manipulating adventure is returning with a more 
detailed and interactive city and two new types of gravity power. Lead 
character Kat can now also tag-team with her ally Raven as they investigate the 
weird gravitational waves messing up Hekseville. The original was a trippy and 
visually arresting treat – let’s hope that’s not turned on its head with the 
sequel.

Tegroeg 
Imagine Where’s Wally set in a hand-drawn monochromatic and highly animated 
world filled with life and detail – that’s Hidden Folks. Each of the areas has 
a number of people and items to find, and players often have to open doors, or 
move objects to locate them, making this a beautifully tactile experience.

The game that will see out the Wii U and welcome in the Nintendo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> Switch is an epic rethinking 
of the Zelda recipe with an open world, a full physics engine and an intriguing 
survival element. Link will have to find food, items and weapons to progress

Zelda arguably ruled last year’s E3 and it could be the critical hit of 2017.

 Frenzied fun … Nidhogg 2. Photograph: Messhof Games 
The original two-player sword-fighting game was a minimalist masterpiece, its 
sparse pixelated backdrops and pure fencing action providing a tense and 
exciting competition. The sequel amps up the graphical fidelity and combat 
options considerably, giving a new, almost cartoonish look. It’s been a 
controversial move, butthe trailer <https://youtu.be/dtbyuqgdCtQ> promises a 
whole heap off frenzied fun.

 Smart and funny … Night in the Woods. Photograph: Finji 
College dropout Mae Borowski returns to the sleepy town she grew up in and 
finds a familiar collection of misfits, weirdos and old routines – but there is 
also something new hiding out there in the woods. This side-scrolling adventure 
is populated entirely by anthropomorphised animals, and the smart, funny 
dialogue makes it feel like Twin Peaks, Gilmore Girls and a really smart Pixar 
animation rolled into one interactive independent movie.

Another post-apocalyptic survival game, this time a turn-based strategy set in 
the aftermath of an alien invasion. Players must manage small groups of 
survivors as they travel across the country, looting burned out cars, fighting 
monsters and just keeping each other alive. The simple mechanics hide a 
tactically complex challenge filled with difficult decisions and horrible 
sacrifices. Incredibly engrossing.

 Wild expectation … Shenmue 3. Photograph: YS Net 
Sony almost broke the internet when this long-awaited close to Yu Suzuki’s 
adventure trilogy was announced at E3 in 2015. Following a total of $6m raised 
through crowdfunding, the game is hopefully on track for release late this 
year, following vengeful hero Ryo Hazuki to China where he continues the hunt 
for his father’s killer, Lan Di. But can it really live up to all that wild 
expectation?

Developed for a studio game jam, the team at Sumo immediately saw the appeal 
of this slithery platform adventure game and put it into production. You 
control the eponymous serpent, getting to grips with a uniquely physical

Billed as a cross between Syndicate and Grand Theft Auto, Tokyo 42 presents an 
isometric vision of Tokyo in the near future; a cyberpunk dreamscape of modular 
skyscrapers, flying cars and bloody shootouts. The player is an assassin, 
navigating the crowds and street gangs to take out a series of targets; but 
it’s the detailed tilt-shift environments that have really blown us away.

 Tense and exciting … Ghost Recon Wildlands. Photograph: Ubisoft 
Set in a Bolivia swamped with powerful drug cartels, the newest Ghost Recon 
sends its high-tech Ghost soldiers in to the open-world environment to restore 
order and shoot lots of people. Once again, the emphasis is on tactics and 
technology, with stealth, recon drones and day/night cycles all figuring into 
every mission. The four-player co-op mode adds team-based strategising to the 
tense and exciting mix.
Release: 7 March

 Cinematic … Uncharted The Lost Legacy. Photograph: Sony 
Oh you didn’t think we’d seen the last of this series did you? This side story 
follows ruthless treasure hunter (and Nathan Drake ex) Chloe Frazer as she 
teams up with Nadine Ross from Uncharted 4 to track down an ancient Indian 
artefact. We can expect the usual mix of cinematic narrative, puzzle solving 
and falling off narrow walkways.

 Blood-sucking on the streets of London … Vampyr. Photograph: Focus Home 
Interactive 
A gothic vampire tale set in foggy London town just after the First World War, 
this action adventure is a far cry from Dontnod’s previous game,Life is Strange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnod>
. Players take on the role of freshly turned blood sucker Jonathan Reid who 
must now stalk the streets of the city choosing fresh victims. The choices he 
makes have an effect on the story, and he must ensure he doesn’t bleed any 
areas of the city completely dry. Meanwhile, a battle rages between ultra 
violent vampire hunters and a mutated breed of the undead called the The Skulls.

In which Journey producer Robin Hunicke and Katamari Damacy creator Keita 
Takahashi team up and develop one of the strangest, most instantly loveable 
games of this year – or indeed any year. There is a weird landscape where 
characters hold hands, hug and transform into other things, and you’re the 
mayor – your job is to nurture life and solve puzzles. That may involve playing 
football with a toilet or dancing with mushrooms. You have to see it to believe 
it. It’s exquisite.

 Fiendish puzzles and cute critters … Yooka-Laylee. Photograph: Playtonic 
In 2015, the creative leads behind classic Rare titles like Donkey Kong 
Country and Banjo-Kazooie set up their own studio and started planning a new 
character-based comic book adventure, with fresh heroes and modern visuals, but 
familiar game design ideas and principles. Yooka-Laylee is the heartwarming 
result. Vast worlds, fiendish puzzles, cute critters. Yes please.
