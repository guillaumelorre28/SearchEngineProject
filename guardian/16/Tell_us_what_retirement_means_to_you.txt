With nearly one in seven Britons over 75 by 2040, according to a report by the 
Resolution foundation thinktank, Guardian senior reporter Amelia Hill will be 
travelling across Britain to investigate the changing nature of retirement, and 
how it affects you - from your hopes and fears to your plans and experiences.


This project, which we’re calling The new retirement, is part of an experiment 
in collaborative reporting. Amelia is interested in what you think – and 
invites you to contribute to, guide and help shape this series as it considers 
the wider challenges of an ageing population and a younger generation 
struggling to save for retirement.

How you can help

It’s only by listening to you that we can fully understand what “the new 
retirement” means for different generations. To start the series, we’d like to 
hear your suggestions for topics or issues you think Amelia should investigate. 
Part two of the series, which we will be publishing on 23 January, will be all 
about money. So whether you are currently retired, considering retirement, or 
working out whether it will ever be a possibility let us know by filling in the 
form below.
