Closing summary

Just over six hours after Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> began her much-touted speech 
on Brexit, it’s time for a summary of what we’ve learned today.

 * May has set out her Brexit plans over 12 points in a speech at Lancaster 
House in London. Key among these was a commitment for the UK to leave the EU’s 
single market 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e098de4b00b8fc2ae15c3#block-587e098de4b00b8fc2ae15c3>
, and that MPs and peerswill get a final vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e0753e4b0f0efb00f4c27#block-587e0753e4b0f0efb00f4c27>
 on the deal. 
 * Other elements of the speech included that the UK would not be a full 
member of the customs union, but would hope to strike some sort of tariff-free 
deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e0aace4b01065cf59755d#block-587e0aace4b01065cf59755d>
, and continue tocooperate over areas

 like crime and anti-terrorism. 
 * May said that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal”, raising the 
possibility of the UK leaving the EU on default World Trade Organisation rules. 
 * She also reiterated Philip Hammond’s threat that if the EU failed to offer 
a good deal, the UK could move to become a low-tax regime to poach investment. 
 * May said she hoped to guarantee the continued rights of overseas EU citizens
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/17/deal-citizens-rights-full-eu-theresa-may-brexit-referendum>
 in the UK but that a handful of countries had still not yet offered a 
reciprocal deal for UK nationals. 
 * Downing Street later confirmed 
<https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/821339878571081728> that May’s 
speech formed the entirety of the government’s promised Brexit plan, meaning 
there will be no white paper on the proposed deal.

 * May’s spokeswoman also said that the parliamentary vote would not stop 
Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e4af2e4b0f0efb00f4dd9#block-587e4af2e4b0f0efb00f4dd9>
, raising the likelihood that if MPs turned down the eventual deal the UK would 
leave the EU under WTO trade rules. 
 * Political reaction to the speech saw Jeremy Corbyn said May wanted to turn 
the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7#block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7>
 into a “bargain basement tax haven”, while his Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer,
said he took it to mean

 the government was ruling out a hard Brexit. 
 * The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said May had 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/17/leave-remain-theresa-may-single-market-brexit-liberal-democrats>
 outlined “Nigel Farage’s vision of Britain’s relationship with Europe”.

Guy Verhofstadt, who will lead on Brexit talks for the European parliament, 
has taken to Twitter to give is slightly sceptical reaction to May’s speech:
Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt) 
Britain has chosen a hard Brexit. May's clarity is welcome—but the days of UK 
cherry-picking andEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> a la 
cart are over.

Threatening to turn the UK into a deregulated tax heaven will not only hurt 
British people—it is a counterproductive negotiating tactic

May must take the concerns of the 48% on board. The current lack of clarity 
for UK citizens in the UK & vice versa is disrupting many lives

This is Peter Walker taking over from Andrew. I’ve just been to the afternoon 
lobby briefing, where May’s spokeswoman gave no new information as such about 
the speech, but did formally confirm a couple of points.

The first is that while parliament will get a vote on the final deal, that 
definitely does not open the possibility of Brexit being reversed or 
renegotiated.

We will be having a negotiation. The outcome MPs will have an opportunity to 
vote on that... Whatever happens, we will be leaving the EU.

That appears to mean that MPs will have an effective choice of agreeing to 
May’s final deal, or rejecting it and seeing the UK face a “cliff edge” exit 
onto WTO trade rules, not likely to be hugely palatable.

We are also not going to see specifics of how May’s threatened low tax, low 
regulation economy if a deal cannot be reached might actually look. After if 
the prime minister would outline anything on this, her spokeswoman said:

We’re focused on more trade, more work with other countries. That’s what in 
all of our interests, and we’re going to go after that ambitious, bold 
relationship.

And finally - if it needed reiterating – May is not about to allow Scotland a 
special deal to stay in the EU’s single market:

We have been very clear that we are negotiating the United Kingdom’s exit from 
the EU, as the United Kingdom.

Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service, told 
the Guardian that the speech contained no big surprises except the proposal for 
“a bizarre customs union” with the EU, which, he said, would not be allowed 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the trade pact that falls 
under the World Trade Organisation. “The GATT/WTO would not allow such thing, 
neither the EU,” he said in emailed comments. “Ask Turkey.”

Turkey has a customs deal in goods with the EU, but has to open its markets to 
any country with an EU trade deal, without having much say. Piris said:

Otherwise she is asking for the moon, which is normal at the starting of 
negotiations. She is logically requesting the vital period of transition the UK 
badly needs, and is affirming that the issue of the Irish borders shall be 
solved without saying how.

In her speech May said she wanted “a completely new customs agreement” but had 
an open mind about how to work this out. She suggested associated membership of 
the EU customs union or signing up to some elements of it.

Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for Political Economy, said 
the “only realistic option” for the UK was a free-trade agreement with the EU.

One cannot have half a customs union. That would break WTO rules. I think it 
is obvious the UK will have to leave all its current trade arrangements through 
the EU and start with a new agreement.

What she is probably nodding towards is an arrangement where there wouldn’t be 
tariffs introduced between the UK and the EU through a free-trade agreement.

Sylvie Goulard, a French liberal MEP, who closely follows Brexit, thought the 
prime minister struck a friendlier tone, compared to her party conference 
speech. The speech was “a PR communication for the rest of Europe”, the MEP, 
said, but the British prime minister’s threat to turn Britain into a low-tax 
island was unmistakable, she added.

“Blackmailing partners is never a good thing. Certain declarations have a 
certain tone, which is not nice,” she said, also referring to the chancellor 
Philip Hammond’s warning thatthe UK could become a low-tax haven for 
corporations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/15/philip-hammond-suggests-uk-outside-single-market-could-become-tax-haven>
.

The discussion on tax was “very worrying. As far as I know the UK is a member 
of the OECD and is committed in the G20 and OECD to tackle tax fraud, tax 
evasion and not to encourage tax avoidance. It would be very strange for the UK 
not to reflect its own commitments.”

She pointed out May’s speech also contained important omissions, with no 
direct reference tothe €60bn (£51bn) Brexit bill being prepared by EU Brexit 
negotiator Michel Barnier. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/eus-chief-divorce-negotiator-michel-barnier-to-make-first-brexit-statement>
 “This is her version of what a good deal would look like and there is still a 
lot of work to do.”

In her view, the speech clarified what kind of relationship the British 
government wanted with the EU, but left big questions open. On the single 
market, May’s desire for the “greatest possible access” was “not very clear”, 
while “grey areas” remained over what she wanted on the customs union and 
reciprocal rights for EU citizens.

This view was echoed by an EU source who said the speech brought clarity, by 
ruling out options, such as a Swiss model or Norway-style membership of the 
European Economic Area, while leaving many questions to be worked out. “It 
brings it into clearer focus and enables everyone to sit down and prepare for 
the negotiations with that tighter focus.”

One of the trickiest points for both sides will be agreeing a transition deal. 
EU negotiators have made clear that the UK cannot have a transition deal 
without accepting the writ of the European court of justice. “It is obviously 
going to very difficult. If it is the status quo or close to it, it is going to 
be very difficult for the UK to accept. If it is very different from the status 
quo, it may prejudge the outcome of the negotiations,” an outcome that would be 
unacceptable for the EU, the source said.

More from Italy. Asked about Theresa May’s remarks, one Italian government 
official said he doubted that the UK could be as strong outside the EU as it is 
in the EU.

“Good luck on being a ‘Global Britain’,” the official said.

Here, chosen relatively randomly, are three Twitter threads on the Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> speech that are interesting.

From Bruno Waterfield, the Times’ Brussels correspondent
Bruno Waterfield (@BrunoBrussels) 
1/3) Most of May’s speech chimes with what EU expects from A50 negotiations. 
BUT nothing on transition timing or type of FoM restrictions
 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821373378523267072> January 17, 2017
 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821373378523267072> Bruno Waterfield 
(@BrunoBrussels) 
2/2) EU sees divorce & political decision on final destination in A50 2 yrs 
with series of phased, sectoral agreements getting there
 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821373987829719040> January 17, 2017
 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821373987829719040> Bruno Waterfield 
(@BrunoBrussels) 
3/3) UK leaving EU common commercial policy. May flags possibility of special 
customs deal, EU looking into what that would involve
 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821374823083474944> January 17, 2017
 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821374823083474944> Bruno Waterfield 
(@BrunoBrussels) 
No big surprises or asks in May’s speech which overlaps with EU side’s view of 
how A50 talks will be structured

 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821375071600123906> Bruno Waterfield 
(@BrunoBrussels) 
Striking omissions were any details of restrictions, plans for Brexit 
migration system & silence on UK’s financial liabilities to EU

 <https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/821375366082293760> 
From Rob Ford, the politics professor
(((Rob Ford))) (@robfordmancs) 
I'm wondering if part of May's hard Brexit calculations reflect a gamble based 
on diffs in how public will attribute responsibility 1/?https://t.co/0HfcoBUqIY 
<https://t.co/0HfcoBUqIY>
 <https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821362298094841856> January 17, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821362298094841856> (((Rob Ford))) 
(@robfordmancs) 
2/? Seems v likely May believes voters will blame her & govt if Brexit does 
not reduce imm. Will be concl of her long HO tenure
 <https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821362564852514820> January 17, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821362564852514820> (((Rob Ford))) 
(@robfordmancs) 
She may think blame for any economic disruption will be easier to divert/shake 
off. Effects diffuse, complicated, many spread over yrs
 <https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821362762144157697> January 17, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821362762144157697> (((Rob Ford))) 
(@robfordmancs) 
3/?This might or might not be right. Voters clearly do hold govts to account 
for current econ conds, so if "hard Brexit" triggered recession

<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821362940146319360> (((Rob Ford))) 
(@robfordmancs) 
May would have major problem. If it triggered a slow puncture style gradual 
loss of investment, relative position, maybe not.

<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821363056194318336> (((Rob Ford))) 
(@robfordmancs) 
Either way, gamble may be "Voters will definitely blame me if I keep FoM to 
stay in single mkt. There's good change they *won't* blame me...

<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/821363217188454400> (((Rob Ford))) 
(@robfordmancs) 
for the disruptions of leaving single mkt". Gamble is between definite 
political hit and possible political hit.

From the Economist’s Jeremy Cliffe
Jeremy Cliffe (@JeremyCliffe) 
Extended talk of UK exceptionalism, calls for more versatile & imaginative 
EU... May wants to nudge EU27 in direction of Bruegel proposals
 <https://twitter.com/JeremyCliffe/status/821328649341243392> January 17, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/JeremyCliffe/status/821328649341243392> 
That is a reference to this plan from the Bruegel thinktank. 
<http://bruegel.org/2016/08/europe-after-brexit-a-proposal-for-a-continental-partnership/>
Jeremy Cliffe (@JeremyCliffe) 
Ie she wants EU27 to see Brexit as chance to create template for other 
countries unsuited to full membership: Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine etc

As I've been predicting for a while: May going for Canada option plus some 
paid-for services access

much for the things UK sells rEU (services)

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron poured scorn on the promise to give parliament a 
vote on the final deal and said the prime minister should commit to a 
referendum. “It means parliament, half of which is not elected, will get a say 
on a stitch-up deal of which we do not know the content and the British people 
won’t,” he said.

“No deal that Britain is going to get through this process is better than the 
one we’ve got now.”

Farron said May should give MPs and the public the choice to remain in the EU 
or accept the new relationship. “We will continue to fight for a referendum on 
the terms of the deal, and then if the British people choose to reject the deal 
that is done, we could stay in the EU,” he said.

“No prime minister who gave a monkey’s about the British people would leave 
those as our only two options. One option is bound to be retention of our 
membership of the EU, and then it would be an outrage if the British people 
didn’t have a say.”

Sandro Gozi, Italy’s undersecretary for European affairs, said May’s speech at 
least offered some clarity and certainty on the UK’s objectives.


“It is now finally clear what they want. They want to leave for good and they 
want a full Brexit,” he said, adding that one aspect of her speech surprised 
him.

“May said that the end process could not be that the UK would be half in and 
half out. And I find this comment surprising because that is the current state 
of the UK - that is the state they are withdrawing from,” he said, pointing to 
“so many exceptions” that have been made for the UK over decades to accommodate 
its demands.

Nobody wants revenge, nobody wants vengeance, we fully respect it as a British 
sovereign decision and we respect the approach on negotiations. Of course, 
losing an important member like the UK is a loss. It will be a bigger loss for 
the UK ... [the negotiation] will be a damage limitation process.

Gozi said the protection of rights for Italians living in the UK was Italy’s 
“number one” priority in the negotiations and that he believed May’s remarks on 
the topic - in which she said that guaranteeing a mutual agreement on citizens’ 
rights in the UK and in the EU was a priority - were positive.

German industry welcomed Theresa May’s speech for providing clarity but made 
clear that it believed a hard Brexit would do substantial damage to business 
ties between Britain and theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

Volker Treier, head of the German Chamber for Industry and Trade said that the 
speech had at last ended a debate about “cherry-picking” but that a “hard 
Brexit” would limit chances of growth “on both sides of the Channel”, with 
Great Britain likely to take a harder hit.

After Brexit is completed, German businesses are planning to reduce their 
economic investment on the island. Another consequence would be write-offs to 
the tune of billions, because German business had invested into Britain because 
of its membership of the single market. Such write-offs would then not be 
reinvested.

Leaving the single market and the customs union, Treier said, “lowered the 
economic attractiveness of the [British] island”.

To date, German companies have built up factories and businesses to the value 
of 120 billion euros. These companies employ around 400,000 people in Great 
Britain.

Sir Keir Starmer’s comment about Theresa May avoiding a hard Brexit (see 
2.27pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e235ce4b00b8fc2ae167a#block-587e235ce4b00b8fc2ae167a>
 is attracting criticism from some fellow opposition MPs.

Here is the Green MP Caroline Lucas.

Have a lot of respect for @Keir_Starmer <https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer> but

Answering questions on the Le Monde live blog, Philippe Bernard, Le Monde’s 
London correspondent said:

The prime minister’s declarations do not clear up the numerous uncertainties 
surrounding Brexit. She has outlined certain objectives, but nothing says they 
will be achieved by the end of the negotiations. The impossibility of seeing 
what the future holds continues to exasperate the City and if the performance 
of the British economy right now is much better than forecasts indicated, most

Just over six hours after Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> began her much-touted speech 
on Brexit, it’s time for a summary of what we’ve learned today.

 * May has set out her Brexit plans over 12 points in a speech at Lancaster 
House in London. Key among these was a commitment for the UK to leave the EU’s 
single market 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e098de4b00b8fc2ae15c3#block-587e098de4b00b8fc2ae15c3>
, and that MPs and peerswill get a final vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e0753e4b0f0efb00f4c27#block-587e0753e4b0f0efb00f4c27>
 on the deal. 
 * Other elements of the speech included that the UK would not be a full 
member of the customs union, but would hope to strike some sort of tariff-free 
deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e0aace4b01065cf59755d#block-587e0aace4b01065cf59755d>
, and continue tocooperate over areas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e0b2ae4b00b8fc2ae15ce#block-587e0b2ae4b00b8fc2ae15ce>
 like crime and anti-terrorism. 
 * May said that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal”, raising the 
possibility of the UK leaving the EU on default World Trade Organisation rules. 
 * She also reiterated Philip Hammond’s threat that if the EU failed to offer 
a good deal, the UK could move to become a low-tax regime to poach investment. 
 * May said she hoped to guarantee the continued rights of overseas EU citizens
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/17/deal-citizens-rights-full-eu-theresa-may-brexit-referendum>
 in the UK but that a handful of countries had still not yet offered a 
reciprocal deal for UK nationals. 
 * Downing Street later confirmed 
<https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/821339878571081728> that May’s 
speech formed the entirety of the government’s promised Brexit plan, meaning 
there will be no white paper on the proposed deal.

 * May’s spokeswoman also said that the parliamentary vote would not stop 
Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e4af2e4b0f0efb00f4dd9#block-587e4af2e4b0f0efb00f4dd9>
, raising the likelihood that if MPs turned down the eventual deal the UK would 
leave the EU under WTO trade rules. 
 * Political reaction to the speech saw Jeremy Corbyn said May wanted to turn 
the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7#block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7>

said he took it to mean

 the government was ruling out a hard Brexit. 
 * The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said May had 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/17/leave-remain-theresa-may-single-market-brexit-liberal-democrats>
 outlined “Nigel Farage’s vision of Britain’s relationship with Europe”.
 
Guy Verhofstadt, who will lead on Brexit talks for the European parliament, 
has taken to Twitter to give is slightly sceptical reaction to May’s speech:
Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt)

Twitter to challenge May on her choice of outlining her Brexit plan in a speech 
rather than to parliament.

We have a story giving details on the section of May’s speech in which she 
refused to offer immediate confirmation about the fate of overseas EU nationals 
living in the UK.

Deal on citizens' rights lacks full EU backing, May says
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/17/deal-citizens-rights-full-eu-theresa-may-brexit-referendum> 
This is Peter Walker taking over from Andrew. I’ve just been to the afternoon 
lobby briefing, where May’s spokeswoman gave no new information as such about 
the speech, but did formally confirm a couple of points.

The first is that while parliament will get a vote on the final deal, that 
definitely does not open the possibility of Brexit being reversed or 
renegotiated.

We will be having a negotiation. The outcome MPs will have an opportunity to 
vote on that... Whatever happens, we will be leaving the EU.

That appears to mean that MPs will have an effective choice of agreeing to 
May’s final deal, or rejecting it and seeing the UK face a “cliff edge” exit 
onto WTO trade rules, not likely to be hugely palatable.

We are also not going to see specifics of how May’s threatened low tax, low 
regulation economy if a deal cannot be reached might actually look. After if 
the prime minister would outline anything on this, her spokeswoman said:

We’re focused on more trade, more work with other countries. That’s what in 
all of our interests, and we’re going to go after that ambitious, bold 
relationship.

And finally - if it needed reiterating – May is not about to allow Scotland a 
special deal to stay in the EU’s single market:

We have been very clear that we are negotiating the United Kingdom’s exit from 
the EU, as the United Kingdom.

I’m finishing for the day now. My colleague Peter Walker will be taking over 
the blog from this point.
 
Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service, told 
the Guardian that the speech contained no big surprises except the proposal for 
“a bizarre customs union” with the EU, which, he said, would not be allowed 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the trade pact that falls 
under the World Trade Organisation. “The GATT/WTO would not allow such thing, 
neither the EU,” he said in emailed comments. “Ask Turkey.”

Turkey has a customs deal in goods with the EU, but has to open its markets to 
any country with an EU trade deal, without having much say. Piris said:

Otherwise she is asking for the moon, which is normal at the starting of 
negotiations. She is logically requesting the vital period of transition the UK 
badly needs, and is affirming that the issue of the Irish borders shall be 
solved without saying how.

In her speech May said she wanted “a completely new customs agreement” but had 
an open mind about how to work this out. She suggested associated membership of 
the EU customs union or signing up to some elements of it.

Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for Political Economy, said 
the “only realistic option” for the UK was a free-trade agreement with the EU.

One cannot have half a customs union. That would break WTO rules. I think it 
is obvious the UK will have to leave all its current trade arrangements through 
the EU and start with a new agreement.

What she is probably nodding towards is an arrangement where there wouldn’t be 
tariffs introduced between the UK and the EU through a free-trade agreement.
 
Here is the Guardian’s Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
correspondent Jon Henley discussing Theresa May’s speech.
Key points from Theresa May’s Brexit speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jan/17/key-points-from-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-video-analysis> 
Sylvie Goulard, a French liberal MEP, who closely follows Brexit, thought the 
prime minister struck a friendlier tone, compared to her party conference 
speech. The speech was “a PR communication for the rest of Europe”, the MEP, 
said, but the British prime minister’s threat to turn Britain into a low-tax 
island was unmistakable, she added.

“Blackmailing partners is never a good thing. Certain declarations have a 
certain tone, which is not nice,” she said, also referring to the chancellor 
Philip Hammond’s warning thatthe UK could become a low-tax haven for 
corporations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/15/philip-hammond-suggests-uk-outside-single-market-could-become-tax-haven>
.

The discussion on tax was “very worrying. As far as I know the UK is a member 
of the OECD and is committed in the G20 and OECD to tackle tax fraud, tax 
evasion and not to encourage tax avoidance. It would be very strange for the UK 
not to reflect its own commitments.”

She pointed out May’s speech also contained important omissions, with no 
direct reference tothe €60bn (£51bn) Brexit bill being prepared by EU Brexit 
negotiator Michel Barnier. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/eus-chief-divorce-negotiator-michel-barnier-to-make-first-brexit-statement>
 “This is her version of what a good deal would look like and there is still a 
lot of work to do.”

In her view, the speech clarified what kind of relationship the British 
government wanted with the EU, but left big questions open. On the single 
market, May’s desire for the “greatest possible access” was “not very clear”, 
while “grey areas” remained over what she wanted on the customs union and 
reciprocal rights for EU citizens.

This view was echoed by an EU source who said the speech brought clarity, by 
ruling out options, such as a Swiss model or Norway-style membership of the 
European Economic Area, while leaving many questions to be worked out. “It 
brings it into clearer focus and enables everyone to sit down and prepare for 
the negotiations with that tighter focus.”

One of the trickiest points for both sides will be agreeing a transition deal. 
EU negotiators have made clear that the UK cannot have a transition deal 
without accepting the writ of the European court of justice. “It is obviously 
going to very difficult. If it is the status quo or close to it, it is going to 
be very difficult for the UK to accept. If it is very different from the status 
quo, it may prejudge the outcome of the negotiations,” an outcome that would be 
unacceptable for the EU, the source said.
 
More from Italy. Asked about Theresa May’s remarks, one Italian government 
official said he doubted that the UK could be as strong outside the EU as it is 
in the EU.

“Good luck on being a ‘Global Britain’,” the official said.

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron poured scorn on the promise to give parliament a 
vote on the final deal and said the prime minister should commit to a 
referendum. “It means parliament, half of which is not elected, will get a say 
on a stitch-up deal of which we do not know the content and the British people 
won’t,” he said.

“No deal that Britain is going to get through this process is better than the 
one we’ve got now.”

Farron said May should give MPs and the public the choice to remain in the EU 
or accept the new relationship. “We will continue to fight for a referendum on 
the terms of the deal, and then if the British people choose to reject the deal 
that is done, we could stay in the EU,” he said.

“No prime minister who gave a monkey’s about the British people would leave 
those as our only two options. One option is bound to be retention of our 
membership of the EU, and then it would be an outrage if the British people 
didn’t have a say.”
 
Sandro Gozi, Italy’s undersecretary for European affairs, said May’s speech at 
least offered some clarity and certainty on the UK’s objectives.


“It is now finally clear what they want. They want to leave for good and they 
want a full Brexit,” he said, adding that one aspect of her speech surprised 
him.

“May said that the end process could not be that the UK would be half in and 
half out. And I find this comment surprising because that is the current state 
of the UK - that is the state they are withdrawing from,” he said, pointing to 
“so many exceptions” that have been made for the UK over decades to accommodate 
its demands.

Nobody wants revenge, nobody wants vengeance, we fully respect it as a British 
sovereign decision and we respect the approach on negotiations. Of course, 
losing an important member like the UK is a loss. It will be a bigger loss for 
the UK ... [the negotiation] will be a damage limitation process.

Gozi said the protection of rights for Italians living in the UK was Italy’s 
“number one” priority in the negotiations and that he believed May’s remarks on 
the topic - in which she said that guaranteeing a mutual agreement on citizens’ 
rights in the UK and in the EU was a priority - were positive.
 
German industry welcomed Theresa May’s speech for providing clarity but made 
clear that it believed a hard Brexit would do substantial damage to business 
ties between Britain and theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

Volker Treier, head of the German Chamber for Industry and Trade said that the 
speech had at last ended a debate about “cherry-picking” but that a “hard 
Brexit” would limit chances of growth “on both sides of the Channel”, with 
Great Britain likely to take a harder hit.

After Brexit is completed, German businesses are planning to reduce their 
economic investment on the island. Another consequence would be write-offs to 
the tune of billions, because German business had invested into Britain because 
of its membership of the single market. Such write-offs would then not be 
reinvested.

Leaving the single market and the customs union, Treier said, “lowered the 
economic attractiveness of the [British] island”.

To date, German companies have built up factories and businesses to the value 
of 120 billion euros. These companies employ around 400,000 people in Great 
Britain.

Have a lot of respect for @Keir_Starmer <https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer> but 
totally disagree with this. May's plans are an extreme gamble with Britain's

How is Sir Keir Starmer's no hard Brexit Commons claim compatible with 
Corbyn's description of a "bargain basement" Brexit?#BrexitPuzzle

Rupert Harrison, who worked as George Osborne’s chief of staff when Osborne 
was chancellor, does not take theKeir Starmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer> line. Harrison thinks Theresa 
May’s speech meant we’re getting a hard Brexit.
Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) 
Pretty much hard Brexit - TM seeking to control events even if at some cost. 
But now not in control of outcomes on trade deal and customs

Pound up during the speech - smart to pre brief market negative news on the 
single market. All the political bad news seems to be out now

On reflection biggest hostage to fortune in TM's speech is agreement within 2 
years. Big ask, likely to be fudged w transition in some areas

The Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP John Mann thinks 
today’s speech has reduced the chances of an early election.

Not possible forPM to call snap election this year- needs threat/ opportunity 
of calling election if Parliament votes down negotiated deal

Answering questions on the Le Monde live blog, Philippe Bernard, Le Monde’s 
London correspondent said:

The prime minister’s declarations do not clear up the numerous uncertainties 
surrounding Brexit. She has outlined certain objectives, but nothing says they 
will be achieved by the end of the negotiations. The impossibility of seeing 
what the future holds continues to exasperate the City and if the performance 
of the British economy right now is much better than forecasts indicated, most 
experts are expecting a shock in the months to come.
