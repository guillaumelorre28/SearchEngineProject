1 Michael Andrews

A poetic eye for reality and flourishes of postmodern storytelling make 
Michael Andrews one of the most interesting, important British painters of the 
20th century. Hopefully, this exhibition of some of his most haunting paintings 
will start a fashion for his admirable ways of seeing.It includes his eerie 
painting of a balloon’s shadow crossing a beach

, which I loved long before I’d heard of him because it was on the cover of a 
Penguin poetry collection. But that’s Andrews: an artist you possibly know 
better than you think. And if you don’t, this is a chance to climb aboard.

2 Tales From Ovid’s Metamorphoses

The stories of gods, monsters, transformation and desire gathered by the 
ancient Roman poet Ovid from Greek mythology and given a sensual twist in witty 
Latin have shaped European art for millennia. Titian’s great (though damaged) 
Perseus And Andromeda is just one painting in the Wallace Collection that takes 
its tale from the Metamorphoses. This free display charts the changes artists 
have brought to Ovid and pursues his flights of imagination through one of the 
loveliest galleries in Europe.

3 Matisse

The current fashion for seeing Matisse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/matisse> as a kind of 
proto-minimalist godfather of today’s art, just because he resorted to cutouts 
when he was too ill to paint, is wilfully ignorant of the development of his 
work. His blue nudes, on view in this Hayward touring exhibition, are the 
culmination of ideas he had been refining since the early 1900s. His cutouts do 
not replace painting, they consummate it.

4 The New Line

At the dawn of pop art in the 20s and 30s, V&A librarian Philip James 
collected modern adverts and magazine covers by avant-garde artists including
László Moholy-Nagy <http://moholy-nagy.org/> to create an archive that reveals, 
among other things, how stylishly brands advertised between the wars.

 Kentridge and Koorland in conversation. 
Kentridge is South Africa’s most powerful contemporary artist and Koorland is 
excellent, too. They have been friends for decades and, as this joint 
exhibition reveals, often share ideas. It explores their interest in how to 
represent history – in all its tragedy and hope – in art. It is their talent 
for humane and generous drawing that lets them achieve it.
