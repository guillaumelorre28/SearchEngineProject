The actor Tom Hardy has confirmed interest in playing James Bond – by refusing 
to discuss the matter.Speaking to the Daily Beast 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/15/tom-hardy-on-bond-rumors-and-the-mad-max-fury-road-sequel-s.html>
, Hardy was keen to express enthusiasm at the interviewer’s suggestion 
Inception director Christopher Nolan take over the franchise.

“Oh, wow, Chris would be amazing!” said Hardy. “Wow, that would be cool. That 
would be so cool.”

When pressed, Hardy ducked the question of his taking over the mantle from 
current 007Daniel Craig <https://www.theguardian.com/film/danielcraig> by 
making reference to a conspiracy of silence among contenders.

“There’s a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting,” said Hardy, “that 
if you talk about it you’re automatically out of the race. So I can’t possibly 
comment on that one!”

Dunkirk trailer: Christopher Nolan’s epic second world war film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/dec/14/dunkirk-trailer-christopher-nolan-tom-hardy-harry-styles-film>
Hardy continued: “But Chris Nolan, what a fantastic director for a Bond movie. 
Because Daniel [Craig] is so good, and what [Sam] Mendes and Barbara [Broccoli] 
have done has been so impressive, that it would be a very hard reimagination to 
follow.

“I wonder what the next instalment of that franchise would become, and I think 
when you mention someone likeChristopher Nolan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/christopher-nolan>, that’s a very powerful 
figure to bring into that world who could bring something new and create 
something profound – again.”

Craig’s continuation in the role has yet to be confirmed. The actor, now 48, 
is still suspected to be theproducers’ first choice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/james-bond-producer-daniel-craig-first-choice>
. Rumours of a $150m payday for the next two films have been debunked.

Craig’s assertion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/daniel-craig-id-rather-slash-my-wrists-than-do-another-bond-movie>
, while promoting Spectre, that he’d “rather slash my wrists” than make another 
Bond movie – has led to intense speculation about who might replace the actor. 
Along with Hardy, Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Jamie Bell and Tom Hughes have 
been mooted.
