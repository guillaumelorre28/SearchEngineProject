The energy regulator and consumer groups have said that too few people are 
switching energy suppliers, despite latest figures showing a record 4.8 million 
switched electricity tariff last year.

The industry body, Energy UK, said the 26% increase on 2015 was “fantastic” 
and evidence that a new switching guarantee had given people confidence to move 
and take up better tariffs. ButOfgem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ofgem> said more than 60% of customers 
were still on standard variable tariffs, which are “significantly more 
expensive than the cheapest deals”.

Consumer groups, meanwhile, welcomed the increase but said the majority of 
households were still paying over the odds. Which? said it wanted to see a much 
more competitive market. “It’s good to see switching levels increasing, but 
there are still 20 million people who are stuck on some of the most expensive 
standard tariffs, paying over the odds for their energy,” said Vickie Sheriff, 
the group’s director of campaigns and communications.

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Some people just 
aren’t switching – as many as 4.7 million households in England haven’t 
switched their energy supplier for 10 years, and people on low incomes are 
among those least likely to switch.”

The average number of monthly switches was more than 400,000 in 2016, making a 
yearly total of 4.8 million. This is up from 3.8 million in 2015 and 3.5 
million in 2013, the first year the industry began publishing the data.

Independent suppliers gained more than a million customers from the ‘big six’ 
over 2016, but 600,000 customers returned to the larger companies – up 58% on 
the year before, according to investment bank Jefferies.

Ofgem is due to report in March on the results of a trial of 1,400 customers 
to encourage more switching. Half are receiving offers direct from other 
suppliers, with the other half receiving a letter from Ofgem setting out 
cheaper deals from suppliers.

The trial is a response to a call by the Competition and Markets Authority 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/10/cma-energy-report-q-and-a-licence-to-print-junkmail>
 last year for a new database of customers who have been on standard variable 
tariffs for more than three years.
