What is it? 

A winter jewel of a plant that rewards patience. If you have a sunny, 
sheltered wall, plant the rhizomes ofIris unguicularis at its base and wait. It 
may take a few years, but you will be rewarded by delicate, lavender-blue 
flowers from Christmas until early spring. The plant itself is hardy, but its 
blooms are neither frost- nor slug-proof, so cut flower stems while still 
furled and bring them indoors to watch them slowly open. Height and spread: 
30cm x 30cm.


Any good varieties? 

Pale lavender ‘Walter Butt’ and intense purple ‘Mary Barnard’ are the most 
popular choices (and often the only ones); the white ‘Alba’ is a bit 
wishy-washy.


Plant it with? 

The beautifully variegated leaves of Italian Arum ‘Marmoratum’ 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=178> make an ideal partner.

And where? 

This iris thrives on neglect, but it has to be the right kind of neglect. Bear 
in mind that its home is North Africa and parts of the Mediterranean, so 
shelter, sun, impoverished soil and a lack of winter wet are vital.


Any drawbacks? 

The grass-like foliage is a scrappy mess most of the year. Tidy after 
flowering.


What else can it do? 

The flowers release a sweet perfume that fills a room when they are brought 
inside.
