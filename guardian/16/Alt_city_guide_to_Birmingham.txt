Creatively, Birmingham is elusive. Unlike many cities, it does not have an 
identifiable cultural DNA. It has never asserted itself as a centre of radical 
art or music. Local creatives offer various reasons why. Some take a quiet 
pride in that anonymity: “We didn’t shout as loud as people from Manchester, 
but that’s the nature of the city”, the techno producer Karl O’Connor, aka 
Regis,once told the Quietus 
<http://thequietus.com/articles/13898-regis-downwards-karl-o-connor-interview>. 
Over the years that modesty may have become a self-fulfilling prophecy, but, 
even geographically, Birmingham is not built for self-promotion.

This “city of a thousand trades” has always been sprawling and granular. It is 
highly diverse socially and culturally, a city where the best restaurants (
Jyoti’s <http://www.jyotis.co.uk/>) or music venues (Hare & Hounds 
<http://hareandhoundskingsheath.co.uk/>), are often found in the suburbs – if 
you are willing to travel. Which not everyone is. For instance, attracting 
people from the city centre into the rave dens of neighbouring, post-industrial 
Digbeth can be difficult. Consequently, Birmingham club crowds tend to be 
dedicated and discerning, though, overall, the scene is relatively small. As 
Alex Wynne Hughes, co-promoter of theShadow City 
<https://www.facebook.com/shadowcitybirmingham/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE&fref=nf> 
parties, puts it: “A lot of people would say we’ve got our own thing going on.”

Birmingham playlist by Lisa Meyer of Supersonic festival

Fundamentally, this is a city of gangs and individuals working in comparative 
isolation, which encourages driven oddballs and out-there ideas. Look at the 
annualSupersonic festival <http://www.supersonicfestival.com/> or Brum bands 
from Black Sabbath toDexys Midnight Runners 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dexys-midnight-runners>. There is a purity 
in that, says Mark Badger from the labelIron Man <http://ironmanrecords.net/> 
(and the band Police Bastard): “If you want to make art, make it because it’s 
something you have to get out of your system; not because someone’s going to 
pay you.”

That attitude may explain why Birmingham has produced so much screamingly 
loud, confrontational music, from Napalm Death to theNegative Reaction label 
<http://www.negativereaction.co.uk/>, alongside quieter outliers such as 
Broadcast <http://futurecrayon.blogspot.co.uk/>, drone label Oaken Palace 
<https://www.oakenpalace.com/> or electronica imprint the Irrational Media 
Society <https://theirrationalmediasociety.bandcamp.com/>. These outliers can 
be influential, too. Most notably, the “Birmingham sound” (the mid-90s 
industrial output of Regis, Surgeon and the club House of God) was a key 
precursor to modern Berlin techno.

Such DIY energy is also palpable in the arts scene. Digbeth is home to 
numerous offbeat outfits, such as aerial theatre companyRogue Play 
<http://www.rogueplay.co.uk/>, and printers/ ‘zine store Rope Press 
<http://ropepress.org.uk/>. “The past two years have been exciting in terms of 
people such as Grand Union, Eastside Projects and Centrala making their own 
things happen,” says Lisa Meyer, artistic director atCapsule 
<http://www.capsule.org.uk/>, which produces Supersonic. But how long will that 
last? The planned,HS2 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2>-related 
transformation of Digbeth threatens the area’s creative pioneers. “As the 
largest arts organisation here, we don’t own our building. It’s precarious,” 
warnsEastside Projects <https://eastsideprojects.org/>’ director Gavin Wade.

The battle to find affordable space in central Birmingham is one that food 
entrepreneurs know well. Birmingham has five Michelin stars, but, says Lap-fai 
Lee, a professional cook and blogger atthefoodist.uk 
<http://www.thefoodist.co.uk/>, “I’d trade three of our stars for 20 more 
places like [indie burger joint] Original Patty Men.”

The message? Support Birmingham’s battling independents.

On the first Friday of each month, Digbeth’s creative hubs throw open their 
doors. Minerva Works, in particular, is home to a cluster of innovative 
artist-run gallery and performance spaces, such asStryx <http://stryx.co.uk/>, 
Grand Union <http://grand-union.org.uk/> and Vivid Projects 
<http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/>. On 3 December, Vivid Projects is throwing 
an Algorave, where freshly minted electronic bangers are generated live from

Birmingham has several specialist beer shops; there’s the legendary Cotteridge 
Wines 
<https://twitter.com/CotteridgeWines?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
 andBottle Shed <https://twitter.com/bottleshedbrum> for starters. As well as 
their growler refills and rare bottles, these also offer space where shoppers 
can drink on-site. Clink has brought that concept into town… ish, with its 
shop-cum-taproom atDigbeth’s Custard Factory <http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/>
. Its global selection includes 200 bottled beers and eight keg lines from 
scene-leaders such as Buxton, Cigar City and To Øl.

Originally a pub, the Rainbow has, over the years, grown into numerous 
modular, interlinked Digbeth venues which, collectively, constitute the core of 
Brum’s underground club scene. Look out for nights from Shadow City,Leftfoot 
<http://www.leftfootevents.co.uk/>, Portal <http://www.portalmusic.co.uk/> and 
Blackdot <https://www.facebook.com/blackdotevent/>. “The Rainbow’s Blackbox is 
arguably one of the best clubs in the country,” says Tom Hopkins from gig and 
club promotersThis Is Tmrw <http://thisistmrw.co.uk/>. “It’s intimate, the DJs 
are on a level with you, the light and sound are incredible.”

This graffiti-covered outpost is unusually green, with its eco-electricity and 
conscientious recycling, and a hotbed of raucous, sweaty gigs and club nights 
running the gamut from indie to grime. “It’s small, maybe 150 capacity, and 
when I’ve DJd there it’s been good fun,” says Shadow City’s Alex Wynne Hughes.

“It boggles my mind that someone would sit in Ed’s Easy Diner in Selfridges, 
when, over the road, you can have a proper burger at Original Patty Men,” says 
Lap-fai Lee, of this rough-edged railway arch site. Its well-seasoned, 
vigorously charred patties and zingy pickles deliver, although some of the beer 
prices are staggering (568ml bottle of Arbor’s 6.5% Umm…Bingo?, £7.50). For 
more from Birmingham’s buoyant street food scene, go to the weeklyDigbeth 
Dining Club <http://digbethdiningclub.com/> or Hawker Yard

Near New Street railway station, this tiny takeaway-cafe is run by three mates

(sausages) that are stuffed into pittas with salad, tzatziki and fried

On a grimy street of industrial units, this family-run Korean restaurant is a 
quirky proposition. Guests eat in one of three spaces, which include a summer 
courtyard and a brick out-building, whitewashed and jazzed up with colourful 
knick-knacks. Portions are not huge, but the flavours are true in, say, the 
marinatedbulgogi beef served with kimchi. The female kitchen staff are chatty 
evangelists for Korean food, Modu’s fried chicken has many local fans and, as 
Supersonic’s Lisa Meyer says of the four-course £15 menu: “It’s amazing value.”

Look In

For Chinatown’s connoisseurs, Peach Garden’s triple roast (crispy pork belly, 
duck, char siu with rice, £7.50, 34 Ladywell Walk, 0121-666 7502) is one of 
Birmingham’s best bargains. But, says Lap-fai Lee, the “quality of the meat” at 
Look In means its triple is edging ahead as the No1. He is not wrong. Look In’s 
honey-lacquered char siu is unusually good, while the crust-not-crackling on 
its beautifully moist pork belly tastes as if someone has coated it in the 
purest essence of Frazzles. It is incredible.
