The film, which stars Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, and 
is directed by Theodore Melfi, saw off competition from new arrivals such as 
big-budget action comedy Monster Trucks, which could only manage seventh with 
an estimated $10.5m on its opening weekend, and the Jamie Foxx kidnap thriller 
Sleepless, which fared even more poorly, with $8.46m for eighth place. Outdoing 
both was little-heralded horror film The Bye Bye Man, which managed to land in 
fifth place with $13.38m.

Hidden Figures’ estimated $20.45m in its fourth week on release was enough to 
comfortably see off La La Land, which took $14.5m for second place in its sixth 
week. Hidden Figures’ box office sturdiness – perhaps fuelled by the Martin 
Luther King holiday weekend – was further underlined by the underwhelming 
performance of a number of high-profile expanding films, which added large 
numbers of screens but little in the way of receipts. After three weeks of 
limited play, Boston marathon thrillerPatriots Day

 went nationwide, yet only managed $12m to land at No 6; Martin Scorsese’s 
religious dramaSilence

 took $1.9m to stall at No 16; while Ben Affleck mob thrillerLive By Night

 added more than 2,800 screens from its previous week, but failed to crack the 
Top 10, settling for $5.42m at No 11.

Monster Trucks’ failure to dent the box office was widely anticipated, after 
reports emerged

 that studio Paramount were expecting to lose $115m on the project.
