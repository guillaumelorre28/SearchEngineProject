“I’ve got two more years at Red Bull. That’s where I’m going to be,” Ricciardo 
said in Perth on Wednesday. “There’s a lot of people that are tempted to jump 
into that (Mercedes) seat, and you don’t blame them. I just hope whoever gets 
it appreciates it. It’s a damn good one. But for me, you’ll see me at Albert 
Park in a Red Bull.”

Williams driver Valtteri Bottas is expected to join Mercedes, who were a class 
above their rivals this year. As part of the musical chairs,Felipe Massa is set 
to come out of retirement

 to rejoin Williams in place of Bottas.

Ricciardo said he looked back at his 2016 campaign very fondly, despite Red 
Bull’s cars falling well short of being able to consistently challenge 
Mercedes. The West Australian finished third in the championship race, with his 
sole victory coming at the Malaysian Grand Prix.
