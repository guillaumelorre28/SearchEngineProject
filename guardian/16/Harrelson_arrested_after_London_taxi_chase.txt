Woody Harrelson has been arrested following a bizarre taxi chase through the 
streets of London in the early hours of this morning (June 7, 2002).

The star of Natural Born Killers and Indecent Proposal was eventually held by 
officers after breaking an ashtray and a lock on the door of a black cab which 
had been taking him from the China White nightclub to his hotel.

Harrelson reportedly jumped out of the cab following the incident and swiftly 
hailed another before speeding off with the first driver in hot pursuit. After 
a chase through central London, police eventually halted the second cab in 
Sloane Square, where the actor is reported to have fled on foot before 
eventually being stopped.

He was arrested on suspicion of causing Â£300 worth of damage to the cab and 
spent the night in a cell before being freed on bail.

The aggrieved, taxi driver Les Dartnell, told The Sun: "I turned round and he 
was kicking the inside of my taxi. He had suddenly gone completely bonkers. He 
was kicking the glass and trying to get out. I tried to find a space to pull 
over but he had already yanked back the door and broken it."

Police are now expected to send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service, who 
will decide if any prosecution is to be made.
