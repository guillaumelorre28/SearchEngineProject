The answer to Europe’s problems is to have more Europe, not less, Moscovici 
adds (isn’t it always?!).

“We need more convergence, more policy tools, a budget and a minster of 
finance for the EU. We must invest more.”

Moscovici: Europeans are angry

Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for the economy, is speaking at a 
session on The European Disunion.

He admits that people are not happy.

“People suffer from too weak growth, too high unemployment and too much debt. 
There’s economic anger and cultural anger.”

But he insists that the “EU is solid and a unique model”.

The three things Europe needs are economic efficiency, to protect its 
citizens, and to be more democratic and accountability.

Standing: Basic income's time has come

Larry Elliott

LSE professor Guy Standing has been telling Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> that the time has come for a 
universal income for all citizens.

Standing says he has been making the case for a basic income to be paid to 
everyone regardless of whether they are rich or poor for many years but the 
idea has recently started to get attention because of the fears of job losses 
from automation.


“A basic income is not a panacea but it is part of the new redistribution we 
should be building for the 21st Century.”

Standing says there are three arguments for a basic income: social justice, 
freeing people from those wielding arbitrary power, and the provision of basic 
security.He says a basic income is easily affordable and could be paid for by 
taking the proceeds of “rentier capitalism.

“The returns to property and intellectual property and natural resources are 
going to a minority and we must do something about that.”

Standing bemoans the fact that Britain did not use its oil revenues during the 
North Sea boom to set up a sovereign wealth fund.

“Had Britain set up a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway did, it could be paying 
out more than a basic income”, he said.

Fighting inequality with Pokémon Go

In one of those ‘only at Davos’ moments, 17 Pokémon Go “Pokéstops” have been 
set up around the ski resort to (possibly) raise awareness of inequality.

It’s the brainchild of film director Richard Curtis’s development agency, 
calledProject Everyone <https://www.project-everyone.org/>. Stops include 
worthy causes like “Zero Hunger” and “Good Health.”

According to Business Insider 
<http://uk.businessinsider.com/director-richard-curtis-is-using-pokemon-go-at-davos-to-tackle-poverty-2017-1>
, Olympic medal-winning sprinter Michael Johnson and celebrity chef Jamie 
Oliver have been spotted playing the game. Curtis is hoping that others follow 
suit, saying:

“I’m hoping a surprising number might think it is quite an amusing thing to 
do. I’ve noticed theDavos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> audience 
are quite willing to laugh at even quite weak jokes, because they’re looking 
for entertainment!”
Jim Waterson (@jimwaterson) 
Davos looks like it's tapping into the mood of the moment.

US inflation rises in line with forecasts

Nick Fletcher

Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> for a moment once 
more, and US consumer prices rose in December, up 2.1% year on year mainly due 
to higher fuel prices as crude recovered more ground from its recent lows.

That was the biggest year on year gain since the middle of 2014 and rose from 
a figure of 1.7% in November, although it was in line with analysts’ 
expectations.

The month on month figure showed a rise of 0.3% in the consumer price index, 
compared to 0.2% in November.

With price pressures increasing - especially if Donald Trump follows through 
with his promises to boost spending - the chances of a US rate hike are also 
rising. When the Federal Reserve increased rates in December, it predicted 
three more rises this year.

James Knightley, senior economist at ING Bank, said:

Both headline and core inflation are rising faster than 2% year on year, 
helping to build the case for further Fed rate hikes.

US consumer price inflation came in exactly in line for December with the 
headline rate rising 0.3% month on month leading to an annual inflation rate of 
2.1% versus 1.7% in November. The core (ex food and energy) rose 0.2% month on 
month leaving the annual rate at 2.2% versus 2.1% previously. This is the first 
time that both headline and core US inflation is rising at 2% or more since the 
second quarter of 2014.

Fuel prices were the main culprit with energy prices rising 1.5% month on 
month and transportation costs increasing 1% month on month. Most other 
components rose 0.2% or 0.3% but there was some softness in food (flat on the 
month) and apparel (-0.7% month on month).

With headline inflation likely to move up towards 2.5% in the second half of 
the year and President Trump promising pro-growth and pro-job policies in what 
already is a fairly strong story, it means further Federal Reserve rate hikes 
are not far away. We expect the next one in March with a further move higher in 
the third quarter of 2017.

German defence minister: Europe needs to boost defence spending

Europe needs to spend more on defence to protect the Transatlantic Alliance, 
says Germany’s defence minister.

Ursula von der Leyen told a panel that:


Europe has to take a fair share of the burden. It’s not at that point that 
now, so we have to invest more in defence.

We want a strong European pillar within Nato, she continues, and the ability 
to tackle more problems in Africa.

Nato’s future bas been cast into doubt by Donald Trump; von der Leyen see a 
bright future, though.

I’m very confident that this wonderful and precious friendship will last long.

Von der Leyen says the Alliance between the US and Europe goes beyond military 
issues; it is based on a long period of friendship and trust, and shared values:

We are fighting for something — for democracy, for the open society, the rule 
of law.

Frederick Pempe, CEO of The Atlantic Council, agrees, saying that he’s caution 
against seeing the ‘death knell’ of the Transatlantic Alliance.

Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg is also on this panel about ‘positive narratives’.

She explains how it’s important that people have a ‘common understanding’ of 
the past, to help create a shared identity.
World Economic Forum (@Davos) 
A shared identity means a common understanding of your past and a common 
belief in your future, says Sheryl Sandberg#wef17

If you look at the history of mankind, you see that societal change and 
progress is a messy thing, Meg Whitman continues.

Her message to leaders at Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> 
is to “be the change you want to create”.

Sometimes these problems are so overwhelming that if you carve out something 
that matters to you, that you can make a big difference to, that can push the 
ball down the field.

Technology has pulled 100s of millions of people out of poverty, it has 
connected a lot of people, it has modernised agriculture and medicine.

But it’s also creating economic dislocation, the HP boss continues.

It’s up to leaders in this room, particularly in the technology field, to 
think ‘how do we help manage the transition of people who have been disrupted 
by robotics or automation’ -- which by the way is a far bigger cause of job 
losses in the US than economic globalisation.

That includes retraining workforces, pooling hiring across companies, to 
create opportunities for people where they are.

HP's Whitman: Chickens have come home to roost

Despite the gloom in the global economy, is there a ‘positive narrative’ out 
there?

On a panel session in the main hall (livefeed here 
<https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017/sessions/a-positive-narrative-for-an-uncertain-world>
), documentary maker Sharmeen Obaid- Chinoy says technology is giving people 
more control.

People want to take ownership of their stories, especially young people.

There are a lot of anxieties. Violence against women in many parts of the 
world has gone up, but so has access to technology and women are now more aware 
of their rights.

Young people are now beginning to break free. Their anxieties focus on if 
they’ll have the same opportunities as their grandparents. Will they be told 
what do by the leaders in their countries, or will they break through?

I see less anxiety in the places I work, and more hope.

Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, says that there needs to be a better 
discussion about the impact that technology has on jobs.

Meg Whitman of HP is blunter, saying that “some of the chickens have come home 
to roost”.

That includes:

 * Declining trust in institutions

 * Economic dislocation leading to the refugee crisis

 * Economic dislocation caused by technology.

And technology will only have a bigger impact, she warns, as AI, robotics and 
3D printing all develop.

So “we need to create a new narrative”, Whitman adds, based on the right thing 
for the economy, and giving more hope to people who have been dislocated by 
technology.

CA boss: Education, not higher tax, will solve economic challenges

Mike Gregoire, the chief executive of software giant CA Technologies, has 
criticised the idea that simply taxing the 1% richest more will solve our 
economic problems.


Speaking to me at Davos, he says the key is to invest more in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics skills, to help people in the new 
economy (a themeJoe Biden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden> 
touched on in his speech too).

Gregoire says:

The lack of both business and governments, and I say both, focusing on 
retraining people in STEM education for the jobs of the future, rather than 
trying to protect a job of the past, needs a lot more work.

The notion of this 1% - it’s a very convenient argument. The math doesn’t work.

If you want to talk about taxpayers - I’m a 60% taxpayer, and my company is a 
30% taxpayer. If you charge every company and every person, you can’t tax them 
enough that it would make a difference if you haven’t attacked the fundamental 
problem.

The fundamental problem is that the economy is changing, and the value curve 
is changing, and the skill sets are changing, and that’s what we should focus 
our attention on.

Gregoire adds that modern manufacturing is much cleaner than in the past, has 
fewer people and it’s highly automated - and that automation will increase.

So what are you doing to prepare people for that economy, rather than the 
economy of the past?

CA supports several organisations that promote STEM skills, including Tech 
Girls Rock 
<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/tech-girls-rock>
. Gregoire is also a board member ofNpower 
<http://www.npower.org/Our-Purpose/Board-of-Directors.aspx#>, which helps 
minorities develop the skills to get a tech job.

Gregoire explains why this is important:

We’re talking about a whole generation of folks who could add value to our 
economy, and they just don’t have the skills because they haven’t been trained 
to be able to participate.

That’s something we can all help lean into.

Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today’s top-level panel on the 
middle class crisis.

The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/christine-lagarde>, has called for urgent 
action to tackle a middle-class crisis as she warned that inequality, distrust 
and a lack of hope were fuelling growing political populism.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2017>, Lagarde said she had first 
highlighted the dangers of rising inequality four years ago but had been 
ignored. “I hope people will listen now,” she said.

Lagarde said the gulf between rich and poor was evident from an Oxfam report 
showing that eight billionaires own the same amount of wealth as the poorest 
half of the world’s population 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50>
 – 3.6 billion people.

“With lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the 
good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies,” 
she said.

Here’s the full story:

The answer to Europe’s problems is to have more Europe, not less, Moscovici 
adds (isn’t it always?!).

Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for the economy, is speaking at a 
session on The European Disunion.

He admits that people are not happy.

“People suffer from too weak growth, too high unemployment and too much debt. 
There’s economic anger and cultural anger.”

But he insists that the “EU is solid and a unique model”.

The three things Europe needs are economic efficiency, to protect its 
citizens, and to be more democratic and accountability.
 
LSE professor Guy Standing has been telling Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> that the time has come for a 
universal income for all citizens.

Standing says he has been making the case for a basic income to be paid to 
everyone regardless of whether they are rich or poor for many years but the 
idea has recently started to get attention because of the fears of job losses 
from automation.


“A basic income is not a panacea but it is part of the new redistribution we 
should be building for the 21st Century.”

Standing says there are three arguments for a basic income: social justice, 
freeing people from those wielding arbitrary power, and the provision of basic 
security.He says a basic income is easily affordable and could be paid for by 
taking the proceeds of “rentier capitalism.

“The returns to property and intellectual property and natural resources are 
going to a minority and we must do something about that.”

Standing bemoans the fact that Britain did not use its oil revenues during the 
North Sea boom to set up a sovereign wealth fund.

“Had Britain set up a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway did, it could be paying 
out more than a basic income”, he said.

 
In one of those ‘only at Davos’ moments, 17 Pokémon Go “Pokéstops” have been 
set up around the ski resort to (possibly) raise awareness of inequality.

It’s the brainchild of film director Richard Curtis’s development agency, 
calledProject Everyone <https://www.project-everyone.org/>. Stops include 
worthy causes like “Zero Hunger” and “Good Health.”

According to Business Insider 
<http://uk.businessinsider.com/director-richard-curtis-is-using-pokemon-go-at-davos-to-tackle-poverty-2017-1>
, Olympic medal-winning sprinter Michael Johnson and celebrity chef Jamie 
Oliver have been spotted playing the game. Curtis is hoping that others follow 
suit, saying:

“I’m hoping a surprising number might think it is quite an amusing thing to 
do. I’ve noticed theDavos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> audience 
are quite willing to laugh at even quite weak jokes, because they’re looking 
for entertainment!”

Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> for a moment once 
more, and US consumer prices rose in December, up 2.1% year on year mainly due 
to higher fuel prices as crude recovered more ground from its recent lows.

That was the biggest year on year gain since the middle of 2014 and rose from 
a figure of 1.7% in November, although it was in line with analysts’ 
expectations.

The month on month figure showed a rise of 0.3% in the consumer price index, 
compared to 0.2% in November.

With price pressures increasing - especially if Donald Trump follows through 
with his promises to boost spending - the chances of a US rate hike are also 
rising. When the Federal Reserve increased rates in December, it predicted 
three more rises this year.

James Knightley, senior economist at ING Bank, said:

Both headline and core inflation are rising faster than 2% year on year, 
helping to build the case for further Fed rate hikes.

US consumer price inflation came in exactly in line for December with the 
headline rate rising 0.3% month on month leading to an annual inflation rate of 
2.1% versus 1.7% in November. The core (ex food and energy) rose 0.2% month on 
month leaving the annual rate at 2.2% versus 2.1% previously. This is the first 
time that both headline and core US inflation is rising at 2% or more since the 
second quarter of 2014.

Fuel prices were the main culprit with energy prices rising 1.5% month on 
month and transportation costs increasing 1% month on month. Most other 
components rose 0.2% or 0.3% but there was some softness in food (flat on the 
month) and apparel (-0.7% month on month).

With headline inflation likely to move up towards 2.5% in the second half of 
the year and President Trump promising pro-growth and pro-job policies in what 
already is a fairly strong story, it means further Federal Reserve rate hikes 
are not far away. We expect the next one in March with a further move higher in 
the third quarter of 2017.
 
Europe needs to spend more on defence to protect the Transatlantic Alliance, 
says Germany’s defence minister.

Ursula von der Leyen told a panel that:


Europe has to take a fair share of the burden. It’s not at that point that 
now, so we have to invest more in defence.

We want a strong European pillar within Nato, she continues, and the ability 
to tackle more problems in Africa.

Nato’s future bas been cast into doubt by Donald Trump; von der Leyen see a 
bright future, though.

I’m very confident that this wonderful and precious friendship will last long.

Von der Leyen says the Alliance between the US and Europe goes beyond military 
issues; it is based on a long period of friendship and trust, and shared values:

We are fighting for something — for democracy, for the open society, the rule 
of law.

Frederick Pempe, CEO of The Atlantic Council, agrees, saying that he’s caution 
against seeing the ‘death knell’ of the Transatlantic Alliance.

Currently, the US spends $600bn per year on military spending, while European 
countries spend $300bn.
 
Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg is also on this panel about ‘positive narratives’.

She explains how it’s important that people have a ‘common understanding’ of 
the past, to help create a shared identity.

A shared identity means a common understanding of your past and a common

That’s not helped, of course, by the flood of fake news and online 
misinformation we’ve seen recently on places like, well, Facebook.....
 
If you look at the history of mankind, you see that societal change and 
progress is a messy thing, Meg Whitman continues.

Her message to leaders at Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> 
is to “be the change you want to create”.

Sometimes these problems are so overwhelming that if you carve out something 
that matters to you, that you can make a big difference to, that can push the 
ball down the field.

Technology has pulled 100s of millions of people out of poverty, it has 
connected a lot of people, it has modernised agriculture and medicine.

But it’s also creating economic dislocation, the HP boss continues.

It’s up to leaders in this room, particularly in the technology field, to 
think ‘how do we help manage the transition of people who have been disrupted 
by robotics or automation’ -- which by the way is a far bigger cause of job 
losses in the US than economic globalisation.

That includes retraining workforces, pooling hiring across companies, to 
create opportunities for people where they are.

Despite the gloom in the global economy, is there a ‘positive narrative’ out 
there?

On a panel session in the main hall (livefeed here 
<https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017/sessions/a-positive-narrative-for-an-uncertain-world>
), documentary maker Sharmeen Obaid- Chinoy says technology is giving people 
more control.

People want to take ownership of their stories, especially young people.

There are a lot of anxieties. Violence against women in many parts of the 
world has gone up, but so has access to technology and women are now more aware 
of their rights.

Young people are now beginning to break free. Their anxieties focus on if 
they’ll have the same opportunities as their grandparents. Will they be told 
what do by the leaders in their countries, or will they break through?

I see less anxiety in the places I work, and more hope.

Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, says that there needs to be a better 
discussion about the impact that technology has on jobs.

Meg Whitman of HP is blunter, saying that “some of the chickens have come home 
to roost”.

That includes:

 * Declining trust in institutions

 * Economic dislocation leading to the refugee crisis

 * Economic dislocation caused by technology.

And technology will only have a bigger impact, she warns, as AI, robotics and 
3D printing all develop.

So “we need to create a new narrative”, Whitman adds, based on the right thing 
for the economy, and giving more hope to people who have been dislocated by 
technology.
 
Here’s a video clip of Joe Biden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden>
 telling the global elite at Davos to pull their weight.
Joe Biden tells Davos: top 1% must do more 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/18/joe-biden-tells-davos-top-1-must-do-more-video> 
Mike Gregoire, the chief executive of software giant CA Technologies, has 
criticised the idea that simply taxing the 1% richest more will solve our 
economic problems.


Speaking to me at Davos, he says the key is to invest more in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics skills, to help people in the new 
economy (a themeJoe Biden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden> 
touched on in his speech too).

Gregoire says:

The lack of both business and governments, and I say both, focusing on 
retraining people in STEM education for the jobs of the future, rather than 
trying to protect a job of the past, needs a lot more work.

The notion of this 1% - it’s a very convenient argument. The math doesn’t work.

If you want to talk about taxpayers - I’m a 60% taxpayer, and my company is a 
30% taxpayer. If you charge every company and every person, you can’t tax them 
enough that it would make a difference if you haven’t attacked the fundamental 
problem.

The fundamental problem is that the economy is changing, and the value curve 
is changing, and the skill sets are changing, and that’s what we should focus 
our attention on.

Gregoire adds that modern manufacturing is much cleaner than in the past, has 
fewer people and it’s highly automated - and that automation will increase.

So what are you doing to prepare people for that economy, rather than the 
economy of the past?

CA supports several organisations that promote STEM skills, including Tech 
Girls Rock 
<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/tech-girls-rock>
. Gregoire is also a board member ofNpower 
<http://www.npower.org/Our-Purpose/Board-of-Directors.aspx#>, which helps 
minorities develop the skills to get a tech job.

Gregoire explains why this is important:

We’re talking about a whole generation of folks who could add value to our 
economy, and they just don’t have the skills because they haven’t been trained 
to be able to participate.

That’s something we can all help lean into.

is Putin himself, who never stopped fighting the old one.

Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today’s top-level panel on the 
middle class crisis.

The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/christine-lagarde>, has called for urgent 
action to tackle a middle-class crisis as she warned that inequality, distrust 
and a lack of hope were fuelling growing political populism.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2017>, Lagarde said she had first 
highlighted the dangers of rising inequality four years ago but had been 
ignored. “I hope people will listen now,” she said.

Lagarde said the gulf between rich and poor was evident from an Oxfam report 
showing that eight billionaires own the same amount of wealth as the poorest 
half of the world’s population 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50>
 – 3.6 billion people.

“With lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the 
good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies,” 
she said.
