Pauline Hanson <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson> 
said it was an honour, but her invitation to Donald Trump’s inauguration was 
organised by the Australian embassy after multiple requests from One Nation, 
the foreign affairs department has revealed.

And according to a report by Buzzfeed 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/embassy-organised-invites?utm_term=.xiw9rNXWYa#.vtBNdl0b26>
 the congressman who gave the tickets did not intend them as an endorsement of 
the Australian nationalist party.

On Monday Hanson, One Nation’s federal leader, said she had been given tickets 
to Trump’s swearing-in as the US president on Friday but had sent senator Brian 
Burston in her stead.

On Tuesday Burston told ABC Radio National the tickets came from Republican 
congressman Adam Kinzinger.

But Buzzfeed reported on Wednesday that Kinzinger, a congressman from Illinois 
who spoke out against Trump during the election, had not extended an invitation 
directly to One Nation.

“Our office received a request from the embassy of Australia and the 
congressman accommodated that request,” a spokesperson for Kinzinger reportedly 
said. “As such, we have given the tickets to the embassy to use as they wish. 
The congressman does not endorse any political party in Australia.”

In a statement on Wednesday the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told 
Guardian Australia: “Following multiple requests from Senator [Malcolm] 
Roberts, the embassy in Washington asked a number of congressional offices if 
they had any spare tickets available.


“On 13 January, Congressman [Adam] Kinzinger’s office advised they had two 
tickets available. The tickets are not yet available for collection.”

Asked about Kinzinger distancing himself from the invitation, a spokesman for 
Burston said “the congressman will be the one that hands [the tickets] over” 
when Burston arrived. He said images of the invitation were posted to the 
senator’s Facebook:

He also claimed the invitation “didn’t come through the Australian embassy”. 

“It came via the former Trump campaign volunteer who works with Malcolm Roberts

On Tuesday, in a radio interview with ABC Brisbane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/17/turnbull-says-one-nations-medicinal-cannabis-amnesty-irresponsible>
, Malcolm Turnbull addressed Hanson’s claim she was invited to Donald Trump’s 
inauguration and the fact he was not.

The prime minister said his understanding was it was not the practice to 
invite foreign leaders such as himself and he “wouldn’t lose a moment’s sleep” 
if a One Nation parliamentarian attended.

Turnbull appeared uncertain of what the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade had already confirmed

, that Australia’s ambassador, Joe Hockey, would attend. Turnbull said Hockey 
would attend if other diplomats did.
