It may be true that those who are elderly now worked a long time ago to give 
younger people a better deal, and some more say in how their lives were 
organised. The irony is that these days the young seem to have a great stake in 
absolutely everything, while it is often the poor old aged who are assumed to 
be not up to living their lives without other people helping them and telling 
them what to do.

I wasn’t pleased at all when a stranger turned up at my home recently

I wasn’t pleased at all when a stranger turned up at my home recently, telling 
me that she had been hired to look after me. I gave her a meal and tried to be 
polite to her, because it really wasn’t her fault that my son, who lives a 
distance away, thought he wouldn’t have to worry so often if I wasn’t on my own 
so much, and there was somebody with me.

I usually have people to help me who are already friends; but I suppose having 
a helper at home to stop a son from worrying is just one more thing a mother 
should do.

That event made me think about a housewife who suddenly found that she had to 
take orders from somebody else outside the family. Then she would have lost the 
one thing that makes the job rewarding: the knowledge that she is getting 
things done her way in her home, and doing what her family needs.

If she is just doing things which other people tell her to do she might just 
as well work outside the home – and make some money. I know it’s not the same 
thing, but…
