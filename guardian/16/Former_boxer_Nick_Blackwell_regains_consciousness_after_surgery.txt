The former British middleweight champion Nick Blackwell is “smiling again” 
after waking from a coma, his brother Daniel has said. Blackwell has regained 
consciousness having undergone surgery to remove part of his skull to ease the 
swelling on his brain sustainedduring an unsanctioned sparring session

 held last month.

The 26-year-old from Trowbridge had been in a stable condition, but remained 
in a coma until this week.

“Nick is doing well considering the damage he has had,” his brother said. 
“He’s looking around, moving his arms and legs, and is drinking, eating and 
smiling again. Rehab is going to take a long time, but he has done amazingly 
well so far.”

The British Boxing <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing> Board of Control 
has been investigating the circumstances surrounding the sparring session that 
placed Blackwell’s life in danger and plan to hold a hearing in January.

Blackwell’s boxing licence had been withdrawn before last month’s ill-advised 
sparring session,after collapsing at the end of his defeat by Chris Eubank Jnr

 in March. On that occasion he was found to have suffered a bleed on the skull 
and was put into an induced coma.

Blackwell, who remains in hospital, then made a full recovery and subsequently 
announced his retirement from the sport.
