FTSE hits new high but European markets dip

As the dollar weakened and US markets fell on disappointment at the lack of 
details of Donald Trump’s economic plans at Wednesday’s press conference, 
markets suffered a tricky day.

The FTSE 100 fell back initially as the pound gained ground, hitting overseas 
earners, and pharmaceutical shares dropped after Trump’s talk of clamping down 
on the prices they charged for their medicines. But as the pound dipped later 
in the session, the FTSE 100 just about managed to end in positive territory, 
its 11th successive closing high.

But in Europe a rise in the euro - due to the weak dollar as well as the 
minutes of the last ECB meeting - left markets flagging. The final scores 
showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 1.88 points or 0.03% at 7292.37 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 1.07% to 11,521.04 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.51% at 4863.97 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.69% to 19,156.59 
 * Spain’s Ibex edged down 0.01% to 9407.4 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.28% to 665.21 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 20 
points at 19,834 - well off the 20,000 barrier it almost breached last Friday.

On that note it’s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

The FTSE 100 rally might not have much further to go, says Capital Economics. 
The think tank’s John Higgins said:

It is tempting to attribute the FTSE 100’s winning streak to a renewed plunge 
in sterling. But other factors have also been at play. These include higher 
commodity prices, the resilience of the UK economy in the wake of the vote for 
Brexit and spill-over effects from Trump’s election victory. Looking ahead, we 
remain positive on the FTSE 100, but don’t expect it to make much more headway.

We doubt that there is much life left in the FTSE 100 rally.. Indeed, we 
forecast that it will end 2017 at 7,500, which is only about 3% above its level 
today. Granted, we expect the UK economy to continue to fare quite well. 
However, there are three reasons why we are cautious.

First, we forecast a small gain in sterling in trade-weighted terms, as a 
further decline against the dollar (to $1.20/£ from $1.23/£) is more than 
offset by a rise against the euro (to €1.26/£ from €1.15/£). Second, we expect 
the rally in oil prices to peter out. Our end-year forecast for Brent crude is 
$60pb, which is not much above its price today (around $56pb). And third, we 
think the US stock market will run out of steam, as the enthusiasm with which 
shareholders greeted Trump’s victory starts to wane and profit margins are 
squeezed. Our end-2017 forecast for the S&P 500 is only 2,300, which is barely 
above its level now.

Commenting on the market falls, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:

After briefly sneaking into positive territory the FTSE slipped back into the 
red this afternoon, with the index’s 2017 winning streak potentially about to 
come to an end.

Despite a largely healthy set of commodity stocks, and a wave of positive 
Christmas updates from its key retailers, it seems like there was just too much 
going on for the FTSE this Thursday. The negative reaction to some of those 
trading statements, most notablyTesco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> and Primark-owner Associated 
British Foods, alongside the pound’s rebound against the dollar, largely 
prompted by the greenback’s own weaknesses, prevented the UK index from 
building beyond the 7300 it struck yesterday.

Over in the US things took a rather sharp turn downwards, with the Dow Jones 
plunging by 150 points after the bell. It seems that both the Dow and the 
dollar are still displeased with the lack of policy detail in Donald Trump’s 
press conference on Wednesday. Especially disgruntled are the US pharmaceutical 
stocks, the likes of Shire and Pfizer continuing yesterday’s losses after the 
President-elect claimed that the sector was ‘getting away with murder’ in 
regards to drug prices.

In the Eurozone, meanwhile, the DAX and CAC incurred some hefty losses as the 
euro hit a one month high against the dollar and took 0.3% off the pound. The 
currency appeared to be prompted by the latest ECB meeting minutes released 
this afternoon, with the central bank apparently fairly divided ahead of their 
to extend QE at a reduced rate of purchase.

It looks like the chances of the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking through 
the 20,000 barrier in the near future are getting slimmer, nor is the FTSE 100 
currently on course to continue its record breaking run of closing highs.

The Dow is currently down 144 points at 19,810 on continuing disappointment 
with the lack of detail from Donald Trump on his spending and tax plans.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has slipped 9 points to 7281, having climbed as high as 
7302 and fallen as low as 7263.

Wall Street opens lower

With the dollar weakening after president-elect Donald Trump failed to spell 
out any spending or tax plans in Wednesday’s press conference, US markets have 
fallen back in early trading.

After ending nearly 100 points higher on Wednesday after a volatile session as 
Trump spoke, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now gone into reverse, down 
75 points or 0.37% to 19.879.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both slipped around 0.3% at the open.

US markets, indeed global markets, have seen sharp rises recently, partly 
fuelled by Trump’s declarations of increased spending and other measures to 
boost the economy. Investors had been hoping for more details at Wednesday’s 
event, but in the end were disappointed.

Oil prices climb by 2%

Oil prices are moving higher on reports that Opec members are sticking to the 
production cuts agreed last November. Reuters reports:

Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq told [an Abu Dhabi] conference Kuwait 
had already cut its oil output by more than it promised under the OPEC deal, 
without giving further details.

Iraq Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told reporters Iraq was “hoping for a 
better price”. Iraq had reduced its oil exports by 170,000 bpd and was cutting 
them by a further 40,000 bpd this week, he said.

BMI Research said overall “compliance to the OPEC/non-OPEC oil production cut 
appears to be positive ... We calculate compliance with production cuts at 
around 73 percent,” led by high compliance from members of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council, namely Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and 
Oman.

Crude has also been boosted by news of record Chinese car sales, which grew by 
13.7% in 2016.

Brent is currently up 2.12% at $56.27 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate 
has climbed 2.05% to $53.32.

US jobless claims rise less than expected

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by less than 
expected last week.

Initial benefit claims rose by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000, 
compared to forecasts of an increase to 255,000. The previous week’s figure of 
235,000 was revised upwards by 2,000, the US Labor Department said.

The benefit claim number has been below 300,000 - a level seen as indicating a 
healthy jobs market - for 97 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1970.

The euro has hit a one month high of $1.0683 against the dollar after the ECB 
minutes showed a split on extending the central bank’s bond buying programme.

The rise is also due to weakness in the dollar following a lack of detail 
about Donald Trump’s spending and tax plans at Wednesday’s press conference.

ECB - members disagreed over bond buying extension

The European Central Bank’s decision to extend its bond buying programme 
followed signs of a continuing moderate recovery in the eurozone economy, but 
insufficient progress towards a sustained pick up in inflation.

At its December meeting the ECB decided to extend the programme by nine months 
to December 2017 but cut the monthly amount of bonds bought from €80bn to 
€60bn, but there were some differences of opinion according tothe just-released 
minutes <https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2017/html/mg170112.en.html>.

Some members initially preferred to keep things as they were, as that had the 
merit of continuity and was in line with market expectations. But the minutes 
said the option of extending the programme “allowed for a more sustained market 
presence and, therefore, a more lasting transmission of the Governing Council’s 
stimulus measures.”

And it meant that if the recovery faltered the decision could be reversed. The 
minutes said: “At the same time, if the outlook became less favourable, or if 
financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a 
sustained adjustment of the inflation path, the Governing Council could return 
to a pace of €80 billion per month.”

So although the change was eventually implemented, some members remained 
opposed: “A few members could not support either of the two options that had 
been proposed, while welcoming the scaling-down of purchases and other elements 
of the proposals, in view of their well-known general scepticism regarding the 
APP [asset purchase programme] and public debt purchases in particular.”

After a volatile performance during president-elect Donald Trump’s press 
conference, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 98 points higher at 
19,954, heading back towards the elusive 20,000 barrier.

But the futures market is suggesting the Dow will dip back down again at the 
open, with a fall of around 42 points forecast at the moment.

The weekly jobless figures, due before the US market opens, could have some 
influence and are expected to rise from last week’s near 43 year low.

Here’s our story on the John Lewis bonus cut. Sarah Butler writes:

John Lewis has warned that its annual bonus for staff will be significantly 
lower than last year as it prepares to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in 
sterling.

Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the staff-owned group, which includes Waitrose, 
said he anticipated a “challenging” year ahead as retailers would have to 
absorb a big chunk of the rising cost of importing goods just as they are 
coping with shoppers’ shift to buying online....

Mayfield said the devaluation of sterling was “one of the most significant 
factors overhanging the outlook for the year ahead.”

This will be the fourth consecutive year that the group, which is collectively 
owned by its staff, has reduced the payout, but it is highly unusual for it to 
cut the bonus when profits rise. Last year its 91,500 employees, known as 
partners, were awardedbonuses of 10% of salary, the lowest for 13 years, 
averaging just over £1,500 each 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/john-lewis-waitrose-staff-bonus-falls-again>
.

The bonus payout started in 1920. It was suspended during the second world war 
and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The 
highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011.

Here’s a quick roundup of the day’s main retail updates from George Salmon, 
equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:

The first set of positive like-for-likes in the Clothing and Home division for 
almost two years is the main headline atM&S. While last year’s frankly abysmal 
performance was hardly a tough benchmark to beat, investors will be hoping that 
Steve Rowe’s plans to revitalise the group gain some traction and this marks 
the start of a more positive trajectory.

There was some Christmas cheer at M&S’ high street rival  Debenhams too. The 
group gathered momentum through the all-important Christmas quarter, rounding 
it off in style by upping like-for-like sales by 5% in the seven weeks to 7 
January. It wasn’t just in stores that things look brighter either. Online 
sales jumped 17% in that period.

It was more of a mixed bag at John Lewis, however. While sales growth of 
almost 5% means that the tills were certainly ringing, the group says that 
greater challenges across the retail sector, notably the continuing shift to 
online, means that profit is likely to come under pressure. Unfortunately for 
those at the group, the likely upshot here is a significantly lower bonus than 
last year.

To see evidence of that shift to online spending, look no further than the 30% 
sales growth thatAsos pulled in at the back end of last year. With more 
customers ordering more often, expectations for full year sales growth have 
been raised, but this means extra investment too. The group will need to spend 
another £30m to keep up with the relentlessly increasing demand. This is one of 
the better problems to have, we feel.

Primark owner Associated British Foods doesn’t do online shopping. Instead, 
the focus for the retail division is on rolling out its pile it high, sell it 
cheap format across Europe and the US. With expansion continuing apace, 
investors may be excused for being a touch disappointed by the 11% growth in 
sales reported today. Square footage increased by 12% in the last year.

Still with the economy, and eurozone industrial production rose more sharply 
than expected in November.

Output climbed by 1.5% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% 
increase. Year on year it rose 3.2%, much better than the 1.6% expected.

The October figures were revised upwards, with a 0.1% rise month on month 
compared to an earlier reported fall of 0.1%. Dennis de Jong, managing director 
at UFX.com, said:

After stuttering throughout the summer, industrial production in the eurozone 
bounced back with a vengeance in November, which will give the ECB serious 
grounds for confidence at this early stage in 2017.

The outlook remains weighed down by continued political uncertainty, but the 
recovery in the region is gathering some real momentum. Unemployment is 
falling, business confidence is up and the weak euro is a real boost for 
exporters.

Although Mario Draghi and his ECB colleagues are still faced with some very 
real political threats, the economy is standing up well in the face of 
adversity.

The ECB is due to announce its latest monetary policy deliberations next 
Thursday.

Back with the industrial production figures and Howard Archer, economist at 
IHS Markit, was also positive but warned of an uncertain outlook:

Even allowing for the fact that industrial production has been highly erratic, 
November’s jump reinforces our belief that Eurozone GDP growth could well have 
reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016. This would be up 
from 0.3% in both the third and second quarters.

It appears that the Eurozone manufacturing sector carried decent momentum into 
2017, and they will be helped by the very competitive euro...

Looking ahead, a concern for Eurozone manufacturers will be that mounting 
uncertainty over the coming months (particularly political) could cause 
business and consumers to be cautious in their major spending decisions, 
thereby constraining demand for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable 
goods

 It is also very possible that purchasing power for Eurozone consumers’ will 
become less favourable as inflation picks up, thereby weighing down on demand 
for big-ticket consumer durables.

In particular, an uncertain political environment could be increasingly 
problematic for Eurozone growth prospects over the coming months, especially 
given that the UK’s Brexit vote last June and November’s election of Donald 
Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks. General 
elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and 
Germany (in September), while a 2017 election is very possible in Italy 
following Prime Minister Renzi’s early-December defeat in the referendum on 
constitutional reform which has led to his resignation.

German economy grows at fastest rate in five years

Good news for the eurozone as the Germany economy, the major driver of growth 
in the region, recorded its best performance for five years in 2016.

German GDP grew by 1.9% last year, up from 1.7% in 2015 and better than the 
expected 1.8% rise. The economy was boosted by strong domestic demand, 
compensating for sluggish demand for exports. ING economist Carsten Brzeski 
said the German economy remained an “island of happiness”, adding:

The German economy has once again defied several deep hits. Despite the stock 
market crash in China, Brexit, Turkey, Trump and Italy, the economy performed 
its best growth year since 2011. Strong domestic demand has shielded the German 
economy against most external risks.

And he said the biggest risk to future growth was complacency:

[2016] was a year in which the German economy proved to be more robust than 
many thought and in which the economy weathered a series of external risks 
extremely well, thanks to strong domestic demand. In fact, the often 
controversially discussed refugee crisis and the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary 
policy turned out to be an economic blessing, artificially extending the long, 
positive cycle of the economy. The year 2017 will in our view look very much 
like 2016, only with a bit less of everything. Domestic demand, ie construction 
and both private and public consumption, should remain the main growth drivers. 
The biggest risk for the economy is not Trump or political populism in the 
Eurozone but self-complacency. The economy urgently needs new impetus from new 
structural reforms and stronger public and private investment. It is very 
unlikely that it will get any of these before the elections.

UniCredit economist Andreas Rees was also positive:

The German economy remains a stronghold of continuity. With plus 1.9% in 2016, 
its growth performance was rock solid and even accelerated to its strongest 
pace in the last five years (2015: +1.7%; 2014: +1.6%). Once again, the major 
driver was domestic demand in the form of private and public consumer 
expenditures and not export activity. Imports were even outpacing exports last 
year. Taking a glimpse into 2017, the German economy remains fundamentally in 
good shape. The growth drivers will change somewhat, since there will be a 
(moderate) shift from domestic demand to stronger export activity. What can go 
wrong? It goes without saying that there are substantial political risks, 
especially from the US, which could have an (indirect) impact on German 
exports. Whether and how this will play out still remains to be seen. For 2017, 
we expect “only” GDP growth of 1.5%. Please note that the reason for the drop 
is NOT based on fundamentals and definitely not a reason to be worried. 
Instead, the lower number of working days is artificially weighing on the 
headline growth number (calendar-day adjusted growth in 2017: +1.8% after also 
+1.8% last year).

Pharma shares hit by Trump comments

Speaking of Donald Trump, one market moving comment in his press conference 
related to pharmaceutical companies.

He said drugs companies were “getting away with murder” in the prices they 
charged and promised that would change. That sent US pharma stocks lower, and 
theat sentiment has carried over into Europe.

So Shire, Hikma, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have all seen their shares 
fall. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:

If pharmaceutical companies were hoping for an easier ride from President 
elect Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton they were quickly disabused of this 
notion last night when the President elect let rip at the industry’s pricing 
policies.

Last year was notable for a number of stories related to price gouging 
including the Mylan story around the Epipen price hikes, and Valeant’s policy 
of buying older niche drugs and then hiking the prices aggressively, and the 
antipathy that resulted from these stories has made the industry an easy target 
for a President who may feel compelled to get some quick political wins.

At a time when pharmaceutical companies were hoping for a more benign 
investment environment last night’s remarks were a reminder, if any were 
needed, as well as a warning to the sector and other sectors as well, of the 
President elects propensity to adopt a scatter gun approach to domestic policy.

Investors would do well to bear this in mind given that the recent stock 
market rally doesn’t appear to have factored this into their investment 
scenarios. The Trump Presidency is unlikely to be a one way bet for stock 
markets.

A stronger pound is also taking some of the shine off the leading index.

One of the driving factors behind the recent surge in the FTSE 100 to record 
levels has been the weakness of sterling, which benefits overseas earners and 
makes UK assets more attractive to international investors.

But disappointment that president-elect Donald Trump - in his first press 
conference since July - failed to spell out details of his plans to boost the 
US economy with infrastructure spending and new tax measure has sent the dollar 
lower.

Against the US currency the pound has added 0.32% to $1.2252, although 
sterling is virtually flat against the euro at €1.1528.

As the dollar weakened and US markets fell on disappointment at the lack of 
details of Donald Trump’s economic plans at Wednesday’s press conference, 
markets suffered a tricky day.

The FTSE 100 fell back initially as the pound gained ground, hitting overseas 
earners, and pharmaceutical shares dropped after Trump’s talk of clamping down 
on the prices they charged for their medicines. But as the pound dipped later 
in the session, the FTSE 100 just about managed to end in positive territory, 
its 11th successive closing high.

But in Europe a rise in the euro - due to the weak dollar as well as the 
minutes of the last ECB meeting - left markets flagging. The final scores 
showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 1.88 points or 0.03% at 7292.37 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 1.07% to 11,521.04 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.51% at 4863.97 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.69% to 19,156.59 
 * Spain’s Ibex edged down 0.01% to 9407.4 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.28% to 665.21 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 20 
points at 19,834 - well off the 20,000 barrier it almost breached last Friday.

On that note it’s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
The FTSE 100 rally might not have much further to go, says Capital Economics. 
The think tank’s John Higgins said:

It is tempting to attribute the FTSE 100’s winning streak to a renewed plunge 
in sterling. But other factors have also been at play. These include higher 
commodity prices, the resilience of the UK economy in the wake of the vote for 
Brexit and spill-over effects from Trump’s election victory. Looking ahead, we 
remain positive on the FTSE 100, but don’t expect it to make much more headway.

We doubt that there is much life left in the FTSE 100 rally.. Indeed, we 
forecast that it will end 2017 at 7,500, which is only about 3% above its level 
today. Granted, we expect the UK economy to continue to fare quite well. 
However, there are three reasons why we are cautious.

First, we forecast a small gain in sterling in trade-weighted terms, as a 
further decline against the dollar (to $1.20/£ from $1.23/£) is more than 
offset by a rise against the euro (to €1.26/£ from €1.15/£). Second, we expect 
the rally in oil prices to peter out. Our end-year forecast for Brent crude is 
$60pb, which is not much above its price today (around $56pb). And third, we 
think the US stock market will run out of steam, as the enthusiasm with which 
shareholders greeted Trump’s victory starts to wane and profit margins are 
squeezed. Our end-2017 forecast for the S&P 500 is only 2,300, which is barely 
above its level now.
 
Commenting on the market falls, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:

After briefly sneaking into positive territory the FTSE slipped back into the 
red this afternoon, with the index’s 2017 winning streak potentially about to 
come to an end.

Despite a largely healthy set of commodity stocks, and a wave of positive 
Christmas updates from its key retailers, it seems like there was just too much 
going on for the FTSE this Thursday. The negative reaction to some of those 
trading statements, most notablyTesco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> and Primark-owner Associated 
British Foods, alongside the pound’s rebound against the dollar, largely 
prompted by the greenback’s own weaknesses, prevented the UK index from 
building beyond the 7300 it struck yesterday.

Over in the US things took a rather sharp turn downwards, with the Dow Jones 
plunging by 150 points after the bell. It seems that both the Dow and the 
dollar are still displeased with the lack of policy detail in Donald Trump’s 
press conference on Wednesday. Especially disgruntled are the US pharmaceutical 
stocks, the likes of Shire and Pfizer continuing yesterday’s losses after the 
President-elect claimed that the sector was ‘getting away with murder’ in 
regards to drug prices.

In the Eurozone, meanwhile, the DAX and CAC incurred some hefty losses as the 
euro hit a one month high against the dollar and took 0.3% off the pound. The 
currency appeared to be prompted by the latest ECB meeting minutes released 
this afternoon, with the central bank apparently fairly divided ahead of their 
to extend QE at a reduced rate of purchase.
 
It looks like the chances of the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking through 
the 20,000 barrier in the near future are getting slimmer, nor is the FTSE 100 
currently on course to continue its record breaking run of closing highs.

The Dow is currently down 144 points at 19,810 on continuing disappointment 
with the lack of detail from Donald Trump on his spending and tax plans.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has slipped 9 points to 7281, having climbed as high as 
7302 and fallen as low as 7263.

With the dollar weakening after president-elect Donald Trump failed to spell 
out any spending or tax plans in Wednesday’s press conference, US markets have 
fallen back in early trading.

After ending nearly 100 points higher on Wednesday after a volatile session as 
Trump spoke, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now gone into reverse, down 
75 points or 0.37% to 19.879.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both slipped around 0.3% at the open.

US markets, indeed global markets, have seen sharp rises recently, partly 
fuelled by Trump’s declarations of increased spending and other measures to 
boost the economy. Investors had been hoping for more details at Wednesday’s 
event, but in the end were disappointed.
 
Oil prices are moving higher on reports that Opec members are sticking to the 
production cuts agreed last November. Reuters reports:

Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq told [an Abu Dhabi] conference Kuwait 
had already cut its oil output by more than it promised under the OPEC deal, 
without giving further details.

Iraq Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told reporters Iraq was “hoping for a 
better price”. Iraq had reduced its oil exports by 170,000 bpd and was cutting 
them by a further 40,000 bpd this week, he said.

BMI Research said overall “compliance to the OPEC/non-OPEC oil production cut 
appears to be positive ... We calculate compliance with production cuts at 
around 73 percent,” led by high compliance from members of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council, namely Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and 
Oman.

Crude has also been boosted by news of record Chinese car sales, which grew by 
13.7% in 2016.

Brent is currently up 2.12% at $56.27 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate 
has climbed 2.05% to $53.32.
 
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by less than 
expected last week.

Initial benefit claims rose by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000, 
compared to forecasts of an increase to 255,000. The previous week’s figure of 
235,000 was revised upwards by 2,000, the US Labor Department said.

The benefit claim number has been below 300,000 - a level seen as indicating a 
healthy jobs market - for 97 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1970.

The euro has hit a one month high of $1.0683 against the dollar after the ECB 
minutes showed a split on extending the central bank’s bond buying programme.

The rise is also due to weakness in the dollar following a lack of detail 
about Donald Trump’s spending and tax plans at Wednesday’s press conference.

Shorter ECB accounts: QE "recalibration" due to reduced deflation risks 
(hawkish), but still no sign of core inflation upturn (dovish).
 <https://twitter.com/fwred/status/819524087739453440> January 12, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/fwred/status/819524087739453440>  
The European Central Bank’s decision to extend its bond buying programme 
followed signs of a continuing moderate recovery in the eurozone economy, but 
insufficient progress towards a sustained pick up in inflation.

At its December meeting the ECB decided to extend the programme by nine months 
to December 2017 but cut the monthly amount of bonds bought from €80bn to 
€60bn, but there were some differences of opinion according tothe just-released 
minutes <https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2017/html/mg170112.en.html>.

Some members initially preferred to keep things as they were, as that had the 
merit of continuity and was in line with market expectations. But the minutes 
said the option of extending the programme “allowed for a more sustained market 
presence and, therefore, a more lasting transmission of the Governing Council’s 
stimulus measures.”

And it meant that if the recovery faltered the decision could be reversed. The 
minutes said: “At the same time, if the outlook became less favourable, or if 
financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a 
sustained adjustment of the inflation path, the Governing Council could return 
to a pace of €80 billion per month.”

So although the change was eventually implemented, some members remained 
opposed: “A few members could not support either of the two options that had 
been proposed, while welcoming the scaling-down of purchases and other elements 
of the proposals, in view of their well-known general scepticism regarding the 
APP [asset purchase programme] and public debt purchases in particular.”

After a volatile performance during president-elect Donald Trump’s press 
conference, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 98 points higher at 
19,954, heading back towards the elusive 20,000 barrier.

But the futures market is suggesting the Dow will dip back down again at the 
open, with a fall of around 42 points forecast at the moment.

The weekly jobless figures, due before the US market opens, could have some 
influence and are expected to rise from last week’s near 43 year low.
 
Here’s our story on the John Lewis bonus cut. Sarah Butler writes:

John Lewis has warned that its annual bonus for staff will be significantly 
lower than last year as it prepares to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in 
sterling.

Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the staff-owned group, which includes Waitrose, 
said he anticipated a “challenging” year ahead as retailers would have to 
absorb a big chunk of the rising cost of importing goods just as they are 
coping with shoppers’ shift to buying online....

Mayfield said the devaluation of sterling was “one of the most significant 
factors overhanging the outlook for the year ahead.”

This will be the fourth consecutive year that the group, which is collectively 
owned by its staff, has reduced the payout, but it is highly unusual for it to 
cut the bonus when profits rise. Last year its 91,500 employees, known as 
partners, were awardedbonuses of 10% of salary, the lowest for 13 years, 
averaging just over £1,500 each 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/john-lewis-waitrose-staff-bonus-falls-again>
.

The bonus payout started in 1920. It was suspended during the second world war 
and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The 
highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011.

Here’s a quick roundup of the day’s main retail updates from George Salmon, 
equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:

The first set of positive like-for-likes in the Clothing and Home division for 
almost two years is the main headline atM&S. While last year’s frankly abysmal 
performance was hardly a tough benchmark to beat, investors will be hoping that 
Steve Rowe’s plans to revitalise the group gain some traction and this marks 
the start of a more positive trajectory.

There was some Christmas cheer at M&S’ high street rival  Debenhams too. The 
group gathered momentum through the all-important Christmas quarter, rounding 
it off in style by upping like-for-like sales by 5% in the seven weeks to 7 
January. It wasn’t just in stores that things look brighter either. Online 
sales jumped 17% in that period.

It was more of a mixed bag at John Lewis, however. While sales growth of 
almost 5% means that the tills were certainly ringing, the group says that 
greater challenges across the retail sector, notably the continuing shift to 
online, means that profit is likely to come under pressure. Unfortunately for 
those at the group, the likely upshot here is a significantly lower bonus than 
last year.

To see evidence of that shift to online spending, look no further than the 30% 
sales growth thatAsos pulled in at the back end of last year. With more 
customers ordering more often, expectations for full year sales growth have 
been raised, but this means extra investment too. The group will need to spend 
another £30m to keep up with the relentlessly increasing demand. This is one of 
the better problems to have, we feel.

Primark owner Associated British Foods doesn’t do online shopping. Instead, 
the focus for the retail division is on rolling out its pile it high, sell it 
cheap format across Europe and the US. With expansion continuing apace, 
investors may be excused for being a touch disappointed by the 11% growth in 
sales reported today. Square footage increased by 12% in the last year.
 
Still with the economy, and eurozone industrial production rose more sharply 
than expected in November.

Output climbed by 1.5% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% 
increase. Year on year it rose 3.2%, much better than the 1.6% expected.

The October figures were revised upwards, with a 0.1% rise month on month 
compared to an earlier reported fall of 0.1%. Dennis de Jong, managing director 
at UFX.com, said:

After stuttering throughout the summer, industrial production in the eurozone 
bounced back with a vengeance in November, which will give the ECB serious 
grounds for confidence at this early stage in 2017.

The outlook remains weighed down by continued political uncertainty, but the 
recovery in the region is gathering some real momentum. Unemployment is 
falling, business confidence is up and the weak euro is a real boost for 
exporters.

Although Mario Draghi and his ECB colleagues are still faced with some very 
real political threats, the economy is standing up well in the face of 
adversity.

The ECB is due to announce its latest monetary policy deliberations next 
Thursday.

Back with the industrial production figures and Howard Archer, economist at 
IHS Markit, was also positive but warned of an uncertain outlook:

Even allowing for the fact that industrial production has been highly erratic, 
November’s jump reinforces our belief that Eurozone GDP growth could well have 
reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016. This would be up 
from 0.3% in both the third and second quarters.

It appears that the Eurozone manufacturing sector carried decent momentum into 
2017, and they will be helped by the very competitive euro...

Looking ahead, a concern for Eurozone manufacturers will be that mounting 
uncertainty over the coming months (particularly political) could cause 
business and consumers to be cautious in their major spending decisions, 
thereby constraining demand for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable 
goods

 It is also very possible that purchasing power for Eurozone consumers’ will 
become less favourable as inflation picks up, thereby weighing down on demand 
for big-ticket consumer durables.

In particular, an uncertain political environment could be increasingly 
problematic for Eurozone growth prospects over the coming months, especially 
given that the UK’s Brexit vote last June and November’s election of Donald 
Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks. General 
elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and 
Germany (in September), while a 2017 election is very possible in Italy 
following Prime Minister Renzi’s early-December defeat in the referendum on 
constitutional reform which has led to his resignation.

Good news for the eurozone as the Germany economy, the major driver of growth 
in the region, recorded its best performance for five years in 2016.

German GDP grew by 1.9% last year, up from 1.7% in 2015 and better than the 
expected 1.8% rise. The economy was boosted by strong domestic demand, 
compensating for sluggish demand for exports. ING economist Carsten Brzeski 
said the German economy remained an “island of happiness”, adding:

The German economy has once again defied several deep hits. Despite the stock 
market crash in China, Brexit, Turkey, Trump and Italy, the economy performed 
its best growth year since 2011. Strong domestic demand has shielded the German 
economy against most external risks.

And he said the biggest risk to future growth was complacency:

[2016] was a year in which the German economy proved to be more robust than 
many thought and in which the economy weathered a series of external risks 
extremely well, thanks to strong domestic demand. In fact, the often 
controversially discussed refugee crisis and the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary 
policy turned out to be an economic blessing, artificially extending the long, 
positive cycle of the economy. The year 2017 will in our view look very much 
like 2016, only with a bit less of everything. Domestic demand, ie construction 
and both private and public consumption, should remain the main growth drivers. 
The biggest risk for the economy is not Trump or political populism in the 
Eurozone but self-complacency. The economy urgently needs new impetus from new 
structural reforms and stronger public and private investment. It is very 
unlikely that it will get any of these before the elections.

UniCredit economist Andreas Rees was also positive:

The German economy remains a stronghold of continuity. With plus 1.9% in 2016, 
its growth performance was rock solid and even accelerated to its strongest 
pace in the last five years (2015: +1.7%; 2014: +1.6%). Once again, the major 
driver was domestic demand in the form of private and public consumer 
expenditures and not export activity. Imports were even outpacing exports last 
year. Taking a glimpse into 2017, the German economy remains fundamentally in 
good shape. The growth drivers will change somewhat, since there will be a 
(moderate) shift from domestic demand to stronger export activity. What can go 
wrong? It goes without saying that there are substantial political risks, 
especially from the US, which could have an (indirect) impact on German 
exports. Whether and how this will play out still remains to be seen. For 2017, 
we expect “only” GDP growth of 1.5%. Please note that the reason for the drop 
is NOT based on fundamentals and definitely not a reason to be worried. 
Instead, the lower number of working days is artificially weighing on the 
headline growth number (calendar-day adjusted growth in 2017: +1.8% after also 
+1.8% last year).
 
Speaking of Donald Trump, one market moving comment in his press conference 
related to pharmaceutical companies.

He said drugs companies were “getting away with murder” in the prices they 
charged and promised that would change. That sent US pharma stocks lower, and 
theat sentiment has carried over into Europe.

So Shire, Hikma, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have all seen their shares 
fall. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:

If pharmaceutical companies were hoping for an easier ride from President 
elect Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton they were quickly disabused of this 
notion last night when the President elect let rip at the industry’s pricing 
policies.

Last year was notable for a number of stories related to price gouging 
including the Mylan story around the Epipen price hikes, and Valeant’s policy 
of buying older niche drugs and then hiking the prices aggressively, and the 
antipathy that resulted from these stories has made the industry an easy target 
for a President who may feel compelled to get some quick political wins.

At a time when pharmaceutical companies were hoping for a more benign 
investment environment last night’s remarks were a reminder, if any were 
needed, as well as a warning to the sector and other sectors as well, of the 
President elects propensity to adopt a scatter gun approach to domestic policy.

Investors would do well to bear this in mind given that the recent stock 
market rally doesn’t appear to have factored this into their investment 
scenarios. The Trump Presidency is unlikely to be a one way bet for stock 
markets.

A stronger pound is also taking some of the shine off the leading index.

One of the driving factors behind the recent surge in the FTSE 100 to record 
levels has been the weakness of sterling, which benefits overseas earners and 
makes UK assets more attractive to international investors.

But disappointment that president-elect Donald Trump - in his first press 
conference since July - failed to spell out details of his plans to boost the 
US economy with infrastructure spending and new tax measure has sent the dollar 
lower.

Against the US currency the pound has added 0.32% to $1.2252, although 
sterling is virtually flat against the euro at €1.1528.
