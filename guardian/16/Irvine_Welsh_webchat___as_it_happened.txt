Hi Irvine

Every school I went to has been demolished, Craigmuir, Craigroyston, and 
Ainslie Park. Though Craigroyston to be fair, has been reborn in a different 
location. Do you think Cameron, Millibandy, or their pals could make such a 
claim? My real question is on disappointment, in that do you feel disappointed 
for how it’s all turned out? During the 60s and 70s in amongst all the crap 
there was at least a sense of optimism, a glimmer of things getting better, of 
our society becoming a bit more equal. Around 1975 ish, in my early 20s as a 
lad from Pilton I sipped sherry one Xmas or some such with admiral Denning, or 
his brother the Lord one, who had a dose of the horrors when he discovered I 
was a prol. But at least I got in past the front door. Q. Is it all now 
stitched up to prevent prols from ever sherry sipping with Lords and Admirals?

It is. It has gone back to a kind of Victorian type of society, and it's 
almost like all the advances after the second world war, all the social 
advances, have been eradicated. We've gone back to a very elitist ideology, and 
it's disappointing. Everything's also a reaction though: the new narrative of 
our time is the new nation state, self-sufficient, eco-friendly, socially 
progressive. And that's what's going to facilitate real change: not 
bureaucracies like the EU, not corrupt elitist parliaments like Westminster.

There needs to be more democracy, more voices - it can't just be the same 
middle class obsessions. More edgy, more dramatic, more of the big human issues 
that affect people, which are often economic or social issues. And more 
shagging.

On Labour: "I don't think there's anything to go back to. The party I grew up 
with is long dead"

ThirdFrock <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13734458> says:

I was moved by your description of how you made the journey from Labour “No” 
to a “Yes” vote in the referendum. As an English incomer – here for ~12 years – 
and also profoundly disillusioned with Labour I had recently made a very 
similar journey.

I would like to know whether – like me – you are struggling to return to 
“Labour” for the general election and whether they will attract your vote 
(quite understand that you might not want to indicate who you’ll be voting for).

I don't think there's anything to go back to with Labour. The party I grew up 
with is long dead. I've accepted that over a period of time. What to support 
next is the issue: I would support SNP at a Westminster election, but Green or 
SSP in Scottish parliamentary elections, because I don't think it's good to 
have a monolithic one party state evolving, even for a single-issue party.

Using social media as a platform by Big Publishing Houses, I’ve noticed a lot 
of pretty young things who have books coming out and blogs etc, but what about 
literary fiction, good prose, as it is not really “marketable”? What would you 
advise an unknown writer to go with their work? Self-publishing? I’ve recently 
done that myself. Also, what about a novel about Mikey Forrester and a big Drug 
Deal in say Latin America? There’s an idea for you. Thanks, Neil

Thanks for the Mikey Forrester idea! 

I think it's very tough for young writers because even if a publisher takes 
them on, they've basically got two books to hit the big time before they're 
forgotten about. They don't get the marketing muscle for a first book - they're 
expected to do it over social media and word of mouth. When I started out, we 
were really looked after: myself, Alan Warner, John King, we were at Cape at 
the same time, we were looked after in a way that young writers aren't 
nowadays. It's about immediate numbers, rather than building a long-term 
presence for the writer.

Probably not, because I'm straight up to Manchester as soon as it's over. 
Maybe that'll eat up the train journey...

Do you think they’ll ever be a decent film made about football casuals? I went

I ran with Hibs from 14 to 30 by the way.

It's a hard one to do. Because as you know there's so many different aspects 
to that whole movement, fashion and music and camaraderie and local pride as 
well as actual violence, but you have to focus on the buzz of the violence. It 
becomes like any other adrenaline based movie: they have a great time and go in 
too far, and it becomes a cautionary tale. There's only one thing it can really 
be. I think The Football Factory is about the best, but there's been nothing 
absolutely definitive yet.

Yeah Andy Murray was apparently born in a Glasgow hospital, but grew up in 
central Scotland in Dunblane. I enjoy doing the tennis commentaries, but I've 
become pals with Judy Murray, so I have to remember that's her son I'm speaking 
about.

Hi Irvine,

Many of your books, especially Trainspotting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/trainspotting>, seem to be about the 
vulnerability of youth, hiding behind a lot of bravado. Do you think that young 
people’s lives have changed, in the past 20 years?

It's got really bad for young people in the last 20 years. There seems to be 
nothing for low-paid people, there's job insecurity, a lifetime of debt, little 
opportunity to get a decent education, living with your parents until you're 
nearly middle aged... if you're a kid, corporate fascism uses you as a tool to 
get to your parents' savings. It's bleak. Youth always have fun, it's always 
better being young than old, no question - but my generation have let down 
young people by not creating the inclusive, democratic, transparent society 
with genuine opportunities. All the promise of hippies and punks and acid 
house, it's never delivered on a political basis because the entrenched elites 
have been too strong and outmanoeuvred us. My generation lost the class war, 
and the youth are paying the price for that.

I don't think you can be disappointed if your book gets made into a film - if 
it's bad, you say they fucked up your book, if it's great, you can say it 
wouldn't have happened without your book. It's win-win.

You always have to remember the book is still going to be there, whatever 
happens to the film.

Hi IW, 

What’s your writing method from an ergonomic point of view? Do you sit at a 
desk, lie on a sofa, write in bed, or can the words flow wherever you are?

Because I write mainly on a laptop, or a manuscript printed from one, I can 
write pretty much anywhere. I write on public transit, coffee shops, but when I 
need quiet time to put everything together, I have to go to my work room, sit 
at a big desk, and go for it. Both really, I suppose.

I don't know. I'm cagey not because I doubt it'll be independent sometime, 
it's more in terms of being cagey about my own lifetime... who knows how long 
that'll be, it's impossible to say. I'm at the age now where I could drop down 
dead tomorrow, or live for years and years. I think it's inevitable that 
there's going to be some major transformation, and I can't see any future in 
the UK in its current form. It's about the inevitable breakup of the UK, rather 
than the independence of Scotland.

In some ways, I think because I was writing against the sort of trust fund 
middle class junkies like Trocchi and Burroughs - drugs had become a lot more 
democratic, before it had been the preserve of the idle rich. Or in voluntary 
poverty. They were inspirational, but not in the obvious way.

You don't really think about it, because it tends to happen incrementally. You 
get an acknowledgement first, and then some decent money coming in, then a bit 
of fame, and then bigger money and along the way that process usually takes 
about three or four years from your big successful book. And then it becomes 
something that you do. It creeps up on you. It seems to be overnight, but it 
doesn't feel that way - things change very slowly in your life over a five year 
period.

There's two things I do. I like to draw the characters in detail, I like the 
action to keep moving, so there's something inherently cinematic in that. 
You're kind of halfway there. That's why it's been successful.

Hi Irvine

Every school I went to has been demolished, Craigmuir, Craigroyston, and 
Ainslie Park. Though Craigroyston to be fair, has been reborn in a different 
location. Do you think Cameron, Millibandy, or their pals could make such a 
claim? My real question is on disappointment, in that do you feel disappointed 
for how it’s all turned out? During the 60s and 70s in amongst all the crap 
there was at least a sense of optimism, a glimmer of things getting better, of 
our society becoming a bit more equal. Around 1975 ish, in my early 20s as a 
lad from Pilton I sipped sherry one Xmas or some such with admiral Denning, or 
his brother the Lord one, who had a dose of the horrors when he discovered I 
was a prol. But at least I got in past the front door. Q. Is it all now 
stitched up to prevent prols from ever sherry sipping with Lords and Admirals?

It is. It has gone back to a kind of Victorian type of society, and it's 
almost like all the advances after the second world war, all the social 
advances, have been eradicated. We've gone back to a very elitist ideology, and 
it's disappointing. Everything's also a reaction though: the new narrative of 
our time is the new nation state, self-sufficient, eco-friendly, socially 
progressive. And that's what's going to facilitate real change: not 
bureaucracies like the EU, not corrupt elitist parliaments like Westminster.

There needs to be more democracy, more voices - it can't just be the same 
middle class obsessions. More edgy, more dramatic, more of the big human issues 
that affect people, which are often economic or social issues. And more 
shagging.

I was moved by your description of how you made the journey from Labour “No” 
to a “Yes” vote in the referendum. As an English incomer – here for ~12 years – 
and also profoundly disillusioned with Labour I had recently made a very 
similar journey.

I would like to know whether – like me – you are struggling to return to 
“Labour” for the general election and whether they will attract your vote 
(quite understand that you might not want to indicate who you’ll be voting for).

I don't think there's anything to go back to with Labour. The party I grew up 
with is long dead. I've accepted that over a period of time. What to support 
next is the issue: I would support SNP at a Westminster election, but Green or 
SSP in Scottish parliamentary elections, because I don't think it's good to 
have a monolithic one party state evolving, even for a single-issue party.

Using social media as a platform by Big Publishing Houses, I’ve noticed a lot 
of pretty young things who have books coming out and blogs etc, but what about 
literary fiction, good prose, as it is not really “marketable”? What would you 
advise an unknown writer to go with their work? Self-publishing? I’ve recently 
done that myself. Also, what about a novel about Mikey Forrester and a big Drug 
Deal in say Latin America? There’s an idea for you. Thanks, Neil

Thanks for the Mikey Forrester idea! 

I think it's very tough for young writers because even if a publisher takes 
them on, they've basically got two books to hit the big time before they're 
forgotten about. They don't get the marketing muscle for a first book - they're 
expected to do it over social media and word of mouth. When I started out, we 
were really looked after: myself, Alan Warner, John King, we were at Cape at 
the same time, we were looked after in a way that young writers aren't 
nowadays. It's about immediate numbers, rather than building a long-term 
presence for the writer.

It's a hard one to do. Because as you know there's so many different aspects 
to that whole movement, fashion and music and camaraderie and local pride as 
well as actual violence, but you have to focus on the buzz of the violence. It 
becomes like any other adrenaline based movie: they have a great time and go in 
too far, and it becomes a cautionary tale. There's only one thing it can really 
be. I think The Football Factory is about the best, but there's been nothing 
absolutely definitive yet.

Yeah Andy Murray was apparently born in a Glasgow hospital, but grew up in

Hi Irvine,

Many of your books, especially Trainspotting

It's got really bad for young people in the last 20 years. There seems to be 
nothing for low-paid people, there's job insecurity, a lifetime of debt, little 
opportunity to get a decent education, living with your parents until you're 
nearly middle aged... if you're a kid, corporate fascism uses you as a tool to 
get to your parents' savings. It's bleak. Youth always have fun, it's always 
better being young than old, no question - but my generation have let down 
young people by not creating the inclusive, democratic, transparent society 
with genuine opportunities. All the promise of hippies and punks and acid 
house, it's never delivered on a political basis because the entrenched elites 
have been too strong and outmanoeuvred us. My generation lost the class war, 
and the youth are paying the price for that.

I don't think you can be disappointed if your book gets made into a film - if 
it's bad, you say they fucked up your book, if it's great, you can say it 
wouldn't have happened without your book. It's win-win.

You always have to remember the book is still going to be there, whatever 
happens to the film.

Because I write mainly on a laptop, or a manuscript printed from one, I can 
write pretty much anywhere. I write on public transit, coffee shops, but when I 
need quiet time to put everything together, I have to go to my work room, sit 
at a big desk, and go for it. Both really, I suppose.

I don't know. I'm cagey not because I doubt it'll be independent sometime, 
it's more in terms of being cagey about my own lifetime... who knows how long 
that'll be, it's impossible to say. I'm at the age now where I could drop down 
dead tomorrow, or live for years and years. I think it's inevitable that 
there's going to be some major transformation, and I can't see any future in 
the UK in its current form. It's about the inevitable breakup of the UK, rather 
than the independence of Scotland.

In some ways, I think because I was writing against the sort of trust fund 
middle class junkies like Trocchi and Burroughs - drugs had become a lot more 
democratic, before it had been the preserve of the idle rich. Or in voluntary 
poverty. They were inspirational, but not in the obvious way.

You don't really think about it, because it tends to happen incrementally. You 
get an acknowledgement first, and then some decent money coming in, then a bit 
of fame, and then bigger money and along the way that process usually takes 
about three or four years from your big successful book. And then it becomes 
something that you do. It creeps up on you. It seems to be overnight, but it 
doesn't feel that way - things change very slowly in your life over a five year 
period.

There's two things I do. I like to draw the characters in detail, I like the 
action to keep moving, so there's something inherently cinematic in that. 
You're kind of halfway there. That's why it's been successful.
