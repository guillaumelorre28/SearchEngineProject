Everyone loves a bellini, but who wants an out-of-season peach? This takes 
advantage of a great British fruit that is available in winter. The base keeps 
in the fridge for a few days, and makes enough for about 10 drinks. Serves two.

2 red william pears, cored and chopped
100g caster sugar
2-3 stalks semi-dried lavender 
Champagne (or prosecco), to top

Put the pears in a saucepan with the sugar, lavender and enough water to 
cover. Bring to a boil, simmer for 10 minutes, then discard the lavender. Blitz 
the mix with a hand blender and, while it’s still hot, pass through muslin 
stretched over a colander.

Once cool, pour 50ml of the strained liquid into each of two flutes, top with 
champagne and serve.

cocktail makes enough to serve 10.
