In response to Alys Fowler’s article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/07/alys-fowler-prune-deciduous-trees>
 on winter pruning (Weekend, 7 January), as an arborist I must point out some 
outdated guidance on tree management. Alys states: “As for what to cut, 
anything diseased, dying or dead goes first. Branches that are crossing and 
rubbing are next.” As trees are dynamic structures, exposed to environmental 
conditions, modern thinking is that crossing and rubbing branches are extremely 
important for trees, helping them create natural braces throughout their 
canopies. In fact, if left alone, rubbing branches can actually fuse together 
over time with no detriment to the tree itself. These natural braces help to 
lock the tree canopy together, reducing the risk of branch failure. If the 
brace is pruned out, particularly if it has been in place for a number of 
years, then this can increase the risk of branch or limb failure.
