A shootout looked on the cards as Kelvin Mellor’s early opener for Blackpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blackpool> was cancelled out by Angus 
MacDonald’s header, but Osayi-Samuel’s late effort decided it and Bowyer’s side 
advance to a fourth-round tie at Ewood Park, where he managed for three years.

Such a dramatic ending did not appear likely after an uneventful start, though 
Blackpool held their own from the off. And they deservedly took the lead in the 
30th minute whenBarnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> were 
caught napping at a set piece and Mellor drilled home from 10 yards.

The hosts did not have much to do to improve after the break and they needed 
only four minutes of the second half to draw level as MacDonald squeezed in a 
near-post header from Conor Hourihane’s corner with the aid of a deflection off 
the post and the goalkeeper Sam Slocombe.

It was MacDonald’s first goal for the club and it changed the complexion of 
the game, with Barnsley putting their foot on the throttle in search of a quick 
second.Blackpool weathered the storm, though, and saw the game through to 
extra-time. Barnsley increasingly bombarded their visitors as the extra 
half-hour progressed with Ryan Williams, Adam Hammill and Tom Bradshaw all 
going close before the sting in the tale. Osayi-Samuel sent a composed effort 
into the corner of the net from 14 yards to book a place in the fourth round.

Sunderland endured another miserable night at Turf Moor as they were knocked 
out of the FA Cup following a 2-0 loss atBurnley.

The Clarets’ fifth successive victory in east Lancashire was earned through 
Sam Vokes’s first-half header and a second from the substitute Andre Gray as 
they set up a home clash withBristol City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> in the next round.

Burnley were barely troubled by their fellow Premier League side, beaten 4-1 
at this venue on New Year’s Eve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/31/burnley-sunderland-premier-league-match-report-andre-gray>
, as it took 88 minutes for George Honeyman to produce their first attempt on 
target shortly before they were booed off by the travelling support.

The third meeting in 18 days between these two sides saw a combined 10 changes 
made from the weekend Premier League XIs. David Moyes had warned he would not 
risk Sunderland’s Premier League status at the expense of a cup run yet he made 
only three changes, though the top scorer Jermain Defoe was only on the bench, 
while his counterpart Sean Dyche made seven.

However, despite popping around passes in midfield for much of the first half, 
it was through a Vokes header on the stroke of half-time thatBurnley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley> led as the Welshman got in front 
of Jason Denayer to guide a Tendayi Darikwa cross beyond Mannone and into the 
far corner.

Burnley continued to look the likelier scorers and it was Gray who wrapped it 
up with seven minutes remaining. Eighteen days after scoring his first Premier 
League hat-trick, he finished off Boyd’s pass to beat Mannone once more.

The Bristol City manager Lee Johnson was delighted to secure a desperately 
needed win and a ticket to the fourth round of the FA Cup as his side ran out 
1-0 winners atFleetwood Town.

Jamie Paterson’s breakaway goal was enough to swing the tie in favour of City, 
who have been struggling badly in the Championship, and lift Johnson’s spirits. 
He said: “I wouldn’t say it was comfortable, that would be slightly 
disrespectful to a very good Fleetwood side who gave it a real go at the end.

“I thought we were nice and calm and controlled, we had a good number of 
chances and it’s nice to see our difficult run ended. We needed to get over the 
line. We shored it up towards the end and I was delighted for the players.

“Now we’re playing Burnley. It’s a Premier League club, it’s a real test. 
Their home form is very good but I don’t want to think about that now, we have 
to focus on the win and the league game at the weekend.”

The Fleetwood manager Uwe Rösler insisted his League One side had already 
exceeded expectations in reaching the third round, despite missing out on a 
Lancashire derby against Burnley.

Rosler said: “We cannot always play gung-ho football. We had a strategy for 
the game, we made one mistake, we lost a runner off one of our midfield 
players. But apart from that we were able to contain them. Our goal was always 
to stay in the game.

“The club had only been in the third round once before. From the football 
side, from the financial side, we over-achieved.”
