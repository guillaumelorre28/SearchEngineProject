Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> has encouraged 
women attending a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel to feel free to breastfeed 
their children in the church.


“The ceremony is a little long, someone’s crying because he’s hungry. That’s 
the way it is,” the pontiff said.

“You mothers, go ahead and breastfeed, without fear. Just like the Virgin Mary 
nursed Jesus,” he told worshippers attending an annual ceremony commemorating 
the baptism of Jesus.

The Argentine pope on Sunday baptised 28 children – 15 boys and 13 girls.

He has previously voiced his support for breastfeeding

, including in public.

The benefits of breastfeeding

 include providing optimal nutrition and an immune system boost for babies, 
while helping mothers bond with infants and speeding maternal weight loss after 
birth.

In many countries around the world, however, women are still widely 
discouraged from breastfeeding, especially in public.
