I read Proust when I was 17, and again when I was 27. Over Christmas I 
realised I’d better get it down from the shelf again while I was still 37. I 
read the Scott Moncrieff translation the first time, and then the second and 
third time a Penguin edition that has a different translator for each volume. 
It would be nice if I could remember enough about my previous experiences to 
contrast and compare. Well, I can’t, in any useful detail, but I know that I 
feel happy and alive, grateful and at peace while I’m reading Proust.

Arnaud Desplechin’s films speak to my blood. His characters are dashing and 
serious: loyal to their loves, unafraid of enmity, and they shoulder their 
various commitments with a beautiful pride and a natural panache. In his 
previous film,Trois souvenirs de ma jeunesse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/cesar-film-award-nominations-announced>
, Mathieu Amalric’s Paul Dédalus responds to an accusation that he should calm 
down about an old betrayal by saying he likes the word ‘intact’ for these 
emotions: “Un amour intact! Un chagrin intact! Ma fureur intacte!” Ismaël (also 
played by Amalric) has appeared in Desplechin’s work before (Rois et reine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/jun/12/features.review27>, 2004) 
and I’m keen to see him again when this film comes out. Desplechin directed 
Strindberg’sThe Father a couple of years back, at the Comédie-Française theatre 
in Paris. I wish I could have seen that.

My husband had me listen to this poem recently – you can hear Riley (no 
relation)read it out here 
<http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n03/denise-riley/a-part-song>. It’s an elegy in which 
the poet addresses her dead son. It makes me think of a phrase of Nabokov’s from
Transparent Things 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/11/transparent-things-vladimir-nabokov-review>
: “the dungeon of the irreparable”. The poem is an attempt to undo what’s done, 
through wit, cajolement and direct appeal to her now “indifferent lad”. She 
tunes the song to this end. It’s a fierce stand and unbearably sad. It’s about 
as racking a work of art as I’ve ever encountered. The collection it comes from 
is calledSay Something Back, and I’m going to read that next.

 Roger Allam and Shaun Evans in Endeavour. 
I never cared for Inspector Morse. He seemed boorish and simpering. It’s 
rather miserable to know that’s how the sensitive and intelligent young man in 
[prequel]Endeavour ends up. But that’s life. I love these mysteries. Russell 
Lewis’s scripts are great and Shaun Evans has an affecting wariness as Morse. 
Roger Allam’s Fred Thursday is my favourite, though. He’s better than Bogart, 
he’s so noble. And having had a busy war, he’s naturally low on reserves of 
patience for cruelty, stupidity, pettiness and wickedness. I enjoy watching him 
deal with the criminal classes. I like his laconicism, especially the curtailed 
phrases and sayings he deploys: “Sworn to.” “Happy as.” “Every dog.”

We went on holiday a few years ago to Portland in Dorset, which was the 
setting for Hardy’s last published novel,The Well-Beloved 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/well-beloved-with-the-pursuit-of-the-well-beloved.html>
. That features a sculptor who leaves the island, and his sweetheart, for the 
salons of London. Does he find what he’s looking for? Well, not exactly. (In 
fact the book is like Proust in miniature, in a way. The sculptor, Jocelyn 
Pierston, is in search of an ideal woman who is lost in time.) I’ve just 
finished Ford’s book, which concentrates on Hardy’s years in London, as a young 
apprentice architect and later as a literary personage. I find Hardy’s 
character and sensibility very appealing, and this book was full of subtle 
insights into both.

 ‘Formidable’: Ruth Wilson with Rafe Spall in Hedda Gabler. Photograph: Jan 
Versweyveld 
Having tickets to the production at the National gave me the impetus to read 
this play. I’ve enjoyed thinking about Hedda. She is evil, I think, and abject. 
I don’t know that she needs valorising, but I didn’t enjoy seeing her strings 
pulled either. I’d like to see this play again in a different production. I 
wasn’t overwhelmed with enthusiasm for this one - I struggled to find much of 
Ibsen’s uncanny understanding of women on display. Instead this seemed nervous 
about Hedda, standing one step back before spitefully punishing her. 
Nonetheless, Ruth Wilson as Hedda was formidable.

This interview is a couple of years old – Dylan had just released Shadows in 
the Night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/29/bob-dylan-shadows-in-the-night-review>
 - but it’s stayed with me. The interviewer asks good questions and I learned a 
lot. I must have time on my mind because Dylan’s thoughts on time keep coming 
back to me: “Life has its ups and downs, and time has to be your partner, you 
know? Really, time is your soul mate.” I first saw Dylan at the Liverpool 
Empire about 20 years ago. In my memory, at least, he opened with Man in the 
Long Black Coat, and I got the shivers.
