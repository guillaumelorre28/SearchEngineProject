Denny Solomona’s controversial switch of rugby codes has moved a step closer 
after he was registered bySale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/salesharks> 
for the European Champions Cup.

The 23-year-old Samoa winger remains contracted to the Super League club 
Castleford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/24/castleford-legal-case-denny-solomona-rfl>
 for whom he scored a record 42 tries in 2016. He failed to report for 
pre-season training in November and is thought instead to have linked up with 
Sale.

Sale have made no comment since the director of rugby, Steve Diamond, 
confirmed his club’s interest in the player, claiming he had resigned from 
rugby league.

Along with the former Wigan and England winger Josh Charnley, Solomona has 
been added to Sale’s Champions Cup squad for Saturday’s against Saracens at 
Allianz Park, with Nick Scott and Will Addison being deregistered.

Solomona will not make his debut against Saracens but will be eligible to play 
later in the competition and could be announced as a Sale player early next 
week.

Castleford <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castleford> are ready to take 
the matter to the high court for a case that could have major ramifications for 
rugby league. The club, who say they rejected three offers for a player who has 
two years left on his contract, have appointed the leading barrister Nick 
Randall QC, whose other clients include the England captain Wayne Rooney, and 
the Leeds-based sports lawyer Richard Cramer to fight their case.

Neither Castleford nor Sale were prepared to make any comment but the Rugby 
Football League has made it clear it would support the Super League club, 
warning of anarchy if Solomona is allowed to walk away from his contract. The 
RFL is investigating the player’s agent, Andy Clarke.

In a recent statement, the RFL chief executive, Nigel Wood, said: “Contracts 
are two-way commitments mutually binding on both parties. The RFL will support 
its member clubs absolutely to defend their contractual positions and will work 
with other similarly inclined governing bodies to ensure the unacceptable 
potential anarchy of lawful contracts simply being walked away from is not 
tolerated.”

Solomona, who left Melbourne to join London Broncos in 2014, was named in the 
2016 Super League dream team and shortlisted for the man of steel award after 
breaking Lesley Vainikolo’s record of 40 tries in a Super League season. He 
made his Samoa debut against Fiji in October.
