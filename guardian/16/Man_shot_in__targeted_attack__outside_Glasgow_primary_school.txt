A man has been shot in an apparently targeted attack outside a primary school 
in south-west Glasgow.

A heavy police presence remains in place in the suburb of Penilee after the 
incident at about 9.05am near St George’s RC primary school on Muirdykes Road.

Police said the man was being treated in hospital, where his condition was 
described as stable. He has been named locally as Ross Monaghan, 35, who was 
acquitted of murdering gangster Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll in 2012 after a court 
decided there was not enough evidence to convict him.

STV News reported that Monaghan was shot in the back and side after dropping 
off his children at the school. The gunman is believed to be on the run.

 Ch Insp Simon Jeacocke said it was “a highly unusual incident” and parents, 
staff and pupils were understandably very alarmed. “We do believe it was a 
targeted attack but nonetheless this took place near to a local primary school 
at the start of the school day, when the area was busy with parents dropping 
off their children,” he said.

 “Although it would appear that there was an intended victim, anyone could 
have been injured as a result, putting young children and innocent people at 
risk. The pupils are now safe at school and additional police patrols are in 
the area to provide extra reassurance over the next couple of days. Please do 
not hesitate to approach my officers if you are concerned at all.”

Detectives were carrying out inquiries to establish the full circumstances of 
the incident and appealed to anyone who might have seen anything or been in the 
area at the time to contact police.

 The council said all staff and pupils were safe and the school remained open.

The local councillor Alistair Watson said parents were worried about the 
safety of their children. “[The] kids are the number one priority, to make sure 
they are safe,” he said. “Penilee is a good area with lots of very good people 
here. I have to commend the police for their operation. They have been very on 
the ball with this incident.”

Carroll, 29, a member of the Daniel crime clan in north Glasgow, was shot dead 
in an Asda car park in 2010 after a long-running feud with the rival Lyons 
family. Monaghan was charged with Carroll’s murder, but the trial collapsed 
when a judge ruled there was no case to answer due to a lack of evidence.
