The West Ham United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited> 
co-chairman David Sullivan has vowed not to let Dimitri Payet leave this month.

The France international told his manager, Slaven Bilic, this week that he 
wishes to leave the club

“The board’s position is that we do not want to sell Dimitri, we do not need 
to sell Dimitri for financial or any other reasons, and we will NOT sell 
Dimitri in the January transfer window,” Sullivan said, in his programme notes 
before the Palace match.

“All we ask now is that he shows the same level of commitment to West Ham 
United as the club and the fans have shown to him by honouring his contract.”

West Ham’s fans are understandably angry at Payet’s actions, so much so that a 
steward was placed in front of a mural of the midfielder outside the London 
Stadium on Saturday to prevent it being vandalised.
