Two bridges cross the river, 300 metres and an aesthetic mile apart. A little 
downstream, 18th-century builders had carried the old Great North Road over the 
Ivel in the only way they knew, fashioning pretty arches from local stone and a
humpbacked road <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/10/maevkennedy> wide 
enough for two carriages to pass.

Here, their 20th-century counterparts twinned it with something bigger. 
Committed to a four-lane, prosaically named A1, they used an all-prevailing 
material that could be relied on for strength, durability and ugliness.

Passersby above see a road, railings and catch a sideways glance over water. 
We who live here and walk through the riverside underpass beneath see in the 
concrete a patina of grossness, discolouration as it weathers, the stains and 
dribbles as chemicals leach and bubble out, and the inevitable graffiti 
splashed over the drab walls.

Yet even here, there are times when the sun pierces such blight with beauty. 
On one frosty morning, short drainage pipes suspended from the roof had become 
icicle nurseries, the frozen spears pearling at the tips and dripping in slow 
motion as a thaw began.

All summer long cattle in the river meadow had used the underpass as a 
cowshed, huddling for shelter from the elements between the columns. Long since 
taken off to market, the animals lived on in the pockmarks of hoofprints, a 
patterned floor mosaic of shaded hollows and bright rims.

Spiders' shining threads turn lifeless gardens silver

Somehow, a single spider’s web had outlasted the comings and goings of the 
herd. A shaft of sunlight picked out the dusty thread, stretched from floor to 
ceiling like an anchoring guy rope. Sunbeams stole across to illuminate the 
whole underpass. Striped shadows of columns streaked over the floor, the 
graffiti glowed black, blue and petrol-purple as if it were a wall painting. I 
half imagined this underworld as a hallowed church or cathedral crypt.

There was a choir here too. It chattered ceaselessly as it ran over the joints 
between the concrete on the roof above. A hypnotic chant of traffic, it sang 
the same song over and over – “the-dum, the-dum, the-dum”.
