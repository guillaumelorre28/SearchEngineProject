Blackwell’s boxing licence had been withdrawn before November’s ill-advised 
sparring session, after collapsing at the end ofhis defeat by Chris Eubank Jnr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/19/nick-blackwell-boxing-chris-eubank-jr-no-hard-feelings>
 in March. On that occasion he was found to have suffered a bleed on the skull 
and was put into an induced coma. Blackwell then made a full recovery and 
subsequently announced his retirement from the sport.

Following his sparring session, Blackwell regained consciousness from a coma 
just before Christmas and was said to be “smiling again”, according to his 
brother Daniel.
