What are 'cookies'?

'Cookies' are small text files that are stored by the browser (for example, 
Internet Explorer or Safari) on your computer or mobile phone. They allow 
websites to store things like user preferences. You can think of cookies as 
providing a 'memory' for the website, so that it can recognise you when you 
come back and respond appropriately.



How does the Guardian's website use cookies?

A visit to a page on the Guardian's website may generate the following types 
of cookie:

Site performance cookies <>
Anonymous analytics cookies <>
Geotargetting cookies <>
Registration cookies <>
Advertising cookies <>
Third party advertising cookies <>

For a visual representation of the different types of cookies used on the 
Guardian's website click on the button below:



Site performance cookies

This type of cookie remembers your preferences for tools found on the 
Guardian's website, so you don't have to re-set them each time you visit. 
Examples include:

- volume settings for our video player
- whether you see the latest or the oldest article comments first
- video streaming speeds that are compatible with your browser



Anonymous analytics cookies:

Every time someone visits our website, software provided by another 
organisation generates an 'anonymous analytics cookie'.
These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before.
Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies and, if you don't, we 
generate new ones.
This allows us to track how many individual users we have, and how often they 
visit the site.
Unless you are signed in to the Guardian, we cannot use these cookies to 
identify individuals. We use them to gather statistics, for example, the number 
of visits to a page. If you are logged in, we will also know the details you 
gave to us for this, such as your username and email address.



Geotargetting cookies

These cookies are used by software which tries to work out what country you 
are in from the information supplied by your browser when you click on a web 
page. This cookie is completely anonymous, and we only use it to help target 
our content – such as whether you see our UK or US home page – and advertising.



Registration cookies

When you register with the Guardian, we generate cookies that let us know 
whether you are signed in or not.
Our servers use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in 
with, and if you are allowed access to a particular service. It also allows us 
to associate any comments you post with your username.
If you have not selected 'keep me signed in', your cookies get deleted when 
you either close your browser or shut down your computer.
While you are signed into either of the sites, we combine information from 
your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to 
identify which pages you have seen on the Guardian.



Advertising cookies

These cookies allow us to know whether or not you've seen an advert or a type 
of advert, and how long it is since you've seen it.
We also use cookies to help us use targeted advertising. We may use cookies 
set by another organization so we can more accurately target advertising to 
you. For example, we may show adverts about holidays if you have recently 
visited the travel section of our site. These cookies are anonymous – they 
store information about what you are looking at on our site, but not about who 
you are.
We also set anonymous cookies on certain other sites that we advertise on. If 
you receive one of those cookies, we may then use it to identify you as having 
visited that site if you later visit the Guardian. We can then target our 
advertising based on this information.



Third party advertising cookies

A lot of the advertisements you see on the Guardian are provided by other 
organisations. Some of these organisations use their own anonymous cookies to 
track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many people 
have seen it more than once.
The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy> policies, and we have no 
access to read or write these cookies. These organizations may use their 
cookies to anonymously target advertising to you on other websites, based on 
your visit to the Guardian.



Other third party cookies

On some pages of our website, other organisations may also set their own 
anonymous cookies. They do this to track the success of their application, or 
to customise the application for you. Because of how cookies work, our website 
cannot access these cookies, nor can the other organisation access the data in 
cookies we use on our website.
For example, when you share an article using a social-media sharing button 
(for example, Facebook) on the Guardian, the social network that has created 
the button will record that you have done this.



How do I turn cookies off?

It is usually possible to stop your browser accepting cookies, or to stop it 
accepting cookies from a particular website. However, we cannot tell if you are 
signed in without using cookies, so you would not be able to post comments.
All modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. You can usually 
find these settings in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your browser. To 
understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, or you can use 
the 'Help' option in your browser for more details.
