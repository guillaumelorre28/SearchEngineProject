Our neighbours grow apples commercially and their five acres supply both the 
community in autumn and the thrushes during winter. Recently I fulfilled a 
long-held promise to erect a hide and watch the birds among the windfalls 
there. First I had to gather several barrowfuls of my own, which was itself a 
memorable exercise. While I raked the wasp-mined Bramleys my boots mulched down 
the flesh, sending up a sweet foetor and leaving geometrically patterned cakes 
of apple mud underfoot.

Once I’d tipped 100lb of fruit in a sunlit heap by the hide, I retired to 
steep the whole scene in silence, before returning next day.

The blackbirds

 all about. Befitting their relative physical proportions, the latter’s calls 
are coarser and larger. They have a jarring quality, an element of awkwardness, 
like twisted rubber, as if an indefinable force of effort went into the making.

Beyond the penumbra of fear

They are wilder than blackbird sounds, too, without any hint of domestication, 
for fieldfares are a rough tribe from Europe’s boreal woodlands. It’s not 
uncommon to see two fight over fruit for minutes on end, each lunging 
alternately at the other, as if strings controlled the rise and fall of their 
squabble.

The flock slowly summoned courage to feed as one, although sudden, 
hard-fletched panic was a common interruption. I came to appreciate how the 
chakking notes are a permanent anxiety-filled force-field about fieldfares that 
governs their social lives and oversees their security.

They maintain it with good reason: one morning I came back to find a 
sparrowhawk

nest of beautiful feathers around the death spot.


But desire trumped fear, and down they plumped, mixing thick impasto ochres 
and burnt chocolate and smoky blue-greys into the lime green and orange of 
rotting fruit. Yet this was not art but life, and when all settled to feed, 
gulping simultaneously, heads and throats quivering as they snaked down apple 
pulp, the whole scene seemed to pullulate like a hill of maggots.

It was an object lesson in survival, in the exigencies of thrush hunger and 
the imperishable abundance of an English winter.
