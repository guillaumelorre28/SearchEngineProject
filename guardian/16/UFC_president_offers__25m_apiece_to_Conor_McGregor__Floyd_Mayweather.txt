UFC president Dana White said on Friday that he would pay $25m apiece to Floyd 
Mayweather <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/floyd-mayweather> Jr and and MMA 
star Conor McGregor for a presumed boxing match with the split of additional 
pay-per-view revenue between the fighters to be determined.


White’s offer, put forth on Colin Cowherd’s sports talk radio show on Fox 
Sports Radio, comes two days after Mayweather, the five-division champion who 
retired undefeated from boxing nearly a year and a half ago, saidhe would fight 
McGregor for a base purse of $100m

 with McGregor taking home a career-high $15m plus a minor cut of the 
pay-per-view receipts.

“I’ll tell you what Floyd, here’s a real offer,” White said. “I’m the only guy 
that can actually make the offer and I’m actually making a real offer: We’ll 
pay you $25 million, we’ll pay Conor $25 million and then we’ll talk about 
pay-per-view at a certain number. There’s a real offer.”

Mayweather, who is in New York to support Badou Jack’s bid to unify super 
middleweight titles against James DeGale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/13/james-degale-badou-jack-super-middleweight>
 on Saturday night, dismissed White’s offer out of hand.

“He’s a fucking comedian,” Mayweather said in a brief interview with TMZ.com.

Mayweather earned a guaranteed base purse of $32m for his most recent fight, a 
unanimous-win decision over Andre Berto in September 2015. That was down from a 
minimum of $100m for his previous fight against Manny Pacquiao, not including a 
portion of the pay-per-view revenue reported to be in the high eight-figure 
range.

McGregor’s highest disclosed purse in MMA is $3m. The Irishman last fought in 
November, when he knocked out Eddie Alvarez for the UFC lightweight title inUFC
