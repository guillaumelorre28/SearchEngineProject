Twelve solutions (not further defined) belong to one of two groups, which 
combined lead to a 23 25. The definitions in each of the remaining clues 
contain a single letter misprint. These incorrect letters, in clue order, spell 
out two possible locations for another sort of 23 25.


NB The following solution counts are for more than one word:

 Across
19 (3,3)
23,25 (6,6)

Down
6 (3,5)
