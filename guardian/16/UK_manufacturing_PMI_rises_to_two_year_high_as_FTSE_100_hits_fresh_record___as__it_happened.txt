Closing summary

The FTSE 100 is still trading 0.6% higher at 7,188.41, up 45.52 points, 
leaving it on track for another record close. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is 
eyeing the 20,000 level – it’s currently 0.67% ahead at 19,895.87. Crude oil 
prices are up more than 2% as production cuts kick in.

The main economic news today was a strong UK manufacturing survey, a 
bigger-than-expected drop in German unemployment and a pick-up in inflation in 
Germany and France – all taking economists by surprise.

With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great 
comments. We’ll be back tomorrow.

German inflation hits 3 1/2 year high

Inflation in Germany unexpectedly jumped to the highest level in three and a 
half years, official data showed today. The annual rate rose to 1.7% in 
December, the highest since July 2013, and compared with 0.7% the month before.

The increase which comes alongside a pick-up in inflation in France and Spain 
provides ammunition for those at the European Central Bank who are arguing for 
a gradual exit from the bank’s unconventional stimulus programme.

UK grocery prices rose slightly between November and December, but prices 
remained below 2015 due to competition among supermarkets, according to data 
from price tracking website mysupermarket.com.

A shopping basket of 35 commonly bought items cost £83.33 in December, up from 
£83.18 in November. Fresh fruit and veg cost more such as bananas, grapes and 
carrots.

But the basket was still nearly 3% cheaper than it was in December 2015, as 
fierce competition between supermarkets limited their ability to raise prices. 
Economists and retail experts expect food inflation to rise this year because 
the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote is pushing up the cost of imported 
goods.

The tracker covers nearly 5,000 products across Tesco, Asda, Aldi, 
Sainsbury’s, Ocado, Lidl and Morrisons.

Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

Importantly, the delay means that the Trump administration, which has in the 
past suggested it wants to relax banking regulation, will now be involved in 
signing off the new proposals. The proposals are already contentious, but 
whether they will be weakened remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, the retail sector has an early dose of the January blues, he noted, 
with Next, Dixons Carphone and Marks & Spencer the biggest fallers on the FTSE 
100 today. Halfords is still the biggest loser in the FTSE 350 index.

Those with substantial import costs have been hit particularly hard, after 
Deutsche Bank flagged the potential for lower sterling to lead to higher 
inflation in a research note released this morning. With the note highlighting 
the difficulties a weak pound could bring to Halfords’ already increasing cost 
base, shares in the UK’s leading retailer of motoring and cycling products fell 
by 5.6%.

Our City editor Jill Treanor writes: 

Global regulators have postponed a meeting to agree major reforms to the 
banking sector prompted by the 2008 crisis.

A leading group of central bankers was due to meet on 8 January to agree 
changes that could have forced some banks - largely in Europe - to hold more 
capital. But it was announced on Tuesday that the meeting had been called off.

No new date was given for the meeting of central bankers - known as the group 
of central bank governors and heads of supervision (GHOS) - who were due to 
discuss rules that influence how much capital banks hold and the way they 
measure the risks they are taking.

Banks are the biggest risers on the FTSE 100, led by Barclays which is up 4%, 
after global regulators delayed the sign off of new rules on bank 
capitalisation. Lloyds Banking Group is 3.6% ahead while Royal Bank of Scotland 
has risen 3.3%, Standard Chartered 2.4% and HSBC is up 2%.

Mining shares, which have been among the big winners of the weak pound in the 
past year, are also among the biggest gainers, including Antofagasta and 
Glencore.

UK drivers pay £8.25 a tank more for fuel than a year ago

Oil prices have been rising as new production cuts take effect, as reported 
earlier. This is feeding through to petrol prices. UK drivers are paying 15p a 
litre – or £8.25 a tank – more for their fuel than a year ago, according to the 
AA.

Petrol over the weekend averaged 117.90p a litre compared to 102.69p at the 
same time last year, a price last seen in December 2014. Diesel has risen to 
120.35p from 105.99p 12 months ago.

AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said:

Drivers have had a bad start to 2017, seeing 1p, 2p and even 3p ticking up on 
the fuel price boards over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Petrol is 
back to where it was in December 2014 and diesel at a level last seen in July 
2015.

All in all, with the cold weather, it’s been a pretty miserable return to work.

As speculation continues over where banks based in London and elsewhere in the 
UK might choose to settle after Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/banks-consider-contingency-plans-brexit-looms>
, we hear today from the boss of American bank JP Morgan.


Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, has been speaking 
about his hopes for the investment bank’s UK operations once Brexit becomes a 
reality toFinancial News.

Dimon said he worries Brexit will have repercussions for the rest of the 
European Union.

“A major fear to me about Brexit is that it causes the EU to fail down the 
road,” he told Financial News in the interview at JP Morgan’s Victoria 
Embankment offices in London.

Financial News says Dimon also proclaimed a “love” for London, but provided no 
reassurance that JP Morgan wouldn’t move business from the City to the 
continent after Brexit takes effect.

“I wish we could keep it all here [in London],” said Dimon. “I think it’s very 
good for Europe.”

vote to leave would cost jobs. It said4,000 jobs could go

The FTSE 100 has not managed to hold on to all its earlier gains, when it 
pushed through the 7,200 mark, but still looks on track for another record 
close.

The index of London-listed bluechips is currently up 31 points at 7,174, having
closed at an all-time high of 7,142.83 on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/30/ftse-100-2016-all-time-high-dollar-earners-donald-trump>
, the last trading day of 2016.

The futures market is also pointing to a strong start to 2017 for Wall Street.

Much of the support for the FTSE has come from the weak pound, which is down 
sharply since last June’s Brexit vote. The weak pound flatters the earnings of 
those FTSE 100 companies that report in dollars. It has also helped those firms 
who export from Britain and it makes assets priced in pounds more attractive to 
foreign investors.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex expects the 
FTSE 100 to remain in positive territory in afternoon trading but said the 
pound’s strength was limiting gains. He also expects gains on Wall Street for 
the Dow Jones industrial average index. Campbell commented:


It appears that this morning’s December manufacturing PMI reading... hampered 
the FTSE’s record-breaking surge by giving a boost to the pound. In the 
aftermath of the PMI release sterling jumped 0.6% against the euro, taking it 
back above 1.18 for the first time in a week and a half; this was enough to 
temper the FTSE’s growth, despite the fact that the pound is continuing to 
struggle against the dollar...

Looking ahead to this afternoon and following a bitterly disappointing end to 
2016 that saw the index fail to break 20,000 the Dow Jones is set to recover 
some of its losses this Tuesday. The Dow futures are suggesting the index will 
reclaim around 150 points, pushing it above 19900 and putting that elusive 
landmark level back on the cards.

The upbeat PMI report on the UK’s manufacturing industry caught City analysts 
off guard. But they have been quick to point out the divergence between the PMI 
survey and official data which paints a gloomier picture of the factory sector 
and many also highlight the threat that higher inflation in 2017 will squeeze 
consumer spending, the biggest driver of economic growth in the UK.


The outlook remains one of a marked slowdown for the UK economy this year, 
says James Knightley, senior economist at the bank ING.

He commented:


This [the PMI reading] is the strongest figure since June 2014 and again 
suggests that the Brexit referendum has not harmed the UK’s manufacturing 
sector. In fact, the 18% post referendum plunge in the value of the pound 
against other major currencies has boosted the UK’s competitiveness on the 
international stage. This is being seen in the new orders component with export 
orders performing well.

However, sterling’s fall also means that imported components are more 
expensive with both costs and output prices rising yet again. This increase in 
domestic pipeline inflation pressures is being mirrored by higher costs for 
imported consumer goods and energy. As such, the squeeze on household spending 
power is set to intensify. So while the strength of the manufacturing sector is 
good news, the likely weakness in the much larger consumer sector will more 
than offset it. Therefore we expect GDP growth to slow to a little above 1% in 
2017 from 2.2% in 2016.

A new network to link up Irish and British trading partners has been formed to 
offset any negative Brexit impact on trade between the UK and Ireland, reports 
Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent.

The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has launched the ‘British Irish Gateway 
to Trade’ service, which link up firms from both sides of the Irish Sea.

Britain remains Ireland’s biggest trading partner with business between the UK 
and the Republic supporting 400,000 jobs according to the British Irish Chamber 
of Commerce. Its chairman John McGrane said the network would promote more 
growth in trade between Ireland and the UK in the face of the Brexit challenge.

McGrane said: 

At a time when businesses are preparing for Brexit, they appreciate a resource 
like BIG which helps them to grow their business by being introduced to more 
customers and suppliers across the UK and Ireland”.

2017 will focus all our minds on the importance of the trade between Britain 
and Ireland which supports over 400,000 jobs. Firms on both sides of the Irish 
Sea are looking for more trading opportunities and this new service supports 
the work of Chambers and the various state agencies to make those connections 
easier to find for businesses north south east and west.

The new service lets businesses find the trading partners they want within a 
trusted network of like-minded firms across the two islands.

More reaction to the strong UK manufacturing PMI. Samuel Tombs, chief UK 
economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, doesn’t believe it will last.

UK manufacturing is benefiting from both continued brisk growth in domestic 
demand as well as improving global demand, but this momentum likely will peter 
out in 2017.

The pick-up in the total orders balance to 58.5 from 55.2 suggests 
manufacturing output will continue to grow briskly over the next couple of 
months. Meanwhile, the fact that the UK’s PMI exceeds those for the eurozone 
and U.S., 54.9 and 54.2 respectively, signals that the UK economy is continuing 
to marginally outperform.

The relationship between the PMI and the official data, however, has been 
particularly loose lately; the PMI has signalled steady growth in manufacturing 
output since August, but the official data have oscillated around a flat trend.

Meanwhile, we continue to think that domestic demand for manufactured goods 
will crumble as consumers experience a renewed squeeze on their real incomes, 
driven mainly by higher import prices. At the same time, the boost to growth 
from sterling’s depreciation will remain relatively modest, because exporters 
have raised sterling prices sharply and because uncertainty about the UK’s 
future trade relationships will deter exporters from investing.

Oil prices hit 18-month highs

Oil prices have pushed even higher, to 18-month highs, boosted by hopes that a 
deal to cut production between Opec and non-Opec producers such as Russia will 
diminish the global oil glut. Brent crude jumped about 2.5% to $58.37 a barrel, 
the highest since July 2015.

Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 

December’s UK Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI provides further evidence that the 
sector’s post-referendum weakness will prove short-lived... A rise in overall 
new orders to a two-and-a-half year high suggests that the strength in 
manufacturing activity will continue in the coming months. Admittedly, the fall 
in the pound is having a clear impact on price pressures. Indeed, despite 
falling back from 79.1 in November to 76.9 in December, the input prices 
balance remained well above its long-run average (55.1).

Nonetheless, on the basis of past form, the three-month average of the 
survey’s output balance is consistent with a quarterly rise in manufacturing 
output of about 1% in Q4, following Q3’s 0.8% contraction. This is consistent 
with other survey evidence, such as the CBI’s Industrial Trends Survey, which 
suggest that the manufacturing sector gained some momentum at the end of 2016 
too.

That said, given the sharp monthly fall in October in the official figures, 
even a large increase in output in November and December would probably not be 
enough to lead to a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q4. A stronger end 
to the quarter would, however, provide a good base for manufacturing growth in 
Q1. As such, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced 
in the quarters ahead.

The FTSE 100 is still trading 0.6% higher at 7,188.41, up 45.52 points, 
leaving it on track for another record close. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is 
eyeing the 20,000 level – it’s currently 0.67% ahead at 19,895.87. Crude oil 
prices are up more than 2% as production cuts kick in.

The main economic news today was a strong UK manufacturing survey, a 
bigger-than-expected drop in German unemployment and a pick-up in inflation in 
Germany and France – all taking economists by surprise.

With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great 
comments. We’ll be back tomorrow.

 
Inflation in Germany unexpectedly jumped to the highest level in three and a 
half years, official data showed today. The annual rate rose to 1.7% in 
December, the highest since July 2013, and compared with 0.7% the month before.

The increase which comes alongside a pick-up in inflation in France and Spain 
provides ammunition for those at the European Central Bank who are arguing for 
a gradual exit from the bank’s unconventional stimulus programme.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is up more than 150 points, or 0.8%, at 
19,915.73 at the open, flirting with the 20,000 mark. The Nasdaq is more than 
40 points ahead at 5,424.16 while the S&P 500 is some 17 points higher at 
2,255.81, both gains of nearly 0.8%.
 
UK grocery prices rose slightly between November and December, but prices 
remained below 2015 due to competition among supermarkets, according to data 
from price tracking website mysupermarket.com.

A shopping basket of 35 commonly bought items cost £83.33 in December, up from 
£83.18 in November. Fresh fruit and veg cost more such as bananas, grapes and 
carrots.

But the basket was still nearly 3% cheaper than it was in December 2015, as 
fierce competition between supermarkets limited their ability to raise prices. 
Economists and retail experts expect food inflation to rise this year because 
the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote is pushing up the cost of imported 
goods.

The tracker covers nearly 5,000 products across Tesco, Asda, Aldi, 
Sainsbury’s, Ocado, Lidl and Morrisons.
 
Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

Importantly, the delay means that the Trump administration, which has in the 
past suggested it wants to relax banking regulation, will now be involved in 
signing off the new proposals. The proposals are already contentious, but 
whether they will be weakened remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, the retail sector has an early dose of the January blues, he noted, 
with Next, Dixons Carphone and Marks & Spencer the biggest fallers on the FTSE 
100 today. Halfords is still the biggest loser in the FTSE 350 index.

Those with substantial import costs have been hit particularly hard, after 
Deutsche Bank flagged the potential for lower sterling to lead to higher 
inflation in a research note released this morning. With the note highlighting 
the difficulties a weak pound could bring to Halfords’ already increasing cost 
base, shares in the UK’s leading retailer of motoring and cycling products fell 
by 5.6%.
 
Our City editor Jill Treanor writes: 

Global regulators have postponed a meeting to agree major reforms to the 
banking sector prompted by the 2008 crisis.

A leading group of central bankers was due to meet on 8 January to agree 
changes that could have forced some banks - largely in Europe - to hold more 
capital. But it was announced on Tuesday that the meeting had been called off.

No new date was given for the meeting of central bankers - known as the group 
of central bank governors and heads of supervision (GHOS) - who were due to 
discuss rules that influence how much capital banks hold and the way they 
measure the risks they are taking.

Banks are the biggest risers on the FTSE 100, led by Barclays which is up 4%, 
after global regulators delayed the sign off of new rules on bank 
capitalisation. Lloyds Banking Group is 3.6% ahead while Royal Bank of Scotland 
has risen 3.3%, Standard Chartered 2.4% and HSBC is up 2%.

Mining shares, which have been among the big winners of the weak pound in the 
past year, are also among the biggest gainers, including Antofagasta and 
Glencore.
 
Oil prices have been rising as new production cuts take effect, as reported 
earlier. This is feeding through to petrol prices. UK drivers are paying 15p a 
litre – or £8.25 a tank – more for their fuel than a year ago, according to the 
AA.

Petrol over the weekend averaged 117.90p a litre compared to 102.69p at the 
same time last year, a price last seen in December 2014. Diesel has risen to 
120.35p from 105.99p 12 months ago.

AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said:

Drivers have had a bad start to 2017, seeing 1p, 2p and even 3p ticking up on 
the fuel price boards over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Petrol is 
back to where it was in December 2014 and diesel at a level last seen in July 
2015.

All in all, with the cold weather, it’s been a pretty miserable return to work.

UK workers’ confidence has not been shaken by uncertainty around leaving the 
European Union, with 48% saying that they are looking for a new job this year, 
according to specialist recruiter Reed. It asked more than 2,000 people about

The FTSE 100 has hit fresh all-time highs on the first trading day of the year 
in London, building on its record close at the end of 2016. It rose through the 
7,200 mark earlier to a new record of 7,205.21 and is now more than 30 points 
ahead at 7,176.20, a 0.5% gain. The leading index is on track for another 
record close if it holds on to its gains.

Retailers are among the biggest fallers, led by Next, which was downgraded by 
Deutsche Bank ahead of a Christmas trading update tomorrow. Dixons Carphone, 
Marks & Spencer and Kingfisher are also down.

<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/banks-consider-contingency-plans-brexit-looms>
, we hear today from the boss of American bank JP Morgan.


Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, has been speaking 
about his hopes for the investment bank’s UK operations once Brexit becomes a 
reality toFinancial News.

Dimon said he worries Brexit will have repercussions for the rest of the 
European Union.

“A major fear to me about Brexit is that it causes the EU to fail down the 
road,” he told Financial News in the interview at JP Morgan’s Victoria 
Embankment offices in London.

Financial News says Dimon also proclaimed a “love” for London, but provided no 
reassurance that JP Morgan wouldn’t move business from the City to the 
continent after Brexit takes effect.

“I wish we could keep it all here [in London],” said Dimon. “I think it’s very 
good for Europe.”

vote to leave would cost jobs. It said4,000 jobs could go

.
 
The FTSE 100 has not managed to hold on to all its earlier gains, when it 
pushed through the 7,200 mark, but still looks on track for another record 
close.

The index of London-listed bluechips is currently up 31 points at 7,174, having
closed at an all-time high of 7,142.83 on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/30/ftse-100-2016-all-time-high-dollar-earners-donald-trump>
, the last trading day of 2016.

The futures market is also pointing to a strong start to 2017 for Wall Street.

Much of the support for the FTSE has come from the weak pound, which is down 
sharply since last June’s Brexit vote. The weak pound flatters the earnings of 
those FTSE 100 companies that report in dollars. It has also helped those firms 
who export from Britain and it makes assets priced in pounds more attractive to 
foreign investors.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex expects the 
FTSE 100 to remain in positive territory in afternoon trading but said the 
pound’s strength was limiting gains. He also expects gains on Wall Street for 
the Dow Jones industrial average index. Campbell commented:


It appears that this morning’s December manufacturing PMI reading... hampered 
the FTSE’s record-breaking surge by giving a boost to the pound. In the 
aftermath of the PMI release sterling jumped 0.6% against the euro, taking it 
back above 1.18 for the first time in a week and a half; this was enough to 
temper the FTSE’s growth, despite the fact that the pound is continuing to 
struggle against the dollar...

Looking ahead to this afternoon and following a bitterly disappointing end to 
2016 that saw the index fail to break 20,000 the Dow Jones is set to recover 
some of its losses this Tuesday. The Dow futures are suggesting the index will 
reclaim around 150 points, pushing it above 19900 and putting that elusive 
landmark level back on the cards.
 
The upbeat PMI report on the UK’s manufacturing industry caught City analysts 
off guard. But they have been quick to point out the divergence between the PMI 
survey and official data which paints a gloomier picture of the factory sector 
and many also highlight the threat that higher inflation in 2017 will squeeze 
consumer spending, the biggest driver of economic growth in the UK.


The outlook remains one of a marked slowdown for the UK economy this year, 
says James Knightley, senior economist at the bank ING.

He commented:


This [the PMI reading] is the strongest figure since June 2014 and again 
suggests that the Brexit referendum has not harmed the UK’s manufacturing 
sector. In fact, the 18% post referendum plunge in the value of the pound 
against other major currencies has boosted the UK’s competitiveness on the 
international stage. This is being seen in the new orders component with export 
orders performing well.

However, sterling’s fall also means that imported components are more 
expensive with both costs and output prices rising yet again. This increase in 
domestic pipeline inflation pressures is being mirrored by higher costs for 
imported consumer goods and energy. As such, the squeeze on household spending 
power is set to intensify. So while the strength of the manufacturing sector is 
good news, the likely weakness in the much larger consumer sector will more 
than offset it. Therefore we expect GDP growth to slow to a little above 1% in 
2017 from 2.2% in 2016.

 
A new network to link up Irish and British trading partners has been formed to 
offset any negative Brexit impact on trade between the UK and Ireland, reports 
Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent.

The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has launched the ‘British Irish Gateway 
to Trade’ service, which link up firms from both sides of the Irish Sea.

Britain remains Ireland’s biggest trading partner with business between the UK 
and the Republic supporting 400,000 jobs according to the British Irish Chamber 
of Commerce. Its chairman John McGrane said the network would promote more 
growth in trade between Ireland and the UK in the face of the Brexit challenge.

McGrane said: 

At a time when businesses are preparing for Brexit, they appreciate a resource 
like BIG which helps them to grow their business by being introduced to more 
customers and suppliers across the UK and Ireland”.

2017 will focus all our minds on the importance of the trade between Britain 
and Ireland which supports over 400,000 jobs. Firms on both sides of the Irish 
Sea are looking for more trading opportunities and this new service supports 
the work of Chambers and the various state agencies to make those connections 
easier to find for businesses north south east and west.

The new service lets businesses find the trading partners they want within a 
trusted network of like-minded firms across the two islands.

More reaction to the strong UK manufacturing PMI. Samuel Tombs, chief UK 
economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, doesn’t believe it will last.

UK manufacturing is benefiting from both continued brisk growth in domestic 
demand as well as improving global demand, but this momentum likely will peter 
out in 2017.

The pick-up in the total orders balance to 58.5 from 55.2 suggests 
manufacturing output will continue to grow briskly over the next couple of 
months. Meanwhile, the fact that the UK’s PMI exceeds those for the eurozone 
and U.S., 54.9 and 54.2 respectively, signals that the UK economy is continuing 
to marginally outperform.

The relationship between the PMI and the official data, however, has been 
particularly loose lately; the PMI has signalled steady growth in manufacturing 
output since August, but the official data have oscillated around a flat trend.

Meanwhile, we continue to think that domestic demand for manufactured goods 
will crumble as consumers experience a renewed squeeze on their real incomes, 
driven mainly by higher import prices. At the same time, the boost to growth 
from sterling’s depreciation will remain relatively modest, because exporters 
have raised sterling prices sharply and because uncertainty about the UK’s 
future trade relationships will deter exporters from investing.
 
Oil prices have pushed even higher, to 18-month highs, boosted by hopes that a 
deal to cut production between Opec and non-Opec producers such as Russia will 
diminish the global oil glut. Brent crude jumped about 2.5% to $58.37 a barrel, 
the highest since July 2015.
 
Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 

December’s UK Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI provides further evidence that the 
sector’s post-referendum weakness will prove short-lived... A rise in overall 
new orders to a two-and-a-half year high suggests that the strength in 
manufacturing activity will continue in the coming months. Admittedly, the fall 
in the pound is having a clear impact on price pressures. Indeed, despite 
falling back from 79.1 in November to 76.9 in December, the input prices 
balance remained well above its long-run average (55.1).

Nonetheless, on the basis of past form, the three-month average of the 
survey’s output balance is consistent with a quarterly rise in manufacturing 
output of about 1% in Q4, following Q3’s 0.8% contraction. This is consistent 
with other survey evidence, such as the CBI’s Industrial Trends Survey, which 
suggest that the manufacturing sector gained some momentum at the end of 2016 
too.

That said, given the sharp monthly fall in October in the official figures, 
even a large increase in output in November and December would probably not be 
enough to lead to a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q4. A stronger end 
to the quarter would, however, provide a good base for manufacturing growth in 
Q1. As such, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced 
in the quarters ahead.
 
Sterling jumped to a two-week high against the euro after the strong 
manufacturing survey. It hit 84.71p per euro, up 0.5%. Against the dollar, the 
pound rose to $1.2290.

The FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.8% earlier this morning, is only 0.4% ahead 
now at 7173.12, a gain of some 30 points.
