Closing summary

The FTSE100 is still pretty much flat, due to the hammering that retail stocks 
are taking on the back of Next’s disappointing update. The blue-chip index 
needs to finish above 7177.89 to set a new record.

Over on Wall Street, there’s a slim chance the Dow Jones could smash through 
the 20,000 barrier for the first time.

The oil price was 0.27% higher at $55.62 by mid afternoon and the pound is 
doing a bit better against the dollar, up around 0.4% at $1.228.

The main economic news of the day is that the UK construction industry enjoyed 
the fastest growth in new orders in almost a year in December, according to the 
latest PMI survey.

And the Bank of England said consumer credit staged its fastest monthly rise 
since March 2005 in November.

With that, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great 
comments. Shall we do it again tomorrow? Why not.

Can the Dow Jones reach 20,000 at last?

The Dow Jones has flirted shamelessly with the magic 20,000 mark 
<http://www.theguardian.com.au/story/4357478/the-dow-at-20000-time-to-buy-or-sell/>
 in recent weeks, edging tantalisingly close before falling away again, the big 
tease.

Over on Wall Street, the Dow is up 23 points in early trading at 19,905. 
Someone needs to get their wallet out if the long-awaited watermark is going to 
be breached today.

Next boss Lord Wolfson calls for Brexit clarity

A trading update and pessimistic 2017 forecast from Next 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/next-shares-2017-inflation-pound-brexit>
 has made grim reading for retail investors today, dragging shares in high 
street chains down across the board.

The firm laid the blame in part at the weakness of sterling since the EU 
referendum vote <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> in June.

Now the chain’s chief executive Simon Wolfson, one of the most prominent 
Brexiteers in the business world, has asked for greater clarity from the 
government.

He wants the government to flesh out some of the core principles that will 
underpin negotiations with the remaining EU members, particularly on 
immigration.

 It would be helpful to understand the principles and objectives of the 
government with which they are going to enter negotiations.


Here’s more detail on Lord Wolfson’s call to arms

Dollar Libor, the interest rate at which banks lend each other dollars, has 
risen above 1% for the first time since May 2009.

The rise has been fuelled by last month’s signal from the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> that it could raise 
interest rates three times in 2017, with employment and inflation both on the 
up.

Businesses are also hoping to benefit if Donald Trump, backed by a Republican 
Congress, embarks on a series of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending 
and dismantling regulation.

The Libor rate for three-month dollars hit 1.00511%, for those who were 
wondering about the figure to five decimal places.

Libor, better known for its role in the Libor scandal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/libor> that has seen bankers imprisoned 
and lenders forced to pay billions in fines, is used to calculate around $350tn 
of financial transactions worldwide.

Borrowing binge sparks debt warnings

It seems our economics editor Larry Elliott isn’t the only one sounding a 
warning about Britons embarking on a credit binge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/uk-shoppers-happy-borrowing-money-danger-ahead-credit>
.

Debt charity StepChange says Theresa May’s government should be concerned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/uk-credit-cards-borrowing-debt-economic-crash-fears?CMP=twt_gu>
 by a lending boom unparalleled since the years leading up to the 2008 
financial crisis.

Here’s what the charity’s head of policy Peter Tutton has to say.

 Lenders, regulators and the government need to ensure that the mistakes made 
in the lead-up to the financial crisis are not repeated and that there are 
better policies in place to protect those who fall into financial difficulty.

Sales for the week to 31 December were down 9.4% on last year to £138.5m at 
John Lewis and fell 12.5% to £110m at the firm’s grocery store businessWaitrose.

However, the timing of Christmas means John Lewis has undersold its true 
performance. There was one fewer trading day in the final week of 2016 than in 
2015, so the numbers are not nearly as bad as they seem.

Indeed, including all 22 weeks to the end of the year, Waitrose sales grew by 
3.3% and John Lewis was up by 4.2%.

Let’s catch up with Eurozone inflation data from earlier, which showed 
inflation in December hitting 1.1%, the highest level for three years and a 
sharp jump on the 0.6% reported in November.

Price rises are largely down to increases in the cost of energy, food, alcohol 
and tobacco, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.

The European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> (ECB) set a target 
for inflation of just below 2%, a level ECB president Mario Draghi has said 
could be reached as soon as late 2018.

The FTSE100 is still pretty much flat, due to the hammering that retail stocks 
are taking on the back of Next’s disappointing update. The blue-chip index 
needs to finish above 7177.89 to set a new record.

Over on Wall Street, there’s a slim chance the Dow Jones could smash through 
the 20,000 barrier for the first time.

The oil price was 0.27% higher at $55.62 by mid afternoon and the pound is 
doing a bit better against the dollar, up around 0.4% at $1.228.

The main economic news of the day is that the UK construction industry enjoyed 
the fastest growth in new orders in almost a year in December, according to the 
latest PMI survey.

And the Bank of England said consumer credit staged its fastest monthly rise 
since March 2005 in November.

With that, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great 
comments. Shall we do it again tomorrow? Why not.

 in recent weeks, edging tantalisingly close before falling away again, the big

Over on Wall Street, the Dow is up 23 points in early trading at 19,905.

A trading update and pessimistic 2017 forecast from Next 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/next-shares-2017-inflation-pound-brexit>
 has made grim reading for retail investors today, dragging shares in high 
street chains down across the board.

The firm laid the blame in part at the weakness of sterling since the EU 
referendum vote <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> in June.

Now the chain’s chief executive Simon Wolfson, one of the most prominent 
Brexiteers in the business world, has asked for greater clarity from the 
government.

He wants the government to flesh out some of the core principles that will 
underpin negotiations with the remaining EU members, particularly on 
immigration.

 It would be helpful to understand the principles and objectives of the 
government with which they are going to enter negotiations.


Here’s more detail on Lord Wolfson’s call to arms

Dollar Libor, the interest rate at which banks lend each other dollars, has 
risen above 1% for the first time since May 2009.

The rise has been fuelled by last month’s signal from the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> that it could raise 
interest rates three times in 2017, with employment and inflation both on the 
up.

Businesses are also hoping to benefit if Donald Trump, backed by a Republican 
Congress, embarks on a series of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending 
and dismantling regulation.

The Libor rate for three-month dollars hit 1.00511%, for those who were 
wondering about the figure to five decimal places.

Libor, better known for its role in the Libor scandal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/libor> that has seen bankers imprisoned 
and lenders forced to pay billions in fines, is used to calculate around $350tn 
of financial transactions worldwide.
