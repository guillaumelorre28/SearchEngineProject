Writtle in Essex and Goudhurst in Kent experienced lows of -6.1C, with the 
south-east widely seeing temperatures of -5C and -6C.

The south-east had clear skies overnight and, with cold air coming from the 
continent, temperatures dropped. Other parts of the country were under a 
blanket of cloud, which helped keep temperatures up.

“Two ends of the spectrum of winter weather,” said Craig Small, a forecaster. 
“It’s definitely a big contrast today across the country.”

As the day progresses, the difference in temperature is expected to become 
less pronounced, with a high of 10C or 11C forecast for Scotland, and 
temperatures in the south-east expected to climb to 4C or 5C.
