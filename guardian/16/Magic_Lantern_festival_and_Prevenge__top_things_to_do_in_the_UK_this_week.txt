Lights! Camera! Instagram filter! The UK’s answer to China’s New Year’s 
lantern festival returns, this time toChiswick House Gardens 
<http://www.chgt.org.uk/index.asp?Pageid=13>, with more than 50 glowing 
installations on a Silk Road theme (not the drugs darknet; the original one, 
the ancient trade network linking Asia to the west). Expect plenty of animals 
(including pandas) and the odd admiral’s ship.

 Knowing, daring and funny ... A Series Of Unfortunate Events. Photograph: Joe 
Lederer/Netflix 
The latest major series to land on Netflix stars Neil Patrick Harris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/neil-patrick-harris> (the most annoying 
one fromHow I Met Your Mother 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/apr/01/how-i-met-your-mother-fail-perfect-ending>
) as Count Olaf, an evil conman who tries to adopt the Baudelaire orphans to 
inherit their family fortune. It may sound childish, but it’s so much more: a 
cross betweenTim Burton <https://www.theguardian.com/film/timburton> and Wes 
Anderson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson>, it’s knowing, daring, 
and very funny.

Bright Lights
Christmas 2016 will be remembered for the sad, untimely passing of George 
Michael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/26/george-michael-lgbt-rights-i-never-had-a-problem-with-being-gay>
, but also of mother-daughter actorsDebbie Reynolds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/29/debbie-reynolds-hollywood-golden-age-singin-in-the-rain-carrie-fisher>
 andCarrie Fisher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/03/carrie-fisher-sharon-horgan-so-real-it-was-dangerous>
. This doc about their unusual yet touching relationship had already been 
slated, but the air date was brought forward from March to celebrate their 
remarkable bond. Bright Lights looks at the pair’s closeness in later life but 
touches on Fisher’s turbulent times dealing with drugs andher mental health 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/commentisfree/2016/dec/28/carrie-fisher-bipolar-dies-mental-illness-princess-leia>
, as well as her mother’s struggle to come to terms with ageing. A Hollywood 
story – bizarre but brilliantly warm.

Manchester By The Sea
Casey Affleck won a Golden Globe

 for best performance by an actor in a motion picture – drama for his role as 
loner handyman Lee Chandler inKenneth Lonergan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kenneth-lonergan>’s stark look at coming to 
terms with the awful tragedies life throws at us and finding solace in each 
other. Not the easiest watch for January, but beautiful all the same.
