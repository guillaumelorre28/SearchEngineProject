Winning tip: Helper, Utah


Helper is an old mining town 100 miles or so from Salt Lake City. It had been 
in decline for years but a steady flow of artists who can’t afford SLC prices 
are moving in. The old, run-down cinema still displays a poster of the last 
film shown in the 1960s. Its rich history of immigration and mining, plus its 
Butch Cassidy links, is reflected in the fascinating contents of its antique 
shops. The residents were pleased and perplexed to have an English couple turn 
up in town. We heard stories of the town’s past from a retired actor carrying 
his three white poodles who had moved in a decade ago from LA. He told of the 
huge increase in the town’s population when miners came down from the mountains 
at the weekends, the bars and bordellos doing great business. The town is a 
sort of living museum and anyone interested in American culture would delight 
in spending time here, chatting with real characters full of stories and 
legends. Go before this place disappears. It’s authentic and unforgettable.

On the Kitsap peninsula 35 minutes by ferry from Seattle, this picturesque 
little town highlights its Nordic heritage – the town saw a lot of immigration 
from Norway and Finland particularly – while remaining distinctly American. 
Grab a coffee and a doughnut fromSluys Bakery <http://sluyspoulsbobakery.com/>

This is the quintessential small Texan town out in the state’s far west. It 
has a remarkable art scene withseveral galleries 
<http://www.visitmarfa.com/arts.php#.WBnSrzaLRdA>. It also has the Marfa 
Lights. It might be desert gas, locals having a laugh or atmospheric conditions 
reflecting car lights, but it’s been going on for more than a century. People 
go out and have fun and wait for them to appear. The town is also relatively 
close (in Texas terms) to the beautiful 8,000ft Davis mountains.

A colonial seaport midway between New York and Boston, Essex embodies every 
Hollywood cliche about small town New England but does so in the most winning 
way. There are white clapboard federal-style houses with the Stars and Stripes 
aflutter, classy boutiques and a corker of a tavern. TheGriswold Inn 
<http://www.griswoldinn.com/>, opened in 1776, making it America’s oldest 
continuously-serving hostelry. It has a collection of firearms on the walls and 
serves up delights like lobster pot pie. If it all gets a bit cutesy, wander 
down to the Connecticut river to inspect the boatyards and yachts. George III’s 
forces attacked in 1814 and torched 28 ships there, but the cheery locals won’t 
hold it against British visitors.

For those interested in the old west, this town (700 miles east of its Nevada 
namesake) hits the spot. The city museum hosts Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Rider 
Memorial Collection, full of artefacts from the late 19th century wars in Cuba 
and beyond. It’s easy to visualise Billy the Kid and Jesse James riding into 
this town. Bed down at the 1920s Spanish colonial-style El Fidel (doubles from 
$45, +1 505 425 6761, no website) on Douglas Avenue with ceiling fans and tiled 
floors that take you to another era. Also on Douglas, drop intoCharlie’s Spic

A stay at the luxurious Rhett House Inn <http://www.rhetthouseinn.com/>

surrounding streets are lined with grand antebellum mansions shaded by mature 
oaks dripping with Spanish moss. Strictly speaking, it feels as though we

much of Forrest Gump was filmed here instead of Alabama. The town, which is on 
low-lying Port Royal island, was also the setting for The Big Chill movie. The 
town’s Old Point historic district is a delight; we took a carriage ride with

Built in 1931 to re-house workers on the nearby Hoover Dam from their tented 
slums, this small town is only a dice roll from Vegas. TheBoulder Dam Museum 
<http://www.bcmha.org/> (entry $2) focuses on the social and human cost of that 
engineering marvel (and is curated by the son of a former Ragtown inhabitant). 
It is located in the elegant, colonialBoulder Dam Hotel 
<http://www.boulderdamhotel.com/> (doubles from $80 B&B), built in 1933 to 
accommodate VIPs visiting the dam construction site. Bronze statues adorn the 
quaint streets, depicting the history of this sympathetically planned 
settlement where spacious parks were integral in providing recreational 
opportunities for its first citizens. Casino-free, it’s a genteel and friendly 
antidote to Sin City.

This fascinating town is halfway between Detroit and Chicago, making it a 
perfect stopover on a road trip. This small town with a population of around 
700 people offers a fascinating insight into an alternative strand of American 
culture: the Amish. TheMenno-Hof Amish and Mennonite Centre 
<http://www.mennohof.org/> is the best place to start your visit; guided tours 
allowing an insight into the culture of the town and its people. A subsequent 
horse carriage tour around town will let you sit back and learn more about the 
workings of the place. The bakeries are filled with fresh cinnamon-rolls and 
the flea market every Wednesday presents a fine array of Americana memorabilia.

About 90 minutes’ drive north of San Francisco, you’ll find the laid back town 
of Guerneville. Charmingly rustic, but with a wonderful food and wine scene 
thanks to it’s Sonoma county location, since the 1970s the town has become a 
welcoming resort for the LGBT community. At its heart is the Russian river, 
with canoes, kayaks, umbrellas and beach chairs available for rent. Check out 
the excellent bistroBoon Eat + Drink <http://eatatboon.com/>, featuring a menu 
using local, fresh, seasonal ingredients.
