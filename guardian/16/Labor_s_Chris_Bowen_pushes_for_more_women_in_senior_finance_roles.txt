The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/chris-bowen>, has criticised Australia’s top 
economic policy-making bodies, asking why they have failed to hire women for 
their most senior roles.

He has said some of Australia’s biggest economic challenges have a gender 
dimension – such as female participation rates, the gender pay gap and the 
retirement income gap – and the dearth of senior female appointments at top 
economic institutions must have an impact.

He has also criticised Treasury’s decision to neglect targets for senior 
female appointments that were set by the former Treasury secretary Martin 
Parkinson.

He has said Parkinson, who now heads the Department of Prime Minister and 
Cabinet, had tried to change Treasury’s “blokey” cultureby setting gender 
targets

 and “it is a pity that Treasury has withdrawn from the program since 
Parkinson’s departure”.

Parkinson was sacked in 2013 by Tony Abbott – one of his first acts as prime 
minister – and replaced with John Fraser in 2014.

, Bowen says the recent appointment of Susan Kiefel as Australia’s first chief 
justice of the high court provided a moment for stocktake.

Turnbull hails new high court chief justice Susan Kiefel an ‘inspiration’

He says Australia has now had a female prime minister and governor-general, 
and every state bar one has had a female premier.

“But Australia has never had a female treasurer,” he says. “Or female 
secretary to the Treasury. Or a female Reserve Bank governor. Or deputy 
governor. Or female chair of the ACCC. Or Apra. Or Asic. I think you get the 
gist.

“Australia has a problem in that its many highly accomplished female 
economists have not been able to break through to the leadership roles they 
deserve and our nation is accordingly missing out on the potential contribution 
they have to make as our most senior economic policy makers.”

Janet Yellen, the first female chair of the US Federal Reserve, is one of the 
most powerful female economists in the world.

Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, 
the first woman to lead the IMF, is one of the most powerful women in the world.

“And yet, here in Australia no female has headed a national economic 
institution and there is no sign of this changing any time soon,” Bowen says.

He says Australia’s top economic institutions need to improve their gender 
diversity if they want corporate Australia to improve female representation in 
boardrooms.

“Until the government of the country gets its act together in our most 
important economic institutions, corporate Australia will have a legitimate 
point that Canberra shouldn’t be holding others to standards that we fail to 
meet ourselves,” Bowen says.
