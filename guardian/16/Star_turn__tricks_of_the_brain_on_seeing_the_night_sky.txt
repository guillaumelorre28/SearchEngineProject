The nights may be getting shorter, but it’s still the perfect time of year for 
a spot of star gazing. The neurobiology of low light vision suggests this isn’t 
a pastime to be rushed – be patient. Stepping outside for a couple of minutes 
isn’t enough. The longer you look up at the sky, the better your vision 
becomes. This is because it takes a few minutes for your pupils to dilate to 
let more light in. But the chemistry of the light detectors in your retina take 
half an hour or more to adjust, boosting your sensitivity to low light. This is 
at the cost of accuracy because your night vision is less able to perform fine 
discrimination and see colour. The eye quickly resets to day mode if you even 
glance at strong light so keep the brightness of your phone screen down if 
you’re using an astronomy app otherwise it will make the faint stars you’re 
looking at invisible.

All those memories of vivid starry nights on long outdoor evenings are 
subjective. The stars only appear brighter because you’re out for longer; the 
chemistry of your retina changes allowing your eyes to become dark adapted.
