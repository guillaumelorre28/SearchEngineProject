Stand of the week


Slaven Bilic – “let down and angry” with Dimitri Payet trying to leave West Ham
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/12/dimitri-payet-head-turned-west-ham>
: “He’s our best player and that’s why we gave him a long contract. We gave him 
everything, we were always there for him. I expect him to show commitment.”

(March 1997 – Harry Redknapp reveals he’s “bitter and angry “ with Slaven 
Bilic trying to leave West Ham: “He’s on a fantastic contract, the highest paid 
player in the club’s history. He signed it … Now he wants a move and feels 
Everton are a big club, so there’s nothing we can do. West Ham are a big club 
in our eyes, but he feels otherwise.” Bilic: “I had to do this. We are 
professionals – all players know, if anyone gets the chance of a big club, he 
must take it.”)

• Payet’s view on contract loyalty: Feb 2016, signing his new five-year 
£125k-a-week West Ham deal

the manager. I thank them for that. I’m proud and I’m happy to prolong my 
adventure with West Ham…All is well.

club, for my team-mates, for this shirt,’ and now he’s showing great passion in 
the right way, in every moment. We’re happy for this: me, the club, the 
team-mates, because he’s completely focused. It’s very important, this.”

have nothing against them.”
