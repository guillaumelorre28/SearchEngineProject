Night in the Woods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/03/night-in-the-woods-playstation-4>


The title implies yet another foray into video game action-horror, but the 
miseries you encounter here are of a different class. College dropout Mae 
Borowski returns home to find an impoverished American community that, through 
industrial decline (Possum Springs is a former mining town), has lost its hope 
and identity. Societal issues are expressed via individual symptoms in mental 
illness and depression. Illustrator Scott Benson’s animation gives the game the 
texture of a luxury hipster fairytale book. It cannot disguise its dark, 
intimate, melancholic core.

Gravity Rush 2

Kat, Gravity Rush 2’s waifish, athletic protagonist, is able to flex and 
tighten gravity’s pull, an ability that allows her to blast herself from 
pavement to tree branch, from rooftop to steeple, along tumbling airborne 
lines. In battle, she can whip up a whirlwind of debris and use it to 
pleasingly slam her attackers around. But the true star of this sequel to the 
handheld original is the cloud city Hekesville, a chaotic jumble of 
architectural styles from European townhouses and Brazilian favelas to 
Edwardian mansions, now freshly, deliciously rendered on thePlayStation 4

Resident Evil 7 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-games-capcom>

Japan’s long-running horror series returns to its original claustrophobic 
rhythms of dread followed by shock followed by arcane puzzling. No 
globe-spanning journey here, just a visit to sweltering Louisiana in search of 
your missing spouse. There, you’ll meet the Baker family, a hick dynasty that 
could have stepped straight from a Truman Capote investigation. Expect 
mannequin fingers stuffed in drawers, filthy crows packed in microwaves and, if 
you’re playing the game in virtual reality, restless nights thereafter.

Yakuza 0

Sega’s grim Japanese mob-thrillers may not have the finesse of Rockstar’s 
Grand Theft Auto <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto> 
series, but they offer a vivid experience of a criminal class. This, the most 
ambitious game in the series to date, is set in the late 1980s, within a 
fictionalised recreation of Tokyo’s Kabukicho and Osaka’s Dotonbori districts, 
seedy streets where yakuza factions vie for power. Expect bloody street fights, 
clumpy dialogue and an unforgettable trip to a vanished Japan.

Halo Wars 2

Ensemble, the developer of the first Halo Wars, a real-time strategy game set 
in the pink and purple world of Microsoft’s tin-suited space marine, disbanded 
in 2009. For this unexpected sequel, control has been handed to 343 Studios, 
current custodians of theXbox <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox> 
mascot. The game plays nothing like the twitchy shooter from which it takes its 
name, instead casting you as a divine overseer, moving units around the 
battlefield like a commander leering over a map. The tension and stakes are no 
less immediate for the change in perspective.

 Nudging the paradigm? … the Nintendo Switch console. Photograph: Nintendo 
Nintendo Switch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/nintendo-switch-new-portable-console-wii-u>

Nintendo has been coy about this, its much anticipated new console. While Sony 
and Microsoft compete for technological dominance, the ancient Japanese company 
has, since the staggeringly popular Wii, pursued its own path with 
idiosyncratic designs that facilitate new kinds of play. The Switch is no 
different, a hybrid machine that can be used both in the home and on the road 
via its tablet-like screen. It’s another high-risk commercial gamble for the 
company but one that could potentially nudge the paradigm.

Horizon Zero Dawn 
<https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/>

With the globe-spanning popularity of HBO’s Westworld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld>, vast pastoral parks 
filled with robots are undeniably in vogue. Fortuitous timing for Horizon Zero 
Dawn’s Dutch developer, Guerrilla Games: its forthcoming release casts you as 
Aloy, a primeval hunter-gatherer touring a postapocalyptic land ruled by 
robotic dinosaurs. Early footage indicates a visual masterpiece. Hopefully, the 
seemingly inventive, freeform gameplay, which allows Aloy to rewire the 
monsters to work in her service, will match the technical splendour.

Clancy may be gone, but his khaki-coloured legacies live on in pixel. This, 
the first major entry in the series for years, is also the first to move to an 
open-world format, where missions are picked up on the ground rather than 
issued via separate, novelistic chapters. The setting is Bolivia, where your 
special operations unit is dispatched to undermine the increasingly powerful 
drug cartels. The development team spent months shadowing the Bolivian army, 
promising a nuanced and authentic depiction.

Nier: Automata

Developed by Platinum Games, the most successful action-game maker working in 
Japan, and directed by Atsushi Inaba, whose credits include Bayonetta, Vanquish 
and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, Nier: Automata is an unlikely sequel toone 
of the Xbox’s most curious role-playing games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/apr/26/nier-xbox-ps3-game-review>
. Again, the theme is humans v robots (a defining theme of contemporary fiction 
that surely reveals our technological anxieties), although this time the 
solution is bluntly expressed via swordplay.

Shenmue 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/16/shenmue-3-kickstarter-crowdfunding-hits-target>

There’s no release date for Shenmue 3, the third, long awaited and highly 
anticipated release in Yu Suzuki’s much loved Japanese coming-of-age saga. But 
fans have learned to remain hopeful. Whether Sony’s reportedly meagre 
investment in the game (bolstered by $6m in crowdfunding donations) will be 
enough to deliver a game that matches the current titans of the genre is 
unlikely. At least Shenmue 3 will be a fascinating case study in the wisdom of 
resurrecting ageing, beloved stories.
