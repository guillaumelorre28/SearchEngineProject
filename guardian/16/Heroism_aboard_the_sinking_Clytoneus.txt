Your feature on Lizzie Nunnery (Horror on the high seas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/16/lizzie-nunnery-interview-playwright-liverpool-everyman-narvik>
, G2, 16 January) contains accounts of hatches being closed on drowning men 
after a ship had been hit, and the allegation that “the heaviest British losses 
were self-inflicted”. This contrasts starkly with the report from my 
grandfather, Captain Sidney Goffey, whose ship the Clytoneus was attacked and 
sunk by a German aircraft in 1941. After establishing that the ship was 
“blazing furiously”, main machinery out of action and the engine room taking 
water fast, Captain Goffey ordered abandon ship and had the lifeboats launched. 
He then took a walk round the ship to ensure nobody was left on board before 
getting into his own boat. He reported that “the behaviour of my crew, 
including the Chinese, was excellent in every way throughout the ordeal”. They 
were picked up after two days and – apart from the able seaman manning their 
anti-aircraft gun, who despite being wounded by machine gun bullets from the 
aircraft maintained he had secured a hit on it – no casualties were suffered.
