Staten Island Ferry

This five-mile, 25-minute ride offers breathtaking views of the Statue of 
Liberty, Ellis Island, the Lower Manhattan skyline and New York harbour – and 
it's free. The boat has indoor and outdoor seating on multiple levels and a 
snack bar. You have to disembark at Staten Island's Saint George Terminal, but 
you can return to Manhattan immediately by reboarding the same boat.

Alphabets, East Village

Alphabets is the place to come for joke gifts and fun toys with attitude. The 
remote control whoopee cushion you didn't know existed? It does, and it's here. 
Have you been searching for a waitress action figure or cupcake-flavoured 
toothpaste? Seek no further. You'll find the cute (rubber ducky whistles that 
quack) and the ridiculous (a headband that holds a basketball net on top of 
your head).

Lightship Frying Pan, Chelsea

This is no ordinary bar but a retired lightship parked on a barge on the 
Hudson river. Tables on the top deck have arguably the most magnificent view in 
NYC, a panoramic sweep from the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington 
bridge, but there's not a bad seat in the house. Place your order at the bar 
(steamed mussels and littlenecks, crab cakes, burgers, corn on the cob), take 
it back to your table, and glory in the surroundings. Bring a copy ofFireboat, 
The Heroic Adventures of the John J Harvey 
<http://www.mairakalman.com/books/children/fireboat/>, by Maira Kalman, with 
you so your kids can read the inspiring story of the real fireboat next door – 
while looking at many of the buildings (including the Empire State) and scenes 
pictured in the book.

The High Line, Lower West Side
 Photograph: Getty Images 
Since opening in June 2009, the High Line has become one of New York's 
best-loved parks. Built on an elevated rail viaduct not used for transport 
since 1980, its design integrates old track beds with wild gardens and unique 
views of old and new New York. Kids will find an array of appealing features 
including the cement bleachers near the 16th Street entrance that, through a 
panoramic window, overlook 10th Avenue and its stream of yellow cabs. There are 
performers and artists along the route, which is about a mile long – the length 
of about 20 city blocks. "Curated" food trucks offer some of NYC's most hip and 
delicious eating opportunities.
• thehighline.org <http://www.thehighline.org/>. Open daily 7am-11pm, various 
entrance points, including 14th Street, West 16th, West 18th and West 20 
Streets and 23rd Street, free

Bryant Park, Midtown

Surrounded by skyscrapers on three sides, and the New York Public Library 
<http://www.nypl.org/> on the fourth, Bryant Park is idyllic. In summer, 
there's a pétanque court where children can learn the classic French game using 
child-sized boules, plus a carousel, a putting green, chess, backgammon and 
board games, ping-pong, bird-watching tours, jugglers, artists-in-residence, 
concerts and open-air movies. Between November and March, there's an 
ice-skating rink. Almost everything is free.

Discovery Room, American Museum of Natural History, Upper West Side
 Photograph: Alamy 
The magnificent American Museum of Natural History is a must-see but is huge 
and almost always crowded. Really crowded. The Discovery Room provides a place 
to regroup. It's like a fun-filled classroom with plenty for children aged 5–12 
to play with, examine and explore. Upstairs, older kids can handle a live 
Madagascar hissing cockroach and an albino leopard gecko (but not the Chilean 
rose hair tarantula, although staff will be happy to let you watch as they pull 
silk out of its spinneret). On Wednesday afternoons, the bearded dragon is 
given his weekly bath.
• Central Park West and 79th Street, amnh.org <http://www.amnh.org/>. Open 
daily 10am-5.45pm, admission adult $22, under-13 $12.50

Tiny Doll House, Upper East Side

A visit here will wow both girls and boys: the world reduced to a Lilliputian 
scale is mesmerising. Tiny etched glass hurricane lamps, Majolica asparagus 
dishes, Knole sofas, gilded pier mirrors and thousands of other miniature 
objects are all displayed in exquisitely designed dioramas – a library, a 
patisserie, a room decorated for Christmas, a nursery. The shop has many items 
children can afford.

Governors Island, Lower Manhattan

This 172-acre island, formerly a military base, is a five-minute ferry ride 
($2 return) from Manhattan and off the radar for most visitors. New Yorkers 
love its breathtaking views and family-friendly fun (castle, fort, treehouse, 
mini-golf, art classes, a grove of 50 red hammocks, ball fields and children's 
play areas). Rent bikes or quadcycles fromBike and Roll 
<http://www.bikeandroll.com/Newyork/>, by the Parade Ground. Eating options 
include a Caribbean food truck and ice-cream stands.

Eating out along Amsterdam Avenue, Upper West Side

After doing the Natural History museum, skip its basement cafe. Only a couple 
of blocks away are casual, delicious, and inexpensive alternatives.Island 
Burger and Shakes <http://www.islandburgersandshakes.com/> serves more than 
64 varieties of burger and grilled chicken sandwich, called churrascoses. And 
it's hard to find a better deal than the lunch specials atOaxaca Taqueria 
<http://www.oaxacatacos.com/>, where two tacos or enchiladas with rice and 
beans, half atorta or a quesadilla with a salad or soup costs $7. If you've 
never triedelote, a corn cob grilled with cotija cheese and chilli powder, this 
is the place to try it. And if your kids want it without the chilli, they can. 
You can bring your own drinks.

Lots of young neighbourhood families are fans of the vegan Peacefood Cafe 
<http://www.peacefoodcafe.com/>. Kids' favourites include brown rice with 
cashew cheese ($6) and baked soy nuggets ($7). You'll find Mediterranean panini 
($11.95), soups, smoothies, juices, and homemade desserts.
