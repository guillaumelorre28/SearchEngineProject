My Magnolia grandiflora <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia_grandiflora> 
has not flowered since it was planted 14 years ago, in clay soil near a 
well-behaved septic tank (ie, it’s not waterlogged). It is sheltered from the 
wind by a tall privet hedge 10ft away and is large and very healthy. Can I add 
something to the soil to help it flower?
Patience is required here. Bull bay magnolia takes around 12-15 years to 
flower. Yours may just be getting such a nice boost from the septic tank that 
it is concentrating all its energy on healthy, green leaves rather than flowers.

Ask Alys Fowler: why didn’t my kniphofias flower?

They do also prefer slightly acidic conditions, but I think you’d know if that 
was a problem: the leaves tend to look paler if soil conditions aren’t right. 
Cold won’t promote flowering, either; you say it is protected from the wind, 
but it may still be just a tad chilly. I assume it doesn’t get frosted?

Try feeding it with something rich in potash to promote flowering. I’d start 
in spring by applying a good general fertiliser; as with all such things, if 
the plant wants to do its own thing, you just have to run with that. I am sure 
it will flower in its own good time.
