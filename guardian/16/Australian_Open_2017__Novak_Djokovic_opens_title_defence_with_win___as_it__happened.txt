The final match of the day is over and Agnieszka Radwanska has beaten Tsvetana 
Pironkova 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 to reach the second round.That’s all from me for now. 
I’ll be back tomorrow with updates on matches involving Andy Murray, Nick 
Kyrgios, Bernard Tomic and Dan Evans. Until then. Bye.

Facing a match point, Naomi Broady goes for broke with a forehand – but it 
lands just wide, bringing her tournament to a premature end. It’s heartbreaking 
for Broady, but she can take heart from a largely solid performance, even 
though it was enough to secure her place in the second round. Daria Gavrilova 
was more consistent in the key moments, only a couple of points here and there 
making the difference, and the ecstatic Australian 22nd seed secures a gutsy 
3-6, 6-4, 7-5 win over her close friend.

Naomi Broady serves immaculately to hold for 5-all. She’s played very well. 
Will it be enough to reach the second round, however? Daria Gavrilova isn’t 
giving anything away either.

Broady will serve to stay in the match, conscious of the fact she was broken at

Tsvetana Pironkova didn’t look like the toughest of opponents for Agnieszka 
Radwanska in the first set on Rod Laver Arena. Better late than never, though. 
She takes the second set 6-4 to level the match against the third seed, who 
took the first 6-1.

It’s going into a decider on Margaret Court Arena. Naomi Broady saves one set 
point with a vicious forehand winner, but an errant backhand flies wide and 
hands a resurgent Daria Gavrilova the second set. The momentum is with the home 
favourite now. Meanwhile Agnieszka Radwanska has broken back against Tsvetana 
Pironkova in the second set.

Naomi Broady is performing commendably on Margaret Court Arena, bouncing back 
to break back when the unpredictable Daria Gavrilova sends a forehand long.
Gavrilova leads 4-3 and Broady looks the livelier player at the moment.

For all the stylishness of her game, Agnieszka Radwanska has never won a grand 
slam, the Pole often lacking the requisite power to cut it with physically 
tougher players. I suspect a lot of people would like to see her win one, 
though, because she is one of the most watchable players on the tour. She’s 
moving along smoothly enough today, taking the first set 6-1 on Rod Laver Arena 
– but as I write that, Tsvetana Pironkova breaks in the first game of the 
second set.

It’s finally all over on Court 19 and what a comeback it was from Ivo Karlovic!
 The 20th seed trailed by two sets to Horacio Zeballos, but he’s through to the 
second round after winning 6-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 22-20. It was no Isner-Mahut, of 
course, but it did last five hours and 14 minutes and Karlovic, 37 years old, 
hammered down an astonishing 75 aces to break the previous tournament record.

Her nerves are just fine. Naomi Broady stays cool to earn two set points and 
she takes the first, attacking with a diagonal backhand before charging to the 
net to overpower Gavrilova with a heavy forehand volley.

Zeballos looks likely to hold.

Djokovic through to round two

A brilliant performance from Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> and the defending champion 
is up and running after a 6-1, 7-6, 6-2 win over the erratic Fernando Verdasco. 
After all his troubles last year, how Djokovic needed a strong start to his 
favourite tournament. He’s made a big statement and on this evidence is likely 
to take some beating over the next fortnight. He’ll face either Denis Istomin 
or Ivan Dodig in the next round. Istomin is a break up in the fourth set and 
closing in on victory.

Next on Margaret Court Arena, it’s Australia’s Daria Gavrilova versus 
Britain’s Naomi Broady.The players have emerged for what could be an exciting 
match. Gavrilova, the 22nd seed, is the rightful favourite, but Broady could be 
a tricky opponent for her if she plays with belief.

Christopher O’Connell gets a huge ovation from the home fans on Margaret Court 
Arena, but the best the Australian can manage is a quick wave before 
disappearing from view.He’s got a grim expression on his face as he walks off 
because he was no match for Grigor Dimitrov, who marches into the second round 
after a serene 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 win.

Djokovic does break back again. Verdasco hands him a break point with a double 
fault and a roaring Djokovic converts thanks to an excellent backhand return 
that forces the Spaniard to hit wide. Verdasco leads 3-2, but it’s not 
difficult to see where this is heading.

The final match of the day is over and Agnieszka Radwanska has beaten Tsvetana 
Pironkova 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 to reach the second round.That’s all from me for now. 
I’ll be back tomorrow with updates on matches involving Andy Murray, Nick 
Kyrgios, Bernard Tomic and Dan Evans. Until then. Bye.

Facing a match point, Naomi Broady goes for broke with a forehand – but it 
lands just wide, bringing her tournament to a premature end. It’s heartbreaking 
for Broady, but she can take heart from a largely solid performance, even 
though it was enough to secure her place in the second round. Daria Gavrilova 
was more consistent in the key moments, only a couple of points here and there 
making the difference, and the ecstatic Australian 22nd seed secures a gutsy 
3-6, 6-4, 7-5 win over her close friend.

Tsvetana Pironkova didn’t look like the toughest of opponents for Agnieszka

took the first 6-1.

It’s going into a decider on Margaret Court Arena. Naomi Broady saves one set 
point with a vicious forehand winner, but an errant backhand flies wide and 
hands a resurgent Daria Gavrilova the second set. The momentum is with the home 
favourite now. Meanwhile Agnieszka Radwanska has broken back against Tsvetana 
Pironkova in the second set.
 
Daria Gavrilova is wheeling her arm manically, just like Kris Akabusi, after 
holding to love for a 5-4 in the second set.Naomi Broady is under pressure now, 
serving to keep the set alive.
 
Naomi Broady is performing commendably on Margaret Court Arena, bouncing back 
to break back when the unpredictable Daria Gavrilova sends a forehand long.
Gavrilova leads 4-3 and Broady looks the livelier player at the moment.
 
For all the stylishness of her game, Agnieszka Radwanska has never won a grand 
slam, the Pole often lacking the requisite power to cut it with physically 
tougher players. I suspect a lot of people would like to see her win one, 
though, because she is one of the most watchable players on the tour. She’s 
moving along smoothly enough today, taking the first set 6-1 on Rod Laver Arena 
– but as I write that, Tsvetana Pironkova breaks in the first game of the 
second set.
 
Daria Gavrilova has made an excellent start to the second set after losing her 
way in the first. After an early break, she leads 3-0. Meanwhile Agnieszka 
Radwanska is dominating Tsvetana Pironkova. The cunning Pole leads 5-1 in the 
first set.
 
It’s finally all over on Court 19 and what a comeback it was from Ivo Karlovic!
 The 20th seed trailed by two sets to Horacio Zeballos, but he’s through to the 
second round after winning 6-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 22-20. It was no Isner-Mahut, of 
course, but it did last five hours and 14 minutes and Karlovic, 37 years old, 
hammered down an astonishing 75 aces to break the previous tournament record.
 
Her nerves are just fine. Naomi Broady stays cool to earn two set points and 
she takes the first, attacking with a diagonal backhand before charging to the 
net to overpower Gavrilova with a heavy forehand volley.

Naomi Broady breaks to lead 5-3! Daria Gavrilova is looking flustered, pulling 
out a range of bizarre facial expressions after wafting a shot long on a break 
point, and Broady will serve for the first set. How are her nerves?
 
In the final match of the day on Rod Laver Arena, Agnieszka Radwanska faces 
the accomplished Bulgarian outsider, Tsvetana Pironkova.Radwanska is the third 
seed and she’s started the year well, but Pironkova has the talent to cause an 
upset.
 
They’re still going on Court 19. Ivo Karlovic leads 20-19, but Horacio 
Zeballos looks likely to hold.
 
They’ve shared a break apiece at the start of the first set on Margaret Court 
Arena. Daria Gavrilova struck first, but Naomi Broady has responded positively.
 
A brilliant performance from Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> and the defending champion 
is up and running after a 6-1, 7-6, 6-2 win over the erratic Fernando Verdasco. 
After all his troubles last year, how Djokovic needed a strong start to his 
favourite tournament. He’s made a big statement and on this evidence is likely 
to take some beating over the next fortnight. He’ll face either Denis Istomin 
or Ivan Dodig in the next round. Istomin is a break up in the fourth set and 
closing in on victory.

They’re still going on Court 19. Ivo Karlovic leads 17-16 against Horacio 
Zeballos in the fifth set. Who’ll blink first? Will anyone blink first?
 
Novak Djokovic is a game away from the second round. He leads 5-2 in the third 
set and Fernando Verdasco will serve to keep the match alive.
 
Next on Margaret Court Arena, it’s Australia’s Daria Gavrilova versus 
Britain’s Naomi Broady.The players have emerged for what could be an exciting 
match. Gavrilova, the 22nd seed, is the rightful favourite, but Broady could be 
a tricky opponent for her if she plays with belief.
 
Barbora Strycova, the 16th seed, had no problems against Elizaveta Kulichkova 
on Court 2. She wins 6-3, 6-2 against the Russian.
 
Christopher O’Connell gets a huge ovation from the home fans on Margaret Court 
Arena, but the best the Australian can manage is a quick wave before 
disappearing from view.He’s got a grim expression on his face as he walks off 
because he was no match for Grigor Dimitrov, who marches into the second round 
after a serene 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 win.

The Bulgarians on Margaret Court Arena are having a whale of a time. Their boy 
is a game away from the second round. Grigor Dimitrov leads 7-6, 6-3, 5-2

Novak Djokovic is speeding towards the second round now. A flat Fernando 
Verdasco double faults and Djokovic breaks at the start of the third set.
 
In the epic on Court 19, Ivo Karlovic leads 12-11 in the fifth set. Horacio 
Zeballos is about to serve.

Djokovic holds. We will have a tie-break.
 
Fernando Verdasco is showing immense character at times. He saves three set 
points and holds for 6-5. The worry for the Spaniard has to be that his level 
is so inconsistent, though, exhilarating highs followed by far too many lows.
 
From 0-30, Djokovic holds his nerve and holds his serve. Verdasco is annoyed.

5-4 in the second set, heaping the pressure on to Novak Djokovic’s shoulders.
After a forgettable first set, the drama is rising.
 
Ivo Karlovic is breaking serving records again. He leads 7-6 now. That serve 
will probably keep him going for ever.

Djokovic does break back again. Verdasco hands him a break point with a double 
fault and a roaring Djokovic converts thanks to an excellent backhand return 
that forces the Spaniard to hit wide. Verdasco leads 3-2, but it’s not 
difficult to see where this is heading.
