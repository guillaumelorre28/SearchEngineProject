The British Formula One <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> great 
Stirling Moss is recovering in hospital in Singapore after the 87-year-old was 
admitted in December with a serious chest infection, his website said on 
Saturday.

Widely regarded as the greatest grand prix driver never to win the world 
championship, Moss was a team-mate at Mercedes of the great Argentinian 
five-times world champion Juan Manuel Fangio.

He finished runner-up four years in a row from 1955 and remains the most 
successful driver not to take the title, with 16 race victories. He was also 
the first British driver to win his home grand prix, in 1955.

The website said Moss had been admitted to hospital on 22 December. “Because 
of the severity of the infection it resulted in some complications and his 
recovery has not been as speedy as was expected or wished,” it said. “However, 
his condition continues to improve and his doctors now consider him to be 
stable.

“In himself, Sir Stirling is in good spirits and only upset about having 
missed his Christmas cruise with friends.”

Moss announced his retirement from motor racing only in 2011, at the age of 
81. He had been due to race his own restored 1961 Porsche RS61 in a Legends 
race at Le Mans that June.

He ended his professional career after a bad accident at Goodwood in 1962 but 
had continued racing historic cars for his own pleasure.

In March 2010, he survived a three-storey plunge down a lift shaft at his

, breaking both ankles and four bones in his feet. He was back behind the wheel 
again by July.
