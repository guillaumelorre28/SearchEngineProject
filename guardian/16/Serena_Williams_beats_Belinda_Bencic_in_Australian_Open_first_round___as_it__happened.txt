Serena Williams safely through to Australian Open second round

It was a somewhat laboured performance by Serena Williams, but in many ways 
this was expected. TheAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is always a tough one for 
players as the heat coupled with the beginning of Open season never makes for 
an easy competition. Bencic looked strong in stages but she was let down by her 
second serve and her inability to make Williams move a little more. Having said 
all that, we’re talking about one of the greatest (if not the greatest) player 
in the history of the game so no matter what, Bencic knew she had to be on her 
A game.

Unfortunately for her, she wasn’t, and Williams took control. Thanks for 
tuning in and until next time.

Williams wins set and match (2-0)

Second Set: Williams 6-4, 6-3 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

A huge game here and of course...Williams starts with an ace. 15-0. But then, 
she commits a double fault and we go to 15-15. A ridiculous backhand winner by 
Bencic is too much for Williams and it’s 15-30. She takes the next point with a 
first hand winner but Bencic challenges. She succeeds. Williams wins the next 
point, however, as Bencic goes too long with her forehand and Williams screams 
with joy. She wants this one right now. 30-30. A powerful, intense backhand 
wins it for Williams and we’re at match point. But the anxiety takes over and 
she double faults, her second in this game! 40-40. Williams is really going for 
it now as she forces Bencic to run across the court for an error. Another match 
point. a great volley is too much for the Swiss and Williams wins the match.

Second Set: Williams 6-4, 5-2 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

Williams takes the lead with a strong first serve, forcing Bencic to make an 
unforced error. 15-0. An error by Williams and her own forehand makes it 15-15 
and thanks to a little luck, Bencic’s weak forehand just goes over the net and 
drops. A ridiculous backhand is being challenged by Bencic but she loses and 
we’re at 30-30. A double fault by Williams (her second) hands Bencic a break 
point and she takes it. The Swiss will not go out easily!

Second Set: Williams* 6-4, 5-1 Bencic (*denotes next server)

The heat, as always, plays a factor in Melbourne and you can’t help but think 
Williams wants to win this one as quickly as possible in order to stay 
energized throughout the tournament. Now that she has improved, it’s all about 
finishing the job. She already has 13 winners and just four unforced errors in 
the second set. Bencic takes a 30-0 lead but a beautiful forehand return on a 
first serve makes it 30-15. Williams makes Bencic go to the net and the Swiss 
can’t quite reach it well enough to go over and we’re at 30-30. Williams makes 
a backhand unforced error and Bencic goes 40-30. Williams, though, with an 
unbelievable return on Bencic’s first serve and we’re at deuce. A fantastic 
rally ends with a long forehand by Williams...perhaps too long. Advantage, 
Bencic. She wins the game with another error by Williams.

Bencic needs to make something happen with this game and starts well with a 
strong first serve winner. Williams, however, comes back with some strong 
returns from deep and we’re 15-30. Bencic is struggling with her second serve 
but just about manages to get this one over, forcing Williams to commit a 
forehand unforced error and we’re at 30-30. She takes the next point with a 
beautiful forehand winner in stride. She can’t quite find her first serve and 
as a result, Williams takes it. The American makes an unforced error of her own 
and we’re back at deuce but wins the next hand with a great forehand winner, 
her 22nd winner of the match so far. She takes the game and it’s now more like 
when not if for Williams to win it.

Second Set: Williams 6-4, 3-0 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

You can now see Williams getting more and more comfortable as she comes to the 
net, feeling confident, and winning a nicely placed volley. Just like that it’s 
40-0 and after a strong first hand, which is too much for Bencic, the game goes 
to Williams...who is looking very, very comfortable.

Second Set: Williams* 6-4, 2-0 Bencic (*denotes next server)


Bencic wins the first point with a strong first hand winner and once again she 
finds comfort in knowing that Williams is making a few mistakes on the return. 
30-0. After a long rally, Williams wins the point with a powerful forehand 
winner and a double fault by Bencic makes it 30-30. It obviously made her 
nervous because Williams capitalizes on the next second serve and we’re at 
break point. Bencic has another trick up her sleeve, however, as she wins the 
next point with a two-handed backhand. Williams takes the ad with an unforced 
error by Bencic and another double fault means it’s 2-0 to Williams.

Second Set: Williams 1-0 Bencic* (*denotes next server)


Williams takes the few points easily as she is really finding her stride now. 
But Bencic remains calm and knows right now that the best thing to do is to 
make Williams move but Williams is not budging. She wins the opening game of 
the second set with an ace.

First set: Williams 5-4 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

What a beautiful slice winner by Williams as she places it perfectly cross 
court. A couple of backhand errors by Bencic make it 40-0 and Williams seems to 
be improving on her serve as her powerful first makes it too hard for Bencic to 
reach and the six-timeAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> champion wins the game.

First set: Williams* 4-4 Bencic (*denotes next server)

The game begins with the best rally of the match so far, won by Williams as 
Bencic can’t quite get her drop shot over the net. We go to 15-15 after an 
unforced error by Williams and an ace by Bencic makes it 30-15. Not bad for a 
player who doesn’t really rely on her serve. Williams seems to be struggling 
with her forehand and makes another mistake. 40-15. She takes it after Bencic’s

First set: Williams 4-3 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

Williams is slowly improving with the serve and starts with an ace of her own 
and a powerful forehand winner but then Bencic comes back with fantastic 
backhand from deep. Williams wins the next point and it’s 40-15 and after 
another first serve winner, Williams takes it.

First set: Williams* 3-3 Bencic (*denotes next server)

The serve is most definitely struggling from both sides of the court right now 
as we have only seen one ace in the game (Williams.) As Williams runs to the 
net after a Bencic drop shot, she completely misjudges it and it goes out. 
Bencic takes 30-0 lead after a strong first serve winner and aces the next 
shot. Williams challenges but she fails and we’re at 40-0. Williams comes back 
by forcing Bencic with an unforced error from a powerful forehand and wins the 
next point by coming to the line with a great cross court winner. Bencic wins 
the game, however, as Williams makes a mistake an unforced error.

After a strong serve and an unforced error we go to 15-15. Williams is 
struggling with with her first serve, which is causing Bencic to take advantage 
and force the American use her backhand, which is not great right now. Bencic

First set: Williams* 3-1 Bencic (*denotes next server)

Williams starts strong with a powerful forehand and as Bencic makes an 
unforced error it quickly goes 0-30. The Swiss forces Williams to make a couple 
of mistakes on the serve return and comes back 30-30. Bencic, however, can’t 
capitalize and makes an unforced error of her own as she tries to return a 
powerful Williams forehand. She saves break point and we’re at deuce but a 
fantastic backhand winner from deep gives her the advantage. Once again, 
Williams makes a mistake with her backhand and we’re back at 40-40 but Williams 
once again takes advantage of Bencic’s weak second serve and gets another break 
point. Williams takes it as Bencic hits a long forehand that goes out. Williams 
is rusty but you can tell she’s improving on every game.

Hello everyone and welcome to the 2017 Australian Open as Serena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> begins her inevitable quest 
to pass Steffi Graf as the all-time Grand Slam leader and win her 23rd title. 
It won’t be easy as her first round encounter is against 19-year old Belinda 
Bencic, someone Serena knows very well.

The Swiss teenager defeated Williams in the semi-finals of the Rogers Cup in 
2015 and ended up winning the entire tournament. At eighteen and 23 weeks, she 
became the youngest female player to win the title but what was even more 
impressive is that she defeated six Grand Slam finalists in succession to do 
so. 2016, however, was a tough year for Bencic as a series of injuries halted 
any kind of momentum in major tournaments.


Now that she is healthy, Bencic is more than excited and ready for her third 
match against the World No 2. “My first reaction was actually, like, really 
happy,” Bencic said when she found out about the draw against the American. “So 
I think I’m super pumped. I think we’re going to play on the big court. It’s a 
big match, playing against Serena Williams. It’s what everyone’s working for.”


Serena knows too well she can’t take this one lightly and is really hoping for 
a strong start in Melbourne. Last year she reached the final without dropping a 
single set but eventually lost to Angelique Kerber in three. Without getting 
too dramatic, Williams knows she could face an upset as Bencic is more than

Luis will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Bryan Graham on Serena’s 
return to Melbourne:

Ten years ago this week, Serena Williams arrived at Melbourne Park a faded 
champion on the brink of irrelevance, a silhouette of the player who had won 
seven grand slams from 1999 to 2005. The 25-year-old from Compton had played 
only 15 events in 26 months, dogged by injuries and distractions and a 
depression brought on in no small part bythe murder of her half-sister 
<http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/07/local/me-sentence7>, Yetunde Price, 
only a mile from the public courts where a young Serena first picked up a 
racket. She had gone more than two years since playing in a final as her 
ranking sank to No136 in the world. The abyss was staring back.

Behold the withering assessment of former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash that ran 
in the Times of London on the eve of the tournament, since taken down from the 
newspaper’s website butthankfully preserved in a cached version 
<https://web.archive.org/web/20080821180813/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article1292868.ece>
 as a monument to the folly of man. The 742-word obituary wrote off Williams as 
a player with “a limited attention span”, lacking the “fortitude” and 
“application” to return to the top. The sport had moved on in her absence, he 
assured, with proof positive in the emergence of Maria Sharapova, Amelie 
Mauresmo, Jelena Jankovic, Nicole Vaidisova and Ana Ivanovic. “They are the new 
winning breed,” it reads. “They are tall and hit the ball just as hard as the 
Williams sisters, if not harder.”

It was a somewhat laboured performance by Serena Williams, but in many ways 
this was expected. TheAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is always a tough one for 
players as the heat coupled with the beginning of Open season never makes for 
an easy competition. Bencic looked strong in stages but she was let down by her 
second serve and her inability to make Williams move a little more. Having said 
all that, we’re talking about one of the greatest (if not the greatest) player 
in the history of the game so no matter what, Bencic knew she had to be on her 
A game.

Unfortunately for her, she wasn’t, and Williams took control. Thanks for 
tuning in and until next time.
 
Williams wins set and match (2-0)

Second Set: Williams 6-4, 6-3 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

A huge game here and of course...Williams starts with an ace. 15-0. But then, 
she commits a double fault and we go to 15-15. A ridiculous backhand winner by 
Bencic is too much for Williams and it’s 15-30. She takes the next point with a 
first hand winner but Bencic challenges. She succeeds. Williams wins the next 
point, however, as Bencic goes too long with her forehand and Williams screams 
with joy. She wants this one right now. 30-30. A powerful, intense backhand 
wins it for Williams and we’re at match point. But the anxiety takes over and 
she double faults, her second in this game! 40-40. Williams is really going for 
it now as she forces Bencic to run across the court for an error. Another match 
point. a great volley is too much for the Swiss and Williams wins the match.
 
Second Set: Williams* 6-4, 5-3 Bencic (*denotes next server)

Bencic to serve and wins the point thanks to an unforced error from Williams. 
The same thing happens again and we’re 30-0. Another forehand error by Williams 
and just like that we’re at 40-0. Bencic takes it with an ace and wow...we’re 
at 5-3.
 
Second Set: Williams 6-4, 5-2 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

Williams takes the lead with a strong first serve, forcing Bencic to make an 
unforced error. 15-0. An error by Williams and her own forehand makes it 15-15 
and thanks to a little luck, Bencic’s weak forehand just goes over the net and 
drops. A ridiculous backhand is being challenged by Bencic but she loses and 
we’re at 30-30. A double fault by Williams (her second) hands Bencic a break 
point and she takes it. The Swiss will not go out easily!



 
Second Set: Williams* 6-4, 5-1 Bencic (*denotes next server)

The heat, as always, plays a factor in Melbourne and you can’t help but think 
Williams wants to win this one as quickly as possible in order to stay 
energized throughout the tournament. Now that she has improved, it’s all about 
finishing the job. She already has 13 winners and just four unforced errors in 
the second set. Bencic takes a 30-0 lead but a beautiful forehand return on a 
first serve makes it 30-15. Williams makes Bencic go to the net and the Swiss 
can’t quite reach it well enough to go over and we’re at 30-30. Williams makes 
a backhand unforced error and Bencic goes 40-30. Williams, though, with an 
unbelievable return on Bencic’s first serve and we’re at deuce. A fantastic 
rally ends with a long forehand by Williams...perhaps too long. Advantage, 
Bencic. She wins the game with another error by Williams.

 
Second Set: Williams 6-4, 5-0 Bencic* (*denotes next server)


Williams destroys Bencic with her serve and just like that it’s 5-0. Bencic 
just can’t keep up with the power and precision of a revitalized Williams.
 
Second Set: Williams* 6-4, 4-0 Bencic (*denotes next server)

Bencic needs to make something happen with this game and starts well with a 
strong first serve winner. Williams, however, comes back with some strong 
returns from deep and we’re 15-30. Bencic is struggling with her second serve 
but just about manages to get this one over, forcing Williams to commit a 
forehand unforced error and we’re at 30-30. She takes the next point with a 
beautiful forehand winner in stride. She can’t quite find her first serve and 
as a result, Williams takes it. The American makes an unforced error of her own 
and we’re back at deuce but wins the next hand with a great forehand winner, 
her 22nd winner of the match so far. She takes the game and it’s now more like 
when not if for Williams to win it.

 
Second Set: Williams 6-4, 3-0 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

You can now see Williams getting more and more comfortable as she comes to the 
net, feeling confident, and winning a nicely placed volley. Just like that it’s 
40-0 and after a strong first hand, which is too much for Bencic, the game goes 
to Williams...who is looking very, very comfortable.

 
Second Set: Williams* 6-4, 2-0 Bencic (*denotes next server)


Bencic wins the first point with a strong first hand winner and once again she 
finds comfort in knowing that Williams is making a few mistakes on the return. 
30-0. After a long rally, Williams wins the point with a powerful forehand 
winner and a double fault by Bencic makes it 30-30. It obviously made her 
nervous because Williams capitalizes on the next second serve and we’re at 
break point. Bencic has another trick up her sleeve, however, as she wins the 
next point with a two-handed backhand. Williams takes the ad with an unforced 
error by Bencic and another double fault means it’s 2-0 to Williams.
 
Second Set: Williams 1-0 Bencic* (*denotes next server)


Williams takes the few points easily as she is really finding her stride now. 
But Bencic remains calm and knows right now that the best thing to do is to 
make Williams move but Williams is not budging. She wins the opening game of 
the second set with an ace.
 
First set: Williams* 6-4 Bencic (*denotes next server)

Williams takes the first point as she finds a great forehand winner on the 
return, unreachable for Bencic. Bencic takes the next point as Williams commits 
a backhand unforced error. Bencic makes two huge mistakes as she mishits her 
forehand and Williams has two set points. She takes the set with a beautiful 
forehand as she returns the serve.
 
First set: Williams 5-4 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

What a beautiful slice winner by Williams as she places it perfectly cross 
court. A couple of backhand errors by Bencic make it 40-0 and Williams seems to 
be improving on her serve as her powerful first makes it too hard for Bencic to 
reach and the six-timeAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> champion wins the game.
 
First set: Williams* 4-4 Bencic (*denotes next server)

The game begins with the best rally of the match so far, won by Williams as 
Bencic can’t quite get her drop shot over the net. We go to 15-15 after an 
unforced error by Williams and an ace by Bencic makes it 30-15. Not bad for a 
player who doesn’t really rely on her serve. Williams seems to be struggling 
with her forehand and makes another mistake. 40-15. She takes it after Bencic’s 
serve forces Williams to make another error on the return.
 
First set: Williams 4-3 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

Williams is slowly improving with the serve and starts with an ace of her own 
and a powerful forehand winner but then Bencic comes back with fantastic 
backhand from deep. Williams wins the next point and it’s 40-15 and after 
another first serve winner, Williams takes it.
 
First set: Williams* 3-3 Bencic (*denotes next server)

The serve is most definitely struggling from both sides of the court right now 
as we have only seen one ace in the game (Williams.) As Williams runs to the 
net after a Bencic drop shot, she completely misjudges it and it goes out. 
Bencic takes 30-0 lead after a strong first serve winner and aces the next 
shot. Williams challenges but she fails and we’re at 40-0. Williams comes back 
by forcing Bencic with an unforced error from a powerful forehand and wins the 
next point by coming to the line with a great cross court winner. Bencic wins 
the game, however, as Williams makes a mistake an unforced error.
 
First set: Williams 3-2 Bencic* (*denotes next server)

After a strong serve and an unforced error we go to 15-15. Williams is 
struggling with with her first serve, which is causing Bencic to take advantage 
and force the American use her backhand, which is not great right now. Bencic 
wins the game with a fantastic forehand winner.
 
First set: Williams* 3-1 Bencic (*denotes next server)

Williams starts strong with a powerful forehand and as Bencic makes an 
unforced error it quickly goes 0-30. The Swiss forces Williams to make a couple 
of mistakes on the serve return and comes back 30-30. Bencic, however, can’t 
capitalize and makes an unforced error of her own as she tries to return a 
powerful Williams forehand. She saves break point and we’re at deuce but a 
fantastic backhand winner from deep gives her the advantage. Once again, 
Williams makes a mistake with her backhand and we’re back at 40-40 but Williams 
once again takes advantage of Bencic’s weak second serve and gets another break 
point. Williams takes it as Bencic hits a long forehand that goes out. Williams 
is rusty but you can tell she’s improving on every game.
 
Update: Apologies for the delay. I am currently live-blogging through ESPN 
(US) and the match does not stream until 9pm ET.
The current score right now is 2-1 to Serena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> in the first set. Bencic 
will serve the 4th game. More detailed information coming up.
 
Hello everyone and welcome to the 2017 Australian Open as Serena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> begins her inevitable quest 
to pass Steffi Graf as the all-time Grand Slam leader and win her 23rd title. 
It won’t be easy as her first round encounter is against 19-year old Belinda 
Bencic, someone Serena knows very well.

The Swiss teenager defeated Williams in the semi-finals of the Rogers Cup in 
2015 and ended up winning the entire tournament. At eighteen and 23 weeks, she 
became the youngest female player to win the title but what was even more 
impressive is that she defeated six Grand Slam finalists in succession to do 
so. 2016, however, was a tough year for Bencic as a series of injuries halted 
any kind of momentum in major tournaments.


Now that she is healthy, Bencic is more than excited and ready for her third 
match against the World No 2. “My first reaction was actually, like, really 
happy,” Bencic said when she found out about the draw against the American. “So 
I think I’m super pumped. I think we’re going to play on the big court. It’s a 
big match, playing against Serena Williams. It’s what everyone’s working for.”


Serena knows too well she can’t take this one lightly and is really hoping for 
a strong start in Melbourne. Last year she reached the final without dropping a 
single set but eventually lost to Angelique Kerber in three. Without getting 
too dramatic, Williams knows she could face an upset as Bencic is more than 
capable of replicating another victory, so tonight I’m expecting nothing less 
than a fully focused Serena ready to make a strong statement.


I’ll be back shortly as the players warm up.


This should be a good one.
