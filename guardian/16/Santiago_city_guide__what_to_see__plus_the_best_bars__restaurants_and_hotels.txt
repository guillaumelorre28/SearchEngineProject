Santiago has always stood in the shadows of its South American neighbours. It 
doesn’t have the beaches of Rio or the faded opulence of Buenos Aires, but this 
modern city of seven million people on the edge of the Andes is beginning to 
win over global travellers. Airlines are jumping onboard, too: British Airways 
started the first non-stop flights from the UK last week, with the 
14-hour-40-minute journey making it BA’s longest route.

Now, you may never have been to a Chilean restaurant, or even know what 
Chilean cuisine is, but the food scene is exploding in Santiago. The 
influential US magazine Saveur has named it the world’sNext Great Food City 
<http://www.saveur.com/best-restaurants-santiago-chile>, and chefs have been 
toying with indigenous cooking methods and produce found between Patagonia, the 
Atacama desert and the sea to redefine the nation’s cuisine.

Meanwhile, there are now several wine bars in the Chilean capital – five years 
ago there were none – giving an important industry here a platform to shine. As 
the capital of one of South America’s most prosperous and stable nations, 
Santiago is in the midst of major changes, welcoming immigrants from across the 
Americas and erecting skyscrapers that have reshaped its skyline. Scratch 
beneath the surface, however, and you’ll find neighbourhoods such as Barrio 
Yungay and Barrio Italia where historic quarters have been reinvigorated.

Ride the funicular

On a smog-free day, the city’s dramatic setting between the rolling coastal 
range and the Andes is astounding. To best appreciate it, go to the funicular 
station at the end of Pio Nono street, in the bohemian Bellavista 
neighbourhood, ride the rickety railway to the top ofCerro San Cristóbal, sit 
in the shadow of the Virgin Mary statue and look across the metropolis. Sold 
from carts throughout the hilltop park is refreshingmote con huesillo, a drink 
of husked wheat and peach juice.
• Adult ride £2, funicularsantiago.cl <http://funicularsantiago.cl/>

Stroll through Barrio Lastarria

José Victorino Lastarria street (named after a 19th-century writer, diplomat 
and politician) is just four blocks long, but this trendy and densely packed 
corridor is overflowing with shops, restaurants, museums and cultural centres. 
Start at theGabriela Mistral Centre <http://www.gam.cl/>, and check out the 
free-admission art galleries on the basement level. Then stroll past the 
restaurant-filled PaseoBarrio Lastarria <http://barriolastarria.com/> and 
historic Parroquia de la Vera Cruz church towards the street-side craft vendors 
near the intersection with Merced. Catch an indie film atCine Arte El Biógrafo 
<http://www.elbiografo.cl/wordpress/> or see the latest exhibitions at the 
Museum of Visual Arts <http://mavi.cl/informacion-general/> (£1.20).

In the heart of historic Santiago, at the edge of Plaza de Armas, is the newly 
restoredMuseum of Pre-Columbian Art <http://www.precolombino.cl/en/> (£5). It 
is filled with indigenous artefacts and, unlike most places here, has 
English-language displays. The basement of this 200-year-old building is 
dedicated to Chile and includes Mapuche totems, Inca pottery and the Chinchorro 
mummies, which are 2,000 years older than the mummies of Egypt. Race forward a 
few millennia at theMuseum of Memory and Human Rights 
<http://ww3.museodelamemoria.cl/> (free). This striking, copper-covered 
building at the edge of Quinta Normal park houses a sobering exhibit that 
grapples with the human rights violations and “disappearances” that occurred 
under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet between 1973 and 1990.

Bypass the made-in-China souvenirs at the more centrally located Santa Lucia 
Craft market and go toLos Dominicos Handicraft Village. This adobe complex – 
part of a former monastery – houses the workshops and stores of artisans, and 
is a great place to purchase ceramic tableware, naturally dyed textiles, and 
jewellery made with lapis lazuli, a deep blue semi-precious stone found in the 
Chilean Andes. Grab an empanada at one of the rustic cafes or check out the 
latest exhibit at the village art gallery.

Chile has 2,650 miles of Pacific coastline and there’s no place better to 
appreciate the bounty that comes from these cool waters than Mercado Central. 
The counters of this wrought-iron seafood market are stacked high with 
everything from bug-eyed salmon to razor clams, sea urchins and octopus. At 
lunchtime, chefs at the food stalls serve fresh ceviche or fish stews such as
caldillo de congrio.

Emerging neighbourhoods

Barrio Italia has rapidly transformed into the city’s most electric district, 
buzzing with restaurants, art galleries and boutique stores plotted out like 
miniature shopping arcades within the rooms of historic homes. Exceedingly 
trendy, it still retains much of its blue-collar charm.Barrio Yungay has long 
been a favourite with backpackers with its lively dive bars and 
graffiti-covered homes. But now that it’s welcomed a new beer hall (Cerveceria 
Nacional <http://cervecerianacional.cl/>), wine bar (Palacio Del Vino 
<https://www.facebook.com/palaciodelvino/>) and cultural centre (Nave 
<http://nave.io/en/>), this historic area has never been such a joy to visit.

Gorge on the flavours of the Chilean countryside without leaving Santiago with 
a visit to Silabario, a year-old restaurant within the rooms (and interior 
patio) of an old Santiago home. The menu has many unsung dishes from Chile’s 
indigenous Mapuche population, such asmilcao (a pancake made of potatoes from 
the Chiloé archipelago) andcharquicán (a potato, pumpkin and beef stew). All 
meals conclude with complimentary homemade digestifs, including one infused 
with the antioxidant-packed murta berry.

Restaurante 040

This restaurant is the happy mix of European techniques and local ingredients, 
as imagined by chef Sergio Barroso, who moved to Chile from Spain five years 
ago after a stint at the renowned El Bulli restaurant. Most of the small plates 
on Barroso’s 10-course tasting menu showcase endemic seafood, includingpicoroco 
(giant barnacles) andlocos (large sea snails). Meals end with a trip in a lift 
to Room 09, a rooftop speakeasy where head bartender Diego Harris Olivera 
shakes up some of the best cocktails in town (try the che-leno, an invigorating 
mix of pisco, lemon, mint and yerba mate).

bitters and egg whites tossed together in a cocktail shaker). Belly up to the 
long bar to watch the action or get a table on the patio to pair your sours 
with ceviches. Chipe Libre also offers flights of pisco to help newbies 
determine whether they prefer Chilean or Peruvian varieties.

The view of central Santiago is the main reason to reserve a table at this 
rooftop bar in Bellavista, the city’s tourist core. The second reason? It’s 
great for trendy cocktails such as an aperol spritz. Foreigners get a free 
welcome drink on Saturdays for Azotea Matilde’s “expat sunsets”.

Cafetin

Coffee nerds geek out over the ways baristas can prepare their morning fix at 
this art-filled cafe in the Las Condes business district. Its silky cold brews 
come in mason jars stuffed with freshly cut orange slices and are among the 
crowd-pleasers on a hot summer’s day.

Barrio Italia’s first boutique hotel is as charming as it purports to be, with 
a terrace that leads into a lovingly restored 1940s home. There are harlequin 
tiles on the floors, exposed brickwork and six artfully designed rooms bearing 
nameplates that welcome each arriving guest. Owners Catalina and Eduardo are 
avid travellers themselves, and go out of their way to make visitors feel at 
home.

Following two years of meticulous renovations to re-fashion a 1920s heritage 
building as a boutique hotel, this 42-room property opened in October 2016 to 
rave reviews. It ingeniously intertwines old and new as chequered tiles, marble 
staircases and reconstructed stained-glass windows appear alongside ultramodern 
light fixtures, geometric furnishings and vertigo-inducing glass floors.

Cumbres Lastarria

With an unbeatable location (and an unmissable facade), this newly opened 
hotel in the heart of Lastarria puts guests within stumbling distance to some 
of the city’s best restaurants, bars and cultural attractions. Each of the 70 
rooms has its own artistic touch, and there’s even a small rooftop pool.

This homely B&B offers great value. The 10 rooms are basic but many look out 
over a plant-filled interior patio that’s packed with inviting hammocks.
