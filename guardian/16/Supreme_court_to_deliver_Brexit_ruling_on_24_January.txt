The supreme court is to give its judgment in the legal battle over Brexit on 
24 January.


The highest court in the land will decide whether to reject or allow a 
government appeal against a high court ruling that blocked the royal 
prerogative being used to trigger Britain’s exit from theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> without parliament having a say. 


The ruling was won by campaigners led by investment manager Gina Miller and 
Deir Dos Santos, a hairdresser.


In a case of major constitutional importance, three high court judges 
unanimously decided last November that the prime minister, Theresa May, did not 
have authority to use crown “prerogative powers” to invoke article 50 of the 
Lisbon Treaty to start the two-year process of negotiating the UK’s departure 
from the EU.


The government is asking a record 11 supreme court justices to overturn the 
decision and rule the use of prerogative powers did not interfere with the 
sovereignty of parliament.


The decision will be handed down at 9.30am.
