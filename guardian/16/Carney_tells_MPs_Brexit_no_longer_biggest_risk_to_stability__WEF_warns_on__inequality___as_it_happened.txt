And finally, the chair of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie has 
commented on the session with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He said:

The Governor has given strong advice today, both to the UK Government and to 
the governments of the rest of the EU. He’s told the Government that it is 
“highly advisable” to seek agreement to transitional arrangements, and at the 
start of the negotiations.

And he’s also told the UK’s negotiating counterparts in the EU that they, more 
than the UK, are vulnerable to financial stability risks during the period of 
transition. I hope they are all listening.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

FTSE 100 hits three records

While Carney was speaking, the FTSE 100 ran up three new records, as 
continuing weakness in the pound - it hit a near 32 year low against the dollar 
excluding last year’s flash crash- continued to drive overseas earners higher.

The index smashed through the 7300 level although it later slipped back as the 
pound came off its worst levels, ending up 15.02 at 7290.49.

That marked a new peak, the tenth day of record closes and the 12th day of 
rises. All three never seen before. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves 
Lansdown, said:

The Footsie has now seen a dozen days of price increases, in what amounts to 
its longest winning streak ever. It won’t go on forever, but the winter rally 
has shown it has considerable legs.

It’s not just the miners and international companies benefiting from lower 
sterling which are sustaining the rally, some domestically-focussed stocks are 
also chipping in, which suggests some optimism towards the prospects for UK 
companies is driving the market upward too.

Mark Carney at the Treasury select committee

In a two and a half hour session, Bank of England chair Mark Carney and 
members of its financial policy committee were quizzed on Brexit, forecasting 
and stress tests.

Carney said Brexit was no longer the most significant domestic risk to 
financial stablity. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587640e2e4b0710de27b870d#block-587640e2e4b0710de27b870d>
 But he maintained thatthe Bank’s actions had mitigated the risks around the 
referendum vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58763e63e4b0f10ba20b7069#block-58763e63e4b0f10ba20b7069>

On the Brexit discussions, Carney said the consequences of not having a 
transitional deal would be higher for the EU than for the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587641cae4b0710de27b8711#block-587641cae4b0710de27b8711>
.

On the subject of the Bank getting its forecasts wrong ahead of the vote, FPC 
member Martin Taylor said thatjust because there had not been a problem yet, 
that meant there would not be problems. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587646dfe4b0f10ba20b7080#block-587646dfe4b0f10ba20b7080>

Carney says forecasting has improved because they look at what could go wrong 
rather than thinking everything was going right. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587648e2e4b0710de27b872d#block-587648e2e4b0710de27b872d>
 He repeats thatthe Bank’s actions and preparations helped mitigate some of the 
risks following the vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5876499ee4b0c0afac91fad9#block-5876499ee4b0c0afac91fad9>

Martin Taylor said he was surprised at the strength of the economy since the 
Brexit vote, but it was becauseforecasters overestimated the negative effect of 
the referendum on consumer confidence. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58764af4e4b0710de27b8737#block-58764af4e4b0710de27b8737>

Speaking of forecasts, Carney suggested the Bank was likely to lift its UK 
growth forecasts in February. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58764a62e4b0710de27b8731#block-58764a62e4b0710de27b8731>

Anil Kashyap of the FPC reckons the risk to financial stability has not yet 
increased because of the election of Donald Trump, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58764df7e4b0c0afac91fae9#block-58764df7e4b0c0afac91fae9>
 but the Bank admitted it was monitoring the president elect’s Twitter account 
given his potential for market moving comments.

The Bank members also spent some time defending the latest bank stress tests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5876534de4b0710de27b8760#block-5876534de4b0710de27b8760>
, notably to suggestions they were not rigorous enough.

And there were also concerns about the high levels of consumer credit.

Alex Brazier: That rise in level in house prices relative to income has not, 
as it did in 2008, meant a rise in household debt. It’s not house prices per 
se, it’s the level of household debt, and [that] shows a completely different 
picture.

Question on the 10.8% growth in consumer credit last year. Is the Bank too 
relaxed or complacent about this?

FPC executive director Alex Brazier says he’s not relaxed: Consumer credit 
growth is difficult to ignore. What are the risks to financial stability? We 
have been discussing the loosening of credit conditions, such as a doubling of 
interest rate free periods for credit cards. We need to be alert and vigilant.

It has been a driver of consumer spending, so it’s important how we should 
address it, as it has a broader economic resilience.

Carney and his committee defend the results of the tests, but says he welcomes 
analysis and discussion ( such as by the head of an independent review of banks 
Sir John Vickers, who said the stress tests were not rigorous enough.)

An ITV report 
<http://www.itv.com/news/2017-01-10/sir-john-vickers-bank-of-england-stress-tests-not-tough-enough/>
 said using more rigorous tests would have meant only Lloyds passed, but Carney 
and co said they could not see how this result was achieved and seemed 
satisfied with the outcome of their own tests.

Martin Taylor: People say that anyway. We don’t consider that. We try to set 
stress which is severe and plausible and put the system through the wringer.

Pound hits new 31 year low against the dollar

Meanwhile the pound has hit a new 31 year low against the dollar - excluding 
the flash crash - with the US currency boosted ahead of Donald Trump’s press 
conference on hopes of details of his plans for the country’s economy.Sterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has fallen as low as $1.2039 
and is now down 1% at $1.2056. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX 
Capital, said:

The move looks dollar driven with the buck heavy bid at day highs across the 
board ahead of Donald Trump’s news conference.

It’s now looking very precarious indeed for sterling and we could see it drop 
further as stops are triggered. Cable is down another 1% today and is flirting 
with flash crash lows and could spark more selling.

The correlation between the pound and the FTSE is obvious. The sharp move 
south at 15:18 saw sterling dip half a cent against the dollar in just a minute 
and we witnessed a corresponding move in the FTSE 100 at the exact same time, 
with the index jumping 10 points in 60 seconds. At pixel time it was rocking 
new highs at 7,321, on course for yet another record close.

Risks have stayed the same so far after Trump - Bank

Tyrie: is Trump a risk to financial stability?

Anil Kashyap: The committee hasn’t discussed this but personally, the first 
thing will be Trump filling the vice chair position at Federal Reserve. That 
could change the way the Fed negotiates over financial stability issues.

It still takes 60 votes in Senate to do many things, anything attached to tax 
and spending review you need 50. Anything to do with rolling back Dodd Franks, 
they can’t do that will just 50 votes.

He can do personal changes immediately.

Tyrie: so has risk up or stayed the same?

The same, the number of things the US can do unilaterally that he can trigger 
is limited in the short term.

And finally, the chair of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie has 
commented on the session with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He said:

The Governor has given strong advice today, both to the UK Government and to 
the governments of the rest of the EU. He’s told the Government that it is 
“highly advisable” to seek agreement to transitional arrangements, and at the 
start of the negotiations.

And he’s also told the UK’s negotiating counterparts in the EU that they, more 
than the UK, are vulnerable to financial stability risks during the period of 
transition. I hope they are all listening.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
In Europe the mood was also fairly buoyant while in the US, the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average ricocheted between positive and negative and positive again 
as president elect Donald Trump gave his press conference. The final scores in 
Europe showed:

 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.54% to 11,646.17 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.01% to 4888.71 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.32% to 19,486.88 
 * But Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.46% at 9408.6 
Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points at 19,874 
having been as high as 19,973 and as low as 19,833 during the day so far.
 
While Carney was speaking, the FTSE 100 ran up three new records, as 
continuing weakness in the pound - it hit a near 32 year low against the dollar 
excluding last year’s flash crash- continued to drive overseas earners higher.

The index smashed through the 7300 level although it later slipped back as the 
pound came off its worst levels, ending up 15.02 at 7290.49.

That marked a new peak, the tenth day of record closes and the 12th day of 
rises. All three never seen before. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves 
Lansdown, said:

The Footsie has now seen a dozen days of price increases, in what amounts to 
its longest winning streak ever. It won’t go on forever, but the winter rally 
has shown it has considerable legs.

It’s not just the miners and international companies benefiting from lower 
sterling which are sustaining the rally, some domestically-focussed stocks are 
also chipping in, which suggests some optimism towards the prospects for UK 
companies is driving the market upward too.
 
In a two and a half hour session, Bank of England chair Mark Carney and 
members of its financial policy committee were quizzed on Brexit, forecasting 
and stress tests.

Carney said Brexit was no longer the most significant domestic risk to 
financial stablity. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587640e2e4b0710de27b870d#block-587640e2e4b0710de27b870d>
 But he maintained thatthe Bank’s actions had mitigated the risks around the 
referendum vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58763e63e4b0f10ba20b7069#block-58763e63e4b0f10ba20b7069>

On the Brexit discussions, Carney said the consequences of not having a 
transitional deal would be higher for the EU than for the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587641cae4b0710de27b8711#block-587641cae4b0710de27b8711>
.

On the subject of the Bank getting its forecasts wrong ahead of the vote, FPC 
member Martin Taylor said thatjust because there had not been a problem yet, 
that meant there would not be problems. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587646dfe4b0f10ba20b7080#block-587646dfe4b0f10ba20b7080>

Carney says forecasting has improved because they look at what could go wrong 
rather than thinking everything was going right. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-587648e2e4b0710de27b872d#block-587648e2e4b0710de27b872d>
 He repeats thatthe Bank’s actions and preparations helped mitigate some of the 
risks following the vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5876499ee4b0c0afac91fad9#block-5876499ee4b0c0afac91fad9>

Martin Taylor said he was surprised at the strength of the economy since the 
Brexit vote, but it was becauseforecasters overestimated the negative effect of 
the referendum on consumer confidence. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58764af4e4b0710de27b8737#block-58764af4e4b0710de27b8737>

Speaking of forecasts, Carney suggested the Bank was likely to lift its UK 
growth forecasts in February. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58764a62e4b0710de27b8731#block-58764a62e4b0710de27b8731>

Anil Kashyap of the FPC reckons the risk to financial stability has not yet 
increased because of the election of Donald Trump, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58764df7e4b0c0afac91fae9#block-58764df7e4b0c0afac91fae9>
 but the Bank admitted it was monitoring the president elect’s Twitter account 
given his potential for market moving comments.

The Bank members also spent some time defending the latest bank stress tests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5876534de4b0710de27b8760#block-5876534de4b0710de27b8760>
, notably to suggestions they were not rigorous enough.

And there were also concerns about the high levels of consumer credit. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/11/wef-global-economic-risks-trump-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-58765ac9e4b0c0afac91fb41#block-58765ac9e4b0c0afac91fb41>
 
And after some discussion about the buy to let market, the session ends. Chair 
Andrew Tyrie says that “ as usual when we start talking about financial 
stability we end with the housing market”, and thanks them for coming.
 
Is housing market sustainable, with prices relative to income back to levels 
seen in 2008?

Alex Brazier: That rise in level in house prices relative to income has not, 
as it did in 2008, meant a rise in household debt. It’s not house prices per 
se, it’s the level of household debt, and [that] shows a completely different 
picture.
 
Question on the 10.8% growth in consumer credit last year. Is the Bank too 
relaxed or complacent about this?

FPC executive director Alex Brazier says he’s not relaxed: Consumer credit 
growth is difficult to ignore. What are the risks to financial stability? We 
have been discussing the loosening of credit conditions, such as a doubling of 
interest rate free periods for credit cards. We need to be alert and vigilant.

It has been a driver of consumer spending, so it’s important how we should 
address it, as it has a broader economic resilience.
 
Carney and his committee defend the results of the tests, but says he welcomes 
analysis and discussion ( such as by the head of an independent review of banks 
Sir John Vickers, who said the stress tests were not rigorous enough.)

An ITV report 
<http://www.itv.com/news/2017-01-10/sir-john-vickers-bank-of-england-stress-tests-not-tough-enough/>
 said using more rigorous tests would have meant only Lloyds passed, but Carney 
and co said they could not see how this result was achieved and seemed 
satisfied with the outcome of their own tests.
 
Anil Kashyap says he expects it will become exceptional for UK banks to fail 
the stress test in future.
 
Question on bank stress tests, when RBS failed in November: Should we expect 
every year to see at least one bank fail so we can’t say they are not difficult 
enough.

Martin Taylor: People say that anyway. We don’t consider that. We try to set 
stress which is severe and plausible and put the system through the wringer.
 
Meanwhile the pound has hit a new 31 year low against the dollar - excluding 
the flash crash - with the US currency boosted ahead of Donald Trump’s press 
conference on hopes of details of his plans for the country’s economy.Sterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> has fallen as low as $1.2039 
and is now down 1% at $1.2056. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX 
Capital, said:

The move looks dollar driven with the buck heavy bid at day highs across the 
board ahead of Donald Trump’s news conference.

It’s now looking very precarious indeed for sterling and we could see it drop 
further as stops are triggered. Cable is down another 1% today and is flirting 
with flash crash lows and could spark more selling.

The correlation between the pound and the FTSE is obvious. The sharp move 
south at 15:18 saw sterling dip half a cent against the dollar in just a minute 
and we witnessed a corresponding move in the FTSE 100 at the exact same time, 
with the index jumping 10 points in 60 seconds. At pixel time it was rocking 
new highs at 7,321, on course for yet another record close.
 
Question: Do you monitor Trump’s Twitter account in case he says something,.

Carney: Yes. We monitor your Twitter account, chairman. So yes we follow it.

We look forward to working with the new US members.
 
Tyrie: is Trump a risk to financial stability?

Anil Kashyap: The committee hasn’t discussed this but personally, the first 
thing will be Trump filling the vice chair position at Federal Reserve. That 
could change the way the Fed negotiates over financial stability issues.

It still takes 60 votes in Senate to do many things, anything attached to tax 
and spending review you need 50. Anything to do with rolling back Dodd Franks, 
they can’t do that will just 50 votes.

He can do personal changes immediately.

Tyrie: so has risk up or stayed the same?

The same, the number of things the US can do unilaterally that he can trigger 
is limited in the short term.
