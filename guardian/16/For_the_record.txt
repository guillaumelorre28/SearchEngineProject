A headline “Hacking of US energy grid linked to claims of Russian interference 
in presidential elections” (World news, last week, page 22 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/31/russia-hacking-malware-vermont-electric-obama>
), was incorrect. While the Burlington Electric Department in Vermont reported 
finding a laptop containing malware code linked to cyber attacks on the 
Democratic National Committee, the laptop was not connected to the electricity 
grid.

While boxers such as Jake LaMotta and Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) 
trained at Gleason’s gym in New York, as mentioned in “My Boy, The Boxer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/jan/01/my-seven-year-old-son-the-boxer>
” (Observer Magazine, page 20, last week), it was not then at its current 
location in Brooklyn. Clay and LaMotta trained at Bobby Gleason’s gym in the 
Bronx, where it existed from 1937 to 1974. A 1976 photograph of Ali, which 
accompanied the piece, was taken when Gleason’s was at West 30th Street in 
Manhattan. It has been at its current Brooklyn location since 1984.

Tippi Hedren starred in Hitchcock’s The Birds, not Vertigo, as we mistakenly 
said in a panel accompanying a piece on Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher (“
Fame, fallings-out and a lasting legacy of stardom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/01/debbie-reynolds-carrie-fisher-hollywood-mother-daughter-bright-lights-documentary>
”, In Focus, last week, page 30).
