Trotting hungrily through the streets of San Sebastián, local food writer 
Sasha Correa stops atBar Goiz-Argi 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bar-Goiz-Argi/177054849089118>, “a great 
place”. Really? It’s shoulder-wide and looks like a betting shop, with its 
neon, and floor littered with serviettes. However, it is packed and no one’s 
doing selfies withpintxos, they’re just here to eat them. Yes, yes, the seaside 
city has nine Michelin-star restaurants, but exquisite, odd, innovative and 
gloriously beautiful food is also available pretty much everywhere. It does 
help having an expert to tell you where to start, so I asked 10 gourmands for 
their pick of the local restaurants and bars.

Bodegón Alejandro

This is a bit like a dungeon, but in a good and glowing way. Its proximity to 
Mercado de la Bretxa made it the bolthole of choice for traders, a place to 
tuck in to cheap fish andtxakoli (sparkling dry white wine), pork and cider 
after work. Now very much upgraded, chef Inaxio Valverde still makes good use 
of the market’s fresh, local and seasonal produce. A menu weighted towards fish 
in summer – cold, marinated anchovy lasagne with gazpacho cream (€15.50), 
grilled hake in citrus vinaigrette (€21) – leans towards game through winter. 
The apple pie with rosemary trifle and lemon thyme ice-cream (€8.50) is a 
permanent fixture, along with the selection of local cheeses: Bidearte, 
Txapalak, Pikuñeta and Urdina (€11.50). Two main dining areas are dominated by 
an enormous luminous inky painting of the San Sebastián coast, the gleaming 
wooden tables are engraved with maps and quotes, and the lighting is conducive 
to a boozy lunch. The parents of multi-Michelin-star chefMartín Berasategui 
<https://www.martinberasategui.com/es/inicio> once ran this restaurant, and it 
was here, at the tender age of 13, that he started learning his trade.

A buzzing spot, open to the street, with dark, mould-dusted Iberian hams 
hanging from the wall, and a small bar piled high with artfully decorated 
pintxos that look like cakes in a fancy patisserie. In fact, they are created 
from fish, foie, mushrooms balanced on puff pastry and griddled bread, topped 
with decorative slithers of anchovies orguindillas (pickled chillis); and of 
course, they’re salty, designed to be drunk with a sharp, fresh txakoli, the 
local wine. You could stand here – or at least try … it’s crowded – and stuff 
yourself, or retire to the intimate restaurant for some of the best hake in 
town. Try the moist, flakingkokotxas (the chins of hake or cod, €29.50), baby 
squid, elvers and big fish – sole, wild turbot, bream – sold by weight and 
charcoal-grilled for two to share. This is a popular after-hours hangout for 
chefs.

Like anchovies? You’ll love Txepetxa, a bar with a menu that stars them. And 
because each pintxo is cheap and small, there’s no need to choose between 
antxoas with foie and apple compote, or with roe, or sea urchin, or papaya. You 
can have the lot. With football on the TV, aluminium barrels in the corner, 
plastic ferns, just the three tables, and a general air of convivial 
scruffiness, it all looks too normal to be a compulsory stop for foodies and 
visiting celebrities, but study the newspaper cuttings and photos on the wall 
and you’ll spotjefe Manu posing with everyone from Ferran Adrià  
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ferran-adria>and Juan Mari Arzak to 
Glenn Close and Gandalf. Don’t help yourself to the food on the bar: it’s 
plastic, a Basque take on Japanese sampuru.

“It’s a very small, old-style bar,” says food expert José Luis Galiana, “where 
you get tomatoes, pimientos, chops and chorizo. That’s it. But it’s very de 
moda,” he continues with enthusiasm, “and always full because the tomato is 10 
out of 10. The pimiento is 10 out of 10. You have to stand at a bar to eat the 
chops: there is only one table. You can reserve it, but you would have to do it 
six months in advance. And at 1pm and 8pm they bring out one tortilla – only 
one. You only get a piece if you’ve come early and ordered it in advance. It’s 
pure magic.” Several local chefs concur; everyone has a soft spot for Néstor, 
which despite its fame and ever-increasing numbers of visiting tourists remains 
a quirky (and tiny) local hangout.

There’s rich grazing in the barrio of Gros, a few minutes across the river 
from Parte Vieja. Less atmosphere and fewer tourists allow a fighting chance of 
elbow space on some surface, any surface; though not on Thursdays, when most 
bars in these parts offer a cheap pintxo and drink combo, prompting the 
gourmands’ take on a pub crawl. Bergara is legendary in San Sebastián and 
recommended for its huge variety of prize-winning pintxos and exquisite 
service. Unusually white, bright and modern, it’s beautiful to look at, and 
patient staff will provide a detailed description of every creation on request. 
But by the time they’ve said: “Thetxalupa is mushrooms, king prawns, cream and 
cava, served hot in a puff pastry boat, topped with grated cheese”, or 
“txapeldun is a prawn cocktail with pineapple in syrup, apple and roe” you’d 
have finished two of each, so it’s best just to wade in. At an average €3 a 
pinto, and with amenu de degustación (six pintxos, drink, dessert) for €23, you 
can’t go wrong.

Hefty portions, low prices, glowing reputation: La Cuchara is not exactly

It might look more like a yummy-mummy brunch cafe with its rough white-painted 
walls, blue wooden facade, sunflowers, and street terrace, this bodega is an 
old landmark (1928) with well-established gastro credentials, famous for moist, 
even runny, individually-sized tortillas (€2.10) andensalada de morros, pig 
snout sliced thin like carpaccio. According to Tatus, the bocadillo de bonito, 
anchovy and guindilla is a must. Showy pintxos are the star act (from around 
€1.50), but for around €5 you can get a plateful ofcallos y morros (tripe and 
snout) or black pudding and rice with peppers, and – unusually – the 
possibility of a seat.

As head of a centre for gastronomic excellence in a city with Europe’s highest 
concentration of Michelin stars per capita, deciding where to take dinner 
guests is not a decision to take lightly. The Basque Culinary Center’s Joxe 
Mari Aizega often comes to this restaurant and pintxos bar, indistinguishable 
in its old-fashioned looks from others in Parte Vieja, but serving exceptional 
food. Its chef, Pablo Loureiro, is blessed with the confidence to simply 
unleash the deliciousness of fish like wild turbot and serve the whole thing 
buttery soft on a plate to be picked apart, shared and marvelled over. Main 
course classics such as grilled octopus over kale, or anchovies andventresca de 
bonito with guindillas (€16.50) are top-value, and the eggy, crunchy caramelised
torrija a la antigua (€7) alone is worth the wait for a table.

Not merely recommended but created by seven of the top Basque country chefs: 
Juan María Arzak, Pedro Subijana, Eneko Atxa, Martín Berasategui, Andoni Luis 
Aduriz, Karlos Arguiñano and Hilario Arbelaitz. You can book a day course and 
prepare your own food at this university of gastronomy and centre for foodie 
innovation, or better still, eat in the cafeteria. The cafeteria is a lovely, 
calm space divided between stylish refectory for staff, and smart starchy white 
cloth-covered tables for visitors. With a tasting menu prepared by the 
masterchefs of tomorrow, you won’t find newer New Basque Cuisine or, priced at 
€24 (plus drinks) better value. In a park-side building designed to look like a 
stack of plates, it is only open for lunch, but keep an eye out for ad hoc 
dinner events in the centre’s restaurant (often advertised on
aprendiendodeloschefs.blogspot.com.es 
<http://aprendiendodeloschefs.blogspot.co.uk/>).

“Gerald was trying to get back to England from Barcelona when the [eruption of 
Iceland volcano] Eyjafjallajökull disrupted the flights,” says Bella (from 
London) who works behind the bar, “so he came to San Sebastián instead.” 
Presumably a similar thing happened in Australia as he also has a bar in 
Melbourne. Here, the upmarket pub vibe, good music and warm ambience offers a 
bit of variation on the pintxos circuit. A mouthwatering list of familiar local 
produce given a bit of cosmopolitan pizazz is chalked up on the board, 
including fishcakes de bonito y txancurro, wild boar terrine, and an 
unspecified “sexy beast” con mole. In San Sebastián that could be anything, but 
inevitably good.
