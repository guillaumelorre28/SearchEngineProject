Fiction

The Secret of Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel (Cape). Her graphic memoir 
Fun Home, about her relationship with her father and her own coming out, made 
her one of America’s most-loved cartoonists: a new graphic novel will be an 
event.

Events and anniversaries

Bicentenary of the posthumous publication of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, 
when Jane Austen was identified as the author of her novels for the first time 
in a biographical note by her brother.
