Our website is designed to work in all situations. However, we are aware that 
certain features can cause problems on some older devices/browsers or slow 
internet connections. We try to detect and manage all of this automatically, 
but it’s not always possible. Because of that, we have made it possible for you 
to switch the optional features on or off yourself.

Switching the extra features on and off

Click here to switch optional features ON 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk#gu.prefs.enhanced=true>

Click here to switch optional features OFF 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk#gu.prefs.enhanced=false>

In the future we’ll be making all this even easier. In the meantime, you can 
tell if the features are switched on and off by checking if the weather is 
displayed at the top of the front page, or not.

What you will see

When the features are switched off the site looks identical, but certain 
secondary elements are not shown or behave slightly differently.

The optional features that will be switched off include*:

 * The ability to write and delete comments - they will still be viewable 
 * Related Content links within certain pieces of content 
 * Most Popular links within pieces of content - you will however be able to 
view the Most Popular content for a section on a separate link 
 * The Weather information on the front page 
*Please note that this is a work in progress, this list may change. 

If you wish to access one of these features on a given page without changing 
your setting (for example if you prefer the extra features to be off overall 
but wish to comment on a given page) a page can be loaded with all features 
enabled by appending “#enhanced” to the end of the url.

For example: http://www.theguardian.com/uk#enhanced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk#enhanced> and refreshing the page will give you 
the full-featured network front without changing your default settings.
