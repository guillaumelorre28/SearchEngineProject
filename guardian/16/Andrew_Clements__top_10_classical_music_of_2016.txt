1 Martha Argerich and Daniel Barenboim
BBC Proms, Royal Albert Hall, London

Daniel Barenboim and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/16/daniel-barenboim-on-ageing-mistakes-and-why-israel-and-iran-are-twin-brothers>
 are now almost annual visitors to the Proms, with every appearance seeming to 
mark a further stage in the development of this remarkable musical partnership. 
But their visit to the Royal Albert Hall this summer was even more memorable 
than usual, for they brought with them a very special guest soloist.

Martha Argerich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/video/2015/may/01/watch-a-clip-from-argerich-stephanie-argerichs-film-pianist-mother-video>
 may have celebrated her 75th birthday in June, but age shows no signs of 
dulling the edge of her brilliance; she remains unique – the most thrilling 
pianist of our time. Her performance of Liszt’s First Piano Concerto had all 
the wit, sparkle and grandeur anyone could possibly want and with every 
keyboard run and arpeggio etched with diamond precision, her technical command 
was breathtaking. Barenboim ensured that the orchestra provided the perfect 
platform for such exceptional playing, before joining Argerich for an encore – 
Schubert’s A major Rondo for piano duet. Here were two great musicians, friends 
since they were both child prodigies in Buenos Aires, delighting in each 
other’s astonishing talent.

There were more treats to come after the interval, for the Wagner sequence 
that Barenboim conducted not only provided further evidence of what a refined 
and responsive ensemble the WEDO has become under his guidance, but also a 
reminder that he has very few peers as a Wagner interpreter today. Whether 
encapsulating the whole drama of Tannhäuser in a thrilling and spacious account 
of its overture, or conjuring up the fierce, dark sound world of 
Götterdämmerung in Siegfried’s Rhine Journey and Funeral March, it was 
unforgettable.Read the full review

 Triumph … Alan Oke and Johan Reuter in Oedipe by George Enescu. Photograph: 
Tristram Kenton for the Guardian 
Eighty years after its premiere, one of the 20th century’s most singular 
operatic masterpieces finally reached a British stage. George Enescu’s work 
sometimes shuttles between opera and oratorio, but the best of the sinewy score 
is unmistakably dramatic, and the Royal Opera’s production, staged by theFura 
dels Baus <http://www.lafura.com/en/> team led by Alex Ollé, with Johan Reuter 
in the title role, was musically and theatrically an unmissable triumph for the 
company.Read a full review

 Volans verve … Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. Photograph: BCMG/Clive 
Barda 
Birmingham Contemporary Music Group devoted its last concert of the year to 
two major Volans premieres. One was his latest piano concerto, the fourth, 
written for soloist Barry Douglas, the other was his 12th String Quartet, a 
35-minute journey through a musical landscape of irregular pulsings, pizzicatos 
and sudden glassy chords, in which the two parallel strands in Volans’ music, 
the folk traditions of his native South Africa and the post-1945 experimental 
tradition, are magically interwoven.Read a full review

Pierre-Laurent Aimard marked the end of his tenure as Aldeburgh festival’s 
artistic director with a day-long performance of the biggest solo-piano work by 
his former teacher Olivier Messiaen. Beginning as the sun rose over the Suffolk 
marshes, and ending at Snape Maltings just before midnight, Aimard presented 
the 13 pieces as a dawn-to-dusk tour de force, which included an evening 
recital at the RSPB Minsmere reserve, where real birdsong vied with Messiaen’s 
transcriptions.Read a full review

In what was generally a rather lacklustre year for London’s orchestras, the

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/23/esa-pekka-salonen-conductor-composer-facing-the-music>
, stood out for its freshness and originality. Some of Stravinsky’s greatest 
and most neglected masterpieces were included, often in ingenious concert 
stagings, and if some of those did not work quite as convincingly as they might 
have done, the musical performances under Salonen were always of the highest 
quality.Read a full review

Photograph: Clive Barda 
The quality of Peter Eötvös’s stage works over the past two decades has been 
rather uneven. But The Golden Dragon, based onRoland Schimmelpfennig’s play 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/12/golden-dragon-edinburgh-review>
, is a tragicomic delight, a chamber opera with just five singers taking on a 
host of gender-swapping roles, that is both genuinely funny, and searingly 
serious; Music Theatre Wales’s hugely accomplished production gets a full UK 
tour next spring.Read a full review
