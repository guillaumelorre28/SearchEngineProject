Inflation <https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation> is set to hit its 
highest level in more than two years this week, according to economists, as the 
sharp drop in sterling since the referendum fuels a rise in the cost of living.

Official figures due to be published on Tuesday are expected to show that 
fuel, food, air fares and clothing prices have driven the headline rate to 1.4% 
in December, from 1.2% in November. If economists polled by Reuters are 
correct, the rate would be the highest since August 2014, when the consumer 
prices index was 1.5%.

“Inflation is expected to have been lifted in December by higher fuel prices 
as well as sterling’s weakness increasingly feeding through to cause retailers, 
services companies and manufacturers to lift their prices,” said Howard Archer, 
chief UK economist at research company IHS Markit.

The Bank of England has warned life will be tougher for consumers in 2017

, with inflation expected to rise close to 3%, squeezing family budgets against 
a backdrop of slowing economic growth.

Meanwhile, National Debtline said the number of people seeking advice on how 
to cope with debts was up sharply compared with a year earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/03/debt-charities-struggling-consumers-advice-early-citizens-advice-debtline>
. Calls to the free advice service were up 17% in the first eight working days 
of 2017 compared with the same period last year, while the number of people 
seeking advice online jumped by 55%.

Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs 
National Debtline, said households should scrutinise their finances as 
inflation rises. She said: “As the first credit card bills of 2017 begin to 
arrive through letterboxes this week, many people will be worrying about how to 
cope. We are seeing a big leap in the number of people coming to us for help – 
and yet we know that many more will be struggling with financial problems on 
their own.

“With the UK economy entering a period of significant uncertainty and 
inflation beginning to creep up, it is important that households use the start 
of the year to take stock of their personal finances – and take action to deal 
with any debts now.”

Some of Britain’s biggest retailers have warned prices could rise in 2017

the cost of goods imported from abroad more expensive.Next has warned clothing 
prices could rise by about 5% in the coming months.

products Kantar compares year-on-year in the proportions purchased by shoppers.
