Less than 200km from Tunis, Palermo is like nowhere else in Europe. Defying 
the mafia in a maze of crumbling grandeur, it is at the crossroads of the 
Mediterranean. Every neighbouring power has occupiedSicily 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/sicily> at some time, which has created a 
sizzling mix of Arabic food, Spanish streets, Norman towers and Italian neglect.

The old town is full of baroque palaces, their facades rich with statues, 
above alleys strewn with litter. Families live on their doorsteps like a scene 
from a 1950s film. Some streets are still being rebuilt after being bombed by 
the allies in the second world war. This is Italy in the raw.

And among all this, the traditional evening promenade, the passeggiata, is 
still very much alive here. There are aristocrats struggling to maintain 
historic palaces, and vibrant street life on every rococo corner. So this is a 
very old Italy, too. The closest parallel is probably Havana, another decaying 
former Spanish colony filled with ghosts and stories and heroes. Catch this one 
before it changes – and with being warm long into autumn, it’s not too late to 
visit this year.

 Norman bling … the Palatine Chapel. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
The unmissable sites in this city are the astonishing buildings of the Norman 
kings who conquered Sicily in 1072. For a century they ran Europe’s most 
sophisticated royal court, a centre for science, art and commerce based on 
tolerance of all faiths and nationalities. They left behind a fabulous blend of 
Romanesque architecture, Byzantine mosaics and Arabic domes.

First stop is the royal palace, the Palazzo dei Normanni 
<https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=it&u=http://www.cappellapalatinapalermo.it/&prev=search>
 on Piazza Indipendenza, whose highlight is the Palatine Chapel, covered in 
golden mosaics of scenes from the Bible. If it sounds dull, it feels bling. 
More intimate is the church of La Martorana in Piazza Bellini, with mosaic 
figures across its Romanesque arches. But the top sightseeing spot is out of 
town: the cathedral at Monreale, five miles south of Palermo, has gorgeous 
ceilings and walls decorated by master mosaicists who were brought here all the 
way from Byzantium. They offer a real sense of the power and mystery of 
medieval faith.

The centre of Palermo feels like a stage set – its streets all baroque facades 
run to ruin, its people open to communal living. There are outdoor dances in 
old squares and crowds at the sunset passeggiata. Street markets – boisterous 
affairs with the energy and edge of an African bazaar – are held on weekday 
mornings in Piazza Ballarò, Via Sant’Agostino and Piazza San Domenico.

The delightful Duchess of Lampedusa, Nicoletta Polo, holds food-shopping and 
cookery days, starting in the noisy street market of Capo and ending with a 
five-course Sicilian meal in her elegant palace. She is the daughter-in-law of 
the author of Italy’s bestselling novel ever, The Leopard, which told the story 
of Sicilian aristocrats facing change. Her palace was owned by the real-life 
central character of the novel, Fabrizio, and is where the author died. For a 
taste of history, as well as local food, it doesn’t get more real than this.

Anti-mafia tour

Despite major triumphs by the justice system in the 1990s, an ongoing reality 
of everyday life here is the mafia. Born out of resistance to centuries of 
oppression by foreign overlords, this secret network of alliances has dominated 
the economy of the island and, to a lesser extent, the entire nation for at 
least a century. Since the shocking assassination of crusading anti-mafia 
judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992 (after whom Palermo 
airport is named), a grassroots movement against paying mafia protection money, 
orpizzo, has emerged – and now there is a No Mafia tour of the town. This 
guided half-day includes the courthouse where mafiosi have been tried, and 
various sites and businesses associated with the anti-pizzo campaign.

 Teatro Massimo. Photograph: Alamy 
In a fit of nationalistic ambition during the unification of Italy (1861-71), 
Palermo opened the Teatro Massimo, Europe’s third-largest opera house. Built 
like a gigantic Roman temple, it looms over Piazza Verdi and the strolling 
crowds at sunset. Acclaimed tenor Caruso sang here in his twenties and it still 
attracts major stars. Tickets are available for opera and ballet in the season 
(non-summer months), and to tour the building at other times – including a 
rooftop climb for panoramic views.

Meanwhile GAM – theGalleria d’Arte Monderna a Palermo 
<http://www.gampalermo.it/en/> (€7) – shows Sicilian works of the modernist 
period in a pretty converted palace.

 Solunto, with Palermo in the background. Photograph: Alamy 
Six miles west of the city is a headland above the sea with sweeping views and 
stunning Roman ruins. Solunto is the most-excavated site on the island, and it 
is possible to wander an entire town – there are courtyard villas with painted 
walls and mosaic floors, a marketplace with columns and shops, the old baths 
still holding water, and an amphitheatre overgrown with weeds. Generations of 
Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks and Romans have walked these cobbled 
streets. It’s hugely atmospheric and rarely gets crowded: you’re as likely to 
see herds of goats as hordes of tourists.

This tiny place in the old stables of the grand Palazzo Gangi is one of the 
top restaurants in town, yet surprisingly affordable. Run by the Rizzo 
brothers, it serves traditional Sicilian food with an exquisite contemporary 
twist. Expect gourmet standards and views on to a fine medieval square.

Antica Pizzeria Bellini

This modestly priced trattoria offers outdoor tables on the city’s loveliest 
square, Piazza Bellini, between the baroque church of Santa Caterina and the 
Norman chapel of San Cataldo with its Arab-influenced domes. The ravioli with 
prawns is a steal at €12 and entitles diners to linger in the sun for hours.
