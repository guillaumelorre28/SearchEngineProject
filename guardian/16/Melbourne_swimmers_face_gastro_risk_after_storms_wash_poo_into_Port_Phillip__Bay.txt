Swimmers are being warned of gastro risk at Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> beaches because recent 
heavy storms have washed poo into Port Phillip Bay.

Environmental Protection Victoria’s website listed 21 of the 36 beaches it 
monitors around the bay as having poor water quality on Monday, meaning the 
water was not suitable for swimming.

The EPA’s Anthony Boxshall said waste had washed into the bay following last 
week’s heavy storms and the more recent, lighter rainfall.

“We have indicators we look for [in water tests], which is an indicator of 
faecal contamination, which is a really nice way of saying poo,” Boxshall told 
ABC News 24 on Monday.

“It’s bird poo, it’s horse poo, it’s cow poo and it’s people poo. It is 
everything that washes in from the streets, and everything that comes out 
through the storm water system.”

Swimmers who ingest contaminated water have a higher risk of getting 
gastroenteritis and other illnesses, particularly the elderly and children.

Beaches on the Mornington Peninsula south of Frankston were still suitable for 
swimming. Boxshall said the water should clear up in 24-48 hours if it didn’t 
continue to rain.

More tests will be conducted this week and results posted on the EPA website. 
The Bureau of Meteorology forecast a maximum of 19C on Monday, with light 
drizzle in the morning and evening.
