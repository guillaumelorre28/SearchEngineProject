Ian McEwan’s new book Nutshell is inspired by Hamlet and told from the 
perspective of a foetus witnessing a murder from inside his mother’s womb. It 
has been describedby the Guardian as “virtuoso entertainment” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/30/nutshell-ian-mcewan-review-hamlet-foetus>
 by a practiced storyteller. McEwan told an audience at the book’s launch last 
week, organised by the Guardian, that his in-utero narrator isa 
“left-of-centre” foetus who celebrates a diverse range of gender identities

. Six Guardian members who attended the launch, from school teacher to craft 
beer entrepreneur, said the renowned author and his book kept them fascinated 
and entertained.

I recently read Atonement and The Children Act and really enjoyed them, and I 
thought the premise of Ian McEwan’s new novella Nutshell looked strangely 
interesting. I got the book on the night of the event, started reading it 
straight away and then continued on the train home.


I thought it was fascinating to have the narrator in the womb as the 
detective. I was also intrigued by the science of the idea, how the baby is 
trying to pick up signals and make sense of the world around him. McEwan said 
he had been reading a lot of Shakespeare and that the novel was based partly on 
Hamlet, with the baby questioning himself about the world around him in a 
similar way to the play’s protagonist. The murder is based on Macbeth. It’s a 
fitting tribute considering 2016 is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s 
death.

McEwan seems to be political, and many of his views appear to be reflected in 
the baby - he listens to the BBC World Service, and there were references to 
Palestine and Istanbul. Someone asked how the baby would feel about Brexit: 
very disappointed, McEwan said, as he was pro-Europe and wanted the world to be 
united. The baby is trying to make sense of the world and judges the negative 
things that take place. He wants the world to be more harmonious.

I love reading and writing, and one thing I took away with me was that McEwen 
recommended keeping a journal to generate ideas. I work with children and they 
often find it difficult to come up with ideas so this is something I will 
definitely use.

I’ve been an admirer of McEwan’s novels for many years. He struck me as a man 
with a typical sense of English humour, full of understatement. He gave us a 
good tip: “Lock the door of your study and read your text aloud.”

When he started reading Nutshell to us I became very enthusiastic. The 
intonation and accents he put into the text made it very special and lifted the 
evening.

The outlook of the world from the uterus is an amazing point of view, and 
sometimes a little shocking – an embryo that has thoughts and feelings and also 
explicit preferences for wines!

McEwan is often called the master of suspense. With one word he can give a 
clue to the storyline of the book. The sentences themselves are built and 
structured very well. I think you could compare him to an architect: the 
concrete and bricks he uses to design and build his novels are sentences and 
words, all very precisely and carefully chosen.

I went to the event as a devotee of Ian McEwan’s novels, which turn up every 
couple of years just as summer is ending. I sat next to an amusing American 
author from Stanford University, but stupidly didn’t ask his name.

I liked it when a woman asked if he ever had any self-doubt. He visibly 
winced, I imagine at the memory of sitting alone for decades trying to invent 
plausible yet gripping worlds. Then someone asked for advice on writing 
dialogue and he said you have to act it out - but it’s quite hard to imagine 
him doing something as uncool as putting on funny voices.

I have only just started to read Nutshell. I usually have a little weep at the 
close of his novels that engage both head and heart so vigorously, but Nutshell 
sounds wacky.

I first read In Between the Sheets 32 years ago, and now as part of a book 
group I have read several moreIan McEwan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/ianmcewan> stories and intend to read Black 
Dogs next. My favourite McEwen novels are Saturday and Atonement, which I 
thought had a brilliant sex scene in a library.

Nutshell promises to be quite a humorous book, with many of McEwan’s trademark 
references to the cultural aspects of life. His concerns about a narcissistic 
trend among some elements of youth were striking, as I hadn’t previously 
connected it with apathy towards global issues such as climate change and world 
poverty.

McEwen also made a memorable point about people’s intolerance of opposing 
opinions at universities and on social media. He suggested that people are 
becoming incapable of disagreeing without resorting to threats of violence, 
which is a reversal of civilised values.

Sharing a room with a writer enables you to feel much more connected to their 
work, and shows that it is a job for them - the words don’t just flow like 
magic.

I’m in my 60s and have been reading McEwan since his early novels, such as The 
Cement Garden [published in 1978]. The premise of Nutshell sounds good - it’s a 
novella, so only around 200 pages long, and he said you could read it in about 
four hours.

He was as sharp, witty and erudite as you’d expect. I’m normally a bit iffy 
about listening to authors talking about their books as they can be quite 
boring, but he was really interesting. I’m pleased that he made comments about 
the political landscape as he did in The Ploughman’s Lunch.

It’s interesting when you’ve read a number of books by a particular author to 
hear them speak in their own words. I’ve read a fair few of McEwan’s books - 
probably about half of them over the years.

The foetus as the narrator is a good idea. It’s a unique point of view and a 
classic example of requiring a suspension of disbelief. Once you do, it makes 
perfect sense that the foetus learns about the world by listening to Radio 4.

He said he doesn’t believe in writer’s block, he simply regards it as 
hesitation. As a writer I think he’s more perspiration than inspiration. He’s 
like a method actor for writers.

McEwan handled himself well and I like the fact he’s considered in his replies 
- it suits his method of writing. He said he was happy to talk in paragraphs. I 
could have listened to him for a lot longer – and it felt like he could have 
spoken for much longer too.
