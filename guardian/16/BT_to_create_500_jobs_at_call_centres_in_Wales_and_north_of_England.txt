BT has said it will create 500 jobs at four call centres in Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> and the north of England.

The roles will mainly be based at customer service centres in Swansea, 
Warrington, Doncaster and Accrington.

The jobs top a previously announced plan to recruit 1,000 people

 across the UK and Ireland by the end of March 2017.

Libby Barr, the managing director of customer care at BT Consumer, said on 
Monday: “We are proud to be creating these new jobs in the UK and Ireland.BT 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/btgroup> is completely changing the way 
we serve our customers in order to boost our service levels.

“We are going to answer 90% of our customers’ calls in the UK and Ireland by 
the end of March, and we have been taking on great people to fill full-time 
jobs working for BT.

“There are opportunities to earn £500 by referring a friend and also openings 
for agency advisers who want to work for BT directly.”

Last year, BT announced plans to increase the number of calls answered in the 
UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/sep/18/bt-promises-to-bring-call-centres-back-to-the-uk>
 from 50% to 80%, after customers said they did not like speaking to staff in 
Indian call centres.

The company created 1,000 UK call centre jobs in 2015 and doubled the figure 
in January. It has 20 call centres across the UK.

The plan is part of an effort to improve BT’s standing in the table of 
customer complaints compiled by Ofcom.
