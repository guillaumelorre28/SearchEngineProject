flight cancellations as 24 cities issued alerts that will last through much of 
the week.


On the first day of 2017 in Beijing, concentrations of tiny particles that 
penetrate deep into the lungs climbedas high as 24 times

Health Organization. More than 100 flights were cancelled and all intercity

In the neighbouring port city of Tianjin, more than 300 flights were cancelled 
while the weather forecast warned thick smog will persist until 5 January. All 
of the city‚Äôs highways were also shut as low visibility made driving hazardous, 
effectively trapping residents.

Across northern China 24 cities issued red alerts on Friday and Saturday, 
while orange alerts persisted in 21 cities through the New Year holiday. A red 
alert is the highest level of a four-tier warning system introduced as part of 
China‚Äôs high-profilewar on pollution

.

Decades of economic development have made acrid air a common occurrence in 
nearly all major Chinese cities, with government-owned coal burning power 
stations and heating plants and steel manufacturing concentrated in northern 
provinces the main source of pollution.

Smog worsens in the winter as coal burning spikes to provide heat for millions 
of people. China declared a ‚Äúwar on pollution‚Äù in 2014, but has struggled to 
deliver the sweeping change many had hoped to see and government inspections 
routinely find pollutions flouting the law.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt those polluting industries take a rest for the holiday,‚Äù one 
commenter mused on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo.

‚ÄúNew Year‚Äôs morning in Beijing, I thought I was blind,‚Äù said another, 
attaching a photo of a window completely darkened with grey haze.

China‚Äôs middle class is increasingly less tolerant of the deadly air, and in 
Decembertens of thousands of ‚Äúsmog refugees‚Äù decamped  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/smog-refugees-flee-chinese-cities-as-airpocalypse-blights-half-a-billion>
to clearer skies. Top destinations included Australia, Indonesia, Japan and the 
Maldives.

That bout of smog saw 460 million people 
<http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/blog/460-million-people-in-china-are-choking-under/blog/58343/>
, a population greater than North America, breathing toxic air, according to 
Greenpeace.

As pollution covered swaths of the country on New Year‚Äôs Eve, China announced 
plans <http://www.china.org.cn/china/2016-12/31/content_40018523.htm> to 
increase coal output to 3.9 billion tonnes by 2020.

A study earlier this year 
<http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2056553/smog-linked-third-deaths-china-more-deadly-smoking-study-finds>
 found acrid air is linked to at least one million deaths a year, and 
contributed to a third of all fatalities in major cities, on par with smoking. 
Another research paper said the smog had shortened life expectancies by five 
and a half years in parts of China.
