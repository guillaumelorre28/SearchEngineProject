 to capture the WBO light middleweight championship. The 26-year-old from 
Guadalajara had previously defeated Miguel Cotto for the WBC middleweight 
title, defending it once in May with a sixth-round knockout of Amir Khan before 
vacating to move back down to 154lbs.

Chávez Jr (50-2-1, 32 KOs), the 30-year-son of the Mexican fistic legend, won 
the WBC’s version of the middleweight title in 2011 and defended it three times 
before losing it to Sergio Martínez in 2012.

He’s had just five fights in the four years since, strugging with making 
weight in those outings. He ended a 17-month layoff in December with a 
unanimous-decision win over someone named Dominik Britsch.

ESPN reports that a penalty of $1m per pound over the limit has been written 
into the contract given Chávez Jr’s well-documented fitness struggles, citing 
sources close to the negotiations.
