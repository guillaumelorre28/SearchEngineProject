Twelve solutions (not further defined) belong to one of two groups (six apples 
and six pears), which as ‘apples and pears’ are cockney rhyming slang for a 
flight of stairs ie a LONDON FLIGHT (23,25 across).

The definition part in each of the remaining 16 clues contains a single letter 
misprint. In clue order, these incorrect letters spell out two locations for 
another sort of 23,25 across: HEATHROW and STANSTED.
