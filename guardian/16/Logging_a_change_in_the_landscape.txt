My first indication that the local landscape was about to change dramatically 
came after dark. In an area with only a scattering of houses and a solitary 
street lamp, the sudden appearance of an extra light is a significant event – 
and a flickering source moving through the trees certainly makes a rural 
observer stop and take note.

In daylight the explanation became clear. Across the valley, on the shoulder 
of a hill forming a buttress at the westward limit of theCambrian mountains 
<http://cambrian-mountains.co.uk/>, a stand of mature larches was being felled. 
Working outwards from the old track that loops sinuously across the hillside, 
heavy machinery was quickly and efficiently removing the trees, leaving the 
profile of the hill oddly rebalanced. Within a week or so the familiar dull 
orange of autumn foliage was gone, leaving a briefly scarred residue from which 
the woodland will regenerate or be replanted.

I will miss the warm evening light rolling across the trees on the skyline. 
But while thelarch 
<https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/common-non-native-trees/larch/>
 added welcome colour to the autumn scenery, large blocks of single species 
have brought an almost industrial look to many areas of the Welsh hills. By 
restocking these woodlands with a wider range of species, we have the 
opportunity to develop a more ecologically valuable landscape.

My usual reaction would be to walk over for a closer look at what has been 
done – but there is a compelling reason not to. Larch trees are particularly 
susceptible toPhytophthora ramorum 
<https://naturalresources.wales/forestry/tree-health-and-biosecurity/phytophthora-ramorum/?lang=en>
, a serious plant pathogen that has been attacking trees across Wales for the 
past few years, causing disfiguring lesions and die-back. While I don’t know 
whether this particular woodland has been infected,others in the area have 
succumbed <http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-86ajqa>, and the risk of 
spreading the disease is real. One of the best measures against it is in the 
hands – or rather the feet – of all those who work in or visit the countryside. 
Simply keeping your boots – and the tyres of your bike or car – clean will help 
avoid further distribution of this threat to our forests.
