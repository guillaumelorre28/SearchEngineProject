 and infants – tostay-at-home dad groups, 
<http://athomedad.org/dad-groups/find-a-dad-group/> the number of fathers who 
choose to be the primary caregiver for their kids hasquadrupled since 1989 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27626510>, according to a study by the Pew 
Research Center.

The proportion of men who want an active parenting role is also increasing: 
the 2017 Modern Families Index found that nearlyhalf of working fathers

 want to downshift to a less stressful job to help with childcare, and just 
over a third would be willing to take a pay cut to achieve a better work-life 
balance. Those figures were higher for younger fathers – indicating a shift in 
mentality.

Sarah Jackson, chief executive of Working Families, has also warned that 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/14/fatherhood-penalty-risk-men-charity-motherhood-penalty>
 as more fathers take on a child-rearing role, a “fatherhood penalty” is 
emerging in the workplace.

made you decide to become the main carer for your children? What was the 
reaction from family, friends and co-workers? And how has the decision affected
