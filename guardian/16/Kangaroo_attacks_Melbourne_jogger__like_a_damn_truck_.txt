A towering male kangaroo hit a Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> jogger “like a damn 
truck” in an attack that left her scratched, bleeding and needing emergency 
surgery.

Debbie Urquhart, a personal trainer, said the “big boy” who came out of 
nowhere and knocked her down was two metres tall.

Urquhart didn’t see him coming as she was out running on a bush track on 
Saturday morning near Westerfolds Park. “He came and he hit me like a damn 
truck and I didn’t know what was going on,” she told 3AW on Tuesday. “The more 
I was screaming the more he was going for me.”

Urquhart said the attack ended when she stopped screaming, allowing her to 
crawl into grass and hide.


She hobbled about 200 metres home, bleeding profusely, and her husband took 
her to hospital. She needed dozens of stitches and emergency surgery to repair 
a torn biceps muscle, a ripped deltoid and deep scratches to her back and 
buttocks.

“He pushed me down with his back feet and then just sort of clawed at me,” she 
said. “Me protecting myself is how my arm got ripped so badly. He could have 
got to my stomach or anything but I sort of protected myself with the grass 
and, thank God, he moved away.”

She told the Manningham Leader

 the roo had thrown her around “like a rag doll”. “He ripped me to pieces,” she 
said, adding: “I thought he was going to come back and kill me.”

Urquhart stayed in hospital until Sunday afternoon, returning to work on 
Monday. She said she was unlikely to return to the jogging track.
