Emma on Eddie 

What were you hoping for?
Marriage and kids. I’m nearly 30 and my dad keeps telling me it’s time to 
freeze my eggs.

First impressions?
I was too busy dropping my coat and pushing the menu off the table to notice 
much else at first.

What did you talk about?
Walking through Spain, Ramsbottom music festival 
<http://www.ramsmusicfest.org/> and the perks of plumbing if you’re a nosy 
parker.

Any awkward moments?
Sharing plates. There was a lot of over-polite “no, you finish it” going on.

Good table manners?
Impeccable.

Best thing about Eddie?
More to him than met the eye. I would never have guessed that he’d once been a 
music journalist.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Yes, absolutely.

Describe Eddie in three words?
Genuine, honest, open.

What do you think he made of you?
He probably thought I was a soft, poncey southerner.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, I was eager to begin my freezing cycle home.

And… did you kiss?
Nope.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I would have ordered two plates of the hake and lentil dish.

Marks out of 10?
7.

Would you meet again?
As friends, perhaps.

Eddie on Emma

What were you hoping for?
To maybe learn something new.

First impressions?
I liked her hair and big smile.

What did you talk about?
Bands, travelling, festivals.

Any awkward moments?
There was a runny fried egg we had to split. She wanted me to have the yolky 
bit.

Good table manners?
Yes, top drawer.

Best thing about Emma?
Her job is super cool – she gets to travel a lot and watch loads of awesome 
bands.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
Yes, some of my mates would get on well with Emma.

A cheeky cheek kiss.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d have cracked more jokes.
