Vinyl or digital?


I’ve got a collection of more than 1,000 LPs, but I surrendered to the 
accessibility of streaming services long ago.


What was the first record or cd you bought? 


Vanilla Ice’s To The Extreme <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE>. I 
was 10 and it was the only year of my life that I really listened to rap music. 
The famous samples in Ice Ice baby led me toQueen 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I>, who led me to Muse 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQifxaKch6s>, which led to me playing some of 
their songs inKings Place recently in London 
<http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/music/vivaldi-rocks-gut-strings-and-metal-with-omodernt-kammarorkester#.WA52raOiGhc>
.

What was the last piece of music (written or recorded) you bought? 

Jerusalem by Jordi Savall 
<http://www.allmusic.com/album/j%C3%A9rusalem-includes-book-mw0001415079/credits>
, a cd/book combination. I’m very inspired by his artistry of playing, and 
putting history and very specific performance practices of folkloric musicians 
from all over the world together.

What’s your musical guilty pleasure?

I easily feel guilty, but never when it comes to listening to music. In all 
the music I listen to I can easily find some sort of refinement; when it’s not 
in the the composition it’s usually the musician. The spontaneous blues 
ornaments that one of my favourite guitar players Danny Gatton plays inHarlem 
Nocturne <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_jmeU505GI> (and as I tried to copy 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2On6gVzsZs&feature=youtu.be>) can be much 
more interesting to listen to than anuninspiring performance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFmL74vTb0Y> of a high quality classical 
composition. Though I have to admitI love playing people to sleep 
<https://www.stadsschouwburgendevereeniging.nl/programma/2615/Bram_van_Sambeek_fagot_Navarra_String_Quartet/Hotel_De_Vereeniging_/>
 in the concert hall.

If you had six months free to learn a new instrument, what would it be?

Guitar, because of its natural affinity to different musical styles. But I 
would miss the extremely physical aspect of playing the bassoon.

What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert?

Musicians getting the opportunity, and taking the initiative, to play what 
they like to listen to. There are too many musicians walking around with hidden 
guilty pleasures that need to be shared in their own way of interpreting them.

If you had to pick one work to introduce someone to the wonders of classical 
music, what would it be?

Le Sacre du Printemps by Stravinsky. It has everything: variety of atmospheres 
and the pioneering creation of new influential styles; accessibility and also 
more inaccessible parts that sometimes require more active listening. And of 
course it has a very nice bassoon solo.

What or where is the most unusual place you’ve performed?

In a native Indian-style tipi in Peru improvising during an Ayahuasca 
<http://www.ayahuasca-info.com/introduction> ceremony. I was visiting my friend 
Dennis Notten <http://retreat.guru/teachers/1499/dennis-notten> who used to be 
the principal bassoonist in Radio Chamber Philharmonie of the Netherlands, but 
now has a more shamanic career.

What’s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member?

That’s hard to say because my listening experiences have always been the most 
intense while playing at the same time. It’s fantastic to be directly 
surrounded by all instruments: if you can let go a bit of your own 
contribution, it becomes an experience that gets really close to being an 
audience member. As a bassoonist, the easiest kind of music in which to let go 
of your own contribution is Bruckner’s – his bassoon parts are usually pretty 
empty. I always felt frustrated by that and thought I disliked Bruckner. But 
after leaving my regular symphony orchestra job and having more distance from 
orchestral playing in general I started to appreciate his music,especially the 
6th symphony <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdadCD7n1wY>, more as a listener 
than as a player.

We’re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, 
would you travel to?

The baroque period when Vivaldi was writing his epic 39 bassoon concertos. It 
would be great to finally unravel the mystery of which bassoonist Vivaldi wrote 
all these works for, and to experience a time that didn’t categorise music 
quite as much as we do nowadays. I just love the contrasts of the rocking 
qualities in his music mixed with the expression of so many more subtle 
emotions. I also like to believe that in those days composers and audiences 
felt freer to express their emotions, similar to the dance/rock/pop audiences 
do nowadays. Vivaldi’s music has the potential to bring all these slightly 
artificial categories together. That’s why I like to combine his music with my 
favourite hard rock songs as well.

What is the best new piece written in the past 50 years?

I find ranking in music too difficult. I do think though that many composers 
give their very best generally in opera – I really enjoyed playing for the 
premiere ofWritten on Skin <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUGc4tHzOc> by 
George Benjamin. But even closer to me would beSebastian Fagerlund’s bassoon 
concerto <http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/BIS/BIS2206>, which is about to be 
released on BIS records. For me it represents every possible fruitful new 
direction that contemporary music can take.

What’s the most overrated classical work? - ie is there a warhorse whose 
appeal you really don’t relate to?


Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition. It’s appealing to listen to for the 
first time, but it bored me surprisingly quickly after having to play it 30 
times on tour.

Which non-classical musician would you like to work with?

Matt Bellamy from Muse.

Imagine you’re a festival director with unlimited resources. What would you 
programme - or commission - for your opening event?

I actually was in that position for the last few years, although the unlimited 
resources failed to show up. It was called Liquid Music festival and I intended 
for the musicians to rise up (in live virtual reality) from the lake in front 
of theMuziekgebouw aan ’t IJ <https://www.muziekgebouw.nl/> while playing the 
ancientCanto de la Sibilla <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiBiEcxLqsY>.

It’s late, you’ve had a few beers, you’re in a Karaoke bar. What do you choose 
to sing?

It actually has to be extremely late, and an awful lot of beers, and then I 
would go for Uprising by Muse <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqPVz101nd0>.

Bram van Sambeek <http://bramvansambeek.com/>’s debut recording featuring 
concertos by Kalevi Aho and Sebastian Fagerlund is released on2 December on BIS 
<http://bis.se/performers/sambeek-bram-van/aho-fagerlund-bassoon>.
