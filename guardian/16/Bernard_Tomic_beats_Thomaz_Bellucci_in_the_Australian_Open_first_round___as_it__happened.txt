So, to recap, Bernie Tomic is through to a second-round encounter with Victor 
Estrella Burgos, who beat Britain’s Aljaz Bedene in four sets. That’s all from 
me, but switch over to Adam Collins’ liveblog of Andy Murray’s upcoming match 
against Illya Marchenko, which is about to start. Thanks for joining me, and 
bye for now.

Here’s Bernie: 

“Amazing thing to be back. I’m feeling good practising hard doing the right 
things. When you do the right things, good things happen on the court.

“Today I played very very well.”


When asked about his reported new diet, he said: “I don’t know why people have 
started this. It’s a compete mess. If I was a girl they wouldn’t do this.”

Game, set and match Tomic!

Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 Bellucci (*denotes server): There it is! A 
couple of aces (his 11th and 12th of the match) help Tomic to match point and 
his serve doesn’t let him down at that point. Tomic through into the second 
round with a minimum of fuss. Excellent stuff from the Australian.

Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 5-4* Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic finally 
breaks the run of service points won and he continues the momentum with a 
fantastic forehand winner, hit back across the face of Bellucci, who is left 
with no chance. It’s perfect timing really; he goes on to break and will now 
serve for the match.

Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 3-4 Bellucci* (*denotes server): These last four 
games have been won to love as both players’ resistance to serve wavers a 
little in the heat. That’s 16 points now that have been won by the server. And 
the tempo of the match has drastically reduced.

Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 3-3 Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic holds as the 
tension builds for Bellucci – he knows a slip now could well mean the end of 
the road for him.

that makes a liveblogger’s job tough – Tomic holds serve without incident, and 
with not even a crap chant from the stands to mock, that’s your lot.

Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 1-2 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Tomic’s radar is 
out slightly this game and a couple of heavy-handed baseline shots go long at 
the other end, helping Bellucci along the way.

Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 1-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): No problems for 
Tomic as he gets his name on the scoreboard this third set. “We love you 
Bernie, we do” cry the Fanatics. Really, their repertoire hasn’t changed in the 
past 10 years. Understandable if they’re keeping it simple so others can join 
in, but with no one else game in the entire arena, you have to ask questions.

Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1 0-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Wow, Tomic delivers 
some wonderful tennis this game – and a glimpse of what he is capable of. Yet 
Bellucci still manages to hold, after saving a couple of break points.

Amazing scenes over on Show Court 3, where Alex De Minaur has forced a final 
set against Gerald Melzer after a tie-breaker in the fourth!

Tomic wins the second set!

Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Well, after his last 
lengthy service game, this one is a cinch. Tomic wraps up the second in 
double-quick time, and remains well on course for a place in the second round 
of thisAustralian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>.

Second set: Tomic 6-2, 5-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Normal service is 
resumed, in more ways than one this next game. Bellucci falls to 0-40 and Tomic 
converts on the second break point to move to within a game of the second set. 
A chorus of “Let’s go Bernie” breaks out among the Fanatics in the stands, a 
chant that will never get old. Or annoying. Ever.

Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 4-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Well this is something 
of a strange game. Tomic eventually holds, but it’s far from plain sailing. He 
appears to lose his momentum and allows Bellucci a sniff of getting back into 
the set. In the end he has to save three break points, although it’s some tame 
play from Bellucci when it matters most that keeps Tomic in the game. On the 
second, he simply stands there as Tomic’s looped forehand lands on the 
baseline. A big serve from the Australian saves a third break point before an 
ace sets up the eventual hold. That could prove to be a big one for Tomic to 
have got through.

Second set: Tomic 6-2, 3-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Tomic edges a lengthy 
rally at 30-15 up when Bellucci goes wide (he challenges but to no avail), and 
the Australian is gifted two break points. Bellucci concedes on the first with 
a whimper, his forehand landing meekly in the net. Tomic now a set and a break 
up – and looking well set.

Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 2-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic, for the first 
time really, struggles slightly on his serve. He comes through though, not 
least because he pulls a superb winner out of the bag when being put under 
pressure from Bellucci. His forehand is ungettable and that’s a good hold for 
the Australian, but you can’t help feel a bit for Bellucci, who did his best to 
get his opponent running all over the court that game. Tomic’s shot-making was 
just too good in the end.

Second set: Tomic 6-2, 1-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Another game, another 
fantastic shot from Tomic, who runs around a Bellucci serve to slap a forehand 
winner back past the Brazilian. It’s not enough to deny Bellucci the game 
though, and we’re all square early in this second set.

Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 1-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic pulls out the 
shot of the match so far, a superb double-handed backhand winner down the line 
on his way to securing the first game of the second set. Cue a 
not-annoying-at-all solo version of the Beatles’ Let It Be, with lyrics 
tailored to Tomic, by a brave Australian man in the crowd. Incredibly, he gets 
a round of applause, although you have to think that was more for effort, 
rather than any songwriting or execution skills.

Tomic wins the first set!

First set: Tomic 6-2 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Oh dear, a double fault 
comes at a bad time for Bellucci and the Brazilian falls 0-30 down. Tomic 
manoeuvres his opponent around the court on the next point and sets up three 
set points. Bellucci saves the first, Tomic is long at the baseline on the 
second, and on the third, the Brazilian whips a super forehand that Tomic can’t 
return. Ballsy play from Bellucci. But Tomic soon gets a fourth chance though 
and this time he takes it, as Bellucci finds the net. Thirty-two minutes and 
Tomic is a set up!

First set: *Tomic 5-2 Bellucci (*denotes server): And more of the same from 
Tomic as he inches towards claiming the first set. No problems at all for the 
Queenslander in this game as his serve, um, serves him well. This has been a 
really solid start to his campaign so far.

First set: Tomic 3-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Bellucci pings down another 
ace early on, but the Brazilian is slightly error-prone with his ground strokes 
and this, coupled with some decent play from Tomic – and an element of luck – 
means he struggles to hold. A net cord at deuce gives the Australian a chance, 
but in true Tomic style, he attempts a sliced forehand dropshot to claim the 
game. It doesn’t come off. Bellucci relies on his serve to get him through and 
an ace seals the deal to finally get him on the board.

Over on Show Court 3, Alex De Minaur has dropped the third set to Gerald 
Melzer and must find a way to stay in his debut slam in this fourth set.

First set: *Tomic 3-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Eight minutes into the match 
and Tomic has opened up a 3-0 lead. He’s looking comfortable during this 
quickfire game, in which he encounters little resistance from Bellucci, largely 
thanks to his own shot selection.

First set: Tomic 2-0 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Bellucci is a grunter, not 
the loudest ever heard, but still a grunter. The Brazilian exhales loudly with 
every shot, in start contrast to Tomic, who manages to keep any noise down. 
Anyway, it’s been a great start for Tomic, who breaks at the first opportunity, 
despite Bellucci hammering down the first ace of the match. Tomic seals it when 
the Brazilian is a fraction long with a volley at the net, with Tomic unable to 
get near the ball.

First set: *Tomic 1-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Here we go then! Bellucci 
won the toss and elected to receive first so here goes Bernie. And the 
Australian gets off to an encouraging start, cajoling his opponent around the 
court on several points before sealing the game with a powerful serve that 
Bellucci cannot get back. Bellucci does however, give an indication of what 
he’s capable of, when at 30-0 down he counters with a frankly magnificent 
return, reaching across to fire a forehand back across Tomic. A high quality 
first game.

Tomic and Bellucci are out on court and warming up. Tomic is in a seemingly 
conservative outfit (white shirt and shorts with black detail), until you look 
down to his feet. They are ensconced in a pair of bright pink trainers with 
yellow soles, matched with bright pink socks. Bellucci is in an eye-catching 
flouro yellow and black shirt with black shorts. And with that, thankfully 
fashion is done for the day.

Four-times Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> 
champion Venus Williams is out on court and under way in her match against 
Ukraine’s Kateryna Kozlova. Early in the first set the American is a break 
down, but there’s no doubting her enduring popularity at Melbourne Park.

Some interesting reading on the ATP’s website 
<http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/thomaz-bellucci-vs-bernard-tomic/BD20/TA46>
 about these two players. There’s five years difference in age between the pair 
but very little in terms of career prize money. Tomic (24) has earned 
$4,780,593 while Bellucci (29) has $4,690,882 to his name. I say very little, 
because what’s the odd 90K between tennis players? Anyway, you’ve got to love 
the detail, right down to the last dollar.

Tomic and Bellucci will be on court soon as Muguruza has wrapped up victory 
over Erakovic. The Spaniard wins 7-5, 6-4 in one hour and 38 minutes on 
Margaret Court Arena to progress to the second round, and the day is well under 
way now. Plenty more to come, so stick with us.

I forgot to say, but please do get in touch, on email 
<mailto:mike.hytner@theguardian.com>, or via Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/mike_hytner>. Is this Tomic’s year to go beyond his 
previous best result of reaching the fourth round at Melbourne Park? Or will it 
all end in tears?

Over on Hisense Arena, my least favourite of the main show courts for what 
it’s worth, Kei Nishikori dropped the first set to Andrei Kuznetsov but the 
Japanese has roared back in the second to level at a set apiece. Australia’s 
Ashleigh Barty follows that one, in her comeback to grand slam tennis after a 
stint playing cricket.

Aiava’s debut Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is over! Mona Barthel wraps 
up victory in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), in a result that won’t surprise 
many. Nevertheless, Destanee gets a rousing ovation from the stands as she 
departs, and she can move into the future with the experience of a grand slam 
appearance under her belt. Definitely a case of ‘watch this space’ for the 
young Melburnian.

Weather update

The sun is out in Melbourne, and the mercury is rising. A high of 31 degrees 
is expected today, but of course down there on the court, it can feel far 
hotter than that for the players.

Around the courts

That match on Margaret Court between Erakovic and Muguruza is currently in the 
second set, with the Spaniard – despite being clearly unwell – having taken the 
first. She was a break down in the second, but has just got back onto serve at 
3-4 and is still a chance of wrapping this up in straight sets.

And we have our first shock of the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, with fourth seeded 
Romanian Simona Halep bundled out of the tournament by American Shelby Rogers, 
a stunning 6-3, 6-1 winner first up on Rod Laver Arena.

Elsewhere, Australia’s next big thing, Destanee Aiava, is locked in battle in 
a second set tie-break against Mona Barthel of Germany, having lost the first 
6-3. More on that in a tick.

Another bright young Australian prospect, Alex De Minaur, is currently a set 
and 4-3 down to Gerald Melzer of Austria.

Preamble

So, here we go once again. The Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> 2016 is under way and one 
of our first chances to run the rule over the local talent on the sun-bathed 
blue courts of Melbourne Park comes with a match that pits Bernard Tomic, 
seeded 27, against Brazil’s world No62 Thomaz Bellucci.

In some ways, it’s as an intriguing encounter as a first-round clash can be – 
rankings suggest Tomicshould have few problems in dispatching Bellucci, but of 
course there is far more to it than that. For starters, it’s Bernard Tomic

match this year following adisappointing outing in Brisbane

 andtwo defeats in Kooyong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/11/bernard-tomic-upbeat-despite-defeat-in-kooyong-opener>
. Bernard Tomic, who is about as predictable asthe guest list for Donald 
Trump’s inauguration ceremony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/16/would-you-believe-it-pauline-hanson-ponders-invite-to-trump-inauguration>
. And the Bernard Tomic who delights when in the mood, and frustrates when not.

Then there is Bellucci, by no means a walkover and a very real potential 
banana skin. The pair have met three times before, most recently at Shenzhen in 
China last year, where the Brazilian won 6-2, 6-2. He now holds a 2-1 advantage 
over Tomic following a win in Stuttgart in 2012. Victory for the Australian at 
the 2013 Indian Wells Masters tournament is the meat in this particular results 
sandwich.

So which Tomic will we see today? Honestly, I’ve no idea and you’re  a fool  a 
better person than me if you think you can predict this one. Anyway, we’re 
about to find out soon enough. The match is scheduled second up on Margaret 
Court Arena, after Kiwi player Marina Erakovic and women’s seventh seed Garbiñe 
Muguruza are done and dusted.

So, to recap, Bernie Tomic is through to a second-round encounter with Victor 
Estrella Burgos, who beat Britain’s Aljaz Bedene in four sets. That’s all from 
me, but switch over to Adam Collins’ liveblog of Andy Murray’s upcoming match 
against Illya Marchenko, which is about to start. Thanks for joining me, and 
bye for now.

And in other good news for Australia, young gun Alex De Minaur has won his 
first-round encounter with Gerald Melzer in five sets. A stunning result for 
the Spain-based 17-year-old Sydneysider!

Here’s Bernie: 

“Amazing thing to be back. I’m feeling good practising hard doing the right 
things. When you do the right things, good things happen on the court.

“Today I played very very well.”


When asked about his reported new diet, he said: “I don’t know why people have 
started this. It’s a compete mess. If I was a girl they wouldn’t do this.”
 
Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 Bellucci (*denotes server): There it is! A 
couple of aces (his 11th and 12th of the match) help Tomic to match point and 
his serve doesn’t let him down at that point. Tomic through into the second 
round with a minimum of fuss. Excellent stuff from the Australian.

 
Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 5-4* Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic finally 
breaks the run of service points won and he continues the momentum with a 
fantastic forehand winner, hit back across the face of Bellucci, who is left 
with no chance. It’s perfect timing really; he goes on to break and will now 
serve for the match.
 
Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 4-4 Bellucci (*denotes server): Make that 20 
points in a row. Looks like the rising temperature is getting to the players 
now.
 
Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 3-4 Bellucci* (*denotes server): These last four 
games have been won to love as both players’ resistance to serve wavers a 
little in the heat. That’s 16 points now that have been won by the server. And 
the tempo of the match has drastically reduced.
 
Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 3-3 Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic holds as the 
tension builds for Bellucci – he knows a slip now could well mean the end of 
the road for him.
 
Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 2-3 Bellucci* (*denotes server): And another! So 
perhaps this is as good a time as any for some stats.

First serve percentage: Tomic 63-77 Bellucci
Winners: Tomic 8-8 Bellucci
Total points won 25-16 Bellucci
 
Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 2-2 Bellucci (*denotes server): One of those games 
that makes a liveblogger’s job tough – Tomic holds serve without incident, and 
with not even a crap chant from the stands to mock, that’s your lot.
 
Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 1-2 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Tomic’s radar is 
out slightly this game and a couple of heavy-handed baseline shots go long at 
the other end, helping Bellucci along the way.
 
Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 1-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): No problems for 
Tomic as he gets his name on the scoreboard this third set. “We love you 
Bernie, we do” cry the Fanatics. Really, their repertoire hasn’t changed in the 
past 10 years. Understandable if they’re keeping it simple so others can join 
in, but with no one else game in the entire arena, you have to ask questions.
 
Third set: Tomic 6-2, 6-1 0-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Wow, Tomic delivers 
some wonderful tennis this game – and a glimpse of what he is capable of. Yet 
Bellucci still manages to hold, after saving a couple of break points.

set against Gerald Melzer after a tie-breaker in the fourth!

Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Well, after his last 
lengthy service game, this one is a cinch. Tomic wraps up the second in 
double-quick time, and remains well on course for a place in the second round 
of thisAustralian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>.
 
Second set: Tomic 6-2, 5-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Normal service is 
resumed, in more ways than one this next game. Bellucci falls to 0-40 and Tomic 
converts on the second break point to move to within a game of the second set. 
A chorus of “Let’s go Bernie” breaks out among the Fanatics in the stands, a 
chant that will never get old. Or annoying. Ever.
 
Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 4-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Well this is something 
of a strange game. Tomic eventually holds, but it’s far from plain sailing. He 
appears to lose his momentum and allows Bellucci a sniff of getting back into 
the set. In the end he has to save three break points, although it’s some tame 
play from Bellucci when it matters most that keeps Tomic in the game. On the 
second, he simply stands there as Tomic’s looped forehand lands on the 
baseline. A big serve from the Australian saves a third break point before an 
ace sets up the eventual hold. That could prove to be a big one for Tomic to 
have got through.
 
Second set: Tomic 6-2, 3-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Tomic edges a lengthy 
rally at 30-15 up when Bellucci goes wide (he challenges but to no avail), and 
the Australian is gifted two break points. Bellucci concedes on the first with 
a whimper, his forehand landing meekly in the net. Tomic now a set and a break 
up – and looking well set.
 
Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 2-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic, for the first 
time really, struggles slightly on his serve. He comes through though, not 
least because he pulls a superb winner out of the bag when being put under 
pressure from Bellucci. His forehand is ungettable and that’s a good hold for 
the Australian, but you can’t help feel a bit for Bellucci, who did his best to 
get his opponent running all over the court that game. Tomic’s shot-making was 
just too good in the end.
 
Second set: Tomic 6-2, 1-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Another game, another 
fantastic shot from Tomic, who runs around a Bellucci serve to slap a forehand 
winner back past the Brazilian. It’s not enough to deny Bellucci the game 
though, and we’re all square early in this second set.
 
Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 1-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic pulls out the 
shot of the match so far, a superb double-handed backhand winner down the line 
on his way to securing the first game of the second set. Cue a 
not-annoying-at-all solo version of the Beatles’ Let It Be, with lyrics 
tailored to Tomic, by a brave Australian man in the crowd. Incredibly, he gets 
a round of applause, although you have to think that was more for effort, 
rather than any songwriting or execution skills.
 
First set: Tomic 6-2 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Oh dear, a double fault 
comes at a bad time for Bellucci and the Brazilian falls 0-30 down. Tomic 
manoeuvres his opponent around the court on the next point and sets up three 
set points. Bellucci saves the first, Tomic is long at the baseline on the 
second, and on the third, the Brazilian whips a super forehand that Tomic can’t 
return. Ballsy play from Bellucci. But Tomic soon gets a fourth chance though 
and this time he takes it, as Bellucci finds the net. Thirty-two minutes and 
Tomic is a set up!

Brazil’s Thomaz Bellucci. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters  
First set: *Tomic 5-2 Bellucci (*denotes server): And more of the same from 
Tomic as he inches towards claiming the first set. No problems at all for the 
Queenslander in this game as his serve, um, serves him well. This has been a 
really solid start to his campaign so far.
 
First set: Tomic 4-2 Bellucci* (*denotes server): A light smattering of 
applause signals a held service game for Bellucci. You get the feeling half the 
crowd didn’t even see that game, such was its brevity.

Images  
First set: *Tomic 4-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): No such messing about in 
this next game, as Tomic races to another game without fuss. This is good stuff 
from the Australian. Now to maintain this level for the next hour and a half.
 
First set: Tomic 3-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Bellucci pings down another 
ace early on, but the Brazilian is slightly error-prone with his ground strokes 
and this, coupled with some decent play from Tomic – and an element of luck – 
means he struggles to hold. A net cord at deuce gives the Australian a chance, 
but in true Tomic style, he attempts a sliced forehand dropshot to claim the 
game. It doesn’t come off. Bellucci relies on his serve to get him through and 
an ace seals the deal to finally get him on the board.

Over on Show Court 3, Alex De Minaur has dropped the third set to Gerald 
Melzer and must find a way to stay in his debut slam in this fourth set.

 
First set: *Tomic 3-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Eight minutes into the match 
and Tomic has opened up a 3-0 lead. He’s looking comfortable during this 
quickfire game, in which he encounters little resistance from Bellucci, largely 
thanks to his own shot selection.
 
First set: Tomic 2-0 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Bellucci is a grunter, not 
the loudest ever heard, but still a grunter. The Brazilian exhales loudly with 
every shot, in start contrast to Tomic, who manages to keep any noise down. 
Anyway, it’s been a great start for Tomic, who breaks at the first opportunity, 
despite Bellucci hammering down the first ace of the match. Tomic seals it when 
the Brazilian is a fraction long with a volley at the net, with Tomic unable to 
get near the ball.
 
First set: *Tomic 1-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Here we go then! Bellucci 
won the toss and elected to receive first so here goes Bernie. And the 
Australian gets off to an encouraging start, cajoling his opponent around the 
court on several points before sealing the game with a powerful serve that 
Bellucci cannot get back. Bellucci does however, give an indication of what 
he’s capable of, when at 30-0 down he counters with a frankly magnificent 
return, reaching across to fire a forehand back across Tomic. A high quality 
first game.
 
Tomic and Bellucci are out on court and warming up. Tomic is in a seemingly 
conservative outfit (white shirt and shorts with black detail), until you look 
down to his feet. They are ensconced in a pair of bright pink trainers with 
yellow soles, matched with bright pink socks. Bellucci is in an eye-catching 
flouro yellow and black shirt with black shorts. And with that, thankfully 
fashion is done for the day.

Some interesting reading on the ATP’s website 
<http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/thomaz-bellucci-vs-bernard-tomic/BD20/TA46>
 about these two players. There’s five years difference in age between the pair 
but very little in terms of career prize money. Tomic (24) has earned 
$4,780,593 while Bellucci (29) has $4,690,882 to his name. I say very little, 
because what’s the odd 90K between tennis players? Anyway, you’ve got to love 
the detail, right down to the last dollar.
 
Tomic and Bellucci will be on court soon as Muguruza has wrapped up victory 
over Erakovic. The Spaniard wins 7-5, 6-4 in one hour and 38 minutes on 
Margaret Court Arena to progress to the second round, and the day is well under 
way now. Plenty more to come, so stick with us.

I forgot to say, but please do get in touch, on email 
<mailto:mike.hytner@theguardian.com>, or via Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/mike_hytner>. Is this Tomic’s year to go beyond his 
previous best result of reaching the fourth round at Melbourne Park? Or will it 
all end in tears?
 
Over on Hisense Arena, my least favourite of the main show courts for what 
it’s worth, Kei Nishikori dropped the first set to Andrei Kuznetsov but the 
Japanese has roared back in the second to level at a set apiece. Australia’s 
Ashleigh Barty follows that one, in her comeback to grand slam tennis after a 
stint playing cricket.

Aiava’s debut Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is over! Mona Barthel wraps 
up victory in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), in a result that won’t surprise 
many. Nevertheless, Destanee gets a rousing ovation from the stands as she 
departs, and she can move into the future with the experience of a grand slam 
appearance under her belt. Definitely a case of ‘watch this space’ for the 
young Melburnian.
 
The sun is out in Melbourne, and the mercury is rising. A high of 31 degrees 
is expected today, but of course down there on the court, it can feel far 
hotter than that for the players.
 
That match on Margaret Court between Erakovic and Muguruza is currently in the 
second set, with the Spaniard – despite being clearly unwell – having taken the 
first. She was a break down in the second, but has just got back onto serve at 
3-4 and is still a chance of wrapping this up in straight sets.

And we have our first shock of the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, with fourth seeded 
Romanian Simona Halep bundled out of the tournament by American Shelby Rogers, 
a stunning 6-3, 6-1 winner first up on Rod Laver Arena.

Elsewhere, Australia’s next big thing, Destanee Aiava, is locked in battle in 
a second set tie-break against Mona Barthel of Germany, having lost the first 
6-3. More on that in a tick.

Another bright young Australian prospect, Alex De Minaur, is currently a set 
and 4-3 down to Gerald Melzer of Austria.
 
So, here we go once again. The Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> 2016 is under way and one 
of our first chances to run the rule over the local talent on the sun-bathed 
blue courts of Melbourne Park comes with a match that pits Bernard Tomic, 
seeded 27, against Brazil’s world No62 Thomaz Bellucci.

In some ways, it’s as an intriguing encounter as a first-round clash can be – 
rankings suggest Tomicshould have few problems in dispatching Bellucci, but of 
course there is far more to it than that. For starters, it’s Bernard Tomic 
we’re talking about, the same Bernard Tomic who has failed to win a competitive 
match this year following adisappointing outing in Brisbane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/bernard-tomic-crashes-out-of-brisbane-international-in-opening-round>
 andtwo defeats in Kooyong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/11/bernard-tomic-upbeat-despite-defeat-in-kooyong-opener>
. Bernard Tomic, who is about as predictable asthe guest list for Donald 
Trump’s inauguration ceremony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/16/would-you-believe-it-pauline-hanson-ponders-invite-to-trump-inauguration>
. And the Bernard Tomic who delights when in the mood, and frustrates when not.

Then there is Bellucci, by no means a walkover and a very real potential 
banana skin. The pair have met three times before, most recently at Shenzhen in 
China last year, where the Brazilian won 6-2, 6-2. He now holds a 2-1 advantage 
over Tomic following a win in Stuttgart in 2012. Victory for the Australian at 
the 2013 Indian Wells Masters tournament is the meat in this particular results 
sandwich.

So which Tomic will we see today? Honestly, I’ve no idea and you’re  a fool  a 
better person than me if you think you can predict this one. Anyway, we’re 
about to find out soon enough. The match is scheduled second up on Margaret 
Court Arena, after Kiwi player Marina Erakovic and women’s seventh seed Garbiñe 
Muguruza are done and dusted.
 
Mike will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Russell Jackson with his
