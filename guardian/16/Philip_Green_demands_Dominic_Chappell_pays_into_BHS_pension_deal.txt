Sir Philip Green wants the Pensions Regulator to force Dominic Chappell, the 
former owner of BHS, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/dominic-chappell-bled-bhs-dry-says-paul-sutton>
 to put money into the failed retailer’s pension fund as part of any settlement 
to resolve the £571m deficit in the scheme.

Green has made a payment into the scheme from Chappell or his company Retail 
Acquisitions a condition of any rescue deal, according to sources close to 
negotiations.

BHS collapsed into administration in April, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/28/frank-field-accuses-sir-philip-green-of-asset-stripping-bhs>
 leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a £571m pension black hole. The 
demise of the 88-year-old retailer sparked a public and political outcry 
because Green and Chappell, the former owners, made millions from the business.

Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt, 
for £1. During his ownership,the Green family and other shareholders collected 
at least £580m from BHS.

 Chappell’s companyRetail Acquisitions received payments of up to £25m from BHS 
despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed.

Green promised to “sort” the problems facing the BHS pension scheme in June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/bhs-pension-problems-can-be-solved-sir-philip-green-tells-mps>
 when he appeared in front of a parliamentary committee, but no deal has been 
forthcoming. The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green 
and Chappell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme>
 in an attempt to force them to fill the deficit. It is understood to be 
seeking around £350m from Green and as much as £17m from Chappell.

However, a source close to the situation confirmed that negotiations have 
taken place between Green and the regulator since it initiated legal action in 
November. Those involved in the talks believe asettlement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/16/pensions-regulator-bhs-coats-group-legal-proceedings>
 could be agreed early in the new year, before the regulator proceeds to the 
next stage.

As part of any deal, it is understood that Green wants the regulator to ensure 
that Chappell pays into the pension scheme as well.The billionaire tycoon 
believes he was misled by Chappell about his track record in business 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/philip-green-threatens-to-sue-bhs-buyer-dominic-chappell>
 and the money that Retail Acquisitions was paid by BHS.

Green declined to comment. Chappell told the Guardian that he fulfilled all 
his duties as a director of BHS and “at no stage did we trade immorally”. He 
blamed Green for the collapse of BHS because of his failure to support the 
pension scheme after he sold the retail chain. Chappell said he had agreed a 
“deal in principle” with the regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the 
government-backed lifeboat scheme, to restructure the pension fund before BHS 
collapsed. This involved Green pumping in £127m,BHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs> making annual contributions for the 
next five years, and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) taking a 30% stake in 
the retailer. However, Green did not agree to the proposal, according to 
Chappell.

The former owner of BHS also criticised the conduct of the Pensions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/pensions> Regulator, saying that the 
retailer was “screwed” by the investigation into the pension scheme shortly 
after it was sold by Green. This prevented Retail Acquisitions hiring a top 
chief executive and affected its finances, Chappell said.

“A big notice to them, why don’t they look themselves in the mirror and look 
at how they behaved through the whole process?”

A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: “We have issued warning 
notices setting out evidence for use of our contribution notice power and our 
financial support direction power, to a number of parties includingSir Philip 
Green <https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green>.

“The warning notice is an important milestone in our work to obtain redress 
for the thousands of members of the BHS schemes who have been placed in this 
position through no fault of their own.

“Those who have received the warning notices now have the right to make 
representations to us, which we will consider and respond. At that stage, if we 
decide to progress the case, it will be heard by our determinations panel, 
which is independent of the case team and will determine whether to exercise 
the powers in this case. We cannot give specific timeframes but we would expect 
a panel hearing during 2017.

“We remain in discussion with Sir Philip’s advisers. Any settlement offer we 
accept has to be robust enough to stand the test of time and mean that members 
and the PPF are not left in a worse position further down the road.”

Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the PPF, added: “The BHS pension schemes 
remain in the PPF assessment period, and members continue to be protected and 
paid at PPF levels of compensation.

“This means members who were retired when we started looking at the schemes 
will continue to receive 100% of what was in payment, while members who retired 
since then will receive 90% of what they were promised, subject to a cap.

“We are working closely with the BHS pension trustees who continue to 
administer the schemes. Meanwhile the liquidator is now working to maximise the 
recovery to the pension schemes.”
