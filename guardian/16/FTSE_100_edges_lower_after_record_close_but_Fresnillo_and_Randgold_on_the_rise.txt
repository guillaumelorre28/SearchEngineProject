Leading shares are struggling for direction after Wednesday’s achievement of a 
new closing high.

In thin trading, the FTSE 100 is currently down 5.01 points at 7101.07. But 
continuing strength in the gold and silver price - with the former at a two 
week high as the dollar edged lower - has pushed precious metal miners to the 
fore. Mexico’sFresnillo is up 26p at £11.96 and Randgold Resources has risen 
85p to £62.05. Lower down the marketHochshild is 9.8p higher at 207p and 
Polymetal International has put on 22p to 852p. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior 
market analyst at London Capital Group, said:

Softer US yields and broad based US dollar depreciation remain supportive of a 
further rise above the $1150/oz resistance, hence gold miners have further room 
to outperform their peers at today’s session.

However with base metals slipping back, other miners are heading lower after 
Wednesday’s gains.Glencore is down 2.65p at 274.25p while BHP Billiton is 11p 
lower at 1300.5p.

Also among the fallers are a handful of companies going ex-dividend including 
BT, down 2.25p at 365.8p, Dixons Carphone, 1.8p lower at 350.9p and Experian, 
off 8p at £15.65.

Banks are under pressure on continuing concerns about further regulatory 
action following a report that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is 
investigating bonds issued in Mozambique by Credit Suisse, VTB of Russia and 
BNP Paribas.

The uncertainty over the fate of Italy’s Monte dei Pashi is also knocking 
sentiment in the sector.
