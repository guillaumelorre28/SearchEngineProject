With murder rates double, and robbery rates three times, the state average, 
the Sydney suburb of Blacktown is not an obvious choice as a world leader of 
sustainable living.

But, in 2016, a new master-planned estate in the suburb became the first 
residential community in New South Wales to be awarded a top, six-star Green 
Star community rating by the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA).

Driverless buses arrive in Australia: smart and green but what now for drivers?

Not only that, Fairwater <http://www.frasersproperty.com.au/NSW/Fairwater>, 
developed by Frasers Property, is thelargest geothermal community 
<http://qpsgeothermal.com.au/project/fairwater/> in the southern hemisphere. 
Houses are cooled or heated by a refrigerant that pumps air underground then 
back to the surface, using less power than air-conditioning or heating and 
saving residents of a three-bedroom house $500 to $600 a year.

“There’s this avenue of mature trees with this massive lake and lovely terrace 
houses – yoga by the lake, cycling paths, all these people walking,” says the 
GBCA chief executive, Romilly Madew. “If I said ‘Blacktown’ that’s not the 
image that would have come to your mind. It’s all about healthy and active 
living.”

Green-star buildings produce, on average, 62% fewer greenhouse gas emissions 
and use 51% less potable water and 66% less electricity than average buildings 
in Australia, according to GBCA’s 2013 reportThe Value of the Green Star.

Since launching in 2003, hundreds of buildings around the country have been 
certified for the rating system and 120,000 people are now moving into Green 
Star communities. Out of 46 registered Green Star communities projects, 26 are 
already certified. Yet only 16 so far have attained the gold standard of six 
stars. So how do communities achieve the accolade?

The key is looking at the project holistically, says Madew. “It’s about going 
back to that old adage of community: people, walkability, liveability, places 
for the kids to play. [We want to] change the way people think about how they 
live.”

Developers, ultimately, “are there to sell house and land packages – so 
they’re not going to be successful unless they’re building something people 
want to buy. Take ‘sustainability’ out and ask what [buyers] want. They want 
something close to amenities – schools, public transport, shops and parks. And 
a home that is cheap to run.”

Can Indigenous culture ever coexist with urban planning?

Jessica Stewart, sustainability manager at Ginninderry, which is located in 
the ACT and is the latest community to achieve a six-star rating in September 
last year, has seen a significant shift in sustainable thinking.

“Creating a sustainable community is about creating behavioural change just as 
much as it’s about using the right materials, designing better roadways etc. A 
community is only as good as the people who live there.”

Straddling the Murrumbidgee River and Ginninderra Creek, Ginninderry is 
leading the way in water sensitive urban design, using a network of wetlands, 
basins and bioretention swales to “capture, cleanse, recycle and infiltrate” 
water on site.

Meanwhile solar panels on all houses in the community, jointly developed by 
the ACT government and Riverview Developments, are mandatory; a third of the 
site is reserved as a conservation corridor; andSpark 
<http://ginninderry.com/about/training-employment/view-programs/>, a social 
initiative project, will provide local employment opportunities (contractors on 
site, for example, must hire a certain number of residents from the area).

Five elements are assessed to achieve a six-star rating: governance, 
liveability, economic prosperity, environment, and innovation.

Within these, innovation, as Fairwater and Ginninderry have demonstrated, is 
critical. Fairwater’s geothermal technology was an industry first. But 
developers also made sure that it was used to create jobs, partnering with 
Australian companies QPS Geothermal and Actron Air to design, manufacture and 
install components using largely local labour.

Fairwater is not alone. Last year Lendlease and LandCorp’s Alkimos 
<http://communities.lendlease.com/alkimos-beach/>, a 710-hectare master-planned 
community in Perth, which is due to deliver 2,000 homes for 6,000 residents, 
became the first in the country to receive a six-star rating. Crucial is a 
$6.9m residential battery storage trial, in which more than 100 homes will be 
connected to a 1.1MWh solar energy storage system, lowering demand from the 
grid.

Open space is measured, as is access to public transport and employment 
opportunities. Alkimos, when completed, will have 3.6ha of playing fields, 6ha 
of conservation reserves and 41ha of foreshore reserves. Each home will be 
located within 800m of transport links and 200m from a park. Compulsory solar 
panels, meanwhile, are expected to reduce energy bills by up to 50%.

Despite this, “community initiatives are just as important as the physical 
ones”, says Lendlease’s managing director of communities, Matthew Wallace. One 
example is the Sprout Hub, a social enterprise café-cum-co-working space, 
designed to encourage new local businesses. In Fairwater, meanwhile, residents 
can use the free Live Life Get Active fitness camp (offering classes and 
nutrition plans), as well as the multitude of cycling paths and walking trails.

Developers see such community enterprises as a point of difference that will 
attract buyers. “More people are taking a greater interest in living a 
sustainable lifestyle,” says Paolo Bevilacqua, the general manager of 
sustainability at Frasers Property Australia. “So there are marketing 
advantages.”

There are challenges, however, too – not least due to the sheer size and vast 
time scales of these communities. Ginninderry, for one, plans to deliver 11,500 
new homes by 2055.

“What will car use look like in 40 years?” asks Stewart. “What do people do as 
work, how do they live, how do they interact together? All those things can 
change.”

In order to avoid complacency – and to make sure that promises are delivered – 
projects must re-certify every five years. Most important in achieving a 
six-star rating is starting the process in the planning phase, ensuring that 
everyone from stakeholders to construction firms know what is required. As 
Bevilacqua says, “It cannot be an afterthought.”
