What a victory

Andreas Seppi is talking to Jim Courier now. How did he do it? “Maybe it was 
meant to be. It’s as good a theory as any to explain Kyrgios perplexing 
stumble, from two sets to love up, and pounding his first serve well into the 
third. Before deciding to start an ongoing stoush with his coaches box.


The forehand down the line to win? “It was a big shot at an important moment.” 
Too right. As I said before, a lot will be (rightly) made of what happened with 
Kyrgios tonight, but Seppi had every right to give it away after that second 
set tie-break. Blown off the court, two sets down. All the hard work of that 
set counting for nothing.

But he kept with it. The foundation was laid in the early games of that third 
set where his serving, far from falling away from the high standards of the 
second set, got better again. When Kyrgios couldn’t break through, the 
capitulation began. First the altercation with the box. Then the break. Then 
the broken racquet. Then the code violation. Then the set.

The fourth? Much the same, as the Australian looked uninterested at best after 
losing his first service game. Generously, it could be said he was preserving 
energy for the deciding set. But that really is being generous given the body 
language that complemented the shot selection.

 As the fifth set got deeper and deeper, Kyrgios looked the more likely to 
prevail, even after allowing Seppi to once serve for the set at 5-4. He 
regained patience. Started making first serves again with far greater 
regularity. Nabbed some cheap points, even some cheap service games. But he 
never got the second break.

He came tremendously close, at 7-8, even getting a match point. But Seppi 
again clung on. Next game? He broke the Australian. He then served it out. He 
wasn’t going to let that opportunity pass him by a second time, not after 
losing to his opponent at the same tournament - and same court - after being 
two sets up.

And that’s gotta be it. An enthralling night of tennis. A fascinating 
Australian; the best and worst of him all within those three and a half hours. 
You can only hope he’ll be better for it. A gutsy Italian, who earned his third 
round spot times over. Hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for your company.

ANDREAS SEPPI DEFEATS NICK KYRGIOS 10-8 IN THE FIFTH!

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 8-10 Seppi* (*denotes server). At 
15-all Kyrgios misseD his forehand, hitting the frame and travelling deep into 
the crowd. At this point, he knew. Or he looked resigned to it at least. A 
Seppi ace did the rest. What a proud victory. I’ll be back in a moment to try 
and make sense of the mayhem that has been the last three and half hours.

Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 8-9 Seppi (*denotes server). For the 
second timeSEPPI WILL SERVE FOR THE MATCH. His first serve eluding him in that 
crucial service game, coming after the drama of a broken string, Kyrgios had a 
shocker. In keeping with that messy theme: he gave away the break with a double 
fault. Maybe it wasn’t destined to be so?

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 8-8 Seppi* (*denotes server). How do 
you adequately describe that? Seppi winners, net cords, a double fault, winners 
from Kyrgios after forcing the Italian deep into the court with utmost 
discipline. Big serves after a match point, following the long rally to deny 
the victory for the 14th seed. You want more? Grab it on youtube later. In 
short: utterly ridiculous. Want to go behind the fourth wall? I’d already 
written two pars wrapping up the game assuming Kyrgios had it. Should have 
known better. Was never going to be that easy.

Fifth set:Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 7-7 Seppi* (*denotes server). Oh where 
was that fluent serve when he was serving for the match? They’re saying it on 
TV, people are saying on twitter, it’s what’s people are saying in living rooms 
from coast to coast, whether they love Our Nick or hate him. That was a 
tremendous service game under pressure from the Italian, who has been utterly 
superb in sticking fat when lesser players would have capitulated, knowing he 
just had to stay with Kyrgios. He did. He created this opportunity as much as 
the Australian, who now serves at 7-all, has blown it. Or maybe not. It’s that 
kind of match. All will be forgiven (well, maybe not all) if he just can find a 
way to get it together for ten more minutes. The pressure sits with him.

Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 7-6 Seppi (*denotes server). Oh how 
Seppi may live to hurt over the opportunity he just threw away to serve this 
game out. The Australian holds at 6-all, to love. Just like it was in the good 
old says, when Kyrgios had this under control, when he was smiling, when he was 
urging the ball to do what he wanted, when he was winding up big. None of that, 
now. The ace win the game is emphatic, though. The Italian, unbelievably 
almost, now the one serving to stay in the match.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 6-6 Seppi* (*denotes server). Kyrgios 
BREAKS BACK!!!!!What is going on? Defending to stay in the tournament and 
Kyrgios has rolled a mid-rally between the legs effort. Somehow it lands, he 
wins the point. Then, showing patience that belies the earlier shot, hangs 
tough in a rally to convert that to 15-40. And an unforced error from Seppi - 
so rare from him of late - puts the two back on parity. Of course, no tie break 
in the fifth, so this could go a while. Exhausting tennis.

Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 5-6 Seppi (*denotes server). That is 
HUGE from Seppi, getting himself a couple of break points and converting at 
30-40 with a forehand he just reached, the going back at double-speed to 
Kyrgios, who lets it go. But it isn’t long!The Italian now gets his chance to 
serve for the match!Earlier in the game at the net together at 0-15 and Kyrgios 
missed, coming after a double fault as well, and he’s down to 0-30. A forehand 
missed makes that 15-40 shortly thereafter. But he finds a huge serve, 206kph, 
to get out of the first one, but not the second.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 5-5 Seppi* (*denotes server). An error 
opens up 0-15 for Kyrgios, and he’s well in the excellent rally that follows, 
but given a chance to take a swipe crosscourt with a forehand, he just misses. 
The game slips away quickly after the Italian steps up under pressure. Again. 
So much about the Australian’s night, but Seppi has been absolutely outstanding 
in the toughest moments tonight. Fair play.

Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 5-4 Seppi (*denotes server). “Your 
idea as well,” roars Kyrgios at his box after losing a point at 30-0. What’s he 
do next? Serves it out. Huge ace down the middle at 40-15. It’s like the 
Australian is at once preparing to win this game and also savage someone - 
everyone - in the post-loss press conference. These emotions fluctuating not 
only game to game, but almost point to point. You can’t look away from this 
bloke. Seppi, now, to serve to stay in the match. “I’ve never looked forward 
more to a post-match interview from Jim Courier,” says the TV host. Not wrong.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 4-4 Seppi* (*denotes server). So cool 
from Seppi! Kyrgios opened up this match for the taking with some superb rally 
patience - sorely missing for so long - to get it out to 0-30. Then a a 
blistering winner to a limp second serve give him three break points. The 
Italian responded with five points on the bounce to take the game at the first 
deuce. Wow. From serving for the match if he converts any of those the 
Australian, to now the pressure lumped right back on him after the missed 
opportunities.

Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 4-3 Seppi (*denotes server). To 
30-love when Seppi cannot return another Kyrgios bullet from the service line. 
Another big serve is returned long, then another sprays wide. Okay, he’s back 
in business? In between times, he encouraged Seppi to review a line-call that 
went the way of the Australian. All happening.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 3-3 Seppi* (*denotes server). A rapid 
crosscourt backhand winner returning serve gets Kyrgios to 15-all and a chance. 
The a net cord goes the way of the Italian! The crowd boo. “I’ve never heard 
the net-cord get booed before,” says Jim Courier. “It’s our Grand Slam” 
responds Lleyton. Strong. From here, Seppi holds with relative ease, landing 
his first serves at 30-15 and 40-15.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 3-2 Seppi* (*denotes server). Kyrgios 
holds to love! There’s something that wouldn’t have rated a mention in the 
second or third sets a these two did that with regularity, especially the 
Australian. So, a good sign. A pair of aces in the middle of game can only 
help. The crowd are certainly with him here.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 2-2 Seppi* (*denotes server). A chance 
created to start here, Seppi into the net after Kyrgios pushed him deep into 
the court. But the good work is undone at 15-all when he chances his hand at 
another low percentage backhand down the line. The evidence of the opening sets 
of this game would be that he just doesn’t need to do that; the Australian was 
winning pretty much every lengthy rally. And it happens again as Seppi serves, 
Kyrgios missing a volley to give up the game.

Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 2-1 Seppi (*denotes server). “He is 
still serving big enough,” says Hewitt, as Kyrgios lands two huge serves, 
including an ace out wide, to secure a quick service game. First of those he 
has had for a long while. Can be build from it? Change of ends. Chill out, 
Nick. Chill out.

Kyrgios just said "I can't push through" - the kid needs a coach urgently. 
Won't win a Grand Slam without one.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 1-1 Seppi* (*denotes server). Seppi 
holds to love, beating Kyrios’ forehand with a blistering winner. The 
Australian hits into the net. So we’re on serve early. Pressure back onto 
Kyrgios, who is serving first.

Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 1-0 Seppi (*denotes server). Huge roar 
from the Melbourne crowd as Kyrgios wins the first point. Soon enough he’s back 
to 30-all, but an ace earns him game point. He does the rest with another big 
serve. That’s more like it. As the TV callers are reminding us, these two 
played out a five set marathon (always a marathon, right?) in 2015 after it was 
Kyrgios coming back from two-sets down to eventually win.

ANDREAS SEPPI WINS THE FOURTH SET 6-2! WE'RE OFF TO A FIFTH SET!

Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6 Seppi* (*denotes server). Limited 
resistance from Kyrgios, allowing Seppi to serve the set out to love. 
Appropriately, he finished it off with an ace. He’ll go into this deciding set 
with enormous confidence, as this match enters a third hour. Kyrgios’ original 
meltd0wn - way back in the third set when he was on serve and broadly flying 
two-sets up - had something to do with his preparation/fitness, according to 
the TV call. How will this effect the final set? Tune in. This could really be 
something.

Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-5 Seppi (*denotes server). This is a 
stunning turnaround. “It is amazing how quickly this can go from so much fun to 
so much misery,” says Courier of Kyrgios, as he allows another service game 
gets taken to deuce, three times in the end. He serves his way out of it at the 
death, forcing Seppi into the net twice with returns. Who will serve for the 
set after the change of ends.

Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-5 Seppi* (*denotes server). Kyrgios will 
now be serving to stay in the set, if that’s even what he fancies, after 
another easy Seppi hold. “He does not look interested in trying to break serve 
here,” says Courier again, as Seppi beats him with a crosscourt forehand - as 
though we’re in slow motion. The Italian then opens up the court, to 40-0 with 
a backhand winner. Too easy.

Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-4 Seppi (*denotes server). Slow down, is 
the advice of Courier on the call to Kyrgios. “But he’s doing just the 
opposite,” and in the process has given upa double break! From deuce came the 
double fault, and perhaps just as predictably, the loose attempted winner early 
in the rally down the line with the backhand, missing by a decent margin. Maybe 
he’s given up in the set and has already moved on mentally to what he has to do 
in the fifth? He’ll be there shortly.

Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-3 Seppi* (*denotes server). Seppi skips 
out to 40-0 before Kyrigos gets a point back when the Italian can’t get it over 
the net. But he finishes it with an ace for what’s still a conventional, easy 
hold. Three more of those and we’re into a fifth set. Nothing to suggest that 
won’t be the case now. Kyrgios unrecognisable from an hour ago.

Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-2 Seppi (*denotes server) “He’s played 
Seppi into form,” says Hewitt on the commentary, which feels about right as he 
takes two more points from Kyrigos’ serve, including a lovely backhand winner 
to take it to 40-30. That’s where the resistance ends, hitting long after 
Kyrigos challenged him at the net, but they are two more points than he was 
taking from the Australians serve at this time in the previous set, or the one 
before it for that matter.

Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 0-2 Seppi* (*denotes server): He is hard 
held, winning the game point at 40-30, but Seppi won’t mind in the slightest 
with the volume of Kyrgios errors now coming. He’s been around long enough to 
know that the volatile Australian is on the cusp of completely losing the plot 
here, if he hasn’t already.

Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 0-1 Seppi (*denotes server): Seppi is 
growing in confidence by the minute here,breaking Kyrigos in the opening game 
of the set. What is going on here? He’s in absolute meltdown mode here, missing 
a very low percentage off-forehand at 30-40. Hewitt says it best: “If he could 
have just knuckled down, he would be in there preparing for his third round 
match by now.” Now? Provided Seppi can hold his serve - and he’s really done 
that with ease over the last couple of sets - then we’ll be seeing a fifth set. 
Far from ideal.

ANDREAS SEPPI WINS THE THIRD SET! KYRGIOS LEADS 6-1, 7-6, 4-6

Third set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6 Seppi* (*denotes server): Well. Where that 
did come from? They were racing through that set on serve with Kyrgios in 
relative cruise control. Indeed, when Seppi missed a half-chance in the seventh 
game, he looked the more likely to drop his bundle. Far from it, the Australian 
really losing his way. He was pinged a point to begin that tenth game for 
breaking his racquet after being broken himself in the ninth, Seppi doing the 
rest. Has to settle here, Kyrgios.

Third set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-5 Seppi (*denotes server): Wow, what a winner 
from Seppi,he’s broken Kyrgios who has immediately broken a racquet! All 
happening now. This little implosion was on the cards for the last ten minutes 
after the Australians altercation with the playing box. He gave Seppi the break 
point at 30-40 after missing a backhand and then was down to his second serve, 
the Italian having a pop at a crosscourt forehand going the unorthodox 
direction and went and nailed it! Full points for guts. He’ll serve for the 
set. Game on.

Third set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-4 Seppi* (*denotes server): Seppi’s crosscourt 
backhand hits a net cord, floating out to give Kyrgios a chance at 30-15. But 
he misses wide himself, make that 40-15. The Italian does the rest, opening up 
the court with a big serve for a passing straightforward forehand to take the 
game. On serve we remain.

Nick Kyrgios unravels in baffling Australian Open defeat to Andreas Seppi

What a victory

Andreas Seppi is talking to Jim Courier now. How did he do it? “Maybe it was 
meant to be. It’s as good a theory as any to explain Kyrgios perplexing 
stumble, from two sets to love up, and pounding his first serve well into the 
third. Before deciding to start an ongoing stoush with his coaches box.


The forehand down the line to win? “It was a big shot at an important moment.” 
Too right. As I said before, a lot will be (rightly) made of what happened with 
Kyrgios tonight, but Seppi had every right to give it away after that second 
set tie-break. Blown off the court, two sets down. All the hard work of that 
set counting for nothing.

But he kept with it. The foundation was laid in the early games of that third 
set where his serving, far from falling away from the high standards of the 
second set, got better again. When Kyrgios couldn’t break through, the 
capitulation began. First the altercation with the box. Then the break. Then 
the broken racquet. Then the code violation. Then the set.

The fourth? Much the same, as the Australian looked uninterested at best after 
losing his first service game. Generously, it could be said he was preserving 
energy for the deciding set. But that really is being generous given the body 
language that complemented the shot selection.

 As the fifth set got deeper and deeper, Kyrgios looked the more likely to 
prevail, even after allowing Seppi to once serve for the set at 5-4. He 
regained patience. Started making first serves again with far greater 
regularity. Nabbed some cheap points, even some cheap service games. But he 
never got the second break.

He came tremendously close, at 7-8, even getting a match point. But Seppi 
again clung on. Next game? He broke the Australian. He then served it out. He 
wasn’t going to let that opportunity pass him by a second time, not after 
losing to his opponent at the same tournament - and same court - after being 
two sets up.

And that’s gotta be it. An enthralling night of tennis. A fascinating 
Australian; the best and worst of him all within those three and a half hours. 
You can only hope he’ll be better for it. A gutsy Italian, who earned his third 
round spot times over. Hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for your company.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 8-10 Seppi* (*denotes server). At 
15-all Kyrgios misseD his forehand, hitting the frame and travelling deep into 
the crowd. At this point, he knew. Or he looked resigned to it at least. A 
Seppi ace did the rest. What a proud victory. I’ll be back in a moment to try 
and make sense of the mayhem that has been the last three and half hours.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 8-9 Seppi (*denotes server). For the 
second timeSEPPI WILL SERVE FOR THE MATCH. His first serve eluding him in that 
crucial service game, coming after the drama of a broken string, Kyrgios had a 
shocker. In keeping with that messy theme: he gave away the break with a double 
fault. Maybe it wasn’t destined to be so?
 
Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 8-8 Seppi* (*denotes server). How do 
you adequately describe that? Seppi winners, net cords, a double fault, winners 
from Kyrgios after forcing the Italian deep into the court with utmost 
discipline. Big serves after a match point, following the long rally to deny 
the victory for the 14th seed. You want more? Grab it on youtube later. In 
short: utterly ridiculous. Want to go behind the fourth wall? I’d already 
written two pars wrapping up the game assuming Kyrgios had it. Should have 
known better. Was never going to be that easy.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 8-7 Seppi (*denotes server). Huge 
serve from Kyrgios to hold from 40-30, the volley he put away at 40-15 just as 
important after an error let Seppi into the game. Who now, ruthless as this is, 
will serve again to stay in theAustralian Open

Fifth set:Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 7-7 Seppi* (*denotes server). Oh where 
was that fluent serve when he was serving for the match? They’re saying it on 
TV, people are saying on twitter, it’s what’s people are saying in living rooms 
from coast to coast, whether they love Our Nick or hate him. That was a 
tremendous service game under pressure from the Italian, who has been utterly 
superb in sticking fat when lesser players would have capitulated, knowing he 
just had to stay with Kyrgios. He did. He created this opportunity as much as 
the Australian, who now serves at 7-all, has blown it. Or maybe not. It’s that 
kind of match. All will be forgiven (well, maybe not all) if he just can find a 
way to get it together for ten more minutes. The pressure sits with him.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 7-6 Seppi (*denotes server). Oh how 
Seppi may live to hurt over the opportunity he just threw away to serve this 
game out. The Australian holds at 6-all, to love. Just like it was in the good 
old says, when Kyrgios had this under control, when he was smiling, when he was 
urging the ball to do what he wanted, when he was winding up big. None of that, 
now. The ace win the game is emphatic, though. The Italian, unbelievably 
almost, now the one serving to stay in the match.
 
Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 6-6 Seppi* (*denotes server). Kyrgios 
BREAKS BACK!!!!!What is going on? Defending to stay in the tournament and 
Kyrgios has rolled a mid-rally between the legs effort. Somehow it lands, he 
wins the point. Then, showing patience that belies the earlier shot, hangs 
tough in a rally to convert that to 15-40. And an unforced error from Seppi - 
so rare from him of late - puts the two back on parity. Of course, no tie break 
in the fifth, so this could go a while. Exhausting tennis.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 5-6 Seppi (*denotes server). That is 
HUGE from Seppi, getting himself a couple of break points and converting at 
30-40 with a forehand he just reached, the going back at double-speed to 
Kyrgios, who lets it go. But it isn’t long!The Italian now gets his chance to 
serve for the match!Earlier in the game at the net together at 0-15 and Kyrgios 
missed, coming after a double fault as well, and he’s down to 0-30. A forehand 
missed makes that 15-40 shortly thereafter. But he finds a huge serve, 206kph, 
to get out of the first one, but not the second.
 
Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 5-5 Seppi* (*denotes server). An error 
opens up 0-15 for Kyrgios, and he’s well in the excellent rally that follows, 
but given a chance to take a swipe crosscourt with a forehand, he just misses. 
The game slips away quickly after the Italian steps up under pressure. Again. 
So much about the Australian’s night, but Seppi has been absolutely outstanding 
in the toughest moments tonight. Fair play.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 5-4 Seppi (*denotes server). “Your 
idea as well,” roars Kyrgios at his box after losing a point at 30-0. What’s he 
do next? Serves it out. Huge ace down the middle at 40-15. It’s like the 
Australian is at once preparing to win this game and also savage someone - 
everyone - in the post-loss press conference. These emotions fluctuating not 
only game to game, but almost point to point. You can’t look away from this 
bloke. Seppi, now, to serve to stay in the match. “I’ve never looked forward 
more to a post-match interview from Jim Courier,” says the TV host. Not wrong.
 
Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 4-4 Seppi* (*denotes server). So cool 
from Seppi! Kyrgios opened up this match for the taking with some superb rally 
patience - sorely missing for so long - to get it out to 0-30. Then a a 
blistering winner to a limp second serve give him three break points. The 
Italian responded with five points on the bounce to take the game at the first 
deuce. Wow. From serving for the match if he converts any of those the 
Australian, to now the pressure lumped right back on him after the missed 
opportunities.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 4-3 Seppi (*denotes server). To 
30-love when Seppi cannot return another Kyrgios bullet from the service line. 
Another big serve is returned long, then another sprays wide. Okay, he’s back 
in business? In between times, he encouraged Seppi to review a line-call that 
went the way of the Australian. All happening.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 3-3 Seppi* (*denotes server). A rapid 
crosscourt backhand winner returning serve gets Kyrgios to 15-all and a chance. 
The a net cord goes the way of the Italian! The crowd boo. “I’ve never heard 
the net-cord get booed before,” says Jim Courier. “It’s our Grand Slam” 
responds Lleyton. Strong. From here, Seppi holds with relative ease, landing 
his first serves at 30-15 and 40-15.
 
Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 3-2 Seppi* (*denotes server). Kyrgios 
holds to love! There’s something that wouldn’t have rated a mention in the 
second or third sets a these two did that with regularity, especially the 
Australian. So, a good sign. A pair of aces in the middle of game can only 
help. The crowd are certainly with him here.
 
Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 2-2 Seppi* (*denotes server). A chance 
created to start here, Seppi into the net after Kyrgios pushed him deep into 
the court. But the good work is undone at 15-all when he chances his hand at 
another low percentage backhand down the line. The evidence of the opening sets 
of this game would be that he just doesn’t need to do that; the Australian was 
winning pretty much every lengthy rally. And it happens again as Seppi serves, 
Kyrgios missing a volley to give up the game.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 2-1 Seppi (*denotes server). “He is 
still serving big enough,” says Hewitt, as Kyrgios lands two huge serves, 
including an ace out wide, to secure a quick service game. First of those he 
has had for a long while. Can be build from it? Change of ends. Chill out, 
Nick. Chill out.

Fifth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 1-1 Seppi* (*denotes server). Seppi 
holds to love, beating Kyrios’ forehand with a blistering winner. The 
Australian hits into the net. So we’re on serve early. Pressure back onto 
Kyrgios, who is serving first.
 
Fifth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, 1-0 Seppi (*denotes server). Huge roar 
from the Melbourne crowd as Kyrgios wins the first point. Soon enough he’s back 
to 30-all, but an ace earns him game point. He does the rest with another big 
serve. That’s more like it. As the TV callers are reminding us, these two 
played out a five set marathon (always a marathon, right?) in 2015 after it was 
Kyrgios coming back from two-sets down to eventually win.
 
Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-6 Seppi* (*denotes server). Limited 
resistance from Kyrgios, allowing Seppi to serve the set out to love. 
Appropriately, he finished it off with an ace. He’ll go into this deciding set 
with enormous confidence, as this match enters a third hour. Kyrgios’ original 
meltd0wn - way back in the third set when he was on serve and broadly flying 
two-sets up - had something to do with his preparation/fitness, according to 
the TV call. How will this effect the final set? Tune in. This could really be 
something.

Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 2-5 Seppi (*denotes server). This is a 
stunning turnaround. “It is amazing how quickly this can go from so much fun to 
so much misery,” says Courier of Kyrgios, as he allows another service game 
gets taken to deuce, three times in the end. He serves his way out of it at the 
death, forcing Seppi into the net twice with returns. Who will serve for the 
set after the change of ends.
 
Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-5 Seppi* (*denotes server). Kyrgios will 
now be serving to stay in the set, if that’s even what he fancies, after 
another easy Seppi hold. “He does not look interested in trying to break serve 
here,” says Courier again, as Seppi beats him with a crosscourt forehand - as 
though we’re in slow motion. The Italian then opens up the court, to 40-0 with 
a backhand winner. Too easy.
 
Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-4 Seppi (*denotes server). Slow down, is 
the advice of Courier on the call to Kyrgios. “But he’s doing just the 
opposite,” and in the process has given upa double break! From deuce came the 
double fault, and perhaps just as predictably, the loose attempted winner early 
in the rally down the line with the backhand, missing by a decent margin. Maybe 
he’s given up in the set and has already moved on mentally to what he has to do 
in the fifth? He’ll be there shortly.
 
Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-3 Seppi* (*denotes server). Seppi skips 
out to 40-0 before Kyrigos gets a point back when the Italian can’t get it over 
the net. But he finishes it with an ace for what’s still a conventional, easy 
hold. Three more of those and we’re into a fifth set. Nothing to suggest that 
won’t be the case now. Kyrgios unrecognisable from an hour ago.
 
Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 1-2 Seppi (*denotes server) “He’s played 
Seppi into form,” says Hewitt on the commentary, which feels about right as he 
takes two more points from Kyrigos’ serve, including a lovely backhand winner 
to take it to 40-30. That’s where the resistance ends, hitting long after 
Kyrigos challenged him at the net, but they are two more points than he was 
taking from the Australians serve at this time in the previous set, or the one 
before it for that matter.
 
Fourth set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 0-2 Seppi* (*denotes server): He is hard 
held, winning the game point at 40-30, but Seppi won’t mind in the slightest 
with the volume of Kyrgios errors now coming. He’s been around long enough to 
know that the volatile Australian is on the cusp of completely losing the plot 
here, if he hasn’t already.
 
Fourth set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6, 0-1 Seppi (*denotes server): Seppi is 
growing in confidence by the minute here,breaking Kyrigos in the opening game 
of the set. What is going on here? He’s in absolute meltdown mode here, missing 
a very low percentage off-forehand at 30-40. Hewitt says it best: “If he could 
have just knuckled down, he would be in there preparing for his third round 
match by now.” Now? Provided Seppi can hold his serve - and he’s really done 
that with ease over the last couple of sets - then we’ll be seeing a fifth set. 
Far from ideal.
 
Third set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-6 Seppi* (*denotes server): Well. Where that 
did come from? They were racing through that set on serve with Kyrgios in 
relative cruise control. Indeed, when Seppi missed a half-chance in the seventh 
game, he looked the more likely to drop his bundle. Far from it, the Australian 
really losing his way. He was pinged a point to begin that tenth game for 
breaking his racquet after being broken himself in the ninth, Seppi doing the 
rest. Has to settle here, Kyrgios.
 
Third set: *Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-5 Seppi (*denotes server): Wow, what a winner 
from Seppi,he’s broken Kyrgios who has immediately broken a racquet! All 
happening now. This little implosion was on the cards for the last ten minutes 
after the Australians altercation with the playing box. He gave Seppi the break 
point at 30-40 after missing a backhand and then was down to his second serve, 
the Italian having a pop at a crosscourt forehand going the unorthodox 
direction and went and nailed it! Full points for guts. He’ll serve for the 
set. Game on.
 
Third set: Kyrgios 6-1, 7-6, 4-4 Seppi* (*denotes server): Seppi’s crosscourt 
backhand hits a net cord, floating out to give Kyrgios a chance at 30-15. But 
he misses wide himself, make that 40-15. The Italian does the rest, opening up 
the court with a big serve for a passing straightforward forehand to take the 
game. On serve we remain.
