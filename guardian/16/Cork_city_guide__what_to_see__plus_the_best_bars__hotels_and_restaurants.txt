“It’s always Cork first and Ireland second,” said Roy Keane in a 1997 RTE 
documentary, Have Boots Will Travel. Keane, now the national football team’s 
assistant manager, was describing how he replies when people ask where he’s 
from. However, the reality is this self-proclaimed “rebel city” often plays 
second fiddle to Dublin in terms of attention, influence and media hubbub – and 
that even extends to it as a short-break destination. But missing out on Cork 
is a mistake. This is a city with a little bit of everything, and a touch of 
magic.

Blessed by a location in southern Ireland that means fresh seafood plus lush 
countryside for dairy produce and livestock, Cork’s food scene is flourishing 
under the watchful eye of chefs such as Kate Lawlor and Denis Cotter, and at 
restaurants including Electric, Farmgate Cafe, Fenn’s Quay and Market Lane. 
Beer thoughts may start with Beamish and Murphy’s but craft breweries, such as 
award-winner Rising Sons, as well as Elbow Lane, the Franciscan Well, and the 
Cotton Ball Brewing Co, provide character in a pub scene that is alive, well 
and adhering to cliches – in the best possible sense.

Yes, it has its historic attractions. Enjoy city views and ring the Shandon 
Bells atSt Anne’s church (adults €5, children €2.50), marvel at the William 
Burges-designedSaint Fin Barre’s cathedral <http://corkcathedral.webs.com/> 
(€5), chinstroke atthe Crawford art gallery  <http://www.crawfordartgallery.ie/>
(free) – or visitCork Butter museum <http://www.corkbutter.museum/> (adult €4, 
child €1.50). But this student-rich city also has a sense of fun and a strong 
cultural heartbeat away from its tourist hits.

Cork hosts 24 major festivals every year, including Ireland’s oldest movie 
showcase,the Cork film festival <http://www.corkfilmfest.org/>, which 
celebrates its 61st birthday in November. There’s also a world-renownedjazz 
festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/20/top-10-jazz-festivals-europe-montreux-umbria-cork>
 in October and annual celebrations of folk music, literature, science and 
food. What’s more, this is a place built for strolling and has a centre ripe 
for exploring. It has its dark side, too … though you can more easily examine 
that amid the, at times, comic setting of Lisa McInerney’s prize-winning novel
The Glorious Heresies 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-glorious-heresies.html>.

Cork may often have been merely a starting point for those heading west to the 
rugged, dramatic scenery of the Ring of Kerry, Mizen Head and the Ring of Beara 
but it is a fascinating jaunt in its own right. The verbal jousting with Dublin 
about being the “real” capital of Ireland is unlikely to end but pick any month 
and there’ll be a great event here; pick the right time and an affordable 
return flight is likely. Cork could be the short-hop stop that turns into the 
best of adventures.

Get on the Fab Food Trail

It’s not fast food but fab food. This walking tour is nourishing and an 
essential way to see Cork’s most respected and up-and-coming cafes, restaurants 
and market traders. The three-hour guided odyssey reveals great foodie 
destinations – with tasting opportunities – and provides an insight into the 
city’s architecture and history. The groups are small (up to 14) and the 
stopoffs changed regularly – though it may include the inventiveFilter 
<https://www.facebook.com/F-I-L-T-E-R-537055749645261/> cafe, the swishness of 
Fenn’s Quay <http://fennsquay.net/> restaurant, and the ace salad and juice bar,

October. Photograph: Hayley Madden/Redferns 
It doesn’t matter if you miss a festival in Cork, there’ll be another along in 
a minute: the city averages two a month. Thejazz festival (28-31 October) 
attracts star names and this year has a double bill featuring theRobert Glasper 
Experiment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/15/robert-glasper-experiment-art-science-review-jazz-cd-blue-note>
 and the James Taylor Quartet. The Corkfilm festival (11-20 November) mixes 
home-grown movies, a well-curated pick from world cinema, plus a few Hollywood 
big hitters. It makes use of venues around the city, including the impressive 
Opera House.This year, the festival <http://www.corkfilmfest.org/2016/> 
features director Nate Parker’s provocative The Birth of a Nation; Gimme 
Danger, Jim Jarmusch’s documentary about punk band the Stooges; a strand of 
German films; and a series of late-night screenings including a 40th 
anniversary presentation of Carrie. If you want to plan ahead: themidsummer 
festival in mid-to-late June is a sunny celebration of the arts, while Cork 
Pride is usually held in July.

Back to university


The grounds of University College Cork <http://www.ucc.ie/en/> make a pleasant 
place for a stroll – leafy winding paths, walks alongside the river Lee – but 
they also provide a glimpse of old and new in harmony. At the entrance to the 
grounds is theLewis Glucksman Gallery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/aug/22/architecture.communities>
, a glorious timber, stone and glass construction that hosts free exhibitions. 
A few minutes away, and facing the student centre, is theHonan Chapel: an arts 
and crafts design, it celebrates its 100th anniversary in November and is named 
after the Cork merchant family who financed its construction.

Shop in a market that’s super


The English Market is in the centre of the city and seems to be its heart, 
too; it certainly fills the belly. A traditional covered market dating from the 
mid-19th century, it brings together greengrocers, bakers, butchers and 
fishmongers with a smattering of cafes and a clutch of stalls selling clothes, 
household items and art. It’s a destination in its own right but, importantly, 
functions as a market, not a novelty. Stalls to check out includebutcher Tom 
Durcan <http://www.tomdurcanmeats.ie/>, for his spiced beef, and Kay O’Connell 
Fish Merchants <http://www.koconnellfish.com/>, where Pat O’Connell has plenty 
of wit to match his fish wisdom.

Farmgate Café


On the upper floor of the English Market, this daytime cafe has views of the 
stalls below, turning it into a gallery for observing the scale of the market. 
Family-run – Rebecca Harte, daughter of the original owner, Kay, is now the 
manager – it gets most of its produce direct from the market. The lunch menu 
features a catch of the day, while meat treats include hearty-not-heavy pork 
sausages, mash, lentils and bacon (€12.50) and, for a subtle-but-sweet dish, 
there’s the St Tola goat’s cheese and roasted beetroot salad (€12.50).

Electric


The focus of the menu is on locally caught fish and prime Irish steaks but the 
art deco building and its views of the Lee from the restaurant, bar and terrace 
add an extra jolt of “wow” to this foodie haven. A new fish bar, open from 5pm 
daily, serves three Pacific oysters for €7, seafood chowder from €4.50 and a 
sumptuous and refreshing lightly poached hake with cream (€12).

Nash 19


The worst thing about Nash 19 – bakery, cafe and gallery – is that it closes 
at 4pm. The good news is, it’s open early: weekdays from 7.30am, Saturdays from 
8.30am. And if it’s busy, pick up a Nash2Go box of sandwiches. If the baked 
cakes and tarts, or owner Claire Nash’s house granola (€4) don’t tempt, the 
full fry-up (€10), or a lunch-time feast of its house burger with skinny fries 
(€13), should put fuel in the tank.

 Mutton Lane Inn 
The Mutton Lane Inn


Welcome to your new favourite pub: the kind of dark-but-welcoming hideaway 
that would be perfect were it on the route home from work. Time seems to hold 
no sway in this compact (and candlelit) delight in an alleyway by the English 
Market. Open from 10.30am (not Sundays), it’s often busy but somehow there’s 
always somewhere to sit or prop yourself. Rising Sons’ craft brews feature 
prominently.
• 3 Mutton Lane, on Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/mutton.lane>

Edison


This cocktail bar in a former cinema offers an antidote to the bustle of the 
more conventional bars found on, and around, Washington Street. Cocktails start 
from €7 and include classics such as Tom Collins, Old Fashioned and Mai Tai, 
with new twists in a Popcorn Daiquiri and The Lethal Weapon (dark rum, 
grenadine, passion fruit, orange and pineapple). The industrial-chic decor, 
with its filament-showcasing lightbulbs, nods towards hipsterville but the fact 
it also stocks craft brews fromFranciscan Well 
<http://www.franciscanwellbrewery.com/en/index> and Cotton Ball Brewing Co 
<http://www.cottonball.ie/> shows its local roots.

Charlie’s Bar


This is a Cork institution for two reasons: it’s a wonderful, traditional pub 
to watch live music in, and it’s an early-morning bar. That last bit means it’s 
open daily (except Sunday) from 7am. Right by the Lee but still close to the 
city centre, Charlie’s has a coal fire (for the cold mornings) and musical 
offerings beyond just fiddles, drums and accordions to include rock, blues and 
more.

A couple of doors down from Rising Sons’ modern and cavernous pub-brewery on 
Cornmarket Street is Dennehy’s Bar – which is quite the opposite. There’s no 
TV; instead the walls are decorated with notes from the world’s currencies and 
framed covers ofThe Phoenix <http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/welcome.do>, 
Ireland’s answer to Private Eye. The bar has been run by the Dennehy family for 
more than 50 years, and that spirit of continuity is there in the chatter of 
locals and a concentration on the basics: bar stools and wooden tables, decent 
beers and good conversation.

Reidy’s Wine Vault Bar

It’s slightly out of the city centre, on the road to the university, but 
Reidy’s is a great pitstop for decent beer, good-value food (soups, stews, 
sandwiches) and a calm atmosphere. It has a nostalgic air with its long wooden 
bar with plenty of seats, high stools around circular tables and globe-shaped 
bulbs that give out just the right amount of warm light. There’s also a quaint 
beer garden at the back.

 River Lee Hotel 
River Lee hotel


This large, plush, contemporary hotel has a picture-perfect location on the 
river and is almost equidistant from the university and the centre of town. The 
breakfast and dining area is light and airy, the rooms are a generous size with 
many having views of the river or Saint Fin Barre’s cathedral and there’s even 
a small spa, pool and gym area.

The Imperial hotel


Whereas the River Lee is modern and glass-fronted, the Imperial has old-style 
grandeur and the maturity to say “2016 is my 200th birthday”. The 125 rooms mix 
classic furnishings with modern amenities and the lobby is a marbled wonder 
that is also a gateway to the New York-esque booths and curved bar of Seventy 
Six on the Mall. That restaurant is one of three; Lafayette’s Brasserie also 
impresses – because it seems inspired by Wes Anderson’s Grand Budapest Hotel. 
It’s in the heart of the city so worth a visit even for those not staying here.
