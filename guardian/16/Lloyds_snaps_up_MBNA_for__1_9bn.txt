Lloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> is to spend £1.9bn 
on MBNA, a credit card business owned by Bank of America, as the bailed-out 
lender continues its recovery from the financial crisis.

The UK bank’s first major acquisition since its £20bn rescue by the taxpayer 
during the 2008 crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/17/lloyds-banking-group-from-bailout-to-selloff>
 will give it a 26% share of the credit card market and allow it to produce 
£100m annual savings within two years.

Lloyds, 7% owned by the taxpayer, would not comment on the implications for 
the workforces of the two operations, which employ a combined 2,700 in Chester.

MBNA – one of the UK’s largest credit card issuers, with 7 million customers 
including its own brands and the official cards of several major football clubs 
– has been on the market for some time. Lloyds had been battling against US 
private equity group Cerberus, HSBC and Santander UK for the operation.

A firewall against claims for payment protection insurance (PPI) was thought 
to be crucial in securing the deal. The misselling scandal hasalready cost 
Lloyds £17bn

 – more than any other bank – and Lloyds said its exposure to MBNA’s bill was 
capped at £240m, indicating Bank of America will pick up the tab for anything 
above that threshold.

The deal is expected to complete in the first six months of 2017, during which 
time the government is expected to sell the last of its shares in Lloyds.

Lloyds was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 by mid-afternoon, up about 2.5% 
to 64p. The government is selling off its remaining stake at prices below the 
76.3p average price at which taxpayers paid to take a 43% stake during the 
crisis.

António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, said the MBNA name would be 
retained as part of the bank’s multi-brand strategy. Among its brands are 
Halifax, Bank of Scotland and car finance lender Black Horse. It also, he said, 
“advances our strategic aim to deliver sustainable growth as a UK-focused 
retail and commercial bank”.

Lloyds paid for the business out of its reserves, which sparked some concerns 
that it might not be able to pay a special dividend to shareholders. The bank 
insisted its payout policy was not altered. “Nothing has changed,” said George 
Culmer, Lloyds’ finance director.

The transaction further focuses Lloyds on the domestic market at time when the 
UK is preparing to exit the EU. Joseph Dickerson, a banking analyst at 
Jefferies, said the deal was “a very good use” of Lloyds’ excess capital and 
that the terms looked attractive.


Dickerson said that a special dividend “is now unlikely but the MBNA 
acquisition looks a better use of excess to us”.


The deal will increase Lloyds’ market share of credit cards from 15% to 26%, 
making it second only to Barclaycard in terms of size.


Culmer acknowledged the deal was subject to competition approval but he said a 
recent study had found the credit card market was “healthy and competitive”.

The bank has a 25% share of current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% 
of mortgages.
