, senior reporter Amelia Hill will investigate the dramatic ageing of Britain, 
and the implications for work, retirement and wellbeing. Life expectancy is 
growing by five hours a day, bringing huge challenges - and opportunities - and 
forcing us to rethink the way we live, love and work.

whose pensions have been eroded and benefits whittled away, and who might not 
be on the housing ladder. And she’ll be asking: what if you’re in your 30s and 
barely able to pay your rent,let alone save for a retirement
