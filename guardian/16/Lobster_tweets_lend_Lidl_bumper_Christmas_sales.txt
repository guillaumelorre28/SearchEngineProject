Lidl <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl> sold 40,000 lobsters in a 
single day after a canny social media promotion in which the more people 
tweeted about the product, the more the price dropped.

The German discounter sold about 200,000 lobsters over the Christmas period as 
a whole but generated a big rise in sales on 26 November, the day after Black 
Friday.

Sales soared as it cut the price from £5.99 to £2.99 in response to 2,000 
people tweeting about its lobster, which hasbecome a mainstay of discounters’ 
efforts to tempt in middle-class shoppers at Christmas

. Lidl also reduced the price of mini stollen, Serrano ham and silver-topped 
Christmas puddings as part of the social media campaign.

Lidl’s sales rose 10% in December, against the same month last year, as it 
opened new stores and attracted shoppers with its mix of bargain prices and 
luxury foods. The strong performance helped Lidl lift its market share to 4.4% 
in the three months to 1 January, up from 4.2% the year before, according to 
data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel.

Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said sales at established 
stores were likely to have risen by 5%. He said it was likely to have been 
boosted by up to 3% by the benefit of an additional Saturday of trading in 
December and the timing of Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, which made it 
easier for customers to do their big shop at the weekend.
