David Marquand asserts that “there is no such place as Britain” (How can 
Britain exit the EU? Britain doesn’t really exist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/13/britain-doesnt-really-exist-exit--eu>
, 13 January). If Britain is not a nation, to what nation does the “national” 
refer in “National Rail”, “National Trust”, “national debt” etc? No Welsh 
embassy, Scottish passport, Northern Irish armed force, or English 
international dialling code exists. All nations are artificial, invented 
constructs. The UK is no less a country than each of its constituent nations.

It is perfectly possible for a nation state to be multinational. Marquand 
calls France a nation state, yet nationalist Bretons assert their own national 
identity. Basques and Catalans constitute different national groups but there 
is no doubt that the Kingdom of Spain, like the United Kingdom, is itself a 
country.

Marquand claims the UK’s story is one of “relentless English expansion” 
without acknowledging that its genesis lies in James VI ofScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> (I of England), whose reign not only 
began the Plantation of Ulster, but also introduced a coin known as the 
“Unite”. This bore the legend: “I will make them one nation”.

It has become worryingly common for Scottish nationalists to claim they have 
been colonised under English rule. Scotland has never been a colony. To suggest 
this is to insult those countries that did suffer as a result of the British 
imperialist project, which Scotland was only too happy to partake in.

• David Marquand’s article suggests an obvious solution to many of the issues 
arising from the EU referendum. Rethink the UK so that England and Wales have a 
constitutional status akin to that of theChannel Islands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/channelislands> and the Isle of Man, which are 
not in the EU. Some rebranding of their status as crown dependencies might be 
required.

This would allow Brexiteers to pursue their dreams without having to deal with 
any Europeans. It would also respect the very clear democratic wishes of 
Scotland and Northern Ireland.

• In making the case for a “clean break with the EU” Theresa May argues that 
“One of the reasons that Britain’s democracy has been such a success for so 
many years is … the strength of our identity as one nation” (Theresa May to say 
UK is ‘prepared to accept hard Brexit’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/15/theresa-may-uk-is-prepared-to-accept-hard-brexit>
, theguardian.com, 15 January). The reality is very different. As David 
Marquand points out, the UK is a multinational state and two parts of it, 
Scotland and Northern Ireland, voted to remain in the EU.

May is set to continue the long history of English prime ministers ignoring 
the wishes of the non-English parts of the UK. By doing so she may well ensure 
that the UK itself does not survive exit from the EU.

• In your article on the Brexit resistance (We’re getting bigger all the time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/brexit-resistance-getting-bigger-pro-europe-eu-referendum-organising-groups>
, G2, 11 January) you pointed out that in Scotland the SNP remains “staunchly 
pro-European”, but that there is no such representation for people in England 
and Wales. Despite the overall vote in Wales, this country is not without 
political representation. Plaid Cymru remains staunchly and actively 
pro-European.

Given the vote here, Plaid Cymru is concentrating on protection of employment 
and the environment, rather than fighting a similar battle to the SNP in 
Scotland. It was depressing to see Welsh Labour voting against aPlaid Cymru 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/plaid-cymru> motion to the assembly 
before Christmas to support remaining in the single market.

Opinion polls after the referendum vote found that Plaid Cymru members and 
supporters gave a higher percentage of votes to remain than those of any other 
party in the UK. TreatingWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> and 
England as one heterogeneous country is inaccurate.

• It was the ruling of the European court of justice (or injustice, as I call 
it) in 1988 compelling the UK to impose VAT on spectacle lenses that prompted 
my decision to vote leave. My myopia is off the scale, so this has a severe 
financial impact on me. I waited nearly 30 years to stick up two fingers to the 
overpaid, unelected, meddling apparatchiks in the EU commission who decided to 
take the UK government to the ECJ because we were not taxing people with sight 
problems.

Now Joseph Muscat, prime minister of Malta, a country of fewer than half a 
million people, tells us we’re stuck with the ECJ for years to come (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/12/eu-law-will-continue-to-apply-in-uk-during-transition-deal>
, 13 January). His intervention illustrates why ignorant, uneducated, 
uninformed bigots like me want out of the EU.

• Prediction is a risky business these days. But I think I’m on secure ground 
in anticipating that the prescriptionTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> will announce this week to 
stave off the catastrophic economic effects of Brexit will be (as already 
announced) a race to the bottom in corporation tax, plus resistance to any 
further regulation of financial services. The objective will be to establish 
London as a seamless channel to opaque tax havens, as the servicer and 
facilitator-in-chief to global kleptocracy. The rest of the economy, and the 
rest of the country, will be allowed to wither.

Political and media voices should be raised in outrage at this squalid sellout 
of a once-proud nation. But here’s my second prediction: it won’t happen.
