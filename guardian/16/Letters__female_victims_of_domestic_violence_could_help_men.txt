Further to your letter (“Male victims of domestic abuse also need protection”; 
Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/jan/01/male-victims-of-abuse-need-protection>
”, may I point out that the organisations that support women who have suffered 
male violence were all started and maintained by women who have volunteered 
their time and skills to help other women. Many have obtained funding and now 
employ paid staff to help, but the organisations exist thanks to volunteer 
management committees. All men are perfectlyfree to do the same for male 
victims; I am sure that, if asked, the women who have experience will share 
their skills with any man who wishes to follow in their footsteps.

However, the figures are different: while a refuge in every large town would 
still mean a shortage for women, one refuge in London would suffice for men. 
While in the majority of cases women have their access to money blocked before 
the physical violence begins, most men (though not all) will be able to book 
into a hotel or B&B if they have to flee the home. And again in most cases, men 
don’t feel they have to take the children too, for the children’s safety, so 
they don’t have that complication.

On the other hand, thanks to those organisations that support women, the 
stigma of their being abused is disappearing, but it still exists for men.

Of course they also need support.

An alternative view of Brexit

Michael Gove’s oft-quoted contention that people are “tired” of experts was 
off the mark, though not entirely (“Brexit’s slow-burning fuse will reach a 
powder keg this year”, William Keegan, Business 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/brexit-slow-burning-fuse-powder-keg-in-2017>
). People who do not mix in the type of circles that affluent politicians and 
Cambridge-educated journalists are used to simply don’t trust the experts. And 
given that many of the doomsday predictions that experts on both sides doled 
out during the EU referendum campaign have failed to materialise, perhaps some 
people’s reluctance to take expert advice at face value is not so plebeian as 
some might have usthink.

What is tiresome to us Brexiters, however, are condescending and arrogant 
Remoaners who are incapable or unwilling to see the issue from any point of 
view other than their own ratherprivileged and narrow-minded one.

News in a post-truth world

For me, the final sentences of Peter Preston’s article “Technology never stops 
changing, but we will always need journalism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/01/we-always-need-journalism-but-change-never-stops>
” (Media) say it all: “However produced, however delivered, this swirling world 
needs facts, perceptions, arguments, reflections, hard truths. This world needs 
journalism.”

In today’s digital, post-truth world, journalism such as Preston’s looks 
positively antediluvian to the news-hungry section of our society. Circulation 
figures for all our daily newspapers speak for themselves. People nowadays want 
three things in their public-awareness stream. First, accurate, verifiable, 
up-to-the-minute, readily accessible and digestible news. Second, the ability 
to provoke necessary action and comment on individual news items (“Who do I 
contact to get something done about this particular news item?”). Finally, news 
and comment should be clearly separated and delineated.

The care we’d want ourselves 

For better health we need a better society, writes Will Hutton (“Good health 
is born of a good society. Little wonder that we’re suffering”; Comment, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/good-health-good-society-we-are-suffering>
). Less inequality, fairer taxation and more support for those of us, old and 
young, who most need it. But that may also require abroader shift from 
dependence on top-down, centralised provision, the array of goods and services 
we pay for but can’t control or understand. Somehow, we must get a better grip 
on what we can understand, agree and do together for ourselves.

That’s where society begins to make sense and social care is a natural 
starting point. It’s a face-to-face and hands-on business, with the expertise 
of experience and fellow-feeling. Hospital and social service departments would 
collapse without a threadbare but resilient safety net of family and friends, 
neighbours and workmates. And among the self-appointed carers are hundreds of 
thousands of children with parents or siblings who depend on them.

Two recent proposals suggest ways forward: Liberal Democrat former minister 
Norman Lamb has proposed a dedicated tax for health and social care 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34320419>, while the chief nursing 
officer for England, Jane Cummings,calls for more systematic support for care 
at home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/27/nhs-should-shift-focus-to-home-based-care-says-chief-nursing-officer>
. A clearly costed and targeted national insurance would help. Priority for 
home-care, paid or otherwise, would save a lot of institutional and hi-tech 
provision. It’s also what most of us would want for ourselves.

PM’s cynical positioning? 

So Mrs May is to fight for the interests of the 48%  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/31/theresa-may-new-year-message-brexit>
who voted Remain in the EU referendum as well as those who voted Leave 
(“Theresa May’s new year message: I’ll fight Remainers’ case in Europe, too”; 
News). While this intention, if sincere, is much to be welcomed, a cynic might 
ask whether she is simply positioning herself so that, however internal and 
external forces may shape Britain’s final relationship with the EU, she can 
claim credit for the result and stay in office. In these circumstances, the 
referendum might come to be seen as a political non-event and rightly so, given 
its origins, conduct and vague constitutional status.
