Hello; it is soooo real life! But not only mine. You should've seen the stack 
of mail I got! The devious Cordelia is well-known around the world, it seems.

How did you find the confidence to believe in your writing and submit it to be 
professionally published, or was it something you always had?

Hello: I think I was just ignorant. This was the 1950s. I was a teenager. I 
didn't see why I couldn't do things, so I did them. If I'd known the odds I 
might have been discouraged. But just this: if you don't try, nothing happens.

What was your reasoning and inspiration behind the meta-lecture at the end of 
The Handmaid’s Tale? What do you feel it adds to the story? (And did Offred get 
away and survive?)

Hello: Offred herself can't know much about the genesis of the regime, so the 
meta-lecture fills us in; AND we know that the regime itself did not last. As 
for Offred, she got as far as Bangor, Maine, at least. Quite close to the 
Canadian border. And Maine itself was a famous rum-running destination in the 
30s, so smuggling possibilities abound. There's hope,.

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/60360188> asks:

I am a huge fan of your work and I have read almost all your short stories. 
However, in recent years I’ve been noticing a decline in short story 
publications – which saddens me, as they are my favourite form of literature. 
What do you think about this decline, and how do you feel about the form 
itself? What purpose does it serve you? Do you think the growth of online 
writing platforms have something to do with this decline? And do you have any 
recommendations of any short stories that are personal favourites?

Hello; Love the form.. and Alice Munro just won the Nobel Prize for her 
stories... my own recent collection is Stone Mattress. I think stories may be 
making a comeback.
I grew up on anthologies of stories. Mansfield, Hemingway, Porter, Checkhov, 
Gogol, Poe... many many more

Hello; yes, more than a rumour! To see the Hogarth Press Shakespeare project, 
go to their website. Jeanette Winterson is launching the first one – The Gap of 
Time _– this Wed., based on The Winter's Tale. Well done, it is! Mine will 
indeed be a revisiting of The Tempest. Such fun.

I’m a molecular biologist, and I loved Oryx and Crake – a fantastic novel. 
With the current revolution in genome editing, how do you feel the dystopia 
portrayed in the novel looks now in the light of the new technology? Must 
things necessarily turn out so wrong, or is there a more positive side to 
genetic engineering?

Hello; thank you. Things are not fated to turn out wrong, and no one can 
predict the future. Genome editing could be a powerful tool for good. But any 
human tool is subject to misuse. This is a very powerful tool, and I am not 
alone in my pondering on possible negative twists and turns. I am following the 
ongoing story with considerable interest! (Dry land crops, coming to the fore?)

When do you plan to quit lecturing Canadians about how our values are all 
wrong if we don’t agree with your personal viewpoints about politics? I mean, 
you are entitled to your views on anything, but you also need to remember that 
only you have a bully pulpit!

Hello; Thank you for your question. It raises some important issues. First, I 
don't confine myself to Canadians. I write in many countries. Second, I'd like 
to see the place where I said anything like 'we are all wrong if we don't agree 
with your personal viewpoints," etc. I am quite careful to reference polls that 
indicate how many Canadians support (for instance) PAS. Third, do you think 
that my having a readership should disqualify me from writing about matters of 
public interest? Oddly, many people take that as a reason why ~I should do it 
even more

In a liberal democracy, people should indeed feel they can say what they like. 
But a lot of people are constrained from doing that, partly because they fear 
for their jobs.

I'm currently writing a piece called "Cheated of Our Public Science." Our 
public scientists aren't allowed to speak to the public about their findings, 
even though the work for the public, in the public interest, and are paid by 
the public. They can't write such a piece themselves.Do you think it's only my 
personal political view that this is wrong? Do you think there should not be 
any public science, and that data should be generated (and lied about) by the 
likes of Volkswagen? Do you think I ought not to publish the piece?

The press is called The Fifth Estate for a reason. It is a key component in a 
liberal democracy. The fact that it exists has allowed you yourself to make 
this comment.

I recently read The Handmaid’s Tale, and more than the Christian right in 
America it seemed to very accurately predict the likes of how ISIS and the 
Taliban treat women. Is that something that has occurred to you in more recent 
years?

Hello: I think ISIS etc. are actually quite a bit worse; though same general 
floor plan, as it were. I have to say that I don't think the Gilead regime is 
Christian in any centrally meaningful sense of the term. Religious, yes; right, 
yes; but they do not love their neighbour as themselves, nor do they refrain 
from casting the first stone. I based the regime on history – nothing we 
haven't done, some time. some place. For more on that, see the Afterword in the 
book, as well as my essay on it in 'In Other Worlds: SF and the Human 
Imagination." I did visit Afghanistan in 1978... 6 weeks before the current 
cycle of wars and violence began.

In your recent essay in the Guardian, dated 19 September, you are talking 
about us “surrendering our hard-won freedoms too easily …” and that “digital 
technology has made it easier than ever to treat people like domesticated 
animals farmed for profit.” Because we leave a digital footprint wherever we go 
– a footprint we cannot escape because we have a social security card, a health 
card, a bank card and so on – shouldn’t we look to ourselves for the answers? 
We are making it easier for them by streaming all that information online – and 
the amount of information we reveal about ourselves voluntarily is stupefying. 
We reveal our phone numbers, birthdays, addresses, where we are, what we are 
doing, whom we are with, what we buy, what we eat, how much we spend and where 
we spend it. How and when did we become so gullible?

Hello: This subject has been hotly debated for years. If you are interested, 
there is an org called The Citizen Lab that tracks government use of internet 
tech to control citizens and spy on them – around the world. Yes, our use of 
anything digital does indeed make us vulnerable to tracking and spying, and in 
some cases to arrest and execution. But it has now become very difficult to buy 
anything, own anything, stay in a hotel etc, without the use of cards and 
passwords. So I'm not sure it's just our gullibility. We're being corralled 
into internet fenced areas, because that's so much more convenient for certain 
kinds of companies. Also, it's often convenient for us. NB you can download 
programmes such as Ghostery that let you know when you're being tracked. And 
you can install – for instance – a VPN, with companies such as Avast, that 
secure your transactions somewhat better. But spying itself is as old as the 
hills... it's just become easier, online. Hint: we could go back to writing 
letters. Though that was never foolproof, either.

on Blackie – and had the same struggle as I had when I dressed our lecherous 
old tom, Tiddles?

Did you know – as I read in my vets book on cats – “that all vets know tom 
cats will put up with anything from little girls”. I didn’t know. No wonder 
they never scratched us.

Hello; Blackie was a real cat, as you may have gathered, but it was not I who 
put the doll's outfits on him. It was daughter and pals, age about 6. I myself 
did used to dress up my first cat, Perkolator, when I was @ 8. But she was a 
female cat. It is amazing how they put up with it, and dangerous for them if 
they ran away in the clothes... bonnet strings might have been treacherous. 
They may have thought of it as a kind of stroking. Attention was certainly 
being paid, in any case. (And I know, I shouldn't have done it.)

I realise that, in some ways, there’s not a lot to recommend our planet’s 
future prospects under climate change. And in the past, you’ve said that it’s 
now become a race between our technological development and ecological 
management, and the decline of the Earth’s resources and our changing 
environment. Has there been any progress that makes you optimistic about our 
chances of survival? Something that impresses me tremendously about your books 
is that they make me imagine a future so precisely – and you so frequently draw 
upon fact and nature.

Hello; Funny you should mention it. If you look on the website Medium/Matter, 
you'll find a couple of things by me. One of them is called It's not Climate 
Change, it's Everything Change, which runs through some good and bad scenarios. 
The other is called The Carbonivore Fund, which is an imaginary fund with real 
tecchs in it; techs that remove carbon from the atmosphere. The list has got 
longer since I posted the piece. These are really hopeful. Enjoy.

Thank you for the MaddAddam trilogy – I loved it! Do you present us with 
dystopia because you’er a pessimist, or because you are an optimist and hope 
that by being presented with dystopia we will fight more forcefully for an 
utopia?

Hello: You're most welcome! I am actually a somewhat annoying optimist, though 
of course I call it "realism." I think one (or I, anyway) writes (or write) 
such books so people will think through the consequences of certain kinds of 
choices and then not make them. All too often, we make choices short-term and 
are then ambushed by the results. So yes, the books are a kind of "Don't go 
there." You'll notice however that I didn't kill everyone off at the end. I did 
not for instance go into the consequences of a deadened ocean and have them all 
choke to death for lack of oxygen. Now that's optimism!

Did you ever have a name in mind for Ofglen in The Handmaid’s Tale? In A-level 
English, we had discussed whether it could be June. There was a chapter that 
began with the handmaids sharing their names and we met all of those named 
characters, except for June. It’s something I’ve always wondered about! (I know 
the film version used Kate, which seemed wrong to me; as with so many 
adaptations, however, much of it did …)

Hello: I actually didn't, but the readers have pointed out the June 
connection, and it fits... so maybe her name is June. Well deduced, readers! I 
hadn't thought of that myself.

Hello to Armenia! several of my classmates in the 1950s at high school were 
from Armenian families. One of them (Greg Kasparian) was the school captain.
It is of course very flattering that The Handmaid's Tale has been taught in so 
many schools, and also in the International Baccalaureate programme. I think 
that happens because the book generates a lot of discussion among students. The 
government in it is totalitarian, so I would hope some of that discussion would 
be about how to to avoid such governments. They tend to come in during periods 
of extreme social upheaval.

 asks:

Will you ever construct a dark poem again – like the red-headed single woman 
of 1700s Salem, who’s accused of being a witch, is hung by the neck in her 
cherry orchard and defies all odds by living until morning – and therefore can 
no longer be accused of being a witch? She then collected black cats in earnest.

This beautifully twisted bit of work has changed my life forever. Whenever I 
am sad, I think of her, hanging all night in her orchard, quietly looking at 
the stars and thinking …

Will you please write more poetry?

You are such a creative genius.

Hello to everyone and thank you for your questions. I have chosen some of them 
for variety, but I hope to get around to more of them as well.
The poem sequence called "Half-hanged Mary" was based on a real person, Mary 
Webster, who was indeed left hanging all night and was still alive in the 
morning. This was possible because the drop – which breaks your neck – had not 
yet been invented. So Mary Webster must have had a tough neck, or possibly she 
was very thin. My grandmother sometimes said she was an ancestor of ours. (Her 
family name was Webster.) Mary Webster is also one of the people to whom The 
Handmaid's Tale is dedicated. Will I write more poetry like this? I don't 
know.. but you might also like "Marrying the Hangman," also based on a real 
woman, this time in early Quebec.

Post your questions for Margaret Atwood

After emerging in the early 1970s, Margaret Atwood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood> is sometimes dubbed a 
feminist writer. But while her explorations of female identity in the likes of 
Surfacing and Cat’s Eye are fierce, no one catch-all term can possibly sum her 
up.

She might equally be thought of as a science-fiction author, for her eerily 
possible fundamentalist dystopia in The Handmaid’s Tale and her futuristic Oryx 
and Crake trilogy, set in a world where genetic engineering has created a new 
type of human. She has written historical fiction, like the Booker-winning The 
Blind Assassin; she is also a poet, essayist, children’s author, librettist and 
inventor.

New novel The Heart Goes Last is similarly resistant to category. “Jubilant 
comedy of errors, bizarre bedroom farce, SF prison-break thriller, psychedelic 
60s crime caper: The Heart Goes Last scampers in and out of all of these 
genres,”wrote M John Harrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/23/the-heart-goes-last-margaret-atwood-review-novel>
 in the Guardian.

Atwood is joining us to answer questions about it and anything else in her 
career, in a live webchat from 1pm BST onwards on Monday 28 September. Post 
your questions in the comments below, and the ten that she deems the best will 
receive a signed ebook cover of the novel.

Hello: Offred herself can't know much about the genesis of the regime, so the 
meta-lecture fills us in; AND we know that the regime itself did not last. As 
for Offred, she got as far as Bangor, Maine, at least. Quite close to the 
Canadian border. And Maine itself was a famous rum-running destination in the 
30s, so smuggling possibilities abound. There's hope,.

I am a huge fan of your work and I have read almost all your short stories. 
However, in recent years I’ve been noticing a decline in short story 
publications – which saddens me, as they are my favourite form of literature. 
What do you think about this decline, and how do you feel about the form 
itself? What purpose does it serve you? Do you think the growth of online 
writing platforms have something to do with this decline? And do you have any 
recommendations of any short stories that are personal favourites?

Hello; thank you. Things are not fated to turn out wrong, and no one can

human tool is subject to misuse. This is a very powerful tool, and I am not

ongoing story with considerable interest! (Dry land crops, coming to the fore?)

When do you plan to quit lecturing Canadians about how our values are all

Hello; Thank you for your question. It raises some important issues. First, I 
don't confine myself to Canadians. I write in many countries. Second, I'd like 
to see the place where I said anything like 'we are all wrong if we don't agree 
with your personal viewpoints," etc. I am quite careful to reference polls that 
indicate how many Canadians support (for instance) PAS. Third, do you think 
that my having a readership should disqualify me from writing about matters of 
public interest? Oddly, many people take that as a reason why ~I should do it 
even more

In a liberal democracy, people should indeed feel they can say what they like. 
But a lot of people are constrained from doing that, partly because they fear 
for their jobs.

I'm currently writing a piece called "Cheated of Our Public Science." Our 
public scientists aren't allowed to speak to the public about their findings, 
even though the work for the public, in the public interest, and are paid by 
the public. They can't write such a piece themselves.Do you think it's only my 
personal political view that this is wrong? Do you think there should not be 
any public science, and that data should be generated (and lied about) by the 
likes of Volkswagen? Do you think I ought not to publish the piece?

The press is called The Fifth Estate for a reason. It is a key component in a 
liberal democracy. The fact that it exists has allowed you yourself to make 
this comment.

Hello: I think ISIS etc. are actually quite a bit worse; though same general 
floor plan, as it were. I have to say that I don't think the Gilead regime is 
Christian in any centrally meaningful sense of the term. Religious, yes; right, 
yes; but they do not love their neighbour as themselves, nor do they refrain 
from casting the first stone. I based the regime on history – nothing we 
haven't done, some time. some place. For more on that, see the Afterword in the 
book, as well as my essay on it in 'In Other Worlds: SF and the Human 
Imagination." I did visit Afghanistan in 1978... 6 weeks before the current 
cycle of wars and violence began.

In your recent essay in the Guardian, dated 19 September, you are talking 
about us “surrendering our hard-won freedoms too easily …” and that “digital 
technology has made it easier than ever to treat people like domesticated 
animals farmed for profit.” Because we leave a digital footprint wherever we go 
– a footprint we cannot escape because we have a social security card, a health 
card, a bank card and so on – shouldn’t we look to ourselves for the answers? 
We are making it easier for them by streaming all that information online – and 
the amount of information we reveal about ourselves voluntarily is stupefying. 
We reveal our phone numbers, birthdays, addresses, where we are, what we are 
doing, whom we are with, what we buy, what we eat, how much we spend and where 
we spend it. How and when did we become so gullible?

Hello: This subject has been hotly debated for years. If you are interested, 
there is an org called The Citizen Lab that tracks government use of internet 
tech to control citizens and spy on them – around the world. Yes, our use of 
anything digital does indeed make us vulnerable to tracking and spying, and in 
some cases to arrest and execution. But it has now become very difficult to buy 
anything, own anything, stay in a hotel etc, without the use of cards and 
passwords. So I'm not sure it's just our gullibility. We're being corralled 
into internet fenced areas, because that's so much more convenient for certain 
kinds of companies. Also, it's often convenient for us. NB you can download 
programmes such as Ghostery that let you know when you're being tracked. And 
you can install – for instance – a VPN, with companies such as Avast, that 
secure your transactions somewhat better. But spying itself is as old as the 
hills... it's just become easier, online. Hint: we could go back to writing 
letters. Though that was never foolproof, either.

The cat in your poem Blackie in Antarctica

Did you know – as I read in my vets book on cats – “that all vets know tom

Hello; Blackie was a real cat, as you may have gathered, but it was not I who 
put the doll's outfits on him. It was daughter and pals, age about 6. I myself 
did used to dress up my first cat, Perkolator, when I was @ 8. But she was a 
female cat. It is amazing how they put up with it, and dangerous for them if 
they ran away in the clothes... bonnet strings might have been treacherous. 
They may have thought of it as a kind of stroking. Attention was certainly 
being paid, in any case. (And I know, I shouldn't have done it.)

environment. Has there been any progress that makes you optimistic about our 
chances of survival? Something that impresses me tremendously about your books 
is that they make me imagine a future so precisely – and you so frequently draw 
upon fact and nature.

Hello; Funny you should mention it. If you look on the website Medium/Matter, 
you'll find a couple of things by me. One of them is called It's not Climate 
Change, it's Everything Change, which runs through some good and bad scenarios. 
The other is called The Carbonivore Fund, which is an imaginary fund with real 
tecchs in it; techs that remove carbon from the atmosphere. The list has got 
longer since I posted the piece. These are really hopeful. Enjoy.

Thank you for the MaddAddam trilogy – I loved it! Do you present us with 
dystopia because you’er a pessimist, or because you are an optimist and hope 
that by being presented with dystopia we will fight more forcefully for an 
utopia?

Hello: You're most welcome! I am actually a somewhat annoying optimist, though 
of course I call it "realism." I think one (or I, anyway) writes (or write) 
such books so people will think through the consequences of certain kinds of 
choices and then not make them. All too often, we make choices short-term and 
are then ambushed by the results. So yes, the books are a kind of "Don't go 
there." You'll notice however that I didn't kill everyone off at the end. I did 
not for instance go into the consequences of a deadened ocean and have them all 
choke to death for lack of oxygen. Now that's optimism!

Did you ever have a name in mind for Ofglen in The Handmaid’s Tale? In A-level 
English, we had discussed whether it could be June. There was a chapter that 
began with the handmaids sharing their names and we met all of those named 
characters, except for June. It’s something I’ve always wondered about! (I know 
the film version used Kate, which seemed wrong to me; as with so many 
adaptations, however, much of it did …)

Hello: I actually didn't, but the readers have pointed out the June 
connection, and it fits... so maybe her name is June. Well deduced, readers! I 
hadn't thought of that myself.

How did you feel about your name being on the International Baccalureate’s 
Prescribed List of Authors and about having A Handmaid’s Tale read by so many 
students all over the world who are studying English literature? My students 
here in Armenia would love to read your answer. You have a truly global 
readership in our school, as our students represent scores of different 
countries.

Hello to Armenia! several of my classmates in the 1950s at high school were 
from Armenian families. One of them (Greg Kasparian) was the school captain.
It is of course very flattering that The Handmaid's Tale has been taught in so 
many schools, and also in the International Baccalaureate programme. I think 
that happens because the book generates a lot of discussion among students. The 
government in it is totalitarian, so I would hope some of that discussion would 
be about how to to avoid such governments. They tend to come in during periods 
of extreme social upheaval.

 asks:

Will you ever construct a dark poem again – like the red-headed single woman 
of 1700s Salem, who’s accused of being a witch, is hung by the neck in her 
cherry orchard and defies all odds by living until morning – and therefore can 
no longer be accused of being a witch? She then collected black cats in earnest.

This beautifully twisted bit of work has changed my life forever. Whenever I 
am sad, I think of her, hanging all night in her orchard, quietly looking at 
the stars and thinking …

Will you please write more poetry?

You are such a creative genius.

Hello to everyone and thank you for your questions. I have chosen some of them 
for variety, but I hope to get around to more of them as well.
The poem sequence called "Half-hanged Mary" was based on a real person, Mary 
Webster, who was indeed left hanging all night and was still alive in the 
morning. This was possible because the drop – which breaks your neck – had not 
yet been invented. So Mary Webster must have had a tough neck, or possibly she 
was very thin. My grandmother sometimes said she was an ancestor of ours. (Her 
family name was Webster.) Mary Webster is also one of the people to whom The 
Handmaid's Tale is dedicated. Will I write more poetry like this? I don't 
know.. but you might also like "Marrying the Hangman," also based on a real 
woman, this time in early Quebec.

After emerging in the early 1970s, Margaret Atwood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood> is sometimes dubbed a 
feminist writer. But while her explorations of female identity in the likes of 
Surfacing and Cat’s Eye are fierce, no one catch-all term can possibly sum her 
up.

She might equally be thought of as a science-fiction author, for her eerily 
possible fundamentalist dystopia in The Handmaid’s Tale and her futuristic Oryx 
and Crake trilogy, set in a world where genetic engineering has created a new 
type of human. She has written historical fiction, like the Booker-winning The 
Blind Assassin; she is also a poet, essayist, children’s author, librettist and 
inventor.

New novel The Heart Goes Last is similarly resistant to category. “Jubilant 
comedy of errors, bizarre bedroom farce, SF prison-break thriller, psychedelic 
60s crime caper: The Heart Goes Last scampers in and out of all of these 
genres,”wrote M John Harrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/23/the-heart-goes-last-margaret-atwood-review-novel>
 in the Guardian.

Atwood is joining us to answer questions about it and anything else in her 
career, in a live webchat from 1pm BST onwards on Monday 28 September. Post 
your questions in the comments below, and the ten that she deems the best will
