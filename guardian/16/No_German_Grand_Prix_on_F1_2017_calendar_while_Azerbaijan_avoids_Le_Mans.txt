The German Grand Prix was formally dropped from the 2017 Formula One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> calendar on Wednesday, while the 
renamed Azerbaijan Grand Prix has been given a new date to avoid clashing with 
the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race.

The absence of a weekend in Germany was expected, with Hockenheim reluctant to 
host the race in successive years for financial reasons despite it being a home 
event for dominant Mercedes and the new champion, Nico Rosberg.

Races in Brazil and Canada, whose fate had also been left open on the draft 
calendar, were confirmed on a 20-race final version published by the governing 
FIA. Mexicoâ€™s race is again paired with the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, in 
October rather than with Brazil.
