Middlesbrough’s new signing, Rudy Gestede 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/04/middlesbrough-complete-signing-aston-villa-rudy-gestede-transfer>
, may have only played one match for his new team, but he has already set an 
unwanted record in thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>. The Benin forward now has 
the league’s longest winless streak – managing 32 games without victory. (He 
last won when Aston Villa beat Bournemouth 1-0 in August 2015.) But Gestede 
isn’t the only sportsperson to be ruing such a grim streak ...

Jack Rodwell


Last weekend also saw an unwanted tally for the Sunderland midfielder. Since 
he joined the club in 2014,Rodwell is yet to win a game in which he has started 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/01/15/winless-jack-rodwell-admits-must-tough-sunderland-fan/>
 – Sunderland’s defeat to Stoke on Saturday took this winless streak to 35 
games in all competitions.

Andy Murray

Sir Andy has reached the final of the Australian open five times since 2010. 
If he gets there again this year, it would be his third final in a row. 
Murray’s coach Ivan Lendl managed the same feat, losing in the final of the 
1982, 83 and 84 US Open. The good omen? Lendl won the next three in a row.

Robert Dee


The British tennis player lost his first 54 professional matches in a row 
without winning a single set. He couldn’t even win in the legal court – in 
2010, he took legal action against the Daily Telegraph for calling himthe 
“world’s worst” tennis player 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/feb/24/tennis-pro-sues-telegraph>. He 
lost <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8649779.stm>.

Franziska van Almsick


The German swimmer won her first four medals aged 14 at the 1992 Barcelona 
Olympics. But she holds the bittersweet record of most Olympic medals that 
aren’t gold: over four successive Olympic games, she won four silver and six 
bronze medals.

A veteran of seven Olympic Games but with no Olympic golds to her name, the 
sprinter won three silver and six bronze medals between 1980 and 2004. The
“Bronze Queen” 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20189-2004Aug20.html> lost in 
the 1996 100m final by five-thousandths of a second, and the 200m by 
12-hundredths of a second.

Gareth Bale

Bale failed to win in his first 24 appearances for Tottenham. But he finally 
broke his duck in 2009 two years after signing – only for the “Spurs flop” to 
soon be linked with a cut-price deal to Birmingham City. Things worked out 
alright. By 2013, he became the most expensive player in the world when he 
signed for Real Madrid. There’s hope yet for Gestede and Rodwell.

Michael Ballack (plus Bernd Schneider, Oliver Neuville and Carsten Ramelow) 


German footballer Ballack was part of Bayer Leverkusen’s “treble horror” 
season in 2002, when the team squandered a five-point lead in the Bundesliga 
with three games remaining, then lost the German Cup and Champions League 
finals in the same week, earning the team the nickname Neverkusen. For added 
schadenfreude, Ballack, AKA Mr Runner Up, was booked in the 2002 World Cup semi 
final against South Korea so missed the final against Brazil.The other three 
played 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/29/worldcupfootball2002.sport11>
. And lost …natürlich.
