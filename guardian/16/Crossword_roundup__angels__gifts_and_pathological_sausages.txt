The news in clues

If there’s a theme to this year’s festive clues so far, it is wariness of 
festivities, especially the food.Knut in the Independent

5d For starters, Christmas lunch puts up body mass index scale (5)
[ first letters (‘for starters’) of CHRISTMAS LUNCH, then abbrev. for ‘body 
mass index’ reading upwards (‘up’) ]
[ CL + reverse of BMI ]

... where the definition, “scale”, is really a verb: CLIMB. Incidentally, the 
rest of Knut’s puzzle is such an impressive execution of a topical theme that I 
presumed he had prepared it well in advance of the inevitable event it marks;
not so

challenging, just keep thanking your luck that Mad Dog is not there – and that 
he hasn’t brought PEOTUS with him.

In the Guardian, Pasquale (you can Meet the Setter here

) offereda different kind of festivity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27066#5-across>:

5ac Cook has little time left to join in ceremonial feast (7)
[ word for ‘cook’, containing abbrev. (‘little’) for ‘time’ and abbrev. for 
‘left’ ]
[ POACH, containing T and L ]

The POTLACH (or indeed POTLATCH) is a Native American festival which takes a 
different approach to gift-giving. In a potlatch, the more you give away, the 
better. Once upon a time, this involved feathers, butthe Oxford Dictionary of 
World Mythology 
<http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192177476.001.0001/acref-9780192177476-e-376?rskey=dGKlMi&amp;result=1>
 describes how things developed:

One chief might ‘shame’ another by destroying valuable pots, killing slaves, 
and burning down houses. If the other chief failed either to give away or to 
destroy more things, then he would lose public esteem.

An alternative to Secret Santa, there, for anyone looking for fresh ideas this 
season.

POTLATCH is also now used in English as a synonym for a “pot luck”

 party; other words we have borrowed from Native America are the Powhatan 
MOCASSIN, the probably Algonquin CAUCUS and the Narragansett subject of our 
next challenge. Reader, how would you clue POWWOW?

Clueing competition

Many thanks for your clues for FUD 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/dec/05/crossword-roundup-when-cryptics-literally-offer-an-escape-from-reality>
. Given the tone when the competition word doesnot mean “bottom”, I was merrily 
unastonished by entries such as Catarella’s “What starts farting under duvet?”, 
Robi23’s “Duffer half-raised seat”, GeoScanner’s “Fills up drawers first” and 
Jamesfarrier’s “Fluids oddly sometimes found here”.

The ingenuity award goes to ID2155366 for “End neighbours, etc.” where ETC 
leads to FUD as HAL might lead to IBM, and the audacity award could only be 
Schroduck’s for “Ð”.

The runners-up are Lizard’s timely “Bitter dispute in which front-runner from 
Eton’s lost seat” and JollySwagman’s pithy “In Freud’s case you get angst”; the 
winner is ComedyPseudonym’s lyrical “Head of fox and coypu’s rump, adder’s gut 
and rabbit’s stump”.

Kudos to Comedy; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
