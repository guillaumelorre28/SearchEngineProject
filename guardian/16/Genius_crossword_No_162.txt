The puzzle is a tribute to two people whose names appear in the completed 
grid. (There is a numerical connection between them.) X and two of his products 
are in a combination of solutions. Y appears step-wise; his nom de plume is 
formed by the first letters of solutions to the asterisked clues in reverse 
order. His best known product appears twice in the grid, once homophonically.
