What’s going for it? Don’t, don’t, don’t believe the hype. Or the opposite of 
hype, whatever that is. Streatham has a reputation. But so what. The reality is 
amazing. In the 1930s (geographically challenged) people called it the “West 
End of south London”. Streatham was glam. The High Road is still lined with art 
deco mansion blocks, former department stores and cinemas from the era ofClark 
Gable <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/22/clark-gable-screen-legend>. 
This was the main route toLondon’s airport at Croydon 
<http://www.croydonairport.org.uk/The-Airport/The-History> and, flying being an 
expensive affair back then, the glitterati purred through in their Wolseleys en 
route forDeauville

. You want more proof?Waitrose opened its first supermarket here!

Huge efforts have been made to reverse the reputation for crime Streatham 
attracted in the 80s. It’s worked. The neighbourhood’s golden ages have left it 
with homes high on its hill that’d be the envy of Hampstead, but without the 
snobbery.

The case against It has rather a large road running through it, and we can’t 
do much about that. Let’s run with it. Turn it into a boulevard. Plant trees.

Well connected? Very. Trains: three stations connect you to central London: 
Streatham Hill, Streatham and Streatham Common. Peckham, Croydon, Dulwich are 
all easily reachable, too. Driving: you can reach the M25 in 40 minutes.

Schools Good. Primaries: many “good”, Henry Cavendish

Hang out at… Spoilt for choice. I’m fond of the coffee at Boyce da Roca 
<https://www.facebook.com/boycedaroca>, the Lebanese lunches at Beyrouths 
<http://beyrouths.com/food/>, doughnuts from Thompson deli 
<http://www.thompsondeli.com/> and half a pound of cod from Fish Tale 
fishmongers <http://www.fishtale.co.uk/>.

Where to buy Streatham is long and straggly, the High Road following a ridge 
and roads falling down the valleys on either side. Homes are great; from late 
Victorian Arts and Crafts through fabulous Edwardians to art deco. Also mansion 
blocks on the High Road: noisy, but so elegant. Poshest are plush roads close 
to Tooting Bec Common, followed by theTelford Park estate 
<http://www.telfordpark.plus.com/>, around Streatham Common, then Furzedown 
<http://furzedown.net/> and Streatham Park <http://thrale.com/streatham_park>. 
Streatham Vale <http://hidden-london.com/gazetteer/streatham-vale/> is cheaper. 
Detacheds and town houses, £750,000-£3m. Semis, £500,000-£2m. Terraces and 
cottages, £450,000- £1.25m. Flats: £250,000-£800,000. Rentals: one-bed flat, 
£800-£1,500pcm; three-bed house, £1,500-£2,800pcm.

Bargain of the week Yes, I know it’s £895,000. But it’s a six-bedroom house.
