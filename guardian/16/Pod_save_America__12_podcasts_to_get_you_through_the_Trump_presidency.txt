The week after the 2016 US presidential election, the podosphere was full of 
black Americans expressing their fears for the future, diehard Democrats 
wondering what went wrong and rightwingers telling us what they had known all 
along. Listen widely enough – left, right and alt-right – and you get a true 
state of the nation address right in your earbuds. Here are a few of the 
political podcasts that will make you laugh, cry or hurl things at the wall – 
but above all, live through the next four years or more.

Left

Trumpcast <http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/trumpcast.html>


The podcast that was meant to end when Hillary Clinton was elected. But here 
we are, so Jacob Weisberg’s weekly pod endures, with Virginia Heffernan joining 
as co-host. Even if you think you can’t handle an entire 30 minutes devoted to 
the man described as ahuman Cheeto 
<http://gokicker.com/2016/06/16/heres-donald-trump-got-nickname-cheeto-jesus/>, 
this is undeniably entertaining stuff, with enough outside voices – whether 
it’s Pussy Riot’sMasha Gessen 
<http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/trumpcast/2016/06/masha_gessen_talks_about_the_parallels_between_trump_and_putin.html>
 ora psychologist explaining the signs of narcissistic personality disorder 
<http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/trumpcast/2017/01/is_there_any_fixing_donald_trump_s_personality.html>
 – to keep it fresh. Plus you get the uncanny impersonator John Di Domenico 
reading out the Cheeto-in-Chief’s unvarnished tweets.
Good for: media junkies.

 Raging but joyful … Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman of Call Your Girlfriend. 
Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow discuss the state of America while thousands of 
miles apart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/05/call-your-girlfriend-podcast-politics-pop-culture>
. Their long-distance chats range fromTrump’s dossier press conference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/11/donald-trump-media-cnn-buzzfeed-intelligence-agencies>
 to the “Kanye-Kardashian-Blac Chyna-Amber Rose octagon 
<http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/episodes/#/episode-42-twitter-ninja/>”. If 
you think there’s a dearth of women on political podcasts, you’re right. But it 
shouldn’t be so: they discuss the week’s news with a mix of anger and optimism, 
and interview female leaders in tech, media and politics (including Hillary’s 
right-hand woman,Huma Abedin 
<http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/episode-45-right-hand-woman/>). Plus, they 
put their money where their mouths are, advocating for women’s rights and 
cautioning against apathy. Raging but joyful rants between friends.
Good for: millennials, especially those they affectionately call “baby 
feminists”.

Last March, four former Obama aides went from the Oval Office to the podcast 
locker room, churning out chummy campaign analysis onKeepin’ It 1600 
<https://soundcloud.com/keepinit1600>. But as Trump moves into 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue, these well-connected politicos have just launched Pod Save 
America to usher in the new era. There will be Democratic soul-searching, 
shoptalk and the occasional dig at the “crooked media”.

FiveThirtyEight’s Political Podcast 
<https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/fivethirtyeight-podcasts/>

Predictions wizard Nate Silver has long been revered as a god among data 
scientists, but the many faithful might have wavered on 9 November when Silver’s
team owned up to their failure 
<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-missed-trump-we-asked-pollsters-why/>
 – and many others’ –to call the US presidential election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/election-polls-forecasts-probability-clinton-campaign-lost>
. But their analysis here of everything fromPutin to the midwest electoral 
college 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-looking-back-on-2016/>
(fun stuff, folks!) is full of context and colour. Following an especially 
heavy historical analysis of public opinion, one panellist concludes: “We still 
don’t want to get a beer with Russia!”
Good for: numbers nerds.

 Poignant … Still Processing. 
This weekly confab between Pulitzer-winning critic Wesley Morris and his 
friend and fellow New York Times writer Jenna Wortham is not, strictly 
speaking, all about politics. So what are they still processing? Being black in 
America, for starters. Also: queer life, anything inspiring/troublesome in pop 
culture, Beyoncé v Adele and more. Times colleagues make frequent appearances, 
and the duo also take the occasional field trip. (If ever there was the correct 
use of the word “poignant”, it would be to describe theirtour of the 
Smithsonian’s new National Museum of African American History and Culture 
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/podcasts/our-journey-to-the-blacksonian.html>
 – or the Blacksonian, as they dubbed it.)
Good for: critical thinkers.

Political Gabfest <http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gabfest.html>

A perennial favourite that rips through the week’s headlines with 
thoughtfulness and expertise, if not impartiality. New York Times writer Emily 
Bazelon, Face the Nation’s John Dickerson and former Slate editorDavid Plotz 
<https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/08/01/david-plotz-atlas-obscura-building-new-venture-national-geographic-vice/>
 face off on the senate (could they repeal Obamacare?), the supreme court and 
how to talk to your kids about Trump 
<http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gabfest/2016/10/talking_about_trump_and_politics_with_your_kids_on_slate_s_political_gabfest.html?wpsrc=sp_all_native_index>
 (“can you say sexual assault”?). The panel often swerves off course, too, 
recently addressing the time-old question: “Would you rather marry Ted Cruz or 
Tom Cruise?” They decided both are “odious”.
Good for: anoraks.

’s explainer show about the history of the US supreme court is storytelling at 
its finest. More Perfect explores key cases – complete with archive clips – 
such as the origins of the phrase “cruel and unusual punishment”. (Fun fact: 
60% of Americans think the death penalty is neither a cruel nor unusual 
punishment for murder.)

Right

The Sean Hannity Show <https://www.iheart.com/show/51-The-Sean-Hannity-Show/>

Beware the host who refers to himself in the third person: “A lot of people 
will say, well, Hannity, you’ve changed your views on Julian Assange,” says
rightwing radio’s Sean Hannity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/news-blog/2016/oct/22/wikileaks-clinton-leaks-julian-assange-sean-hannity-david-duke>
 at the start of hisinterview 
<https://www.iheart.com/show/51-The-Sean-Hannity-Show/?episode_id=27900292> 
with the WikiLeaks publisher. Assange comes across as a zen master compared to 
the amped-up Hannity, who never heard an opinion of his own he didn’t like. If 
you’re left-leaning and want to find out what mainstream rightwingers are 
thinking, start with his New Year’s Eve best-of 2016 show.
Good for: lefties willing to pop their own filter bubble.

 ‘Maha-Rushi’ … Rush Limbaugh. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP 
Miss the nails-on-chalkboard sound of talk radio? Then meet the man Obama 
personally took to task on his way out of the White House 
<https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/ta-nehisi-coates-obama-transcript-ii/511133/>
 on this rapid-fire edit of his daily syndicated radio show. Expect shouty 
monologues about climate scientists (“who believe global warming issettled 
science”), the “Obama regime” and George Lucas. (After Lucas’s museum plans in 
Chicago fell through, Limbaugh said: “Lucas is going back to deal with the 
wackos in California – better the land of fruits and nuts than the liberal evil 
empire [of] Chicago.”) Someone give the man a soapbox. Oh wait …
Good for: misanthropes.

Common Sense with Dan Carlin 
<http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page>


The host of the popular Hardcore History pod kicked off the post-election 
dispatch <http://www.dancarlin.com/product/common-sense-311-trumped/> of this, 
his second podcast, on 10 November with a hushed monologue, as if recording in 
his closet, mouth close to the mic, and has something he just needs to get off 
his chest. Turns out, this self-described “political martian” isn’t rightwing 
so much as no wing, and he doles out his contrarianism equitably to left, right 
and centre, first hat-tipping Michael Moore for astute election 
predictioneering, then later warning: “Populism is a vitamin that you need but 
you could overdose on 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/15/wild-populism-long-history-us-politics-trump-surely-unique>

The Savage Nation <http://www.michaelsavage.wnd.com/>

How can you make America great again? Buy Michael Savage’s book and download 
his podcast, of course! He’s a frontiersman in the new political wilderness: 
“Long before Donald Trump was even known in America as a political force, his 
policies were being laid out by me.” With the manner of a hectoring 
schoolmaster, Savage can sermonise for a good hour about Obama (AKA “the 
Snake”), “neocon ventriloquists”, “trannies in the military” – and why you 
should buy his book. This podcast also contains “psychological nudity”. Oh 
dear. So what does Savage’s mind look like buck naked? Consider the manic start 
to one recent episode: “I can’t believe how many calls I got yesterday from 
women about how they suppress their sex drive. The best call of yesterday, by 
the way –don’t worry, I’m going to get to Obama sending troops to the Russian 
border 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/doubts-over-biggest-us-deployment-in-europe-since-cold-war-under-trump>
. I predicted it last Friday … I told you the Snake could do that, in order to 
upset the world order and try to spark a world war.” Pretty sure Savage Nation 
isn’t satire, but one can’t be sure.
Good for: Michael Savage.
