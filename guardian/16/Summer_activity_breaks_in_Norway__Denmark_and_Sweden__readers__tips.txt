Winning tip: Spectacular bike/train trip, Norway


Take the scenic 2½-hour train journey from Bergen to Finse, the highest 
railway station in Norway (1,222 metres), which is close to the 
Hardangerjøkulen glacier, the film location for the planet Hoth in The Empire 
Strikes Back. From there hire a bike from Finse 1222 and spend the rest of the 
day biking Rallarvegen or the postal road. You’ll climb 100 metres in rocky 
high mountain landscape surrounded by glaciers before descending 1,300 metres 
(and 33 miles) to sea (or fjord) level, past waterfalls, through forested 
valleys and fjord farm landscapes to the town of Flåm. Drop the bike off in 
Flåm and return to Bergen by ferry, train or bus, or continue to Oslo.

 A king crab caught on a RIB tour from Kirkenes 
A fantastic way to see the Varangerfjord in the Arctic Circle in northern 
Norway is to take a trip on a fast RIB on to the fjord out of Kirkenes, 
followed by a spot of king crab fishing. You return to shore to cook and eat 
the fresh crab. All wet-weather gear is provided and the skipper has 
interesting information about the history of the region. It’s not an 
inexpensive trip but it’s a fun and exhilarating way to spend three hours. We 
thought it was one of the best things we’ve ever done and if you love seafood 
this is definitely something to do if visiting Norway’s far north.

Raudmelen mountain hike, Norway

 Photograph: katharinaphotography.com 
<http://www.katharinaphotography.com/portfolio/adventures/> 
One of the most spectacular but still accessible hikes in the famous Sognefjord
 <http://en.sognefjord.no/> region is this route up 972-metre Raudmelen (a 
six-hour round trip). The views of mountains, fjords, towns and glaciers are 
incredible. The walk starts in thick forest but soon you are on moss-covered 
tracks; as you near the top you may well encounter patches of snow even in 
summer. An extraordinary experience.

 Reine village withrorbuer cabins on Moskenesøya island. Photograph: Alamy 
For the most breathtaking landscapes (with, unfortunately, breathtaking prices 
too) I recommend Norway’s Lofoten archipelago. I’ve visited only in the greener 
months so far. May brings snow-free lower elevations but if you’re a hiker 
you’ll very quickly be walking across white landscapes and need to take care 
due to melting and small avalanches. So aim for June to September. Kayaking and 
fishing should be possible too, but check your dates as the season is short and 
popular. Buses and ferries can get you around but plan ahead. As for where to 
stay, I suggest magnificent Moskenesøya island, where there is theLofoten Å 
hostel <https://www.hihostels.com/hostels/lofoten-a> (twin bed private room 
from $71) androrbuer fishermen’s cabins 
<http://www.classicnorway.com/hotels/reine-rorbuer/the-rorbu-cabins/> (sleeping 
2-6, from about £145).

Taking in the sights on a kayak from the water is much more relaxing than 
using the busy roads, and it’s not so dear. There are plenty of canals around 
the city and you’ll get unusual views of the city centre, Christiania, and the 
opera house. We used Kayak Republic, located by a floating beach and cafe in 
Børsen. The company offers guided trips, too, with double kayaks.

Building our own timber log raft was a real family team exercise: our 
13-year-old became the knots and rope expert, the 15-year-old provided the 
brawn and the eight-year-old verbally supervised. Once it was constructed 
(overseen by instructors from Nature Travels) we had seven days to float down 
the Klarälven river, enjoying wildlife, fishing, swimming and relaxing. Each 
night brought the excitement of finding the perfect camping spot in a grassy 
dell or spotless beach and the opportunity to explore using the Canadian canoe 
that we towed behind the raft. There were challenges: extracting the raft from 
overhanging branches using a folding saw, trying to stop a two-tonne raft by 
wrapping a rope around a tree on shore and holding tight. But these all added 
to the adventure.

 Cycling in Båstad. Photograph: Alamy 
From Båstad, we cycled from our house exchange holiday stay along the coast 
for about two hours to Torekov. From there we took the ferry across to the 
island of Hallands Väderö, a beautiful place with a small beach hut serving as 
a cafe on the east side and a lighthouse on the west side. There are many 
little bays where you can swim in, believe it or not, warm water, during the 
summer, which was amazing. Also there’s lots of wildlife on the island due to 
the low impact of humans. It truly was a great day trip along the coastal cycle 
path, with great views of the sunset in the evening when we were cycling back 
to Båstad.

Floating sauna near Uppsala, Sweden


Just outside Uppsala, around one hour north of Stockholm, lies the picturesque 
outdoor adventure area of Fjällnora. Here you can swim, rent kayaks or go 
fishing in the summer or go ice skating on the frozen lake in the winter. Best 
of all is the floating sauna, which is amazing all year round. In the summer 
the feeling you get gazing at the huge blue skies and scenery reflected in the 
lake as the traditional wood-fired sauna warms you through is wonderful. In the 
winter, after your sauna, you can plunge in to the lake through a hole carved 
in the ice (or climb carefully down the steps) if you are so inclined. There 
are barbecue pits dotted all over with wood provided, so take sausages for 
dinner.

 Hiking near Blåhammar. Photograph: Alamy 
Two hours’ drive from the Norwegian city of Trondheim is one of Sweden’s 
best-kept secrets: Blåhammar mountain. A 10km trail (20km round trip), starting 
from Storvallen or Storulvån, takes you across plains covered in heather and 
bracken. Following the lines of sticks to guide skiers in the deep snow, you 
can pick wild cloudberries to keep your energy up, and marvel at wild reindeer 
reflected in glassy mountain lakes. The view from the top of Blåhammar makes it 
well worth the hike. Stop in the smallfjällstation rest stop at 1,086 metres 
for a cup of energising blueberrysöppa and rest for a few minutes on the 
Scandinavian pine benches before the hike back down to civilisation. There is a 
train fromTrondheim to Storlien 
<https://en.rail.cc/storlien/train-connection/l/12802#rail>, which is 4km from 
Storvallen.
