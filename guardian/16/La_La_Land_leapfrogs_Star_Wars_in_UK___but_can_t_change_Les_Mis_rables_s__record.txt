Golden Globe-winning musical La La Land has opened strongly at the UK box 
office, taking well over £6m in its first weekend to dominate the charts. No 
other film comes close, withRogue One: A Star Wars Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story> in second place 
on £1.8m – though the latter film is in its fifth week of play.

Director Damien Chazelle’s homage to the Hollywood musical, which stars Ryan 
Gosling and Emma Stone, is distributor Lionsgate’s widest ever UK release, with 
606 screens. It proved justified, as the film achieved a site average over £10K 
after near-universal rave reviews. However, it still fell short of the record 
figures for a musical achieved by Les Misérables,which opened in 2013 with 
£8.12m

In a stark measure of their comparative commercial strengths, one of La La 
Land’s chief awards-season rivals, Manchester By the Sea, also opened this 
week. With a much lower site count, Kenneth Lonergan’s widely admired grief 
drama performed respectably, landing at No 6 with £0.73m. It recorded the 
second best site average of the week – just under £5K – but it was less than 
half of La La Land’s.

Having risen to the top of the 2016 list,

 Rogue One has moved to 12th on the list of highest grossing films of all time 
at the UK box office, having overtaken 2003’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return 
of the King with this week’s earnings, to reach £62.7m in total. Next in its 
sights: The Fellowship of the Ring, which finished on £63m in 2001. Rogue One’s 
continuing strength is in sharp contrast with Assassin’s Creed, whose takings 
dropped by more than 80% to take it to No 4 on its second week, after debuting 
at No 1.

Live By Night, Ben Affleck’s gangster flick, performed a little better on its 
UK release after flaming out in the US: it managed to reach No 7 in the chart 
with a not-especially-impressive £0.69m. But this must have seemed like manna 
from heaven after its dismal expansion in the US last week, where it failed to 
break into the Top 10 despite playing on over 2,800 screens. Conversely, horror 
film The Bye Bye Man, which roundly defeated Live By Night in the US, trickled 
to No 9 in the UK. There was even less interest in Underworld: Blood Wars, the 
fifth instalment in the gothic horror franchise featuring Kate Beckinsale; 
despite solid US figures and chart placing (it opened at No 4), it only made No 
11 in the UK, with a wide-ish 260 screen schedule.
