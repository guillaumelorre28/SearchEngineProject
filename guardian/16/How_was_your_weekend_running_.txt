Another weekend, another outing to Croydon. This time the Surrey League XC for 
me - and another two laps of the muddy, err, delight that is Lloyd Park. Having 
been dreading it all week, and mentally making molehills into mountains, I was 
actually pleasantly surprised. The hills weren’t nearly as hilly as last week, 
the mud wasn’t really any muddier despite a week of rain and snow. Amazing how 
the mind can trick you - or perhaps, rather, I really must have been feeling 
under the weather last week. Saturday’s finish even bought a bit of a snow 
flurry, which perversely seems entirely right for a cross country race.

My new year’s resolution to do more strength and conditioning is also going 
well, thanks mostly to theTRX 
<https://www.trxtraining.co.uk/?gclid=CM7b5cG2xtECFUcQ0wodGeIP9Q> device in our 
attic. Many gyms now have them and I highly recommend if you have the 
opportunity to give it a go. For something that looks pretty innocuous, they 
really do give a full body workout, as my rather feeble shoulders and arms 
often tell me the next day. I need, though, to fetch the kettlebells in from 
the soggy garden to do some more weight-based work. So lets give the resolution 
a B-plus for now.

So, who else was running in the mud and snow and rain this weekend? My long 
run yesterday included some - for me - quite nimble leaps as I attempted to 
dodge the massive puddles along the towpath, and avoid being sprayed by passing 
cars on the roads. Looking outside, it seems I’m probably in for more of the 
same later today ...
