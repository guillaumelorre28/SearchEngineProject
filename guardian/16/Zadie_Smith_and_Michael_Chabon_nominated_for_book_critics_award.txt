Ann Patchett, Michael Chabon <https://www.theguardian.com/books/michael-chabon>
 and Zadie Smith are among the nominees for the National Book Critics Circle 
awards in the US.

Books by Louise Erdrich and the former US poet laureate Robert Pinsky were 
also among 30 finalists in six categories (autobiography, biography, fiction, 
nonfiction, poetry and criticism) selected by the organisation yesterday.

Margaret Atwood <https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood>, the 
Canadian author of novels including The Handmaid’s Tale and Cat’s Eye, will 
receive a lifetime achievement prize. Honorary awards will go to Yaa Gyasi for 
best debut novel, Homegoing, and Guardian writer Michelle Dean for excellence 
in reviewing. The winners will be announced on 16 March.

Patchett’s Commonwealth, Chabon’s Moonglow and Smith’s Swing Time were all 
fiction finalists, along with Erdrich’s LaRose and Adam Haslett’s Imagine Me 
Gone.

Smith was among a select few writers who had lunch this month with the 
outgoing US president Barack Obama, the New York Times reported. It added that 
Obama talked to the novelists “about the political and media landscape, but 
also talked shop, asking how their book tours were going and remarking that he 
likes to write first drafts, long hand, on yellow legal pads”.

Last year, the winner of the fiction prize was Peter Beatty for his novel The 
Sellout
