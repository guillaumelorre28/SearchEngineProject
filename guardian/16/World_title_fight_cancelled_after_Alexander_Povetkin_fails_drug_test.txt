A heavyweight title fight between Russian boxer Alexander Povetkin and the 
Haiti-born Canadian Bermane Stiverne that was scheduled for Saturday has been 
cancelled after Povetkin failed a drug test.

Povetkin’s promoter Andrei Ryabinsky wrote on Twitter that the Russian boxer 
had tested positive for the banned muscle-building substance ostarine.

Povetkin was to fight Stiverne for the World Boxing

“They found ostarine in Sasha,” Ryabinsky wrote on Twitter, using the Russian 
diminutive form of the name Alexander. “It’s not clear where it came from.”

The WBC president, Mauricio Sulaiman, said on Twitter the WBC was withdrawing 
recognition of the Povetkin-Stiverne fight owing to Povetkin’s drug test.

Russian media reported Povetkin’s team had tried to persuade Stiverne to go 
ahead with the fight despite the failed test but Stiverne had refused.

A doping test Povetkin gave in April showed traces of meldonium, though a 
repeat test returned a negative result, Ryabinsky said.

Povetkin missed out on a title bout with Deontay Wilder of the United States 
after testing positive for meldonium.

On that occasion the WBC accepted Povetkin’s explanation he had stopped taking 
the substance before it was banned for 2016.
