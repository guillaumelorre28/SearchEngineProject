Playing such an incredibly intense, demanding role such as Antigone must be 
thoroughly exhilarating, and, at times, exhausting. Do you find the stage a 
more satisfying venue for exploring these characters, given that you have the 
gift of a longer run to deepen things and find out about your character anew 
each night - and how does portraying equally fascinating people on screen feel 
different?

It is exhausting but I can't stop it! The Greeks are relentless but the need 
of telling those myths are part of my JOY and HONOUR!

Frivolous question - I’ve always been intrigued by that moment in the cafe in 
Three Colours where you tip the espresso over the vanilla ice cream. Does the 
result taste good?

Hi Juliette, I met you and Kiéslowski once at film festival in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil. I just said hi :) didn’t know much English and you were extremely nice, 
it was the movie Blue at festival. I worked at a video store at the time, and I 
was only 17. I love Kieslowski’s movies. The combination in Blue of you and 
Kiéslowski’s work was unspeakable. It’s a masterpiece due to your so intense, 
sincere, yet daring acting. To this day I watch Blue hundred times – I am able 
to see and feel all the rollecaster of emotions, and you barely had any 
dialogue in the movie. Have you found a director like him that can yank pretty 
much all of you? Or “Julie” is you?

The story. Unfortunately I think that my character in the editing was not 
really understood, also they made a decision on focusing on the daughter and 
father's relationship.

In Chocolat you play a French woman who lives and works in France.....yet she 
speaks English all of the time. How does this make you feel? Do you feel 
embarrassed at the silliness of this strange situation? Do you feel altruistic 
in helping non-French speakers understand a French-set story easily? Or are 
your feelings somewhere in-between?

The story of Chocolat is universal enough to go beyond the language in my 
opinion. It didn't bother me to play in English as a French character in this 
film:

Enlightening? Recently I read Symbolism of the Human Body of Annick de 
Souzennelle, that will come out in Autumn in English. Reading this book was a 
real strong experience because she goes through the whole body, feet to head, 
in giving different significations throughout different Traditions. She uses 
the Sephirot Tree in order to follow a possible evolution.

"Regret is not a feeling I live with"

LiamR <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/346779> asks:

Is there an film you did that you wish you hadn’t? Or if that is a silly 
question, is there an opportunity you turned down which you wish you hadn’t?

Regret is not a feeling I live with. I did make mistakes but I hope I learned 
from them. Usually the difficulties make you feel more what you need and what 
you don't need. It allows you to grow and really follow your intuition. Making 
choices from your head is never a good choice but being in touch with your 
heart, no matter what mistakes you've made, you will never regret it.
When you see a film that has been acted by another actress and that is very 
well acted - I have always experienced joy. Because great art makes you feel 
better. It never diminishes you.
I went through times that were not always easy but I have always tried to be 
in a creative mode through theatre, films, painting or dance. When you make 
that choice, there is no need of jealousy.

When I read the script of L'Attesa I was touched by the story first and I met 
with the first-time director Piero Messina who had an intense presence and 
watched his short film where I could see he had a strong sense of vision. It is 
always risky to do a first feature film but it was worth risking this film with 
him. And now that we are selected in competition in the Venice film festival I 
think I didn't make a mistake! I loved Sicily and always feel very frustrated 
when I leave because I feel that I never have enough time to really know places 
where I film because I am so busy with the work. I have been so busy in 
Edinburgh but this morning I have found someone to do a house swap with so I 
can come back and visit with my family. I want to do the same thing in Sicily.

I've been working throughout my career in different ways and I love to renew 
my approach to the work at every single experience. It makes me more alive. For 
Sils Maria I worked with this wonderful American coach, Susan Batson, to 
prepare as the role was difficult and wordy. The production and the director 
didn't allow me to have a language coach which was a challenge for me but I had 
an assistant, Lara, who really helped me to go through the dialogue. To try and 
answer your question about the Method ... I've always been interested in all 
methods. And I've been inspired by a lot of approaches. Starting with a 
sensation and a memory is always feeding your presence in front of the camera 
but I love to use the imagination as well, and your own personal "plugs". For 
example, while I'm playing Antigone, I made a special relationship with La 
Duse, who was an amazing Italian stage actress at the beginning of the 20th 
century, and who influenced the acting at the time. She always started with her 
heart and the need of nakedness, rawness and truth was coming out of the pores 
of her skin. So the transmission of acting can happen in many different ways - 
you have to invent your own!

"Three Colours Blue was one of the most joyful experiences I've had on a movie 
set"

As Soluzione <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14608709> says:

Perhaps it’s not a question (unless you wish to expand on your performance and 
Kieslowski as a director), but by chance I watched Three Colours Blue last week 
and I was once again reminded of how remarkable as an actress you truly are

Well thank you! As an actor, when you have a director who is so clear in his 
way of filming, when you have a DP who knows so well how to film, when you have 
great actors and a crew that is present in the work then good can only come out 
of you! The theme of the film was particularly close to my heart because one of 
my best friends had lost a child, and husband and I dedicated this film to her 
and her child. Again, it was one of the most joyful experiences I've had on a 
movie set. I think what deepens my performance is the way that Krzysztof edited 
the film by adding, at the end of the scene, a black screen so that the 
audience would have time to take in what is happening inside of my character. 
For Krzysztof, the editing was the key for directors because they didn't have 
to bother with actors and the crew and the weather! He was alone, free, and 
could give the right rhythm of the story.

Hey Juliette, also on a Michael Haneke tip, another of my favourite films is 
Code Unknown. Can you tell us a little about your experiences of working with 
him on that one?

Code Unknown is one of my favourite films - and for Haneke as well. So I am 
happy that you are asking about this particular film! It shows how cowardly we 
can be in everyday basic life. The contrast between the western way of thinking 
and poorer countries. It was my first time working with Haneke and I was blown 
away by his ability to see what was happening in an actor - it was as if he was 
scanning me! He himself experienced acting in different workshops so he knows 
how difficult it is but also he knows the journey that the actor goes through 
so he can really get inside of the performances with details and knowledge. It 
was a very joyful shooting and that's why we did Hidden together afterwards.

Hi Juliette. For me, one of your most brilliant and nuanced performances is in 
Hidden (Caché). What’s your understanding (or interpretation) of the ending, 
i.e the final scene, of that film?

As you know, Haneke does not like to give answers but likes to have the 
audience think for themselves and make their own judgment. That is why I never 
try to resolve the dilemma! Not having an answer makes you think even more 
about different possibilities. A film is not always to resolve a dilemma but to 
open your mind through it and put you in touch with your own feelings.

Post your questions for Juliette Binoche

After a successful European tour, Juliette Binoche 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliette-binoche> is playing Sophocles’ 
tragic heroine Antigone at the Edinburgh international festival in Ivo van 
Hove’s production, which was broadcast earlier this year by the BBC. It’s one 
of the festival’s hottest tickets and Binoche’s Antigone joins her long list of 
striking characters including Julie Vignon in the Three Colours trilogy, Vianne 
Rocher in Chocolat, and her Oscar-winning turn as Hana in The English Patient.

As well as her forays into Hollywood (Godzilla, Dan in Real Life), she has 
given unforgettably intense performances in some of the most celebrated 
European films of recent years such as Michael Haneke’s Hidden and Bruno 
Dumont’s Camille Claudel 1915.

Juliette will join us in Edinburgh to answer your questions in a live webchat 
from12 noon BST on Wednesday 12 August. Post them in the comments below, and 
she’ll answer as many as possible.

Goodbye all! Thanks for your questions and I hope to continue the conversation 
another time. Au revoir!

You can see her in Antigone at the King’s Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> in Edinburgh, as part of this 
year’s international festival. Many thanks to her and for everyone’s questions.
 
FionaAByrne <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15230086> asks:

Playing such an incredibly intense, demanding role such as Antigone must be 
thoroughly exhilarating, and, at times, exhausting. Do you find the stage a 
more satisfying venue for exploring these characters, given that you have the 
gift of a longer run to deepen things and find out about your character anew 
each night - and how does portraying equally fascinating people on screen feel 
different?

Hi Juliette, I met you and Kiéslowski once at film festival in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil. I just said hi :) didn’t know much English and you were extremely nice, 
it was the movie Blue at festival. I worked at a video store at the time, and I 
was only 17. I love Kieslowski’s movies. The combination in Blue of you and 
Kiéslowski’s work was unspeakable. It’s a masterpiece due to your so intense, 
sincere, yet daring acting. To this day I watch Blue hundred times – I am able 
to see and feel all the rollecaster of emotions, and you barely had any 
dialogue in the movie. Have you found a director like him that can yank pretty 
much all of you? Or “Julie” is you?

The story. Unfortunately I think that my character in the editing was not 
really understood, also they made a decision on focusing on the daughter and 
father's relationship.

In Chocolat you play a French woman who lives and works in France.....yet she 
speaks English all of the time. How does this make you feel? Do you feel 
embarrassed at the silliness of this strange situation? Do you feel altruistic 
in helping non-French speakers understand a French-set story easily? Or are 
your feelings somewhere in-between?

The story of Chocolat is universal enough to go beyond the language in my 
opinion. It didn't bother me to play in English as a French character in this 
film:

Enlightening? Recently I read Symbolism of the Human Body of Annick de 
Souzennelle, that will come out in Autumn in English. Reading this book was a 
real strong experience because she goes through the whole body, feet to head, 
in giving different significations throughout different Traditions. She uses 
the Sephirot Tree in order to follow a possible evolution.

Regret is not a feeling I live with. I did make mistakes but I hope I learned 
from them. Usually the difficulties make you feel more what you need and what 
you don't need. It allows you to grow and really follow your intuition. Making 
choices from your head is never a good choice but being in touch with your 
heart, no matter what mistakes you've made, you will never regret it.
When you see a film that has been acted by another actress and that is very 
well acted - I have always experienced joy. Because great art makes you feel 
better. It never diminishes you.
I went through times that were not always easy but I have always tried to be 
in a creative mode through theatre, films, painting or dance. When you make 
that choice, there is no need of jealousy.

What was the thing you enjoyed the most about filming in Caltagirone and what 
attracted you to L’attesa in the first place?

When I read the script of L'Attesa I was touched by the story first and I met 
with the first-time director Piero Messina who had an intense presence and 
watched his short film where I could see he had a strong sense of vision. It is 
always risky to do a first feature film but it was worth risking this film with 
him. And now that we are selected in competition in the Venice film festival I 
think I didn't make a mistake! I loved Sicily and always feel very frustrated 
when I leave because I feel that I never have enough time to really know places 
where I film because I am so busy with the work. I have been so busy in 
Edinburgh but this morning I have found someone to do a house swap with so I 
can come back and visit with my family. I want to do the same thing in Sicily.
 
Jill Barker <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13787720> asks:

Do you think that your character in Clouds of Sils Maria is a method actor? 
And if so, did she choose to use the method earlier as well as later in life?

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/57363096> 
I've been working throughout my career in different ways and I love to renew 
my approach to the work at every single experience. It makes me more alive. For 
Sils Maria I worked with this wonderful American coach, Susan Batson, to 
prepare as the role was difficult and wordy. The production and the director 
didn't allow me to have a language coach which was a challenge for me but I had 
an assistant, Lara, who really helped me to go through the dialogue. To try and 
answer your question about the Method ... I've always been interested in all 
methods. And I've been inspired by a lot of approaches. Starting with a 
sensation and a memory is always feeding your presence in front of the camera 
but I love to use the imagination as well, and your own personal "plugs". For 
example, while I'm playing Antigone, I made a special relationship with La 
Duse, who was an amazing Italian stage actress at the beginning of the 20th 
century, and who influenced the acting at the time. She always started with her 
heart and the need of nakedness, rawness and truth was coming out of the pores 
of her skin. So the transmission of acting can happen in many different ways - 
you have to invent your own!

Well thank you! As an actor, when you have a director who is so clear in his 
way of filming, when you have a DP who knows so well how to film, when you have 
great actors and a crew that is present in the work then good can only come out 
of you! The theme of the film was particularly close to my heart because one of 
my best friends had lost a child, and husband and I dedicated this film to her 
and her child. Again, it was one of the most joyful experiences I've had on a 
movie set. I think what deepens my performance is the way that Krzysztof edited 
the film by adding, at the end of the scene, a black screen so that the 
audience would have time to take in what is happening inside of my character. 
For Krzysztof, the editing was the key for directors because they didn't have 
to bother with actors and the crew and the weather! He was alone, free, and 
could give the right rhythm of the story.

Hey Juliette, also on a Michael Haneke tip, another of my favourite films is 
Code Unknown. Can you tell us a little about your experiences of working with

Code Unknown is one of my favourite films - and for Haneke as well. So I am 
happy that you are asking about this particular film! It shows how cowardly we 
can be in everyday basic life. The contrast between the western way of thinking 
and poorer countries. It was my first time working with Haneke and I was blown 
away by his ability to see what was happening in an actor - it was as if he was 
scanning me! He himself experienced acting in different workshops so he knows 
how difficult it is but also he knows the journey that the actor goes through 
so he can really get inside of the performances with details and knowledge. It 
was a very joyful shooting and that's why we did Hidden together afterwards.
 
LlivracNhoJ <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4089168> asks:

Hi Juliette. For me, one of your most brilliant and nuanced performances is in 
Hidden (Caché). What’s your understanding (or interpretation) of the ending, 
i.e the final scene, of that film?

As you know, Haneke does not like to give answers but likes to have the 
audience think for themselves and make their own judgment. That is why I never 
try to resolve the dilemma! Not having an answer makes you think even more 
about different possibilities. A film is not always to resolve a dilemma but to 
open your mind through it and put you in touch with your own feelings.

Hello all of you! Welcome to the webchat. We are in the attic of the Hub in 
Edinburgh with a beautiful view. Here we go...

If you have one for her, put it in the comments below...
 
After a successful European tour, Juliette Binoche 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliette-binoche> is playing Sophocles’ 
tragic heroine Antigone at the Edinburgh international festival in Ivo van 
Hove’s production, which was broadcast earlier this year by the BBC. It’s one 
of the festival’s hottest tickets and Binoche’s Antigone joins her long list of 
striking characters including Julie Vignon in the Three Colours trilogy, Vianne 
Rocher in Chocolat, and her Oscar-winning turn as Hana in The English Patient.

As well as her forays into Hollywood (Godzilla, Dan in Real Life), she has 
given unforgettably intense performances in some of the most celebrated 
European films of recent years such as Michael Haneke’s Hidden and Bruno 
Dumont’s Camille Claudel 1915.

Juliette will join us in Edinburgh to answer your questions in a live webchat 
from12 noon BST on Wednesday 12 August. Post them in the comments below, and 
she’ll answer as many as possible.
