The role of the Guardian’s global readers’ editor

The readers’ editor is the Guardian’s internal ombudsman. The job of the 
readers’ editor is “to collect, consider, investigate, respond to, and where 
appropriate come to a conclusion about readers’ comments, concerns, and 
complaints in a prompt and timely manner, from a position of independence 
within the paper”.

Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s fourth readers’ editor and took up the role in 
June 2016. Paul, journalist and lawyer, was director editorial policies at the 
Australian Broadcasting Corporation, where he was responsible for reforming the 
broadcaster’s self-regulatory framework.
