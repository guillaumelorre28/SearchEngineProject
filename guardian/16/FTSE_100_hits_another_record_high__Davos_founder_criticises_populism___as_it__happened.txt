European markets edge higher

While the FTSE 100 was breaking new records, European markets were more 
subdued but still managed to end the day in positive territory, for the most 
part. The final scores showed:

 * Germany’s Dax added 0.17% to 11,583.30 
 * France’s Cac closed up just 0.01% at 4888.23 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.33% to 19,424.19 
 * But Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.43% at 9452.0 
In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 42 points or 0.2% 
at 19,929, heading back towards the 20,000 barrier.

Meanwhile after its recent falls, the pound is currently flat against the 
dollar at $1.2160 and up 0.1% against the euro at €1.1511.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

FTSE 100 hits unprecedented 9th record closing high

The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high for the ninth day running, breaking a 
record which has stood for nearly 20 years.

The index finished up 0.53% at a new peak of 7275.47, bettering the eight day 
winning streak recorded in May 1997 as Tony Blair’s Labour won the general 
election.

The FTSE 250 has closed at 18,413, also a record high.

As markets continue to climb - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in 
positive territory and just under 60 points away from the 20,000 level - Joshua 
Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

The FTSE 100 has again had an outstanding day, with the index gaining from the 
first minute to the last as it reached new all-time highs once more. The fact 
that we are seeing the index hit these new highs in such a fearless manner says 
a lot about the potential for further gains. Interestingly we have seen both 
[President elect] Trump and [UK prime minister} May providing positive news for 
the respective US and UK indices, yet for very different reasons. While Trump 
has boosted US stocks by setting out a positive outlook for the future, the 
strength of the FTSE has been largely down to the pound devaluation associated 
with fears over a hard Brexit outcome.

Back with the markets, and the FTSE 100 is well on course to break two records 
- a new closing peak and the longest run of closing highs. With a winning 
streak of nine consecutive end-of-day peaks, this would beat the previous 
record set in May 1997.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

With the pound still at 2 month to 10 week lows (even if it did manage to 
shrink much of today’s losses), the miners boosted by data from China [factory 
gate inflation] and the supermarkets led higher by Morrisons impressive 
Christmas performance the FTSE has plenty of support this Tuesday..[This] sees 
the index set to break the record for most consecutive days of new all-time 
closing highs, a record that has lasted for just shy of 20 years.

Wall Street opens lower

As investors await the US reporting season to see if company results justify 
the heady heights the stock market has reached, leading shares have edged lower 
in early trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came perilously close to the elusive 
20,000 barrier on Friday, has shied further away from that level. It is 
currently down 27 points or 0.13% at 19,860.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both slipped marginally at the open.

Back in the markets, the pound has pulled out of today’s slide and is now flat 
against the US dollar at $1.217.

It’s still down slightly against the euro though, at €1.149.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the recovery could be temporary...

Monday was a bit like Deja-Vu for currency traders, and a keen reminder of how 
politics can play havoc with a currency.Sterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> declined to its lowest level 
since October as political fears and the Brexit premium started to bite.

The pound has managed to claw back some losses on Tuesday, but it remains at 
risk from a further decline in sentiment.

This year’s Davos will certainly be different, thanks to the Brexit vote and 
Donald Trump’s election victory.


Attendees will be pondering whether populist forces will triumph in elections 
in Germany, France and the Netherlands this year, and president Trump’s views 
on climate change, financial regulation and global inequality.

So it’s no surprise that Klaus Schwab, who created WEF decades ago, is no fan 
of populism.

But, of course, those ‘populist’ forces are no fans of Davos either!

CNBC’s Matt Clinch has a good take:

In a nod to this current mood, this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) is 
titled “Responsive and Responsible Leadership” and its official agenda 
describes a “weakening of multiple systems” that has eroded confidence and 
speaks of a possible “downward spiral” fuelled by protectionism, populism and 
nativism.

Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. president on January 20 will overshadow 
the event but it’s hard to see how every conference, bilateral meeting or 
roundtable in Davos won’t include some reference to this political upheaval, 
which the conservative news aggregation site The Drudge Report calls the “new, 
new world order”.

Indeed, some critics have attacked the event itself as being a reason why U.S. 
citizens started to question globalization and contemplate the negative impacts 
it’s had on some parts of Western nations.

CNBC: The ‘party of Davos’ wakes up to the new, new world order 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/09/davos-wakes-up-to-the-trump-new-world-order.html>

Bloomberg’s Matthew Campbell and Albertina Torsoli agree that China will be 
one of the big issues at WEF next week.

They explain:

The most high-profile guest by far will be Chinese president Xi Jinping, the 
first sitting Chinese leader to attend the event. He’s heading a 
larger-than-ever delegation of business executives from the world’s 
second-biggest economy, underscoring China’s determination to assume a global 
leadership role as other major powers are hobbled by domestic infighting.

China’s two richest citizens, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BABA:US> founder Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda 
Group Co. Ltd <https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0489737D:CH> CEO Wang Jianlin, 
will join him and appear in solo on-stage interviews. China’s deepening 
engagement with the world will, meanwhile, be the subject of a discussion on 
“China’s Role for Global Prosperity,” in which stock-market regulator Fang 
Xinghai and state-assets chief Xiao Yaqing will appear alongside Lloyds of 
London Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale.

Chinese president Xi’s first visit to Davos, next week, is an important 
opportunity to strengthen relations between China and the rest of the world, 
says argues WEF founder Klaus Schwab.

Schwab tells the WEF press conference 
<https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017> that 
Xi Jinping will attend with a set of top officials and businesspeople, at a 
time when its economic power is as important as ever.

Since I first visited China in 1979, we have developed a very close 
relationship, close presence in China.

We are all aware that we are now in transition to a multi-polar geo-political 
and geo-economic structure.

China will equal the United States soon for economic power. And I foresee that 
President Xi will show how China will assume a responsive and responsible 
leadership role in global affairs.

Schwab also reiterates that populism won’t make the world a better place 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/10/brexit-worries-pound-low-ftse-record-high-city-business-live?page=with:block-5874e1efe4b0c0afac91f54a#block-5874e1efe4b0c0afac91f54a>
.

We are living in a very complex world. All the issues are interrelated....

There are no simple answers to the challenges that we have. So what we have to 
do in Davos is show how complicated the situation is.

Davos founder: Populism isn't the answer

Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum are getting ready for their 47th 
annual meeting, which begins next Monday.

A lot has happened around the world since the 46th get-together, and much will 
have shocked the CEOs, government leaders and other heavy-hitters who trek to 
the ski resort each year.

WEF founder Klaus Schwab and colleagues are holding a pre-meeting press 
conference now (it’s online here 
<https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017>).

Schwab says this year’s meeting must make progress towards tackling the 
world’s problems - and argued that the rising tide of populism isn’t the answer.

Every simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned 
to fail.

We cannot just have populist solutions.

The problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically 
are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic 
approach....and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, 
united in one mission - improving the state of the world.

Schwab also singled out the challenge created by the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution (the new wave of automation and robotics), and pointed out that 
Chinese premier President Xi Jinping will address Davos for the first time.

Over in Italy, two people have been arrested for allegedly hacking into the 
email accounts of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, former prime 
ministers Matteo Renzi and Mario Monti, and thousands of others.

We don’t know what information was obtained, or what it was used for, but it 
will only intensify the focus on cybersecurity.

Reuters has the details:

“There were tens of thousands of email accounts hacked, and among them were 
accounts belonging to bankers, businessmen and even several cardinals in the 
Vatican,” Roberto Di Legami, director of the specialised cyber police unit that 
conducted the investigation, told Reuters.

Police have sequestered a server in Rome containing thousands of files, but 99 
percent of the data was stored in the United States, Di Legami said. The 
information will be shipped back in coming days but it will take some time 
before it can be analysed.

Pound's woes continue

While the FTSE 100 hits fresh highs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/10/brexit-worries-pound-low-ftse-record-high-city-business-live?page=with:block-5874c143e4b0710de27b80f0#block-5874c143e4b0710de27b80f0>
, the pound is on track for its worst three-day run sin October.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> is now down 0.2% at 
$1.214, adding to Monday’s 1% slide, and keeping it at a 10-week low against 
the US dollar.

It’s also at two-month lows against the euro, down 0.25% at €1.147.

These aren’t big moves, of course, but it does bring the pound rather close to 
its weakest level against the dollar since the alarming ‘flash crash’ of early 
October, which is $1.2080.


This chart from City expert David Jones shows how the pound’s rally in 
November has now unravelled:

Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says the uncertainty around 
Brexit is overshadowing the fact that UK economic data has been better than 
expected.

He writes:

“The pound’s lowly performance this week took a sharper hit, reaching fresh 
10-week-lows, owing largely to dimming hopes for a ‘soft’ Brexit. The key issue 
being the taut stance of EU over free-movement and its effect on the prospects 
of a single market access deal for the U.K. Selling pressure on the pound is 
expected to stay until further details are revealed in the coming weeks.

On the bright side, the economy is still defying expectations as it continues 
to persist on the momentum from 2016 and a lower pound has positively affected 
exports. Modest economic growth figures ideally mean that the BoE cannot afford 
to increase interest rates anytime in the near future – such indicators 
normally strengthen the pound, however, the Brexit clamour seems to be the sole 
driver of the current narrative.”

FTSE 100 on track for record-breaking run

Britain’s FTSE 100 is on track to post its longest run of record highs since 
it was created in 1984.

After another morning of gains, the blue-chip index is up 30 points at 7268, 
an new intraday high.

Partly thanks to the weak pound, the FTSE has closed at a record high for the 
last eight days running. It’s gained 8% since the start of December:

So if the rally holds, the FTSE 100 will close at a record high for the ninth 
day running.

This would smash the previous record set in 1997 after Tony Blair won a 
landslide general election victory.

Mining companies are now leading the rally, helped by optimism about economic 
growth next year. The strong Christmas trading figures from Morrison’s are 
pushing supermarkets shares higher too.

While the FTSE 100 was breaking new records, European markets were more 
subdued but still managed to end the day in positive territory, for the most 
part. The final scores showed:

 * Germany’s Dax added 0.17% to 11,583.30 
 * France’s Cac closed up just 0.01% at 4888.23 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.33% to 19,424.19 
 * But Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.43% at 9452.0 
In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 42 points or 0.2% 
at 19,929, heading back towards the 20,000 barrier.

Meanwhile after its recent falls, the pound is currently flat against the 
dollar at $1.2160 and up 0.1% against the euro at €1.1511.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high for the ninth day running, breaking a 
record which has stood for nearly 20 years.

The index finished up 0.53% at a new peak of 7275.47, bettering the eight day 
winning streak recorded in May 1997 as Tony Blair’s Labour won the general 
election.

The FTSE 250 has closed at 18,413, also a record high.
 
As markets continue to climb - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in 
positive territory and just under 60 points away from the 20,000 level - Joshua 
Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

The FTSE 100 has again had an outstanding day, with the index gaining from the 
first minute to the last as it reached new all-time highs once more. The fact 
that we are seeing the index hit these new highs in such a fearless manner says 
a lot about the potential for further gains. Interestingly we have seen both 
[President elect] Trump and [UK prime minister} May providing positive news for 
the respective US and UK indices, yet for very different reasons. While Trump 
has boosted US stocks by setting out a positive outlook for the future, the 
strength of the FTSE has been largely down to the pound devaluation associated 
with fears over a hard Brexit outcome.
 
Back with the markets, and the FTSE 100 is well on course to break two records 
- a new closing peak and the longest run of closing highs. With a winning 
streak of nine consecutive end-of-day peaks, this would beat the previous 
record set in May 1997.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

With the pound still at 2 month to 10 week lows (even if it did manage to 
shrink much of today’s losses), the miners boosted by data from China [factory 
gate inflation] and the supermarkets led higher by Morrisons impressive 
Christmas performance the FTSE has plenty of support this Tuesday..[This] sees 
the index set to break the record for most consecutive days of new all-time 
closing highs, a record that has lasted for just shy of 20 years.

As investors await the US reporting season to see if company results justify 
the heady heights the stock market has reached, leading shares have edged lower 
in early trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came perilously close to the elusive 
20,000 barrier on Friday, has shied further away from that level. It is 
currently down 27 points or 0.13% at 19,860.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both slipped marginally at the open.
 
Back in the markets, the pound has pulled out of today’s slide and is now flat 
against the US dollar at $1.217.

It’s still down slightly against the euro though, at €1.149.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the recovery could be temporary...

Monday was a bit like Deja-Vu for currency traders, and a keen reminder of how 
politics can play havoc with a currency.Sterling

since October as political fears and the Brexit premium started to bite.

The pound has managed to claw back some losses on Tuesday, but it remains at 
risk from a further decline in sentiment.
 
This year’s Davos will certainly be different, thanks to the Brexit vote and 
Donald Trump’s election victory.


Attendees will be pondering whether populist forces will triumph in elections 
in Germany, France and the Netherlands this year, and president Trump’s views 
on climate change, financial regulation and global inequality.

So it’s no surprise that Klaus Schwab, who created WEF decades ago, is no fan 
of populism.

But, of course, those ‘populist’ forces are no fans of Davos either!

CNBC’s Matt Clinch has a good take:

In a nod to this current mood, this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) is 
titled “Responsive and Responsible Leadership” and its official agenda 
describes a “weakening of multiple systems” that has eroded confidence and 
speaks of a possible “downward spiral” fuelled by protectionism, populism and 
nativism.

Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. president on January 20 will overshadow 
the event but it’s hard to see how every conference, bilateral meeting or 
roundtable in Davos won’t include some reference to this political upheaval, 
which the conservative news aggregation site The Drudge Report calls the “new, 
new world order”.

Indeed, some critics have attacked the event itself as being a reason why U.S. 
citizens started to question globalization and contemplate the negative impacts 
it’s had on some parts of Western nations.

Bloomberg’s Matthew Campbell and Albertina Torsoli agree that China will be 
one of the big issues at WEF next week.

They explain:

The most high-profile guest by far will be Chinese president Xi Jinping, the 
first sitting Chinese leader to attend the event. He’s heading a 
larger-than-ever delegation of business executives from the world’s 
second-biggest economy, underscoring China’s determination to assume a global 
leadership role as other major powers are hobbled by domestic infighting.

<https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BABA:US> founder Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda 
Group Co. Ltd <https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0489737D:CH> CEO Wang Jianlin, 
will join him and appear in solo on-stage interviews. China’s deepening 
engagement with the world will, meanwhile, be the subject of a discussion on 
“China’s Role for Global Prosperity,” in which stock-market regulator Fang 
Xinghai and state-assets chief Xiao Yaqing will appear alongside Lloyds of 
London Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale.

Chinese president Xi’s first visit to Davos, next week, is an important 
opportunity to strengthen relations between China and the rest of the world, 
says argues WEF founder Klaus Schwab.

Schwab tells the WEF press conference 
<https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017> that 
Xi Jinping will attend with a set of top officials and businesspeople, at a 
time when its economic power is as important as ever.

Since I first visited China in 1979, we have developed a very close 
relationship, close presence in China.

We are all aware that we are now in transition to a multi-polar geo-political 
and geo-economic structure.

China will equal the United States soon for economic power. And I foresee that 
President Xi will show how China will assume a responsive and responsible 
leadership role in global affairs.

Schwab also reiterates that populism won’t make the world a better place 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/10/brexit-worries-pound-low-ftse-record-high-city-business-live?page=with:block-5874e1efe4b0c0afac91f54a#block-5874e1efe4b0c0afac91f54a>
.

We are living in a very complex world. All the issues are interrelated....

There are no simple answers to the challenges that we have. So what we have to 
do in Davos is show how complicated the situation is.
 
Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum are getting ready for their 47th 
annual meeting, which begins next Monday.

A lot has happened around the world since the 46th get-together, and much will 
have shocked the CEOs, government leaders and other heavy-hitters who trek to 
the ski resort each year.

WEF founder Klaus Schwab and colleagues are holding a pre-meeting press 
conference now (it’s online here 
<https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017>).

Schwab says this year’s meeting must make progress towards tackling the 
world’s problems - and argued that the rising tide of populism isn’t the answer.

Every simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned 
to fail.

We cannot just have populist solutions.

The problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically 
are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic 
approach....and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, 
united in one mission - improving the state of the world.

Schwab also singled out the challenge created by the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution (the new wave of automation and robotics), and pointed out that 
Chinese premier President Xi Jinping will address Davos for the first time.
 
Over in Italy, two people have been arrested for allegedly hacking into the 
email accounts of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, former prime 
ministers Matteo Renzi and Mario Monti, and thousands of others.

We don’t know what information was obtained, or what it was used for, but it 
will only intensify the focus on cybersecurity.

Reuters has the details:

“There were tens of thousands of email accounts hacked, and among them were 
accounts belonging to bankers, businessmen and even several cardinals in the 
Vatican,” Roberto Di Legami, director of the specialised cyber police unit that 
conducted the investigation, told Reuters.

Police have sequestered a server in Rome containing thousands of files, but 99 
percent of the data was stored in the United States, Di Legami said. The 
information will be shipped back in coming days but it will take some time 
before it can be analysed.

, the pound is on track for its worst three-day run sin October.

Sterling <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> is now down 0.2% at 
$1.214, adding to Monday’s 1% slide, and keeping it at a 10-week low against 
the US dollar.

It’s also at two-month lows against the euro, down 0.25% at €1.147.

These aren’t big moves, of course, but it does bring the pound rather close to 
its weakest level against the dollar since the alarming ‘flash crash’ of early 
October, which is $1.2080.


This chart from City expert David Jones shows how the pound’s rally in 
November has now unravelled:

Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says the uncertainty around 
Brexit is overshadowing the fact that UK economic data has been better than 
expected.

He writes:

“The pound’s lowly performance this week took a sharper hit, reaching fresh 
10-week-lows, owing largely to dimming hopes for a ‘soft’ Brexit. The key issue 
being the taut stance of EU over free-movement and its effect on the prospects 
of a single market access deal for the U.K. Selling pressure on the pound is 
expected to stay until further details are revealed in the coming weeks.

On the bright side, the economy is still defying expectations as it continues 
to persist on the momentum from 2016 and a lower pound has positively affected 
exports. Modest economic growth figures ideally mean that the BoE cannot afford 
to increase interest rates anytime in the near future – such indicators 
normally strengthen the pound, however, the Brexit clamour seems to be the sole 
driver of the current narrative.”
 
Incidentally, the FTSE 100 could also set its longest run of daily gains since 
2009 today -- as well asthe lengthiest stretch of record highs ever

Britain’s FTSE 100 is on track to post its longest run of record highs since 
it was created in 1984.

After another morning of gains, the blue-chip index is up 30 points at 7268, 
an new intraday high.

Partly thanks to the weak pound, the FTSE has closed at a record high for the 
last eight days running. It’s gained 8% since the start of December:

So if the rally holds, the FTSE 100 will close at a record high for the ninth 
day running.

This would smash the previous record set in 1997 after Tony Blair won a 
landslide general election victory.

Mining companies are now leading the rally, helped by optimism about economic 
growth next year. The strong Christmas trading figures from Morrison’s are 
pushing supermarkets shares higher too.
