Police won’t confirm, but several media outlets are reporting a body found in 
a car in Kenthurst on Thursday is that of Robinson, and a Facebook page set up 
to raise awareness about Robinson’s disappearance has made a post confirming 
his death.

The post on the “Let’s find Chad” 
<https://www.facebook.com/findchad/posts/2193955484162040> page read: “It’s 
with a heavy heavy heart that we can confirm that Chad’s body has been found 
this afternoon. There are no words for our whole families loss and especially 
his two beautiful kids. Thank you everyone one of you for your support the last 
few week. Brother you were the world to all of us, I can’t imagine life without 
you, but you are free, fly high my beautiful brother.”

The car was parked near the intersection of Marieba and Porters roads about 
12:30pm when the body was found by electricity workers. Police say there are no 
apparent suspicious circumstances but a post-mortem examination will be 
conducted to determine the cause of death.

The former Parramatta Eels and Sydney Roosters player had not been seen for 
almost a month after he left his house with no shoes, phone or wallet. His 
family described the disappearance as utterly out of character and made 
impassioned pleas for help from the public.
