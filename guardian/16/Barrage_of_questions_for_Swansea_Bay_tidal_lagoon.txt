’, 13 January) that the Swansea Bay scheme “would be the first of its kind in 
the world”. In France, theRance estuary plant 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgwspUPLafQ> has been operating since 1966. In 
Canada, in the Bay of Fundy, which has the highest tides in the world, the 
plant atAnnapolis Royal 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis_Royal_Generating_Station> has been 
operating since being opened by Prince Charles in 1984. However, the French 
have no firm plans for more such plants and the Canadians have abandoned them 
altogether. In Canada, a major consideration has been the devastating impact on 
fish stocks.

It seems to me that the major objective of the proposal might be to extract 
taxpayer funding for no useful purpose, and the government needs to study the 
proposals very carefully to ensure we do not end up with a number of very large 
white elephants in the Severn estuary.

• In 1981 a report on tidal power from the Severn estuary by Sir Hermann Bondi 
<http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1982/feb/15/severn-estuary-tidal-power-the-bondi>
 calculated that an inner barrage alone could have generated as much 
electricity (12.9 TWh a year) as a potential series of tidal lagoons. While 
this could have been up and running within 14 years of starting construction, 
additional lagoons would add baseload to this reliable supply, given the 
natural differences in the times of tides sweeping around the coast of Britain.

Back then the Central Electricity Generating Board was wedded to nuclear 
power, when the projected cost per kWh was on a par with the Rance tidal power 
station in Brittany, and Électricité de France assumed it was twice as 
expensive as nuclear power, instead of turning out to be cheaper. The 
ecological impact was negligible; a reduced tidal range would still expose 
plenty of mudflats where wading birds could feed twice a day, and studies found 
that the biodiversity of the Rance estuary soon returned.

• Your report on the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon proposals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/10/government-review-swansea-bay-tidal-lagoon-electricity>
 (10 January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/10/government-review-swansea-bay-tidal-lagoon-electricity>
) does not mention that the output from such tidal lagoons drops to zero twice 
every 24 hours. This could be compensated if tidal generation were to be linked 
toCANDU-type <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor> nuclear reactors. 
The heavy water these reactors need could be generated by tidal power in 
periods of slack electricity demand. The reactors would provide power to the 
grid at the daily periods of zero tidal output and in general in accordance 
with grid requirements. If this route were to be taken, the economics of a full 
Severn barrage, with its maximum output some 25 times that of the Swansea Bay 
scheme, might well be worth reconsideration.
