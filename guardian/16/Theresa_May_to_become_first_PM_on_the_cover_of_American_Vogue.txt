Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> is to become the 
first British prime minister to feature on the cover of American Vogue.

The cover was orchestrated, in secret, by editor Anna Wintour. The cover shot 
of May was taken last week by esteemed photographer Annie Leibovitz at 
Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat.

May’s magazine spread will appear in the April edition of Vogue, which goes on 
sale in March.

While Margaret Thatcher appeared several time in British Vogue

, May is the first prime minister to appear on the cover of the US edition of 
the fashion magazine.

May has been very open about her love of fashion and a recent article in Vogue 
praised her bold fashion choices, including leopard-print kitten heels and 
statement jewellery, saying she was already “pushing the boundaries of prime 
ministerial attire.”

Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/23/may-be-may-be-not-home-secretary-gives-little-away-on-desert-island-discs>
, May chose a lifetime subscription to Vogue as her luxury item.

But May’s fashion choices have also landed her in hot water. A photoshoot for 
the Sunday Times magazine pictured her wearing designer leather trousers

 which cost a reported £995, which prompted criticism from Conservative MP 
Nicky Morgan, who said: “I don’t have leather trousers. I don’t think I’ve ever 
spent that much on anything apart from my wedding dress.”
