1 Riverside granary, Mannheim

This city is best-known as the home of big-brand industry, but it’s not 
without its selling points: its rich cultural scene saw it named a Unesco City 
of Music in 2014.Speicher7 is a converted riverside granary, where perks 
include a yoga and meditation room and a cocktail bar. Try a Mannheim mule: dry 
Bavarian gin with ginger beer and lime.

Saxony’s second city once had the poet Goethe in raptures, and its more recent 
“New Berlin” tag shows its appeal is enduring. The stylish 20-roomFregehaus 
hotel is in a 16th-century townhouse and makes a great base: it’s just steps 
from the Museum of Fine Arts. Rooms, on four floors around a courtyard, are 
smart without being overblown.

The name Hüttenpalast – which translates loosely as “hut palace” –gives some 
idea of what to expect from Berlin’s most idiosyncratic accommodation option. 
It’s a former vacuum cleaner factory in the hip Neukölln district and offers 
“rooms” in a range of converted vintage caravans and repurposed huts in an 
indoor setting among fake grass and fairy-lit silver birches. If you’re keen on 
a bit more space, there are standard rooms too.

The Libertine Lindenberg in the city’s unrushed Alt-Sachsenhausen district is 
a new, well-priced all-suite hotel that feels genuinely different. It does away 
with the traditional reception desk – who needs ’em? – and focuses on 
home-from-home design, hand-made furnishings and a communal living 
room-cum-cafe. Suites range from one to three bedrooms, with short-term guests 
welcome. There’s even an in-house recording studio. It’s well placed for 
enjoying the neighbourhood’s numerous hostelries, known forapfelwein (“apple 
wine” – essentially German cider).

Open since early 2015, Hamburg’s first all-vegan bed and breakfast, Green Haven
, has only three rooms (one of them a single), as well as a trailer for two and 
an apartment for three. Owner Christiane has gone big on charm – most of the 
furniture is upcycled – and there’s a large living room. Breakfasts are an 
extra €5, although organic supermarket Alantura is a five-minute walk away for 
self-caterers. It’s in the Wandsbek district, eight minutes by train from 
central Hamburg.

Cologne’s Belgian Quarter is arguably its most fashionable and cosmopolitan. 
Having escaped wartime bombing, it’s also one of the prettiest, and home to
Hopper Hotel Et Cetera, a smart boutique hotel. The property was once a 
monastery: the floor-to-ceiling altarpiece mural in the restaurant (pictured) 
is a nod to the fact that the space was once a chapel. Rooms are bright and 
sleek. A suite with roof terrace costs from €160.

A prime location in Munich doesn’t have to mean within staggering distance of 
the Hofbräuhaus. Family-runHotel Stadt Rosenheim is some distance from the main 
tourist honeypots, but still has a plum address almost opposite the Ostbahnhof 
transport hub in Haidhausen, a residential district full of cafes, bars and 
independent shops. It has 51 modern rooms in a neo-renaissance building. Free 
soft drinks and a local-produce breakfast add to the attraction.

The windswept North Sea island of Sylt is part of the Frisian archipelago on 
the Danish border, and the 10-roomLong Island House hotel is a place to hunker 
down for a few days of beach walks, sun loungers and lazy breakfast buffets. 
There’s a vintage, Hamptons feel to the property, hence the name. There’s also 
a large garden, but if the weather turns nippy: the rooms all have heated 
floors. The island is reached by train from Hamburg.

The relaxed island of Fehmarn, off Schleswig-Holstein’s Baltic coast, is 
statistically one of the sunniest spots in the country. At only half the size 
of the Isle of Wight, it’s no mass-market getaway, but attracts windsurfers and 
birdwatchers in healthy numbers. In the south-west corner of the island,Haus 
Achtern Diek is a bright, caringly run six-room guesthouse in a prime seaside 
location.

Since taking it over in late 2014, the owners of Landhaus Esperort, an old 
coastal manor house, have turned it into the kind of cosy sanctuary that a 
north European seaside break cries out for. The rooms have a tasteful maritime 
feel, and there’s a steam bath and Finnish sauna. Ahrenshoop, a fishing 
settlement on the Fischland-Darss-Zingst peninsula, became an artists’ colony 
in the late 1800s and still draws an alternative crowd.

A three-storey fin-de-siècle building reborn as roomy apartments with 
minimalist decor and exposed beams,Villa Albatros is a modish option on the 
Baltic island of Usedom, once a favourite of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Its sweeping 
beaches are still peered over by grandiose resort buildings, and its eastern 
half is actually in Poland.

There’s nothing fancy about Pension zur Post: rooms are fresh, clean and 
well-priced, and it runs yoga and meditation workshops. The real draw is its 
location. Car-free Hiddensee island is all wind-blasted heathland and 
lighthouse-dotted beachscapes. There are numerous bike-hire outlets, though 
don’t expect to be pedalling all day – the island is just 18km long, by less 
than two wide.

On the edge of Rothenburg’s hilly old town, the 15-room Burg-Hotel has 
spectacular views across the vineyards and woods of the Tauber valley. Rooms, 
on five floors, are spacious and individually designed, and many have 
four-poster beds. The breakfast room sits 80 metres above the valley floor, 
adding extra pep to your morning coffee. There is a small wellness area.

transfers to a trail along the Saale river can also be arranged. Rooms are

Germany has a surprising number of baumhaushotels (treehouse hotels), and this 
one in north-east Hesse is one of the more eye-catching. Open since 2014,
Baumhotel Robins Nest comprises three wooden treetop houses, a stilted cabin 
and a geometrically pleasing “tree ball” – a triangular-panelled sphere 
suspended from the canopy. The larger houses sleep four, and the cabin eight. 
It’s all in the grounds of a 15th-century castle, and hanging rope bridges help 
give the place a feel of the Ewok forest from Star Wars.

Ignore the unprepossessing name of the Schittlerhaus. This family-run 
apartment hotel is at the foot of the Allgäu Alps in the south-west, and its 
panoramic setting is complemented by seven classy apartments and one smaller 
guest room. It’s been in the same family – yes, the Schittlers – since opening 
in 1953, but feels far from dated. The local peaks are great for both summer 
hiking and winter sports. Munich is about two hours away by car.

Uhlenköper Camp in Lower Saxony is green in more ways than one. The shower 
block, restaurant and on-site shop run on solar power, while the well-sized 
swimming pool is chlorine-free. While there is space for tents and campervans, 
it also offers a six-person tipi and two “sleep barrels” – cylindrical wooden 
cabins for families of up to four. The surrounding countryside is particularly 
impressive in August and September, when its abundant beds of heather blush a 
glowing purple. Kayaks can be hired for trips on the nearby river.

Less than 90 minutes from the finance towers of Frankfurt, the 50-room 
BollAnts im Park isn’t cheap – but you’ll soon see why. To describe it as a 
high-end spa hotel would be to rather do it down. Not content with having 2,000 
square metres of saunas, pools and treatment suites, it also has a dreamy 
valley setting, broad gardens and three top-notch restaurants, one of which has 
a Michelin star. Yoga retreats are offered too.
