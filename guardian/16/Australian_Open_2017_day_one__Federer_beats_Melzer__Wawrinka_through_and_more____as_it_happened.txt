Bouchard is hanging in here, against a massively improved Louisa Chirico. The

Bouchard eventually finds a volleyed winner to earn match point.

That leaves only one match still in progress, and Chirico is serving to stay 
in that one, at 3-5 in the second.

Federer speaks:

It’s nice to be playing tennis again, on a centre court like this. It was a 
long road but I made it. I’m in the draw, which is a beautiful thing. I just 
hope I can stick around for a bit. Any match is a good match. Even if I’d lost 
today it would have been good, because I’m back on the court. I’ve been living 
something of a normal life, having really good times, catching up with friends 
and family.

Roger Federer beats Jurgen Melzer 7-5, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2

The No17 seed isn’t playing like a No17 seed, that’s for sure. Noah Rubin of 
the USA is next in his sights.

Melzer, trying to chase down a lob, tries to hit the ball back through his 
legs, fails, and it’s match point.

Chiroco has improved immeasurably in the second set: no double faults, 
compared with two in set one, 74% of first serves have gone in, compared with 
69%, and 17 points have been won, compared with seven. She’s even got a break 
point. She needs to win it, though: she’s 4-1 down in the second set.

And Federer follows that by breaking Melzer’s serve, and is starting to 
disappear off into the distance.

Talking of 2-1 leads, Federer has one of those in the fourth set of his match 
against Melzer. He’s been helped by some ridiculous serving: there have already 
been six aces in the set, three in each of his service games so far.

Now Chirico has taken her next service game to deuce. She’s won as many points 
in her first two service games of set two as she did in the entirety of set 
one. She’s still lost one of them, though, and Bouchard leads 2-1.

Federer’s back! He really is! This is beautiful stuff, and Melzer has no 
answer to it, as with the Austrian serving to stay in the third set the former 
No1 streaks into a 0-30 lead, and then narrowly misses a ludicrous attempted 
backhand half-volley lob. A short masterclass in variety and accuracy later, 
it’s two sets to one.

Surprisingly, given that they’re both 35 and have an awful lot of tennis under 
their belts, and that they played three times in 2010 alone, Melzer and Federer 
have met only four times in all. Melzer has won once, in their most recent 
meeting, in the quarter-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters in 2011. All their 
previous meetings were won in straight sets.

Melzer earns a set point, only for Federer to save it with a gorgeous 
backhand. He earns another, and this time the Swiss overcooks his backhand, and 
it’s a set apiece: 5-7, 6-3.

Melzer, meanwhile, hasn’t just broken back, he’s double-broken-back. From 3-1

a set apiece.

That was brilliantly entertaining stuff. Klizan was very, very close to an 
upset, and trudges off after three hours and 24 minutes of very impressive but 
ultimately futile effort wondering about ifs, buts and maybes. He hit some 
absolutely wondrous forehands in that match.

Ouch! A lengthy and vicious rally ends with Klizan at the net, hitting a weak 
half-volley to midcourt. Wawrinka steams in and absolutely thrashes the ball 
straight into his opponent, who has given up on the point and is just standing 
there watching, only to get struck just above the knee by a bullet forehand.

From 40-15 at my last update, Wawrinka has won three points in a row and now 
holds break point. This is super stuff.

That’s a great rally, won by Klizan with a forehand of unsurprising power but 
beautiful depth, and Wawrink digs it out but can’t get it in. 40-15.

The drama is coming on the Margaret Court Arena, where Klizan lets out a roar

Darcis has indeed wrapped up the win on Court 8, and goes through to play 
Diego Schwartzman in round two. The winner of that match, for fans of long-term 
planning, plays the winner of Seppi v Kyrgios in the third round, and the 
winner of that one is seeded to face Wawrinka in the fourth, though of course 
Klizan (and various others) might have something to say about that.

The last match outside the two main showcourts looks like it’s about to end, 
with Australia’s Sam Groth staring defeat very much in the face. Steve Darcis 
leads 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 5-2 and is serving for the match.

There’s been a break in the Federer match, meanwhile, and it’s gone to Melzer! 
He leads 4-2, but is labouring a bit in his next service game, which is at 
deuce.

Bang! At 40-0 on the Wawrinka serve, Klizan nails a thunderbolt down-the-line 
forehand return winner. Phwoar! He kisses his racket in semi-comic gratitude.

And Klizan serves it out, with Wawrinka moaning about someone in the crowd 
shouting at a vital moment with the score 15-15. From there it’s over pretty 
quickly, with an ace - Wawrinka challenges, forlornly - and a smashed winner.

The first few games of the Federer match are all terribly brief and go with 
serve. Meanwhile on Margaret Court, Klizan is serving for the fourth set.

Kerber holds serve for 2-2, but not without drama. She had to save a break 
point, and Tsurenko nailed her return as well, only for Kerber to send a 
do-or-die, all-or-nothing down-the-line backhand just over the net for a winner.

Chirico hits a forehand long, and today is over! Well, today’s tennis is over, 
anyway.
 Bouchard progresses to the next round. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP  
Bouchard is hanging in here, against a massively improved Louisa Chirico. The 
American misses a couple of passing opportunities at 30-30, though, and 
Bouchard eventually finds a volleyed winner to earn match point.
 
And she’s done it as well. It’s 4-5 now, and Bouchard will have to serve for 
victory.
 
That leaves only one match still in progress, and Chirico is serving to stay 
in that one, at 3-5 in the second.
 
Federer speaks:

It’s nice to be playing tennis again, on a centre court like this. It was a 
long road but I made it. I’m in the draw, which is a beautiful thing. I just 
hope I can stick around for a bit. Any match is a good match. Even if I’d lost 
today it would have been good, because I’m back on the court. I’ve been living 
something of a normal life, having really good times, catching up with friends 
and family.
 
The No17 seed isn’t playing like a No17 seed, that’s for sure. Noah Rubin of 
the USA is next in his sights.

Melzer, trying to chase down a lob, tries to hit the ball back through his 
legs, fails, and it’s match point.
 
Federer now leads 5-2 in the fourth set, and Melzer is serving to stay in the 
competition.
 
She did win it, as well! It’s 4-2, and she’s back with a vague sniff of a 
gentle, quiet shout here!
 
Chiroco has improved immeasurably in the second set: no double faults, 
compared with two in set one, 74% of first serves have gone in, compared with 
69%, and 17 points have been won, compared with seven. She’s even got a break 
point. She needs to win it, though: she’s 4-1 down in the second set.
 
And Federer follows that by breaking Melzer’s serve, and is starting to 
disappear off into the distance.
 
Talking of 2-1 leads, Federer has one of those in the fourth set of his match 
against Melzer. He’s been helped by some ridiculous serving: there have already 
been six aces in the set, three in each of his service games so far.
 
Now Chirico has taken her next service game to deuce. She’s won as many points 
in her first two service games of set two as she did in the entirety of set 
one. She’s still lost one of them, though, and Bouchard leads 2-1.
 
Chirico has won a game! The dreaded double-bagel has been avoided, and she’s 
actually winning the second set. For now. 1-0.
 
And as I type that, the second point of the second set is won by Chirico on 
her second serve. So that’s something.
 
Meanwhile, Bouchard has wrapped up the first set 6-0 in just 18 minutes, 
Chirico winning a total of seven points, four on her own serve, three against 
the Bouchard serve. She has yet to win a point on her own second serve, in five 
attempts.
 
Federer’s back! He really is! This is beautiful stuff, and Melzer has no 
answer to it, as with the Austrian serving to stay in the third set the former 
No1 streaks into a 0-30 lead, and then narrowly misses a ludicrous attempted 
backhand half-volley lob. A short masterclass in variety and accuracy later, 
it’s two sets to one.
 
Melzer saves a break point, holds serve but remains 2-4 down in the third set.
 
Eugenie Bouchard has started her match in a hurry, winning the first three 
games, two of them on Chiroco’s serve. Chiroco has won four points so far.

Surprisingly, given that they’re both 35 and have an awful lot of tennis under 
their belts, and that they played three times in 2010 alone, Melzer and Federer 
have met only four times in all. Melzer has won once, in their most recent 
meeting, in the quarter-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters in 2011. All their 
previous meetings were won in straight sets.
 
Melzer earns a set point, only for Federer to save it with a gorgeous 
backhand. He earns another, and this time the Swiss overcooks his backhand, and 
it’s a set apiece: 5-7, 6-3.
 
Melzer, meanwhile, hasn’t just broken back, he’s double-broken-back. From 3-1 
down in the second set he currently leads 5-3, and is serving to draw level at 
a set apiece.
 
Today’s final match, featuring the former world No5 and current No47 Eugenie 
Bouchard and America’s Louisa Chirico, the world No65, will soon be under way 
on the Margaret Court Arena.
 
That Wawrinka missile in full:

 <https://twitter.com/doublefault28/status/820958339324579840>  
That was brilliantly entertaining stuff. Klizan was very, very close to an 
upset, and trudges off after three hours and 24 minutes of very impressive but 
ultimately futile effort wondering about ifs, buts and maybes. He hit some 
absolutely wondrous forehands in that match.
 
Klizan slams a forehand into the net, and Wawrinka makes it into round two!

Reed/Reuters  
Wawrinka lands a crosscourt backhand on the line. Klizan reviews, but it was 
good, and Wawrinka has a match point.
 
Wawrinka holds serve, and Klizan now has to serve to stay in the match at 4-5.
 
Ouch! A lengthy and vicious rally ends with Klizan at the net, hitting a weak 
half-volley to midcourt. Wawrinka steams in and absolutely thrashes the ball 
straight into his opponent, who has given up on the point and is just standing 
there watching, only to get struck just above the knee by a bullet forehand.
 
Wawrinka breaks back! It’s 4-4!
 
From 40-15 at my last update, Wawrinka has won three points in a row and now 
holds break point. This is super stuff.
 
Federer, meanwhile, breaks in the first game of the second set, and then holds 
with ease to go 2-0 up.
 
That’s a great rally, won by Klizan with a forehand of unsurprising power but 
beautiful depth, and Wawrink digs it out but can’t get it in. 40-15.
 
The drama is coming on the Margaret Court Arena, where Klizan lets out a roar 
as he hits a brutal crosscourt forehand to break serve and take a 4-3 lead over 
Wawrinka in the final set.
 
Federer won the last 12 points of the set. He’s back.
 
Federer takes the first set 7-5, with another stonking service game, held to 
love.

Darcis has indeed wrapped up the win on Court 8, and goes through to play 
Diego Schwartzman in round two. The winner of that match, for fans of long-term 
planning, plays the winner of Seppi v Kyrgios in the third round, and the 
winner of that one is seeded to face Wawrinka in the fourth, though of course 
Klizan (and various others) might have something to say about that.
 
The last match outside the two main showcourts looks like it’s about to end, 
with Australia’s Sam Groth staring defeat very much in the face. Steve Darcis 
leads 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 5-2 and is serving for the match.
 
And now it’s 4-4, Federer winning his service game to love in a matter of 
seconds - 71 of them, apparently.
 
And Melzer nets a straightforward forehand volley, allowing Federer to break 
straight back. Melzer leads 4-3.
 
There’s been a break in the Federer match, meanwhile, and it’s gone to Melzer! 
He leads 4-2, but is labouring a bit in his next service game, which is at 
deuce.
 
Bang! At 40-0 on the Wawrinka serve, Klizan nails a thunderbolt down-the-line 
forehand return winner. Phwoar! He kisses his racket in semi-comic gratitude.
 
And Klizan serves it out, with Wawrinka moaning about someone in the crowd 
shouting at a vital moment with the score 15-15. From there it’s over pretty 
quickly, with an ace - Wawrinka challenges, forlornly - and a smashed winner.
 
The first few games of the Federer match are all terribly brief and go with 
serve. Meanwhile on Margaret Court, Klizan is serving for the fourth set.
 
Federer won the toss and chose to receive.
 
Wawrinka has just been broken in the fourth set of his match against Martin 
Klizan. He’s two sets to one up, but 3-4 down in this one.
 
Federer is on court and about to get his Grand Slam return under way. He’s the 
No17 seed for this tournament, and says of his ranking that “I try to see it as 
being worse for the other guys there than it is bad for me”.
 
Next up on the Rod Laver Arena: Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> against Jurgen Melzer.
 
In the second round she’ll play Carina Witthoeft, who has completed a 7-5, 7-6 
win over Eri Hozumi.
 
Not without a worrying mid-match wobble, but comfortable enough in the end.
 Kerber goes through to the next round. Photograph: Joe Castro/EPA  
Meanwhile on Margaret Court Wawrinka pulled a perfectly-timed break out of the 
bag to take the third set, and now leads, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 1-0 against Martin 
Klizan.
 
Kerber is screaming to victory here now, rolling out a procession of winners. 
She stands 0-30 up, 5-2 up, in set two.
 
And Kerber then breaks the next game, with Tsurenko suffering 
inconveniently-timed mid-game finger-cramp.
 
Kerber holds serve for 2-2, but not without drama. She had to save a break 
point, and Tsurenko nailed her return as well, only for Kerber to send a 
do-or-die, all-or-nothing down-the-line backhand just over the net for a winner.
