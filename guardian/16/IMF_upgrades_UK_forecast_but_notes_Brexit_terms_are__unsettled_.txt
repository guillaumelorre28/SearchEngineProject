The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecasts for the UK economy 
this year after the latest signs that businesses and consumers have shrugged 
off the Brexit vote.

, the Washington-based fund also cut the outlook for 2018, reflecting 
widespread uncertainty over Britain’s future outside the EU.

The IMF forecast that the UK will grow by 1.5% this year, up from a previous 
estimate of 1.1%. However, 2018 expectations were revised down from 1.7% to 
1.4%.

The fund noted that Britain’s terms of exit from the EU were “unsettled”. It 
listed that uncertainty among a host of risks it sees to the global outlook 
that also included the potential for a wave of protectionism asDonald Trump

 that its prediction of apost-Brexit-vote financial crash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum>
 had proved to be overly pessimistic. Monday’s upgrade brought itmore in line

 after signs the UK economy grew at a solid pace in the second half of 2016.


The IMF’s economic counsellor, Maurice Obstfeld, included the unknown nature 
of Britain’s future relationship with the EU in a list of factors contributing 
to a climate of uncertainty that also included elections in the eurozone, the 
change of president in the US and geopolitical tensions.

The IMF used an update to its economic forecasts to highlight popular 
antipathy towards international trade and a widening in the gap between rich 
and poor. It called on governments to tackle inequality by helping people find 
work in fast-changing jobs markets shaken up by technology and globalisation.

The IMF made no changes to its October forecast for global economic growth to 
edge up this year after a sluggish 2016. But it upgraded its outlook for the US 
on the assumption that more spending under Trump would boost growth. However, 
it said there was uncertainty around the nature of economic policy under the 
new administration and how it would impact other economies.

Obstfeld noted signs of widespread frustration around the world at what many 
feel is an unfair distribution of the fruits of globalisation and economic 
growth.As policymakers and business leaders gather in Davos

.


“Social dislocation due to globalisation and, even more, to technology change 
is a major challenge that will only intensify in the future. One result has 
been wider inequality and wage stagnation in many countries,” Obstfeld said, 
presenting the latest IMF forecasts.

He added that a key takeaway from 2016 was that “sustainable growth must also 
be inclusive growth”.

But at the same time, with nationalist politicians gaining ground in some 
countries, the IMF warned against moving towards more inward-looking policies.

Without naming Trump, who campaigned on an anti-globalisation platform and 
with the promise of a big infrastructure drive, the IMF said there was a risk 
that higher spending could force the US central bank to raise interest rates at 
a faster pace to contain inflation and that would push up the US dollar. Those 
currency moves, which would make US exports more expensive and its imports 
cheaper, risked driving up “protectionist measures and retaliatory responses”, 
Obstfeld said.

On the other hand, the extra spending in the US was likely to bolster economic 
growth, and if done in a way that did not stoke inflation it would allow the US 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a more moderate pace. The IMF sees 
theUS economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> growing by 2.3% 
in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018. That was an upgrade from October’s forecasts for 2.2% 
for 2017 and 2.1% for 2018.

For the global economy, the IMF saw more scope for growth to disappoint rather 
than beat expectations. It forecast 3.4% growth this year and 3.6% in 2017. 
That follows estimated growth of 3.1% in 2016.

“A faster pace of expansion would be especially welcome this year: global 
growth in 2016 was the weakest since 2008-09, owing to a challenging first half 
marked initially by turmoil in world financial markets,” said Obstfeld, 
referring tosharp swings on markets this time last year

.

To help shore up growth in 2017, the IMF called on central banks to keep 
policy “accommodative, relying on unconventional strategies as needed”. It also 
repeated a call for governments to do their share of the heavy lifting with 
spending and long-term reforms to make growth more sustainable.
