The good news for Donald Trump is that the National and Common have signed up 
to mark the start of his presidency with a performance. The bad news? They’ll 
be marking it with an anti-Inauguration Day show, the day before he’s sworn in 
as the next leader of the United States.

The two artists are set to play the 9:30 Club in Washington DC alongside 
several other as-yet-unconfirmed artists on Thursday 19 January. The gig has 
been organised byPlanned Parenthood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/planned-parenthood> and All Access as a 
“call to action for supporters of reproductive freedom to take action wherever 
they are”.

 he believed there should be “some form of punishment” for a women who had 
abortions.

Tickets will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. Those who don’t

up in DC: the following day, the capital will host NO THANKS, a night of 
“anti-fascist resistance” featuring Priests, Waxahatchee and Sadie Dupuis of 
Speedy Ortiz.
