Any operation on the muscle usually leaves the player sidelined for at least 
three months.

The NSW State of Origin hooker’s Friday night showdown with the Tigers and 
former coach Jason Taylor is one of the highlights of the opening round, on 
March 3 at ANZ Stadium.

Farah left the club after being dropped at the end of last season, the 
culmination of a 12-month feud between the hooker and Taylor.

The 32-year-old – originally on contract until the end of 2017 – was given 
permission to look elsewhere late in the 2015 season.

Despite threats to spend the year in reserve grade, he rejected the option and 
stayed at the Tigers in 2016.

However he was banished to the bench in round 14 and didn’t play first grade 
again after the Origin period.

Farah signed with Souths in September on a two-year deal, and is expected to 
be their first-choice hooker after they released Cameron McInnes to St George 
Illawarra.

Farah will now work with his brother Eddie, who is the club’s physiotherapist, 
to ensure his fitness ahead of the club’s season opener.
