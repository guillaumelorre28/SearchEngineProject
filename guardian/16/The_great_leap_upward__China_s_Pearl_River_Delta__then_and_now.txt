The region where the Pearl River flows into the South China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> Sea has seen some of the most rapid 
urban expansion in human history over the past few decades – transforming what 
was mostly agricultural land in 1979 into what is the manufacturing heartland 
of a global economic superpower today.

In 2008, China announced plans to mesh Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, 
Zhaoqing, Foshan, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Zhongshan and Zhuhai into a single 
megacity. A series of massive infrastructure projects are under way to merge 
transport, energy, water and telecoms networks across the nine cities. 
Development has been relentless, and the World Bank recently named the Pearl 
River Delta asthe biggest urban area in the world 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/28/china-pearl-river-delta-overtake-tokyo-world-largest-megacity-urban-area>
 in terms of population and geographical size.

A 30-mile-long bridge and tunnel is under construction to join the Pearl River 
Delta metropolis of Zhuhai to the special administrative regions of Macau and
Hong Kong <https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong>.

The first satellite image above shows the Pearl River Delta in 1979. Click or 
tap on the image (or drag the blue button) to see the second (taken in 2000), 
which shows that vast swathes of farmland have turned from green to grey, and 
huge new areas of land reclaimed from the sea.

Hong Kong 

1980 population: 4.6 million; 2015 population: 7.3 million

The autonomous territory, which was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 
after 99 years, has more skyscrapers than any other region in the world. The 
high-density city has reclaimed many square miles of land from the sea, as can 
be seen from the shifted shoreline in the newer photograph.

Macau


1980 population: 243,000; 2015 population: 584,000

Since the Portuguese legalised gambling in Macau in the 1850s, the city has 
developed into the “Monte Carlo of the Orient”. It is the only place in China 
where casinos are legal, and millions of visitors flood in every year from the 
mainland and Hong Kong, which has helpedMacau 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/macau> overtake Las Vegas as the world’s 
biggest generator of gambling revenue.
