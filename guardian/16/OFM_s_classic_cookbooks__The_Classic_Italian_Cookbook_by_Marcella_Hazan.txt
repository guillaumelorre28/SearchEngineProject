single-handedly changed food as I knew it at home. I’m not saying my mum was 
not a good cook before the arrival of Marcella, far from it, it’s just that 
Marcella set new benchmarks in cooking and understanding food. Over the years 
that followed the book’s appearance in our house, my mother has perfected our 
particular family favourite, Tomato Sauce III. She is a confirmed recipe 
follower and this is one of the splendid things about all of Marcella’s 
recipes: they work.

Having changed eating at the Henderson household, Marcella went on to larger 
things: teaching America how to cook Italian food. I firmly believe the 
Cal-Ital thing would not have happened without her rigour. And now to the 
exciting part of my story (a story that should be exciting already).

When Marcella published her autobiography 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/books/review/Seligman-t.html> a few years 
ago, I received a note from her asking me to write something on the back cover. 
To me, this was akin to writing a blurb on the Bible. A letter duly returned 
thanking me, and saying that I must come to Florida to eat her pasta or 
risotto. Florida is not round the corner, but strangely it seemed to get closer 
and closer daily, until the point that it really seemed to be just round the 
corner. I needed to go. Why was I quibbling? Marcella had offered to cook pasta 
for me. Crazy boy. I stayed in a hotel that felt like the sort of place in 
which the Mob would take their summer holidays, just down from where she lived. 
I must admit I was a little surprised by her home, a high-rise gated community, 
but this seemed to be the favoured school of architecture along this coastline.

We found ourselves outside her front door, someone had rung the bell, and I 
suddenly felt like turning on my heels and running. It was all too much. I was 
about to meet Marcella. Then I was embracing Marcella … I was in Marcella’s 
flat … And it smelled fantastically of cooking.

There I was, eating canapes and drinking with her husband, Victor, and 
herself. We started with a fresh pasta that had wild mushrooms and roughly 
chopped spinach running through it. This was pasta you could have eaten for 
ever, except we were halted by the arrival of two shapely braised veal shins. A 
little homage from your hero is a giddy mouthful indeed.

When your hero knocks, or says come to lunch, Florida is not far away. These 
moments come around rarely enough, so I recommend adopting a hero who can cook. 
Thank you Marcella.

Tomato sauce III

This is the simplest and freshest of all tomato sauces. It has no other 
vegetables, except an onion. The onion is not sautéed, it is not chopped, it is 
only cut in two and cooked together with the tomato. Except for salt and a tiny 
amount of sugar, the sauce has no seasonings. It has no olive oil, only butter. 
What does it have? Pure, sweet tomato taste, at its most appealing. It is an 
unsurpassed sauce for potato gnocchi, and it is excellent with spaghetti, penne 
and ziti.

For 6 servings
Scant 1 kilo fresh, ripe plum tomatoes
110g butter
1 medium onion, peeled and halved
Salt
¼ teaspoon granulated sugar

Wash the tomatoes in cold water. Cut them in half, lengthways. Simmer in a 
covered stockpot or saucepan for 10 minutes.

Puree the tomatoes through a mouli-legumes back into the pan. Add the butter, 
onion, salt and sugar, and cook at a slow but steady simmer, uncovered, for 45 
minutes. Taste and check salt. Discard the onion.

If using tinned tomatoes: use a 400g tin, and start the recipe at the above 
step.

 Ragu Photograph: Romas Foord 
Ragu is not to be confused with ragout. A ragout is a French meat stew, while 
ragu is the meat sauce the Bolognese use for seasoning their homemade pasta. 
The only thing they share is a common and justified origin in the verb 
ragouter, which means “to excite the appetite”. A properly made ragu clinging 
to the folds of homemade noodles is one of the most satisfying experiences 
accessible to the sense of taste. It is no doubt one of the great attractions 
of the enchanting city of Bologna, and the Bolognese claim one cannot make a 
true ragu anywhere else. This may be so, but with a little care we can come 
very close to it. There are three essential points you must remember in order 
to make a successful ragu: the meat must be sauteed just barely long enough to 
lose its raw colour. It must not brown or it will lose delicacy. It must be 
cooked in milk before the tomatoes are added. This keeps the meat creamier and 
sweeter tasting. It must cook at the merest simmer for a long, long time. The 
minimum is 3½ hours; 5 is better. The union of tagliatelle and ragu is a 
marriage made in heaven, but ragu is also very good with tortellini, it is 
indispensable in lasagne, and it is excellent with rigatoni, ziti, conchiglie 
and rotelle. Whenever a menu lists pasta alla Bolognese, that means it is 
served with ragu.

For 6 servings
2 tablespoons chopped onion
3 tablespoons olive oil
40g butter
2 tablespoons chopped celery
2 tablespoons chopped carrot
350g minced lean beef, preferably chuck or the meat from the neck
Salt
250ml dry white wine
8 tablespoons milk
⅛ teaspoon nutmeg
400g tinned Italian tomatoes, roughly chopped, with their juice

An earthenware pot should be your first choice for making ragu. If you do not 
have one available, use a heavy, enamelled cast-iron casserole, the deepest one 
you have (to keep the ragu from reducing too quickly). Put in the chopped 
onion, with all the oil and butter, and saute briefly over medium heat until 
just translucent. Add the celery and carrot and cook gently for 2 minutes.

Add the minced beef, crumbling it in the pot with a fork. Add salt to taste, 
stir, and cook only until the meat has lost its raw, red colour. Add the wine, 
turn the heat up to medium high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the 
wine has evaporated.

Turn the heat down to medium, add the milk and the nutmeg, and cook until the 
milk has evaporated. Stir frequently.

When the milk has evaporated, add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly. When the 
tomatoes have started to bubble, turn the heat down until the sauce cooks at 
the gentlest simmer, just an occasional bubble. Cook, uncovered, for a minimum 
of 3½ to 4 hours, stirring occasionally. Taste and check salt. (If you cannot 
keep an eye on the sauce for such a long stretch, you can turn off the heat and 
resume cooking it later on. But do finish cooking it in one day.)

Note: ragu can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or frozen. Reheat 
and simmer for about 15 minutes before using. If you are using fresh tomatoes, 
peel and deseed them and cook in a little water for 10 to 15 minutes. Then pass 
through the finest blade of a mouli-legumes, or a sieve, and proceed with the 
recipe.

 Risotto alla parmigiana Photograph: Romas Foord 
This is the purest and perhaps the finest of all risotto. The only major 
ingredient added to the rice and broth is parmesan cheese. In Italian cooking, 
you should never use anything except good-quality, freshly grated parmesan 
cheese, but for this particular risotto you should make a special effort to 
obtain authentic, aged, Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano from the best supplier you 
know.

For 4 servings
2 chicken stock cubes dissolved in 1¼ litres of water
2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots or onion
40g butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
300g raw Italian arborio rice
60g freshly grated parmesan cheese
Salt, if necessary

 Bring the stock to a slow, steady simmer.

Put the shallots in a heavy-bottomed casserole with 25g of the butter and all 
the oil, and saute over medium-high heat until translucent but not browned.

Add the rice and stir until it is well coated. Saute lightly, then add 150ml 
of the simmering stock and stir while cooking, until the rice absorbs the 
liquid and wipes the sides of the pot as you stir. Add another 150ml of stock 
as the rice dries out, and stir it very frequently to prevent it from sticking.

When you estimate that the rice is about 5 minutes away from being done, add 
all the grated cheese and the remaining butter. Mix well. Check salt. Remember, 
when the cooking nears the end, not to add too much stock at one time. The 
risotto should be creamy but not runny. Serve immediately, with additional 
grated cheese, if desired.

 Arrosto di agnello al ginepro Photograph: Romas Foord 
In this recipe the meat is simmered right from the start with the vegetables, 
wine and flavourings. There is no browning and no liquid or cooking fat to add, 
because the meat supplies its own fat and juices as it cooks. There is 
practically nothing to do but watch the pot occasionally.

For 4
1.1kg leg of lamb, preferably butt end, bone in
1 tablespoon chopped carrot
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1 tablespoon chopped celery
250ml dry white wine
2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed with a knife-handle and peeled
½ teaspoon dried rosemary or a sprig of fresh rosemary leaves
1½ teaspoons juniper berries
Salt
Freshly ground pepper, 4 to 6 twists of the mill

Put all the ingredients into a heavy casserole. Cover and cook on top of the 
stove at low heat for 2 hours, turning the meat every 45 minutes.

At this point the lamb should have thrown off a considerable amount of liquid. 
Set the lid askew, and cook for another 1½ hours at slightly higher heat. The 
meat should now be very tender when pricked with a fork. If there is still too 
much liquid, uncover completely, raise the heat to high, and boil it until it 
is a little more concentrated. At the end the meat must be a rich brown in 
colour.

Off the heat, tilt the casserole and draw off as much of the fat as you can 
with a spoon. If you are not serving the roast immediately, do not degrease 
until after you have reheated it.

 Nodini di vitello alla salvia Photograph: Romas Foord 
For 4
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 veal loin chops, cut 18mm thick
90g plain flour, spread on a plate or on waxed paper
12 dried sage leaves
Salt
Freshly ground pepper, about 4 twists
6 tablespoons dry white wine
30g butter

Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat.


Turn the chops over in the flour, coating both sides, and shake off any 
excess. (Do not coat meat with flour until you are ready to saute it. The flour 
becomes damp and the meat does not brown properly.)

Slip the chops and the sage into the hot oil. Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes 
altogether, turning the chops two or three times so that they cook evenly on 
both sides. (Veal should not cook too long or it will become dry. The meat is 
done when it is rosy pink on the inside when cut.) When cooked, remove to a 
warm dish and add salt and pepper.

Tilt the frying pan and draw away most of the fat with a spoon. Add the wine 
and turn the heat to high. Boil rapidly until the liquid has almost completely 
evaporated and become a little syrupy. While boiling, loosen any cooking 
residue in the pan and add what juice the chops may have thrown off in the 
dish. When the wine has almost completely evaporated and thickened, turn the 
heat to very low and mix in the butter. Return the chops to the frying pan for 
a few moments, turning them over in the sauce. Transfer them to a warm serving 
dish, pour the remainder of the sauce over them, and serve immediately.

 Gelato di caffe con la cioccolata calda Photograph: Romas Foord 
For 6
4 egg yolks
130g granulated sugar
325ml espresso coffee, made using milk instead of water
240ml double cream

For the chocolate sauce
170ml double cream
2 tablespoons cocoa
4 teaspoons granulated sugar

Beat the egg yolks and sugar until they become a pale yellow cream.

Combine the espresso coffee and double cream and mix into the beaten egg yolks 
until uniformly blended. Warm the mixture in a saucepan over low heat, stirring 
constantly until it swells to nearly twice its original volume.

Pour into freezer trays. When cool, stir thoroughly and place in the freezer 
for at least 5 hours. Stir every 30 to 40 minutes.

Just before serving, prepare the sauce by combining the double cream, cocoa 
and sugar in a small saucepan and stirring it over low heat for about 6 
minutes, or until it becomes a smooth, thick cream.

Spoon the ice-cream, which should be quite firm but not rock hard, from the 
freezer trays into individual bowls. Pour the hot sauce over each serving and 
serve immediately.
