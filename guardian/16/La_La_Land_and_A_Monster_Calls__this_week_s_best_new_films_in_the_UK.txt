Not quite a studio musical like they used to make, but this award-scooping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/08/golden-globes-2017-la-la-land-moonlight-meryl-streep>
 retro-modern delight recalls the golden ages of Hollywood, jazz and youthful 
romance. It’s a classic boy-meets-girl story at heart: two handsome hopefuls (
Emma Stone <https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone> and Ryan Gosling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling>) fall into synchronised step 
along the road to LA stardom, but, as well as song-and-dance numbers, they 
discover art and love require sacrifices.

Casey Affleck 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/06/casey-affleck-sexual-harassment-nate-parker-hollywood>
 plays a miserable man whose life gets even worse when he’s brought back to his 
quaint, coastal Massachusetts home town by the death of his brother, and 
assigned guardianship of his teen nephew. Lonergan orchestrates the emotional 
drama with such wisdom, wit and sense of place, it never feels like a formula.

No need for CGI or special effects when you have a bottomless imagination like 
Jodorowsky’s – still undimmed at 87 years old. Here,he renders his creative 
awakening in bohemian Chile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/05/endless-poetry-review-jodorowskys-shocking-thrill-ride-into-his-past>
 as a beguiling piece of magical-surrealist performance art, taking in theatre, 
poetry, circus performance and even puppetry.

managed to pass you by. Suffice to say, you get your money’s worth: epic 
action, alien worlds and a likable cast signed up for the all-important mission.
