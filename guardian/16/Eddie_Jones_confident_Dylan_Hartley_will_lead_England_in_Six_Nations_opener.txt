England’s coach, Eddie Jones, said on Monday he is confident Dylan Hartley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dylan-hartley> will be ready to captain the 
side when the Six Nations starts next month.

The Northampton hooker, who has not played since 9 December when he was sent 
off for striking and handed a six-week ban, will be put through a series of 
tests on Wednesday to prove his match fitness, before the opening match against 
France at Twickenham on 4 February.

“Dylan has been training the house down, and we expect him to be ready to go,” 
Jones told the BBC.

“He’s got a few hurdles he still has to jump, and if he jumps those and jumps 
them well, he’ll be captain of the side.”

Hartley is available from 23 January following the completion of his ban but 
is unlikely to play in the Anglo-Welsh Cup.

“I have never seen him in better physical condition. He is training very hard. 
He is going to have a game-like training session on Wednesday I believe and we 
will see how fit he is,” Jones told Sky Sports. “We are anticipating that he is 
going to be right and ready to go for theSix Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations>.”

The Harlequins prop Joe Marler may also return quicker than expected from a 
broken leg, Jones added.

Marler was expected to be out for up to six weeks, but Jones would not rule 
him out of the France game.

“His recuperation might be quicker than we think,” said Jones. “There is 
always a chance. There is certainly hope there.”

Jones is due to name his squad on Friday.
