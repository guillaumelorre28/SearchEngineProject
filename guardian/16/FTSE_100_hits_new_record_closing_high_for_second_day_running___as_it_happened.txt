European shares edge lower

The FTSE 100 may have been toasting a new closing peak, but elsewhere in 
Europe shares were drifting lower, with banking stocks proving a drag on 
markets. The final scores in Europe showed:

 *  Germany’s Dax dipped 0.21% to 11,451.05

 * France’s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4838.47 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 19,203.94 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 9327.1 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.15% to 636.67 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is drifting away from the 
20,000 level and is currently down 18 points at 19,815.

Meanwhile, after initially shrugging off an unexpected rise in US crude 
inventories, oil prices have edged marginally lower, with Brent now down 0.37% 
at $56.01 a barrel.

As for the FTSE 100, it has hit a record high for the second day running, so 
here is our story giving the background to Wednesday’s new peak:

FTSE 100 reaches new closing record

It looked a bit unlikely as the FTSE 100 drifted lower for much of the day, 
but the leading index managed a last minute dash to a new closing high.

The index ended 14.18 points higher at 7120.26, within sight of the all time 
record reached on 11 October this year. With gold and silver prices moving 
higher, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo helped 
push the index into record territory.

Meanwhile the more UK-focused FTSE 250 added just 2.61 points to 18,015.42 and 
is some distance away from its own peak of 18,607 achieved in early October.

In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped lower - down around 7 
points - while the FTSE 100 has shied away from a new closing high and is now 4 
points lower. On the Dow, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

After yesterday’s decisive turn lower for US markets there has been little 
sign of fresh bullish momentum. Barring a miracle, Dow 20,000 looks off the 
cards, although the rebound in the index over the past year, as in other US 
markets, has been astounding. Only time will tell if the Trump euphoria can be 
sustained, or whether we are due another correction early on in the New Year.

US crude stocks showed a surprise rise last week, according to official 
figures.

Inventories rose by 614,000 barrels to 486m compared to forecasts of a 2.1m 
barrel decrease, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 
gasoline stocks fell by 1.6m barrels rather than the expected 1.3m barrel 
increase.

Wall Street opens higher

US markets are mainly edging ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average regaining a little ground after Wednesday’s triple digit 
decline and moved another step closer to the so far elusive 20,000 barrier.

The Dow is currently up 36 points at 19869 while the S&P 500 opened marginally 
higher and the Nasdaq composite marginally lower.

barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.18% lower at $53.96.

Here’s Reuters on the US data 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN14I199?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29>
:

A drop in U.S. exports last month pushed the country’s trade deficit in goods 
higher while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last 
week in a positive sign for the labor market.

The two reports released on Thursday suggested that when Donald Trump becomes 
president next month, the labor market will likely be at roughly full strength 
and international trade could be weighing on the economy.

In an initial estimate that does not include trade in services, the Commerce 
Department said America exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. 
Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for 
November is due on Jan. 6...

Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a 
seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department 
said.

It was the 95th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold 
associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, 
when the labor market was much smaller.

The department said in a statement there were no special factors affecting 
claims last week although estimating the data can be more difficult around 
holiday periods. The department said the actual number of claims was estimated 
by government staff for 10 states.

US trade gap widens, but jobless claims fall

Gracious me, we have TWO little pieces of economic news. 

Firstly, America’s trade deficit has swelled by 5.5%.

New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US trade gap widened to 
$65.3bn in November, up from $61.9bn in October.

Exports shrank by $1.2bn to $121.7bn, while America imported $187bn of stuff, 
$2.2bn more than in October.

Secondly, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has fallen by 
10,000, to 265,000. That’s broadly in line with forecasts, and shows that the 
US labour market remains resilient.

That will reassure the US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates earlier 
this month.

Trump and Brexit dominated 2016's top business stories

As it’s quiet, what better time to catch up with the biggest business stories 
of 2016?

We’ve crunched the numbers, and found that the Brexit vote, and the US 
election’s impact on the markets, were the most popular issues this year.

Our daily liveblog did well again too - so thanks to all readers for keeping 
our numbers up :)

Fiona Walsh, business editor of Theguardian.com <http://t.co/kvS3jhq6ey>, 
explains:

Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock EU 
referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the 
plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates.

There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from 
economists in January to “sell everything” before a new crash.

Here’s the full 10 Ten:

I fear America’s stock market won’t bring much excitement today either.

The futures market is suggesting Wall Street will open little changed, in 90 
minutes time, after the S&P 500 fell by almost 0.9% yesterday (its biggest drop 
since the US election).

Italian PM criticises ECB over Monte Dei Paschi bailout

Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has now criticised the European 
Central Bank for demanding that Monte Dei Paschi raise more new capital than 
previously planned.

Gentiloni told reporters that he got the news on Christmas Day - which may 
have rather spoiled the turkey and sprouts.


And Gentiloni wants to see the ECB’s workings out, echoing finance minister 
Padoan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/29/ftse-100-record-closing-high-house-prices-dow-jones-business-live?page=with:block-5864f05fe4b0fcf474af5c28#block-5864f05fe4b0fcf474af5c28>
’s concerns.

Reuters has the story: 


The European Central Bank should discuss with Italy the reasons behind its 
assessment that Banca Monte dei Paschi had a greater need for capital than 
previously thought, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday.

“It is important that the motives for this assessment are shared in 
discussions in the coming months,” Gentiloni told a news conference.

He added he had been surprised on December 25 to receive news that the 
regulator wanted Monte Paschi to plug a capital shortfall of €8.8bn, higher 
than a previous estimate of €5bn.

Investors are edgy that the cost of recapitalising the Italian banking sector 
may be going up, after the ECB demand that Monte Dei Paschi raises more capital 
than expected.

The FTSE 100 may have been toasting a new closing peak, but elsewhere in 
Europe shares were drifting lower, with banking stocks proving a drag on 
markets. The final scores in Europe showed:

 *  Germany’s Dax dipped 0.21% to 11,451.05

 * France’s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4838.47 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 19,203.94 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 9327.1 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.15% to 636.67 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is drifting away from the 
20,000 level and is currently down 18 points at 19,815.

Meanwhile, after initially shrugging off an unexpected rise in US crude 
inventories, oil prices have edged marginally lower, with Brent now down 0.37% 
at $56.01 a barrel.

As for the FTSE 100, it has hit a record high for the second day running, so 
here is our story giving the background to Wednesday’s new peak:

FTSE 100 soars to new closing high

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments 
and we’ll be back tomorrow for the last trading day of the year.
 
It looked a bit unlikely as the FTSE 100 drifted lower for much of the day, 
but the leading index managed a last minute dash to a new closing high.

The index ended 14.18 points higher at 7120.26, within sight of the all time 
record reached on 11 October this year. With gold and silver prices moving 
higher, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo helped 
push the index into record territory.

Meanwhile the more UK-focused FTSE 250 added just 2.61 points to 18,015.42 and 
is some distance away from its own peak of 18,607 achieved in early October.
 
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped lower - down around 7 
points - while the FTSE 100 has shied away from a new closing high and is now 4 
points lower. On the Dow, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

After yesterday’s decisive turn lower for US markets there has been little 
sign of fresh bullish momentum. Barring a miracle, Dow 20,000 looks off the 
cards, although the rebound in the index over the past year, as in other US 
markets, has been astounding. Only time will tell if the Trump euphoria can be 
sustained, or whether we are due another correction early on in the New Year.
 
Oil prices are little changed following the release of the latest US data, 
with Brent crude up 0.5% at $56.50 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate more or 
less flat at $54.03.
 
US crude stocks showed a surprise rise last week, according to official 
figures.

Inventories rose by 614,000 barrels to 486m compared to forecasts of a 2.1m 
barrel decrease, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 
gasoline stocks fell by 1.6m barrels rather than the expected 1.3m barrel 
increase.

Despite the Dow’s reluctance to surge towards 20,000, the FTSE 100 has just 
edged into positive territory. Could we yet have a new closing high?
 
US markets are mainly edging ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average regaining a little ground after Wednesday’s triple digit 
decline and moved another step closer to the so far elusive 20,000 barrier.

The Dow is currently up 36 points at 19869 while the S&P 500 opened marginally 
higher and the Nasdaq composite marginally lower.
 
Oil is holding steady ahead of the latest US inventory figures from the 
Department of Energy.

On Wednesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise 4.2m barrel 
increase in weekly US crude stocks compared to an expected fall of 2.1m barrels.

But ahead of the official DoE figures, Brent crude is up 0.44% at $56.47 a 
barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.18% lower at $53.96.
 
Here’s Reuters on the US data

:

A drop in U.S. exports last month pushed the country’s trade deficit in goods 
higher while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last 
week in a positive sign for the labor market.

The two reports released on Thursday suggested that when Donald Trump becomes 
president next month, the labor market will likely be at roughly full strength 
and international trade could be weighing on the economy.

In an initial estimate that does not include trade in services, the Commerce 
Department said America exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. 
Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for 
November is due on Jan. 6...

Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a 
seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department 
said.

It was the 95th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold 
associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, 
when the labor market was much smaller.

The department said in a statement there were no special factors affecting 
claims last week although estimating the data can be more difficult around 
holiday periods. The department said the actual number of claims was estimated 
by government staff for 10 states.

Gracious me, we have TWO little pieces of economic news. 

Firstly, America’s trade deficit has swelled by 5.5%.

New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US trade gap widened to 
$65.3bn in November, up from $61.9bn in October.

Exports shrank by $1.2bn to $121.7bn, while America imported $187bn of stuff, 
$2.2bn more than in October.

Secondly, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has fallen by 
10,000, to 265,000. That’s broadly in line with forecasts, and shows that the 
US labour market remains resilient.

That will reassure the US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates earlier 
this month.

As it’s quiet, what better time to catch up with the biggest business stories 
of 2016?

We’ve crunched the numbers, and found that the Brexit vote, and the US 
election’s impact on the markets, were the most popular issues this year.

Our daily liveblog did well again too - so thanks to all readers for keeping 
our numbers up :)

Fiona Walsh, business editor of Theguardian.com <http://t.co/kvS3jhq6ey>, 
explains:

Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock EU 
referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the 
plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates.

There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from 
economists in January to “sell everything” before a new crash.

Here’s the full 10 Ten:

previously planned.

’s concerns.

Reuters has the story: 


The European Central Bank should discuss with Italy the reasons behind its 
assessment that Banca Monte dei Paschi had a greater need for capital than 
previously thought, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday.

discussions in the coming months,” Gentiloni told a news conference.

He added he had been surprised on December 25 to receive news that the 
regulator wanted Monte Paschi to plug a capital shortfall of €8.8bn, higher 
than a previous estimate of €5bn.

may be going up, after the ECB demand that Monte Dei Paschi raises more capital 
than expected.
