 in Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk.

“I’ve had to make a massive decision by myself. I was hoping and praying that 
he’d come back so we could make the decision together,” she said.

In an interview with the BBC, Oliver, 21, said she wanted to talk about her 
pregnancy so that she could focus on looking after herself and her baby. “Most 
people only tell their close friends but I’m faced with a decision where I need 
to tell near enough the whole UK,” she said.


“It’s hard and it’s going to add another level of stress I don’t really need 
but it’s something that has to be done. It’s incredibly difficult to bounce my 
head from the excitement of a new baby to what we’re actually trying to focus 
on, which is finding Corrie.”

Mckeague, who is 23 and from Fife, in Scotland, has been described as a 
“social hand grenade” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/29/mother-of-missing-raf-serviceman-corrie-mckeague-says-he-was-social-hand-grenade>
 by his mother Nicola Urquhart, who said her son would “put himself at risk 
because [he] believed he could handle himself”.

Urquhart, who went with Oliver for the scan, has said she fears someone else 
was involved in her son’s disappearance, though police said the had found no 
evidence to suggest that was the case.

“He’s not so much a social butterfly, more a social hand grenade who 
absolutely lives for the moment. He will make choices and decisions that are 
sometimes reckless that other people might not.


“Would he get into a stranger’s car? Yes. Would he go to a stranger’s house 
that he’s never met before that he’s met on a social dating site? Yes,” she 
said during a question and answer session on Facebook Live last month.

Speaking to the BBC, Oliver called her partner an “absolute gentleman”. She 
said: “He’s just the sweetest and most outgoing person I’ve ever known. There 
is nothing I would love more than for him to walk through the door and say ‘I’m 
back’.”

She flew back from a holiday in the US when she heard that he had gone 
missing. “I was concerned. I knew it was out of character. I was quite worried.”
