Wild won stage four, a twilight circuit race at Victoria Park, and that gave 
her the honours in a head-to-head duel this week with top Australian sprinter 
Chloe Hosking.

Wild (Cylance) also won the second stage on Sunday night, while Hosking rode 
superbly to win stage three. Hosking (Ale Cipollini) was third on Tuesday 
behind compatriot Annette Edmondson (Wiggle High5).

But no-one was going to dethrone Spratt, the Orica-Scott captain. She won the 
opening stage and Orica-Scott then protected her overall lead for the rest of 
the tour.

Spratt was 22nd in Tuesday’s bunch sprint and finished 25 seconds ahead of 
Dutch rider Janneke Ensing (Ale Cipollini) in the general classification, while 
Wild was third overall at 40 seconds.

It has been a flawless start to the year for Spratt, whose main aim is the 
Ardennes classics in the European spring.

She nearly lapped the field to win race two of the Bay Classic series and then 
finished second in a sprint finish with team-mate Katrin Garfoot at the 
Australian championships road race.

At the end of this month, Spratt will defend her title at the Cadel Evans 
Great Ocean Rd race.
