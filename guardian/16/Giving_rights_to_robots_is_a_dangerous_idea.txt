The EU’s legal affairs committee is walking blindfold into a swamp if it 
thinks that “electronic personhood” will protect society from developments in 
AI (Give robots ‘personhood’, say EU committee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/give-robots-personhood-status-eu-committee-argues>
, 13 January). The analogy with corporate personhood is unfortunate, as this 
has not protected society in general, but allowed owners of companies to 
further their own interests – witness the example of the Citizens United 
movement in the US, where corporate personhood has been used as a tool for 
companies to interfere in the electoral process, on the basis that a 
corporation has the same right to free speech as a biological human being.

Electronic personhood will protect the interests of a few, at the expense of 
the many. As soon as rules of robotic personhood are published, the creators of 
AI devices will “adjust” their machines to take the fullest advantage of this 
opportunity – not because these people are evil but because that is part of the 
logic of any commercial activity.

Just as corporate personhood has been used in ways that its original 
proponents never expected, so the granting of “rights” to robots will have 
consequences that we cannot fully predict – to take just two admittedly 
futuristic examples, how could we refuse a sophisticated robot the right to 
participate in societal decision-making, ie to vote? And on what basis could we 
deny an intelligent machine the right to sit on a jury?
