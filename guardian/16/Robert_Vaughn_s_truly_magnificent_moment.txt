An MoD spokesman says the UK “does not have” powerful and controversial 
thermobaric weapons (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/battle-for-mosul-iraq-asks-for-uk-help-to-get-thermobaric-weapons>
, 18 November). This is a case of weasel words: the MoD does not accept the use 
of the term thermobaric as “there is no internationally accepted definition”. 
So the thermobaric AMG-114N missiles fired by UK Reaper drones have been 
relabelled as“enhanced blast” 
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/britain-admits-using-vacuum-bomb/story-e6frg6to-1111116704067>
 instead. The British army’s light anti-structures missile, a shoulder-launched 
rocket for destroying buildings and bunkers, is similarly a rebranded M72A9 
thermobaric weapon. The statement is therefore correct, simply because the MoD 
will never use the word thermobaric. They will, however, continue to use 
thermobaric weapons.

• Well, there’s a surprise (Cold calls to be banned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/19/pension-cold-calling-banned-rise-scams-autumn-statement>
, 19 November). George Osborne and co must be the only people in the country 
who did not predict the parasites and fraudsters waiting in the wings to siphon 
off £19m of pension funds last year, after his disastrous changes. An utter 
disgrace.

• Duncan Grimmond (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/17/foodies-flies-and-the-ultimate-school-photo>
, 18 November) may get high marks for arithmetic, but only a low score for 
comprehension. Alan Payling (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/in-1966-an-lp-cost-almost-a-quarter-of-a-teenage-pop-pickers-pay>
, 17 November) compared his weekly wage (£6 10s 6d) with the cost of an LP (£1 
12s 6d). The correct ratio is therefore 24.9%, or as Alan said “more or less a 
quarter of my wages”.

• I cannot bear to see any more publicity for The Grand Tour, which cost £4m 
an hour to produce (Report

days, earning £64 a day

• Robert Vaughn’s real supreme moment in The Magnificent Seven (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/17/foodies-flies-and-the-ultimate-school-photo>
, 18 November ) came later, in an echo of the fly-catching incident, when he 
redeemed himself by killing three of the Seven’s opponents in one single 
shooting round.
