 <>Why do some crosswords look different to others on theguardian.com?

In February 2010, we changed the way we present some of our crosswords. The 
Prize, Cryptic, Quick, Quiptic, Everyman and Speedy are in the new format. Azed 
and Genius will remain in their current format for the foreseeable future.

 <>Which crosswords are published online?

 <>What happened to a PDF version of the crossword?

For all newspaper-published crosswords that appear online from Wednesday 10 
February 2010 a PDF version will appear beneath the crossword's title and 
alongside the Print version and the Blind & PS version.

The PDF option will still show if it was available on the old crosswords 
before they were moved over to our new platform.

 <>How do I print a crossword?

Crosswords can now be printed by clicking the link to the print version.

We have added black lines to the print version to make it clearer, while 
retaining the grey squares so less ink is used when printing (something many 
users have requested).

We know people are experiencing issues with printing so we have outlined some 
details here that should help.

• Select the print button at the top of the crosswords page, this will take 
you to a print version.
• Then select file and print preview. 
• Here can you make your selection. In the scaling if you select 90% this will 
be big enough to the fit the page but not too big to make it roll over to page 
2.

These steps should be followed in all cases. 

However, there are a few exceptions where an extra step must be done.

• Printing on Firefox
Windows Users:File - > Page Setup - > Format and Options
Tick "Print Background (colors & images)

Mac Users: File -> Print
Tick both "Print Background Colors" and "Print Background images"
 Crossword printing instructionns for mac 
• Printing on Safari
Mac users: File - > Print 
Tick "Print backgrounds"

• Printing on IE6,IE7,IE8
Tools - > Internet Options - > Advanced (Tab)

Tick "Print background colors and images"

 <>Why can't I view the crossword grid's vertical lines on my print out?

In your print options turn on background images and you should be able to see 
the grid.
