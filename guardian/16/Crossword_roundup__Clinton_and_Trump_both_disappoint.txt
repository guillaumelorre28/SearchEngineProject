The news in clues

For Americans who wish to cast their vote on the basis of the candidates’ 
enthusiasm for crosswords, it’s a no-brainer. One of the horrendous nominees 
has never shown any interest in cerebral hobbies (outside ofchallenging the 
London mayor to an “IQ test” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/16/donald-trump-unlikely-have-good-relationship-david-cameron>
); the other may have crosswording in the family – but Bill’sNew York Times

 and crosswords are not mentioned once in Wikileaks’ apparent archive of 
Hillary’s email. No, it has to be Green candidateJill Stein

What new terms will the post-election hostilities bring to the language? 
Gordius’s clue of 2007 …

2d Maybe hanging country (4)


… recalled the hanging-CHAD 
<https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/courses/275f00/abc-chads.html>, 
butterfly-ballot debacle of 2000. This time, the use of voting machines with 
too many moving parts suggests that we may be hearing a lot about the 
phenomenon where an occasional voter successfully votes for one candidate, but 
the screen erroneously tells them otherwise.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People 
are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for POEM (or indeed POËM) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/oct/24/crossword-roundup-mark-and-noel-noel-and-harold#comments>
. I dared to hope for some clues in verse and was delighted by such works of 
art as Poorsub’s


Perfectly to start
Ordinarily begins,
And a dash to end

and Schroduck’s

At last maiden old lady from Poole
Got married to internet fool.
‘It’s madness to mope;
May embrace even hope!
Head’s only part of extent miniscule …’

Thebrasselephant wisely chose a poet given to wordplay such as acrostics with 
“An acrostic in Poe manuscript” and Poe also appeared ina valiant effort from 
ousgg <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86074271>, despite 
which the audacity award is harlobarlo’s for:


‘It may well
Rhyme with prime’
Spoke a mime

Of the scurrilous surfaces, I enjoyed Phitonelly’s “Englishman in Australia 
snorting drug lines” and Steveran “Making love in gym class: 1000 lines”.

The runners-up are GappyTooth’s lavatorial “One using feet and head, that 
takes me back” and AriadneOliver’s smooth “Returning MEP has no work”; the 
winner is ComedyPseudonym’s elegant


A haiku perhaps,
offering elegiac
moods primarily

Kludos to ’Pseudonym; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of 
the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the Fortnight

As nominated by TrickyJoe, here’s an extraordinary Quiptic clue by Hectence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/885#20-across> …

20ac x + (2-w) + 2 = 1.50 (3,2,3)
[ number represented by Roman numeral X, then the word TWO minus its W, then 
the word TWO ]
[ TEN + TO + TWO ]

… for TEN TO TWO, which imparted that wonderful sensation when you realise 
that a clue is a lot simpler than it looks.
