Kate Russell, technology reporter, BBC Click

9.05 - 9.30 Keynote address: The rise of the algorithm - artificial 
intelligence, ethics, trust and tech development

As the world becomes increasingly automated, we need regulation to improve 
trust in robotics and artificial intelligence. But what should the regulatory

regulation?

Neil Lawrence, senior principal scientist at Amazon and professor of machine 
learning, University of Sheffield

The media sector has a diversity problem. Data from the Institute of 
Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) reveals that 13% of employees and 8% of 
senior managers are from BAME (black and minority ethnic) backgrounds. Does the 
lack of diversity mean that young people no longer view the media industry as a 
destination career? Can people from any background flourish in the media 
sector? What needs to be done to improve diversity and ensure the future of the 
industry?

10.50 - 11.15 The psychology of truth in the digital age

confirms existing beliefs, making us more narrow-minded. In this session, hear 
what this distortion means for society, businesses and individuals, and how we 
can combat it.

Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, professor of business psychology at University

12.05 - 12.30 10 media trends for 2017 and beyond

We talk a lot about change in advertising, but maybe we’ve seen nothing yet.

We talk about the digital world as if it’s new, but it’s been 10 years since 
the iPhone and we’re still yet to get to grips with what’s really possible.

From banner ads to pre-rolls, eCommerce sites to social, we’re recycling the 
units of the past and we can do better if we think ambitiously, creatively and 
boldly.

In order to do this, Tom will take us on a 25 min provocation he’s delivered 
around the world, to explore some of the themes, changes, challenges and 
opportunities that we’re in the middle of. Tom will explore 10 themes that 
capture the spirit of the modern world, the threats and the opportunities.

Tom Goodwin, executive vice president of innovation, Zenith Media USA

12.30 - 13.20 Closing session

aspirations, what they want from the industry and how it can rebuild trust.
