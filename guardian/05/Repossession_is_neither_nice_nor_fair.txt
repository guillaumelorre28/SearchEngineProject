The man running the bad banks of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley has 
warned that rising interest rates could result ina "tsunami" of repossessions

that could revive memories of the 1990s when the courts were clogged with 
repossession orders forcing families out of their homes.

Richard Banks says the policy of forbearance might be "nice" for homeowners 
who are behind with the mortgage but it is not "fair" to let them fall further 
into debt.

The director of UK Asset Resolution (UKAR) has a point but it is not going to 
be nice or fair for those families who are likely to lose their homes if the 
cost of borrowing rises next year, as is widely expected.

Some 40,000 homebuyers are expected to forfeit their homes this year. Northern 
Rock <https://www.theguardian.com/business/northern-rock> alone offered 
forbearance to 44,000 last year. Officials reckon one in eight homebuyers has 
been offered special terms to fend off foreclosure.

Debate over whether these families are victims of reckless lending will 
continue.

What is sure is that the Labour government's policy of encouraging forbearance 
did nothing but kick the can down the road.
