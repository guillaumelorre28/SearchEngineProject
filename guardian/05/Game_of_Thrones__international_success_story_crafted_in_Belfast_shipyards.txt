In April 1998, when the Good Friday Agreement was announced in Belfast, 
sealing the peace process inNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, its signatories could not 
have imagined that they were helping to make broadcasting as well as political 
history.

But part of the region’s cultural and economic post-Troubles recovery was the 
setting up of Northern Ireland Screen, a government-backed agency encouraging 
international film and television producers to use as locations Belfast and the 
mountains, woods, rivers and beaches beyond.

The organisation hoped to find a franchise that might do for employment and 
tourism in Ulster what the Lord of the Rings films had done for New Zealand. 
And the dream was achieved when, in 2011, the American TV network HBO began 
production of a series calledGame of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> at Titanic Studios, 
based in the shipyards where the doomed ocean-liner had been built.

It was a clever move by HBO because the Northern Irish landscape was 
beautifully ancient without being distractingly familiar to global audiences in 
the way that the terrain of America or the Antipodes might have been.

The Belfast production base also gave an advantage in the casting. Game of 
Thrones has learned from the Harry Potter and Tolkien films that British 
classical actors in cameo roles lend an extra heft to fantasy scripts, so Diana 
Rigg, Jonathan Pryce, Anton Lesser and Julian Glover were among those flown in 
across the Irish Sea to play featured roles in the series.

The overall budget was helped, though, by the choice in the lead roles of 
British actors such as Kit Harington and Michelle Fairley and the American 
Peter Dinklage, who, at the time, were fairly unknown.

This reflects a decision to position the series as an overall brand – aimed at 
the large fan base that the George RR Martin source books already had – rather 
than relying on big-name actors to draw audiences. In Game of Thrones, the 
story is the star.

A clue to why the show has now won more awards than any other fiction series 
in the history of theEmmys <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/emmys> can 
be seen in the other series that took home trophies this year – Veep (about 
politics), The People vs OJ Simpson (race), Bloodline (violence), and Downton 
Abbey (history).

Politics, race, history and violence thrive in the plot lines of Game of 
Thrones, which also features large amounts of a commodity that has rarely 
driven audiences away – sex. The latter has made the show hugely popular with 
teenage libidos in males of all ages, although it has also brought justified 
criticism of the show’s sometimes casual attitudes to female nudity and, in one 
controversial scene, rape.

This is a Lord of The Rings but with more blood, lust and intrigue.
