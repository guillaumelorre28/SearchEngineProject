Evening summary

 * In a letter to EU leaders ahead of tomorrow’s summit in Brussels, Donald 
Tusk, the president of the European council, said there is still no guarantee 
that an agreement can be reached. Failure, he said, would be a defeat both for 
the UK and the EU, and a “geopolitical victory for those who seek to divide us”.

 * Angela Merkel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel> said it is 
in Germany’s national interest for the UK to remain in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. The German chancellor appealed for more 
sympathy and understanding for the British position, saying the British prime 
minister’s demands were “comprehensible and justified”. 
 * Cameron undertook a round of telephone calls with EU leaders, and held 
talks in Downing Street with the London mayor, Boris Johnson, one of the most 
prominent Toriesyet to make his position known 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/10/boris-johnson-eu-marina-wheeler-david-cameron-deal-renegotiation>
 on the EU deal. A source close to the mayor said he would not reveal his views 
until after Cameron returned from the summit: “The mayor will make everything 
abundantly clear by the end of the week if the prime minister gets a deal on 
Friday. He is genuinely undecided.” 
 * The French prime minister Manuel Valls said Britain’s exit from the EU 
would be “a shock” for Europe but that members could not pick and choose rules 
that suit them. “Europe is a whole that we can adapt, but we can’t rework it 
only according to our particular interests, otherwise a line is crossed,” he 
said. Facebook

Meanwhile there is a kerfuffle over petrol prices if Britain leaves the EU. 
FairFuelUK, which lobbies for lower fuel prices, is cross with the AA for 
“scaremongering” that a two-car family who refuel twice a month would pay £494 
more for petrol each year if the UK decamps. Howard Cox, Founder of the 
FairFuelUK Campaign argues:

George Osborne “now takes a massive 75% in tax every time we fill up, so you 
tell our supporters what is actually the biggest factor on pump prices? It 
isn’t the EU’s influence or over-paid City analysts’ spreadsheet predictions, 
it’s the government’s colossal and unwarranted fleecing of the motorist!”

Donald Tusk: 'still no guarantee of agreement'

The president of the European council has written a letter to council members 
ahead of tomorrow’s crunch summit in Brussels 
<http://dsms.consilium.europa.eu/952/Actions/Newsletter.aspx?messageid=3389&customerid=11877&password=enc_3338464439313434_enc>
. Here are the key passages and no prizes on guessing on “those seeking to 
divide us”.

Tomorrow we will meet in the European Council. It will be a crucial moment for 
the unity of our Union and for the future of the United Kingdom’s relations 
withinEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

After my consultations in the last hours I have to state frankly: there is 
still no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. We differ on some political 
issues and I am fully aware that it will be difficult to overcome them. 
Therefore I urge you to remain constructive.

The negotiations are very advanced and we must make use of the momentum. There 
will not be a better time for a compromise. It is our unity that gives us 
strength and we must not lose this. It would be a defeat both for the UK and the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, but a geopolitical 
victory for those who seek to divide us.

We will work on the basis of the proposal that I put forward on the 2nd of 
February, with technical and legal clarifications which have been worked out by 
our Sherpas to be circulated today. But all the political issues will remain 
open for tomorrow. The objective has been clear from the start:to reach a 
legally binding and irreversible agreement which addresses UK concerns, while 
being satisfactory to all. At the same time we will not undermine our 
fundamental values. It is my goal to do the deal this week.

Frances O’Grady, head of the Trades Union Congress, says the deal has to have 
something on the table for workers as well as protecting the interests of the 
City and business. She was speaking after meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, 
president of the European commission, in Brussels.

People wanted to know “how is it going to make working lives better,” she told 
BBC News. “There is a real yearning for security in jobs, what it means for me 
and my family.”

Henry McDonald

Our Dublin correspondent writes: 

A special Irish cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow morning to discuss 
Brexit and David Cameron’s bid to win concessions from the EU on Friday in 
Brussels.

Enda Kenny will take time out from campaigning in the Republic’s general 
election to chair talks on how the Irish government responds to Cameron’s 
demands.

Speaking today on the hustings in Co.Offaly in the Irish midlands, Kenny 
stressed that Ireland wanted the UK to remain inside the EU.

Kenny pointed to the strong trade connections between Britain and Ireland 
which could be put at risk if the UK left the EU.

Here is the Guardian’s story on Angela Merkel telling German MPs that 
Cameron’s demands are “comprehensible and justified”.

Angela Merkel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel> has said it is 
in Germany’s national interest for the UK to remain in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, as David Cameron embarked on a round of 
last-minute diplomacy ahead of a crucial summit on Thursday.

Shortly before a summit in Brussels where David Cameron’s reform proposals 
will be thrashed out, the German chancellor appealed for more sympathy and 
understanding for the British position.

UK staying in EU is in Germany's national interest, says Merkel

The BBC has a useful timetable 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35592466> for tonight and 
the next few days.

A new draft of the whole reform package will be published on the European 
council website this evening - but contentious points such as welfare curbs and 
exempting the UK from “ever closer union” will still need to be nailed down at 
tomorrow’s summit.

Thursday

15:00: EU leaders gather for their regular summit at the European council 
headquarters in Brussels.

16:45: First working session on the UK proposed reforms.

19:00: Working dinner on the migration crisis. Talks on the UK deal could 
resume after dinner and continue late into the night, if there is still no deal.

Friday

08:00: Discussions will continue if no agreement on the UK demands has been 
reached on Thursday. If Cameron gets a deal, he will hold an emergency cabinet 
meeting on Friday evening to reach an agreed position on remaining in the EU, 
although ministers will be free to campaign against in a personal capacity. The 
prime minister may announce the date of the referendum.

The French prime minister Manuel Valls has said Britain’s exit from the EU 
would be “a shock” for Europe but that members could not pick and choose rules 
that suit them. Here is AFP’s story. (It wasCharles de Gaulle who twice said 
“non” to Britain’s membership 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/27/newsid_4187000/4187714.stm>
, in 1963 and 1967. De Gaulle - who was suspicious of the US - thought Britain 
would a Trojan horse for the Americans. De Gaulle died in 1970 and Britain 
joined in 1973 under Edward Heath.)

“We believe and we hope” that a deal is possible to keep Britain in the EU, 
Valls told France’s parliament.

“Because the departure of Britain would signify ... a shock for Europe, but 
more importantly a shock to the way the world seesEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, which is already in crisis.”

Valls said France would be “particularly vigilant” on the issues of free 
movement of EU citizens, and relations between countries in the eurozone and 
others.

“Europe should be a place of solidarity between states and we cannot choose ‘a 
la carte’ based on what suits us,” Valls said.

“Europe is a whole that we can adapt, but we can’t rework it only according to 
our particular interests, otherwise a line is crossed.”

A French MP has accused Cameron of adopting blackmail tactics worthy of 
Margaret Thatcher.

Alain Tourret, who represents the Calvados department, made the comments in 
the French parliament according to the French broadcaster LCP.

This will be music to the ears of Cameron as he tries to convince Thatcherite 
Eurosceptic MPs that he driving a hard bargain.

Despite his efforts to achieve a good deal the public still lack confidence in 
the prime minister’s ability to do so. One in three say they have confidence in
David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> (up 3 points) 
and three in five (62%) have little confidence in him (down 1 point). 
Conservative supporters are split with half (50%) confident in Cameron

 Merkel addresses the Bundestag Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images 
AP has fuller write-up of Merkel’s remarks to the Bundestag.

Merkel painted a largely positive picture of chances of an agreement on 
Britain’s EU reform demands. “Germany will make its contribution so that a 
result that satisfies everyone can be achieved, if possible already at the 
summit beginning tomorrow,” she said.

 “I am convinced that is in our national interest for Great Britain to remain 
an active member in a strong and successfulEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>,” she added.

 Merkel said Britain is an ally for Germany in promoting competitiveness and 
free trade, and that “Europe needs Great Britain’s foreign and security policy 
commitment to assert our values and interests in the world.”

 On migrants, Merkel made clear that she won’t be pushing the contentious 
subject of new quotas to distribute migrants around Europe. She reiterated that 
it would be “laughable” forEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> to approve such quotas when it 
has barely started to share refugees under existing agreements.

 “A continent that reacts by sealing (borders) off just behind the maritime 
border, and says ‘we’re not interested in whoever is behind the fence’ I am 
convinced that can’t be the European answer,” she said.

 Despite all the difficulties, Merkel offered an optimistic outlook for this 
week’s meeting though she said that “the discussion on both issues won’t be 
ended with the summit.”

The meeting “is a stage on the road that, so far, has made Europe stronger 
after every crisis,” she said. “And I hope that can be the case this time, too.”

AFP quoted Merkel saying:

“These are not just about Britain’s individual interests on some issues or 
questions, rather it’s about several points that are justified and 
understandable,”

“Like David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron>, I 
believe that it is necessary for the EU to improve our competitiveness, 
transparency and (reduce) bureaucracy. Germany has shared these concerns for 
many years.”

Even the controversial proposal to curb benefits to European Union migrants in 
Britain is “justified and understandable because the jurisdiction for each 
respective social system lies not in Brussels but in each individual member 
state,” she said.

“Therefore, it is only natural for every member state to be able to protect 
its social system against abuse.”

“I share with David Cameron the view that member states that use a currency 
other than the euro should not be ignored in important questions,” she said.

“Our aim must be to prevent discrimination while at the same time allowing for 
a differentiation when necessary,” Merkel said.

She added that this principle was compatible with the fact that the eurozone 
will “continue and is in fact taking the necessary decisions for itself”.

The German leader’s position appeared to run counter to France’s, which had 
made it clear that EU states that do not share the euro should not have any 
power to stop the eurozone from seeking deeper integration.

 John Baron Photograph: Parliament TV 
Tory Eurosceptic MP, John Baron, accused Cameron of “poor” communications with 
his own backbenchers on the EU negotiation after failing to secure a meeting 
with the prime minister over his doubts about the deal.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme Barron said: “I think the 
communication between Number 10 and the backbenchers has been poor. A number of 
us clubbed together and said ‘could we have a meeting’ - 40 MPs signed my 
letter suggesting it would be good to get together and just air these views. We 
have been unsuccessful in obtaining that meeting. Boris Johnson apparently has. 
I wish him well.”

His comments come as Cameron is said to have set aside today to convincing 
Eurosceptics of the merits of the deal.

Baron said the proposed emergency break on benefits was a being “controlled by 
the EU backseat driver”. Mixing his metaphors he added: “It doesn’t solve 
anything, in many respects it’s a smokescreen.”

Baron added: “That is the choice facing the British people in this referendum: 
leave or stay on this conveyor belt towards ever closer union, if we do not 
address this opportunity to address the issue of parliamentary sovereignty once 
and for all ...

“If we could have that guarantee about the supremacy of parliamentary 
sovereignty, so we can control our borders, that we can control our laws and 
our regulations then I might be persuadable. But nothing is on the table yet to 
make me change my mind.”

Merkel delivered a powerful message of support for David Cameron’s EU reform 
plans,according to the FT’s Berlin correspondent Stefan Wagstyl 
<http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/02/17/merkel-offers-backing-to-cameron-on-uk-future/>
.

On ever-closer union, she said it should always be “possible for further 
integration” to take place but there was no “obligation for every country to 
join every step”. She also backed Cameron’s proposals to boost the role of 
national parliaments.

“I think it’s in our national interest that Great Britain should remain an 
active member in a strong and successful EU,” she said, adding that Germany and 
the UK had common views on boosting the union’s competitiveness.

Merkel said relations between eurozone and non-eurozone countries should be 
managed in a way that “avoided discrimination” by the eurozone of non-eurozone 
states but the eurozone had to able to “make its own decisions for itself,” for 
example on further reforms.

Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> told David Cameron 
that more was needed to win his support in the referendum campaign, writes 
Nicholas Watt.

Nothing had changed, the mayor is said to have remarked and reportedly added 
that more was needed.

A source close to the mayor said he would live up to his commitment to outline 
his position on the EU “with deafening eclat” on Friday if the prime minister 
secures a deal at the EU summit, which opens in Brussels on Thursday afternoon. 
The source said: “The mayor will make everything abundantly clear by the end of 
the week if the prime minister gets a deal on Friday. He is genuinely 
undecided.”

Johnson told Cameron more work was necessary on his plan to assert 
parliament’s sovereignty. Oliver Letwin, the prime minister’s policy chief, has 
been tasked with outlining measures to deliver on his pledge to put that issue 
“beyond doubt”.

Cameron’s vow in the Commons earlier this month came after Johnson asked him 
to explain how his EU reforms would “assert the sovereignty of this House of 
Commons and these Houses of Parliament”. Cameron replied: “I am keen to do even 
more to put it beyond doubt that this House of Commons is sovereign. We will 
look to do that at the same time as concluding these negotiations.”

Letwin is understood to be examining two ways to deliver on this pledge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/03/boris-johnson-near-agreement-with-cameron-over-eu-deal>
:

 * A declaration that the UK supreme court or another official body would have 
similar powers to those of the German constitutional court, which has the right 
to assess whether legal acts by the EU’s institutions remain within the scope 
of the powers of the EU. 
 * An amendment to legislation to make clear that the UK’s agreement to the 
primacy of EU law – which dates back to 1972 – was gifted by parliament and 
could therefore be withdrawn by parliament. 
Johnson’s talks with the prime minister mainly focused on the sovereignty of 
parliament because that is a matter that rests entirely with the UK government 
and is not part of the EU negotiations. But Downing Street believes it has to 
chart a careful course to win over Johnson without alarming EU leaders who may 
fear that Britain is seeking to overturn one of the key principles of the EU – 
the primacy of EU law.


The London mayor also asked the prime minister about the state of the 
negotiations on restricting in-work benefits, asserting the role of national 
parliaments, giving Britain an opt-out from the EU’s commitment to ever closer 
union and promoting competitiveness. But the EU negotiation package was not the 
main part of their discussions because the mayor accepts that he can bring the 
greatest influence to bear on asserting the sovereignty of parliament.

Boris Johnson tells Cameron he must do more to win his support

only according to our particular interests, otherwise a line is crossed,” he 
said.  
Meanwhile there is a kerfuffle over petrol prices if Britain leaves the EU. 
FairFuelUK, which lobbies for lower fuel prices, is cross with the AA for 
“scaremongering” that a two-car family who refuel twice a month would pay £494 
more for petrol each year if the UK decamps. Howard Cox, Founder of the 
FairFuelUK Campaign argues:

George Osborne “now takes a massive 75% in tax every time we fill up, so you 
tell our supporters what is actually the biggest factor on pump prices? It 
isn’t the EU’s influence or over-paid City analysts’ spreadsheet predictions, 
it’s the government’s colossal and unwarranted fleecing of the motorist!”
 
The president of the European council has written a letter to council members 
ahead of tomorrow’s crunch summit in Brussels 
<http://dsms.consilium.europa.eu/952/Actions/Newsletter.aspx?messageid=3389&customerid=11877&password=enc_3338464439313434_enc>
. Here are the key passages and no prizes on guessing on “those seeking to 
divide us”.

Tomorrow we will meet in the European Council. It will be a crucial moment for 
the unity of our Union and for the future of the United Kingdom’s relations 
withinEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

After my consultations in the last hours I have to state frankly: there is 
still no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. We differ on some political 
issues and I am fully aware that it will be difficult to overcome them. 
Therefore I urge you to remain constructive.

The negotiations are very advanced and we must make use of the momentum. There 
will not be a better time for a compromise. It is our unity that gives us 
strength and we must not lose this. It would be a defeat both for the UK and the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, but a geopolitical 
victory for those who seek to divide us.

We will work on the basis of the proposal that I put forward on the 2nd of 
February, with technical and legal clarifications which have been worked out by 
our Sherpas to be circulated today. But all the political issues will remain 
open for tomorrow. The objective has been clear from the start:to reach a 
legally binding and irreversible agreement which addresses UK concerns, while 
being satisfactory to all. At the same time we will not undermine our 
fundamental values. It is my goal to do the deal this week.
 
Frances O’Grady, head of the Trades Union Congress, says the deal has to have 
something on the table for workers as well as protecting the interests of the 
City and business. She was speaking after meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, 
president of the European commission, in Brussels.

People wanted to know “how is it going to make working lives better,” she told 
BBC News. “There is a real yearning for security in jobs, what it means for me 
and my family.”

Our Dublin correspondent writes: 

A special Irish cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow morning to discuss 
Brexit and David Cameron’s bid to win concessions from the EU on Friday in 
Brussels.

Enda Kenny will take time out from campaigning in the Republic’s general 
election to chair talks on how the Irish government responds to Cameron’s 
demands.

Speaking today on the hustings in Co.Offaly in the Irish midlands, Kenny 
stressed that Ireland wanted the UK to remain inside the EU.

Kenny pointed to the strong trade connections between Britain and Ireland 
which could be put at risk if the UK left the EU.
 
Here is the Guardian’s story on Angela Merkel telling German MPs that 
Cameron’s demands are “comprehensible and justified”.

Angela Merkel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel> has said it is 
in Germany’s national interest for the UK to remain in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, as David Cameron embarked on a round of 
last-minute diplomacy ahead of a crucial summit on Thursday.

Shortly before a summit in Brussels where David Cameron’s reform proposals 
will be thrashed out, the German chancellor appealed for more sympathy and 
understanding for the British position.

The BBC has a useful timetable 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35592466> for tonight and 
the next few days.

A new draft of the whole reform package will be published on the European 
council website this evening - but contentious points such as welfare curbs and 
exempting the UK from “ever closer union” will still need to be nailed down at 
tomorrow’s summit.

Thursday

15:00: EU leaders gather for their regular summit at the European council 
headquarters in Brussels.

16:45: First working session on the UK proposed reforms.

19:00: Working dinner on the migration crisis. Talks on the UK deal could 
resume after dinner and continue late into the night, if there is still no deal.

Friday

08:00: Discussions will continue if no agreement on the UK demands has been 
reached on Thursday. If Cameron gets a deal, he will hold an emergency cabinet 
meeting on Friday evening to reach an agreed position on remaining in the EU, 
although ministers will be free to campaign against in a personal capacity. The 
prime minister may announce the date of the referendum.

 
The French prime minister Manuel Valls has said Britain’s exit from the EU 
would be “a shock” for Europe but that members could not pick and choose rules 
that suit them. Here is AFP’s story. (It wasCharles de Gaulle who twice said 
“non” to Britain’s membership 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/27/newsid_4187000/4187714.stm>
, in 1963 and 1967. De Gaulle - who was suspicious of the US - thought Britain 
would a Trojan horse for the Americans. De Gaulle died in 1970 and Britain 
joined in 1973 under Edward Heath.)

“We believe and we hope” that a deal is possible to keep Britain in the EU, 
Valls told France’s parliament.

“Because the departure of Britain would signify ... a shock for Europe, but 
more importantly a shock to the way the world seesEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, which is already in crisis.”

Valls said France would be “particularly vigilant” on the issues of free 
movement of EU citizens, and relations between countries in the eurozone and 
others.

“Europe should be a place of solidarity between states and we cannot choose ‘a 
la carte’ based on what suits us,” Valls said.

“Europe is a whole that we can adapt, but we can’t rework it only according to 
our particular interests, otherwise a line is crossed.”
 
A French MP has accused Cameron of adopting blackmail tactics worthy of 
Margaret Thatcher.

Alain Tourret, who represents the Calvados department, made the comments in 
the French parliament according to the French broadcaster LCP.

This will be music to the ears of Cameron as he tries to convince Thatcherite 
Eurosceptic MPs that he driving a hard bargain.

Here’s video of Angela Merkel’s comments to the Bundestag about Britain’s 
membership of the EU.
 
The public lacks confidence in Cameron’s ability to get a good deal in 
Brussels but still backs staying in the EU, according to anew Ipsos Mori poll 
<https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3700/Little-change-in-publics-views-towards-Europe-in-last-month-public-still-expects-remain-to-win.aspx>
.

Despite his efforts to achieve a good deal the public still lack confidence in 
the prime minister’s ability to do so. One in three say they have confidence in
David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> (up 3 points) 
and three in five (62%) have little confidence in him (down 1 point). 
Conservative supporters are split with half (50%) confident in Cameron 
achieving a good deal for Britain while 46% say they are not.

AP has fuller write-up of Merkel’s remarks to the Bundestag.

Merkel painted a largely positive picture of chances of an agreement on 
Britain’s EU reform demands. “Germany will make its contribution so that a 
result that satisfies everyone can be achieved, if possible already at the 
summit beginning tomorrow,” she said.

 “I am convinced that is in our national interest for Great Britain to remain 
an active member in a strong and successfulEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>,” she added.

 Merkel said Britain is an ally for Germany in promoting competitiveness and 
free trade, and that “Europe needs Great Britain’s foreign and security policy 
commitment to assert our values and interests in the world.”

 On migrants, Merkel made clear that she won’t be pushing the contentious 
subject of new quotas to distribute migrants around Europe. She reiterated that 
it would be “laughable” forEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> to approve such quotas when it 
has barely started to share refugees under existing agreements.

 “A continent that reacts by sealing (borders) off just behind the maritime 
border, and says ‘we’re not interested in whoever is behind the fence’ I am 
convinced that can’t be the European answer,” she said.

 Despite all the difficulties, Merkel offered an optimistic outlook for this 
week’s meeting though she said that “the discussion on both issues won’t be 
ended with the summit.”

The meeting “is a stage on the road that, so far, has made Europe stronger 
after every crisis,” she said. “And I hope that can be the case this time, too.”

AFP quoted Merkel saying:

“These are not just about Britain’s individual interests on some issues or 
questions, rather it’s about several points that are justified and 
understandable,”

“Like David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron>, I 
believe that it is necessary for the EU to improve our competitiveness, 
transparency and (reduce) bureaucracy. Germany has shared these concerns for 
many years.”

Even the controversial proposal to curb benefits to European Union migrants in 
Britain is “justified and understandable because the jurisdiction for each 
respective social system lies not in Brussels but in each individual member 
state,” she said.

“Therefore, it is only natural for every member state to be able to protect 
its social system against abuse.”

“I share with David Cameron the view that member states that use a currency 
other than the euro should not be ignored in important questions,” she said.

“Our aim must be to prevent discrimination while at the same time allowing for 
a differentiation when necessary,” Merkel said.

She added that this principle was compatible with the fact that the eurozone 
will “continue and is in fact taking the necessary decisions for itself”.

The German leader’s position appeared to run counter to France’s, which had 
made it clear that EU states that do not share the euro should not have any 
power to stop the eurozone from seeking deeper integration.

Tory Eurosceptic MP, John Baron, accused Cameron of “poor” communications with 
his own backbenchers on the EU negotiation after failing to secure a meeting 
with the prime minister over his doubts about the deal.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme Barron said: “I think the 
communication between Number 10 and the backbenchers has been poor. A number of 
us clubbed together and said ‘could we have a meeting’ - 40 MPs signed my 
letter suggesting it would be good to get together and just air these views. We 
have been unsuccessful in obtaining that meeting. Boris Johnson apparently has. 
I wish him well.”

His comments come as Cameron is said to have set aside today to convincing 
Eurosceptics of the merits of the deal.

Baron said the proposed emergency break on benefits was a being “controlled by 
the EU backseat driver”. Mixing his metaphors he added: “It doesn’t solve 
anything, in many respects it’s a smokescreen.”

Baron added: “That is the choice facing the British people in this referendum: 
leave or stay on this conveyor belt towards ever closer union, if we do not 
address this opportunity to address the issue of parliamentary sovereignty once 
and for all ...

“If we could have that guarantee about the supremacy of parliamentary 
sovereignty, so we can control our borders, that we can control our laws and 
our regulations then I might be persuadable. But nothing is on the table yet to 
make me change my mind.”
 
Merkel delivered a powerful message of support for David Cameron’s EU reform 
plans,according to the FT’s Berlin correspondent Stefan Wagstyl 
<http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/02/17/merkel-offers-backing-to-cameron-on-uk-future/>
.

On ever-closer union, she said it should always be “possible for further 
integration” to take place but there was no “obligation for every country to 
join every step”. She also backed Cameron’s proposals to boost the role of 
national parliaments.

“I think it’s in our national interest that Great Britain should remain an 
active member in a strong and successful EU,” she said, adding that Germany and 
the UK had common views on boosting the union’s competitiveness.

Merkel said relations between eurozone and non-eurozone countries should be 
managed in a way that “avoided discrimination” by the eurozone of non-eurozone 
states but the eurozone had to able to “make its own decisions for itself,” for 
example on further reforms.

 
Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> told David Cameron 
that more was needed to win his support in the referendum campaign, writes 
Nicholas Watt.

Nothing had changed, the mayor is said to have remarked and reportedly added 
that more was needed.

A source close to the mayor said he would live up to his commitment to outline 
his position on the EU “with deafening eclat” on Friday if the prime minister 
secures a deal at the EU summit, which opens in Brussels on Thursday afternoon. 
The source said: “The mayor will make everything abundantly clear by the end of 
the week if the prime minister gets a deal on Friday. He is genuinely 
undecided.”

Johnson told Cameron more work was necessary on his plan to assert 
parliament’s sovereignty. Oliver Letwin, the prime minister’s policy chief, has 
been tasked with outlining measures to deliver on his pledge to put that issue 
“beyond doubt”.

Cameron’s vow in the Commons earlier this month came after Johnson asked him 
to explain how his EU reforms would “assert the sovereignty of this House of 
Commons and these Houses of Parliament”. Cameron replied: “I am keen to do even 
more to put it beyond doubt that this House of Commons is sovereign. We will 
look to do that at the same time as concluding these negotiations.”

Letwin is understood to be examining two ways to deliver on this pledge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/03/boris-johnson-near-agreement-with-cameron-over-eu-deal>
:

 * A declaration that the UK supreme court or another official body would have 
similar powers to those of the German constitutional court, which has the right 
to assess whether legal acts by the EU’s institutions remain within the scope 
of the powers of the EU. 
 * An amendment to legislation to make clear that the UK’s agreement to the 
primacy of EU law – which dates back to 1972 – was gifted by parliament and 
could therefore be withdrawn by parliament. 
Johnson’s talks with the prime minister mainly focused on the sovereignty of 
parliament because that is a matter that rests entirely with the UK government 
and is not part of the EU negotiations. But Downing Street believes it has to 
chart a careful course to win over Johnson without alarming EU leaders who may 
fear that Britain is seeking to overturn one of the key principles of the EU – 
the primacy of EU law.


The London mayor also asked the prime minister about the state of the 
negotiations on restricting in-work benefits, asserting the role of national 
parliaments, giving Britain an opt-out from the EU’s commitment to ever closer 
union and promoting competitiveness. But the EU negotiation package was not the 
main part of their discussions because the mayor accepts that he can bring the 
greatest influence to bear on asserting the sovereignty of parliament.
