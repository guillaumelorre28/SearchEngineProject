A teenager whose body was found near the entrance to a park 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-38436316> in Derbyshire may 
have died elsewhere, detectives believe.

Police said 17-year-old Han Lam, also known as Hoang Trung, was Vietnamese and 
had connections to the Birmingham area.

His body was discovered at Heanor Memorial Park at 9pm on Christmas Day and 
officers are now appealing for information about a Toyota Avensis which was 
seen in the area.

A postmortem examination did not reveal the cause of his death and further 
tests are due to be carried out.

DS Adam Gascoigne, who is leading the investigation, said: “We know that the 
car was in the Heanor area between 11am and midday on Christmas Day and I’m 
asking anyone who has CCTV or dashboard cameras to check their footage for that 
time.

“If they find any images of the dark grey Avensis they should contact me on 
101.

“Previously we were asking for anyone who had seen anything suspicious during 
the afternoon. That timescale has now widened.

“Mr Lam’s death remains unexplained and we believe he may have died in a 
different place to where he was found.”
