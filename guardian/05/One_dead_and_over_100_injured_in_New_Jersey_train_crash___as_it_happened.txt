Closing summary

Officials still don’t know the cause of a commuter train crash in New Jersey‘s 
Hoboken rail station, which left at least one person dead and 108 people 
injured. Local and federal investigators are on the scene, working to determine 
the cause of the morning rush hour crash.

We’re closing the live blog for now, but will be back with any major updates. 
Here’s what we currently know about today’s accident:

 * The one person killed in the accident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed3860e4b035c40686bb13#block-57ed3860e4b035c40686bb13>
 was on the platform and hit by falling debris, said New Jersey governor Chris 
Christie. Most of those injured were inside the train.

 * Witnesses said the train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-injuries>
, heading from upstate New York to Hoboken, “plowed” into the station at a high 
speed. Part of the station’s roof collapsed in the devastating accident.

 * Though the cause of the accident is unknown, officials said that the train 
was definitelytraveling at a high-speed into the station 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed5a1ce4b07f65489d8482#block-57ed5a1ce4b07f65489d8482>
. It then overran the tracks until it was stopped by crashing into a wall.

 * Parts of the terminal remain closed, though a portion of it used for the 
PATH commuter train service has been re-opened 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed560ce4b07f65489d8471#block-57ed560ce4b07f65489d8471>
 after engineers determined that section was structurally safe.

 * Federal investigators said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed4800e4b07f65489d8421#block-57ed4800e4b07f65489d8421>
, as part of their investigation, they would look at a crash at the same 
station in 2011, when a Path commuter train hit the bumpers at the end of the 
tracks, injuring more than 30 people.

Christie updated the injury count to 108 people. He said right now, there is 
still only one fatality.

He and Cuomo went on to emphasize that the pair has worked together many times 
to respond to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other crises.

Both men have been governors since 2010, working closely as the heads of the 
neighboring states.

Christie said he could not remember a time in the history of either state, 
when two governors together had been “more tested” by crises. He said the first 
call he received this morning, after speaking with his staff about the 
accident, was from Cuomo, who cancelled a trip to Israel to respond to the 
crisis.

Christie also spoke of the region’s resiliency. Christie said: “This region 
has developed a resilience that is admired by the rest of the world because of 
how we’ve been tested”.

The person killed in the accident was standing on the platform and hit by 
debris, said Christie. He did not provide more details on the victim.

Christie said the “most important thing” is to address is the structural 
safety of the building.

He reiterated that they don’t know why the train crashed, all they know is 
that it came in “at much too high of speed,” he said.

“We have no indication that this is anything other than a tragic accident,” 
Christie said, adding that it is still the early stage of the investigation.

“We know what happened, we don’t know why it happened,” said New York governor 
Andrew Cuomo.

“The silver-lining is there has only been one fatality so far,” he said, 
noting that the devastation from the crash suggested there could have been more 
fatalities.

Cuomo said: “These are difficult times over these past weeks and months, 
between terrorist attacks, natural disasters, we have had our hands full in 
this country, we have had our hands full in the north-east”.

But, he added, all these things have been dealt with because people are 
working together.

Governor: cause of accident unknown

New Jersey <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> governor Chris 
Christie is up first.

“We’re not going to speculate on the cause of the accident,” Christie said. 

He said he and Cuomo have been in constant communication through the day. 
Christie has also spoken with the White House about the accident.

“We pray for the victims and their families,” Christie said. 

He said that structural engineers were inspecting the integrity of the 
building. A portion of the building used for PATH commuter trains has been 
deemed safe.

It is too soon to know when the terminal will re-open, Christie said.

More details on the crash from freight train conductor, William Blaine, who 
said he felt “death was following” him after he saw the train crash.

Blaine said he was just outside of view of the train in a nearby Dunkin’ 
Donuts when he heard a “kaboom” and “the whole place shook”. He ran to the 
track, he said, to try and help.

Blaine said the train came into Hoboken station fast – around 30mph. 
Typically, he said, a train would slow down as it pulled into the station at 
30, then 20, 15, and then one or two miles per hour until it hits a bumper at 
the end of the platform.

US railroads have until 31 Dec 2018 to install a system that is designed to 
slow speeding trains, but the train that crashed was not yet equipped with the 
system, according to the AP.

The technology is called positive train control and the deadline to install it 
has repeatedly been extended to reach its current 2018 date.


The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. The 
federal agency is scheduled to provide an update on the crash at 12:45p ET.

Officials still don’t know the cause of a commuter train crash in New Jersey‘s 
Hoboken rail station, which left at least one person dead and 108 people 
injured. Local and federal investigators are on the scene, working to determine 
the cause of the morning rush hour crash.

We’re closing the live blog for now, but will be back with any major updates. 
Here’s what we currently know about today’s accident:

 * The one person killed in the accident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed3860e4b035c40686bb13#block-57ed3860e4b035c40686bb13>
 was on the platform and hit by falling debris, said New Jersey governor Chris 
Christie. Most of those injured were inside the train.

 * Witnesses said the train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-injuries>
, heading from upstate New York to Hoboken, “plowed” into the station at a high 
speed. Part of the station’s roof collapsed in the devastating accident.

 * Though the cause of the accident is unknown, officials said that the train 
was definitelytraveling at a high-speed into the station 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed5a1ce4b07f65489d8482#block-57ed5a1ce4b07f65489d8482>
. It then overran the tracks until it was stopped by crashing into a wall.

 * Parts of the terminal remain closed, though a portion of it used for the 
PATH commuter train service has been re-opened 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed560ce4b07f65489d8471#block-57ed560ce4b07f65489d8471>
 after engineers determined that section was structurally safe.

 * Federal investigators said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/29/new-jersey-train-crash-hoboken-live-updates?page=with:block-57ed4800e4b07f65489d8421#block-57ed4800e4b07f65489d8421>
, as part of their investigation, they would look at a crash at the same 
station in 2011, when a Path commuter train hit the bumpers at the end of the 
tracks, injuring more than 30 people.

Christie updated the injury count to 108 people. He said right now, there is 
still only one fatality.

He and Cuomo went on to emphasize that the pair has worked together many times 
to respond to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other crises.

Both men have been governors since 2010, working closely as the heads of the 
neighboring states.

Christie said he could not remember a time in the history of either state, 
when two governors together had been “more tested” by crises. He said the first 
call he received this morning, after speaking with his staff about the 
accident, was from Cuomo, who cancelled a trip to Israel to respond to the 
crisis.

Christie also spoke of the region’s resiliency. Christie said: “This region 
has developed a resilience that is admired by the rest of the world because of 
how we’ve been tested”.
 
The person killed in the accident was standing on the platform and hit by 
debris, said Christie. He did not provide more details on the victim.

Christie said the “most important thing” is to address is the structural 
safety of the building.

He reiterated that they don’t know why the train crashed, all they know is 
that it came in “at much too high of speed,” he said.

“We have no indication that this is anything other than a tragic accident,” 
Christie said, adding that it is still the early stage of the investigation.
 
“We know what happened, we don’t know why it happened,” said New York governor 
Andrew Cuomo.

“The silver-lining is there has only been one fatality so far,” he said, 
noting that the devastation from the crash suggested there could have been more 
fatalities.

Cuomo said: “These are difficult times over these past weeks and months, 
between terrorist attacks, natural disasters, we have had our hands full in 
this country, we have had our hands full in the north-east”.

But, he added, all these things have been dealt with because people are 
working together.
 
New Jersey <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> governor Chris 
Christie is up first.

“We’re not going to speculate on the cause of the accident,” Christie said. 

He said he and Cuomo have been in constant communication through the day. 
Christie has also spoken with the White House about the accident.

“We pray for the victims and their families,” Christie said. 

He said that structural engineers were inspecting the integrity of the 
building. A portion of the building used for PATH commuter trains has been 
deemed safe.

It is too soon to know when the terminal will re-open, Christie said. 
 
New Jersey <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> governor Chris 
Christie and New York governor Andrew Cuomo are scheduled to provide a update 
on the crash in 10 minutes.

We’ll have live updates from the briefing. 

Until then, here’s the latest news story on this morning’s crash:

More details on the crash from freight train conductor, William Blaine, who 
said he felt “death was following” him after he saw the train crash.

Blaine said he was just outside of view of the train in a nearby Dunkin’ 
Donuts when he heard a “kaboom” and “the whole place shook”. He ran to the 
track, he said, to try and help.

Blaine said the train came into Hoboken station fast – around 30mph. 
Typically, he said, a train would slow down as it pulled into the station at 
30, then 20, 15, and then one or two miles per hour until it hits a bumper at 
the end of the platform.
