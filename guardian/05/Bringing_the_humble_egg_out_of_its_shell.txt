If you have an egg you have a meal. Eggs allow us to conjure all kinds of 
culinary magic. Eggs make a meal of something that otherwise might seem too 
slim or too simple. Whether it’s dipping a buttered soldier into a runny yolk 
or crowning a simple plate of roasted ratatouille or humble lentils with a 
crisp edged, cheery yolked fried egg.Eggs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/eggs> make a meal.

I once cooked for Prince Charles who, I was told, takes an egg with almost 
every meal – a wise man. I carefully poached one and sat it on top of his plate 
of spring risotto. I think of that meal every time I poach an egg, which 
actually isn’t that often as John, my husband-to-be, is the head poacher in our 
house.

I keep a little bowl of eggs next to our cooker. They come in all shades of 
blue, cream, brown and ivory but mostly I find myself reaching for the 
blue-shelled ones. They remind me of a still-life painting, most of all the 
Cedric Morris cover of Elizabeth David’s classic, An Omelette and a Glass of 
Wine.

The bowl gets emptied a couple of times a week when we haven’t planned a meal 
or made it to the shops. We make French-style curdy herb omelettes, we softly 
scramble them, we spike them with chilli and wrap them in tortillas with spicy 
black beans for a hearty brunch and we fry them until crisp-edged for quick 
suppers with leftover fried potatoes and veg and a couple of spoonfuls of good 
chutney. It goes without saying that organic, free-range eggs should be used 
whenever possible. The sunnier the egg, the happier the eater.

Roast shallots and greens with baked eggs

This is a light, bright, late-spring brunch of baked eggs, courgettes, 
artichokes, sweet caramelised shallots and bright greens, all doused in the 
sunshine-mellow yellow of saffron.

Serves 4
8 banana shallots
2 tbsp olive oil
Sea salt
4 small or 2 large courgettes, cut into 1cm coins
2 garlic cloves, crushed
2 heads of spring greens, washed and finely sliced
4 cooked artichoke hearts, halved
A pinch of saffron, soaked in 50ml boiling water
4 eggs

 To serve


A small bunch of parsley, chopped
A small bunch of mint, chopped 
A dollop of natural yoghurt
Chilli flakes (optional)

1 Peel the shallots, then slice them in half from root to tip. Warm the olive 
oil in a heavy-based, shallow pan that can go in the oven. Add the shallots and 
a big pinch of salt and lightly brown them on both sides. Keep the heat 
moderate. Set the oven at 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

2 When the shallots are soft, push them to one side and add the courgettes and 
garlic to the other side of the pan, cook for a few of minutes until the 
courgettes begin to turn golden. Then add the greens, artichokes, saffron water 
and another pinch of salt, and cook for a minute or two until the greens have 
just wilted, then transfer the whole pan to the oven.

3 Bake the vegetables for 15 minutes to allow the shallots and courgettes to 
roast and soften. Remove the pan from the oven and make four small, shallow 
hollows among the vegetables, then crack an egg into each of them. Return the 
vegetables and eggs to the oven for 4-5 minutes, until the whites are just set 
and the yolks are still runny. Serve with some chopped mint and parsley, a 
dollop of yoghurt and a sprinkle of chilli flakes, if you like.

Lentils, herbs and a fried egg

This has become a staple quick dinner in our household. When I have a little 
longer, I cook the lentils from scratch but in a fix a tin of puy lentils works 
extremely well.

The lentils have an agrodolce (sweet from the currants and tart from the 
capers) which I love. It’s a quick and simple way of layering up the flavour 
without too much faff. The egg crowns the lentils and the just-right yolk 
dresses the lentils once it’s broken into the bowl.

Serves 4
A splash of olive oil or coconut oil
1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped
½ tsp each of cumin, coriander, tumeric, cinnamon, chilli powder
Salt and black pepper
2 x 400g tin of puy lentils or 600g home cooked lentils
2 tbsp small capers
2 tbsp currants
4 eggs

 To serve
A handful of soft herbs, chopped
A few handfuls of rocket
A dollop of natural yoghurt

1 Heat a frying pan on a medium heat with a little oil. Once hot add the onion 
and fry for 10 minutes until soft. Add the spices and fry for another minute.

2 Add the lentils and 50ml of water and cook for 5 minutes until warm.

3 Fry the eggs in a little olive or coconut oil and season well. Sometimes I 
fry them until the edges crisp up, sometimes I flip them over easy, but I 
always keep the yolk runny.

4 Finish the lentils by stirring in the capers and currants, then pile the 
lentils on plates, top with an egg, a spoonful of yoghurt and a scattering of 
rocket leaves and herbs.

It starts with an egg …
