Winning tip: a stay in the Dana nature reserve

Book a night in one of the beautifully renovated rooms at Dana Hotel, with 
their whitewashed walls, modern bathrooms, comfy beds and amazing views. For 
dinner, ask the owner of the only restaurant in Dana village to whip you up a 
feast. There’s no menu: just trust him – he knows what he’s doing. Breakfast is 
on the hotel’s rooftop overlooking Dana valley. Once you’re done, walk through 
the tiny village and into the valley itself, in Jordan’s largest nature 
reserve: it’s a breathtaking landscape perfect for hardened hikers and relaxed 
ramblers alike. Heaven, and far from the tourist-bus trail.

Ninety minutes’ drive south of Amman, the Wadi Mujib river bursts through the 
harsh landscape (in the Mujib nature reserve) via a stunning gorge to enter the 
Dead Sea, one of the planet’s most sodium-rich bodies of water, at 420 metres 
below sea level. The concept of the expedition is simple: follow the river 
until you reach the impressive waterfall hidden within the canyon. Along the 
way you will be challenged by strengthening currents and increasingly complex 
and difficult rocks to boulder over (most are equipped with rails and ropes to 
help you). Apart from its breathtaking beauty, immersing yourself in the Wadi 
Mujib is a ferociously fun activity.

Not far from Madaba, alongside the King’s Highway, Wadi Hidan is a 4km canyon 
that can be traversed on pleasant half-day trip from Amman. A beautiful black 
basaltic gorge, it is interspersed with freshwater pools and exotic vegetation. 
The 9km hike is rewarded with a magnificent waterfall at the end. It is easily 
tackled independently, but great tours are offered byTropical Desert 
<http://www.tdtrips.me/>, a local adventure tourism company. On the way back to 
Amman, stop inHaret Jdoudna <http://www.haretjdoudna.com/> in Madaba off King 
Tala St (+962 5324 8650, haretjdoudna.com) for one of the best meals you can 
have in Jordan.

When T E Lawrence crossed Jordan’s desert, he found himself in a vast gorge, 
where red rock monoliths rose more than 800 metres around thin sandy corridors. 
Those who wish to follow in his footsteps and witness this incredible landscape 
can take camel treks from Wadi Rum with several local outfits; we usedBedouin 
Traditions Camp <http://www.wadirumbedouintraditions.com/en/>. The real treat 
is connecting with the culture of the Zalabia Bedouin, the descendants of those 
tribesmen who joined Lawrence in revolt. Eating lamb cooked slowly in a sand 
oven in the company of the Bedouin, camping out under the stars and watching 
the sun set makes the desert come alive.

Leave Petra’s main trail behind, and try something different: hire a Bedouin 
guide, to take you to Jabal Haroun, one of Jordan’s holiest sites. This 
strenuous hike offers a journey through areas that many tourists never see. 
You’ll glimpse the lives of Bedouin families still living among the Nabatean 
tombs and caves. The views are extraordinary on this tranquil trail, the 
silence broken only by the calls of the Bedouin, the bells of their grazing 
livestock, and birdsong. The return journey from Qasr al-Bint will take about 
six hours, including a break for lunch and time to enjoy the views from the 
hilltop shrine. I used Hammad Bdoul (+962 7753 28253) who charged JOD150 (£170) 
for his services, which included a donkey and a basic picnic lunch.

Between the chaos of downtown Amman and the hipster cafes of Jabal Luweibdeh 
is my oasis, Darat Al Funun. Set in herb-scented gardens with fountains and 
overlooking the ancient Roman ruins of the citadel, this magical arts complex 
is a delight. You can walk through a sixth-century Byzantine church and a Roman 
temple while contemplating Amman’s rich histories. Its library is the place 
where Lawrence of Arabia wrote his memoirs; and on one of its rooftops the 
Palestinian space agency has satellite equipment. Darat al-Funin is free to 
enter, with a cafe run by Rumi, a very hip local restaurant.

books@cafe in Rainbow Street is a place to absorb the glorious diversity that 
still exists peacefully in Jordan. The place oozes bohemian charm and 
intellectual tolerance. The food and drinks are great value, but even if they 
weren’t, a visit is worth it, to appreciate books@cafe’s independent history 
and continued existence. Also, from the sweet-smelling bougainvillea-filled 
roof terrace, you get magical views of bustling city life and the magnificent 
Abu Darwish mosque.

Jabal Weibdeh was founded and is run by an amazing Jordanian/Italian woman I 
volunteered with. The cuisine is varied but rooted in the Middle East, and the 
business is run with a social conscience. If you are looking to satisfy sweet 
cravings with something other from baklava I’d suggest a visit toSugar Daddy’s 
Bakery <https://m.facebook.com/SugarDaddysBakery/> flagship store in the 
southern Abdoun district for beautifully designed cakes. A lot of locals and

<https://m.facebook.com/pages/Vinaigrette/258593807506867> serves great sushi 
and has stunning views. The slightly dilapidated lower half of the building 
belies its sleek interior, with floor-to-ceiling windows and huge boats of

Taxi drivers will attempt to bring you to expensive resorts geared for Western 
tourists. If you are interested in the floating experience without the extra 
frills of a resort, ask a local where they go. We were guided to a small beach 
with very cheap entrance fees, where we were the only foreigners. Obviously 
show some cultural sensitivity – you may have to wear T-shirt and shorts in the 
water rather than a swimsuit. We were floating alongside women in full burqas! 
My family of two adults and two young children were well-received – the 
children loved floating in the Dead Sea.

The main road alongside the Dead Sea passes the Dead Sea Museum, which calls 
itself the Lowest Point on Earth Museum. It has air conditioning, superb 
historical displays with English text, a shop, and nice, clean toilets. From 
here, take a gentle walk up to Lot’s Cave, which is still being excavated 
following the fairly recent discovery of an ancient Byzantine monastery. It is 
a rich archaeological site. And the view is outstanding.

In the north-west corner of Jordan, on the borders of Israel and Syria, with 
Saudi Arabia way over the hills, lies the Roman town of Umm Qais. Perched high 
on a plateau, this is a serene place, shared with the few tourists who venture 
this far. It has Roman columns aplenty, a wonderful die-straight street, and a 
magnificently sited restaurant for hummus with the best view in Jordan. The 
Golan Heights and the Sea of Galilee lie biblically in the hazy distance and, 
to the right, the hulking mountains of Syria, treeless, deserted and incredibly 
close.

Hadrian’s name and influence is far-reaching; however, as you enter the 
ancient city of Jerash through the spectacular Hadrian’s Arch you are offered a 
unique insight into what life in a Roman city must have been like. Easily 
accessible from Amman, this well-preserved ruin is often overlooked in favour 
of Jordan’s better-known attractions. Taking a guided tour helps you to 
visualise the past and you may even be lucky enough to be invited into your 
guide’s family home for coffee. From Amman, it’s a one-hour ride on a bus from 
North Station (about £1) or in a taxi (£45). Entrance is £5.50, tour guides £30.
