So that’s IT for another Strictly week! Thank you as ever for your brilliant 
comments, they make my week. I’ll be back next week for the HALLOWEEN SPECIAL, 
so join me at 6.45pm next Saturday and we’ll get our freak on. In the meantime 
you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so come and say hi. Have a brilliant 
week! Hx

Lesley and Anton say lovely things about each other, and dance their final 
dance like your drunk aunt and uncle at a wedding. Just as it should be.

Craig saves Daisy and Aljaz, as does Darcey. Bruno does likewise, and Len 
would have done the same. So LESLEY AND ANTON are going home.

Ah, I’m sorry to see Lesley go, she was incredible. But she didn’t have the 
best of weeks and was never going to survive a dance-off against Daisy and 
Aljaz.

Time for a reprise of Daisy and Aljaz’s Charleston. The timing on this looks 
better too, but still a bit lacklustre for my liking. I suspect they’ve done 
more than enough, however.

But first we have to get through another round of Mystic Meg and Rupert The 
Bear do the Tango. Lesley’s footwork looks considerably better, but she’s still 
wearing her shoulders as earmuffs. A big improvement, however.

See this is the problem with the Dance Off – you have to see through the two 
dances you enjoyed least. I’m going to watch Daisy and Aljaz’s Charleston 
carefully, as I didn’t think it was all that, but the judges really enjoyed it.

Crikey, the Ed Balls train has got up a head of steam – how high up the public 
vote must he have been to beat Daisy and Aljaz? I can’t actually answer that as 
my maths is terrible, but I’m guessing he must have been pretty near the top.


He’ll stay until Halloween, and then the backlash will begin, happens every 
year.

So who is joining Lesley and Anton in tonight’s bottom two? Ed and Katya are 
safe! Goodness me. They’re joined next week by Danny and Oti, Anastacia and 
Gorka (YAY GORKA) and Greg and Natalie!

Which means DAISY AND ALJAZ are in the bottom two! Bye Lesley, we loved you 
very much.

So that’s IT for another Strictly week! Thank you as ever for your brilliant 
comments, they make my week. I’ll be back next week for the HALLOWEEN SPECIAL, 
so join me at 6.45pm next Saturday and we’ll get our freak on. In the meantime 
you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so come and say hi. Have a brilliant 
week! Hx
 
Lesley and Anton say lovely things about each other, and dance their final 
dance like your drunk aunt and uncle at a wedding. Just as it should be.
 
Craig saves Daisy and Aljaz, as does Darcey. Bruno does likewise, and Len 
would have done the same. So LESLEY AND ANTON are going home.

Ah, I’m sorry to see Lesley go, she was incredible. But she didn’t have the 
best of weeks and was never going to survive a dance-off against Daisy and 
Aljaz.
 
Time for a reprise of Daisy and Aljaz’s Charleston. The timing on this looks 
better too, but still a bit lacklustre for my liking. I suspect they’ve done 
more than enough, however.
 
But first we have to get through another round of Mystic Meg and Rupert The 
Bear do the Tango. Lesley’s footwork looks considerably better, but she’s still 
wearing her shoulders as earmuffs. A big improvement, however.
 
See this is the problem with the Dance Off – you have to see through the two 
dances you enjoyed least. I’m going to watch Daisy and Aljaz’s Charleston 
carefully, as I didn’t think it was all that, but the judges really enjoyed it.
 
In case you were in any way unclear, it’s Halloween Week next week. I’m 
already over it.
 
Crikey, the Ed Balls train has got up a head of steam – how high up the public 
vote must he have been to beat Daisy and Aljaz? I can’t actually answer that as 
my maths is terrible, but I’m guessing he must have been pretty near the top.


He’ll stay until Halloween, and then the backlash will begin, happens every 
year.

Gorka (YAY GORKA) and Greg and Natalie!
