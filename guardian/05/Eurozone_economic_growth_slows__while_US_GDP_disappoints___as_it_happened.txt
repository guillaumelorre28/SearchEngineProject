US consumer confidence slips on Brexit concerns

US consumers were less confident in July than the previous month, according to 
a new survey, partly due to the Brexit vote.

The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index  
<http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/>came in at 90 for July, lower than the 90.5 
expected but up on the preliminary reading of 89.5. The final figure for the 
previous month was 93.5. The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said:

Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the 
Sentiment Index was still below last month’s level mainly due to increased 
concerns about economic prospects among upper income households.

The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households 
with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among 
households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt 
rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is 
surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as 
immediately following the Brexit vote.

While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for 
the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic 
prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in 
their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in 
personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now 
expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017.

Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, 
better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June.

Wall Street opens lower

Following the weaker than expected US GDP figures, as well as disappointing 
results from Exxon and Chevron, it is no surprise that US markets have opened 
lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15% while 
the S&P 500 opened 0.08% lower. But Nasdaq edged up 0.14% after positive 
updates from Alphabet and Amazon.

Meanwhile over in Ireland, three bankers from banks that almost bankrupted 
Ireland have been sent to jail today by a Dublin court, writes Ireland 
correspondent Henry McDonald:

The trio from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank and the taxpayer rescued Irish 
Life & Permanent were given prison sentences for their part in a conspiracy to 
inflate the accounts of financial institutions by €7.2 bn.

Ex-Anglo Irish Bank chief risk officer Willie McAteer has been sentenced to 
three and a half years. Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was 
handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life & 
Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail

The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by 
Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a 
“reprehensible manner” and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood 
accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank’s books to make it look like it had 
€7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between 
the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&Permanent.

Judge Nolan said the case was one where “honesty and integrity was sorely 
lacking.” Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan 
said: “It is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.”

All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. 
During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst & Young for its 
role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank’s accounts: “It beggars belief that Ernst 
& Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true 
and fair is a mystery to me.”

Judge Nolan added: “They should have known what was occurring if they were 
doing their job properly.”

In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised 
with the Irish taxpayer having to pay €30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the 
preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the 
bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and 
investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland.

Here’s our report on the US GDP figures:

The US economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> grew by just 
1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as 
cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending.

The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing 
economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and 
businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that 
gross domestic product (GDP) – the broadest measure of the economy’s health – 
would increaseat a 2.6% annual rate 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN1071IS> after rising at a 
rate of 1.1% in the first quarter.

The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday. The economy has now grown 
at an annual rate of less than 2% for three straight quarters.

The full story is here:

Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at foreign exchange business Foenix Partners, 
also believes a US rate rise is now unlikely this year:

Janet Yellen will continue to sit on the fence with interest rates for the 
foreseeable future on disappointing news this afternoon that US GDP increased 
to a sluggish 1.2%, on preliminary figures where analysts had expectations of 
an uplift to 2.6%. Rhetoric from the Federal Reserve lately has been somewhat 
cautious, meaning the significant miss of growth figures will put the bearish 
committee members back in the driving seat. With global risk appetite tentative 
on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is 
often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures 
signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only 
will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will 
be adversely affected in the medium term.

1.59pm BST 13:59  <> 

Despite a weaker than expected US GDP number, the underlying picture is more 
mixed, said economist James Smith at ING Bank:

The US economy grew by less than expected in the second quarter, growing by 
just 1.2% quarter on quarter (annualised). That said, the underlying picture is 
on balance slightly more encouraging than this headline suggests. Consumption 
in particular was very strong, increasing by 4.2% quarter on 
quarter(annualised) and follows some solid retail sales data over the past few 
months. There was also a large drag from inventories, which shaved -1.16% from 
the headline, which given that this in the most part is simply noise, the 
underlying growth picture was probably closer to 2% in the second quarter.

However, business investment continues to provide some cause for 
concern...There were also a series of negative backward revisions to overall 
GDP, suggesting that trend growth has been slightly lower over the past year or 
so than previously thought.

Overall though, this release is probably fairly neutral for the Fed, with 
strong consumer activity balancing out with the fall in investment. Indeed, 
with recent evidence tentatively suggesting that the recent shortfall in job 
creation was a temporary blip and inflation gradually moving in the right 
direction, there is fairly minimal cause for concern regarding the domestic 
economic picture.

However, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee has got its eye firmly on 
“global economic and financial developments”, which we think refers to 
uncertainty following Brexit and forthcoming political developments in the US 
and Europe. Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently 
strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious 
(although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US 
Presidential Election in November. That said, assuming the domestic economy 
continues to head in the right direction, then we think there is a strong 
likelihood of a rate hike in early 2017. We may see FOMC speakers trying to 
guide markets closer to this point over coming days and weeks.

Pointing out the US GDP figures were subject to revision, the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis,said 
<http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm>:

The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive 
contributions from personal consumption expenditures and exports that were 
partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, 
nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and 
local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation 
of GDP, decreased.

US economic growth misses forecasts

Further mixed signals from the US economy, with second quarter annualised GDP 
growth coming in at 1.2%, much lower than the 2.6% expected by analysts but up 
from the 0.8% seen in the first quarter.

The figures back up the Federal Reserve’s decision not to raise interest rates 
this week. And they may not necessarily rule out an increase later in the year 
although they do seen to make it less likely.

US consumers were less confident in July than the previous month, according to 
a new survey, partly due to the Brexit vote.

The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index  
<http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/>came in at 90 for July, lower than the 90.5 
expected but up on the preliminary reading of 89.5. The final figure for the 
previous month was 93.5. The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said:

Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the 
Sentiment Index was still below last month’s level mainly due to increased 
concerns about economic prospects among upper income households.

The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households 
with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among 
households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt 
rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is 
surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as 
immediately following the Brexit vote.

While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for 
the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic 
prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in 
their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in 
personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now 
expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017.

Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, 
better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June.

Following the weaker than expected US GDP figures, as well as disappointing 
results from Exxon and Chevron, it is no surprise that US markets have opened 
lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15% while 
the S&P 500 opened 0.08% lower. But Nasdaq edged up 0.14% after positive 
updates from Alphabet and Amazon.
 
Meanwhile over in Ireland, three bankers from banks that almost bankrupted 
Ireland have been sent to jail today by a Dublin court, writes Ireland 
correspondent Henry McDonald:

The trio from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank and the taxpayer rescued Irish 
Life & Permanent were given prison sentences for their part in a conspiracy to 
inflate the accounts of financial institutions by €7.2 bn.

Ex-Anglo Irish Bank chief risk officer Willie McAteer has been sentenced to 
three and a half years. Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was 
handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life & 
Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail

The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by 
Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a 
“reprehensible manner” and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood 
accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank’s books to make it look like it had 
€7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between 
the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&Permanent.

Judge Nolan said the case was one where “honesty and integrity was sorely 
lacking.” Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan 
said: “It is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.”

All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. 
During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst & Young for its 
role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank’s accounts: “It beggars belief that Ernst 
& Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true 
and fair is a mystery to me.”

Judge Nolan added: “They should have known what was occurring if they were 
doing their job properly.”

In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised 
with the Irish taxpayer having to pay €30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the 
preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the 
bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and 
investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland.
 
Here’s our report on the US GDP figures:

The US economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> grew by just 
1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as 
cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending.

The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing 
economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and 
businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that 
gross domestic product (GDP) – the broadest measure of the economy’s health – 
would increaseat a 2.6% annual rate 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN1071IS> after rising at a 
rate of 1.1% in the first quarter.

The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday. The economy has now grown 
at an annual rate of less than 2% for three straight quarters.

Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at foreign exchange business Foenix Partners, 
also believes a US rate rise is now unlikely this year:

Janet Yellen will continue to sit on the fence with interest rates for the 
foreseeable future on disappointing news this afternoon that US GDP increased 
to a sluggish 1.2%, on preliminary figures where analysts had expectations of 
an uplift to 2.6%. Rhetoric from the Federal Reserve lately has been somewhat 
cautious, meaning the significant miss of growth figures will put the bearish 
committee members back in the driving seat. With global risk appetite tentative 
on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is 
often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures 
signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only 
will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will 
be adversely affected in the medium term.

yen has also extended its gains against the US currency.
 
Despite a weaker than expected US GDP number, the underlying picture is more 
mixed, said economist James Smith at ING Bank:

The US economy grew by less than expected in the second quarter, growing by 
just 1.2% quarter on quarter (annualised). That said, the underlying picture is 
on balance slightly more encouraging than this headline suggests. Consumption 
in particular was very strong, increasing by 4.2% quarter on 
quarter(annualised) and follows some solid retail sales data over the past few 
months. There was also a large drag from inventories, which shaved -1.16% from 
the headline, which given that this in the most part is simply noise, the 
underlying growth picture was probably closer to 2% in the second quarter.

However, business investment continues to provide some cause for 
concern...There were also a series of negative backward revisions to overall 
GDP, suggesting that trend growth has been slightly lower over the past year or 
so than previously thought.

Overall though, this release is probably fairly neutral for the Fed, with 
strong consumer activity balancing out with the fall in investment. Indeed, 
with recent evidence tentatively suggesting that the recent shortfall in job 
creation was a temporary blip and inflation gradually moving in the right 
direction, there is fairly minimal cause for concern regarding the domestic 
economic picture.

However, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee has got its eye firmly on 
“global economic and financial developments”, which we think refers to 
uncertainty following Brexit and forthcoming political developments in the US 
and Europe. Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently 
strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious 
(although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US 
Presidential Election in November. That said, assuming the domestic economy 
continues to head in the right direction, then we think there is a strong 
likelihood of a rate hike in early 2017. We may see FOMC speakers trying to 
guide markets closer to this point over coming days and weeks.
 
Pointing out the US GDP figures were subject to revision, the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis,said 
<http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm>:

The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive 
contributions from personal consumption expenditures and exports that were 
partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, 
nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and 
local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation 
of GDP, decreased.

US Q2 GDP 1.2% is a big miss on consensus of 2.6%, but the market was already 
positioned down at 1.8% where the AtlantaFed tracker was

Further mixed signals from the US economy, with second quarter annualised GDP 
growth coming in at 1.2%, much lower than the 2.6% expected by analysts but up 
from the 0.8% seen in the first quarter.

The figures back up the Federal Reserve’s decision not to raise interest rates 
this week. And they may not necessarily rule out an increase later in the year 
although they do seen to make it less likely.
