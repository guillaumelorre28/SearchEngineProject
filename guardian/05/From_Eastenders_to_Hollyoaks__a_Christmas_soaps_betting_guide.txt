6/1: A triple Mitchell funeral

EastEnders’ previous form A Mitchell death is as traditional as turkey: lest 
we forget that time little Jamie was run over and his spleen finally gave out 
on Christmas Day.

This year’s going Entertainingly turbulent sisters Ronnie and Roxy are due to 
leave Walford and won’t go quietly, plus Phil’s failing liver could go bang any 
minute. Merry Christmas, Mitchell-style!

1,000/1: Tracy Barlow doesn’t kill anyone at the Corrie nativity

Coronation Street’s previous form There’s always an incident at the nativity: 
a drunk mother, a fight over the manger, and that time when Katy gave birth 
dressed as the Virgin Mary.

This year’s going It’s been a vintage 2016 for La Barlow, a woman so evil she 
“rooted for the iceberg” watching Titanic. She loves a festive punch-up and 
with a bag load of Barlows back on the street, she’s on fighting form.

5/1: A Dingle -dong merrily on high

Emmerdale’s previous form Hotten’s most wayward family, the Dingles have more 
festive rows than most. Patriarch Zak, with his face like a disappointed sheep, 
ran off with temptress Joanie last year.

This year’s going Scheming queen Charity is out of the picture, but her 
daughter Debbie is due to return and teen tearaway™ Belle is currently slaying 
the storylines. In summary, stand by for some proper soap carnage.

100/1: Archie Mitchell is resurrected on Christmas Day

EastEnders’ previous form Death is no barrier to a comeback in Walford. So 
it’ll take more than being killed on Christmas Day 2009 in a legendary lamping 
with that Queen Vic bust to stop evil Archie.

This year’s going After Larry Lamb’s success in I’m A Celebrity, a return to 
EastEnders has been touted, despite the finality of his demise. Suspend your 
disbelief and lock your doors.

4/5: The Gloved Hand Killer strikes again from beyond the grave

Hollyoaks’ previous form A rival to EastEnders for seasonal misery, the most 
eccentric soap of them all isn’t afraid to kill off favourites. RIP Ziggy, last 
year’s Christmas sacrifice.This year’s going The bodycount is already high, 
with Trevor, Jade, Nico and of course Lindsey among the casualties. What could 
possibly go right?

2/1: Max returns and seduces Kathy

EastEnders’ previous form There’s not a woman in Walford left untouched by the 
human baked bean of lust.

This year’s going Max is ripe for a return after being banged up for Lucy’s 
murder and will look to reap his revenge on Ian. What more delicious way than 
sleeping with Ian’s mum, who spent 2016 feasting on the aphrodisiac that is 
fishmonger Buster’s cockles?
