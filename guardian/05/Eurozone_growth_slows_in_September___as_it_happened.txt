US manufacturing growth slows

Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed in September according to 
Markit’s flash PMI.

The index slipped to 51.4 from 52 in August, where anything above 50 signals 
expansion.

Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit: 

Despite the growth setback in September, manufacturers appear reasonably 
upbeat about their longer-term prospects. Reflecting this, job creation 
rebounded since August and input buying continued to expand at a notably faster 
pace than seen during the first half of the year.

At the same time, overall cost inflation remained marginal and this provided 
some headroom to stimulate client spending through price discounting.

Record numbers visit UK in July as pound weakens

We have the first inkling that the sharp drop in the pound following the June 
Brexit vote is encouraging more overseas visitors.
 Bournemouth in July 
Some 3.8 million people visited Britain from other countries in July, the 
highest monthly total on record and 2% more than a year earlier according to 
the Office for National Statistics.

Visitors spent 2% more this July compared with a year earlier, at £1.79bn on a 
seasonally adjusted basis.

The pound’s sharp fall makes British goods and services cheaper for people 
visiting from other countries.

Meanwhile the figures also revealed British holidaymakers’ cut their spending 
overseas in July.

George Osborne: Jim O'Neill made a big difference

George Osborne has praised Jim O’Neill, the former chief economist of Goldman 
Sachs who resigned today as a Treasury minister.

O’Neill was part of the Treasury team when Osborne was chancellor.
George Osborne (@George_Osborne) 
Jim O'Neill was one of those rare things in British politics - an outside 
expert who made a big difference on the inside. He will be missed.

Wall Street is expected to open slightly lower following a three day rally. 

But US shares are likely to end the week higher, after the Fed’s decision to 
leave interest rates on hold boosted investor sentiment and drove shares higher 
on Thursday.

The Labour Party has responded to Mike Ashley’s appointment as chief executive 
of Sports Direct, the retailer he founded.

Jon Trickett MP, the shadow business secretary, is sceptical:

Swapping the deck chairs around is not the solution - it’s the underlying 
culture at Sports Direct that needs to be challenged and changed.

Whether Mike Ashley <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/mike-ashley> - who 
has presided over Sports Direct’s objectionable working practices for years - 
is the right man to bring about the change needed is questionable.

He will need to end the bullying culture at the company, get rid of zero-hours 
contracts, stop their over-reliance on agency workers and address the high 
levels of workplace injuries.

Jim O'Neill's resignation letter in full

This is what Jim O’Neill told Theresa May in his resignation letter:

 Dear Prime Minister,


I have decided to resign as a minister in the government.

This morning I returned from New York where I had the pleasure of witnessing 
the UN high level agreement on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is 
essentially the end goal of the Review that I was asked to lead ion the spring 
of 2014. This part of my role in government has come to its natural end, 
although of course, I was asked initially to lead the Review, independent of 
government.

Leading this Review has been one of the most stimulating roles I have ever 
undertaken and I am grateful to all those involved, especially my Review team, 
and all those across government that allowed the UK to take such a global 
leadership position in this key threat to the world. It goes without saying 
that our success is symbolic of the way that the UK can be influential in a 
post Brexit world.

I joined the government with the AMR Review already well developed in terms of 
our ideas and influence, but entered office believing its goals would be 
enhanced by being a Minister. I primarily joined however for the specific 
purpose of helping deliver the Northern Powerhouse and to help boost our 
economic ties with key growing economies around the world, especially China and 
India and other rapidly emerging economies.

The case for both to be at the heart of British economic policy is even 
stronger following the referendum, and I am pleased that, despite speculation 
to the contrary, both appear to be commanding your personal attention. I am 
leaving knowing that I can play some role supporting these critical initiatives 
as a non-governmental person.

I look forward to moving to the cross benches of the Lords, and wish you every 
success with the exciting challenges and opportunities ahead, and thank you for 
allowing me the privilege to serve in government.

Yours sincerely,

Jim O’Neill

Ed Cox, director of the thinktank, IPPR North, says it’s a shame O’Neill has 
quit the Treasury, but suggests the North will power on regardless...

It is a great shame that Jim O’Neill is standing down from this important role 
as he has been an important champion within government for the Northern 
Powerhouse.

 The Prime Minister has been very clear in her support for the Northern 
Powerhouse and IPPR North has always argued that the Northern Powerhouse is not 
so much a government programme as the sum total of economic activity that makes 
up our £300bn economy.

Ministers will come and go, but it is the businesses, innovators and investors

That’s all for this week. Thank you for joining us, and for all your comments. 
We’ll be back on Monday, have a great weekend.AM
 
Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed in September according to 
Markit’s flash PMI.

The index slipped to 51.4 from 52 in August, where anything above 50 signals 
expansion.

Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit: 

Despite the growth setback in September, manufacturers appear reasonably 
upbeat about their longer-term prospects. Reflecting this, job creation 
rebounded since August and input buying continued to expand at a notably faster 
pace than seen during the first half of the year.

At the same time, overall cost inflation remained marginal and this provided 
some headroom to stimulate client spending through price discounting.
 
The pound hit a five-week low against the dollar, falling more than 1% to 
$1.2938.

It is currently down 0.9% at $1.2951.
 
US markets are down in early trading:

 * Dow Jones: -0.1% at 18,374 
 * S&P 500: -0.2% at 2,172 
 * Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,328  
As Wall Street opens, here is the latest from European markets:

 * FTSE 100: -0.1% at 6,908 
 * Germany’s DAX: -0.4% at 10,634 
 * France’s CAC: -0.5% at 4,486 
 * Spain’s IBEX: -1.5% at 8,801 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB: -1.2% at 16,438 
 * Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 345  
We have the first inkling that the sharp drop in the pound following the June 
Brexit vote is encouraging more overseas visitors.
 Bournemouth in July 
Some 3.8 million people visited Britain from other countries in July, the 
highest monthly total on record and 2% more than a year earlier according to 
the Office for National Statistics.

Visitors spent 2% more this July compared with a year earlier, at £1.79bn on a 
seasonally adjusted basis.

The pound’s sharp fall makes British goods and services cheaper for people 
visiting from other countries.

Meanwhile the figures also revealed British holidaymakers’ cut their spending 
overseas in July.

George Osborne has praised Jim O’Neill, the former chief economist of Goldman 
Sachs who resigned today as a Treasury minister.

O’Neill was part of the Treasury team when Osborne was chancellor.

Wall Street is expected to open slightly lower following a three day rally. 

But US shares are likely to end the week higher, after the Fed’s decision to 
leave interest rates on hold boosted investor sentiment and drove shares higher 
on Thursday.

The Labour Party has responded to Mike Ashley’s appointment as chief executive 
of Sports Direct, the retailer he founded.

Jon Trickett MP, the shadow business secretary, is sceptical:

Swapping the deck chairs around is not the solution - it’s the underlying 
culture at Sports Direct that needs to be challenged and changed.

Whether Mike Ashley <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/mike-ashley> - who 
has presided over Sports Direct’s objectionable working practices for years - 
is the right man to bring about the change needed is questionable.

He will need to end the bullying culture at the company, get rid of zero-hours 
contracts, stop their over-reliance on agency workers and address the high 
levels of workplace injuries.
 
Oxford Economics is back on “recession watch” and say the chances of the UK 
economy sliding into another one are 25%, unchanged from last week.
 
Given his agreement with George Osborne about the importance of the northern 
powerhouse, it will be interesting to see whether he pops up atthe former 
chancellor’s new thinktank - the Northern Powerhouse Partnership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-to-chair-northern-powerhouse-partnership>
.
 
This is what Jim O’Neill told Theresa May in his resignation letter:

 Dear Prime Minister,


I have decided to resign as a minister in the government.

This morning I returned from New York where I had the pleasure of witnessing 
the UN high level agreement on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is 
essentially the end goal of the Review that I was asked to lead ion the spring 
of 2014. This part of my role in government has come to its natural end, 
although of course, I was asked initially to lead the Review, independent of 
government.

Leading this Review has been one of the most stimulating roles I have ever 
undertaken and I am grateful to all those involved, especially my Review team, 
and all those across government that allowed the UK to take such a global 
leadership position in this key threat to the world. It goes without saying 
that our success is symbolic of the way that the UK can be influential in a 
post Brexit world.

I joined the government with the AMR Review already well developed in terms of 
our ideas and influence, but entered office believing its goals would be 
enhanced by being a Minister. I primarily joined however for the specific 
purpose of helping deliver the Northern Powerhouse and to help boost our 
economic ties with key growing economies around the world, especially China and 
India and other rapidly emerging economies.

The case for both to be at the heart of British economic policy is even 
stronger following the referendum, and I am pleased that, despite speculation 
to the contrary, both appear to be commanding your personal attention. I am 
leaving knowing that I can play some role supporting these critical initiatives 
as a non-governmental person.

I look forward to moving to the cross benches of the Lords, and wish you every 
success with the exciting challenges and opportunities ahead, and thank you for 
allowing me the privilege to serve in government.

Yours sincerely,

Jim O’Neill
 
Ed Cox, director of the thinktank, IPPR North, says it’s a shame O’Neill has 
quit the Treasury, but suggests the North will power on regardless...

It is a great shame that Jim O’Neill is standing down from this important role 
as he has been an important champion within government for the Northern 
Powerhouse.

 The Prime Minister has been very clear in her support for the Northern 
Powerhouse and IPPR North has always argued that the Northern Powerhouse is not 
so much a government programme as the sum total of economic activity that makes 
up our £300bn economy.

Ministers will come and go, but it is the businesses, innovators and investors 
in the North that will ultimately unlock our economic potential.
