Sesame Street <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sesame-st> is about to 
look a lot different. The 45-year-old children’s show is losing three of its 
oldest cast members, triggering nostalgia and ire from longtime fans.

Earlier this month, actor Bob McGrath announced 
<http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/07/27/sesame-street-lets-go-longtime-cast-members-bob-gordon-and-luis/>
 at Florida Supercon, a comic convention, that he and cast members Emilio 
Delgado and Roscoe Orman were let go from the series as a result of its recent
move to HBO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/13/sesame-street-hbo-five-seasons>
. His comments surfaced onlineon Tuesday

.

“As of this season, I have completed my 45th season this year. And the show 
has gone under a major turnaround, going from an hour to a half-hour.HBO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/hbo> has gotten involved also. And they let 
all of the original cast members go, with the exception of Alan Muraoka – who 
is probably 20 years younger than the rest of us – and Chris Knowings, who is 
also young,” McGrath said, according to radio station KQED.

McGrath was one of Sesame Street’s few original cast members, playing Bob the 
music teacher since 1969. Delgado joined two years later as Luis, the owner of 
the Fix-It Shop. Orman became the third actor to play Gordon, a teacher and one 
of the original residents in the neighborhood, in 1974.

Last year, HBO announced it would take over five seasons of the show that 
could then be aired on PBS – where the show originated – after a nine-month 
period. Thecontroversial deal

 garneredmixed reactions

 but ultimately meant more content and allowed the show to stay on the air 
after struggles in funding. Episodesgrew shorter

 and focused on more modern topics geared at children raised with the internet.

Sesame Street <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sesame-st> released a 
statement on Twitter stating that HBO was not to blame for the changes. “As 
we’ve stated previously, Sesame Workshop retains sole creative control over the 
show. HBO does not oversee the production,” it read.

The statement said that McGrath, Delgado and Orman “remain a beloved part of 
the Sesame family”.

Fans of the long-running show expressed their disappointment online.


“My childhood is slowly dying over here,” one woman wrote 
<https://twitter.com/ElleMCo/status/758694194638524420>, echoing the sentiments 
of many.

Some made comments about age discrimination and gentrification pushing the 
older cast members out of the neighborhood.

“Sesame Street continues gentrifying, evicts its oldest residents,” said
