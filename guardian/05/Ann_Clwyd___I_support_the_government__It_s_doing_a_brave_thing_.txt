 Labour leftwinger Ann Clwyd, a long-standing supporter of Kurdish rights in 
northern Iraq, last night in the Commons recounted individual horror stories of 
the suffering inflicted on ethnic minorities by Saddam Hussein's regime.
Ms Clwyd told MPs: "I believe in regime change, and I say that without any 
hesitation at all, and I will support the government tonight because I think 
it's doing a brave thing."

Returning from Kurdistan this week, she said she had cried after hearing from 
victims of torture.

Ms Clwyd, MP for Cynon Valley, told of an under-nourished university teacher 
who had given birth in prison and begged guards for milk to feed her child. The 
guards refused and the baby died.

"For three days she held that baby in her arms and would not give the body up. 
After three days due to the 60-degree heat, the body of course started to 
smell, and [the woman] was taken away and killed."

She also told of a 15-year-old boy tortured and crucified, and pinned against 
the prison window. When he begged for water a prisoner who came to his aid was 
beaten up.

She found many refugees had been ethnically cleansed for being Kurds. 

"That's the reality of Saddam's Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>
," she said. "When I hear people calling for more time, I say, who is going to 
speak up for those victims? Who is to help the victims of Saddam's regime 
unless we do it?"

She said the regime should be indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity 
and genocide, and it was her great regret that Britain had not led the way to 
regime change in Iraq when it had the chance during the first Gulf war.
