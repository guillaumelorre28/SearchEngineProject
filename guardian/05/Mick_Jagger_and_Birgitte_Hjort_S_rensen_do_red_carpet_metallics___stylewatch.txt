Though it doesn’t begin until February, Vinyl looks a likely contender for 
style TV reference of the year, set in the grubby, sequinned, hairsprayed world 
of 1970s New York, a scene that fashion never tires of mining for inspiration 
(see:the resurgent Gucci

, Marc Jacobs’s now notorioussequins-compulsory party

 and the recent trend forBowie boots

Last night’s premiere was the cast and crew’s opportunity to lay down the 
style gauntlet. The winners were those who chose outfits that felt 70s 
rock’n’roll without glam rock tribute band connotations – namelySørensen 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birgitte_Hjort_S%C3%B8rensen> and Mick Jagger. 
The real deal rocker and Vinyl series producer wore a silver blazer with navy 
blue thesp and struck a modest, humanising hands-in-pockets pose – signifying a 
red carpet pro of the highest order.
