Savers desperate for a better return on their cash will be able to take out a 
new “market-leading” government-backed savings bond paying around 2.2%, the 
chancellor,Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/23/chancellor-spreads-giveaways-thinly-britains-jams-autumn-statement>
, has announced.

The government expects about 2 million people to snap up the bond, which will 
be offered by NationalSavings <https://www.theguardian.com/money/savings> & 
Investments from spring 2017 and will be for savers willing and able to tie up 
their money for three years.


The expected 2.2% interest rate is better than the top rate currently 
available on a three-year savings bond, which is 1.63% from Ikano Bank, and the 
new product will be available to anyone aged 16 or over. But some commentators 
were disappointed that the maximum investment will be £3,000. Someone investing 
the full amount could earn a total of just over £200 in interest after three 
years.

, founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com, said: “This new NS&I bond isn’t 
the chancellor’s rabbit out of a hat – it’s more of a mouse. Unlike its 
predecessor, thepensioner bond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/may/06/pensioner-bonds-nsi-warns-savers-to-apply-soon>
, which allowed people to save up to £10,000 at up to 4% for three years, this 
is £3,000 at a likely 2.2% ... Certainly any account that beats the paltry 
rates of interest that we have currently is to be welcomed, but I don’t see 
many people whooping.”
