1. Sheikh Salman

Bahrain; age 50. Odds: 8-15fav

Who is he? Bahraini royal, FA head and Asia’s football president. Enjoys wild 
boar hunting <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34556364> and denying 
wrongdoing. Says he’ll bring “moral, ethical” change to Fifa.

What are his chances? Backed by Asia and Africa, but held back by regular 
tough press in Europe – “nasty lies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/26/sheikh-salman-headed-committee-bahrain-protests>
” linking him to a 2011 crackdown on pro-democracy footballers. “It’s really 
hurtful. Some people have an agenda on their table.” This month he drew a line 
bysigning Amnesty’s human rights pledge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/12/sheikh-salman-signs-human-rights-pledge-fifa-russia-qatar-world-cups>
, after amending it to remove references to Russia, Qatar, women and LGBT 
groups. “We must not be selective when it concerns human rights.”

Will he bring change? He’s conservative. Last year he set out his view on 
Fifa’s corruption crisis with a speech addressed to “Dear Sepp… rest assured, 
the Asian football family stands firmly behind you.”In 2014 
<http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/sports/football/275106/2022-world-cup-in-good-hands-afc-chief>
 he called on the public not to take western press coverage of Qatar’s slave 
problem “too seriously… Most of it is artificial.”

His best policy? Streamlining next week’s vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/14/said-and-done-jerome-valcke-beyond-reproach>
, by suggesting that all his rivals drop out to avoid the distress that 
democracy can bring. “If we go to election there will be losers. Maybe 
sometimes you need to avoid that.”

They say: “There is credible evidence he aided and abetted crimes against 
humanity” –Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/20/sheikh-salman-fifa-presidency-human-rights>
.

He says: “I cannot deny something that I haven’t done … Integrity, respect and 
tolerance <https://twitter.com/richard_conway/status/700601245422264320?lang=en>
 are the heart of my campaign.”

2. Gianni Infantino

Switzerland; age 45. Odds: 6-4

 Gianni Infantino: genial. Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Who is he? Qualified lawyer, Uefa general secretary since 2009, genial 
ball-draw host <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0gu3R4svEI>.


What are his chances? Second favourite, by default. Infantino planned to drop 
out <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34776040> of the race when Michel 
Platini beat his corruption ban. Now he’s backed by leaders inConmebol 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-fifa-infantino-idUKKCN0V61Z5> and 
Europe,including Greg Dyke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/17/fa-backs-gianni-infantino-fifa-president-greg-dyke>
.

Will he bring change? Last month Infantino said he’d deliver a “now-or-never” 
change of ethos, then defended spending €500,000 of Uefa’s money onrenting a jet
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/gianni-infantino-fifa-sepp-blatter>
. “It is budgeted for, it is accounted for.” Among other lines from his
celebrity endorsement event at Wembley 
<http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2016/02/01/celeb-backed-infantino-offers-fifa-plan-of-finance-and-fudge-010202/>
: a refusal to rule out making Sepp Fifa’s honorary president (“I respect very 
much all the work he did”); a refusal to disclose his Uefa salary; a rejection 
of criticism of Uefa’s work on match-fixing; and a denial that he’d done a 
behind-closed-doors deal to be Sheikh Salman’s general secretary.

His best policies? He’s banking on some of Sepp’s stock election winners: more 
cash for member associations and an expanded World Cup. He denied using 
policies to buy votes. “I’m not buying anything. It’s not my money.”

They say: “His programme is smoke and mirrors” – rival Jérôme Champagne.

He says: “We have to change. We have to make a better way.”

3. Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein

Jordan; age 40. Odds: 12-1

 Prince Ali bin al-Hussein: crowd pleaser. Photograph: John Walton/PA 
Who is he? Sandhurst-trained ex-special forces; third son of Jordan’s late 
King Hussein; 43rd generation direct descendant of the prophet Muhammad;beaten 
133-73 by Sepp in May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/29/sepp-blatter-reelected-fifa-president-fifth-term>
.


What are his chances? Slim. He put voters off with talk of ending Fifa’s mob 
culture. “We want to get to a day when people don’t even know who the president 
ofFifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> is.”

Will he bring change? His manifesto ethos includes turning the pyramid of 
power “upside down” – radical from the brother of Jordan’s king. But some of 
his reflexes are more traditional, including this month criticisingthe 
suspension of funding to corruption-mired Concacaf and Conmebol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/11/fifa-five-presidential-candidates-miami-concacaf>
. His backers include Liberia’s Musa Bility, whofailed an ethics test last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/12/fifa-excludes-musa-bility-presidency>
.

His best policy? A crowd pleaser: upping grants 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-election-ali-factbox-idUSKCN0VS0JB>
 from $250k a year to $1m.

They say: “He was a good candidate. But I am president now. I am the president 
of everybody” –Sepp, after beating him in May 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c327nJOrJF4>.

He says: “I can guarantee you, I am the right person for this job.”

 Tokyo Sexwale: owns an island. Photograph: Jeff Mitchell/Getty Images 
Who is he? Multimillionaire mining tycoon, long-time Fifa insider, ex-host of 
South Africa’sThe Apprentice <https://youtu.be/EPjJe2TK4pI?t=10s>, former 
apartheid-era political prisoner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/24/tokyo-sexwale-candidate-fifa-president>
, and owner of a£45m tropical island 
<http://www.financialmail.co.za/life/travel/2015/10/01/tokyo-sexwale-s-private-island>
 in the Indian Ocean.

What are his chances? Not even his own confederation, Caf 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35502955>, is backing him. Sexwale (
seh-wa-le) has taken heavy criticism for a “low energy” campaign, bad spelling 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34868723>, and for being over-eager to 
dovoting deals with rivals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/28/fifa-president-candidate-tokyo-sexwale-alliances>
 – a process he called “healthy, democratic and good”. Last month he denied 
French media allegations that he made$210m in kickbacks 
<http://www.insideworldfootball.com/fifa/18874-sexwale-denies-french-mining-kickback-claims-and-stays-in-the-fifa-race>
 during a mining deal in 2007. His lawyer called the claims “absolutely 
execrable”.

Will he bring change? No.

His best policy? Spotting an untapped revenue stream to appeal to voting 
members: selling advertising on national shirts. “That is my strategic 
priority.”

They say: “Even I’m more competent than Sexwale” – Ghana FA head Kwesi 
Nyantakyi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/24/said-and-done-maurizio-sarri-chelsea-snake-sunderland>
.

He says: “Sepp Blatter’s work is a monument. A mountain that cannot be moved.”

 Jérôme Champagne: Pelé’s choice. Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters 
Who is he? Former French diplomat, Fifa executive from 1999 to 2010, and 
Blatter’s 2002 election campaign manager.

What are his chances? Rank outsider, thanks in part to credible policies.

Will he bring change? A fierce streak of Fifa loyalty has undermined his 
reforming agenda, but may have made his candidacy more palatable to Congress. 
Among his recent reassuring lines: telling delegates at Concacaf, whose last 
three presidents have all been arrested: “The media treats your region unfairly 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-fifa-concacaf-idUKKCN0VL0GL>”; 
revealing that Fifa is “falsely accused of all evils in world football 
<http://www.jeromechampagne2015.com/programme.html>”, and explaining why Fifa 
cannot be run by an outsider 
<http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/12/12/champagne-believes-blatter-will-be-better-judged-history>
: “We can’t afford to have someone coming from Mars or Venus spending two years 
to understand the subtleties, the idiosyncrasies and all the complexities.”

His best policy? See above.

They say: “I support Jérôme. I know his vision for change” – Pelé 
<http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/578338_pele-declara-apoio-a-champagne-na-eleicao-da-fifa-vai-lutar-pela-democracia-no-futebol>
.

He says: “History will judge Sepp kindly.”
