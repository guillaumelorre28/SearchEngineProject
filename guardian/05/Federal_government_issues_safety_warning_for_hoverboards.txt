The federal government has issued a safety warning for hoverboards and may 
consider laws to regulate them, the minister for small business, Kelly O’Dwyer, 
has said.

The motorised gadgets were popular Christmas presents but a faulty battery in 
one brand was blamed forsparking a house fire in Melbourne

 last week, which caused extensive damage but left the family unharmed.

O’Dwyer urged consumers to carefully check if their product or charger had 
been recalled.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is assessing whether the 
gadgets are potentially dangerous.

“The ACCC investigation will assess whether the hoverboards will or may cause 
injury to consumers and whether any regulatory action may be required,” O’Dwyer 
said.

State and territory electrical safety regulators are investigating if the 
chargers supplied with hoverboards meet Australian standards.

Large numbers of the gadgets have been recalled in the UK

 and they have been associated withfires and explosions

 in various countries.

Victor Dominello, the New South Wales innovation minister, issued a warning 
about the same time as the house fire. “They have become a popular product in 
recent times but you should never leave a child alone when they are using them 
and never leave a hoverboard charging unattended,” he said.

It is illegal to ride a hoverboard on a road or path in NSW, the Northern 
Territory, Queensland and Tasmania, the consumer group Choice has said.

David Leyonhjelm, the Liberal Democrat senator who chaired parliament’s 
inquiry into nanny state legislation, said the rules were ridiculous.

“[NSW premier Mike] Baird would have grown up at a time when we were allowed 
to rollerskate or ride skateboards anywhere we wanted,” he said. “People did 
not need rules then to tell them what to do because we know what is best for 
their own safety – and we don’t need these rules now.

“I challenge governments at all levels to step back and identify their 
silliest laws, and then remove them.”
