In a nutshell


Even if militaria doesn’t get your engine revving, this attraction is well 
worth a visit, with its vast collection of vehicles in six well-organised 
halls. They tell the story of armoured warfare from the first world war and the 
first tank, Little Willie, to the present day, broken up by a number of 
tank-related activities to ease exhibit fatigue.

Fun fact


Tanks hit the spotlight – and central London – last month as 15 September 
marked the centenary of the first one rumbling into action at the Somme.

Best thing about it


The museum has made a potentially dull subject really engaging, with loads of 
extra stuff to appeal to kids (and big kids), including interactive exhibits, 
people making models, games, toys, crafts, dressing up and – best of all – 
rides in a real tracked vehicle (these cost an extra £3.50pp). There are also 
regular outdoor displays of tanks in action, firing ammunition before a 
delighted/terrified audience.

What about lunch?


There’s a restaurant serving snacks, cakes and hot meals at one end of the 
museum, and a cafe at the other, next to the indoor play area. Prices are 
reasonable: hot meals start from £3.15 for kids and £6.25 for adults, and 
sandwiches cost from £3.

Exit through the gift shop? 


No, but it is right next to the entrance.

Value for money?


Yes – we spent most of the day there and still hadn’t seen or done everything. 
Adult £13, child (5-16) £7.50, family (2 adults, 2 children) £35 or (1 adult, 3 
children) £29.

Getting there


A car is the best option – it’s a taxi ride from the nearest train station, at 
Wool.
