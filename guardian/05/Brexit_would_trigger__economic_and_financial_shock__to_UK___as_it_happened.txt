European markets close lower as oil slides again

Another drop in the crude price after news of record production from Iraq in 
December has helped get the week off to a downbeat start.Stock markets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> have ended lower, albeit 
not with any of the dramatic moves seen in the past few days. Tony Cross at 
Trustnet Direct said:

With oil prices lower, it’s perhaps no surprise that equity markets have 
followed this lead although it is certainly worth noting that today’s sell-off 
[on the FTSE 100] does look remarkably measured...Panic could well have 
enveloped the market given the downturn we saw for crude just before European 
bourses opened for the week, so this is certainly something that’s notable. 
It’s also worth pointing out that despite this weakness in crude, the natural 
resources stocks haven’t been left propping up the index, with that title 
instead going to the banks. A downgrade for Lloyds plus concerns over an even 
more onerous regulatory system appear to be rocking sentiment here.

Brent crude is currently 4.6% lower at $30.70 a barrel, while a disappointing 
manufacturing survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve has also dented sentiment 
ahead of the latest Fed meeting this week. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 23.01 points or 0.39% at 5877.00 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.29% to 9736.15 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.58% at 4311.33 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB dropped 2.03% to 18,641.47 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 8367.7 
 * In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.07% to 534.72 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 75 points or nearly 
0.5%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

No UK rate rise any time soon - BoE policymaker

Katie Allen

The outlook for UK inflation does not warrant an interest rate rise any time 
soon, according to Kristin Forbes, one of the Bank of England’s nine 
policy-setters,writes Katie Allen.
Bank of England (@bankofengland) 
A tale of two labour markets: the UK and US - speech by Kristin Forbes 
https://t.co/Sh0EwjxuYa <https://t.co/Sh0EwjxuYa>
 <https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/691652080554135552> January 25, 2016
 <https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/691652080554135552> 
US economist Forbes has released a speech on the UK labour market in which she 
highlights a mixed picture: a low unemployment rate but slow pay growth. That 
echoes the tone of the minutes from the Bank’s latest policy meeting when the 
monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 8-1 toleave interest rates at their 
record low of 0.5% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-hold-mpc>
. Only Ian McCafferty voted for a rate rise.

Forbes says the UK labour market appears to be almost back to normal but that 
the drop in global oil prices has given the MPC a bit more time to judge if the 
tighter labour market would boost wages and help inflation return to the Bank’s 
2% target from 0.2% now.

Her message seems to be that labour costs are slowly building but they are not 
yet at a level where policymakers can be confident UK inflation will hit 2%.

Here are key quotes from Forbes speech, entitled “A tale of two labour 
markets: the UK and US”, released today but to be delivered tomorrow to the 
Henry Jackson Society in parliament:

 * “With slow wage growth, inflation currently at 0.2%, and downward price 
pressure from cheaper energy and sterling’s past appreciation, there appears to 
be little risk of inflation suddenly spiking to well above our 2% target in a 
way that would require increasing interest rates soon.”

 * “A close look at the UK and US labour markets suggest that they are 
stronger and tighter than the most popular headline wage figures suggest. After 
a severe crisis and prolonged recovery, they have largely returned to normality.

 * “In the UK, however, wages and labour costs have not yet gained enough 
momentum to be consistent with inflation reaching our 2% target. Tightening 
monetary policy today would require faith that our forecasting models will work 
and the tightness in labour market quantities and measures of labour market 
churn will soon translate into stronger wages and then higher inflation. But, 
unfortunately, these models have not been working very well recently. 
Therefore, although I still have faith, I would like to see a bit more upward 
movement in these wage and cost measures to build confidence that the normal 
chain of tight labour markets feeding through into higher wages is still 
intact. In other words: trust, but verify. The most recent falls in oil prices, 
by delaying the recovery in inflation, provide the luxury of a bit more time to 
build this confidence.”

Is the gloom about a slowdown in China overdone? Julian Jessop at Capital 
Economics thinks so:

According to the official GDP data, China’s growth was 6.9% in 2015, which 
would be the slowest since 1990. Our own China Activity Proxy (CAP) suggests 
that the true growth rate has been much weaker, perhaps as low as 4.3% in 2015. 
However, while sluggish by China’s recent standards, even 4.3% would still be a 
respectable pace of growth anywhere else. Our CAP also suggests that the worst 
of China’s slowdown is now in the past.

Indeed much of the recent gloomy commentary about the impact of slower growth 
in China on the rest of the world misses a number of other key points. First, 
it was never likely that China could maintain double-digit growth as incomes 
caught up with those in West. Some slowdown was both inevitable as the economy 
matured, and desirable as part of rebalancing away from over-investment towards 
consumption.

Second, China’s slowdown is nothing new. Growth peaked in 2007 and had been on 
a clear downward trend since 2011. Crucially, this has not prevented advanced 
economies from picking up, or global growth from stabilising.

Third, the much larger size of China’s economy means that even much slower 
rates of growth can deliver big increases in demand from year to year and 
maintain a high contribution to global growth. Indeed, on the official data at 
least, the increase in China’s GDP in 2015 was practically the same as in 2007, 
even though the annual growth rate had more than halved. (The differences would 
be larger using our CAP estimates, but the essential point still stands.)

To be clear, there are valid concerns over the medium-term outlook for China, 
including high and rising levels of debt and the damage to credibility caused 
by botched interference in the equity market and by the poor communication of 
changes in currency policy. But despite some genuine risks, China’s economy is 
not collapsing. Nor is there much to justify fears that the turmoil in China’s 
equity or currency markets will cause major problems in the rest of the world.

New US manufacturing survey shows slump

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its December meeting on the basis 
the US economy was strong enough to cope.

But a Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey 
<http://www.dallasfed.org/microsites/research/surveys/tmos/index.cfm> tells a 
different tale, with the business activity index coming in at -34.6 compared to 
-21.6 in November and a forecast of just -14. This marks a six year low, with 
companies hit by the strength of the dollar. The Dallas Fed said:

Texas factory activity fell sharply in January, according to business 
executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. The production 
index—a key measure of state manufacturing conditions—dropped 23 points, from 
12.7 to -10.2, suggesting output declined this month after growing throughout 
fourth quarter 2015.

The Federal Reserve meets again this week to unveil its latest rate decisions 
although there is no press conference. One Dallas Fed respondent said:

I expect the Fed to recognise the weakness in the economy and the fact that we 
are in recession and drop interest rates again.

That is unlikely to happen but there is a growing feeling the rate rise in 
December could have been premature.

Oil prices continue to slide, losing much of the gains made during Friday’s 
rally.

As we said earlier, there are several reasons for the decline, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/25/stock-markets-stimulus-hopes-ftse-oil-live#block-56a5dddfe4b0f14243724b16>
 including Iraq’s production hitting a record in December and oil giant Saudi 
Aramco saying it won’t cut investment in new production.

In a speech in London Abdalla el-Badri, secretary general of Opec, said both 
members and non-members of the oil producing group (like Russia) should tackle 
the problem of oversupply together. He put some of the blame for the glut of 
crude on smaller oil-producing countries. He said:

It is vital the market addresses the issue of the stock overhang. As you can 
see from previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling then prices start 
to rise.

Given how this developed, it should be viewed as something Opec and non-Opec 
tackle together.

Yes, Opec provided some of the additional supply last year, but the majority 
of this has come from non-Opec countries.

It is crucial that all major producers sit down to come up with a solution to 
this.

At the moment Brent crude is down nearly 4% at $31 a barrel.

Greek economy contracted 0.2% in 2015 - central bank

Greece’s economy is expected to have contracted by 0.2% last year, according 
to Bank ofGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> governor Yannis 
Stournaras.

The country is likely to stay in recession in the first half of 2016, he said 
in a speech to Hellenic American Chamber of Commerce, but it could rebound over 
the course of the year.

He called for the first review of its economic reforms by creditors to be 
completed quickly, saying a failure to do so would be destabilising.

Unilever’s boss Paul Polman - who earlier said the company would not scale 
back its UK operations if Britain voted to leave the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/24/unilever-says-uk-jobs-wont-suffer-after-brexit>
 - has hit out against a possible sugar tax. Graham Ruddick reports:

The boss of Unilever <https://www.theguardian.com/business/unilever>, one of 
the world’s biggest food manufacturers, has warned that a sugar tax will not 
solve Britain’s obesity crisis and urged the government not to introduce one.

Amid a growing clamour from politicians and campaign groups for a sugar tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/22/leading-health-groups-call-for-20-tax-on-sugary-drinks>
, Paul Polman said there was little evidence that introducing a levy on food 
and drink with a high sugar content would help tackle obesity.

Unilever <https://www.theguardian.com/business/unilever> makes some of 
Britain’s most popular snacks, including Magnum, Ben & Jerry’s, and Cornetto 
ice-creams.

A referendum could be held in June this year, provided prime minister David 
Cameron reaches a deal at next month’s EU summit, reckon Credit Suisse:

Ministers have calculated that roughly four months are required between the 
announcement of the referendum and the referendum. Our base-case scenario is 
for the referendum to be held in June 2016, but any delays in the renegotiation 
could push it out further.

The final outcome of the renegotiation and the deal that Prime Minister 
Cameron manages to secure is important, in our view, for the result of the 
referendum. Opinion polls so far show a lead for the remain campaign with 45% 
voting to remain in the EU versus 39% voting to leave, if we take an average of 
the opinion polls in December 2015. The lead of the remain campaign has 
narrowed though across all polling companies, with a few polls even showing the 
leave campaign in the lead. The share of don’t knows is still quite 
significant, i.e., on an average 15% of the voters are undecided. Since the 
lead of the remain campaign is narrow, the undecided voters will be key for the 
outcome of the referendum.

But the bank adds (wisely):

It is also important to be cautious while interpreting these opinion polls, 
given that in past events such as the UK 2015 general election they were not 
completely reliable. They are also likely to move once the deal with the EU is 
finalized as we discussed above.

CS: Brexit could be boost for Corbyn

Brexit would also have long-term implications for the UK’s political 
landscape, Credit Suisse points outin their new report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/25/stock-markets-stimulus-hopes-ftse-oil-live#block-56a616cae4b0f4b9efc8d58d>
.


For example, what if Scotland largely votes to stay in and seizes on the 
overall exit decision as a reason to hold another referendum? Or what if Brexit 
creates a recession painful enough to allow the opposition Labour Party under 
supposed ‘radical’ Jeremy Corbyn to benefit from a surge in opinion polls?

This could mean that investors are less willing to hold UK assets. including 
government debt and shares in British companies.

CS say:

A significant risk for the UK would be selling by foreign holders of UK assets.

Another drop in the crude price after news of record production from Iraq in 
December has helped get the week off to a downbeat start.Stock markets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> have ended lower, albeit 
not with any of the dramatic moves seen in the past few days. Tony Cross at 
Trustnet Direct said:

With oil prices lower, it’s perhaps no surprise that equity markets have 
followed this lead although it is certainly worth noting that today’s sell-off 
[on the FTSE 100] does look remarkably measured...Panic could well have 
enveloped the market given the downturn we saw for crude just before European 
bourses opened for the week, so this is certainly something that’s notable. 
It’s also worth pointing out that despite this weakness in crude, the natural 
resources stocks haven’t been left propping up the index, with that title 
instead going to the banks. A downgrade for Lloyds plus concerns over an even 
more onerous regulatory system appear to be rocking sentiment here.

Brent crude is currently 4.6% lower at $30.70 a barrel, while a disappointing 
manufacturing survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve has also dented sentiment 
ahead of the latest Fed meeting this week. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 23.01 points or 0.39% at 5877.00 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.29% to 9736.15 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.58% at 4311.33 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB dropped 2.03% to 18,641.47 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 8367.7 
 * In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.07% to 534.72 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 75 points or nearly 
0.5%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

The outlook for UK inflation does not warrant an interest rate rise any time 
soon, according to Kristin Forbes, one of the Bank of England’s nine 
policy-setters,writes Katie Allen.
Bank of England (@bankofengland) 
A tale of two labour markets: the UK and US - speech by Kristin Forbes 
https://t.co/Sh0EwjxuYa <https://t.co/Sh0EwjxuYa>
 <https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/691652080554135552> January 25, 2016
 <https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/691652080554135552> 
US economist Forbes has released a speech on the UK labour market in which she 
highlights a mixed picture: a low unemployment rate but slow pay growth. That 
echoes the tone of the minutes from the Bank’s latest policy meeting when the 
monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 8-1 toleave interest rates at their 
record low of 0.5% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-hold-mpc>
. Only Ian McCafferty voted for a rate rise.

Forbes says the UK labour market appears to be almost back to normal but that 
the drop in global oil prices has given the MPC a bit more time to judge if the 
tighter labour market would boost wages and help inflation return to the Bank’s 
2% target from 0.2% now.

Her message seems to be that labour costs are slowly building but they are not 
yet at a level where policymakers can be confident UK inflation will hit 2%.

Here are key quotes from Forbes speech, entitled “A tale of two labour 
markets: the UK and US”, released today but to be delivered tomorrow to the 
Henry Jackson Society in parliament:

 * “With slow wage growth, inflation currently at 0.2%, and downward price 
pressure from cheaper energy and sterling’s past appreciation, there appears to 
be little risk of inflation suddenly spiking to well above our 2% target in a 
way that would require increasing interest rates soon.”

 * “A close look at the UK and US labour markets suggest that they are 
stronger and tighter than the most popular headline wage figures suggest. After 
a severe crisis and prolonged recovery, they have largely returned to normality.

 * “In the UK, however, wages and labour costs have not yet gained enough 
momentum to be consistent with inflation reaching our 2% target. Tightening 
monetary policy today would require faith that our forecasting models will work 
and the tightness in labour market quantities and measures of labour market 
churn will soon translate into stronger wages and then higher inflation. But, 
unfortunately, these models have not been working very well recently. 
Therefore, although I still have faith, I would like to see a bit more upward 
movement in these wage and cost measures to build confidence that the normal 
chain of tight labour markets feeding through into higher wages is still 
intact. In other words: trust, but verify. The most recent falls in oil prices, 
by delaying the recovery in inflation, provide the luxury of a bit more time to 
build this confidence.”
 
Is the gloom about a slowdown in China overdone? Julian Jessop at Capital 
Economics thinks so:

According to the official GDP data, China’s growth was 6.9% in 2015, which 
would be the slowest since 1990. Our own China Activity Proxy (CAP) suggests 
that the true growth rate has been much weaker, perhaps as low as 4.3% in 2015. 
However, while sluggish by China’s recent standards, even 4.3% would still be a 
respectable pace of growth anywhere else. Our CAP also suggests that the worst 
of China’s slowdown is now in the past.

Indeed much of the recent gloomy commentary about the impact of slower growth 
in China on the rest of the world misses a number of other key points. First, 
it was never likely that China could maintain double-digit growth as incomes 
caught up with those in West. Some slowdown was both inevitable as the economy 
matured, and desirable as part of rebalancing away from over-investment towards 
consumption.

Second, China’s slowdown is nothing new. Growth peaked in 2007 and had been on 
a clear downward trend since 2011. Crucially, this has not prevented advanced 
economies from picking up, or global growth from stabilising.

Third, the much larger size of China’s economy means that even much slower 
rates of growth can deliver big increases in demand from year to year and 
maintain a high contribution to global growth. Indeed, on the official data at 
least, the increase in China’s GDP in 2015 was practically the same as in 2007, 
even though the annual growth rate had more than halved. (The differences would 
be larger using our CAP estimates, but the essential point still stands.)

To be clear, there are valid concerns over the medium-term outlook for China, 
including high and rising levels of debt and the damage to credibility caused 
by botched interference in the equity market and by the poor communication of 
changes in currency policy. But despite some genuine risks, China’s economy is 
not collapsing. Nor is there much to justify fears that the turmoil in China’s 
equity or currency markets will cause major problems in the rest of the world.
 
And on the Dallas Fed survey:

If you're surprised that manufacturing surveys from oil/gas country are

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its December meeting on the basis 
the US economy was strong enough to cope.

But a Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey 
<http://www.dallasfed.org/microsites/research/surveys/tmos/index.cfm> tells a 
different tale, with the business activity index coming in at -34.6 compared to 
-21.6 in November and a forecast of just -14. This marks a six year low, with 
companies hit by the strength of the dollar. The Dallas Fed said:

Texas factory activity fell sharply in January, according to business 
executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. The production 
index—a key measure of state manufacturing conditions—dropped 23 points, from 
12.7 to -10.2, suggesting output declined this month after growing throughout 
fourth quarter 2015.

The Federal Reserve meets again this week to unveil its latest rate decisions 
although there is no press conference. One Dallas Fed respondent said:

I expect the Fed to recognise the weakness in the economy and the fact that we 
are in recession and drop interest rates again.

That is unlikely to happen but there is a growing feeling the rate rise in 
December could have been premature.

The drop in oil prices has led to an initial fall in the US markets which, 
despite the storms hitting the east coast, have opened on time.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 66 points or 0.44% lower, while the S&P 
500 has slipped 0.2% and Nasdaq is down 0.3%.
 
Oil prices continue to slide, losing much of the gains made during Friday’s 
rally.

As we said earlier, there are several reasons for the decline, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/25/stock-markets-stimulus-hopes-ftse-oil-live#block-56a5dddfe4b0f14243724b16>
 including Iraq’s production hitting a record in December and oil giant Saudi 
Aramco saying it won’t cut investment in new production.

In a speech in London Abdalla el-Badri, secretary general of Opec, said both 
members and non-members of the oil producing group (like Russia) should tackle 
the problem of oversupply together. He put some of the blame for the glut of 
crude on smaller oil-producing countries. He said:

It is vital the market addresses the issue of the stock overhang. As you can 
see from previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling then prices start 
to rise.

Given how this developed, it should be viewed as something Opec and non-Opec 
tackle together.

Yes, Opec provided some of the additional supply last year, but the majority 
of this has come from non-Opec countries.

It is crucial that all major producers sit down to come up with a solution to 
this.

Greece’s economy is expected to have contracted by 0.2% last year, according 
to Bank ofGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> governor Yannis 
Stournaras.

The country is likely to stay in recession in the first half of 2016, he said 
in a speech to Hellenic American Chamber of Commerce, but it could rebound over 
the course of the year.

He called for the first review of its economic reforms by creditors to be 
completed quickly, saying a failure to do so would be destabilising.

Amid a growing clamour from politicians and campaign groups for a sugar tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/22/leading-health-groups-call-for-20-tax-on-sugary-drinks>
