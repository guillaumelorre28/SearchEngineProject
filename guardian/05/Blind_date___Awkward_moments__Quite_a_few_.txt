Emma on Jack 


What were you hoping for?
Not to want to do a runner after the first course.

First impressions?
He was already there. I am a stickler for being on time.

What did you talk about?
Crime-fighting, suitable restaurant chairs and our lack of wine knowledge.

Any awkward moments?
Quite a few. He insulted working in recruitment after I told him my best 
friend did, and he told me he went to a posh school, five minutes in.

Good table manners?
He didn’t say thank you to the waiter much – a deal-breaker.

Best thing about Jack?
He gave me some good advice on the best places to eat in London.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
Probably not.

Describe Jack in three words.
Not my type.

What do you think he made of you?
He probably thought I was a lunatic.

Did you go on somewhere?
We parted ways at the restaurant door.

And... did you kiss?
No.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
A date I’d want to see again.

Marks out of 10?
5.

Would you meet again?
Unlikely.

Jack on Emma

First impressions?
Easy-going and relaxed.

What did you talk about?
Work, family, eating steak rare, and why cocktails should be served out of 
coconuts.

A few extended silences.

Good table manners?
Apart from a butter-knife mishap, very good.

Best thing about Emma?
Well-travelled and career-driven, which is respectable.

No kissing, I’m afraid.
