Donaldson – a former close associate of the Sinn Féin’s president, Gerry Adams 
– was killed by a shotgun blast as he answered the door to his cottage near 
Glenties, Co Donegal, in April 2006.


Before being exposed as a British spy, Donaldson was a prominent figure in 
Sinn Féin and eventually became head of the party’s administrative team in the 
Stormont parliament in Belfast.

The inquest into his death has been delayed at least 19 times, with his family 
taking legal action against the authorities in Ireland over the delays.

There have been allegations that a journal belonging to Donaldson was found in 
his cottage and, owing to its politically sensitive contents, the Irish police 
have consistently applied for postponements of the inquest.
