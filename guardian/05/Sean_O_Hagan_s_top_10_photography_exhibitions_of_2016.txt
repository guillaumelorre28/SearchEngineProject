1 Paul Strand: Photography and Film for the 20th Century

Victoria and Albert Museum, London

British galleries have been moving away from the idea of exhibitions devoted 
to a single photographer, in favour of elaborate themed shows. As a result, 
several important shows that have travelled from the US to Europe (such as 
Garry Winogrand and Robert Adams in Paris, and William Gedney in Madrid) have 
not reached the UK.

In March, however, the V&A unveiled this intriguingly titled show, a wonderful 
retrospective of an American master. It was a thoughtful, questioning journey 
into Strand’s work, from his early landscapes of New Mexico to his modernist 
New York studies of the 1930s and his later, more political documentary 
projects.


Strand was a taciturn individual, and approached each undertaking, whether the 
concrete canyons of 1930s Wall Street or peasant life in 1950s rural Italy, 
with deep attentiveness and a quiet intensity. His vintage prints, particularly 
those made in Luzzara and the Outer Hebrides, carry a charge that demands 
similar engagement from the viewer. They have a presence that renders them art 
objects rather than simply prints on a wall.


The show moved through his long working life, paying attention to his radical 
film-making and the politics that underpinned and fuelled much of his work. 
Ultimately, though, it was a homage to a still relatively undervalued artist. 
In some ways, then, this was an old-fashioned show in an age of curatorial 
grandstanding – but all the more powerful and rewarding for that.Read more

Provoke magazine published just three issues at the end of the 1960s, but the 
influence of the iconoclastic artistic movement that produced it was later 
likened to “a time bomb” by the Japanese photographerNobuyoshi Araki 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/araki>. Le Bal’s show recreated the 
raw energy of that seismic moment: the political and social ferment of the time 
echoed through every work, in the use of grain and blur and constant movement. 
A vibrant show that evoked a still resonating moment in postwar Japanese 
photography.

A small but important exhibition for a rising star of American 
post-documentary, whose vivid images of Los Angeles and its environs sit 
somewhere between heightened – almost hallucinatory – observation and 
portraiture, capturing the sense of anxiety that haunts certain David Lynch 
films. Part ofa five-year-long project, ZZYZX 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/15/gregory-halpern-zzyzx-photography-book-california-los-angeles>
, the photographs trace Halpern’s journey west across the deserts of California 
towards the city and the coast. The result is a California of the mind.

A timely show, ending in January, that harks back to an era of true radicalism 
in the arts. Gathering still-resonant works by Martha Rosler, Cindy Sherman and 
Francesca Woodman, as well as the brilliantly disturbing Birgit Jürgenssen, and 
merging photography, performance, film and collage, this show isprovocative 
from start to finish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/07/weddings-ovens-jesus-in-heels-savage-wit-avant-garde-feminist-photography>
. At a time when protest has been all but replaced by process in an art world 
mesmerised by the market, this may have you wondering about the startling 
complacency of today’s so-called avant garde.Open until 29 January.

 Photograph: Eamonn Doyle 
The most-talked about show at the Arles photography festival was this 
radically staged installation, which presented Doyle’s vivid Dublin street 
portraits in a maze-like room complete with abstract drawings and a suitably 
ambient electronic soundtrack. Some images towered above the viewer, taking up 
a whole wall. Others were arranged in grids, others still glimpsed in cracks 
and gaps in the walls. The effect was overwhelming, with the tilted angles and 
skewed points of view evoking and heightening the ebb and flow of his native 
north Dublin. Beckett is an abiding influence, but this seemed altogether 
Joycean in its intimacy and intensity.

Billed as “a once in a lifetime chance to see one of the world’s greatest 
private collections of photography”,this still-running show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/08/the-radical-eye-review-tate-modern-switch-house>
 is exactly that: more than 150 vintage prints by the likes of Man Ray, 
Brassaï, Rodchenko and Kertész. Elton, though, has an eye for the overlooked as 
well as the classic. The highlight for me was the wealth of beautiful prints by 
such lesser-known artists as George Platt Lynes, Rudolf Koppitz and Ilse Bing. 
Another surprise is the framing, which forgoes the usual black for gold and 
silver. Very Elton.Open until 6 May.

This revealing show tracked the early years of one of the most controversial 
photographers of the 20th century, before she began producing the often 
disturbing images that made her name. Just over 100 photographs, presented on 
pillars and in near darkness, traced her emerging style, from a beautifully 
grainy image of a newspaper floating on a New York street, to arresting 
portraits made in Times Square and Coney Island that show her beginning to 
break with the idea of detached observation.
