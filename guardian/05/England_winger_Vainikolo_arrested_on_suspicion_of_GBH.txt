Vainikolo has been arrested after allegedly leaving a man with head injuries 
from a street fight outside a nightclub in Bath in the early hours of Sunday 
morning.

The 29-year-old was questioned by police and held on suspicion of causing 
grievous bodily harm. Though Vainikolo was arrested he was not charged and has 
since been released on bail. "We are aware of an incident at which Lesley 
Vainikolo was present on Saturday night. We understand the police investigation 
is ongoing and have no comment to make at this stage," said aGloucester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gloucesterrugby> spokesman.

Police confirmed that they had been called to an incident in Bath at 2am on 
Sunday morning. "We were called to reports of an assault in Pierrepont Street, 
Bath," said a spokesman. "A man in his twenties was taken to hospital with 
injuries thought to be critical. Subsequently it was found they were not as 
serious as first thought and he was discharged. A man in his twenties has been 
arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and has now been released 
on police bail."

Police say there was "nothing to suggest" the victim of the attack was another 
rugby player.

Vainikolo, who has won five caps for England, scored two tries on Saturday 
afternoon as Gloucester beat Newport Gwent Dragons 25-20 in theAnglo-Welsh Cup
