I’m off into the comments now once I have massaged my aching hands. But thank 
you for coming, once again, and keeping me company in what feels like a 
simultaneously pointless and completely vital service.

If we didn’t afford a stupid reality show this much attention, we might have 
to think about actual reality and that would be bloody awful.

Keep it virtual, friends. Until next week, same day, same time. And I’d advise 
you to have a giin handy.

Next week: well there was a white board with GIIN written on it. This is what 
Karrren would call her own brand of gin. I can’t wait to see how they ruin gin.

Jess confidently predicts that Dillon will be back at the house.

Even when he doesn’t come back, she doesn’t seem to accept it. Grainne 
impresses on the rest of the house, how real this shit just got.

No! She goes back to the house instead. THEN she probably visits the 
conveniences. So a double firing tonight - Dillon and Sofiane are off in 
separate taxis like a couple in First Dates who’d rather not go for that drink 
after the meal.

Alan can’t deal with folk who have no regard for others, he tells Sofiane. 
Grainne says she’s won three tasks which isn’t none. Dillon tries to re-design 
the stupid game after the fact as Alan’s brow darkens and he gets.....the 
finger.

Dillon is gone. No, not Dillon. I’d only just really noticed his eyebrows.

Dillon gives an impassioned speech a bit like the one Madonna does about 
turning up in New York with $37 to her name and a desire to make it in the big 
city. He is so like Madonna. For a moment there, he is in the spotlight but it 
is quickly snuffed out by Sofiane.

The other two want Sofiane to go. Sofiane wants “definitely not me” to go. 
Hmmmm.

I really don’t want Grainne to go. Which probably means she’s gone.

Alana goes back to the house, little believing that she doesn’t have to have a 
full on verbal slap-fight with the others for her place on the show. I’m 
surprised too.

Alan and his familiars have a quick conflab and they three marked ones are 
back in the room. Dillon’s face is all defiance and steel. The other two less 
so.

Sofiane gets a tongue-lashing for going off-script during the pitch. Dillon 
says he stepped back because he didn’t want to talk over the others and look 
unprofessional, which Al and co would 100% have told him off for.

I’m off into the comments now once I have massaged my aching hands. But thank 
you for coming, once again, and keeping me company in what feels like a 
simultaneously pointless and completely vital service.

If we didn’t afford a stupid reality show this much attention, we might have 
to think about actual reality and that would be bloody awful.

Keep it virtual, friends. Until next week, same day, same time. And I’d advise 
you to have a giin handy.
 
Next week: well there was a white board with GIIN written on it. This is what 
Karrren would call her own brand of gin. I can’t wait to see how they ruin gin.
 
Jess confidently predicts that Dillon will be back at the house.

Even when he doesn’t come back, she doesn’t seem to accept it. Grainne 
impresses on the rest of the house, how real this shit just got.
 
No! She goes back to the house instead. THEN she probably visits the 
conveniences. So a double firing tonight - Dillon and Sofiane are off in 
separate taxis like a couple in First Dates who’d rather not go for that drink 
after the meal.
 
It’s getting close to the end now, says Alan. It really doesn’t feel like it.

WAIT. Sofiane is also fired. Grainne quietly shits herself.
 
Alan can’t deal with folk who have no regard for others, he tells Sofiane. 
Grainne says she’s won three tasks which isn’t none. Dillon tries to re-design 
the stupid game after the fact as Alan’s brow darkens and he gets.....the 
finger.

Dillon is gone. No, not Dillon. I’d only just really noticed his eyebrows.
 
Dillon gives an impassioned speech a bit like the one Madonna does about 
turning up in New York with $37 to her name and a desire to make it in the big 
city. He is so like Madonna. For a moment there, he is in the spotlight but it 
is quickly snuffed out by Sofiane.

The other two want Sofiane to go. Sofiane wants “definitely not me” to go. 
Hmmmm.
 
I really don’t want Grainne to go. Which probably means she’s gone. 
 
Alana goes back to the house, little believing that she doesn’t have to have a 
full on verbal slap-fight with the others for her place on the show. I’m 
surprised too.

Alan and his familiars have a quick conflab and they three marked ones are 
back in the room. Dillon’s face is all defiance and steel. The other two less 
so.
 
Sofiane is bringing back Dillon and Grainne. Graiine????!!! Whut?
 
Sofiane gets a tongue-lashing for going off-script during the pitch. Dillon 
says he stepped back because he didn’t want to talk over the others and look 
unprofessional, which Al and co would 100% have told him off for.
 
Alana is getting heat for not shouting louder over her teammates when their 
shit ideas took precedence.
 
A Gloucester Old Spot has literally just flown past my window.
 
Sofiane blames Alana for not coating him off about the rubbish idea sooner. 
Because he’d have loved that and totally taken it on board.
