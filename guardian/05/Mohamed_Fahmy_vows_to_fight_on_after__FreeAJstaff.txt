were finally pardoned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/egypt-pardons-jailed-al-jazeera-journalists>
 by Egypt’s president after 20 months in prison and a long global campaign to 
free them.

The two men, who worked for al-Jazeera along with their colleague Peter Greste 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/04/peter-greste-captives-egypt-al-jazeera-australia>
, had been arrested in December 2013 oncharges of reporting “false news 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/06/al-jazeera-journalists-jailed-for-airing-false-news-egyptian-court-ruling-says>
”.

A trial widely criticised as a political charade by human rights groups and 
international observers, the three journalists were sentenced to 7-10 years in 
June 2014.

But international pressure continued, drawing in governments, human rights 
organisations, high-profile figures and sparking a social media movement under 
the hashtags#FreeAJStaff <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeAJStaff&src=typd> 
and#JournalismIsNotACrime 
<https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JournalismIsNotACrime&src=typd>.


In February 2015, Greste, an Australian national, was finally deported back 
home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/01/peter-greste-al-jazeera-released-egypt>
. Fahmy and Mohamed instead faced a retrial, where once again they were found 
guilty, this time sentenced to three years.

However, a few weeks later president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi> surprised the world by 
pardoning them.
Mohamed Fadel Fahmy (@MFFahmy11) 
I am free! This time for real! Cops dropped me at CAC my old high school in my 
prison garb. Party Time!#FreeAJStaff

<https://twitter.com/MFFahmy11/status/646717278973784064> 
Now free for one month, Mohamed Fahmy spoke to African Arguments about his 
time in prison, his disappointment in al-Jazeera, and where he believes the 
world’s attention ought to be directed now.

How did you cope in jail?

You have to keep a balance between your physical, mental and spiritual 
wellbeing, so I tried to exercise when I could, even if it was just in my cell. 
There was no reading material in the beginning so it was tough to keep myself 
busy and distracted.

[Then] Baher and I initiated a radio mock show. We weren’t allowed out of our 
cells, but there was a small window in the door overlooking the corridor. If 
you looked out of it you could see a bit of the face of the other prisoner. It 
was very surreal. But it meant we could communicate verbally, so at a certain 
time at night, we’d ask everybody to go to their cell door and we’d say: “Okay, 
we’re starting the al-Jazeera radio show. We’re going to begin with Mr 
so-and-so and he’s going to recite some poetry.”

We took this radio show very seriously, like we were really at work.

Was there a moment you realised you were going to be in jail for a long time?

I never thought it would be that long. When we were arrested, they 
interrogated us and then we weresent to Scorpion Prison 
<http://www.smh.com.au/world/peter-greste-case-inside-egypts-tora-prison-20140624-zsk2u.html>
, a maximum security [facility] reserved for jihadists, terrorists and 
Islamists.

I opened the newspapers and saw images of my family crying – ​ ​that was my 
low point. I broke down in tears
Mohamed Fahmy 
I just couldn’t believe where I was. One minute we were in the five-star 
Marriot Hotel, the next minute we were with Mohamed al-Zawahiri, the brother of 
Ayman, head of al-Qaida. We were with jihadists who just came back from Syria 
fighting with Isis, coming back to topple the Egyptian regime, or surrounded by 
senior members of theMuslim Brotherhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood>.

You just think the nightmare will be over tomorrow. But three weeks later when 
they referred the case to trial, I realised we were in deep, deep trouble, and 
for accusations that were horrific − conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood, 
financing and providing them with equipment, fabricating news to serve their 
agenda and to smear Egypt’s reputation, operating without proper licences. It 
was really scary.

What were the low points?

When we were sentenced to seven years in the first trial. I was expecting to 
be acquitted. I had actually smuggled out a celebratory letter and asked my 
wife to send it out when the sentence was announced. If you see the video when 
they announced [it], it took about seven cops to get me out of the cage. I was 
clinging onto the bars. I couldn’t believe it. Even talking about it now…

The next day we had to change our clothes from white to the blue reserved for 
convicted prisoners, and that’s when I opened the newspapers and saw images of 
my family crying – that was my low point. I broke down in tears for the first 
time. All of us did. If you look at Egypt’s history and see the trend of 
sentences, those who get sentenced actually do their time. It is very rare to 
get a pardon.

Why do you think you were pardoned?

I think the motive was the result of an unprecedented global campaign. My 
family and wife did non-stop lobbying. My lawyers were not just working in 
court but lobbying behind closed doors too. And finally the armies of diplomats 
around the world stood up for us.

I think the Egyptian president just wanted to minimise the damage and end this 
whole headache, especially [as he] wanted to improve the image of Egypt before 
going to theUN [general assembly] in September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/un-70th-general-assembly-new-york-putin-obama-syria>
.

Did it feel like the #FreeAJStaff campaign changed after Peter Greste was 
released?

No, it was a very powerful campaign all the way. Al-Jazeera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/al-jazeera> continued their arrogance by not 
lobbying where we were actually detained. They lobbied all over the world, 
spending millions on conferences in London and LA, having full-page ads in New 
York, but they should [have known] that the Egyptian government is very 
sensitive to someone telling them what to do.

This is also where Amal Clooney [Fahmy’s lawyer] comes in. She was lobbying 
Egyptian ambassadors abroad, reminding them [that I had] protestedagainst the 
Muslim Brotherhood.

I wasn’t depending on al-Jazeera at all. I had stopped communicating with 
them. I was furious with them.

Now that you are free, where should our attentions turn next?

I am now directing the spotlight and attention on protecting and advocating 
for journalists jailed across the globe. There are more than200 journalists 
behind bars <https://cpj.org/imprisoned/2014.php> in the world and 65 have died 
just this year.

, before he went to Syria, came to visit me in Cairo and asked for my flak 
jacket. Seeing Steven killed by Isis while I was in prison, and then realising 
so many of my friends are [also] in prison, I decided to start theFahmy 
Foundation <http://www.fahmyfoundation.com/>.

Shawkan <https://cpj.org/campaigns/pressuncuffed/mahmoud-abou-zeid.php> 
[Mahmoud Abou Zeid], an Egyptian photographer, has been in prison for two 
years. He’s one of the people I’m advocating for.

Woubshet Taye <https://cpj.org/tags/Woubshet%20Taye> from Ethiopia is someone 
we’re fighting for as well. His letters written from prison are on our website, 
I’ve spoken with his wife, and we’ll continue to fight for him.

Jason Rezaian <https://cpj.org/tags/Jason%20Rezaian> is in prison in Iran.

Qatari poet Mohammed al-‘Ajami 
<http://www.pen.org/defending-writers/mohammed-al-ajami> has been sentenced to 
15 years for writing a poem about the Arab Spring.

Raif Badawi <http://www.raifbadawi.org/> in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to 
1,000 lashes and 10 years for giving his opinion about Islamic clerics.

The list goes on <https://cpj.org/imprisoned/2014.php>.

What’s your message to those who may have signed petitions and protested for 
your release and who think that now the campaign is over?

My message to them is that my colleagues in absentia have not been pardoned 
yet. We should continue to call for their pardon.

Mohamed Fahmy hits out at al-Jazeera over its protection of journalists

<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/20/mohamed-fahmy-al-jazeera-protecting-journalists-cairo-agenda>
Secondly, my duty in highlighting al-Jazeera’s mistakes is a way of expressing 
my gratitude to all those who campaigned. We’ve got to recognise that freedom 
of expression is not just expecting governments to respect our right to report 
freely and safely; it’s also expecting the networks to put the safety of 
journalists above any story and to continue to work transparently towards our 
craft of the Fourth Estate.

[Al-Jazeera responded to earlier Fahmy’s claims in February 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/20/mohamed-fahmy-al-jazeera-protecting-journalists-cairo-agenda>
. An official spokesman said in a statement: “We want our journalists out of 
jail and have a first-class legal team. We have always acted in the best 
possible way according to the information and advice available.

“As the most-watched Arabic broadcaster in the Middle East, and the only 
Arabic network still airing all sides of the story inEgypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt>, we have faced a fierce campaign of 
intimidation in the country. Our response to these challenging circumstances 
can of course be scrutinised but no one should lose sight [of the fact] that 
the responsibility for jailing journalists lies firmly with the jailers.”]
