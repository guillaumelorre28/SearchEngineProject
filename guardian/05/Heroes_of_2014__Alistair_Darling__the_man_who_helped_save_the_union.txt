Before the Scottish independence referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence>, the Labour party 
knew everything there was to know about anti-Tory campaigning, except what it 
felt like to be on the receiving end. When it came, the charge of complicity 
with David Cameron was all the more painful because it was true.

As leader of the cross-party Better Together campaign, Alistair Darling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling> relied on Conservative 
money while also having to fire up Labour activists and involve senior Liberal 
Democrats. And all the while he had to rebut nationalist claims that the whole 
no operation was a Westminster stitch-up.

In style and manner, Darling was not most people’s idea of a charismatic 
figurehead, especially when cast against Alex Salmond’s cheery impresario act. 
But he bested Salmond in thefirst crucial TV debate between them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/05/salmond-darling-debate>. 
He put up with unhelpful Tory briefings when the campaign lacked lustre. He 
withstood heaps of personal abuse from nationalist ultras. In the final days he 
graciously ceded the limelight to Gordon Brown, despite old animosities between 
the pair.

The no campaign was far from perfect, but in the end it was won – and while 
there is no single person of whom it can be said “saved the union”, the union 
was saved. The mission was Alistair Darling’s and he accomplished it.
