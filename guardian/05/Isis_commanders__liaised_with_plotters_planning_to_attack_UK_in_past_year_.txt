Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> commanders in Syria 
have communicated with jihadis attempting to stage terrorist attacks in Britain 
in the past year, counter-terrorism investigators believe.

The intention was to add Britain to the list of western countries hit in the 
past 12 months. An attack in 2017 is still deemed highly likely and the severe 
terrorist threat level is expected to remain.

A source said: “There is an assumption that it won’t abate in 2017. People do 
not believe that it is going to get better.”

In the last 30 months, since the rise of Isis in 2014, 11 Islamist attack 
plots on British soil have been identified and disrupted. Authorities in 
Britain believe there were four plots in 2016 aimed at inflicting mass 
casualties, all of which were shut down after arrests were made. Some are 
believed to have been inspired by Islamist propaganda. But there have been 
plots with direct involvement from Isis military planners inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, communicating with terrorists trying 
to attack the UK, investigators believe.

Extra security measures were introduced in Britain after a truck attack on a 
Christmas market in Berlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/23/anis-amri-berlin-attack-suspect-shot-dead-milan>
 killed 12 on Monday.

Police and the National Crime Agency have launched their biggest effort to 
take guns off the street before terrorists can get hold of them. On Friday the 
NCA said the effort to capture illegal firearms had “never been a more 
significant priority”.

Counter-terrorism detectives and MI5 are experiencing intense workloads as 
they track terrorist activity.

More than 850 Britons are believed to have travelled to Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/undercover-officer-infiltrated-pro-isis-britons-heading-for-syria-court-told>
 after Isis declared a caliphate in August 2014. About 15% were killed while 
overseas, mostly while fighting for the terrorist group. An estimated 350 
remain abroad.

Of the remainder, the prime concern for counter-terrorism investigators is the 
estimated 300 people who went to train with Isis in Syria then returned to 
Britain.

The rate of Britons going to join Isis in Syria has slowed, possibly because 
awareness campaigns, or that most of those minded to join have already done so. 
The rate of Britons returning from Syria has also slowed.


Investigators believe that a former commander in charge of planning attacks on 
Europe, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, sent a fellow terrorist to British cities to plan 
an attack.

Mohamed Abrini 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/28/there-was-no-plan-to-attack-uk-says-brussels-terror-suspect>
 visited locations in Britain in 2015 including shopping centres in Birmingham 
and the Old Trafford stadium in Manchester. Abrini, since arrested over the
attack on Brussels airport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/22/brussels-airport-explosions-live-updates>
 in March, claimed he was in the UK to collect money.

The Guardian understands pictures taken during Abrini’s British trip were 
found on a phone belonging to Abaaoud, which were recovered by French 
authorities after the November 2015 attacks in Paris that killed 130, andwhich 
Abaaoud led 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/16/abdelhamid-abaaoud-named-as-alleged-mastermind-of-paris-terror-attacks>
. He was later killed by French police.

Raffaello Pantucci, from the Royal United Services Institute, said: “Isis is 
very interested in hitting the UK, but it is harder, so they are going where it 
is easier. We’re likely to see a continuing level of threat we’ve seen in the 
last couple of years.”

The threat has been mitigated by the fact Britain does not share extensive 
land borders with Europe and has tight gun laws. But throughout the past year 
the increasing availability ofguns <https://www.theguardian.com/world/gun-crime>
 has been a growing concern.

The rise of Isis and its threats to attack the west led Britain in 2014 to 
raise its terrorist threat level. “Severe” means the joint terrorism analysis 
centre believes an attack is highly likely.
