Mansoor on Alice

What were you hoping for?
A lil’ bit of romance.


First impressions?
Very pretty smile, nice teeth, cute.

What did you talk about?
Where we studied, London, rent prices and travelling.

Any awkward moments?
Bolognese ending up on my white shirt – note for next time: stick to something 
that won’t splash.

Good table manners?
Impeccable.

Best thing about Alice?
She is easy to talk to and easy on the eye.

Would you introduce her to your friends?
Yes, I would, because she’s easygoing and likes travelling.


Describe Alice in three words
Well-travelled, cultured, cute.

What do you think she made of you?
Unusually for me, I was slightly nervous, so I hope that wasn’t terribly 
visible.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, the vibe wasn’t right and I think she was keen to depart.

And… did you kiss?
No, we didn’t, apart from a peck on the cheek – I don’t usually count those.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d go somewhere quieter, because it was hard to hear.

Marks out of 10?
7.

Would you meet again?
Only as friends, because unfortunately there was no spark.

nervous.

Even when eating spaghetti.

He was very good at topping up my drink and seemed interested in everything I 
said.

Interesting, friendly, chatty.

What do you think he made of you?
Someone who talks a lot and seems to be always on holiday.

Did you go on somewhere?
Nope, it was a “school” night.
