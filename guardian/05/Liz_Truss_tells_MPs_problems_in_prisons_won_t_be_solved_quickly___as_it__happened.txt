Afternoon summary

 * Liz Truss, the justice secretary, has said that improving conditions in 
prisons will “be difficult” and that it will take time.Giving a statement to 
MPs about the Birmingham prison riot 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-to-commons-on-hmp-birmingham>
, in which she also confirmed there would be an inquiry into what happened, she 
said: 
As I have said before, levels of violence are too high in our prisons. We also 
have very concerning levels of self-harm and deaths in custody. That is why we 
are reforming our prisons to be safe and purposeful places and taking swift 
action to deal with drugs, drones and phones.

It is important to remember that these problems have developed over a number 
of years and it will take time and it will take concerted effort to turn the 
situation round ...

The issues in our prisons are longstanding and they are not going to be 
completely solved in weeks or even months.

But she said that government reforms were “the right way to address the issues 
in our prisons so that they become purposeful places where offenders get off 
drugs and get the education and skills they need to find work and turn their 
back on crime for good.”

 * Theresa May has refused to rule out the UK paying money to the EU after it 
leaves.(See 5.36pm.)

 * Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has that Saudi Arabia has agreed to 
stop using British-made cluster bombs in Yemen.But it has admitted having used 
cluster bombs it obtained from Britain in the 1980s in the conflict, he told 
MPs. 
The [Saudi-led] coalition confirmed earlier today that a limited number of 
BL755 cluster munitions exported from the United Kingdom in the 1980s were 
dropped in Yemen, including in the incident alleged by Amnesty International 
not far from the Saudi border, by a coalition aircraft. The coalition, whose 
members are not party to the [cluster munitions] convention, has said that the 
munitions were used against a legitimate military target and did not therefore 
contravene international humanitarian law. However, Saudi Arabia has now 
confirmed that it will not further use BL755 cluster munitions and I welcome 
that.

 * Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, has seen off an attempt 
to remove her from office following a failed green energy scheme costing 
taxpayers £400m. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/19/northern-ireland-arlene-foster-survives-no-confidence-vote-green-energy-scandal-sinn-fein>
 * Rupert Murdoch has written to the Guardian to deny he ever claimed that 
Downing Street does his bidding, as a bid by his US film and television group 
to acquire Sky is due to be formally notified to ministers. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/19/rupert-murdoch-ive-never-asked-any-prime-minister-for-anything>
 * The government has been narrowly defeated in the Lords over the protection 
of pension pots by a “funder of last resort”. As the Press Association reports, 
an amendment to the pension schemes bill, which tightens regulation of 
so-called master trust schemes, was backed by 209 votes to 204, a majority of 
five. The defeat, at the hands of Labour and Liberal Democrat peers, came 
despite a warning by work and pensions minister Lord Freud that it amounted to 
a costly and disproportionate “sledgehammer”. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, is making a statement to the Commons 
now about the use of British-made cluster bombs by Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

His statement seems to have been prompted by today’s Guardian story saying 
ministers had seen evidence suggesting this was the case. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/18/uk-cluster-bombs-used-in-yemen-by-saudi-arabia-finds-research>

Fallon said Saudi Arabia admitted earlier today that it has used British 
cluster bombs in Yemen.

Theresa May's statement on the EU summit - Summary

Here are the main points from Theresa May’s statement.

 * May refused to rule out the UK paying money to the EU after it left. The 
Conservative MPPhilip Davies challenged her to promise not to pay the EU any 
more money after Brexit, saying that contributing to the EU budget like this 
would amount to “betraying what people voted for”. But May refused to give that 
assurance. She told Davies: 
I think what’s important is when we leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> people want to ensure that it is the 
British government that decides how taxpayers’ money is spent.

 * May implied that she wanted Britain to remain in Eurojust and Europol and 
to keep the European arrest warrant after Brexit.When the Labour MP David Hanson
asked if she wanted the UK to keep participating in these arrangements, May 
replied: 
Well, the right honourable gentleman knows that I have stood at this despatch 
box previously and indeed argued that we should remain within these particular 
aspects. The whole question of security, of cooperation on crime, of course is 
an issue that is going to be part of the negotiations. But again it’s an issue 
where it is not just a question of what is in the UK’s interests. Actually, the 
UK working with partners in the European Union is in their interests too.

 * She signalled that she definitely wants Britain to negotiate a transitional 
deal.When asked if she agreed with what Philip Hammond said about this last 
week, she said that Hammond was just reflecting what she herself said to the 
CBI (see4.09pm)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/19/theresa-may-statement-brexit-eu-will-not-allow-uk-partial-membership-of-customs-union-trade-expert-warns-politics-live?page=with:block-585805e3e4b06683cdf1f253#block-585805e3e4b06683cdf1f253>
- even thoughMay’s comment at the CBI during a Q&A was just a hint that she 
backed a transitional deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/21/theresa-may-cbi-speech-signals-plan-to-put-workers-on-company-boards-being-watered-down-politics-live?page=with:block-5832cab5e4b0da4920d6ae52#block-5832cab5e4b0da4920d6ae52>
, whileHammond explicitly called for one.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211#block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211>
 * She said she wanted a deal a deal guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals 
living in Britain and Britons in other EU countries “early on”. In her opening 
statement she said: 
At the council, I also reaffirmed my commitment to a smooth and orderly exit – 
and in this spirit, I made it clear to the other EU leaders that it remains my 
objective that we give reassurance early on in the negotiations to EU citizens 
living in the UK, and UK citizens living in EU countries, that their right to 
stay where they have made their homes will be protected by our withdrawal.

This is an issue which I would like to agree quickly but clearly that requires 
the agreement of the rest of the EU.

 * Jeremy Corbyn accused May of adopting a “shambolic” approach to Brexit. In 
his response to May he said: 
At the moment it is clear that on the international stage the prime minister 
and Britain are becoming increasingly isolated.

And if we are to build a successful Britain after Brexit it is more vital than 
ever that our relationship with our European partners remains, strong, cordial 
and respectful.

It is also clear through my own discussions; European leaders are becoming 
increasingly frustrated by her shambolic government and their contradictory 
approach to Brexit negotiations. The mixed messages from her frontbench only 
add to the confusion. This government fails to speak for the whole country; 
instead we hear a babble of voices speaking for themselves and their vested 
interests.

 * May said those responsible for the killings in Aleppo would be held to 
account. 
President Assad may be congratulating his regime forces on their actions in 
Aleppo but we are in no doubt - this is no victory, it is a tragedy, one we 
will not forget.

Last week’s council reiterated that those responsible must be held to account.

 * She announced that the government was spending a further £20m on aid for 
refugees from Syria.

Truss is responding to Burgon.

She says G4S will be paying the cost of what happened at Birmingham.

But conditions need to improve in both private and public prisons, she 
suggests.

The government is reforming prisons. But it will take time, she says.

Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, says Truss is failing to admit 
that there is a crisis in prisons. The riot was a symptom of that, he says.

He asks why private prisons are allowed not to reveal their staffing levels. 

And he questions whether private firms should be operating prisons anyway.

Will Truss admit that it was “wrong and dangerous” to cut 6,000 staff from the 
prison service.

 * Liz Truss, the justice secretary, has said that improving conditions in 
prisons will “be difficult” and that it will take time.Giving a statement to 
MPs about the Birmingham prison riot 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-to-commons-on-hmp-birmingham>
, in which she also confirmed there would be an inquiry into what happened, she 
said: 
As I have said before, levels of violence are too high in our prisons. We also 
have very concerning levels of self-harm and deaths in custody. That is why we 
are reforming our prisons to be safe and purposeful places and taking swift 
action to deal with drugs, drones and phones.

It is important to remember that these problems have developed over a number 
of years and it will take time and it will take concerted effort to turn the 
situation round ...

The issues in our prisons are longstanding and they are not going to be 
completely solved in weeks or even months.

But she said that government reforms were “the right way to address the issues 
in our prisons so that they become purposeful places where offenders get off 
drugs and get the education and skills they need to find work and turn their 
back on crime for good.”

 * Theresa May has refused to rule out the UK paying money to the EU after it 
leaves.(See 5.36pm.)

 * Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has that Saudi Arabia has agreed to 
stop using British-made cluster bombs in Yemen.But it has admitted having used 
cluster bombs it obtained from Britain in the 1980s in the conflict, he told 
MPs. 
The [Saudi-led] coalition confirmed earlier today that a limited number of 
BL755 cluster munitions exported from the United Kingdom in the 1980s were 
dropped in Yemen, including in the incident alleged by Amnesty International 
not far from the Saudi border, by a coalition aircraft. The coalition, whose 
members are not party to the [cluster munitions] convention, has said that the 
munitions were used against a legitimate military target and did not therefore 
contravene international humanitarian law. However, Saudi Arabia has now 
confirmed that it will not further use BL755 cluster munitions and I welcome 
that.

 * Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, has seen off an attempt 
to remove her from office following a failed green energy scheme costing 
taxpayers £400m.

 * Rupert Murdoch has written to the Guardian to deny he ever claimed that 
Downing Street does his bidding, as a bid by his US film and television group 
to acquire Sky is due to be formally notified to ministers.

 * The government has been narrowly defeated in the Lords over the protection 
of pension pots by a “funder of last resort”. As the Press Association reports, 
an amendment to the pension schemes bill, which tightens regulation of 
so-called master trust schemes, was backed by 209 votes to 204, a majority of 
five. The defeat, at the hands of Labour and Liberal Democrat peers, came 
despite a warning by work and pensions minister Lord Freud that it amounted to 
a costly and disproportionate “sledgehammer”. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, is making a statement to the Commons 
now about the use of British-made cluster bombs by Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

His statement seems to have been prompted by today’s Guardian story saying 
ministers had seen evidence suggesting this was the case. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/18/uk-cluster-bombs-used-in-yemen-by-saudi-arabia-finds-research>

Fallon said Saudi Arabia admitted earlier today that it has used British 
cluster bombs in Yemen.

Here are the main points from Theresa May’s statement.

 * May refused to rule out the UK paying money to the EU after it left. The 
Conservative MPPhilip Davies challenged her to promise not to pay the EU any 
more money after Brexit, saying that contributing to the EU budget like this 
would amount to “betraying what people voted for”. But May refused to give that 
assurance. She told Davies: 
I think what’s important is when we leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> people want to ensure that it is the 
British government that decides how taxpayers’ money is spent.

 * May implied that she wanted Britain to remain in Eurojust and Europol and 
to keep the European arrest warrant after Brexit.When the Labour MP David Hanson
asked if she wanted the UK to keep participating in these arrangements, May 
replied: 
Well, the right honourable gentleman knows that I have stood at this despatch 
box previously and indeed argued that we should remain within these particular 
aspects. The whole question of security, of cooperation on crime, of course is 
an issue that is going to be part of the negotiations. But again it’s an issue 
where it is not just a question of what is in the UK’s interests. Actually, the 
UK working with partners in the European Union is in their interests too.

 * She signalled that she definitely wants Britain to negotiate a transitional 
deal.When asked if she agreed with what Philip Hammond said about this last 
week, she said that Hammond was just reflecting what she herself said to the 
CBI (see4.09pm)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/19/theresa-may-statement-brexit-eu-will-not-allow-uk-partial-membership-of-customs-union-trade-expert-warns-politics-live?page=with:block-585805e3e4b06683cdf1f253#block-585805e3e4b06683cdf1f253>
- even thoughMay’s comment at the CBI during a Q&A was just a hint that she 
backed a transitional deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/21/theresa-may-cbi-speech-signals-plan-to-put-workers-on-company-boards-being-watered-down-politics-live?page=with:block-5832cab5e4b0da4920d6ae52#block-5832cab5e4b0da4920d6ae52>
, whileHammond explicitly called for one.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211#block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211>
 * She said she wanted a deal a deal guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals 
living in Britain and Britons in other EU countries “early on”. In her opening 
statement she said: 
At the council, I also reaffirmed my commitment to a smooth and orderly exit – 
and in this spirit, I made it clear to the other EU leaders that it remains my 
objective that we give reassurance early on in the negotiations to EU citizens 
living in the UK, and UK citizens living in EU countries, that their right to 
stay where they have made their homes will be protected by our withdrawal.

This is an issue which I would like to agree quickly but clearly that requires 
the agreement of the rest of the EU.

 * She said the government’s Brexit plan would be published some time before 
article 50 was triggered. (See 4.02pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/19/theresa-may-statement-brexit-eu-will-not-allow-uk-partial-membership-of-customs-union-trade-expert-warns-politics-live?page=with:block-58580452e4b0d9f3765c72c2#block-58580452e4b0d9f3765c72c2>
 * Jeremy Corbyn accused May of adopting a “shambolic” approach to Brexit. In 
his response to May he said: 
At the moment it is clear that on the international stage the prime minister 
and Britain are becoming increasingly isolated.

And if we are to build a successful Britain after Brexit it is more vital than 
ever that our relationship with our European partners remains, strong, cordial 
and respectful.

It is also clear through my own discussions; European leaders are becoming 
increasingly frustrated by her shambolic government and their contradictory 
approach to Brexit negotiations. The mixed messages from her frontbench only 
add to the confusion. This government fails to speak for the whole country; 
instead we hear a babble of voices speaking for themselves and their vested 
interests.

 * May said those responsible for the killings in Aleppo would be held to 
account. 
President Assad may be congratulating his regime forces on their actions in 
Aleppo but we are in no doubt - this is no victory, it is a tragedy, one we 
will not forget.

Last week’s council reiterated that those responsible must be held to account.

 * She announced that the government was spending a further £20m on aid for 
refugees from Syria.  
Truss is responding to Burgon.

She says G4S will be paying the cost of what happened at Birmingham.

But conditions need to improve in both private and public prisons, she 
suggests.

The government is reforming prisons. But it will take time, she says.
 
Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, says Truss is failing to admit 
that there is a crisis in prisons. The riot was a symptom of that, he says.

He asks why private prisons are allowed not to reveal their staffing levels. 

And he questions whether private firms should be operating prisons anyway.

Will Truss admit that it was “wrong and dangerous” to cut 6,000 staff from the 
prison service.
 
Truss says the government reforms will make prisons safer.

She says the next few months will be difficult. 

But she is confident she can turn things around, she says.

Truss says 380 prisoners have been moved out of Birmingham.
 
Truss says a plan was put in place to take back control.

She says, in these circumstances, it is important to take time to make sure 
the resources are in place to deal with it properly.
