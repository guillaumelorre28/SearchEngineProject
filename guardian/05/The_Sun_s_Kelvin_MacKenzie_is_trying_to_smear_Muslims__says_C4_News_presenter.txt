The Channel 4 News presenter who was criticised by Kelvin MacKenzie for 
wearing a hijab while reporting on the Nice truck attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/19/the-sun-kelvin-mackenzie-complaints-channel-4-news-fatima-manji>
 has hit back at the former Sun editor for attempting to “intimidate Muslims 
out of public life”.


Fatima Manji said MacKenzie, whose column has now prompted 1,400 complaints to 
the press regulator, had attempted to smear 1.6 billion Muslims in suggesting 
they are inherently violent.

“He has attempted to smear half of them further by suggesting they are 
helpless slaves,” she said. “And he has attempted to smear me by suggesting I 
would sympathise with a terrorist.”

Manji was writing in the Liverpool Echo on Tuesday  
<http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/fatima-manji-truth-kelvin-mackenzies-11635404>
a day after MacKenzie’s column appeared in the Sun, headlined: “Why did C4 have 
a presenter in a hijab to front coverage of Muslim terror attack?”

MacKenzie said he could hardly believe his eyes when Manji appeared onscreen 
during theChannel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> News programme 
on Friday. “Was it appropriate for her to be on camera when there had been yet 
another shocking slaughter by a Muslim?” he wrote.

The Sun <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sun> column had provoked 1,400 
complaints to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) by the end of 
Tuesday. The complaints related predominantly to the accuracy of the article, 
discrimination and harassment.

Manji’s response was headlined “The Truth – why Kelvin MacKenzie’s smears 
won’t stop me from doing my job”, a reference to the Sun front page about the 
Hillsborough tragedy which prompted a boycott of the paper in Liverpool.

The Channel 4 News presenter wrote: “It would be easy to dismiss Kelvin 
MacKenzie <https://www.theguardian.com/media/kelvin-mackenzie> as an 
embarrassing, and serially embarrassed, relic of a bygone era in British 
journalism.

“But it’s dangerous to regard Mr MacKenzie and those who echo his Islamophobic 
sentiments as mere pantomime villains.

“Their soapbox allows them to spread their ill-informed, irresponsible and 
malevolent invective to millions of readers. Racist and Islamophobic rhetoric 
has real consequences – lives have been lost and shattered in our own country.

“Mr MacKenzie’s article was but one wild screed in a long-running and 
widespread campaign to intimidate Muslims out of public life.

“Young men and women of all backgrounds regularly ask me for advice on how to 
forge a career in journalism. Mr MacKenzie’s monologue will frighten many of 
them into believing that they will be on the end of tabloid attacks merely for 
daring to do their jobs.”

Manji quoted several lines of MacKenzie’s column, including: “Was it done to 
stick one in the eye of the ordinary viewer who looks at the hijab as a sign of 
the slavery of Muslim women by a male-dominated and clearly violent religion?”

She responded: “Kelvin MacKenzie has attempted to smear 1.6 billion Muslims in 
suggesting they are inherently violent.

“He has attempted to smear half of them further by suggesting they are 
helpless slaves. And he has attempted to smear me by suggesting I would 
sympathise with a terrorist.

“In response to this, I have received kind messages from friends, colleagues, 
acquaintances and even those I have never met, expressing solidarity and anger 
at his words.

“I will not be deterred in this mission by the efforts of those who find the 
presence of Muslims in British cultural life offensive.”

She added: “THE TRUTH? I confess. I pi**ed [sic] on Kelvin MacKenzie’s 
apparent ambitions to force anyone who looks a little different off our 
screens, and I’ll keep doing it.”


It was Channel 4 News who first approached the Liverpool paper, part of the 
Trinity Mirror group, with the idea of printing a first person column by Manji.

Susan Lee, the Liverpool Echo’s print editor, said: “We were thrilled that she 
chose the Liverpool Echo. She obviously realises that we are a very straight 
newspaper with no side apart from being on the side of the Hillsborough 
families.”

Channel 4 News said MacKenzie’s comments were “offensive” and “completely 
unacceptable” while the National Union of Journalists was critical of the Sun 
and its former editor.

“To suggest that a journalist is incapable of reporting on a terrorist outrage 
because of the colour of her skin, her religion or the clothes that she wears 
says all you need to know about the contemptible views of Kelvin MacKenzie,” 
said the NUJ’s general secretary Michelle Stanistreet.

The Sun has so far declined to comment.
