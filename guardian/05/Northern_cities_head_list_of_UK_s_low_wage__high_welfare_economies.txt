Almost half of the UK’s biggest cities have low-wage, high-welfare economies, 
according to a healthcheck on urban Britain that underscores the challenges for 
the government’s benefit-cutting agenda.

George Osborne used his first budget of the Conservative government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-uk-gdp-other-rich-nations-george-osborne>
 last summer to advocate a“higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare country” 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-summer-budget-2015-speech>
. But a report published on Monday warns that his vision will take several 
parliaments to create, given current shortfalls in education, a housing crisis 
and inefficient jobs programmes.


The Centre for Cities <http://www.centreforcities.org/> study also highlights 
a stark north-south divide between conurbations and urges the chancellor to 
deliver on promises to rebalance Britain’s economy with projects like the “
northern powerhouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2015/mar/18/northern-powerhouse-is-north-really-winner-2015-budget>
”.


The independent thinktank’s annual Cities Outlook, covering the UK’s 63 
largest cities, classifies 29 as having low-wage, high-welfare economies. Nine 
of the worst performing city economies on the wages and welfare measure are in 
the north of England and Midlands, including Hull, Blackburn and Telford.

The report’s authors are urging the government to address the geographical 
divide by continuing to increase investment in regional economies, while giving 
cities more control over local tax revenue, skills, infrastructure and housing.

“One of the most pressing issues is the need to tackle skills gaps and improve 
schools’ attainment, especially in low-wage cities, to help those places 
attract businesses and jobs, and support more people to move into work, 
particularly in high-skill sectors,” said chief executive Alexandra Jones.

Jones called for an end to the duplication and other inefficiencies that 
result from the current system, where spending on employment and skills 
programmes is not connected to benefit spending.

“Cities also need more powers and incentives to boost jobs and wages. Giving 
places control over skills and welfare budgets, and allowing them to keep any 
savings made by reducing the welfare bill, would incentivise local leaders to 
invest in employment programmes that, if successful, would reduce people’s need 
for benefits payments.”

The report claims that 14 cities are already delivering “high-wage, 
low-welfare” economies. They include London, Aberdeen and Cambridge. Eight of 
the top 10 are in what the thinktank calls the “greater south east”.

 The thinktank said the top 10 high-wage cities were ranked in order of highest 
average wage, excluding places with higher than average welfare spend.

The thinktank defines low-wage, high-welfare economies as places where average 
wages are below the national average, but welfare spending is above. High-wage, 
low-welfare cities are defined as those where average wages are higher than the 
national average, and welfare spending is lower.

The report also highlights challenges in high-wage cities, largely stemming 
from a lack of affordable housing. Welfare spending had grown at a much faster 
rate in high-wage cities, with benefit payments more than 50% higher than in 
other places – largely due to high demand for housing resulting in increased 
housing benefit payments.

“For cities which have seen strong growth in wages and jobs, the focus should 
be on addressing housing shortages, to ensure that their success isn’t derailed 
by a lack of affordable homes,” said Jones.


The thinktank warns each of the changes its recommends – improvements in 
education and skills levels, devolution and integration of budgets and 
services, and increases in housing supply – will take several years to deliver, 
and longer still for the full range of benefits to be felt.

“Creating a higher wage, lower welfare economy will, in all likelihood, be the 
work not of one parliament but of several,” it concludes.


The report also adds to evidence that the rapid rise in employment in recent 
years has not been accompanied by any tangible income growth. The Cities 
Outlook noted nearly a million new jobs were created in UK cities between 2010 
and 2014 but that urban wages fell by 5% in the same period – a decrease in 
average annual salary of £1,300 per city dweller in real terms.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/communities> and Local Government said: 
“Today’s report is out of date, ignores the latest Office for National 
Statistics figures showing the employment rate at a record-breaking 74%, and 
focuses solely on cities, which takes no account of employment growth in large 
swaths of the country.

“In fact, 1.5 million more people are in work outside London and the 
south-east compared with 2010, a third of new apprenticeship starts in the last 
year were in the northern powerhouse, and full-time wages grew faster in areas 
including Greater Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and Worcestershire compared 
with the national average – even before our new national living wage takes 
effect in April this year.”
