Closing summary - and festive best wishes

With the markets closed, City traders are now scarpering to their homes (or 
the shops!) to begin the Christmas break. So in that spirit, I’m going to wrap 
up now.

I hope you all have an excellent Christmas break. We’ll be back next week for 
the final push towards 2017.

Here’s a quick summary:

Britain’s economy has continued to defy the doubters, with growth revised up 
to 0.6% in the three months after the EU referendum.

And with growth earlier in the year revised down, there’s no sign of a Brexit 
slump.

However, the country’s current account deficit has worsened, with exports 
dropping during the quarter.

Economists fear that the economy is still too reliant on domestic demand, as 
consumer spending could tail off in 2017 when inflation takes a bigger bite out 
of wages.

Over in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, the prime minister 
has confirmed that the country’s weakest banks will be strengthened with state 
capital, starting with Monte dei Paschi – whose efforts to bolster its own 
reserves failed this week.

 Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that:

“Today marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a 
corner and able to reassure its depositors.”

Two European banks, Deutsche Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank> and Credit Suisse, are

securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.

The London stock market has just closed for the Christmas break, after a very 
dull session.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained a mere 4 points to finish at 7,068. That’s 
a fairly muted reaction to the news that Britain’s economy performed better 
that expected in the last quarter, and that the Italian banking crisis is being 
resolved.

The markets seem to have run out of energy, after a wild year.

Joshua Mahony of IG says:

The lack of volumes associated with the holiday season can often bring the 
potential for significant volatility, yet in fact we have seen quite the 
opposite with the post-Trump romp largely brushed aside.

With US markets having hit new all-time highs and European markets also 
enjoying a substantial rally over the past month, there is little complain 
about this year. However, with the US economy is rude health, the US stock 
markets reaching new territory, Donald Trump will have a tough time trying to 
improve on the current state of play.

ECB: Wealth inequality up since eurozone crisis

Looking away from the UK economy, the European Central Bank has reported that 
wealth inequality across the eurozone has risen since the eurozone crisis began.

A new ECB survey  
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpsps/ecbsp17.en.pdf?1ec7c85bc7ace1c59117f664bdafeb08>
has found that average net wealth across the euro area shrank by 10% between 
2010 and 2014, to €223,300. This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house 
prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area.

Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was 
just €104,100, less than half the mean average of €223k. That’s because so much 
wealth is held by the richest people.

Households needed to own almost €500,000 to squeeze into the top 10%.

Wealth slumped particularly sharply in Greece and Cyprus, which both entered 
bailout programme, while net wealth in Germany rose by 10%.

And the ECB flags up that wealth inequality appears to have increased slightly.

The Gini coefficient, a frequently used indicator of overall wealth 
inequality, edged up to 68.5 percent from 68.0, which is within the margin of 
measurement error. A value of 0 corresponds to complete equality, while 100 
percent reflects maximum inequality - one household owning all wealth.


This could bolster criticism of the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy, which 
has pumped up the value of financial assets owned by richer Europeans. But the 
Bank argues that without its action, unemployment would be higher and growth 
lower.

Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned that UK 
households will feel a squeeze next year, which could hold back growth.

Here’s his comment on today’s growth figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-fined-billions-doj-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-approved-business-live?page=with:block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052#block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052>
:

“Q3’s Quarterly National Accounts brought some unexpected pre-Christmas cheer 
with Q3 GDP growth revised up from 0.5% to 0.6%.

“Consumer spending remained the key driver of growth in Q3, but the first cut 
of the income data raised further question marks about how long this can 
continue. Real household income dropped sharply in Q3, taking the annual growth 
rate to just 0.3%, the weakest outturn for two years.

With high inflation set to weigh further on spending power next year, the 
consumer is surely set to falter soon.

If you dig into the meat of today’s GDP report, there are reasons to worry -- 
even thoughthe UK’s growth rate was revised up to a punchy 0.6% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-fined-billions-doj-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-approved-business-live?page=with:block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052#block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052>
.

Household disposable income, for example, dropped by 0.6% during the quarter; 
the biggest drop in almost three years. And the widening current account 
deficit (see 10.10am 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-fined-billions-doj-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-approved-business-live?page=with:block-585cf328e4b0d460757ebd0d#block-585cf328e4b0d460757ebd0d>
) is another concern.


Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, says the report shows a 
‘diverging’ economy:

Very strong performance in the services sector, the sharpest rise in employee 
compensation in 3 years and outperformance in construction and industrial 
production are then firmly offset by very weak figures in household disposable 
income, continuing declines in business investment and a widening of the 
current account deficit.

The diverging performance of multiple sectors of the economy simply mirrors 
the uncertainty that Brexit prospects are imposing on the UK outlook, with 
pockets of robust growth continuing to be frustrated by much bigger questions 
relating to Britain’s future.

Treasury: Challenges ahead

The UK government has warned that Britain’s economy faces challenges, despite 
growing faster than thought in the last quarter.

A Treasury spokesperson doesn’t actually mention the Brexit negotiations, but 
I think we know what they’re hinting at. Here’s the official response:

“The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, but there remain challenges 
ahead.

The Chancellor set out, in the Autumn Statement, his plan to support a 
resilient economy that works for everyone by driving productivity and 
supporting working people, while maintaining fiscal discipline.”

Today’s report into the UK economy has good news for workers; compensation 
paid to employees rose by 4.5% in Q3. That’s the biggest rise since 2013, 
suggesting robust pay growth over the summer.

But..... business investment only rose by 0.4% in the quarter (revised down 
from 0.9%), which means it was 2.2% LOWER than a year earlier.

That indicates that firms did rein in their spending over the summer, after 
the Brexit vote.

Britain's current account deficit has widened

Worryingly, Britain’s current-account deficit has widened in the last quarter, 
as the country continues to import much more than it exports.

The difference between money flowing into the UK, and out, jumped to £25.5bn 
in July-September.

That’s the equivalent of 5.2% of the entire economic output this year, close 
to the record deficit recorded in 2013.

This deterioration is mainly due to weaker trade -- Britain’s trade deficit 
jumped from £11bn in Q2 to £16.7bn in Q3, according to the ONS.

Total UK exports decreased by 2.6% in the July-September quarter, while 
imports increased by 1.4%.

That’s despite the slump in the pound, which is meant to help exporters by 
making goods more competitively priced.

The ONS says:

Exports of goods decreased by 5.1% in Quarter 3 2016, due mainly to a decrease 
in exports of aircraft, chemicals and unspecified goods.

It’s not all good news, though - the ONS has revised down its estimate of UK 
growth in January-March to +0.3%, from +0.4%.

Growth in the second quarter of 2016 has also been trimmed, from 0.7% to 0.6%.

So, the UK economy grew just as fast in the three months after the EU 
referendum than in the three months after it.

UK growth rate revised up to +0.6%

NEWSFLASH: The UK economy grew faster than we thought in the three months 
after the Brexit referendum.

The Office for National Statistics has just revised up its estimate for UK GDP 
in the third quarter of 2016.

It now reckons that the British economy expanded by 0.6%, not the 0.5% 
previously reported. That’s a pretty decent rate of growth, especially given 
the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.

It’s because the ONS has revised up service sector growth (the largest part of 
the UK economy) in the last three months to 1.0%, from 08%.


And the City can take the credit, with output from the “business services and 
finance industries” growing faster than expected.

Darren Morgan, Head of GDP, says:

“Robust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the 
third quarter of 2016. Growth was slightly stronger than first thought, though, 
due to greater output in the financial sector.”

The ONS also says that industrial production only contracted by 0.4%, not 
0.5%, while construction sector output has been revised from -1.1% to -0.8%.

More to follow!

Today’s flurry of banking news has spared us from the usual pre-Christmas 
slump.

Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains what you need to know:

Firstly, overnight news that Monte dei Paschi is set to receive state aid as 
part of a €20bn package to keep the bank and troubled peers afloat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/italy-bail-out-monte-dei-paschi-di-siena-rescue-matteo-renzi>
 is something of a relief, even if it does involve taxpayer funds and 
represents a big déjà vu, having already been rescued in recent years. It 
allows savers to have a quieter break following an eventful week that saw the 
bank struggle and ultimately fail to raise funds privately. Now it’s a question 
of what price institutional bondholders have to pay and what sort of 
compensation retail investors will be offered to ensure the bailout follows new 
EU rules preventing the bill for state aid being unfairly pinned on taxpayers 
and that the deal is more politically palatable. It also remains to be seen how 
long the process will take. Talk yesterday of it taking several months to 
complete is a worryingly long time, allowing unhappy investors to brood and 
savers take flight, potentially making the current situation even worse. Veloce!

News from the US overnight makes for a mixed bag with continental behemoths 
Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse settling with the Department of Justice (DoJ) 
for pre-crisis mis-selling of mortgage backed securities (MBS) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-us-mortgage-securities-barclays>
. The former settled for $7bn (only half payable in cash) which is just half 
the $14bn challenge that shook markets this summer, something considered to be 
US retaliation for the EU’s call on Apple to repay Ireland €13bn in back taxes. 
Credit Suisse settling for $5bn for similar allegations makes it two out of 
three.

However a pre-Christmas hat-trick eludes the DoJ with UK giant Barclays 
refusing to give in, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/us-justice-department-accuses-barclays-over-mortgage-misselling>
 viewing claims against it as disproportionate to misdemeanours committed. 
Considering itself liable for just $1bn, it was happy to settle for $2bn, 
however, talks have broken down. The DoJ clearly wants more.

Deutsche bank shares +3.7% suggests relief at a good result and the affair 
being closed. Credit Suisse shares flat implies an acceptable deal. Barclays 
-0.3% indicates some uncertainty about what it eventually ends up paying. 
However there is no panic. If anything, the standout performer this morning is 
the bank that has yet to be mentioned. The DoJ wants to fine Royal Bank of 
Scotland $12bn for its own MBS mis-selling. Its shares are +1.8%

 on a combination of optimism that it too could settle for half, like Deutsche, 
although gains may be capped by the prospect of the DoJ taking a dislike to 
Barclays pushing its luck and decides to make life difficult for the UK

With the markets closed, City traders are now scarpering to their homes (or 
the shops!) to begin the Christmas break. So in that spirit, I’m going to wrap 
up now.

I hope you all have an excellent Christmas break. We’ll be back next week for 
the final push towards 2017.

Here’s a quick summary:

Britain’s economy has continued to defy the doubters, with growth revised up 
to 0.6% in the three months after the EU referendum. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-fined-billions-doj-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-approved-business-live?page=with:block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052#block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052>

And with growth earlier in the year revised down, there’s no sign of a Brexit 
slump.

However, the country’s current account deficit has worsened, with exports 
dropping during the quarter.

Economists fear that the economy is still too reliant on domestic demand, as 
consumer spending could tail off in 2017 when inflation takes a bigger bite out 
of wages.

Over in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, the prime minister 
has confirmed that the country’s weakest banks will be strengthened with state 
capital, starting with Monte dei Paschi – whose efforts to bolster its own 
reserves failed this week.

 Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that:

“Today marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a 
corner and able to reassure its depositors.”

Two European banks, Deutsche Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank> and Credit Suisse, are

securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.

The London stock market has just closed for the Christmas break, after a very 
dull session.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained a mere 4 points to finish at 7,068. That’s 
a fairly muted reaction to the news that Britain’s economy performed better 
that expected in the last quarter, and that the Italian banking crisis is being 
resolved.

The markets seem to have run out of energy, after a wild year.

Joshua Mahony of IG says:

The lack of volumes associated with the holiday season can often bring the 
potential for significant volatility, yet in fact we have seen quite the 
opposite with the post-Trump romp largely brushed aside.

With US markets having hit new all-time highs and European markets also 
enjoying a substantial rally over the past month, there is little complain 
about this year. However, with the US economy is rude health, the US stock 
markets reaching new territory, Donald Trump will have a tough time trying to 
improve on the current state of play.
 
Looking away from the UK economy, the European Central Bank has reported that 
wealth inequality across the eurozone has risen since the eurozone crisis began.

A new ECB survey  
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpsps/ecbsp17.en.pdf?1ec7c85bc7ace1c59117f664bdafeb08>
has found that average net wealth across the euro area shrank by 10% between 
2010 and 2014, to €223,300. This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house 
prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area.

Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was 
just €104,100, less than half the mean average of €223k. That’s because so much 
wealth is held by the richest people.

Households needed to own almost €500,000 to squeeze into the top 10%.

Wealth slumped particularly sharply in Greece and Cyprus, which both entered 
bailout programme, while net wealth in Germany rose by 10%.

And the ECB flags up that wealth inequality appears to have increased slightly.

The Gini coefficient, a frequently used indicator of overall wealth 
inequality, edged up to 68.5 percent from 68.0, which is within the margin of 
measurement error. A value of 0 corresponds to complete equality, while 100 
percent reflects maximum inequality - one household owning all wealth.


This could bolster criticism of the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy, which 
has pumped up the value of financial assets owned by richer Europeans. But the 
Bank argues that without its action, unemployment would be higher and growth 
lower.
 
Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned that UK 
households will feel a squeeze next year, which could hold back growth.

Here’s his comment on today’s growth figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-fined-billions-doj-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-approved-business-live?page=with:block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052#block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052>
:

“Q3’s Quarterly National Accounts brought some unexpected pre-Christmas cheer 
with Q3 GDP growth revised up from 0.5% to 0.6%.

“Consumer spending remained the key driver of growth in Q3, but the first cut 
of the income data raised further question marks about how long this can 
continue. Real household income dropped sharply in Q3, taking the annual growth 
rate to just 0.3%, the weakest outturn for two years.

With high inflation set to weigh further on spending power next year, the 
consumer is surely set to falter soon.
 
If you dig into the meat of today’s GDP report, there are reasons to worry -- 
even thoughthe UK’s growth rate was revised up to a punchy 0.6% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-fined-billions-doj-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-approved-business-live?page=with:block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052#block-585ceedfe4b06265ff0d6052>
.

Household disposable income, for example, dropped by 0.6% during the quarter; 
the biggest drop in almost three years. And the widening current account 
deficit (see 10.10am 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/23/deutsche-bank-credit-suisse-fined-billions-doj-monte-dei-paschi-bailout-approved-business-live?page=with:block-585cf328e4b0d460757ebd0d#block-585cf328e4b0d460757ebd0d>
) is another concern.


Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, says the report shows a 
‘diverging’ economy:

Very strong performance in the services sector, the sharpest rise in employee 
compensation in 3 years and outperformance in construction and industrial 
production are then firmly offset by very weak figures in household disposable 
income, continuing declines in business investment and a widening of the 
current account deficit.

The diverging performance of multiple sectors of the economy simply mirrors 
the uncertainty that Brexit prospects are imposing on the UK outlook, with 
pockets of robust growth continuing to be frustrated by much bigger questions 
relating to Britain’s future.
 
The UK government has warned that Britain’s economy faces challenges, despite 
growing faster than thought in the last quarter.

A Treasury spokesperson doesn’t actually mention the Brexit negotiations, but 
I think we know what they’re hinting at. Here’s the official response:

“The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, but there remain challenges 
ahead.

The Chancellor set out, in the Autumn Statement, his plan to support a 
resilient economy that works for everyone by driving productivity and 
supporting working people, while maintaining fiscal discipline.”
 
Today’s report into the UK economy has good news for workers; compensation 
paid to employees rose by 4.5% in Q3. That’s the biggest rise since 2013, 
suggesting robust pay growth over the summer.

But..... business investment only rose by 0.4% in the quarter (revised down 
from 0.9%), which means it was 2.2% LOWER than a year earlier.

That indicates that firms did rein in their spending over the summer, after 
the Brexit vote.
 
Worryingly, Britain’s current-account deficit has widened in the last quarter, 
as the country continues to import much more than it exports.

The difference between money flowing into the UK, and out, jumped to £25.5bn 
in July-September.

That’s the equivalent of 5.2% of the entire economic output this year, close 
to the record deficit recorded in 2013.

This deterioration is mainly due to weaker trade -- Britain’s trade deficit 
jumped from £11bn in Q2 to £16.7bn in Q3, according to the ONS.

Total UK exports decreased by 2.6% in the July-September quarter, while 
imports increased by 1.4%.

That’s despite the slump in the pound, which is meant to help exporters by 
making goods more competitively priced.

The ONS says:

Exports of goods decreased by 5.1% in Quarter 3 2016, due mainly to a decrease 
in exports of aircraft, chemicals and unspecified goods.

It’s not all good news, though - the ONS has revised down its estimate of UK 
growth in January-March to +0.3%, from +0.4%.

Growth in the second quarter of 2016 has also been trimmed, from 0.7% to 0.6%.

So, the UK economy grew just as fast in the three months after the EU 
referendum than in the three months after it.

NEWSFLASH: The UK economy grew faster than we thought in the three months 
after the Brexit referendum.

The Office for National Statistics has just revised up its estimate for UK GDP 
in the third quarter of 2016.

It now reckons that the British economy expanded by 0.6%, not the 0.5% 
previously reported. That’s a pretty decent rate of growth, especially given 
the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.

It’s because the ONS has revised up service sector growth (the largest part of 
the UK economy) in the last three months to 1.0%, from 08%.


And the City can take the credit, with output from the “business services and 
finance industries” growing faster than expected.

Darren Morgan, Head of GDP, says:

“Robust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the 
third quarter of 2016. Growth was slightly stronger than first thought, though, 
due to greater output in the financial sector.”

The ONS also says that industrial production only contracted by 0.4%, not 
0.5%, while construction sector output has been revised from -1.1% to -0.8%.
