HEEEY! It's caturday, and you know what that means: Let's watch a video!

Recently, I've been following the adventures of one of my colleagues, Alok 
Jha, as he floats aroundAntarctica

He has earned my enduring envy for doing what I've always dreamed of doing: 
visiting Antarctica. Worse, he's being a crybaby about the cold.

<https://twitter.com/iansample> Amazing. This is what you're doing while I 
freeze my bits off?

Even his own head of hair thinks he's a crybaby:

Since neither I nor any of you can visit Antarctica, I thought I'd bring 
Antarctica to you -- to your computer screens, to be exact. I thought this 
video (by one of my parrot pals!) of a baby penguin eagerly greeting its human 
care-giver might cheer you up:

Cookie is a young little penguin, Eudyptula minor, residing at the Cincinnati 
Zoo. Sharp-eyed birders in the audience will know that I lied: this species 
actually isnot found in the Antarctic -- instead, they breed along the entire 
coastline of New Zealand, on the Chatham Islands, and on the southern coast of 
Australia.

As you learned on this adorable video, this particular penguin is suffering 
from bumblefoot. In aviculture, there are two conditions known as bumblefoot: 
one is a condition where the young bird's toes develop abnormally so they point 
in weird directions, making walking, perching and swimming difficult. This 
condition can be completely resolved through the use of corrective bandages 
that make the toes grow correctly -- if it's caught early enough.

The other condition, which occurs in either young or adult birds, is a 
bacterial infection, and is more correctly known as ulcerative pododermatitis 
in veterinary medicine. In this situation, application of antibiotic ointments 
and bandages resolve this condition -- if it's caught early enough. Without 
treatment, the bird may lose its toes or even its entire foot.

Regardless of which form of bumblefoot this young penguin is suffering from, 
it appears that her condition will be completely resolved soon.
