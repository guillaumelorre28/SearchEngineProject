This is a great salad to make this time of year, as it feels a lot more fun 
than the weather outside. Slightly Spanish in feel (big beans, matched with the 
orange) this is a joy of creamy textures (avocado and beans) balanced with two 
kinds of punchy (the orange and the watercress) … and there's nothing like 
biting down on whole mint leaves to make you feel sunny.

Serves 2

2 blood oranges, or regular oranges
A big handful of watercress
1 ripe avocado, sliced into segments
1 medium carrot, grated
150g cooked butterbeans, drained
A handful of mint leaves
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
Salt and black pepper

1. Using a small sharp knife, cut the top and bottom off your oranges and sit 
them on a chopping board. Working from top to bottom, and following the shape 
of the orange, cut the peel off in sections.

2. Pick up your naked orange and, over a little bowl, cut between the white 
dividers so that the orange segments fall into the bowl. Once you have cut out 
all the segments, give the remaining pulp a good squeeze so that all the juice 
falls into the bowl.

3. Chop up the stalky ends of the watercress until you get to the leaves, and 
put both parts in a big bowl with the orange segments (but retain the juice), 
sliced avocado, grated carrot, butterbeans and mint leaves.

4. Measure out 5 tablespoons of the orange juice into a mug (you can drink any 
remaining juice) with the oil and red wine vinegar. Season, give it a quick 
whisk with a fork then spoon it over the salad. Put the salad into suitable 
lunchboxes.
