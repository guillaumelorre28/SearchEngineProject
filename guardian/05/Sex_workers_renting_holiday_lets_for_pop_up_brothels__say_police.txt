 Police are warning owners of holiday lets in the south-west of England to 
beware of sex workers using their premises as pop-up brothels.

 Devon and Cornwall police <https://www.devon-cornwall.police.uk/> said that 
in one resort alone,Newquay <http://www.visitnewquay.org/>, they had discovered 
14 such establishments since July and believed more had operated but had not 
been discovered.

 Sex workers typically hire lets for a week and advertise online for 
customers. They may use a flat, house or bungalow just for a few days as a 
brothel before packing up and moving on.

 Owners have no idea that their second homes or investment properties have 
been used in the sex trade. They often come to the attention of the police when 
neighbours report unusual activity.

 Insp Dave Meredith, sector inspector for Newquay, has concerns that sex 
workers from central and eastern Europe may have been trafficked into the UK by 
organised gangs.

 Meredith, who is the force’s lead for sex workers, said it was difficult to 
disrupt the scams. “Payments are made online for the lets and the owner often 
lives a long way away with just a cleaner coming in at the end of the week. 
These people turn up, use the let for a few days then head to the next place.”

The inspector said police treated sex workers as victims and would work with 
other agencies to make sure they were helped and cared for. He added that the 
problem was not confined to the south-west but was a national issue.

 Police have been working with hoteliers and guest-house owners to help catch 
people using their premises as brothels but it is easier for them to spot such 
operations than owners of holiday lets.

 Newquay, famous for its surfing beaches and stag and hen parties, may be 
targeted because of the number of potential customers – and the large stock of 
holiday properties.

 Meredith said: “I would ask for residents to be vigilant and to contact the 
police if they have concerns.”
