When I have my first appointment with a new client I’m usually a bit anxious, 
because I’m not sure what to expect. You don’t know whether a client is going 
to be sobbing, angry, defensive or filled with shame. Even though I’ve been a 
sex and porn addiction therapist for 25 years, I still worry whether or not I’m 
going to be competent enough to help them with their problem.

I work with what is a growing issue: there’s a huge social stigma that stops 
addicts coming out in public. I feel a lot of compassion for them and want to 
do whatever I can to make them feel more comfortable and confident in talking 
to me.

At some point, mainstream porn stopped giving addicts the same sort of 
arousal, so they escalate to more hardcore fetish stuff, and then won’t have 
sex with their partner unless they’re acting out a fantasy. Porn sites offer 
variety and novelty, which their partners just can’t compete with. I sometimes 
find I’m performing a balancing act between providing a service that’s 
beneficial to the client, and then feeling awkward when asking them to pay me 
at the end of the session.

Managing my own internal responses includes huge sadness at their loss, anger 
at the injustices that often lead to addiction, and frustration at society for 
not being more understanding. Recently, one client put it really succinctly: “I 
know most guys look at porn and I’ve not got an issue with that, but I’m a 
wanker. And no one wants to be a wanker.”
