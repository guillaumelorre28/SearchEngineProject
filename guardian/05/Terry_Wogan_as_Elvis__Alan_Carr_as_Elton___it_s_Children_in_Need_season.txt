O'Leary star as Elvis, Elton John andDavid Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> in the first of a series of 
promotional ads to support the upcoming BBC Children in Need appeal.

The first 40-second clip, which can be seen on MediaGuardian.co.uk for the 
first time and was developed by Red Bee Media, features the three celebrities 
dressed up as famous musicians. Carr is dressed as Elton John. When O'Leary 
enters a studio Carr exclaims: "Oooh! Dermot, I love Bonnie Tyler," to the 
miffed response "I'm David Bowie! Labyrinth!"

However, when the lights are turned up in the recording studio the pair are 
upstaged by Wogan doing an Elvis impersonation.

Red Bee Media has created three clips to air in the run-up to the live TV 
event, which will air on BBC1 on Friday, 20 November.

A second clip features members of the cast of EastEnders and a third Fiona 
Bruce from Antiques Roadshow. The fourth clip features Wallace & Gromit and has 
been created by Aardman Animations.

In 2008, the BBC Children in Need Appeal raised more than £36m.
