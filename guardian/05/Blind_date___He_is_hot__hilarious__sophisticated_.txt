Abolade on Sam 


What were you hoping for?
Meghan Markle.

First impressions?
Sam was dressed very nicely and had a lovely smile.

What did you talk about?
Somerset, living on the continent, and how the Guardian selects people for 
blind dates.

Any awkward moments?
I think it was an awkward-free evening.

Good table manners?
I don’t recall any mishaps.

Best thing about Sam?
Her banter was good, she didn’t take herself too seriously, and she laughs 
nearly as loudly as me.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
Yeah, why not?

Describe her in three words
Fun, adventurous, open.

What do you think she made of you?
She said that I looked younger than I am. Besides that, I’m not sure: I’m not 
very good at reading signs.

Did you go on somewhere?
It was a Monday night and it was late by the time we finished, so no.

And... did you kiss?
On both cheeks, like true continentals.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
It would have been on a Thursday.

Marks out of 10?
9.

Would you meet again?
I had a really good time and would definitely be up for meeting again.
