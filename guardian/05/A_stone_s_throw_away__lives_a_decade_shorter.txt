We should indeed “be shocked into action by the fact that wealth, class and 
geography still dictate life expectancy” (Paul Mason, G2, 1 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/30/we-need-to-be-shocked-into-action-about-why-wealth-still-dictates-life-expectancy>
). Healthy life expectancy, as he reports, is 16 years less in Blackpool than 
it is a three-hour drive away in Wokingham. It’s a 12-minute drive from where I 
live in Newcastle to the council ward I represent, where life expectancy is 12 
years less and which is served by the largest food bank in the country.

• Peter Clement (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/26/is-it-time-to-mend-fences-with-the-eu>
, 27 November), has missed Robert Frost’s irony –Mending Wall 
<https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/mending-wall> satirises the neighbour’s 
“Good fences make good neighbours” refrain. The narrator speaks against 
unthinking isolationism: “Why do they make good neighbours? ... Before I built 
a wall I’d ask to know / What I was walling in or walling out”. Born in San 
Francisco to a Scottish immigrant mother, Frost was himself a migrant to the UK 
in 1912-15 before returning to the US.

• I don’t get Jess Cartner-Morley (Wearing shades in December used to scream 
‘show-off’. But now they’re actually quite fashionable 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/30/sunglasses-winter-luxury-fashionable>
, 1 December). Wearing sunglasses in winter was, she says, a sign of 
“wankerdom”, but now it’s OK because it’s à la mode. Doesn’t she just mean that 
more people have become dedicated followers of Onan?

• Re early-flowering forsythia and snowdrops (Letters, 28

). I am bemused and delighted that a cream-coloured primrose growing up through 
the pebbles in our drive hasn’t stopped flowering for over 18 months. A photo 
of it appeared in our local newspaper last December. How much climate change 
does this signify?
