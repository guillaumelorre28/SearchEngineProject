A straw poll of favourite sarnies around friends and family with 
offspring produced a clear winner. Tuna (dolphin-friendly of course) was the 
number one base for kids, cunningly mixed here with cream cheese (which came in 
at number three, and makes for a better binder than mayo). Unsurprisingly, 
crunchy veg bits didn't feature in any child's top-five lunchbox list, but 
sometimes we just know better than them.

Serves 4

120g (½ a tin) chickpeas or kidney beans
120g (1 tin) tuna
3 heaped tbsp cream cheese
A handful of olives, sliced (optional)
Leftover bits of veg – eg peppers (red and yellow – good for colour), 
cucumber, tomato, grated carrot, lettuce etc
4 small or 2 large pittas (if you're using big ones, cut them in half)

1. Tip the chickpeas or kidney beans into a mixing bowl and mash well.

2. Add the tuna and cream cheese and mix well. If you're using olives, 
stir them in now too.

3. Warm the pittas just a little bit, so that they are easier to open up, 
but not so much that they go hard once cooled.

4. Line the pittas with a few pieces of whatever kinds of veg your kids like, 
then stuff with the tuna mixture.
