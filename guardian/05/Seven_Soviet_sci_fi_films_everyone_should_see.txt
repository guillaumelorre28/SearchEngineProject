 An extract from the film Aelita, in which an engineer builds a rocket that 
flies to Mars 
Based on Tolstoy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksey_Nikolayevich_Tolstoy>’s 
novel of the same name,Aelita  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aelita>is 
considered a classic not only of Soviet filmmaking, but of world cinema. It 
tells the story of an engineer, Los, who creates a spacecraft capable of flying 
to Mars.

Los sets out for the Red Planet in the company of Gusev, a Red Army soldier, 
and a sleuth called Kravtsov. On Mars, the trio encounters an alien humanoid 
civilisation. While Gusev plots a revolution, a love affair blossoms between 
Los and Aelita, the daughter of the Martian leader.

The novel is regarded as an original work of fiction with strong topical 
resonances. Alluding to the real-life rocket engine developerIuzef Dominikovich 
<http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://www.gulagmuseum.org/showObject.do%3Fobject%3D17163681%26language%3D2&prev=search>
, the book also features an ideological dimension,referencing the 
trans-humanist teachings ofKonstantin Tsiolkovsky

 Rocket launch and moon exploration sequence from the silent film Cosmic Voyage 
Initial attempts at a moon landing end in failure. A rabbit launched into 
space perishes en route. A second rocket, this time with a cat on board, 
vanishes without a trace. The third, manned by a small party of scientists, 
proves a success. Finally, the moon is colonised by the USSR. And on the way 
back, they even find the cat, long presumed dead, alive and well.


This naive Soviet pop sci-fi flick makes for impressive viewing even today, 
and for good reason. It is this very film that gave rise to the now standard 
practice of employing real-life scientists as on-set consultants (with 
Christopher Nolan’sInterstellar <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vxOhd4qlnA> 
being arecent example 
<http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2014/11/physicist-who-inspired-interstellar-spills-backstory-and-scene-makes-him>
 ).

The scientific aspects of Cosmic Voyage were supervised by none other than 
Soviet rocket scientistKonstantin Tsiolkovsky 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky>, who created 30 technical 
drawings <http://project.mettavant.fr/kosmicalbum.htm#top> of the spacecraft 
for the film.

 Road to the Stars mixes documentary footage and fictional drama 
A fan of the Soviet documentary-meets-sci-fi genre, it was director Pavel 
Klushantsev <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0460246/> who pioneered this hybrid, 
combining elements of pure documentary with live action fantasy .

His films juxtapose talking heads documentary and laboratory footage with 
carefully choreographed scenes set on alien-inhabited planets. Klushantsev’s 
Planet of Tempests made such an impression on US filmmakers that it ended up 
spawning two American adaptations. The first of these,Voyage to the Prehistoric 
Planet <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3xKXrmFcWc>, was produced in 1965 by 
Roger Corman; the second, actually an adapted version of Corman’s film, was 
directed by Peter Bogdanovich and released in 1968 under the titleVoyage to the 
Planet of the Prehistoric Women <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIks41gPBeU>.

According to a story that sometimes does the rounds in film circles, George 
Lucas, who regarded Klushantsev as the godfather ofStar Wars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars>, desperately wanted to meet the 
Soviet director, but ultimately the two sci-fi pioneers never crossed paths.

 Trailer for Tarkovsky’s sci-fi masterpiece Solaris 
Tarkovsky’s film tells the story of Kris Kelvin, a psychologist who has 
travelled to the space station Solaris to evaluate whether the scientific 
mission being conducted there should continue. The scientists on board the 
station have been driven to the verge of madness, and soon Kelvin finds himself 
haunted by a manifestation of his beloved, who had committed suicide back on 
earth.


Needless to say, no overview of the Soviet sci-fi tradition would be complete 
without mention of Tarkovsky and his films Solaris andStalker 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_GOpfEQUw>, both classifiable, to some 
extent, as science fiction. Like the rest of Tarkovsky’s filmography, these two 
works have received extensive analysis .Coming on the heels of the shelved
Andrei Rublev 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/andrei-rublev-tarkovsky-arthouse>
, long withheld from release by the Soviet government, Solaris enjoyed such a 
degree of success that Tarkovsky was effectively given carte blanche for any 
future projects.

American director Steven Soderbergh remade Solaris in 2002, with George 
Clooney as Kelvin . However,Soderbergh’s Solaris 
<http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/solaris/> lacks the artistic and conceptual 
power of the original.



Pilot Pirx’s Inquest (1978)

Dir: Marek Piestrak

Photograph: The Calvert Journal 
This joint Soviet-Polish production revolves around a mission to Saturn. A big 
corporation succeeds in creating humanoid robots and, paying no heed to the 
skeptics, decides to put them into mass production. A crew of robots and humans 
– headed by a captain named Pirx – is sent out into space to launch two 
satellites into Saturn’s rings. True to the finest traditions of the genre, 
things don’t go quite to plan.


Even today, this film feels contemporary – and all because its Polish director,
Marek Piestrak <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0676118/>, strived to achieve 
maximum realism. Costumes and models were devised on the basis of existing 
American and Soviet prototypes. It’s electronic soundtrack, written by 
progressive Estonian composerArvo Pärt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/jun/18/arvo-part-contemporary-music-guide>
, also feels very contemporary, and was an influence onThe Prodigy’s

Per Astra ad Aspera (1981) 

Dir: Richard Viktorov/Nikolai Viktorov
 Poster for Per Astra ad Aspera Photograph: The Calvert Journal 
The action of this film, whose Latin title translates as Through the Thorns to 
the Stars, is based on a screenplay by cult Soviet sci-fi writerKir Bulychev  
<http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/bulychev_kir>and is set in deep space . A 
reconnaissance craft – named Pushkin in homage to Russia’s greatest poet – 
encounters a derelict starship. Inside is a humanoid woman with the inhuman 
abilities of teleportation and telekinesis.


Richard Viktorov <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0897278/> directed the original 
1981 version of this film. He died soon afterwards in 1983and Viktorov’s son,
Nikolai <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0897277/>, released a new version in 2001, 
having remastered the sound and special effects and shortened the running time 
by cutting several set pieces laced with Soviet ideology.

This adaptation of the Strugatsky brothers’ <http://www.rusf.ru/abs/english/> 
novel was a long time coming, and was due to become Aleksei German Sr’s 
directorial debut. However, when Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia in 
1968, the story of how power in the city of Arkanar is seized by the “black 
brotherhood” took on an overly anti-Soviet tone. It was only in the late 1990s 
that German Sr reprised work on the film, and continued to do so until the end 
of his life. His son, directorAleksei German Jr 
<http://calvertjournal.com/news/show/3679/alexei-german-jr-wins-berlinale-award-interview-under-electric-clouds>
, put the finishing touches to the project which was released in 2013.
