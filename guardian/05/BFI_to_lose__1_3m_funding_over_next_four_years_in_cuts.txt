The British Film Institute <https://www.theguardian.com/film/bfi> (BFI) is to 
lose £1.3m of its government funding over the next four years, it has been 
announced in the2015 Autumn statement and spending review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/autumn-statement-2015>.

The BFI – which is the UK’s lead agency for film and is responsible for 
funding film production, as well as maintaining the national film archive, a 
network of cinemas including theBFI <https://www.theguardian.com/film/bfi> 
Southbank, and film education programmes – will have its grant-in-aid payment 
reduced by 8%. This is on top of a 10% reduction for the current 2015/16 
financial year.

The BFI’s grant-in-aid payment, which does not cover the production activity 
funded by lottery cash, currently stands at around £20m. It is expected to 
decline to around £18.7m by 2020.

The BFI’s CEO Amanda Nevill 
<http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/bfi-statement-spending-review-2015>
 called the decision a “better than anticipated result” in “a challenging 
financial environment”. She continued: “British film is thriving buoyed by our 
world-class talent and internationally competitive tax reliefs. The BFIs’ work 
in expanding education and skills opportunities, supporting our future 
film-makers, protecting our National Film & TV Collection and making sure we 
can all enjoy the very broadest choice of film is vital to sustain long-term 
growth.”

No announcements have yet been made as to which areas of the BFI will bear the 
brunt of the cuts.
