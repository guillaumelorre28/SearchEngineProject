Wild Coast

Swell Eco Lodge, Mngcibe
Offering a stylish and serene alternative to the sometimes rowdy backpacker 
lodges in nearby Coffee Bay, Swell Eco Lodge is a clutch of thatched rondavels 
on a grassy hillside at the mouth of the Mdumbi river, with sweeping ocean 
views. Each unit is spacious, with handmade furniture and cute, upcycled 
touches, such as plant pots and toothbrush holders made from old cans and 
jamjars. Power comes from a wind turbine, and the lodge conserves mains water 
thanks to a borehole and rainwater collection tanks. It’s a wonderfully remote 
spot – at night you’re dazzled by a dome of stars.

Bulungula Lodge, Nqileni

Bulungula is a legend among the handful of back-to-basics, mildly hippyish 
lodges scattered over the rolling green hills of the Wild Coast, a deeply rural 
region far from the main highway. Set up in partnership with the local 
community and staffed by villagers, this is an eco-lodge with integrity. Local 
youngsters fund their studies by offering tours and activities, such as 
canoeing and traditional Xhosa cooking, but there’s no fixed programme and 
definitely no hard sell – it’s up to you to make your stay your own. The rooms, 
ablutions and meals are all basic but the coastal setting is sublime.

Garden Route (East)

Tranquility B&B, Nature’s Valley
 Photograph: Picasa 
Tucked into a wide band of protected coastal forest on a pristine Indian Ocean 
beach, Nature’s Valley is one of the most secluded spots on the Garden Route. 
Tranquility is a modest but attractive B&B that has been recently revamped by 
the people who operate the bloodcurdling Bloukrans Bridge bungee jump, a 
20-minute drive away. If you’ve taken the plunge, you can spin out the buzz 
with a little gentle kayaking, surfing or stand-up paddleboarding, or go for a 
hike through the forest. There’s a pub with a popular beer garden next door.

Storms River Mouth Rest Camp, Tsitsikamma

The Tsitsikamma section of the Garden Route national park 
<http://www.sanparks.org/parks/garden_route/> includes one of the best 
stretches of coast in Eastern Cape Province to see dolphins, porpoises and, 
between June and November, migrating southern right whales. The park offers 
simple accommodation units, some perched right on the wild shore, so you can 
watch from the moment you awake. Other units are backed by luxuriant forest, 
laced with hiking trails. Set out on foot and you’re likely to catch a glimpse 
of a bushbuck antelope or a knysna lourie, a green bird with magnificent 
scarlet wing feathers.

Funky Town, Jeffreys Bay


Jeffreys Bay, nicknamed J Bay, is a surf-mad town stuffed with bright, breezy 
backpacker hostels. If you’d prefer something a little more grown up, try Funky 
Town, a super-cool pad with colour-blocked decor and lively splashes of local 
contemporary art. The rooms have mini fridges but are purposely TV-free to 
encourage guests to socialise in the shared kitchen, lounge, garden and plunge 
pool. The central location, close to J Bay’s shops, restaurants and Main Beach, 
is a real bonus, and for surf fans, there’s a clincher: Super Tubes, one of the 
world’s top breaks, is just a mile and a half up the coast.

Hibisucs Coast and Dolphin Coast

Wailana Beach Lodge, Ramsgate

The twin beach resorts of Margate and Ramsgate in KwaZulu Natal are holiday 
central, with Ramsgate the smarter of the two. At Wailana, you’re the guest of 
a Swiss expat and his wife in their large, laid-back house with a sub-tropical 
garden and a small but inviting pool. Each of the five bedrooms has a private 
balcony or sundeck; grab The Captain’s Cabin upstairs for the best views of the 
Indian Ocean. The nearest stretch of sand is just minutes from the door and 
Ramsgate’s safe and sparkling Main Beach, which has a Blue Flag and lifeguards, 
is within easy walking distance.

Chartwell Guest House, Umhlanga Rocks

About 10 miles north of central Durban, Umhlanga Rocks is a well-to-do coastal 
retreat with long, golden sands lapped by water that’s warm enough to swim in 
all year round. In a quiet residential neighbourhood close to the beach and 
within walking distance of appealing shops and restaurants, Chartwell Guest 
House offers affordable comfort in a choice of seven rooms, some of which open 
onto the garden. The owners keep things eco-friendly by being energy efficient, 
using heat pumps for hot water, irrigating with rainwater and recycling as much 
as possible.

Petite Provence, Salt Rock

Lovingly furnished in a romantic, shabby-chic style, inspired by villas in the 
south of France, Petite Provence is a boutique B&B with bags of charm and a 
small but attractive pool. Each room has polished or painted floors, softly 
draped fabrics and pretty chandeliers. As with its neighbours, the house stands 
in a garden of lush sub-tropical trees and shrubs, close to the beach. 
Breakfast on the terrace is a highlight: you can expect fresh pastries, 
croissants and homemade jam as well as perfectly cooked eggs.

Elephant Coast

St Lucia Wetlands Guest House, St Lucia

Whenever you check into a place to stay in St Lucia in KwaZulu Natal, you’re 
always warned to watch out for the hippos – they have a habit of hauling 
themselves out of the St Lucia river after dark to munch on lawns and verges. 
For the eco-tourists who are beginning to outnumber the anglers in this 
peaceful village, hippos are, of course, an attraction, as are the loggerhead 
and leatherback turtles which nest on the Indian Ocean shore. The award-winning 
St Lucia Wetlands Guest House makes an excellent base, with friendly, 
considerate hosts, a pool and five homely rooms.

Mseni Lodge, Sodwana Bay

Sodwana Bay in iSimangaliso wetland park is a magnet for scuba divers, as some 
of the world’s southernmost coral reefs are found here. While many visitors 
stay in the national park camps run byEzemvelo KZN Wildlife 
<http://www.kznwildlife.com/>, the simple timber chalets at Mseni Lodge are a 
more comfortable alternative. It’s a peaceful spot, with nothing but forest 
between you and a coral beach where turtles lay their eggs between November and 
February. There’s abraai area where you can rustle up a barbecue and a bar that 
serves meals and looks out over the treetops to the Indian Ocean.
