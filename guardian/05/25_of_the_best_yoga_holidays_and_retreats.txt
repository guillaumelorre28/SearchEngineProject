You can’t move for downward dog opportunities these days. The explosion of 
yoga in western countries means there’s a studio on every other street and such 
a variety of styles and options, that choosing a holiday or retreat can be 
overwhelming. So where to start? It makes sense to try a weekend away before 
committing to a whole week. One possibility is to choose a teacher you know or 
like the sound of and see if they’re running anything that suits. Or you could 
pick a venue you fancy and see what teachers are hosting holidays there. Think 
about what you want too – some combine yoga with other activities (maybe good 
for those with non-yogi partners), some are vegan, some don’t ban booze – it’s 
always worth asking before you book.

Most retreats will cater for all levels, with teachers listening to individual 
needs, but I’ve marked those particularly for beginners suitable with aB. We 
think all the places we’re covering here offer good value, but those that stand 
out price-wise are marked with a£.
