Talking of happy endings, that’s it for my brief toe-dip into this year’s 
Apprentice – thank you as ever for joining in and being marvellous – you can 
find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say hello. My liveblog duties 
for 2016 are now over, which must mean it’s nearly Christmas. Have a wonderful 
festive season, and I’ll see you in 2017! Hx

Am happy for Alana, she seemed really lovely. And am pretty sure someone will 
want to make Courtney’s Cuppy Cup, which would be a happy ending for everyone.

Lord Sugar picks ALANA to be his new business partner! He’s going into cake by 
Alana, even though she didn’t put the word Sugar in the brand, which was 
FOOLHARDY. Courtney looks gutted, bless him.

Time for a final pitch from the finalists. Courtney calls Alana “just a 
baker”, and she rips him a new one over profits and margins. Courtney’s 
products are niche, but everyone loves cake, says Alana.

Lord Sugar has a dilemma. Presumably because both have limited potential and 
he doesn’t really want either of them.

“Have you every come across a designer that’s got any commercial sense?” asks 
Lord Sugar. I don’t know, maybe James Dyson?

Lord Sugar loves the Cuppy Cup, but he’s worried that other people would knock 
it off. I’m guessing the motors in China are already running.

No. No they won’t.

So, will it be Cake or Cuppy Cups? I reckon it has to be Courtney, because 
Lord Sugar loves a bit of old tat.

Alana chose her team because they’re marketing experts, strong women and 
Oliver, who does food. Lord Sugar likes that Alana put her name on the product, 
because Alana is his cross-dressing alter-ego. Oh my sides.


Lord Sugar is being very complimentary and constructive. This is no fun at all.

Boardroom time! Lord Sugar is wearing a lurid Purple tie, which is a good sign 
for Courtney. Jessica, Vinnie Jones and Facial Hair made a digital billboard 
that didn’t show any products, and Monobrow was in charge of the TV ad. Lord 
Sugar and Karren were impressed with Courtney’s presentation.

 Courtney’s face has suddenly become animated, and it’s quite unsettling. He 
thinks he’s got a good chance of winning. 50/50 at least, Courtney.

So far Courtney is holding it together, but his TV ad is really bad. I mean, 
like PANTSMAN bad. The audience are laughing, and quite like his prototype 
sippy cup. He’s playing the crowd really well, and even manage to crack a few 
jokes.

Lord Sugar gets some feedback from some tycoons. They’re generally quite 
positive about Alana, I think Courtney has got a job on his hands. But still,

Alana is on first and manages about ten words before she starts crumbling like 
an overbaked brownie. She witters on a bit, then shows her cheesy video and 
flicks her hair a bit. Her nerves actually comes over as kind of humble and 
charming. I’ve seen worse.

It’s presentation time! I hope Courtney is wearing robust underwear, he looks 
terrified. Alana is having a meltdown.

Courtney asks Jessica and Facial Hair what the research reveals, and they lie 
through their teeth. Frances, Rachel and Oliver do likewise, because god forbid 
that Alana might go into this with some idea what the audience might roast her 
for.

Talking of happy endings, that’s it for my brief toe-dip into this year’s 
Apprentice – thank you as ever for joining in and being marvellous – you can 
find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say hello. My liveblog duties 
for 2016 are now over, which must mean it’s nearly Christmas. Have a wonderful 
festive season, and I’ll see you in 2017! Hx
 
Am happy for Alana, she seemed really lovely. And am pretty sure someone will 
want to make Courtney’s Cuppy Cup, which would be a happy ending for everyone.

 
Lord Sugar picks ALANA to be his new business partner! He’s going into cake by 
Alana, even though she didn’t put the word Sugar in the brand, which was 
FOOLHARDY. Courtney looks gutted, bless him.
 
Time for a final pitch from the finalists. Courtney calls Alana “just a 
baker”, and she rips him a new one over profits and margins. Courtney’s 
products are niche, but everyone loves cake, says Alana.

Lord Sugar has a dilemma. Presumably because both have limited potential and 
he doesn’t really want either of them.
 
“Have you every come across a designer that’s got any commercial sense?” asks 
Lord Sugar. I don’t know, maybe James Dyson?
 
Lord Sugar loves the Cuppy Cup, but he’s worried that other people would knock 
it off. I’m guessing the motors in China are already running.
 
Alana’s cakes are not just cakes, they’re exciting cakes, and people will buy 
into Alana and her personal brand.

No. No they won’t.
 
So, will it be Cake or Cuppy Cups? I reckon it has to be Courtney, because 
Lord Sugar loves a bit of old tat.
 
Alana chose her team because they’re marketing experts, strong women and 
Oliver, who does food. Lord Sugar likes that Alana put her name on the product, 
because Alana is his cross-dressing alter-ego. Oh my sides.


Lord Sugar is being very complimentary and constructive. This is no fun at all.
 
Boardroom time! Lord Sugar is wearing a lurid Purple tie, which is a good sign 
for Courtney. Jessica, Vinnie Jones and Facial Hair made a digital billboard 
that didn’t show any products, and Monobrow was in charge of the TV ad. Lord 
Sugar and Karren were impressed with Courtney’s presentation.
 
 Courtney’s face has suddenly become animated, and it’s quite unsettling. He 
thinks he’s got a good chance of winning. 50/50 at least, Courtney.
 
Well done Courtney, you absolutely nailed that. Although secretly I hoped for 
more of a car crash, what’s the point ofThe Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice> otherwise?
 
So far Courtney is holding it together, but his TV ad is really bad. I mean, 
like PANTSMAN bad. The audience are laughing, and quite like his prototype 
sippy cup. He’s playing the crowd really well, and even manage to crack a few 
jokes.
 
Lord Sugar gets some feedback from some tycoons. They’re generally quite 
positive about Alana, I think Courtney has got a job on his hands. But still, 
LANDFILL.
 
Alana is on first and manages about ten words before she starts crumbling like 
an overbaked brownie. She witters on a bit, then shows her cheesy video and 
flicks her hair a bit. Her nerves actually comes over as kind of humble and 
charming. I’ve seen worse.

 
I feel like I should be watching this from behind a cushion. It’s going to be 
horrible.
 
It’s presentation time! I hope Courtney is wearing robust underwear, he looks 
terrified. Alana is having a meltdown.

Courtney asks Jessica and Facial Hair what the research reveals, and they lie 
through their teeth. Frances, Rachel and Oliver do likewise, because god forbid 
that Alana might go into this with some idea what the audience might roast her 
for.
 
Jessica and Facial Hair are doing some market research on the Purple Whale 
brand. It doesn’t go well. Motivation for both finalists comes from Grainne and 
Monobrow, who sends Courtney to sleep.
