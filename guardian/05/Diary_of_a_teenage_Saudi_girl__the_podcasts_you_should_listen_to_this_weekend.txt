Majd’s diary


Majd Abdulghani has captivated podcast-lovers this week with her earnest 
account of two years of her life in Saudi Arabia (masterfully condensed into 
half an hour). Abdulghani was selected from more than 1,000 applicants to an 
NPR contest, and if you listen you’ll instantly see why. In this radio diary, 
she speaks of her dreams of becoming a scientist, and her parents’ hopes of 
arranging her marriage. She ends up going for both and embracing her decisions, 
and her journey is a pleasure to hear – with karate (“we’re this secret club, 
like Fight Club”), interviews with her family, and language anecdotes (“In 
Arabic, we call corn flakes ‘Corna Flix’”). Here’s Majd:

So here’s what happened. I met the guy who proposed to me. I don’t want to say 
his name. I’ll just refer to him as “the guy.” (I really like the fact that the 
English language has the word “guy.” You don’t have to say “boy” and you don’t 
have to say “man.” You can say “guy.”)

Come for Majd’s honesty, stay for her charisma. We can’t wait for more from her
Silent evidence

This is a podcast about intimacy, love, sex and bodies – or as they put it, 
about “the things you feel, but you don’t know how to name: the bliss and 
banality of being in love, and the wild diversity of the human heart”. Quite 
difficult to define, really – but it feels like one of those unique safe spaces 
on the internet where deeply personal stories are told in ways that we don’t 
even dare to broach in real life. Through single episodes or carefully-curated 
mini series, The Heart tackles themes as diverse askissing 
<http://www.theheartradio.org/audio-smut/last>, kinks, poo 
<http://www.theheartradio.org/audio-smut/poo> – as well as wider social issues 
like misogyny or transphobia. Here’s a taster of some of their lighter content, 
likeGhost <http://www.theheartradio.org/season2-episodes-ghost/> or Heatwave 
<http://www.theheartradio.org/heatwave-episodes/>. 

But in the last few weeks, The Heart has been sharing one woman’s story of 
childhood sexual abuse. In it, she explains what happened, why she had to 
suffer the consequences alone for 25 years, and why she finally decided to 
confront her abuser. Revealing more would spoil it, so have a listen to the 
first episode of the miniseries here:

Come for the intimacy, stay for the necessary discussions 
Stories from the Supreme Court

If anyone can make the Supreme Court sexy, it’s Radiolab 
<http://www.radiolab.org/>. In this just-launched spinoff, they dig for amazing 
stories in the US’s high federal court, and unpack them in the way only they 
know how (sassy comments and flashy sound effects included). I’ll admit the 
first episode, about the death penalty and numerous attempts to make it not 
“cruel and unusual”, made me cringe – as a non-American, I find any discussion 
of the death penalty as a humane possibility abhorrent – but it is undoubtedly 
fascinating. (You’d never expect a guy running a driving school in west London 
to be involved in supplying meds for lethal injections.) Episode two just 
dropped, abouta case known as Baker v Carr 
<http://www.wnyc.org/story/the-political-thicket> which pushed one Supreme 
Court justice to a nervous breakdown.
