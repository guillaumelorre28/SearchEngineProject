This statement covers all our significant findings regarding issues covered in 
this section of the Living our Values report to date. As we are using a rolling 
assurance process alongside the rolling publication of sections in the report, 
we may add additional findings that come to light as we investigate each 
section. All significant claims made in this section have been assured.

Last year, we commented that ensuring readers are aware of the differentiation 
between editorial and sponsored content continues to be a key challenge with 
the new business strategy. The Guardian has recently updated its guidelines and 
we look forward to these being published. In the meantime, the existing 
guidelines remain on the website together with an article on the challenges of 
sponsorship and editorial independence. We recommend the Guardian actively 
monitor readers' views through the Reader Survey to understand if this is a 
particular concern.

The Guardian has introduced carbon tracker as a tool to measure the carbon 
output of bought media and its overall marketing footprint. We look forward to 
the Guardian reporting on emissions using this tool as it becomes established.

The events team includes sustainability factors in the planning and execution 
of events. There would be benefit in formalising the approach and developing 
specific targets for reducing the sustainability impacts of events.
