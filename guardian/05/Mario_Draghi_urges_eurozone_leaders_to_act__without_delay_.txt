store managers, who typically earn a £30,000 salary – up from £28,000 in

Ryanair is to take on Airbnb – by launching the Ryanair Rooms service in 
October, offering everything from 5-star hotel rooms to hostels and spare rooms 
in private homes.

It will add at least two partners to Booking.com, currently its exclusive 
accommodation partner, Reuters reported.

Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said:

We see this as a natural progression towards Ryanair.com becoming the Amazon 
of air travel.

Catching up on corporate news… Argos has reported its strongest sales 
performance in two years as it prepares for its sale to Sainsbury’s, but also 
revealed it had set aside £30m to compensate store card customers who were 
charged “excess fees” on late payments.

It’s not a massive amount of money – at most “double-digit pounds” per 
customer.

But it’s a bit embarrassing, just before the sale of the business to 
Sainsbury’s which is expected to go through in the autumn.

George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

Given the pending takeover, the board of Sainsbury’s will probably be shaking 
their heads at the news, though in the grander scheme of things the sum 
involved is not enough to derail the deal.

On a brighter note, 4K televisions, computers and tablets sold well in the 
first quarter; washing machines and gardening equipment didn’t. You can read

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, has a take on the drop in 
10-year UK bond yields to a record low.

While all eyes have been on the EU referendum campaign, gilt yields have been 
slipping, fast.

The US Federal Reserve is backing away from interest rate rises following 
wavering employment data, and in Europe the central bank is pumping billions of 
euros into the bond market every month in the form of quantitative easing, both 
of which have served to drive yields down.

The low yield on government bonds paints a pretty pessimistic picture of the 
global economy, and suggests we are set for an extended period of low or 
negative inflation, and weak economic performance.

The question though is whether one can really trust an indicator which has 
been so heavily distorted by central bank stimulus measures.

 A year ago we were talking about Grexit, now we are talking about positive 
integration.


There are several crises around... Brexit, hopefully it will be remain but we 
await that...

US jobless claims edge lower

There were 264,000 jobless claims in the US last week, slightly down on the 
268,000 a week earlier.

It was a bigger-than-expected fall, with economists forecasting 27o,000 
claims. It was also lower than the four-week average of 269,500.

Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit record lows, while Germany’s DAX 
is the biggest faller among the major European equity markets.

Draghi’s rather gloomy comments earlier - when he appeared frustrated at the 
lack of progress on structural reforms by eurozone countries - is also weighing 
on investor sentiment.

Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, is 
speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum.

He says that while he understands structural reforms have negative 
connotations in some countries and can be politically difficult to push 
through, “we need to stand firm”.

The way to tackle long-term unemployment and reduce social exclusion is 
through structural reforms, he says.

Output growth will increasingly depend on our ability to improve productivity 
growth and investment.

The key to this is investment in “human capital” he says, partly through 
education and training.

I want reform to mean progress.

 A Trent 800 Aero engine for a Boeing 777 Aircraft 
Rolls-Royce is one of the FTSE 100’s biggest fallers, down 3.4% at 590.5p.

The chief executive of the aircraft engine maker has apparently written to 
staff warning them that the company is falling behind on deliveries.

Warren East urged his colleagues to work hard to ensure profit targets for 
this year are met,the FT reports 
<https://next.ft.com/content/c8af6ff6-2d75-11e6-a18d-a96ab29e3c95>.

He wrote:

[The] business remains in reasonable shape with opportunities and issues 
broadly balanced.

Delivery issues mean there is a lot to do in the second half and hence a 
higher risk.

East acknowledged times were tough for staff at Rolls-Royce, which issued 
issued a string of profit warnings and cut jobs. He told staff:

Right now I do know that in many parts of the organisation that discomfort is 
very real indeed … For many at the moment ‘transformation’ is simply unpleasant.

I appreciate that this is a difficult environment, difficult enough just to do 
the job, without people like me preaching about ‘pace’.

If we really want to be the Rolls-Royce of our industry we must push through 
overdue changes we all know we have to make.

NIESR: poorer families would be worst hit by Brexit costs

Katie Allen

Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the 
costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU inthis month’s referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>, a respected thinktank has 
warned.

Under a worst-case scenario some low-income households could receive as much 
as £5,542 per year less in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020, according 
to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

NIESR concludes that Brexit would knock government tax receipts and so force 
changes to tax and spending policies, assuming the government sticks to tough 
goals under George Osborne’s fiscal charter toget the public finances into 
surplus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/budget-2016-osborne-chances-of-delivering-surplus-50-50-ifs>
.

Angus Armstrong, one of the report authors, said: “Our analysis combines the 
consensus of macroeconomic forecasts with the spirit of the government’s fiscal 
charter. Based on these assumptions, our results show that a disproportionately 
large share of the costs of Brexit is likely to fall on low-income households.”

We’ve got more reaction to those better-than-expected UK trade figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/09/oil-prices-hit-eight-month-high-business-live?page=with:block-57592a0ce4b01a5ff948b0dc#block-57592a0ce4b01a5ff948b0dc>
.

Not everyone is convinced that trade will make a positive contribution to GDP 
in the second quarter.

David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce:

While the fall in the trade deficit is welcome, it still remains unacceptably 
large and is likely to be a drag on UK growth in Q2.

April’s figures also highlight the need for the government to do more to 
support exporters, including improved access to finance for companies looking 
to break into new fast-growing economies.

Martin Beck, EY ITEM Club: 

While export volumes were up 4.3% in the three months to April compared with 
the previous three months, import volumes were up by 4.6% over the same period. 
So as things stand net trade is likely to exert a drag on GDP growth in Q2, 
unless April’s apparent export strength is sustained.

The chances of this happening would appear to be relatively low. Global growth 
remains pretty subdued and sterling has regained a good chunk of its losses 
from earlier in the year, so the backdrop for exporters remains very 
challenging.

George Soros: Brexit would trigger collapse of EU

George Soros, the billionaire investor who famously helped to force the pound 
out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992, has been 
speaking about Brexit.

He told the Wall Street Journal <http://www.wsj.com/europe> that a combination 
of Brexit, problems in Greece, and the migration crisis, could result in the a 
collapse of the European Union:

If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration 
of the European Union will become practically unavoidable.

Soros added however that the recent strength in the pound was a sign that 
momentum was behind the remain camp in the referendum debate.

 I’m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the remain camp is 
getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with 
them.

Among other things, the former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, was accused of

 George Osborne has been unusually quiet, despite the strong data in recent 
days Photograph: Niall Carson/PA 
Exports grew more than imports in April, triggering a surprise fall in the 
trade in goods deficit.

The news should be a boost to George Osborne, who has long argued that the UK 
economy would do better to be more reliant on manufacturing and exports, and 
less reliant on debt-fuelled spending.

Back in 2012, the chancellor boldly set a target of doubling UK exports to £1 
trillion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/budget-osborne-exports-target-manufacturers>
. The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition 
remains.


You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade 
numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far 
nothing.

The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn’t 
explain the chancellor’s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took 
everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest 
rate in almost four years in April.

Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne 
remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.]

In Larry’s words: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jun/08/why-upbeat-uk-manufacturing-figures-have-silenced-osborne-increase-production-eu>

 In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from 
the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better 
– a lot better – than the City had been expecting and showed thefastest 
month-on-month increase in almost four years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/british-industrial-production-grows-fastest-pace-four-years-manufacturing>
.


So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength 
of the economy and the success of the government’s strategy? Sherlock Holmes 
would have had the answer. Osborne’s unusual reticence was a classic case of 
the dog that doesn’t bark.

Put simply, good economic news doesn’t really suit the chancellor at the 
present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the 
European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and 
for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking 
fright at the risk of Brexit.

Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful. Better 
weather brought consumers out in their droves in May, according to theBritish 
Retail Consortium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/high-street-sales-make-modest-rebound-helped-by-warm-weather-in-may>
. Now theOffice for National Statistics  
<https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/bulletins/indexofproduction/april2016>
has reported that industrial production was up by 2% between March and April at 
a time when the markets had expected output to be flat.

Majestic Wine <https://www.theguardian.com/business/majestic-wine> is 
introducing new share incentive plans and overhauling cash bonuses for its 213 
store managers, who typically earn a £30,000 salary – up from £28,000 in 
November – plus an annual bonus.

A cap limiting bonuses to £1,000 was scrapped in November – a first step to 
reduce the high staff turnover. You can read the full storyhere

Ryanair is to take on Airbnb – by launching the Ryanair Rooms service in 
October, offering everything from 5-star hotel rooms to hostels and spare rooms 
in private homes.

It will add at least two partners to Booking.com, currently its exclusive 
accommodation partner, Reuters reported.

Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said:

We see this as a natural progression towards Ryanair.com becoming the Amazon

Catching up on corporate news… Argos has reported its strongest sales 
performance in two years as it prepares for its sale to Sainsbury’s, but also 
revealed it had set aside £30m to compensate store card customers who were 
charged “excess fees” on late payments.

It’s not a massive amount of money – at most “double-digit pounds” per 
customer.

But it’s a bit embarrassing, just before the sale of the business to 
Sainsbury’s which is expected to go through in the autumn.

George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:

Given the pending takeover, the board of Sainsbury’s will probably be shaking 
their heads at the news, though in the grander scheme of things the sum 
involved is not enough to derail the deal.

On a brighter note, 4K televisions, computers and tablets sold well in the 
first quarter; washing machines and gardening equipment didn’t. You can read

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, has a take on the drop in 
10-year UK bond yields to a record low.

While all eyes have been on the EU referendum campaign, gilt yields have been 
slipping, fast.

The US Federal Reserve is backing away from interest rate rises following 
wavering employment data, and in Europe the central bank is pumping billions of 
euros into the bond market every month in the form of quantitative easing, both 
of which have served to drive yields down.

The low yield on government bonds paints a pretty pessimistic picture of the 
global economy, and suggests we are set for an extended period of low or 
negative inflation, and weak economic performance.

The question though is whether one can really trust an indicator which has 
been so heavily distorted by central bank stimulus measures.
 
Back at the Brussels Economic Forum, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici 
and Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotoshave both identified Brexit as a 
potential crisis facing Europe.

Moscovici:

 A year ago we were talking about Grexit, now we are talking about positive 
integration.


There are several crises around... Brexit, hopefully it will be remain but we

The jobless claims will be a relief to those investors concerned by last 
week’s shockingly weak payroll numbers.

The non-farm payrolls showed just 38,000 jobs were added in the US in in May

, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. It was the slowest rate of 
growth since September 2010.

There were 264,000 jobless claims in the US last week, slightly down on the 
268,000 a week earlier.

It was a bigger-than-expected fall, with economists forecasting 27o,000 
claims. It was also lower than the four-week average of 269,500.

Investors are selling shares and buying bonds, considered to be less risky 
assets at times of heightened uncertainty.

Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit record lows, while Germany’s DAX 
is the biggest faller among the major European equity markets.

Draghi’s rather gloomy comments earlier - when he appeared frustrated at the 
lack of progress on structural reforms by eurozone countries - is also weighing 
on investor sentiment.

 * FTSE 100: -0.9% at 6,247 
 * Germany’s DAX: -1.3% at 10,084 
 * France’s CAC: -0.9% at 4,408

 * Italy’s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 17,777  
Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, is 
speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum.

He says that while he understands structural reforms have negative 
connotations in some countries and can be politically difficult to push 
through, “we need to stand firm”.

The way to tackle long-term unemployment and reduce social exclusion is 
through structural reforms, he says.

Output growth will increasingly depend on our ability to improve productivity 
growth and investment.

The key to this is investment in “human capital” he says, partly through 
education and training.

I want reform to mean progress. 

  A Trent 800 Aero engine for a Boeing 777 Aircraft 
Rolls-Royce is one of the FTSE 100’s biggest fallers, down 3.4% at 590.5p.

The chief executive of the aircraft engine maker has apparently written to 
staff warning them that the company is falling behind on deliveries.

Warren East urged his colleagues to work hard to ensure profit targets for 
this year are met,the FT reports 
<https://next.ft.com/content/c8af6ff6-2d75-11e6-a18d-a96ab29e3c95>.

He wrote:

[The] business remains in reasonable shape with opportunities and issues 
broadly balanced.

Delivery issues mean there is a lot to do in the second half and hence a 
higher risk.

East acknowledged times were tough for staff at Rolls-Royce, which issued 
issued a string of profit warnings and cut jobs. He told staff:

Right now I do know that in many parts of the organisation that discomfort is 
very real indeed … For many at the moment ‘transformation’ is simply unpleasant.

I appreciate that this is a difficult environment, difficult enough just to do 
the job, without people like me preaching about ‘pace’.

If we really want to be the Rolls-Royce of our industry we must push through 
overdue changes we all know we have to make.
 
Catching up on some corporate news, Amazon begins fresh food deliveries in 
parts of London today.

Taking on Britain’s supermarkets, Amazon Fresh will offer more than 130,000 
groceries to homes in north and eastLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, including thousands of fresh produce, 
dairy and bakery items that the company has not previously sold in the UK.

The service is available to Amazon Prime customers, who pay a subscription in 
return for fast delivery of goods.

Ajay Kavan, vice-president of Amazon Fresh, said the key to the success of the 
service would be a combination of low prices, vast selection and fast delivery.

The Guardian’s Sarah Butler has the full story here.

Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the 
costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU inthis month’s referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>, a respected thinktank has 
warned.

Under a worst-case scenario some low-income households could receive as much 
as £5,542 per year less in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020, according 
to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

NIESR concludes that Brexit would knock government tax receipts and so force 
changes to tax and spending policies, assuming the government sticks to tough 
goals under George Osborne’s fiscal charter toget the public finances into 
surplus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/budget-2016-osborne-chances-of-delivering-surplus-50-50-ifs>
.

Angus Armstrong, one of the report authors, said: “Our analysis combines the 
consensus of macroeconomic forecasts with the spirit of the government’s fiscal 
charter. Based on these assumptions, our results show that a disproportionately 
large share of the costs of Brexit is likely to fall on low-income households.”

We’ve got more reaction to those better-than-expected UK trade figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/09/oil-prices-hit-eight-month-high-business-live?page=with:block-57592a0ce4b01a5ff948b0dc#block-57592a0ce4b01a5ff948b0dc>
.

Not everyone is convinced that trade will make a positive contribution to GDP 
in the second quarter.

David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce:

While the fall in the trade deficit is welcome, it still remains unacceptably 
large and is likely to be a drag on UK growth in Q2.

April’s figures also highlight the need for the government to do more to 
support exporters, including improved access to finance for companies looking 
to break into new fast-growing economies.

Martin Beck, EY ITEM Club: 

While export volumes were up 4.3% in the three months to April compared with 
the previous three months, import volumes were up by 4.6% over the same period. 
So as things stand net trade is likely to exert a drag on GDP growth in Q2, 
unless April’s apparent export strength is sustained.

The chances of this happening would appear to be relatively low. Global growth 
remains pretty subdued and sterling has regained a good chunk of its losses 
from earlier in the year, so the backdrop for exporters remains very 
challenging.
 
George Soros, the billionaire investor who famously helped to force the pound 
out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992, has been 
speaking about Brexit.

He told the Wall Street Journal <http://www.wsj.com/europe> that a combination 
of Brexit, problems in Greece, and the migration crisis, could result in the a 
collapse of the European Union:

If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration 
of the European Union will become practically unavoidable.

Soros added however that the recent strength in the pound was a sign that 
momentum was behind the remain camp in the referendum debate.

 I’m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the remain camp is 
getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with 
them.
 
Turning to other events, there has been more reaction to Wednesday’s shock 
sessions on BHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-inquiry-hears-of-theft-and-death-threats-in-dramatic-day-of-testimony>
, where MP’s quizzed key members of the BHS team about the collapse of the high 
street retailer.

Among other things, the former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, was accused of 
threatening to kill the retailer’s chief executive, Darren Topp.
 Agatha Christie 
When asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether he was surprised by the 
testimony, Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of 
Directors got it spot on:

“Absolutely. Who needs Agatha Christie when you have Mr Chappell and the BHS 
management team yesterday.”

days Photograph: Niall Carson/PA 
Exports grew more than imports in April, triggering a surprise fall in the 
trade in goods deficit.

The news should be a boost to George Osborne, who has long argued that the UK 
economy would do better to be more reliant on manufacturing and exports, and 
less reliant on debt-fuelled spending.

Back in 2012, the chancellor boldly set a target of doubling UK exports to £1 
trillion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/budget-osborne-exports-target-manufacturers>
. The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition 
remains.


You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade 
numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far 
nothing.

The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn’t 
explain the chancellor’s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took 
everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest 
rate in almost four years in April.

Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne 
remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.]

In Larry’s words: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jun/08/why-upbeat-uk-manufacturing-figures-have-silenced-osborne-increase-production-eu>

 In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from 
the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better 
– a lot better – than the City had been expecting and showed thefastest 
month-on-month increase in almost four years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/british-industrial-production-grows-fastest-pace-four-years-manufacturing>
.


So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength 
of the economy and the success of the government’s strategy? Sherlock Holmes 
would have had the answer. Osborne’s unusual reticence was a classic case of 
the dog that doesn’t bark.

Put simply, good economic news doesn’t really suit the chancellor at the 
present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the 
European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and 
for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking 
fright at the risk of Brexit.

Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful. Better 
weather brought consumers out in their droves in May, according to theBritish 
Retail Consortium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/high-street-sales-make-modest-rebound-helped-by-warm-weather-in-may>
. Now theOffice for National Statistics  
<https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/bulletins/indexofproduction/april2016>
has reported that industrial production was up by 2% between March and April at 
a time when the markets had expected output to be flat.
