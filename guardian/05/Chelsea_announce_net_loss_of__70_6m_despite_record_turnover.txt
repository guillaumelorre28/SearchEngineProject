Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have announced a net 
loss of £70.6m for the financial year ending 30 June 2016, with the deficit 
born of the Premier League leaders’ decision to buy out their existing kit deal 
with Adidas and the compensation paid to José Mourinho following his sacking 
last December.

The club registered a record turnover of £329.1m, up 5% on the previous year’s 
£314.3m, and yet their overall profit of £4.7m was eclipsed when exceptional 
costs were taken into account.Mourinho and his coaching staff were dismissed

few months after signing new terms, with the team struggling near the fringes 
of the relegation zone, and considerable compensation was due to Adidas for the 
early termination of that contract.

Despite the lack of Champions League football this season following a 
10th-place finish in 2015-16, next year’s figures will be boosted by the record 
£60m-a-season deal since signed with Nike, together with increased revenues 
from Premier League broadcast deals.

“The fact Chelsea Football Club recorded our highest revenues in a season when 
on-pitch performance was disappointing is a credit to our hard-working, 
dedicated staff and the robust business they have helped build,” the chairman, 
Bruce Buck, said. “It has long been our aim for the business to be stable 
independent of the team’s results and we continue to reinforce that.”
