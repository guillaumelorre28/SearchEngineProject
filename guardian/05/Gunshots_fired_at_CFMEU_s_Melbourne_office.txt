At least four shots have been fired at the CFMEU’s Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> headquarters, shattering 
the front door and piercing upper level windows.

A car pulled up outside the Swanston Street offices in Carlton just after 3am 
on Wednesday and witnesses saw a man get out, fire a gun and drive away.

CFMEU state secretary John Setka said staff had been told about the attack on 
their workplace.

“We tell them some moron’s fired shots at the building and endangered all of 
Melbourne. I mean, what else can you tell them?” he told 3AW on Wednesday. “You 
got that idiot out there that you can never stop.”

Detective Sergeant Haydn Beale said police were speaking to witnesses and 
looking for CCTV of the “concerning and dangerous” attack.

“This end of town is a little difficult I suppose, it’s sort of the bottom end 
of town, there’s probably not as much CCTV as there is in the heart of the 
city,” Det Sgt Beale told reporters.

Det Sgt Beale said the community was not at risk from the gunman.

“This is obviously a fairly specifically targeted type situation,” he said. “A 
person has come here with a specific reason and specific intent.”

Setka said he didn’t know why the office had been targeted.

“We all have our disputes, we all have our squabbles here and there, but you 
don’t resolve it using guns, I mean, we never have,” he told 3AW. “I don’t know 
why they’ve resorted to this.”

Police are yet to determine what type of car and gun was used in the attack.
