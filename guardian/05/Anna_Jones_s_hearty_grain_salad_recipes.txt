I am writing from a cabin in the hills of north Wales. I’m looking out over a 
meadow, and it’s so hot there is a haze hovering just above the long grasses. 
The air is dense and filled with the smell of the grasslands, which roll down 
into the valley in front of the cabin. It’s the kind of weather that I dream of 
all winter. All I want to eat is a cold, fresh salad with a hit of citrus and 
spikes of chilli, washed down with an ice-cold beer or rosé.

But, leaves won’t quite fill us up after a day walking in the hills and 
jumping in the sea. So it’s grain salads I’ve been packing into pots and taking 
to the beach, along with punnets of cherries and strawberries ...

Wholegrains make up a big part of my cooking. Like fruit and veg, I vary them 
as much as possible to derive the maximum amount of pleasure, interest, flavour 
and nutrients from my food. At home, I like to cook them in big batches and 
have them close at hand in my fridge or freezer. These two salads centre around 
an old favourite – brown rice – and a more unusual grain – freekeh.

Crispy rice salad

This is an amazing salad based on one I ate at Sqirl, an incredible 
neighbourhood cafe in LA. It is one of those places where you want every single 
thing on the menu, right down to the drinks. On my last trip to LA, I ate there 
five times. This is a play on what was my favourite thing on the menu.

This recipe requires you to cook your rice three times, which may seem 
labour-intensive for a salad, but it’ll create perfect little pops of crunch 
against the rest of the salad. This is a great way to use up leftover rice too 
– just skip the first cooking stage. It’s also really good topped with a softly 
poached egg, or some feta and flatbreads if you are hungry.

Serves 2-4
100g basmati rice (I use brown) 
300g spring greens 
Zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon
Salt and black pepper
3 spring onions
2 tbsp coconut oil
6 medjool dates

 For the dressing
Zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lime 
1 tbsp sumac (optional) 
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tsp runny honey

1 Cook the rice in a small saucepan of boiling salted water until tender – 
this will take around 10–15 minutes for white basmati and 20-25 for brown.

2 Meanwhile, pull the spring green leaves from their stems. Shred them with a 
knife, or tear them into small pieces with your hands. Put the leaves into a 
bowl, then add the zest and juice of the lemon and a good pinch of salt. 
Scrunch it in your hands for a minute to break it down a little. Chop the 
spring onions finely and add them to the bowl.

3 Once the rice is cooked, drain it well. Put a large frying pan on the heat 
and, when it’s hot, add the rice with no oil and dry-fry for 2 minutes to get 
rid of any moisture.

4 Remove the rice from the pan, then put the pan back on the heat, add half 
the coconut oil at a time and fry the rice again in two batches until it starts 
to turn light brown and really crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with 
salt.

5 Now, make your dressing. Put the zest and juice of the lime into a screwtop 
jar with the sumac, if using, and 2 tbsp olive oil. Add the honey and a pinch 
of salt and pepper. Put on the lid and shake to combine.

6 De-stone and roughly chop the dates, then add them to the greens. Once the 
rice is almost cool, add it to the spring greens and toss it all in the 
dressing.

 Freekeh salad Photograph: i for the Guardian 
Warm fennel, green olive and herb freekeh

Freekeh is a kind of green wheat, harvested just before it’s ripe. It’s 
sun-dried and then set on fire, so the chaff burns but the seeds themselves 
remain. The wheat is then threshed and rubbed, hence its name (which means 
“rubbed”). It adds texture and substance to a salad, and a nutty, smoky taste, 
but you can use it for sweet dishes too. In Lebanon, it is sometimes eaten for 
breakfast in place of porridge.

Here the freekeh is tossed with roasted fennel and leeks and big fat green 
olives, chopped with green herbs, to make a vibrant dressing. It all comes 
together to make a hearty, but bright, lunch or supper. It also tastes amazing 
the next day.

Serves 4 
200g freekeh 
2 fennel bulbs, trimmed and thinly sliced, leafy tops reserved to garnish 
2 leeks, washed and thinly sliced
2 courgettes, sliced
4 garlic cloves, peeled
1 tbsp coriander seeds
Salt and black pepper
Extra virgin olive oil
A splash of herb or white wine vinegar 
A small bunch each of mint, coriander and flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
150g green olives, rinsed then pitted
6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
100g almonds, toasted and chopped
1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and roughly chopped
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste 
1 bunch of fresh parsley or basil
1 tbsp pul biber (crushed red pepper flakes) or ½ tsp red chilli flakes


1 Soak the freekeh in cold water for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 
180C/350F/gas mark 4.

2 Put the fennel, leeks, courgette and garlic on a baking tray in one layer if 
you can – use 2 trays if you have to. Sprinkle over the coriander seeds and a 
good amount of salt and black pepper, then drizzle with olive oil. Roast in the 
oven for 20-30 minutes, removing the trays from the oven and carefully shaking 
them every now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp 
around the edges.

3 Sprinkle the vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the 
oven, then set aside to cool. When cool, scatter the finely chopped herbs over 
the top.

4 Drain the soaked freekeh and add to a saucepan with 750ml cold water and ½ 
tsp salt. Put on a medium heat, cover and bring to a boil, then lower the heat 
to simmer it gently for about 12 minutes. Cook until tender, but not so long 
that the grains become mushy. Drain off any extra water, and set aside to cool.

5 Coarsely chop the olives and put them in a bowl along with the olive oil, 
almonds, chopped fresh chilli, and lemon juice. Stir well and set aside until 
ready to serve the salad.

6 Combine the roasted veg, freekeh, pul biber and olive mixture in a bowl and 
mix well. Taste and adjust with salt, lemon juice or olive oil, if needed. 
Garnish with the fennel tops.
