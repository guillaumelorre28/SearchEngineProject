 Hello, darkness, my old friend.
 Hello. Can I help you with something? 

 I've come to talk with you again.
 Do I know you? 

 Because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping.
 Don't make me use the CS canister. 

 And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains, within the sound 
[pause] of silence.
 That last bit sounds familiar. Reminds me of my days in the Woodcraft Folk 

 It's by Simon and Garfunkel

 Oh, yes. Whatever happened to them?

 They broke up 33 years ago.
 Shame. 

 But now they're reuniting. 
 Made up, have they? 

 No, but the prospect of a tour which could earn them a "nine-figure sum" has 
reportedly initiated a thaw in their icy relationship.
 A bit of a bridge over troubled water, eh? 

 If you must. In any case, they are slated to perform at the Grammys on 
Sunday, after receiving a lifetime achievement award.
 Lifetime? They've spent most of it not speaking to each other. 

 True, but they met in primary school. As Tom and Jerry, the duo made their 
first appearance on US TV in 1957, performing their smash No 54 hit Hey 
Schoolgirl. 
 And they really haven't sung together for 33 years? 

 They did link up briefly to record My Little Town in 1975. Then they did that 
big concert in Central Park in 1981. Oh yes, and they performed together at 
their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. And no doubt 
you'll remember their 1993 tour.
 So they actually get back together the whole time. 

 Yes. But they also split up a lot. 
 Tell me a little known fact about Simon. 

 He's up for an Oscar for a song he wrote for the Wild Thornberrys movie. 
 And Garfunkel? 

 He's got a solo album out. I forget what it's called. 
 Not to worry.
