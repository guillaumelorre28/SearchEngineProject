Quote of the week

Sepp – launching his new picture-led book Mission and Passion Football 
<http://www.weberverlag.ch/b%C3%BCcher/r%C3%BCckblicke-erfahrungen/sepp-blatter-mission-passion-fussball/>
 in Zurich as the story of “how I suffered, just likeThe Passion of Christ. But 
I don’t suffer any more because my conscience is clean. I’ve done nothing 
wrong.”

• Blatter’s previous best Jesus parallel: April 2015 – enjoying being defended 
at the Concacaf conference by Osiris Guzman, head of the Dominican Republic FA 
– whose offices wereraided by FBI‑linked investigators 
<http://www.7dias.com.do/deportes/2016/03/17/i207243_allanamiento-fedofutbol-estaria-vinculado-investigaciones-del-fbi.html#.Vxsh1PkrKUl>
 last month: “Jesus Christ, Mandela, Churchill, Moses, Lincoln, Luther King, 
Joseph Blatter.What are the differences between these men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/17/sepp-blatter-hailed-jesus-christ-nelson-mandela-fifa-concacaf>
?” Guzman denies wrongdoing.

• Meanwhile – leading the Concacaf headlines last week: former president 
Jeffrey Webb, describing in newly released court transcripts [pdf] 
<http://globalinvestigationsreview.com/digital_assets/6428e2de-ef83-440a-93ce-04b5b77132c1/Jeffrey-Webb.pdf>
 how he devoted his reign to “enriching myself by various means”. Webb took the 
presidency in 2012, pledging to draw a line under the “shameful” Jack Warner 
era: “Our past will never be repeated.We must move the clouds, and let the 
sunshine in 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-concacaf-idUKL4E8GN6PE20120523>.”

Swings and roundabouts

Assessing Qatar last week: a) Fifa head Gianni Infantino, touring the Khalifa 
Stadium and revealing he “cannot see any reason” for Qatar to be stripped of 
the 2022 World Cup: “Of course it will take place in Qatar 
<https://twitter.com/richardajkeys/status/723160396455141376?lang=en-gb>.” And 
b) Deepak, metal worker at the Khalifa Stadium, talking to Amnesty 
<https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/03/qatar-world-cup-of-shame/>
: “My life here is like a prison. The manager said: ‘If you want to stay in 
Qatar be quiet, and keep working.’”

And elsewhere

Last week’s other governance news: 
• Nigeria’s FA - still being run by two rival presidents, one backed by Fifa, 
the other by the courts -appointing a dead referee to officiate a top-flight 
game <http://sunnewsonline.com/giwas-nff-unleashes-dead-ref-on-warri-wolves/>. 
Reports say FA officials “failed to note” his death in January.

• Italy FA head Carlo Tavecchio, convicted five times since 1970 
<http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/07/28/caso-tavecchio-e-ora-che-venga-messo-da-parte/1074125/>
 for forgery, tax evasion and abuse of office, lamenting the country’s crowd 
violence problem. “It’s huge. Italy lacks what I’d call sporting culture and 
adherence to rules.”

Plus: zero tolerance
