In the early years of Michael O'Leary's reign as Ryanair's chief executive 
Wednesday's ruling by the European commission on airport charges would have 
been a serious blow. Brussels confirmed that the budget airline must repay €10m 
(£8m) in state aid that it received for operating from three French regional 
airports. There was the usual bluster fromRyanair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair> in response, describing the 
decision as "erroneous".

But this ruling relates to a bygone era, when O'Leary probably would have 
appended his name to the press release railing at the decision just to get a 
few more headlines. Instead, O'Leary maintained the media purdah that he has 
imposed while the airline repairs its antagonistic image.

Flying to remote destinations was once a key part of Ryanair's business model. 
It hoovered up customers with the cheapest fares, made possible by a 
cheap-as-chips cost base underpinned by acquiring aircraft in bulk and 
journeying to airports that were willing to subsidise such a prestigious 
customer.

That no longer holds. With costs such as fuel and taxes placing an ever 
increasing burden on airlines, Ryanair needs to charge higher fares. It can't 
increase ticket prices for minor airports, so now we are seeing Ryanair set up 
new bases in airports such as Glasgow International. Referring to the airport 
deals that drew the ire of Brussels, Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, says: 
"Those deals for out-of-the-way airports are forming a smaller part of 
Ryanair's network development now."

Ryanair has moved on.
