You can freeze these fresh and zingy tortillas and take them out as you need 
them. If you've got a microwave at work, these also blast very well.

Serves 2

1 tin black beans, drained
½ tsp ground cumin
½ tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried chilli flakes, or a fresh chilli, chopped
2 spring onions, sliced
1 pepper, chopped small
80g cheddar, grated
4 large (25cm) flour tortillas
2 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil
A small handful of pumpkin seeds
1 handful of coriander
1 ripe avocado, cut into rough chunks
½ a lime
Salt and black pepper

1. Mix the black beans, cumin, oregano, chilli, spring onions, pepper and 
grated cheese together in a bowl. Season well, then scrunch it all together in 
your hands for a couple of minutes, breaking up the beans as you go.

2. Put a frying pan big enough to hold a tortilla on a low–medium heat. Pour 
half the oil into the pan and leave it to heat up. Meanwhile, lay all the 
tortillas out, halve the bean mixture between two tortillas and spread it out 
to within 1cm of the edge. Sit the other tortillas on top and gently compress 
to make the quesadillas.

3. Flop the first quesadilla into the pan. Cook for 3–4 minutes on each side, 
pushing down from time to time with a spatula. Flip the quesadilla over and 
cook the other side, then turn it out and repeat with the other quesadilla, 
adding a splash more oil in between.

4. When you have lifted out the second quesadilla, throw the pumpkin seeds 
into the pan for one minute. Toast until golden, then tip them on to a plate to 
cool. While they're cooling, toss together the coriander, avocado chunks, juice 
of half a lime and a pinch of salt in a small bowl, then add the pumpkin seeds.

5. Cut your quesadillas into six and finish with a scattering of the dressed 
coriander, avocado and pumpkin seeds on top.
