Afternoon summary

 * Donald Tusk has accused dozens of Conservative MPs of making an argument 
that “has nothing to do with reality” in an astonishing row over the rights of 
EU citizens living in the UK and British people living overseas.

 * Theresa May and Donald Trump have spoken on the phone, agreeing they will 
meet “at the earliest possible opportunity”.(See 5.27pm.)

 * European leaders have dismissed two planks of the UK government’s apparent 
Brexit strategy, ruling out a transitional arrangement bridging the gap between 
the Britain’s departure and a final UK-EU trade pact, and reportedly quashing 
hopes for an early reciprocal rights deal for EU citizens in the UK and British 
citizens in Europe.

 * Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has strong support from her 
electorate to to take a tough line with the UK over Brexit, according to a new 
survey.

 * Labour has said the government’s plans to reform corporate governance would 
not have stopped the scandals that took place at BHS and Sports Direct.Speaking 
in the Commons as the government published its corporate governance green paper
Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: 
Bringing private companies into the PLC rule book strikes one as a move so 
targeted at a particular series of events, that it will, I expect, come to be 
known as the BHS law. But had the proposals outlined today by the secretary of 
state been in place six months ago, I’m not wholly convinced that we would have 
avoided the corporate governance scandals that have plagued the last summer. To 
force private companies to abide by the corporate governance code will do 
little unless that code is tightened. BHS may have been a private company, but 
Sports Direct isn’t, and we all know what has gone on there.

 * Jeremy Corbyn has rejected pleas from Labour MPs to force the party to 
oppose a controversial motion attacking Tony Blair over Iraq, Huffington Post 
reports.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

May and Trump agree to meet 'at the earliest possible opportunity'

Theresa May spoke to Donald Trump this afternoon. This is what Number 10 is 
saying about their calls. A spokesman said:

The prime minister called the US president-elect this afternoon as part of 
establishing a regular dialogue between both of them.

They discussed how the president-elect’s transition plans were progressing and 
agreed that their teams should continue to build close relationships through 
this period, including with a meeting of their national security advisers in 
the United States before Christmas.

They discussed NATO, agreeing on the importance of the alliance, the need for 
more NATO members to meet the target of spending 2% of GDP and the role that 
NATO can play in addressing diverse threats.

They agreed to stay in close touch and to meet at the earliest possible 
opportunity.

And here are the key lines.

 * May and Trump agree to meet “at the earliest possible opportunity”. 
 * British national security chiefs to meet Trump’s advisers before Christmas.

Here is an extract from the letter sent to Donald Tusk. According to the 
Independent 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-britons-abroad-eu-rights-donald-tusk-a7442731.html>
, it was backed by 80 parliamentarians, including 70 Tory MPs.

They told Tusk:

We warmly welcome the news that individual member states are working with the 
prime minister and Her Majesty’s government to resolve the status of EU 
citizens in the UK and our citizens living and working in Europe, but we are 
extremely concerned that members of the commission - particularly commissioner 
[Michel] Barnier - seem worryingly indifferent to securing reciprocal rights 
for our and your resident citizens.

His attempts to prevent negotiations taking place on this issue between the 
democratically-elected governments of EU member states are making it harder to 
achieve what is in everyone’s interest: ending the anxiety and uncertainty for 
UK and EU citizens living in one another’s territories.

It is the only just and humane thing to do and anything else would be unworthy 
of Europe’s common values.

People are not bargaining chips. Human beings are not cards to be traded ‘tit 
for tat’ in a political playground.

Here is the key paragraph from Tusk’s letter. 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/11/29-tusk-letter-uk-mps/>

In your letter you state that the European Commission, and in particular Mr 
Barnier, are attempting to prevent negotiations, thereby creating ‘anxiety and 
uncertainty for the UK and EU citizens living in one another’s territories.’ It 
is a very interesting argument, the only problem being that it has nothing to 
do with reality. Would you not agree that the only source of anxiety and 
uncertainty is rather the decision on Brexit? And that the only way to dispel 
the fears and doubts of all the citizens concerned is the quickest possible 
start of the negotiations based on Art. 50 of the Treaty?

EU chief says Britain to blame for "anxiety' afflicting EU nationals in UK

Donald Tusk, president of the European council, has published a remarkably 
scathing, and even in parts sarcastic, letter he has sent to around 80 MPs 
criticising Britain’s stance on Brexit.

The MPs, led by the Conservatives Michael Tomlinson and Steve Baker, said in 
their own letter to Tusk 
<http://news.sky.com/story/britons-in-eu-must-have-rights-protected-mps-tell-donald-tusk-10675183>
 that the EU’s refusal to start talks on the status of EU nationals living in 
the UK, and Britons living in Europe, was creating “anxiety and uncertainty”.

Tusk says that it was the vote for Brexit that is creating this uncertainty. 
And he says that, if Britain wants this matter resolved, it could invoke 
article 50, allowing the Brexit talks to starts.

He tells the MPs that their argument has “nothing to do with reality”.

His words are unusually blunt for a letter of this kind. It gives a revealing 
insight into quite how frustrated some EU leaders are getting with Britain’s 
refusal to commence Brexit talks.

Kate Bush says Theresa May is 'wonderful' and 'very intelligent'

And, while we’re on the subject of music, May has received a glowing 
endorsement fromKate Bush. In an interview with Macleans, 
<http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/in-conversation-with-kate-bush/> a 
Canadian magazine, Bush said:

We have a female prime minister here in the UK. I actually really like her and 
think she’s wonderful. I think it’s the best thing that’s happened to us in a 
long time. She’s a very intelligent woman but I don’t see much to fear. I will 
say it is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She’s very sensible 
and I think that’s a good thing at this point in time.

Back to Ukip, and the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope has been interviewing Paul 
Nuttall,the new Ukip leader. It turns out that Nuttall has something in common 
with David Cameron; he’s a Smiths fan.
Christopher Hope (@christopherhope) 
Paul Nuttall's favourite song is This Charming Man by Manchester 1980s band 
The Smiths, and his preferred EU holiday destination is Spain.

He also has something in common with Theresa May. They are both admirers of 
the Liberal Unionist statesmanJoseph Chamberlain.

Michael Gove used to spend his life reorganising schools, managing Tory MPs, 
trying to reform prisons and orchestrating the departure of the UK from the 
European Union. Now, though, he is a mere backbencher and it seems he has 
nothing better to do with his afternoon thanspend it on Twitter.

It turns out he can use emojis. This is what he tagged on a tweet from me

Ukip rejects plan to invoke article 50, saying that would fudge Brexit

In a statement marking his appointment as Ukip’s new Brexit spokesman Gerard 
Battensaid Ukip did not want the government to invoke article 50, the measure 
that starts the two-year EU withdrawal process. That could delay, or water 
down, withdrawal, he claimed. Instead he said Ukip wanted the government to 
just repeal the European Communities Act as quickly as possible. He said:

Theresa May and her Tory government cannot be trusted to deliver our 
withdrawal from the EU. She was a remainer who heads a predominantly remain 
government.

If she were genuine about delivering Brexit she would have triggered article 
50 the moment she became prime minister. Instead nothing has been done in the 
last five months, and there are no plans for the next four. Then we will face 
at least another two years of protracted negotiations. Under article 50 they 
could be extended for years to come.

Mrs May’s strategy is to delay and delay the whole process in order to fudge 
it and to try and foist on us a ‘Norwegian or Swiss’-type EU model whereby we 
continue to pay money to the EU, obey a large percentage of its laws, and have 
open borders. In which case we would not have left theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> at all.

Ukip’s policy will be to reject article 50. Rather, we will call for 
parliament to repeal the European Communities Act (1972) immediately as the 
first step in the process: this will restore law-making supremacy to the UK 
parliament and put the British government in the driving seat of negotiations 
not the EU.

John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has put out a statement criticising 
Philip Hammond for refusing to commit to keeping the triple lock into the next 
parliament. (See1.12pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/29/tories-have-16-pt-lead-over-labour-and-highest-vote-share-for-7-years-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-583d7749e4b015a427f75cb5#block-583d7749e4b015a427f75cb5>
McDonnell said:

The chancellor’s refusal again today to commit to the triple lock in the next 
parliament, only further proves that the Tories are abandoning older people.

After six wasted years of Tory failure, we already have a social care system 
close to collapse, and a National Health Service that has been cut to the bone.

Hammond’s refusal once again to provide pensioners with the reassurances over 
the triple lock will only add to the worries of people in their older age.

Labour is committed to supporting older people, and ensuring they have a 
secure and sustainable retirement.Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> will support the pensions triple 
lock and instead of cutting taxes for the super-rich and giant corporations 
will make sure our NHS and social care is properly funded.

Today’s Guardian/ICM poll tables (pdf) 
<https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016_nov2_guardian_poll.pdf>
 show why Labour is so keen to improve its offer to pensioners. Amongst 
over-65s the Tories are ahead of Labour by 60% to 18%. And, amongst the 
over-75s, their lead is even higher - 67% to 12%. These figures, of course, are 
based on a sub-sample of the poll, meaning that they are much less reliable 
than the headline poll figures. But, even allowing for a colossal margin of 
error, they are not great for Labour.

As the Herald reports, the SNP spent less on their EU referendum campaign than 
they did fighting the Glenrothes byelection in 2008. 
<http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14934241.SNP_spent_less_on_EU_vote_than_it_did_fighting_a_by_election_in_Glenrothes/>
 Commenting on this, the Scottish Conservative MSPMurdo Fraser said:

The SNP is behaving like leaving the EU is the end of the world for Scotland. 
But the party’s pitiful investment in the campaign tells another story 
completely.

The SNP is not a poor organisation, yet it treated the EU referendum like it 
was a council by-election.

Now we know Alex Neil and other senior SNP figures wanted Brexit, perhaps that 
explains why such little effort and cash was invested.

Scottish opposition parties have questioned the depth of Sturgeon’s commitment 
to keeping the UK in the EU after it emerged the Scottish National party spent 
just £90,830 on its referendum campaign – less than the Sun newspaper and less 
than its spending on byelections. It had a legal spending limit of £700,000.

The disclosure follows the Scottish government’s admission at the time of the 
referendum that it had not publicised, press released or printed its official 
brochure urging a remain vote in the referendum: the document was put online 
without any fanfare in April.

Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said the figure “reveals the low 
priority that they gave the referendum. They hardly lifted a finger during the 
referendum.” He said the SNP could only redeem herself by battling against 
Brexit.

An SNP spokesman said that attack was ridiculous: Scottish voters had 
overwhelmingly backed the remain vote, by 62% to 38%, and SNP leaders including 
Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond had campaigned vigorously for the EU.

EU states 'increasingly fed up' with not knowing UK's Brexit plans, MSPs told

Libby Brooks

The Scottish government’s Brexit minister Michael Russell has warned that the 
UK government’s incoherent approach to Brexit is resulting in an increasingly 
hardline attitude in Europe.

Giving evidence to a Holyrood committee on Tuesday morning, Russell said: 

The European view is hardline and it’s getting harder. They are increasingly 
fed up with not understanding what’s going on and hearing things which, in the 
words of the Dutch foreign minister about Boris Johnson, are intellectually 
incoherent and there’s no doubt that that’s true.

Speaking as first minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Irish senate that the 
option of a second independence referendum remained “firmly on the table”, 
Russell confirmed her position that the Scottish government was “ruling 
absolutely nothing out”.

Russell said that the Scottish government would publish over the next few 
weeks a paper which will outline what are “the options that exist at this time” 
for Scotland.

They lie broadly in three areas: the undifferentiated option of leaving the EU 
in exactly that same way as the UK intends to leaves. At the other end of the 
spectrum is the possibility that we will not be able to find any other adequate 
solution but to go forward with another independence referendum and give the 
people of Scotland the choice.

In the middle are a range of differentiated options and the success of those 
will depend on the willingness of the UK government to include those in their 
negotiating position.

Russell added that there are currently almost 30 sub-state arrangements within 
the EU, and noted that Sturgeon herself had confirmed last week that a 
Norway-style model was being considered.

But Russell went on to caution: “The key to this will lie in the willingness 
of the UK to fold into their negotiating position deals and opportunities which 
exist for other parts of the UK.” For example, he said that it had been made 
clear at last Friday’s meeting of the British-Irish Council that “there must be 
a commitment ... that there has to be a deal for Ireland as an island that does 
not have a hard border”.

Russell also pointed out that Brexit is not the only thing happening in the 
EU, and that the union is facing a number of challenges currently. Terms like 
“impossible” should not be used at this time, he said.


I genuinely do not believe that anything is unlikely or impossible because the 
EU has always been flexible but these are extraordinary circumstances and we 
have to continue to talk about them.

 * Labour has said the government’s plans to reform corporate governance would 
not have stopped the scandals that took place at BHS and Sports Direct.Speaking 
in the Commons as the government published its corporate governance green paper
Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: 
Bringing private companies into the PLC rule book strikes one as a move so 
targeted at a particular series of events, that it will, I expect, come to be 
known as the BHS law. But had the proposals outlined today by the secretary of 
state been in place six months ago, I’m not wholly convinced that we would have 
avoided the corporate governance scandals that have plagued the last summer. To 
force private companies to abide by the corporate governance code will do 
little unless that code is tightened. BHS may have been a private company, but 
Sports Direct isn’t, and we all know what has gone on there.

Theresa May spoke to Donald Trump this afternoon. This is what Number 10 is 
saying about their calls. A spokesman said:

The prime minister called the US president-elect this afternoon as part of 
establishing a regular dialogue between both of them.

They discussed how the president-elect’s transition plans were progressing and 
agreed that their teams should continue to build close relationships through 
this period, including with a meeting of their national security advisers in 
the United States before Christmas.

They discussed NATO, agreeing on the importance of the alliance, the need for 
more NATO members to meet the target of spending 2% of GDP and the role that 
NATO can play in addressing diverse threats.

They agreed to stay in close touch and to meet at the earliest possible 
opportunity.

And here are the key lines.

 * May and Trump agree to meet “at the earliest possible opportunity”. 
 * British national security chiefs to meet Trump’s advisers before Christmas.  
Here is an extract from the letter sent to Donald Tusk. According to the 
Independent 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-britons-abroad-eu-rights-donald-tusk-a7442731.html>
, it was backed by 80 parliamentarians, including 70 Tory MPs.

They told Tusk:

We warmly welcome the news that individual member states are working with the 
prime minister and Her Majesty’s government to resolve the status of EU 
citizens in the UK and our citizens living and working in Europe, but we are 
extremely concerned that members of the commission - particularly commissioner 
[Michel] Barnier - seem worryingly indifferent to securing reciprocal rights 
for our and your resident citizens.

His attempts to prevent negotiations taking place on this issue between the 
democratically-elected governments of EU member states are making it harder to 
achieve what is in everyone’s interest: ending the anxiety and uncertainty for 
UK and EU citizens living in one another’s territories.

It is the only just and humane thing to do and anything else would be unworthy 
of Europe’s common values.

People are not bargaining chips. Human beings are not cards to be traded ‘tit 
for tat’ in a political playground.

Here is the key paragraph from Tusk’s letter. 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/11/29-tusk-letter-uk-mps/>

In your letter you state that the European Commission, and in particular Mr 
Barnier, are attempting to prevent negotiations, thereby creating ‘anxiety and 
uncertainty for the UK and EU citizens living in one another’s territories.’ It 
is a very interesting argument, the only problem being that it has nothing to 
do with reality. Would you not agree that the only source of anxiety and 
uncertainty is rather the decision on Brexit? And that the only way to dispel 
the fears and doubts of all the citizens concerned is the quickest possible 
start of the negotiations based on Art. 50 of the Treaty?
 
Here is the full text of Tusk’s letter on his website. 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/11/29-tusk-letter-uk-mps/>
 
Donald Tusk, president of the European council, has published a remarkably 
scathing, and even in parts sarcastic, letter he has sent to around 80 MPs 
criticising Britain’s stance on Brexit.

The MPs, led by the Conservatives Michael Tomlinson and Steve Baker, said in 
their own letter to Tusk 
<http://news.sky.com/story/britons-in-eu-must-have-rights-protected-mps-tell-donald-tusk-10675183>
 that the EU’s refusal to start talks on the status of EU nationals living in 
the UK, and Britons living in Europe, was creating “anxiety and uncertainty”.

Tusk says that it was the vote for Brexit that is creating this uncertainty. 
And he says that, if Britain wants this matter resolved, it could invoke 
article 50, allowing the Brexit talks to starts.

He tells the MPs that their argument has “nothing to do with reality”.

His words are unusually blunt for a letter of this kind. It gives a revealing 
insight into quite how frustrated some EU leaders are getting with Britain’s 
refusal to commence Brexit talks.

Michael Gove used to spend his life reorganising schools, managing Tory MPs, 
trying to reform prisons and orchestrating the departure of the UK from the 
European Union. Now, though, he is a mere backbencher and it seems he has 
nothing better to do with his afternoon thanspend it on Twitter.

It turns out he can use emojis. This is what he tagged on a tweet from me 
about Ed Balls taking part in the Strictly Come Dancing live tour next year.

In a statement marking his appointment as Ukip’s new Brexit spokesman Gerard 
Battensaid Ukip did not want the government to invoke article 50, the measure 
that starts the two-year EU withdrawal process. That could delay, or water 
down, withdrawal, he claimed. Instead he said Ukip wanted the government to 
just repeal the European Communities Act as quickly as possible. He said:

Theresa May and her Tory government cannot be trusted to deliver our 
withdrawal from the EU. She was a remainer who heads a predominantly remain 
government.

If she were genuine about delivering Brexit she would have triggered article 
50 the moment she became prime minister. Instead nothing has been done in the 
last five months, and there are no plans for the next four. Then we will face 
at least another two years of protracted negotiations. Under article 50 they 
could be extended for years to come.

Mrs May’s strategy is to delay and delay the whole process in order to fudge 
it and to try and foist on us a ‘Norwegian or Swiss’-type EU model whereby we 
continue to pay money to the EU, obey a large percentage of its laws, and have 
open borders. In which case we would not have left theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> at all.

Ukip’s policy will be to reject article 50. Rather, we will call for 
parliament to repeal the European Communities Act (1972) immediately as the 
first step in the process: this will restore law-making supremacy to the UK 
parliament and put the British government in the driving seat of negotiations 
not the EU.

Ukip’s new leader Paul Nuttall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/paul-nuttall> has been carrying out a 
reshuffle.

Mike Hookem, MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, has been made fisheries 
spokesman. He was the party’s defence and veterans spokesman, but he will keep 
responsibility for veterans.

John Bickley, a former election candidate, has been appointed immigration 
spokesman. 

Gerard Batten, MEP for London, has become Brexit spokesman. 

Julia Reid, MEP for south west England, has become environment spokesperson. 
Reid has a science doctorate and worked as a laboratory researcher before 
becoming an MEP.

Bill Etheridge, MEP for the West Midlands, has been made defence spokesman. 
Etheridge came thirdin the last Ukip leadership contest

 (the one won by Diane James).
 
John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has put out a statement criticising 
Philip Hammond for refusing to commit to keeping the triple lock into the next 
parliament. (See1.12pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/29/tories-have-16-pt-lead-over-labour-and-highest-vote-share-for-7-years-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-583d7749e4b015a427f75cb5#block-583d7749e4b015a427f75cb5>
McDonnell said:

The chancellor’s refusal again today to commit to the triple lock in the next 
parliament, only further proves that the Tories are abandoning older people.

After six wasted years of Tory failure, we already have a social care system 
close to collapse, and a National Health Service that has been cut to the bone.

Hammond’s refusal once again to provide pensioners with the reassurances over 
the triple lock will only add to the worries of people in their older age.

Labour is committed to supporting older people, and ensuring they have a 
secure and sustainable retirement.Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> will support the pensions triple 
lock and instead of cutting taxes for the super-rich and giant corporations 
will make sure our NHS and social care is properly funded.

Today’s Guardian/ICM poll tables (pdf) 
<https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016_nov2_guardian_poll.pdf>
 show why Labour is so keen to improve its offer to pensioners. Amongst 
over-65s the Tories are ahead of Labour by 60% to 18%. And, amongst the 
over-75s, their lead is even higher - 67% to 12%. These figures, of course, are 
based on a sub-sample of the poll, meaning that they are much less reliable 
than the headline poll figures. But, even allowing for a colossal margin of 
error, they are not great for Labour.
 
As the Herald reports, the SNP spent less on their EU referendum campaign than 
they did fighting the Glenrothes byelection in 2008.

 Commenting on this, the Scottish Conservative MSPMurdo Fraser said:

The SNP is behaving like leaving the EU is the end of the world for Scotland. 
But the party’s pitiful investment in the campaign tells another story 
completely.

The SNP is not a poor organisation, yet it treated the EU referendum like it 
was a council by-election.

Now we know Alex Neil and other senior SNP figures wanted Brexit, perhaps that 
explains why such little effort and cash was invested.
 
Scottish opposition parties have questioned the depth of Sturgeon’s commitment 
to keeping the UK in the EU after it emerged the Scottish National party spent 
just £90,830 on its referendum campaign – less than the Sun newspaper and less 
than its spending on byelections. It had a legal spending limit of £700,000.

The disclosure follows the Scottish government’s admission at the time of the 
referendum that it had not publicised, press released or printed its official 
brochure urging a remain vote in the referendum: the document was put online 
without any fanfare in April.

Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said the figure “reveals the low 
priority that they gave the referendum. They hardly lifted a finger during the 
referendum.” He said the SNP could only redeem herself by battling against 
Brexit.

An SNP spokesman said that attack was ridiculous: Scottish voters had 
overwhelmingly backed the remain vote, by 62% to 38%, and SNP leaders including 
Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond had campaigned vigorously for the EU.
 
The Scottish government’s Brexit minister Michael Russell has warned that the 
UK government’s incoherent approach to Brexit is resulting in an increasingly 
hardline attitude in Europe.

Giving evidence to a Holyrood committee on Tuesday morning, Russell said: 

The European view is hardline and it’s getting harder. They are increasingly 
fed up with not understanding what’s going on and hearing things which, in the 
words of the Dutch foreign minister about Boris Johnson, are intellectually 
incoherent and there’s no doubt that that’s true.

Speaking as first minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Irish senate that the 
option of a second independence referendum remained “firmly on the table”, 
Russell confirmed her position that the Scottish government was “ruling 
absolutely nothing out”.

Russell said that the Scottish government would publish over the next few 
weeks a paper which will outline what are “the options that exist at this time” 
for Scotland.

They lie broadly in three areas: the undifferentiated option of leaving the EU 
in exactly that same way as the UK intends to leaves. At the other end of the 
spectrum is the possibility that we will not be able to find any other adequate 
solution but to go forward with another independence referendum and give the 
people of Scotland the choice.

In the middle are a range of differentiated options and the success of those 
will depend on the willingness of the UK government to include those in their 
negotiating position.

Russell added that there are currently almost 30 sub-state arrangements within 
the EU, and noted that Sturgeon herself had confirmed last week that a 
Norway-style model was being considered.

But Russell went on to caution: “The key to this will lie in the willingness 
of the UK to fold into their negotiating position deals and opportunities which 
exist for other parts of the UK.” For example, he said that it had been made 
clear at last Friday’s meeting of the British-Irish Council that “there must be 
a commitment ... that there has to be a deal for Ireland as an island that does 
not have a hard border”.

Russell also pointed out that Brexit is not the only thing happening in the 
EU, and that the union is facing a number of challenges currently. Terms like 
“impossible” should not be used at this time, he said.


I genuinely do not believe that anything is unlikely or impossible because the 
EU has always been flexible but these are extraordinary circumstances and we 
have to continue to talk about them.
