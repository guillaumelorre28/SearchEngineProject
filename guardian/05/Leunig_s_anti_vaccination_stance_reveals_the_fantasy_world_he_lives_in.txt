The enduring popularity of the cartoonist Michael Leunig is something I’ve 
been baffled by since childhood. His cartoons were stuck on my grandmother’s 
fridge, and I recall looking at the wobbly drawings of a man with a duck on his 
head with confusion and, as I got older, irritation.

Why is this man’s inward-looking sentimentalism so beloved? What does he want? 
Is he really exhorting us all to shut ourselves off from society and start new 
lives in a magical elf land, where everyone wears placid smiles and dances 
around in funny hats?

Leunig is copping flak for publishing another anti-vaccination cartoon. This 
time, he compares the Victorian government’s No Jab, No Play policyto fascism 
<http://junkee.com/leunig-has-compared-the-victorian-government-to-fascists-in-his-latest-cartoon-about-vaccination/63633>
. Leaving aside the legitimate debates about whetherpunishing anti-vaxxers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/13/everyone-is-lining-up-to-punish-parents-who-are-anti-vaccination-isnt-that-worrying>
 is the best way to get children inoculated, his use of “fascist” to describe 
health policy he disagrees with is utterly in keeping with the style he’s 
developed over the past 40 years.

Leunig’s fans love his trademark “whimsy”. He’s popular because he taps into a 
vein of exhaustion with aspects of the world: technology, bureaucracy, the 
absurdity of politics, “the demands of modern existence”.

While this observation is facile in itself – yes, life is complicated and 
exhausting – it’s his solution to it that gets me. Whenever there’s something 
unhappy, or evil, or messy out there, Leunig plops the teapot on his head and 
retreats into his fantasy land. In fact, that’s how he got his start in life. 
As hetold Andrew Denton in 2006 
<http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1632918.htm>:

[I]t was drawing a cartoon about the Vietnam War ... I was trying to draw 
about this very difficult subject and I got engrossed and tangled in it and the 
deadline was ticking away and, anyway, I just then drew a duck. I drew a duck. 
It appeared. You see, I was stuck. I couldn’t go on. I didn’t know where to go 
forward. The duck appeared in my mind or came off the end of my pen and then I 
put a fella sitting on the duck and then I drew a teapot on his head. It was an 
act of defiance. I was being absurd, you see, because I couldn’t untangle this 
terrible Vietnam tragedy and I drew this thing ...

Overwhelmed by the world, his stubborn, ignorant sentimentality leads him to 
retreat again and again into nostalgic fantasies; he is his ownweary gentleman 
<https://artblart.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/leunig-the-weary-gentleman.jpg> 
seeing profound truths about life in a cloud from a far-flung hilltop. In April 
he gave a keynote address on spirituality, in which hesaid 
<http://www.leunig.com.au/ideas/spirituality-art-innocence>:


Our spirituality is innate, idiosyncratic and natural, and it would be futile 
for me to try to examine the matter too closely or elaborately in this limited 
discussion. I am not equipped to do so anyway.

This is pure, uncut Leunig: banal, quasi-spiritual nonsense intended to appeal 
to our sense of dissatisfaction. There’s a very good reason Leunig’s cartoons 
are usually pinned up in places where people are desperately unhappy: doctors’ 
waiting rooms, Centrelink offices, at the RTA.

This apolitical thread runs through all his work, infusing it with smarmy 
middle-class ennui that considers the hard work of engaging with actual 
philosophy or politics – the thoughts and practices that humans develop to 
understand and improve the world – to be too hard or unpleasant.

Until, that is, something punctures his duck-o-sphere, and he can’t resist 
poking his head out of Curly Flat to offer an opinion on current affairs. He 
tries to have it both ways, as Michael Gordon (perhaps inadvertently) noted in 
2010:

“Some cartoonists have been extraordinarily successful at taking pot shots at 
society’s mores while leading a merry dance like a medieval King’s fool. 
Michael Leunig is a classic example of this sort of artist. He claims to be 
non-political but all of his work is about the inhabitants of the City of 
Mankind. Even the holy fool occasionally finds himself out of the zone of 
sanctuary ....”

Leunig’s infantile posture that puts his (and his audience’s) need to be 
pacified above the needs of others in the community, from which he absents 
himself. His work is like a sponge, soaking up emotional distress instead of 
examining why it exists or how it could be used as the impetus for positive 
change.

Except when it doesn’t: his occasional forays into explicit political 
cartooning demonstrate that he does feel a responsibility to comment on issues 
he considers important, like vaccination fascism.

His subgenre of anti-vax cartoons tap into a long-standing disdain for 
contemporary motherhood, which can be seen in his controversial cartoonThoughts 
of a Baby Lying in a Childcare Centre 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/will-political-correctness-kill-the-cartoon-20100610-xzgt.html>
. In a dig at mums who put their kids in care, the cartoonist puts words in the 
mouth of an unhappy bub: “Call her a cruel, ignorant, selfish bitch if you like 
but I will defend her. She is my mother and I think the WORLD of her”.


Again, I’m almost sympathetic: people really don’t have enough time for 
family, community and leisure. But does he identify the forces responsible and 
get stuck into them? Is the mother also a person who struggles and might need 
the occasional mystical hilltop retreat? Nope, it’sher selfishness that’s to 
blame.

Leunig’s anti-vax stance is built on these two tendencies: his perception of 
the world (especially the political world) as inherently coercive and hostile 
to an imagined and innate human innocence; and his view that the traditional 
mother-child bond, which he never bothers to explain, is a divine interface 
that must be upheld at all costs. As he wrote in another recentanti-vax cartoon 
<http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2015/04/16/leunig-cartoonist-backs-right-refuse-vaccinations/>
:

Some mothers do ‘ave ‘em.
They have maternal instincts
That contradict what science thinks.
They stand up to the state:
A mother’s love may be as great
As any new vaccine
That man has ever seen

Nuts to the actual mums of the world, who think pro-family policies like free 
childcare, parental leave, financial and employer support are what they need to 
practice motherhood effectively. Leunig, the man who has spent years 
encouraging people to plant themselves in the garden, knows better – and he’ll 
tell you so (even as he pleads his unworthiness to do so).

From this position we can see why Leunig’s apparent concern for children’s 
health stirs him to oppose vaccinations, which have been proven time and time 
again to be a great way of promoting children’s health. The child he’s 
protecting here is not in the first instance an actual, living child – but his 
own mystical inner child, which he constantly reminds us is of the utmost 
preciousness.


Everyone is lining up to punish parents who are anti-vaccination. Isn't that 
worrying? | Jason Wilson

To him, the government mandating vaccinations is just another intrusion of the 
dirty, messy, cruel modern world he’s spent his life avoiding. In his interview
with Andrew Denton 
<http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1632918.htm> in 2006 he 
demonstrates this view, saying he homeschools his own children to protect them 
from having to “submit and be controlled ... and be confused out of [their 
heads] by all these mad things they teach them”.

To acknowledge that vaccination works wonders would be to concede that Big 
Government, Big Pharma, and various other Big Mean Nasties are part of a 
nuanced world that is actually worth being a part of.

That’s unlikely to happen any time soon. Leunig’s cartoons encourage us to go 
on a permanent mental vacation. If that’s what he needs to do to get out of bed 
in the morning, then fine, but if he wants to claim this exemption, he can’t 
expect anything more than mockery and derision when he comes down off the 
lonely mountain to give us a lecture.
