At last an opponent of Jeremy Corbyn’s re-election offers some sense. Ayesha 
Hazarika (Opinion, 28 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/labour-moderates-owen-smith-defeat-jeremy-corbyn>
) shows the only way forward for the Labour party. It must combine, if it can’t 
unite, behind its democratically elected leader and use the next four years to 
show how it can be a party of government. Debate issues, yes – fiercely if need 
be; but afterwards the policy must be the same for everyone. Labour has enough 
to do overcoming the inbuilt prejudice of the media without making further 
problems for itself.

• The MPs who voted no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>, and then voted for his 
challenger in the leadership election, set a massive example of deselection 
politics at the highest level of the party. They cannot now protest if other 
party members stand against them for selection in their own constituency 
parties.

• Corbyn appeals to people, particularly those who have joined the party to 
vote for him, because they have no idea of politics in this country and treat 
it with the enthusiasm of children with a new toy. All they have to do is 
install a leader with “real socialist policies” and the minor matter of 
persuading the electorate to vote for them can be left to those who actually do 
know whether they are coming or going. In 1983, Michael Foot approached the 
electorate with “a real socialist manifesto” and Labour suffered the biggest 
defeat in its history.

• Tom Watson believes that the prime minister could call an election at any 
time (Report, 28 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration>
) and Peter Mandelson is praying for the same thing(‘Bring on early election’, 
28 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/peter-mandelson-i-am-praying-for-early-election>
). Ain’t possible. Under theFixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011>, early 
elections can now only be held if a motion for an early election is agreed by 
at least two-thirds of MPs, or if a motion of no confidence is passed and no 
alternative government is confirmed by the Commons within 14 days.

• Polly Toynbee accuses Jeremy Corbyn of a lack of magnanimity in victory (
Opinion, 27 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-2016>
); the words mote and beam come to mind.
