Mixed signals for US manufacturing

Following a positive Markit manufacturing survey, the latest report from the 
Institute for Supply Managment has come in below expectations.

The ISM manufacturing activity index fell to 52.6 in July, down from 53.2 the 
previous month and lower than the forecast 53.

US manufacturing grew more strongly in July, according to the latest Markit 
data.

Its manufacturing PMI came in at 52.9, up from 51.3 in June and in line with 
the initial estimates. This is the highest level since October, with the 
employment index at its best since July 2015, which bodes well for Friday’s 
non-farm payroll numbers.

Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said:

The stronger manufacturing PMI survey data for July fuel hopes that the sector 
will act as less of drag on the economy in the third quarter after a 
disappointing first half of the year.

Having signalled the sector’s worst performance for over six years in the 
second quarter, contributing to a sluggishness in the economy that was later 
seen in the soft GDP numbers, the improvement in July suggests that 
manufacturers and exporters will have helped lift the economy at the start of 
the third quarter.

Job creation has also picked up, hopefully in a sign that producers are seeing 
a brighter picture, coping with a strong dollar and having put the worst of the 
energy sector’s restructuring behind them.

Wall Street opens lower

Ahead of the two US manufacturing reports due shortly - first Markit, then the 
Institute for Supply Management - US markets are edging lower in early trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 28 points while the S&P 500 
has opened marginally lower.

The two surveys tend to be out of sync, but this time both are expected to 
show slight improvements.

Larry Elliott

Decisive policy action is needed after the poor UK manufacturing figures, 
writes our economics editor Larry Elliott:

So much for the idea that the post-Brexit hit to UK manufacturing was a 
knee-jerk reaction to the referendum and that the mood would improve as time 
wore on.

The final figures for how industry fared in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/01/uk-manufacturing-decline-adds-pressure-on-bank-to-cut-interest-rates-pmi>
 are now in, and they were even worse than theflash  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey>
estimate released 10 days ago. Some analysts had expressed guarded confidence 
that Theresa May’s arrival in Downing Street might have made companies less 
gloomy.

While it is still possible that there has been an overreaction to the shock 
Brexit result, the idea that business will ride things out after a month or two 
of turbulence now looks fanciful. Policy action – and decisive policy action at 
that – is going to be needed, starting with theBank of England

Here’s our story on the poor UK manufacturing figures:

Britain’s manufacturing sector shrank at the steepest pace for more than three 
years in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, forcing factories to cut jobs as 
they grappled with higher costs and lower demand.

News that the decline in manufacturing activity in July was steeper than first 
thought cementeda view that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this 
week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/31/uk-interest-rates-set-to-be-cut-bank-of-england-growth-forecasts>
 in a bid to shore up business and consumer spending.

The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI 
<https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/0c05196aef1a446f94f249eef9bf2ea6>
 survey, which polls more than 600 companies monthly, suggested domestic demand 
for manufacturers’ goods had been hit by uncertainty both before and after the 
UK’s referendum on EU membership on 23 June. That overshadowed a boost to 
export orders from a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper.

The headline index was the worst since early 2013 and weaker than a “flash” 
estimate published in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey>
.

The new reading, which takes in responses from a greater number of firms, 
stood at 48.2, down from theflash estimate of 49.1 
<https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/b68c3686a48c40198505b81e4e55cd81>
 and lower than 52.4 in June. A reading above 50 denotes expansion while a 
reading below suggests activity contracted. Responses were collected between 12 
and 26 July.

Elsewhere, and there is some fallout from the unexpected decision last week by 
the UK government to delay plans for the Hinckley Point C nuclear power station:

China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> has warned Britain that it 
cannot risk driving away Chinese investors as the country’s official news 
agency questioned the UK government’s postponement of approval for the Hinkley 
Point nuclear power plant.

Theresa May, the prime minister, is understood to be concerned about the 
security implications of aplanned Chinese investment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/01/osborne-rejected-safeguards-over-chinese-role-in-hinkley-point-says-ex-energy-minister>
 in Hinkley and hasdelayed giving the £18bn project the green light 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed>
.

Xinhua news agency said China understood and respected Britain’s requirement 
for more time to think about the deal.

“However, what China cannot understand is the ‘suspicious approach’ that comes 
from nowhere to Chinese investment in making the postponement,” it said.

Following a positive Markit manufacturing survey, the latest report from the 
Institute for Supply Managment has come in below expectations.

The ISM manufacturing activity index fell to 52.6 in July, down from 53.2 the 
previous month and lower than the forecast 53.

US manufacturing grew more strongly in July, according to the latest Markit 
data.

Its manufacturing PMI came in at 52.9, up from 51.3 in June and in line with 
the initial estimates. This is the highest level since October, with the 
employment index at its best since July 2015, which bodes well for Friday’s 
non-farm payroll numbers.

Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said:

The stronger manufacturing PMI survey data for July fuel hopes that the sector 
will act as less of drag on the economy in the third quarter after a 
disappointing first half of the year.

Having signalled the sector’s worst performance for over six years in the 
second quarter, contributing to a sluggishness in the economy that was later 
seen in the soft GDP numbers, the improvement in July suggests that 
manufacturers and exporters will have helped lift the economy at the start of 
the third quarter.

Job creation has also picked up, hopefully in a sign that producers are seeing 
a brighter picture, coping with a strong dollar and having put the worst of the 
energy sector’s restructuring behind them.

Ahead of the two US manufacturing reports due shortly - first Markit, then the 
Institute for Supply Management - US markets are edging lower in early trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 28 points while the S&P 500 
has opened marginally lower.

The two surveys tend to be out of sync, but this time both are expected to 
show slight improvements.
 
There could be more bad economic news for the UK ahead of the Bank of 
England’s rate decision on Thursday:

And on Wednesday comes the UK service sector PMI which is forecast to be flat 
on June’s figure.
 
Decisive policy action is needed after the poor UK manufacturing figures, 
writes our economics editor Larry Elliott:

So much for the idea that the post-Brexit hit to UK manufacturing was a 
knee-jerk reaction to the referendum and that the mood would improve as time 
wore on.

The final figures for how industry fared in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/01/uk-manufacturing-decline-adds-pressure-on-bank-to-cut-interest-rates-pmi>
 are now in, and they were even worse than theflash  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey>
estimate released 10 days ago. Some analysts had expressed guarded confidence 
that Theresa May’s arrival in Downing Street might have made companies less 
gloomy.

While it is still possible that there has been an overreaction to the shock 
Brexit result, the idea that business will ride things out after a month or two 
of turbulence now looks fanciful. Policy action – and decisive policy action at 
that – is going to be needed, starting with theBank of England

Here’s our story on the poor UK manufacturing figures:

Britain’s manufacturing sector shrank at the steepest pace for more than three 
years in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, forcing factories to cut jobs as 
they grappled with higher costs and lower demand.

News that the decline in manufacturing activity in July was steeper than first 
thought cementeda view that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this 
week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/31/uk-interest-rates-set-to-be-cut-bank-of-england-growth-forecasts>
 in a bid to shore up business and consumer spending.

The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI 
<https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/0c05196aef1a446f94f249eef9bf2ea6>
 survey, which polls more than 600 companies monthly, suggested domestic demand 
for manufacturers’ goods had been hit by uncertainty both before and after the 
UK’s referendum on EU membership on 23 June. That overshadowed a boost to 
export orders from a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper.

The headline index was the worst since early 2013 and weaker than a “flash” 
estimate published in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey>
.

The new reading, which takes in responses from a greater number of firms, 
stood at 48.2, down from theflash estimate of 49.1 
<https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/b68c3686a48c40198505b81e4e55cd81>
 and lower than 52.4 in June. A reading above 50 denotes expansion while a 
reading below suggests activity contracted. Responses were collected between 12 
and 26 July.

Elsewhere, and there is some fallout from the unexpected decision last week by 
the UK government to delay plans for the Hinckley Point C nuclear power station:

China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> has warned Britain that it 
cannot risk driving away Chinese investors as the country’s official news 
agency questioned the UK government’s postponement of approval for the Hinkley 
Point nuclear power plant.

Theresa May, the prime minister, is understood to be concerned about the 
security implications of aplanned Chinese investment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/01/osborne-rejected-safeguards-over-chinese-role-in-hinkley-point-says-ex-energy-minister>
 in Hinkley and hasdelayed giving the £18bn project the green light 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed>
.

Xinhua news agency said China understood and respected Britain’s requirement 
for more time to think about the deal.

“However, what China cannot understand is the ‘suspicious approach’ that comes 
from nowhere to Chinese investment in making the postponement,” it said.
