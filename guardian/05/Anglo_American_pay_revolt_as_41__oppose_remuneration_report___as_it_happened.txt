Germany has responded to the earlier comments from ECB president Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/21/european-central-bank-mario-draghi-rates-qe-markets-live?page=with:block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531#block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531>
.

Draghi was countering an attack from German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble 
who saidrecord low rates were causing “extraordinary problems” for German banks 
and pensioners 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-economy-schaeuble-idUKKCN0X91LK> .

Draghi defended the ECB’s policies and said, “We obey the law, not the 
politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.”

In turn German chancellor Angela Merkel said it was legitimate for Germans to 
discuss how far interest rates had fallen but “that shouldn’t be confused with 
interference in the independent policy of the ECB, which I support.”

“The ECB is is independent in its policies,” she told reporters while on a 
visit to the Netherlands, according to news agency Reuters.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Legal and General Investment Management, which owns 2.9% of Anglo American, is 
one of the investors which voted against the company’s remuneration report. It 
said:

The rationale for this instruction centred on the lack of discretion exercised 
by the Remuneration Committee to scale back Long Term Incentive Awards (LTIP) 
to Executive Directors at a low share price. These grants are made as a 
multiple of salary and have the effect of awarding a higher number of shares 
which could lead to windfall gains in the future. This is not in line with best 
practice and is stated in our voting policy.

At the AGM, approximately 42% of investors opposed this item. We will continue 
to engage with the company giving constructive feedback on their remuneration 
structure ahead of the binding policy vote next year.

Mixed day for European markets

With the recent gains on markets it was probably no surprise that investors 
have decided to pause for some reflection. TheEuropean Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> meeting with no 
change to policy but promises of further action if necessary was seen as a 
little inconclusive for market sentiment, while in the UK, retail sales and 
public borrowing figures both disappointed. Analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet 
Direct said:

After the recent run of gains for equities, it was probably time for the 
markets to pause for breath and that certainly appears to have come about 
during today’s session. Oil prices are edging back a little, but more 
significantly for London stocks was the news that UK retail sales came in far 
lower than had been forecast. This seems to have set the pace for the morning 
session and the fact thatMario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> appeared to lack any 
urgency in his statement meant there was little left for markets to cheer, 
although we have seen some signs of bargain hunting in the last few minutes of 
trade.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 28.82 points or 0.45% to 6381.44 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.14% to 10,435.73 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4582.83 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB finished up 0.4% at 18,732.96 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 9197.2 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 598.72 on hopes of a deal 
between the country and its creditors as the Eurogroup meets on Friday 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 58 points 
or 0.3%.

4.59pm BST 16:59  <> 

In his opening remarks to Anglo American’s annual meeting - just released by 
the company - chairman Sir John Parker has defended its pay policies:

We are of course well aware of the strength of feeling among some investors 
about the levels of executive remuneration in many large companies and the 
mechanisms that determine them. As you know, we undertook extensive revisions 
to our remuneration policy in 2013 following consultations by the chair of our 
Remuneration Committee, Sir Philip Hampton, with our major shareholders, and 
that policy was overwhelmingly approved at our AGM in 2014. It is that policy 
that we are working to today.

 Volatile commodity markets and their effect on companies such as ours of 
course create a variety of remuneration outcomes. That is what our remuneration 
structures are designed for - to ensure appropriate alignment with shareholder 
interests, while also incentivising management through a balance between 
stretching management and making targets realistically achievable.

 There has to be a mixture of measures focused on financial and relative 
market performance as well as non-financial metrics for other critical work 
that drives longer-term strategic success. I believe that our remuneration 
policy does strike that balance. However, as is the case every three years, we 
will be taking a fresh look at the policy during the next 12 months in order to 
put it to a fresh round of consultation with shareholders, followed by a vote 
at next year’s AGM.

 In the case of the remuneration outcomes for 2015 - without doubt a very 
tough year for us and for our shareholders - I would point out that our 
existing policy did result in the Chief Executive’s variable pay being just 
one-fifth of the maximum achievable. In addition, his salary was frozen, as it 
was for all senior management.

Anglo American plans to launch a review of executive pay, Reuters is 
reporting, after the revolt against the £3.4m pay packet awarded to chief 
executive Mark Cutifani.

The exact numbers show 41.64% of shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the 
annual meeting opposed the remuneration report.

Last year 94% voted in favour of the report.

The vote is, as usual, non-binding but will prove severely embarrassing for

Anglo says the full voting result will be released on Friday. Of those 
shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the annual meeting, 41% were opposed 
to the remuneration report with 58% in favour.

Earlier investment group Hermes said it would not back the pay report. 
Director Bruce Duguid said:

We are concerned by the unusually high number of shares issued to directors 
under its long term incentive plan. This is roughly triple the number of prior 
years, as it is calculated by dividing the salary of each director by the 
prevailing share price, which was particularly low at the time of the award 
following a sharp fall over the year. In the light of the value creation 
experienced by long term owners in recent years, we are concerned about the 
resulting potential future reward to directors.

Anglo American investors rebel against director pay

Elsewhere, the new “shareholder spring” seems to be continuing.

After nearly 60% of investors voted against Bob Dudley’s pay package at BP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal>
, Reuters is reporting that Anglo American has said that partial voting results

mining group’s annual meeting.

Chief executive Mark Cutifani is in line for a £3.4m pay deal.

Severin Carrell

Back with the UK, and the Treasury has revealed the impact of falling oil 
prices on the North Sea sector. Scotland editor Severin Carrell reports:

The North Sea oil and gas sector raised only £35m last year following the 
collapse in global oil prices and further weakening the Treasury’s books, the 
latest HMRC data shows.

Provisional HMRC data for 2015/16 puts total petroleum revenue tax income at 
minus £503m – the first time PRT income has been negative for a full year, with 
operators able to deduct various allowances or a deductible expense for 
corporation tax and the supplementary charge. In 2008/09, the Treasury raised 
£2.8bn from PRT.

Offshore corporation tax income was also at its lowest in decades, at £538m 
compared to peaks of £9.8bn in 2008/09 and £8.8bn in 2011/12.

These figures, which exclude Treasury income from the supplementary charge or 
costs to the Treasury of other North Sea tax deductions or allowances for 
decommissioning or investment, suggest the sector’s days as a cash cow are now 
over. It also confirms challenging questions for Scotland in the ongoing debate 
over independence.

Eurozone consumer confidence edges up in April

Still with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose slightly more than 
expected in April after three consecutive months of decline.

According to an initial estimate from the European Commission, it edged up 0.4 
points to -9.3 compared to expectations of a figure of -9.5.

For the 28 member European Union, consumer sentiment increased by 0.5 points 
to -6.8.

Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:

A modicum of good news for Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> growth hopes as consumer 
confidence edged up in April having fallen over the previous three months to be 
at a 15-month low in March. The improvement was small, but at least it was a 
tiny step in the right direction.

Any sign that consumer confidence may be starting to turn around is to be 
welcomed as on the face of it, consumers perhaps offer the Eurozone the best 
hope for growth at the moment - the fundamentals still look reasonable for 
consumer spending in the Eurozone with deflation/negligible inflation boosting 
purchasing power and labour markets generally improved.

Commenting on the criticism of loose monetary policies from some quarters - 
notably Germany of course - economists at the Cebr said:

Cebr recognises that there are important risks associated with an 
over-reliance on loose monetary policy. Continuing to push on the string of 
monetary policy to boost the Eurozone’s flailing economy is not a sustainable 
way forward. The potential of monetary stimulus to restore inflation and growth 
is reaching its limits as more decisive measures such as ‘helicopter money’ are 
not yet on the ECB table. Moreover, the uncharted waters of “QE infinity” and 
negative rates could be hiding unintended negative consequences that no one can 
predict – the policies are after all called ‘unconventional’ for a reason. 
However, as Draghi pointed out in his press conference, the ECB is not alone in 
experimenting with these measures. On the contrary, the ECB has been late to 
the ‘QE party’ and in efforts to loosen policy more generally. Additionally, 
given its mandate to pursue price stability and contribute to the EU’s 
objective of balanced economic growth, the ECB cannot be blamed for loosening 
policy given the inadequate response when it comes to the other levers of 
economic management: fiscal policy and structural reforms.

Looking ahead, Cebr expects the economic recovery in the Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> to continue to develop at an 
anaemic pace. While the ECB’s stimulus measures will provide some relief for 
now, these policies will only work slowly in the absence of a supportive fiscal 
stance in those member states that can afford to do so within the Maastricht 
Treaty’s fiscal rules.

The ECB meeting was clearly dovish in tone, according to economist Carsten 
Brzeski at ING Bank:

Some ECB watchers today might regret that they did not enjoy one of the first 
sunny days of the year but stayed inside following a rather eventless, not to 
say dull, ECB press conference. As expected the ECB did not announce any new 
measures but sent a clear dovish signal, keeping the door open for additional 
easing in the future.

All in all, there are two key take-aways from today’s ECB meeting: first of 
all, the ECB is still on high alert and would be willing to implement even more 
stimulus if the recovery falters or low inflation leads to negative second 
round effects (even though it’s unclear what these measures would really be). 
And, secondly, the ECB does not look willing at all to alter its monetary 
policies as a result of German criticism. German [criticism] has become a fact 
of life but it will not change the ECB’s life.

Following Draghi’s performance, the ECB has issued more details of its 
corporate bond buying programme. 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2016/html/pr160421_1.en.html>

This will start in June and be carried out by six central banks, from Belgium, 
Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Finland.

Among the criteria for eligibility, the bonds must be denominated in euro, 
have a credit rating of at least BBB-, have a maturity of between six months 
and 30 years, be issued by a corporation established in the euro area but not 
be a credit institution. Debt from corporations in the euro area whose ultimate 
parent companies are based elsewhere are also eligible if it meets the other 
criteria.

Snap summary: Draghi faces down his critics
 European Central Bank (ECB) President Draghi. Photograph: Ralph 
Orlowski/Reuters 
Mario Draghi has just administered a very firm rebuke to his critics in 
general, and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble in particular.

Most crucially, the ECB president has warned that those who endanger ECB 
independence are actually making Europe’s economic problems worse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/21/european-central-bank-mario-draghi-rates-qe-markets-live?page=with:block-5718d440e4b0e0f78acde550#block-5718d440e4b0e0f78acde550>
.

He swept aside the notion that German savers are the victims in the current 
crisis, blaming the media for not explaining how low inflation is helping 
savers.


And he was adamant that the ECB will not be knocked off course, revealing that 
the governing council were unanimous in defending its independence today.

As Draghi put it: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/21/european-central-bank-mario-draghi-rates-qe-markets-live?page=with:block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531#block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531>

We have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the euro zone not 
only for Germany.

We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by 
the law.”

That’s code for “Wolfgang, please don’t claim we are causing ‘enormous 
problems’ 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-economy-schaeuble-idUKKCN0X91LK>, 
there’s a good chap”.

Draghi also tried to cool another discussion, about helicopter money, saying 
twice that it hadn’t been discussed.
Open Europe (@OpenEurope) 
That's all from Draghi. Very robust defence from critics. Expect questions 
about Helicopter money to intensify if inflation remains low
 <https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/status/723142191325958144> April 21, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/status/723142191325958144> Carsten Brzeski 
(@carstenbrzeski) 
Listen to this Germany. Draghi rightly says that German ECB-bashing can have 
negative impact on confidence, actually prolonging ECB policies
 <https://twitter.com/carstenbrzeski/status/723140840760041473> April 21, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/carstenbrzeski/status/723140840760041473> 
And having left interest rates on hold today, Draghi’s message to the eurozone 
was effectively ‘trust us, it’s working’.

Our policies work, they are effective. Just give them time to fully display 
their effects.”

Draghi: Don't want to speculate about Brexit

And finally, Draghi gets the Brexit question.

Q: Is the ECB worried that the UK’s referendum over European Union membership 
will hurt the recovery?

The discussion about Brexit has already had some significant consequences on 
markets, Draghi replies, such as the decline in the value of sterling.

He won’t speculate about the outcome of the vote on June 23, but says that ECB 
staff think there is only a “limited” risk that it might endanger the eurozone 
recovery.

Q: Are you worried that companies will stop investing because of the flow of 
criticism from Germany?

A polite, lively debate may even be welcome, to help shape our policies, says 
Draghi.


But criticisms of a certain type could be seen as endangering the independence 
of the ECB. Therefore, that can cause delays in investment, delays in taking 
risks.

But we are independent, so we will continue with our policies. But the

Germany has responded to the earlier comments from ECB president Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/21/european-central-bank-mario-draghi-rates-qe-markets-live?page=with:block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531#block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531>
.

Draghi was countering an attack from German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble 
who saidrecord low rates were causing “extraordinary problems” for German banks 
and pensioners 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-economy-schaeuble-idUKKCN0X91LK> .

Draghi defended the ECB’s policies and said, “We obey the law, not the 
politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.”

In turn German chancellor Angela Merkel said it was legitimate for Germans to 
discuss how far interest rates had fallen but “that shouldn’t be confused with 
interference in the independent policy of the ECB, which I support.”

“The ECB is is independent in its policies,” she told reporters while on a 
visit to the Netherlands, according to news agency Reuters.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Legal and General Investment Management, which owns 2.9% of Anglo American, is 
one of the investors which voted against the company’s remuneration report. It 
said:

The rationale for this instruction centred on the lack of discretion exercised 
by the Remuneration Committee to scale back Long Term Incentive Awards (LTIP) 
to Executive Directors at a low share price. These grants are made as a 
multiple of salary and have the effect of awarding a higher number of shares 
which could lead to windfall gains in the future. This is not in line with best 
practice and is stated in our voting policy.

At the AGM, approximately 42% of investors opposed this item. We will continue 
to engage with the company giving constructive feedback on their remuneration 
structure ahead of the binding policy vote next year.
 
Here’s our report on the investor rebellion at Anglo American:

With the recent gains on markets it was probably no surprise that investors 
have decided to pause for some reflection. TheEuropean Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> meeting with no 
change to policy but promises of further action if necessary was seen as a 
little inconclusive for market sentiment, while in the UK, retail sales and 
public borrowing figures both disappointed. Analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet 
Direct said:

After the recent run of gains for equities, it was probably time for the 
markets to pause for breath and that certainly appears to have come about 
during today’s session. Oil prices are edging back a little, but more 
significantly for London stocks was the news that UK retail sales came in far 
lower than had been forecast. This seems to have set the pace for the morning 
session and the fact thatMario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> appeared to lack any 
urgency in his statement meant there was little left for markets to cheer, 
although we have seen some signs of bargain hunting in the last few minutes of 
trade.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 28.82 points or 0.45% to 6381.44 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.14% to 10,435.73 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4582.83 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB finished up 0.4% at 18,732.96 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 9197.2 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 598.72 on hopes of a deal 
between the country and its creditors as the Eurogroup meets on Friday 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 58 points 
or 0.3%.
 
In his opening remarks to Anglo American’s annual meeting - just released by 
the company - chairman Sir John Parker has defended its pay policies:

We are of course well aware of the strength of feeling among some investors 
about the levels of executive remuneration in many large companies and the 
mechanisms that determine them. As you know, we undertook extensive revisions 
to our remuneration policy in 2013 following consultations by the chair of our 
Remuneration Committee, Sir Philip Hampton, with our major shareholders, and 
that policy was overwhelmingly approved at our AGM in 2014. It is that policy 
that we are working to today.

 Volatile commodity markets and their effect on companies such as ours of 
course create a variety of remuneration outcomes. That is what our remuneration 
structures are designed for - to ensure appropriate alignment with shareholder 
interests, while also incentivising management through a balance between 
stretching management and making targets realistically achievable.

 There has to be a mixture of measures focused on financial and relative 
market performance as well as non-financial metrics for other critical work 
that drives longer-term strategic success. I believe that our remuneration 
policy does strike that balance. However, as is the case every three years, we 
will be taking a fresh look at the policy during the next 12 months in order to 
put it to a fresh round of consultation with shareholders, followed by a vote 
at next year’s AGM.

 In the case of the remuneration outcomes for 2015 - without doubt a very 
tough year for us and for our shareholders - I would point out that our 
existing policy did result in the Chief Executive’s variable pay being just 
one-fifth of the maximum achievable. In addition, his salary was frozen, as it 
was for all senior management.
 
Anglo American plans to launch a review of executive pay, Reuters is 
reporting, after the revolt against the £3.4m pay packet awarded to chief 
executive Mark Cutifani.

The exact numbers show 41.64% of shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the 
annual meeting opposed the remuneration report.

Last year 94% voted in favour of the report.
 
The vote is, as usual, non-binding but will prove severely embarrassing for 
the company.
 
Anglo says the full voting result will be released on Friday. Of those 
shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the annual meeting, 41% were opposed 
to the remuneration report with 58% in favour.

Earlier investment group Hermes said it would not back the pay report. 
Director Bruce Duguid said:

We are concerned by the unusually high number of shares issued to directors 
under its long term incentive plan. This is roughly triple the number of prior 
years, as it is calculated by dividing the salary of each director by the 
prevailing share price, which was particularly low at the time of the award 
following a sharp fall over the year. In the light of the value creation 
experienced by long term owners in recent years, we are concerned about the 
resulting potential future reward to directors.
 
Elsewhere, the new “shareholder spring” seems to be continuing.

After nearly 60% of investors voted against Bob Dudley’s pay package at BP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal>
, Reuters is reporting that Anglo American has said that partial voting results 
show that 41% of shareholders have voted against its remuneration report at the 
mining group’s annual meeting.

Earlier, just as ECB president Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> was getting started, over 
in the US the Labor Department announced that the number of jobless claims fell 
unexpectedly last week.

Initial benefit claims dropped by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000, the 
lowest reading since November 1973, compared to expectations of a rise to 
around 263,000.
 
Meanwhile oil is on the slide again. After early gains, a rebound in the value 
of the dollar has seen Brent crude fall 1.5% to $45.08 a barrel.
 
Back with the UK, and the Treasury has revealed the impact of falling oil 
prices on the North Sea sector. Scotland editor Severin Carrell reports:

The North Sea oil and gas sector raised only £35m last year following the 
collapse in global oil prices and further weakening the Treasury’s books, the 
latest HMRC data shows.

Provisional HMRC data for 2015/16 puts total petroleum revenue tax income at 
minus £503m – the first time PRT income has been negative for a full year, with 
operators able to deduct various allowances or a deductible expense for 
corporation tax and the supplementary charge. In 2008/09, the Treasury raised 
£2.8bn from PRT.

Offshore corporation tax income was also at its lowest in decades, at £538m 
compared to peaks of £9.8bn in 2008/09 and £8.8bn in 2011/12.

These figures, which exclude Treasury income from the supplementary charge or 
costs to the Treasury of other North Sea tax deductions or allowances for 
decommissioning or investment, suggest the sector’s days as a cash cow are now 
over. It also confirms challenging questions for Scotland in the ongoing debate 
over independence.
 
Still with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose slightly more than 
expected in April after three consecutive months of decline.

According to an initial estimate from the European Commission, it edged up 0.4 
points to -9.3 compared to expectations of a figure of -9.5.

For the 28 member European Union, consumer sentiment increased by 0.5 points 
to -6.8.

Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:

A modicum of good news for Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> growth hopes as consumer 
confidence edged up in April having fallen over the previous three months to be 
at a 15-month low in March. The improvement was small, but at least it was a 
tiny step in the right direction.

Any sign that consumer confidence may be starting to turn around is to be 
welcomed as on the face of it, consumers perhaps offer the Eurozone the best 
hope for growth at the moment - the fundamentals still look reasonable for 
consumer spending in the Eurozone with deflation/negligible inflation boosting 
purchasing power and labour markets generally improved.

Commenting on the criticism of loose monetary policies from some quarters - 
notably Germany of course - economists at the Cebr said:

Cebr recognises that there are important risks associated with an 
over-reliance on loose monetary policy. Continuing to push on the string of 
monetary policy to boost the Eurozone’s flailing economy is not a sustainable 
way forward. The potential of monetary stimulus to restore inflation and growth 
is reaching its limits as more decisive measures such as ‘helicopter money’ are 
not yet on the ECB table. Moreover, the uncharted waters of “QE infinity” and 
negative rates could be hiding unintended negative consequences that no one can 
predict – the policies are after all called ‘unconventional’ for a reason. 
However, as Draghi pointed out in his press conference, the ECB is not alone in 
experimenting with these measures. On the contrary, the ECB has been late to 
the ‘QE party’ and in efforts to loosen policy more generally. Additionally, 
given its mandate to pursue price stability and contribute to the EU’s 
objective of balanced economic growth, the ECB cannot be blamed for loosening 
policy given the inadequate response when it comes to the other levers of 
economic management: fiscal policy and structural reforms.

Looking ahead, Cebr expects the economic recovery in the Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> to continue to develop at an 
anaemic pace. While the ECB’s stimulus measures will provide some relief for 
now, these policies will only work slowly in the absence of a supportive fiscal 
stance in those member states that can afford to do so within the Maastricht 
Treaty’s fiscal rules.
 
The ECB meeting was clearly dovish in tone, according to economist Carsten 
Brzeski at ING Bank:

Some ECB watchers today might regret that they did not enjoy one of the first 
sunny days of the year but stayed inside following a rather eventless, not to 
say dull, ECB press conference. As expected the ECB did not announce any new 
measures but sent a clear dovish signal, keeping the door open for additional 
easing in the future.

All in all, there are two key take-aways from today’s ECB meeting: first of 
all, the ECB is still on high alert and would be willing to implement even more 
stimulus if the recovery falters or low inflation leads to negative second 
round effects (even though it’s unclear what these measures would really be). 
And, secondly, the ECB does not look willing at all to alter its monetary 
policies as a result of German criticism. German [criticism] has become a fact 
of life but it will not change the ECB’s life.
 
Following Draghi’s performance, the ECB has issued more details of its 
corporate bond buying programme. 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2016/html/pr160421_1.en.html>

This will start in June and be carried out by six central banks, from Belgium, 
Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Finland.

Among the criteria for eligibility, the bonds must be denominated in euro, 
have a credit rating of at least BBB-, have a maturity of between six months 
and 30 years, be issued by a corporation established in the euro area but not 
be a credit institution. Debt from corporations in the euro area whose ultimate 
parent companies are based elsewhere are also eligible if it meets the other 
criteria.

Mario Draghi has just administered a very firm rebuke to his critics in 
general, and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble in particular.

Most crucially, the ECB president has warned that those who endanger ECB 
independence are actually making Europe’s economic problems worse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/21/european-central-bank-mario-draghi-rates-qe-markets-live?page=with:block-5718d440e4b0e0f78acde550#block-5718d440e4b0e0f78acde550>
.

He swept aside the notion that German savers are the victims in the current 
crisis, blaming the media for not explaining how low inflation is helping 
savers.


And he was adamant that the ECB will not be knocked off course, revealing that 
the governing council were unanimous in defending its independence today.

As Draghi put it: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/21/european-central-bank-mario-draghi-rates-qe-markets-live?page=with:block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531#block-5718ccc0e4b0e0f78acde531>

We have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the euro zone not 
only for Germany.

We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by 
the law.”

That’s code for “Wolfgang, please don’t claim we are causing ‘enormous 
problems’ 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-economy-schaeuble-idUKKCN0X91LK>, 
there’s a good chap”.

Draghi also tried to cool another discussion, about helicopter money, saying 
twice that it hadn’t been discussed.
Open Europe (@OpenEurope) 
That's all from Draghi. Very robust defence from critics. Expect questions 
about Helicopter money to intensify if inflation remains low

Listen to this Germany. Draghi rightly says that German ECB-bashing can have 
negative impact on confidence, actually prolonging ECB policies

<https://twitter.com/carstenbrzeski/status/723140840760041473> 
And having left interest rates on hold today, Draghi’s message to the eurozone 
was effectively ‘trust us, it’s working’.

Our policies work, they are effective. Just give them time to fully display 
their effects.”

And finally, Draghi gets the Brexit question.

Q: Is the ECB worried that the UK’s referendum over European Union membership 
will hurt the recovery?

The discussion about Brexit has already had some significant consequences on 
markets, Draghi replies, such as the decline in the value of sterling.

He won’t speculate about the outcome of the vote on June 23, but says that ECB 
staff think there is only a “limited” risk that it might endanger the eurozone 
recovery.
