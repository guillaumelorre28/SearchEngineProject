The passing of Gough Whitlam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gough-whitlam> has reminded me of 
many things. How free tertiary education helped many escape the cycle of 
poverty. That free medical care for all is worth protecting. It has also 
reminded me of the power of the arts and of a good political campaign song.

For every montage that celebrates Gough’s life over the next few days and 
weeks, the soundtrack will be the same:It’s Time 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jykIqQxEOw>, the Labor Party campaign song of 
1972 that saw a who’s who of Australian personalities (sporting and cultural) 
singing along, accompanied by a particularly funky bass line, some fabulously 
bouffant 70s hairstyles and some seriously tight skivvies. In my dreams, I 
imagine all the participants all rushed off to a key party post recording. It’s 
that good.

 Gough Whitlam’s It’s Time. 
These catchy political tunes and group singalongs are, sadly, no more. The 
bulk of what gets served up at election time are solemn advertisements full of 
serious voices telling us how everything the other lot do is wrong and how 
everyone on the other side is bad. It’s pretty depressing.

 Bob Hawke’s 1987 campaign jingle. 
Where are the uplifting ditties about what we can all do to make things 
better? Imagine if next election we saw Tony Abbott sing with gung-ho 
enthusiasm about hislove of coal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/tony-abbott-says-coal-is-good-for-humanity-while-opening-mine>
 or Bill Shorten belt out a moving ditty about how he stands by the government 
“on some issues”? This absence of song is indicative of an era where politics 
itself seems particularly artless – in more ways than one.

 John Howard’s 1996 election jingle. 
I was but a babe in arms when Australians were singing along to It’s Time, but 
it strikes me that in the 1970s and 80s there was wide eyed enthusiasm for our 
country’s future over the current preference for naval gazing and an irrational 
fear of the outside.

Have we forgotten that Australians used to love writing a song to get everyone 
involved? We had footy songs at home (the VFL’s Up There Cazaly 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxM8XB61ZvU>) and songs for events that 
showcased our wares to everyone else (Together We’ll Show The World 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i26zqYXfZHo> at the World Expo 88 in 
Brisbane). Sure, these songs for all occasions sound like they’ve been penned 
by a jingle writer who advertorials on regional TV (in the case of It’s Time 
and Up There Cazaly, they were), but at least we had a go at having some fun.

These days, political power brokers go the lazy and/or stealth route and steal 
an already established song by a famous artist, which tells nothing of the 
politicians’ true intent. The pollies then wait to see how long it takes to be 
served with a cease and desist court order for appropriating it.


A good old hearty singalong could win votes and do the long-suffering public 
wonders. Singing is medically proven to make people feel better. A campaign 
song might lift us all out of the quagmire of negativity, fear-mongering and 
anger that has infected the Australian political and media landscape for so 
long.

And if Tony and his political mates are yet to be convinced of getting 
campaign songs back on the agenda, I offer this: There are plenty of words that 
rhyme with “No cuts”.

Oh, I forgot, that was for the last election. My bad.
