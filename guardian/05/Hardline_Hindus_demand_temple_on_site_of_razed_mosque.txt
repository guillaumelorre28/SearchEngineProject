 Thousands of Hindu monks tried to march on India's parliament in New Delhi 
yesterday, demanding the right to build a temple at Ayodhya on the site of a 
razed mosque, an issue that has split the country.
The leaders of the march, which was blocked by heavily armed police, 
threatened bigger protests next month.

"We should be allowed to build the temple," said Acharya Giriraj Kishore, 
leader of the hardline Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), an ally of the ruling Hindu 
nationalist Bharatiya Janata party.

"We'll be launching a much stronger agitation next month," he warned, two days 
before four state elections.
