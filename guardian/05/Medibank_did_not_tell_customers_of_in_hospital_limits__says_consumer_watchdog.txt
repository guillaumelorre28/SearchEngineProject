The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has started proceedings 
alleging that Medibank subsidiary, ahm, deliberately failed to give members 
notice about new limits, despite previously claiming that it would do so.

its brand and reputation could suffer, and that patients only became aware when 
they were unexpectedly confronted with out-of-pocket expenses when receiving 
treatment in hospital.
