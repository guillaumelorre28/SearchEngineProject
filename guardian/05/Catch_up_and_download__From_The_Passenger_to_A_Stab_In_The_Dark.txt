The Passenger
The latest Euro drama from All 4’s munificent foreign-language curator Walter 
Presents is a Gallic crime series not set in built-up Paris or Marseille but 
among the sprawling, verdant vineyards of Bordeaux. In this unlikely locale, a 
serial killer recreates images from classical mythology – first up, severing a 
man’s head and replacing it with that of a bull to create a grim approximation 
of a minotaur. A gripping, six-part whodunnit with impressive producer and 
writer credits in the form of Luc Besson and crime writer Jean-Christophe 
Grangé respectively.
Available from Friday

Netflix

Pacific Heat
This latest Netflix offering is a slick, knowing animated comedy set in a 
brightly rendered version of Australia’s Gold Coast. It follows the exploits of 
a self-parodically glamorous, chiselled and tanned undercover police unit as 
they tackle everything from petty criminals to international drug cartels. At 
this early stage, the show is more than a little indebted to FX’s Archer in 
both tone and visual grammar. Hopefully, it’ll establish its own identity as it 
beds in.

BBC3

Brainwashing Stacey
Even in its iPlayer-only incarnation, BBC3 continues to pack Stacey Dooley off 
to the world’s more contested corners. In the first of this new series, poor 
Stacey is spending time with some US anti-abortion campaigners. The assignment 
takes the form of a summer camp hosted by the Survivors organisation, during 
which Dooley will subject herself to a potentially devastating tidal wave of 
virulently anti-science and anti-commonsense rhetoric and assess the effect is 
has, both on her and the unfortunate American youngsters who are involved in 
this stuff for real. As gauche as Dooley’s offerings can sometimes be, this is 
given an extra edge of potency by the knowledge that these people now have 
representation in the White House.

This collaboration between the BBC, virtual reality studio VRTOV and Google’s 
Daydream headset is one of those exploratory projects that feels like an 
admirable attempt to explore a version of the future. It’s an immersive, 
interactive film that premiered at this year’s Tribeca film festival and is, 
essentially, a virtual world which you’ll be free to wander in and explore. The 
tone suggests a psychedelic Where The Wild Things Are, which should make it 
irresistible to kids and big kids alike.

Podcast

A Stab In The Dark
These days, no TV platform can really consider itself complete if it can’t 
offer some sort of crime-related podcast or serial. This UKTV offering is a 
decent addition, drawing together some big-hitting guests. In the opening 
episode, crime writer Val McDermid and former BBC head of drama Kate Harwood 
join Mark Billingham to discuss the changing representation of female 
crime-fighters over the years. Subsequent episodes feature the likes of David 
Morrissey and Ann Cleeves.
