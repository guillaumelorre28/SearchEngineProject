 Backbencher Ann Clwyd was tonight elected as the new chair of the 
parliamentary Labour party.
Ms Clwyd beat rival Tony Lloyd by 167 to 156 in a vote of Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs.

The job has assumed new importance after Labour's majority was cut at the 
election. Ms Clwyd immediately promised to work to help unite the party.

"For many years I was in opposition," she said.

"I don't want to be in opposition again and I am sure the majority of my 
colleagues don't either. If there is any problem with dissent I hope we can 
somehow avoid that becoming more damaging."

The Cynon Valley MP said she was not troubled by the small scale of her 
victory.

"A win is a win," she said.

The election will inevitably be viewed through the prism of the Iraq war. Ms 
Clwyd is Tony Blair's human rights envoy to Iraq and an advocate of the 
overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Former Foreign Office minister Mr Lloyd was a 
critic of the war.

The vote was called after previous chair Jean Corston left the Commons at the 
election. She was given a peerage.
