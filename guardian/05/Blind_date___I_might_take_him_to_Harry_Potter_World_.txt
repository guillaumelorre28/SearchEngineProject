Matty on Ross




What were you hoping for?
At best, a bit of a spark. At worst, a funny story to tweet.

First impressions?
He was there before me, and I was early. Plus a warm smile, and tattoos, which 
I liked.

What did you talk about?
His transcontinental upbringing, his terrible taste in music, my obsession 
with reality TV and the fact that he hasn’t read Harry Potter.

Any awkward moments?
None – not even when he mispronounced Slytherin.

Good table manners?
Perfect. He let me try his steak.

Best thing about Ross?
He was interested in me and what I had to say.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Sure – I can’t imagine it would go badly.

Describe him in three words
Genuine, intelligent, Ravenclaw <http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ravenclaw>.

What do you think he made of you?
A nice guy, hopefully. I did talk a lot, which isn’t like me.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, it was getting late.

And... did you kiss?
A peck on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d have had the post-dessert drink the waiter offered us.

Marks out of 10?
Nine.

Would you meet again?
We swapped numbers. I might take him to Harry Potter World or something.




Ross on Matty




What were you hoping for?
Just to meet someone new and have an evening out.

First impressions?
Good smile and nice eyes.

What did you talk about?
East London, New Zealand, where he grew up, my tattoos. And Brexit, of course.

Any awkward moments?
Worrying we had accidentally ordered another bottle of wine.

Good table manners?
Impeccable. He even let me try a bit of his lamb.

Best thing about Matty?
Good chat, nice eyes.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Sure.

Describe him in three words
Fun, friendly company.

What do you think he made of you?
No idea. I told him my knowledge of New Zealand came from Lord Of The Rings and
Xena: Warrior Princess, <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112230/> which didn’t 
kill the evening.
