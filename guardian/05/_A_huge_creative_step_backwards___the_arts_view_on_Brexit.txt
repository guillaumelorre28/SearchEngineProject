The prospect of leaving the EU has been variously described as a “nightmare”, 
“artistic isolation” and a “huge creative step backwards” by arts leaders 
surveyed by the Guardian.

The vast majority of figures contacted, and many more responding to a Guardian 
appeal, said they were against the UK leaving the union for both practical and 
emotional reasons.

Many voiced fears about barriers to the free movement of labour and the loss 
of access to EU arts funding.

Alistair Spalding, chief executive of Sadler’s Wells theatre in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sadlers-wells>, one of the UK’s most 
internationally diverse venues, said he could not think of a single advantage 
to leaving, but foresaw many problems.

“There would be the nightmare of visa and work permit applications that we 
have to do. It is less complex for countries in the EU but that would all be 
thrown up in the air … we would have to bring in more staff to deal with it.

“Honestly, I don’t think people really understand what a nightmare it is. 
Leaving Europe, for our business, it’s bad.”

John Summers, chief executive of the Halle Orchestra in Manchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/halle-orchestra>, which employs players from 
14 countries and many visiting artists and conductors, said: “Leaving would be 
disastrous. The biggest thing that has changed in UK orchestras over the past 
10 to 20 years is the quality of players coming for audition from outside the 
UK – it has been hugely positive.”

Summers said Brexit could mean artistic isolation in the longer term. He said: 
“Music is an international language. There is no barrier and if we were to lose 
that free movement I think we could become the land without music – which is 
what Germany used to call us, the land without music.”

The Barbican’s managing director, Sir Nicholas Kenyon, said: “My approach is: 
we are all Europeans now if you look at the range of co-productions that we now 
have that depend on the free movement of talent between European countries.”


Kenyon stressed that leaving Europe would not mean the end of partnerships and 
collaborations – “the arts are ingenious, the arts will always find ways of 
doing things” – but added: “Being in is an immense benefit in terms of the 
possibilities of creating these co-productions.”

That was a view echoed by the Southbank Centre’s artistic director, Jude 
Kelly. She said: “We see creative collaboration being supported by remaining 
part of the EU. I’m not saying it could not happen by being outside the EU, but 
it would be that much more difficult, that much trickier.”

The Guardian contacted several arts leaders directly and also put out an appeal
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/10/what-impact-would-brexit-have-on-people-working-in-arts-and-culture>
 for readers who work in the arts and culture sector to come forward with their 
views. The overwhelming response was that the UK should remain in Europe.

Munira Mirza <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/muniramirza>, who for eight 
years was in charge of cultural policy in London under Boris Johnson’s 
mayorship, is in the leave camp and believes there are a number of cultural 
figures who agree but are reluctant to come out.

“They are worried about their careers and what people might think of them,” 
she said. “They assume that everybody who wants to leave the EU must be 
anti-immigration, wants to pull up the drawbridge and so on. There is a large 
number of people who see immigration has been very positive and engaging with 
the world and cooperating is the future. It is the EU which stops us doing that 
sensibly and intelligently.

“The choice is not between a closed world and an open world, we want a world 
even more open.”

Mirza rejected the idea that cultural collaboration would be more difficult 
and said it could be a spur to developing better cultural links with 
Commonwealth nations and emerging economies.

Another practical argument in the debate is, of course, money. The Creative 
Europe fund was established in 2014, and it says it has supported 228 UK 
cultural and creative organisations and audiovisual companies, and the cinema 
distribution of 84 UK films in other European countries with grants totalling 
€40m (£30m). 

Spalding said Sadler’s Wells had recently benefited from €500,000 for various 
projects, which he admitted had been “hellishly complicated” to get. “It isn’t 
easy but it’s there and it is definitely worth it.”

Mirza said her dealings with Europe were characterised by uncertainty, 
bureaucracy and unnecessary monitoring. “I have met people who have received EU 
funding and regretted it,” she said.

The remain camp also cites the transformative success of European capital of 
culture status on cities. The last UK city to hold the title was Liverpool in 
2008, and the next one is due in 2023.

One of the key figures in the Liverpool events was Grange Hill creator Phil 
Redmond, who chaired the city of culture panel. He said he did not think the 
argument held water, particularly given that the European commission gives 
comparatively little money. “I think we were promised €600,000 to print 
letterheads or whatever, but I’m not even sure that arrived.”

Official documents show Liverpool received just over £800,000 from the 
commission to “support directly the European dimension of the Liverpool ECoC” – 
a drop in the ocean compared with the £130m overall events budget.

Redmond said the European title was no more than a badge, a permission to 
start talking and doing. “You could just change it, it’s only one word … 
‘non-European capital of culture’.”

Redmond is also chair of National Museums Liverpool, and he said Brexit would 
have little effect in this area, as the museums were developing links with 
countries in South America, eastern Europe and Asia.

“Liverpool has always been a global city. We spend too much time focusing on 
London. We need to look at the wider field, it is not just Europe, there is a 
whole world out there.”

Although he declared himself neutral on the EU debate, Redmond said he could 
see advantages for the arts in leaving.

“If we do exit there will probably be a short-term boost for the arts in the 
UK because there’ll be curiosity … why did these guys decide to come out? 
They’ll want to come and investigate and talk to artists,” he said.

“And then if it is more difficult to bring over European artists, perhaps 
we’ll get more reinvestment in our own talent.”


It is perhaps the emotional arguments that hold more sway in the arts world. 
David Lan, artistic director of the Young Vic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/young-vic>, which has led the way in forging 
partnerships with European companies and was instrumental in bringing the 
directorIvo Van Hove <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ivo-van-hove> to the 
UK, said the partnerships and collaboration would continue if the UK left, but 
added: “It would be a curious thing. I’d have to spend a lot of time saying it 
wasn’t my idea.”

Lan said the UK had much to learn. “Many of the European theatre companies are 
way ahead of us in terms of imagination, sophistication, intelligence, skill, 
acting … certainly in terms of how to run a company effectively – way ahead of 
us.

“To not be part of that, to fall into the old ‘we know better’, the same old 
complacencies …” he concluded.
