The awkward squad

Beata Szydło, Poland


Szydło 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/szydo-beata-szydo-polands-putative-pm-emerges-from-obscurity>
 has been leading opposition to benefit changes and other measures that could 
affect Poles living in the UK. The Visegrád four are ready to make some 
concessions on welfare benefits, but only if they get guarantees that 
restrictions on child benefit will not copied by other countries and applied to 
other areas, such as pensions.

Bohuslav Sobotka, Czech Republic

Sobotka is the chair of the Visegrád countries. A social democrat, he is less 
Eurosceptic than some of his predecessors and is staunchly opposed to UK plans 
to cut child benefit for children living outside Britain.

François Hollande, France

The president has not made many public interventions into the British debate, 
but behind the scenes French officials have played a vital role in watering 
down the British text. France is concerned that the UK could walk away with 
strong protections for the City of London, which would undermine the smooth 
functioning of the eurozone. Paris isfighting a rearguard action against UK 
demands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-european-union-summit-brussels>
 to get a special procedure written into EU law that would allow non-eurozone 
countries to slow down eurozone laws.

Charles Michel, Belgium


Small countries like the EU because it stands up for their interests against 
bigger powers. Nowhere is this more true than Belgium. Its Francophone, liberal 
prime minister has been a staunch defender of the interests of the EU in the UK 
negotiations. Belgium has been leading efforts to defend the “ever-closer 
union” provision of the treaties. Reportedly told Cameron recently: “If you 
want to go, just go. We will not let you ruin Europe by staying.”

Belgium, supported by France, wants to make it clear that Britain could not 
seek to rewrite the terms of its EU membership again if the UK were to vote to 
leave in a referendum. The would kill off the idea of a second referendum, 
ensuring that any deal agreed at this summit would be definitive.

Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg

As a small country and one of the EU’s founding six, Luxembourg has been one 
of the strongest opponents of aspects of the UK’s renegotiation, including 
demands on ever-closer union.

Taavi Rõivas, Estonia

Estonia is one of the newest members of the eurozone and has proved to be a 
tough opponent of UK hopes of boosting the rights of countries outside the 
single currency.

Viktor Orbán, Hungary

The combative prime minister has said he agrees with most of the UK agenda 
but, along with other central European countries, has opposed some of the 
benefit changes.

Robert Fico, Slovakia

Outspoken Fico doesn’t have a good word to say about the EU, but he is in 
favour of freedom of movement that allows Slovaks to work in the UK.

Māris Kučinskis, Latvia

Nominated as prime minister in January, Kučinskis is another newcomer to the 
EU summit.

Dalia Grybauskaitė, Lithuania

Lithuania’s straight-talking president knows how EU summits work: “I think 
everyone will have their own drama and then we will agree.”

Romanians in the UK differently to British nationals.

Angela Merkel, Germany


A vital ally. The German chancellor has said she shares Cameron’s view 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/17/merkel-eu-uk-germany-national-interest-cameron-justified>
 that non-eurozone countries should not be sidelined and that member states 
should be able to protect their benefits systems. But – contrary to tabloid 
stereotype and Team Cameron’s earlier assumptions – Merkel does not pull all 
the strings in the chancelleries and palaces of Europe.

Enda Kenny, Ireland

Dublin is seeking to ensure that Irish citizens are not included in any 
emergency brake, to reflect the ancient ties between Britain and Ireland.

Werner Faymann, Austria

The Austrian chancellor is facing calls to introduce a local version of the 
emergency brake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/david-camerons-emergency-brake-wins-fans-across-the-continent>
that would allow Vienna to stop paying EU migrants’ benefits.

Mark Rutte, Netherlands

As a liberal and head of country that voted down an EU treaty in 2005, Rutte 
is a natural ally of Cameron.

Juha Sipilä, Finland

A former IT businessman, Finland’s liberal prime minister has been fairly 
relaxed about the changes being pursued by Cameron.

Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark

Denmark would also like to introduce a homegrown version of the restrictions 
on child benefit the UK is pushing for.

Alexis Tsipras, Greece

With unemployment rates nudging 25% and Greece at risk of being thrown out of 
the EU’s Schengen border zone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/greece-warned-control-borders-schengen-european-commission>
, as it struggles to cope with a big influx of refugees, Tsipras has plenty of 
other issues to worry about. Definitely wouldn’t be keen on a Brexit, for fear 
of it setting a dangerous precedent.

Miro Cerar, Slovenia

Cameron’s EU travels meant that a British prime minister made a first-ever 
visit to Slovenia since its independence in 1991.

Matteo Renzi, Italy

prove a helpful voice around the table. The former mayor of Florence recently 
told Bloomberg it washis “duty to support David 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/renzi-says-he-s-betting-on-cameron-sees-anti-brexit-deal-soon>
”. Renzi, who has been leading the charge against Europe’s austerity economics 
and calling for more flexibility on EU budget rules, could be looking for his 
own special opt-outs on EU law.

Stefan Löfven, Sweden

Sweden is a traditional ally of the UK in the councils of Brussels, but the 
centre-left government is wary that some of the British proposals on cutting 
red tape could weaken employment rights and environmental protection.

Nicos Anastasiades, Cyprus

Cyprus has to trade off its role as a traditional British ally against 
multibillion-euro bailouts it has received as a member of the eurozone.

Joseph Muscat, Malta

Another small country. The island of Malta has the smallest population in the 
EU, with just 429,000 people, which makes it smaller than Manchester, but still 
a player at EU summits.
