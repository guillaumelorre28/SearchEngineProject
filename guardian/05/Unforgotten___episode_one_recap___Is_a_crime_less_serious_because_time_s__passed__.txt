Spoiler alert: this blog is for viewers of Unforgotten on ITV on Thursdays. 
Don’t read on if you haven’t seen the first episode.

Welcome to Unforgotten, the drama where the past just won’t stay buried.


Writer Chris Lang’s inspiration came from recent high-profile historical 
crimes and a curious feeling of sympathy he felt for old men suddenly under the 
media spotlight for decades-old alleged offences.

“I kept asking myself what it must be like for someone who is convicted of a 
crime 30 or 40 years old, what it must be like to have lived a whole life 
effectively pretending to be something but you’re not.”

Operation Yewtree casts its shadow once again.

What remains 

When human remains are discovered in the ruins of 27 Arlingham Place, 
Willesden, London DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and DS Sunny Khan (Sanjeev 
Bhaskar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/24/sanjeev-bhaskar-real-life-indian-summers-shimla>
) work the case with the scantest of evidence. Once they establish foul play 
they spend the rest of the episode chasing after the victim’s identity. It’s a 
daunting task given the timeframe the body might have been buried for.

“Could be talking 5,000 years,” says Rawlins the forensics guy. Do we need CSI 
orTime Team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/23/time-team-a-tv-gem>?

The cops 

Your typical TV plod partnership is defined by conflict but Cassie and Sunny 
happily disrupt that convention. There’s no seething resentment, sexual tension 
or substance abuse to resolve and they both seem pretty happy with the other. 
If anything you’d call it an older sister-younger brother vibe between them and 
neither looks like ripping off their badge and going rogue anytime soon.

The investigation 

27 Arlingham Place has been a private home, a dole office and a homeless 
hostel in its time so some heavy human traffic has passed through its doors.

After forensics discover a car key near the remains, the serial number narrows 
it down to a car manufactured in 1965. They eventually trace its gutted husk 
back to a farm building. In a skip nearby they discover a bag with a comb, a 
shirt and a 1976 diary. James Niall Sullivan is the name and we have our 
victim, who has been missing since July 1976.

There are a list of names and phone numbers scribbled in the diary, too, and 
we follow four of those potential suspects as they go about their present-day 
lives.

Sir Philip Cross 

We join Sir Philip sipping champagne in Westminster at the moment of his 
greatest triumph. He is made the government’s entrepreneur czar – a position 
with clout, prestige and a lordship thrown in. He’s a bit of an Alan Sugar – a 
working-class boy made good with a disarming media-friendly bluntness. He 
celebrates with his wife Shirley and his lawyer daughter Belle, although his 
son Josh seems more concerned with getting the old man’s name with his new 
title on his company’s letterhead.

“Never asked my old for a brass farthing,” Philip rebukes him “Wouldn’t have 
dared.”

Yes, your lordship, we get it – you pulled yourself up by your bootstraps. But 
how many people achieve his career altitude without piling a few skeletons in 
the closet or, I don’t know, underneath a homeless hostel?

Lizzie Wilton 

It’s a short enough journey from Westminster to White City but Lizzie’s life 
could barely be further removed from Sir Philip’s. While helping her husband 
Ray run a community football team for local youths, she forms a relationship 
with promising student Curtis as he prepares for his GCSEs, plying him with 
pizza and John Steinbeck.

A plaque in the team’s changing room gives us some background on the Wiltons.

In memory of Michael Ray Wilton 1991-2006 

Beloved and only son of Elizabeth and Ray.

Always in our hearts.

So Lizzie is no stranger to tragedy but no clue yet as to what her connection 
is with Jimmy or Arlingham Place.

Robert Greaves 

As Father Robert pelts along in his motor with boyband music blasting from the 
stereo he looks like England’s most carefree priest. There’s a loving wife at 
home, two grownup daughters and an adult education class for deprived women 
keeping him busy, along with the usual parish business. Overall the impression 
is of someone who is maddening to live with, often bullish but whose heart is 
in the right place – nothing sinister to see here.

And yet there is that Father Ted style discrepancy in the accounts that Geoff 
from the diocese keeps on badgering him about. There’s £2,000 unaccounted for 
from the past three years and the look on Robert’s face after Geoff leaves him 
suggests that this one is not easily explained.

Eric Slater 

Elderly wheelchair user Eric struggles to cope with his wife Claire’s dementia 
in their bungalow in Ely, Cambridgeshire. Their son Matt thinks they are fine 
where they are but it’s his brother Leslie who spends time with them, sees 
their mother’s deterioration and worse, the state of the toilet. He’s been 
suggesting sheltered housing to them for some time but Eric won’t hear of it.

After Claire scalds herself in the kitchen she tells Eric she just wants to be 
looked after. She knows she’s not safe and he knows it too yet he tells her 
desperately: “We can’t leave.” He is hiding something, but what?

First impressions 

Unforgotten is clearly a slow burner so I’m not worried that there is no 
jawdropper of a scene, pyrotechnics or shock twist – not every show needs to be
Line of Duty <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/line-of-duty>. There’s 
nothing showy about Nicola Walker’s work – she’s an economical actor with a 
powerful presence who can play tough yet fragile as well as anyone.

The show will live and die though on the stories of the core four suspects and 
whether or not it conjures up the “emotional anomaly” Chris Lang talks about of 
the sympathy for someone whose life is turned upside down by some horrendous 
act in their past. I’m intrigued to know how Philip, Lizzie, Robert and Eric’s 
pasts intersect and how they ended up in Jimmy’s diary.

What are your thoughts? Has it hooked you yet?

Notes & queries  

Yes, that is One Direction’s Story Of My Life 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-TE_Ys4iwM> Father Robert sings along to in 
his car. No one is condoning it but it does not qualify as a historical crime.

“Is a crime less serious because time’s passed?” Cassie certainly thinks so 
but with significant police resources already expended on this long-forgotten 
crime you have to imagine she’ll encounter some resistance from bean counters 
further up the food chain at some point.

“I don’t ever remember being fucking asked!” She may not be a cleric but Grace 
testifies like a preacher on being married to a man who gives all their 
possessions away.

Underneath the polite smiles at dinner there’s a masterclass in passive 
aggression from Robert when he brushes off Ellie and Tom’s objections to 
getting married in church. As his wife points out he’s got a knack of getting 
his own way.

Cassie becomes the latest in a long line of artists to cover Bobby Hebb’s 
Sunny but for some reason her partner doesn’t seem too thrilled with the 
rendition.
