Dan Lyons is the former Forbes magazine senior editor who found online fame as 
the writer behind the parodic Fake Steve Jobs blog. When he lost his job at
Newsweek in 2013, he decided to join Boston tech startup HubSpot as a 
“marketing fellow”.

It didn’t end well, and Lyons has now written a book about the experience 
calledDisrupted: Ludicrous Misadventures in the Tech Start-Up Bubble. He has 
also been a writer on satirical sitcomSilicon Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/29/silicon-valley-satire-mark-zuckerberg-san-francisco-tech-bay-startup>
.

As a tech journalist, startups weren’t an entirely new world to you. But were 
you taken by surprise?
It was a big revelation. I had a lot of ideas about what it would be like. 
They turned out to be wrong or incomplete. One big thing, for example: I always 
thought that when these tech guys go on about changing the world and making it 
a better place that once us reporters went home and they were on their own they 
sort of laughed. That they were cynical and it was bullshit.

I didn’t expect that there were people who really believed that stuff. I was 
really taken aback by that. I thought, I can do that fake changing the world 
shit. I can do that marketing song and dance, I know the racket. But I was 
shocked by that – that people had really drunk the Kool-Aid.

One point you make in your book is that the financial structure of startups is 
less about creating new products than shifting money to a few fortunate 
individuals. Was that a shock?
You think I’d have known that beforehand. I think I’d never seen it that 
clearly. It was a revelation to me that to some of these guys, the companies 
were secondary to extracting money. The companies were just vehicles to achieve 
that.

People in startup-land see themselves as really good people even when they’re 
doing something that’s very bad

Is it a concern in the States that people are able to make hundreds of 
millions of dollars from unprofitable companies?
I think it might be in this year’s presidential election, among the Bernie 
Sanders crowd. InSilicon Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley>, bringing that up is 
seen as stupid and naive. They say I just don’t understand how it works.

Now there is a little bit of reality setting in. You see companies are trying 
to demonstrate that they can make a profit, but there’s still a big part of 
Silicon Valley that thinks that’s a stupid idea – to make money. I don’t think 
there’s been a big debate about it.

The word “bubble” is in your subtitle. Do you think there is a bubble and that 
it’s set to burst?
I do think we’re in a bubble in terms of valuation. There is this expression 
on Wall Street: “The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain 
solvent.” It’s been on the edge of popping for so long, now I don’t even know. 
If you look at markets they typically revert to a historical mean.

The double meaning of the bubble for me is not just a financial bubble but a 
psychological bubble. People in startup-land live inside it. They see 
themselves as really good people even when they’re doing something that’s very 
bad. There’s a huge disconnect from reality in the tech world.

Have you any feedback from HubSpot on the book?
I personally directly haven’t but they wrote a response to the book called 
Undisrupted 
<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/undisrupted-hubspots-reflections-disrupted-dan-lyons-dharmesh-shah>
, published the week after the book came out. It was a long essay about why it 
was not true or I’d got things wrong. I haven’t heard anything directly. I 
wouldn’t expect to.

One senior HubSpot executive was sacked and another resigned 
<http://uk.businessinsider.com/hubspot-fired-a-top-exec-over-book-scandal-2015-7>
 after allegedly trying to get a draft manuscript of your book before 
publication. Do you think you were a threat to the company’s share price?
I could see that they would worry about that, that it might hurt their share 
price. I don’t think what they did was the appropriate way to respond to that. 
Pretty nasty stuff.

I could see them worrying that it might hurt the share price, but it certainly 
hasn’t hurt the share price. I don’t think that it’s hurt them at all. And it 
wasn’t the intent. I was trying to write a book about me and personal invention 
and the craziness of the startup world.

There’s a lot of anger in the book. Was it cathartic writing it?
I think it was very cathartic. There was part of me that thought I should just 
shut up about this and just move on, but I thought it was such a crazy world 
and someone needs to call bullshit on a lot of this stuff. It was cathartic to 
say if I’m going to do this I might as well say what I’m thinking.

You examine the question of ageism – how rare it is for someone to be over 40 
in a startup? Could it be argued that only younger people understand this new 
culture?
Maybe there’s a tiny bit of legitimacy to it, but I think the real motivation 
is saving money. They hire young people because it’s cheap labour, and you 
throw them out after a couple of years without any equity. That’s the racket.

I wanted to write a book about what it’s like to be 50 and trying to reinvent 
yourself – that struggle. There are all these books and inspirational speakers 
talking about being a lifelong learner and it’s so great to reinvent yourself, 
the brand of you. And I wanted to say, you know, it’s not like that. It’s 
actually really painful.

It takes you to some places you’d rather not go and you confront things about 
yourself you’d rather not think about or admit to. It was a really unpleasant 
experience. A big part of it is being forced to confront my own mortality. I’d 
never felt old before.

How useful was the experience for your work as a writer on Silicon Valley?
Well a little bit, but not a huge amount. My role on Silicon Valley was so 
small that I didn’t have a lot of influence anyway in the show. There are four 
guys who really write that show and run that show and then six or eight hanging 
out in a room kicking in a few bits.

I kicked in a few things from my experience. Some of it made its way into the 
show. The company in the show isn’t anything like HubSpot. I keep hoping the 
show will evolve into being in an office with a kindergarten culture and all. 
But I think the guys who run that show are committed to keeping them in the 
house for ever.

Are you going to continue writing on it?
No. I didn’t go back this year and I’m in the midst of trying to develop a 
comedy based onDisrupted but more about the family. It’s very frustrating to be 
the little guy sitting at the end of the table. It’s fun and cool and you’re in 
Hollywood on a fancy studio lot and all that. But being a staffer on someone’s 
show is less scintillating that you might imagine.

Did you ever think that if startup companies read this book, there were things 
they could learn from it?
I was hoping that there would be a corrective and people might say that this 
age bias is not good and we should think about doing things differently. I 
think the issues around diversity of all kinds are really a huge problem in the 
startup world. I was hoping that. At the same time I don’t think any of them 
listen.

Was there anything you enjoyed about the startup world and think other 
companies might learn something from?
There’s a lot of energy and a lot of fun. There is this sense in places like 
HubSpot that we can do anything. There’s a mindset at old incumbent places 
where a lot of people are ready to say: “That won’t work.”

In the world of startups, partly out of being naive, there are people who say 
“let’s try it” – they have openness to new ideas. Part of that is from hiring 
young people and giving them responsibility.

The whole idea of having ping-pong tables is kind of cool. There are 
definitely things other companies can take from that world. I just think you 
need to choose selectively.
