<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/25/andy-holmes-obituary>, 26 
October) in the 1980s through his GP brother Simon, a friend and neighbour 
who was the rowing team's doctor at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. Andy was of 
course very powerfully built and had great presence, but not in any macho way.

When a big family party involved everyone going off to the local ice-rink, I 
was soon slithering around hopelessly out of control on the ice. Everyone 
laughed but Andy: he calmly intervened and showed me a few basics, enabling me 
not only to regain my dignity but to speed around, if not quite like Torvill 
and Dean, at least without further mishap. I'll never forget Andy's small 
moment of kindness, which made him seem even more of a sporting hero in my 
eyes.
