Captive (available 9 December)
Captive could well be crowned this Christmas’s Making a Murderer-style sleeper 
hit. Made by the Oscar-winning producers of Man on Wire and Searching for Sugar 
Man, it’s a slick documentary series about hostage situations, explained by the 
people who lived through them. Every one is an eye-opener, from the prison riot 
in Ohio (told by Muslim and Aryan Brotherhood prisoners, and the warden they 
waged war against) to a Coca-Cola kidnap in Brazil and the retired couple held 
hostage for over a year by Somali pirates.

Hip-hop Evolution (available now)
First shown on HBO, this four-part documentary about the birth of hip-hop 
stars everyone from Chuck D to Grandmaster Flash, Russell Simmons and LL Cool J.

Trollhunters (available 23 December)
Guillermo del Toro’s animated series about a teenager who accidentally finds 
the Amulet of Daylight, which turns him into a – you guessed it – champion 
Trollhunter. And if he refuses his new role, trolls will destroy the whole 
human world.

novel of the same name.

The Crown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/04/the-crown-review-netflix-100m-gamble-on-the-queen-pays-off-royally>
After this annus horribilis, forget the Queen’s speech on Christmas day and 
spend 10 hours in the company of Claire Foy’s Her Madge instead. Guaranteed, 
there’ll be more intrigue, more gaffes – and more sex (both horse and human).

Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life
It’s frosty outside and the world has swiftly become a disaster zone. Why not 
watch the four new feature-length episodes about Rory and Lorelai, the 
fast-talking, wise-cracking mother-daughter duo?It’s a beautifully wrapped 
gift, after all.

Last Chance U 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/02/last-chance-u-american-football-sports-documentary>
You needn’t have even the vaguest grasp of American football to get hooked on 
this inspiring sports documentary (I’m speaking as someone who doesn’t – and 
who has.) If you have yet to meet Ronald Ollie and Miss Wagner and Coach Buddy 
Stephens, please head straight to Scooba, Mississippi and join them.
