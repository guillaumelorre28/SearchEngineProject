Sales of individual savings accounts (Isas) are expected to fall by a quarter 
by April as worried retail investors shun volatile stock markets.

The Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds (Autif) predicted the slump 
after it produced figures yesterday showing a fall of more than 5% in January 
compared to the same month last year.

Gross sales of Isas fell to £637m in value during the first month of the year, 
compared to £673.5m in January 2000, Autif said.

A spokeswoman said annual unit sales were likely to reach 3m at the end of the 
tax year in April, as against sales of 4m for the year to April 2000.

Many investors are nursing large losses after a year in which all leading 
stock markets slipped into negative territory. Funds that invested heavily in 
internet-related companies proved popular in the first three months of last 
year but were big losers as the rerating of the technology, media and telecom 
(TMT) sector began to affect prices.

In the year to the end of December 2000 the technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 
39.3%. Investors who stuck with the previously successful tracker funds were 
also undone after the FTSE 100 fell 10.2% and the Dow Jones 6.18%.

Sales of specialist funds, which include the TMT sector, fell to less than 4% 
of total gross sales in January, down from a peak of around 16% in the same 
period last year.

Investors have switched to broader-based funds. In January, company funds and 
funds investing in Europe - excluding Britain - were the most popular sectors 
among retail investors.

Overall, savings and investments sales figures registered a rise, however. Net 
sales of unit trusts, open-ended investment companies, Isas and Peps were ahead 
of January 2000 at £1.8bn compared to £616.5m a year earlier.

Total gross sales were up 23% on January 2000 at £4.5bn. 

The increase suggests that, while the number of people taking up their £7,000 
Isa entitlement this year has shrunk, those investors that remain are 
increasing their holdings in non-Isa funds.
