It has been a big couple of weeks for music lovers. The trouble began with U2 
turning up uninvited and gatecrashing the party in our private iTunes 
collections, gifting ustheir new album

 for free.

This little bit of electronic shazammery caused a terrific stir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/19/u2-apple-collaborate-non-piratable-interactive-format-music-albums>
, and after much kerfuffle, iTunes backtracked and releaseda special program 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/15/apple-u2-album-itunes-delete>
 that would take the album away for those disgruntled by the dump. Think of it 
as a post-party iTunes carpet clean to get rid of any unwelcome stains and 
odour left by Bono and the lads.

Then, without notice, Radiohead’s Thom Yorke dropped a solo album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/26/thom-yorke-tomorrows-modern-boxes-bittorrent>
 via BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file-sharing service usually associated with 
illegal downloading. What Yorke’s gone and done by offeringhis album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/29/thom-yorke-tomorrows-modern-boxes-review-distribution>
 for $6 on such a service is a little like selling a legal, official DVD at a 
market among the illegal movies for sale that are always shakily filmed on some 
bloke’s camera phone. It’s an interesting move and one that may helpestablish a 
new power player 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/26/bittorrent-thom-yorke-major-labels-music>
 in the cut-throat world of music distribution.

Whether or not people will delve deep into the BitTorrent dungeon to purchase 
the entire album, still remains to be seen. But together, U2 and Yorke have 
done a cracking job ofattracting the headlines and publicity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/13/has-rocknroll-sold-out-u2-apple-stunt>
 required to promote their new records. They have been front and centre of the 
music news cycle.

Unfortunately, there’s a downside to all this. The chatter around the albums 
is mostly about the mode of delivery, rather than the actual songs or the art. 
Who knew that whacky distribution methods would be the only way to make the 
front page?

What does that say about our times if promo departments think the most 
interesting thing about the music they’re selling is the way we get our hands 
on it? Either the music is bad or we’ve all simply run out of ideas on how to 
sell this stuff. I’m hoping it’s the latter.

Poor U2 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/u2>. If it weren’t for their 
buckets of money and multiple houses, I’d almost feel sorry for them. Most 
people know they’ve got the new album because of the headlines, but I bet they 
haven’t listened to it yet. There’s simply no urgency. It’s as if it’s hanging 
around somewhere in our iTunes collections like an old lipstick at the bottom 
of a handbag.

With the sheer volume of digital content, it’s easier for artists to get lost 
in the “maybe” pile, no matter what stunt they pull and even if they are one of 
the biggest bands in the world.

Gone are the days when records were treasured, shared and obsessed over 
because they were far rarer commodities. Back in 1985 if you received a free 
copy of anything, even if it was rubbish, it was like Christmas and birthdays 
all rolled into one.

I’m not saying those times were better (the breadth of choice and 
accessibility of music today is a magical thing), but strangely, there is one 
thing I miss: the roadside decorations of yore where the unwound tape reel from 
discarded cassettes would blow gently in the breeze like streamers as cars sped 
past on the highway. It was our very own musical ticker tape parade.

How’s this for novelty: perhaps U2 should have released their new album on 
cassette tape instead.
