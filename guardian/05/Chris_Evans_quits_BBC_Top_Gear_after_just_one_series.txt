The BBC is understood to be negotiating with former Friends star LeBlanc – 
thought to be keen to remain on the show – for a second series. Last month, it 
was reported LeBlanc threatened to quit if Evans did not go.

The BBC confirmed that it had “no plans to replace Chris” and that it did not 
expect to make any changes to the presenting line-up. However, it described 
rumours that LeBlanc had made an ultimatum as “categorically untrue”.

In a surprise tweet announcing his departure, Evans said: “Gave it my best 
shot but sometimes that’s not enough.”

The audience for the Sunday night show has more than halved since Evans took 
over in May with Sunday’s night’s closing episode watched by just 1.9m viewers, 
down from 4.3m for the opening show. Before its relaunch, Evans told the 
Guardian he would be disappointed if the show hadfewer than 5 million viewers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/30/chris-evans-revamped-top-gear-gets-lukewarm-reception>
. When it was presented by Jeremy Clarkson, the programme attracted 8m viewers 
at its height – notably in the wake of co-presenter Richard Hammond’s 
near-fatal highspeed crash – and always reached more than 2m.

BBC management was concerned about falling ratings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/04/chris-evans-top-gear-ratings-bbc-jeremy-clarkson>
 for its most valuable show, which was worth an estimated £50m in worldwide 
sales before Clarkson left last year after assaulting a member of staff.

The decision to leave was made by Evans, but one television executive said 
that Evans had “jumped before he was pushed”. With other broadcast commitments 
including hosting the Radio 2 breakfast show, Evans struggled with a barrage of 
newspaper stories alleging poor behaviour, most recently one alleging sexual 
harassment in the 1990s.

The presenter could be questioned by officers from London’s Metropolitan 
police in the next few days. Evans has denied the claims and previously said 
the reports were a “witch-hunt” and that allegations of bullying were 
ridiculous. But Evans is understood to have buckled under the relentless 
onslaught of negative coverage. “Chris isn’t Jeremy Corbyn. He knows when it’s 
time to go,” said someone close to the show. “He now feels a real weight off 
his shoulders.”

LeBlanc, who, in contrast to Evans, has been widely praised for his onscreen 
performance, is understood to have told BBC bosses during negotiations over his 
contract that the partnership was not working. One source said LeBlanc disliked 
his co-host’s behaviour on set, though the BBC would not confirm this.

 in the Sun, an almost constant critic of Evans over the past year. Describing 
Top Gear – which has been hit by a string of staff departures – as 
“crisis-hit”, the newspaper reported that LeBlanc had “grown increasingly 
frustrated with his co-star’s rudeness and frosty attitude towards the team”.

Evans met Mark Linsey, the director of the BBC’s in-house production team, BBC 
Studios, last week to discuss the future. In a statement on Monday, Linsey 
pointed out that the show had been sold to 130 territories worldwide and said: 
“[Chris] firmly believes that the right people remain, on both the production 
team and presenting team, to take the show forward and make it the hit we want 
it to be.”

Evans is expected to receive just one third of his three-year fee to produce 
Top Gear, estimated at almost £6m for three years once all his other BBC 
commitments are included. He will not receive any payoff.

Evans said: “I have never worked with a more committed and driven team than 
the team I have worked with over the last 12 months. I feel like my standing 
aside is the single best thing I can now do to help the cause.

“I remain a huge fan of the show, always have been, always will be. I will 
continue to focus on my radio show and the allied events that it encompasses.”

Linseysaid: “Chris is stepping down from his duties on Top Gear. He says he 
gave it his best shot doing everything he could to make the show a success.

“He firmly believes that the right people remain, on both the production team 
and presenting team, to take the show forward and make it the hit we want it to 
be. The new series has so far notched up over 30m views in the UK alone and has 
already been sold to 130 territories worldwide.”

The appointment of Evans was controversial from the start after he had 
repeatedly denied he had been approached to host the show following Clarkson’s 
departure after he assaulted a member of staff.


The then BBC2 controller Kim Shillinglaw said Evans’s “knowledge of and 
passion for cars are well-known, and combined with his sheer inventiveness and 
cheeky unpredictability, he is the perfect choice to take our much-loved show 
into the future”.

But Shillinglaw lost her job before the programme went on air, the first of a 
string of senior departures to hit the show. Most notably, executive producer 
and long-time Evans collaborator Lisa Clark left before Christmas, essentially 
leaving him in charge.

The BBC made Clare Pizey responsible for the show in March, just two months 
before it aired to generally bad reviews. The Mail was scathing,described the 
revamp

 as “so bad you could practically hear the champagne corks popping at Amazon 
HQ” - a reference to Clarkson’s new car show.

Andrew Billen in the Times picked on the lack of rapport between Evans and 
LeBlanc: “Chemistry was what we were looking for here, but their badinage was 
no more than passable offcuts from an unmade transatlantic buddy movie.”

As well as the lack of chemistry on and off screen, one source close to the 
show blamed a lack of preparation because of Evans’s “endless list of other 
commitments” such as Channel 4’s TFI Friday, the Radio 2 show and Children in 
Need.

Evans hit back at tabloid claims of bullying that he was “out of control” as 
“nonsensical and facile and fictitious”. But the show also suffered a PR 
disaster when LeBlanc was filmed in a car with rally driver Ken Block doing 
“doughnuts” near the Cenotaph war memorial in London. Evans apologised 
“unreservedly” for the stunt and the scenes were never transmitted.

The next series is already in pre-production with filming set to start in 
September, without Evans.
