 The prime minister's special representative on human rights in Iraq, Ann 
Clwyd, is to become a privy counsellor, Downing Street announced today.
Ms Clwyd will be entitled to receive confidential briefings on so-called privy 
council terms, meaning she is bound by oath not to reveal their contents.

The MP for Cynon Valley since 1984 became Tony Blair's special envoy on human 
rights in Iraq in 2003.

The 67-year-old has been a member of the international development select 
committee since 1997 and vice chair of the parliamentaryLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party since 2001.

The day-to-day business of the privy council is mainly carried out by cabinet 
members. The ancient body meets about once a month, when the Queen gives formal 
approval to orders already discussed and approved by senior government 
ministers. Appointment is for life and there are currently around 530 members.

Secretaries of state automatically gain membership of the council, whose 
origins date back to the earliest days of the monarchy, when it comprised those 
appointed by the king or queen to advise on matters of state.

Ms Clwyd, who gains the title right honourable, was shadow secretary of state 
for international development from 1989 to 1992, for Wales in 1992, and for 
national heritage from 1992 to 1993.

She helped found the campaign group Indict, which lobbied for the prosecution 
of the Saddam Hussein regime for war crimes, and was one of Mr Blair's key 
allies on the Labour left when the government took the decision to go to war.
