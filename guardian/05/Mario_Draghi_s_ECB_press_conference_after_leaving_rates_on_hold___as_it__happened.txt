Summary: ECB gets ready for a summer break

That wasn’t the most dramatic or exciting press conference in the European 
Central Bank’s 18 year history.

Instead, there was a real end-of-term feeling, as Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> basically told reporters to 
come back in September and see if the ECB has decided to boost its stimulus 
programme.


Given some of the dramas we’ve seen in recent years, a dull ECB meeting should 
be welcomed (as long as it doesn’t become a habit, Mario). So what did we learn?

1) The ECB isn’t panicking about Brexit yet, although it believes it is a risk 
to the recovery.

Draghi struck a pretty reassuring tone, declaring that:


Following the UK referendum on EU membership, our assessment is that euro area 
financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with 
encouraging resilience....

What is clear is that financial markets and the banking sector have reacted in 
a fairly resilient fashion to the event.We haven’t observed any disruption 
either in financial markets or the banking sector.”

2) Assessing the full impact of Brexit will take some time. That’s why the ECB 
didn’t launch any new stimulus measures today.

Over the coming months when we have more information including new staff 
projections we’ll be in a better position to assess the underlying 
macroeconomic conditions.

3) Draghi has given eurozone politicians a nudge to provide more financial 
support for the banking sector.

The most interesting part of the press conference, I think, was Draghi’s 
comments about the non-performing loans which bedevil Europe’s banks, notably 
in Italy. More than once he hinted that a public backstop is needed to help 
banks shift their non-performing loans.

Draghi warned that these NPLs are threatening the recovery:

“The longer we have this (non-performing loan problem) in place, the less 
functioning will be the banking system, or at least will be the banks with high 
NPLs.

And so the less capable will be these banks to transmit our monetary policy 
impulses to the real economy. Also, a high level of NPLs makes banks especially 
vulnerable to the markets.”

This chart shows that Southern European countries need help the most:

<https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/756113306260238336> 
4) We might get fireworks in September.


Draghi insisted that the ECB has the “readiness, willingness and ability” to 
take fresh action, if needed, to stimulate the economy. By September, the ECB 
will have fresh economic forecasts - and a better idea of Britain’s Brexit 
plans.

5) QE might be tweaked soon.

Economists are pretty confident that the ECB needs to adjust the rules of its 
asset-purchase scheme, to allow it to buy more bonds from individual companies.

Draghi was adamant that the ECB won’t run out of things to buy, saying:

“In the past we’ve given enough evidence ... of our ability to adapt our 
purchases to reach 80 billion euros a month until March 2017 or beyond.”

That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW

Trevor Charsley of currency trading firm AFEX says Draghi’s comments show 
we’ve entered a ‘phoney war’ following the EU referendum.

“In commenting that there was no Brexit induced disruption apparent in the 
banking sector, Draghi was merely confirming that, after a knee jerk reaction 
in the markets immediately following the EU referendum, we have effectively 
entered a period of limbo or a ‘phoney war’ while we await more economic data, 
while political decisions are made and holidays taken.

This situation could last for several months, he adds:

As we receive the announcement of a plan from the UK government, a few months 
of post-Brexit economic data and a potential triggering of Article 50, the fog 
will begin to clear and we’ll see then how the central banks respond

Bank shares boosted by Draghi's comments

Mario Draghi’s call for a public backstop to help banks shed their bad loans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/21/ecb-meeting-brexit-vote-mario-draghi-retail-sales-business-live?page=with:block-5790cbbae4b0c570cc7277a2#block-5790cbbae4b0c570cc7277a2>
 has sparked a small rally in bank shares.

Reuters has the details:

Deutsche Bank shares, which opened flat, rose 3% following Draghi’s comments. 

The FTSE Italian All Shares Banks index rose nearly 2%.

The broader euro zone banking index rose 1.7%.

Traders are calculating that Draghi’s intervention could help struggling 
eurozone banks to shift their bad loans, which are dragging them down and 
hurting confidence and profitability.
Frederik Ducrozet (@fwred) 
So we got it - main ECB news is that Draghi backs the idea of public backstop 
for banks under exceptional circumstances.

Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, is quick out of the 
traps with some reaction to the ECB’s meeting:

While we think Brexit uncertainty is mainly an issue for the UK economy, there 
is also bound to be some knock-on impact on the Eurozone. With post-Brexit 
evidence still patchy, we think the ECB will wait until the September meeting 
before extending its QE timetable.

Inflation remains far below the ECB’s target of 2% and while headline 
inflation will rise later in the year, thanks to the fading impact of a lower 
oil price, underlying inflationary pressures still remain very low. Delaying 
until September will allow an assessment of any Brexit impact to be outlined in 
the new ECB staff forecasts.

Final question....

Q: European bank shares are at record lows, so is there a fundamental lack of 
confidence in the eurozone banking sector?

Draghi says that the problem is about the future profitability of banks, not 
their solvency. That’s partly due to concerns about non-performing loans (which 
is why Draghi is pushing for a new market for them to be traded).

But he is confident that this situation, and the perception in the rest of the 
world’s eyes, can be improved.

And that’s it

Now we’re DEEP into conspiracy territory...

Q: Your son is a bond dealer in London, Mr Draghi, so isn’t that a conflict of 
interest?

Draghi says that he explained five year ago that his son was a trader, not a 
bond dealer, so there is no conflict of interest. The European Parliament 
agreed at the time.

OK, we’re wandering into conspiracy territory now, with a journalist asking 
Draghi if the ECB is committed to using notes and coins as sole legal tender.

Yes. Of course. There is, says Draghi, looking a little puzzled.

Q: So why did you bury the €500 note?

We didn’t bury it, Draghi says. We decided to stop printing it from 2018 to 
stop it being used by criminals.

Draghi: Public backstop for NPLs would be very useful

Q: Could you elaborate on your comments that a public backstop is needed for 
banks with non-performing loans?

Draghi says that such a backstop would be “very useful”, but it should be 
agreed with the Commission.

The bad debts in Italy’s banking sector are a “very big problem” and it will 
take time to address them - as it has taken time in other countries, Draghi 
continues.

But the situation needs to be tackled, as:

The longer we have this in place, the less functioning will be the banking 
sector - and less effective the banks will be at transmitting our monetary 
policy.

The idea of a public backstop is likely to go down badly in Germany, which 
doesn’t like to see taxpayers on the hook for bank losses.

Expect lots of German snark about the colour of Draghi's passport after this.

Draghi is asked about the ECB’s presence in the “troika” which oversees 
eurozone bailouts.

He says it’s not his decision; it’s due to legislation passed by the European 
Parliament which wanted its expertise involved. The eurozone now has more 
expertise, but MEPs would have to pass new legislation if they want to get the 
ECB out of the Troika.

Francesco Papadia, a former senior ECB policymaker, reckons Draghi wants out:
Francesco Papadia (@FrancescoPapad1) 
#Draghi <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Draghi?src=hash> wishes to extricate the 
ECB from the troika: belated but welcome attitude against seeing the central

Q: What impact will the political crisis in Turkey have on the eurozone 
recovery?

It’s very difficult to understand how these big geo-political issues will 
affect the economy, Draghi replies. It’s not obvious how they would be 
channeled into the euro economy.

At least with Brexit you have the trade channel - although that may not be the 
best thing to look at.

With Turkey, it’s hard to see an immediate near-term hit to the euro recovery, 
he concludes, although it is likely to hurt confidence.

close  
That wasn’t the most dramatic or exciting press conference in the European 
Central Bank’s 18 year history.

Instead, there was a real end-of-term feeling, as Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> basically told reporters to 
come back in September and see if the ECB has decided to boost its stimulus 
programme.


Given some of the dramas we’ve seen in recent years, a dull ECB meeting should 
be welcomed (as long as it doesn’t become a habit, Mario). So what did we learn?

1) The ECB isn’t panicking about Brexit yet, although it believes it is a risk 
to the recovery.

Draghi struck a pretty reassuring tone, declaring that:


Following the UK referendum on EU membership, our assessment is that euro area 
financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with 
encouraging resilience....

What is clear is that financial markets and the banking sector have reacted in 
a fairly resilient fashion to the event.We haven’t observed any disruption 
either in financial markets or the banking sector.”

2) Assessing the full impact of Brexit will take some time. That’s why the ECB 
didn’t launch any new stimulus measures today.

Over the coming months when we have more information including new staff 
projections we’ll be in a better position to assess the underlying 
macroeconomic conditions.

3) Draghi has given eurozone politicians a nudge to provide more financial 
support for the banking sector.

The most interesting part of the press conference, I think, was Draghi’s 
comments about the non-performing loans which bedevil Europe’s banks, notably 
in Italy. More than once he hinted that a public backstop is needed to help 
banks shift their non-performing loans.

Draghi warned that these NPLs are threatening the recovery:

“The longer we have this (non-performing loan problem) in place, the less 
functioning will be the banking system, or at least will be the banks with high 
NPLs.

And so the less capable will be these banks to transmit our monetary policy 
impulses to the real economy. Also, a high level of NPLs makes banks especially 
vulnerable to the markets.”

This chart shows that Southern European countries need help the most:

4) We might get fireworks in September.


Draghi insisted that the ECB has the “readiness, willingness and ability” to 
take fresh action, if needed, to stimulate the economy. By September, the ECB 
will have fresh economic forecasts - and a better idea of Britain’s Brexit 
plans.

5) QE might be tweaked soon.

Economists are pretty confident that the ECB needs to adjust the rules of its 
asset-purchase scheme, to allow it to buy more bonds from individual companies.

Draghi was adamant that the ECB won’t run out of things to buy, saying:

“In the past we’ve given enough evidence ... of our ability to adapt our 
purchases to reach 80 billion euros a month until March 2017 or beyond.”

That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW
 
Trevor Charsley of currency trading firm AFEX says Draghi’s comments show 
we’ve entered a ‘phoney war’ following the EU referendum.

“In commenting that there was no Brexit induced disruption apparent in the 
banking sector, Draghi was merely confirming that, after a knee jerk reaction 
in the markets immediately following the EU referendum, we have effectively 
entered a period of limbo or a ‘phoney war’ while we await more economic data, 
while political decisions are made and holidays taken.

This situation could last for several months, he adds:

As we receive the announcement of a plan from the UK government, a few months 
of post-Brexit economic data and a potential triggering of Article 50, the fog 
will begin to clear and we’ll see then how the central banks respond

Mario Draghi’s call for a public backstop to help banks shed their bad loans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/21/ecb-meeting-brexit-vote-mario-draghi-retail-sales-business-live?page=with:block-5790cbbae4b0c570cc7277a2#block-5790cbbae4b0c570cc7277a2>
 has sparked a small rally in bank shares.

Reuters has the details:

Deutsche Bank shares, which opened flat, rose 3% following Draghi’s comments. 

The FTSE Italian All Shares Banks index rose nearly 2%.

The broader euro zone banking index rose 1.7%.

Traders are calculating that Draghi’s intervention could help struggling 
eurozone banks to shift their bad loans, which are dragging them down and 
hurting confidence and profitability.

So we got it - main ECB news is that Draghi backs the idea of public backstop 
for banks under exceptional circumstances.

Mario Draghi’s introductory statement is now online here 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2016/html/is160721.en.html>.

And here’s a word cloud of it:
 ECB wordcloud Photograph: Teneo Intelligence  
Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, is quick out of the 
traps with some reaction to the ECB’s meeting:

While we think Brexit uncertainty is mainly an issue for the UK economy, there 
is also bound to be some knock-on impact on the Eurozone. With post-Brexit 
evidence still patchy, we think the ECB will wait until the September meeting 
before extending its QE timetable.

Inflation remains far below the ECB’s target of 2% and while headline 
inflation will rise later in the year, thanks to the fading impact of a lower 
oil price, underlying inflationary pressures still remain very low. Delaying 
until September will allow an assessment of any Brexit impact to be outlined in 
the new ECB staff forecasts.
 
Final question....

Q: European bank shares are at record lows, so is there a fundamental lack of 
confidence in the eurozone banking sector?

Draghi says that the problem is about the future profitability of banks, not 
their solvency. That’s partly due to concerns about non-performing loans (which 
is why Draghi is pushing for a new market for them to be traded).

But he is confident that this situation, and the perception in the rest of the 
world’s eyes, can be improved.

And that’s it
 
Now we’re DEEP into conspiracy territory...

Q: Your son is a bond dealer in London, Mr Draghi, so isn’t that a conflict of 
interest?

Draghi says that he explained five year ago that his son was a trader, not a 
bond dealer, so there is no conflict of interest. The European Parliament 
agreed at the time.
 
OK, we’re wandering into conspiracy territory now, with a journalist asking 
Draghi if the ECB is committed to using notes and coins as sole legal tender.

Yes. Of course. There is, says Draghi, looking a little puzzled.

Q: So why did you bury the €500 note?

We didn’t bury it, Draghi says. We decided to stop printing it from 2018 to 
stop it being used by criminals.
 
Q: Could you elaborate on your comments that a public backstop is needed for 
banks with non-performing loans?

Draghi says that such a backstop would be “very useful”, but it should be 
agreed with the Commission.

The bad debts in Italy’s banking sector are a “very big problem” and it will 
take time to address them - as it has taken time in other countries, Draghi 
continues.

But the situation needs to be tackled, as:

The longer we have this in place, the less functioning will be the banking 
sector - and less effective the banks will be at transmitting our monetary 
policy.

The idea of a public backstop is likely to go down badly in Germany, which 
doesn’t like to see taxpayers on the hook for bank losses.

Expect lots of German snark about the colour of Draghi's passport after this.

Draghi is asked about the ECB’s presence in the “troika” which oversees 
eurozone bailouts.

He says it’s not his decision; it’s due to legislation passed by the European 
Parliament which wanted its expertise involved. The eurozone now has more 
expertise, but MEPs would have to pass new legislation if they want to get the 
ECB out of the Troika.

Francesco Papadia, a former senior ECB policymaker, reckons Draghi wants out:

Q: What impact will the political crisis in Turkey have on the eurozone 
recovery?

It’s very difficult to understand how these big geo-political issues will 
affect the economy, Draghi replies. It’s not obvious how they would be 
channeled into the euro economy.

At least with Brexit you have the trade channel - although that may not be the 
best thing to look at.

With Turkey, it’s hard to see an immediate near-term hit to the euro recovery, 
he concludes, although it is likely to hurt confidence.
