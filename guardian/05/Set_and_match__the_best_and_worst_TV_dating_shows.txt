It was “Blind Date with knobs on” or, if you prefer, “Blind Date in a 
brothel”. Either way, it’s fair to say that Channel 4’s newlove-match series 
Naked Attraction <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h_xk3-Dyy8> was not entirely 
to everybody’s tastes.

Certainly there was no escaping the full-frontal nudity on the Anna Richardson 
show, which made BBC2’speriod drama romp Versailles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/versailles> look like a particularly 
dull episode of Midsomer Murders. And1.4 million viewers lapped it up

 on Monday night.

But was it a new low for TV dating shows? It’s tricky to say. Here are a few 
of the more memorable series – although not always for the right reasons.

Dating in the Dark 

A bit like Blind Date, but all the dates took place in the dark. Only at the 
end, when the lights come on, do you get to see who you’ve been hanging out 
with. A bit like The Voice, then, but without the spinning chairs.

 It’s like dating. But it’s in the dark 
Blind Date

Talking of Blind Date ... This was really, really good, but it went on for a 
really, really, long time. If only they had called time at the top. Oh for that 
age of innocence.

 Surprise, surprise? 
Sexy Beasts

Utter madness. This BBC3 show was basically a regular dating show, except the 
people taking part were transformed using prosthetic makeup into animals or 
mythical creatures before they hooked up. A light entertainment take onthat 
Channel 4 documentary Animal Passions

 She’s an animal! No, she really is an animal 
Take Me Out 

The closest ITV has come to a successor to Blind Date – but unlike its 
predecessor, no one above the age of 40 has ever seen it. It features 30 women, 
one man, presenter Paddy McGuinness and a “love lift”. You’ve already clicked 
on the ITV Hub, haven’t you?

 “And it’s got a love lift”. I’ll take 26 episodes! 
Man O Man

The show that Take Me Out could have been – or perhaps that should be the 
other way round. Chris Tarrant presided over yet another ITV Saturday teatime 
dating show; this one rather short-lived. Look closely and you’ll spot Nell 
McAndrew. Don’t look too closely though.

 Phone a friend. Ask them how they hell I ended up on this show. 
First Dates

Back to reality, and a Channel 4 show that proves the best formats are often 
the most simple – a blind date followed by a debrief where the couple discuss 
their relationship prospects. What, no animal prosthetics? But I wanted to be a 
badger!

 First Dates. A programme about people on first dates 
The Undateables

Channel 4 again. Terrible title but a brilliant show. So sort of the opposite 
of Naked Attraction.
