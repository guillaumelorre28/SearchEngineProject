And so the day comes to an end. It’s been long, hard and historic. Nair’s 
knock was phenomenal, for all that he was dropped at slip a couple of times. 
Having got out for 7 and 13 in his first two Test innings, this came from 
nowhere and then kept coming. England were reeling by the end, punch-drunk and 
dizzy, bowling and fielding poorly as they waited to be put out of their 
misery. England have never conceded more runs, India have never scored more, 
and Nair became just the second Indian, after Virender Sehwag, to score a 
triple century. It’s been memorable. Bye!

“We’ve had a tough day today, but we’ll wake up tomorrow and we’re still 
breathing”

Trevor Bayliss, who’s leaving the tour a day early to undergo minor surgery, 
says:


It was just one of those days. India played extremely well. I’ll just put it 
down to one of those days that hopefully don’t come around many times in your 
career. The main thing is, if you set a field you’ve got to be able to bowl for 
it. It’s probably a little bit skill and a little bit concentration - it’s 
something we’re working towards and time will tell.

Rashid’s someone who has made some strides this winter, but there’s a long way 
to go. When he’s bowled well he’s landed the ball on the spot, the last couple 
of games not so much. He’s not the only one. There’s a few players that need to 
take a long, hard look at themselves. Tomorrow will be a test of their 
character. I like the way that Dawson went today. He showed great control 
today, when we needed someone to bowl to a field he was the one that stood up.

I’m sure we’ve made some mistakes but we’ve got to give credit where credit’s 
due. The India team have been absolutely superb. We’ve played some good cricket 
here, but not as good as the India team. The last three catches we’ve dropped 
probably haven’t cost us a lot. Aout 500 runs. When you score 300 you need a 
little bit of luck along the way, and he took full advantage of that.

On flat decks, it’s something we’ve got to work on. How to take wickets on 
flat decks. Some of their batters have been superb. Their concentration, their 
fitness, is something we can learn from. And the consistency of their spinners 
is something we’ve got to work towards.

We’ve had a tough day today, but we’ll wake up tomorrow and we’re still 
breathing. We’re still looking for a complete XI. We’re not there yet. The good 
teams are teams that have good players across the board.

On the captaincy: After this Test match I’m sure Cooky will sit down. If he 
wants to continue we’re more than happy for him to continue, but after a long 
stint as captain that’s a decision only he can make. I’m not going to get 
involved in that.

Karun Nair talks:

It’s the best knock I’ve made in my life. I think once I got 100 the pressure 
was off. When I got the first 100, I didn’t feel any pressure, I was just 
playing my shots after that. Sweeping comes naturally to me. I’ve been playing 
it a lot, it’s beenn my go-to shot whenever I needed a four. It just came off 
today. My dad watches most of my games so having him here was not extra 
pressure for me. I’d like to thank them for supporting me. They should feel 
proud. After 250 the message was just to go after the bowling. We had a set 
number of overs in mind, but when I got closer to 300 they pushed it up. I’d 
like to thank the team management for giving me a bit of extra time.

The pitch has been good for four days. It’s getting worse day by day. Any new 
batsman coming in, it’s not easy to play. It’s turning a bit right now, and I 
hope it turns more tomorrow.

STUMPS: England 12-0, trail by 270

5th over: England 12-0 (Cook 3, Jennings 9) Jadeja bowls the final over, but 
Jennings handls the first four balls adroitly, and Cook copes with the final 
two. And with that, the day is over. It’s been historic.

3rd over: England 6-0 (Cook 3, Jennings 3) Jadeja has a go at Cook, who has 
pretty much been his plaything throughout the series. No dice. Meanwhile, 
Nair’s numbers continue to be crunched.

Nair scored his first 100 runs off 185 balls; his second 100 runs off 121 
balls and his third 100 runs off 75 balls.#IndvEng

2nd over: England 4-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 2) Spin from the start, as Ashwin 
takes aim at Jennings, who deals with it pretty well, but for a minor lbw 
appeal, stymied only by the fact the ball pitched outside the line, and would 
have missed the stumps.

1st over: England 2-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 0) Ishant bowls the first over, and 
his third delivery is a cracker, angled into Cook, forcing him to play and then 
moving away, but it misses the bat by a couple of inches. Of all the ridiculous 
numbers swirling around this game, what follows is one of the zaniest: Nair’s 
day in full - 245 balls, 232 runs.

India’s 759-7 declared represents the seventh highest Test tally of all time. 
They were only seven runs away from the top five. They might regret that.

The declaration! India 759-7 dec, lead by 282

191st over: India 759-7 (Nair 303, U Yadav 1) England’s gameplan was to keep 
Umesh on strike, and deny Nair a chance to complete his triple ton. This they 
achieve for just one ball, and then after a further dot Nair cuts square for 
four, and he’s done it! He is the second Indian in all of history to score a 
Test 300, and that’s the last ball of the innings!
 Nair raises his bat after scoring 303 runs. Photograph: Tsering Topgyal/AP

190th over: India 754-7 (Nair 299, U Yadav 0) Dawson bowls, and Nair gets a 
single off the first, and Jadeja a single off the second. That takes the total 
to 753, making this the biggest ever score achieved against England, beating 
West Indies’ 751-5 declared at St John’s in 2004. The batsmen cross before 
Jadeja is caught, leaving Nair one ball to face, and he misses it completely, 
stamping about in frustration.

189th over: India 751-6 (Nair 297, Jadeja 50) Nair finds himself back on 
strike, five short of 300, with Rashid bowling, but he chips the ball in the 
air towards long on, a bit of a limp shot even if the ball dropped well short 
of Broad. That puts Jadeja back on strike, and he hits a single to complete his 
own half-century, complete with bat-twirling celebration, from his 52nd 
delivery.

188th over: India 747-6 (Nair 295, Jadeja 48) Jadeja thunders Moeen’s first 
delivery down the ground and high into the stands. Then the batsmen sprint, 
which seems a quite unnecessary expenditure of energy, to convert an easy 
single into a sharp two. A single brings Nair on strike, six runs from 300 with 
two balls remaining, and when he gets just a single off the first he pounds the 
turf with his bat in frustration. Is that the end?

187th over: India 736-6 (Nair 294, Jadeja 38) Nair cracks the ball through the 
covers to the boundary, and this is now the fourth biggest innings in the 
history of Indian Test cricket. Only Sehwag has scored more than this. 
England’s fielding has become a bit shambolic in the last few overs, but 
nothing except for the size of India’s total, the immensity of Nair’s 
individual contribution, and when it’s all going to stop really matters now. 
And then he boshes Rashid’s final ball through midwicket for four more, and now 
he’s No3 on the list.

186th over: India 722-6 (Nair 280, Jadeja 38) It’s just numbers now. A tidal 
wave of numbers. Really big, confusingly enormous numbers. Still, just five 
runs from Moeen’s latest over, so that’s something.

185th over: India 717-6 (Nair 276, Jadeja 36) Nair shuffles back, swings his 
bat and sends Rashid’s second ball over midwicket and into the stands for six, 
and then he sweeps the next along the ground for four, and a dot later does it 
again. He’s faced 360 deliveries, but only the fielding side are tiring. Those 
are three fabulous, vicious strokes. They’ve got to let him complete the treble 
ton now, surely?

Umesh Yadav, who batted 11 in the last Test, is padded up. If he comes in as 
nightwatchman, Virat Kohli wins the real quiz.#IndvEng

184th over: India 701-6 (Nair 261, Jadeja 36) Moeen bowls, and Nair tries to 
clear the midwicket boundary but the ball drops 10 yards short. So he has 
another go off the next ball, a little straighter this time, and there’s no 
stopping that one. India’s total has teetered past 700, and out comes another 
messenger from the dressing room. Two more overs would, I think, leave England 
with 10 to face this evening, which is a pleasingly round number.

183rd over: India 687-6 (Nair 251, Jadeja 35) Nair turns Rashid’s first ball 
to square leg for a single, completing his 250. It’s been, well, ludicrous. And 
they’re still batting, India’s balcony having refilled again.

maiden Test 100 to a triple century!#IndvEng

182nd over: India 686-6 (Nair 249, Jadeja 33) Nair has just overtaken Sachin 
Tendulkar’s all-time biggest Test innings, 248 against Bangladesh in 2004. Only 
three batsmen, and six innings, are still ahead of him in the list of India’s 
all-time top Test knocks. At the end of the over, someone emerges from the 
dressing-room with a drink and a message. What, though, could it be?

181st over: India 681-6 (Nair 247, Jadeja 30) “You ask what they’re waiting 
for,” writes Robin Hazlehurst. “Wasn’t there some kid in India who got 900 and 
odd runs in a first-class game last year or something? That record’s got to be 
worth chasing. And frankly worth sacrificing the victory for. 4-0 series 
thrashings happen all the time, but the first Test 1000 would be a truly 
memorable achievement.”

180th over: India 677-6 (Nair 246, Jadeja 27) Another let-off for Nair, who 
goes down the ground to Moeen, misses completely and was way out of his ground 
if Bairstow could only collect and whip off the bails. Which, obviously, he 
couldn’t. This is now India’s all-time highest innings total against England, 
beating the 664 they scored at the Oval in 2007, and they lead by 200 runs. 
England’s torture is nearly over, though: their balcony has just emptied.

179th over: India 671-6 (Nair 244, Jadeja 25) The 50 partnership is completed, 
from 45 balls. “Do you think England can bat out a draw or does the pitch have 
some venom for Ashwin and co to make it 4-0?” asks Shankar Subramanian. It’s 
still a flat enough pitch, but what is in doubt is the psychology. Do England’s 
players have the determination and the discipline to bat slow and long, given 
that this is the last match in the series, it’s nearly Christmas, they know 
they can’t win, and they’re all a bit miserable and want to go home?

Having said that, Stokes’ final delivery rears up into Nair, who fends it away 
for a single.

178th over: India 665-6 (Nair 242, Jadeja 22) Moeen returns, and Nair 
reverse-sweeps ever so fine for four. India lead by 188 runs as the players 
take drinks. What, now, are they waiting for? Nair’s 250? A 200-run lead? 
Jadeja’s 50? Ishant Sharma completing a century? Umesh Yadav’s jackpot double 
ton?

176th over: India 654-6 (Nair 235, Jadeja 18) Between overs Jadeja calls for 
and receives a new, bigger, thicker bat. No more holding back, now India want 
to score some proper runs. Ball bangs one short, and Jadeja pulls it away for 
six off the middle of the bat, and then a similar shot off the next ball brings 
four more.

175th over: India 640-6 (Nair 232, Jadeja 7) Sadly this is one record Nair 
never looked like getting, given that he leapt straight from 228 to 232 by 
clubbing wide of mid on for four.
Tom Bowtell (@Tom_Bowtell) 
@Simon_Burnton <https://twitter.com/Simon_Burnton> golden opportunity here for 
Kohli to declare with Nair on 229 - the lowest score never made in a Test...

173rd over: India 630-6 (Nair 226, Jadeja 3) For the first couple of overs 
with the new ball England played a long stop, to dissuade Nair from attempting 
a ramp shot. Then they gave up, and now Nair leans back and helps a short ball 
on its way towards, and indeed over, the boundary for six!
Ric Finlay (@RicFinlay) 
The best catch ever with the score on 616. In fact the only catch. First time 
in Test history a wicket has fallen at 616.#newground

172nd over: India 620-6 (Nair 218, Jadeja 1) Nair is dropped again! He edges 
the ball to the right of Root at slip, and he gets a palm to it but fumbles! 
Earlier Ball had a go at bowling short at Jadeja too, but his attempt isn’t 
quite so accurate as Broad’s, and the third man umpire signals a wide. 
“Alastair Cook has about the best test bowling average in the world - 7.00,” 
notes Jonathan Gresty. “Now is the time for him to stop being so self-effacing 
it and improve it with a quick five-for before the sun goes down in Chennai.”

WICKET! Ashwin c Buttler b Broad 67 (India 616-6)

That’s a fantastic catch from Buttler at gully! An absolute beauty! The ball 
is flying low to his left, but he dives, flings out a hand and collects 
cleanly, a couple of inches from the ground. Phwoar!

170th over: India 614-5 (Nair 215, Ashwin 66) Ball’s first delivery is banged 
in short, and Nair swats it from somewhere near his right ear through mid on 
for four, and the next delivery, pitched up, heads back in precisely the same 
direction but doesn’t quite reach the rope.

168th over: India 600-5 (Nair 207, Ashwin 60) In which Nair scored another 
fine boundary, leaning back and punching the ball past extra cover. A couple of 
singles take India to 600 runs, a lead of 123. Which, as has been established, 
is as easy as ABC, so really there’s nothing for England to worry about.

No nightmare one-nineties for Nair, who cracks the first ball of Jennings’

166th over: India 585-5 (Nair 197, Ashwin 55) Moeen bowls, and after his first 
three deliveries yield singles, the second three deliveries don’t yield 
anything. At the end of it all Nair is on strike, three runs from the double 
ton, and Jennings has the ball.

England a nervy 45 minutes?

Last time England got stuffed this badly abroad, Cook made KP the scapegoat. 
Needs to stab himself in the back this time. #INDvENG

TEA: India lead by 105 with 5 wickets remaining

And the only question is, when will India stop this torture, and start a 
different kind of torture.
Andy Zaltzman (@ZaltzCricket) 
Ashwin reprieved by DRS review. Just as England were about to turn the series 
on its head.

165th over: India 582-5 (Nair 195, Ashwin 54) Jennings thinks he’s got a 
wicket now, as the ball thumps Ashwin in the pad and loops up to point and 
Simon Fry finally raises his finger. India review, though, and it turns out the 
ball just missed the edge of the bat, and would have missed leg stump, so no 
dice. Nearly-wicket maiden, and that’s tea.

164th over: India 582-5 (Nair 195, Ashwin 54) “At what point does Cook warm up 
to bowl?” wonders Kevin Wilson. “After all, he has a decent record with the 
ball against India!” It’s true, he accounted for Ishant Sharma at Trent Bridge

163rd over: India 579-5 (Nair 193, Ashwin 53) Jennings is close to getting 
Nair out again, convincing the ball to move back a little off the seam, and 
Nair inside-edges it just past his stumps. He gets four runs, obviously. Not a 
bad over, really.

India battering may decide Alastair Cook’s England captaincy, says Bayliss

And so the day comes to an end. It’s been long, hard and historic. Nair’s 
knock was phenomenal, for all that he was dropped at slip a couple of times. 
Having got out for 7 and 13 in his first two Test innings, this came from 
nowhere and then kept coming. England were reeling by the end, punch-drunk and 
dizzy, bowling and fielding poorly as they waited to be put out of their 
misery. England have never conceded more runs, India have never scored more, 
and Nair became just the second Indian, after Virender Sehwag, to score a 
triple century. It’s been memorable. Bye!
 
Trevor Bayliss, who’s leaving the tour a day early to undergo minor surgery, 
says:


It was just one of those days. India played extremely well. I’ll just put it 
down to one of those days that hopefully don’t come around many times in your 
career. The main thing is, if you set a field you’ve got to be able to bowl for 
it. It’s probably a little bit skill and a little bit concentration - it’s 
something we’re working towards and time will tell.

Rashid’s someone who has made some strides this winter, but there’s a long way 
to go. When he’s bowled well he’s landed the ball on the spot, the last couple 
of games not so much. He’s not the only one. There’s a few players that need to 
take a long, hard look at themselves. Tomorrow will be a test of their 
character. I like the way that Dawson went today. He showed great control 
today, when we needed someone to bowl to a field he was the one that stood up.

I’m sure we’ve made some mistakes but we’ve got to give credit where credit’s 
due. The India team have been absolutely superb. We’ve played some good cricket 
here, but not as good as the India team. The last three catches we’ve dropped 
probably haven’t cost us a lot. Aout 500 runs. When you score 300 you need a 
little bit of luck along the way, and he took full advantage of that.

On flat decks, it’s something we’ve got to work on. How to take wickets on 
flat decks. Some of their batters have been superb. Their concentration, their 
fitness, is something we can learn from. And the consistency of their spinners 
is something we’ve got to work towards.

We’ve had a tough day today, but we’ll wake up tomorrow and we’re still 
breathing. We’re still looking for a complete XI. We’re not there yet. The good 
teams are teams that have good players across the board.

On the captaincy: After this Test match I’m sure Cooky will sit down. If he 
wants to continue we’re more than happy for him to continue, but after a long 
stint as captain that’s a decision only he can make. I’m not going to get 
involved in that.
 
Karun Nair talks:

It’s the best knock I’ve made in my life. I think once I got 100 the pressure 
was off. When I got the first 100, I didn’t feel any pressure, I was just 
playing my shots after that. Sweeping comes naturally to me. I’ve been playing 
it a lot, it’s beenn my go-to shot whenever I needed a four. It just came off 
today. My dad watches most of my games so having him here was not extra 
pressure for me. I’d like to thank them for supporting me. They should feel 
proud. After 250 the message was just to go after the bowling. We had a set 
number of overs in mind, but when I got closer to 300 they pushed it up. I’d 
like to thank the team management for giving me a bit of extra time.

The pitch has been good for four days. It’s getting worse day by day. Any new 
batsman coming in, it’s not easy to play. It’s turning a bit right now, and I 
hope it turns more tomorrow.
 
5th over: England 12-0 (Cook 3, Jennings 9) Jadeja bowls the final over, but 
Jennings handls the first four balls adroitly, and Cook copes with the final 
two. And with that, the day is over. It’s been historic.

4th over: England 11-0 (Cook 3, Jennings 8) Four for Jennings, whose deft 
sweeps just evades the fielder on its way to the fine leg boundary. One more 
over.
 
3rd over: England 6-0 (Cook 3, Jennings 3) Jadeja has a go at Cook, who has 
pretty much been his plaything throughout the series. No dice. Meanwhile, 
Nair’s numbers continue to be crunched.

2nd over: England 4-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 2) Spin from the start, as Ashwin 
takes aim at Jennings, who deals with it pretty well, but for a minor lbw 
appeal, stymied only by the fact the ball pitched outside the line, and would 
have missed the stumps.
 
1st over: England 2-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 0) Ishant bowls the first over, and 
his third delivery is a cracker, angled into Cook, forcing him to play and then 
moving away, but it misses the bat by a couple of inches. Of all the ridiculous 
numbers swirling around this game, what follows is one of the zaniest: Nair’s 
day in full - 245 balls, 232 runs.

India’s 759-7 declared represents the seventh highest Test tally of all time. 
They were only seven runs away from the top five. They might regret that.
 
191st over: India 759-7 (Nair 303, U Yadav 1) England’s gameplan was to keep 
Umesh on strike, and deny Nair a chance to complete his triple ton. This they 
achieve for just one ball, and then after a further dot Nair cuts square for 
four, and he’s done it! He is the second Indian in all of history to score a 
Test 300, and that’s the last ball of the innings!

190th over: India 754-7 (Nair 299, U Yadav 0) Dawson bowls, and Nair gets a 
single off the first, and Jadeja a single off the second. That takes the total 
to 753, making this the biggest ever score achieved against England, beating 
West Indies’ 751-5 declared at St John’s in 2004. The batsmen cross before 
Jadeja is caught, leaving Nair one ball to face, and he misses it completely, 
stamping about in frustration.
 
Jadeja hoicks towards the midwicket boundary, and Ball takes a fine running 
catch a couple of yards from the rope. And so the collapse begins ...
 
189th over: India 751-6 (Nair 297, Jadeja 50) Nair finds himself back on 
strike, five short of 300, with Rashid bowling, but he chips the ball in the 
air towards long on, a bit of a limp shot even if the ball dropped well short 
of Broad. That puts Jadeja back on strike, and he hits a single to complete his 
own half-century, complete with bat-twirling celebration, from his 52nd 
delivery.
 
No. No it isn’t.
 
188th over: India 747-6 (Nair 295, Jadeja 48) Jadeja thunders Moeen’s first 
delivery down the ground and high into the stands. Then the batsmen sprint, 
which seems a quite unnecessary expenditure of energy, to convert an easy 
single into a sharp two. A single brings Nair on strike, six runs from 300 with 
two balls remaining, and when he gets just a single off the first he pounds the 
turf with his bat in frustration. Is that the end?

187th over: India 736-6 (Nair 294, Jadeja 38) Nair cracks the ball through the 
covers to the boundary, and this is now the fourth biggest innings in the 
history of Indian Test cricket. Only Sehwag has scored more than this. 
England’s fielding has become a bit shambolic in the last few overs, but 
nothing except for the size of India’s total, the immensity of Nair’s 
individual contribution, and when it’s all going to stop really matters now. 
And then he boshes Rashid’s final ball through midwicket for four more, and now 
he’s No3 on the list.

186th over: India 722-6 (Nair 280, Jadeja 38) It’s just numbers now. A tidal 
wave of numbers. Really big, confusingly enormous numbers. Still, just five 
runs from Moeen’s latest over, so that’s something.

185th over: India 717-6 (Nair 276, Jadeja 36) Nair shuffles back, swings his 
bat and sends Rashid’s second ball over midwicket and into the stands for six, 
and then he sweeps the next along the ground for four, and a dot later does it 
again. He’s faced 360 deliveries, but only the fielding side are tiring. Those 
are three fabulous, vicious strokes. They’ve got to let him complete the treble 
ton now, surely?

184th over: India 701-6 (Nair 261, Jadeja 36) Moeen bowls, and Nair tries to 
clear the midwicket boundary but the ball drops 10 yards short. So he has 
another go off the next ball, a little straighter this time, and there’s no 
stopping that one. India’s total has teetered past 700, and out comes another 
messenger from the dressing room. Two more overs would, I think, leave England 
with 10 to face this evening, which is a pleasingly round number.
 
183rd over: India 687-6 (Nair 251, Jadeja 35) Nair turns Rashid’s first ball 
to square leg for a single, completing his 250. It’s been, well, ludicrous. And 
they’re still batting, India’s balcony having refilled again.

182nd over: India 686-6 (Nair 249, Jadeja 33) Nair has just overtaken Sachin 
Tendulkar’s all-time biggest Test innings, 248 against Bangladesh in 2004. Only 
three batsmen, and six innings, are still ahead of him in the list of India’s 
all-time top Test knocks. At the end of the over, someone emerges from the 
dressing-room with a drink and a message. What, though, could it be?
 
181st over: India 681-6 (Nair 247, Jadeja 30) “You ask what they’re waiting 
for,” writes Robin Hazlehurst. “Wasn’t there some kid in India who got 900 and 
odd runs in a first-class game last year or something? That record’s got to be 
worth chasing. And frankly worth sacrificing the victory for. 4-0 series 
thrashings happen all the time, but the first Test 1000 would be a truly 
memorable achievement.”
 
180th over: India 677-6 (Nair 246, Jadeja 27) Another let-off for Nair, who 
goes down the ground to Moeen, misses completely and was way out of his ground 
if Bairstow could only collect and whip off the bails. Which, obviously, he 
couldn’t. This is now India’s all-time highest innings total against England, 
beating the 664 they scored at the Oval in 2007, and they lead by 200 runs. 
England’s torture is nearly over, though: their balcony has just emptied.

179th over: India 671-6 (Nair 244, Jadeja 25) The 50 partnership is completed, 
from 45 balls. “Do you think England can bat out a draw or does the pitch have 
some venom for Ashwin and co to make it 4-0?” asks Shankar Subramanian. It’s 
still a flat enough pitch, but what is in doubt is the psychology. Do England’s 
players have the determination and the discipline to bat slow and long, given 
that this is the last match in the series, it’s nearly Christmas, they know 
they can’t win, and they’re all a bit miserable and want to go home?

Having said that, Stokes’ final delivery rears up into Nair, who fends it away 
for a single.
 
178th over: India 665-6 (Nair 242, Jadeja 22) Moeen returns, and Nair 
reverse-sweeps ever so fine for four. India lead by 188 runs as the players 
take drinks. What, now, are they waiting for? Nair’s 250? A 200-run lead? 
Jadeja’s 50? Ishant Sharma completing a century? Umesh Yadav’s jackpot double 
ton?
 
177th over: India 658-6 (Nair 237, Jadeja 20) Ben Stokes does some bowling, 
and keeps the scoring relatively slow, with just four singles conceded.
 
176th over: India 654-6 (Nair 235, Jadeja 18) Between overs Jadeja calls for 
and receives a new, bigger, thicker bat. No more holding back, now India want 
to score some proper runs. Ball bangs one short, and Jadeja pulls it away for 
six off the middle of the bat, and then a similar shot off the next ball brings 
four more.

172nd over: India 620-6 (Nair 218, Jadeja 1) Nair is dropped again! He edges 
the ball to the right of Root at slip, and he gets a palm to it but fumbles! 
Earlier Ball had a go at bowling short at Jadeja too, but his attempt isn’t 
quite so accurate as Broad’s, and the third man umpire signals a wide. 
“Alastair Cook has about the best test bowling average in the world - 7.00,” 
notes Jonathan Gresty. “Now is the time for him to stop being so self-effacing 
it and improve it with a quick five-for before the sun goes down in Chennai.”
 
171st over: India 616-6 (Nair 215, Jadeja 0) Broad welcomes Jadeja with a 
vicious bumper that rears up into his chest, completing an excellent, 
aggressive over.
 
That’s a fantastic catch from Buttler at gully! An absolute beauty! The ball 
is flying low to his left, but he dives, flings out a hand and collects 
cleanly, a couple of inches from the ground. Phwoar!
 
170th over: India 614-5 (Nair 215, Ashwin 66) Ball’s first delivery is banged 
in short, and Nair swats it from somewhere near his right ear through mid on 
for four, and the next delivery, pitched up, heads back in precisely the same 
direction but doesn’t quite reach the rope.
 
169th over: India 606-5 (Nair 208, Ashwin 65) England take another new ball, 
hand it to Broad, and Ashwin cuts late, sending the ball down to third man for 
four.

168th over: India 600-5 (Nair 207, Ashwin 60) In which Nair scored another 
fine boundary, leaning back and punching the ball past extra cover. A couple of 
singles take India to 600 runs, a lead of 123. Which, as has been established, 
is as easy as ABC, so really there’s nothing for England to worry about.
 
167th over: India 593-5 (Nair 202, Ashwin 58) Nair’s first century took him 
185 balls, his second came off 121. A decent knock.
 
No nightmare one-nineties for Nair, who cracks the first ball of Jennings’ 
over through cover for four to move onto 201!
 
166th over: India 585-5 (Nair 197, Ashwin 55) Moeen bowls, and after his first 
three deliveries yield singles, the second three deliveries don’t yield 
anything. At the end of it all Nair is on strike, three runs from the double 
ton, and Jennings has the ball.
 
The players are back out. An hour or so and then a declaration, leaving 
England a nervy 45 minutes?

Last time England got stuffed this badly abroad, Cook made KP the scapegoat. 
Needs to stab himself in the back this time. #INDvENG

And the only question is, when will India stop this torture, and start a 
different kind of torture.

Ashwin reprieved by DRS review. Just as England were about to turn the series 
on its head.

165th over: India 582-5 (Nair 195, Ashwin 54) Jennings thinks he’s got a 
wicket now, as the ball thumps Ashwin in the pad and loops up to point and 
Simon Fry finally raises his finger. India review, though, and it turns out the 
ball just missed the edge of the bat, and would have missed leg stump, so no 
dice. Nearly-wicket maiden, and that’s tea.
 
164th over: India 582-5 (Nair 195, Ashwin 54) “At what point does Cook warm up 
to bowl?” wonders Kevin Wilson. “After all, he has a decent record with the 
ball against India!” It’s true, he accounted for Ishant Sharma at Trent Bridge 
a couple of years back.
 
163rd over: India 579-5 (Nair 193, Ashwin 53) Jennings is close to getting 
Nair out again, convincing the ball to move back a little off the seam, and 
Nair inside-edges it just past his stumps. He gets four runs, obviously. Not a 
bad over, really.
