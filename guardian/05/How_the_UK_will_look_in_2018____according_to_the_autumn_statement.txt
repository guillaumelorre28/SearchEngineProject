The economic forecasts published in today's autumn statement 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/263575/Autumn_Statement_2013.pdf>
 are worth breaking down to consider what life would be like in 2018 if they 
prove to be accurate.

A country with 2.7% growth

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) wanted to reflect the "increasing 
momentum" in 2013. So they revised up their forecast for GDP growth in 2013 by 
almost one percentage point, the largest upward revision within 12 months since 
1999.

A country with no budget deficit

As a percentage of GDP, the OBR thinks we can continue to minimise the deficit 
(that's the difference between government spending and government revenues). 
It's already fallen by more than 5 percentage points since 2009/10 but the 
Chancellor today announced he was confident it could drop further until it's 
eliminated in 2018/19. If their forecasts prove correct, we would actually have 
a budget surplus, a relatively small 0.1% of GDP representing a not 
insignificant £2.2bn.

Fewer public sector jobs

This is a number that keeps on growing with each additional year, although at 
a slower rate. When we last checked the numbers, the OBR thought there would be 
1m fewer public sector jobs by 2018 (compared to their level in 2011). Now, 
that's predicted to be 1.1m by 2019.

Higher wages and lower unemployment

Despite the fall in public sector jobs 
<https://flexible.gutools.co.uk/admin/content/> (which account for around 1 in 
5 of all UK jobs) yesterday's statement predicted that wouldn't prevent an 
overall fall in unemployment. The OBR now predict that by 2017, the 
unemployment rate will be at 6.1%, though the IMF make a slightly more modest 
estimate of 6.7%. 

The message delivered yesterday was also a far more positive outlook than the 
one we had before the Autumn statement. Previously, the forecast for 
unemployment in 2017 was 6.9%.

Those higher jobs will, according to the Chancellor's team, be accompanied by 
wages that have risen faster than inflation. Earnings are forecast to have 
grown by 3.8% by 2018.

Here are some of the other features of 2018-Britain according to the statement:

 * £9bn of extra government money: The Chancellor mentioned "the largest 
package of measures to tackle tax avoidance, tax evasion, fraud and error so 
far" - though no detail was given on how that money would be raised. That might 
be complicated given that for housing benefit alone,official error accounts for 
£0.8bn of the money lost.

 * £2.95 more a week for pensioners: That pledge is actually due to start with 
the new financial year in April 2014. Taken with other measures set out by 
politicians, "pensioners will be over £800 every year better off" 
 * £50 off energy bills: Wading into the energy debate, the Chancellor said 
government would deliver this week on a plan to deliver "an average of £50 off 
family bills". Whether households that aren't families will be included in the 
savings wasn't clear from the speech alone.
