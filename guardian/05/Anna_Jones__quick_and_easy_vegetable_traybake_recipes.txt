I am learning a new way to cook. Since having my little boy, it’s been hard to 
find time. No more long evenings in the kitchen: for now, my cooking is 
sandwiched into a neat window of time before baths and stories. I’ve 
rediscovered the joy of one pan or one-pot meals – dinners laid thoughtfully 
into a tray and left to roast and burnish. Cooking this way takes a quick, but 
careful, bit of preparation and can then be almost left alone for edges to 
crisp and golden hues to appear.

It requires being practical and organised. Although I am neither, I do find 
this kind of cooking weirdly satisfying. While I love the feeling of a pan over 
a flame, there is something very pleasing about knowing your dinner is cooking 
while you sit down with a glass of something, fold up the washing, catch up on 
emails, or whatever it may be.

Though the method may be simple, I still want flavours and textures that 
excite me, as well as bringing some balance – after all, I want everything I’m 
going to eat to be in that tray – vegetables, herbs, pulses, even baked 
cheeses. I’ve been playing around with one this week that reflects the season, 
and it’s become my quick weeknight take on a faded classic.

This principle of a roasting tray dinner works well with almost anything. I 
work on a basic formula of one or two vegetables, a herb, an accent flavour, 
such as chilli or lemon, and then something hearty – a pulse or some torn-up 
bread. Bear in mind that you need a vegetable that softens when it cooks – such 
as sweet potato or courgette – to add a little stickiness and to stop things 
burning. If you are roasting something (such as potatoes) that won’t do that, 
you might want to add a little stock or wine to make sure everything cooks 
evenly and so the flavours mingle in the best way possible.

Quick courgette ratatouille with crispy haricot beans 

I’m not sure if it’s just me, but it seems that ratatouille got left behind in 
the 90s – but it’s a great dish that deserves reviving. This is my quick 
version – the ideal thing to make on a weeknight. I use the grill to get things 
working quickly and to impart some crispy edges and charred flavour.

Serves 4
4 medium courgettes, grated
Olive oil
Salt and black pepper
1 red onion, thinly sliced
½ bunch of fresh thyme, leaves picked
1 red pepper, finely chopped
230g jar of roasted red peppers, finely chopped 
550g cherry tomatoes, finely chopped 
2 garlic cloves, finely sliced 
400g tin chickpeas, drained
Zest and juice of 1 lemon

1 Preheat your grill to high. Scatter the grated courgettes evenly over a 
baking tray, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little oil. Put the 
tray under the grill to cook and char the courgettes for about 20 minutes, 
turning every couple of minutes.

2 Meanwhile, put a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the red onion to the pan 
with a splash of olive oil and the thyme leaves. Cook for 5 minutes, or until 
soft and sweet.

3 When the onions are nicely browned, add them to the tray of courgettes along 
with all of the chopped peppers, as well as the tomatoes and garlic, then 
continue to cook and brown, turning every 5 minutes, for a further 10–15 
minutes.

4 Put the frying pan back on a high heat and add a little more olive oil. Add 
the chickpeas, a good pinch of salt and pepper, and the zest of the lemon. Cook 
until the chickpeas have become crisp around the edges. This will take about 10 
minutes, and you’ll need to keep tossing them around the pan.

5 Once the courgette mixture has turned soft and sweet, and become charred in 
places, scatter over the chickpeas. Serve with some green leaves dressed with 
lemon juice.

Figs, butterbeans, ricotta, radicchio, almonds (main picture)


If you can, use good Italian or strained ricotta here; if you can’t find any, 
you can improve a particularly soggy ricotta by straining your own, but it 
takes a few hours. Jarred beans are harder to find, but I think they taste 
better than the tinned type.

Serves 4 
200g ricotta
400g tin or jar of butterbeans
4 figs, tough stems removed, quartered
1 lemon
Small bunch of thyme or oregano, leaves picked 
A pinch of dried red chilli flakes
Salt and black pepper
Extra virgin olive oil
1 red chilli, finely chopped
100g almonds, skin on 
1-2 heads of radicchio, shredded

1 If your ricotta is very wet, put it in a small sieve lined with muslin over 
a bowl in the fridge for a few hours. You will probably get a couple of 
tablespoons of liquid in the bowl, which you can discard.

2 Set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and get a large, lipped roasting tray. 
Scatter the beans into the tray, making a little space in the middle for the 
ricotta, then turn out the cheese into it.

3 Scatter the quartered figs on top of the beans. Grate the zest of the lemon 
all over the tray, focusing particularly on the ricotta. Sprinkle over some of 
the thyme leaves and red chilli flakes along with some salt and pepper. Drizzle 
a little olive oil over the figs and beans. Put in the hot oven for 45 minutes, 
or until the ricotta has shrunk a little and is beginning to brown, and the 
beans have softened and their skins crisped.

4 Meanwhile, make your herb oil: bash the rest of the thyme tips in a pestle 
and mortar until you have a deep green paste, add 4 tbsp olive oil, the chopped 
fresh chilli and a good sprinkle of salt and pepper.

5 When your traybake has had 35 minutes, put the almonds on to a separate tray 
with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then roast for the last 10 minutes of the 
cooking time.

6 Remove both the traybake and the almonds from the oven, roughly chop the 
almonds and sprinkle them over the bake with the shredded radicchio. Drizzle 
over the herb oil and serve in the middle of the table for everyone to dig in. 
A side of some sauteed spinach or green beans might be nice.
