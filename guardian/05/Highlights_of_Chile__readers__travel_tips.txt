Winning tip: Climbing Villarrica in Pucón

The volcano Villarrica is impossible to miss in Pucón; it looms over you no 
matter where you go in town. Climbing this monster, kitted out with crampons 
and mountain gear, was an experience I’ll never forget and the fact that it’s 
one of the most active in Chile made it more exhilarating. The hike goes from 
dark volcanic rubble to dazzling snow. The climb gets tougher but the views are 
impressive with Chile’s Lake District spread out before you. Guides up the 
volcano are not hard to organise from Pucón, and cost around £80.

Tour small towns by campervan

Hire a campervan and explore smaller towns at your own pace. Wicked Campers 
<http://www.wickedsouthamerica.com/> is reliable and reasonably priced, 
sleeping up to six. We parked by the dunes at stunning Laguna Verde, near 
Valparaíso, and visited the surfer town of Pichilemu. We found an interestingly 
shaped lake on our map and went inland, inadvertently discovering the 
watersports hub of Lago Repel. There’s a great selection of campsites, right on 
the shore, but my personal recommendation is Tropikal Lake (lagorapelchile.cl 
<http://lagorapelchile.cl/camping/camping-tropikal-lake/>), which has 
watersports facilities, barbecues and hot showers.

Museum and Memory Centre in Neltume

Just past the enormous wooden statue that dominates the entrance to this 
former logging settlement is a building covered in murals celebrating local 
flora and fauna. The museum is a social centre, tells the story of life in 
Neltume, and, like the statue, also serves as a memorial to many from there 
killed and disappeared by the dictatorship. Neltume is beautiful, set between 
lakes, the spectacular Huilo-Huilo waterfalls and the Choshuenco volcano. But 
Chileans also remember it for brutal repression. The museum celebrates 
idealism, bravery and memory, as well as the incredible landscape.

Ferry through the Beagle Channel

Going from Puerto Williams, the tiny capital of Navarino Island at the foot of 
the southernmost mountain range in South America, to Puerto Arenas gave us the 
same views of glaciers and green cliffs that FitzRoy, Darwin and the rest of 
the HMS Beagle crew marvelled at. The 32-hour trip on the Austral Broom ferry 
is probably one of the most thrilling experiences I had during my year in 
Chile. It departs every other day from Puerto Williams at 4pm and more details 
are attabsa.cl.

If you are in Santiago and would like to escape the city and go high up in the 
Andes without a lot of travelling. there is a hike in the Aguas de Ramón park. 
Go by public transport or an inexpensive taxi ride. The park is open year-round 
and admission is only about £2. The views and hiking are amazing. There are 
three routes you can take ranging from 1km to 17.5km.

Vibrant Valparaíso

The seaside city of Valparaíso is a Chilean must-see. Its famous hills, 
accessible by steep stairways, are home to colourful barrios full of wonderful 
street art, charming restaurants and bars, and one of Pablo Neruda’s former 
homes. Head to the fish market, where you can sample the day’s catch and watch 
sea lions and pelicans on the beach. The city is loud, chaotic, and dirty in 
parts but that’s the price to pay for somewhere so characterful. Stay at the
Costa Azul B&B <http://www.costaazulvalparaiso.com/> (from $39 B&B), which 
offers harbour views and fantastic breakfasts.

Explore Colchagua valley on two wheels
 Cycling in the Colchagua valley. Photograph: Irena Peresa 
In Santa Cruz it seemed there were not many options for experiencing Colchagua 
valley beyond the standard organised visits or car rental. That is, until we 
stumbled upon Pepe and his bike rental service at Hostal del Centro. He made a 
simple map for biking around the valley. The two circuits include six wineries, 
where the staff were happy to receive cycling guests, sell wine by the glass or 
bottle (some even had picnic baskets on offer), and allowed us to roam freely 
through the vineyards. The price was about £12 a day per bike, with helmet and 
repair set.

Glacial lagoon hidden high up in the mountains

As a pair of city dwellers we were sceptical when our friend suggested a 
three-day hike over the Cerro Castillo mountains, but he assured us we could 
handle it and the views would be incredible. He wasn’t wrong. The hike goes 
through glades, forest paths, rushing clear rivers and rocky mountain passes. 
On day two, after a 10-hour hike up into the mountains, we discovered the 
bright blue glacial lagoon. Surrounded by a boulder field, the lagoon is fed by 
a melting glacier. We decided to brave the ice-cold waters for a quick skinny 
dip! The following day we treated ourselves to a meal atDalik restaurant 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Restaurant-Dali/278487858840685> in the town of 
Coyhaique – where the chef uses locally sourced ingredients to make delicious 
Patagonian dishes.

Geyser action – without the crowds

Hire a high-clearance vehicle in Iquique, take spare petrol and head up the 
Ruta 15 and turn off to Puchuldiza. You’ll have a geyser field all to yourself, 
with its own thermal pool and wild camping alongside. Go in winter and the 
geysers can freeze. The locally recommended thermal spa at Chusmiza is on the 
way.

La Chascona, Santiago, home of Pablo Neruda
 La Chascona. Photograph: Alamy 
Visiting one of the homes of Pablo Neruda, La Chascona, was a trip highlight. 
The house was named after (the ruffled hair of) his lover and then second wife, 
Matilde Urrutia. It’s a beautiful blend of 1950s architecture and furniture and 
is shaped liked a ship. It is built on a hill in a cultural area called 
Bellavista, where you can see the Andes from every angle. The Pinochet regime 
ransacked the house after the coup, and Neruda died soon after, but his wife 
decided to have his wake in the house and then rebuilt it in his honour. You 
can see his manuscripts, books and style everywhere

Step into the heart of Chilean government

In this age of intense security, few executives open their doors for the 
general public. However, La Moneda Palace in Santiago, which houses the Chilean 
president and her cabinet, is an exception. You can book a tour with an English 
guide; ours was a sincere and enthusiastic young man who wanted to improve his 
English. Chile is a country with a fascinating political history, and you could 
see the physical scars from this past on the walls of the building. Tours are 
available Monday-Friday and need to be booked at least a week in advance.

Take a pisco sour tour

Chile is well known for its pisco sour. For the best experience head up the 
Rio Turbio on the edge of the Atacama, and turn right up the Andes to the small 
village of Pisco Elqui. Destilería Mistral is where they make pisco from grape 
skins. The tour, the tastings, the bottles, the food, the view are all 
excellent. We stayed in the valley in Vicuña, atTerral Hotel 
<http://www.terralhotel.cl/en/>, where we sat on the terrace at night sipping 
those pisco sours and watching the sky.

Relax at Refugio Tinquilco, Huerquehue national park

to the volcano Villarrica. Photograph: Alamy 
I am alone in a wooden lodge next to a lake. The air smells of books. The 
scent changes. “Here’s your breakfast for tomorrow,” the owner says. “Fresh 
bread and homemade conserves. Be careful, it’s still hot to the touch.” This is 
Refugio Tinquilco, in the Andes, north-east of Pucón, on the doorstep of 
Huerquehue national park. Tourists come for the day, hike the major trail, go 
home. But stay … for the black bread. Stay for the fresh air and solitary 
hiking. Most importantly, stay for the sauna – your tired muscles will be 
grateful for it.

Annual chocolate festival, Pucón
 The sweetest thing … a chocolate replica of the Villarrica volcano. 
Photograph: Benjamin Simonson 
Famous for its volcanoes, lakes and hot springs, Pucón attracts tourists all 
year round. However, arrive in late June and you will experience the incredible 
annual chocolate festival. Here you can taste samples of artisan chocolate 
every which way you look, but the biggest attraction is a chocolate replica of 
the Villarrica volcano – 700kg of pure chocolate. On the final day it is 
smashed up, but fear not: you can queue up and grab a big slab of “lava”!

Buffalo Waffles is a small takeaway food shop in Santiago. It does waffle cone 
sandwiches with both sweet and savoury ingredients. Great for kids, adults, 
vegetarians, meat-eaters, and everyone in between. While waiting for your food,

If you want a great Chiloé experience, you can do worse than stay in a palafito
, such as thePalafito Hostel <http://palafitohostel.com/en/>. These wooden 
houses are built on stilts near the water’s edge, and are mainly found around 
Castro, the biggest town on the island. For about £35 a night, you get a 
beautiful room, great service and an amazing setting. The restaurant next door, 
theMar y Canela <http://www.marycanela.cl/>, serves delicacies such as octopus, 
crab andcuranto (a local dish of seafood and potatoes cooked underground).
