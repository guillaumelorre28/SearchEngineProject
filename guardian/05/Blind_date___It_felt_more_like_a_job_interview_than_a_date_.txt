Michael on Laura 

What were you hoping for?
 To meet my future girlfriend.

First impressions?
I usually get the introduction wrong on a first date so I was happy we both 
went for a hug.

What did you talk about?
Me, my job and her interest in computer hackers. I would have liked to have 
heard more about Laura but the questions kept on coming.

Any awkward moments?
I tried to kiss her to see if there was any spark. She said she doesn’t kiss 
on first dates. A part of me died inside.

Good table manners?
Very good.

Best thing about Laura?
She is open and talkative.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
Probably not.

Describe Laura in three words?
Talkative, bubbly, genuine.

What do you think she made of you?
That I was a nice person she could be friends with.

Did you go on somewhere?
We attempted to go to a cool bar nearby, but there was a 20-minute wait, so we 
went to All Bar One instead.

And... did you kiss?
No, I was rejected.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
Getting into that bar would have been nice.

Marks out of 10?
4. It felt more like a job interview than a date.

Would you meet again?
As friends, maybe.
