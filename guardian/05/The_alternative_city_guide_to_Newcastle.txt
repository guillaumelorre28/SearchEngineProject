Newcastle is famously a party town, a destination for stags and hens keen to 
hit the Bigg Market or the bling bars of Collingwood Street’s so-called Diamond 
Strip. But, as in any great northern city, there is another side to Newcastle. 
Look in the right places (Pilgrim Street’s Creative Quarter, orOuseburn Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/dec/22/ouseburn-newcastle-art-scene>, 
a stroll or short bus ride away), and there’s a tight-knit Geordie underground 
of agitators who, in their own punky, persistent way maintain a vibrant arts 
ecology – with a distinctive political edge.

They might be glibly dismissed as hipsters, but Newcastle’s creatives (many of 
them natives) are generally unpretentious doers working on shoestring budgets. 
They are quietly but unapologetically determined to carve out their own space 
in this frequently misunderstood city. That stubborn desire to make things 
happen in Newcastle dates back decades.

In the 1960s, a famous reading room, Morden Tower <http://www.mordentower.org/>
, brought icons such as Allen Ginsberg to town. The photographicSide Gallery 
<http://www.amber-online.com/side-gallery/> has been documenting working-class 
Newcastle since 1977. In a city where making a living from art can seem 
fanciful, projects are often happily uncommercial. Newcastle breeds relative 
musical oddballs such asBeth Jeans Houghton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beth-jeans-houghton>, Maxïmo Park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/maximopark>, Richard Dawson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/21/richard-dawson-singer-songwriter-one-to-watch>
 orEat Fast <https://www.facebook.com/eatfastmusic/>, as well as tiny, boutique 
record labels (Cel36 <http://cel36.com/>, 104 <https://104records.bandcamp.com/>
,alt.vinyl <http://www.altvinyl.com/>). There is nonetheless real camaraderie 
among its creative tribes and with other marginalised groups. Next year, techno 
night Backdrop will host Sound Of Solidarity, an event exploring the creation 
of safe, racially and sexually diverse club spaces. Such radical ideas are 
never far from the surface in Newcastle.

How much Newcastle city council values this can vary. At times, it has been 
instrumental in practically assisting grassroots creativity. For instance, it 
rehoused the DIY cinemaStar and Shadow <https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/> and 
helped turn several abandoned, city centre office blocks into temporary spaces 
for arts organisations. However, the Creative Quarter is in a precarious 
position. One block will soon go in the name of regeneration, and the council’s 
decision to allowthe demolition of community and arts centre Uptin House 
<http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/campaigners-devastated-after-controversial-uptin-12113546>
 has appalled campaigners such as artist and bar-ownerKathryn Hodgkinson 
<http://kathrynhodgkinson.com/>:

“We’re at the mercy of aggressive development that is annihilating a lot of 
these projects. A lot of what [the council] needs to do to protect this sector 
has nothing to do with money. It’s about having strong policies in place. We’ve 
got a spineless planning department. I think it needs to say no to more.”

On a narrow cut-through opposite Newcastle Central station, Pink Lane is a 
boon for travellers keen to swerve the chains and drink serious coffee. Using 
its own PLC Roastery beans, Pink Lane covers all the single-origin pour-over 
and espresso bases, and it knocks out a superlative flat white.

FOOD

Barrio Comida

Newly opened in two neatly decked-out Quayside shipping containers, US-born 
chef Shaun Hurrell’s taqueria is receiving rave reviews. “There’s nowt in 100 
miles offering anything remotely similar at that level,” saysnewcastleeats.co.uk
 <http://www.newcastleeats.co.uk/> blogger Jeff Lyall. He loves the “stunning” 
ceviche tostada, and the ox tongue and adobo pork tacos.

Wylam Brewery

In mid-2016, this craft brewery (try its Jakehead IPA) moved into the grade 
II-listed Palace of Arts, a remnant from the world’s fair-style North East 
Coast Exhibition of 1929. Now also a bar and a gig venue, it is, saysNARC. 
magazine <http://narcmagazine.com/> editor Claire Dupree, “an evocative 
setting”. The bar’s small-plates menu is impressive too, running to curried 
butternut squash, mint yoghurt and cucumber or battered oysters, sriracha mayo 
and burnt lime. “There’s none of the chips and pies you might expect; it’s all 
very good, fresh small plates,” says Cook House’s Anna Hedworth.
• Dishes £5-£8. Exhibition Park, 0191-650 0651, wylambrewery.co.uk

Peace and Loaf

By any measure Dave Coulson’s Jesmond restaurant is a one-off; which is why it 
isgenerating excitement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/19/peace-and-loaf-restaurant-review-jay-rayner>
 way beyond Newcastle. Coulson’s novel, technically elevated dishes (an opening 
“crisp sandwich”; a deconstructed full English on toast; a pot of luxurious 
mash ’n’ gravy), are clever, irreverent and delicious. Rarely is fine dining 
such fun.

San Marzano tomatoes and Campanian buffalo mozzarella, Cal’s Own – run by the

breathes it,” says Jeff Lyall.

Street food

Newcastle’s best-known street food event, Boiler Shop Steamer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/apr/07/newcastle-castle-city-break-uk>
, is in hibernation, but the scene it helped create is booming, as are the 
stars it spawned, such as Papa Ganoush and Nan Bei. For more Newcastle street 
food try the weeklyQuayside Sunday Market 
<https://www.facebook.com/Newcastle-Quayside-Sunday-Market-156612674483853> or 
Jesmond Food Market 
<https://twitter.com/JesFoodMkt?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
 (third Sat monthly). Also, alongside great beer, free gigs, film nights and 
craft markets, the newTyne Bank brewery <http://www.tynebankbrewery.co.uk/> tap 
(at 375 Walker Road) regularly hosts key street food traders.

CULTURE

The New Bridge Studios

Come April, this artists’ studio complex will need to find a new home, but, 
until then, be sure to visit its bookshop (which specialises in rare and 
self-published artists’ works) and its experimental, artist-led gallery, whose 
shows, says artist Kathryn Hodgkinson, are always “serious and very 
interesting”. New Bridge’s latest major project considered contemporary Britain 
under the title Hidden Civil War. In the same building, the “tiny, brilliant”
Alphabetti Theatre <http://www.alphabettitheatre.co.uk/> programmes new work in 
theatre, poetry and cabaret, as well as housing a neat little boho bar.

The Late Shows 
 Vane Gallery. 
Each May, Newcastle’s art hubs – from the Baltic <http://www.balticmill.com/> 
to hastily banged-together DIY spaces – throw open their doors for a two-day, 
late-night cultural crawl. Many of those involved, such as the self-explanatory
Northern Print <http://northernprint.org.uk/home.html>, exciting contemporary 
galleryVane <http://vane.org.uk/> or Ouseburn’s original, non-profit studio 
complex,36 Lime Street <http://36limestreet.co.uk/>, have exhibition spaces 
that are regularly open to the public, but several normally private spaces 
open, too. Similarly, November’sOuseburn Open Studios 
<http://ouseburnopenstudios.org/> sees artists and designers open workshops to 
talk with and sell directly to the public.
• Late Shows, 19 and 20 May, 2017, thelateshows.org.uk

Cobalt Studios

Now under the direction of furniture-maker Mark Collett and Kathryn Hodgkinson 
(who also run the bar, Ernest), Cobalt is keen to bring the public into its 
artist-maker world. Its pop-up events space has become a platform for all 
manner of creativity, from aBody Talk 
<http://narcmagazine.com/news-body-talk-cobalt-studios/> party with electro DJ 
Ivan Smagghe <https://www.facebook.com/ivansmagghe/> to gatherings of A Bit 
Crack, which stages storytelling evenings. Cobalt’s own quarterly shows blend 
art, performance and poetry with live music and DJs.

Breeze Creatives
 Social at Breeze Creatives. 
Energetic cultural facilitator Breeze manages artists’ studios and rehearsal 
and exhibition spaces in Bamburgh House, as well as its gallery, Abject, which 
shows diverse, interrogative work from national and international artists in 
all manner of media – from video installation to adventurous oil paintings. 
Breeze was also a main mover in last year’s Block Party, which saw the 
surrounding Creative Quarter come together for a late-night open-house.

Star and Shadow

More than just a cinema, Star and Shadow is a radical, socially engaged 
cultural nexus that enables grassroots music, debate and more. Following a move 
from its Stepney Bank site, it is being rebuilt by the volunteers who run it – 
opening in May 2017. “They’re a very special group,” says Hodgkinson. “They’ve 
all trained themselves in various techniques and they’re rebuilding it, brick 
by brick.” Star and Shadow has been putting on limited pop-up film events, but, 
otherwise, get your cinematic kicks at the local indie,Tyneside Cinema 
<https://www.tynesidecinema.co.uk/>.

MUSIC

World Headquarters
 Photograph: Tomasz Wojdak 
Since the early 1980s, and in various incarnations, World HQ has been a 
lynchpin of Newcastle’s underground scene. A politically charged, anti-racist 
rallying point in its early days, it is still commited to inclusivity – without 
being overly earnest about it. It operates over two self-contained floors 
within Curtis Mayfield House. “You might have a dub night going on downstairs 
and a major techno DJ on upstairs,” says Joe Clarke, co-promoter of the techno 
night, Backdrop. “World is incredible at bringing multi-genre music and 
different communities together.”

The Cluny 

It is now owned by regional brewery group Camerons, but the Cluny remains 
independent in spirit. As a meeting place and gig venue, it is essential to 
Newcastle’s alternative music scene. “It’s a venue everyone wants to play and 
be involved with. It just has that feeling,” says Bob Allan of music 
development agencyGenerator <http://generator.org.uk/>. The smaller, 
half-seated Cluny 2 room is, says NARC.’s Dupree, “really good for getting 
personal with a band: the stage isn’t very high, and it’s dark, intimate”.

Cosmic Ballroom

In Chinatown, this 300-capacity rave den is where, at nights such as ape-X, 
Bleep and Jaunt, Newcastle’s faithful come to restore mind, body and soul via 
the medium of underground electronic music. “Cosmic is true to house and 
techno, both in the club’s build – it has a rough-edged, warehouse feel – and 
in its incredible wall of sound,” says Clarke, whose Backdrop night features 
extended sets from DJs such as Levon Vincent and Jane Fitz (11 January).

Ad hoc
 The Cumberland Arms. Photograph: Alamy 
Aside from Think Tank? <http://www.thinktanknewcastle.com/#new-page-40>, 
Newcastle lacks tiny basements clubs where new bands can hone their sound. 
Instead, local promoters flit between sympathetic venues such as theCumberland 
Arms <http://www.thecumberlandarms.co.uk/>, the Dog and Parrot 
<http://thedogandparrot.co.uk/>, and the architecturally magnificent Mining 
Institute <https://mininginstitute.org.uk/>. The annual Evolution Emerging 
<http://evolutionemerging.com/> festival (May 2017) happens in bars, rehearsal 
rooms and artist studios across Ouseburn. “It’s a matter of getting creative 
with spaces because there aren’t loads of specific indie venues,” says 
organiser Bob Allan.

SR44 

Newcastle’s LGBT scene revolves around Times Square, and this warehouse space 
is the area’s most musically credible landmark. “It has Berlin style,” says Joe 
Clarke admiringly. Particularly when it plays host to the city’s best house and 
techno nights, such as Body Talk orMilk The Cow 
<http://www.milkthecowpodcast.com/>, expect to find a mixed gay and 
gay-friendly crowd here. “Milk The Cow is a bit of a movement,” says Clarke. 
“Its podcast covers social and political issues and it is great at bringing 
together people of different ages and ethnicities.”
