And so the galaxy far, far away expands even further. This could be considered 
an orbiting moon of planet Star Wars: the story of how the rebels got hold of 
those all-important Death Star plans. Felicity Jones leads a new cast of 
characters through a story that’s a little more grown-up than the core 
franchise, albeit with the requisite levels of no-expense-spared design and 
epic action.

A Parisian teen searches for his unknown father in this stylised, playful 
comedy, which is more distinctive than the set-up suggests. It’s like a cross 
between Robert Bresson and Wes Anderson, delivered with a deadpan wit, and 
taking in an impressive range of cultural references, from the Old Testament to 
the literary world.

With a title like that, you know you can give your brain a well-deserved 
festive break. And this mostly delivers, orchestrating its screwball mayhem 
with help from a stockingful of comic talents, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, 
TJ Miller and Kate McKinnon among them.

A canny bit of Star Wars counter-programming (though it is narrated by Daisy 
Ridley), this captivating documentary finds aerial action and alien landscapes 
on our home planet, by way of the unique Kazakh culture of training golden 
eagles. It’s traditionally a man’s activity but plucky, 13-year-old Aisholpan 
is set on becoming the first female to enter the national eagle-hunting 
championships.

If you haven’t seen this pre-Potter offshoot of JK Rowling’s wizarding world, 
it’s a pretty safe bet for any muggle family seeking a bit of escapist magic.
