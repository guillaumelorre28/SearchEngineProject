Oliver Twist is the story of an orphan who falls in with a gang of pickpockets 
in Victorian London, led by the wicked Fagin. It was adapted into a stage 
musical in 1960 and turned into a successful film in 1968, winning five Oscars, 
including best picture and best director for Carol Reed.

The new film, which is being made by Disney, will reportedly be a modern 
treatment of the story and will include several different musical genres, 
including hip-hop.

The story has been adapted for the screen many other times, including once by 
Disney in the 1988 animation Oliver & Company, in which the principal 
characters are cats and dogs.

Ice Cube rose to fame as part of the Los Angeles rap group NWA, who were 
profiled in last year’s biopicStraight Outta Compton
