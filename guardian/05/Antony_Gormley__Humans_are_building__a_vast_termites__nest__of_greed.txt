Antony Gormley <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gormley> says his 
first White Cube exhibition in four years, which opens in September, is driven 
by “more of a sense of urgency” than any other show he has done. From the 
warming of our climate and the acidification of our seas to cities dominated by 
skyscrapers – “nothing more than expressions of virile corporate power,” says 
Gormley – the artist’s despair at society’s failure to take action has filtered 
unavoidably into his latest work.

How we made The Angel of the North

“We are living in a really strange time,” Gormley said. “Yet we are all 
sleepwalking through it. And it is urgent we wake up. We are sort of aware the 
centre cannot hold, that 250 years of industrial activity has undermined and 
fundamentally disturbed our world – yet we feel somehow not responsible.”

Gormley, known best for his Angel of the North 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/29/how-we-made-the-angel-of-the-north>
 sculpture that stands outside Gateshead, will transform the White Cube in 
London into a labyrinth of 15 chambers containing a series of human figures, 
all of different materials, sizes and postures. At the heart of the show will 
be Sleeping Field, an installation of about 600 small, block-work cast-iron 
figures, all lying down. Collectively they will resemble a modern cityscape 
seen from the air.

I don’t see London’s towers expressing much more than the testosterone of a 
late capitalist society

The exhibition is his first at White Cube Bermondsey since his 2012 staging of 
Model 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/27/antony-gormley-model-white-cube>
, which was formed of a single giant steel body people could walk or climb 
through. He describes his new show as “very much a sequel” to that exhibition.

Sleeping Field is inspired by the corporate expansion Gormley has witnessed in 
London, the city he haslived and worked in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2015/oct/22/antony-gormley-london-squatted-how-things-changed-video>
 for most of his life. More than half the world is living in serviced urban 
environments “of cappuccinos and smartphones”, said the artist, who is 
concerned about the impact this has on our collective imaginations.

Antony Gormley: ‘London is bought, developed and abandoned’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2015/oct/22/antony-gormley-london-squatted-how-things-changed-video>
“It is absolutely extraordinary to see the transition happening to London,” 
Gormley said. “Up to this point the towers have been the exception, not the 
rule. But it is fascinating to see howLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> is being transformed overnight from a 
terraced housing-based city to Dallas or something closer to Abu Dhabi.”

Are Shoreditch skyscrapers a London tower too far, even for Boris Johnson?

Gormley laments the unchanging priority of corporate values over social values 
as the skyline rises higher and higher. “I don’t see those towers expressing 
much more than the testosterone of a late capitalist society,” he added.

The work’s title speaks to Gormley’s belief that we have all become “blind, 
sleeping servants” of a system that creates everything for us with ease and yet 
perpetuates social injustice and an unequal distribution of resources.

His hope is that Sleeping Field will force us all to take a necessary step 
back and realise “we are making the equivalent of a vast termites’ nest” and 
that “we are all participants in this process”.

 The rest of the works in the show are as much about making the viewer aware 
of their own bodies as corporate greed. Visitors will encounter these figures 
as they move through the gallery’s labyrinth of fake walls or, in the case of 
Cave – a dark, 12-metre long, human shaped tunnel – physically enter the 
sculpture itself.

“I want every room to be a catalyst for you to become very aware of your 
scale, your heart beating, your breathing pattern,” said Gormley. “I want to 
make it deeply unnerving, releasing us from our prejudices and our expectation 
about what a sculpture is and how it might act on us.”

Many works are so large – one 13-tonne figure made from 22 blocks of concrete 
resembles “a rather relaxed Buddha” – they will have to be put in the gallery 
and the fake walls built up around them. “It’s just exploding in all different 
ways,” Gormley said from his studio. “Things are manic but incredibly good fun.”
