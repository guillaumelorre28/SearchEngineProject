This is a fail-safe dish that's great to have up your sleeve. Because the 
couscous is not only hydrated but also baked in stock with flavour-giving 
goodies, this feels more like a proper meal than a regular couscous salad 
(which, let's face it can sometimes be rather dull and dry).

Serves 6

8 handfuls of couscous, or around 350g
4 chicken breasts, skin off, cut roughly into big chunks
2 tsp dried chilli
A few good pinches of cinnamon
8 garlic cloves, crushed
1½ tbsp curry powder
Salt
8 tbsp olive oil
2 handfuls of raisins or sultanas
40g butter
A small handful of pinenuts
A small handful of mint leaves, roughly chopped
A big handful of coriander, roughly chopped

1. Preheat the oven to 220C/gas 7. Mix up the chilli, cinnamon, garlic, curry 
powder, a couple of pinches of salt and half the olive oil into a sloppy paste 
in a bowl and roll the chopped chicken pieces around in it. Leave it to 
marinate as you prepare the couscous.

2. Put the couscous in a big bowl with the sultanas and the rest of the 
oil. Stir until all the grains are well-oiled, pour on 400ml boiling water and 
cover with clingfilm. After 10 minutes, mix in the chicken with some seasoning 
and spread out in an ovenproof casserole dish about 35cm x 25cm.

3. Pour on just under a mug of water, dot the butter on the top in about 8 
knobs and put it in the oven for 25 minutes. The dish should have nice 
crunchy-looking couscous bits on top, so if necessary, brown under the grill 
for a few minutes extra.

4. Now divide into lunchable portions and scatter some pinenuts and chopped 
herbs on top.
