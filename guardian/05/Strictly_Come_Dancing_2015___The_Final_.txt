So that is really is another year of Strictly over, and I’d like to say a 
massive thank you to everyone who has read and shared this blog, along with all 
of you who have turned up every week and been entirely hilarious and insightful 
in the comment box, or popped by and said hello on Twitter (@heidistephens, in 
case you haven’t). This has grown into a brilliant community of Strictly fans, 
and it makes this blog so much more of a pleasure to write. I really cannot 
thank you enough.


That’s my liveblogging duties done for another year (no Christmas special 
blog, sorry), but I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a 
wonderful Christmas and a happy 2016 – we’ll do this same time next year, yeah?


Thanks again, and keeeeeep dancing! Hx

Jay looks properly shellshocked. The pair of them have an incredible 
chemistry, it’s been an extraordinary dance partnership to watch. Am really 
happy for them.

And FINALLY, it’s time to announce the winner! The 2015 Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing> champions 
are…JAY AND ALIONA.

WELL. I thought they might lose it this evening, but the fan force was too 
strong. Not the finish they would have wanted, but it didn’t matter in the end.


Poor Kevin…so close, but yet so far. Maybe next year.

Ooh, a plug for the Christmas special! I was there for the recording of this, 
it was brilliant. Worth it for Shirley Bassey alone.

Time for a final dance from the Class of Strictly 2015. DOD is singing into a 
hairbrush, Anthony is boxing, Carol has an umbrella and Pasha is under a cloud. 
Jeremy is on his giant plastic horse, Jamelia is demonstrating that she was 
actually a really good dancer, Peter Andre is leaping, Helen and Anita are 
getting hurled around and this is all kind of amazing, in a batshit kind of way.

Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Ellie Goulding doing the song from 
50 Shades. If you want to recreate the next three minutes in your own time, 
just go into the kitchen, put on a blindfold and pop a fishbone into the 
blender.

So here’s where I am. Even thought I was a bit disappointed with Jay and 
Aliona’s first two dances tonight, they’ve still been my favourite all series. 
But I loved Georgia’s Charleston, and Giovanni has really grown on me. Yet 
technically Kevin and Kellie outshone the other two couples tonight. But Jay is 
still the better dancer overall, I think, and he’s had a JOURNEY. But so has 
Georgia.

OH GOD I’M SO CONFUSED.

Scores: 9,10,10,10 – a final 39 for Kellie and Kevin. Which puts them at the 
top of the purely notional leaderboard, and Jay and Aliona at the bottom. I 
genuinely have no idea how this is going to go.

Craig thought Kellie was one of the most exciting performers in the 
competition, especially as she’s working two jobs. Darcey thought she was the 
princess of precision, with incredible timing. Len thought she put the star in 
Star Wars, he loves watching Kellie and Kevin dance and thinks they deserve to 
win. Bruno thought it was better the second time round, with more wit, 
inventiveness and attention to detail.

close  
So that is really is another year of Strictly over, and I’d like to say a 
massive thank you to everyone who has read and shared this blog, along with all 
of you who have turned up every week and been entirely hilarious and insightful 
in the comment box, or popped by and said hello on Twitter (@heidistephens, in 
case you haven’t). This has grown into a brilliant community of Strictly fans, 
and it makes this blog so much more of a pleasure to write. I really cannot 
thank you enough.


That’s my liveblogging duties done for another year (no Christmas special 
blog, sorry), but I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a 
wonderful Christmas and a happy 2016 – we’ll do this same time next year, yeah?


Thanks again, and keeeeeep dancing! Hx

 
Jay looks properly shellshocked. The pair of them have an incredible 
chemistry, it’s been an extraordinary dance partnership to watch. Am really 
happy for them.
 
And FINALLY, it’s time to announce the winner! The 2015 Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing> champions 
are…JAY AND ALIONA.

WELL. I thought they might lose it this evening, but the fan force was too 
strong. Not the finish they would have wanted, but it didn’t matter in the end.


Poor Kevin…so close, but yet so far. Maybe next year.

 
Time for a final judges’ montage. Len says it’s the most exciting series ever. 
Hmm, I’m not sure that’sentirely true, is it?
 
Ooh, a plug for the Christmas special! I was there for the recording of this, 
it was brilliant. Worth it for Shirley Bassey alone.
 
Time for a final dance from the Class of Strictly 2015. DOD is singing into a 
hairbrush, Anthony is boxing, Carol has an umbrella and Pasha is under a cloud. 
Jeremy is on his giant plastic horse, Jamelia is demonstrating that she was 
actually a really good dancer, Peter Andre is leaping, Helen and Anita are 
getting hurled around and this is all kind of amazing, in a batshit kind of way.
 
Goodness, will this ever end? This is the longest VT of all time.
 
The vote it now closed! Time for another montage. If there is any alcohol left 
in your house, drink it now.
 
Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Ellie Goulding doing the song from 
50 Shades. If you want to recreate the next three minutes in your own time, 
just go into the kitchen, put on a blindfold and pop a fishbone into the 
blender.
 
Text from daughter: “If Jay doesn’t win I’m going to be VERY upset”. Well, 
that settles it then. Family always comes first, Jay it is.
 
Hang on, there’s 20 minutes to go. How the hell are we going to fill that?
 
So here’s where I am. Even thought I was a bit disappointed with Jay and 
Aliona’s first two dances tonight, they’ve still been my favourite all series. 
But I loved Georgia’s Charleston, and Giovanni has really grown on me. Yet 
technically Kevin and Kellie outshone the other two couples tonight. But Jay is 
still the better dancer overall, I think, and he’s had a JOURNEY. But so has 
Georgia.

OH GOD I’M SO CONFUSED.

 
Scores: 9,10,10,10 – a final 39 for Kellie and Kevin. Which puts them at the 
top of the purely notional leaderboard, and Jay and Aliona at the bottom. I 
genuinely have no idea how this is going to go.
 
Craig thought Kellie was one of the most exciting performers in the 
competition, especially as she’s working two jobs. Darcey thought she was the 
princess of precision, with incredible timing. Len thought she put the star in 
Star Wars, he loves watching Kellie and Kevin dance and thinks they deserve to 
win. Bruno thought it was better the second time round, with more wit, 
inventiveness and attention to detail.
