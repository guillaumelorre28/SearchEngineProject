Pick a side in the battle of the period dramas

Spotless empire-line dresses or men in grubby band T-shirts? Two big period TV 
dramas air in January, providing fashion fodder for all. If you’re fond of the 
kind of skinny scarf habitually draped around the neck of one of Kate Moss’s 
boyfriends, then 1970s-set, Mick Jagger-producedHBO rock series Vinyl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2015/aug/07/hbo-vinyl-martin-scorsese-mick-jagger>
 is likely to be your poison. If you like your style more refined – think 
military coats, cravats and furry hats – trythe BBC’s War & Peace 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-BCmUeHE5c> for size.

Perfect your flicky eyeliner

From Belfast in February to Mexico City in November, 2016 will be dominated by 
lachrymose singalongs thanks to Adele’s gargantuan world tour. If you can’t get 
your Breakfast at Tiffany’s cats eyeliner right in this climate there really is 
no hope for you.

Do Delacroix hair

The sure-to-be blockbuster Delacroix exhibition opens at the National Gallery 
on 17 February, and the painter’s own grooming could hardly be more 2016. See:
this handsome snapshot 
<http://a3.files.biography.com/image/upload/c_fit,cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80,w_620/MTE1ODA0OTcxMzcwMzE3MzI1.jpg>
 which looks a lot like the result of a passionate affair between David Beckham 
and Poldark. The facial hair! The shaggy barnet! Men: print out immediately and 
take to the hairdresser. (And try not to think about the Edina Monsoon’s “
Lacroix, sweetie, Lacroix” moment in Absolutely Fabulous 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFqHlliWmVY> when you do.)

Leave the house in your pants

Exhibitionists will be pleased to hear that one of 2016’s headline fashion 
trends is underwear as outerwear – yes, nighties as dresses and bras as tops. 
Fittingly, the V&A’s big spring exhibition,Undressed: A Brief History of 
Underwear 
<http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-undressed-a-brief-history-of-underwear/about-the-exhibition/>
 is big on corsets, crinolines and gender-neutral underpants. It’s the sort of 
show you can get away with attending in your smalls.
 iPhone 6 case from Skinny Dip 
 Ensure sure you have a decent iPhone case

Fashion and tech have been flirting for years, but in 2016 they are making it 
official. The headline exhibitionat the Metropolitan Museum in New York 
<http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/manus-x-machina> will take 
“fashion in an age of technology” as its theme – as will its attendant red 
carpet shebang, the Met Ball. This just serves as a reminder that the humble 
iPhone case has become the most high-profile accessory many of us use, so make 
sure yours is a good’un. Know that there is absolutely no point trying to be 
tasteful here, and veer towardsfried eggs, rockets or gold flamingos 
<https://www.skinnydiplondon.com/collections/phone/products/iphone-6-plus-gold-flamingo-case?variant=1144926329>
 – something knowingly silly that makes you smile.

Say it with flowers

There’s more to Georgia O’Keeffe than those lush orchids, as summer’s Tate 
Modern retrospective will prove 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/georgia-okeeffe>. 
Still, it will be the blooms that draw in the crowds and provide wardrobe 
inspiration, too, given fashion’s current fascination with florals (seenew-era

Reclaim the tracksuit

In a satisfying synergy, the excitement around the Rio Olympics is coinciding 
with the high-fashion resurgence of the tracksuit – as seen on catwalks from 
Chloe to Gucci to AMI. Get set, zip up, and go.
