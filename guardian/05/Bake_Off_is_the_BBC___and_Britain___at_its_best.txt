Well done to Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc for refusing to sell out (Bake Off 
presenters ‘refuse to go with the dough’

, 14 September). “The BBC nurtured the show from its infancy,” as they said, 
and produced a series that has all the ingredients of Britain at its best: 
humour, kindness and quality. Now it is to be sold to Channel 4, where viewers 
will have to endure a dumbed-down version and inane adverts – if we continue to 
watch it. What next? Strictly Come Dancing, the Proms, David Attenborough, 
Antiques Roadshow? We must protect the BBC and its licence fee. I hope that 
Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood follow Sue and Mel’s lead and also refuse to 
“go with the dough”.

• The government will surely not be surprised to find that professionals at 
the peak of their careers are paid more than £150,000 (BBC forced to reveal 
salaries of star names 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/14/bbc-presenters-pay-to-be-made-public>
, 15 September). Another area of interest might be production costs. Why did 
the BBC send four stars and crew to California to presentBig Blue Live 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02v036z>, when one would have done? Why does 
Brian Cox travel halfway round the world for a two-minute clip? Perhaps each 
programme should show its production cost after the credits. That would help us 
decide if we are getting value for money.

• Your story on BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> salary 
transparency noted the corporation’s concerns that the government proposals 
might become a poacher’s charter. The evidence this week from the Great British 
Breakout is to the contrary. There are a few organisations around the world 
whose prestige, corporate culture and values help their employees resist 
lucrative offers from less-celebrated competitors.

My Indian students often explained to me how for them a life-long career with 
Tata was highly prized, regardless of relatively modest remuneration. The same 
was certainly true for the BBC. Of course, times and corporate fortunes change.

• If the BBC is losing Bake Off for want of an extra £10m, why don’t we just 
have a quick whip-round among the 10 million loyal viewers who watched the 
series start this year? If we each chuck in a quid, that would see it safe back 
where it belongs, hopefully complete with Mel ’n’ Sue ’n’ Mary ’n’ Paul … 
raising enough and keeping the right mix.

• Assume Match of the Day has similar cultural value to Bake Off. If the BBC 
paid £204m in 2015 for three years of MOTD, with less than half as many viewers 
(Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/loss-great-british-bake-off-bbc-rise-again-gbbo>
, 14 September), the coalition government had good reason to reduce its budget. 
Watching ad-heavy football highlights on ITV would have been a price worth 
paying for £204m of original BBC programmes. The government was set on 
downsizing the BBC with or without MOTD.

• Charlotte Higgins’ otherwise excellent article (The loss of Bake Off is a 
blow, but the BBC will rise again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/loss-great-british-bake-off-bbc-rise-again-gbbo>
, 14 September) misses perhaps the most significant factor in the loss of the 
programme by the BBC. Love Productions, owned by Sky, falls under the ultimate 
control of Rupert Murdoch, a man avowed to the hobbling of the BBC as a 
provider of quality popular programming.

• The government’s order to the BBC to publish details of all salaries above 
£150,000 is clearly designed to give the private TV companies a competitive 
advantage. But why are so many BBC employees being paid enormous salaries 
anyway? Are these people so supremely talented that they warrant earning five 
or six times the average wage?

The BBC has been very good at uncovering new talent via open competitions: why 
not have a few programmes to showcase new talent in presenting journalism? They 
could bring a fresh and invigorating approach to at least some of these 
so-called top jobs, as well as releasing money needed for programmes,

• Only four months ago the BBC was under attack from the then culture 
secretary John Whittingdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/bbc-john-whittingdale-white-paper-star-pay-board>
, who was using the corporation’s charter renewal to lean on them for making 
too many programmes that were popular. Disguised as a concern about 
“distinctiveness”, popular BBC programmes like the Voice, Strictly Come Dancing 
and the Great British Bake Off were not considered to be good value for the 
public’s TV licence fee. But despite government interference and criticism, 
cuts, reallocation of its funds to pay for the over-75s’ licence fee, the BBC 
continues to use public money make high-quality radio and television programmes 
that are distinctively a part of our shared national culture. Although 
Whittingdale rowed back from the more extreme predictions of his white paper 
there is no question that the BBC has very few friends in government or among 
the free-market ideologues that would prefer it to leave popular programmes to 
profit-making companies.

Love Productions, in which Sky owns a majority stake, may be popping the 
champagne corks after their £25m deal, but they may find that Bake Off’s 
popularity will not transfer toChannel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> because there will be little love 
for them from a nation who see it as quintessentially British and very BBC.

• The BBC may have inadvertently stumbled across the perfect replacement to 
the Great British Bake Off. The corporation should televise evening cricket 
matches and, between innings, members of the public can bring homemade cakes 
for Test Match Special’s Aggers, Blowers and Tuffers to sample and judge. The 
perfect amalgam of two great British traditions (Eight-city T20 tournament gets
