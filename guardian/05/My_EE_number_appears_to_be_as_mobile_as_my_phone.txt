I have just read your article (“EE has given my pay-as-you-go number to 
someone else 
<http:www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/07/pay-as-you-go-number-given-away-ee>
”) regarding someone who had had the same mobile number for 16 years which was 
then mysteriously reallocated by EE .

When my pay-as-you-go sim stopped working, EE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/everything-everywhere> told me that 
someone else was now using that number and the fraud department was 
investigating.

A week later, I was informed that the number had been cancelled and they could 
give me no further information as they could no longer identify me. They have 
simply told me to go into a store and get a new sim and number.

I have had my number since the mid 1990s, so this is extremely inconvenient. 

Moreover, I had £10 credit on that pay-as-you-go sim. SS, London

EE blames an administrative error that removed your number, but won’t go into 
further detail to you, or me.

Your old number has now been returned to you, along with a promised goodwill 
gesture. This turns out to be £10, which was then upped to £25, then to £50.

If you hadn’t involved the media it’s doubtful you’d have got anywhere since 
its authentication system no longer recognised you as the owner of that number. 
Dismal service indeed.
