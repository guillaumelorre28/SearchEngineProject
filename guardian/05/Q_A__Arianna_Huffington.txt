What is your greatest fear? 
My greatest fear always revolves around my daughters. Also, forgetting my 
BlackBerry and iPhone chargers.

What is your earliest memory? 
The smell of clover, honey, cinnamon, orange and brandy wafting from the 
kitchen. Growing up in Athens, I looked forward to the holidays, when my mother 
would bakemelomakarona <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melomakarono>, the 
traditional Greek Christmas cookies.

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? 
A tendency to miss the moment by being distracted, mostly by technology.

What was your most embarrassing moment? 
Showing up at the Cambridge Union with a thick Greek accent. I gradually 
overcame the embarrassment (though I was less successful with the accent).

Where would you like to live? 
India, without question. I first went there when I was 17 and it has been my 
favourite country ever since.

What would your super power be? 
The ability to go into a deep sleep on command.

What is your most unappealing habit? 
Attachment to my four BlackBerrys.

What do you most dislike about your appearance? 
My very, very curly hair. (Yes, it is very, very curly. Trust me.)

What makes you unhappy? 
Being tired.

If you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose? 
Letter-writing.

To whom would you most like to say sorry, and why? 
I say sorry to people as I go along.

What or who is the greatest love of your life? 
My daughters, Christina and Isabella – in a tie.

Have you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it? 
Never without meaning it. Sometimes wondering, "What was I thinking?"

Who would you invite to your dream dinner party? 
I'd like to convene some of history's greatest nappers: Leonardo da Vinci, 
Winston Churchill, John F Kennedy.

Which words or phrases do you most overuse? 
"Unplug and recharge."

What has been your biggest disappointment? 
I was crushed when my second book was rejected by 37 publishers.

If you could edit your past, what would you change? 
In 2000, my father was ill in Athens. I was due to give a speech in Wisconsin, 
and straight after the speech I flew to Greece. He died just as I landed. I 
wish that I had cancelled the speech and left sooner.

If you could go back in time, where would you go? 
Sitting in on some of the tutoring sessions between two of my countrymen, 
Aristotle and Alexander.

How often do you have sex? 
That's between me and the NSA.
