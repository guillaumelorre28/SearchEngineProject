When you first meet Dam-Funk it takes a few minutes to tune into his 
frequency. The producer has a laconic Californian drawl, drives an impeccable 
vintage Cadillac, and uses lingo that’s part John Singleton script and part 
Sheryl Sandberg self-help book. One minute he’s talking about respect and the 
“G-code” from under Eazy-E-style shades, the next how his new album is “mainly 
about inviting positivity in your life”. But if Dam-Funk’s mission statement 
had to be summed up in its simplest form it would be this: he’s here to “give 
funk a facelift”.

Specifically, Dam (real name Damon Riddick) is on a quest to reinvigorate the 
flamboyant, coiffured funk and R&B that the likes of Roger Troutman and Rick 
James laid down in the 80s. For him, funk is much more than James Brown doing 
the splits onstage; it’s also innovators such as Slave, Zapp and Leroy Burgess, 
who replaced funk’s horns and breaks with synths and drum machines, creating a 
futuristic, exotic take on the genre.

Riddick calls his take on this music “modern funk”, and it’s a style that has 
attracted a stable of underground, global enthusiasts, such as Kansas City’s 
Reggie B, Dutch funksters Henning and L33, and the Actress-approved producer 
Moon B. “The chords that we’re using evoke the feeling that you could have a 
glass of wine to it, but still ride down the street banging,” he explains. 
“It’s not just nerdville. Modern funk is sophisticated; you could sit on the 
balcony and watch the sun set to the music.”

It’s a formula that’s garnered a cult fanbase and an increasing list of 
big-name followers. He’s contributed vocoderised vocals to Hudson Mohawke’s 
album Butter and toured with Erykah Badu and Flying Lotus. In 2013 he teamed up 
withSnoop Dogg <https://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg> for the album 7 
Days Of Funk, his production dove-tailing with Snoop’s West Coast G-funk sound. 
Meanwhile, Riddick’s new album, Invite The Light, features appearances from 
modern funk converts as diverse as Ariel Pink, Q-Tip and Flea from Red Hot 
Chili Peppers.

Yet it hasn’t been an easy rehabilitation process for Riddick’s favoured brand 
of funk. One reason is that this garish variety is perhaps most famous for 
being lampooned by Eddie Murphy’s Jheri-curled narcissists in Coming To 
America, and by Dave Chappelle in his Prince and Rick James skits. This funk 
may have sounded like the cooler transatlantic cousin of glam rock, but its 
platform boots and ice-white suits made it just as easy to ridicule as Noddy 
Holder and Alvin Stardust. “The Dave Chappelle thing took funk to comedy status 
and we’re trying to work out of that,” says Riddick sagely.

The other reason is that when hip-hop began to take off, it was the earlier 
James Brown-influenced funk that was fetishised; DJs such as Premier and Shadow 
would sample it and turn it into sought-after catnip for beat heads. Riddick, 
however, felt that the funk he championed was being wrongfully overlooked.

“Stuff like Zapp, P-Funk All-Stars and Prince …” he says; “Independent labels 
were into this other type of funk because ours was too black for them, so they 
were starting to big up a certain Get On The Good Foot type of vibe. It felt 
like those people were turning funk into something else.”

Riddick has been keeping the faith for some time now. He had some early 
success with his production work for LA rappers Mack 10 and Compton’s Most 
Wanted, as well as being hand-picked by Shalamar producer Leon Sylvers III to 
helpdisgraced lip-syncers Milli Vanilli 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VLKU4h18EU> record their comeback LP. In the 
end, the Milli Vanilli album never happened (apparently they partied a bit too 
hard when they should have been working) and Riddick’s own career began to 
stall.

He took on day jobs such as delivery driver, record shop assistant, trainee 
barber and car window tinter, producing thousands of hours of music in his 
spare time and storing the tapes in shoeboxes. Some of that music makes its way 
on to Riddick’s SoundCloud page, but his recordings have have another, deeper 
purpose.

“[They] were a part of chronicling my life – different girlfriends, jobs, 
crazy stuff. They were my own diary,” he says.

His break finally came when Peanut Butter Wolf, the boss of 
backpacker-pleasing Stones Throw records, heard his tracks on MySpace and 
pulled out a selection for a debut release, 2009’sToeachizown

It’s not just nerdville. Modern funk is sophisticated
Dam-Funk 
Despite those 21 years on the margins, Riddick isn’t bitter. In fact, he beams 
out a relentless, almost unbelievable positivity, something that is all over 
Invite The Light. Tracks with names such as Just Ease Your Mind From All 
Negativity and Virtuous Progression give the impression of a cosmic meditation 
tape rather than a funk workout. (This mindset extends to social media, too: 
his Instagram account is littered with pithy maxims about “keeping going” and 
“not giving up on your dreams”.)

The album is also directly linked to Riddick’s formative years growing up in 
Pasadena, California, where he lived during the time of Rodney King and the LA 
riots, the Bell Curve, and the racist concept of “Super Predators” (hyper 
aggressive, inner-city – ie black and Latino – young men). “My area was a gang 
area – it was Bloods – and I survived that,” he says. “I never really got 
involved, but that was my city. It is something that I identify with.”

Although he was exposed to violence and gang activity, Riddick is keen to 
point out that Pasadena had a positive side, at least for a while. “There were 
people who would listen to Slave in my area or P-Funk with the door open and 
you would see the weed smoke coming out, but they went to work every fucking 
day. They had money then, disposable income. You had the clothes, the records, 
you smoked weed, you had a car and then the crack shit came.


“It changed a lot of things, especially in Pasadena,” he recalls. “It was the 
hustle. When that shit came in, younger people said: ‘Oh, I can make some 
money’. So people started selling it to older people and so in turn it fucked 
up the older generation.”

Tracks such as 2009’s Brookside Park reference specific areas, but Riddick’s 
beats also give the feeling of time and place. He hasn’t changed his vintage 
set-up – a Roland Juno keyboard, Linn drum machine and Oberheim DMX synth – 
since he began making those tapes in 1988. Even so, Riddick would rather not 
disclose his exact age (according to the internet he was born in 1971), seeing 
himself as more of a perennial funk ambassador.

“If you’re not careful the guys who started this stuff, or pushed it to the 
forefront; they’re relegated as the ‘old-school guys’,” he says. “No, 
motherfucker, I’m not no old-school guy. I’m not old schoolor new school. I’m 
timeless. When I say timeless, you never thought of the age of Frank Zappa, you 
never thought of the age of Prince, you never thought of the age of George Duke 
or Miles Davis. I want to be that type of artist.”

Clearly, Riddick truly believes in the power of funk. So much so, he thinks 
the music might serve a higher purpose. “If you were flying over the Earth, 
would you stop if you were another civilisation? You’d look down at us, and 
we’re still swinging machetes and talking behind each others’ backs. You’d just 
keep going. I’m trying to make a record so that if another civilisation passed 
by, they would be able to pick up this record, or they’d beam it up, and they 
would think: ‘Oh, they have human beings down here like that.’”

If they find his frequency, they might be pleasantly surprised.
