Neighbours said scores of paramedics, police cars and an air ambulance were 
called to a home in Wakefield at 2.14pm on Wednesday.

A spokesman for West Yorkshire police described the collision as a “tragic 
incident” and said inquiries were ongoing to establish what had happened. The 
child’s age has not been released.

The incident is understood to have happened on Lingwell Nook Lane, a quiet 
country road in the village of Lofthouse, about three miles north of Wakefield.

A neighbour, Reave Westwell, 21, said: “I was at the front of my house and 
emergency response cars sped past. It’s a quiet lane in the middle of fields 
and I just walked down and the air ambulance was circling quite low. It landed 
in the field opposite.

“Then I heard lots of sirens and police cars and ambulances. They all hurried 
up the road and blocked it off. At one point there were three ambulances and 
nine police cars. All the neighbours were coming out and looking. Police said 
it was a sensitive issue. I’m just a bit shocked because it’s a really quiet 
road.”

Another neighbour, Ian Whitworth, told BBC Radio Leeds: “I’m completely 
devastated, completely shocked. It’s a small road and although we don’t know 
each other intimately we know each other well enough to say hi. I can’t imagine 
how awful it must be and I feel terrible for the family.”

Another resident, Ian Fryer, was quoted by the BBC saying: “I heard the 
helicopter landing at about 2pm and then the next minute loads of police 
arriving, ambulances, and I just stood out in the street for a little while 
with the neighbours looking at what had happened.”
