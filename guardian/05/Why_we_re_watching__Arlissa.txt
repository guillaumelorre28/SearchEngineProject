Excellent pins! Who is she? Steady on. This is Arlissa <http://www.arlissa.com>
, an artist set for big things in 2013. She has the music biz in a tizz and 
hasn't even had a single out yet.

Oh yeah, what are they saying? "Big vocals and even bigger choruses"; "set to 
become the sound of 2013 – a star is born 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/19/arlissa-new-band>", "[This is] 
Arlissa's first step on the ladder towards superstardom"… I could go on.

I get it. There's a fuss. What's her music like? Going by the first single, a 
big, glossily produced collaboration with American hip-hop artistNas 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nas>, she's the latest in a long line of 
smooth-vocalled female R&B artists, but a listen to her solo demos show she's a 
bitFlorence and the Machine <http://florenceandthemachine.net/> and a bit 
Jessie Ware <http://jessieware.com/>.

Sounds hard to place. Is she American? Nope, south London born and bred by an 
American mum and German dad.Arlissa <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arlissa> 
decided to stick to music writing after high school while working in a clothes 
shop to fund studio sessions.

Do we have an R&B/indie hybrid on our hands? Who knows? She writes a brilliant 
song, she has a wonderful voice, and there are plans for her to be doing "big 
things" in the States come the new year.

She says: "Kate Bush  <http://www.katebush.com/home>is my biggest influence. 
I'd like a career like hers."

We say: Make room – pop's latest young lady is about to land.
