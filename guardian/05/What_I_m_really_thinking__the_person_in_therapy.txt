There are certain topics of conversation that will stop anyone in their 
tracks. Admitting to having a weekly therapy habit is, in my experience, the 
pinnacle of ending small talk. Brits tend to frown upon therapy as a weekly 
expenditure – £40 an hour, if you must know. I get that. However, I don’t 
understand people who spend £40 on their nails once a week, so let’s call it 
even.

Therapy is, to most, the Freudian movie version. A bespectacled, bearded, 
German-accented old man in a wing-backed chair, pipe in mouth, asking me (lying 
on a sofa, like a damsel) how that makes me feel. However, my therapist is 
young, with a beard (in a hipster way, not a Gandalf way), and I can assure you 
I have never lain down on a sofa, although I do sit on one.

There is no suggestion that every thought I have can be traced back to my 
mother or my father, or phallic analogies. We talk about the things that keep 
me awake at night, the flashbacks to my past that happen in the middle of my 
day-to-day life. Freud has never been mentioned. I have seen nine therapists 
and psychiatrists to get to this point, and it hasn’t been easy. What we talk 
about now isn’t easy, either. It’s not meant to be.

What I’m really thinking: the au pair

I don’t know that it matters why I spend 12% of my monthly income paying a 
stranger to listen to my dark confessions. I find huge relief in talking to 
someone who has no stake in my life and who can help me work out why some days 
are harder than others. So, if I mention therapy to you, please don’t balk. 
Just smile and nod while you admire your £40 manicure.
