While you are examining the art, I am observing you. As a gallery attendant in 
a regional institution that has exhibits that punch above their weight, and 
could find their way into any modern art gallery in the world, there is 
considerable context to the works. I see those who get that, but many don’t. 
Some move through the installations as they engage with life – they skim the 
surface, scrolling for something entertaining, wanting to be knocked on the 
head rather than exploring unfamiliar colours, fabrics and textures. But a cat 
video on Facebook this is not. Even now, some can’t let go of the mobile. I see 
parents scrolling through messages while their children treat the gallery as a 
playground. Or worse, the hapless child who stands forlorn and dismayed among 
the exhibits while Mum checks Twitter.

What I’m really thinking: the hypochondriac

But for every bored viewer there are those who delve much deeper. One day a 
week I offer tours. The self-selected arrive and are hungry to know more. I am 
happy to tell them about the materials used in the construction of the pieces, 
the references, the context. I have spoken with the artists and have spent time 
with the curator. My narrative can take these visitors into a different sphere, 
where the magic and power of art begin to murmur. The mother with her two 
children becomes engaged… no mobile in her hand.

Art is all about communication and finding an audience – a tough sell these 
days. The collection rotates and I want to say to people “These pieces are only 
here for a short time, and then gone for ever. Seize the moment. I can help.”
