Are you going to Scarborough Fair? Of course not, I have to go to Basingstoke 
this morning.
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme: What a horrible combination. 

Remember me to one who lives there: You know someone in Basingstoke? 

She once was a true love of mine: This is getting more interesting. 

Tell her to find me an acre of land: You'll be lucky in Basingstoke. Property 
prices are sky high.

Parsley, sage... I think we've got the hang of that bit now. 

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather: Frankly, I doubt that's legal. 
What is this all about? So far all we've heard is that bloody awful song.

That bloody awful song is a Simon and Garfunkel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/simonandgarfunkel> classic. And the great 
news is they're getting back together for a US tour, starting next month in 
Detroit.I'll book my flight now.

You can be as cynical as you like, but their folk anthems were a key part of 
my youth. It was a tragedy when they split. When was that? 

1970. They've appeared together occasionally since, but this will be their 
first tour since 1993. I suppose they need the money. 

Money is not the motive. As Simon says, "Because of the passage of time and 
the emotions that go with that, the performance is freighted with the potential 
for something extraordinary to occur."What will seats cost? 

Up to $250: That's a lot of freight. 

Interesting fact about Garfunkel: He spent much of his time between 1984 and 
1996 walking across the US for no obvious reason.

Interesting fact about Simon: There don't appear to be any. 

Not to be confused with: Dizzee Rascal. 

Do sing: "I am a rock." 

Don't sing: "I am a crock."
