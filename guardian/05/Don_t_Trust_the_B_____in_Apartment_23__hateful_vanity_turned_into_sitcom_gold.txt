What is it? To paraphrase Alan Partridge, it’s the show that Jessica Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jessica-jones> could have been.


Why you’ll love it: The popular narrative is that Krysten Ritter turned up on 
Breaking Bad, choked to death on her own vomit, and then remained dormant until 
Netflix gave her Jessica Jones to star in. But this is misleading, because 
between those two shows Ritter starred in one of the greatest, most 
inexplicably unloved comedies ever made: Don’t Trust the B–––– in Apartment 23.

This is a sitcom about June, a young woman who finally lands her dream job and 
moves to the big city only to discover that there is no job and her fiance is 
cheating on her. June is forced to move in with Chloe, the show’s eponymous 
B––––. Ritter plays Chloe, and it’s by far the best role she’s ever had.

Chloe is a monster. She’s Holly Golightly pushed to her logical endpoint. 
Vain, self-interested and conniving, she mercilessly exploits everyone around 
into enabling her dreadful lifestyle. She’s best friends with James Van Der 
Beek from Dawson’s Creek – playing himself with a crackpot intensity – and they 
spend their days in a vortex of empty self-infatuation. She pays her rent with 
whatever she can steal or blackmail. She’s the star of a Japanese comic called 
Tall Slut, No Panties. At one point she fosters a child to work as her 
assistant. She’s precisely as awful as every scheming antihero from the golden 
age of TV, and it’s brilliant.

It helps that we only see Chloe – for the bulk of the time – through the eyes 
of her new flatmate. June is hardworking and naive, at once shocked by Chloe’s 
exploits and determined to clean them up. It never works – in one episode, 
June’s plans to pay her rent by making and selling jam ends with her discovery 
that Chloe is secretly filming her and uploading the footage to a very specific 
fetish site – but it’s as robust a sitcom pairing as you’ll ever find.

As good as Jessica Jones is, watching Don’t Trust the Bitch in Apartment 23 
makes you wish Ritter had found another comedic role instead. On a show like 
this, where everything is heightened and plots hold themselves together on a 
string of broken logic, she’s unbeatable. Her torso pops from one ridiculous 
pose to another, like Johnny Bravo. Her eye-rolls are planet-sized. Her 
reactions are unbeatable. It feels like the role she was born for.

Then again, if Don’t Trust the B–––– in Apartment 23 hadn’t been cancelled, 
you could argue that the world would be a poorer place. Someone else would be 
playing Jessica Jones now. Creator Nahnatchka Khan wouldn’t have had the time 
to adapt Eddie Huang Fresh Off the Boat into a sitcom. Plus Eric Andre – wasted 
as the manager of a coffee shop here – would have never gone on to make The 
Eric Andre Show. And that series is sucha beautiful kaleidoscope of waking 
horrors <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4GL2_AVFHU> that I can’t imagine my 
life without it.

So perhaps Don’t Trust the B–––– in Apartment 23 is exactly where it should 
be. Finite, but on a platform where new comedy connoisseurs can discover it 
every day. They’ll love it as much as I do, promise.

Where: Netflix

Length: 26 22-minute episodes.

Stand-out episode: The second episode – about June finding love with an 
apparently suitable man – where the tone of the entire series falls into place 
with one offhandedly horrifying click after another.

If you liked Don’t Trust the B–––– in Apartment 23, watch: Community 
(Netflix), Workaholics (Amazon).
