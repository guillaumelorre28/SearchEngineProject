We all need a few good smoothie recipes in our breakfast repertoire. There are 
three on rotation in my house most of the time. A pleasing but subtle green 
one, a vibrant fruity one, and one that works as a smoothie bowl for days when 
drinking my breakfast doesn’t seem right.

I have also included a choose-your-own-adventure flavour map. The balance of a 
smoothie is a very individual thing – this guide should ensure your smoothies 
are both energising and delicious.

If you are a less experienced cook, smoothies are a good way of experimenting 
with balancing different flavours without putting too much at stake – a skill 
that can then be rolled out across the rest of your cooking. If you are a more 
experienced smoothie maker, then I hope this week’s recipes might provide a 
couple of new tweaks.

A good smoothie is all about getting the ratio right, I break my smoothie 
recipes into five parts. I usually stick to one main flavour, which makes the 
base of my smoothie (two parts); an accent (one part); and then a liquid or ice 
component (two parts). Finally, I like to add an extra kick of flavour, a 
mellowing creaminess or some balancing sweetness or acidity. Keep adding and 
balancing until you have a smoothie that tastes great and is the thickness you 
like to drink – or eat (such as in the recipe below).

Summer beetroot, raspberry and vanilla smoothie bowl

The consistency of this smoothie is just a little thicker: you’ll need a spoon 
to eat it. The bowl creates a wider surface area, which provides the perfect 
canvas for generous scatterings of texture and flavour.

Serves 2
3 prunes, soaked in 100ml hot water
1 small beetroot, peeled and chopped
125g raspberries
150g strawberries
Juice and zest of ½ a lemon
50g oats
1 tsp vanilla extract
120ml water or milk of your choice
A few ice cubes

Toppings 
Frozen raspberries
Pomegranate seeds
Raw almond butter/cashew butter
Hemp seeds
Almonds

1 Soak the prunes in water for as long as you have time for – even overnight 
if you remember.

2 Pour the soaked prunes and their liquid into a blender. Add all the 
remaining ingredients and blitz on high until completely smooth. Taste and 
adjust the sweetness, adding a little more vanilla or lemon as desired.

3 Pour the contents into a bowl and scatter over your toppings.

A friendly green smoothie

Despite their ubiquity, green smoothies are really worth considering if you’re 
looking for a quick, delicious and enlivening breakfast. When I’m in green 
smoothie mode, here’s what I think about: I want it to be filling, energising 
and nutritious. I like my smoothie to be packed with greens – so vibrant in 
colour and velvety in texture. Flavour is always the most important factor for 
me – I can’t drink something that tastes too worthy. Kale (like other greens) 
can have a bitter note; balancing the ratio of greens with a little sweetness 
is what makes a green smoothie.

Serves 2
150g ripe pineapple, peeled
1 banana, peeled
A large handful of kale, spinach or other greens (frozen works too)
½ an avocado
Juice of 1 lime
1 tbsp almond butter
A small thumb of fresh ginger, grated
250ml coconut water or water
A handful of ice

1 Roughly chop the pineapple and add it to a blender along with the rest of 
the ingredients.

2 Blend on a high speed until completely smooth. Taste and adjust the 
spiciness to your liking by adding more ginger, if necessary.

3 Pour into two glasses. Serve chilled.

Sunshine mango and turmeric

This is the smoothie I make when I need a lift in the morning. If goji berries 
are not something you usually buy, you can leave them out, but I urge you to 
try them – they taste like slightly sour and more piquant raisins.

Serves 2
1 ripe mango, stone removed
1 tsp goji berries (optional)
1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
½ tsp ground turmeric or 1 tsp fresh turmeric, grated
250ml orange juice or coconut water
A good grinding of black pepper
A handful of ice

1 Put all the smoothie ingredients into a blender, then blitz it all together 
on a high speed until it has become completely smooth. Taste and adjust the 
flavours to your liking, then add the ice and blitz again.

2 Pour the smoothie into two glasses. Serve chilled.
