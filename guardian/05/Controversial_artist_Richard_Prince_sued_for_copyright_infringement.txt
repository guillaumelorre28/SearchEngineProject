Richard Prince, a New York-based artist whose work often involves 
appropriating that of others, has been sued for copyright infringement by 
Donald Graham, a photographer who claims Prince knowingly reproduced his photo 
Rastafarian Smoking a Joint without seeking permission.

Artnet reports  
<https://news.artnet.com/market/donald-graham-sues-gagosian-richard-prince-401498>
that Graham filed acomplaint <https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/doc1/127117384285> 
on 30 December against Prince, the Gagosian Gallery – where Prince’s New 
Portraits exhibition ran between September and October 2014 – and Lawrence 
Gagosian, the gallery owner.


The New Portraits collection featured 37 inkjet prints on canvas of what 
Prince called “screen saves” of Instagram posts, according to the complaint. 
The only modification to the images by Prince, besides blowing them up in size, 
are in comments underneath the pictures comprised of emojis and bizarre 
sentences. The piecessold for up to $100,000 at New York’s Frieze art fair

Graham said in his complaint that Prince’s reproduction of Graham’s photograph 
– a black and white image of a Rastafarian man lighting a joint – was not 
modified adequately to warrant being called an original work. The piece was 
sold to Gagosian after the New Portraits exhibition closed.


This is not Prince’s first legal skirmish with an artist whose work he 
repurposed. In 2014, Prince settled a three-year-long copyright case with the 
photographer Patrick Cariou after he used Cariou’s Yes, Rasta, a book on the 
rastafarian community, as a part of his Canal Zone series.

Prince is known for appropriating established works by other artists. 
Regarding the legal implications of his work, Prince said in 2011, according to 
the complaint: “Copyright has never interested me. For most of my life I owned 
half a stereo, so there was no point in suing me, but that’s changed now and 
it’s interesting … So, sometimes it’s better not to be successful and 
well-known and you can get away with much more. I knew what I was stealing 30 
years ago but it didn’t matter because no one cared, no one was paying any 
attention.”

Graham’s complaint follows reports 
<http://hyperallergic.com/183036/photographer-sends-cease-and-desist-letters-to-richard-prince-and-gagosian/>
 from February 2015 that Graham sent a cease-and-desist letter to Prince and 
the Gagosian Gallery demanding the gallery remove and stop displaying 
reproductions of his work.


In October 2014, Graham posted a photo of the exhibit to his Instagram page, 
including the print of his Rastafarian Smoking Joint, with the caption: 
“Appropriated Exhibit. The only way you’d know my work was a part of this 
display is...well, that’s just it, you wouldn’t know.#PrinceofAppropriation

On another post of just the black and white image, Graham wrote in the 
caption: “How to credit a work: ‘Rastafarian Smoking a Joint’ © 1997 Donald 
Graham.#PrinceofAppropriation
