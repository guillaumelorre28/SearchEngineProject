European markets end sharply lower after rollercoaster ride

A surge in stock markets and a slump in the euro as the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> announced its new 
stimulus measures soon went into reverse after the central bank’s president 
Mario Draghi suggested that might be all there was.

With another slide in the oil price as hopes of a meeting of producers to 
tackle the glut began to fade again, it ended up being a volatile day for 
investors. So markets suffered turnarounds of several hundred points, and the 
euro saw a more than 3% jump from its lows to its highs against the dollar.

So the final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 1oo finished down 109.62 points or 1.78% at 6036.70 after earlier 
hitting 6203 
 * The FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1.77% to 1311.74 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 2.3% to 9498.15, after peaking at 9995 
 * France’s Cac closed 1.7% lower at 4350.35 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 0.5% at 18,118.23 
 * Spain’s Ibex bucked the trend and ended up 0.07% at 8766.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 555.7 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 150 points 
or 0.8%.

The euro is currently at $1.1214, having earlier fallen as low as $1.0820. It 
started the day at $1.0997.

Meanwhile Brent crude is down 2.5% at $40.01 a barrel, off its worst level of 
$39.63.

On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and 
we’ll be back again tomorrow.

Larry Elliott

The eurozone needs reforms and fiscal measures alongside the ECB’s stimulus 
package if its economy is to recover, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott:

For most of its short life, the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> fretted about 
inflation being too high. Now it has the opposite concern.

The fear of deflation explains the package of measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/how-european-central-bank-ecb-trying-revive-eurozone>
 announced by Mario Draghi on Thursday. Three months ago, the ECB president 
disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them 
to expect. This time there were no half measures.

The ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has 
been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of €60bn (£47bn) a month, but 
will now up the purchases to €80bn a month for at least a year, and probably 
longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be 
paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector 
in the form of loans to households and companies.

And still it wasn’t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial 
markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign 
exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need 
for any further cuts in interest rates...

Draghi knows that monetary policy – interest rates, quantitative easing and 
incentives to borrow – can only do so much. He would like his actions to be 
supported by structural reform and a more aggressive use of fiscal policy.

His full analysis is here:

ECB can only buy time, not solve eurozone growth woes

Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> shot down his 
own bazooka, suggests Philip Shaw at Investec:

The announcement of the package resulted in a significant fall in the euro (by 
a cent and a half to $1.0825) and a rally in stocks and bonds. However this was 
more than reversed when Mr Draghi hinted that rates may have hit the bottom. 
Indeed he explained that another reason for avoiding a tiered structure was so 
not to signal that rates could go as low as the ECB wanted. To us this is the 
worst of both worlds – taking the deposit rate further below zero but with 
verbal interventions unwinding positive market effects.

Overall we welcome the ECB’s willingness to act to bolster the recovery and to 
help to achieve its ‘below, but close to 2%’, inflation target. The package of 
measures is certainly substantial. However we remain wary of the ‘unintended 
consequences’ on the banks arising from negative rates.

Moreover at least we judge Mr Draghi’s comments on interest rate prospects has 
have been unhelpful, especially if today’s market reaction is not unwound.

Oil price falls on doubts Iran will join output freeze

As well as the volatility after the ECB announcement, markets have also been 
rattled by another slump in the oil price, as reports cast doubt on whether a 
meeting between producers later this month would go ahead.

Opec and other producers were expected to meet in Russia on March 20 amid a 
glut of supply and falling demand which has put severe pressure on the crude 
price. But with Iran reluctant to join a proposal to freeze output at January’s 
levels, Reuters is reporting that the gathering in Russia may not take place.

That has helped push oil lower once more, with Brent crude down 3% to $39.81 a 
barrel.

Despite the day’s surge in the euro after the ECB meeting, Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> still reckons it will fall 
back against the dollar, mainly because the US Federal Reserve is on the path 
of raising interest rates.The research group said:

The euro’s resilience in the face of greater-than-expected stimulus from the 
ECB does not alter our view that the currency is likely to fall towards parity 
against the dollar later this year. This is because that view has been, and 
continues to be, primarily driven by our forecast that the Fed will tighten 
policy much more aggressively than anticipated by the average investor.

Although the euro initially slid to around $1.085 in response the announcement 
of greater-than-expected stimulus from the ECB, the currency subsequently 
rebounded asMario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> 
suggested in his press conference that he did not envisage interest rates being 
cut even further. Indeed, at the time of writing, the euro was actually 
stronger against the dollar (about $1.115) than before the stimulus was 
communicated....

There is a stark contrast between our view of the prospects for monetary 
policy in the US and what is currently discounted in the markets. Our forecast 
is that rising inflation will prompt the Fed to raise its target for the 
federal funds rate to a range of 1.0-1.25% by year-end (from 0.25-0.5% now), 
whereas the implied rate of the December federal funds futures contract is 
currently only around 0.65%.

George Magnus: Helicopter money could be next

By ‘throwing the kitchen sink’ at the eurozone’s problems, the European 
Central Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> may 
have moved closer to the point where it has to actually start showering cash on 
the economy.

So argues George Magnus, an experienced City voice who used to be head 
economist at UBS.

He argues that the market reaction shows investors don’t believe today’s 
package of interest rate cuts, cheap loans and a beefier asset purchase scheme 
will work.

So what’s left? Free money, effectively.

Magnus writes 
<http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/blogs/george-magnus/is-the-european-central-banks-arsenal-now-bare>
:

So is the ECB’s arsenal now bare? If it sticks to the general approach to 
policy it has currently then yes. But, though this is inconceivable as thing 
stand, there are things the ECB could theoretically do. It could take us 
towards Milton Friedman’s “helicopter money.” This would involve the ECB taking 
a more direct role in creating money that might be distributed directly to 
households, companies and banks, for example by buying loans from banks, or 
public debt directly from governments, or financing cash distributions in the 
form of tax cuts or investment allowances.

These ideas will remain the subject of idle chatter for the time being. But 
eventually, who knows? If today’s kitchen sink episode ends with a whimper, as 
seems likely, and governments continue to stand aside from the economic fray, 
Europeans may demand still more of their central bank.

On the same theme Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:

Draghi did the hard work of convincing an apparently divided group of European 
central bankers that a bazooka was needed but committed the cardinal central 
banker sin of signalling a possible end to what is essentially an open-ended 
program.

The markets are blowing a loud raspberry towards the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> headquarters. 

Britain’s FTSE 100 has now shed 64 points, or more than 1%, to 6082 in late 
trading. European markets are also in the red, having surged over 2% when the 
ECB’s interest rate cuts were announced.

Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> is to blame, for telling 
reporters that further interest rate cuts are unlikely.

The ECB president managed to trip himself up in the press conference Q&A 
session.

Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, says today’s package 
of ECB measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/how-european-central-bank-ecb-trying-revive-eurozone>
 is a solid reaction to the recent economic downturn.

The markets may be volatile now, but the verdict of the real economy is what 
matters.

Kernohan says:


“Having been stung in December by disappointing market expectations, it was 
important that Mr. Draghi did not make the same mistake twice. Since then, we 
have seen a major spike in financial market volatility, a fall in Eurozone 
inflation, some weakness in the main Eurozone business surveys and cuts to 
global growth forecasts.

“Today’s announcement more than met expectations for policy easing, with a cut 
in the refi and deposit rates, a €20bn increase in monthly QE purchases, 
purchases of corporates bonds, and a new Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) 
arrangement. The addition of non-bank corporate bond purchases and the new 
LTROs, where borrowing can be as low as the deposit rate, were perhaps the main 
surprises.

“The initial reaction of markets was very clear, the Euro fell sharply and 
equities rallied. Draghi’s comment at the press conference that he thought 
further rate cuts were now unlikely, reversed this initial reaction. Looking 
through these very short term reactions however, the proof of the pudding will 
be a rise in Eurozone inflation expectations and a further pick up in lending 
growth.

“However, regardless of the short term reaction, we see the stimulus package 
as very important,” he added.

David Lamb, head of dealing at FEXCO Corporate Payments 
<https://fexco.com/corporate-payments/introduction/>, believes that the 
eurozone’s battle against deflation has just replaced Brexit as the biggest 
issue in Europe.

Here’s his take on today’s package of fresh measures: 

”The man who once shared a nickname with a pixellated plumber has thrown the 
kitchen sink at stimulating the Eurozone economy. Super Mario has morphed into 
Drastic Draghi.

The scale and duration of the ECB’s money printing programme alone would have 
been enough to prompt a big intake of breath from the markets.

But coupled with the slashing of the interest rate - which effectively means 
the ECB will be paying banks to lend to consumers - this is a breathtakingly 
bold burst of monetary policy.

The ECB is clearly deeply concerned at the threat of deflation, and is betting 
that this huge injection of cash into the ailing Eurozone economy will stop the 
rot.”The Euro’s response has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. Its initial 
plunge was reversed during Mr Draghi’s press conference, and his hints that 
further interest rate cuts are off the table.

It took a lot to trump the uncertainty caused by the UK’s Brexit saga - but 
the ECB’s desperate throw of the dice has made all other European issues look 
like a sideshow.”

A surge in stock markets and a slump in the euro as the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> announced its new 
stimulus measures soon went into reverse after the central bank’s president 
Mario Draghi suggested that might be all there was.

With another slide in the oil price as hopes of a meeting of producers to 
tackle the glut began to fade again, it ended up being a volatile day for 
investors. So markets suffered turnarounds of several hundred points, and the 
euro saw a more than 3% jump from its lows to its highs against the dollar.

So the final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 1oo finished down 109.62 points or 1.78% at 6036.70 after earlier 
hitting 6203 
 * The FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1.77% to 1311.74 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 2.3% to 9498.15, after peaking at 9995 
 * France’s Cac closed 1.7% lower at 4350.35 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 0.5% at 18,118.23 
 * Spain’s Ibex bucked the trend and ended up 0.07% at 8766.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 555.7 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 150 points 
or 0.8%.

The euro is currently at $1.1214, having earlier fallen as low as $1.0820. It 
started the day at $1.0997.

The eurozone needs reforms and fiscal measures alongside the ECB’s stimulus 
package if its economy is to recover, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott:

For most of its short life, the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> fretted about 
inflation being too high. Now it has the opposite concern.

The fear of deflation explains the package of measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/how-european-central-bank-ecb-trying-revive-eurozone>
 announced by Mario Draghi on Thursday. Three months ago, the ECB president 
disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them 
to expect. This time there were no half measures.

The ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has 
been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of €60bn (£47bn) a month, but 
will now up the purchases to €80bn a month for at least a year, and probably 
longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be 
paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector 
in the form of loans to households and companies.

And still it wasn’t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial 
markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign 
exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need 
for any further cuts in interest rates...

Draghi knows that monetary policy – interest rates, quantitative easing and 
incentives to borrow – can only do so much. He would like his actions to be 
supported by structural reform and a more aggressive use of fiscal policy.

His full analysis is here:

Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> shot down his 
own bazooka, suggests Philip Shaw at Investec:

The announcement of the package resulted in a significant fall in the euro (by 
a cent and a half to $1.0825) and a rally in stocks and bonds. However this was 
more than reversed when Mr Draghi hinted that rates may have hit the bottom. 
Indeed he explained that another reason for avoiding a tiered structure was so 
not to signal that rates could go as low as the ECB wanted. To us this is the 
worst of both worlds – taking the deposit rate further below zero but with 
verbal interventions unwinding positive market effects.

Overall we welcome the ECB’s willingness to act to bolster the recovery and to 
help to achieve its ‘below, but close to 2%’, inflation target. The package of 
measures is certainly substantial. However we remain wary of the ‘unintended 
consequences’ on the banks arising from negative rates.

Moreover at least we judge Mr Draghi’s comments on interest rate prospects has 
have been unhelpful, especially if today’s market reaction is not unwound.
 
As well as the volatility after the ECB announcement, markets have also been 
rattled by another slump in the oil price, as reports cast doubt on whether a 
meeting between producers later this month would go ahead.

Opec and other producers were expected to meet in Russia on March 20 amid a 
glut of supply and falling demand which has put severe pressure on the crude 
price. But with Iran reluctant to join a proposal to freeze output at January’s 
levels, Reuters is reporting that the gathering in Russia may not take place.

That has helped push oil lower once more, with Brent crude down 3% to $39.81 a 
barrel.
 
Despite the day’s surge in the euro after the ECB meeting, Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> still reckons it will fall 
back against the dollar, mainly because the US Federal Reserve is on the path 
of raising interest rates.The research group said:

The euro’s resilience in the face of greater-than-expected stimulus from the 
ECB does not alter our view that the currency is likely to fall towards parity 
against the dollar later this year. This is because that view has been, and 
continues to be, primarily driven by our forecast that the Fed will tighten 
policy much more aggressively than anticipated by the average investor.

Although the euro initially slid to around $1.085 in response the announcement 
of greater-than-expected stimulus from the ECB, the currency subsequently 
rebounded asMario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> 
suggested in his press conference that he did not envisage interest rates being 
cut even further. Indeed, at the time of writing, the euro was actually 
stronger against the dollar (about $1.115) than before the stimulus was 
communicated....

There is a stark contrast between our view of the prospects for monetary 
policy in the US and what is currently discounted in the markets. Our forecast 
is that rising inflation will prompt the Fed to raise its target for the 
federal funds rate to a range of 1.0-1.25% by year-end (from 0.25-0.5% now), 
whereas the implied rate of the December federal funds futures contract is 
currently only around 0.65%.
 
By ‘throwing the kitchen sink’ at the eurozone’s problems, the European 
Central Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> may 
have moved closer to the point where it has to actually start showering cash on 
the economy.

So argues George Magnus, an experienced City voice who used to be head 
economist at UBS.

He argues that the market reaction shows investors don’t believe today’s 
package of interest rate cuts, cheap loans and a beefier asset purchase scheme 
will work.

So what’s left? Free money, effectively.

Magnus writes 
<http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/blogs/george-magnus/is-the-european-central-banks-arsenal-now-bare>
:

So is the ECB’s arsenal now bare? If it sticks to the general approach to 
policy it has currently then yes. But, though this is inconceivable as thing 
stand, there are things the ECB could theoretically do. It could take us 
towards Milton Friedman’s “helicopter money.” This would involve the ECB taking 
a more direct role in creating money that might be distributed directly to 
households, companies and banks, for example by buying loans from banks, or 
public debt directly from governments, or financing cash distributions in the 
form of tax cuts or investment allowances.

These ideas will remain the subject of idle chatter for the time being. But 
eventually, who knows? If today’s kitchen sink episode ends with a whimper, as 
seems likely, and governments continue to stand aside from the economic fray, 
Europeans may demand still more of their central bank.

On the same theme Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:

Draghi did the hard work of convincing an apparently divided group of European 
central bankers that a bazooka was needed but committed the cardinal central 
banker sin of signalling a possible end to what is essentially an open-ended 
program.

The markets are blowing a loud raspberry towards the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> headquarters. 

Britain’s FTSE 100 has now shed 64 points, or more than 1%, to 6082 in late 
trading. European markets are also in the red, having surged over 2% when the 
ECB’s interest rate cuts were announced.

Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> is to blame, for telling 
reporters that further interest rate cuts are unlikely.

The ECB president managed to trip himself up in the press conference Q&A 
session.
 
Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, says today’s package 
of ECB measures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/how-european-central-bank-ecb-trying-revive-eurozone>
 is a solid reaction to the recent economic downturn.

The markets may be volatile now, but the verdict of the real economy is what 
matters.

Kernohan says:


“Having been stung in December by disappointing market expectations, it was 
important that Mr. Draghi did not make the same mistake twice. Since then, we 
have seen a major spike in financial market volatility, a fall in Eurozone 
inflation, some weakness in the main Eurozone business surveys and cuts to 
global growth forecasts.

“Today’s announcement more than met expectations for policy easing, with a cut 
in the refi and deposit rates, a €20bn increase in monthly QE purchases, 
purchases of corporates bonds, and a new Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) 
arrangement. The addition of non-bank corporate bond purchases and the new 
LTROs, where borrowing can be as low as the deposit rate, were perhaps the main 
surprises.

“The initial reaction of markets was very clear, the Euro fell sharply and 
equities rallied. Draghi’s comment at the press conference that he thought 
further rate cuts were now unlikely, reversed this initial reaction. Looking 
through these very short term reactions however, the proof of the pudding will 
be a rise in Eurozone inflation expectations and a further pick up in lending 
growth.
 
Here’s some market reaction from Reuters:

Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital, said Draghi’s remarks that 
more rate cuts were unlikely

“However, regardless of the short term reaction, we see the stimulus package 
as very important,” he added.

EUR ping-ponging around isn't all that relevant, given that the latest 
measures are aimed at the credit, rather than the FX channel.

David Lamb, head of dealing at FEXCO Corporate Payments 
<https://fexco.com/corporate-payments/introduction/>, believes that the 
eurozone’s battle against deflation has just replaced Brexit as the biggest 
issue in Europe.

Here’s his take on today’s package of fresh measures: 

”The man who once shared a nickname with a pixellated plumber has thrown the 
kitchen sink at stimulating the Eurozone economy. Super Mario has morphed into 
Drastic Draghi.

The scale and duration of the ECB’s money printing programme alone would have 
been enough to prompt a big intake of breath from the markets.

But coupled with the slashing of the interest rate - which effectively means 
the ECB will be paying banks to lend to consumers - this is a breathtakingly 
bold burst of monetary policy.

The ECB is clearly deeply concerned at the threat of deflation, and is betting 
that this huge injection of cash into the ailing Eurozone economy will stop the 
rot.”The Euro’s response has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. Its initial 
plunge was reversed during Mr Draghi’s press conference, and his hints that 
further interest rate cuts are off the table.

It took a lot to trump the uncertainty caused by the UK’s Brexit saga - but 
the ECB’s desperate throw of the dice has made all other European issues look 
like a sideshow.”

2016 so far: markets don't like negative rates. Nor do they like the idea that 
rates will not get more negative.
