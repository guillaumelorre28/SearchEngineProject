of all video games. “Metal noise, blood and fire, tell me what you most 
desire,” says a familiar-looking long-haired guardian to the lucky players who 
reach his holy underground temple to stock up on weaponry.

Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe

 Beyond Two Souls (2013)

Dafoe previously appeared as a Bond baddie in Everything or Nothing alongside 
Judi Dench, Pierce Brosnan and John Cleese. Here, Dafoe and Page (left) were 
wired up with state of the art performance capture technology to be sure every 
nuance of their acting was reproduced in this psychological thriller of a game.

Fred Durst 

Fight Club (2004)

The spinoff game of the cult classic feature film Fight Club has American 
Nu-metal band Limp Bizkit’s frontman as an unlockable character which can be 
played once you’ve beaten the game’s story mode. The film, and the Chuck 
Palahniuk novel it was based on, may have seen great success, but critics were 
not quite as keen on this game adaptation.

Jonathan Ross 

Fable 3 (2010)

His son was a huge fan of the first Fable game, so naturally, when asked if he 
would do a character in a follow-up, Ross jumped at it. An animated and 
somewhat evil-looking version of Ross appears as the character Barry Hatch, 
which he also voices.Fable’s fantasy world is famous for its star-studded 
voiceover selection which include celebrities such as Zoë Wanamaker, Stephen 
Fry and John Cleese.

Snoop Dogg 

True Crime: Streets of LA (2003)

Gamers who are more comfortable on the sofa than with living life on the edge 
can savour the feeling of being a real gangsta for a day in this virtual crime 
drama. RapperSnoop Dogg <https://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg> appears 
as himself in the game which is set on the sunny but crime-ridden streets of 
LA, and players can unlock and take on his character by collecting ‘Dogg Bones’ 
or following a sneaky code.

Chuck Norris 

Chuck Norris, Superkicks (1983)

Who could be better suited to the virtual kung-fu scene than a martial arts 
star and action hero such as Norris, who was one of the first celebrities to 
star in a video game. But of course, the lo-res technology of the early 80s 
might not live up to today’s expectations, so if you’re looking for aChuck 
Norris <https://www.theguardian.com/film/chuck-norris> nostalgia trip we 
recommend a night ofWalker, Texas Ranger viewing instead.
