Crisis in Six Scenes (new episodes every Friday)
Woody Allen stars as Sidney J Munsinger, a predictably neurotic, egomaniacal 
writer in 1960s New York, who refuses to watch the news or go on anti-war 
marches, and whose cushty life goes to pot when a revolutionary on the run 
(played by Miley Cyrus) breaks into his house on the only night in 26 years 
that he forgot to set the burglar alarm.

Allen referred to his first ever TV show as a catastrophic mistake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/woody-allen-agreeing-to-make-amazon-tv-series-was-a-catastrophic-mistake>
 more than a year ago. Now, it’s finally time to see if he was right. Judging 
by early reviews, it may have been an accurate assessment. Crisis has been 
damned as clumsy, lazy, and Allen himself accused ofexcruciating acting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/28/crisis-in-six-scenes-woody-allen-miley-cyrus>
, “like a theatrical grandparent telling jokes over Christmas dinner, or an 
octogenarian director being asked whether he’s past his prime.” Spend six weeks 
with Woody and Miley – if you can stomach it.

Ripper Street (available from 12 October)
The final series of the enjoyable bowler-hatted murder-em-up gets underway, 
and here, six episodes doesn’t seem long enough to tie up all the loose ends. 
Brutal, charming, and wearing its daftness like an incriminating splodge of 
blood on its sleeve, viewers yet to take to the pea-souped cobbles of Victorian 
London can now binge all past episodes, while committed Ripperites can soon see 
how it comes to a close.

Halt and Catch Fire (new episodes every Tuesday)
The excellent 80s computer drama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/22/halt-and-catch-fire-amc-set-visit-kerry-bishe>
 created by AMC continues – and the move to the nascent Silicon Valley has not 
gone smoothly. There’s a mutiny at the tech startup Mutiny, and co-founders 
Donna and Cameron are at loggerheads (when they’re not building ham radios, or 
trying to complete the latest computer sensation – Super Mario Bros on the 
NES.) This is cracking stuff, and still sadly underwatched.
