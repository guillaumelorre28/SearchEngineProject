In summer, there are few more refreshing dishes than a chilled soup – so long 
as it’s hot and sunny, that is. The velvety potatoes and sweet leeks in a 
vichyssoise, for instance, combine to make a pretty sensual eating experience, 
though here I’ve reverted to Delia’s old take on the classic that I used to 
make ages ago, in which lemongrass adds an exotic touch; my version also 
features cucumber and lime, for freshness. The green bean salad, meanwhile, is 
inspired by regular trips to east London’s Turkish restaurants, and is 
currently one of my favourite things to eat.

Lemongrass, cucumber and coriander vichyssoise

A wonderfully subtle soup that’s as at home as a smart first course as it is 
as light summer lunch. Serves four.

850ml chicken or vegetable stock
1 large bunch fresh coriander, picked
2 sticks lemongrass, outer layers peeled and reserved, inner core finely 
chopped
30g unsalted butter
1 leek, green part finely sliced, white part finely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
2 potatoes (about 300g), peeled and chopped
1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced
150ml milk
½ cucumber, finely chopped, plus a handful or two extra to serve
The juice of ½ lime 
Ice cubes, to serve

Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan with the coriander stalks and 
outer layers of lemongrass, then take off the heat and leave to infuse.

Melt half the butter in a small frying pan, fry the green leek slices until 
softened and just turning golden, then set aside. They’ll be used as a fine 
garnish for the soup.

Heat the remaining butter and the oil in a large saucepan, stir in the chopped 
lemongrass, white parts of the leeks and the potatoes, then leave to sweat 
gently on a low heat for 10 minutes. Add the garlic, fry for a minute, then add 
the infused stock, milk and three-quarters of the coriander leaves. Season, 
bring up to simmering point, then simmer very gently for 20 minutes. Leave the 
soup to cool a little, then stir in the cucumber and lime juice.

Tip the soup into a food processor or blender, whizz as smooth as can be, then 
strain into a bowl and leave to cool. Once the soup is cold, cover the bowl 
with clingfilm and chill until you are ready to eat.

Ladle the soup into four bowls (it’s a good idea to chill them first; I like 
to use glass ones), then add a cube or two of ice to each portion. Finely chop 
the rest of the coriander leaves and scatter on top with the reserved fried 
leeks and cucumber, and serve at once.

This is a light but surprisingly filling salad, that works just as it is, or 
with rice or a chop; it’s also a very good picnic dish. The charred flavour of 
the beans is fantastic with the intensely sweet-savoury tomato sauce and mellow 
yoghurt dressing. Serves four.

40g butter
1 splash olive oil
2 onions, peeled and finely sliced
3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
1 tsp ground allspice
2 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp Turkish chilli flakes (or a pinch of regular chilli flakes), plus extra 
to serve
Salt and black pepper
3 400g tins plum tomatoes, drained and rinsed of their juices
1 cinnamon stick
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp pomegranate molasses
600g flat beans such as helda (destringed if necessary), cut in half across 
the middle
½ tbsp olive oil

For the almonds
30g butter
75g flaked almonds
1 tbsp caster sugar

To serve
250g Greek yoghurt
½ garlic clove, peeled and crushed with a pinch of salt
1 handful each mint and flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped
To make the sauce, melt the butter and a splash of oil in a saucepan over a 
medium heat, then gently fry the onions and garlic until soft, about 10 
minutes. Stir in the ground spices, season with salt and cook for a minute or 
so, then add the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Add the 
cinnamon, bay, molasses and a splash of water, and simmer for about 20 minutes 
while you prepare the other elements of the dish.

For the almonds, melt the butter in a small frying pan on a medium-low heat 
until sizzling, then stir in the nuts and fry gently, stirring constantly, 
until they turn light golden. Stir in the sugar, take off the heat and season 
with a pinch of salt (add enough to achieve a good sweet and salty balance) and 
leave to cool.

Stir the garlic into the yoghurt and loosen with a few splashes of water until 
it’s the consistency of double cream.

Bring a pan of salted water to a boil, blanch the beans for about three 
minutes, then drain and leave to dry on a piece of kitchen paper. Heat a 
griddle pan or barbecue and grill the beans briefly on each side, only until 
char marks appear, then put in a bowl. Toss the beans in half a tablespoon of 
oil and season lightly.

Transfer the beans to plates, then spoon over the sauce, followed by the 
yoghurt and a good sprinkling of almonds. Scatter over the chopped herbs and 
another little sprinkle of chilli flakes and serve warm or at room temperature.

And for the rest of the week…

The soup makes a great packed lunch, so make lots to take into work. Finely 
chop any leftover lemongrass, then bag, label and freeze – that way, you’ll 
have some handy when you next make a stir-fry or quick, Thai-style curry. The 
tomato sauce and garlic yoghurt for the beans also work with a fried egg or 
couscous for a fast supper. And excess cooked almonds make a lovely topping for 
fruit yoghurt or puree.
