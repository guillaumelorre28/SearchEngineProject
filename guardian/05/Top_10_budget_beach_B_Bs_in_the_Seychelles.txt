Colibri Guesthouse, Praslin


For a room with a five-star view, Colibri is hard to beat. Nine rustic rooms – 
all wood and stone – ensconced amid tropical foliage that tumbles down a 
hillside to the turquoise waters of Baie Sainte Anne. There’s no beach but you 
can use the small infinity pool overlooking the bay at neighbouring B&B Chalets 
Cote Mer, also owned by Sylvie and Stephan, and costing about €10 more a night. 
You also share the waterfront creole restaurant. The owners can help with car 
hire but it’s a five-minute walk to a bus stop – which will take you to 
Praslin’s most famous beach Anse Lazio and the Unesco-protectedVallée de Mai 
nature reserve <http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/261> – and the jetty for ferries 
to Mahé and La Digue.

Who needs a pool when the glorious golden sweep of Beau Vallon beach is on the 
doorstep? Set on the north-west coast of the archipelego’s largest island, this 
guesthouse has nine air-conditioned rooms; first-floor rooms come with a 
balcony and sea views, ground-floor rooms are darker but have a terrace for 
sunset watching. Breakfast is served under a gazebo in the garden, there’s a 
shared kitchen and it’s close to several restaurants, including the atmospheric
Boathouse <http://www.christophvollmer.de/boathouse/home.html> with its 
all-you-can-eat creole buffet, and the weekly market, where locals set up 
stalls under the takamaka trees. Eddy, the hands-on owner, will give you tips 
on where to go and what to see, including the best snorkelling spots.

 Carana Hilltop Villa Photograph: Jorgen Andersson 
Eileen and Mike’s hilltop retreat looks out over the ocean all the way to 
Silhouette Island, and most of the 10 air-conditioned, en suite rooms have a 
private balcony. Take the trail up into the jungle-cloaked mountains or a 
10-minute walk downhill to the stunning and usually deserted Carana beach. 
There’s a swimming pool to cool off in and a lovely garden where you can pick 
bananas, mangos and guavas off the trees – they also appear in the homemade 
jams at breakfast. It holds a weekly barbecue and there’s a shared kitchen; 
there’s even somewhere to clean your catch if you go fishing.

The ebullient Marie-Annette will greet you with cupcakes and mango juice at 
this friendly home from home. The two spacious rooms – one accommodates four 
adults – are set above her Baie Sainte Anne gift shop with balconies that look 
out over the bijou Anse d’Amour, so you’ll wake to the lap of waves. It’s close 
to a well-stocked grocery shop so you can make use of the kitchen; there’s free 
drinking water and, unusually for guesthouses, free Wi-Fi. Marie-Annette’s 
husband runs boat trips and her daughter is a masseuse for the island’s top 
resorts. And don’t refuse an invitation to dinner for delicious creole cuisine 
and an insight into island life.

Rosemary and her son Herbert have turned an old property on the north-east 
coast of the island into a laid-back B&B. The nine rooms are spread over three 
buildings: the garden rooms are fan-only but the newer sea-view rooms have air 
conditioning. Breakfast is served alfresco and there are plenty of restaurants 
nearby, but if you’re on a tight budget, pick up a just-caught fish for the 
barbecue. Step through the back gate and you are right on Cote D’Or beach, 
where you can negotiate boat trips to Curieuse Island, home to aMarine national 
park <http://www.snpa.sc/marine-parks/curieuse>, with nature trails and a 
colony of giant tortoises.

Diminutive La Digue is the smallest of the three main inhabited islands and is 
home to some of the world’s most beautiful beaches, where the laid-back 
inhabitants get around the sandy streets by bicycle. This good-value guesthouse 
has four no-frills but comfortable rooms: two come with air conditioning and a 
fan, two are fan-only. One room has a kitchen but it’s still worth splashing 
out £12 for a delicious creole dinner from the friendly owner, Mary-Anne. It’s 
a short bike ride to the coast or just submit to a tropical torpor and flop 
into a hammock in the garden.

This charming house has a beautiful plant-filled garden and is tucked down a 
quiet sandy street that leads from a jetty. There are two simple rooms, a 
shared kitchen and a living room with a TV and DVD player. As well as dishing 
up a hearty breakfast – including vanilla pancakes and coconut cakes – the 
amiable Doris and Charles are on hand to help you rent bikes and organise 
snorkelling trips and guided island hikes. They’ll make dinner on request; 
perhaps a whole grilled fish with herbs plucked from the garden or a fish curry 
– and you can dine alfresco under a starry sky.

after her late mother and Alice after her daughter; you can buy Alice’s 
colourful handicrafts in the small gift shop. Four of the six en suite rooms 
have kitchens and all have balconies overlooking the garden, where a 
thatched-roof gazebo is the perfect place for a local beer. Easy to reach, it 
sits between L’Union reserve and Anse Source d’Argent – one of the world’s most 
photographed beaches – and the jetty. For cheap eats the nearby Gala Takeaway 
is the best on the island.

Up a steep hill, a 10-minute bike ride from the jetty, this cosy creole-style 
house is in a tranquil spot, surrounded by towering palms and vivid hibiscus, 
with a backdrop of green-clad granite peaks. On the first floor of the main 
building there’s a lounge and terrace, perfect for stargazing, and three, 
air-conditioned rooms – each with their own private entrance and large enough 
for families. There’s also a two-bedroom, two-bathroom annexe in the garden. 
The friendly owners, Monica and Wilfrid, will organise snorkelling trips to the 
nearby islands of Felicité and Coco, and ask Wilfrid if he’ll take you to Anse 
Marron, a spectacular, hard-to-reach beach on the south of the island.
