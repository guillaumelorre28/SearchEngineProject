David Hasselhoff <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-hasselhoff> 
has proclaimed the Sharknado film series “the worst ... ever” after completing 
work on Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!, the third in the series of made-for-TV 
disaster movies.

Hasselhoff was speaking to HuffPost Live 
<http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/archive/segment/5510430778c90a5303000df5> to 
“preview” the film, and taking questions from fans, when he made the 
tongue-in-cheek comment. When asked for a description of his involvement in 
“the greatest made-for-TV movie franchise of all time”, Hasselhoff reacted by 
laughing and saying: “It’s the worst movie you have ever seen.”

Hasselhoff clarified his reaction by saying: “The first one was the worst. The 
second one was even worse. I’m so honoured to be in Sharknado 3.”

The actor explained that he was originally offered a cameo role in Sharknado 
2: The Second One which, to his surprise, turned out to be a “nice chunky 
part”, before being asked to return for Oh Hell No!, alongside the likes of 
Tara Reid, Bo Derek andformer presidential candidate Michele Bachmann

Los Angeles by a freak cyclone, premiered on SyFy in 2013 and became a cult 
hit, gaining some traction later as a theatrical release. Sharknado 2: The 
Second One recordedthe highest ever figure for a film premiere on SyFy with
