Eight of the world’s top industrialised nations lowered their corporation tax 
rates last year or announced plans to do so, according to a leading thinktank.

In the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s annual report 
on tax changes around the world 
<http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/tax-policy-reform-in-the-oecd-2016_9789264260399-en>
, published on Thursday, the thinktank said Japan, Spain, Israel, Norway and 
Estonia had all lowered their tax rates for corporate profits in 2015. 
Meanwhile, future reductions had been announced by Italy, France and the UK, 
while Japan planned further cuts.

The OECD <https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd> said the 2015 downward 
trend was accelerating as governments around the world emerged from the 
aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis and began using their tax policies more 
aggressively to chase GDP growth.

In particular, countries were vying with one another to offer foreign 
multinationals the most attractive tax rate in an effort to attract investment. 
“With regard to corporate income tax, rate reductions had generally slowed down 
after the crisis but seem to be picking up again,” the report said. “The trend 
seems to be gaining renewed momentum.”

The OECD findings may make uncomfortable reading for many politicians who have 
recently claimed to be leading the battle to make big global corporations pay 
more tax. A string of revelations about ultra-low tax bills among many of the 
world’s largest businesses – including Apple, Vodafone, Starbucks and Google – 
has led to widespread public anger. The OECD suggested cuts in corporation tax 
were being partially offset by rises in other taxes such as VAT, fuel and car 
tax.

Many tax justice and inequality campaigners have pointed out this trend hits 
poorer individuals hardest. TheTax Justice Network notes 
<http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/TJN_NEF_130418_Tax_competition.pdf> 
that it “redistributes wealth upwards”.

“Governments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher 
taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on 
essential public services, so tax ‘competition’ boosts inequality and 
deprivation,” the Tax Justice Network has said.

OECD experts said lower corporation tax rates may indeed boost GDP but were 
also likely to heap pressure on other nations to follow suit and lower the rate 
of tax they levied on corporate profits. Critics of tax competition have called 
this a “race to the bottom”.

The OECD said the average tax rate for corporate profits had declined from 32% 
in 2000 to 26% in 2008. The rate of decline then slowed – the average reaching 
25% last year – but now looks to be quickening once again, the OECD said.

Meanwhile, the average rate of VAT – a tax that falls hardest on the poor – 
has climbed from 17.6% in 2008 to a record high of 19.2% at the start of 2015.

The UK was not among those OECD countries to have reduced corporation tax 
rates last year, but the then chancellor, George Osborne, did announce that the 
rate would steadily fall to 17% by 2020. It had been 28% when Osborne took 
office in 2010. He has repeatedly boasted of giving the UK the most competitive 
corporation tax rate of any G20 nation.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, OECD tax experts insisted world 
leaders were increasingly aware of concerns that aggressive tax competition was 
leading to wider income and wealth inequality.

“In the past, a very big focus of tax policy has been on achieving revenue 
collection … supporting [GDP] growth,” said David Bradbury, the thinktank’s 
head of tax policy and statistics.


“People have often left the question of income inequality – redistribution – 
to other levers of policy, particularly government spending. But tax policy has 
a critical role to play also in addressing those important questions of 
inequality.”

Earlier this month, leaders attending the G20 summit in Hangzhou asked the 
OECD and the International Monetary Fund to explore ways of using tax reforms 
to better foster GDP growth while at the same time curbing income and wealth 
inequalities.

While progressive taxes rates for personal and corporate income are in decline 
in many countries, OECD experts said there were other options for governments 
to explore. These include wealth taxes and measures to closing tax breaks on 
mortgage expenditure and pension contributions – incentives that largely 
benefit better-off individuals.


More broadly, the OECD said that industrialised nations wishing to increase 
tax revenue could do much more to tax property and carbon-heavy fuels such as 
coal. “The potential to raise revenues in an efficient way through property 
taxes, especially through recurrent taxes on residential property, is not being 
fully exploited,” the report concluded, although it found the highest property 
taxes were in the UK.

Meanwhile, OECD figures showed that countries were failing to align those 
taxes that have an impact on the environment with international ambitions to 
move to a low-carbon economy. In particular,road transport was heavily taxed 
despite the fact that other sectors make up 85% of CO2 emissions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/20/switch-to-low-carbon-transport-could-save-uk-billions>
.

“The potential for harnessing the power of taxes as environmental policy 
instruments is large,” the report said, noting that there were currently 
“particularly low taxes on some of the most environmentally harmful fuels, 
notably coal”.
