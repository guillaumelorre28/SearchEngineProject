This salad is named after the buggies in Thailand that bomb around town, as 
the flavours really motor around your mouth. Brown basmati and wild rice with 
loads of seasonal greens and a dressing that goes like a rocket – fresh ginger, 
chilli, lime, sesame, coriander and soy.

Serves 4

150g brown basmati rice
100g wild rice
125g peas, defrosted
100g broad beans, defrosted
2 spring onions, finely sliced
2 plum tomatoes, roughly chopped
1 handful (55g) rocket, roughly chopped
2 tbsp coriander, chopped
2 tbsp toasted seeds (such as sunflower, pumpkin, linseed and sesame)
1 lime
Salt

For the dressing
½ a red chilli, chopped finely, with or without seeds depending on how hot you 
like it
3cm ginger, peeled and grated
½ a large or 1 small garlic clove, chopped finely
50ml lime juice
35ml (3 tbsp) sesame oil
35ml (3 tbsp) soy sauce

1. Put both kinds of rice on the hob in separate pans, and cook them for the 
time indicated on the packets.

2. Meanwhile, make your dressing by whisking all the ingredients together, 
then leave to infuse.

3. Prepare the rest of the veg.

4. When each batch of the rice is ready, pour into a sieve and run under cool 
water, then drain and mix them both together.

5. Stir the peas, broad beans, spring onions and some salt into the rice, then 
mix in the dressing until everything is well coated.

6. In a bowl, mix the chopped tomato, rocket, coriander and seeds and spread 
on top of the rice. Decant into suitable lunch containers with a piece of lime.
