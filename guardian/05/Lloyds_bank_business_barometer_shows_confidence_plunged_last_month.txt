Confidence in the UK's economic prospects among businesses fell sharply last 
month, wiping out all the improvements seen since the turn of the year.

The Lloyds Bank business barometer, published today showed a drop of 47 points 
last month, from +26% to -21%. "It seems that the re-emergence of concerns 
within the Eurozone, first seen in April's data, have had a major impact on the 
confidence of companies in May," said Lloyds.

The barometer, which monitors sentiment among more than 300 companies, each 
with a turnover of more than £1m, shows businesses are still fairly upbeat 
about their own prospects, although confidence levels are slipping back.

The Lloyds data shows broad based declines in an index which measures economic 
prospects, trading prospects, employment prospects and profit margins across 
all sectors and regions, with the most notable declines in the North and 
Midlands and in the retail and distribution sectors.

Nevertheless, overall sentiment remains better than at the time of the 2008/09 
financial crisis and ahead of pre-Christmas 2011 levels.

Lloyd's economists expect an "underlying" 0.2% growth in GDP for the second 
quarter of 2012, once the effect of the Diamond jubilee – which may result in a 
reduced quarterly growth of about 0.5 percentage points – is taken into account.
