Pensioners don’t run. But I can still shuffle in my dated running gear. 
Through the woods, across the fields, far from mocking gazes. My single 
marathon victory just a memory; 30 years ago and counting. Now it’s painfully 
slow, soles and soul often scraping the ground. I feel your jibes: “Isn’t he 
too old for that?”; “Call that running? I could almost walk that fast.” But 
there’s still satisfaction as well as nostalgic pleasure in accomplishment.

I see young runners and my mind churns. All shapes and sizes. Some true 
athletes. Many others with wires dangling from their ears. Water bottles 
clutched pointlessly. Watches referred to at regular and self-conscious 
intervals. And those pouches on the upper arms: are they for mobile phones, 
heart rate monitors or portable defibrillators? Is my cynicism the product of 
athletic purity or athletic snobbery?

I note your status – some proper runners with characteristic glide; joggers, 
intense and breathless; posers, and those team sport competitors whose rolling 
gait and chunky thighs convey their keep-fit motivation. Lycra everywhere, its 
owners shrink-wrappped, revealing their limitations. Whatever happened to vest 
and shorts, proper shorts? And trainers embalmed in mud? Amid these characters, 
I notice the overweight joggers, and my spirit rises to their challenge; that 
effort takes courage.

But then I see a young runner, wearing a shapeless and unbranded grey T shirt, 
flapping shorts, uncompromisingly worn-down trainers, head up, eyes focused, 
knee lift high, and aroused at such simple memories, I smile.
