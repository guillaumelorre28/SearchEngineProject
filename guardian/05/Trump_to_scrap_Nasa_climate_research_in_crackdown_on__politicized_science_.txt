Donald Trump is poised to eliminate all climate change research conducted by 
Nasa <https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa> as part of a crackdown on 
“politicized science”, his senior adviser on issues relating to the space 
agency has said.

Nasa’s Earth science division <https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science> is set 
to be stripped of funding in favor of exploration of deep space, with the 
president-elect having set a goal during the campaign to explore the entire 
solar system by the end of the century.

This would mean the elimination of Nasa’s world-renowned research into 
temperature, ice, clouds and other climate phenomena. Nasa’s network of 
satellites provide a wealth of information on climate change, with the Earth 
science division’sbudget set to grow to $2bn 
<https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/fy_2017_budget_estimates.pdf>
 next year. By comparison, space exploration has been scaled back somewhat, 
with a proposed budget of $2.8bn in 2017.

Bob Walker, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said there was no need for Nasa 
to do what he has previously described as “politically correct environmental 
monitoring”.

“We see Nasa in an exploration role, in deep space research,” Walker told the 
Guardian. “Earth-centric science is better placed at other agencies where it is 
their prime mission.

“My guess is that it would be difficult to stop all ongoing Nasa programs but 
future programs should definitely be placed with other agencies. I believe that 
climate research is necessary but it has been heavily politicized, which has 
undermined a lot of the work that researchers have been doing. Mr Trump’s 
decisions will be based upon solid science, not politicized science.”

Trump has previously said that climate change is a “hoax

perpetrated by the Chinese, althoughon Tuesday he said

 there is “some connectivity” between human actions and the climate. There is

that burning fossil fuels and deforestation causes the release of heat-trapping

‘No one’s an exception’: toll of climate change, from US to the Marshall 
Islands – video

Walker, however, claimed that doubt over the role of human activity in climate 
change “is a view shared by half the climatologists in the world. We need good 
science to tell us what the reality is and science could do that if politicians 
didn’t interfere with it.”

It could put us back into the ‘dark ages’ ... Space research is a luxury, 
Earth observations are essential
Kevin Trenberth, National Center for Atmospheric Research 
It’s understood that federal government scientists have been unnerved by 
Trump’s dismissal of climate science and are concerned that their work will be 
sidelined as part of a new pro-fossil fuels and deregulation agenda. Climate 
scientists at other organizations expressed dismay at the potential gutting of 
Earth-based research.

Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research, said as Nasa provides the scientific community with new instruments 
and techniques, the elimination of Earth sciences would be “a major setback if 
not devastating”.

“It could put us back into the ‘dark ages’ of almost the pre-satellite era,” 
he said. “It would be extremely short sighted.

“We live on planet Earth and there is much to discover, and it is essential to 
track and monitor many things from space. Information on planet Earth and its 
atmosphere and oceans is essential for our way of life.Space 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/space> research is a luxury, Earth 
observations are essential.”

Paris climate deal: Trump says he now has an 'open mind' about accord

Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, said Nasa has a 
“critical and unique role” in observing Earth and climate change.

“Without the support of Nasa, not only the US but the entire world would be 
taking a hard hit when it comes to understanding the behavior of our climate 
and the threats posed by human-caused climate change,” he said.

“It would be a blatantly political move, and would indicate the 
president-elect’s willingness to pander to the very same lobbyists and 
corporate interest groups he derided throughout the campaign.”

Nasa has appointed two officials, Tom Cremins and Jolene Meidinger, to lead 
the transition to the newTrump administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration>. However, the 
president-elect’s team has yet to formally review the space agency.

“The Nasa community is committed to doing whatever we can to assist in making 
the executive branch transition a smooth one,” a Nasa spokesman said. “The 
agency remains focused on the future, a future that will improve our 
understanding of our changing home planet from Nasa’s unique platforms in 
space.”
