Fig and thyme clafoutis

Make sure you use really ripe figs for this. You may be surprised by the size 
of each portion, but the sponge is so light and fluffy that it’s very easy to 
eat a lot of it. I like to serve this with vanilla ice-cream or cream. Serves 
four, generously.

110g caster sugar
2 tbsp red wine 
1 tbsp picked thyme leaves
1 tbsp lemon juice, plus 2 tsp finely grated zest
12 ripe black figs, tough stems removed and halved lengthways
2 eggs, separated
50g plain flour
1½ tsp vanilla essence
100ml double cream
Salt

Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Spoon 60g sugar into a small, 
oven-proof, high-sided saute pan with an 18cm base (if you don’t have one, cook 
the figs in a regular frying pan and transfer to a square 22cm baking dish when 
its’s time to move them to the oven), then put the pan on a medium-high heat 
for four to five minutes, swirling the pan a few times, until the sugar has 
melted and turned a dark, caramel colour. Add the wine and thyme – be careful, 
because it might spit – and stir until combined and thick. Off the heat, stir 
in the lemon juice and figs, and set aside to cool. (If you are transferring 
the figs to a baking dish, do so now.)

Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl with 25g sugar. Whisk until pale and thick 
– two to three minutes by hand, one minute with an electric whisk – then add 
the flour, vanilla, cream, lemon zest and a pinch of salt, and whisk until 
smooth and thick.

In another medium bowl, whisk the egg whites with the remaining 25g sugar 
(again, two to three minutes by hand, a minute with an electric whisk), until 
they form stiff peaks. Fold gently into the yolk batter, then pour over the 
figs in the saute pan (or baking dish). Bake for about 30 minutes, until the 
batter has risen, turned golden brown and is cooked through. Remove from the 
oven, divide between four bowls and serve hot.

 Yotam Ottolenghi’s coconut puddings with peanuts and lime: bring a taste of 
South-East Asia into your home. 
I use 9cm-wide ramekins for these, but any bowl or glass with similar 
dimensions will do. They set quickly – within about an hour – so you don’t need 
to start way ahead of time, though they do keep in the fridge for up to three 
days. Serves six.

800ml coconut milk (ie, 2 tins)
50g caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, slit lengthways and seeds scraped out
Shaved zest of 2 limes, plus 20ml lime juice
Flaked sea salt
6.5g sachet vege-gel (a vegetarian setting agent that’s widely available in 
the baking section of supermarkets –Dr Oetker 
<http://oetker.co.uk/uk-en/our-products/home-baking/baking-ingredients/gelatine/vege-gel.html>
 is just one brand to look out for)
30g dark muscovado sugar
½ ripe mango, peeled and sliced into thin, 2mm x 5cm-long strips
2 tbsp salted and roasted peanuts, finely chopped

Put the coconut milk in a medium saucepan with the sugar, vanilla pod and 
seeds, lime zest and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Gently warm for 10 
minutes, until the milk is steaming and aromatic and the sugar has dissolved, 
then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 10 minutes.

Strain the milk through a fine sieve, squeezing as much liquid from the 
aromatics as possible. Return the milk to the pan and put on a medium heat. Add 
the vege-gel and cook for three minutes, whisking continuously, until the 
vege-gel has dissolved and the milk has thickened slightly. Take off the heat 
and stir in a tablespoon of lime juice, then divide between six ramekins (or 
bowls or glasses of a similar size and capacity) and refrigerate for at least 
an hour.

Put the muscovado sugar in a small saucepan with two tablespoons of water, 
bring to a boil, then leave to bubble for 30-60 seconds, until the sugar has 
melted and the syrup has thickened. Take off the heat, stir in the remaining 
teaspoon of lime juice and leave to cool – you should end up with two 
tablespoons of pourable syrup.

To serve, top each pudding with a slice or two of mango, drizzle on a teaspoon 
of syrup and finish by scattering over a teaspoon of peanuts.
