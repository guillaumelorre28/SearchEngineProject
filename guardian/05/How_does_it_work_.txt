Websites differ slightly from bank to bank, but managing your finances online 
should be as simple as logging on to the bank's website and entering you user 
ID and password. The site will then guide you through the transactions you want 
to carry out.

Some standalone banks, such as Smile and Egg prefer to communicate with you by 
email. They will, for example, send you an email when your statements are 
ready. And if you have an enquiry or want to order a statement, you are 
encouraged to email them.

Telephone support is likely to be expensive as the idea behind these banks is 
that by doing everything on the internet they dramatically reduce overheads and 
pass the savings on to you. Other standalone banks such as IF and Cahoot offer 
telephone support free of charge.
