Gaby Hinsliff (As we give up on saving, we give up on our future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/22/saving-planning-future>, 
22 January) wisely steered clear of the crock of worms that is the workplace 
pension.

Obliged by the government to provide a pension scheme into which all our 
employees will automatically be kettled, we’ve made sure that our small 
publishing company will be ready on time. But it is a small business – we have 
only one employee who qualifies. He plans to opt out of the pension scheme, as 
is his right, and regards the decision as simple: he prefers to take what 
remains of his pay now after PAYE and national insurance, rather than lose a 
further part of it for whatever £35 a week will be worth in 20 years’ time. We 
have, then, wasted time and money setting up a scheme that no one will use.

If the government is seriously concerned that the nation is not saving enough 
for its old age, here are three simple ways in which it might have tackled the 
problem without wasting the time of people like me:

1. Increase NI contributions. What could be simpler or more logical?

2. Amend monetary policy to provide an incentive to save. In recent years 
government policy has encouraged profligacy while penalising thrift.

3. Direct a new wave of quantitative easing at the problem. Apparently the UK 
printed £375bn between 2009 and 2012. I make that roughly £6,250 a head – a 
handy piece of pump-priming.

Who will benefit from the workplace pension scheme? The financial 
services sector, clearly – beyond that, it’s hard to be sure.

• Steve Webb, the pensions minister in the coalition government who was 
responsible for accelerating the timetable in 2011 to raise the state pension 
age of women to 66,later said 
<https://www.saga.co.uk/magazine/money/retirement/pensions/will-you-have-to-wait-longer-for-your-state-pension>
 “I pushed too hard and too fast on raising women’s state pension age”. As 
women born in the 50s, we entirely agree with his candid appraisal; as a 
consequence of Webb pushing “too hard and too fast”, half a million women now 
have to wait at least five years longer for their state pension – and those who 
had the misfortune to be born a few months too late, now have to wait until 
they are 66. This highlights an insensitive disregard for the 50s women who now 
have to plug a six-year gap in their anticipated income.

Steve Webb should honestly add that not only was he too fast, too hard but 
also he was too furtive. John Major’s government abandoned the changes. Future 
governments failed to notify women that these changes were being implemented.

We believe that this government should make transitional or bridging 
arrangements to help women who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase 
to the state pension age. We ask that all women affected should sign the
petition organised by the campaign group WASPI 
<https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/110776> (Women Against State Pension 
Inequality) and contact their MPs to add even more momentum to fighting the 
injustice of the 2011 act.

• What an innovative approach to solving the ubiquitous problem of government 
underfunding of public services, to press beneficiaries of services to 
voluntarily give them up (Pensioners’ anger over BBC licence campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/25/pensioners-bbc-plan-75s-licence-fee-campaign>
, 26 January). This must be an idea that could be widely applied elsewhere, 
beyond the BBC.

Obviously old people should be targeted first, because they are so numerous 
and so expensive. The NHS could advise pensioners to take more, longer walks – 
on short piers – and to keep warm by going to bed early in cold weather, taking 
a week’s supply of sleeping pills to ensure a peaceful night. Otherwise they 
are likely to be heavy users of health services in the last six months of their 
lives.

No need to restrict it to this age group. For example, children should be 
encouraged to truant much more often so that we’re spared the expense of 
building more classrooms and employing more teachers – and every part of the 
welfare state should be required to come forward with its own similar proposals.

Such new thinking is essential, because we all know that what money we have is 
required centrally to reduce taxes on the rich while still being able to 
command international respect by sending our forces all over the world, and 
having a nuclear war button that we could press.

• Your anonymous 71-year-old correspondent (Older women also enjoy age-gap sex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/27/older-women-also-enjoy-age-gap-sex>
, Letters, 28 January) is certainly not unique. When my husband saw her letter 
before I did, he had to ask me if I’d been writing to the Guardian again.
