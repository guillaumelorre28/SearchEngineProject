Danny Dyer was very proud to find out that he was a direct “legitimate” 
descendant ofWilliam the Conqueror <http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/zp88wmn> on 
the BBC’sWho Do You Think You Are? <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04gfg0l>

context. Approximately how many living people are likely to share the same 
status?
