Markets fall after weak US data

The slower growth in US services has pushed Wall Street into negative 
territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down 32 points or 0.2%.

The FTSE 100 has seen its falls accelerate and is now down 70 points, while 
the FTSE Eurofirst 300 has lost 1.3%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and 
we’ll be back tomorrow for the Bank of England’s interest rate decision onSuper

Helena Smith

Over in Greece, and journalists are joining in the general wave of protests 
against proposed pension reforms. Helena Smith reports:

The rally, part of a 24-hour strike, comes ahead of tomorrow’s general strike, 
the third to hit Greece since Syriza was voted back into office in September. 
Journalists claim that government plans to merge their own pension funds with 
others is unlawful and counterproductive.

Tomorrow’s industrial action will see the entire country come to a grinding 
halt. Ironically, left wing Syriza has decided to give the strike its blessing 
and is backing the protests against internationally dictated reforms now 
creating a storm of reaction across Greece. The country has similarly been 
paralysed by protesting farmers who have set up roadblocks and sealed off 
borders nationwide.
 Journalists banners reading “Dignity to journalists. Truth in society.”

The weakening of the global economy means conditions have tightened since the 
Federal Reserve raised US interest rates in December, according to New York Fed 
president William Dudley.

And if such conditions were still in place at the time of its March meeting 
the Fed would have to take that into consideration, he said.

In an interview with MNSI he said the weaker outlook and any further 
strengthening of the dollar could have “serious consequences” for the health of 
the US economy.

The slower growth in US services has pushed Wall Street into negative 
territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down 32 points or 0.2%.

The FTSE 100 has seen its falls accelerate and is now down 70 points, while 
the FTSE Eurofirst 300 has lost 1.3%.

its worst since August 2012.

Over in Greece, and journalists are joining in the general wave of protests 
against proposed pension reforms. Helena Smith reports:

The rally, part of a 24-hour strike, comes ahead of tomorrow’s general strike, 
the third to hit Greece since Syriza was voted back into office in September. 
Journalists claim that government plans to merge their own pension funds with 
others is unlawful and counterproductive.

Tomorrow’s industrial action will see the entire country come to a grinding 
halt. Ironically, left wing Syriza has decided to give the strike its blessing 
and is backing the protests against internationally dictated reforms now 
creating a storm of reaction across Greece. The country has similarly been 
paralysed by protesting farmers who have set up roadblocks and sealed off 
borders nationwide.
