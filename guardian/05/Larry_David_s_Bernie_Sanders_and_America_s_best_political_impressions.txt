Everyone in America today is screaming about laying underwear on the radiator.

In the perfect marriage of artist and repertoire, Larry David’s pinch hit 
during Saturday Night Live’s spoof of the Democratic debate was an instant 
sensation. David was a writer for SNL during the 1984-85 season, and only one 
of his sketches actually made it to air, but like a fine wine gathering dust in 
the dark, he emerged robust and full-throated, ready to poke fun at the 
zeitgeist’s most unlikely pop star. Who better to scream and yell about the 
indignities of the everyman than a guy who’s been doing just that his whole 
career?

The sketch didn’t even get to its biggest laugh line (“Super Pac? I don’t even 
have a backpack!”) before it was clearly one for the books. And since politics 
is all about polls and rankings, we figured: why not line up all the candidates 
for best political impersonations and see who the winner is? If you don’t like 
our picks, you can always press for a recount.

Dana Carvey’s George HW Bush

The first Bush’s policies don’t automatically lend themselves to hilarity. 
Unlike that of his son, Bush’s invasion of Iraq was over relatively quickly. 
“Voodoo economics” is a fun term to say, but harder to build a sketch around. 
Other than his request that we read his lips, not much about this one-termer’s 
character jumps to mind. But Dana Carvey rose to the challenge, by exaggerating 
his weird accent (Connecticut mixed with Texas mixed with the mysterious back 
rooms of malignant political power) and transforming Bush into a self-satisfied 
puppy, wagging his fingers in our face and declaring “Naaa ganna doiit” to 
surprisingly hilarious effect. As Carvey served Bush to us, impressions of his 
impression devolved into a non-verbal bleating of phonemes, until our 41st 
president sounded more like a Muscovy duck than the leader of the free world.

Come gather ye round, I’ll tell you a tale: Saturday Night Live may have 
perfected the timely political impersonation, but the show didn’t invent it. In 
the early 1960s, a young nightclub performer found that if he combed his hair a 
certain way, dropped his Rs and peppered his speech with upper crust “erms”, 
he’d sound quite a bit like President Kennedy. His act became a sensation, as 
did his comedy record The First Family, reportedlybiggest-selling album in 
history

 at the time of its release. At first, some record companies refused to release 
it, thinking it was degrading to national pride. Later, Kennedy himself was 
said to have given out copies as Christmas gifts. (Go back through the early 
seasons of Mad Men; you’ll see it in there.)

Saturday Night Live is the epitome of corporate comedy today, but that wasn’t 
always the case. The original cast was called the “Not Ready For Prime Time 
Players” and its members had their roots firmly established in the 
counterculture. One of the most punk-rock things they ever did was dressing 
Chevy Chase up for his Ford impression: They didn’t do a damn thing. He didn’t 
alter his voice, he didn’t put on any makeup. He just presented himself as 
Gerry Ford and if you didn’t buy it, well, that meant you weren’t cool. Then 
Chase fell down on his ass and acted like a complete nincompoop because in real 
life Ford was atiny bit clumsy <http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fords-clumsiness/>. 
Poor guy.

Maybe we’re jumping the gun by placing this so high, but we #FeelTheBern. Or 
maybe a loud Brooklyn Jew screaming about social welfare and the aggravation of 
trying to change your computer password feels so much like a vision of our 
future, there’s no way not to hold it in high regard.

It causes us great pain to consider Donald Trump a “politician” and not a 
national disgrace, but there’s no point fighting this any longer. Were he to 
decide tomorrow to move deep into an abandoned uranium mine never to return (we 
can dream), he’d still have had an impact on the 2016 election. But before he 
was a candidate, he was just a visible idiot, and Jon Stewart’s version of him 
as a knuckle-dragging Queens County imbecile has given us tremendous joy over 
the years. Stewart’s impersonation had ripple effects, including the imagining 
of the real-estate developer’s minions during hisasinine quest to reveal 
President Obama’s “true birth certificate”

, but Stewart was never funnier than when he channeled Trump himself, razzing 
him fortaking Sarah Palin out for a less-than-true New York slice of pizza

We’ll have no way of knowing for sure, but this feels like a political 
impersonation that actually altered history. Surely voters would have gotten 
terrified of the half-term Alaskan governor before entering the voting booth, 
but it wasn’t until Fey tweaked her wide-eyed folksy demeanor that it became 
truly unacceptable for the American people to allow her such close access to 
the Oval Office. When we play Palin’s voice in our heads, is it the real her or 
is it Fey’s mimicry? Are lines about “seeing Russia from my house” any stupider 
than wondering what “Joe the Plumber 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U67Eg-3jP5k>” would say?

None of us can verify how accurate this impersonation is, but the fact 
remains: this sketch by The Whitest Kids U’ Know is actually the funniest thing 
that ever happened to a president since the electoral college.
