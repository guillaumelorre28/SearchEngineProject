Afternoon summary

 * Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem former business secretary, has spoken out 
against the prospect of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox taking full control 
of Sky.Calling for a full review by the Competition and Markets Authority, 
Cable said: 
This deal may be acceptable to a majority of shareholders but that doesn’t 
mean it is in the public interest.

The minister should now call in the takeover and start the process of 
independent investigation into the impact on plurality and competition.

The National Union of Journalists also objected, saying the government should 
halt the deal until the second stage of the Leveson inquiry, the one that is 
supposed to investigate specific phone-hacking allegations at News of the World 
and elsewhere, has been completed. The NUJ general secretary Michelle 
Stanistreet said:

It is vital that this deal is halted until part two of the Leveson Inquiry has 
taken place. Most of the British public do not believe that Rupert Murdoch is a 
fit and proper person to run BskyB, and whilst there are clear reasons of 
corporate opportunism that drive his desire to finally clinch this deal, 
there’s no benefit for the public in this takeover being given the green light.

 * The Local Government Association has said today’s social care settlement 
from the government is “hugely disappointing”. (See 3.25pm.)

 * Derek McKay, Scotland’s finance minister, has put an above-inflation 
increase in health spending at the centre ofhis draft budget for next year.  
<http://news.gov.scot/news/a-budget-for-scotlands-future-1>He has also 
confirmed that he will not match Westminster’s tax cut for higher earners, 
meaning that from next year higher-rate taxpayers in Scotland will pay more 
income tax than in England.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

David Prentis, the Unison general secretary, has put out a statement about the 
social care settlement. 
<https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2016/12/government-refusing-to-take-responsibility-for-social-care-crisis-says-unison/>
 He says that councils need more money and that, instead of raising council 
tax, the government should be using “the growing surplus of centrally-collected 
business rates to ease the pressure on councils”.

Council chiefs say 'hugely disappointing' Javid announcement fails to address 
social care crisis

Lord Porter, the Conservative peer who chairs the Local Government 
Association, has put out a lengthy and fairly damning statement about today’s 
social care settlement on behalf of the LGA. Here are the key points.

 * Porter said that today’s announcement was “hugely disappointing” and that 
it failed to address the social care crisis. 
Measures announced in today’s settlement will help in part but fall well short 
of what is needed to fully protect the services which care for elderly and 
vulnerable people today and in the future.

Councils, the NHS, charities and care providers have been clear both before 
and since the autumn statement about the need for an urgent injection of 
genuinely new additional government funding to protect services caring for 
elderly and disabled people. Given this unified call for action, it is hugely 
disappointing that today’s settlement has failed to find any of this new money 
to tackle the growing crisis in social care.

Bringing forward council tax raising powers will help some areas in the 
short-term but extra council tax income will not bring in anywhere near enough 
money to alleviate the pressure on social care both now and in the future. 
Increasing the precept raises different amounts of money for social care in 
different parts of the country and will add an extra financial burden on 
already struggling households.

 * He said government cuts planned for next year would more than wipe out any 
extra revenue councils get from being allowed to increase council tax. 
Social care <https://www.theguardian.com/society/social-care> faces a funding 
gap of at least £2.6bn by 2020. Council tax rises will not be enough to prevent 
the need for continued cutbacks to social care services and very many other 
valued local services. Already planned further £2.2bn cuts to revenue support 
grant to councils next year will far exceed the benefit of any extra council 
tax income.

 * He said reallocating money from the new homes bonuses would reduce the 
incentive to build new homes. 
Today’s announcement of funding for social care from New Homes Bonus reforms 
is not new money but a redistribution of funding already promised to councils. 
It is wrong to present this as a solution, given the scale of the funding 
crisis. This is money which was taken from councils in the first place and this 
move will see money taken away from councils which is designed to incentivise 
new homes at a time when the government has made boosting housebuilding a clear 
priority.

 * He called for an “urgent and fundamental review of social care”. 
The government must recognise why social care matters and treat it as a 
national priority. There needs to be an urgent and fundamental review of social 
care and health before next year’s spring budget.Local government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment> leaders, who are 
responsible for social care in their local community, must be part of that 
review. This is imperative to get a long-term, sustainable solution to the 
social care crisis that the most vulnerable people in our society deserve.

 * He said services would be cut because of the impending cuts to council 
budgets. 
Next year will continue to be hugely challenging for all councils, who we 
estimate face an overall funding gap of £5.8bn by 2020. Further government 
funding cuts will result in local authorities up and down the country having to 
make significant reductions to the local services communities rely on, 
including filling potholes, collecting waste, maintaining our parks and green 
spaces and running children’s centres, leisure centres and libraries, to plug 
growing funding gaps.

Lunchtime summary

 * Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has formally lodged its £11.7bn bid to 
take full control of Sky, as he looks to seal a deal to create the most 
powerful media group in Europe. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-pay-tv>
AsMark Sweney reports, Murdoch will now need to gain regulatory approval for 
the deal, which values Sky at more than £18bn, which will give him control of 
pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany and Italy; in addition to ownership of the 
Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and radio group TalkSport. Karen Bradley, the 
culture secretary, now has 10 working days to decide whether the deal raises 
public interest concerns, specifically relating to media plurality.Tom Watson, 
the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, said the bid must be 
referred to Ofcom. He said in a statement: 
This bid was abandoned in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, and now it’s 
back. The secretary of state must refer the bid to Ofcom, to assess whether it 
would result in too much media power being concentrated in too few hands, and 
whether Rupert and James Murdoch are ‘fit and proper persons’ to run a 
broadcaster.

Fox is attempting to finalise this deal as the Christmas break approaches - 
but there is still time for the government to intervene. They must express 
their view to parliament before Christmas.

When she stood on the steps of Downing Street this summer, the prime minister 
said to the people of this country that ‘when we take the big calls, we’ll 
think not of the powerful, but you’. This is a big call. The government needs 
to decide whose side it’s on.

 * Lord Mandelson, the former European commissioner and former Labour cabinet 
minister, and Lord O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, have both backed 
the claim made by Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain’s ambassador to the EU, that 
negotiating a trade deal with the EU could take up to 10 years.(See 11.39am

Former cabinet secretary says no chance of agreeing final post-Brexit deal 
with EU within 2 years

The BBC has just released extracts from an interview that Carolyn Quinn has 
conducted withLord O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, for this weekend’s 
Westminster Hour on Radio 4. O’Donnell said there was no chance of Britain 
concluding all aspects of its Brexit negotiations within two years.

We certainly won’t have come to any final arrangements in two years’ time. We 
might well get to a point where we can symbolically leave but all sorts of 
details will still remain to be sorted out.

We’ll have got some arrangement whereby we can say, right, from now on we’re 
no longer going to be governed by the European court of justice. But it will 
still be unclear precisely what the deal will be for all sorts of parts of 
goods and services for our trade, and certainly may well be unclear about what 
access we might have to their markets.

That was why a transitional deal was essential, he argued. Asked if he agreed 
with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, about “thoughtful politicians” being in 
favour of a transitional deal, O’Donnell said:

I think that’s a statement of the completely blindingly obvious. I mean the 
idea that you can manage this carving out of a new relationship between the UK 
and the EU in 18 months let alone two years, there’s not a chance, there never 
was a chance. That’s not to say we can’t have symbolically left. But it means 
that we’ve got to get our heads round the idea that leaving may be a symbolic 
act and that lots and lots of the details will still remain to be sorted out, 
so the uncertainty will not have gone away.

Asked how long it would take to negotiate a final post-Brexit settlement with 
the EU, O’Donnell replied:

Years and years ... I can imagine it taking at least five years to get through 
all of the details. And I imagine some of the transitional arrangements may be 
longer than that.

Labour accuses government of failing to provide solution to 'spiralling crisis 
in social care'

Teresa Pearce, the shadow communities secretary, has condemned the council 
spending settlement as “all smoke and mirrors”, saying it is not a solution to 
the crisis in social care. In a statement she said:

This local government finance settlement is all smoke and mirrors – pushing 
numbers around but not offering any new money. Whilst we are glad that the 
government has finally acknowledged that there is a deep and spiralling crisis 
in social care, this settlement does not offer any solutions.

Directing £240m from the new homes bonus to fund adult social care will barely 
make a dent in the funding gap, which is predicted to be at least £2.6bn by 
2020. Nor does it compensate for the £4.6bn which has already been cut from 
adult social care since 2010.

The council tax precept has already proven to be an inadequate and short-term 
sticking plaster for a problem which needs long-term answers. This will simply 
not meet existing need.

Shifting the burden on to council tax payers creates a postcode lottery in 
social care services. The most deprived local authorities will be unable to 
raise the money they need through council tax. Wealthy areas will prosper 
whilst poor communities will struggle.

Winter is already here and there is not a penny more for the 1.2m elderly 
people who are living without the care they need. What is clear is that the 
government have no new ideas on how to fund social care, and are just passing 
the buck to overstretched local authorities and council tax payers.

The Green party says it has been told by the BBC that it will not get any 
non-election party political broadcasts in 2017. The BBC has told the Greens 
that, to qualify for PPBs, a party has to have “substantial levels of past and 
current electoral support” and that the BBC’s view is that the Greens don’t 
meet this criteria.

With 1.1m votes at the general election, more than 150 councillors, two seats 
on the London assembly and the Green candidate coming third in the London mayor 
elections, the Greens think this is unfair.Jonathan Bartley, the party’s 
co-leader, said:

This is our message to BBC officials who do not think the Green party should 
get a party political broadcast: we will not be silenced. 2016 has been a year 
marked by fear, insecurity and a rapidly warming planet. Green politics of hope 
and compassion are needed now more than ever.

After overwhelming success in the London and local elections this year it is 
ridiculous for the BBC to say we do not have enough electoral support to 
present our message to the country.

Fair is fair - we will continue to fight the BBC on this until they stop 
shutting us out.

The BBC ruling only applies to general PPBs. The Greens should still qualify 
for PPBs allocated at the time of the local elections.

Clegg says Brexit transitional deal 'completely inevitable'

Jessica Elgot

A transitional deal with the EU after the article 50 process concludes is 
“completely inevitable” to avoid losing access to vital European intelligence 
databases, Nick Clegg has said.

The former deputy prime minister said it had been a misjudgment for the 
government to make a transitional deal into a political issue.

It is a measure of how contorted and constipated the debate is that it has 
become a headline issue. It’s an obvious inevitability, unless you are deluded 
enough to believe you can wrap everything in 18 months.

In a rational world, there would be no politics about this at all. The 
government would say right from the outset that we will get to the Holy Grail 
of Brexit, but that is separate from the divorce process of article 50 and we 
will need a bridge.

This is a self-inflicted controversy and the government could have taken all 
the heat out of this, and said ‘yes of course there will be a transition.’

Publishing the latest in a series of reports he has released on the challenges 
posed by Brexit, <http://www.libdems.org.uk/brexit-challenge-justice>Clegg said 
Theresa May’s promise to cut ties with the European court of justice could a 
serious stumbling block in the UK’s leverage in EU negotiations on intelligence 
and defence co-operation, which the government believes is one of Britain’s key 
assets.

The UK will have to agree to EU rules on data sharing, subject to the ECJ 
jurisdiction, in order to continue access to crime databases such as the 
Schengen information system which allows police forces to share real-time 
alerts on suspects, vehicles and firearms.

In many ways, [the government] could use our co-operation on home affairs as 
an asset, and say ‘we know you didn’t vote to make us less safe, we don’t want 
to lower our guard so this is going to take a while.’Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> could use this to buy time, 
but instead her interpretation of buying herself time is a silence.

Huw Merriman, a Conservative, asks if Javid supports a system of national 
funding for social care.

Javid says there should be a balance between national funding and local 
funding.

And that’s it. The statement is over.

The Local Government Information Unit, a local government thinktank, has 
dismissed today’s announcement as a “sticking plaster” which does not address 
the severity of the adult social care funding crisis. In a statement the LGiU’s 
chief executive Jonathan Carr-West said:

Today’s statement contained some short term measures that will be welcome to 
local government. It was good to finally get some clarity on the roadmap 
towards 100% business rate retention.

However, in many ways, this settlement illustrates exactly what is wrong with 
our over centralised political system as the secretary of state shuffled 
funding from one silo to another.Council tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/counciltax> rises cannot be the answer to 
the crisis in adult social care funding as many of the councils with the most 
pressing care needs have the lowest council tax base.

In the end, this problem cannot be addressed while we continue to treat health 
and social care as separate systems and to protect the NHS at the expense of 
social care. After a decade of public debate all we have is a sticking plaster 
of increased council tax and no long term solution for the greatest public 
policy question of our age.

Governments continue to protect the NHS without vital reform whilst demanding 
more and more from councils to reduce the national deficit. Using local 
authorities as the whipping boy of the Treasury will only go so far. Radical 
reform is long overdue and the Treasury should have the NHS in its sights in 
order to answer this crucial question.

 * Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem former business secretary, has spoken out 
against the prospect of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox taking full control 
of Sky.Calling for a full review by the Competition and Markets Authority, 
Cable said: 
This deal may be acceptable to a majority of shareholders but that doesn’t 
mean it is in the public interest.

The minister should now call in the takeover and start the process of 
independent investigation into the impact on plurality and competition.

The National Union of Journalists also objected, saying the government should 
halt the deal until the second stage of the Leveson inquiry, the one that is 
supposed to investigate specific phone-hacking allegations at News of the World 
and elsewhere, has been completed. The NUJ general secretary Michelle 
Stanistreet said:

It is vital that this deal is halted until part two of the Leveson Inquiry has 
taken place. Most of the British public do not believe that Rupert Murdoch is a 
fit and proper person to run BskyB, and whilst there are clear reasons of 
corporate opportunism that drive his desire to finally clinch this deal, 
there’s no benefit for the public in this takeover being given the green light.

 * The Local Government Association has said today’s social care settlement 
from the government is “hugely disappointing”. (See 3.25pm.)

David Prentis, the Unison general secretary, has put out a statement about the 
social care settlement. 
<https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2016/12/government-refusing-to-take-responsibility-for-social-care-crisis-says-unison/>
 He says that councils need more money and that, instead of raising council 
tax, the government should be using “the growing surplus of centrally-collected 
business rates to ease the pressure on councils”.

instead they're just passing the buckhttps://t.co/grABeyhgaS

<https://twitter.com/DavePrentis/status/809416878280081408>  
Lord Porter, the Conservative peer who chairs the Local Government 
Association, has put out a lengthy and fairly damning statement about today’s 
social care settlement on behalf of the LGA. Here are the key points.

 * Porter said that today’s announcement was “hugely disappointing” and that 
it failed to address the social care crisis. 
Measures announced in today’s settlement will help in part but fall well short 
of what is needed to fully protect the services which care for elderly and 
vulnerable people today and in the future.

Councils, the NHS, charities and care providers have been clear both before 
and since the autumn statement about the need for an urgent injection of 
genuinely new additional government funding to protect services caring for 
elderly and disabled people. Given this unified call for action, it is hugely 
disappointing that today’s settlement has failed to find any of this new money 
to tackle the growing crisis in social care.

Bringing forward council tax raising powers will help some areas in the 
short-term but extra council tax income will not bring in anywhere near enough 
money to alleviate the pressure on social care both now and in the future. 
Increasing the precept raises different amounts of money for social care in 
different parts of the country and will add an extra financial burden on 
already struggling households.

 * He said government cuts planned for next year would more than wipe out any 
extra revenue councils get from being allowed to increase council tax. 
Social care <https://www.theguardian.com/society/social-care> faces a funding 
gap of at least £2.6bn by 2020. Council tax rises will not be enough to prevent 
the need for continued cutbacks to social care services and very many other 
valued local services. Already planned further £2.2bn cuts to revenue support 
grant to councils next year will far exceed the benefit of any extra council 
tax income.

 * He said reallocating money from the new homes bonuses would reduce the 
incentive to build new homes. 
Today’s announcement of funding for social care from New Homes Bonus reforms 
is not new money but a redistribution of funding already promised to councils. 
It is wrong to present this as a solution, given the scale of the funding 
crisis. This is money which was taken from councils in the first place and this 
move will see money taken away from councils which is designed to incentivise 
new homes at a time when the government has made boosting housebuilding a clear 
priority.

 * He called for an “urgent and fundamental review of social care”. 
The government must recognise why social care matters and treat it as a 
national priority. There needs to be an urgent and fundamental review of social 
care and health before next year’s spring budget.Local government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment> leaders, who are 
responsible for social care in their local community, must be part of that 
review. This is imperative to get a long-term, sustainable solution to the 
social care crisis that the most vulnerable people in our society deserve.

 * He said services would be cut because of the impending cuts to council 
budgets. 
Next year will continue to be hugely challenging for all councils, who we 
estimate face an overall funding gap of £5.8bn by 2020. Further government 
funding cuts will result in local authorities up and down the country having to 
make significant reductions to the local services communities rely on, 
including filling potholes, collecting waste, maintaining our parks and green 
spaces and running children’s centres, leisure centres and libraries, to plug 
growing funding gaps.

 * Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has formally lodged its £11.7bn bid to 
take full control of Sky, as he looks to seal a deal to create the most 
powerful media group in Europe. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-pay-tv>
AsMark Sweney reports, Murdoch will now need to gain regulatory approval for 
the deal, which values Sky at more than £18bn, which will give him control of 
pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany and Italy; in addition to ownership of the 
Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and radio group TalkSport. Karen Bradley, the 
culture secretary, now has 10 working days to decide whether the deal raises 
public interest concerns, specifically relating to media plurality.Tom Watson, 
the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, said the bid must be 
referred to Ofcom. He said in a statement: 
This bid was abandoned in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, and now it’s 
back. The secretary of state must refer the bid to Ofcom, to assess whether it 
would result in too much media power being concentrated in too few hands, and 
whether Rupert and James Murdoch are ‘fit and proper persons’ to run a 
broadcaster.

Fox is attempting to finalise this deal as the Christmas break approaches - 
but there is still time for the government to intervene. They must express 
their view to parliament before Christmas.

When she stood on the steps of Downing Street this summer, the prime minister 
said to the people of this country that ‘when we take the big calls, we’ll 
think not of the powerful, but you’. This is a big call. The government needs 
to decide whose side it’s on.

 * Lord Mandelson, the former European commissioner and former Labour cabinet

The BBC has just released extracts from an interview that Carolyn Quinn has 
conducted withLord O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, for this weekend’s 
Westminster Hour on Radio 4. O’Donnell said there was no chance of Britain 
concluding all aspects of its Brexit negotiations within two years.

We certainly won’t have come to any final arrangements in two years’ time. We 
might well get to a point where we can symbolically leave but all sorts of 
details will still remain to be sorted out.

We’ll have got some arrangement whereby we can say, right, from now on we’re 
no longer going to be governed by the European court of justice. But it will 
still be unclear precisely what the deal will be for all sorts of parts of 
goods and services for our trade, and certainly may well be unclear about what 
access we might have to their markets.

That was why a transitional deal was essential, he argued. Asked if he agreed 
with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, about “thoughtful politicians” being in 
favour of a transitional deal, O’Donnell said:

I think that’s a statement of the completely blindingly obvious. I mean the 
idea that you can manage this carving out of a new relationship between the UK 
and the EU in 18 months let alone two years, there’s not a chance, there never 
was a chance. That’s not to say we can’t have symbolically left. But it means 
that we’ve got to get our heads round the idea that leaving may be a symbolic 
act and that lots and lots of the details will still remain to be sorted out, 
so the uncertainty will not have gone away.

Asked how long it would take to negotiate a final post-Brexit settlement with 
the EU, O’Donnell replied:

Years and years ... I can imagine it taking at least five years to get through 
all of the details. And I imagine some of the transitional arrangements may be 
longer than that.

Teresa Pearce, the shadow communities secretary, has condemned the council 
spending settlement as “all smoke and mirrors”, saying it is not a solution to 
the crisis in social care. In a statement she said:

This local government finance settlement is all smoke and mirrors – pushing 
numbers around but not offering any new money. Whilst we are glad that the 
government has finally acknowledged that there is a deep and spiralling crisis 
in social care, this settlement does not offer any solutions.

Directing £240m from the new homes bonus to fund adult social care will barely 
make a dent in the funding gap, which is predicted to be at least £2.6bn by 
2020. Nor does it compensate for the £4.6bn which has already been cut from 
adult social care since 2010.

The council tax precept has already proven to be an inadequate and short-term 
sticking plaster for a problem which needs long-term answers. This will simply 
not meet existing need.

Shifting the burden on to council tax payers creates a postcode lottery in 
social care services. The most deprived local authorities will be unable to 
raise the money they need through council tax. Wealthy areas will prosper 
whilst poor communities will struggle.

Winter is already here and there is not a penny more for the 1.2m elderly 
people who are living without the care they need. What is clear is that the 
government have no new ideas on how to fund social care, and are just passing 
the buck to overstretched local authorities and council tax payers.

The Green party says it has been told by the BBC that it will not get any 
non-election party political broadcasts in 2017. The BBC has told the Greens 
that, to qualify for PPBs, a party has to have “substantial levels of past and 
current electoral support” and that the BBC’s view is that the Greens don’t 
meet this criteria.

With 1.1m votes at the general election, more than 150 councillors, two seats 
on the London assembly and the Green candidate coming third in the London mayor 
elections, the Greens think this is unfair.Jonathan Bartley, the party’s 
co-leader, said:

This is our message to BBC officials who do not think the Green party should 
get a party political broadcast: we will not be silenced. 2016 has been a year 
marked by fear, insecurity and a rapidly warming planet. Green politics of hope 
and compassion are needed now more than ever.

After overwhelming success in the London and local elections this year it is 
ridiculous for the BBC to say we do not have enough electoral support to 
present our message to the country.

Fair is fair - we will continue to fight the BBC on this until they stop 
shutting us out.

The BBC ruling only applies to general PPBs. The Greens should still qualify 
for PPBs allocated at the time of the local elections.
 
A transitional deal with the EU after the article 50 process concludes is 
“completely inevitable” to avoid losing access to vital European intelligence 
databases, Nick Clegg has said.

The former deputy prime minister said it had been a misjudgment for the 
government to make a transitional deal into a political issue.

It is a measure of how contorted and constipated the debate is that it has 
become a headline issue. It’s an obvious inevitability, unless you are deluded 
enough to believe you can wrap everything in 18 months.

In a rational world, there would be no politics about this at all. The 
government would say right from the outset that we will get to the Holy Grail 
of Brexit, but that is separate from the divorce process of article 50 and we 
will need a bridge.

This is a self-inflicted controversy and the government could have taken all 
the heat out of this, and said ‘yes of course there will be a transition.’

Publishing the latest in a series of reports he has released on the challenges 
posed by Brexit, <http://www.libdems.org.uk/brexit-challenge-justice>Clegg said 
Theresa May’s promise to cut ties with the European court of justice could a 
serious stumbling block in the UK’s leverage in EU negotiations on intelligence 
and defence co-operation, which the government believes is one of Britain’s key 
assets.

The UK will have to agree to EU rules on data sharing, subject to the ECJ 
jurisdiction, in order to continue access to crime databases such as the 
Schengen information system which allows police forces to share real-time 
alerts on suspects, vehicles and firearms.

In many ways, [the government] could use our co-operation on home affairs as 
an asset, and say ‘we know you didn’t vote to make us less safe, we don’t want 
to lower our guard so this is going to take a while.’Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> could use this to buy time, 
but instead her interpretation of buying herself time is a silence.

Huw Merriman, a Conservative, asks if Javid supports a system of national 
funding for social care.

Javid says there should be a balance between national funding and local 
funding.

And that’s it. The statement is over.
 
The Local Government Information Unit, a local government thinktank, has 
dismissed today’s announcement as a “sticking plaster” which does not address 
the severity of the adult social care funding crisis. In a statement the LGiU’s 
chief executive Jonathan Carr-West said:

Today’s statement contained some short term measures that will be welcome to 
local government. It was good to finally get some clarity on the roadmap 
towards 100% business rate retention.

However, in many ways, this settlement illustrates exactly what is wrong with 
our over centralised political system as the secretary of state shuffled 
funding from one silo to another.Council tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/counciltax> rises cannot be the answer to 
the crisis in adult social care funding as many of the councils with the most 
pressing care needs have the lowest council tax base.

In the end, this problem cannot be addressed while we continue to treat health 
and social care as separate systems and to protect the NHS at the expense of 
social care. After a decade of public debate all we have is a sticking plaster 
of increased council tax and no long term solution for the greatest public 
policy question of our age.

Governments continue to protect the NHS without vital reform whilst demanding 
more and more from councils to reduce the national deficit. Using local 
authorities as the whipping boy of the Treasury will only go so far. Radical 
reform is long overdue and the Treasury should have the NHS in its sights in 
order to answer this crucial question.
