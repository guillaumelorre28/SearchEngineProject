The Restoration Man 
8pm, Channel 4 


George Clarke’s mission to ensure that no former granary, warehouse, barn or 
windmill goes unconverted continues. This new series of restorations begins 
with a visit to Berkshire, where Steven and Marina are attempting to convert a 
disused water-pumping station – complete with 15-tonne crane – into a family 
home. Clearly a couple after Clarke’s heart, but can they negotiate additional 
difficulties caused by a flood and a newborn child?Phil Harrison

Spies 
9pm, Channel 4


The addictive SAS: Who Dares Wins is the model for this new “elite selection” 
series. Obviously, it is a bit of a challenge to make the cerebral skills of 
espionage as entertaining as watching someone get psychologically tortured on 
an obstacle course, but there is still some interest here. Candidates are 
observed on CCTV living in a communal dorm, while their private lives are 
examined by “Control”. They then have to track a target without being rumbled.

Death in Paradise 
9pm, BBC1 


If you can’t afford that extra bar on the fire this winter, here’s a warming 
surrogate for you: a new series of the Caribbean crime procedural. Unusual 
volcanic activity is troubling scientists on the island; troubles that 
intensify when a senior volcanologist is found dead. Everything points to 
natural causes, save for the mysterious disappearance of key scientific kit. A 
sceptical Humphrey soon discovers several secrets surrounding the scientists.

 Incident room … Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar in Unforgotten. 
The solid, well-written drama returns, with DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/16/nicola-walker-river-unforgotten-roundup-biscuit>
) and DS Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) investigating another historic murder, in 
this case, a body dumped in the river Lea more than 20 years ago. With the 
deceased’s watch and pager (a true staple of 90s tech) offering clues to his 
identity, there are soon four suspects in the frame. But will the cop, the 
barrister, the nurse or the schoolteacher be found responsible?Ali Catterall

Sword, Musket & Machine Gun: Britain’s Armed History
9pm, BBC4


Silver fox Dr Sam Willis kicks off this swashbuckling new three-parter, 
swinging some wicked-looking clubs in a reconstructed first world war trench. 
Turns out that even in the most mechanised conflict to date, it was still a 
good idea to have a studded cudgel handy. From there, Willis teleports way back 
to the Battle of Hastings, to examine how weapons helped carve out our national 
identity.Graeme Virtue

Brooklyn Nine-Nine 
9pm, E4


Although it has undeservedly struggled for viewers in the US, this excellent 
comedy returns for fourth season. Set in New York’s 99 precinct, it mixes the 
brisk, no-nonsense pace of old-style cop shows with a torrent of gags. In this 
opening double bill, Jake and Holt’s lives under witness protection in Florida 
go awry when a video of them goes viral; they’re then forced to stage an 
unorthodox jailbreak. Meanwhile, an ineffectual captain takes over at the 
precinct.David Stubbs

Check It Out! With Dr Steve Brule
12midnight, Fox


With his electroshock hair and awkward presentational style, Steve Brule is a 
terrible roving reporter, alienating oblivious interviewees with his mercurial 
mood swings and slapstick pratfalls. This mayhem may be entertaining, but the 
real joke is that Brule is Oscar nomineeJohn C Reilly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/09/john-c-reilly-actor> in full Ali 
G mode. In this episode, he crashes a public library and a youth spelling bee 
in an attempt to get to grips with the concept of language. GV

Film choice

Bronson (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2008) 1.45am, Film4
This unrelentingly violent biopic tells the real-life story of small-time 
crook Michael Peters, who beefed up, took the name of movie hardman Charles 
Bronson, and became Britain’s most aggressive and feared convict, spending more 
than 30 years inside. It’s a harrowing portrait of one man against the world 
and, amazingly, through Refn’s intelligent direction andTom Hardy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hardy>’s stunning performance, a familiar 
human emerges from the mayhem.
