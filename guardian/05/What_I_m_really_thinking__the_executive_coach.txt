The woman in front of me makes a seven-figure salary, barely sleeps, works 80 
hours a week, and refuses to pay for someone else to wash her laundry, cook 
family meals or do the dishes. She feels these tasks are her duty. “It’s the 
least I can do to chip in at home,” she says.

Like many of my clients, she has proven her stellar decision-making at work. 
She led the organisation’s restructuring efforts. She counsels endless 
employees about HR issues and work stressors, but is blind when it comes to the 
bigger picture of her own life.

My job is to help high-powered people be their best professionally, which 
sometimes means taking a closer look at their life beyond the workplace. They 
are not always open to my ideas.

I ask my client a series of questions: “What are your priorities at work? At 
home?” Pairing socks doesn’t make the top 20. Quality time with the family is 
way up the list, but she is drawn into nitty-gritty housekeeping tasks.

Her executive assistant interrupts to announce a crisis. Politely, my client 
pauses our meeting to hammer out two emails to trusted team members. When we 
resume I ask, “To whom can you delegate some of your tasks at home?” She looks 
at her nails and shrugs.

I’ve had this conversation with dozens of executive women, but never with a 
male leader. Typically, the female leaders who learn to ask for help at home 
come to realise that frying onions has nothing to do with their value as a 
mother or spouse.

But today, my client isn’t ready to put down the apron.
