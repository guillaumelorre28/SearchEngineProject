Larry Elliott: Will Osborne remain a lucky general?

And finally, here’s our own Larry Elliott’s take on today’s IFS report:

Napoleon would have approved of George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne>. “I know he’s a good 
general”, the French emperor once said. “But is he lucky?”

The answer to that question, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies>, is yes. 
The chancellor got lucky when the Office for Budget Responsibility raised its 
forecasts for tax revenue and cut its predictions for interest payments on the 
national debt. That gave Osborne some much-needed wiggle room to delay welfare 
cuts, choke back on austerity and spend a bit more on infrastructure.

The question posed by the UK’s leading experts on the public finances is 
whether Osborne will stay lucky. He has set himself a cast-iron target – to run 
a budget surplus by the end of this parliament in 2020 – and if the OBR 
projections prove to be wrong he will face a simple choice: abandon the target, 
cut spending or raise taxes.

Paul Johnson, the IFS’s director, thinks the likeliest outcome would be that 
the chancellor would raise taxes – and the IFS analysis of the autumn statement 
and spending review shows why.......

If Osborne misses his new target, there really is nothing left to cut

The Office for Budget Responsibility has been attracting flak for its more 
optimistic fiscal forecasts.

Some economists are concerned that the new projections - which gave the 
chancellor a welcome windfall which he rapidly spent - may be unrealistic.

Chris Giles of the FT has the details:

Some thought the OBR was too optimistic on revenues. 

Andrew Goodwin of Oxford Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> said the fiscal watchdog 
“provided the chancellor with an unexpected free pass” on the public finances. 
He said the OBR had a history of optimism on tax revenues and “today’s forecast 
revisions move them even further towards the optimistic end of this scale”.

Fathom Consulting said the chancellor was paying for higher than expected 
public spending with “notional revenues”, and Francois Cabau of Barclays said 
caution was required over the Autumn Statement details that “the bulk of the 
fiscal performance would be owing to improved tax receipts and a lower interest 
rate burden”....

Q: Will there be a two-tier benefit system as people are moved onto Universal 
Credit?

Andrew Hood agrees that any system that introduces cuts for new claimants but 
protects existing ones creates a two-tier system.

There is transitional protection, but expressed in cash terms, which means 
that people should not receive less under the new system (inflation, though, 
could erode that protection).

Transitional protection can last a very long time, Paul Johnson adds.

Q: And how can transitional protection be lost?

Several ways:

 * Acquiring or losing a partner loses protection.

 * Losing off UC entirely - if one earns more than the maximum allowed in a 
week and no longer qualify.

 * If my income falls, my UC entitlement doesn’t rise, until I’ve cleared the 
transitional protection.

Q: Is George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> 
right to spend the ‘windfall’ from the OBR’s improved fiscal forecasts?

Gemma Tetlow agrees that the chancellor’s response is a little ‘asymmetric’ 
(as the chancellor could have banked the money and gunned for a more rapid 
fiscal consolidation).

Paul Johnson gives the chancellor some (guarded) support -- saying the 
alternative would have been to press on and slash police spending, foreign 
spending, or hike taxes.

It doesn’t seem to me to be not wise to not implement massive spending cuts if 
you think you might not have to.

Q: Is Iain Duncan Smith right when he says today that under the new Universal 
Credit system, people are moving into work faster and earning more than under 
the current?

Paul Johnson declines to comment on the behaviour of the very small number of 
people already on UC; the IFS’s work relates to the distributional impact when 
it is fully implemented.

Onto questions.

He says that the government overestimated the savings from the tax credit 
cuts, which is why the u-turn only yields £3.4bn not the £4.4bn expected.

Q: What is the distributional impact of Universal credit system?


The impact is complicated, and doesn’t really match people’s place on the 
income scale.

Single earner couples tend to do well, while two income families and single 
parents do less well, Hood adds.

The IFS has also crunched some numbers, showing how the universal credit 
system will change the benefit system:

Universal credit vs. the system it is replacing

 * UC now represents additional cut on top of other changes 
 * – Cuts benefit entitlements by £3.7bn a year in the long run 
 * – Existing claimants protected in cash terms when moved onto UC 
 * 4.5m working families affected by introduction of UC 
 * – 2.6m lose an average of £1,600 a year 
 * – 1.9m gain an average of £1,400 a year 
 * – Total cut of £1.5bn a year 
 * 1.8m non-working families affected by introduction of UC 
 * – 1.2m lose an average of £2,500 a year 
 * – 0.6m gain an average of £1,000 a year 
 * – Total cut of £2.2bn a year Facebook

IFS: Government still planning big cuts to in-work benefits

The IFS’s Andrew Hood is now hammering home the point that the benefit system 
will still be much less generous in the long term.

He says:

In the long run, the system will be much less generous to low income 
households. That’s the big headline...because other cuts are going ahead

This chart confirms that point - showing that the poorest families are 
actually losing slightly morein the long term than they were before.

benefits picturepic.twitter.com/C0MtWBuFUJ <https://t.co/C0MtWBuFUJ>

The tax-credit u-turn has “no long-term effect”, he insists. The government is 
still planning “deep cuts to working-age benefits”, including to low-income 
working families.

On average, the overall package will strengthen work incentives, Hood says.

But there are still measures that will hurt low-paid workers, such as cuts to 
the work allowance:

This, Hood says, is a very similar impact to the tax credit changes which have 
now been reversed.

Andrew Hood of the IFS is now running through the latest welfare changes.

The big picture is that:


 * Government still planning £12bn cut to annual benefit spending by end of 
the parliament 
 * – But less than half delivered by 2017-18 
 * – £4bn from freeze to 2020, £4-5bn additional cuts to universal credit, 
£11⁄2bn cuts to housing benefit spending (plus other smaller changes) 
 * Benefit spending excluding state pensions in 2020-21 forecast to be at its 
lowest as a share of national income for 30 years Facebook

The IFS is also concerned about Osborne’s plan to allow local councils to 
raise an extra 2% from residents, to fund social care in their area.

The problem is that councils who already charge the highest bills can 
obviously raise more cash than an area with lower charges.

Councils in “leafy areas with high council tax and relatively low social care 
needs”, such as Rutland, benefit most from this change, says theDavid Phillips, 
senior research economist at the IFS.

It is also “very tricky” to see how central government can make sure that 
extra funds are devoted to social care.

The iFS is now outlining the huge funding cuts which local government’s now 
face.

Level of cuts to local government is incredible (and politically cynical: 
voters will blame councils)https://t.co/wYGpQSiXHf <https://t.co/wYGpQSiXHf>

If they keep cutting grants in line with the existing formula, then councils 
who have already taken the biggest hit will suffer the most.

And finally, here’s our own Larry Elliott’s take on today’s IFS report:

Napoleon would have approved of George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne>. “I know he’s a good 
general”, the French emperor once said. “But is he lucky?”

The answer to that question, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies>, is yes. 
The chancellor got lucky when the Office for Budget Responsibility raised its 
forecasts for tax revenue and cut its predictions for interest payments on the 
national debt. That gave Osborne some much-needed wiggle room to delay welfare 
cuts, choke back on austerity and spend a bit more on infrastructure.

The question posed by the UK’s leading experts on the public finances is 
whether Osborne will stay lucky. He has set himself a cast-iron target – to run 
a budget surplus by the end of this parliament in 2020 – and if the OBR 
projections prove to be wrong he will face a simple choice: abandon the target, 
cut spending or raise taxes.

Paul Johnson, the IFS’s director, thinks the likeliest outcome would be that 
the chancellor would raise taxes – and the IFS analysis of the autumn statement 
and spending review shows why.......

If Osborne misses his new target, there really is nothing left to cut

That’s probably all for today. Goodnight and thanks for reading. GW
 
The Office for Budget Responsibility has been attracting flak for its more 
optimistic fiscal forecasts.

Some economists are concerned that the new projections - which gave the 
chancellor a welcome windfall which he rapidly spent - may be unrealistic.

Chris Giles of the FT has the details:

Some thought the OBR was too optimistic on revenues. 

Andrew Goodwin of Oxford Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> said the fiscal watchdog 
“provided the chancellor with an unexpected free pass” on the public finances. 
He said the OBR had a history of optimism on tax revenues and “today’s forecast 
revisions move them even further towards the optimistic end of this scale”.

Fathom Consulting said the chancellor was paying for higher than expected 
public spending with “notional revenues”, and Francois Cabau of Barclays said 
caution was required over the Autumn Statement details that “the bulk of the 
fiscal performance would be owing to improved tax receipts and a lower interest 
rate burden”....

Q: Will there be a two-tier benefit system as people are moved onto Universal 
Credit?

Andrew Hood agrees that any system that introduces cuts for new claimants but 
protects existing ones creates a two-tier system.

There is transitional protection, but expressed in cash terms, which means 
that people should not receive less under the new system (inflation, though, 
could erode that protection).

Transitional protection can last a very long time, Paul Johnson adds.

Q: And how can transitional protection be lost?

Several ways:

 * Acquiring or losing a partner loses protection.

 * Losing off UC entirely - if one earns more than the maximum allowed in a 
week and no longer qualify.

 * If my income falls, my UC entitlement doesn’t rise, until I’ve cleared the 
transitional protection.

Sky’s Ed Conway sums it up:

IFS broad message: yday makes life less painful for welfare recipients in 
short run but slightly worse in long runpic.twitter.com/L7Rs9JT6ls

<https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/669887944145149952>  
Q: Is George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> 
right to spend the ‘windfall’ from the OBR’s improved fiscal forecasts?

Gemma Tetlow agrees that the chancellor’s response is a little ‘asymmetric’ 
(as the chancellor could have banked the money and gunned for a more rapid 
fiscal consolidation).

Paul Johnson gives the chancellor some (guarded) support -- saying the 
alternative would have been to press on and slash police spending, foreign 
spending, or hike taxes.

It doesn’t seem to me to be not wise to not implement massive spending cuts if 
you think you might not have to.
 
Q: Is Iain Duncan Smith right when he says today that under the new Universal 
Credit system, people are moving into work faster and earning more than under 
the current?

Paul Johnson declines to comment on the behaviour of the very small number of 
people already on UC; the IFS’s work relates to the distributional impact when 
it is fully implemented.
 
Onto questions.

He says that the government overestimated the savings from the tax credit 
cuts, which is why the u-turn only yields £3.4bn not the £4.4bn expected.

Q: What is the distributional impact of Universal credit system?


The impact is complicated, and doesn’t really match people’s place on the 
income scale.

Single earner couples tend to do well, while two income families and single 
parents do less well, Hood adds.
 
The IFS has also crunched some numbers, showing how the universal credit 
system will change the benefit system:

Universal credit vs. the system it is replacing

 * UC now represents additional cut on top of other changes 
 * – Cuts benefit entitlements by £3.7bn a year in the long run 
 * – Existing claimants protected in cash terms when moved onto UC 
 * 4.5m working families affected by introduction of UC 
 * – 2.6m lose an average of £1,600 a year 
 * – 1.9m gain an average of £1,400 a year 
 * – Total cut of £1.5bn a year 
 * 1.8m non-working families affected by introduction of UC 
 * – 1.2m lose an average of £2,500 a year 
 * – 0.6m gain an average of £1,000 a year 
 * – Total cut of £2.2bn a year  
The IFS’s Andrew Hood is now hammering home the point that the benefit system 
will still be much less generous in the long term.

He says:

In the long run, the system will be much less generous to low income 
households. That’s the big headline...because other cuts are going ahead

This chart confirms that point - showing that the poorest families are 
actually losing slightly morein the long term than they were before.

IFS notes little change since yesterday's autumn statement in working age 
benefits picturepic.twitter.com/C0MtWBuFUJ <https://t.co/C0MtWBuFUJ>

The tax-credit u-turn has “no long-term effect”, he insists. The government is 
still planning “deep cuts to working-age benefits”, including to low-income 
working families.

On average, the overall package will strengthen work incentives, Hood says.

But there are still measures that will hurt low-paid workers, such as cuts to 
the work allowance:

This, Hood says, is a very similar impact to the tax credit changes which have 
now been reversed.
 
Abandoning the planned cuts to tax credits will cost £3.4bn in the 2016-17 
financial year, Andrew Hood explains - not the £4.4bn expected.

Andrew Hood of the IFS is now running through the latest welfare changes.

The big picture is that:


 * Government still planning £12bn cut to annual benefit spending by end of 
the parliament 
 * – But less than half delivered by 2017-18 
 * – £4bn from freeze to 2020, £4-5bn additional cuts to universal credit, 
£11⁄2bn cuts to housing benefit spending (plus other smaller changes) 
 * Benefit spending excluding state pensions in 2020-21 forecast to be at its 
lowest as a share of national income for 30 years  
Giving councils full retention of business rates is ‘genuinely revolutionary’, 
David Phillips adds, and part of the government’s devolution of powers:

The IFS is also concerned about Osborne’s plan to allow local councils to 
raise an extra 2% from residents, to fund social care in their area.

The problem is that councils who already charge the highest bills can 
obviously raise more cash than an area with lower charges.

Councils in “leafy areas with high council tax and relatively low social care 
needs”, such as Rutland, benefit most from this change, says theDavid Phillips, 
senior research economist at the IFS.

It is also “very tricky” to see how central government can make sure that 
extra funds are devoted to social care.
 
The iFS is now outlining the huge funding cuts which local government’s now 
face.

If they keep cutting grants in line with the existing formula, then councils 
who have already taken the biggest hit will suffer the most.
