So our finalists are Danny and Oti, Louise and Kevin, and Ore and Joanne – 
it’s a Clifton double and the hottest dancer in Strictly history (I’m talking 
about Oti, btw). Should be a hard-fought final, so join me next Saturday at 
6.40pm for a glitter-tastic night in.


Thank you all for joining in, feel free to swing by Twitter @heidistephens and 
say hello, otherwise I’ll see you next Saturday!

Claudia and AJ dance their final dance to Sybil’s The Love I Lost, which is an 
absolute 90s banger.

Because it’s the Semi and they’ve got to pad out 40 minutes, Claudia gets a 
montage!

I’m really sad that Claudia and AJ aren’t in the Final next week – Claudia’s 
confidence has grown so much, and their Showdance would have been something to 
behold. Also she’s a West Country girl like me, and you’ve got to support the 
locals.

Claudia and AJ say lovely things about each other, and it’s getting a bit 
dusty in here.

So what will the judges do? Craig saves Danny and Oti, even though both dances 
deserved tens. Darcey does likewise, and Bruno follows the trend.

Len says “I’d have picked Claudia, but she’s not doing the Strictly tour so I 
can’t risk her winning”. OK, he doesn’t really.

Time for a revival of Claudia and AJ’s Quickstep, which was my favourite dance 
of last night. It’s still entirely fabulous, and if the judges were deciding on 
this dance alone, I think I’d pick this. But of course that isn’t how Strictly 
works, is it?

Right, dance-off time! Danny and Oti are up first, and he’s still loitering on 
that pier. It’s a lovely American Smooth, albeit a bit bouncy and not very 
smooth for my liking. That said, the leap at the end is still incredible.

It’s CLAUDIA AND AJ the dance-off, which means LOUISE AND KEVIN are safely 
through.


That’s a brace of weeping Cliftons in the final, and Claudia and AJ gone, 
barring Danny dropping Oti on her head. Bum.

Turns out Len’s Lens is actually quite interesting. Damn, what a time to find 
out.

Hooray, a Len’s Lens montage!

It’s time for the very last Len’s Lens, so as a mark of respect I’m going to 
pay attention for pretty much the first time ever.

It’s time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Sting, because musical 
relevance on Strictly is a ship that sailed several decades ago. This week last 
year we had Kylie Minogue singing about her winter fuel allowance.

In summary: it’s quite dreary. Oh no wait, it’s a climate change anthem, I 
just heard something about penguins and ice disappearing. Dreary, yet worthy.

Oti is shocked to be in the dance-off. Welcome to the public vote. 


Not that it will do Danny any harm for next week’s final, as now his fans will 
remember to vote for him.

Right, let’s get down to business. The first couple in next week’s Grand Final 
is….ORE AND JOANNE. Ore is in bits, I’m really pleased for him.

And the first couple in this week’s dance-off is…DANNY AND OTI!

Ooh, didn’t see that coming. Bye bye whoever is up against him.

Last night on Strictly – a really very decent semi, with some great dancing 
from all four couples. Highs: a couple of brilliant Quicksteps, a weird but 
kind of wonderful Argentine from Ore and Joanne, Oti’s blue dress, Claudia 
Winkleman face down on a crashmat. Lows: Louise’s costume hell, the Dave Clark 
Tango, Bruno evidently jacked up on sugar and dishing out tens like Skittles.

So our finalists are Danny and Oti, Louise and Kevin, and Ore and Joanne – 
it’s a Clifton double and the hottest dancer in Strictly history (I’m talking 
about Oti, btw). Should be a hard-fought final, so join me next Saturday at 
6.40pm for a glitter-tastic night in.


Thank you all for joining in, feel free to swing by Twitter @heidistephens and 
say hello, otherwise I’ll see you next Saturday!
 
Claudia and AJ dance their final dance to Sybil’s The Love I Lost, which is an 
absolute 90s banger.
 
Because it’s the Semi and they’ve got to pad out 40 minutes, Claudia gets a 
montage!
 
I’m really sad that Claudia and AJ aren’t in the Final next week – Claudia’s 
confidence has grown so much, and their Showdance would have been something to 
behold. Also she’s a West Country girl like me, and you’ve got to support the 
locals.

Claudia and AJ say lovely things about each other, and it’s getting a bit 
dusty in here.
 
So what will the judges do? Craig saves Danny and Oti, even though both dances 
deserved tens. Darcey does likewise, and Bruno follows the trend.

Len says “I’d have picked Claudia, but she’s not doing the Strictly tour so I 
can’t risk her winning”. OK, he doesn’t really.
 
Time for a revival of Claudia and AJ’s Quickstep, which was my favourite dance 
of last night. It’s still entirely fabulous, and if the judges were deciding on 
this dance alone, I think I’d pick this. But of course that isn’t how Strictly 
works, is it?
 
Right, dance-off time! Danny and Oti are up first, and he’s still loitering on 
that pier. It’s a lovely American Smooth, albeit a bit bouncy and not very 
smooth for my liking. That said, the leap at the end is still incredible.
 
It’s CLAUDIA AND AJ the dance-off, which means LOUISE AND KEVIN are safely 
through.


That’s a brace of weeping Cliftons in the final, and Claudia and AJ gone, 
barring Danny dropping Oti on her head. Bum.
 
Turns out Len’s Lens is actually quite interesting. Damn, what a time to find 
out.

Hooray, a Len’s Lens montage!
 
It’s time for the very last Len’s Lens, so as a mark of respect I’m going to 
pay attention for pretty much the first time ever.
 
It’s time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Sting, because musical 
relevance on Strictly is a ship that sailed several decades ago. This week last 
year we had Kylie Minogue singing about her winter fuel allowance.

In summary: it’s quite dreary. Oh no wait, it’s a climate change anthem, I 
just heard something about penguins and ice disappearing. Dreary, yet worthy.

 
Oti is shocked to be in the dance-off. Welcome to the public vote. 


Not that it will do Danny any harm for next week’s final, as now his fans will 
remember to vote for him.

 
Right, let’s get down to business. The first couple in next week’s Grand Final 
is….ORE AND JOANNE. Ore is in bits, I’m really pleased for him.

And the first couple in this week’s dance-off is…DANNY AND OTI!

Ooh, didn’t see that coming. Bye bye whoever is up against him.
 
Last night on Strictly – a really very decent semi, with some great dancing 
from all four couples. Highs: a couple of brilliant Quicksteps, a weird but 
kind of wonderful Argentine from Ore and Joanne, Oti’s blue dress, Claudia 
Winkleman face down on a crashmat. Lows: Louise’s costume hell, the Dave Clark 
Tango, Bruno evidently jacked up on sugar and dishing out tens like Skittles.
 
Tess and Claudia Dress Watch: Tess in a red affair that does nothing for her 
magnificent cleavage, Claudia in black sequins. Both a bit Next Boxing Day Sale.
