lyrics to the show’s famous instrumental opener.

Clad in a tuxedo, Legend appeared on Monday night’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel 
Live to perform his rendition of the song on the heels ofDownton Abbey’s series

Legend spared no one in the song, poking fun at individual characters and 
noting the show’s “very white” cast.

“Everyone we know is very white,” the song began. “We don’t have one black 
friend.”

After pointing out that everyone in the show has “so many hats to wear”, 
Legend took aim at the Crawley family matriarch, famously portrayed by Maggie 
Smith.


“Grandmamma is always such a witch,” Legend sang. “She needs to get laid.”

He then melodiously stated facts about other characters like Mr Bates (“a 
murderer but he’s a real nice guy”) and Thomas Barrow (“We have a footman who 
is gay. He’s always carrying a tray”). Legend couldn’t sing about Downton Abbey 
without shedding light on favorite British period drama pastimes: drinking tea, 
taking naps, eating scones and gossiping.


“Let’s all ride horses and talk smack,” he sang.


The song peaked and ended as Legend talked smack on Edith, the second Crawley 
daughter.


“Edith is such a loser, why won’t she just die? Why? Why?” the Oscar-winner 
warbled.
