So that’s it for Week 2 – thank you everyone for joining in and being very 
funny as ever, make sure you come back for Bread Week next week.

I’m actually off on my holidays next Wednesday, squeezing in a break during 
what’s known as the ‘Strictly Gap’. So somebody else will be liveblogging Bake 
Off for the next three weeks. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter 
@heidistephens, or Instagram if you have any interest whatsoever in pictures of 
Spanish/French vistas and tipsy selfies.

See you on Saturday for the Strictly launch show liveblog (6.50pm BBC1), or 
back here in a few weeks! Cheers, Hx

It’s between Candice and Andrew for Star Baker – I want Andrew to win because 
he’s adorable. Val to go home, surely?

Star Baker this week is…CANDICE! And going home is…LOUISE! Oh, really? Should 
have been Val, surely? Poor Louise, the falling-down church was her downfall.

Candice needs a hand getting her gingerbread pub to the table, so asks Mel to 
carry her jugs. Poor Sue, missing innuendo treats like this. It looks 
brilliant, down to the ginger cake carpet. “Who wants to eat some carpet?” Asks 
Mel. “I’ll eat some carpet”, says Mary. This week’s GBBO is pure filth, and I 
love it.

Kate’s looks lovely but her gingerbread doesn’t taste of ginger. Jane’s 
gingerbread is too soft, and Rav’s tastes a bit burned (hmm). Michael piping is 
less Santa’s workshop and more Satan’s cottage, but his gingerbread is the best 
yet. Selasi’s design is excellent, but needed more gingerbread. Louise’s 
bombed-out church looks terrible, but tastes good.

The detail on Val’s Empire State is impressive, but lacks finish. However 
Val’s sister Susan tastes lovely, according to Paul *Harry Hill side-eye to 
camera*. Benjamina’s showstopper was a bit messy, but Tom’s tastes good.

Andrew’s punting showstopper is rather lovely, and his gingerbread reminds 
Paul of his mum’s, which is apparently a good thing. Yay for Spreadsheet Andrew.

Louise’s church has now completely collapsed, as has Val’s cityscape. To make 
matters worse, the bakers have to carry their gingerbread stories to the front 
of the tent.

So much broken gingerbread going on right now, and I really hope Louise’s 
church isn’t a metaphor for her future marital happiness. Andrew’s and Selasi’s 
look pretty good, whilst Val’s New York looks like a scene out of Independence 
Day.

Remind me to never, ever attempt a gingerbread house.

“Fear is the mind killer. You’ve just got to go for it, and trust”, says Tom, 
who is clearly one of those terrible people who puts motivational quotes on 
Facebook. “You can practise as much as you like, but one little slip and your 
structure can just collapse” adds Michael, ominously. You’re making a house of 
biscuits, Michael, this isn’t open heart surgery.

 Meanwhile, Candice’s walls have caved in.

One hour to go! Kate is making caramel to glue her bits of gingerbread 
together, whilst Michael is making grey royal icing, which should never be a 
thing. Mel is apparently trying not to put the wind up Val, whilst pursuing her 
around the tent and reminding her how much she still has to do. Val looks like 
a meltdown might be incoming.

I love that Selasi is making stained glass church windows out of boiled 
sweets. Andrew is ticking stuff off a list, and Louise can smell burning. It’s 
one of Rav’s gingerbread trees, which appear to have been in a forest fire.

I feel like we need to know more about the story of Tom and Pod getting lost 
up a mountain. Is it like Uncle Bryn and Jason’s fishing trip in Gavin & Stacey?

Kate is making a gingerbread brownie camp, because she’s entirely wholesome 
and lovely. Mary is trying to remember the brownie promise, while Val’s 
gingerbread is already too short for the template she’s made. I fear Val is not 
long for this tent.

So that’s it for Week 2 – thank you everyone for joining in and being very 
funny as ever, make sure you come back for Bread Week next week.

I’m actually off on my holidays next Wednesday, squeezing in a break during 
what’s known as the ‘Strictly Gap’. So somebody else will be liveblogging Bake 
Off for the next three weeks. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter 
@heidistephens, or Instagram if you have any interest whatsoever in pictures of 
Spanish/French vistas and tipsy selfies.

See you on Saturday for the Strictly launch show liveblog (6.50pm BBC1), or 
back here in a few weeks! Cheers, Hx
 
It’s between Candice and Andrew for Star Baker – I want Andrew to win because 
he’s adorable. Val to go home, surely?

Star Baker this week is…CANDICE! And going home is…LOUISE! Oh, really? Should 
have been Val, surely? Poor Louise, the falling-down church was her downfall.
 
Candice needs a hand getting her gingerbread pub to the table, so asks Mel to 
carry her jugs. Poor Sue, missing innuendo treats like this. It looks 
brilliant, down to the ginger cake carpet. “Who wants to eat some carpet?” Asks 
Mel. “I’ll eat some carpet”, says Mary. This week’s GBBO is pure filth, and I 
love it.

 
Kate’s looks lovely but her gingerbread doesn’t taste of ginger. Jane’s 
gingerbread is too soft, and Rav’s tastes a bit burned (hmm). Michael piping is 
less Santa’s workshop and more Satan’s cottage, but his gingerbread is the best 
yet. Selasi’s design is excellent, but needed more gingerbread. Louise’s 
bombed-out church looks terrible, but tastes good.
 
The detail on Val’s Empire State is impressive, but lacks finish. However 
Val’s sister Susan tastes lovely, according to Paul *Harry Hill side-eye to 
camera*. Benjamina’s showstopper was a bit messy, but Tom’s tastes good.
 
Andrew’s punting showstopper is rather lovely, and his gingerbread reminds 
Paul of his mum’s, which is apparently a good thing. Yay for Spreadsheet Andrew.
 
Louise’s church has now completely collapsed, as has Val’s cityscape. To make 
matters worse, the bakers have to carry their gingerbread stories to the front 
of the tent.

 
So much broken gingerbread going on right now, and I really hope Louise’s 
church isn’t a metaphor for her future marital happiness. Andrew’s and Selasi’s 
look pretty good, whilst Val’s New York looks like a scene out of Independence 
Day.

Remind me to never, ever attempt a gingerbread house.

 
“Fear is the mind killer. You’ve just got to go for it, and trust”, says Tom, 
who is clearly one of those terrible people who puts motivational quotes on 
Facebook. “You can practise as much as you like, but one little slip and your 
structure can just collapse” adds Michael, ominously. You’re making a house of 
biscuits, Michael, this isn’t open heart surgery.

 Meanwhile, Candice’s walls have caved in. 
 
One hour to go! Kate is making caramel to glue her bits of gingerbread 
together, whilst Michael is making grey royal icing, which should never be a 
thing. Mel is apparently trying not to put the wind up Val, whilst pursuing her 
around the tent and reminding her how much she still has to do. Val looks like 
a meltdown might be incoming.
 
Paul and Mary are worried about Val. We’re all worried about Val, to be honest.
 
I love that Selasi is making stained glass church windows out of boiled 
sweets. Andrew is ticking stuff off a list, and Louise can smell burning. It’s 
one of Rav’s gingerbread trees, which appear to have been in a forest fire.

I feel like we need to know more about the story of Tom and Pod getting lost 
up a mountain. Is it like Uncle Bryn and Jason’s fishing trip in Gavin & Stacey?

 
If I did this challenge, I’d make a shack of baking despair floating on a lake 
of my own tears, sprinkled with my crumbling self-esteem.

 
 Tom’s structure tells the tale of when Tom and his best mate Pod got lost up 
a mountain, whilst Andrew is telling the story of his Cambridge days, punting 
on the Cam. Golly.
