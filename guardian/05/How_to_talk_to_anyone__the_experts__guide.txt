How to talk to… children and teenagers, by family therapist Karen Holford

Children often don’t have the words to say what they’re feeling, and they 
don’t always understand what we’re looking for when we ask them questions. So 
if you ask, “How was your day?” and you’re met with a grunt or a shrug, it’s 
not because your child is trying to hide something from you. It’s because they 
don’t see why you could possibly want to know, or which part of their day 
you’re interested in. It can help to make your questions more specific: “What 
was the best thing about your day? What was the hardest thing?” And, of course, 
it helps if you are really listening. We often don’t give children our full 
attention.

Try to meet your child’s emotions, rather than telling them how to feel. If 
your child comes home saying, “I hate everyone in my class”, your first 
reaction might be, “That’s not a nice thing to say”, or, “Things can’t be that 
bad.” Try to pay attention to the feeling rather than the content. Help them 
find other words to draw out their emotions – “It sounds like you had a really 
bad day” – so they can talk about it in a different way.

Teenagers often respond better if you’re doing something alongside a 
conversation

With younger children, visual cues and games can be a helpful way of piecing 
things together. If you’re trying to find out who they play with at school, you 
might get them to draw a picture of their friends, say. Repeating back to a 
younger child what they have said makes them feel heard. And if you’re talking 
about difficult topics, break them down into manageable chunks.

Teenagers often respond better if you’re doing something alongside a 
conversation, so they don’t have to give you a lot of eye contact, even if it’s 
just washing up or talking when you’re in the car. Using a bit of humour can 
help to defuse the tension, and watching films with older kids can be a good 
way to broach difficult subjects.

Tips
Use visual exercises with younger children to help them explain what’s going 
on.
Respect the importance of what they’re talking about; avoid saying, “It’s just 
a silly worry.”
Model good ways of communicating with other adults. Let children see you argue 
and make up.

How to talk to… strangers, by Susan RoAne <http://www.susanroane.com>, author 
ofHow To Work A Room 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Work-Room-25th-Anniversary-Connections--/dp/0062295349/ref=la_B000AQ4S84_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447861315&sr=1-1>

Most of us find the prospect of walking into a room full of strangers 
daunting. Instead of thinking, “Who will I have to talk to tonight?” say to 
yourself, “I wonder who I’m going to get to meet tonight.”

There’s a phrase I like to use: “The roof is an introduction”, which means 
that if you’re in the same place, you always have something in common. Remember 
that most people in any room feel uncomfortable. If we can be aware of that, 
and think, “What can I do to make other people feel comfortable with me?” 
that’s not just a great strategy for socialising – it’s a kindness.

I often borrow stories. I’m not a dog person, but if someone else wants to 
talk about dogs, that’s fine. I just mention something my friend Jim told me 
about his dogs. I don’t pretend it’s my story, but just mentioning that I have 
a friend who loves dogs helps us to relate.

Remember that most people in any room feel uncomfortable

The number one question people ask me is, “How do I exit a conversation?” And 
it’s a good point: you’re not there to monopolise one person all night long. If 
the other person is getting a little squirmy, they’re ready to move on. 
Interrupt yourself, not them: “It’s been so nice talking to you. I so enjoyed 
talking about…” and there you can let them know you’ve been listening to what 
they’re saying. Then don’t just turn your back on them – it’s too abrupt. 
Instead, walk a quarter-length of the room away to another group or, better 
still, to someone standing alone.

Tips
Ask people how they know the host, or how they got there, or what they think 
of the food (just about everyone likes talking about food).
Watch out for conversation-killers, especially one-upmanship. If someone says 
they just lost 10lb, don’t tell them how you lost 20.
Borrow stories. If you don’t have children but you’re talking to a new parent, 
can you share an anecdote that a friend has told you?

How to talk to… your doctor, by Dr Ayan Panja <http://www.drayan.co.uk>, GP 
and resident doctor on BBC World News

The key thing is that you know why you’re there. Increasingly, people have 
more than one thing they want to mention at an appointment. Get the most 
important thing out at the beginning. Men are especially bad at this, as 
they’re scared. But it really doesn’t help if you get to the end of your 10 
minutes, then say, “Oh, by the way, every time I mow the lawn, I get this pain 
in my chest that goes right up to my jaw – that’s nothing to worry about, is 
it?” Actually, it could mean you’ve got angina.

I find, increasingly, that there’s a generational difference in how people 
speak to doctors. Younger people are more likely to say, “I just feel shit.” 
Try to be descriptive. If you have a pain, is it dull or sharp? Does it burn or 
throb? If you have new symptoms, make sure you mention them. The timeline is 
really important: have you been getting pains for a few days, or weeks, or at 
certain times of day? Photos help, especially if symptoms have changed.

Your doctor won’t mind if you say, 'I know I’m being stupid, but I’m worried 
this is a brain tumour'

For doctors, half the game is trying to figure out, “Why is this person really 
here?” Do they want medication, or tests? Do they want to be signed off work? 
If you are secretly worried that you have a much more serious illness, then 
mention it (we know that everyone looks up their symptoms on the internet). 
Your doctor won’t mind if you say, “I know I’m being stupid, but I’m worried 
this is a brain tumour.” We’d rather discuss that than waste time wondering 
what it is you’re not saying. Just be honest. The whole consultation is really 
about the connection between two individuals and, in an ideal world, it should 
be based on mutual respect and trust.

We live in a convenience culture, but medicine doesn’t work like that. People 
often say, “It would be great if I could just email my GP.” But if you can’t 
examine someone, you don’t have an accurate picture. We can’t always refer you 
immediately for the complicated tests you’ve seen on TV. And we can’t always 
solve everything in a 10-minute appointment.

Tips
Start with the thing you’re most worried about. Don’t make your doctor guess.
Be as detailed and descriptive as you can when explaining your symptoms.
Have an awareness that you’re talking to a human. We try to leave the emotions 
of the last appointment behind us, but it’s not always easy.

How to talk to… your date, by Dan Williams and Madeleine Mason, founders of 
PassionSmiths <http://passionsmiths.com>, a dating and relationship coaching 
service


Everyone gets nervous about dates, and everybody is worried that the other 
person won’t like them. There’s an assumption that you are on the back foot, 
and the other person holds all the power. One of the best ways of dealing with 
that is to focus on what you want. Ask yourself, “Is this person a good fit for 
me?” rather than the other way round. It helps to lessen the fear of rejection.

Pay attention to what people talk about. If your date is sharing a lot of 
negative information – talking about their acrimonious divorce, say – it might 
be their way of expressing fear of the present dating situation. The same goes 
for what you disclose. It’s nice to show a certain openness, or vulnerability, 
but not to be needy. So talking about a work conundrum could be good, but 
discussing therapy on a first date is probably a bad idea.

Silences can offer an opportunity

A lot of people are anxious about silences: there’s a fear about what’s going 
on in the other person’s head. But silences can offer an opportunity. See how 
the other person reacts. For example, you might say, “I’m feeling a bit 
nervous.” Does your date help you out and respond positively, or not? It’s 
another way of judging, “Am I having a good time?” And that’s really what it’s 
all about.

Tips
Pay attention to the negative information your date shares with you. It could 
be a sign that they’re not ready for a relationship.
Try not to focus on “Does this person like me?”; instead, ask yourself, “Do I 
like them?”
Think of your date as a team-building exercise: you’re both gathering 
information to work out whether you’ll fit well together.

How to talk to… your parents, by clinical psychologist Linda Blair

When you hit adolescence, the drive to belong to your peer group rather than 
your family kicks in. So by the time you’re a young adult, you may have spent a 
lot of time trying to get emotional distance from your parents. 
Mother-and-daughter relationships, in particular, suffer a lot, with the mother 
pushing for information and feeling marginalised. Whether you’re a grownup 
daughter or son, remember you will probably need to initiate the conversation. 
Your parents have become cautious; they don’t want to interfere with your 
independence. The best way to re-establish a relationship is to give them 
regular updates on everyday details of your life.

Your relationship with your parents is not a friendship – or, rather, it’s not 
just a friendship. It’s also a nurturing relationship. It’s becoming more 
common for children to feel in competition with their parents. Parents are more 
likely now to be as active at work and in life, and many adults today can 
expect to be poorer than their parents. All you can do is try to be tactful on 
both sides, and don’t ask too many questions that are going to make you feel 
resentful: “So when’s your next holiday, Mum?”

Your relationship with your parents is not just a friendship. It’s also a 
nurturing relationship

As parents get older, one of the most commonly expressed emotions from their 
children is irritation – irritation that their conversations seem more 
rambling, or even confused. That irritation is a cover-up for fear. No child 
wants to lose the relationship they had with their parents. And for the 
parents, who are getting towards the end of their lives, there’s an 
overwhelming need to feel as if they have lived for a reason, to make sense of 
the story of their life. It can be very therapeutic to make time for those 
stories, to share them with each other. Good conversations are really about 
good listening.

Tips
Conversations with parents tend to be one-sided. It’s easier to share details 
from your life than hear about a lot of intimate details from theirs.
Envy of parents is increasingly common, but remember it’s not their fault, and 
try not to let it cloud your relationship.
Your position in your family (whether you’re the eldest or youngest child) can 
affect the kind of conversations you have with your parents, so don’t assume 
your siblings will have the same experiences as you.

How to talk to… your boss, by David Cairncross, a director at Hays Recruitment 
<https://uk.linkedin.com/in/davidcairncross>

Most people, whether they’re the boss or the employee, want more contact. 
Employees often feel out of the loop, particularly in times of change, but they 
can be passive about giving feedback to their managers.

There’s a lot more interest now in how to “manage up”, and a lot of confusion 
about what that really means. It comes down to being able to put yourself in 
your boss’s shoes. What’s the best time to speak to your boss about important 
issues? How do they like to receive information? Does your manager have his or 
her own manager to think about? It’s about empathy.

If you want to negotiate for a pay rise or promotion, don’t spring it on your 
boss. If it comes as a shock, you’ve already set up a combative situation. The 
adversarial method is rarely effective; I know a lot of bosses who say that 
when someone threatens to leave if they don’t get what they want, they call 
them out on it. Keep it civil, and remember your boss might need to refer that 
decision to their boss, so make your business case as strong as possible. Be 
clear what both your arguments and the counterarguments are.

Your boss may be friendly, but that doesn’t mean they’re your friend

There’s an overreliance on email in most workplaces; I’d always question 
whether it’s the best way to put your point across, particularly if you need to 
deal with something problematic. It’s so easy to misconstrue what someone says 
and turn a straightforward issue into a conflict. And avoid copying people in 
halfway through an email discussion, even if you want to bolster your argument. 
It can be a very passive-aggressive way of communicating.

How much should you share with your boss about your life outside work? It 
depends on your workplace culture, but don’t presume that just because your 
boss has a relaxed management style, they’ll be less professional. As a good 
rule of thumb, avoid being too candid. Your boss may be friendly, but that 
doesn’t mean they’re your friend.

Tips
Always question whether you should send an email, or say it in person. And 
avoid passive-aggressive copying in.
Try to think from your manager’s perspective: how does what you need to say 
affect them?
Remember that your boss may not be the one making the final decision, so you 
might need to convince them to convince others.
