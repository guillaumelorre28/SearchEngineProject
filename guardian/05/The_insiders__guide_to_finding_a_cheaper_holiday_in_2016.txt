Cheap flights 

• Savvy travellers know to delete their browser history because prices can 
increase based on the number of times you re-enter a particular website, says 
Phil Bloomfield, spokesperson atCheapflights.co.uk 
<http://www.cheapflights.co.uk/>. The company’s data shows that the cheapest 
days to book are Tuesdays, generally about 50 days ahead of departure, he adds. 
“Another hack is to travel between 6pm and midnight when flights are typically 
cheaper than those early in the morning. Air fares tend to be at their most 
expensive three days before travel and Friday is consistently the most 
expensive day to fly, so if possible, try to avoid those if you can.”

• Flight systems are loaded first thing every morning so flights that were on 
hold overnight (usually from business customers) will be released. This happens 
at around 1am, so you can often get better prices the earlier in the day you 
book, says Matthew Crummack, deputy CEO ofLastminute.com 
<http://www.lastminute.com/>. And starting your long-haul holiday from another 
European city can save you lots of money. For example, take a low-cost flight 
to Sofia, Bulgaria, and you could bag a return flight to Dubai for under £150 
withWizz Air <https://wizzair.com/en-GB/Select>. The best days to fly anywhere 
are Tuesday to Thursday so you avoid the Monday morning rush of business 
travellers and also the weekend escapers.

• According to Anna Watt at Travelbag.co.uk <http://www.travelbag.co.uk/>, 
passengers on a budget should avoid direct flights. She says: “Have a stopover 
when flying long-haul. Indirect flights are often considerably cheaper, so 
consider having a day or more at your stopover destination.” She adds that it’s 
worth keeping an eye on social media for special offers.

• Zoe Cornwall at Islands of Greece <http://www.islands-of-greece.co.uk/> 
advises us to keep an eye on travel news and airline launches, as new flight 
routes will have discounts. Booking outbound and return flights with different 
airlines sometimes works out cheaper, she says.

 Grand Place in Brussels this week: there can be great weekend deals in the 
city’s business hotels. Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP 
• Denise Bartlett at Trivago.com <http://www.trivago.com/> says her company’s 
research indicates that booking hotel rooms one month in advance is the optimum 
time. Booking further in advance does not yield cheaper prices, with hotel 
rooms at their most expensive two to three months in advance. She says that 
although prices do increase closer to the travel date, they rarely reach the 
same rate as two to three months before, making last-minute booking a viable 
option. “We also looked at discrepancies between countries,” she adds. “In 
general, hotels in Spain should be booked the furthest in advance (up to seven 
weeks before the travel date), followed by Italy, the UK, Germany and finally 
France, where hotels can be booked just two weeks in advance for the best 
prices.”

• Book a weekend break in a city’s business district, says Matthew Crummack at 
Lastminute.com <http://www.lastminute.com/>. Cities that are popular for 
business travellers, such as London, Brussels and Zurich, have fantastic room 
rates at the weekend once the suits have left. You can sometimes find rooms at 
five-star hotels for under £100 a night. Sunday nights are usually the cheapest 
night of the week to stay in a city hotel. You’re also more likely to bag an 
upgrade to a suite when the hotel is quieter on a Sunday, he adds. Christmas 
and New Year is a particularly quiet period for corporate hotels. The last two 
weeks in December (excluding New Year’s Eve) and first two weeks in January are 
usually the least busy.

Check in as late as possible – there is more chance that the hotel will have 
run out of standard rooms and will give you a higher room category.

• Bob Atkinson of Travelsupermarket.com <https://www.travelsupermarket.com/> 
says hotels often have non-refundable early-booking deals, often via comparison 
and booking websites, which can save a lot of money, especially in the USA.

• New hotels will book rooms for up to 50% cheaper than they will for 
following years, says Zoe Cornwall ofIslands of Greece 
<http://www.islands-of-greece.co.uk/>.

• For the best deals on accommodation, book direct, advises Malcolm Bell, 
chief executive ofVisit Cornwall <https://www.visitcornwall.com/>: “Many 
hotels, B&Bs and cottages offer guests an incentive to book direct rather than 
through a booking engine or agency. You could be rewarded with a discount, room 
upgrade or complimentary extra. For example, those who book direct with the
Fistral Beach Hotel and Spa <https://www.fistralbeachhotel.co.uk/> in Newquay, 
are offered a free cocktail.”

• Maymie White and Victoria Hooberman, co-founders of accommodation provider 
Scott Williams <http://www.scottwilliams.co.uk/>, say holidaymakers should 
always ask for under-occupancy deals when making a villa booking outside of the 
school holidays. Often villa owners and operators will be happy to offer larger 
properties at discounted rates if the party is much smaller than capacity. 
White adds: “This sometimes means that for not much more than you could hire a 
smaller property, you can indulge in a much bigger, lavish, party pad.”

• Yvonne Bonanati from HomeAway.co.uk <https://www.homeaway.co.uk/> says: “Our 
data, taken over the past few years, has identified that the first Monday in 
January, this year the 4th, has consistently been the busiest day for UK 
travellers to book their next holiday. We are predicting the same pattern this 
year, and expect that thousands of UK travellers will be going online to secure 
their next getaway that day.”

 Pick your summer holidays week carefully for the cheapest deals. Photograph: 
Gregg Vignal/Alamy 
• Sign up to email newsletters from your favourite travel brands, says 
Travelsupermarket.com <https://www.travelsupermarket.com/>’s Bob Atkinson, 
because these will let you know when there are special offers, additional 
discounts, seat sales and other offers. Late or early summer packages are 
cheapest, often 50% of school holiday prices. He warns: “Don’t travel in the 
first weeks of the school summer holidays – they are the busiest and most 
expensive.”

• Derek Moore, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators 
<https://www.aito.com/>, says: “Take full advantage of early booking offers – 
the ones that say ‘Book by 29 February’, for example. You may save a couple of 
hundred pounds by so doing – and all you need to commit to is the deposit, with 
final balances due usually only 10-12 weeks before you travel.”

 The low cost of eating out in Spain makes a big difference to the overall 
holiday cost. Photograph: Alamy 
• The cost of eating out, shopping and activities make a big difference to how 
much you spend on a holiday overall, so consider exchange rates and the cost of 
key items such as food and drink. Bob Atkinson atTravelSupermarket 
<https://www.travelsupermarket.com/> says the best mainstream destinations for 
low costs are Spain, Portugal and Bulgaria for beach holidays, and the former 
eastern bloc for city breaks, such as Krakow, Prague and Budapest.

• Right now, Eurozone winter sun resorts Cyprus and Lanzarote offer the best 
value, saysPost Office Travel Money <http://www.postoffice.co.uk/travel-money>
’s Andrew Brown. Further afield, Cancún and Orlando are the cheapest long-haul 
beach resorts. He adds: “The strength of sterling against currencies for 
long-haul destinations such as Mexico, Malaysia and Mauritius makes them 
appealing.”

• In the past 12 months, the pound has strengthened most against the Argentina 
peso (by 44.2%), the Brazilian real (37.7%), Colmbian peso (26.5%), South 
African rand (25.9%), Russian rouble (23.5%), Turkish lira (19.1%) and Canadian 
dollar (14.2%), said Simon Philips ofNo. 1 Currency 
<https://www.no1currency.com/>, an exchange service 
<https://www.no1currency.com/home-delivery/>. It was also up against the New 
Zealand and Australian dollars, the euro (5.6%) and the Thai baht, but down 
against the dollar (4.8%).

• Jeff Paterson, co-founder of Fourex <http://www.fourex.co.uk/>, says the 
average UK household has £110.45 in unused foreign currency lying around at 
home, so have a rummage and use it!

• Change your pounds in a bank in the country you are visiting, as you could 
get a better exchange rate, says Lastminute.com’s Matthew Crummack. Also, 
consider using your debit card to pay for things abroad because you’ll get the 
exact currency rates of the day (not a rate that has fees and commission on 
top). But do check for any fees your bank might charge for this, to make sure 
it is cost effective.

 Outside of peak season, solo travellers can enjoy reduced price or no single 
supplements. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images 
• “Look for single supplement offers – many package companies offer 
reduced-price or zero-cost single supplements outside of peak travel season,” 
says TravelSupermarket’s Bob Atkinson. “Or try specialist companies for solo 
travellers (Solos Holidays <http://www.solosholidays.co.uk/>, Just You 
<https://www.justyou.co.uk/>) which omit singles’ supplements.”

Tour companies such as Exodus <http://www.exodus.co.uk/> and Explore 
<https://www.explore.co.uk/> offer adventure-style trips specifically aimed at 
single travellers, so you don’t feel like the gooseberry on a couples’ road 
trip. This also means you can opt to share a room and cut the cost of your 
holiday.

Be wary of booking a single room – it is often a false economy. You’ll often 
get a small room with a single bed and no view. If your hotel is important to 
you, pay for a double room and have a better stay.

 Catered chalets can be more cost effective than eating out. Photograph: Alamy 
• Oliver Bailey, managing director of Chalet Finder 
<http://www.chaletfinder.co.uk>, says: “Staying in a catered chalet may be more 
cost-effective than eating out, depending on the resort. Research average menu 
prices online. Unless there’s a large group of you, a shared chalet (with 
strangers) will be cheaper. You’re not just sharing a chalet, you’re also 
sharing the costs for the operator, which will give you a better price over 
sole occupancy. Book lift passes through your chalet operator, as it will have 
more flexibility over prices, and will sometimes throw them into the package. 
Otherwise, try to book through the resort’s tourist office ahead of the season; 
there are usually pre-season offers to take advantage of.

“Share transfers. Book with a transfer operator that looks to fill its 
vehicles; this is much cheaper than a private transfer. Or if there are four of 
you, hiring a car may be cheaper.”

• For flights, shop around, be flexible on dates and times, and book early. An 
absolute must is using comparison sites such asKayak <https://www.kayak.co.uk/>,

TheTripAdvisor Flight Finder <http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/CheapFlightsHome> 
scours hundreds of sites to find the best deals and also shows how you can save 
money by choosing alternative dates and nearby airports. Setting up an Air 
Watch alert ensures you’ll be messaged when flights you’ve got your eye on go 
down in price. It also lists cheapest last-minute flights.Flycheapo.com 
<http://www.flycheapo.com> lists most budget airlines that fly between all 
European airports.

• For hotel deals, Hotels.com <http://uk.hotels.com/>, Booking.com 
<http://www.booking.com/> and Hoteltonight.com

good for last-minute breaks. For lower-cost boutiques, tryDorisanddicky.com
