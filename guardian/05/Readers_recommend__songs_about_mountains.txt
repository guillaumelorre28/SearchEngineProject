“Plastic surgeons are always making mountains out of molehills,” said Dolly 
Parton, flashing that ever radiant smile, and cleverly refreshing both a cliche 
and a metaphor. And reminding us mountains are usually twinned with deep 
valleys. Yet, hailing from Tennessee, and regularly retreating to a remote 
mountain cabin to inspire creativity, Parton’s talent for songwriting has often 
been overlooked – “not many people knew I came out of the smoky mountains with 
a load of songs”. But her admirers come from all quarters. Queen Latifah said: 
“Let’s be clear.Dolly Parton <https://www.theguardian.com/music/dolly-parton> 
is a rapper. Somewhere before all the country. I don’t know what happens up 
there in the mountains when you’re growing up, but she has been spitting rhymes 
for a long time.”

Mountains – they’re not only inspirational, but the source and illustration of 
many a high and low. “Great things are done when men and mountains meet,” said
William Blake <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/william-blake>, but was he 
foreseeing the triumph of Hillary and Tenzing on Everest or more architectural 
achievements? But first to get you in the mood, let’s take in a taste of the 
music of the Appalachian Mountains, with a style that became bluegrass, and 
here featuring some damn fine playing from “Fiddler John” and friends. As 
film-maker Ethan Coen put it: “Mountain music... is compelling music in its own 
right, harking back to a time when music was a part of everyday life and not 
something performed by celebrities.”

 Mountain music. The hills of North Carolina ‘64 
Your song choices may be inspired by titles, lyrics, or settings and of course 
hail from actual mountain territory, right across the US and Canada, down to 
Mexico, the Andes and beyond to all parts of the world, from the Alps to the 
Himalayas, the Matterhorn to Kilimanjaro, K2 to Fuji, Tai to Table. Many are 
awe-inspiringly beautiful, but can also bring fear and even death. They are a 
challenge, not only for the body, but also the mind. “It isn’t the mountains 
ahead to climb that wear you out; it’s the pebble in your shoe,” said Muhammed 
Ali, philosophically, and showing a rare moment of humility. Even more 
famously, “I’ve been to the mountain top,” rang out in the greatest speech of 
the great Martin Luther King, from which he saw a promised land of civil 
rights, a vision of a better future, far away, one where, he admitted, he may 
not get there himself, but the view was beautiful.


Mountains are daunting, but even as an idea they are also inspirational. The 
song Ain’t No Mountain High Enough inspired a whole song style movement. 
Written by Valerie Ashford and Nickolas Simpson, the latter said how the song 
was “the golden egg that landed us at Motown”. Diana Ross, whose version was a 
massive hit, could not help but remark: “If I have someone who believes in me, 
I can move mountains.”Mountains 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/mountains> also give the mind 
discipline, focus and achievement. That inspirational speaker and rapper Chuck 
D described how “being positive is like going up a mountain. Being negative is 
like sliding down a hill. A lot of times, people want to take the easy way out, 
because it’s basically what they’ve understood throughout their lives.”

 Ain’t No Mountain ... which version might you like to climb? 
One interesting seam, or patterned theme, running through many mountain songs 
is how they are themselves often described. Why are they so often magical, 
misty, mystical, candy, rocky or black? What does this say about us? Are they 
really, as Nathaniel Hawthorne described, “Earth’s undecaying monuments”, or 
something far more mysterious and mystical, a symbol of something dark within 
the soul, whether that be Tolkein’s Mountains of Mordor inLord of the Rings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/lord-of-the-rings> or the real-life darkness 
and almost certain death faced in Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes by Joe 
Simpson after falling down a crevass, captured in Touching the Void. What worse 
fate, as I’ve mentioned before in the larger subject of wilderness, than having 
Brown Girl in the Ring going round and round, and round, your head? Frightening 
indeed.

 Mountains of Boney M ... 
Alejandro Jodorowsky’s 1973 film The Holy Mountain 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071615/>, with its lavish, almost unhinged 
production funded by John Lennon, is one of the oddest, most confusing, yet 
incredible visual treats in all cinema. George Harrison, according to the 
director, was keen to play a role “as the thief”. But what is it about? Have a 
quick look, but be warned that you may find some scenes disturbing.

 Holy Mountain (1973) trailer. WARNING. Some may find scenes disturbing. 
Cinema is awash with more conventional mountain-based disaster movies, from 
2015’s spectacular but flawedEverest <https://www.theguardian.com/film/everest> 
about a fatal expedition, to the perhaps more compellingAlive 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive_%281993_film%29>, about the 1972 Andes 
flight disaster of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, in which 45 passengers were 
forced to turn to cannibalism to survive in the mountains. Ang Lee’s Brokeback 
Mountain (2005), about two men who find love for each other, used a beautiful 
backdrop to put a whole new perspective on a well-established genre. As one of 
its stars, Jake Gyllenhaal said: “It takes all your conceptions of America, and 
the western, and cowboys, and sexuality, and love, and it stirs them all up.”

And then, on an entirely different range, there was Sylvester Stallone in 
Cliffhanger. Perhaps this may be best summed up with the actor’s own phrase: “I 
always like a new challenge. There are a lot of mountains to climb out there. 
When I run out of mountains, I’ll build a new one.” Deep. If we’re not already 
digging holes for ourselves ...


I’ll end with something that seems to be inspired by mountains, but probably 
has absolutely nothing to do with them at all. Geoff Love and his Orchestra 
served up a bottomless chasm of easy listening numbers, but in the 1950s Love 
was also behind the more Latin-inspired project Manuel & the Music of the 
Mountains. Take a gentle stroll and see where it takes you:
