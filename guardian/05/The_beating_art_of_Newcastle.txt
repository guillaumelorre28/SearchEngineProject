Ouseburn was, until 10 years ago, a monument to an industrial past, its 
derelict factories, red-brick warehouses and mills lurking in the shadow of 
Victorian bridges and viaducts less than a mile from Newcastle city centre. 
Now, this picturesque valley, either side of the river Ouse (once used to carry 
coal by boat from Spital Tongues down to waiting barges on the Tyne), is the 
creative heart of Newcastle.

Following years of post-industrial decline, its regeneration, kick-started by 
community-driven enterprise rather than corporate business (the Ouseburn Trust 
in partnership with the local authority), has given the area's unique 
architecture and riverside setting a new lease of life – in the form of 
artists' studios, live music venues, an independent cinema and galleries. 
Here's a quick tour to get you started.

1. Cumberland Arms

Not just the best pub in Ouseburn, but arguably the finest in Newcastle 
itself. Built in 1836 (owner Jo will show you the hatch where women, refused 
entrance to the main bar, used to be served), it's boozer heaven: 
wood-panelled, roaring fire, simple furniture, leaded windows, a smattering of 
salvaged art, and shelves heaving with paperbacks. Session ale is the "Rapper", 
named after the Northumberland sword dance, and there are six guests, as well 
as 12 types of cider. An upstairs room plays host to music, theatre and comedy. 
Its isolated position overlooking the valley means stunning views not only from 
its terrace, but also the windows of its four spacious, very comfortable 
bedrooms.

breakfast.

2. Star & Shadow Cinema
 Star and Shadow independent cinema, Newcastle 
A converted former prop department for Tyne Tees Television, this tiny cinema 
is run by volunteers, from film programming and projecting, to gigs and 
promotion. Every year there is a charmingly named "Building Festival" where 
volunteers come and help build, improve and restore. One Sunday a month there 
is a "Make & Mend" arts, crafts and flea market. Meetings every Monday at 6pm, 
films every Thursday and Sunday, and gigs, films, club nights and art events 
programmed on Weds, Fri and Sat.

3. Biscuit Factory 
 Biscuit Factory, Newcastle 
Britain's biggest commercial art gallery is a whopping 35,000 square feet over 
two floors of exhibition spaces and artists' studios. Paintings, drawings 
prints, ceramics, and jewellery including artists such as Emma Tooth (whose
Concilium Plebis <http://www.emmatooth.co.uk/Concilium-Plebis/index.html>are 
Caravaggio-style portraits of those dismissed as "chavs and hoodies"), and 
Maria Rivan's stunning 3D collages. My tip is to refresh yourself at the café, 
which groans with inviting home-made sandwiches and cakes, while contemplating 
the industrial views over the Byker Wall (see below), rather than at the 
blandly-furnished, expensive restaurant.

4. The Cluny

A former whisky bottling plant a stottie 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stottie_cake>'s throw from Byker Bridge, The 
Cluny is owned by iconic party boozer theHead Of Steam 
<http://www.headofsteam.co.uk> (worth a visit, opposite Newcastle Central 
Station). As well as a live venue, which showcases both young Geordie bands and 
international artists, the simple main bar and lounge (runner-up in the 
Observer Food Monthly's awards 2006 for best quick eat in north-east) offers 
local ales and informal yet hearty snacks, such as good quality house salads 
(£6), home-made burgers (£6) and Sunday roasts (£7).

5. Seven Stories

The first museum in the UK dedicated to the art of British children's books 
protects the heritage of British classics for families and curious adults 
alike. Temporary exhibitions at the former flour mill (such as the current 
retrospective for Tiger Who Came To Tea author Judith Kerr, which runs until 
May 2010) complement the permanent collection, whose earliest acquisition was 
Puffin Books editor (and Puffin Club founder) Kaye Webb's archive.Philip Pullman
 <http://www.philip-pullman.com/> is a great supporter and has given work from 
the His Dark Materials trilogy and the Sally Lockhart quartet. The huge 
bookshop is free to enter, as is one of the best cafes in Ouseburn, which 
offers sleepy views over the Ouse – and great mugs of coffee.

• 30 Lime Street, + 44 (0)845 271 0777, sevenstories.org.ukpen 
<http://www.sevenstories.org.ukpen> Mon-Sat 10-5pm, £5.50 adults £4.50 children

6. Mushroom Works

The scream of gulls and clink and hammer of the docks fill the air outside 
this hard-to-find gallery, originally a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, in an area 
once known as the "Mushroom". Opened in 2004 by furniture-maker Nick James, 
there are 12 studios, including painters, illustrators, jewellery makers, 
animators, architects, and glass artists. They host eight exhibitions a year, 
and the shop, with its emphasis on affordability, currently stocks work by 32 
artists. The Stairwell Gallery has just opened upstairs, given over to 
exhibitions by other artists. A 50% off "studio sale" runs from Jan 9-Feb 6.

7. Northern Print
 Northern Print Gallery, Newcastle 
Northern Print began life in 1994 on Fish Quay, North Shields, and moved in 
2006 to a former pottery in Ouseburn. Now a gallery and contemporary 
print-making studio offering affordable prints as well as classes, it's worth 
also spending a penny in ceramic artist Paul Scott's impressive tiled toilet. 
Also, don't miss the large screen-prints decorating the sides of the offices 
opposite.

8. Byker Wall

Set between the roar of the flyover and silence of the river, the Grade 
II-listedByker Wall <http://tinyurl.com/ydemord>, a 1970s primary-coloured 
brick, wood and plastic-built unbroken block of 620 maisonettes, was placed on 
UNESCO's list of outstanding 20th-century buildings. Designed by Ralph Erskine 
in Functionalist Romantic style, the low-rise construction represented a break 
with the high-rise architectural orthodoxy of the time. Its iconic, triangular 
Tom Collins House is visible from miles around.

9. Victoria Tunnel

Testament to the achievement of Victorian labour, this two-mile tunnel was 
built in 1838 for transporting coal from Spital Tongues colliery on the Town 
Moor to the river Tyne, and in the second world war converted to an air-raid 
shelter. A short section, with its last remaining accessible entrance on Ouse 
Street (behind the Hotel Du Vin, see below) re-opened in 2008 to give visitors 
and locals an experience deep below the city.

10. Hotel Du Vin
 Hotel Du Vin, Newcastle 
The first hotel in Ouseburn opened in 2008 in the former headquarters of the 
Tyne Tees Steam Shipping Company, which once served as the company's 
maintenance depot and storeroom. As such, a nautical theme pervades the 42 
rooms, many of which have outstanding views over the Tyne Bridge. Its glass and 
brick bistro is the most glamorous evening eating option in Ouseburn, even if 
you're not a resident (great value too with two-course menus boasting 
locally-sourced ingredients from £15.50).

• Allan House, City Road, +44 (0)191 229 2200, hotelduvin.com/newcastle 
<http://www.hotelduvin.com/newcastle/>. Standard rooms from £160. On Sunday 
nights, spend £75 in the bistro and room is only £25 if you book online.
