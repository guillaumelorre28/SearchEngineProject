Next week, the contestants go fully Wonka with a confectionery challenge. My

“It’s not how hard you hit, it’s how hard you can get hit,” grins Karthik in 
the people carrier home. What does that even mean? He wants us to hit him? I 
think there’d be a queue the length of the Millennium Bridge, dude. Don’t 
advertise that fact.

As is traditional, Sugar hovers some more, like a drone which may or may not 
deploy a stink bomb. But ultimately, he relents and everyone else gets to go 
back to the house.

Natalie is sanguine, whoever she is. Good on her.

Natalie is fired. Goodbye, Scotland’s rose. We never knew you at all. 
Literally, we saw nothing of you because the editor clearly didn’t see any 
point.

Karthik sees a gap and tries to fill it with bluster and human barking. Alana 
gets wobbly and weepy. Natalie has another go at saying almost nothing. Alana 
has another crack and can’t speak. She literally can’t speak.

Natalie doesn’t seem at all like an Apprentice candidate. I mean that as a 
compliment. She has so little to say for herself, it’s like she’s running on 
half power.

Alana says the posters were her idea. Silence. Natalie had a face like a 
licked stamp. She flounders as she tries to justify her contribution. She did 
the make-up but Alan probably already has his own make-up artist.

When Sugar’s beam turns on the boys, Mukai slams Karthik and the eyebrows

nightmare to work with. I can’t see Alan going for it, long term.

Jessica takes the floor at the Bridge Cafe and starts going off like a market 
barker. The team roll their eyes. They all blame her and she blames all of 
them. She secretly looks like a girl getting bullied by horrible fellow 
sixth-formers and I kind of feel for her. People aren’t nice onThe Apprentice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>, Jessica. These are not

Thank you so much for joining the fun and not leaving me alone with these 
despots. Come back next week for Sugar on sugar. It’ll be sweet(s). See you in 
the comments!
 
Next week, the contestants go fully Wonka with a confectionery challenge. My 
gums hurt just thinking about it.
 
“It’s not how hard you hit, it’s how hard you can get hit,” grins Karthik in 
the people carrier home. What does that even mean? He wants us to hit him? I 
think there’d be a queue the length of the Millennium Bridge, dude. Don’t 
advertise that fact.
 
As is traditional, Sugar hovers some more, like a drone which may or may not 
deploy a stink bomb. But ultimately, he relents and everyone else gets to go 
back to the house.

Natalie is sanguine, whoever she is. Good on her.
 
Natalie is fired. Goodbye, Scotland’s rose. We never knew you at all. 
Literally, we saw nothing of you because the editor clearly didn’t see any 
point.
 
Karthik is silenced, several times but it’s a dummy, I think. He won’t fire 
him.
 
JD is given a free pass. Everyone else clenches.
 
This bunch are actually losing the plot in episode two. This is not good.
 
Karthik sees a gap and tries to fill it with bluster and human barking. Alana 
gets wobbly and weepy. Natalie has another go at saying almost nothing. Alana 
has another crack and can’t speak. She literally can’t speak.
 
Natalie doesn’t seem at all like an Apprentice candidate. I mean that as a 
compliment. She has so little to say for herself, it’s like she’s running on 
half power.
 
Alana says the posters were her idea. Silence. Natalie had a face like a 
licked stamp. She flounders as she tries to justify her contribution. She did 
the make-up but Alan probably already has his own make-up artist.
 
“Ooh, I’ve lost me train of thought,” says Jessica, flustered again as she 
fights for her right to become a Yellow Coat. Is anyone else getting Peggy 
Ollerenshaw from Hi-De-Hi?
 
When Sugar’s beam turns on the boys, Mukai slams Karthik and the eyebrows 
attempts a fight back. It’s not great for the lad. He’s fiery and furious and a 
nightmare to work with. I can’t see Alan going for it, long term.
 
Imagine if that was your claim to fame. “I was fired in episode two of The 
Apprentice <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/apprentice>.” “Oh, were 
you? Sorry, I asked for a flat white. This is latte.” The shame.
 
Jessica is bringing back Natalie and Alana.

That leaves eleven of you, says Alan. Jeez, that still sounds like a lot. Who 
will escape the jaws of doom and do we know any of them enough to care?
 
Mukai is bringing back JD and Karthik. Who is JD?
