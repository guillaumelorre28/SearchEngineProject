What can you tell us about the Christmas special?

It’s got a returning monster. It’s got Matt Lucas. It’s a sort of tribute to 
the Christopher Reeve’s Superman movies. It has the Doctor in an adventure with 
a superhero in New York. What more could you want for Christmas?

What was it like working with Matt Lucas again?

A great pleasure. He’s an absolutely delightful man; I loved working with him 
and he’s a great talent to have around. He’s sort of a developing character, so 
it’s different from the way it was in The Husbands Of River Song, and that’s 
very interesting to watch and see happening.

He’s not the young action hero playing opposite the older Doctor, then?

He can be quite action-packed. I’m not quite at the William Hartnell stage 
[the first Doctor, who, like Capaldi, played the role while in his late 50s]. I 
can still run around and chase after a Zygon when called upon to. It’s an 
action-packed show so we do have a lot of stuff to do. We both just have a more 
peculiar gait as we do it.

Are you yourself a fan of superhero movies?

No, I don’t really see that many. There seem to be so many that I can’t keep 
track, aren’t there hundreds of them? I wish they would start making films of 
The Beano and The Dandy, that might be easier for me.

First look at the Doctor Who Christmas special 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/dec/09/doctor-who-christmas-special-2016-trailer-video>
Who do you think the Doctor’s favourite superhero would be?

He’d be a bit uptight about Doctor Strange. I think he’d be a little bit like: 
“Bitch stole my look.” I think he would like Wonder Woman, because Lynda Carter 
is so funny. And I think he’d like Adam West’s Batman. He’d find Adam West 
great company.

You don’t film the episode in December. Do you have a trick for getting in the 
Christmas mood?

You don’t have to do that. The curious thing is that it begins to work on you. 
If you are doing scenes in snow or with tinsel, it obviously triggers 
something. I immediately begin to get anxious about the presents that I haven’t 
bought. I feel Christmassy in a kind of “Oh no I haven’t done all the things I 
should have done” kind of a way.

If little kids watch Doctor Who on Christmas Day, will there be tears? Or 
might it be too scary?

There’s always a few tears with Doctor Who. But I think they’ll have more 
laughs. And lots of thrills. I think it has to be a little bit scary. The 
amazing thing aboutDoctor Who 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who> is the constituency of 
the audience: the age range that goes from tiny little kids to middle-aged men 
who should know better. You’ve got to entertain all of them. The Christmas 
special does that effectively – but being scary is part of that.

experience!'

What can we expect from the new series of Doctor Who?

It’s got the Doctor in it. And the Tardis flying through time and space. It’s 
got corridors, which we run down, with nasty surprises at the end of them. We’ve
got all kinds of things: we’ve got Romans, we’ve got robots, we’ve got 
serpents.

Do you feel your portrayal of the Doctor has shifted over the three series 
you’ve made?

The danger of Doctor Who is that it becomes bland, that the character has to 
tick boxes, so I try to keep dragging him away from those boxes. The thing is 
he changes all the time. I think there was a definite move last season to sort 
of brighten him up. We had to, I think, to break from Matt Smith, who is 
wonderful and I love, we had to make the Doctor a little more difficult to 
grasp. Make him not as audience-friendly, as it were. Which, you know, I’m 
pretty good at.

But it’s more complicated than that. He has to balance all of those things. 
You have to be able to play to the 7 year old watching, and to the 42 year old. 
So sometimes you have to be more comic perhaps than you normally would be 
comfortable with. But it’s important, because really it’s a children’s show 
that developed into something more complex, a bit more adult-orientated, but we 
have a duty to entertain the children to whom it was aimed in the first place.

What would your Doctor want Father Christmas to leave him in his stocking?

A fuzz pedal for his guitar. No. A wah-wah pedal. I think he’s been trying to 
make one for some time, because the Doctor would always rather make his own, 
but I think the technology of the wah-wah pedal has been eluding him.
