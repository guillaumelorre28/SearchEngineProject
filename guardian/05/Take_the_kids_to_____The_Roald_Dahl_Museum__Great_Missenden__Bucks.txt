In a nutshell 
In a pretty house on the high street, near where Dahl lived for 36 years – 
just past the vintage Shell petrol pumps that appeared in Danny the Champion of 
the World – three rooms explore both his life and the writing process, with 
children encouraged to think about ideas, words and how stories are created. If 
that sounds rather worthy, it’s not. Interactive exhibits – a dressing up box, 
making up nonsense words, sitting in his (replica) writing chair, finding out 
how tall you are compared to favourite characters – are fun and playful. As it 
says on the house facade: “It is truly swizzfiggingly flushbunkingly 
gloriumptious.”

Fun fact 
Roald Dahl ate a chocolate bar every day. He would screw up the foil wrapper 
and add it to a growing ball, now on display on his writing desk.

Best thing about it
According to my five-year old son ‘everything’. Storytelling sessions (free) 
and workshops (£3-£4, book ahead) give kids a chance to get involved and get 
messy. There will be James and the Giant Peach activities every day this 
half-term, including stories with Sandra Agard.

What about lunch 
Cafe Twit sells jacket potatoes (from £3.20), soup (from £3.80), panini (from 
£3.40). After all that talk of chocolate we couldn’t resist the Bogtrotter cake 
loaded with smarties, marshmallows and maltesers (£2.50).

Exit through the gift shop 
You enter through it, but I was happy to linger, stocking up on kids’ birthday 
presents. Remarkably, given how they could have gone to town with Willy 
Wonka-inspired treats, there’s not a sweet in sight.

Getting there 
It’s a five-minute walk from Great Missenden station (40 minutes from London’s 
Marylebone station).

Value for money 
Absolutely. We spent three hours there and my son loved it. Afterwards we 
walked up to St Peter and St Paul’s church to visit Dahl’s grave, where he 
yelled: “You might not hear me but thanks for all the stories,Roald Dahl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl>.” Adult £6.60, child £4.40, 
families £21.
