Steven Spielberg's movie house DreamWorks SKG is locked in a row with video 
giant Blockbuster over distribution of the Oscar-winning American Beauty  
<http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Film_Page/0,4061,104202,00.html>. Blockbuster 
is reported to have demanded a bigger-than-usual cut of the rental revenues 
from the black comedy. When DreamWorks resisted the shop's efforts, Blockbuster 
exercised its right to undersell American Beauty in its outlets nationwide.

According to Blockbuster spokesperson Liz Greene, "we were not able to reach a 
satisfactory agreement to secure the number of copies which Blockbuster is
typically known for." In other words, the United States' largest video chain
opted not to buy the hundreds of thousands of extra copies of American
Beauty that would make it a "guaranteed title" on its release on May 9.
Blockbuster also banished the Sam Mendes-directed film to behind the counter: 
would-be renters now have to specifically request the title.

The row has had an immediate impact on American Beauty's sales: the figures 
for its first week of release were eclipsed by those for Fight
Club  <http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Film_Page/0,4061,63628,00.html>, a far 
less popular movie at the cinema. DreamWorks are playing down the spat, 
averring that "we have a great relationship with Blockbuster," before adding 
"it's just that if you want to rent it at Blockbuster, you might have to ask 
them for it."
