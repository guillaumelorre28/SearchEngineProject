Next week, those five rare creatures will butt antlers like never before as 
they compete to reach the final of this silly programme. We should probably 
watch right?

Join me here next week for that and see you in the comments!

Grainne and Frances are sent back to the house while Trish and her pastel 
accessories board the cab of ennui out of town.

Back at the house, Jess, Courtney, Alanna, Grainne and Frances clink glasses 
and delight in the idea that they’re winners, much in the way Donald Trump is 
doing right now, still struggling to believe that he gets to rule the world in 
a minute.

“OK, ladies...” says Alan sounding like David Cameron that time.

He begins his tension build-up by pointing out why all of them should go, one 
by one, before actually throwing the ball and sacking one of them. I’d sack 
Trishna.

Oh! He sacked Trishna.

I think Grainne is going to get the ultimate heat here because she became 
quite hands off when she’d delegated the jobs. Her only defence is that Trishna 
was a bit frowny. And Frances adds that it was her idea to make the gin a 
horrible colour.

Frances is immediately targeted because the stats say she’s mostly on the 
losing team. But she won when she PM-ed. The problem with having three loose 
cannons on one teams is that they all see themselves as solo artists. You try 
and wrangle three Robbie Williamses, all focusing on their solo careers. It 
won’t end well.

Trishna says she doesn’t know about gin. “You drank enough of it,” Exocets 
Karrren with a look of pure venom. Trishna tries to imply that Grainne is at 
fault. Alan and co identify her propensity to wildly blame everyone else.

Back in the boardroom, Alan waves around the bottle of Colony Tramp’s Widdle. 
Frances owns her lack of geographical knowledge and he puts the boot in about 
her bottle design. Which, let’s face it, is not the weakest bit of this whole 
gig.

Grainne has to accept that the only pitch she didn’t lead, won them business.

And still we come back to the fact that no one who buys gin, wants it to be a 
funny colour. No one.

Of the three of them, Trishna’s eyes are the most panic-stricken. Just on the 
scent of fear alone, I think she’s a gonner.

Claud berates Courtney over his dullsville pitch. Could this actually be the 
first all-female Apprentice final? In a way that culturally balances out Hilary 
Clinton? That might be cool.

When Courtney tries to justify the Giiiiiin concept, Alan replies with what I 
assume his tonight’s zinger. “What do you drink it with? Tunic?”he says, barely 
committing to the zinger at all. It’s like his heart isn’t in it anymore.

Next week, those five rare creatures will butt antlers like never before as 
they compete to reach the final of this silly programme. We should probably 
watch right?

Join me here next week for that and see you in the comments!
 
Grainne and Frances are sent back to the house while Trish and her pastel 
accessories board the cab of ennui out of town.

Back at the house, Jess, Courtney, Alanna, Grainne and Frances clink glasses 
and delight in the idea that they’re winners, much in the way Donald Trump is 
doing right now, still struggling to believe that he gets to rule the world in 
a minute.
 
“OK, ladies...” says Alan sounding like David Cameron that time.

He begins his tension build-up by pointing out why all of them should go, one 
by one, before actually throwing the ball and sacking one of them. I’d sack 
Trishna.

Oh! He sacked Trishna.
 
I think Grainne is going to get the ultimate heat here because she became 
quite hands off when she’d delegated the jobs. Her only defence is that Trishna 
was a bit frowny. And Frances adds that it was her idea to make the gin a 
horrible colour.
 
Frances is immediately targeted because the stats say she’s mostly on the 
losing team. But she won when she PM-ed. The problem with having three loose 
cannons on one teams is that they all see themselves as solo artists. You try 
and wrangle three Robbie Williamses, all focusing on their solo careers. It 
won’t end well.
 
Claud and Karrren whisper in Alan’s ears while he nods reasonably.

And they’re back in the room. Who would you fire right now?
 
None of this matters now, because one of these people is about to get launched 
into space/ the taxi rank.
 
Trishna says she doesn’t know about gin. “You drank enough of it,” Exocets 
Karrren with a look of pure venom. Trishna tries to imply that Grainne is at 
fault. Alan and co identify her propensity to wildly blame everyone else.
 
Back in the boardroom, Alan waves around the bottle of Colony Tramp’s Widdle. 
Frances owns her lack of geographical knowledge and he puts the boot in about 
her bottle design. Which, let’s face it, is not the weakest bit of this whole 
gig.

Grainne has to accept that the only pitch she didn’t lead, won them business.

And still we come back to the fact that no one who buys gin, wants it to be a 
funny colour. No one.
 
Of the three of them, Trishna’s eyes are the most panic-stricken. Just on the 
scent of fear alone, I think she’s a gonner.
 
Trishna throws wild interference at Grainne but whoever goes tonight it 
mustn’t be Frances.
 
I feel bad for Frances. Her branding, with a less Irn Bru-ey drink, would have 
worked well.
 
£20,400 for Giiiiin from the supermarkets. £51,000 from the bar chains.

£5280 for Colony. Nothing from the bar chains. The winners are going on a 
helicopter. The losers, aren’t.
 
Claud berates Courtney over his dullsville pitch. Could this actually be the 
first all-female Apprentice final? In a way that culturally balances out Hilary 
Clinton? That might be cool.
 
When Courtney tries to justify the Giiiiiin concept, Alan replies with what I 
assume his tonight’s zinger. “What do you drink it with? Tunic?”he says, barely 
committing to the zinger at all. It’s like his heart isn’t in it anymore.
 
Grainne goes in hard on Frances and says she was “very undermining” if we’re 
in any doubt about who Grainne wants to kill and bury under a motorway.
 
Frances tries to justify the branding and Karrren sympathises about her being 
left high and dry thanks to her drunk team mates.

part of the task. She’s onThe Apprentice
