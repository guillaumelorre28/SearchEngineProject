One of the largest earthquakes to hit Britain for almost a decade was felt off 
the coast of North Yorkshire on Tuesday night – but most residents appear not 
to have noticed.

The magnitude-3.8 tremor happened in the North Sea almost 100 miles east of 
Scarborough at 6.50pm, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said.




Bemused residents expressed surprise that there had been an earthquake.

The North Sea tremor had a depth of 11 miles and struck 93 miles off the 
Scarborough coast – but appears not to have caused any damage to buildings on 
the mainland.



The news prompted residents and Twitter users to poke a little gentle fun at 
the Yorkshire seaside town, famed for its sandy beach, medieval castle and 
plethora of arcades.

And the folks at entertainment venue Scarborough Spa 
<http://www.scarboroughspa.co.uk/> allayed any fears of mass devastation on the 
Yorkshire coast when it tweeted on Wednesday morning:

When asked whether anyone at the venue felt the quake, the Scarborough Spa 
added:

@JoshHalliday <https://twitter.com/JoshHalliday> Hi Josh! We haven't heard of 
anyone that felt it. Too far away, maybe?

Other residents simply pointed out a possible logical reason why they did not 
feel the tremor: “I live 50 metres from the North Sea and didn’t feel the 3.9 
Scarborough earthquake because it was 100 miles out to sea,” said one.

Another added: “In case you were wondering, we never felt the earthquake. Life 
is just boringly normal.”

At the most, residents reported hearing only a “funny noise” when the rare 
earthquake struck.

Experts at the BGS said earthquakes on the east coast of the UK were 
relatively rare, saying: “Earthquakes are almost completely absent from eastern 
Scotland and north-east England. Similarly, Ireland is almost completely free 
of earthquakes. The North Sea is more active than the mainland.”


The largest known British earthquake occurred near Dogger Bank in 1931, with a 
magnitude of 6.1. It was 60 miles offshore but was still powerful enough to 
cause minor damage to buildings on the east coast of England.
