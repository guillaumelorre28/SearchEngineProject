The University of Abertay Dundee <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/dundee> has 
won the largest share of a Scottish government fund to offer more degree places 
to students from poor backgrounds.

Abertay has been awarded more than £60,000 to fund 15 out of 100 extra places 
being supported under the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council's New 
Access Partnerships initiative.

Other universities winning at least 10 places under the scheme include 
Aberdeen, Heriot-Watt, Glasgow, Queen Margaret College and Strathclyde.

More than £450,000 has been allocated by the Scottish funding council to 
support the initiative across Scotland. The council wants to reward 
institutions that find innovative ways of securing funding from companies for 
widening participation.

Abertay has secured more than £140,000 for the 2001/02 academic year from a 
number of companies and private individuals to help provide university 
education for people who might not otherwise have the chance. The university is 
investigating the possibility of providing training for local hi-tech industry.

The university is now identifying which courses will receive the extra places, 
in time for the start of the new academic year in late September.

Abertay's principal, Professor Bernard King, said: "It is very pleasing to 
have our success in widening access and attracting private sector support 
recognised at the national level in this way. We are the community university 
of Tayside and north Fife, and our record speaks for itself in terms of 
widening access to some of the least represented sectors of society. This new 
grant will be a welcome reinforcement for our ongoing activities."

A survey last month showed graduate job vacancies and salaries are on the 
increase in Scotland, with some evidence that new graduates north of the border 
earn higher salaries than those from London.
