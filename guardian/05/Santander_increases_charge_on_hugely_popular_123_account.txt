Customers of Santander’s popular 123 current account will see monthly charges 
rise to £5 on Monday, leaving up to a third paying more in fees than they 
receive back from the bank each year.

Since its launch in 2012, the 123 account has become one of the UK’s most 
popular current accounts, particularly attractive to those who hold a large 
balance and are looking for good returns.

Its promise of 3% interest on balances of up to £20,000, plus cashback on 
other household spending, meant it offered a better deal than most savings 
accounts, at a time when rates were being slashed at every other bank and 
building society. More than 3.6m 123 accounts have been opened, allowing 
Santander to build a significant market share for the first time.

Since launch the fee has been £2 a month, but in September the bank announced 
a plan to more than double it

.

The £2/month fee was more than offset by the savings interest and other 
payments. Someone holding £20,000 in their account earned more than £500 a year 
in interest alone, plus 1% cashback on water and council tax bills, 2% on gas 
and electricity bills and 3% on phone, broadband, mobile and TV bills. Many 
couples run three 123 accounts at a time – one each and a joint account – to 
maximise returns.

Savings <https://www.theguardian.com/money/savings> experts said that for 
anyone with a balance of more than £5,000, the 123 account would still offer 
the best instant access rates on the market, even after the new £60-a-year fees.

But for many others, the fee hike will mean they are now losing money. The 
bank has also increased the fee on its 123 credit card from £24 a year to £36.

A poll s by the Money Saving Expert website of its users in September found 
that, while 87% of people earned enough cashback to cover the then £2-a-month 
fee, that figure fell to 66% when the new £60 a year charge was applied.

Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, said Santander customers 
need to get out their calculators and do the maths. “Account holders need to 
use this as a wake-up call to seriously consider their options. You’d need to 
have at least £3,000 in your account throughout the year to recoup the £60 
annual fee based on 3% interest – any cashback you earn on top of this will be 
profit,” she said.


Susan Hannums, savings expert at the Savingschampion.co.uk website, said on a 
£5,000 balance customers would earn £90 in interest after the fee increase each 
year, “which is equivalent to 1.80% AER in interest for a year. Given that the 
very best rate available on an easy-access savings account is around 1.65%, 
this gives you an idea of why the Santander account should not be ignored for 
savers looking to improve their interest rates”.

Reza Attar-Zadeh, head of retail products at Santander, said in September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/sep/14/santander-increase-123-account-fees>
 the fee increase had been made “to ensure the products continue to meet the 
needs of our customers, but also our shareholders”.

“Both products continue to offer great value and the vast majority of 
customers will still be able to generate a good monthly benefit despite the 
change,” he said.

Those deciding they no longer want to pay the fee face a host of banks willing 
to offer them fee-free banking with high savings rates, often including a £100 
switching inducement.

TSB is currently offering 5% interest on current account balances up to 
£2,000, plus 5% cashback on contactless payments. Lloyds pays 4% on balances up 
to £5,000. First Direct is offering switchers £125 while Nationwide is giving 
away £100 each to account holders who persuade a friend to switch.

Last week, M&S Bank announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/05/ms-raises-stakes-battle-current-accounts-marks-spencer>
 it would give anyone moving their account £220 in M&S vouchers, provided they 
stay a year. In each of these cases, customers have to deposit set amounts each 
month to keep the benefits.
