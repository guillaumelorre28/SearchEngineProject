BAE Systems has been awarded a new contract from the US military 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military> worth up to $780m (Â£512m), in 
a rare spending boost from its largest single customer.

The US is BAE's biggest market but the defence contractor has warned it faced 
weak demand from across the Atlantic due to the scaling back of operations in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as public spending cuts.

These factors have affected BAE's performance in the UK, where the group is 
grappling with the consequences of a sustained reduction in spending by the 
Ministry of Defence.

The five-year deal with the Pentagon to produce explosives at a plant in 
Tennessee includes a further order for IMX-101 munition that is seen as a safe 
and effective replacement for TNT in artillery rounds.

IMX-101 is part of a family of explosives under development called insensitive 
munitions explosives. These formulations are significantly more stable than 
conventional TNT, making the weapon systems they support safer for troops to 
transport and handle. Although investors will welcome new business from BAE's 
largest customer, the group has signalled its determination to move into new 
territories and new markets with its failed attempt to merge with EADS, the 
owner of aerospace giant Airbus.

As a result of the failed deal, BAE has pledged to pursue its strategy of 
building its presence in Middle East markets such as Oman and the United Arab 
Emirates, as well as bolstering its well-established presence in Saudi Arabia.
