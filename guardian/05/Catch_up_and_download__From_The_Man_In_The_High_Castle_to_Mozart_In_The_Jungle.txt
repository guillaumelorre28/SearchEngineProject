The Man In The High Castle
While not quite the moreish classic it aspired to be, the opening season of 
Amazon’s sumptuous adaptation of Philip K Dick’s novel did enough to both earn 
a second series and create a healthy following eager to see it. Set in an 
alternate 1960s US after the Axis powers won the second world war, it follows 
the machinations at the top of the uneasy Nazi/Japanese alliance, as well as 
the grassroots freedom fighters seeking to rid their country of tyranny. Season 
two is now upon us, withRufus Sewell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rufus-sewell> again clearly relishing his 
role as ghoulish SS enforcer John Smith.

Mozart In The Jungle
The New York classical music scene might not seem the obvious choice of 
subject matter for a series set in 2016 rather than 1916. And yet, this Amazon 
dramedy – based on a memoir by a former professional oboist – has bagged two 
Golden Globes to date with its portrayal of a thrilling, competitive, 
sex-and-drugs-fuelled underbelly, and the singular presence of rash conductor 
Rodrigo (Gael García Bernal). As it returns for a third run, he has a new 
challenge to overcome, in the form of conducting opera diva Alessandra (Monica 
Bellucci) in Venice.

This independent web series written by Londoner Cecile Emeke – also of online 
doc series Strolling – arrived recently on the iPlayer as part of the Beeb’s 
Comedy Feeds initiative, which has previously led to larger-scale commissions 
for the likes of People Just Do Nothing. Friends Rachel and Olivia (Vanessa 
Babirye and Michelle Tiwo, pictured above) quarrel about whether or not cat 
Gertrude should be their newest housemate. But it’s not all about the 
(kidnapped) cat: Emeke shows black British friendship in the age of Instagram 
in a way that’s so rarely represented on screen without falling into boring 
stereotypes. Sparky and fun, it’s a transatlantic cousin to Issa Rae’s 
Insecure, which Emeke also worked on.

Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency
Another small-screen outing for Douglas Adams’s eccentric “holistic 
detective”. This one stars Samuel Barnett as Dirk and Elijah Wood as his 
reluctant sidekick Todd Brotzman. The original books are, essentially, shaggy 
dog stories with the plotting designed to foreground Adams’s taste for 
tangential and arcane intellectual pursuits – such as pondering the 
interconnectedness of the universe. There’s an ever-present risk that this 
Gently might prove rather too hyperactive to truly let these ideas breathe. 
However, given that a second season has already been commissioned, it’s fair to 
say that this latest iteration will be given ample time to bed in and find a 
rhythm.

Fiction podcasts have been gaining in status for a while and their 
attractiveness to big names is clear from this new mystery story from Eli 
Horowitz. Homecoming features David Schwimmer, Catherine Keener, David Cross 
and Amy Sedaris and tells the story of Heidi, a woman who worked in an 
experimental programme reacclimatising veteran soldiers into civilian life. The

work is revealed.
