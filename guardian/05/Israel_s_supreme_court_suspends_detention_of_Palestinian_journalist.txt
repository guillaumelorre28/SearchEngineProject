Israel’s supreme court has suspended the detention without trial of the 
hunger-striking Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq (aka Qeq).

But the court also decided that cannot leave hospital without permission, 
according to news agency reports.

Al-Qiq, a news reporter for Saudi channel Al Majd, has been on hunger strike 
since 24 November, three days after his arrest, and was reported to be near 
death.

The 33-year-old journalist refused food in protest at his six-month sentence 
under Israel’s controversial administrative detention law.


Israel’s Shin Bet security agency alleged that al-Qiq, who lives on the West 
Bank, had incited violence and was involved in “terrorist activities” linked to 
Hamas. Al-Qiq has denied the charges.

The court said it was suspending al-Qiq’s detention order due to his failing 
health, and that his family will be allowed to visit him in hospital.

Fayha Salash, al-Qiq’s wife, has previously told Al-Jazeera

 that her husband would accept nothing less than complete freedom.

Al-Qiq has been sentenced to prison on three previous occasions - serving a 
month in 2003, 13 months in 2004 and 16 months in 2008.
