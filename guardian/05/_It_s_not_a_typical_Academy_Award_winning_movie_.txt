When Steven Spielberg [head of the Dreamworks studio which financed American 
Beauty] first saw the film, he said: 'You've made a classic movie here.'

My reaction was: 'Okay, that's it, I can go home now. I don't need to hear 
anymore - that's the best I'm gonna get.'

I haven't heard much about the Oscar campaign yet but the talk about winning 
is very flattering, and brilliant for a movie like this because it doesn't have 
a major star. So hopefully when it arrives in other countries with Oscar buzz 
attached there will be considerably more chance that people are going to see it.

When I first heard the Oscar talk I thought it was premature. There was 
another two months' worth of movies coming out with Oscar potential. I thought 
to myself, 'Who the hell am I to think I've got a great chance?'

I still find it hard to believe the film is in the running. It's not a typical 
Academy Award-winning movie. It's dark, it's weird. It starts with the main 
character wanking in the shower. It's not a Tom Hanks kind of movie and, of 
course, there are no costumes.

When we were filming there were fights every day about how much time I was 
taking, and how much money I was spending. I knew I was spending more than I 
should, but I wouldn't give up because I knew the film would be really good. It 
seems absurd now - the arguments were often over a hundred dollars here or 
there.
