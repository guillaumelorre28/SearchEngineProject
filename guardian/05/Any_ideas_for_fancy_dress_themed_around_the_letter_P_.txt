Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

beginning with the letter P. It’s not really our thing, and we can’t spend a 
fortune, but we want to make an effort. What would you go as?
