The Power of the Daleks, a story with six episodes from the fourth season of 
Doctor Who, featured Patrick Troughton as the Doctor.

A handful of clips have been salvaged and posted online but no complete 
recording is known to have survived a purge of the master negatives from the 
BBC’s archive in 1974.

BBC Worldwide <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-worldwide> said it has 
commissioned an animation studio to recreate the episodes. They will be 
released on the BBC Store at 5.50pm on 5 November – exactly 50 years since it 
was first transmitted on BBC1.

Charles Norton, a producer and director, and the comic book artists Martin 
Geraghty and Adrian Salmon, who teamed up to make a cartoon of a lost Dad’s 
Army episode, will turn their hands to the Doctor Who project. The Power of the 
Daleks will be developed referring to audio recordings of the show, stills and 
film clips.

Norton described the animation as the most ambitious Doctor Who archive 
restoration yet attempted. “The Power of the Daleks is one of the great lost 
classics of 1960s television and a superb example of the black-and-white era at 
its finest,” he said.

Paul Hembury, BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> Worldwide producer, 
said: “We are thrilled that fans will soon be able to enjoy this rather 
sinister but wonderful, classic story.”
