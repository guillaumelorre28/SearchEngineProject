European shares end higher

A tumultuous week, which started with markets continuing their post-Brexit 
slump, has ended on a positive note as investors regained their nerve. All the 
leading European indices have finished the week with a positive performance, 
while Wall Street had also moved higher by the time London closed. The final 
scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 73.5 points or 1.13% higher at 6577.83 
 * Germany’s Dax added 0.99% to 9776.12 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.86% to 4273.96 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.61% to 16,295.78 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 1.29% higher at 8268.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 544.76 
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 36 points or 0.2% 
higher.

On the currency markets, the pound continues to fall following the Bank of 
England’s latest hints at interest rate cuts. It is down 0.35% at $1.326 and 
0.38% down against the euro at €1.19.

And on that note it’s time to close for the evening and indeed the week. 
Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week.

FTSE 100 records best weekly rise since December 2011

The FTSE 100 has finished up 1.13% at 6577.83, to its best level since 11 
August last year.

Its weekly rise of 7.21% is the best since the start of December 2011. Despite 
an initial fall in the first two trading days after last week’s shock 
referendum result, the leading index has been boosted by hopes of cheaper money 
after theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> hinted at summer 
rate cuts, and the prospect of the process for actually leaving the EU being 
delayed for months.

Back with Brexit, and a majority of US companies believe it will have a 
neglible impact.

The Institute of Supply Management, which earlier released a positive update

said 61% of the businesses it surveyed saw little impact compared to just 6% 
who thought it would have a negative effect.

European banks should not automatically have to cut dividends even if they 
reveal capital shortfalls in this year’s stress tests, according to the banking 
watchdog. Reuters reports:

The announcement aims to help restore investor confidence in Europe’s banking 
sector, where valuations lag those in the United States, partly due to 
uncertainty over capital requirements.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) is coordinating a stress test of 51 
lenders from across the 28-country bloc with the results due on July 29.

For the first time, there will be no pass or fail mark.

The EBA sought on Friday to clear up confusion over how the tests’ findings 
will feed into broader “SREP” reviews of bank capital by supervisors such as 
the European Central Bank.

The ECB supervises the eurozone’s top lenders and is looking at whether banks 
need extra capital under a supervisory review and evaluation process, or SREP.

It considers how much extra capital a bank should hold on top of its mandatory 
minimum requirements, and helps to formulate “capital guidance” for each bank.

The EBA said on Friday that this capital guidance should be set above the 
combined level of mandatory minimums and add-ons.

However, capital guidance does not constitute any form of binding capital 
requirements, and therefore is not expected to trigger automatic restrictions 
on payouts to investors, it added.

This makes clear that it is up to the supervisor to decide if dividends should 
be suspended.

Brexit will hit US GDP and raise recession risk - S&P Global

The UK decision to leave the European Union will be a drag on US GDP, 
according to S&P Global Ratings, but the size and diversity of the world’s 
biggest economy will limit its exposure. The agency said:

S&P Global now expects U.S. real GDP to grow by 2.0% in 2016 (was 2.3% in 
March) and 2.4% in 2017 (was 2.5%).

The risk of recession over the next 12 months is now between 20% to 25%, up 
from 15% to 20% in March.

The Fed will now likely stay on the sidelines until the December Federal Open 
Markets Committee meeting then will likely raise rates by 25 basis points to a 
0.5% to 0.75% range. It will gradually raise rates next year, with now only 
three increases expected for 2017 and three more for 2018. The Fed will likely 
reach its new “neutral” rate by 2019.

“All told, we expect the repercussions from Brexit to weigh somewhat on U.S. 
GDP,” says US chief economist Beth Ann Bovino. “Combining this with 
lower-than-expected first quarter growth leads to the lowering of our forecast 
for growth this year and next.”

The ISM report raises the prospect of a better than expected US non-farm 
payrolls number, said economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank:

The US Manufacturing ISM index picked up from 51.3 to 53.2 in June - 
consistent with a decent, but not amazing pace of manufacturing growth. As well 
as a good headline index, there were encouraging signs from new orders, 
including new export orders. 72% of manufacturing industries now report overall 
growth, up from 67% in May.

But the real focus of this release is probably the employment index, with the 
US jobs report less than a week away. This index rose to 50.4, its highest 
since November 2015, though admittedly, manufacturing jobs make only a small 
contribution to the overall employment total. Nonetheless, this is a small 
crumb of confidence for our above-consensus 200,000 payrolls forecast 
(consensus 175,000) and we will be watching the non-mfg ISM employment index 
and ADP surveys carefully next week for further corroboration of a return to 
labour market strength.

With markets pricing in virtually no Fed tightening in 2016 or 2017, an above 
consensus number could see bond yields, which have fallen heavily since Brexit, 
to push higher, if only for a while in these times of heightened uncertainty.

Confirmation of growth in US manufacturing in June has come in the latest ISM 
survey.

Its manufacturing activity index came in at 53.2 in June, better than the 
consensus forecast of 51.4 and May’s figure of 51.3. This is the highest level 
since February 2015.

But in a separate report, US construction spending dropped unexpectedly in 
May, the second monthly decline in a row. According to the Commerce department 
spending dropped by 0.8% in May, following a revised 2% fall in April. The 
April drop was the largest since January 2011.

Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending after an initial 1.8% decline 
in April.

US manufacturing climbs in June

US manufacturing moved up in June, according to the first of the day’s two 
surveys, but the uncertainty over Brexit could dampen growth in the coming 
months.

The final Markit manufacturing PMI index  <https://t.co/T6yyhmgt5G>came in at 
51.3, better than the expected 51.2 but lower than the initial reading of 51.4. 
But it was higher than May’s final level of 50.7 and hit a three month high. 
Markit said:

U.S. manufacturers indicated a slight rebound in production volumes during 
June, helped by the fastest rise in new work since March. However, the latest 
survey signalled that growth momentum remained relatively subdued in comparison 
to its post-crisis trend, which contributed to cautious job hiring and further 
efforts to reduce inventories in June.
 US manufacturing PMI Photograph: Markit 
Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit added:

Although the manufacturing PMI ticked higher in June, the latest reading 
rounds off the worst quarter for goods producers for six years.

The lacklustre performance of the manufacturing economy adds to signs from the 
flash services PMI surveys that the underlying pace of economic growth in the 
second quarter remained subdued Manufacturing output after a disappointing 
start to the year.

The upturn in the employment index suggests that firms may be expecting the 
recent bout of weak demand to be temporary, though hiring clearly remains 
subdued amid fragile business confidence.

Producers are struggling in the face of the strong dollar, the energy sector 
decline and presidential election jitters. With companies craving certainty, 
heightened tensions between the UK and the European Union are likely to 
unsettle the global business environment further in coming months, and 
therefore risk dampening growth in the US and export markets. The data flow in 
the next two months will therefore be critical to policymakers in gauging the 
appropriate outlook for interest rates.

Wall Street opens higher

American markets have edged ahead in early trading, but after recent rises the 
rally is not convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up nearly 800 points 
in the past three days, has opened around 19 points or 0.1% higher ahead of the 
latest US manufacturing surveys, due shortly.

Business organisation the CBI has called for “calm and decisive leadership, a 
clear plan for the UK’s future outside the EU and a framework for business and 
the government to work together and deliver that plan are businesses’ immediate 
priorities as the country navigates its exit from the EU.”

 Speaking at the Evening Standard business awards, CBI director general 
Carolyn Fairbairn also said the government must confirm that workers from the 
EU who are already in the UK can stay in the country.

More reaction to UK chancellor George Osborne abandoning his target to restore 
the public finances to surplus by 2020.

Michael Izza, chief executive of chartered accountants organisation ICAEW, said:

It was always going to be a struggle to meet the deficit target and in the 
light of the EU Referendum that job became much harder. In these uncertain 
times for business, it is imperative that Government devises a comprehensive 
strategy that minimises uncertainty and weathers any looming economic storm.

Taking the global economy into account, the UK electorate knows that we still 
have a public finance problem as we can’t continue to borrow. The challenge of 
the public finances remains a three-Parliament problem.

Earlier the European Central Bank’s chief economist Peter Praet said Brexit 
was a “new shock” and Europe rapidly needed a roadmap on Britain’s plans to 
leave.

Speaking at a Financial Times event he said it was vital to bring clarity to 
the political and economic uncertainty created by the UK referendum and that an 
“orderly process” was laid out for Brexit negotiations. He said red tape for 
firms was likely to increase as a result of the UK decision, and could weaken 
potential growth.

He added that the challenges to the eurozone remained immense but the ECB was 
ready to provide liquidity.

Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Economics, makes the point that the 
George Osborne’s target of hitting a surplus by 2020 wasn’t very realistic in 
the first place.

Even without Brexit, it was highly unlikely that the Chancellor would ever 
have met his goal. Last year, the structural budget deficit amounted to nearly 
4% of gross domestic product.

Moreover, the fiscal forecasts were based on very optimistic assumptions for 
the impact of fiscal tightening on growth, the likely revenues from tax 
avoidance measures, and the government’s ability to reduce spending after six 
prior years of austerity.

Some reaction to Osborne’s speech...

John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, welcomed the chancellor’s decision 
to drop his targets:

 I welcome the Chancellor’s decision to finally listen to the calls made by 
myself and Jeremy Corbyn over the last nine months to drop his failed surplus 
target. It is only a shame he was not realistic sooner, as under Jeremy Corbyn, 
Labour has been unequivocal in its opposition to failed Tory austerity.


Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing trade body EEF, also welcomed the 
move:

 This move will be viewed as a much-needed pick-me-up after a week of turmoil 
and bad news.


The chancellor is right to scrap the government’s hitherto relentless push on 
deficit reduction. The uncertainty that businesses are currently grappling with 
should be helped by politicians galvanising around the actions that can 
reasonably be taken to offer some policy stability - easing up on deficit 
reduction is one such measure.

A tumultuous week, which started with markets continuing their post-Brexit 
slump, has ended on a positive note as investors regained their nerve. All the 
leading European indices have finished the week with a positive performance, 
while Wall Street had also moved higher by the time London closed. The final 
scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 73.5 points or 1.13% higher at 6577.83 
 * Germany’s Dax added 0.99% to 9776.12 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.86% to 4273.96 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.61% to 16,295.78 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 1.29% higher at 8268.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 544.76 
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 36 points or 0.2% 
higher.

On the currency markets, the pound continues to fall following the Bank of 
England’s latest hints at interest rate cuts. It is down 0.35% at $1.326 and 
0.38% down against the euro at €1.19.

And on that note it’s time to close for the evening and indeed the week. 
Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week.
 
The FTSE 100 has finished up 1.13% at 6577.83, to its best level since 11 
August last year.

Its weekly rise of 7.21% is the best since the start of December 2011. Despite 
an initial fall in the first two trading days after last week’s shock 
referendum result, the leading index has been boosted by hopes of cheaper money 
after theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> hinted at summer 
rate cuts, and the prospect of the process for actually leaving the EU being 
delayed for months.
 
Back with Brexit, and a majority of US companies believe it will have a 
neglible impact.

The Institute of Supply Management, which earlier released a positive update 
on US manufacturing, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/01/shares-rise-on-brexit-rate-cut-prospect-business-live?page=with:block-57767891e4b0794b412fbaf5#block-57767891e4b0794b412fbaf5>
said 61% of the businesses it surveyed saw little impact compared to just 6% 
who thought it would have a negative effect.
 
European banks should not automatically have to cut dividends even if they 
reveal capital shortfalls in this year’s stress tests, according to the banking 
watchdog. Reuters reports:

The announcement aims to help restore investor confidence in Europe’s banking 
sector, where valuations lag those in the United States, partly due to 
uncertainty over capital requirements.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) is coordinating a stress test of 51 
lenders from across the 28-country bloc with the results due on July 29.

For the first time, there will be no pass or fail mark.

The EBA sought on Friday to clear up confusion over how the tests’ findings 
will feed into broader “SREP” reviews of bank capital by supervisors such as 
the European Central Bank.

The ECB supervises the eurozone’s top lenders and is looking at whether banks 
need extra capital under a supervisory review and evaluation process, or SREP.

It considers how much extra capital a bank should hold on top of its mandatory 
minimum requirements, and helps to formulate “capital guidance” for each bank.

The EBA said on Friday that this capital guidance should be set above the 
combined level of mandatory minimums and add-ons.

However, capital guidance does not constitute any form of binding capital 
requirements, and therefore is not expected to trigger automatic restrictions 
on payouts to investors, it added.

This makes clear that it is up to the supervisor to decide if dividends should 
be suspended.
 
Two members of the US Federal Reserve seem to have differing views on Brexit 
and the US economy, however:

FISCHER: BREXIT COULD HAVE EFFECTS ON U.S. ECONOMY 
BULLARD: SEES LITTLE IMPACT OF BREXIT ON U.S. ECONOMY

The UK decision to leave the European Union will be a drag on US GDP, 
according to S&P Global Ratings, but the size and diversity of the world’s 
biggest economy will limit its exposure. The agency said:

S&P Global now expects U.S. real GDP to grow by 2.0% in 2016 (was 2.3% in 
March) and 2.4% in 2017 (was 2.5%).

The risk of recession over the next 12 months is now between 20% to 25%, up 
from 15% to 20% in March.

The Fed will now likely stay on the sidelines until the December Federal Open 
Markets Committee meeting then will likely raise rates by 25 basis points to a 
0.5% to 0.75% range. It will gradually raise rates next year, with now only 
three increases expected for 2017 and three more for 2018. The Fed will likely 
reach its new “neutral” rate by 2019.

“All told, we expect the repercussions from Brexit to weigh somewhat on U.S. 
GDP,” says US chief economist Beth Ann Bovino. “Combining this with 
lower-than-expected first quarter growth leads to the lowering of our forecast 
for growth this year and next.”
 
The ISM report raises the prospect of a better than expected US non-farm 
payrolls number, said economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank:

The US Manufacturing ISM index picked up from 51.3 to 53.2 in June - 
consistent with a decent, but not amazing pace of manufacturing growth. As well 
as a good headline index, there were encouraging signs from new orders, 
including new export orders. 72% of manufacturing industries now report overall 
growth, up from 67% in May.

But the real focus of this release is probably the employment index, with the 
US jobs report less than a week away. This index rose to 50.4, its highest 
since November 2015, though admittedly, manufacturing jobs make only a small 
contribution to the overall employment total. Nonetheless, this is a small 
crumb of confidence for our above-consensus 200,000 payrolls forecast 
(consensus 175,000) and we will be watching the non-mfg ISM employment index 
and ADP surveys carefully next week for further corroboration of a return to 
labour market strength.

With markets pricing in virtually no Fed tightening in 2016 or 2017, an above 
consensus number could see bond yields, which have fallen heavily since Brexit, 
to push higher, if only for a while in these times of heightened uncertainty.
 
Confirmation of growth in US manufacturing in June has come in the latest ISM 
survey.

Its manufacturing activity index came in at 53.2 in June, better than the 
consensus forecast of 51.4 and May’s figure of 51.3. This is the highest level 
since February 2015.

But in a separate report, US construction spending dropped unexpectedly in 
May, the second monthly decline in a row. According to the Commerce department 
spending dropped by 0.8% in May, following a revised 2% fall in April. The 
April drop was the largest since January 2011.

Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending after an initial 1.8% decline 
in April.
 
US manufacturing moved up in June, according to the first of the day’s two 
surveys, but the uncertainty over Brexit could dampen growth in the coming 
months.

The final Markit manufacturing PMI index  <https://t.co/T6yyhmgt5G>came in at 
51.3, better than the expected 51.2 but lower than the initial reading of 51.4. 
But it was higher than May’s final level of 50.7 and hit a three month high. 
Markit said:

U.S. manufacturers indicated a slight rebound in production volumes during 
June, helped by the fastest rise in new work since March. However, the latest 
survey signalled that growth momentum remained relatively subdued in comparison 
to its post-crisis trend, which contributed to cautious job hiring and further 
efforts to reduce inventories in June.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit added:

Although the manufacturing PMI ticked higher in June, the latest reading 
rounds off the worst quarter for goods producers for six years.

The lacklustre performance of the manufacturing economy adds to signs from the 
flash services PMI surveys that the underlying pace of economic growth in the 
second quarter remained subdued Manufacturing output after a disappointing 
start to the year.

The upturn in the employment index suggests that firms may be expecting the 
recent bout of weak demand to be temporary, though hiring clearly remains 
subdued amid fragile business confidence.

Producers are struggling in the face of the strong dollar, the energy sector 
decline and presidential election jitters. With companies craving certainty, 
heightened tensions between the UK and the European Union are likely to 
unsettle the global business environment further in coming months, and 
therefore risk dampening growth in the US and export markets. The data flow in 
the next two months will therefore be critical to policymakers in gauging the 
appropriate outlook for interest rates.
 
American markets have edged ahead in early trading, but after recent rises the 
rally is not convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up nearly 800 points 
in the past three days, has opened around 19 points or 0.1% higher ahead of the 
latest US manufacturing surveys, due shortly.
 
Business organisation the CBI has called for “calm and decisive leadership, a 
clear plan for the UK’s future outside the EU and a framework for business and 
the government to work together and deliver that plan are businesses’ immediate 
priorities as the country navigates its exit from the EU.”

 Speaking at the Evening Standard business awards, CBI director general 
Carolyn Fairbairn also said the government must confirm that workers from the 
EU who are already in the UK can stay in the country.
 
More reaction to UK chancellor George Osborne abandoning his target to restore 
the public finances to surplus by 2020.

Michael Izza, chief executive of chartered accountants organisation ICAEW, said:

It was always going to be a struggle to meet the deficit target and in the 
light of the EU Referendum that job became much harder. In these uncertain 
times for business, it is imperative that Government devises a comprehensive 
strategy that minimises uncertainty and weathers any looming economic storm.

Taking the global economy into account, the UK electorate knows that we still 
have a public finance problem as we can’t continue to borrow. The challenge of 
the public finances remains a three-Parliament problem.
 
Earlier the European Central Bank’s chief economist Peter Praet said Brexit 
was a “new shock” and Europe rapidly needed a roadmap on Britain’s plans to 
leave.

Speaking at a Financial Times event he said it was vital to bring clarity to 
the political and economic uncertainty created by the UK referendum and that an 
“orderly process” was laid out for Brexit negotiations. He said red tape for 
firms was likely to increase as a result of the UK decision, and could weaken 
potential growth.

He added that the challenges to the eurozone remained immense but the ECB was 
ready to provide liquidity.

Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Economics, makes the point that the 
George Osborne’s target of hitting a surplus by 2020 wasn’t very realistic in 
the first place.

Even without Brexit, it was highly unlikely that the Chancellor would ever 
have met his goal. Last year, the structural budget deficit amounted to nearly 
4% of gross domestic product.

Moreover, the fiscal forecasts were based on very optimistic assumptions for 
the impact of fiscal tightening on growth, the likely revenues from tax 
avoidance measures, and the government’s ability to reduce spending after six 
prior years of austerity.
 
Some reaction to Osborne’s speech...

John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, welcomed the chancellor’s decision 
to drop his targets:

 I welcome the Chancellor’s decision to finally listen to the calls made by 
myself and Jeremy Corbyn over the last nine months to drop his failed surplus 
target. It is only a shame he was not realistic sooner, as under Jeremy Corbyn, 
Labour has been unequivocal in its opposition to failed Tory austerity.


Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing trade body EEF, also welcomed the 
move:

 This move will be viewed as a much-needed pick-me-up after a week of turmoil 
and bad news.


The chancellor is right to scrap the government’s hitherto relentless push on 
deficit reduction. The uncertainty that businesses are currently grappling with 
should be helped by politicians galvanising around the actions that can 
reasonably be taken to offer some policy stability - easing up on deficit 
reduction is one such measure.
