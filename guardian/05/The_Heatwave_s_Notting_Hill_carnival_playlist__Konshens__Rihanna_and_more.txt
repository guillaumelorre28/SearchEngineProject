Konshens – Bruk Off Yuh Back

Konshens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/28/jamaica-at-50-the-hot-dancehall-stars>
 was in the running to be top of the Jamaican dancehall scene around 2012 and 
2013. He’s been conspicuously quiet for a while, but recently reappeared with 
this instant classic. It’s on theriddim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddim> 
of the year – Moscato Riddim – and you’ll hear it blasting from cars and shops 
from Brixton to Harlesden and Tottenham. Definitely our tip for biggest tune at 
carnival this year.

Drake, Kyla & WizKid – One Dance

After hearing this tune a million times, we are still not sick of it. It’s got 
amazing song-writing and a great riddim. If this is what it sounds like when 
pop stars flirt with dancehall, we are happy for them to keep on flirting.

Vybz Kartel – Fever

Kartel’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/21/the-playlist-reggae-dancehall-and-soca-vybz-kartel-destra-and-more>
 ear for melody and his incredible lyrical technique make him easily the 
greatest dancehall artist of the last decade. His divisive personalityand 
criminal status 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/14/vybz-kartel-guilty-murder-lizard-williams>
 make him infamous worldwide. His new record, Fever, is typically brilliant and 
gets wheeled up twice every time we play it – a perfect example of what he is 
capable of on best form.

Rihanna – Work

Rihanna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna> is at her best making 
dancehall-pop. She dances best, sings best and misbehaves best when she’s in 
bashment mode. This is timeless Riri and fits seamlessly into any set we play. 
If she made a whole album like this it would have the potential to be up there 
with the all time greatest pop albums.

Dexta Daps – Shabba Madda Pot

This is a gangster anthem from the streets of Jamaica – great storytelling 
articulating the experience of millions of young people in the Caribbean 
diaspora. Hugely popular and gets an overwhelming reaction if you play it at 
the right moment in a dancehall party.
