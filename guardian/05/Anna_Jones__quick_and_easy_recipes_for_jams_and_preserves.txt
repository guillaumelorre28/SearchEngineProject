The change in seasons is near. It’s magical when summer and autumn collide for 
a few short weeks – it’s my favourite time of year for food. Squashes and 
mushrooms are just around the corner, while we are still enjoying the last of 
the papery husked corn, courgettes andpatty pans 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattypan_squash> in all their colours and 
misshapes. And the fruit. We’re still savouring the end of summer’s treasures: 
the hedgerows are full of blackberries and the trees heavy with figs, apples 
and stone fruits. Now is the time to make jams.

If you are not a jam maker, then buying your jam from a small producer is a 
game-changer – there are a few great makers I’ve come across in the UK and US. 
Melbourne-born Lillie O’Brien runs theLondon Borough of Jam 
<http://www.londonboroughofjam.com> and makes the sort of small batch jams I 
like: easy on the sugar and big on fruit, with unexpected riffs from spices, 
teas, garden herbs and botanicals. The care she puts into her craft reminds me 
of great jam-makers in the US, such asSqirl <http://store.sqirlla.com> in LA 
where they create jams from unusual fruits like Olallieberry (a special 
blackberry) and aprium (a plum and apricot hybrid), orJune Taylor 
<http://www.junetaylorjams.com/index.htm> who has been making incredible jams, 
fruit butters, syrups and marmalades in northern California for years. Her 
meyer lemon marmalade makes use of a fruit that’s a cross between a lemon and a 
tangerine and is only grown along the west coast of America. Jam is such a 
clever way of creating a little time capsule in a jar.

These great producers have inspired me, but when I make jam I want it to be 
easy and quick. I never have enough time to get out jam pans and thermometers 
and boil pots for hours making batches and batches of jams. So these recipes 
are simple, using my most-awaited fruits of the season: plums, damsons and figs.

A lot of people are put off making jam because they think it will be a lot of 
bother, but if you choose the right recipe, that couldn’t be further from the 
truth. The way to go is in small batches, so you don’t need a massive pan and 
you needn’t boil the fruit for hours. One of the things that does seem like a 
bore is sterilising the jars. But it couldn’t be simpler. Rather than boiling 
jars to sterilise them, I warm them in the oven while I am working. Preheat the 
oven to 140C/275F/gas mark 1. The jars should be in there for 10 minutes 
minimum, but can stay in longer. When your jam is ready and still hot, 
protecting your hands with an oven glove, carefully ladle it into the hot jars. 
This process will be sufficient to seal the jars safely. The hottest cycle on 
your dishwasher will do the trick too, just make sure you fill the jars while 
they are still hot.


Finally, for a bit more on easy, fuss-free jam-making a great little book 
calledDo Preserve 
<http://thedobook.co/products/do-preserve-make-your-own-jams-chutneys-pickles-cordials>
 came my way recently and it makes my kind of jams and pickles without too much 
fuss. It will be my guide to preserving through this and many autumns to come.

Easy roasted plum/damson jam

The easiest recipe I know. Roasting the fruit is such a foolproof way of 
making jam. It doesn’t require any kit apart from a roasting tray; it imparts 
an incredible sticky caramel character, while the fruit stones bring an almondy 
flavour and help the set. I’ve included a kind of choose-your-own adventure for 
the flavouring options, as jam is a very personal thing: some like it simple, I 
like it with interesting and unusual flavours (my favourite is the fennel 
pollen).

Makes 4 small jars
2kg small plums or damsons 
300g golden caster sugar
Juice of 1 lemon

 Flavour options 
A few twists of black pepper
A vanilla pod, split in half
1 tsp fennel pollen or fennel seeds
A couple of bay leaves 
A handful of lemon verbena
A handful of rose geranium

1 Stone your damsons or plums: if they are ripe, you will be able to squeeze 
the stone out in your hands; if they are too firm to do that, you’ll need to 
cut them open and scoop out the stone with a small spoon.

2 Lay the fruit and stones out evenly on two large baking trays, then scatter 
over the sugar and lemon juice. Now’s the time to add your flavourings – if you 
are using rose geranium, lemon verbena or bay to flavour, thoroughly mix it in 
with your hands, then leave overnight to infuse.

3 Roast the fruit in the centre of an oven preheated to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 
for 45 minutes, or until sticky and caramelised.

4 Once cooked, remove whatever flavourings you’ve used (unless you have used 
pepper or fennel, as these will be small enough to eat) and the stones. Spoon 
the jam into sterilised jars and seal immediately.

5 Store in a cool, dark place. This will keep for up to a year. Once open, 
refrigerate and eat within 3 months for the best flavour.

Fig, vanilla and orange blossom jam

This quick and easy fig jam has a very low sugar-to-fruit ratio, allowing the 
character of the figs to burst through. Personally I love orange blossom, but 
if it’s a bit too perfumed for you, leave it out or add a tea bag of earl grey 
or, even better, half a teaspoon of loose leaves tied up in a little bit of 
muslin (remove before you jar it up).

Makes 2 small jars 
1kg black figs
Zest and juice of 1 lemon
1 vanilla pod, split
200g sugar
2 tsp orange blossom water

1 Trim any hard stalks from the figs and cut into quarters. Put the figs, 
lemon zest and vanilla pod into a large saucepan. Before you put it on the 
heat, stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to mash up the figs a little.

2 Add the sugar. Put the pan on a high heat – stir continuously to ensure the 
sugar dissolves evenly. Bring to the boil (this should take 5-10 minutes) then 
turn the heat down and let it bubble away for 20 minutes, or until you have a 
thick, glossy jam.

3 Take the pan off the heat, add the orange blossom water and the lemon juice, 
mix, then spoon into your sterilised jars. Store in a cool, dark place. This 
will keep for up to a year. Once open, refrigerate and eat within 3 months for 
the best flavour.
