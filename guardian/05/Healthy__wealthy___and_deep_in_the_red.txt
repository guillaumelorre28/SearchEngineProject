Debt is beginning to haunt the middle classes as never before. That must be 
the conclusion to be drawn from the caseload of debt advice agencies. The 
problems do not involve low-income families falling victim to backstreet loan 
sharks, but people on good - though sometimes erratic - incomes who have 
borrowed too much on credit cards and personal loans.

It is the healthy incomes of the skilled and professional classes that appeal 
to the mainstream lenders, and there seems no doubt that for many people, 
credit cards and the availability of bank loans are menaces. The rise of the 
increasingly controversial, and unregulated fee-charging debt advice agencies 
is a further symptom of the way debt problems are rising up the income ladder.

Yes, some people do lie in order to borrow and spend compulsively. But it is 
time for the industry to review the way it grants credit. Too little account is 
taken of the number of other commitments an individual has before granting a 
new one.

The Office of Fair Trading should also take a look at the new fee-charging 
counselling services. A fledgling trade association is trying to set standards, 
but as yet only a minority of firms are members.
