The Welsh may be the weakest link, according to TV quiz show host Anne 
Robinson's controversial comments in a recent TV interview. But it seems that 
the Welsh are definitely the weakest link when it comes to savings, according 
to a new survey from online brokerHalifax Share Dealing 
<http://www.halifax.co.uk/default.asp?PageId=>. 

Researchers quizzed 2,000 people on their money habits. And those that didn't 
simply reject the interviewer's questions with a Robinson-style goodbye owned 
up to an average £7,030 savings nest-egg.

But in Wales the figure was much lower. The savings shirkers from Cardiff to 
Colwyn Bay have just £4,320 a head stashed away in the savings bank, according 
to the survey. And just over one in three has up to £5,000 squirreled away.

Yet just across the border in the West Midlands, Britain's best savers sit in 
splendour. Birmingham folk claim to have average savings of £10,830 - more than 
twice the Welsh average.

The south-east is traditionally the home of stockbrokers and the better-off. 
But the Halifax probe presumably found very few of them at home - the average 
savings for this area came out at a surprising £8,900.

Mancunians and the north-west - including all that legendary Cheshire wealth - 
and East Midlanders came next with £8,530 and £7,710 respectively.

Londoners fell below average - perhaps because they have the most expensive 
housing in the UK with mortgage bills to match - with a below-average £6,890.

And if the Scots do have as many bawbees locked away as legend claims, then 
they are also keeping the traditionally Caledonian attitude of never discussing 
their wealth with strangers - let alone their family or friends. They admit to 
savings per head of just £5,010.

Overall, just one in five of those questioned confessed to being "savings 
free". And one in 11 owned up to a rainy day nest-egg topping £20,000.
