Sarah Vine, the Daily Mail’s self-professed “Wednesday witch”, will return to 
the paper for the first time on Wednesday, following her husband Michael Gove’s
short-lived bid

to be Tory leader.


Vine has not appeared in the paper since her last column on 29 June in which 
she revealed her husband’s response to the shock Brexit referendum win: “Gosh. 
I suppose I had better get up.”

Her absence came after a highly embarrassing email 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/michael-goves-wife-doubts-boris-johnson-email-sarah-vine-dacre-murdoch>
 was leaked in which she urged Gove to demand a senior job from the then 
leadership front-runner Boris Johnson and suggested that her boss, Mail 
editor-in-chief Paul Dacre, as well as Rupert Murdoch, would back Gove in any 
contest.

Two days later, the Mail came out with a strong endorsement of Gove’s rival 
Theresa May.

It sparked speculation that Vine’s departure from the paper was a permanent 
one, and the contents of her comeback column on Wednesday will be eagerly 
anticipated.

An insider on the paper said it would be “business as usual” for the 
columnist. Previously, a Mail spokesman had insisted: “We are looking forward 
to her next brilliant column in the Mail.”

Vine’s column is likely to be forensically examined in the wake of Gove’s exit 
from the Tory leadership race, with May now installed as party leader and prime 
minister.

In earlier columns, with the race still wide open, Vine had used the 
first-person plural “we” to discuss leading the country in the wake of the EU 
vote.

Her decision not to write a column in the weeks that followed is understood to 
relate to the exceptional circumstances in which her husband found himself.
