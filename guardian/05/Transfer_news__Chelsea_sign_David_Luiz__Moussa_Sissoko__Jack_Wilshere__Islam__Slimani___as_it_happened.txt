Transfer tug-of-war is on!

Word is Tottenham have matched Everton’s £30m bid for Moussa Sissoko. The two 
clubs now have an hour to convince the Frenchman that they’re the club for him. 
Spurs can offer Champions League action, Everton can offer the attraction of 
not being in London. Both, presumably, can offer gigantic piles of cash. So 
which would you opt for, readers?

What with Giorginio Wijnaldum going to Liverpool and Darryl Janmaat returning 
to the Premier League with Watford, Some Newcastle players have done very well 
out of performing terribly for most of last season. And there’s still time for 
Barcelona to come in with a £40m for Jonjo Shelvey.

Sky Sports’ pundits in the studio for the closing stages of deadline day are 
Paul Merson and Niall Quinn. According to Quinn’s autobiography there was a 
time, back when his former team-mate was battling drink and gambling 
addictions, that doctors forbade Merson from consorting with people who might 
be bad influences, primarily Quinn. Heartening to see their friendship 
flourishing again.

Alvaro Arbelo is back in the Premier League, having joined West Ham from Real 
Madrid. First Michail Antonio gets an England call-up, then he gets news that 
he’ll probably not have to play at right-back again: it’s been a good week for 
him.

“We managed to capture some footage of a blacked-out people carrier arriving 
at the Stadium of Light”. With one quote Sky Sports’ man in Sunderland sums up 
the absurdity of what we’re all doing today. (For what it’s worth, they think 
Jason Denayer may have been in the people carrier)

Leicester confirm signing of Islam Slimani

The Algeria international has reportedly signed a five year deal for around 
£29m. And what a brilliant acquisition he is: he’s no technician but he’s a 
ferocious warrior who’ll fit right in at Leicester, who now have an armoury to 
strike fear into any defence. No defence is going to get an easy ride against 
Slimani, Vardy, Musa, Okazaki and Mahrez.

David Moyes has made some very iffy signings at Sunderland so far. But at 
least you can se the logic in their interest in Manchester City’s reserve 
centreback Jason Denayer. He’s a Belgium international player with a lot of 
potential, but still raw. Sunderland are trying to nail down a loan deal for 
him.

Hal Robson-Kanu is reportedly on his way to the Hawthorns for a medical. The 
Welshman was terrific for his country throughout the Euro 2016 qualifiers and 
finals, but I’ll be surprised if he helps turn West Brom into the freewheeling 
attackers that Tony Pulis wants us to believe the Baggies are going to become. 
I’d say Pulis vacating the Hawthorns before the end of the season is far more 
likely.

“Never mind the transfers, I trust you are wearing a yellow and black combo in 
keeping with those on Sky Sports,” declares Mark Judd. Yes, of course I am, 
Mark. In fact, all of us at Guardian towers are. Here’s some footage of us 
doing a team bonding exercise during a brief lull in the blog earlier today.

earlier, don’t you? asks Jeremy Hunter. I admire your ambition, Jeremy, but if

Robbie Keane = Gerd Müller!

The Irishman has helped put his country 3-0 up in tonight’s friendly against 
Oman and, in doing so, scored his 68th international goal, equalling the haul 
of the German maestro. Alright, it took Keane nearly twice as many matches to 
reach that tally and he benefitted from playing pipsqueaks such as Oman and San 
Marino, but that is slightly offset by the fact that Müller played for the 
mighty West Germany. And Keane was only a flat track bully in his later years, 
let’s not forget that he has also scored in important competitive matches 
against France, Holland, Spain, Croatia, Yugoslavia and, of course, Germany. 
Man’s a bona fide international star.
 Robbie Keane fires home the Republic of Ireland’s second goal against Oman.

Two years ago Brendan Rodgers described Liverpool’s £16m acquisition of Mario 
Balotelli as a “calculated risk”. Today Balotelli has completed a permanent 
transfer to Nice for precisely zero pounds. By my calculations that risk 
resulted in a huge loss of money and face. But both parties will surely be 
thankful it’s all over. And let’s not rule out Balotelli getting back to his 
best: after all, Hatem Ben Arfa was reborn at Nice last season.

Sissoko edges close to Everton

Sky Sports are reporting that Everton have agreed a £30m fee with Newcastle 
for the sometime-performer Moussa Sissoko. The Frenchman is now stripping off 
for a medical. Things are shaping up nicely at Goodison Park, where Farhad 
Moshiri certainly means business. They’re had an impressive summer of recruits, 
including Ronald Koeman: is it too soon for the Dutchman to lead them into the 
top four this season?

Pogba moves to Holland

No, not Paul, but his brother (and Guinea international) Florentin, who has 
quit Partick Thistle and run into the warm embrace of Sparta Rotterdam.

Hello, Paul Doyle at your service. Now, let’s quash this idea that PSG were 
deadset against selling David Luiz. Although they did not plan to flog his in 
this window, the club’s new manager, Unai Emery, made it clear in the summer 
that he intended to make Thiago Silva and Marquinhos his first choice 
partnership in central defence. So David Luiz was dispensable, all the more so 
after giving away a ludicrous penalty against Monaco last Sunday. He can be 
brilliant player and is a wonderful character but that goofy streak still runs 
through him. It’s going to be interesting to see how he gets on under Conte.

Almost done deal klaxon

I’ve just spotted TV footage Jack Wilshere has been pictured posing with Eddie 
Howe and a Bournemouth shirt. On Sky, Alan McInally has been scathing in his 
criticism of Wilshere for moving to Bournemouth, when he could have moved 
abroad instead.

Let’s end this circus with a round-up of the main late moves: 

 * David Luiz (PSG to Chelsea, £34m) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/david-luiz-shock-return-chelsea-34m-transfer-psg>
 * Jack Wilshere (Arsenal to Bournemouth, loan) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/arsenal-jack-wilshere-bournemouth-loan>
 * Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle to Tottenham, £30m) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/tottenham-moussa-sissoko-everton-newcastle>
 * Islam Slimani (Sporting Lisbon to Leicester, £30m)

 * Mario Balotelli (Liverpool to Nice, free) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/mario-balotelli-completes-move-from-liverpool-to-nice-on-free-transfer>

 * Enner Valencia (West Ham to Everton, loan) 
 * Hal Robson-Kanu (free agent to WBA) 
 * Alvaro Arbeloa (Real Madrid to West Ham) 
 * Allan Nyom (Watford to WBA) 
 * Georges-Kévin Nkoudou (Marseille to Tottenham, £9.4m) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/georges-kevin-nkoudou-finally-seals-tottenham-transfer-40-days-after-passing-medical> 
Chelsea have confirmed the return of David Luiz, who told the club’s website: 
“I’m delighted to return to Chelsea. We had a fantastic story during my first 
time at the club and I want to help the team and Antonio Conte achieve a lot of 
success. I always had a wonderful relationship with the fans and I am looking 
forward to wearing the blue shirt at Stamford Bridge once again.”

After hooking up with Mario Balotelli, Nice have signed Younes Belhanda from 
Dynamo Kiev.
 
Rickie Lambert has flown the West Brom coop to join the bluebirds of Cardiff 
City.
 
Everton have consoled themselves by borrowing Enner Valencia from West Ham. 
 
Here’s that confirmation. Sissoko’s phone wasn’t working earlier, when Ronald 
Koeman was trying to get in touch to welcome him to Everton, but now he’s 
tweeting like billyo.
Moussa Sissoko (@MoussaSissoko) 
Very happy to join @SpursOfficial <https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial> for the 
next 5 years !pic.twitter.com/2KLe0Hmd4V <https://t.co/2KLe0Hmd4V>

<https://twitter.com/MoussaSissoko/status/771104537453232128>  
But we eagerly await confirmation of several moves - notably Sissoko to Spurs 
-, and perhaps even some late surprises. But most of all, we want to go to bed.
 
Strange rumblings from Sunderland, where Yann M’vila’s mooted transfer is said 
to have broken down, much to the player’s anguish. Stay tuned for more. At some 
point.
 
The David Luiz deal to Chelsea has been completed, according to Sky. I can’t 
remember whether we already knew that or not.
 
The Scottish speedster Ikechi Anya has left Watford for Derby County.
 
“I am not a West Brom fan, I barely know who Hal Robson Kanu is, but the 
league table tells me that, contrary to what you said, West Brom are not in a 
relegation fight, unless Arsenal are too,” carps Greg Easter. Check that table 
again at the end of the season, Greg.
 
Hull have signed Dieumerci Mbokani on loan Dynamo Kiev. He’s a slightly 
lumbering striker but can be a useful fulcrum if given the right support.
 
Everton have withdrawn their bid for Sissoko, having been told by the player’s 
representatives that he’s off to Spurs. “With news that Everton have apparently 
withdrawn their bid, you know Levy’s now gonna turn around to Newcastle and say 
£30m? Nah, I meant 25,” parps Ben Overlander.
 Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) 
CONFIRMED: Newcastle United have completed the signing of @ChristianAtsu20 
<https://twitter.com/ChristianAtsu20> on a season-long loan from Chelsea! #NUFC

<https://twitter.com/NUFC/status/771097746354868224>  
Bolton’s renaissance is taking shape: they’ve confirmed the signings of James 
Henry, Keshi Anderson, Ben Alnwick and Sammy Ameobi.
 
Liverpool winger Lazar Markovic, a Brendan Rodgers signing unused by Jurgen 
Klopp, has joined Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan, reports Paul Wilson.
 
Bastian Schweinsteiger received a rapturous send-off from his compatriots on 
his final appearance for Germany tonight, a 2-0 friendly victory over Finland. 
And soon he’ll head back to Manchester, where Jose Mourinho may or may not 
acknowledge his existence.

According to Sky, Moussa Sissoko has backtracked on a verbal agreement with 
Everton and is on his way to Spurs.
 
Jason Denayer has completed his season-long loan to Sunderland from Manchester 
City, according to Jamie Jackson.
 
A Wilshere ripple effect: Eunan O’Kane has left Bournemouth to become Leeds 
United’s 11th signing of the summer.
 
Word is Tottenham have matched Everton’s £30m bid for Moussa Sissoko. The two 
clubs now have an hour to convince the Frenchman that they’re the club for him. 
Spurs can offer Champions League action, Everton can offer the attraction of 
not being in London. Both, presumably, can offer gigantic piles of cash. So 
which would you opt for, readers?

What with Giorginio Wijnaldum going to Liverpool and Darryl Janmaat returning 
to the Premier League with Watford, Some Newcastle players have done very well 
out of performing terribly for most of last season. And there’s still time for 
Barcelona to come in with a £40m for Jonjo Shelvey.
 
Sky are claiming that Sunderland’s move for Steven Naismith is now unlikely to 
be completed. Perhaps David Moyes was shown footage of him in action for 
Norwich last season?
 
Lyon had their hearts set on signing Juan Iturbe but it’s not going to happen: 
Roma have definitively shooed them away.
 
Sky Sports’ pundits in the studio for the closing stages of deadline day are 
Paul Merson and Niall Quinn. According to Quinn’s autobiography there was a 
time, back when his former team-mate was battling drink and gambling 
addictions, that doctors forbade Merson from consorting with people who might 
be bad influences, primarily Quinn. Heartening to see their friendship 
flourishing again.
 
Confirmed: Hal Robson-Kanu has joined West Brom’s relegation fight. 
 
“Is there any indications that Jurgen Klopp is going to sign a proper 
left-back tonight?” wails Alex Perry. Not so far, Alex, so it’s looking like 
Liverpool will have to make do with James Milner and memories of Alan Kennedy.
 
Here is some meat on the bones of two of today’s biggest stories: 

Dominic Fifield on Jack Wilshere’s decision to plump for Bournemouth ahead of 
21 other suitors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/arsenal-jack-wilshere-bournemouth-loan>
.


And Ed Aarons on Islam Slimani joining the Premier League champions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/leicester-confirm-30m-signing-of-islam-slimani-from-sporting-lisbon>
.

 
Here’s more from Louise Taylor: “James Weir, has swapped life as captain of 
Manchester United Under-21s for Hull. Lacks experience and bit of an 
underwhelming move for Hull fans but could be interesting. Meanwhile, Adam 
Reach has completed his move from Middlesbrough to Sheffield Wednesday.”
 
Bournemouth have confirmed the signing of Jack Wilshere. Assorted club 
officials have issued statements declaring their glee at such a prestigious 
acquisition. Wilshere, for his part, has yet to explain why he chose 
Bournemouth.
 
“Yes, it was probably Jason Denayer in that people carrier: he’s having a 
medical at Sunderland right now,” confirms our woman in the now, Louise Taylor.
 
Alvaro Arbelo is back in the Premier League, having joined West Ham from Real 
Madrid. First Michail Antonio gets an England call-up, then he gets news that 
he’ll probably not have to play at right-back again: it’s been a good week for 
him.

Griffiths/West Ham United via Getty Images  
Here’s an intriguing one from our man in the know, Stuart James: Enner 
Valencia is joining Everton on a season’s loan from West Ham.
 
“We managed to capture some footage of a blacked-out people carrier arriving 
at the Stadium of Light”. With one quote Sky Sports’ man in Sunderland sums up 
the absurdity of what we’re all doing today. (For what it’s worth, they think 
Jason Denayer may have been in the people carrier)
 
The Algeria international has reportedly signed a five year deal for around 
£29m. And what a brilliant acquisition he is: he’s no technician but he’s a 
ferocious warrior who’ll fit right in at Leicester, who now have an armoury to 
strike fear into any defence. No defence is going to get an easy ride against 
Slimani, Vardy, Musa, Okazaki and Mahrez.

Aiden McGeady, who is a quarter of the player he might have been, has been 
ushered out of Everton and found shelter at Preston North End.
 
Mike Phelan has been dipping into his Old Trafford contacts book and, as a 
result, Hull have signed the 21-year-old midfielder James Weir from Manchester 
United.
 
Here’s a visual run-down of Jack Wilshere’s career high and lows so far. 
The ups and downs of Jack Wilshere’s career so far 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-jack-wilsheres-career-so-far-video-report> 
The intrepid Jamie Jackson has been in touch to let us know that although Pep 
Guardiola has greenlit Denayer’s move to Sunderland, the medical ahead of a 
season-long loan may not be done tonight.
 
Paul Wilson reports that Burnley are signing the Poland winger Kamil Grosicki 
from Rennes for £7m on a three-year deal.
 Ed Aarons (@ed_aarons) 
Mario #Lemina <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lemina?src=hash> not leaving 
Juventus this window and will sign a new contract at the Italian champions next 
month
 <https://twitter.com/ed_aarons/status/771075758777401344> August 31, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/ed_aarons/status/771075758777401344>  
David Moyes has made some very iffy signings at Sunderland so far. But at 
least you can se the logic in their interest in Manchester City’s reserve 
centreback Jason Denayer. He’s a Belgium international player with a lot of 
potential, but still raw. Sunderland are trying to nail down a loan deal for 
him.
 
Hal Robson-Kanu is reportedly on his way to the Hawthorns for a medical. The 
Welshman was terrific for his country throughout the Euro 2016 qualifiers and 
finals, but I’ll be surprised if he helps turn West Brom into the freewheeling 
attackers that Tony Pulis wants us to believe the Baggies are going to become. 
I’d say Pulis vacating the Hawthorns before the end of the season is far more 
likely.
 
“Never mind the transfers, I trust you are wearing a yellow and black combo in 
keeping with those on Sky Sports,” declares Mark Judd. Yes, of course I am, 
Mark. In fact, all of us at Guardian towers are. Here’s some footage of us 
doing a team bonding exercise during a brief lull in the blog earlier today.
 
“You do know that one of your colleagues posted the news about Balotelli 
earlier, don’t you? asks Jeremy Hunter. I admire your ambition, Jeremy, but if 
you’re on a quest to banish repetition on transfer deadline day, you’re doomed. 
This is what it’s all about. I said, this is what it’s all about.
 
By the way, one of Ireland other goals tonight has been scored by Jonathan 
Walters, who may be no Müller or Keane but isdefinitely a bona fide hero 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/dec/11/jonathan-walters-stoke-city-football>
.
 
The Irishman has helped put his country 3-0 up in tonight’s friendly against 
Oman and, in doing so, scored his 68th international goal, equalling the haul 
of the German maestro. Alright, it took Keane nearly twice as many matches to 
reach that tally and he benefitted from playing pipsqueaks such as Oman and San 
Marino, but that is slightly offset by the fact that Müller played for the 
mighty West Germany. And Keane was only a flat track bully in his later years, 
let’s not forget that he has also scored in important competitive matches 
against France, Holland, Spain, Croatia, Yugoslavia and, of course, Germany. 
Man’s a bona fide international star.
 Robbie Keane fires home the Republic of Ireland’s second goal against Oman.

Two years ago Brendan Rodgers described Liverpool’s £16m acquisition of Mario 
Balotelli as a “calculated risk”. Today Balotelli has completed a permanent 
transfer to Nice for precisely zero pounds. By my calculations that risk 
resulted in a huge loss of money and face. But both parties will surely be 
thankful it’s all over. And let’s not rule out Balotelli getting back to his 
best: after all, Hatem Ben Arfa was reborn at Nice last season.
 
Here’s Peter Oh with a quip: “It looks like my advice to Jack Wilshere will 
have to be revised to ‘When in Bournemouth...’. Well go on, finish the quip: 
what are people from Bournemouth called?
 
Sky Sports are reporting that Everton have agreed a £30m fee with Newcastle 
for the sometime-performer Moussa Sissoko. The Frenchman is now stripping off 
for a medical. Things are shaping up nicely at Goodison Park, where Farhad 
Moshiri certainly means business. They’re had an impressive summer of recruits, 
including Ronald Koeman: is it too soon for the Dutchman to lead them into the 
top four this season?
 
No, not Paul, but his brother (and Guinea international) Florentin, who has 
quit Partick Thistle and run into the warm embrace of Sparta Rotterdam.

Hello, Paul Doyle at your service. Now, let’s quash this idea that PSG were 
deadset against selling David Luiz. Although they did not plan to flog his in 
this window, the club’s new manager, Unai Emery, made it clear in the summer 
that he intended to make Thiago Silva and Marquinhos his first choice 
partnership in central defence. So David Luiz was dispensable, all the more so 
after giving away a ludicrous penalty against Monaco last Sunday. He can be 
brilliant player and is a wonderful character but that goofy streak still runs 
through him. It’s going to be interesting to see how he gets on under Conte.
 
I’ve just spotted TV footage Jack Wilshere has been pictured posing with Eddie 
Howe and a Bournemouth shirt. On Sky, Alan McInally has been scathing in his 
criticism of Wilshere for moving to Bournemouth, when he could have moved 
abroad instead.
 
Recognise anyone here?
