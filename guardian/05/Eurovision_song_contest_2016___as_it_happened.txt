And that’s that. Congratulations to Ukraine, who might be pleased about winning
Eurovision <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision> now, but only 
because they haven’t realised that they’ve basically just invited Heidi 
Stephens to rampage drunk through their country.

With that, it’s time for me to say goodbye. Of all the Eurovision song 
contests I’ve ever liveblogged, this has certainly been the most recent. Thanks 
for your comments and tweets and general moral support. God knows I needed it. 
If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m@StuHeritage 
<http://www.twitter.com/stuheritage>, but I suspect you might not. Thanks 
again, world, and goodnight.

Heidi Stephens

It’s goodbye from Stockholm, but first a giant thanks to my lovely friend 
Alice, who has been amazing at helping me keep up with everything that’s going 
on backstage on what has been a crazy, crazy night.

I’m on Twitter @heidistephens if you’d like to say hi, but right now I’m off 
to the Euroclub to dance the night away. Thanks for joining in, and see you in 
Kiev next year!

What a victory. How exciting. And how terrible for next year’s Eurovision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision>, now that it’s going to 
be full of miserable UK garage songs about all the horrible things that 
happened to their grandparents.

The press room has gone ballistic, the Ukrainians are screaming, and the 
Russians are in tears. That was INTENSE.

Woah. Ukraine has won. If my maths is right, Ukraine just pipped Australia, 
and Russia won’t be able to make up the difference. This new voting system is 
AMAZING and also I’m about to die of a heart attack.

Heidi Stephens

Did the Swedish announcer just say, “If there’s room in the heart, there’s 
room in the butt?”

And that’s that. Congratulations to Ukraine, who might be pleased about winning
Eurovision <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision> now, but only 
because they haven’t realised that they’ve basically just invited Heidi 
Stephens to rampage drunk through their country.

With that, it’s time for me to say goodbye. Of all the Eurovision song 
contests I’ve ever liveblogged, this has certainly been the most recent. Thanks 
for your comments and tweets and general moral support. God knows I needed it. 
If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m@StuHeritage 
<http://www.twitter.com/stuheritage>, but I suspect you might not. Thanks 
again, world, and goodnight.
 
It’s goodbye from Stockholm, but first a giant thanks to my lovely friend 
Alice, who has been amazing at helping me keep up with everything that’s going 
on backstage on what has been a crazy, crazy night.

I’m on Twitter @heidistephens if you’d like to say hi, but right now I’m off 
to the Euroclub to dance the night away. Thanks for joining in, and see you in 
Kiev next year!
 
What a victory. How exciting. And how terrible for next year’s Eurovision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision>, now that it’s going to 
be full of miserable UK garage songs about all the horrible things that 
happened to their grandparents.
 
The press room has gone ballistic, the Ukrainians are screaming, and the 
Russians are in tears. That was INTENSE.
 
Good God. UKRAINE HAS WON EUROVISION. That was tense.
 
Woah. Ukraine has won. If my maths is right, Ukraine just pipped Australia, 
and Russia won’t be able to make up the difference. This new voting system is 
AMAZING and also I’m about to die of a heart attack.
 
SO TENSE in the Press Room right now. People are gasping like dying goldfish.
 
Again, this is proof that democracy simply does not work.
 
I’ve also just realised that Poland was the hipster Jesus guy. And he’s gained 
most of the public vote. I know nothing. Everything is broken.
 
What a nightmare of bad maths. This is like if the best rave you’ve ever been 
to ended up with a GCSE test.
 
This whole thing is teetering on the brink of total technical meltdown. Also 
I’m confused. And tired. And we’re only going to come third from last now. And 
I think Australia is definitely going to win. But mainly I’m tired.
 
Oh boy. We’re going to come second to last.
 
This is easily the most confusing thing I have ever seen.
 
The United Kingdom did not get a single point in the popular vote. This new 
voting scheme is BRUTAL.
 
We’re about to find out how the public voted. Australia’s inevitable victory 
will be rubberstamped at some point in the intermediate future.
 
Did the Swedish announcer just say, “If there’s room in the heart, there’s 
room in the butt?”
 
The jury votes have been completed. If this was a normal Eurovision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision>, Australia would have won 
by now. But we only know half of the total votes. I have no idea what happens 
next, but I hope it’s swift, and followed by a deep sleep.
 
Australia is 90 points out in front now. But is it all meaningless, since the 
public vote hasn’t been revealed yet? I wish I knew. I basically haven’t got a 
clue what happens after this bit. If anyone makes Georgian Kasabian win, 
though, I’m going to have the world’s biggest tantrum.
 
Petra is being unflappable in the face of all these national jury idiots. You 
don’t screw with Petra. Clearly you don’t.
