Readers may remember the ongoing feud between Piers Morgan and Alan Carr. 
Yesterday we reported how the former Mirror editorhad taken a pop at the 
Channel 4 chatshow host in the Sun 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/jun/28/piers-morgan-alan-carr>
, describing him, among many other things, "as annoying as the Crankies". Carr 
has now hit back, saying he refuses to be "drawn into an argument with someone 
whose face resembles a butternut squash". Truly, it's turning into one of the 
bust-ups of the millennium.
