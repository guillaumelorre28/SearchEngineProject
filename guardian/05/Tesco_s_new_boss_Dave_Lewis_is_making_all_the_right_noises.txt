New Tesco boss, Dave Lewis <https://www.theguardian.com/business/dave-lewis>, 
has had a busy first couple of days. Aside from firing off a letter to the 
grocer's 500,000 staff asking them to email him direct if they have any bright 
ideas – let's hope he has a hefty inbox – he has been out addressing the 
troops, turning up at offices and internal conferences to rally the troops. He 
has also promised to get in touch with shareholders to canvass their views.

The UK, he has been clear, is the key priority. But a new set of numbers this 
week in Ireland will remind Lewis that this is a business that has heaps of 
problems in other countries, too.

Three-monthly market-share data released in Dublin showed Tesco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> Ireland's market share plummeting 
by a shocking 5.5%, to 25.4%. Ireland's number two grocer, Supervalu, is on the 
brink of overtaking, with a market share of 25.2%, but not as a result of its 
own impressive performance. It is actually treading water.

No, Tesco's problems in Ireland are the same as in the UK – Aldi and Lidl are 
stealing its shoppers. Together, they now account for 17% of the Irish grocery 
market. Two-thirds of Irish shoppers now visit the LADs – limited assortment 
discounters – as they are known.

The analyst Clive Black points out that Ireland is really rather important – 
it is the biggest profits generator in the grocer's European business.

What is required, says the veteran retail-watcher, is priority, urgency, 
focus, reallocation of resources and simplicity. The good news is that Black 
reckons all of the above have been "clearly present" in Lewis's utterances in 
his first days. So far, then, so good.
