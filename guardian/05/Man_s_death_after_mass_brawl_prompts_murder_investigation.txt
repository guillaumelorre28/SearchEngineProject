Detectives have launched a murder investigation over the death of a man after 
a mass brawl outside a lapdancing club.


Police were called to a report of 10 men fighting outside the bar in 
Altrincham town centre at about 2.40am on Thursday.

Greater Manchester police said officers found a 31-year-old man with serious 
head injuries. He was taken to hospital, where he later died.



On Thursday night police announced that two men, aged 25 and 22, have been 
arrested on suspicion of murder, section 18 assault, affray and possession of 
an offensive weapon.

DI Neil Coop, said: “We have two men in custody but we are still in the early 
stages of the murder investigation.

“If anyone has any information about the set of events, which led to a man’s 
life being cruelly taken away from him and his family, please contact us as 
soon as possible.”

On Thursday morning, forensic officers were working in and around two police 
tents outside the club – Totties, in The Causeway.


A Home Office post-mortem examination is due to take place to establish the 
exact cause of death.

Det Ch Supt Paul Rumney said: “This is such a tragic situation, made even more 
devastating by the fact it is days before Christmas and what should be a happy 
time turned into violence.

“My thoughts are with the man’s family and our specially trained officers are 
supporting them through this difficult time.”

Totties, the only lapdancing bar in the Manchester borough of Trafford, has 
been open since 2002. It was granted a fresh licence in 2011, when it had to 
re-apply under a new policy giving councils more control over lapdancing clubs.

No objections were raised to the application, the Manchester Evening News 
reported at the time, and the bar’s proprietor claimed it had a “zero call-out 
rate from the police”.
