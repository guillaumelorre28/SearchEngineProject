This week I’m celebrating the first anniversary of moving into my new home 
and, crucially, having a garden again. I have mixed emotions about the date – 
it represents a year of stability after a turbulent couple of years, so it’s 
something of a muted celebration. Yet without change, so they say, there would 
be no butterflies. And it is butterflies, or the promise of them and other 
wildlife, that has got me and the garden to where we are today.

 Decking desert: this is how Kate Bradbury’s garden looked before she started 
work on creating a wildlife garden. Photograph: Kate Bradbury 
Rented out and unloved for 20 years, my new, small “garden” lay under a 
life-suppressing layer of decking and stones. Living things had grown against 
the odds – seeds of willowherb and buddleia had lodged themselves in cushions 
of moss; bindweed crept through holes in the walls. But this was a joyless 
fight for life. There were no birds here – without trees, the local colony of 
house sparrows flew over my garden from one place of safety to another. The 
only bees were those pollinating the brambles that grew, teasingly close, in 
next door’s wilderness. I heard foxes at night but they never came near. This 
was a sad place. And besides, it looked embarrassingly ugly.

So I took up the decking, unbuttoned the earth and, gradually, started a 
garden. I could have borrowed money to get landscapers to do the job in a few 
days, level it off and leave me with a neat, sanitised skeleton of lawn and 
empty borders, which I would plant up and tend, as if the garden had never been 
imprisoned.

But I didn’t. I took up the decking myself, every single piece, which I 
unscrewed, chopped, bashed and swore at, until I was left, two months later, 
with stones and mud, and a feeling of having bitten off more than I could chew.

I persevered. I recycled most of the decking on Gumtree, carrying it through 
my flat and out through the living room window, and burned or composted the 
rest. I used the stones to make paths (I didn’t know what else to do with them 
and couldn’t face taking them through the flat as well). I spent an afternoon 
in January digging the soil, turning up worms for a hungry robin that followed 
me and my spade; the promise of things to come. I dug a pond. I erected bee 
hotels and bird boxes, and turned my living room into a greenhouse, germinating 
a thousand wildlife-friendly plants. I planted an apple tree, two climbing 
roses and a clematis, plus native shrubs to attract egg-laying moths. I set 
free plants that had survived in pots for two years, having been wrenched, as I 
was, from our previous garden.

Creating a garden from scratch isn’t new to me. My last garden was paved, too, 
and I took up the slabs, brought in topsoil and added wildlife-friendly plants. 
Over the years I watched wildlife arrive: blue tits and great tits, 
goldfinches, moth caterpillars. If you build it, they really do come, and if 
they don’t come, you just build it differently; move the bird box, try a 
different cultivar.

Here, there’s still a long way to go: the climbing roses and clematis have 
barely covered the ugly fence panels at the back, the slugs have eaten all nine 
of my sunflowers, the greenhouse looks ridiculous and I might have planted a 
few too many teasels. But it’s a journey, and every gardener knows a garden is 
never finished.

Happily, my embryonic wildlife garden is now enough for the house sparrows, 
who sneak in when they think I’m not watching, to bathe in my three-month-old 
pond. The pond is also home to diving and whirligig beetles, pond snails and 
the larvae of midges, mosquitoes and hoverflies (all of which I’m happy to have 
as they provide food for bats and swifts).

Leafcutter bees are nesting in my bee hotel for the first time, using the 
leaves of one of the climbing roses –‘Francis E Lester’ 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/91730/Rosa-Francis-E-Lester-(HM-Ra)/Details> – 
to seal their brood cells. There are bumblebees and damselflies and holly blue 
butterflies andmuslin moths <http://ukmoths.org.uk/species/diaphora-mendica>. 
Two collared doves. A start.

Overall it’s a happy anniversary; one on which I can build and foster the 
growth of both me and the garden. Over the next six months, I’ll be documenting 
the development of the garden and the wildlife that comes to it on this blog. 
And demonstrating, hopefully, how quickly wildlife turns up if you create the 
right habitats.
