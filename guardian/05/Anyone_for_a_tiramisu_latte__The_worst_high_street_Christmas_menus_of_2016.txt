Nowhere have the tentacles of the ever-swelling Christmas blob made more gains 
in recent years than on the seasonal menus of high-street food chains. 
Starbucks releasing its annual Christmas cup is now up there with the John 
Lewis ad and poppy controversy as a harbinger of yuletide. This year, it was 
even subject to an Apple-style “leak”, whenphotos emerged on Reddit of the 
soon-to-be-released design 
<http://www.thedailymeal.com/starbucks-red-cups-holiday-2016-design-leaked-reddit/102916>
.

Alongside the new cups, the likes of the Starbucks toffee nut latte 
<https://www.starbucks.co.uk/menu/drinks/espresso-drinks/latte/hot-uk-toffee-nut-latte>
 and thegingerbread frappuccino 
<https://www.starbucks.co.uk/menu/drinks/frappuccino/coffee-frappuccino/iced-gingerbread-frappuccino-blended-coffee>
 are set to return. But what other questionable Christmas menu items are 
bubbling away in the research labs of high‑street chains?

Eat has taken classic US stodge and waved the Christmas wand over it until it 
became “brie n truffle mac n cheese”. The pigs in blankets are back and 
improved, while the caramel spiced latte is new, as is the turkey hotpot and the

bloomer – a cheese sandwich to you or me.

 Eat’s Christmassy take on macaroni cheese. 
Over at Caffè Nero, they’ve realised that the true magic of the season is its 
inclusiveness, hence their new gluten-free Christmas savoury roll. The real 
trouser-strainers are in Nero’s tiramisu range: a tiramisu latte or hot 
chocolate (with or without cream) and a tiramisu slice. Enjoy with a chocolate 
orange or a gingerbread muffin for that gloriously festive sugar‑coma feeling.

Costa has chosen to fight Starbucks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/starbucks> directly at the cup level, 
having unveiled its own Christmas-jumper-patterned receptacle. Within the cup, 
you’re entitled to request a mint hot chocolate, which comes with “an elf-sized 
candy cane” that hangs over the lip (it’s unclear whether said cane is designed 
for an elf to eat or to use for walking). Finally, if you’ve always thought 
that your pigs look cold in their blankets, why not put them in a duvet, with 
Costa’s pigs-in‑blankets panino?

 Costa’s range of Christmas cups. 
While past Christmas master Pret a Manger is waiting until next week to unveil 
its menu items, and McDonald’s is holding off until the end of the month, 
plenty of new entrants are piling in to the market. EvenSubway has decided to 
chance its arm this year for the first time, with a turkey, sausage, bacon and 
cranberry sauce concoction. “Unlike other prepackaged seasonal sandwiches, the 
Subway Festive Feast can be completely customised to suit individual tastes,” 
trills its press release. It’s as though Tiny Tim himself were cartwheeling 
off his crutches to address the marketing executives of an international 
fast-food conglomerate.

 Subway’s ‘festive feast’, its first attempt at a Christmas sandwich.
