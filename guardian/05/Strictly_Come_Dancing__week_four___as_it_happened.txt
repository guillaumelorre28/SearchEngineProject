Naga and Pasha do a drunk wedding dance to Never Can Say Goodbye, which is not 
a problem I have, because this is goodbye. Thank you so much to everyone who 
has left comments, it’s the best bit of this blog by a country mile, and very 
much appreciated. I’ll be back next Saturday at 6.35pm for some more liveblog 
fun, and don’t forget Rhik’s Bake Off liveblog on Wednesday. See you next week, 
and keeeep dancing! Hx

Which means NAGA AND PASHA are going home, and Anastacia and Brendan live to 
dance another day. I feel sad for Naga, she has great potential but the field 
is too strong this year for anyone who isn’t a) brilliant or b) hilarious. But 
if you’re going to go, it might as well be doing a bonkers Charleston dressed 
as a mermaid.

 Craig saves Anastacia and Brendan, as does Darcey and Bruno. Len’s vote 
doesn’t matter, but he agrees anyway.

Pasha gives Naga a huge high five, possibly because he knows he’s got the rest 
of the season off.

Still, Pasha in a sparkly wetsuit is a Sunday night bonus. Naga’s timing is 
still off, and this is riddled with mistakes. I really want Naga to stay, but I 
fear she’s lost it. Bum.

I’ve heard a rumour that Ed and Katya are doing a Rumba next week. You might 
want to bring a cushion.

So who is up against Naga and Pasha in this week’s dance off? Safe to dance 
another week is Danny and Oti (good “I’m so relieved” acting there) along with 
Claudia and AJ, Louise and Kevin, Greg and Natalie and Ed and Katya!

So it’s ANASTACIA AND BRENDAN in the bottom two, and she actually looks 
surprised; does she not know how this show works? No surprise there, but this 
is another dance off that could go either way, both had issues last night.

Nice routine from Neil and Chloe the work experience dancers there. If they 
work very hard and don’t spill Craig’s tea, they might get a proper Strictly 
job next year.

Time for a musical interlude, and this year’s obligatory performance by 
Madness. Suggs looks quite warm. Tea, anyone?

Naga and Pasha do a drunk wedding dance to Never Can Say Goodbye, which is not 
a problem I have, because this is goodbye. Thank you so much to everyone who 
has left comments, it’s the best bit of this blog by a country mile, and very 
much appreciated. I’ll be back next Saturday at 6.35pm for some more liveblog 
fun, and don’t forget Rhik’s Bake Off liveblog on Wednesday. See you next week, 
and keeeep dancing! Hx
 
Which means NAGA AND PASHA are going home, and Anastacia and Brendan live to 
dance another day. I feel sad for Naga, she has great potential but the field 
is too strong this year for anyone who isn’t a) brilliant or b) hilarious. But 
if you’re going to go, it might as well be doing a bonkers Charleston dressed 
as a mermaid.
 
 Craig saves Anastacia and Brendan, as does Darcey and Bruno. Len’s vote 
doesn’t matter, but he agrees anyway.
 
Pasha gives Naga a huge high five, possibly because he knows he’s got the rest 
of the season off.
 
Still, Pasha in a sparkly wetsuit is a Sunday night bonus. Naga’s timing is 
still off, and this is riddled with mistakes. I really want Naga to stay, but I 
fear she’s lost it. Bum.
 
Poor Brendan’s lungs, having to do this again. So much wafting about. 
 
Apparently Neil was dancing with Katya earlier, not Chloe. Sorry, I wasn’t 
really paying attention.
 
I’ve heard a rumour that Ed and Katya are doing a Rumba next week. You might 
want to bring a cushion.
 
So who is up against Naga and Pasha in this week’s dance off? Safe to dance 
another week is Danny and Oti (good “I’m so relieved” acting there) along with 
Claudia and AJ, Louise and Kevin, Greg and Natalie and Ed and Katya!

So it’s ANASTACIA AND BRENDAN in the bottom two, and she actually looks
