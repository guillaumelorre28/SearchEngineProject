Citymapper


For a long time, whenever I was spotted using Google Maps to navigate London’s 
public transport network a friend would look over and prod: “Oh, don’t you use 
Citymapper?” Eventually, I relented.

 City mapper citymapper.com (iOS) 
Comprehensive, easy to use and also playful, Citymapper offers more detailed 
journey planner information than Google, including real-time departures and 
disruption alerts, as well as Uber integration and cycle routes. It is 
available in around 30 cities worldwide, with all the obvious city-break 
destinations covered. It even tells you how long your journey will take by 
jetpack – useless information really, but hopefully something to cheer you up 
when your train is cancelled.

Over 70 million people have registered with Duolingo, a free and incredibly 
well-designed language learning app. Though not a replacement for proper 
language tuition, the app is a fun way to get the basics, or to keep yourself 
fresh on grammar and vocabulary, before a trip abroad. Just like a computer 
game, the app guides you through levels that you need to complete before 
advancing, and you gain experience points along the way.

XE is the go-to site for currency conversions on the web, so it’s no surprise 
that its app is so popular: with over 20 million downloads since launch. It has 
lots of business-oriented features, such as rates for precious metals and 
historic currency charts, but for the traveller it is most useful for the 
simple fact that it’s able to convert every world currency. It also functions 
offline by saving the last updated rates, which is great if you’re in a place 
with limited connectivity or trying to save on data.

A bit like a pocket travel agent, Tripit pulls together travel information 
from your confirmation emails for flights, hotels, rental cars, events bookings 
and converts it into a single itinerary. Just forward your emails to the app 
and it will do the rest. If you’re travelling with others you can easily share 
the plans, making this a useful app for coordinating a group trip.

nice touch for longer, multi-destination trips is that all currencies are

Not exactly slick by name, though certainly slick by nature, App in the Air is 
a smart, straightforward, flight tracking app that has the best coverage of 
airlines and airports. It will keep you updated about flight status – even if 
you don’t have internet coverage – and helps you manage your time at the 
airport, breaking down each flight into four stages; check in, boarding, 
takeoff and landing time. It also integrates with Tripit (above) allowing you 
to import all your flights.

This translator can be a useful tool to support your own, more serious 
language learning, but realistically, it’s most useful on a practical level 
quickly translating day-to-day words you come across on your travels. For 
example, you can hold your camera up to text – such as a sign, or a menu – and 
Google will translate it for you instantly. It’s an essential app for any 
traveller.

This ambitious app creates a digital journal of your travels so you can look 
back on your trips on an interactive map. The app tracks you as you go, marking 
a red line along a map on the exact route you take; the app also monitors your 
speed and altitude, making it great for adventure travellers, though it’s just 
as fun to look back at your route around a city. You can add pictures, video, 
audio and text along the way, creating a multimedia travel diary you can share.

There are a few apps out there that help you manage your time in the sun 
safely, but this one offers the most detailed information to keep you informed. 
You enter your skin type and it calculates how long you can spend sunning 
yourself before getting burned, based on the time of day, where you are and the 
strength of sun cream you’re wearing. It also provides UV forecasts for your 
location.

When you’re done browsing Guardian Travel, of course, the Time Out app is a 
great directory of ideas of things to do in cities around the world. With 
coverage from Accra to Amsterdam, Edinburgh to Singapore, the app covers 
everything from bars, restaurants, attractions and events. The event finder is 
a particularly useful tool, meaning you’ll never struggle to find the most 
popular concerts, festivals or one-off happenings going on around you. You can 
also book restaurants and concert tickets through the app and create a 
customised travel guide for your holiday.
