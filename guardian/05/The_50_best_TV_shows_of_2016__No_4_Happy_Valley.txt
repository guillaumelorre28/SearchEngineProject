the two series of Happy Valley are writer Sally Wainwright’s masterpieces. The 
second series, broadcast this year, was arguably even better than the 
astonishing first. The violence was less bloody, but Wainwright’s pitiless 
examination of the human condition as it plays out in the Calder Valley was 
bleaker, more brutal and even braver than the first time round.

As ever in Wainwright’s work, women were – simply, unapologetically, vitally – 
at the heart of it. Sarah Lancashire was the lynchpin again, of course, as 
Sergeant Catherine Cawood, stoically shouldering burden upon burden in the 
absence of any alternative.

A mother killed her son when she found out he was a murderer. She asked him if 
voices told him to do it, but he said no, so she told him to think about 
Disneyland and fetched the farm’s shotgun. When Cawood arrived, she could see 
the woman had had no alternative either, took her in her arms and arrested her 
as they curled up on the doorstep together. It was quintessential Cawood, 
quintessential Lancashire and quintessential Wainwright – unshowy, 
unsentimental, psychologically acute and painful beyond words.

Likewise, the eventual meeting between Cawood and Frances, the woman being 
manipulated by last season’s villain, rapist Tommy Lee Royce (the proximate 
cause of Catherine’s daughter’s suicide), into brainwashing Cawood’s grandson – 
Royce’s son – and planning to firebomb her home. The stage was set for a grand, 
flashy denouement. Instead, we got Cawood excavating another layer of her soul 
and finding it within her to treat Frances as another of Royce’s victims – then 
try to restore her. In contrast to the boat-burning and near-immolation of 
three main characters at the end of season one, their confrontation (“If he 
looked like Ian Brady, Peter Sutcliffe, Jimmy Savile or some other sad, twisted 
fuck,” Catherine urged, “would you believe a single word he said?”) barely 
deployed a raised voice. It was as richly satisfying and devastating as you 
could have hoped. And it was a narrative decision by Wainwright as brave as the 
heroine it served.

There was a more standard secondary plot about an “accidental” murderer and a 
tertiary one about human trafficking that will presumably be picked up in the 
third series, which has been greenlit. But the business of the thing was really 
that most fertile, overlooked field of human drama, the lives of middle-aged 
women – which, despite always having been where many of our most compelling 
stories can be found, are routinely ignored. But who else is so central to 
others’ lives? Who else is old enough to have the experience? So here is 
Catherine, bone-weary, her resources depleted by suffering, standing silently 
at the end, looking down the valley at her grandson, knowing that life is, in 
essence, shit and success counts as shovelling enough of it out of your way 
before it buries you and everyone else.

It’s bracing. In fact, I go so far as to call it almost uplifting. In a world 
full of shiny dramas whose characters don’t feel rounded, watching Wainwright’s 
people endure their tragedies then keep on, just as they would in real life, is 
a glorious, restorative sight. They carry on with their jobs – maybe 
tighter-lipped than before – cracking jokes, making meals and looking after 
their families, with grief in the background, punctuated by occasional moments 
of joy, trying their best to solve the problem of how to be good in a bad 
world. What else, asks Wainwright, are you going to do? She knows that giving 
up is a luxury ordinary people can’t afford.
