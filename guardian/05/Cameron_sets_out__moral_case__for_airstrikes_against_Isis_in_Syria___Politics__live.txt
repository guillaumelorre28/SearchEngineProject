Afternoon summary

 * David Cameron has begun the delicate process of persuading sceptical Labour 
MPs to back airstrikes in Syria, saying the UK was already facing the threat of 
mass casualties from Isis and arguing that Britain could not outsource its 
security to allies. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/26/david-cameron-persuading-labour-mps-back-syria-airstrikes>
 * Labour MPs have been lobbied to vote against UK airstrikes in Syria by 
members of staff in the party’s whips’ office before the shadow cabinet has 
decided whether to allow a free vote on the issue. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/26/labour-whip-email-vote-against-syria-airstrikes>
AsPatrick Wintour reports, MPs objected to receiving emails from the staff of 
an MP in the Labour whips office urging them to vote against bombing in Syria, 
sent shortly before David Cameron held a House of Commons debate on the 
proposals.The email, which was sent out by a member of staff working for Graeme 
Morris, the Labour MP and a whip, was allegedly drafted with the knowledge of 
the Labour leader’s office. 
 * George Osborne will be forced to raise taxes or announce more spending cuts 
if the brighter picture of the public finances presented at the autumn 
statement proves to be unfounded, the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/26/autumn-statement-ifs-warns-on-tax-rises-spending-cuts-george-osborne>
 * David Cameron’s hopes of securing a new basis before Christmas for keeping 
Britain in the European Union are fading, according to his closest ally in the 
EU, amid strong signs that it will be next February before the prime minister 
is able to finalise new membership terms to be put to a referendum. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/26/cameron-eu-membership-deal-december-deadline-referendum>
“I am not sure we will get to a conclusion in December. That has to be seen,” 
said Mark Rutte, the prime minister of theNetherlands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands>, Ian Traynor reports. “At least 
we should be able to make a very serious start.” 
 * Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, unlawfully 
discriminated against disabled people by failing to exempt their carers from 
the benefit cap, a High Court judge has ruled. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/26/iain-duncan-smith-unlawfully-dicriminated-against-the-disabled-rules-judge>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

There were more questions about Syria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>
 at the afternoon Number 10 lobby briefing (although not so many answers). Here 
are the main points.

 * The prime minister’s spokesman said the claim that there are 70,000 
moderate Syrian opposition fighters is “based on the best intelligence analysis 
that we have”.Earlier some MPs said they did not accept it. (See 2.33pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/26/cameron-statement-syria-isis-air-strikes-not-a-sign-of-weakness-politics-live#block-565709c1e4b07a3a3b752021>
 * The spokesman would not say when a vote might be held. David Cameron now 
wanted to allow MPs time to reflect on the arguments put forward, the spokesman 
said. 
 * The spokesman refused to define what Cameron meant when he said he wanted a 
“clear majority”.(See 2.33pm.)

George Eaton has a good account of the shadow cabinet meeting on his New 
Statesman blog. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/2015/11/majority-shadow-cabinet-back-air-strikes-syria-labour-position-undecided>
 He says it started with Jeremy Corbyn saying he was unequivocally opposed to 
military action. Here’s an extract.

A majority of members are prepared to support military action, according to 
those present, but Jeremy Corbyn is not. At the start of the 75 minute meeting, 
the Labour leader read out a prepared statement stating his unconditional 
opposition to air strikes. He was supported by shadow international development 
secretary Diane Abbott, who said that she would never vote to send the armed 
forces to war, shadow communities secretary Jon Trickett and Parliamentary 
Labour Party chair John Cryer (who added that he was prepared to back the 
shadow cabinet’s collective view). Shadow chancellorJohn McDonnell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> did not speak but has 
previously stated his opposition to air strikes.

The remainder, however, either favour or are prepared to support military 
action. Following Corbyn’s statement, shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn 
spoke, arguing that the testsLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> had set for intervention (such as 
a UN resolution) had been met and that Cameron had made a “compelling” case for 
air strikes. He was supported by deputy leader Tom Watson, who reminded the 
shadow cabinet that he had rebelled over Libya in 2013 and emphasised the 
atrocities committed by Isis in Syria. He called for the party to reach a 
collective decision.

The Stop the War Coalition (which used to be chaired by Jeremy Corbyn, until 
he stood down just after his election as Labour leader) has issued a 
seven-point rebuttal of Cameron’s Syria document. It says bombing Isis in Syria 
will do “nothing to weaken Isis but will instead inflame the civil war, deepen 
the misery of the Syrian people and increase the terrorist risk.”

Cameron's statement - Summary and analysis

Have you noticed how no one is calling it a dossier?

David Cameron’s 36-page document  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/480073/PM_Response_to_FAC.pdf>
is certainly dossier-length but, as he stressed repeatedly in his marathon 
Commons performance, he wants to avoid making the mistakes Tony Blair made in 
2003 and he was doing everything he could to avoid hyperbole as he made the 
argument for Britain joining air strikes against Islamic State (Isis, or Isil) 
in Syria.

As a Commons performance it was first-class. He was polite, intelligent, 
reasonable, and not once did he strike a wrong note. In particular, he was 
reaching out to Labour (claiming that he had satisfied the conditions set out 
in the motion on Syria passed at theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> conference) and at no point did 
indulge in partisan point-scoring. Liam Fox, the hawkish Conservative former 
defence secretary who is no Cameron fan, thinks it was his finest hour.
Dr Liam Fox MP (@LiamFoxMP) 
This debate may be @David_Cameron <https://twitter.com/David_Cameron>'s finest 
moment as Prime Minister#Syria <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Syria?src=hash>

<https://twitter.com/LiamFoxMP/status/669857631142436864> 
But is Cameron the winning the argument?

He is certainly making progress. In the Commons several Tories stood up to 
announce that, although they were opposed to air strikes in the past, they are 
now in favour.

Yet the “not a dossier” does not clinch the argument, as my colleagues Ewen 
MacAskill (see 12.10pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/26/cameron-statement-syria-isis-air-strikes-not-a-sign-of-weakness-politics-live#block-5656f509e4b0ca2d8ef015d9>
 and Rafael Behr (see1.18pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/26/cameron-statement-syria-isis-air-strikes-not-a-sign-of-weakness-politics-live#block-56570598e4b010de12915ca2>
 point out. Some of the assumptions that Cameron is making about what might 
happen if Isis loses its grip on Raqqa are closer to flimsy than robust and, 
even as he summoned all his charm and authority, he could not persuade MPs 
otherwise. Last week one unnamed minister reportedly said a Commons vote in 
favour of air strikes was “in the bag”. Today it did not feel like that. Even 
though it is assumed that dozens of Labour MPs would prefer to vote in favour, 
hardly any of them explicitly backed Cameron this morning and the mood was very 
different from Tuesday last week when they were queuing up to disown Jeremy 
Corbyn over security matters. Cameron seemed genuinely unsure as to whether he 
would win - at one point he talked about if a vote takes place, not when - and 
everything now seems to depend on what Labour does. Corbyn strongly implied 
that the party would not back air strikes with his blessing. Perhaps the shadow 
cabinet will over-rule him, or perhaps there will be a free vote. In those 
circumstances, the Commons will probably vote for air strikes next week. But if 
Labour decides not to support the government, and Cameron has to rely on Labour 
rebels, it starts to look much more uncertain.

Here are the main points.

 * Cameron said that he would only hold a vote on air strikes against Isis in 
Syria if he believes there is a “clear majority” in favour. 
There will not be a vote in this House unless there is a clear majority for 
action, because we will not hand a publicity coup to Isil.

 * He said that Isis would grow stronger unless Britain took action against it 
in Syria. 
Every day we fail to act is a day when Isil can grow stronger and more plots 
can be undertaken ...

All the advice I have received – the military advice, the diplomatic advice 
and the security advice – all says yes, that the risks of inaction are 
greater.Some have asked specifically whether taking action could make the UK 
more of a target for Isil attacks.

 * He said intelligence chiefs said Britain was already a top-tier Isis target.
The judgement of the director general of the security service [MI5] and the 
chairman of joint intelligence committee is that the UK is already in the top 
tier of countries that ISIL is targeting.

 * He said Britain would contribute at least £1bn to post-conflict 
reconstruction in Syria. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, expressed considerable scepticism about 
bombing Isis in Syria.While not explicitly ruling it out, he used his response 
to Cameron 
<http://labourlist.org/2015/11/corbyns-7-questions-for-cameron-over-syria-intervention/>
 to raise seven questions about Cameron’s plans, and he implied air strikes 
would increase, not decrease, the threat from Isis. 
There is no doubt that the so-called Islamic State 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> group has imposed a reign of terror on 
millions in Iraq, Syria and Libya. All that ISIS stands for and does is 
contrary to everything those of us on these benches have struggled for over 
generations.

And there is no doubt that it poses a threat to our own people.

The question must now be whether extending the UK bombing from Iraq to Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> is likely to reduce, or increase, 
that threat and whether it will counter, or spread, the terror campaign ISIS is 
waging in the Middle East.

 * Julian Lewis, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, 
questioned Cameron’s claim that there were 70,000 moderate opposition fighters 
in Syria able to take over the ground currently held by Isis. Lewis said: 
The suggestion there are 70,000 non-Islamist, moderate, credible ground 
forces, I have to say, is a revelation to me and I suspect most other MPs in 
this House.

Some other Tories made a similar point, including the former cabinet minister 
Peter Lilley who told Cameron:

I want you to convince me that what you refer to as the Free Syrian Army 
actually exists rather than is a label we apply to a rag-bag group of clans and 
tribal forces with no coherent force.

Cameron insisted that the 70,000 figure came from the joint intelligence 
committee, not from him. He said that he was very anxious not to overstate the 
case, and he suggested intelligence chiefs could give evidence to a Commons 
committee if MPs wanted more information about this claim.

 * Cameron said that the arguments in his case for bombing Isis in Syria 
addressed the conditions set for supporting military action in the motion on 
this passed by the Labour conference. He mentioned the Labour conference motion 
twice, unlike Labour MPs, who did not refer to it. 
 * The SNP signalled that it would vote against air strikes, while the DUP 
signalled it would vote in favour.

David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has finally 
finished his statement. He took questions from 103 backbenchers, and was on his 
feet for two hours and 45 minutes. That must be a near record for a ministerial 
statement.

I will post a summary soon.

Rafael Behr

My colleague Rafael Behr has written a point-by-point analysis of the answers 
Cameron has given to the seven questions raised by the foreign affairs 
committee. Here is his article.

Does Cameron's seven-point case for Syrian airstrikes stand up?
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/26/syria-airstrike-case-david-cameron-seven-points-analysis>
And here is an extract - Rafael’s take on Cameron’s response to the question 
about who will hold the ground after Isis have been bombed.

The boots-on-the-ground conundrum. The lesson from past interventions in Iraq 
and Libya, for example, is that jihadi terrorism thrives in a power vacuum, so 
there is little sense in striking inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> to degrade Isis without confidence 
that some other force, more amenable to peace and civil reconstruction, can 
move in under the cover of airstrikes.

Cameron makes some brave assumptions here about the capabilities of the Syrian 
opposition and extrapolates very optimistically from limited progress made by 
Kurdish forces so far. This is the weakest link in his chain – an expression of 
wishful thinking and heroic ambition as much as a credible argument. It is hard 
to avoid the impression that he is deferring this aspect of the strategy, by 
far the trickiest one, until after the Tornados are in the air. But history 
suggests convenient deferral of this kind of plan is a fatal flaw – a 
shoot-from-the-hip response that undermines even the very best of intentions. A 
major cause for concern.

Mike Kane, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, says 
MPs in the Commons are concerned about the “winnability” issue - whether Isis 
will be beaten on the ground.

Cameron says “losability” is an issue too; he says it is important to take 
action now.

Labour’s Albert Owen says since becoming an MP he has been asked to vote for 
military action four times. Sometimes he has voted yes, and sometimes no. If 
bombing increases the number of refugees fromSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, will Cameron increase the number 
allowed into the UK?

Cameron says the government has set out its plans, but will keep them under 
review. He wants to make progress, and take 1,000 refugees by Christmas.

 * David Cameron has begun the delicate process of persuading sceptical Labour 
MPs to back airstrikes in Syria, saying the UK was already facing the threat of 
mass casualties from Isis and arguing that Britain could not outsource its 
security to allies.

AsPatrick Wintour reports, MPs objected to receiving emails from the staff of 
an MP in the Labour whips office urging them to vote against bombing in Syria, 
sent shortly before David Cameron held a House of Commons debate on the 
proposals.The email, which was sent out by a member of staff working for Graeme 
Morris, the Labour MP and a whip, was allegedly drafted with the knowledge of 
the Labour leader’s office.

There were more questions about Syria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>
 at the afternoon Number 10 lobby briefing (although not so many answers). Here 
are the main points.

 * The prime minister’s spokesman said the claim that there are 70,000 
moderate Syrian opposition fighters is “based on the best intelligence analysis 
that we have”.Earlier some MPs said they did not accept it. (See 2.33pm.)

 * The spokesman would not say when a vote might be held. David Cameron now 
wanted to allow MPs time to reflect on the arguments put forward, the spokesman 
said. 
 * The spokesman refused to define what Cameron meant when he said he wanted a 
“clear majority”.(See 2.33pm.)

George Eaton has a good account of the shadow cabinet meeting on his New 
Statesman blog. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/2015/11/majority-shadow-cabinet-back-air-strikes-syria-labour-position-undecided>
 He says it started with Jeremy Corbyn saying he was unequivocally opposed to 
military action. Here’s an extract.

A majority of members are prepared to support military action, according to 
those present, but Jeremy Corbyn is not. At the start of the 75 minute meeting, 
the Labour leader read out a prepared statement stating his unconditional 
opposition to air strikes. He was supported by shadow international development 
secretary Diane Abbott, who said that she would never vote to send the armed 
forces to war, shadow communities secretary Jon Trickett and Parliamentary 
Labour Party chair John Cryer (who added that he was prepared to back the 
shadow cabinet’s collective view). Shadow chancellorJohn McDonnell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> did not speak but has 
previously stated his opposition to air strikes.

The remainder, however, either favour or are prepared to support military 
action. Following Corbyn’s statement, shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn 
spoke, arguing that the testsLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> had set for intervention (such as 
a UN resolution) had been met and that Cameron had made a “compelling” case for 
air strikes. He was supported by deputy leader Tom Watson, who reminded the 
shadow cabinet that he had rebelled over Libya in 2013 and emphasised the 
atrocities committed by Isis in Syria. He called for the party to reach a 
collective decision.
 
The shadow cabinet has been meeting today to discuss Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>. According to ITV’s Chris Ship, a 
majority of members are in favour, but the shadow cabinet has not yet taken a 
decision as to what the party should do. It will meet again on Monday.

The Stop the War Coalition (which used to be chaired by Jeremy Corbyn, until 
he stood down just after his election as Labour leader) has issued a 
seven-point rebuttal of Cameron’s Syria document. It says bombing Isis in Syria 
will do “nothing to weaken Isis but will instead inflame the civil war, deepen 
the misery of the Syrian people and increase the terrorist risk.”

Have you noticed how no one is calling it a dossier?

David Cameron’s 36-page document  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/480073/PM_Response_to_FAC.pdf>
is certainly dossier-length but, as he stressed repeatedly in his marathon 
Commons performance, he wants to avoid making the mistakes Tony Blair made in 
2003 and he was doing everything he could to avoid hyperbole as he made the 
argument for Britain joining air strikes against Islamic State (Isis, or Isil) 
in Syria.

As a Commons performance it was first-class. He was polite, intelligent, 
reasonable, and not once did he strike a wrong note. In particular, he was 
reaching out to Labour (claiming that he had satisfied the conditions set out 
in the motion on Syria passed at theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> conference) and at no point did 
indulge in partisan point-scoring. Liam Fox, the hawkish Conservative former 
defence secretary who is no Cameron fan, thinks it was his finest hour.

But is Cameron the winning the argument?

He is certainly making progress. In the Commons several Tories stood up to 
announce that, although they were opposed to air strikes in the past, they are 
now in favour.

Yet the “not a dossier” does not clinch the argument, as my colleagues Ewen 
MacAskill (see 12.10pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/26/cameron-statement-syria-isis-air-strikes-not-a-sign-of-weakness-politics-live#block-5656f509e4b0ca2d8ef015d9>
 and Rafael Behr (see1.18pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/26/cameron-statement-syria-isis-air-strikes-not-a-sign-of-weakness-politics-live#block-56570598e4b010de12915ca2>
 point out. Some of the assumptions that Cameron is making about what might 
happen if Isis loses its grip on Raqqa are closer to flimsy than robust and, 
even as he summoned all his charm and authority, he could not persuade MPs 
otherwise. Last week one unnamed minister reportedly said a Commons vote in 
favour of air strikes was “in the bag”. Today it did not feel like that. Even 
though it is assumed that dozens of Labour MPs would prefer to vote in favour, 
hardly any of them explicitly backed Cameron this morning and the mood was very 
different from Tuesday last week when they were queuing up to disown Jeremy 
Corbyn over security matters. Cameron seemed genuinely unsure as to whether he 
would win - at one point he talked about if a vote takes place, not when - and 
everything now seems to depend on what Labour does. Corbyn strongly implied 
that the party would not back air strikes with his blessing. Perhaps the shadow 
cabinet will over-rule him, or perhaps there will be a free vote. In those 
circumstances, the Commons will probably vote for air strikes next week. But if 
Labour decides not to support the government, and Cameron has to rely on Labour 
rebels, it starts to look much more uncertain.

Here are the main points.

 * Cameron said that he would only hold a vote on air strikes against Isis in 
Syria if he believes there is a “clear majority” in favour. 
There will not be a vote in this House unless there is a clear majority for 
action, because we will not hand a publicity coup to Isil.

 * He said that Isis would grow stronger unless Britain took action against it 
in Syria. 
Every day we fail to act is a day when Isil can grow stronger and more plots 
can be undertaken ...

All the advice I have received – the military advice, the diplomatic advice 
and the security advice – all says yes, that the risks of inaction are 
greater.Some have asked specifically whether taking action could make the UK 
more of a target for Isil attacks.

 * He said intelligence chiefs said Britain was already a top-tier Isis target.
The judgement of the director general of the security service [MI5] and the 
chairman of joint intelligence committee is that the UK is already in the top 
tier of countries that ISIL is targeting.

 * He said Britain would contribute at least £1bn to post-conflict 
reconstruction in Syria. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, expressed considerable scepticism about 
bombing Isis in Syria.While not explicitly ruling it out, he used his response 
to Cameron 
<http://labourlist.org/2015/11/corbyns-7-questions-for-cameron-over-syria-intervention/>
 to raise seven questions about Cameron’s plans, and he implied air strikes 
would increase, not decrease, the threat from Isis. 
There is no doubt that the so-called Islamic State 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> group has imposed a reign of terror on 
millions in Iraq, Syria and Libya. All that ISIS stands for and does is 
contrary to everything those of us on these benches have struggled for over 
generations.

And there is no doubt that it poses a threat to our own people.

The question must now be whether extending the UK bombing from Iraq to Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> is likely to reduce, or increase, 
that threat and whether it will counter, or spread, the terror campaign ISIS is 
waging in the Middle East.

 * Julian Lewis, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, 
questioned Cameron’s claim that there were 70,000 moderate opposition fighters 
in Syria able to take over the ground currently held by Isis. Lewis said: 
The suggestion there are 70,000 non-Islamist, moderate, credible ground 
forces, I have to say, is a revelation to me and I suspect most other MPs in 
this House.

Some other Tories made a similar point, including the former cabinet minister 
Peter Lilley who told Cameron:

I want you to convince me that what you refer to as the Free Syrian Army 
actually exists rather than is a label we apply to a rag-bag group of clans and 
tribal forces with no coherent force.

Cameron insisted that the 70,000 figure came from the joint intelligence 
committee, not from him. He said that he was very anxious not to overstate the 
case, and he suggested intelligence chiefs could give evidence to a Commons 
committee if MPs wanted more information about this claim.

 * Cameron said that the arguments in his case for bombing Isis in Syria 
addressed the conditions set for supporting military action in the motion on 
this passed by the Labour conference. He mentioned the Labour conference motion 
twice, unlike Labour MPs, who did not refer to it. 
 * The SNP signalled that it would vote against air strikes, while the DUP 
signalled it would vote in favour.

David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has finally 
finished his statement. He took questions from 103 backbenchers, and was on his 
feet for two hours and 45 minutes. That must be a near record for a ministerial 
statement.

I will post a summary soon.
 
My colleague Rafael Behr has written a point-by-point analysis of the answers 
Cameron has given to the seven questions raised by the foreign affairs 
committee. Here is his article.

Does Cameron's seven-point case for Syrian airstrikes stand up?
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/26/syria-airstrike-case-david-cameron-seven-points-analysis>
And here is an extract - Rafael’s take on Cameron’s response to the question 
about who will hold the ground after Isis have been bombed.

The boots-on-the-ground conundrum. The lesson from past interventions in Iraq 
and Libya, for example, is that jihadi terrorism thrives in a power vacuum, so 
there is little sense in striking inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> to degrade Isis without confidence 
that some other force, more amenable to peace and civil reconstruction, can 
move in under the cover of airstrikes.

Cameron makes some brave assumptions here about the capabilities of the Syrian 
opposition and extrapolates very optimistically from limited progress made by 
Kurdish forces so far. This is the weakest link in his chain – an expression of 
wishful thinking and heroic ambition as much as a credible argument. It is hard 
to avoid the impression that he is deferring this aspect of the strategy, by 
far the trickiest one, until after the Tornados are in the air. But history 
suggests convenient deferral of this kind of plan is a fatal flaw – a 
shoot-from-the-hip response that undermines even the very best of intentions. A 
major cause for concern.
 
Mike Kane, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, says 
MPs in the Commons are concerned about the “winnability” issue - whether Isis 
will be beaten on the ground.

Cameron says “losability” is an issue too; he says it is important to take 
action now.
 
Andrew Slaughter, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, 
asks Cameron if he agrees that anything that sustains Assad in power would be 
unacceptable.

Cameron says the government wants to help the Syrian opposition currently 
fighting.
 
Steve McCabe, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, 
asks what will happen if the Free Syrian Army cannot take Raqqa.

Cameron says he will come back to the Commons regularly to update MPs. “We are 
not dealing with perfection,” he says.
 
Tommy Shepphard, the SNP MP, asks if Cameron thinks Isis can be beaten on the 
grounds without the help of the Syrian army.

Cameron says he envisages the Syrian opposition fighters taking over.
 
Labour’s Albert Owen says since becoming an MP he has been asked to vote for 
military action four times. Sometimes he has voted yes, and sometimes no. If 
bombing increases the number of refugees fromSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, will Cameron increase the number 
allowed into the UK?

Cameron says the government has set out its plans, but will keep them under 
review. He wants to make progress, and take 1,000 refugees by Christmas.
 
Kevin Brennan, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, 
says he voted against air stikes in Syria in 2013. Will British bombing replace 
less accurate bombing?

Cameron says that is exactly what he is proposing.
 
George Kerevan, the SNP MP, asks when there might be a ceasefire in Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>.

Cameron says we cannot afford to wait until there is a settlement in Syria 
before acting against Isis.
