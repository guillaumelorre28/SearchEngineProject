From posing as Sid Vicious to dabbling in psychoanalysis, the not-so-Young 
British Artist has long put himself in the picture. But there’s a dry wit to 
his work that makes it more than mere posturing; his sense of reality is tough 
and thought-provoking. Those who made British art famous in the 90s are often 
unfairly dismissed, so it’s good to see Damien Hirst showcase one of his 
contemporaries at his gallery.

These Austria-born artists of the Romantic era portrayed nature with 
sensitivity and scientific rigour. Working when Linnaeus’s system of 
classifying species had brought a new discipline to natural history, the Bauers 
were at the forefront of scientific art. Franz worked at Kew Gardens making 
accurate studies of orchids and drawing microscopic phenomena, while Ferdinand 
explored Australia as a ship’s artist. Their detailed images are marvels of 
discovery.

Glasgow 
Martin Boyce creates places halfway between the lost utopias of early 
20th-century avant-garde architecture and derelict old playgrounds. These 
abstract yet all too brutally real worlds are vaguely threatening and 
electrically exciting. Above all, he captures the feel of city life; streets 
and parks poised between optimism and despair. This is the modern art of modern 
Britain, and it stays in your mind like a rusty nail in the foot.

Artist Christopher Jarratt worked with Sheffield social enterprise Green 
Estate on this bold experiment in community and craft. Youngsters designed and 
built their own seaworthy boat, with designer Paul Reardon and carpenter Tom 
Collier helping to make the dream a reality. The resulting canoe symbolises 
their effort and skill, with the project documented here from sketches to 
maiden voyage.

 Wynford Dewhurst’s Evening Shadows Photograph: Dan Brown 
The impressionists frequented places where they could paint modern 
middle-class pleasure: cafes by the Seine, gardens, the beaches of Normandy 
and... Manchester? Yes, it’s true: Dewhurst published the first 
English-language book on the movement in 1904, and claimed that it was secretly 
British anyway, because Turner did it all first. His own art was an 
enthusiastic attempt to ape Monet. Of course, by the time Dewhurst had 
discovered the style, the French had already moved on.
