A lecturer who lost an unfair dismissal case after claiming he had been 
bullied out of his job at Scotland's oldest university today launched an appeal.

Declan Quigley took St Andrews University to an industrial tribunal after 
quitting his post as a lecturer in the social anthropology department in 2002.

An employment tribunal rejected his claim for unfair dismissal. 

Today his lawyer, Catherine Callaghan, argued there were grounds to appeal 
against that decision, which was reached in 2004.

She explained there were 10 incidents Mr Quigley had claimed amounted to a 
breach of his contract.

The original tribunal had rejected those claims but Ms Callaghan argued it had 
failed to consider the effect of the incidents together.

She said: "Even though you may have individual incidents which themselves do 
not amount to a breach of contract, cumulatively they may do so."

She also claimed that the two-months between the last of these incidents and 
Mr Quigley's resignation was not too long a gap in a case of constructive 
dismissal.

Ms Callaghan pointed out to an employment appeal tribunal in Edinburgh that Mr 
Quigley was an academic in a highly specialised field.

She said: "Positions are hard to come by and resignation would almost 
certainly spell the end of an academic career."

Ms Callaghan also explained to the appeal tribunal that her client had had to 
wait to see a union lawyer.

Moreover, she added, colleagues at the university had encouraged him to stay. 

"Members of the university had encouraged the appellant not to resign," she 
said.

"Where that two months delay was attributable to a problem getting an 
appointment with the solicitor, where you do have the employer at a certain 
time encouraging the appellant to stay and where you have the kind of role one 
would not ordinarily resign from, it's perverse for the tribunal to find that 
the two-month delay was too long."
