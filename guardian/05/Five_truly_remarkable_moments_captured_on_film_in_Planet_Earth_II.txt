tens of millions of people worldwide have watched and cheered as the hatchling 
iguanas scrambled to escape the snakes – and just a few of them made it.

On a tiny island off Panama, a male pygmy three-toed sloth can hear the call 
of a female – the problem is, she’s on another island. There’s nothing for it 
but to swim. Slowly.

The producers called it “pee-mail” – the messages rarely seen snow leopards

Young ibex in the Arabian peninsula have to clamber down terrifyingly steep 
slopes to reach water. But a fox is waiting, so there’s no time to take it
