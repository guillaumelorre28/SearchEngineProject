Nutritionists recommend that we eat a third of our diet raw, which in reality 
is a tall order – even in summer when the produce is younger and doesn't need 
much, if any, cooking. Come the darker months, it's nigh-on impossible, but 
this slaw is a great way to get that goodness: nutritious, tasty and colourful 
to boot.

Serves 3–4

1 apple, quartered, cored and sliced
¼ of a small celeriac, peeled and grated
1 carrot, grated
1 raw beetroot, grated
1 stick of celery, sliced thinly
200g red cabbage, thinly sliced (ie a couple of handfuls)
1 dill pickle, chopped
A small handful of sultanas
4 tbsp red wine vinegar
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Salt and black pepper

1. Prepare the apple and vegetables.

2. Put the sultanas in a small pan with half the vinegar and simmer for just a 
few minutes until the liquid is all gone.

3. Mix all the ingredients together and dress with the rest of the vinegar, 
the olive oil and some seasoning.
