Colin Firth <https://www.theguardian.com/film/colin-firth> almost missed out 
on the leading role that launched his acting career because his hair was 
thought to be too ginger.

Firth became a British heartthrob overnight after his portrayal of Mr Darcy in 
the 1995BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> adaptation of Jane Austen’s 
Pride and Prejudice.

Firth – who won an Oscar for his portrayal of King George VI in The King’s 
Speech in 2010 – was backed by BBC producer Sue Birtwistle during casting, 
according to Davies.

Speaking at an Andrew Davies in Conversation event at the BFI to mark his 80th 
birthday andthe release of a collection of his dramas on the BBC Store 
<https://store.bbc.com/collections/andrew-davies-originals>, the Welsh-born 
writer said: “With Colin I was a bit doubtful because of his colouring at the 
time because he didn’t have those dark curls back then.”

He added: “Sue was absolutely convinced that he would be wonderful but we said 
he had to go dark and he did go dark.

“He’s stayed dark ever since so he must have liked it.”

Asked what Firth’s hair had looked like before he appeared in Davies’ 
adaptation, the writer said: “Underneath all that he’s sort of fairly ginger.”
