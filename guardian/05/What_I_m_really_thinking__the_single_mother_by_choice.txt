I can see you’re baffled. You’re thinking, “But you’re not bad-looking, you 
have a good job, surely you could have found a nice man and had a proper 
family? You’re not that old, couldn’t you have just waited a bit longer and had 
it all?”

You like telling me how hard my life must be. How alone I am, as if I live on 
a desert island. Some of you refer to my daughter and me as a couple. Others 
say it’s not natural, as if my daughter has been scientifically created like
Dolly the sheep

I think it would be easier for a lot of people if I’d had a one-night stand or 
been abandoned by a cheating husband; those are easier stereotypes to 
understand – reckless or a victim. I should have waited patiently for Mr Right 
rather than choosing to get pregnant using a sperm donor. I should not have 
been this selfish. My life choices are, it seems, very much up for grabs. The 
failings of the “real” families I see around me are more acceptable.

Whatever next? A woman who is proactive, who chooses this for herself? I am 
the embodiment of a threat to the nuclear family which, as I see it, is hanging 
on by a thread. I didn’t mean to be. I really didn’t see this coming. I just 
decided that, before the ship had sailed, I wanted to be a mother and gave 
myself this gift. At 37, it made sense to me, and still does.

Who knows what the future will bring but I’ll let you into a secret. For now 
it’s just the two of us, my five-year-old daughter and me, and we really 
couldn’t be happier.
