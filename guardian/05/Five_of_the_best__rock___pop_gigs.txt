The LA musician’s shows can be spellbinding affairs, leaning more towards her 
painterly pop side than her avant-garde tendencies. This week’s dates represent 
the singer-songwriter’s biggest UK gigs yet – and quite possibly the most 
sizeable for any artist who’s ever transformed a 1920s recipe book into music.

London, Mon; Manchester, Tue; Gateshead, Wed; Glasgow, Thu; touring to 21 Nov

London singer-songwriter Henson’s live shows are not common affairs due to his 
struggles with anxiety. But this introversion is one of the things that makes 
his fragile guitar and piano compositions so adored by those in the know.

Middle-aged men, pints of warm ale and the sound of the clock being wound back 
to the 1970s might be the first things to come to mind when you think of a 
Teenage Fanclub gig, but have no fear – this is no Brexiteers convention. 
Instead, their latest album Here’s gentle indie rock is full of warmth, empathy 
and other things we probably need a bit more of right now.

Inverness, Tue; Whitley, Wed; Sheffield, Thu; Manchester, Fri; touring to 4 Dec

2016 has been eventful for Brooklyn’s Desiigner. His single Panda topped the 
US charts, he was sampled by Kanye West and became embroiled in controversy 
after he was accused of ripping off fellow rapper Future. That’s not bad going 
for your first release – hopefully this brief visit to the UK will be similarly 
action-packed.

When she first emerged Laura Mvula was wrongly pigeonholed as an MOR soul 
singer in the post-Adele mould. This year’s The Dreaming Room hopefully put 
paid to such misconceptions, a multicoloured record full of shifting choral 
backdrops and inventive rhythms; expect this UK tour to be similarly compelling.
