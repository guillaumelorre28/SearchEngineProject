The chancellor's failure to make any changes to stamp duty on property was 
criticised yesterday, amid warnings that the tax is hindering homebuyers who 
are keen to use the Help to Buy scheme. Estate agents and mortgage lenders had 
called for a change in the structure of the tax, which kicks in at 1% on homes 
costing £125,000 and leaps to 3% on properties worth £250,000 to £500,000. With 
the average UK house price now around £170,000, buyers typically face a £1,700 
bill.

Richard Sexton, of e.surv chartered surveyors, said: "Cutting the duty could 
have helped alleviate the monumental task of saving for a deposit, and 
encouraged market movement."
