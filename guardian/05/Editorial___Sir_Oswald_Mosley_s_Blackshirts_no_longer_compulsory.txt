Sir Oswald Mosley <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oswald-mosley> announces 
some rather striking changes in the organisation of his Fascist movement. It is 
to be divided into two parts - a Blackshirt and a political organisation. 
First, he is going to “preserve, pure and immutable, the fine flame of the 
original Blackshirt movement”; henceforth the uniform is to be reserved for 
those who perform “conspicuous service,” give up at least two evenings a week, 
and submit to a scheme of discipline that is outlined in detail. As a 
concession, the present dress is to be varied and distinctive badges given. For 
those who have not what is called “the dedicated Blackshirt spirit” and who 
have only “the political mind” a looser attachment will be permitted. They will 
be “used for Fascism,” but will not be expected to wear its clothes.

There seem to be various possible explanations for Sir Oswald’s reorganisation 
scheme. He may wish, after his recent experiences, to do a little purging. Or 
he may have found that the uniform is not, after all, an attraction; indeed, he 
almost admits as much. He may have realised that there are two kinds of people, 
those who like dressing themselves up and making themselves conspicuous and 
those who do not. And he may think that if his movement is to survive its 
troubles, if, in fact, it is to have any political future at all, it had better 
allow for the prosaic mass who are ordinary people and not moved by any 
“spiritual passion” for the “brotherhood of Fascism.” Sir Oswald has taken a 
step towards re-entering the Conservative fold, into which Lord Rothermere 
urged him to go months ago.
