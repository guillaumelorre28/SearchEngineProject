Lou on George

What were you hoping for?
Chemistry, and a dreamy evening somewhere lovely.


First impressions?
He looks like a young Frank Sinatra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-sinatra>: handsome, smart and sweet.

What did you talk about?
The joys of being northern, childhood fish murder, global politics and that 
problem withWoody Allen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen>.

Any awkward moments?
He’s not much of a foodie, so perhaps my berating of his penchant for burgers 
with the lads went a bit far.

Good table manners?
Excellent.

Best thing about George?
Really caring and passionate.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
He’s a sweetheart, so I don’t see why not.

Describe him in three words
Handsome, intelligent, compassionate.

What do you think he made of you?
God knows, but I hope he had a nice evening with me.

Did you go on somewhere?
For a couple of cocktails in a lovely bar around the corner.

And... did you kiss?
Just a peck on the cheek to say good night.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I think we both knew there was no spark.

Marks out of 10?
7.

Would you meet again?
Perhaps as friends. He was sweet and interesting and we had a lot in common, 
but there was no chemistry.
