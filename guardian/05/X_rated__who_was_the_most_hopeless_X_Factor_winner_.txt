Steve Brookstein <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2Tv1e8t7DI>


In 2016, the public would probably vote a man as slimy, offensive and 
dislikable as Steve Brookstein to be the next prime minister. Back in 2004 we 
just let him win a talent show. Brookstein boasted a career arc that could have 
given Richard III vertigo, clambering his way to X Factor victory before a flop 
second album reached an impressively crap No 165 in the UK charts. He has spent 
the decade since repeatedly failing to become the next Katie Hopkins (sample

: “Oh, look a bitchy homosexual. You don’t get many of those on Twitter”) while 
whining about not being respected as a serious recording artist, despite the 
fact he VOLUNTARILY ENTERED A TV POP COMPETITION DEVISED BY SIMON COWELL.
Last seen: In 2014, Brookstein put out a book called Getting Over the X 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/05/steve-brookstein-x-factor-interview-simon-cowell-is-irrelevant>

High point: Steve Brookstein won series one of the UK X Factor!

Shayne Ward <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aQ2i2UvnCE>


Coronation Street’s Aidan Connor started out as plucky Shayne Ward, a man on a 
mission to pump out Westlife ballads at one-fifth of the cost. He was good 
looking and quite rubbish, but that’s pop music for you. Epitaph writers take 
note: Ward was the fifth person to be eliminated from series eight of ITV’s 
Dancing on Ice.
Last seen: Becoming a new dad and styling himself as the #DiaperChangeKing. 
High point: Managing to shift more than 1m copies of That’s My Goal, a 
bonafide terrible pop record.
Low point: The first exponent of an art that X Factor winners would come to 
know as Slowly Diminishing Returns: 1, 2, 15, 17 is how his albums have fared 
on the UK charts.

Bleeding Love turned Leona Lewis – a shy office worker from London – into a

wouldn’t have had another nine series of X Factor to wade through, so thanks 
for that, Leona.
Last seen: With painted-on whiskers, starring in the Broadway musical Cats 
High point: Bleeding Love, officially the first real X Factor tune. 
Low point: She was once a global pop phenomenon and now she’s in Cats, albeit 
on Broadway rather than in rep in Lincolnshire. So ...

The first truly forgettable X Factor winner – search for him on Spotify and 
you get a banjo-led bluegrass instrumental, which I’m pretty sure isn’t by him. 
If memory serves, the Scot performed rubbish jazz standards in a tie. That 
didn’t exactly set the charts alight, so he then blamed X Factor for thwarting 
his career as a serious recording artist despite the fact he VOLUNTARILY 
ENTERED A TV POP COMPETITION DEVISED BY SIMON COWELL.
Last seen: Promoting his hench physique on Instagram (he’s pretty much 
disappeared).
High point: Vowing to never again perform his winning Whitney cover When You 
Believe – small mercies, folks.
Low point: Apparently, he’s a black belt in karate, so we’ll leave this 
section blank.

Alexandra Burke <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaWLsgxDzuw>


She came, she sang, she snotted all over Beyoncé! Then she made Leonard Cohen 
fans mad with her Hallelujah cover. Then she returned as a judge and coined the 
phrase “OK.com”. A bit of a wally, but a more entertaining pop star than most 
of these chumps.
Last seen: A Google search brings up an article entitled Whatever Happened to 
Alexandra Burke? (she’s in the Sister Act musical, currently at the Great 
Malvern theatre).
High point: Duetting with Beyoncé – they say never meet your heroes, but Bey 
never looked fazed.
Low point: Modelling an OK.com T-shirt.

Joe McElderry <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEca0ZnzOKw>


Perhaps X Factor’s greatest achievement was making people so angry that they 
staged a popular rebellion against Sony imprint Syco, killing the dreams of a 
likable teenage boy of a Christmas No 1 by sendingRage Against the Machine’s 
1992 song Killing in the Name, on Sony imprint Epic, to there 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/20/rage-against-machine-christmas-number-1>
 instead. Looks a bit pathetic written down, that, doesn’t it?
Last seen: Someone with a sense of humour cast him as the lead role in the 
Who’s Tommy musical.
High point: Joe McElderry’s talent-show, er, talent is impressive: he won 
Popstar to Operastar and The Jump as well!
Low point: Being fat-shamed after appearing on Lorraine looking – horror! – 
less skinny than he was as a teenager.

Not exactlyBowie doing Starman on Top of the Pops

, yet somehow this mesmerising combination was enough to beat One Direction

on the planet, while Cardle was free to spend his time getting narked about not 
being as respected as a serious recording artist despite the fact he ENTERED A

Last seen: Still out there, doing his authentic thing. Last month he released 
an album called Intimate and Live (limited to 1,500 copies, and, yes, it’s 
still available). And playing Huey Calhoun in the musical Memphis in London’s 
glittering West End last year.

Little Mix <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3XQlYplrQ0>


Little Mix were beamed in from a parallel universe in which The X Factor 
functioned broadly as it should – taking various sparky contestants and 
throwing them together to create a genuinely good pop band that was more than 
the sum of its parts. Was their winning charm and success a sign of the future 
direction of the show? Or a weird blip in the system before some fresh twat 
with an acoustic guitar came along?
Last seen: Topping the UK charts with their fourth album, Glory Days.
High point: Being an actually good and successful pop act 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/07/little-mix-the-prime-minister-should-dress-like-ru-paul>
 – a rarity in this feature.

From the Edge (title by Alan Partridge), somehow topped the UK album charts – a 
heartwarming 2016 upset to rank alongside Brexit and Trump’s election.

Er, who? Apparently, as The X Factor staggered on, like a wounded foal that 
nobody could quite bring themselves to put out of its misery, a prison officer 
from Leicester sneaked in and won the competition. She then went on to reach 
Christmas No 1 and support Beyoncé! Did all that really happen? Seeing as 
nobody was watching The X Factor by this point, we have no way of checking.
Last seen: Starring in Jack and the Beanstalk in Leicester and singing at the 
opening of Champneys beauty college in London.
High point: Supporting Beyoncé – they say never meet your heroes ... Oh, you 
know the rest.
Low point: Being exposed by the Sun for having had a successful singing career 
beforeThe X Factor <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-x-factor>. On 
cruise ships.

Haenow, Haenow – don’t dream The X Factor’s over. Because you will inevitably 
wake up and find that it’s very much still going. That was the case as it 
staggered into its 11th series, like a wounded foal that someone had tried to 
put out of its misery, only to botch the job and increase said foal’s 
suffering. With all the logic of a Brexit vote, the Great British Public 
decided Haenow should occupy the Christmas No 1 slot, despite him making music 
so nondescript that you longed for the days when the pop charts were full of 
larger-than-life personalities such as Sam Bailey.
Last seen: Turning on the Christmas lights in West Bromwich with Stavros 
Flatley.
High point: Reminding people of Crowded House’s best song. 
Low point: The traditional “[Insert artist name] and Syco have parted ways by 
way of mutual agreement” statement arrived within a year.

Louisa Johnson <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z9BE2Pz_VA>


Johnson, Johnson, don’t dream it’s ... nah, doesn’t work. With the wounded 
foal now no longer staggering, yet somehow clinging on to life in a manner most 
veterinary surgeons agreed was even more torturous than this metaphor, X 
Factor’s 12th series was won by Louisa Johnson, a teenage singer I’ve literally 
never heard of despite her winning less than a year ago. Bereft of a name that 
puns readily with Antipodean MOR acts, Johnson relied on her vocal talent to 
ensure her histrionic cover of Bob Dylan’s Forever Young scraped into the Top 
10.
Last seen: Her debut album is out next year. Theoretically. 
High point: She was the youngest X Factor winner ever.
Low point: The worst chart performance of any X Factor winner isn’t the 
greatest start.
