Vaughan was a familiar face on British TV, with roles in the comedy Citizen 
Smith and the drama Our Friends in the North. But he was best known performing 
alongside Ronnie Barker in the prison sitcom Porridge, playing Harry Grout, the 
head of HMP Slade’s protection racket.

He only appeared in three episodes of the 1970s comedy but is still remembered 
for a menacing performance as the prison kingpin running operations from his 
luxuriously appointed cell, complete with a budgerigar.

“I still get people saying: ‘Let you out, have they, Grouty?

’” Vaughan told an interviewer this year.

More recently he won over a new generation of global admirers in the hit HBO 
fantasy showGame of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones>, playing the elderly 
blind character Maester Aemon.


“People talk about Grouty but, good heavens, the fan mail I get from all over 
the world because of Game of Thrones is enormous,” he told the Sunday Post. 
“It’s just grown and grown and once you’re hooked, that’s it.”

Brenock O’Connor, the 16-year-old actor who played Olly in the Game of 
Thrones, paid tribute to Vaughan as a “kind and talented man”.

He also appeared alongside the ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev in the Ken Russell 
film Valentino.

Vaughan was born Peter Olm in 1923 in Shropshire, the son of a bank clerk and 
a nurse. His early acting career at the Wolverhampton Repertory Theatre was 
interrupted by the war. After serving as an officer in Normandy and Singapore, 
he returned to acting in London.

He married his first wife, the actor Billie Whitelaw, in 1952. As she rose to 
prominence with celebrated parts in Samuel Beckett plays, Vaughan continued to 
play small parts in minor theatre. She claimed he resented her success. After 
the couple separated in the early 1960s Vaughan earned more prominent roles. He 
went on to marry the actor Lilias Walker.

In October, Vaughan told BBC London Radio 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04c8v2l 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04c8v2l> his favourite role was playing Ed in 
original cast of Joe Orton’s 1964 play Entertaining Mr Sloane.

“For about two years it was an absolute sensation. Judy Garland came to see it 
three times. It was a magical time.”


Asked to explain the secret of his long career, he said: “Luck, good wine and 
beer. I just had a damn good time.”
