Adele is unusual in the list, in that the bulk of her earnings came from 
recorded music. Her most recent album25

, released in November 2015, broke sales records on both sides of the Atlantic, 
and was the bestselling album of 2015.

Ninth-place Calvin Harris

 combined popularity as a recording and touring artist with the colossal fees 
he earns as a resident DJ at the Las Vegas nightspot Hakkasan. His three-year 
deal earns him a reported $400,000 per appearance.

Forbes calculates its figures using information from Pollstar, which tracks 
tour revenues, Nielsen, which measures music sales, and the Recording Industry 
Association of America, as well as interviews with those involved in the inner 
workings of business.
