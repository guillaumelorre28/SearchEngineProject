No longer the domain of Saturday afternoon barbecues, cooking over wood and 
coals – intentionally charring and burning – has become quite a trend. Bearded 
men in waxed aprons fill every Nordic restaurant worth its salt and the 
technique has been celebrated at restaurants such as the wonderfulKitty Fisher’s

 andBlack Axe Mangal <https://www.facebook.com/blackaxemangal>. Though the 
grill masters of London’s Turkish ocakbasi restaurants will tell you it’s 
nothing new.

You’d be forgiven for assuming that this cavemanesque cooking is all about 
meat, but in fact vegetables sit centre stage at most of these kitchens. At 
home, we’ve overlooked how much a bit of char and smoke can compliment a 
beloved vegetable or boost a neutral cheese, such as halloumi or feta. An 
aubergine is an obvious pairing with a bit of smoke – babaganoush is a friendly 
blend of vegetables and smoke, as is a halved aubergine grilled and basted in 
white miso on every turn. Onions too, work well grilled slowly and tossed 
through plump pearl barley grains. Even halved little gems are transformed when 
quickly charred and simply dressed in oil, vinegar and chopped herbs.

This charring is, of course, possible on a griddle pan or even a good 
heavy‑based frying pan, but its natural habitat is on the barbecue. The 
resolution to cook outside to me seems most welcome on a weeknight, when taking 
the kitchen outside brings a holiday feeling to an otherwise normal Tuesday or 
Wednesday. These have been the char-edged suppers we’ve cooked quickly this 
summer.

Harissa and lime halloumi with flatbreads

Halloumi is a real crowd-pleaser when it comes to barbecues. I have never 
understood the blanket fascination, but I do like its texture when its cooked 
just right, charred and crisped a little on the outside and perfectly melting 
inside, if you hit this sweet spot, gone is the offputting rubbery squeakiness. 
It does need some help on the flavour front; a quick marinade will boost your 
squeaky cheese out of its simple milky profile. It pairs well with a hit of hot 
chilli and a little bit of sweetness.

Here, it has a quick dip in a harissa, lime and rose marinade, which is backed 
up by a grilled relish that combines smoke from charred red onions, some 
piquancy from a good drizzle of pomegranate molasses, sweetness from red 
peppers and a salty olive kick. It’s also great in flatbreads, burgers and 
toasted sandwiches. The cooling yoghurt dampens down the chilli as well as 
providing a pleasing temperature contrast between the fridge-cold yoghurt and 
the grill-hot halloumi.

If you like, you could stir a few crushed dried rose petals into your harissa 
to make it rosy. By all means, use jarred roasted red peppers to speed things 
up.

Serves 6
2 x 250g pack of halloumi, cut into 2cm slices
Juice and zest of 1 lime
1 tbsp rose harissa 
A handful of dried crushed rose petals (optional)


For the relish 
2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced
2 red peppers
A handful of pitted green olives
2 tbsp pomegranate molasses
Salt and black pepper, to taste


For the harissa yoghurt
6 tbsp Greek yoghurt
1 tsp harissa
2 tbsp tahini
Juice of 1 lime
Salt and black pepper
1 tbsp sumac

To serve 
4 flatbreads or wraps (see my recipe here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/24/beetroot-borani-hummus-dip-recipes-anna-jones>
)
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted 
A few handfuls of salad leaves

1 Combine the halloumi, lime zest, 1 tbsp harissa and, if you like, a few 
crushed petals. Mix by hand to coat the halloumi. Set aside.

2 Light your barbecue (or heat up your griddle pan). Let the flames die down a 
little, then cook the onions, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until 
soft and sweet. Char the peppers alongside until black all over, then put them 
into a bowl and cover with a tea towel while they cool.

3 Meanwhile, ripple the yoghurt with harissa, tahini and lime, season, then 
sprinkle with sumac and refrigerate.

4 Peel the skins from the peppers and deseed them. Chop with the onions and 
green olives. Add 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses and mix well, taste and add 
seasoning, if needed.

5 Stoke the barbecue. You want it to be medium hot – no big flames. Cook the 
halloumi for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until just-charred and a little 
blistered, and softly melting inside.

6 Meanwhile, warm the flatbreads on the other side of the barbecue for a 
minute or so on each side.

7 Pile the halloumi on to the flatbreads, top with spoonfuls of the onion 
relish, the harissa yoghurt, sesame seeds and a few salad leaves.

Charred courgettes with mozzarella and lovage (main picture)


Courgettes can be grilled when finely sliced or in brave chunks. Wafer thin 
they grill in seconds and make a fine salad, but here I go for bigger pieces, 
cooked until the outside chars and the inside steams to a buttery softness. Sit 
them next to some cooling mozzarella and you’ve got all the contrasts, the hot 
and cold, neutral and punchy, calm and bitter.

The lovage oil is the crowning glory and simpler than you might think, though 
a good pesto would work too.

I cooked this on a hot and heavy day last summer at a supper club and it’s now 
a meal I regularly dream of: the sweetness of the charred courgettes paired 
with the cool, calm and creamy burrata and the verdant hit from the lovage is 
pure summer. It was the brainchild of the brilliant Robbin Holmgren, the head 
chef at Fifteen London. I am sure his version is much fancier, but this is how 
I do it at home. Any leftover lovage oil can be kept in a jar in the fridge for 
a few weeks. If lovage is hard to get hold of, a mixture of parsley and celery 
leaves will work, as would most other soft herbs.

Serves 4
A small bunch of lovage (or a mixture of parsley and celery leaves) 
4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and black pepper
6 courgettes (I use a mixture of yellow and green)
2 balls of mozzarella or burrata

1 First, make the lovage oil. Fill a bowl with boiling water. Plunge the 
lovage into it, scoop out immediately and immerse in a bowl of cold water to 
cool. Then pat dry with kitchen paper. This keeps the lovage green.

2 Put the lovage in a food processor or blender, add the extra-virgin olive 
oil and a small pinch of salt, then blend until really smooth. Sieve the oil to 
get rid of any big bits of herb, then transfer to a jar and set aside.

3 Next, heat your barbecue (or griddle pan) until it’s smoking hot. While it 
heats up, cut your courgettes – bigger ones into rounds and smaller ones into 
long slices. Once the griddle is hot, char your courgettes on both sides until 
nicely charred and softened a little in the middle.

4 Serve the charred courgettes on a platter next to the burrata torn open, 
finished with a good pinch of sea salt and a grinding of black pepper, and a 
good drizzle of the lovage oil.

Anna’s tips for barbecuing vegetables

 * Cook on charcoal or wood if you can as it will impart that smoky flavour 
that gas barbecues won’t. 
 * Use lumpwood charcoal. It’s more expensive but will hold heat longer so you 
will use less. Avoid firelighters if you can. 
 * Wait for the right moment to cook. This may sound basic but wait for the 
flames to properly die down. You want the coals white hot, grey and glowing 
which give the most even heat. 
 * Control the heat just as you would if you were using a gas hob. If things 
are too hot then take your food off and let the coals cool down. 
 * If you are cooking more than one thing it might be useful to have two 
temperatures on your barbecue. To do this, once the coals are hot pile most of 
them to one side which will be hot for grilling, and a few on the other side 
for warming bread and gentler cooking. 
 * Don’t oil your vegetables before they hit the grill. Instead, dress them 
carefully after grilling, while they are still warm in good olive oil, citrus 
or vinegar.
