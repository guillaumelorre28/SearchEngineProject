We’re Going on a Bear Hunt
7.30pm, Channel 4

How to convert such a delicate children’s book to TV? Lovely hand-drawn 
animation does justice to Helen Oxenbury’s illustrations of siblings embarking 
on an adventure; Michael Rosen’s percussive, repetitive words present a bigger 
problem. Something needs to be added, so scriptwriter Joanna Harrison boldly 
introduces not just Mum and Grandma (Olivia Colman and Pam Ferris) but a note 
of deep, clear sadness.Jack Seale

Alan Bennett’s Diaries
 8pm, BBC2

“I’m sure you’ve heard all these stories before,” says the irrepressible 
Bennett at the beginning of a film that’s essentially a diary of his diarying. 
Director Adam Low follows the 82-year-old as he makes his rounds over the 
course of a year, accumulating the material that he continues to distil into a 
gently waspish chronicle of his times and ours. It also serves as a 
recollection of an extraordinary career, now spanning more than half a century. 
The Lady In The Van follows (see Film Choice below).Andrew Mueller

Birds of a Feather
 8pm, ITV 

There was a time when festive escapades for Sharon and Tracey were a 
Christmassy custom for the nation. ITV attempts to restore that particular 
tradition, as the Birds flit south from chilly Chigwell to Morocco, on the hunt 
for Tracey’s unfortunate offspring Travis, who has gone awol on his gap year. 
With Dorien distracted by the Tangier talent and Sharon wary of a suntan 
spoiling her personal injury scam, it’s up to Tracey to tackle the 
investigation alone.Mark Gibbings-Jones

David Walliams Celebrates Dame Shirley Bassey
 9pm, BBC1

David Walliams, the big spender, the man with the Midas touch etc, meets the 
Tigress of Tiger Bay for a special tribute night of chat, song and occasional 
sketches, in which Bassey also appears. The Dame, who turns 80 in January, 
performs some of her best-loved numbers from a 60-year catalogue, accompanied 
by a live studio orchestra and vocal group Blake. At the end of a year like 
this, it’s just the sort of thing we need.Ali Catterall

Grantchester Christmas Special
 9pm, ITV

It’s Christmas 1954 in murderous Grantchester, and James Norton’s dashing 
vicar is run ragged with the demands of his job. There’s also the added 
complication of his beloved Amanda, estranged from her husband but also knocked 
up. It’s a scandal waiting to happen. That is, until a distraction occurs in 
the form of a local man’s disappearance. When his body is found, it recalls a 
crime Robson Green’s Detective Keating failed to some solve years before.Ben 
Arnold

Yonderland Christmas
 6.30pm, Sky1

It’s not just Christmas Eve, but also the night before Thanktival in the 
superbly entertaining world of Yonderland. In a twist that could well give 
children nightmares, the festive joy is threatened by a present-eating monster 
called Chompus. Can mum Debbie (Martha Howe-Douglas) come to the rescue? 
Perfect family viewing for a cosy Christmas Eve, with added monsters and enough 
subtlety to keep both parents as happy as their kids.Hannah Verdier

Wild West Christmas Eve
PBS America, from 6am 

Catering for what one can only assume is the impossibly niche Venn overlap of 
people who want some “giddy-up” with their “Bah! Humbug!”, PBS rotates five 
wild west documentaries throughout the day. The yarns of Jesse James, Wyatt 
Earp, Robert E Lee, Kit Carson and Little Bighorn are spun drily and cheaply, 
yet the stories themselves are gripping enough to hold your attention. And, 
refreshingly, none have a thing to do with Christmas.Luke Holland

 ‘Comically cantankerous’... Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd in the big-screen 
adaptation of Alan Bennett’s The Lady In The Van. Photograph: Allstar/Bbc Films 
The Lady in the Van (Nicholas Hytner, 2015), 9pm, BBC2
Maggie Smith is a marvel as Miss Shepherd, the eccentric elderly woman who 
parked her campervan in Alan Bennett’s drive for a few weeks, and stayed for 15 
years. Alex Jennings is a joy as Bennett, but this is Smith’s film: her 
comically cantankerous exterior masking an inner sadness. There’s fun, too, in 
the neighbours’ perplexed reactions to her mucky presence. This small but 
big-hearted comic drama is a great alternative to the talking animations and 
blockbusters that fill the festive TV schedule.Paul Howlett

Doctor Zhivago (David Lean, 1965) 9.05am, Channel 5
Lean’s majestic adaptation of Boris Pasternak’s novel stars Omar Sharif in an 
epic romance. The stunning scenes – the Moscow Square executions, the frozen 
transportation of exiles – convey all the bitterness of the Russian Revolution. 
And Julie Christie’s Lara is an indelibly passionate creation.PH

Despicable Me (Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, 2010) 11.20am, ITV
This laugh-out-loud animated adventure has Steve Carell voicing the world’s 
baddest baddie Gru, whose status is challenged by evil young Vector (Jason 
Segel). Plotting to steal the moon with his accomplice Dr Nefario (Russell 
Brand), the stage is set for superb retro-sci-fi antics. Part The Incredibles, 
part Flash Gordon.PH

Zootropolis (Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush, 2016) 12.15pm, 6pm, Sky 
Cinema Premiere
A beautifully animated, funny bunny Disney adventure about rookie cop Judy 
Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), the first rabbit on the force of animal 
city Zootopia. She’s consigned to parking-ticket duty by unimpressed buffalo 
police chief Bogo (Idris Elba) but is soon getting her teeth into the case of 
14 missing mammals, with the help of sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).PH

The Vikings (Richard Fleischer, 1958) 12.50pm, Channel 5
Kirk Douglas has made better films than this, but if you want to celebrate the 
star’s recent 100th birthday, this spectacular, full-blooded epic will do 
perfectly well. Douglas is a furious physical presence as the savage Viking 
Einar, hewing and hacking at half-brother Eric (Tony Curtis) as rivals for the 
Northumbrian throne and the love of beautiful Princess Morgana (Janet Leigh, 
Curtis’s then wife).PH

 Under his spell ... a young Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter And The 
Philosopher’s Stone. Photograph: WARNER BROS./Allstar 
Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (Chris Columbus, 2001) 1.30pm, ITV
If you want to devote your Christmas to Harry Potter, here’s where to start, 
with the young wiz (Daniel Radcliffe), plus chums Hermione (Emma Watson) and 
Ron (Rupert Grint) enrolling at wonderful Hogwarts and having their first 
encounter with evil Lord Voldemort. With marvellous CGI invention and a whole 
coven of British acting talent, it cast an eight-movie spell.PH

Penguins of Madagascar (Eric Darnell, Simon J Smith, 2014) 4.50pm, BBC1
The penguins of the Madagascar trilogy star in their own feature, with the 
three brothers – Skipper, Kowalski and Rico – plus rookie Private in a 
globe-trotting adventure 007 would be proud of. With Benedict Cumberbatch 
voicing the wolfie British agent and John Malkovich as an evil octopus, there’s 
much to enjoy.PH

The Polar Express (Robert Zemeckis, 2004) 6.55pm, ITV2
An early adopter of performance capture, though in a slightly eerie way, this 
is a wholesome tale of a lad boarding a magic train bound for Santa’s grotto at 
the north pole. The digital business allows Tom Hanks to play five roles, and 
creates a genuine sense of wonder.PH

Scrooge – A Christmas Carol (Brian Desmond Hurst, 1951) 5.10pm, Channel 5
If you were to choose the best Dickens film adaptation you might pick David 
Lean’s Great Expectations, but this version of A Christmas Carol comes close. 
Alastair Sim is Scrooge incarnate, his miserly humbuggery a gloomy delight as 
he trudges home from work, shooing angelic, carol-singing urchins away and 
refusing to relent on a pleading debtor’s £20 loan; and C Pennington-Richards’s 
atmospheric photography is superb. But if watching with children, beware: 
Michael Hordern’s chain-clanking, shrieking ghost of Jacob Marley is a real 
gothic horror.PH
