“Tartine.” Such a nice word, isn’t it? It also happens to be the name of one 
of my favourite restaurants, Bar Tartine in San Francisco. They make 
incredible, interesting breads (the sprouted rye is my favourite), and knockout 
homemade cultured buttermilk butter and little plates of food that are always 
on point. But that’s by the by ...

Bruschetta, open sandwiches, tartines – whatever you choose to call them – 
many a memorable meal can be made by piling simple things on to good bread. 
When I reach back into the culinary catalogue that is my memory, a few stand 
out: this year’s winter tomatoes, which I ate for several days straight with 
good-quality olive oil, plenty of sea salt and lemon zest on sourdough bread; 
salted, fried porcini piled on toast in a little Tuscan trattoria; just-picked, 
tiny yellow-and-green courgettes peeled into ribbons and piled on to toast with 
a slick of goat’s cheese, a scattering of lemon zest and topped with courgette 
flowers, in the midst of a friend’s vegetable garden ...

This way of eating suits the season, which is all about spending more time 
outside, away from the kitchen. In summer, meals need to be less planned and 
considered and more born from what’s at hand. I admit that some of the toppings 
I have scavenged from the fridge, and from the big bowls of lemons, avocados 
and fruit on our table, would not always suit this column, but on occasion they 
hit just the right note.

Tartines and sandwiches are all about the quality of the bread. We are lucky 
enough to live near a great bakery: it’s a couple of miles away, but we make 
the effort to pass by there once a week for a loaf of sourdough. It lasts for 
five days or more and will toast perfectly, giving us a week’s worth of quick 
summer meals on toast. Here are the two tartines I was proud of this week.

Egg, caper and herb tartines

My husband-to-be, John, loves egg sandwiches. Having never been a fan of 
standard egg and cress, I set out to make one we would both love. This is it: 
soft, sunny eggs and a caper-spiked mustard dressing that makes me think of 
American delis.

Makes 4
6 eggs 
A small handful of cornichons
2 tbsp baby capers
A few sprigs each of tarragon, dill, parsley – leaves picked 
A small bunch of watercress
2 tbsp dijon mustard
2 tbsp mayonnaise
2 tbsp Greek yoghurt
1 tsp runny honey
4 slices of good bread, such as sourdough
Salt and black pepper
Olive oil

1 Boil the eggs for 6 minutes in salted water, then run under a cold tap for 
30 seconds before peeling them and putting to one side. This will yield an egg 
with firm whites and a just-set, but still slightly runny in the middle, yolk; 
if you like them a little firmer, boil for another 30-60 seconds.

2 Chop the cornichons finely, add the capers and chop again, then put into a 
small mixing bowl. Pick the herbs from their stalks and roughly chop most of 
these, along with most of the watercress. Add this to the bowl too.

3 Add the mustard, mayonnaise, yoghurt and honey, then mix well. Season with 
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste and balance the flavours as you 
see fit; I like the dressing to have a sweet note to balance the acidity of the 
capers and the cornichons, like a good American deli mustard.

4 Toast – or better, griddle – your bread until nicely charred. Drizzle with 
olive oil. Cut your eggs carefully in half and season with salt and pepper. 
Perch three halves on each piece of bread and top with a good drizzle of the 
mustard dressing and a scattering of the remaining herbs and watercress.

English garden tartines

This is a riot of colour and represents all that is great about English summer 
gardens. It goes particularly well with a glass of ice-cold rosé. I use the 
dip-dyed pink and white breakfast radishes here, but the regular round ones 
would work really well too. We ate this for a late evening dinner, but I’d 
proudly serve this as quick starter too.

Makes 4 
A bunch of radishes
Olive oil
1 red onion, peeled and finely sliced
1 lemon
200g shelled fresh or frozen peas
A small bunch of mint
100g soft goat’s cheese or ricotta
4 slices of good bread, such as sourdough
100g soft goat’s cheese or ricotta
A few allium flowers, or a sprinkling of chopped chives (optional)

1 Preheat your oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Wash the radishes, keeping the 
tops intact (if you have them). Put them on a baking tray, drizzle with olive 
oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, then roast in the oven for 20 
minutes, or until the tops are crisp and the radishes have turned a softer, 
more mellow pink.

2 Put your sliced onion in a little bowl with a good pinch of sea salt and the 
juice of half the lemon. Scrunch it all together with your hands. Leave to one 
side to continue to lightly pickle.

3 Cook the peas for a few minutes in boiling water, then drain. Mash them a 
little with a potato masher or in a large pestle and mortar. Grate in the zest 
of the other half of the lemon, then add a good pinch of salt and black pepper. 
Finely chop most of the mint (saving a few little leaves for later) and stir 
through the peas.

4 Once the radishes are roasted, toast or griddle your bread. Drizzle with a 
little olive oil or spread with a little salted butter. Pile the peas on the 
toasted bread, drain the now-bright-purple onions from their liquid and put on 
top of the peas. Crumble the goat’s cheese on top and scatter with radishes. 
Finish with the remaining mint, and some allium flowers or chopped chives, if 
you like.
