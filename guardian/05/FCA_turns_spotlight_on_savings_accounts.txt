Banks and building societies <https://www.theguardian.com/money/banks> that 
pay their savers as little as 0.01% interest have been named and shamed by the 
City regulator.


The Financial Conduct Authority’s move to shine a light on the poorest-paying 
savings accounts is part of a shakeup designed to make it easier for savers to 
switch and compare.


The FCA revealed accounts from 32 banks paying poor rates of interest 
<http://www.fca.org.uk/news/ps15-27-cash-savings-remedies> to longstanding 
customers, after its study in January showed £160bn of funds were earning no 
more than the 0.5% Bank of England base rate.

It identified Progressive building society, Danske Bank and Ulster Bank, among 
others, as providers offering easy-access savings accounts that pay only 0.01% 
interest. Major names with very low-paying open easy-access accounts include 
HSBC and First Direct, which both pay 0.05%, and Santander and Yorkshire Bank, 
both paying 0.1%.

The FCA also found in January that older accounts, representing a significant 
chunk of the £700bn market, tended to have lower rates than those more recently 
opened.

The regulator’s plans to make it easier for savers to seek better returns 
include requiring firms to send text message alerts to remind savers when an 
introductory bonus rate is scheduled to end.

A new rule will force firms to offer prompt and efficient switching to better 
accounts that they operate, while, from January 2017, it will launch 
seven-working-days switching for cash ISA transfers.

Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: 
“With many savers never switching because they don’t think it will make a 
difference, our rules will help consumers get the information they need to shop 
around.

“In a good market, providers should be competing to offer the best possible 
deal and, should a consumer wish to move accounts, they should be able to do so 
with the minimum of fuss.”

The FCA will publish information about poor-paying accounts every six months 
as part of an 18-month trial, and said it hoped this would encourage firms to 
“change their behaviour and offer better value products”.


The measures, which will come into effect from next December, are being 
planned after a market study found that, for many consumers, competition was 
not working as effectively as it could be.


The regulator stopped short of banning introductory bonus rates, as it 
believes they may benefit some customers, but said this year it expected 
providers to improve the way they communicate about interest rate changes and 
when the bonus rate expired.


It said it also wants firms to strip out complex jargon and give customers key 
information that is easy to understand to help them compare savings accounts, 
by providing summary boxes.


Banks will likewise have to display interest rate information prominently 
alongside account balance information in all rate-related customer 
communications.


The regulator’s January report also revealed many consumers found it difficult 
to know what rate they were on or were put off switching by the expected 
inconvenience. It found 80% of easy-access accounts had not been switched in 
the last three years.

Ten of the lowest-paying easy access cash savings accounts with branch access, 
as of 1 October:

• Barclays - 0.25% for accounts still open to new customers, 0.1% for accounts 
closed to new customers.
• NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland - 0.5% for accounts still open to new 
customers.
• Lloyds Banking Group - 0.5% for open accounts, 0.1% for closed accounts. 
• Nationwide - 0.5% for open accounts, 0.25% for closed accounts. 
• Santander - 0.1% for open accounts, 0.1% for closed accounts. 
• Ulster Bank (owned by RBS) - 0.01% for open accounts, 0.01% for closed 
accounts.
• Co-operative Bank - 0.25% for open accounts, 0.06% for closed accounts. 
• Virgin Money - 1.01% for open accounts, 0.1% for closed accounts. 
• Danske Bank - 0.01% for open accounts, 0.1% for closed accounts. 
• ICICI Bank UK - 1.4% for open accounts.
