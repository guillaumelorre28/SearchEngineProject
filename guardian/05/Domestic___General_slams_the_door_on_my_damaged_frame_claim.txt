In June I received a replacement Hotpoint cooker through my Domestic & General 
insurance policy.

The delivery man accidentally smashed the bottom of my front door frame and 
told me to contact D&G with photographs. I did so and was told I had to contact 
the delivery firm as it was not its problem.

The delivery firm has failed to reply. I have contacted D&G four times and 
Whirlpool, who supplied the cooker, six times. The broken frame is a hazard, 
but it cannot be repaired until the claim is accepted.PW, Paddock Wood, Kent

Since D&G organised the replacement as your insurer, it should have looked 
after you when the damage was done even if, as it claims, it has no liability.

Only after The Observer got in touch did it liaise with Whirlpool to secure a 
settlement. Soon afterwards Whirlpool rang and agreed to pay the sum quoted by 
a local carpenter for the job.
