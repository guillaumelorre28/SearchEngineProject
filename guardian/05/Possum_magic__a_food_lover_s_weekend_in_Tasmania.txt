We fly in to Hobart on a Thursday night and on the basis of a Twitter-sourced 
casual dinner recommendation we make our way toTasman Quartermasters 
<http://www.tasmanquartermasters.com.au/>. The bar, eatery and bottle shop is 
owned by Stuart Addison, an ebullient former sommelier and yachtsman serving up 
excellent steaks and burgers, cooked sous vide for hours then finished over a 
charcoal grill.

We tuck into delicious wallaby (slow-cooked then fried with a native 
pepperberry crust) and a wallaby and possum kransky, both sourced from Bruny 
Island Game Meats. Stu pours us another glass of something interesting and we 
play toy tug-of-war with his friendly border collie cross kelpie and noted 
local celebrity, Kora.

To prepare for our Friday at MONA <http://www.mona.net.au/> we enjoy a 
fortifying breakfast at Pigeon Hole, a pint-sized cafe in West Hobart that 
sources most of its ingredients from a farm just outside the city.The MONA Roma 
ferry <http://www.mona.net.au/visit/getting-here/>, painted in military-chic 
camouflage and staffed by strapping men in tight-fitting grey jumpsuits, feels 
like an appropriate form of transport for reaching David Walsh’s dramatic art 
museum, jutting out of the sandstone cliffs like a Blofeldian lair.

We arrive back in Hobart late afternoon and stroll along the waterfront to the 
Lark Distillery cellar door to sample a range of Tasmanian whiskies. Then it’s 
dinner atFranklin <http://www.franklinhobart.com.au/>, Hobart’s hot new 
restaurant in the Art Deco building once home to the Mercury newspaper.

Open less than a month, Franklin is the seafood-focused baby of David Moyle, 
former chef at The Stackings at Peppermint Bay. Starters of sea urchin with 
leek and nasturtium and raw ghost cod with fresh horseradish, saltbush and sea 
parsley impress, but the real highlights are the goodies coming out of Moyle’s 
enormous wood-fired Scotch oven: whole roasted flathead with urchin butter and 
chicory, and an entire roasted Woodbridge pigeon (better than any we’ve had in 
Hong Kong). A deceptively simple, insanely silky lemon and bay leaf ice cream 
makes for a fitting dessert.

On Saturday morning we start with lamb and harissa sausage rolls and lavender 
cream vanilla slice at North Hobart patisserie Sweet Envy, followed by a day 
trip to picturesque Bruny Island. Food highlights on the island include 
Australia’s first available unpasteurised cheese, the Raw Milk C2, atBruny 
Island Cheese Co <http://www.brunyislandcheese.com.au/>, and just-harvested 
oysters at Get Shucked <http://www.getshucked.com.au/>, an oyster farm with a 
newly licensed bar and a drive-through window for those who want their bivalves 
on the go.

No food lover’s trip to Hobart is complete without visiting the Sunday Farm 
Gate Market <http://farmgatemarket.com.au/>, one of the best farmers’ markets 
in the country. Our first stop is the popular stall of Geeveston sushi chef 
Masaaki Koyama, who is busy assembling fresh temaki sushi rolls of exceptional 
quality. We admire the produce at environmental horticulturalist Paulette 
Whitney’s stall (her farm Provenance Growers grows over 500 rare and heirloom 
plant varieties) and try a delicious chai and honey whey popsicle from the Whey 
Pop People.

Just as we’re about to head to the airport we notice Sirocco South’s stall 
selling pulled potted possum confit, and curiosity gets the better of us. Made 
from Bruny Island possum, pepperberry, garlic and duck fat, we’re pleasantly 
surprised by how much we like it – the meat has a flavour similar to (very 
subtly gamey) lamb, but is texturally much leaner. Perhaps ringtail rillettes 
could become the next big Australian food trend?
