Living the paleo diet, a favourite with supermodels, is not easy (or, I 
imagine, fun): it means avoiding dairy, sugar, grains and legumes; some cut out 
even potatoes and alcohol, and eat only nuts and fruit in teeny-tiny 
quantities. Frankly, it’s unlikely that our paleolithic ancestors ate muffins 
for breakfast.


Makes 18 muffins
Sift together 100g almond flour, 100g coconut flour and a tablespoon and a 
half of (paleo-friendly) baking powder. Separately, whisk four eggs with 400ml 
pure/all-natural coconut milk, 90ml olive oil and three tablespoons of maple 
syrup (coconut flour requires a lot of liquid). Add this to the dry 
ingredients, with half a mashed banana, a grated carrot, a grated courgette and 
100g dried fruit (blueberries are nice).

Line muffin trays with cases and fill each one to the top with the batter, 
then scatter each with a teaspoon or so of pumpkin seeds. Bake at 190C for 25 
minutes, until puffed up and golden brown on top.
