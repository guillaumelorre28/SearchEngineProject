We all know that the emotional heartland of a night out is the bathroom, where 
the sight of a woman leaning sorrowfully on a hand dryer suggests that high 
drama is about to unfold.

So it is with this tableau from Gucci’s spring/summer 2016 campaign, which 
could easily be a stillfrom Pulp’s Disco 2000 video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJS3xnD7Mus> or a scene from Channel 4’s 
Deutschland 83 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/04/fashion-in-deutschland-83>
, all lipstick-stained cheeks, clashing pinks and reds and carefully styled 
melancholy.

The pussy-bow blouse, lace shirt, metallic skirt and glitter glasses – key 
Gucci motifs undernew creative director Alessandro Michele 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/23/alessandro-michele-gucci-milan-fashion-week>
 – are all present and correct, while the embellished forest green bomber 
jacket that our heroine wears looks a likely bestseller for the season. Expect 
to see similar styles soon on a high street near you.

 Everything’s gone green: is forest green the new black? Photograph: Gucci 
In the other campaign images, which were shot in Berlin, there are plenty of 
forest green shimmers – practically the new black in fashion right now, seen on
Kate Moss emerging from the Thames with a fag in her hand on the set of 
Absolutely Fabulous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/14/kate-moss-supermodel-on-set-ab-fab-movie-panto>
 and playing a starring role in the hysteria aroundBalmain for H&M 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/21/balmain-x-hm-the-high-streets-answer-to-super-glam-partywear>
. Notable, too, is the picture of a peacock being cradled by a man wearing a 
blouse, lace shorts, glitter trainers and a bobble hat while riding his 
skateboard in a shopping centre. Rarely has antisocial behaviour been so 
imaginatively accessorised.
