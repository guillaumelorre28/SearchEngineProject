 Brood and Bitter Pass, 2015 by Helen Marten. Photograph: Martin Godwin 
Helen Marten was the deserved winner of this year’s Turner prize. Her 
mysterious, private, poetic assemblages possess a complexity and nuance. Is art 
getting more grown up? Well, not if Anthea Hamilton has anything to do with it. 
Her giant bum steals the show despite being a lesser work of art. An ideal 
winner would be a cross between these two: Hamilton provides the provocation 
that Marten’s goody two-shoes talent lacks.JJ

Schone Kunsten, Antwerp 
It is fitting that today’s deadpan Belgian art star Luc Tuymans should curate 
his 19th-century countryman James Ensor’s work. Ensor’s seaside morbidity is 
redeemed by painterly flurries (as seen in The Skate), while Tuymans’s own 
Gilles De Binche is the most haunting image in the show.RC

 Yves Klein making Fire Painting in 1961. Photograph: Yves Klein 
A rare survey of the career of the multifaceted, visionary, postwar Parisian 
conceptualist and cultural flâneur Yves Klein. Here we see his International 
Klein Blue canvases, his deceptively play school-like sponge sculptures and 
documentation of his 19-year-old self signing the sky with an outstretched 
finger, an act he proclaimed to be his premiere performance.RC

 The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics, 1968, by Alan Aldridge. Photograph: V&A 
Of all the V&A’s journeys into pop culture, this surely has the best music. 
The late 60s, whose turbulent vibe is explored here, saw Jimi Hendrix play 
Woodstock, Bob Dylan and the Band record The Basement Tapes, the Beatles 
release Hey Jude, Pink Floyd make Interstellar Overdrive and Lou Reed write I’m 
Waiting For The Man. Pop in its age of genius.JJ

 No.64, 1960, and No.15 (Dark Greens on Blue with Green Band), 1957, by Mark 
Rothko. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/REX 
This is a sombre feast of majestic art. Mighty paintings by the greatest 
artists of the US loom everywhere you look. After a handful of portraits to 
open proceedings – including Mark Rothko’s touchingly awkward self-portrait – 
you are thrown into an abstract yet wildly individualistic realm. Arshile 
Gorky, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still and Willem de Kooning are among the most 
compelling artists in rich and rugged company. But greatest of all, on this 
showing, is Rothko, who seems tortured by his own genius for sensual colour.JJ

 The Taking of Christ, 1602, by Caravaggio. Photograph: The National Gallery of 
Ireland, Dublin 
The art of Caravaggio cuts into your heart and scars your memory. His St John 
The Baptist, included in this exhibition, is a sensual masterpiece of luminous 
flesh and stark shadows. It is a must-see for that great work alone but this 
fascinating show also reveals the creativity Caravaggio unleashed in his 
imitators. Artemisia Gentileschi and her father Orazio shine; Georges de La 
Tour is sublime. Go on, treat yourself.JJ

Long before the world went digital this American genius anticipated the 
many-layered complexity of modern communication. Images flicker and fade, are 
lost and found in his epic art of love, life and politics. Rauschenberg’s 
collections of mysterious fragments have the comedy and tragedy of a dazzling 
novel about everything and everyone in the world.JJ

Just prior to winning this year’s Turner, Helen Marten scooped this new art 
prize. While there seems to be a regrettable trend for galleries to court 
public curiosity by emulating the prurient competitiveness of TV talent shows, 
at least this exhibition provides an opportunity to sample Marten’s work. 
Phyllida Barlow, Steven Claydon and David Medalla provide a complementary 
accompaniment.RC

 Do Women Still Have To Be Naked To Get Into The Met. Museum, by Guerrilla Girls
In 1989, the Guerrilla Girls asked Do Women Have To Be Naked To Get Into the 
Met. Museum? Now they pose the question “Are museums today presenting a diverse 
history of contemporary art or the history of money and power?” Agitprop works 
suggest the latter, while a banner proclaims only a quarter of European 
institutions bothered to answer their questionnaire. After 30 years of 
activism, an air of weary desperation prevails.RC
