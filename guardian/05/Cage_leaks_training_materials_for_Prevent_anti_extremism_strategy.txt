 Training manuals and videos used to train public sector workers on how to 
spot signs of radicalisation were leaked byCage <http://www.cageuk.org/about>, 
the group that campaigns on behalf of communities affected by the war on 
terrorism.

On Wednesday Cage released a slew of documents used to train teachers, doctors 
and local government officials to deal with individuals who are vulnerable to 
extremism. The material, said Cage, will be hosted on a website for researchers 
and academics.

Since last year there has been a legal obligation  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevent-duty-guidance>on councils, 
prisons, NHS trusts and schools to tackle radicalisation as part of the £120m, 
10-year Prevent programme. Cage obtained details of “workshops to raise 
awareness of Prevent”, more commonly referred to as Wrap training.

Cage said it made the material public after freedom of information requests by 
the group were rebuffed on the grounds of national security.

The group said Whitehall officials had claimed “that if the programme was to 
be exposed publicly, it would be undermined, as potential terrorists would know 
better how to avoid detection”.

However, on examining the documents, Cage said: “The training gives very 
little actual information other than very general advice. Further, the emphasis 
of the training is on finding factors where an individual may be drawn into 
terrorism, thus not someone who is already committed to a path and might seek 
to evade detection.”

The Wrap documents show that Prevent is concerned with rightwing extremists as 
well as religious radicalisation of Muslims. Other documents ask a series of 
questions to gauge how well Prevent duties are understood by public sector 
workers. For example, higher education staff are quizzed as to what proportion 
of campuses restrict the right to free speech. The answer is 80%, a figure 
obtained by an online magazine last year.

Cage claims a growing list of senior public figures have spoken out against 
the government programmes – with more than 300 professors, academics, experts 
and community figures signing letters opposing Prevent.

High-profile campaigns by religious leaders and mosques in east London have 
called for a boycott of the government’s anti-terrorism programmes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/society-of-mosques-to-boycott-anti-terror-prevent-programme>
, accusing the policies of being a racist attack on the Islamic community.

Ibrahim Mohamoud, Cage’s communications officer, said: “The assumption that 
public sector workers can be trained in a few hours on a complex issue such as 
understanding the pathways to politically motivated violence is naive and 
dangerous. As Cage predicted more than a year ago, the implementation of 
Prevent is leading to over-reporting and several high-profile cases of 
overreach.”

A Home Office source pointed out that many of the documents released were 
already in the public domain. “More than 350,000 people over the last five 
years have taken part in the Wrap training. There is no way it was secret,” 
said the source.
