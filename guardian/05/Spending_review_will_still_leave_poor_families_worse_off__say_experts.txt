The government has been forced to deny claims that George Osborne’s spending 
review is a continued assault on Britain’s poorest families, after two 
respected thinktanks warned future benefit cuts would leave some families more 
than a thousand pounds worse off.

Both the Institute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies> and the 
Resolution Foundation said they believe millions of working families would be 
worse off by 2020 because of welfare changes than they would have been under 
the current system, despite Osborne having reversed his planned cuts to tax 
credits.

In its analysis of the autumn statement and spending review, the IFS said 
other commentators had been wrong to describe the chancellor’s measures as an 
end to austerity. The IFS director, Paul Johnson, said: “This is not the end of 
austerity. This spending review is still one of the tightest in post-war 
history.”

Some 2.6 million working families stood to lose an average £1,600 as a result 
of benefit changes due to come into force under the universal credit system, 
while 1.9 million would be better off by £1,400, the IFS noted.

It stressed that no family will take an immediate cash hit, but the “long term 
generosity of the welfare system will be cut just as much as was ever intended, 
as new claimants will receive significantly lower benefits than they would have 
done before the July changes”.

The thinktank also cast doubt over Osborne’s target of running a surplus on 
the public finances by the end of the decade, and warned that there was a 50-50 
chance he would be forced to revisit his plans.

At the IFS’s traditional postmortem into the chancellor’s budget decisions, 
Johnson said: “He is going to need his luck to hold out. He has set himself a 
completely inflexible target – to have a surplus in 2019-20.”

He warned Osborne will be forced to raise taxes or announce more spending cuts 
if the brighter picture of the public financespresented at the autumn statement

 proves to be unfounded.

The IFS’s verdict on benefit cuts was backed up an analysis by the Resolution 
Foundation, which saidpoorer families will still be hit

 as universal credit is rolled out.


Cuts to universal credit – the benefit set to replace tax credits for most 
claimants in the last years of the parliament – are to go ahead. That decision 
will cost working households £1,000 on average in 2020 and the losses could 
rise to £3,000 for some families, the Resolution Foundation said.

However, the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions hit back at the 
independent studies, saying it was “completely misleading” to suggest families 
would lose money.

The government does not deny that in-work payments replacing tax credits will 
be lower for some new claimants, including those whose family circumstances 
change.

However, the Treasury claimed it was “not legitimate” to compare what someone 
making a new claim under universal credit in 2020 would get with what they 
would get under the current system.

A spokesman said: “As the chancellor set out, for current tax credit 
claimants, because of the government’s economic plan, we can now help with the 
transition to universal credit by avoiding changes to tax credits altogether.

“This means there will be no losses in tax credits, and the suggestion that 
tax credit cuts have somehow been postponed or transferred into universal 
credit is completely misleading.”

Both thinktanks rejected the Treasury’s criticism, saying that it was 
legitimate to compare an old system with a new system in order to estimate how 
families would fare in the future.

“In the long run, people will be worse off under universal credit than they 
would have been if the current system continued,” said IFS economist Stuart 
Adam, responding to the Treasury comments.

A source close to work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith claimed the 
Resolution Foundation report was an example of scaremongering, as people will 
not see immediate cash losses to their welfare payments.


The source said: “It is a static analysis that does not take into account 
behavioural change, or other changes such as the new childcare offer.”

She added the same applied to the IFS analysis, but highlighted its admission 
that no family will take an immediate cash hit and that people will be 
protected in cash terms.

The IFS noted that total government spending was due to fall from 40.9% of 
national income in the last tax year to 36.5% by the end of the decade. As part 
of that, spending on non-pension benefits was being cut to the lowest level in 
30 years relative to national income.

The thinktank also pointed out that the government’s commitment to health 
spending was tiny by historical standards. Johnson said: “The 3% cumulative 
increase in health spending over the next five years is not far off the average 
annual increase in spending in the last 50 years.”

Still, the IFS director said the scale of the chancellor’s austerity drive was 
less than had been implied before May’s election and again at an emergency 
budget in July.

Johnson said: “There is no question that the cuts will be less severe than 
implied in July. The gap with what one might have expected, based on the 
Conservative manifesto, is substantially greater.”

 on his planned tax credit cuts and said he would spare frontline policing from 
severe austerity, in his combined autumn statement and spending review on 
Wednesday.

The chancellor said he would continue to cut day-to-day government spending 
and the welfare budget to deliver an overall budget surplus of £10.1bn by 
2019-20.

At the Resolution Foundation’s analysis of the spending review, David Laws, 
who was a Liberal Democrat minister in the coalition government, said the 
chancellor now plans to lean far more heavily on tax increases than he expected 
before May’s election — taking him closer to the balance favoured by former 
business secretary Vince Cable.

He added that Osborne was too occupied with political point-scoring to carry 
out radical reform of the state. “He is spending an awful lot of time and money 
and capital shooting other people’s foxes, rather than developing a strategy of 
his own,” said Laws.

David Willetts, former Conservative minister and the thinktank’s executive 
chair, said Osborne’s autumn statement, which softened the pace of departmental 
spending cuts, was a reversal of the usual pattern in which chancellors swing 
the axe more heavily once an election is out of the way.

“In the old days, politicians used to promise milk and honey before the 
election and after the election you’d get the bad news,” he said.

John McDonnell MP, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said the IFS analysis showed 
Osborne “has not reversed his welfare cuts, he has just delayed them”.

“The day after the spending review the Tory spin is unravelling,” he said. “We 
said this was a smoke and mirror spending review, and we were right.”
