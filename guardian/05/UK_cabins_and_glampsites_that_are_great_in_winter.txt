Bubble domes, Enniskillen

Finn Lough’s bubble domes are the closest things the UK has to igloos, but 
have transparent walls so guests can stargaze from bed. The two-person domes 
are in 50 acres of woodland, but it’s not all back to nature: the beds are 
modern four-posters, and there are coffee machines, posh toiletries, vintage 
record players and en suite bathrooms. Other accommodation includes lodges and 
cottages, and there are activities such as fishing, biking and kayaking. The 
restaurant serves warming winter dishes – perhaps venison with forest mushrooms.

Nordic katas, Perthshire

Comrie Croft, near Crieff, has six Nordic katas (similar to tipis) in birch 
woodland, where campers can spot deer and owls. There is a woodburner in each 
kata, and plenty of sheepskins, so they are snug even in the depths of winter – 
people have stayed in them when overnight temperatures have dropped as low as 
-15C. Campfire pits and hammocks add to the cosiness, while the bed is a 
communal area insulated with covered sheepswool, so it’s best for couples or 
close friends. Hot showers and toilets are a two-minute walk away.
• £99 a night, from £299 for five nights, sleeps six, comriecroft.com

Swedish cabin, Worcester

Lilla Stugan, a sweet red-and-blue cabin on Millham Farm near Worcester, was 
inspired by the owners’ Swedish summerhouse. It has a library of Moomin books 
and a loo decorated with old Abba album covers. Warmth comes from the logburner 
inside and the firepit outside, which has a dutch oven for cooking sausages or 
heating up the campfire casserole provided in the hamper. There is a 
gas-powered shower and compost toilet. The cabin sits at the bottom of a 
100-year-old orchard, which leads into a nature reserve.

Herder’s hut, Gloucestershire

Arctic Quest, just outside Tewkesbury, runs sled dog adventures: visitors 
learn to control a team of huskies and speed around the trails. After an 
afternoon’s mushing, there is a traditional Sami tipi or reindeer herder’s hut 
to stay in. Both have woodburners and campfires, plenty of furs and blankets, 
British Army Arctic sleeping bags (stays warm to -30C!), down-filled socks and 
thermal hoods. Guests can cook over the campfire or hire a fondue set. The tipi 
and hut are in their own field but are part of Croft Farm campsite, so campers 
can use the cafe/bar, gym and sauna (although the main site is closed from 22 
December to 1 March).

• £99 a night for two, £170 a night for up to five, arcticquest.co.uk

Alachigh, ger and lavvu, Carmarthen
 Inside the alachigh 
Larkhill Tipis and Yurts is a glampsite on a 20-acre smallholding in west 
Wales. The accommodation is a little out of the ordinary, comprising analachigh 
(Iranian nomad tent), a Mongolian ger, a Samilavvu, a Kazakh yurt and a Native 
American tipi. Each has a central woodburner – the owners have stayed in the 
ger when it was -10C. Each plot is separated by trees and shrubs, and has a 
campfire. There are two hot showers, a compost loo and a flushing toilet.

Norwegian log cabins, Inverness-shire

Eagle Brae’s seven luxury cabins (sleeping two or six) in the Highlands have a 
mixture of influences: wood from Canada, Norwegian building techniques, 
Himalayan carvings and Scottish motifs. They are all open plan, with a 
log-burner downstairs, bedrooms on a mezzanine and proper bathrooms. Winter 
activities include husky rides, red deer stalking and black grouse safaris.
• Cabin for two £1,094 a week, short breaks from £547, cabin for six £677.50

Icelandic-style turf houses, Isle of Harris

Turf houses were common in Iceland until well into the 20th century, as turf 
is a great insulator. These two turf-roofed cottages on the Isle of Harris are 
built on similar principles, and have peat-burning stoves, their own Jacuzzi 
and sauna, and plenty of Harris tweed blankets. It is a 10-minute walk to the 
nearest beach and restaurant, warming drams are available at the newHarris 
Distillery <http://www.harrisdistillery.com/>, and the northern lights may even 
dance across the sky.
• From £745 for four nights, £1,000 for a week, sleeps two, stay-hebrides.com

Cave house, Worcestershire

Cave houses stay warm in winter (and cool in summer) thanks to the insulation 
of the surrounding earth. The stylish Rockhouse Retreat near Kidderminster has 
the added benefit of a wood fire, firepit and rain shower. The dwelling was 
originally carved 700 years ago with pickaxes out of a sandstone escarpment, 
and is in three acres of private woodland. The pretty town of Bewdley on the 
river Severn is nearby, as is the Wyre forest.

Toasty tipi, Warwickshire

These look like normal tipis on the outside, but inside they have underfloor 
heating, carpet and a kitchenette. Next door is a private gazebo with a 
log-fired hot tub, barbecue area and firepit, and a private toilet (the shower 
is shared). The tipi is on the same site as Tinywood Homes, with its cute 
wooden holiday homes and pods. There are views over the Warwickshire 
countryside, and it is a short walk down a disused railway line to the village 
of Long Itchington, which has six pubs. Leamington Spa is six miles away.
