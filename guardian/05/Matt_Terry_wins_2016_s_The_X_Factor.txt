The live final of the ITV show on Sunday featured performances from the 2011 X

Terry picked Sam Smith’s Bond theme tune, Writing’s On The Wall, as his 
favourite song of the series. His final performance was a rendition of Randy 
Crawford’s 1980 hit One Day I’ll Fly Away.

Host Dermot O’Leary said there had been6.4m votes cast and revealed Ed Sheeran

winner’s single, When Christmas Comes Around.

A tearful Terry, from Bromley, said: “Thank you so much.”

The show’s creator Simon Cowell promised Terry: “We’ll give you 100%”. He told 
both finalists: “I want to say to both of you, you came into this final as good 
artists and you’ve ended as great artists. The thing I’m most proud about, 
about this show, is seeing Little Mix and some of these other artists tonight, 
what they’ve done with their lives and this is why we make this show. You are 
now part of that chapter.”

Former One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson, who performed his new single on 
Saturday night just days after his mother’s death, congratulated Terry, 
tweeting: “Congratulations MattTerry93! Well deserved. XFactorFinal”

Coronation Street star, Shayne Ward, who won the X Factor in 2005, also 
tweeted his congratulations.
