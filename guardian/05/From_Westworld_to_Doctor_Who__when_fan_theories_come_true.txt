Spoiler alert: this article contains references to episode seven of Westworld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld>. Do not read on if you 
haven’t watched.

Fan theories give viewers a sense of control over their favourite show; an 
investment in the narrative that transcends passive viewing, gamifying TV to 
the extent that, if your theory turns out to be true, you can “win”. You can 
beat the writers. The other fans. You – yes, YOU – can be champion of the 
entire internet. Well, Reddit. Well, one distressingly niche Subreddit. But a 
win’s a win.

Inevitably, most turn out to be spurious nonsense – was the Fresh Prince dead 
all along?; did Jessica Fletcher actually murder hundreds of people to further 
her writing career? – but some do hit the mark. One such exampleconcerns 
fan-theory catnip of the moment, Westworld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/30/westworld-wild-fan-theories-about-sci-fi-tv-series>
, and the revelation that sensitive everyman Bernard is in fact one of Ford’s 
automatons, who demonstrated his disinterest for Asimov’s Three Laws of 
Robotics by coolly crushing poor Theresa’s cranium against a wall. Somewhere 
out there, smug superfans are shrieking “CALLED IT” to no one in particular.

Whether it’s a case of broken clocks being right twice a day or a diligent 
deduction of clues, other shows’ secrets have also been outed by fans. In some 
cases, fan theories have even been written into narratives. So keep guessing, 
and you never know ...

 Think the Time Lord’s real name is a coincidence? No. Photograph: Simon 
Ridgway/BBC 
The mystery of The Doctor’s true Gallifreyan handle has lingered around the 
Time Lord for decades, long wafted away as simply unpronounceable by humans 
(with their ineffectual mouths that are completely identical to his). One 
Whovian, though, did coin a theory back in 1995: that The Doctor’s real name is 
“Doctor”, and that word came to have its Earthly associations with “healer” and 
“expert” due to his mucking about and saving lives in the past. Twenty years 
later, lo and behold, River Song explained that this was indeed the case. 
Coincidence? No. That Whovian in 1995 was one Steven Moffat, and, as showrunner 
ofDoctor Who <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who>, he wrote 
his own theory into canon. Fair play.

You wouldn’t expect the most disturbing entry here to come from a kids’ show, 
would you? But yes: Mr Krabs is a crab. He runs Bikini Bottom’s fast-food 
emporium, which sells Krabby Patties, the recipe for which is a closely guarded 
secret. But onefan theory suggested they contained real crabs 
<https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100406153700AAH6G3z>, which as 
you can imagine would present profound ethical dilemmas for Mr Krabs. When 
Nickelodeon finally published the recipe, it didn’t contain crab but “imitation 
crab meat”. Phew. Only that’s generally made of fish, so most of his customers 
were cannibals. Meaning: the sea is one dark, messed up place.

 How did the warrior race undergo such a drastic mutation? Photograph: 
Allstar/Cinetext/Paramount 
When The Next Generation introduced the pasty-headed Klingons we know and 
love, eagle-eyed Trekkers noted that the Klingons of the original series had 
smooth foreheads, and therefore that nothing in the world made sense any more. 
Some theorised that the warrior race had undergone a drastic mutation in the 
interim, andthe show adopted this convenient idea 
<http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Klingon_augment_virus> faster than you can 
say “1960s TV budgetary constraints”.

 Swoonsome swordsman: the resurrection. Photograph: Helen Sloan/AP 
This particular theory didn’t have too long to percolate, and it’s unlikely 
George RR Martin was cruising internet forums with beads of sweat collecting in 
his beard desperately looking for ways to resurrect Kit Harington’s swoonsome 
swordsman. Melisandre “happened” to turn up, and Beric Dondarrion had 
previously been resurrected by the Lord of Light, so the clues were there. But 
Game of Thrones was always the show that could kill off anyone at any time, and 
Snow’s death seemed like a brave leap into an uncertain future. Yet fans put 
two and two together, and Jon Snow returned just as many had predicted.

 Anyone who claims to know what was going on is lying, because the writers 
didn’t. Photograph: ABC/Everett/REX 
A show that burst out of the traps introducing more mysteries than it knew 
what to do with. Numbers, a smoke monster-cum-surly bloke in black, a magic 
light tunnel – anyone who claims to know what was going on is lying, because 
the writers didn’t. Nevertheless, one of the show’s oldest theories was that 
the survivors were wallowing in purgatory. And, while they weren’t at the 
beginning, the show unsatisfactorily ended by saying that they sort of were. 
It’s all a bit muddled because ... well, magic light tunnels and stuff. You 
tell me.
