Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has paid tribute to the “legend” who co-founded 
Notting Hill Carnival <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nottinghillcarnival> 
after he died at the weekend.

Sam King MBE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/07/britishidentity.immigration> sailed 
to Britain on the Empire Windrush from Jamaica and was elected as Southwark’s 
first black mayor in 1983.

In 1964 he started a Caribbean street festival that grew into Notting Hill 
Carnival – Europe’s biggest street party.

He died on Saturday aged 90, his family said.

Corbyn said King had “changed the face of London for the better”.

“He was a man who arrived on the Windrush and started working like many 
Jamaicans did in the area and then decided something had to be done for the 
good of the community in terms of carnival. What a legend, what a loss. He 
educated Londoners with Caribbean food, Caribbean culture, Caribbean music. 
London is a better place, Britain is a better place, thanks to him and his 
family.”

Harriet Harman, Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham, tweeted: “RIP Sam King 
MBE. Wonderful man. Today Southwark mourns – but Southwark is proud.”

Southwark councillor Michael Situ posted on Twitter that the second world war 
veteran <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/13/art.museums> was 
“principled, inspiring and always willing to serve”.
