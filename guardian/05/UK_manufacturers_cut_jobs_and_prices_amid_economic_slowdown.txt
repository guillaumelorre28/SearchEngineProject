Britain’s manufacturers shed jobs and cut prices last month as they struggled 
with tough export markets amid a global economic slowdown.

A closely watched survey of the sector suggested it made little contribution 
to the UK’s overall economic growth in the first quarter. Reflecting acrisis in 
Britain’s steel industry

, a slowdown in the oil sector and sluggish demand overseas, manufacturing 
registered one of its weakest performances for three years, according to the
Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI)

 report.

That echoed a downbeat picture of eurozone manufacturers in a survey for the

The UK report showed manufacturing employment fell for the third month running 
as new export business continued to decline.

The headline index on the PMI report edged up to 51.0 in March from February’s 
34-month low of 50.8. That was above the 50-mark that separates growth from 
contraction but left the average reading for the first quarter of 2016 at just 
51.6, equalling the lowest recorded since the PMI first moved back above the 
neutral 50.0 mark in early 2013.

Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit commented: “The UK 
manufacturing sector remained in the doldrums during the opening quarter of the 
year. Although March saw modest improvements in the trends for production and 
new orders, industry is still hovering close to the stagnation mark and will 
struggle to make a meaningful contribution to the next set of GDP growth 
figures.”

Manufacturers continued to rely on the domestic market for new business in 
March as factories reported that softer global economic growth dented new work 
from key trading partners such as the US and Europe. Some companies also said 
the weak oil and gas market had hurt sales to some regions – especially the 
Middle East.

The pound has weakened in recent months amid worries over the outcome of the 
UK’s EU referendum in June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/why-is-the-pound-falling-britain-sterling-dollar-uk-credit-vote-eu>
. On Friday, the pound weakened further, hurt by the gloomy manufacturing 
survey and as tight opinion polls fanned Brexit worries. The pound was down 
more than 1% against both the dollar and the euro.

A weaker currency may help exporters, by making their goods cheaper overseas. 
However, Dobson warned the pound’s move was not all good news.

“Although the drop in sterling may add some bounce to export performance in 
coming months, the exchange rate is likely to cause as many issues on the cost 
side through higher import prices as it aids for demand,” he said.

That could add to pressure on manufacturers’ margins, he added. The PMI report 
showed average factory gate prices were cut last month as companies responded 
to increased competition and passed on lower raw material costs.

Manufacturers’ organisation EEF said the latest downbeat report was little 
surprise given companies have been grappling with weak global demand and a low 
oil price for more than a year.Cheaper crude has made oil companies cut back on 
spending 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/29/factories-forecast-to-shed-tens-of-thousands-of-jobs-in-2016>
 and so their orders for machinery have collapsed.

“The data confirms subdued activity across the sector at the start of the 
year, coming on the heels of a flat 2015,” said EEF chief economist Lee Hopley.

But there were glimmers of light from industries such as chemicals, rubber and 
plastics and electronics, which have been buoyed by low input costs and 
domestic demand thanks to a pick-up in construction activity, she added.

“Amidst the somewhat disappointing start to the year and the significant 
challenges facing the steel sector, which have once again come to the fore in 
recent days, there are still pockets of growth,” Hopley said.


Much of the global economic gloom which has hurt manufacturing has stemmed 
from China, where growth has slowed and the vast industrial sector has slumped. 
The latest news from the world’s second-biggest economy signalled thatthe 
manufacturing downturn may be easing off

.

China’s official PMI rose to 50.2 in March, up from the previous month’s 49. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted 49.3.

But Markit’s own manufacturing PMI for the eurozone suggest factories there 
continued to struggle to eke out growth. The Markit eurozone index rose to 51.6 
in March, up from 51.2 in February.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “Although the PMI ticked 
higher, March still saw the second-weakest improvement in manufacturing 
conditions seen for just over a year. The data suggest manufacturing grew by 
only around 0.2% in the first quarter, acting as a drag on the wider economy.”
