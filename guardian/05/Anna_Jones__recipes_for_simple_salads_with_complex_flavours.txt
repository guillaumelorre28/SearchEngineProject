Each week, a small unassuming bag arrives in my vegetable box, labelled 
“Hackney salad”. The leaves come in pretty colours: piercing greens, acid 
yellows, deep emeralds and rich purples. Each shade has a flavour so unique and 
so full of personality that eating a simple salad has become the leafy 
equivalent of a 3D film in surround sound.

Depending on the time of year, this London-grown salad from my local veg-box 
scheme, Growing Communities, is an impressive mix. There could be anything from 
turnip tops, perilla leaves or red-veined chard, to the rare and – to me – 
unheard-of buckler leaf sorrel. There are two other types of sorrel (salt bush 
and common, both sherbety and lemony), tiny, frilly baby kale, the grandly 
named salad burnet and baby rainbow chard. Not to mention lots of delicate 
salad herbs such as chives, mint and marjoram to name just a few.

Smaller salad growers are popping up all over the country and mixing their 
more complex and sophisticated leaves with simpler varieties. One Cornwall 
salad grower once gave me a tiny handful of leaves so distinct and flavourful 
that they tasted like a cool sip of fizzy lemonade.

But even with leaves from a local supermarket comes the possibility of a 
cut-above bowl of salad. I like to buy whole lettuces, cutting and washing them 
in one go, then filling a sandwich bag or the salad drawer with a few days’ 
worth of leaves, which stay crisp and cold in the fridge. There is a lot to 
choose from on the supermarket shelves: the bitter crunch of chicory, the soft 
frill of lamb’s lettuce, spiky rocket as hot as a peppercorns, sweet and crisp 
little gems, red-fringed cos ...

A leafy salad is always a part of my day, be it all green, or combined with a 
few carefully chosen ingredients and thoughtfully dressed. A good leaf salad is 
all about the balance of the leaves and the perfect dressing. I favour cooling, 
calm leaves to make up most of the plate, with a scattering of hot, peppery, 
earthy or citrus notes. A good salad is all about each mouthful being unique; a 
pop of lemon, a crunchy leaf, the frond of a delicate herb. This is what makes 
a simple green salad, for me, one of the most pleasing things to eat. It’s time 
to up your salad game.

Peppery green salad with apricots and curd cheese (pictured above)


This is all about the balance between the flavourful leaves and the icy, 
cleansing flavour of fennel. Search out more unusual leaves if you can, but 
rocket and watercress will do fine. Peaches or plums would work well in place 
of the apricots. A simple, but perfectly balanced, salad.

Serves 4
1 large head of fennel
4 big handfuls of peppery salad leaves, (rocket, watercress, mizuna, mustard 
leaf), washed
4 apricots, stoned and cut into eighths
100g goat’s curd or soft goat’s cheese
A handful of hazelnuts, toasted

For the dressing
Juice of 1 lemon
Olive oil
Salt and black pepper
A little runny honey

1 First, finely slice the fennel then immerse in a bowl of cold water to stop 
it browning.

2 Next, make the dressing. Squeeze the lemon juice into a jam jar and top up 
with twice the amount of olive oil, a pinch a salt and pepper, and a tiny 
squeeze of honey. Shake well. Taste for balance. Add more lemon, oil, honey and 
salt as needed – but, remember, it’ll taste a little mellower on the leaves.

3 Drain and dry the fennel, then put in a bowl with the washed leaves and 
apricot slices. Add a little dressing and toss to coat . Tumble into a serving 
bowl or platter. Crumble over the cheese and hazelnuts.

A green lunch salad

This salad is all green and yet has enough backbone to be eaten as a lunch or 
light dinner. It suits rocket leaves best, but watercress or mustard leaf would 
work well too.


Serves 2-4
300g frozen or fresh podded peas
200g runner or green beans, trimmed and chopped into 3cm lengths
3 celery stalks, very thinly sliced
3 large handfuls of rocket
50g pumpkin seeds, toasted 
15 big green olives, chopped
2 ripe avocados, sliced

For the dressing
1 garlic clove, peeled
2 tbsp white miso
2 tbsp mirin
2 tbsp brown rice vinegar
4 tbsp plain yoghurt

1 First, blanch your peas and green beans in salted boiling water for 3-4 
minutes until just cooked, but still retaining a little bite. Once cooked, run 
briefly under cold water to cool, then put to one side.

2 In a large bowl, combine the celery, rocket, pumpkin seeds, olives and, once 
cool, the peas and green beans.

3 Make the dressing by smashing the garlic into a paste in a pestle and 
mortar. Stir in the miso, then add the mirin and vinegar. Mix well, then stir 
in the yoghurt. Taste and adjust the dressing, if needed.

4 Toss the salad in half the dressing and add more, bit by bit, as needed. 
Slice the avocado into thin slices and add at the last minute.
