So that’s IT for a highly entertaining Halloween weekend, thank you all for 
joining in and being brilliant as always.


It’s my annual jaunt to Strictly next week, so someone else will be in the 
hotseat for next Saturday night’s show (not sure who, sorry). I’ll be back for 
the Results Show on Sunday (no spoilers, obv), so I’ll see you then – in the 
meantime you can find me on Twitter/Insta @heidistephens and I’ll try to post a 
few pics. Have a brilliant week! Hx

Tess asks Anastacia what her favourite moment of Strictly was, and she misses 
the opportunity to say “dancing with Gorka”. It’s a tearful goodbye (including 
some random guff about “finding her female”), and then she starts singing and 
Brendan is practically out of the door. But he comes back to twirl Anastacia 
round the dancefloor to Mike Oldfield’s Moonlight Shadow, as sung by Kate Bush. 
Fin.

So who will the judges save? Craig saves Daisy and Aljaz, as does Darcey. 
Bruno does likewise, and Len agrees. Another clean sweep for Daisy and Aljaz, 
and they live to fight another day.

So ANASTACIA AND BRENDAN are leaving the Strictly dancefloor. I’m sorry to see 
Anastacia go – she’s had a rocky road on Strictly since Week 1, but it clearly 
wasn’t meant to be. Strictly is outta love, and it’s time to set her free.

Time for another go at Daisy and Aljaz’s “Am I bovvered though?” Paso. She’s 
beautiful and a great dancer, there’s just no…passion. How can you dance with 
Aljaz EVERY WEEK and not have passion? Is Daisy MADE OF STONE?

They’ve cranked up the dry ice so we don’t have to watch Anastacia’s feet. 
This jive definitely has considerably more welly than last night, but she still 
looks like she’s treading grapes.


Nice work Anastacia, you gave that everything you’ve got, and then some.

Time for the dance off! This one feels a bit pointless, but let’s go with it. 
Brendan can clearly see the finish line, and Aljaz knows he isn’t going 
anywhere.

So who is up against Daisy and Aljaz in the bottom two? Louise and Kevin are 
safe, along with Ore and Joanne, Laura and Giovanni and Danny and Oti!

Which means ANASTACIA AND BRENDAN are in the Dance Off again. And I think 
they’re probably going home tonight.

Time for Len’s Lens! Chances are they’re going to show Ed’s body fondle in 
slow motion, so you might want to grab a cushion.

Time for a musical interlude! It’s Laura Mvula, who is impossibly beautiful 
and I could watch her all night. She appears to have bought her own barefoot 
dancers, and is doing a cover of the Fugees classic “Ready or Not”. Let’s just 
be grateful it’s not Katherine Jenkins.

So which couple is first in tonight’s bottom two? The first couple safely 
through to next week is Judge Rinder and Oksana (loved his moth-eaten Paso), 
along with Greg and Natalie, Ed and Katya (yaaaaas British public) and Claudia 
and AJ!

First couple in the dance-off: DAISY AND ALJAZ! 

See? Being in the top half of the leaderboard means nothing these days. Why is 
Daisy panting?

Last night on Strictly: a bonkers and great fun Halloween Special. Highlights: 
Ore and Joanne’s homage to binge eating, Laura and Giovanni’s filthy Tango, and 
possibly the finest Cha Cha ever danced on Strictly, courtesy of Ed Balls.


Lowlights: Craig making Natalie cry, Anastacia and Brendan’s rigor mortis 
jive, Danny getting caught in Oti’s dog lead.

There’s a bonus pro dance tonight, featuring Karen in a deeply unattractive 
nightie, and Kevin as a Dickensian schoolboy. Vampire Brendan steals her, and 
it all gets a bit Twilight.


The music is a John Lewis Christmas version of Phil Collins’ ‘In The Air 
Tonight’. God I miss the Samba.

And we’re off! It’s the second night of Halloween in Strictly World, even 
though it isn’t actual Halloween anywhere this side of Uzbekistan.

So that’s IT for a highly entertaining Halloween weekend, thank you all for 
joining in and being brilliant as always.


It’s my annual jaunt to Strictly next week, so someone else will be in the 
hotseat for next Saturday night’s show (not sure who, sorry). I’ll be back for 
the Results Show on Sunday (no spoilers, obv), so I’ll see you then – in the 
meantime you can find me on Twitter/Insta @heidistephens and I’ll try to post a 
few pics. Have a brilliant week! Hx
 
Tess asks Anastacia what her favourite moment of Strictly was, and she misses 
the opportunity to say “dancing with Gorka”. It’s a tearful goodbye (including 
some random guff about “finding her female”), and then she starts singing and 
Brendan is practically out of the door. But he comes back to twirl Anastacia 
round the dancefloor to Mike Oldfield’s Moonlight Shadow, as sung by Kate Bush. 
Fin.
 
So who will the judges save? Craig saves Daisy and Aljaz, as does Darcey. 
Bruno does likewise, and Len agrees. Another clean sweep for Daisy and Aljaz, 
and they live to fight another day.

So ANASTACIA AND BRENDAN are leaving the Strictly dancefloor. I’m sorry to see 
Anastacia go – she’s had a rocky road on Strictly since Week 1, but it clearly 
wasn’t meant to be. Strictly is outta love, and it’s time to set her free.
 
Time for another go at Daisy and Aljaz’s “Am I bovvered though?” Paso. She’s 
beautiful and a great dancer, there’s just no…passion. How can you dance with 
Aljaz EVERY WEEK and not have passion? Is Daisy MADE OF STONE?
 
They’ve cranked up the dry ice so we don’t have to watch Anastacia’s feet. 
This jive definitely has considerably more welly than last night, but she still 
looks like she’s treading grapes.


Nice work Anastacia, you gave that everything you’ve got, and then some.
 
Time for the dance off! This one feels a bit pointless, but let’s go with it. 
Brendan can clearly see the finish line, and Aljaz knows he isn’t going 
anywhere.
 
We’re definitely getting better at this prediction business, no?
 
So who is up against Daisy and Aljaz in the bottom two? Louise and Kevin are 
safe, along with Ore and Joanne, Laura and Giovanni and Danny and Oti!

Which means ANASTACIA AND BRENDAN are in the Dance Off again. And I think 
they’re probably going home tonight.
 
Time for Len’s Lens! Chances are they’re going to show Ed’s body fondle in 
slow motion, so you might want to grab a cushion.
 
Time for a musical interlude! It’s Laura Mvula, who is impossibly beautiful 
and I could watch her all night. She appears to have bought her own barefoot 
dancers, and is doing a cover of the Fugees classic “Ready or Not”. Let’s just 
be grateful it’s not Katherine Jenkins.
 
So which couple is first in tonight’s bottom two? The first couple safely 
through to next week is Judge Rinder and Oksana (loved his moth-eaten Paso), 
along with Greg and Natalie, Ed and Katya (yaaaaas British public) and Claudia 
and AJ!

First couple in the dance-off: DAISY AND ALJAZ! 

See? Being in the top half of the leaderboard means nothing these days. Why is 
Daisy panting?
 
Last night on Strictly: a bonkers and great fun Halloween Special. Highlights: 
Ore and Joanne’s homage to binge eating, Laura and Giovanni’s filthy Tango, and 
possibly the finest Cha Cha ever danced on Strictly, courtesy of Ed Balls.


Lowlights: Craig making Natalie cry, Anastacia and Brendan’s rigor mortis 
jive, Danny getting caught in Oti’s dog lead.
 
Tess and Claudia Dress Watch! Tess in a black off-the-shoulder number and 
Claudia in crushed black velvet and a killer fringe. They both look fabulous. 
No, really.
 
There’s a bonus pro dance tonight, featuring Karen in a deeply unattractive 
nightie, and Kevin as a Dickensian schoolboy. Vampire Brendan steals her, and 
it all gets a bit Twilight.


The music is a John Lewis Christmas version of Phil Collins’ ‘In The Air 
Tonight’. God I miss the Samba.
 
And we’re off! It’s the second night of Halloween in Strictly World, even 
though it isn’t actual Halloween anywhere this side of Uzbekistan.
