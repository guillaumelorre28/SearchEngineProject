A last-ditch effort to prevent yellow fever spreading through Kinshasa in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo> and 
potentially developing into a global epidemic is to be launched using vaccines 
containing a fifth of the normal dose because the global stockpile is so low.

Yellow fever <https://www.theguardian.com/world/yellow-fever> is frequently 
lethal, killing half of those who develop severe symptoms. It is transmitted by 
the bite of theAedes aegypti mosquito, which is also responsible for the spread 
of Zika virus. There is a vaccine which protects people for life, but few 
adults had been immunised in Angola when yellow fever broke out there in 
December last year, and in the DRC, to where it has spread.

If it takes hold in Kinshasa, a densely packed city of more than 10 million 
people, it is feared that infected mosquitoes could travel beyond the central 
African region, which has been experiencing so severe an outbreak that vaccine 
stocks are almost exhausted.

In Angola, there have been nearly 4,000 suspected cases of yellow fever of 
which 879 have been confirmed while DRC had 68 confirmed cases and more than 
2,200 suspected cases, with about 400 reported deaths in the two countries, 
mostly inAngola <https://www.theguardian.com/world/angola>. Almost 19m doses of 
vaccine have been administered since January, but there are only 5m left in the 
emergency stockpile. The vaccine takes a year to make, so even with the handful 
of manufacturers working flat out, stocks cannot be replenished quickly.


“It has got us incredibly worried,” said Ruairidh Villar of Save the Children, 
which is helping with the vaccination effort. “We’ve just scrambled an 
emergency team to DRC to support a last-ditch vaccination campaign before the 
outbreak reaches Kinshasa. Our fear is it is likely to go global if we can’t 
stop it soon and it hits the city.”


He added: “It is not as fatal as Ebola but it is pretty awful. The symptoms 
include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. 
Some people recover within a few days but a minority become severely ill, 
suffering organ failure, bleeding from the eyes and death.

Some say the spread of yellow fever shows the world has not learned the 
lessons of Ebola.

“Yellow fever is something that we know and it is something for which we have 
the tools to prevent the spread, which is the vaccine,” said Dr Joanne Liu, 
international president of Médecins Sans Frontières, which is involved in the 
yellow fever response. “The first cases of yellow fever were in December 2015 
and confirmed in January. The first vaccination started a few weeks afterwards, 
but it could have been a bit more prompt.

“What does it tell us? Even if we have the best surveillance systems and 
tools, we still need the political will to act at local level, regional level 
and international level. As with Ebola, when that is not enacted, we always, 
always have a delay in the response. There were some critical weeks which 
basically allowed fertile ground for spread.

“This makes me deeply saddened and also a little bit in despair. We need to 
act – a quick and prompt response.”

There have been reports of 1m doses of vaccine disappearing after being 
delivered to Angola, but the World Health Organisation denies any doses went 
missing. The government appears to have used the vaccine elsewhere in Angola.

“Following a review of the first round of vaccination campaigns in Angola, it 
was found that around 1m doses from the emergency stocks had been used to 
vaccinate people in other medical facilities that were not part of the initial 
approved emergency vaccination plans,” a WHO spokesman said.

A mass vaccination campaign in western DRC in May immunised more than 200,000 
people, said Heather Kerr, Save’s country director there. But it did not stop 
the spread. “Now we’re planning a second response with the emergency health 
unit. We work together with them to support the government. The plan is to 
vaccinate in all the provinces bordering Angola because the yellow fever 
originally arrived from Angola,” Kerr said by Skype from Kinshasa.

 Time is running out to prevent the spread of yellow fever because the rains

“Kinshasa is such a huge city. We don’t really know how big it is. We think 
there are about 10 million people here. Some of the suburbs are very, very 
crowded. We are close to the Angolan border as well. There have already been 
cases in Kinshasa – not many, but a few – because of the density of the 
population and the ability of the mosquitoes to travel far.

“Fortunately for us, we’re in the dry season but there are still people being 
bitten by mosquitoes and not everybody is sleeping under a mosquito net.”

WHO said that, until now, outbreaks in central Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> had been in rural areas, not crowded 
urban environments, where mosquitoes thrive in standing water. Time is running 
out to check the spread, however, because the rains will begin in September.


The emergency vaccination campaign beginning on Wednesday was one of the 
largest ever attempted, WHO said.

 “Working with ministries of health in the two countries, WHO is coordinating 
56 global partners to vaccinate more than 14 million people against yellow 
fever in more than 8,000 locations,” it said in a statement. “The yellow fever 
outbreak has found its way to dense, urban areas and hard-to-reach border 
regions, making planning for the vaccination campaign especially complex.”

The decision to give people one-fifth of the normal dose of vaccine – known as 
fractional dosing – was taken by WHO’s strategic advisory group of experts on 
immunisation (Sage). There are some small studies that show it gives protection 
for at least a year and possibly longer.

″Protecting as many people as possible is at the heart of this strategy. With 
a limited supply we need to use these vaccines very carefully,″ said William 
Perea, coordinator for the control of epidemic diseases unit at WHO.
