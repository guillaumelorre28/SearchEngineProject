One of the year’s most jarring TV sights came in mid-October, when Jimmy 
Fallon’s Tonight Show <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlEyJX86H4o> – the very 
epicentre of showbusiness, a decades-long love letter to institutionalised 
celebrity – welcomed Phoebe Waller-Bridge to discuss her BBC3 sitcom Fleabag.

It was an entirely unprecedented invitation. BBC3 shows aren’t supposed to get 
noticed in America. They aren’t really supposed to get noticed in Britain, for 
that matter. But there was Waller-Bridge talking to Fallon, being funny and 
intelligent and looking for all the world like a star on the ascent, and none 
of it felt weird. That’s a testament to how good Fleabag is.

 Sags with desperation and disappointment … Fleabag. Photograph: Hal

Bold and filthy and utterly self-assured, Fleabag was unlike anything else on 
television this year. True,Crazy Ex-Girlfriend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/29/crazy-ex-girlfriend-rachel-bloom-comedy>
 shared its very female voice, as well as its relentless self-deceit, but that 
was an hour-long Day-Glo musical comedy. Fleabag felt much grubbier than that. 
The series opened with a monologue about anal sex, sped through a 
terrorist-incited bathroom panic attack and ended with rows and rows of 
plaster-cast penises. It sagged with desperation and disappointment. If you 
could find two characters who truly liked each other in the entire show, you’re 
much more observant than me.

The cast was uniformly brilliant, too, from Waller-Bridge’s eponymous Fleabag 
to Sian Clifford as her brittle sister.Olivia Colman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/olivia-colman> rightly won praise for 
her genuinely monstrous stepmother, but just as good wasHugh Dennis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/16/hugh-dennis-my-family-values>
. Smug, yes-to-everything Hugh Dennis from Outnumbered and My Hero, playing a 
broken bank manager with such subtle heartbreak that it made me reassess his 
entire career.

 Uniformly brilliant … Fleabag with Hugh Dennis’s broken bank manager.

I first wrote about Fleabag back in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/fleabag-a-hilarious-sitcom-about-terrible-people-and-broken-lives>
, when the series was halfway through its run, and I hadn’t yet seen the 
finale. Retrospectively, that was probably for the best, since the last episode 
was so flat-out astonishing I certainly would have blabbed about it and ruined 
it for everyone. Luckily, enough time has passed now, so we can dig into it a 
little. Fleabag’s finale was stupendous. You couldn’t call it funny – the few 
jokes that were tentatively launched into the air were immediately suffocated 
by the episode’s all-encompassing sense of sadness – but, Christ, did it stick 
with you.

Throughout the series, Waller-Bridge’s character had flashbacks to happier 
times with her dead best friend. Only during the last episode do we learn the 
part she played in the death, and the revelation knocks you completely 
off-kilter. It’s an incredibly well-judged moment, made all the more powerful 
when she looks at the camera – her one true confidante, the recipient of all 
her asides and knowing side-glances – and jerks away from it, horrified.

It was tremendous, and it launched an already brilliant series into the 
stratosphere. It’s why Amazon picked up the series and made it so buzzworthy 
Stateside. It’s why Waller-Bridge’s next job involves writing a detective 
thriller for BBC America. It’s why she ended up on The Tonight Show. It’s why, 
a decade from now, she’s going to be a national treasure.

And all this from BBC3. Tiny, unloved, online-only BBC3. The channel that was 
taken off-air in February somehow came up with its best ever show when it 
needed it most. Fleabag couldn’t have been made by any other channel, and its 
success proves that BBC3 still has a place in the world. I can’t wait to see 
what it comes up with next.
