Imagine if someone had grabbed you by the shoulders two years ago and told you 
that, by the end of 2016, Britain would leave the EU, David Cameron would 
resign, Leicester City would win the Premier League andDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> would be president-elect of 
America. You would have laughed in their face, wouldn’t you?

But imagine if you hadn’t. Imagine if you had ran to the bookies instead, and 
put all these events on an accumulator. You’d be a billionaire by now. So 
here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to predict a load of unlikely events 
for 2017 and you’re going to bet on them. When they come true, as at least 
three statistically will, we’ll split the winnings and retire early. Deal?
