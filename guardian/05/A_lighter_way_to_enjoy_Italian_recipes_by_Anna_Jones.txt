My cooking life has centered around Italy. I earned my stripes in the kitchens 
of Fifteen, at the time an Italian restaurant where I made one hundred risottos 
a week and rolled every incarnation of pasta on a bench by a sunny window. I 
spent a long summer in the Chianti fields of Tuscany working every hour as a 
line cook in a posh, white-table-clothed trattoria. No one spoke English and I 
spoke little ltalian. In fact, the only words I knew were food related, so all 
my conversations that summer were about oil, wine or polenta. As much as I love 
to travel in my kitchen, Italian food is the food I come back to, it feels like 
home in every way.

I don’t make as much time as I would like for the lovely labours that come 
with Italian cookery: rolling pasta, shaping plump gnocchi or the slow and 
meditative stirring of a risotto. This week I’ve put that right. First, a 
risotto which uses buttery, slow-cooked onions for creaminess meaning it’s a 
little lighter than the half-a-pack-of-butter risottos I used to make in my 
days in the kitchen at Fifteen. Next, a forgiving gnocchi recipe which will 
please all ages, from 1 to 100, served with my favourite tomato sauce – bright 
and sweet with cherry tomatoes finished with a slick of brown butter.

Having made all those risottos, I know how much the quality of a risotto 
centres around two things: firstly, how gently the cook stirs, and secondly how 
generous the cook is with the butter and cheese. Obviously, there’s a place for 
butter and cheese-laden risottos, but I can find them over-rich and cloying at 
times – not something that can be enjoyed every day of the week. This risotto 
is different, using a purée of nettles, and slow-cooked onions, in place of the 
butter and cheese.

Serves 4
For the nettle and onion cream 
Olive oil 
1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped 
1 ladleful of hot vegetable stock (see risotto ingredients below) 
4 large handfuls of nettles

For the risotto
Olive oil
1 celery stalk, finely diced 
1 leek, washed, trimmed and finely diced 
2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
Salt
A bunch of asparagus, woody ends snapped off, stalks finely sliced, tips kept 
whole
200g risotto rice 
1 glass of white wine 
800ml hot vegetable stock 
Zest and juice of 1 lemon
A generous grating of pecorino cheese (I use a vegetarian one)
A couple of handfuls of pea shoots or other spring leaves 
A small handful of hazelnuts, toasted

1 Fry the onion slowly in a drizzle of olive oil on a low heat until very soft 
and gently brown, this will take about 15 minutes. Meanwhile carefully put the 
nettles into a bowl and cover them with boiling water to take away their sting. 
Pull them out with a pair of tongs and pick the leaves from any big stalks. 
Once the onions are ready, add a ladleful of hot stock, stir in the nettles and 
allow to wilt, then take off the heat. Allow to cool a little, then blitz in a 
food processor. Set aside for later.

2 Next, heat a little oil in a large pan on a medium-low heat and cook the 
celery, leek and garlic with a pinch of sea salt for 10–15 minutes, until the 
vegetables are soft and sweet. Add the sliced asparagus stalks and cook for a 
minute or so. Then turn up the heat, add the rice and stir around for a couple 
of minutes. Add the wine and allow it to evaporate.

3 Once all the wine has evaporated, turn the heat down to medium-low and start 
adding the stock a ladleful at a time, allowing each ladleful to evaporate as 
you stir. Keep adding stock until the rice is almost cooked – this will take 
about 25 minutes.

4 Once the rice is just about cooked, add the asparagus tips, peas and broad 
beans and cook for another 5 minutes, until they are tender.

5 Take the risotto off the heat and add the nettle puree and the lemon juice, 
stirring vigorously to mix it through. Season with sea salt to taste, put the 
lid on and leave the risotto to rest for a couple of minutes.

6 Serve with lemon zest and pecorino grated over the top and add a scattering 
of toasted hazelnuts and a little pile of pea shoots.

Ricotta gnocchi and cherry tomato sauce

My favourite dumplings are gnudi (meaning naked) – the almost untouched, soft 
ricotta balls which require an overnight rest. I am rarely organised enough to 
think about dinner the night before and, to my mind, April Bloomfield’s recipe 
cannot be bettered (I have tried). So, these are rather more manageable and 
forgiving ricotta dumplings that I make more often. They use a little flour and 
sit in a cherry tomato sauce spiked at the last minute with the toastiness of 
brown butter. Leaning on perky cherry tomatoes is perfect for this time of 
year, just before our bigger British tomatoes get going.

The ricotta you use here is important: the more watery ricotta that you can 
buy in most supermarkets is a lot wetter than the strained ricotta which I 
prefer to use for these dumplings, as well as for dishes such as baked ricotta 
and desserts. You can buy it in good Italian delis, or you can strain 
supermarket ricotta yourself. Simply wrap it in muslin and hang over a mixing 
bowl for 4 hours or overnight (500g fresh ricotta yields about 400g strained).

Serves 6
For the gnocchi
500g strained ricotta
Salt
150g pasta flour (‘00’)
¼ whole nutmeg
1 egg, beaten

For the cherry tomato sauce
Extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
750g of cherry tomatoes 
Salt
A small bunch of basil, leaves picked

To finish 
50g butter
Parmesan (I use a vegetarian one)
A few basil leaves

1 To make the gnocchi, spread out half of the flour on to a work surface in a 
rough circle and crumble the ricotta on top, sprinkle over the salt and grate 
the nutmeg on top. Use your fingers to delicately gather the ricotta into a 
mound, picking up the flour as you do. Make a well in the middle of the mound 
big enough to house the beaten egg. Drop the egg in and use a fork to work it 
carefully into the flour and ricotta until it has become a rough dough. Gently 
knead the dough adding a little more flour if needed until you have a smooth 
dough (you may not need to use all the flour). Try to be delicate here as being 
rough will develop the gluten in the flour and make your gnocchi tough. Once 
smooth, wrap it in clingfilm and put it into the fridge for 20 minutes.

2 While the dough is resting, you can get on with the sauce. Put the oil into 
a large frying pan with the garlic and place on a medium heat for a couple of 
minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and a good pinch of sea salt and cook for 30 
minutes until all the tomatoes have burst and you have a bright red sauce. Add 
the basil leaves and put to one side.

3 When you are ready to roll your gnocchi, lightly flour your work surface and 
have a lightly floured tray nearby. Unwrap the dough and shape into a 2.5cm 
thick disc, then divide this into quarters. Take one quarter, and roll it into 
a log about 1.5cm thick. Cut this log into 2.5cm pieces and transfer them to 
the flour-dusted tray. Repeat with the remaining three quarters of dough. You 
can keep the gnocchi in the fridge until you are ready to cook them.

4 When you are ready to serve the gnocchi, put a large pan of salted water on 
to boil, and warm the tomato sauce gently. In a small frying pan, cook the 
butter until it goes a couple of shades darker and smells nutty, then take off 
the heat and stir it into the sauce. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water 
and cook until they rise to the surface, this should take about two minutes. 
Toss the drained gnocchi in the tomato sauce. Add a grating of parmesan and 
more basil before serving.
