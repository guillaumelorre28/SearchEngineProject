WEST COAST

Not Forgotten, Yzerfontein

It costs a small fortune to rent many of the artfully dressed properties in 
the Perfect Hideaways’ portfolio, but it also has more affordable options, 
including this sand-between-the-toes beach house. Less than an 1½ hours by car 
from Cape Town, it’s in a peaceful village, in a landscape that’s carpeted with 
wildflowers each spring. The house perches right on the chalk-white dunes and 
has a relaxed, painted-wood interior finished in contemporary, sun-bleached 
tones. On hot, sunny days, you can simply step off the broad veranda and walk 
down to the shore to cool off.
• Self-catering four-bedroom house (sleeps 8) £208 a night, +27 21 790 0972,

This arty, foodie B&B oozes the kind of laid-back beach-chic that makes 
Paternoster popular with weekenders from Cape Town. Arnold and Annalise Hoon 
are keen collectors of contemporary African design and have peppered their 
house with vibrant touches, from beaded chandeliers to hand-embroidered 
cushions. Outside, there’s a plunge pool within earshot of the waves. Breakfast 
is an event, with different choices each morning: think twice-baked cheese 
soufflé, or grilled asparagus wrapped in bacon. Come evening, Arnold can whip 
up delicious dinners, chef’s table style (there’s no à la carte menu, so every 
meal is a surprise) or point you to a seafood restaurant nearby.

If Langebaan is on your itinerary, it’s a fair guess you’re into kitesurfing. 
The turquoise waters of Langebaan lagoon are clear, shallow, breezy and 
(relatively) warm, making this an ideal place to learn or to test your skills 
to the limit. KiteLab, a kitesurfing shop and training centre, offers rooms in 
a stylish, modern house with an open-plan kitchen, living room and balcony. 
Just 500m from watersports hotspot Shark Bay, this is by far the newest and 
smartest option for those who want somewhere comfortable to rest their aching, 
salty limbs.

CAPE TOWN AND CAPE PENINSULA

Eco Wave Lodge, Kommetjie

Aimed at backpackers looking for a peaceful alternative to Cape Town’s party 
hostels, Eco Wave is within a few minutes’ walk of Kommetjie’s wild and 
gorgeous Long Beach. There’s a choice of double rooms or a bunkroom for four, 
none of which are huge, but the shared living areas compensate: they’re 
spacious enough for sofas, a dining table and pool table. The kitchen is roomy 
too, with a braai (barbecue) on the balcony. With big windows and splashes of 
colour, the house has an upmarket surf shack feel – fitting, since massive 
Atlantic waves batter this stretch of coast.

Slangkop Tented Camp, Table Mountain national park

Slangkop is a recent addition to the Hoerikwaggo Trail 
<http://www.hoerikwaggotrail.org/>, a superb five-day hiking route from Cape 
Town to Cape Point. You don’t have to be on a long hike to stay here, though: 
with a play area, a communal braai and cycling paths through the milkwood 
trees, it also appeals to outdoorsy families keen to immerse themselves in the 
wilderness. Rustic and eco-friendly, the camp has six weatherproof, simply 
furnished tents. There’s also a cosy kitchen and dining room decorated with 
whalebones found on the shore.

Kalk Bay is one of the most interesting coastal villages around Cape Town, 
with a busy little harbour and an easygoing, boho-ish atmosphere. Chartfield, a 
late Victorian mansion with splendid sea views, has 16 stylish guest rooms, all 
named after boats. Breakfast is organic and so delicious that many of the 
locals have become regulars. Close to the shore, the house is a short stroll 
from shops and cafes and the highly ratedHarbour House seafood restaurant 
<http://www.harbourhouse.co.za/>. Also nearby are the famous Dalebrook tidal 
swimming pool and St James with its jauntily painted beach huts.

Samhitakasha Cob House, Muizenberg

Owners Simric and Carey Yarrow created this unusual eco-house themselves – 
200m from the beachfront – in surf-mad Muizenberg. Wonderfully organic in 
character and form, it’s entirely built of natural materials including mud, 
straw, wood and lime, using techniques borrowed from traditional English rural 
architecture. Already charming, with a guestroom sleeping up to four, it’s set 
to get even better: the Yarrows have plans to renovate the house in early 2015. 
Stay here and you’ll be treated to a wholesome and tasty vegetarian breakfast 
and, if you’re interested, tips on local craft markets, festivals and yoga 
classes.

Between Plettenberg Bay and Nature’s valley, Keurboomstrand is a quiet seaside 
village with wonderful views of the Indian Ocean. Even if it’s too rough to 
swim here, the dazzling beaches lend themselves to bracing walks and, inland, 
there are wildlife attractions to visit. Popular with both South Africans and 
foreign visitors as it’s such good value, Arch Rock has 20 properties in 
different styles, from chalets and apartments on the sand to cabins among the 
trees further back. Some units are in better condition than others but there’s 
no arguing with the location – slap bang on the shore.

With nothing but crashing waves and huge skies between you and Antarctica, you 
can’t help but feel epic at Africa’s southernmost point, Cape Agulhas, where a 
small monument marks the meeting point of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Just 
west of here is a small, low-impact collection of simple but comfortable 
thatched timber chalets. Set back from the beach, they’re surrounded by a sea 
of lowland fynbos vegetation, home to Cape sugarbirds, orange-breasted sunbirds 
and rare long-billed larks. A raised wooden deck with a barbecue and 
breathtaking views of wilderness, beach and ocean makes each chalet truly 
special.

Stilbaai is only 17 miles south of the main N2 highway from Cape Town to 
Plettenberg Bay, but is small and remote enough to feel well off the beaten 
track. That’s its charm; this stretch of coast is unspoilt, with a Blue Flag 
beach at Lappiesbaai, a whale-watching lookout at Morris Point and several 
nature reserves. Backing on to the Skulpiesbaai nature reserve is Charlotte 
House, an airy, family home created by Jack and Meshell Andrew – he an 
architect and builder, she an interior designer. Inspired by Cape Dutch 
farmhouses and Mediterranean villas, it’s comfortable and elegant.
