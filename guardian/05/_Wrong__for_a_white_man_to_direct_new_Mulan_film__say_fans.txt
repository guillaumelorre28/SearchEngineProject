Debate over the “whitewashing” of Asian stories and white actors in 
“yellowface” has intensified in recent months, most notably around the
introduction of a fictional white character into a Bruce Lee biopic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/17/bruce-lee-birth-of-the-dragon-film-cultural-appropriation-row>
 and thecasting of Scarlett Johansson as Major Kusanagi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/15/scarlett-johanssons-role-in-ghost-in-the-shell-ignites-twitter-storm>
 in the Hollywood adaptation of classic Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell.

The choice of Graves, best known for his work on Game of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> and The West Wing, 
has incensed some fans who believed Sony should choose an Asian director.

Hiring a white dude [GOT] director to direct a Mulan film seems like a really 
odd fit & missed opportunity

why does mulan have a white director? it's a story about women breaking 
barriers, but that's not reflected at all in the studio's decisions¿

Anger about under-representation of Asians and other ethnic minorities has 
been growing for some time. According torecent research conducted by the 
University of California 
<http://annenberg.usc.edu/news/faculty-research/hollywood-equality-all-talk-little-action>
, of 800 top performing films between 2007 and 2015 only 25 had an Asian 
director, only one of whom was female. The same study found that only 3.9% of 
characters were Asian.

The story of Hua Mulan, a female warrior in ancient China who joined the army 
in place of her ailing father, has been adapted many times in China, and most 
famouslyin a Disney animation <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120762/>.


According to Deadline 
<http://deadline.com/2016/10/mulan-movie-alex-graves-director-game-of-thrones-1201837552/>
, Sony’s film – which is a Chinese co-production – will have a Chinese lead and 
is being targeted at the international marketplace.


Disney is also adapting a version of the Mulan story based on their 1998 
animation. No director has been announced yet, but Ang Leehas reportedly turned 
down an offer 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mulan-mania-disney-sony-hunt-937274>. 
More than 100,000 peoplesigned a pre-emptive petition 
<http://www.thepetitionsite.com/505/768/292/> against the “whitewashing” of 
that film.

Disney’s remake is expected to hit cinemas in November 2017, while Sony’s is 
not expected until 2018.
