Ireland's high court has rejected a request to extradite a senior IRA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira> veteran to the US over alleged links to a 
North Korean counterfeiting plot.

Sean Garland, a former Workers' party president, has been fighting extradition 
from the Republic ofIreland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> since 
his arrest in Dublin in 2009.

US authorities wanted to try the 76-year-old for his alleged role in the 
worldwide conspiracy involving so-called "super dollars" 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jul/27/rebeccaallison> that the FBI among 
other security agencies alleged was linked to the regime in North Korea.

In a brief hearing on Wednesday in the Dublin court, Justice John Edwards said 
the court was not disposed to grant the application and will give its reasons 
on 13 January. A Workers' party spokesman said Garland was extremely relieved 
and delighted with today's ruling. The party thanked those who had backed the 
campaign to stop Garland's extradition.

Last week, English artist and rock musician Nick Reynolds visited Dublin to 
hand over his sculpted cast of Garland's head.

Reynolds, who has made artworks out of casts of train robber Ronnie Biggs and 
19th-century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly, made a sculpture out of a cast of 
Garland's head.

The musician, whose band Alabama 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/alabama-3> played a concert to raise funds 
for the campaign to stop Garland's extradition, presented Garland with the 
sculpture when the band launched their album in Dublin.
