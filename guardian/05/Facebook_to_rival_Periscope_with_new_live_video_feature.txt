Facebook <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> will start 
broadcasting live video in a dedicated space on its iPhone app, it announced on 
28 January.


 The feature will initially only be accessible for users in the US who have 
the Facebook iPhone app and will extend the feature to the rest of its 1.6 
billion users over the next few weeks. An Android version is also being 
developed.

The live video option has been through two months of testing for selected 
users in the US.

In a blogpost <http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/01/expanding-live-video/>, 
Facebook said the new feature is accessed by opening a new status update and 
selecting the “live video” icon. The user can choose who to share the live 
broadcast with, as well as see the number of real-time viewers and a stream of 
comments from friends.

At the end of a broadcast, videos are saved to the timeline and can be played 
back or deleted.


“You can discover live videos from your friends and public figures you follow 
<https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/08/connect-with-public-figures-through-live/>
 right in News Feed,” the post said. “While watching a live video, you can tap 
theSubscribe button <http://media.fb.com/2015/11/10/updates-to-live/> to get 
notified the next time the broadcaster goes live. Live is also available to
public figures <http://media.fb.com/2015/11/10/updates-to-live/> and verified 
Pages <http://media.fb.com/2015/12/17/live-for-verified-pages/>.”

The new feature will present significant competition to Periscope, the video 
livestreaming app owned by Twitter that launched in 2015.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized video during the company’s most recent 
financial results. He said lighter, less data-intensive versions have been 
introduced for users in developing countries, as well as more video advertising 
tools for brands.

“We want to develop even better and engaging experiences, and better tools,” 
he said. “Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing 
to invest here is important.”

Zuckerberg said more than 100m hours of video are watched on Facebook every 
day and said the site would soon be introducing a dedicated area for watching 
video.

Facebook also announced on 28 January five new reaction buttons to expand the 
“Like” feature.

Love, haha, sad, angry and wow are being tested in several countries, 
Zuckerberg said during a call with investors. Each response has a corresponding 
emoji. Facebook also decided not to introduce ayay response with a smiling face 
and rosy cheeks, he said, because users did not understand it during testing.

“When you only have a Like button, if you share a sad piece of content or 
something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it.”

Mark Middlemas, spokesman at online advertising firm RadiumOne, said 
introducing the new emojis “makes complete sense”.

“Emojis are the world’s fastest-growing digital language, brands including 
McDonald’s, Ikea and Domino’s are increasingly using them, particularly to 
target millennials. In the cluttered digital age, and as we become more lazy, 
they’re a perfect vehicle to share an opinion in one character so users will 
like them.”
