There's some real goodness in today's Viral Video Chart, but let's start with 
a tribute to one of the world's best surfers,Andy Irons 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YcYjh2kfMBk>, who was 
found dead <http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/nov/03/andy-irons-obituary> in 
a hotel room on Tuesday.

The only surfer to come close to taking on the mighty Kelly Slater in the 
World Championships, Irons was only 32 and a very well-loved surfer. 
Heartbreakingly, his girlfriend is seven months pregnant with their first 
child. With the re-appropriation of surfing by so much trashy mainstream 
culture, it's easy to forget what an artful and incredibly difficult sport it 
is. RIP, andaloha

, as they have said.

Elsewhere we have some impressive stunts in 'People are Awesome 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0Cazxj_yc>', though sticking all of these 
together will give you 'wow fatigue' after the first minute. There's also a 
rogue fake stunt in there which defeats the object somewhat... answers on a 
postcard, etc.

If your beloved offspring is begging for a puppy, try one of these instead.

Someone's Mum (MattyB's <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRFrNZ_Br94>?) wants 
to give Bieber a run for his money, and we also have whatWired

 splendidly called "a fake-ass iPhone table

too good to be true, it generally is. (Even when you think you might have seen
