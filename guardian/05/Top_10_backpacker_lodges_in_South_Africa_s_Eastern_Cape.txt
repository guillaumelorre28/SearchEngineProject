Elundini Backpackers

Tiny Elundini village is reached on a gravel road through the Amathole 
Mountains, north of Alice, home of Nelson Mandela’s alma mater, the University 
of Fort Hare. This backpacker hostel, owned by a Xhosa-Belgian couple, has a 
dorm and private rooms in rondavels with solar lamps and shared rainwater

from the village borehole. There is an excellent range of community-run 
activities, including guided hikes (a day walk leads through the forests to 
Hogsback) and mountain-biking. Alternatively, stay in the village to learn how 
to make Xhosa bread on abraai (grill) and pick up a few phrases of the clicking 
Xhosa language.

On the waggishly named Chillington Farm, outside the alternatively-minded 
mountain village of Hogsback, Terra-Khaya is devoted to off-the-grid 
sustainability. Bring your head torch and sense of adventure; accommodation is 
in wattle-and-daub cabins with shared donkey-boiler showers and composting 
toilets – all gazing down a beautiful valley in the Amathole Mountains. 
Electrical plug points are found only in the lounge, and guests receive a free 
night’s stay for bringing and planting an indigenous tree. The horse-whispering 
owner Shane Eades, who practises natural horsemanship, offers rides lasting up 
to four days in the surrounding forests, with homestay accommodation in a Xhosa 
village. Also on offer are mountain-biking, foraging for mushrooms and hiking 
to waterfalls.

After a 40km drive along gravel roads, through green hills dotted with Xhosa 
villages, follow local ladies with baskets on their heads to the pink and 
turquoise rondavels overlooking the beach.

Add community-run activities such as village visits, canoeing, tours of the 
affiliated NGO <https://bulungulaincubator.wordpress.com/> and pancakes at 
sunrise, and it is hardly surprising that stays here often extend from days to 
weeks. Established in 2004, the Fair Trade-accredited lodge became 100% owned 
by the local community in 2015. There is a strong focus on renewable energy, 
and facilities include composting toilets, paraffin-rocket showers and 
electricity-free rondavels.

This seaside lodge at the Wild Coast village of Lubanzi is partly owned by the 
local community and has a focus on sustainable living, reflected by earthy 
decorations such as the Gekko Dorm’s sinewy driftwood staircase. The private 
rooms are equally fantastic, with elements such as a raised bed for watching 
the sunrise and an oval door that looks like it’s straight out of Hobbiton. The 
sun heats the showers and powers the lighting, as well as the fridge and 
freezer in the self-catering kitchen; the paraffin lanterns come out at night, 
when home-cooked dinner featuring vegetables from the organic garden is served. 
Activities include sea-fishing, village visits and hiking the coast to the Hole 
in the Wall rock formation.

Many Hogsback locals claim that the village in the forested Amathole Mountains 
inspired Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien, who was born in Bloemfontein, 
and supposedly holidayed here. Unlikely, but Tolkien may have heard of the 
otherworldly spot from his son Christopher, who visited while stationed in 
South Africa with the Royal Air Force. Either way, Away with the Fairies has a 
fantasy theme befitting this village of crystals and stone circles, from its 
Wizard’s Sleeve bar to rooms and forest cottages named after Frodo et al. 
Guests can commune with their inner hobbit and enjoy the magical clifftop 
setting in the open-air bathtub overlooking a valley of Afromontane forestry. 
Activities in the surrounding woods include hiking, mountain-biking, climbing 
and abseiling down a waterfall.

Named after the African homesteads found here, this off-the-grid getaway 
overlooks a river mouth in the subtropical Pondoland section of the Wild Coast. 
Ecological features include solar-powered jar lamps, a medicinal garden, worm 
farms for recycling organic materials, odourless biogas toilets and a rooster 
alarm clock. The aim is to encourage the sustainable development of tourism in 
this area threatened by mining and highway developments, and many locals from 
the village of Tswelleni (onion in the Pondo dialect of Xhosa) work here. 
Accommodation is in thatched rondavels with Indian Ocean views – whales and 
dolphins can be spotted from thestoep (veranda) – and activities include 
sampling traditional Xhosa dishes in Tswelleni and surfing a dozen local breaks.

Deep in Pondoland, Mtentu gazes across the estuary of the same name at the 
extensiveMkhambathi Nature Reserve 
<http://www.visiteasterncape.co.za/nature-conservation/provincial-parks/mkhambathi/>
, where golden beaches give way to open grassland and swamp forests. 
Community-run activities in and around the reserve include canoeing up the 
river, exploring the coast on Pondo ponies, hiking to waterfalls and 
experiencing a traditional Xhosa healing ceremony. Accommodation is in rustic 
thatched cabins sleeping up to four, each with a veranda for taking in ocean 
views over morning coffee. Green facilities abound, including solar- and 
gas-powered showers, and a percentage of Mtentu’s turnover goes to the local 
Amadiba community.
