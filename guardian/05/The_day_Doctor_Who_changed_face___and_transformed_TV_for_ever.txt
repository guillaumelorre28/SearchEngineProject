Fifty years ago tomorrow, at 6:13pm, a unique moment in television history 
took place. A camera closed in on the face of an actor lying motionless on the 
floor. The image blurred, faded to white, then came back into focus, revealing 
that for the very first time,Doctor Who 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who> had changed his face.

It was the stroke of genius that saved the series from being a three or four 
season wonder, and instead ensured it would go on to become one of the UK’s 
most iconic pieces of popular culture.

Switching the lead from William Hartnell to Patrick Troughton was an audacious 
move, brought about because of falling ratings, plus Hartnell’s ill-health and 
attitude.

And whereas the announcement of a new Doctor in the 21st-century merits a live 
TV unveiling with accompanying liveblog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/04/doctor-who-announcement-live-blog>
, in 1966 the Manchester Guardian noted that the childrens’ television show was 
changing its lead in the same news-in-brief column that announced who had won 
Miss Blackpool.

Troughton arguably had the hardest job of any actor in the role – namely to 
convince the public he was the same person they had been following since 1963. 
In his first episode, the brief dialogue trying to explain what had happened 
was aimed as much at the audience as at his companions, Ben and Polly, in the 
TARDIS.

Interviewed in 1986 for Fantasy Empire by John Peel <http://www.john-peel.com/>
, Troughton said: “I didn’t think it was a particularly good idea of the BBC to 
replace Billy. I thought it was pretty silly, really. I thought that the 
difficulties of selling it to the audience were enormous … almost 
insurmountable. However, in the end, I was persuaded over a week of 
negotiations, and I thought, ‘What the heck, let’s do this for a while and see 
what happens’.”

Troughton’s first story as the Doctor – The Power of the Daleks – is lost, but 
will soon be issued by the BBC in animated format 
<http://pages.storeuk.bbc.com/thepowerofthedaleks>. He went on to play the 
Doctor until 1969, then reprise the role during the 80s in The Five Doctors 
alongside Jon Pertwee and Peter Davison, and The Two Doctors with Colin Baker.

When Hartnell turned into Troughton, the show had very little back-story. 
Doctor Who was not even yet a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey; his origins 
were still a mystery. Even when Hartnellwas shown facing one of his own people 
for the first time <http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Time_Meddler_(TV_story)> 
(the Meddling Monk), details of their home world were entirely absent. One can 
only imagine how surprisingthe reveal was in 1965 that somebody else even had a 
TARDIS <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhqIaQP0bec>.

We now exist in an era where Spider-Man can be effectively rebooted three 
times at the movies in the space of 15 years, but when Doctor Who did this, it 
was very much uncharted territory. Up to this point,most changes of actor had 
either been simply ignored on-screen 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/genome/entries/8133b375-3c2d-457c-b3b5-4f798b3d5e43>
, or been done by hastily bringing in new characters to cover for an absence.

And few other series have made such a radical recasting of the lead an 
intrinsic part of its formula.

Take Star Trek, a similarly long-running fantasy franchise. After its original 
run, both the 70s animated series and the initial batch of motion pictures 
relied on the same actors and characters. It wasn’t until over 20 years after 
the first episode aired that they dared replace William Shatner with a new 
captain of the Enterprise.

No such luck for Hartnell, who got three years as Doctor Who – and remains the 
only actor to take the role who didn’t realise that he would one day be 
replaced.

As well as “the renewal” (the term regeneration was not used at the time) 
Hartnell’s final story also introduced another enduring part of the Doctor Who 
universe: the Cybermen. The creatures depicted in The Tenth Planet are more 
obviously human than later designs (and DVD remastering shows how much the 
monsters from Mondas relied on Sellotape to stop them from falling apart).

Still, the costume designs are chilling. The stretched cloth across the face, 
and the hollow eyes, give a clearer indication of surgically-enhanced humans 
than the later faceplates. But this was actually a cost-cutting exercise: their 
faces were hidden so the same handful of extras could play different groups of 
the space invaders across all of the episodes.

Hartnell was too ill to shoot part three of the story, the week before he was 
due to leave the show – so it was hastily rewritten to install an incapacitated 
body double in a bunk bed.

And, since the last episode is missing from the BBC’s archives, there are only 
fleeting glimpses of his Doctor’s end. It’s hard to judge whether his erratic 
performance in those final scenes are as intended by the director, or a product 
of his health.

 Some surviving images from Hartnell’s final scenes from The Tenth Planet. 
Photograph: BBC 
There is a recently discovered clip of him being interviewed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/aug/22/doctor-who-rediscovered-william-hartnell-interview>
 while getting ready to do a pantomime performance three months after his 
departure. Asked whether he would “shake off” being Doctor Who, Hartnell was 
bullish: “Oh yes. By making a success in something else, why not?”

But it wasn’t to be.

Hartnell’s career essentially ended with that regeneration scene. He featured 
briefly in early 70s story The Three Doctors, and there’s also a wonderfully 
bizarre cameo from him,which has turned up on YouTube 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWnMhQ9IvGA>, in a Cliff Richard musical from 
the late 60s which retells the parable of the prodigal son. (Hartnell 
improbably plays a shop owner who is Sir Cliff’s father.)

Hartnell never did shake off playing the Doctor. But, as Doctor Who heads into 
its sixth decade, it’s clear that the decision to shake him off meant 
everything.


The essential premise of Doctor Who – a traveller in a blue box who can go 
anywhere in time and space, putting wrongs to right with the power of intellect 
rather than force – now falls in the same category as Sherlock Holmes, James 
Bond, Miss Marple or Robin Hood: characters that we know well, and that have an 
endless capacity for renewal. People continued to want to tell tales of the 
Time Lord when the show was largely off-air between 1989 and 2005, whether as 
comics, novels, audio dramas or webcasts. None of that would have happened 
without that gamble back in 1966.
