Security

The safety of financial information is one of the biggest concerns of online 
users, and there is still a lot of debate about the safety of using the 
internet for financial transactions.

Security systems are available, so check your bank uses one. Typical measures 
will include unique passwords, user identification names and encryption.

Deposit protection guarantee

Make sure your bank adheres to the UKÕs Deposit Protection Scheme, or the 
national equivalent, if your bankÕs parent company is not UK-based. Established 
under the 1987 Banking Act 1987, the scheme protects your money if the bank 
runs into problems.

Where is the bank registered

Check where the bank, or the bankÕs parent company is based. If it is based 
abroad - as is the case with French-owned First-E - consider what you will do 
and where you will go if something goes wrong or you need to make a complaint.

Technology

Check that your computer is compatible with the system your bank uses to run 
its internet operation.

The technology needed to run an internet bank account can vary from bank to 
bank. Most list the required hardware and software on their websites.

Typical requirements are a relevant operating system, Windows 95, 98 or NT, or 
MacOS, and the right system browser, usually Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 or 
above or Netscape Navigator 4 or above. However, some of the banks' websites 
are not compatible with Apple Macintosh computers.
