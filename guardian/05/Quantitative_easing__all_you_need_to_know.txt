Central banks use quantitative easing (QE) to inject money into the financial 
system, hoping to boost business spending and stop inflation from falling too 
low.


In a QE programme, a central bank creates new money electronically to buy 
financial assets such as government bonds or corporate bonds from banks or 
other financial institutions. The hope is that they will use the extra funds to 
boost lending to households and businesses.

QE also pushes down the interest rate, or yield, on government bonds, which 
feeds through into cheaper borrowing costs.

Because the central bank electronically creates the money to buy assets, QE is 
sometimes referred to as money printing, although it does not involve printing 
more banknotes.

If, in the future, inflation threatens to become too high, the Bank can sell 
the assets it has bought to reduce the amount of money in the economy.

The Bank of England launched QE in March 2009

, announcing £75bn of newly created money to buy bonds, when it also cut 
interest rates to a new record low of 0.5%. Over the following three years it 
expanded QE five times,to £375bn in July 2012 when the UK faced a prolonged 
double-dip recession

.

However, the Bank later admitted that the richest 10% of households in Britain 
had benefited the most from QE.

 The strategy has been criticised by groups representing savers and pensioners 
because savings rates, annuity rates and gilt yields have all fallen, but 
Threadneedle Street argued that QE had helped everyone by warding off a deeper 
economic downturn.
