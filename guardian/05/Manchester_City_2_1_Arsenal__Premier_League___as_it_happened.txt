Here are Petr Cech’s thoughts:

What changed was the early goal in the second half. It gave them a lot of 
confidence. They had to come out and put us under more pressure. I thought the 
goal gave them confidence. I thought we were in control of the game, even in 
the second half, but we couldn’t hold on to it. The second goal changed 
everything because they could defend well and wait for the counter-attack. [For 
the winner] There were players in front of the goal so I didn’t even see the 
shot. I don’t know if one of them was David Silva or not [it wasn’t]. I didn’t 
seen the ball because it was behind the players, and my reaction was late. 
We’re very disappointed with the whole week. We gave the other teams on top an 
advantage, but there’s a long way to go but now we need to come back, ideally 
win the next game. We need to concentrate on ourselves, go back to winning 
games, and then we’ll see what the others will do.

Apparently today was the first occasion since 2012 that City have fought back 
from a half-time deficit to win a game.

Yaya Touré speaks:


I think we were more clinical [in the second half], more hunger, we got a 
chance and we did it. I think the individual action of Raheem was brilliant. In 
the second half we were more aggressive and totally dominated the game. I think 
we deserved to win today. We were more clever. Arsenal are very dangerous on 
the counter-attack. I think the defence did very well today, and Raheem did a 
big, big job. I think it was brilliant. We needed this kind of desire.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> were brilliant from the 
beginning of the season until now. We did very well. They had a couple of 
chances, but the defence was brilliant today.

The home side were devoid of confidence, adventure and accuracy for the 
opening half-hour and Arsenal were on course for a comfortable win. But then 
the home team roused and the mood transformed.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> faded, and Mesut Özil’s woeful 
defending was an alarming sight for a manager with designs on the title.

From our report on Arsenal’s defeat at Everton on Tuesday night.

Final score: Manchester City 2-1 Arsenal

90+5 mins: Inevitably, they take it short. The absolute fools. The referee 
blows his whistle before the ball reaches the penalty area.

ticking. “Everyone having a go at Ozil,” writes Gavin O’Reilly. “I see Theo did 
his five minutes of football in the first five mins … then took the rest of the 
game off. His coffee maker must already be wrapped.”

83 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> push forward 
again, but when the ball is chipped to the far post Sagna wins the header, nods 
it into Giroud’s face, and it flies over the bar. City promptly bring Iheanacho 
on for De Bruyne.

82 mins: Arsenal are, though, showing signs of life. Sánchez and Özil combine, 
the German slides in Walcott on the right of the penalty area, but he chips the

78 mins: De Bruyne’s pass to Silva is a little slow, allowing Koscielny to 
slide in and dispossess. A better pass there and the Spaniard was through.

77 mins: City hit the post! Silva finds an outrageous amount of space in 
midfield, plays the ball wide to Navas, and his cross is deflected at least 
twice before crashing into the near post. De Bruyne may have got the final 
touch.

GOAL! Manchester City 2-1 Arsenal (Sterling, 72 mins)

City’s comeback is crowned by Sterling. De Bruyne’s super 50-yard 
over-the-shoulder pass finds Sterling, who teases Monreal, comes into the area, 
gives himself room to swing his left boot and blasts past Cech at the near post!
 Sterling shoots through players to score the second goal for City.

70 mins: De Bruyne shoots into Xhaka, off whom the ball spins towards the far 
post, but Cech tips it wide wide. From the corner another deflection from De 
Bruyne sends the ball towards the same post, but really very slowly, and Cech 
picks it up.

67 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> attack for the 
first time in ages, but Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross picks out only a defender. 
“I’ve watched this whole game so far and I’ve only just realised that Özil is 
playing,” writes David Flynn. “Which tells you everything you need to know 
about the type of player he is this season.”

GOAL! Manchester City 1-1 Arsenal (Sané, 47 mins)

City score with their first attack of the half! Cech’s goal kick lands on a 
City chest, is popped around a bit, and then Silva lifts the ball over the
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defence for Sané – who 
looked offside at the time, but is shown on the replays to be perhapsjust 
onside – to run through and slide the ball into goal.

46 mins: Early impressions are that in the half-time reshuffle Sané has moved 
from right to left, and Sterling from centre to right, with De Bruyne in the 
middle with Silva.

The players are coming out for the second half, and they’re not the same as 
the ones who left it 15 minutes ago: Bacary Sagna has replaced Zabaleta for 
City.

44 mins: Cech catches a cross, then thinks about throwing it out to his right, 
stops, looks to his left, thinks about throwing it there, stops, thinks about 
doing it again, stops and finally kicks clear. 50 minutes to go.

39 mins: A briefly very threatening move ends with Walcott passing just behind 
Sánchez, and thoughArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> keep 
the ball the threat passes, and ends altogether when Bellerin blasts a shot 
high from 25 yards.

Raheem Sterling completes Manchester City turnaround against Arsenal

Here are Petr Cech’s thoughts:

What changed was the early goal in the second half. It gave them a lot of 
confidence. They had to come out and put us under more pressure. I thought the 
goal gave them confidence. I thought we were in control of the game, even in 
the second half, but we couldn’t hold on to it. The second goal changed 
everything because they could defend well and wait for the counter-attack. [For 
the winner] There were players in front of the goal so I didn’t even see the 
shot. I don’t know if one of them was David Silva or not [it wasn’t]. I didn’t 
seen the ball because it was behind the players, and my reaction was late. 
We’re very disappointed with the whole week. We gave the other teams on top an 
advantage, but there’s a long way to go but now we need to come back, ideally 
win the next game. We need to concentrate on ourselves, go back to winning 
games, and then we’ll see what the others will do.
 
A statistical breakdown of Mesut Özil’s match. Tackles are shown as crosses: 
green if successful, orange if not successful. In the top left corner you’ll 
see the only cross. It’s orange.

Apparently today was the first occasion since 2012 that City have fought back 
from a half-time deficit to win a game.
 
Yaya Touré speaks:


I think we were more clinical [in the second half], more hunger, we got a 
chance and we did it. I think the individual action of Raheem was brilliant. In 
the second half we were more aggressive and totally dominated the game. I think 
we deserved to win today. We were more clever. Arsenal are very dangerous on 
the counter-attack. I think the defence did very well today, and Raheem did a 
big, big job. I think it was brilliant. We needed this kind of desire.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> were brilliant from the 
beginning of the season until now. We did very well. They had a couple of 
chances, but the defence was brilliant today.
 
The home side were devoid of confidence, adventure and accuracy for the 
opening half-hour and Arsenal were on course for a comfortable win. But then 
the home team roused and the mood transformed.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> faded, and Mesut Özil’s woeful 
defending was an alarming sight for a manager with designs on the title.

From our report on Arsenal’s defeat at Everton on Tuesday night.
 
90+5 mins: Inevitably, they take it short. The absolute fools. The referee 
blows his whistle before the ball reaches the penalty area.
 
90+5 mins: Into stoppage time at the end of stoppage time, and Fernando is 
booked for fouling Bellerin.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have a free-kick on the half-way 
line, and have to score from it.
 
90+4 mins: Gabriel gets booked for giving David Silva an excuse to fling 
himself to the ground.
 
90+3 mins: Iheanacho crosses into a deserted Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> penalty area instead of wasting 
time near the corner flag, incurring his manager’s wrath.
 
90+2 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have spent a 
minute and a bit failing to get the ball out of their own half. The clock is 
ticking. “Everyone having a go at Ozil,” writes Gavin O’Reilly. “I see Theo did 
his five minutes of football in the first five mins … then took the rest of the 
game off. His coffee maker must already be wrapped.”
 
90+1 mins: Into stoppage time we go, and there’ll be four minutes of it, or 
thereabouts.
 
89 mins: The state of Özil in this clip. I don’t know if he’s unfit, unwell, 
unhappy or just underpaid, but either motivation or mobility is an issue.

87 mins: But the ball is cleared for an Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> throw, from which they’re forced 
to pass back into their own half.
 
86 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have owned the 
last five minutes or so, and now have a free kick on the left after Otamendi 
fouled Özil, who will take.
 
83 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> push forward 
again, but when the ball is chipped to the far post Sagna wins the header, nods 
it into Giroud’s face, and it flies over the bar. City promptly bring Iheanacho 
on for De Bruyne.
 
82 mins: Arsenal are, though, showing signs of life. Sánchez and Özil combine, 
the German slides in Walcott on the right of the penalty area, but he chips the 
ball beyond the far post.
 
80 mins: This has been a humbling half for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, who have shown neither class 
nor application. I don’t know what Wenger said to them at half-time, but it 
must have been rubbish.
 
80 mins: De Bruyne is booked for taking out Gabriel.
 
78 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain has obviously been hurt, as he’s only lasted 13 
minutes or so, and now Elneny has replaced him.

78 mins: De Bruyne’s pass to Silva is a little slow, allowing Koscielny to 
slide in and dispossess. A better pass there and the Spaniard was through.
 
77 mins: City hit the post! Silva finds an outrageous amount of space in 
midfield, plays the ball wide to Navas, and his cross is deflected at least 
twice before crashing into the near post. De Bruyne may have got the final 
touch.
 
76 mins: And another change for City: Jesús Navas replaces Sané.
 
75 mins: Olivier Giroud has arrived to give Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> some muscle up front, and 
Coquelin has departed.

Lots of stick for City's Gundogan tribute, but Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have let some guy in an 'OZIL 
11' shirt run around on the pitch!

City’s comeback is crowned by Sterling. De Bruyne’s super 50-yard 
over-the-shoulder pass finds Sterling, who teases Monreal, comes into the area, 
gives himself room to swing his left boot and blasts past Cech at the near post!

70 mins: De Bruyne shoots into Xhaka, off whom the ball spins towards the far 
post, but Cech tips it wide wide. From the corner another deflection from De 
Bruyne sends the ball towards the same post, but really very slowly, and Cech 
picks it up.
 
67 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> attack for the 
first time in ages, but Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross picks out only a defender. 
“I’ve watched this whole game so far and I’ve only just realised that Özil is 
playing,” writes David Flynn. “Which tells you everything you need to know 
about the type of player he is this season.”
 
65 mins: Silva sends a low shot wide, and Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> ready their first substitution. 
It’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who is coming on for Iwobi.
 
64 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> just cannot 
keep the ball at the moment. They’re a shambles.
 
63 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> give the ball 
away in a dangerous area agin, but Sterling shoots narrowly wide from distance.
 
62 mins: Save! Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> win the 
ball, commit a few men forward, lose it, win it back again, commit a couple 
more men forward, lose it again and then De Bruyne’s got time to pick a pass, 
plays in Sané, and Cech comes out to block his shot.

60 mins: The visitors appear to have left their dynamism in the dressing room. 
Meanwhile, here’s the least necessary statistic of the day.

58 mins: Arsenal spend three minutes pinned back, with 10 players behind the 
ball and within 35 yards of their own goal, but all City produce at the end of 
it is a weak cross, claimed by Cech.
Barney Ronay (@barneyronay) 
Bacary Sagna. Time and again. Changes games.

55 mins: Coquelin wins the ball in his own penalty area and simply refuses to 
clear it, no matter how extreme the provocation. Instead he sets off on a mazy 
solo run, which takes him about 10 yards, and then gives it away.
 
53 mins: Bellerin blooters the ball high from 30 yards as some promising 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> passing comes to nought.
David Schneider (@davidschneider) 
Sagna on for Zabaleta. Surprised that #MCFC

knee.

8 - Petr Cech gone eight consecutive Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> games without a clean 
sheet for the first time in his career. Breached.

City score with their first attack of the half! Cech’s goal kick lands on a 
City chest, is popped around a bit, and then Silva lifts the ball over the
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defence for Sané – who 
looked offside at the time, but is shown on the replays to be perhapsjust 
onside – to run through and slide the ball into goal.

46 mins: Early impressions are that in the half-time reshuffle Sané has moved 
from right to left, and Sterling from centre to right, with De Bruyne in the 
middle with Silva.
 
46 mins: Peeeeep! City get the second half under way.
 
The players are coming out for the second half, and they’re not the same as 
the ones who left it 15 minutes ago: Bacary Sagna has replaced Zabaleta for 
City.

17 - Arsenal remain the only side yet to be trailing a Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> game at half-time this 
season (winning 8, drawing 9). Tight.

When I wrote that Otamendi tackled Otamendi earlier, it was in fact Sánchez 
who was doing the tackling. He seemed to recover.
 
And that is half time. “Guardiola’s men concede an early goal and are having 
trouble tackling ? This stomach-turning start must have City fans reaching for 
the Pep-to-abysmal,” puns Peter Oh.

45+1 mins: The first and only minute of stoppage time starts with another City 
corner, a De Bruyne cross, and a Yaya Touré free header that goes straight to 
Cech.
 
45 mins: A very lovely little passing move on the left from Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> is halted just when it 
threatened to get really interesting, when Monreal is caught marginally offside.
 
44 mins: Cech catches a cross, then thinks about throwing it out to his right, 
stops, looks to his left, thinks about throwing it there, stops, thinks about 
doing it again, stops and finally kicks clear. 50 minutes to go.
 
42 mins: Sané does very well on the right, works space, crosses, and Gabriel 
gets just in front of De Bruyne to turn it behind for a corner.
 
41 mins: Sánchez tries to tackle Otamendi, misses and seems to have hurt his 
ankle in the process.

39 mins: A briefly very threatening move ends with Walcott passing just behind 
Sánchez, and thoughArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> keep 
the ball the threat passes, and ends altogether when Bellerin blasts a shot 
high from 25 yards.
 
38 mins: David Silva, already warned, is booked for very deliberately tripping 
Coquelin.
 
36 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> take a short 
corner, from which Monreal eventually crosses, and Walcott heads wide.
 
35 mins: Sané chips the ball into the area, where De Bruyne controls, feels 
Bellerin’s warm breath on the back of his neck and falls over. The referee 
turns down his appeals for a penalty.

32 mins: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> attack, and 
Walcott is totally unmarked as the ball is looped towards him, but his 
ambitious spinning volley flies over.
