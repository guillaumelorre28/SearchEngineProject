Strictly Come Dancing
 6.40pm, BBC1 

It’s with a massive da-da-da-da-da-da-daaaah that the Strictly final comes to 
town. This Christmas staple won’t disappoint, with glitz, glamour and that 
coveted glitterball trophy. The standards are impeccable this year, and 
Hollyoaks star Danny “Dodger” Mac could spangle his way to victory. Of course, 
anything can happen, and the judges’ musings will pale into insignificance once 
the public start voting.Hannah Verdier 

Walt Disney 
7.55pm, BBC2

By the mid-1940s, Disney was buckling in the face of “a crippled company, a 
mountain of debt, and scorchings from the political press, art world and film 
critics”. The studio-rescuing Cinderella and theme parks were, at that point, 
still a dream away. This concluding episode explores Walt’s frequently grifting 
efforts to build on the pioneering Snow White. While it pulls some punches, 
this is a fairly even-handed profile of this most divisive of modern icons.Ali

Tree of the Year With Ardal O’Hanlon
 8pm, Channel 4

Worlds away from Father Dougal, O’Hanlon relieves the Home Nations of months 
of pent-up tension by – at last! – announcing the English, Welsh, Scottish and 
Northern Irish Trees Of The Year. The four fields are – perhaps inevitably – 
oak-heavy, although it is possible that the odd upstart chestnut or impudent 
beech could cause an upset. The winners will go forward to the prestigious 
European Tree of the Year contest.Andrew Mueller

Modus 
9pm, BBC4

A Scandi drama without brooding melancholy and annoying red herrings? It can 
be done. Modus might not have been clever, but it has certainly been 
consistent, ending tonight with a double bill of some of the well-handled, 
lowbrow thrillage that it’s dealt in thus far. Will profiler Inger and 
colleague Ingvar catch the killer before he commits more murders? Or will his 
creepy home invasions and rubbish American accent put a dampener on their 
blossoming affair?John Robinson

The Funny Thing About Christmas
10.30pm, Channel 5

Some pretty good standups say some quite funny things about Christmas, in a 
talking-heads show that covers all the obvious topics, from shopping to 
sprouts. The stronger performers, such as Nish Kumar, Kerry Godliman and Tom 
Price, can dredge up a bit of tone or timing to make obvious observations 
worthy of a laugh, while in this low-impact environment, James Acaster’s 
deadpan fancy seems positively dangerous.Jack Seale

Top Class: Christmas Special
 10am, CBBC

Susan Calman fronts a special Christmas edition of the kids’ general knowledge 
fact-em-up. Without the infectious personalities of the kids themselves, this 
runs the risk of being little more than a standard question-and-answer game. 
However, the presence of Dick and Dom, Blue Peter’s Lindsey Russell and Ricky 
Martin (sadly not that one) as contestants will ensure plenty of adequate foil. 
Merry quizmas!Luke Holland

Bowie, Prince & Music Legends We Lost in 2016
 10pm, Sky Arts

It’s time for the terrible toll of this discombobulating year to be taken. The 
worlds of sport, acting, comedy and politics have also suffered grievously, but 
in the interests of keeping things manageable, this tribute concentrates on 
music. Expect hefty Bowie, Prince and Cohen encomiums, but let’s not forget 
Sharon Jones or Phife Dawg, Leon Russell or Prince Buster. The year the music 
died? At times, 2016 has felt like it.Phil Harrison

Zoolander 2 (Ben Stiller, 2016) 12noon, Sky Cinema Premiere
Ben Stiller’s model Derek Zoolander sashays down the catwalk again. He and 
arch rival Hansel (Owen Wilson) return to New York after a long reclusive 
retreat to help Interpol agent Penélope Cruz foil master fashion criminal 
Mugatu (Will Ferrell). But more worryingly, the pair are now outdated, while 
Benedict Cumberbatch’s androgynous “All” rules the style roost. There’s a 
glittering parade of cameo fashionistas, but this is still an off-the-rack 
sequel to what was a custom-made original.Paul Howlett

The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring (Peter Jackson, 2001) 
4.15pm, ITV
Chunk one of Jackson’s $300m screening of Tolkien’s epic fantasy (there’s 
plenty more over the holidays) opens with Elijah Wood’s hairy-footed Frodo 
Baggins and his band of elf, human, dwarf and wizard friends setting off to 
destroy the one ring. Something nasty – ringwraiths, cave trolls, ’orrible orcs 
– lurks round every corner, and it’s full of magic, menace and sentiment.PH

Coming To America (John Landis, 1988) 11pm, Dave
Landis revisits the role-swap territory of Trading Places with a beaming 
performance from Eddie Murphy. He plays Prince Akeem of Zamunda, rebelling 
against King James Earl Jones’s plans for an arranged marriage by going 
incognito in New York with trusty manservant Arsenio Hall to find a bride who’s 
not only after his money. Shari Headley is the girl heading for love’s lottery 
jackpot.PH
