Thousands of savers with NS&I will earn less interest from November after it 
announced it would be cutting the rate paid on its Direct Isa.

The instant access savings account currently pays 1.5% on balances, but this 
will be reduced to 1.25% from 16 November.

The government-backed organisation said it had reduced the rate on the 
tax-free account to bring it in line with other providers.

NS&I, which has restrictions on how much money it can take in each year, has 
faced criticism from banks and building societies who have struggled to compete 
with its rates.

It said that in making the decision to cut it had to balance several 
interests. Jane Platt, NS&I chief executive, said: “Interest rates in the easy 
access ISA market have been in decline over the year, and our Direct Isa rate 
has stood out at the top of the best-buy tables for some time.

“To ensure that we continue to strike a balance between the needs of our 
savers, taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector, 
we have taken the difficult decision to reduce the rate on our Direct Isa.”

Latest figures show 404,210 savers hold a Direct Isa, and the account is still 
open to new customers.

Unlike other savings providers, customers with NS&I have all of their deposits 
guaranteed by the government.

said this made the accounts attractive, particularly withthe amount covered by

 at the end of the year.

Hannums said rates had fallen across the instant access market, with banks and 
building societies competing instead on fixed-rateIsas

“There are accounts round paying 1.5%, so you can get a better rate,” she 
said. “But the [NS&I] account will still be popular because it is not 
dreadfully uncompetitive and people love NS&I.”
