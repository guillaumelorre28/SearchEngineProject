Mixed day for European markets

There were no fireworks from Vienna, with the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> keeping rates on 
hold and revising its inflation and growth figures only slightly higher, while 
Opec failed to agree on an output ceiling on oil.

So investors remained cautious ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers due on 
Friday. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 dipped 6.32 points or 0.1% to 6185.61 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.03% to 10,208.00 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.21% at 4466.00 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.24% to 17,767.30 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.46% at 8957.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.92% to 639.19 as the ECB said it had 
not yet decided on a waiver which would allow it to buy the country’s bonds 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually 
unchanged, down just 2.8 points or 0.02%.

On that note it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s our report on the Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
meeting stalemate:

Lingering hopes that Saudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia> and Iran could put aside their 
regional power struggle and reach a deal on oil production levels to help 
stabilise the volatile crude markets have been dashed.

A ministerial meeting of the Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
oil-producing cartel broke up in Vienna without agreement on Thursday, with 
Tehran refusing to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude 
output.

The political logjam means the “fragile five” Opec members such as Nigeria, 
Venezuela, and Libya whose economies are almost completely dependent on 
petroleum revenues, will remain under pressure.

The UK North Sea industry could see more layoffs and spending cuts but a lower 
oil price – currently just below $50 per barrel compared with the $100 level 
hit in the years prior to 2014 – is good for British motorists, manufacturers 
and homeowners.

Opec put a brave face on its inaction, pointing out that the cost of crude had 
risen by 80% since its last summit in December. It said it had achieved the 
main purpose of the meeting, choosing a new secretary general, in Nigeria’s 
Mohammed Barkindo.

The full story is here:

Back with oil, and after a surprise build up of stocks reported on Wednesday 
by the American Petroleum Institute, there was a fall in inventories according 
to the latest weekly Energy Information Administration.

EIA figures showed US crude stocks fell by 1.37m barrels, and despite being 
lower than the forecast 2.5m barrel draw, the news has given some support to 
oil prices which were hit by the earlier lack of agreement byOpec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec>.

Brent crude, having fallen as low as $48.84 a barrel is now down 0.6% at 
$49.40.

Earlier of course there were also some US jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm 
payroll numbers on Friday.The ADP private sector payroll number came in exactly 
in line with forecasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/02/european-central-bank-and-opec-meetings-live-updates?page=with:block-57502015e4b0b28b29d0253f#block-57502015e4b0b28b29d0253f>
, but ING Bank warns not to read too much into that as far as the non-farms are 
concerned. ING economist James Smith said:

Although ADP’s estimate of employment remained below 200,000 in May, we would 
caution against relying on it too heavily as a guide for tomorrow’s labour 
report.

In advance of this week’s hotly-anticipated labour report, ADP’s estimate of 
May’s private payrolls came in (rather magically) exactly on consensus at 
173,000. This figure may not have been adjusted for the Verizon strike, which 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics has already said will remove approximately 
35,000 workers from May’s overall employment and this in principal, supports 
the view that non-farm payrolls (NFP) will come in below 200,000 again tomorrow.

However, we would note that, whilst ADP use information from their client’s 
payrolls, this is only one (possibly relatively small) part of the overall 
forecasting model that they employ. It is also a function of last month’s 
official payrolls data (ie an autoregressive model) and a business conditions 
index (which is composed of activity data such as industrial production and 
GDP). As a result, we would caution against relying too heavily on this 
estimate of NFP, as the information specifically contained about May’s labour 
market performance may be fairly limited.

Despite the strike-related distortion, we feel that Friday’s consensus figure 
is a little low.

Although it is possible that job creation is slowing as the economy reaches 
something close to full employment, the high month-on-month volatility (arising 
from several factors, not least statistical/seasonal adjustment gyrations) in 
NFP means that the risk of a higher reading than last month (160,000) is 
arguably greater than the risk of a lower one. We look for something at or 
above what we consider to be the current underlying trend (roughly 
180,000-185,000).

That said, we feel that the key to the next Federal Reserve Open Market 
Committee rate hike does not lie within the labour report. As recent 
speeches/statements have shown, the Fed’s labour market check-box is 
effectively already “ticked” and thus the timing of the next move depends more 
on how FOMC members perceive the recovery in activity data to have been since a 
weak first quarter.

In that regard, the final (and probably definitive) green or red light to a 
June hike will come from Chair Yellen’s speech on Monday. On balance, although 
many of the FOMC’s conditions for a hike have arguably been largely met, we 
feel that they are more likely to wait until the third quarter (most likely 
July), when the UK referendum event risk has passed.

It’s been a busy couple of hours, what with the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> and the collapse 
of BHS. And of course Opec.

On the outcome of the oil producers’ meeting, chief market analyst at FXTM 
Jameel Ahmad said:

There was never a chance that Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
would cut production today, meaning there are no real surprises from the 
outcome of this meeting resulting in OPEC failing to reach an output deal.

While the oil markets are finding themselves under pressure and encountering 
selling momentum as a result of the announcement, it is important to point out 
that the oil markets have been meeting sellers around $50 now for the past 
fortnight and this is currently seen as a “top” for the commodity.

To put it quite simply, there was very little need for Opec to change their 
strategy today and it is important to point out that the price of oil has 
rebounded substantially since the milestone lows below $30 at the beginning of 
2016.

There are also reports that major institutions such as Opec and the IEA are 
expecting a dramatic decline in global inventories over the second half of 
2016, which would be very supportive and positive to the chances of a further 
comeback in the price of oil for the remainder of the year.

Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees that today’s ECB 
press conference wasn’t a hummdinger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/02/european-central-bank-and-opec-meetings-live-updates?page=with:block-57503bbee4b03b568f2bf91a#block-57503bbee4b03b568f2bf91a>
:

“Very little was added to the mix during today’s press conference apart from a 
start date for corporate bond purchases*. The bottom line is that the outlook 
for inflation remains grim, but the ECB is not likely to act until it has no 
other choice, due to vague hopes of energy prices propping up inflation in the 
near future.

* - that start date is June 8th

Elsewhere in Vienna, the news that oil producers have not agreed on a ceiling 
on output ( not exactly a big surprise) has sent crude prices lower.

But Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> members are putting a 
brave face on it, and Saudi Arabia has said it is open to a policy change at 
the end of the year.

And as expected the group did elect Nigeria’s Mohammed Barkindo as the group’s 
secretary general.

The sad collapse of BHS this afternoon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/02/european-central-bank-and-opec-meetings-live-updates?page=with:block-575034dbe4b00d22af5dfa7f#block-575034dbe4b00d22af5dfa7f>
 mean there will be even more pressure on its former owner, Sir Phillip Green, 
when he testifies to parliament later this month.

MPs will surely ask Green about the dividends paid to his family during the 
good times, and the deficit in the BHS pension fund. 

Dominic Chapell, who bought BHS for a pound, is also going to face some stern 
questions.

Jon Copestake, chief retail & consumer goods analyst at the Economist 
Intelligence Unit <http://www.eiu.com/home.aspx>, explains:

Many employees facing the loss of livelihood will no doubt be paying close 
attention to the scheduled appearances of Dominic Chapell and Sir Philip Green 
before the work and pensions committee over the next two weeks.

The question of how company executives were able to extract so much money from 
the retailer during its 16 year drift into liquidation will no doubt be high on 
the agenda, especially since the failure of a retail brand like BHS has been 
something that any visitor to its half empty stores in recent years might have 
made an educated guess at.

BHS’s failure comes just two days after Austin Reed went under, Copestake adds:

For those looking for a silver lining respite will be scant. BHS and Austin 
Reed had a combined high street presence of over 280 stores, with closures 
likely to make a tangible impression on some high streets.

As with all fire sales, the best assets will no doubt be picked up cheaply and 
resurrected by more successful retailers, which will make some dent in the job 
losses, but many will not as the British High Street continues to undergo a 
painful correction to accommodate changing shopper habits.

close  
There were no fireworks from Vienna, with the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> keeping rates on 
hold and revising its inflation and growth figures only slightly higher, while 
Opec failed to agree on an output ceiling on oil.

So investors remained cautious ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers due on 
Friday. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 dipped 6.32 points or 0.1% to 6185.61 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.03% to 10,208.00 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.21% at 4466.00 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.24% to 17,767.30 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.46% at 8957.9 
 * In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.92% to 639.19 as the ECB said it had 
not yet decided on a waiver which would allow it to buy the country’s bonds 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually 
unchanged, down just 2.8 points or 0.02%.

On that note it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s our report on the Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
meeting stalemate:

Lingering hopes that Saudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia> and Iran could put aside their 
regional power struggle and reach a deal on oil production levels to help 
stabilise the volatile crude markets have been dashed.

A ministerial meeting of the Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
oil-producing cartel broke up in Vienna without agreement on Thursday, with 
Tehran refusing to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude 
output.

The political logjam means the “fragile five” Opec members such as Nigeria, 
Venezuela, and Libya whose economies are almost completely dependent on 
petroleum revenues, will remain under pressure.

The UK North Sea industry could see more layoffs and spending cuts but a lower 
oil price – currently just below $50 per barrel compared with the $100 level 
hit in the years prior to 2014 – is good for British motorists, manufacturers 
and homeowners.

Opec put a brave face on its inaction, pointing out that the cost of crude had 
risen by 80% since its last summit in December. It said it had achieved the 
main purpose of the meeting, choosing a new secretary general, in Nigeria’s 
Mohammed Barkindo.

There was talk of country quotas following the Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> meeting but.....
 Opec Photograph: Twitter  
Back with oil, and after a surprise build up of stocks reported on Wednesday 
by the American Petroleum Institute, there was a fall in inventories according 
to the latest weekly Energy Information Administration.

EIA figures showed US crude stocks fell by 1.37m barrels, and despite being 
lower than the forecast 2.5m barrel draw, the news has given some support to 
oil prices which were hit by the earlier lack of agreement byOpec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec>.

Brent crude, having fallen as low as $48.84 a barrel is now down 0.6% at 
$49.40.
 
Earlier of course there were also some US jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm 
payroll numbers on Friday.The ADP private sector payroll number came in exactly 
in line with forecasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/02/european-central-bank-and-opec-meetings-live-updates?page=with:block-57502015e4b0b28b29d0253f#block-57502015e4b0b28b29d0253f>
, but ING Bank warns not to read too much into that as far as the non-farms are 
concerned. ING economist James Smith said:

Although ADP’s estimate of employment remained below 200,000 in May, we would 
caution against relying on it too heavily as a guide for tomorrow’s labour 
report.

In advance of this week’s hotly-anticipated labour report, ADP’s estimate of 
May’s private payrolls came in (rather magically) exactly on consensus at 
173,000. This figure may not have been adjusted for the Verizon strike, which 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics has already said will remove approximately 
35,000 workers from May’s overall employment and this in principal, supports 
the view that non-farm payrolls (NFP) will come in below 200,000 again tomorrow.

However, we would note that, whilst ADP use information from their client’s 
payrolls, this is only one (possibly relatively small) part of the overall 
forecasting model that they employ. It is also a function of last month’s 
official payrolls data (ie an autoregressive model) and a business conditions 
index (which is composed of activity data such as industrial production and 
GDP). As a result, we would caution against relying too heavily on this 
estimate of NFP, as the information specifically contained about May’s labour 
market performance may be fairly limited.

Despite the strike-related distortion, we feel that Friday’s consensus figure 
is a little low.

Although it is possible that job creation is slowing as the economy reaches 
something close to full employment, the high month-on-month volatility (arising 
from several factors, not least statistical/seasonal adjustment gyrations) in 
NFP means that the risk of a higher reading than last month (160,000) is 
arguably greater than the risk of a lower one. We look for something at or 
above what we consider to be the current underlying trend (roughly 
180,000-185,000).

That said, we feel that the key to the next Federal Reserve Open Market 
Committee rate hike does not lie within the labour report. As recent 
speeches/statements have shown, the Fed’s labour market check-box is 
effectively already “ticked” and thus the timing of the next move depends more 
on how FOMC members perceive the recovery in activity data to have been since a 
weak first quarter.

In that regard, the final (and probably definitive) green or red light to a 
June hike will come from Chair Yellen’s speech on Monday. On balance, although 
many of the FOMC’s conditions for a hike have arguably been largely met, we 
feel that they are more likely to wait until the third quarter (most likely 
July), when the UK referendum event risk has passed.

It’s been a busy couple of hours, what with the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> and the collapse 
of BHS. And of course Opec.

On the outcome of the oil producers’ meeting, chief market analyst at FXTM 
Jameel Ahmad said:

There was never a chance that Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
would cut production today, meaning there are no real surprises from the 
outcome of this meeting resulting in OPEC failing to reach an output deal.

While the oil markets are finding themselves under pressure and encountering 
selling momentum as a result of the announcement, it is important to point out 
that the oil markets have been meeting sellers around $50 now for the past 
fortnight and this is currently seen as a “top” for the commodity.

To put it quite simply, there was very little need for Opec to change their 
strategy today and it is important to point out that the price of oil has 
rebounded substantially since the milestone lows below $30 at the beginning of 
2016.

There are also reports that major institutions such as Opec and the IEA are 
expecting a dramatic decline in global inventories over the second half of 
2016, which would be very supportive and positive to the chances of a further 
comeback in the price of oil for the remainder of the year.
 
Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees that today’s ECB 
press conference wasn’t a hummdinger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/02/european-central-bank-and-opec-meetings-live-updates?page=with:block-57503bbee4b03b568f2bf91a#block-57503bbee4b03b568f2bf91a>
:

“Very little was added to the mix during today’s press conference apart from a 
start date for corporate bond purchases*. The bottom line is that the outlook 
for inflation remains grim, but the ECB is not likely to act until it has no 
other choice, due to vague hopes of energy prices propping up inflation in the 
near future.

* - that start date is June 8th
 
Elsewhere in Vienna, the news that oil producers have not agreed on a ceiling 
on output ( not exactly a big surprise) has sent crude prices lower.

But Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> members are putting a 
brave face on it, and Saudi Arabia has said it is open to a policy change at 
the end of the year.

And as expected the group did elect Nigeria’s Mohammed Barkindo as the group’s 
secretary general.

The sad collapse of BHS this afternoon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/02/european-central-bank-and-opec-meetings-live-updates?page=with:block-575034dbe4b00d22af5dfa7f#block-575034dbe4b00d22af5dfa7f>
 mean there will be even more pressure on its former owner, Sir Phillip Green, 
when he testifies to parliament later this month.

MPs will surely ask Green about the dividends paid to his family during the 
good times, and the deficit in the BHS pension fund. 

Dominic Chapell, who bought BHS for a pound, is also going to face some stern 
questions.

Jon Copestake, chief retail & consumer goods analyst at the Economist 
Intelligence Unit <http://www.eiu.com/home.aspx>, explains:

Many employees facing the loss of livelihood will no doubt be paying close 
attention to the scheduled appearances of Dominic Chapell and Sir Philip Green 
before the work and pensions committee over the next two weeks.

The question of how company executives were able to extract so much money from 
the retailer during its 16 year drift into liquidation will no doubt be high on 
the agenda, especially since the failure of a retail brand like BHS has been 
something that any visitor to its half empty stores in recent years might have 
made an educated guess at.

BHS’s failure comes just two days after Austin Reed went under, Copestake adds:

For those looking for a silver lining respite will be scant. BHS and Austin 
Reed had a combined high street presence of over 280 stores, with closures 
likely to make a tangible impression on some high streets.

As with all fire sales, the best assets will no doubt be picked up cheaply and 
resurrected by more successful retailers, which will make some dent in the job 
losses, but many will not as the British High Street continues to undergo a 
painful correction to accommodate changing shopper habits.
