Couldn’t have been better.

Intriguing, fun, charming.

What do you think he made of you?
I’d hope he thought I was a decent guy and a laugh.

Did you go on somewhere?
We headed off to a pub next door for a couple more drinks, then on to another 
when that one closed.

We had a goodbye kiss as we left to go home.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I would have stayed longer and dealt with the night tube.
