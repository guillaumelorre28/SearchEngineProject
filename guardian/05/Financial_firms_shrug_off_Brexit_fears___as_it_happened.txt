Afternoon summary

There’s been a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical deal, more fallout from the 
Brexit vote and markets are jittery ahead of a speech later in the week from US 
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, on what was originally looking like a quiet 
summer Monday.

On the Brexit front, financial firms believe the impact of the vote to leave 
the European Union has not so far been as stark as expected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57ba98f6e4b047b85f60268a#block-57ba98f6e4b047b85f60268a>
. But the UK housing market is likely to contract next year in the wake of the 
decision, said estate agents Countrywide.

Meanwhile, markets are heading lower and the dollar is climbing again ahead of 
anyinterest rate comments from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole symposium on 
Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57baa2cae4b0b7e649001e8e#block-57baa2cae4b0b7e649001e8e>
. Investors are uncertain about the prospect for rates, given that last week’s 
dovish Fed minutes were followed by comments from Fed members including Stanley 
Fischer suggesting a rate rise could yet happen shortly.

Oil has come under pressure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57baa217e4b0377cf1118f4e#block-57baa217e4b0377cf1118f4e>
 as hopes fade that OPEC may come up with an agreement to support prices at its 
meeting next month. In a note today,Morgan Stanley suggested any deal was 
unlikely 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57badf4ee4b0377cf111902f#block-57badf4ee4b0377cf111902f>
. The strength of the dollar is also having an impact on the crude price.

And on the deal front, Pfizer is paying $14bn for cancer specialist Medivation.

On the markets, the FTSE 100 is currently down 41 points or 0.6%, Germany’s 
Dax has dropped 0.79% and France’s Cac is 0.4% lower. European markets have 
seen their declines accelerate as Wall Street opens. The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average is down 80 points in early trading.

On that note, we’ll close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.

The strength of the dollar - lifted by growing talk of a Federal Reserve rate 
rise before too long - has helped push down gold and silver prices.

Gold has fallen from $1340 an ounce at the open to $1337 while silver has gone 
from $18.96 to $18.93.

In turn this has left shares in precious metal miners Randgold Resources and 
Fresnillo lower, and helped push the FTSE 100 into negative territory.

, Royal Bank of Scotland has started charging some corporate clients to hold 
their cash, but its chairman Howard Davis has just been questioning the current 
ultra low interest rate policies from central banks. Sean Farrell reports:

As Royal Bank of Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup> started 
charging some clients to hold their cash, its chairman has questioned the 
effectiveness of ultra-low interest rates and called for a rethink of monetary 
policy .

From Monday, RBS will charge interest to about 70 customers, such as banks and 
pension funds, on the cash they place with the state-controlled bank as 
collateral for trading complex financial products 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/19/rbs-to-charge-major-financial-institutions-for-holding-their-cash>
.

It is the first time a bank has imposed charges for sterling holdings since 
the BoE halved interest rates to a new record low 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates>
 of 0.25% on 4 August and restarted its quantitative easing (QE) programme of 
government bond purchases. The BoE relaxed monetary policy in an effort to 
support the economy following the vote to leave the EU by discouraging banks 
from hoarding cash.

RBS’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said that as interest rates get closer to 
zero the central bank loses control of the effects of monetary policy and 
leaves itself few options for action iin a recession.

Davies told Bloomberg TV: “When you reach the lower band you don’t know how 
the economy will respond … We don’t really know what impact QE on the scale it 
is being implemented is having. I really do think we are entering a period 
where some of the previous certainties are no longer quite so certain and you 
really need to rethink the monetary policy framework.”

Back with oil, and Morgan Stanley does not expect any major decisions from 
next month’s OPEC meeting, despite the market’s earlier optimism that an 
agreement to support crude prices could emerge.

In a new note, the bank’s commodity strategist Adam Longson said:

We continue to view a meaningful OPEC production agreement as highly unlikely, 
but we would not be dismissive of the short term price impact of an OPEC 
meeting. Comments about intervention alone can scare off shorts. However, we 
see too many headwinds and logistical challenges to a meaningful deal given 
past statements by OPEC and its members regarding the positive state of 
markets, domestic output goals and objections from members producing below 
potential. In fact, the market has misinterpreted some recent comments from 
Saudi Arabia, in our view, without seeing the full quote or context.

He continued:

Oil Minister Al-Falih has said “We are, in Saudi Arabia, watching the market 
closely, and if there is a need to take any action to help the market 
rebalance, then we would, of course in cooperation with OPEC and major non- 
OPEC exporters.” This is the same talking point the kingdom has been using for 
some time. It neither acknowledges the need for action, nor firmly commits 
Saudi Arabia to participate if certain parameters are met. We agree with 
Rapidan Group that it is unlikely Riyadh will take any freeze negotiation 
seriously as officials believe the market share policy is slowly but surely 
working.

Few OPEC members have expressed a need for a freeze, with the exception of 
Venezuela. Members with production outages have been less supportive of a 
production freeze this time as well, with Nigeria now joining the dissent.

revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer. The 
addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer’s Innovative Health business and 
accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key 
focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that 
business over the long-term. This transaction is another example of how we are 
effectively deploying our capital to generate attractive returns and create 
shareholder value.

This is the latest deal from the acquisitive Pfizer. In April it scrapped 
plans to merge with Ireland’s Allergan and in 2014 a proposal to buy 
AstraZeneca for more than £69bn collapsed. But it has since completed the 
smaller takeovers of Anacor and Hospira.

Here’s an interesting table from money transfer specialists HiFX, showing how 
sterling has fallen since the Brexit vote against a range of currencies.

The pound has been under pressure everywhere, but the smallest declines - 
relatively - have come against the Swedish and Turkish currencies:
 The pound’s decline since EU referendum Photograph: HiFX 
Andy Scott, economist, HiFX sais:

Since the UK voted to leave the EU we have seen the ramifications unfold. 
Sterling has dropped against most of the world’s currencies and fell further by 
1% cent against the Dollar and the Euro following the Bank of England’s recent 
decision to cut interest rates.

However, it is important to note that while sterling trades on the back foot 
due to the Brexit uncertainty, we are starting to see signs of sterling regain 
its footing and some lost territory. Its journey back to the levels of the 
evening of June 23rd is still distant; however it looks like we have already 
seen the ‘Brexit Bottom for Sterling’.

In an unusual move, City fund manager Neil Woodford has abolished all staff 
bonuses at his investment firm. The Times reports:

One of the most prominent figures in the City has taken the unprecedented step 
of permanently abolishing all staff bonuses at his firm.

Neil Woodford, the star stock-picker and founder of Woodford Investment 
Management, has rejected the conventional wisdom that bonuses are essential to 
motivate and retain staff and has put everyone on a flat salary.

The new pay scheme was quietly introduced on April 1 for the firm’s 35 staff, 
who include sales people, traders, fund managers and analysts as well as IT, 
marketing and compliance professionals.

There’s been a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical deal, more fallout from the 
Brexit vote and markets are jittery ahead of a speech later in the week from US 
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, on what was originally looking like a quiet 
summer Monday.

On the Brexit front, financial firms believe the impact of the vote to leave 
the European Union has not so far been as stark as expected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57ba98f6e4b047b85f60268a#block-57ba98f6e4b047b85f60268a>
. But the UK housing market is likely to contract next year in the wake of the 
decision, said estate agents Countrywide.

Meanwhile, markets are heading lower and the dollar is climbing again ahead of 
anyinterest rate comments from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole symposium on 
Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57baa2cae4b0b7e649001e8e#block-57baa2cae4b0b7e649001e8e>
. Investors are uncertain about the prospect for rates, given that last week’s 
dovish Fed minutes were followed by comments from Fed members including Stanley 
Fischer suggesting a rate rise could yet happen shortly.

Oil has come under pressure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57baa217e4b0377cf1118f4e#block-57baa217e4b0377cf1118f4e>
 as hopes fade that OPEC may come up with an agreement to support prices at its 
meeting next month. In a note today,Morgan Stanley suggested any deal was 
unlikely 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57badf4ee4b0377cf111902f#block-57badf4ee4b0377cf111902f>
. The strength of the dollar is also having an impact on the crude price.

And on the deal front, Pfizer is paying $14bn for cancer specialist Medivation.

On the markets, the FTSE 100 is currently down 41 points or 0.6%, Germany’s 
Dax has dropped 0.79% and France’s Cac is 0.4% lower. European markets have 
seen their declines accelerate as Wall Street opens. The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average is down 80 points in early trading.

On that note, we’ll close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
With all the speculation about when the US Federal Reserve may raise interest 
rates, here is a bit of better than expected economic news.

The strength of the dollar - lifted by growing talk of a Federal Reserve rate 
rise before too long - has helped push down gold and silver prices.

Gold has fallen from $1340 an ounce at the open to $1337 while silver has gone 
from $18.96 to $18.93.

In turn this has left shares in precious metal miners Randgold Resources and 
Fresnillo lower, and helped push the FTSE 100 into negative territory.
 
As reported earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57baa6a5e4b0377cf1118f58#block-57baa6a5e4b0377cf1118f58>
, Royal Bank of Scotland has started charging some corporate clients to hold 
their cash, but its chairman Howard Davis has just been questioning the current 
ultra low interest rate policies from central banks. Sean Farrell reports:

As Royal Bank of Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup> started 
charging some clients to hold their cash, its chairman has questioned the 
effectiveness of ultra-low interest rates and called for a rethink of monetary 
policy .

From Monday, RBS will charge interest to about 70 customers, such as banks and 
pension funds, on the cash they place with the state-controlled bank as 
collateral for trading complex financial products 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/19/rbs-to-charge-major-financial-institutions-for-holding-their-cash>
.

It is the first time a bank has imposed charges for sterling holdings since 
the BoE halved interest rates to a new record low 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates>
 of 0.25% on 4 August and restarted its quantitative easing (QE) programme of 
government bond purchases. The BoE relaxed monetary policy in an effort to 
support the economy following the vote to leave the EU by discouraging banks 
from hoarding cash.

RBS’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said that as interest rates get closer to 
zero the central bank loses control of the effects of monetary policy and 
leaves itself few options for action iin a recession.

Davies told Bloomberg TV: “When you reach the lower band you don’t know how 
the economy will respond … We don’t really know what impact QE on the scale it 
is being implemented is having. I really do think we are entering a period 
where some of the previous certainties are no longer quite so certain and you 
really need to rethink the monetary policy framework.”

Back with oil, and Morgan Stanley does not expect any major decisions from 
next month’s OPEC meeting, despite the market’s earlier optimism that an 
agreement to support crude prices could emerge.

In a new note, the bank’s commodity strategist Adam Longson said:

We continue to view a meaningful OPEC production agreement as highly unlikely, 
but we would not be dismissive of the short term price impact of an OPEC 
meeting. Comments about intervention alone can scare off shorts. However, we 
see too many headwinds and logistical challenges to a meaningful deal given 
past statements by OPEC and its members regarding the positive state of 
markets, domestic output goals and objections from members producing below 
potential. In fact, the market has misinterpreted some recent comments from 
Saudi Arabia, in our view, without seeing the full quote or context.

He continued:

Oil Minister Al-Falih has said “We are, in Saudi Arabia, watching the market 
closely, and if there is a need to take any action to help the market 
rebalance, then we would, of course in cooperation with OPEC and major non- 
OPEC exporters.” This is the same talking point the kingdom has been using for 
some time. It neither acknowledges the need for action, nor firmly commits 
Saudi Arabia to participate if certain parameters are met. We agree with 
Rapidan Group that it is unlikely Riyadh will take any freeze negotiation 
seriously as officials believe the market share policy is slowly but surely 
working.

Few OPEC members have expressed a need for a freeze, with the exception of 
Venezuela. Members with production outages have been less supportive of a 
production freeze this time as well, with Nigeria now joining the dissent.

Pfizer has confirmed earlier report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/22/financial-firms-shrug-off-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-57baabc5e4b047b85f6026b9#block-57baabc5e4b047b85f6026b9>
s and announced 
<http://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_to_acquire_medivation>
 the $14bn takeover of cancer specialist Medivation. Pfizer boss Ian Read said:

The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate 
revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer. The 
addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer’s Innovative Health business and 
accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key 
focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that 
business over the long-term. This transaction is another example of how we are 
effectively deploying our capital to generate attractive returns and create 
shareholder value.

This is the latest deal from the acquisitive Pfizer. In April it scrapped 
plans to merge with Ireland’s Allergan and in 2014 a proposal to buy 
AstraZeneca for more than £69bn collapsed. But it has since completed the 
smaller takeovers of Anacor and Hospira.
 
With trading light, we are seeing some bumpy movements in stock markets, which 
have now lost their earlier gains.

Barclays believes US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen could hint at a 
September rate rise:

Despite the dip in the oil price, stock markets have recovered from their 
early losses. With the FTSE 100 holding firm at around 6 points higher, 
Germany’s Dax is now up 0.8% while France’s Cac has climbed 0.7% and the Stoxx 
Europe 600 is up 0.7%.

Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta is among the main risers, up 12% to 
a 14 month high after US regulators cleared its $44bn takeover by ChemChina.

Here’s an interesting table from money transfer specialists HiFX, showing how 
sterling has fallen since the Brexit vote against a range of currencies.

The pound has been under pressure everywhere, but the smallest declines - 
relatively - have come against the Swedish and Turkish currencies:
 The pound’s decline since EU referendum Photograph: HiFX 
Andy Scott, economist, HiFX sais:

Since the UK voted to leave the EU we have seen the ramifications unfold. 
Sterling has dropped against most of the world’s currencies and fell further by 
1% cent against the Dollar and the Euro following the Bank of England’s recent 
decision to cut interest rates.

However, it is important to note that while sterling trades on the back foot 
due to the Brexit uncertainty, we are starting to see signs of sterling regain 
its footing and some lost territory. Its journey back to the levels of the 
evening of June 23rd is still distant; however it looks like we have already 
seen the ‘Brexit Bottom for Sterling’.
 
In an unusual move, City fund manager Neil Woodford has abolished all staff 
bonuses at his investment firm. The Times reports:

One of the most prominent figures in the City has taken the unprecedented step 
of permanently abolishing all staff bonuses at his firm.

Neil Woodford, the star stock-picker and founder of Woodford Investment 
Management, has rejected the conventional wisdom that bonuses are essential to 
motivate and retain staff and has put everyone on a flat salary.

The new pay scheme was quietly introduced on April 1 for the firm’s 35 staff, 
who include sales people, traders, fund managers and analysts as well as IT, 
marketing and compliance professionals.
