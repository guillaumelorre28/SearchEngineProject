Protesters across the US were on Friday gearing up for weekend demonstrations 
over the election ofDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, as other activists began 
work on plans to disrupt the Republican’s inauguration in Washington early next 
year.

Rowdy protests against Trump and his divisive campaign have spread to cities 
all over the country following his victory on Tuesday, leading to dozens of 
arrests and a complaint from Trump in one of his first public remarks as 
president-elect.

More than 10,000 people have signed up to attend a noon march on Saturday from 
New York’s Union Square to Trump Tower, the future president’s home and 
corporate headquarters, while several other actions are planned for other 
cities.

“Join us in the streets! Stop Trump and his bigoted agenda,” the organizers of 
theNew York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> event said in a 
Facebook post.

Trump complained 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/796900183955095552> in a tweet late 
on Thursday that “professional protesters, incited by the media” were 
tarnishing his electoral success, which he said was “very unfair”. Amid intense 
criticism, Trump said hours later in a second post that he appreciated the 
“passion for our great country” shown by demonstrators.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional 
protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!

Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for 
our great country. We will all come together and be proud!

Activists expressed determination to build momentum for major activity on 20 
January, when Trump will officially enter the White House.

A “million women” march on the capital is being planned for the day of Trump’s 
inauguration, amid intense anger that the next US president allegedly sexually 
assaulted multiple women andboasted of doing so in a leaked recording 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
.

Leftwing and anarchist groups were also making plans for protests in 
Washington on inauguration day, according to flyers circulating online, raising 
the prospect of chaotic scenes as Trump takes the oath of office.

Other activists were biding their time before mounting a response to Trump’s 
election. Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter, said 
their movement was “grieving and mourning” following the result.

“We are bringing folks together to imagine what kinds of organizing we will 
need to do under a Trump presidency,” said Cullors. “I do think we can organize 
as we have been, and build something bigger and stronger than the hate Trump 
and his team have exhibited towards marginalized communities.”


Thousands of people took to the streets from Thursday night into Friday in 
Denver, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Portland, Oakland and several other US cities, 
as well as Vancouver, Canada. The protests were for the most part peaceful and 
orderly, though there were scattered acts of civil disobedience and damage to 
property.

The rowdiest scenes were in Portland, Oregon, where about 4,000 people marched 
into the city centre late on Thursday. At least 29 people were arrested after a 
minority of protesters threw objects at officers, smashed shop windows and 
damaged a car dealership, the Portland police department said, declaring the 
demonstration a riot. Officers used pepper spray and rubber projectiles to 
disperse the crowd, the department added.

In Minneapolis, dozens of people marched on to Interstate 94, blocking traffic 
in both directions for at least an hour as police stood by. A smaller band of 
demonstrators briefly halted traffic on a busy Los Angeles highway before 
police cleared them off.


Baltimore police reported that about 600 people marched through the Inner 
Harbor area, with some blocking roadways by sitting in the street. Two people 
were arrested, police said. One of the largest demonstrations was in Denver, 
where a crowd estimated to number about 3,000 gathered on the grounds of the 
Colorado state capitol and marched through the city centre.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco> walked out of class too, 
and took to the streets of downtown, shouting “Not my president”, “My body, my 
choice” and “Love trumps hate” as they marched in the middle of traffic.

Malkia Williams, 15, who carried a sign that said “Pussy grabs back” – a 
reference to a leaked recording where Trumpbragged he could sexually assault 
women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
 because of his fame – said it was important for students to speak out since 
they could not vote.

“A lot of adults voted for Donald Trump and they think we don’t care, but we 
do,” she said as she marched down a busy downtown street where student 
activists were temporarily halting vehicles, with many honking in support. “My 
loved ones and friends could be taken out of this country.”

Williams said she was still processing Trump’s victory. “I still don’t feel 
it’s real. This is not the future we want,” she said.

In Oakland, where 30 people were arrested 
<http://www.ktvu.com/news/216664942-story> on Wednesday night, a crowd gathered 
on Thursday but the protests were more subdued than the previous evening, when 
a series of small fires were set, some windows were smashed and a few people 
threw rocks at police.

to alocal ABC affiliate station, WISN 12 
<http://www.wisn.com/article/anti-trump-protest-expected-at-red-arrow-park/8270467>

according to theMilwaukee Journal-Sentinel

<http://www.kgw.com/news/local/dont-shoot-portland-leader-on-why-trump-protests-shut-highway-in-portland/350862192>
: “We think that because Trump is president, it becomes even more urgent for 
our city to become what people want it to be. It’s an anti-Trump protest but 
also a call for change in our city because we need to push for progress here.”

Elsewhere on Thursday, hundreds protested in Salt Lake City, Utah 
<https://twitter.com/AshleyMoser/status/796895558505897984>; San Francisco;

At least 200 people rallied there after dark, many of them chanting “No hate! 
No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!” and carrying signs with such slogans as 
“Impeach Trump” and “Not my president.”


“I can’t support someone who supports so much bigotry and hatred. It’s 
heart-breaking,” said 25-year-old Joe Daniels from Virginia.

While protesters marched against Trump, at least one group was preparing to 
take to the streets in celebration. The Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan 
said on their website they would be holding a “victory parade” in North 
Carolina next month. Men in KKK-style white hoods were seen walking in the 
state on the morning after Trump was elected.
