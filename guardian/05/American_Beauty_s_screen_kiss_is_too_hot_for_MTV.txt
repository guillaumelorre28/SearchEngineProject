Dreamworks, the studio behind Oscar-winning American Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-beauty> has refused to let MTV use a 
clip of Kevin Spacey and Mena Suvari in a clinch for the network's ninth annual 
Movie Awards, despite the smooch snagging a viewers' nomination for best 
onscreen kiss.

Awards show producer Joel Gallen says the nomination was pulled because 
DreamWorks disapproved.

"They wouldn't clear it for us. It's a shame," Gallen says. "We generate 
nominees by viewer survey, and that came in the top five, but the only way it 
works is if we get the clips. Obviously, it was a very controversial kiss, and 
DreamWorks felt it was out of context without being part of the overall movie."

American Beauty's questionable kiss features Kevin Spacey's 40-something 
character realising his fantasies surrounding his teenage daughter's nubile 
best friend.

A DreamWorks spokesperson said the studio didn't want the scene glorified by 
MTV's light-hearted award for best onscreen kiss.

"It's inappropriate to celebrate a relationship between a 16-year-old girl and 
a 40-year-old man within the context of a 'Best Kiss' clip" a representative 
said. "Within the context of the entire movie, the relationship is made clear, 
and the kiss is seen as inappropriate."
