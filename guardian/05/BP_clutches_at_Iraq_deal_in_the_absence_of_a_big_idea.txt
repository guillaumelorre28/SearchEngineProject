It is not hard to see why BP has fought hard to win startling concessions

 from Baghdad: Iraq needs more oil from the giant Rumaila field but the British 
firm is in desperate need of new success too.

BP is currently in the doldrums and investors are becoming restless. New chief 
executive Bob Dudley had hoped to light a fire under the sagging share price by 
tying up the Arctic deal and share swap with Rosneft. That collapsed in a heap 
of acrimony, despite the huge billing when unveiled in January, and legal 
action againstBP <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp> by angry TNK-BP 
investors continues.

Another £5bn-plus strategic tie-up with India's Reliance Industries – called 
"transformational" in February – has just gained Delhi's approval but has 
soured slightly since Reliance suffered a major downturn in gas output.

BP has been looking at a possible US shale gas deal but is wary, given the 
environmental issues over "fracking" – a technique for extracting natural gas – 
at a time when the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is still firmly in Americans' minds.

Rival Shell, meanwhile, has sailed ahead with second-quarter profits of $8bn 
compared with BP's $5.3bn. Shell's boss, Peter Voser, dismisses suggestions it 
would be a good time to launch a BP takeover but Dudley did not rule out the 
idea he could do his own break-up in the wake of similar moves by 
ConocoPhillips and MarathonOil <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil>.

Shareholders are wary of that, not least because they predict political 
objections in Westminster to a massive downsizing that would spell an end to BP 
acting as any kind of national champion. But BP needs to find a big idea fast 
to save the longer-serving chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg's bacon – if not 
Dudley's. For now, it will have to be Iraq.
