It was Tonino Guerra's fate to become the scriptwriter of choice for a string 
of master directors whose status as auteurs – "authors" of their films – tended 
to diminish the status of the writers involved. Nevertheless, Guerra 
established himself as a major figure in Italian cinema during its golden 
period in the 1960s and early 70s, as well as venturing further afield to 
collaborate with the likes of Tarkovsky and Angelopoulos.

But it is the amazing string of films he made with Michelangelo Antonioni for 
which he will primarily be remembered. After spending time as a schoolteacher 
in his 20s, he broke into the film industry in his 30s, receiving his first 
credit aged 37 for Man and Wolves, by Bitter Rice director Giuseppe de Santis. 
But it was the first film he worked on with Antonioni, 1960sL'Avventura 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76695/avventura>, which proved his 
breakthrough – as it was Antonioni's. Antonioni came up with the story idea – a 
group of bored rich kids take a yacht to a small island, where one of ther 
number mysteriously disappears – but Guerra and fellow writer Elio Bartolini 
gave it its layered, novelistic texture. But it wasn't simply about dialogue, 
as the wordless final scene, in all its elliptical mystery, demonstrates.

Guerra then in quick succession worked on three more films for Antonioni. La 
Notte <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76136/notte>, L'Eclisse 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/85119/eclisse> and The Red Desert 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76238/red-desert> each secured a little 
more Antonioni's position as the key film-maker of the mid-60s. All of them 
featured Monica Vitti, and all seemed to evoke the lassitude and disconnect at 
the heart of the seemingly prosperous postwar boom time. La Notte, the second 
in a trilogy, had Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni as a jaded married 
couple whose friend is dying in hospital.

Next was L'Eclisse, which Martin Scorsese described as the "boldest" 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d0eFv1vHxo> of this trilogy. "It felt less 
like a story and more like a poem." Alain Delon and Monica Vitti are the lovers 
pursuing an uncertain affair; like La Notte, its final scene is a masterpiece 
of emptiness and ambiguity.

1964 saw two contrasting projects for Guerra. Marriage Italian Style 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/81778/marriage.-.italian.style>, directed 
by Vittorio de Sica and starring Mastroianni and Sophia Loren in their prime, 
was a sophisticated comedy playing on Italian gender stereotypes. It broke out 
into the international marketplace, earning Loren an Oscar nomination.

Meanwhile, he collaborated with Antonioni on another imagist masterpiece of 
despair and ennui, The Red Desert. Vitti, again, is superb as the isolated 
woman married to a petrochemical engineer; the clip above is virtually a lament 
for her character's lost childhood.

Guerra received an Oscar nomination in 1966 for the sex comedy Casanova 70 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHk8m1j0Mk> (and surely the inspiration for 
the Italian section of Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted to Know About 
Sex), but presumably was prouder of the one he received a year later for yet 
another Antonioni collaboration,Blow-Up 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36260/blow-up> - even if Edward Bond 
wrote the English dialogue.

Guerra also worked on the screenplay for another of Antonioni's counterculture 
classics,Zabriskie Point 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76284/zabriskie-point>, but appeared more 
comfortable working on radical Italian films like Francesco Rosi's Il Caso 
Mattei, about the Italian oil-industry administator who died mysteriously in 
1962.

He would find a new collaborator in arguably the only serious challenger to 
Antonioni's status as Italy's premier director, Federico Fellini.Amarcord 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76630/amarcord> was their first film 
together, a nostalgic evocation of their childhoods in 30s Emilia-Romagna, and 
remains arguably Guerra's most fondly remembered.

In the 1980s Guerra found himself working with a new generation of Italian 
directors, notably the Taviani brothers. After adding to their 1982 film The 
Night of San Lorenzo, Guerra wrote the screenplay for Kaos, the 1984 adaptation 
of Pirandello stories.

In between those two films however, came perhaps Guerra's greatest film: 
Nostalgia, directed byAndrei Tarkovsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/andrei-tarkovsky>. Tarkovsky, filming in 
Italy and incurring the displeasure of the Soviet authorities, relied on Guerra 
as his guide; you can discern something of their relationship in the fraught 
dealings between writer Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) and his translator 
Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano).

Guerra's last great collaboration was with Greek auteur Theo Angelopoulos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/theo-angelopoulos>, who himself died earlier 
this year. They first worked together on Voyage to Cythera, Angelopoulos's 1984 
dreamlike fable about a film-maker attempting to tell the story of a political 
exile recently returned from the Soviet Union. Guerra won his only Cannes 
award, for best screenplay.

A string of Angelopoulos films followed, including Landscape in the Mist and 
Ulysses Gaze. But Guerra's loyalty to Antonioni remained, and though the 
83-year-old director was incapacitated with a stroke,Beyond the Clouds 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/58851/beyond.the.clouds> was completed 
with the help of Wim Wenders, and became Antonioni's last feature film.

Guerra's last major credit was The Dust of Time 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144519/dust-of-time> – the film that was 
also Angelopoulos' final completed feature. The second of the trilogy started 
by The Weeping Meadow. here Willem Dafoe is a Greek-American film-maker whose 
film about his parents is also the story of the turbulent 20th century.
