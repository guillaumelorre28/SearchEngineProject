Australia’s former prime minister, Julia Gillard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/julia-gillard>, has defended her legacy on 
asylum seeker policies, saying that her government’s hardline approach was 
justified on humanitarian grounds.

“I stand by the decisions I made,” she told the host of al-Jazeera’s show 
UpFront, Mehdi Hasan. “We took a set of decisions in a very difficult time when 
we were seeing increasing numbers and we were worried about deaths.”

“The government I led was trying to do everything it could to deter people 
from getting on boats,” Gillard said. “Our message to people who were desperate 
and fleeing hard circumstances was we are going to take refugees, but don’t try 
and make the journey by boat. You may not survive; your children may not 
survive.”

, reinstating the Howard-era “Pacific solution” that had been discarded by 
Kevin Rudd after the 2007 federal election.


The reinstatement of the Pacific solution came after a boat bound for 
Australia carrying more than 200 people capsized off the coast of Indonesia 
just before Christmas in 2011. The tragedy sparked debate on the best way to 
tackle the large number of boat arrivals that had attempted to make the 
dangerous journey since Labor dismantled John Howard’s tough asylum policies.

“You don’t quite know what it’s like as prime minister to get the telephone 
call from your defence forces that tell you that they suspect that an asylum 
seeker boat has gone down and they are engaging in desperate measures to try 
and rescue people from the water,” said Gillard. “Whatever they do, people die.”

“The hardline approach, in my view, does have a humanitarian underpinning 
which is we do not want people taking that journey and running those risks,” 
the former prime minister said.

 Gillard was deposed as prime minister by Rudd in June 2013, and left politics 
at the following election. She is currently the chair of the Global Partnership 
for Education, and has spoken publicly of her passion for improving education 
rates among girls.

Gillard went on the defensive when Hasan asked her how her drive to help 
children fitted with putting them in offshore detention.

“We took a set of decisions in a very difficult time,” she said. “To suggest 
that that record in any way undermines my passion or my credibility on 
education is to wholly misunderstand it.”

Gillard has been selective about her public appearances since leaving politics,
chastising the Australian media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/23/julia-gillard-exclusive-interview-the-timid-abc-is-rewarding-tony-abbott>
 in her June 2015 biography, My Story, for being biased and inaccurate.

The interview will air on al-Jazeera on Saturday morning Australian time.
