 ‘A beautiful, trenchant exploration of divided and whole selves’: Zadie Smith’s
Swing Time. Photograph: Brian Dowling/Getty Images 
Two young women growing up in London both aspire to be dancers, but only one 
of them has talent. The novel tracks their childhood and a huge schism in their 
friendship. One character works for a version of MTV, which seems like such a 
bygone era. I was drawn to Zadie’s exploration of this time, when these 
structures seemed very impervious to change – that hubris before the fall. I 
always like those contexts. It is a beautiful, trenchant exploration of divided 
and whole selves, and the ways a sense of partiality determines what we seek. 
Searching for completion in others is both an act of self-preservation and 
self-obfuscation. Plus there’s so much about movement, music, bodies, and all 
the ways we perform selfhood, girlhood and friendship.

. But this Steve Gunn record stands out. It has such a soaring quality – I 
think it’s some of my favourite guitar-playing in the past decade. There’s 
certainly precedent to it – Pink Floyd and the Grateful Dead – but it’s unique. 
Because I don’t listen to much guitar-based music, I forget that it’s an 
emotional instrument. Every once in a while I’m reminded that we don’t need to 
keep deconstructing and manipulating it in order for it to tell a story. That’s 
what this record made me feel – the simplicity and primacy of the story. I was 
almost relieved by it. I listen to it every Sunday when I read the paper.

Butler, on show as part of Radio Imagination. Photograph: Connie Samaras / 
Armory Center for the Arts 
Admittedly, I am a little late coming to sci-fi. I went to this Octavia Butler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/16/guardianobituaries.bookscomment> 
show and realised that there was this world that millions of people are drawn 
to, and here was someone that I’d never heard of – this award-winning woman, 
one of the best known in the field. I felt this complete lack of awareness 
about somebody who seemed to completely resonate with my own explorations in 
music and writing. The exhibit finds a handful of artists creating works 
inspired by Butler’s writing. Since so much of her work is about freedom and 
self-examination, the pieces take on modes of expansion, both internal and 
external. It got me completely down this track of reading Butler and alsoUrsula 
K Le Guin

 ‘Like an epic poem’: Thandie Newton stars in Westworld. Photograph: HBO 
In a television landscape that has become granular in its storytelling, 
Westworld came in like an epic poem. I love narratives that tackle universal 
themes placed within small, precise contexts, but occasionally I like to see 
grand themes be sprawling. More and more, science fiction feels like a 
prescient and progressive take on humanism and futurism. I don’t know how to 
dissect the present tense without the lens that science fiction and absurdity 
provide. It’s dystopian sometimes, but there’s potentially an optimism that 
permeates it – I am fascinated by a belief in the power of imagination, and the 
need to protect it. AlthoughWestworld speaks to the aforementioned, I watch it 
for pure escapism at this point.

 ‘I like getting a sense of both emergence and provenance’: BackStory With the 
American History Guys. 
Each week these three history professors explore a current event through the 
events of past centuries, which I find strangely reassuring. Everything feels 
so unprecedented right now, and there’s a heaviness to something that feels 
brand new. The slightly alarmist way that the media report events gives news an 
urgency and a direness. Not that things aren’t urgent or dire, but precedence 
makes things feel part of a pattern, and even if that’s a pernicious pattern, 
it’s helpful for comprehension. There is so much that we take for granted as 
being intrinsic to our lives, not just technologies, but entire concepts. I 
like getting a sense of both emergence and provenance because it forces me to 
examine notions of fundamentalism and certainty.

 ‘Delilciously simple’: Hat Yai restaurant, Portland, Oregon. Photograph: 
http://hatyaipdx.com 
I decided to start cutting out the superfluous. Not that I have anything 
against social media, but I stopped looking at Twitter and Instagram because I 
felt like it was becoming white noise and getting in the way of retention of 
information and concentration. I’ve streamlined my habits in order to create 
regimen and structure, because otherwise I feel like I’m dabbling constantly. 
It’s almost a system overload, so even with eating I’ve become very habitual. 
I’m trying to create routine and habit, almost as a form of meditation. This 
Thai restaurant serves a really delicious, simple menu: fried chicken, curry, 
roti. And that seems like the perfect antidote to the overly fussy, precious 
presentation of cuisine. I eat probably half my meals there every week.
