For a few weeks a year, when my body craves cooling food, lunches and dinners 
are built around interesting salads, raw vegetables and simple plates of fruit. 
It’s not how I eat all year – in fact, if you tried to persuade me to eat a raw 
vegetable for dinner in the dead of winter you’d have quite a battle on your 
hands. But, come summer, I try and make use of vegetables that we are more 
familiar with eating when cooked, putting them to work in new ways. They don’t 
require a hob to be lit, but will satisfy my cravings for flavour and 
refreshing, colourful food. Cooking in this way means almost instant 
gratification and uses simple and cheap favourites; here, cauliflower, carrots 
and late summer fruits.

The key with eating veg raw is how it is prepared. Cutting wispy, cool, 
paper-thin fronds of fennel or delicately grating carrot will have an impact on 
how the vegetable tastes – these little pieces will have a more subtle flavour 
and texture, and better ability to absorb a dressing. If your knife skills 
aren’t up to wafers of veg, then a mandolin or a speed peeler will come in 
handy.

Eating raw food has been well documented, has a devoted following and some 
pretty convincing benefits, but, for me, it’s only really this time of year to 
which it feels suited. I cook this way based on the mood of the day rather than 
the need to eat a certain way, though, I have to confess, it does leave me 
feeling great. You don’t have to be too strict though, some toasted seeds and 
nuts, chickpeas or a flatbread taste great with these salads.

I’ve also included a quick guide on how to sprout seeds and pulses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jul/15/how-to-grow-sprouting-seeds-mung-beans-alfalfa-seeds>
. Soaking and sprouting replicates germination, which activates and multiplies 
nutrients, making sprouts one of the most alive foods there is. If sprouting is 
a bridge too far for you, then you can buy them in good greengrocers, and some 
supermarkets too.

Carrot and mustard seed salad

I ate this simple salad almost every day in southern India. The sprouted mung 
beans add a refreshing crunch. There is a quick guide on sprouting your own 
seeds and pulses at home below.

Serves 4
50g (a small handful) unsweetened desiccated coconut
2 tbsp olive or coconut oil
1 tsp black mustard seeds
10 curry leaves
200g carrots
4 big handfuls of spinach
50g sprouted mung beans
A small thumb of grated ginger
The juice of ½ a lemon
A handful of cashew nuts, roughly chopped
Salt and black pepper
A small bunch of coriander, roughly chopped

1 Soak the coconut in about 100ml of boiling water.

2 Meanwhile, make your dressing. Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat, add 
the mustard seeds and let them crackle and pop. Lower the heat, add the curry 
leaves and stir for a few seconds, then take off the heat and pour the mixture 
into a small bowl to cool.

3 Peel, wash and grate the carrots into ribbons with a speed peeler, then put 
into a big serving bowl. Wash and dry the spinach, then add this too, along 
with the mung beans. Drain the coconut well and add this, too.

4 Grate the ginger into the cooled oil and mustard seeds, squeeze in the lemon 
juice and season well with salt and pepper. Drizzle the mix over the carrots 
and spinach, then finish with the chopped coriander and cashews.

Raw cauliflower salad

Raw cauliflower has a pleasingly creamy crunch, here it has been offset by 
bright radishes and anise notes from dill or tarragon. I often make this with 
coconut yoghurt, which works well too.

Serves 4
1 cucumber, seeded, cut into small pieces
1 medium head of cauliflower, trimmed and chopped into tiny florets or finely 
sliced
1 bunch radishes, trimmed, thinly sliced
2 green chillies, deseeded, thinly sliced
100g skin-on almonds
A small bunch of dill or tarragon, roughly chopped
A small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped

For the dressing
200g Greek yoghurt
5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
The juice of ½ a lemon
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp honey
Salt and black pepper

1 First, make the yoghurt dressing by whisking all the ingredients together.

2 Mix all the remaining ingredients together with the dressing and let it all 
stand for 15 minutes, so the flavours can mingle together and the cauliflower 
softens slightly.

3 Transfer the salad to a serving platter and top with the almonds.

Late-summer fruits with lime leaves

The lime leaves, lemongrass and citrus make a dressing for the fruit salad 
here as you might any other salad.

 Salad days: Now’s the time for white peaches, nectarines, yellow plums and 
blackberries, says Anna, but ‘use whatever ripe and delicious fruit you have to 
hand.’ Photograph: Issy Crocker for the Guardian 
Serves 4
A stalk of lemongrass
4 lime leaves
A pinch of sea salt
The juice of a lemon
The juice and zest of a lime
2 tbsp honey
Seeds from 1 vanilla pod
20 mint leaves, very finely chopped
Fruit (I used a mixture of white peaches, nectarines, yellow plums and 
blackberries)

1 First, remove the hard outer leaves of the lemongrass to expose the tender 
inner bit. Discard the outer leaves, then chop the inner portion very finely. 
Chop the lime leaves finely, too. Use a pestle and mortar to pound the chopped 
lemongrass and the lime leaves with the salt – bash well until everything is 
fine.

2 Whisk together the citrus juice and zest with the honey, vanilla seeds and 
the lime-lemongrass mixture. Set aside.

3 Cut the fruit into pretty, bite-sized pieces and lay it all in a large bowl 
or on a platter. Drizzle with about half of the dressing. Give it a taste and 
keep adding until it tastes just right. You could serve this with a little 
creme fraiche, coconut yoghurt or thick Greek yoghurt, if you like. For a bit 
of crunch, some chopped toasted nuts or coconut would make a nice addition.

Easy sprouting at home

Soak Put 2-4 tbsp dried pulses, grains or seeds (see the list below) in a 
large, wide-mouthed jar. Cover the top with a bit of muslin or a thin tea towel 
and secure with rubber band. Fill with cold water, then swirl around to wash 
and drain well. Cover with room temperature water and soak for at least 4 hours 
or overnight. Never fill the jar more then 1/3 with the dry seeds as they grow 
as they soak and sprout.

Drain Drain the water from your sprouts by inverting the jar at an angle in 
the sink or on a plate. Transfer to a cool place and leave to do their thing.

Rinse Rinse your sprouts twice a day with cold water then drain well as above.

Ready? When the little shoots that have grown from your sprouts are about 
1-2cm long they are ready to eat. This will take 1-3 days, depending on the 
seed or pulse you choose and the weather.

Store Rinse once more in cold water, then pop the lid on the jar and put in 
the fridge, they will last for 4-5 days.

What can I sprout? Dried Lentils, dried chickpeas, dried mung beans, alfalfa 
seeds, mustard seeds, radish seeds, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, 
sunflower seeds, wild rice. The vegetarian times has a usefultable on soaking 
times
