Doctor Who
5.45pm, BBC1

Returning for his third festive outing as the Doctor, Peter Capaldi mosies 
down to Manhattan to battle brain-swapping beasties with the help of a masked 
superhero (Justin Chatwin), Matt Lucas (reprising his role from last year’s 
special) and Wolf Hall’s Charity Wakefield. Who Christmas specials have, 
historically, been something of a mixed bag, straining to cater to fans and 
non-fans alike. But it wouldn’t be Christmas without them, would it?Luke Holland

The Great Christmas Bake Off
 4.45pm, BBC1

This two-part festive special is exactly as you might imagine: wall-to-wall 
Christmas jumpers, twinkly carols and terrible seasonal puns (“Ding dong 
merrily on pie!”) as Mel and Sue turn the tweeness up to 11 for a final time. 
The competitive element involves old contenders from across Bake Off’s seven 
series creating Christmas bakes but that’s beside the point. Instead, this is 
most cheerful valedictory imaginable. Concludes tomorrow.Phil Harrison

Call the Midwife
 8pm, BBC1

After the Doctor’s call earlier, it’s time for the baby wranglers, as BBC1’s 
Christmas schedule runs along familiar lines. Following some token snowfall and 
a turkey lunch in Poplar, the staff of Nonnatus House head to South Africa, 
where a rural mission hospital faces closure. Heartwarming stuff? Of course, 
but a combination of Sinéad Cusack’s turn as a grumpy doctor, a surgical 
intervention and apartheid-era injustice stop things getting too slushy.

Travel Man: 48 Hours in Florence
8pm, Channel 4

Richard Ayoade’s Christmas special finds him in magnificent Florence alongside 
Rebel Wilson, off the films. They quickly come clean to filming in October, so 
you’ll just have to use your imagination for the festive bits. The pair raft on 
the Arno, trek to the top of the Duomo, and Richard tries out the local 
delicacy, tripe in a bap. You’d think together they would be a riot, but sadly 
there’s a palpable lack of chuckles throughout.Ben Arnold

Maigret’s Dead Man
 9pm, ITV 

There’s scant scope for festive cheer in 1950s France, as a series of sadistic 
murders at farms around Picardy horrify the nation. The Paris Brigade 
Criminelle offers to host the investigation, but Maigret, LaPointe and Janvier 
are more concerned with the mystery spiralling from a brutal gangland killing: 
could the cases be connected? Rowan Atkinson returns as the titular 
commissaire, his assured performance underpinning a drama that is darker than 
mere noir.Mark Gibbings-Jones

The Last Dragonslayer
5.45pm, Sky1

Set in a magic-tinged and heavily feudal Britain, this feature-length family 
adventure – based on Jasper Fforde’s mildly subversive fantasy novels – harks 
back to Sky’s handsome, star-stuffed Discworld adaptations. The saga swirls 
around Jennifer Strange (Ellise Chappell), a forthright teen foundling coerced 
into a slaying apprenticeship, while the supporting cast includes Ricky 
Tomlinson, Pauline Collins and a regal Matt Berry.Graeme Virtue

Wildest Islands of Indonesia
7pm, Animal Planet

Most of Indonesia’s 17,000-odd islands are uninhabited by humans, leaving a 
colossal number of what are effectively pristine and rarely bothered wildlife 
reserves. This series can therefore barely help being fascinating, and never 
more so than in this episode, titled Dragon’s Domain. It focuses on Indonesia’s 
impressive menagerie of lizards, including the splendid prehistoric throwback 
that is the Komodo dragon.Andrew Mueller

 Irresistible … Capra’s Christmas classic It’s a Wonderful Life. Photograph: 
Ronald Grant Archive 
It’s a Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, 1946) 2.20pm, Channel 4
Capra’s irresistible Christmas anthem – or carol – to the everyday decencies 
of small-town life stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a businessman about to 
end it all but saved by Clarence the angel (Henry Travers), who sends him back 
to his family a wiser man. Not entirely happy, though, as beneath the festive 
sentimentality Bailey is sacrificing his dream of freedom for the greater good.

Despicable Me 2 (Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, 2013) 9.55am, ITV
There’s a new bad guy on the loose in this enjoyable sequel. Gru is drawn out 
of retirement by the Anti-Villain League’s hot agent (Kristen Wiig) to help 
catch him. Gru’s relationship with his kids is a little sickly but there are 
plenty of big laughs here, often from Gru’s bug-eyed, yellow minions, when they 
are enticed over to the dark side.PH

The Artist (Michel Hazanavicius, 2011) 2.25pm, BBC2
A true original, this silent, black-and-white movie is a fond French account 
of the arrival of the talkies in late 20s Hollywood. It was awarded five 
Oscars, including best actor for Jean Dujardin’s matinee idol George Valentin, 
whose career nosedives while the fortunes of his sweetheart (Bérénice Bejo) 
take off. Funny, tender and charming – as is George’s scene-stealing Jack 
Russell, Uggy.PH

Frozen (Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee, 2013) 3.10pm, BBC1
Disney’s musical reboot of The Snow Queen is the highest-grossing animated 
film to date. It’s a tale of the sisterly rivalry between princesses Elsa and 
Anna (voiced by Idina Menzel and Kristin Bell), which plunges their land into 
deep freeze. With its Oscar-winning song Let It Go, it’s a captivating 
fairytale that exerts a charm well beyond its little-girl target audience.PH

The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (John Madden, 2011) 6.35pm, Film4
Madden’s twinkly comedy takes an A-list of Brit thesps – Maggie Smith, Judi 
Dench, Bill Nighy – and plonks them in a crumbling hotel in Rajasthan, as 
economic migrants seeking cheaper retirement. The contrived antics don’t do the 
illustrious cast justice, but it was charming enough to bag a sequel.PH

Thor (Kenneth Branagh, 2011) 9pm, Film4
One of the later Marvel superheroes, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the 
hammer-wielding Norse god of thunder, who is banished from celestial Asgard to 
duck and dive on Midgard, AKA Earth. But both he and Anthony Hopkins’s 
curmudgeonly Odin are upstaged by the arrival of the mighty Tom Hiddleston as 
Thor’s scheming brother, Loki.PH

 Jolly Christmas schmaltz ... Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon in seasonal 
favourite Love Actually. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REX/Rex Features 
Love Actually (Richard Curtis, 2003) 11pm, ITV
A large serving of (quite jolly) Christmas schmaltz: Curtis ambitiously 
shuffles eight seasonal love stories and a cast list as long as Santa’s 
delivery schedule. The starriest has PM Hugh Grant sweetly smitten by tea-lady 
Martine McCutcheon; best is Bill Nighy’s has-been rock star resurrecting his 
career with a catchy festive single and getting all soppy with his put-upon 
manager (Gregor Fisher).PH

Dallas Buyers Club (Jean-Marc Vallée, 2013) 10.30pm, Channel 5
Matthew McConaughey is barnstorming as Texas rodeo man Ron Woodroof in this 
true-life drama about a guy outwitting the US government and the FDA. He’s a 
homophobic redneck who is furious to find he has Aids. When the prescribed AZT 
proves useless, he sources unlicensed drugs from abroad and, spotting a 
business opportunity, sells to the gay guys he used to hate. It’s uplifting 
with a mercenary edge.PH

The Wicker Man (Robin Hardy, 1973) 10.55pm, Horror Channel
Staunch Christian policeman Edward Woodward journeys to a remote Scottish 
island to find a missing girl, but uncovers ancient pagan rites – and wild 
women Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt. Anthony Shaffer’s 
intelligent screenplay slowly builds sinister, erotic tension: as the deluded 
Woodward’s suspicions grow, the tone changes from mildly comic to horrific.PH

The Sting (George Roy Hill, 1973) 11pm, ITV3
This lavish, lighthearted caper reunites the director of Butch Cassidy with 
its stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. This time they are conmen in 30s 
Chicago, executing one last, glorious sting on vicious racketeer Robert Shaw. 
Scott Joplin’s ragtime piano gives a period feel and the whole is performed as 
skilfully as the sting itself.PH
