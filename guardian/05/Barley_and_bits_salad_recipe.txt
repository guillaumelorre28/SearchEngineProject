The joy of this is that it's a proper veg-box odds-and-ends clear-out. You'll 
need a few fresh herbs around too. Wilting parsley, dodgy dill – it doesn't 
matter, this dish will use whatever you have.

Serves 3-4

100g pearl barley (or spelt)
500ml vegetable or light chicken stock (make it half strength if you're using 
a cube)
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped with salt to make a paste
Salt and pepper
400g any quick-cook (as opposed to root) veg you have around – courgettes, 
fennel, asparagus tips, cabbage, cucumber – all cut into 1cm pieces. Mangetout 
and sugar snaps can be kept whole
Juice of 1 lemon
50ml extra virgin olive oil
25g soft herbs – such as parsley, basil, mint – finely chopped

1. Bring the barley and cold stock to the boil, then simmer gently for about 
half an hour. When you can see the barley through the liquid, put a lid on it 
and turn the heat right down until the barley is cooked. If there is still some 
liquid left, boil it hard for a few minutes until it's all gone. Take care not 
to let it stick to the bottom.

2. Once it's cooked, stir in half the garlic, season well and spread out on 
a plate to cool.

3. Rinse the pan, fill it with salted water and bring to the boil. Drop all 
your vegetables into it, stick a lid on and prepare a bowl of very cold water.

4. As soon as the veg pan comes back to the boil (2 to 3 minutes), strain and 
tip the blanched vegetables into the cold water (this keeps them green and 
stops them cooking, which is essential for this super-fresh and crunchy packed 
lunch). Once the veg are cool to the touch, drain the water.

5. For the dressing, take the juice of half a lemon, whisk in the olive oil 
and remaining garlic and finish with the chopped herbs.

6. In a big bowl, mix together the barley and veg bits with the dressing and 
some seasoning. Taste and add more lemon if necessary.
