Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

We are planning our wedding and it’s got to be one thing – good value. If you 
were doing it again what would you ditch, and what were the things you were 
glad you had? Do we really need bridesmaids?
