The film is a return to form for Portman, who has struggled in recent years 
with the poorly received western Jane Got a Gun and middling reviews for her 
directorial debut, A Tale of Love and Darkness. The actor’s forthcoming slate 
includes Alex Garland’s sci-fi thriller Annihilation and Xavier Dolan’s starry 
drama The Death and Life of John F Donovan.

Portman joins Emma Stone in the race for best actress, with her role in 
musical La La Land also gaining buzz at Venice.
