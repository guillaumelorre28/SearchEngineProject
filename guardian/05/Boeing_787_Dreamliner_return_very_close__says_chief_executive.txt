The chief executive of Boeing <https://www.theguardian.com/business/boeing> 
has said the company was very close to getting its troubled 787 Dreamliner jet 
back into the skies.

The world's most advanced passenger plane has been grounded since January 
after battery fires on two of its jets. This week Boeing announced that it had
completed the first successful test flights

 after making changes to its lithium-ion battery systems.

"We have a high degree of confidence in the technical solution we are testing 
right now with the Federal Aviation Administration," said Jim McNerney. "I 
think it will be sooner than later."

He expected the tests to conclude in a few days and said the data should be 
conclusive enough to persuade regulators to let the plane fly again.

He called the grounding a "frustrating experience" but said regulators were 
putting safety first. "They have the best interest of the flying public in 
mind," McNerney said.

Boeing is believed to be testing a new casing for the batteries and a venting 
system to disperse potentially flammable gases. The Dreamliner has been built 
with a radical carbon-fibre structure designed to make the plane as light as 
possible, generating savings on fuel that have made the jet an attractive 
proposition to customers such as Thomson Airways in the UK.

The first serious incident to affect the plane saw a 787 battery burst into 
flames on 7 January while it was parked at Logan airport in Boston.

The second incident took place on 16 January when a battery triggered a smoke 
alarm while in flight in Japan.

Investigators in Tokyo and the US have yet to identify a definitive cause of 
the fires, although the NationalTransport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> Safety Board has singled out short 
circuits across the battery's eight cells as a possible cause.
