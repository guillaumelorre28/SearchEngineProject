Summary: Stress tests, and the end of the 'post-crisis period'
 Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/AFP/Getty Images 
OK, time to wrap up.

Britain’s biggest lenders have passed the second major stress tests imposed on 
the sector since the financial crisis

.

HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and Nationwide all breezed through - but 
Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered only got a tick due to action 
already taken to boost their capital reserves.RBS admitted that it must to more 
to become a ‘strong and resilient’ bank

.

The Bank of England has declared that the “post-crisis period is over” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d8b1ae4b0fac6a95dd387>
. It also promised that it is not planning a further wave of capital 
requirements on the banks.

Buy-to-let landlords may be concerned to hear that the BoE is monitoring the 
sector closely.

 The central bank isconcerned

 that BTL borrowers could be in the firing line when interest rates rise, or 
house prices fall.

The BoE is also considering imposing a higher counter-cyclical buffer on banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d5e7ce4b037ebb2b000a8>
. That would make them hold onto more capital, reining in risky lending and 
giving them more protection for a downturn. Governor Mark Carney has hinted 
that this would allow the Bank to leave interest rates at record lows for 
longer.

Bank shares have rallied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d7ca9e4b037ebb2b000f7>
, as traders showed relief that no-one actually failed the test.

Our financial editor Nils Pratley is concerned that the BoE may letting the 
banks off too easily:

 In the aftermath of the 2007-09 crisis, regulators seemed determined to set 
banks’ capital thresholds far higher than is now deemed acceptable. The UK’s 
Vickers commission and the international Basel committee spoke of core equity 
ratios of 18%. In the event, the Bank has settled on 11%.

Mark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney>, to be fair, 
gave a full explanation. First, capital is better designed these days – 
bondholders in the biggest banks can be forced to take pain in a crisis, for 
example. Second, “forward-looking” regulators are making better judgments on 
risks. Third, countercyclical buffers can be flexed up and down as conditions 
require.

The arguments all sound plausible, but 18% to 11% is a mighty leap downwards. 
Perhaps it was necessary to avoid “the stability of the graveyard”, meaning 
banks so over-capitalised that they take too few risks. But perhaps more 
alarmingly, today’s central bankers just have complete faith in their ability 
to spot dangers.

The rallying bank shares mean London’s stock market is beginning December on 
the front foot.

With Barclays jumping 4%, RBS gaining 3% and Lloyds up 2.5%, the wider FTSE 
100 has risen by 37 points to 6394. That would be a three week high (if the 
market closed now).

It could be the start of the traditional ‘Santa rally’, as my colleague Sean 
Farrell explains:

Investors could bag themselves a better Christmas present than socks or an 
Adele CD by putting money into the stock market at the start of December, if 
history is a guide.

The so-called Santa rally, in which shares do well at the end of the year, is 
backed up by a surprising amount of evidence but there is less agreement on the 
cause of the trend.

Research by the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown shows that December has been 
the best month for the stock market in the last 30 years. British shares have 
risen in December almost nine times in 10 in that time and the average December 
return was almost three times that for all months of the year...

Mark Carney’s broad message today is that Britain’s financial sector is 
finally leaving its ‘post crisis period’.

That’s the long era of reconstruction which began once the dust settled after 
the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has seen new rules to regulate the City, new 
bosses at our major banks, and billions of pounds of fines and compensation.

The Financial Times has a good take: 

The Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> has declared that 
the UK’s financial system has moved out of the “post-crisis period” but was not 
showing enough signs of overheating to require action to rein in credit.

Officials at the Bank clarified that in future they would seek to use 
regulation to strengthen lenders in good times rather than tame the credit 
cycle.

The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee said on Tuesday it “intends to make 
active use of the time-varying countercyclical capital buffer” — the capital 
banks must build up in good times to ensure they can operate their core banking 
functions in the event of a shock. But it declined to raise that buffer 
immediately from 0 per cent and said any increase, expected in March, would not 
raise overall capital requirements for the UK banking system.

“There is no Basel IV,” said Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney>, BoE governor, referring to 
concerns over a new and tighter round of global banking regulations. “Our 
objective has never been to raise capital without limit or raise it by stealth.”

Steven Hall, banking partner at KPMG, has ploughed through today’s stress test 
results (which are online here 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/Documents/fpc/results011215.pdf>
) and found a problem.

Although the banks had enough decent-quality capital to handle the 2014 test 
(based on a UK downturn) and also to pass this year’s exam (which included more 
international risks), they would struggle to pass a combination of both 
scenarios.

And that’s what the 2016 test will do.

Hall says:

“Another stress test and another festive celebration as all the banks pass. 
However the overall severity of the stress impact on CET1 capital levels is 
higher this year compared with last year.

The good news for UK banks is that by combining today’s stress impacts with 
the additional capital accretion and asset reductions they have completed in 
2015 would mean all 7 banks would pass the tougher stress test hurdle that the 
PRA will apply from next year. We calculate that in aggregate the sector has a 
buffer of £115bn of capital as of Q3 2015.

The bad news is that if one combined this year’s scenario (trading and conduct 
related) with last year’s UK domestic property-related shock, we estimate that 
the aggregate CET1 capital ratio would not meet the proposed 2016’s combined 
hurdle with an estimated £23 billion shortfall in CET1 capital.

Barclays has now climbed to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board, up over 4% 
today.

The City is welcoming today’s stress test results, and Mark Carney’s 
insistence that regulators won’t impose much tougher capital requirements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d6331e4b0cf03a4624662>
.

Mike Van Dulkan of Accendo Markets says Barclays has done better this year 
than in the 2014 tests:

UK banks shares are in celebratory mood this morning in the wake of the latest 
round of BoE stress tests. This comes from suggestions that the central bank is 
set to ease capital pressures on the sector after years of post-crisis reform 
in contrast to expectations of stiffer hurdles next year.

Barclays (BARC), however, is outperforming on account of its bigger exposure 
to riskier investment banking activities, an area it had been scaling back due 
to excessive pre-crisis risk-taking that led it into trouble, as well it last 
year having the lowest levels of capital for this year’s new leverage ratio 
test.

While all passed, peers RBS and Standard Chartered only did so thanks to 
bolster buffers and ensure targets are hit.

Both RBS and Lloyds were close to the mark last year, but Lloyds turnaround 
efforts have served it while RBS still clearly has much work to do. <end>

It’s good news for new CEO Jes Staley on his first day at Barclays. He had 
lost 300 grand on shares purchased since his appointment....

 David Parker, Head of UK & Ireland Banking at Accenture, says the Bank of 
England is right to be concerned about cybercrime risks (as Jon Cunliffe hinted 
earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d61a6e4b037ebb2b000ae>
).

Parker says:

Interestingly, the Systemic Risk Survey [online here 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/other/srs/default.aspx>] 
published today sees a significant increase in those who now believe a 
cyber-attack poses a risk to the UK financial system. As banks look to offer 
new services to their customers in an increasingly competitive field, they 
create the potential for new vulnerabilities in their systems.

Financial institutions need to focus on both operational and technical ways to 
counter this threat. These range from changing the way they think about risk to 
investing in cutting edge cyber security systems.

Some unexpected good news from the eurozone just landed.

The eurozone unemployment rate has dropped to 10.7%, lower than expected, and 
the best reading since December 2011:

Oct 2015 euro area unemployment rate 10.7% (Sept 10.8%), EU 9.3% (Sept 9.3%)

Today’s stress test result 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d4588e4b0cf03a4624649>
s should give Britain’s banks more confidence to boost their lending.

So argues James Belmont, director of risk and compliance at management 
consultants Baringa Partners:


The news that five of the seven banks passed the 2015 stress test, and the 
remaining two, RBS and StandardChartered, have taken appropriate steps to 
strengthen their balance sheets and will not be required to raise additional 
capital, will be given a guarded welcomed across financial markets.

It should give banks greater confidence to expand their credit to the real 
economy, helping fuel job creation and long-term investment.

Belmont also reminds us why some banks did worse than others:

The extended stress scenario, which included Chinese growth slowing 
“materially” and lower oil prices, had a greater impact on banks with 
significant retail and corporate presence in Asia and emerging markets, such as 
HSBC and Standard Chartered, and universal banks with material trade risk 
exposures to these markets, such as HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered and RBS.

OK, time to wrap up.

Britain’s biggest lenders have passed the second major stress tests imposed on 
the sector since the financial crisis

.

HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and Nationwide all breezed through - but 
Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered only got a tick due to action 
already taken to boost their capital reserves.RBS admitted that it must to more 
to become a ‘strong and resilient’ bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d4fcde4b0cf03a462464e>
.

The Bank of England has declared that the “post-crisis period is over” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d8b1ae4b0fac6a95dd387>
. It also promised that it is not planning a further wave of capital 
requirements on the banks.

Buy-to-let landlords may be concerned to hear that the BoE is monitoring the 
sector closely.

 that BTL borrowers could be in the firing line when interest rates rise, or 
house prices fall.

The BoE is also considering imposing a higher counter-cyclical buffer on banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d5e7ce4b037ebb2b000a8>
. That would make them hold onto more capital, reining in risky lending and 
giving them more protection for a downturn. Governor Mark Carney has hinted 
that this would allow the Bank to leave interest rates at record lows for 
longer.

Bank shares have rallied

, as traders showed relief that no-one actually failed the test.

And that’s all for today. Cheers. GW
 
Our financial editor Nils Pratley is concerned that the BoE may letting the 
banks off too easily:

 In the aftermath of the 2007-09 crisis, regulators seemed determined to set 
banks’ capital thresholds far higher than is now deemed acceptable. The UK’s 
Vickers commission and the international Basel committee spoke of core equity 
ratios of 18%. In the event, the Bank has settled on 11%.

Mark Carney <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney>, to be fair, 
gave a full explanation. First, capital is better designed these days – 
bondholders in the biggest banks can be forced to take pain in a crisis, for 
example. Second, “forward-looking” regulators are making better judgments on 
risks. Third, countercyclical buffers can be flexed up and down as conditions 
require.

The arguments all sound plausible, but 18% to 11% is a mighty leap downwards. 
Perhaps it was necessary to avoid “the stability of the graveyard”, meaning 
banks so over-capitalised that they take too few risks. But perhaps more 
alarmingly, today’s central bankers just have complete faith in their ability 
to spot dangers.

The rallying bank shares mean London’s stock market is beginning December on 
the front foot.

With Barclays jumping 4%, RBS gaining 3% and Lloyds up 2.5%, the wider FTSE 
100 has risen by 37 points to 6394. That would be a three week high (if the 
market closed now).

It could be the start of the traditional ‘Santa rally’, as my colleague Sean 
Farrell explains:

Investors could bag themselves a better Christmas present than socks or an 
Adele CD by putting money into the stock market at the start of December, if 
history is a guide.

The so-called Santa rally, in which shares do well at the end of the year, is 
backed up by a surprising amount of evidence but there is less agreement on the 
cause of the trend.

Research by the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown shows that December has been 
the best month for the stock market in the last 30 years. British shares have 
risen in December almost nine times in 10 in that time and the average December 
return was almost three times that for all months of the year...

Mark Carney’s broad message today is that Britain’s financial sector is 
finally leaving its ‘post crisis period’.

That’s the long era of reconstruction which began once the dust settled after 
the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has seen new rules to regulate the City, new 
bosses at our major banks, and billions of pounds of fines and compensation.

The Financial Times has a good take: 

The Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> has declared that 
the UK’s financial system has moved out of the “post-crisis period” but was not 
showing enough signs of overheating to require action to rein in credit.

Officials at the Bank clarified that in future they would seek to use 
regulation to strengthen lenders in good times rather than tame the credit 
cycle.

The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee said on Tuesday it “intends to make 
active use of the time-varying countercyclical capital buffer” — the capital 
banks must build up in good times to ensure they can operate their core banking 
functions in the event of a shock. But it declined to raise that buffer 
immediately from 0 per cent and said any increase, expected in March, would not 
raise overall capital requirements for the UK banking system.

“There is no Basel IV,” said Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney>, BoE governor, referring to 
concerns over a new and tighter round of global banking regulations. “Our 
objective has never been to raise capital without limit or raise it by stealth.”

Steven Hall, banking partner at KPMG, has ploughed through today’s stress test 
results (which are online here 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/Documents/fpc/results011215.pdf>
) and found a problem.

Although the banks had enough decent-quality capital to handle the 2014 test 
(based on a UK downturn) and also to pass this year’s exam (which included more 
international risks), they would struggle to pass a combination of both 
scenarios.

And that’s what the 2016 test will do.

Hall says:

“Another stress test and another festive celebration as all the banks pass. 
However the overall severity of the stress impact on CET1 capital levels is 
higher this year compared with last year.

The good news for UK banks is that by combining today’s stress impacts with 
the additional capital accretion and asset reductions they have completed in 
2015 would mean all 7 banks would pass the tougher stress test hurdle that the 
PRA will apply from next year. We calculate that in aggregate the sector has a 
buffer of £115bn of capital as of Q3 2015.

The bad news is that if one combined this year’s scenario (trading and conduct 
related) with last year’s UK domestic property-related shock, we estimate that 
the aggregate CET1 capital ratio would not meet the proposed 2016’s combined 
hurdle with an estimated £23 billion shortfall in CET1 capital.
 
Barclays has now climbed to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board, up over 4% 
today.

The City is welcoming today’s stress test results, and Mark Carney’s 
insistence that regulators won’t impose much tougher capital requirements

.

Mike Van Dulkan of Accendo Markets says Barclays has done better this year 
than in the 2014 tests:

UK banks shares are in celebratory mood this morning in the wake of the latest 
round of BoE stress tests. This comes from suggestions that the central bank is 
set to ease capital pressures on the sector after years of post-crisis reform 
in contrast to expectations of stiffer hurdles next year.

Barclays (BARC), however, is outperforming on account of its bigger exposure 
to riskier investment banking activities, an area it had been scaling back due 
to excessive pre-crisis risk-taking that led it into trouble, as well it last 
year having the lowest levels of capital for this year’s new leverage ratio 
test.

While all passed, peers RBS and Standard Chartered only did so thanks to 
bolster buffers and ensure targets are hit.

Both RBS and Lloyds were close to the mark last year, but Lloyds turnaround 
efforts have served it while RBS still clearly has much work to do. <end>

It’s good news for new CEO Jes Staley on his first day at Barclays. He had 
lost 300 grand on shares purchased since his appointment....

 David Parker, Head of UK & Ireland Banking at Accenture, says the Bank of 
England is right to be concerned about cybercrime risks (as Jon Cunliffe hinted 
earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d61a6e4b037ebb2b000ae>
).

Parker says:

Interestingly, the Systemic Risk Survey [online here 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/other/srs/default.aspx>] 
published today sees a significant increase in those who now believe a 
cyber-attack poses a risk to the UK financial system. As banks look to offer 
new services to their customers in an increasingly competitive field, they 
create the potential for new vulnerabilities in their systems.

Financial institutions need to focus on both operational and technical ways to 
counter this threat. These range from changing the way they think about risk to 
investing in cutting edge cyber security systems.

 
Every silver lining has a cloud, though:

Some unexpected good news from the eurozone just landed.

The eurozone unemployment rate has dropped to 10.7%, lower than expected, and 
the best reading since December 2011:

Today’s stress test result 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/01/bank-of-england-stress-tests-and-financial-stability-report-live#block-565d4588e4b0cf03a4624649>
s should give Britain’s banks more confidence to boost their lending.

So argues James Belmont, director of risk and compliance at management 
consultants Baringa Partners:


The news that five of the seven banks passed the 2015 stress test, and the 
remaining two, RBS and StandardChartered, have taken appropriate steps to 
strengthen their balance sheets and will not be required to raise additional 
capital, will be given a guarded welcomed across financial markets.

It should give banks greater confidence to expand their credit to the real 
economy, helping fuel job creation and long-term investment.

Belmont also reminds us why some banks did worse than others:

The extended stress scenario, which included Chinese growth slowing 
“materially” and lower oil prices, had a greater impact on banks with 
significant retail and corporate presence in Asia and emerging markets, such as 
HSBC and Standard Chartered, and universal banks with material trade risk 
exposures to these markets, such as HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered and RBS.
