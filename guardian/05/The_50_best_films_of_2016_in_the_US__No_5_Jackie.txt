Perhaps the only good thing to come out of Hollywood’s increasing trend toward 
end-of-year prestige biopics is a rise in film-makers who are equally tired 
with the musty format and keen to craft something unconventional instead.

Last year’s vastly underrated Joy succeeded by embracing dreamlike whimsy over

similarly replaces dry predictability with thrilling experimentation.

The Chilean film-maker, whose strange, semi-fabricated take on the poet and 
senator Pablo Nerudaimpressed at this year’s Cannes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/neruda-review-unconventional-drama-constructs-rather-than-retells-chilean-poets-life>
, focuses on a familiar figure during a familiar time: before and after the 
assassination of John F Kennedy. The result is a time-hopping but focused study 
of grief, given a strange and welcome jolt.

The score, by Under the Skin composer Mica Levi, is unusual and spellbinding, 
and the lush cinematography by frequent Jacques Audiard collaborator Stéphane 
Fontaine is evocative of the era. Portman’s performance, meanwhile, is far 
deeper and more incisive than mere impersonation. The violence is gruesome and 
marital revelations are uncomfortably candid, and we’re left with a portrait of 
fractured, flawed subject, that’s at odds with the airbrushed retellings we’re 
used to.

Unsettling and moving, Jackie’s sad look at a promising presidency curtailed 
cuts even deeper today as dreams of change and progress in America give way to 
an ominous fear of the future.
