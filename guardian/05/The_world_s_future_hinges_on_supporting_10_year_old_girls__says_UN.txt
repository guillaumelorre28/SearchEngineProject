Ten-year-old Daline enjoys reading, dancing and using her mother’s make up. 
And she loves school. Her favourite subject is chemistry.

“When I was at primary school, my favourite subject was history,” she says. 
“But now that I am at secondary school, my new favourite subject is chemistry 
because it is easy to understand, because chemicals are easy to make, and 
because I love science.”


Daline, who will turn 11 next month, lives with her parents and two younger 
brothers in Cameroon’s capital, Yaoundé.

She does some housework – “I wash plates, clean the floor and the compound, 
and sometimes I cook food” – but so does her brother, who “helps me to sweep 
the floor”. She definitely prefers going to school to staying at home.

But on the cusp of adolescence, the support received by Daline – and the 65 
million other 10-year-old girls around the world – over the coming years will 
have a huge bearing not only on her life, but also on the future of her country 
and the global economy.

According to the UN population fund’s (UNFPA) state of the world population 
2016 report <http://www.unfpa.org/swop>, published on Thursday, the future of 
10-year-old girls will shape our collective futures. Getting girls through 
secondary school could reap billions of dollars a year for poorer countries, 
claims the study.

But the hurdles girls face in reaching adulthood are significant.

International Day of the Girl: how inequality starts before birth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2016/oct/11/a-girls-life-how-inequality-starts-before-birth-video-international-day-of-the-girl>
Globally, twice as many girls as boys will never start school

. Girls are also more likely to bemarried young 
<https://data.unicef.org/resources/ending-child-marriage-progress-and-prospects/>
 than boys. And millions of girls areat risk of FGM 
<http://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/female-genital-mutilation-and-cutting/>
.

The report found that 10% of five- to 14-year-old girls do more than 28 hours 
of household chores a week, twice that of boys. The authors said that more than 
half of the world’s 10-year-old girls live in the 48 countries with the worst 
gender inequality records.

What the world looks like in 2030 depends on doing everything we can to ignite 
the potential of 10-year-old girls today

Each year of education delivers an additional 11.7% increase in wages in later 
life for girls (compared with 9.6% for men), added the study, which calculated 
that if all the 10-year-old girls in poorer countries completed secondary 
education, a $21bn (£17bn) annual dividend would be triggered. In some 
countries this could translate to individual earnings increasing by half by 
2030.

Governments, NGOs and multilateral organisations must make investments in 
girls an urgent priority, said the report’s authors, who also urged the 
dismantling of social systems that confine women to the home and called for a 
commitment to “increasing the presence, visibility and agency of women and 
girls in the public spheres of school and work”.

The study said the life trajectory of a 10-year-old girl would be the ultimate 
test of the success or failure of the17 sustainable development goals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive>
, adopted by the UN general assembly last year. The goals promise to eliminate 
extreme poverty, get all children through primary and secondary school, end all 
discrimination against all girls and women and eliminate harmful practices, 
such as FGM and child marriage.

“This cohort of 10-year-olds … represents both a challenge and an opportunity 
for the global community, and will have a significant role to play in what the 
future represents,” said the authors.

“The ability of institutions, both local and global, to help prepare 
10-year-olds for their transition through adolescence to adulthood, 
particularly in terms of safeguarding their emotional and cognitive 
development, health and rights, will shape the degree to which this generation 
is able to maximise its potential and become drivers of positive change at the 
local and global levels.”

The UNFPA’s executive director, Babatunde Osotimehin, said impeding a girl’s 
safe, healthy path through adolescence to a productive and autonomous adulthood 
was a “violation of her rights”.

“What the world will look like in 15 years will depend on our doing everything 
in our power to ignite the potential of a 10-year-old girl today. But it also 
takes a toll on her community and nation. Whenever a girl’s potential goes 
unrealised, we all lose,” he said.

“How we invest in and support 10-year-old girls today will determine what our 
world will look like in 2030. With support from family, community and nation, 
and the full realisation of her rights, a 10-year-old girl can thrive and help 
bring about the future we all want.”

Daline has just started secondary school. She has yet to decide what job she 
wants to do when she’s older, but she is certain of the world in which she 
wants to live.

“I want to work in a society where I may help children who are abandoned or 
maltreated or homeless, so that they will no longer be alone.”
