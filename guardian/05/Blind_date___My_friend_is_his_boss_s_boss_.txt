Susan on Phil 





What were you hoping for?
A good night out with lovely food and interesting conversation.

First impressions?
Easy on the eye and wearing a nicely ironed shirt.

What did you talk about?
Football season tickets, the weight of his son’s hair dryer and an unfortunate 
incident with his ex-girlfriend’s cat.

Any awkward moments?
When we realised my friend is his boss’s boss.

Good table manners?
He offered (and I accepted) a spoonful of his tiramisu.

Best thing about Phil?
He’s open and easy to talk to.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
Manchester is such a small place. He probably already knows half of them.

Describe him in three words
A nice man.

What do you think he made of you?
Old. And obsessed with the fact that we should write complimentary things 
about each other.

Did you go on somewhere?
Yes. It was Saturday night, so we went for a beer.

And... did you kiss?
A polite, awkward kiss on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
It wouldn’t have been a Saturday. I had to turn down a ticket to a Morrissey 
gig.

Marks out of 10?
9.

Would you meet again?
We didn’t exchange numbers.

To a bar – she detoured to check that a cat she was looking after was still 
alive.

A peck on the cheek.

I’d have asked for ice-cream with the tiramisu.
