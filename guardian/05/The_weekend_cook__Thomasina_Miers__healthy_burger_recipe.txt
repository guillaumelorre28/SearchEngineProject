The hamburger is the poster boy for today’s fast-food culture but, with its 
high fat content and often dubious ingredient list, no wonder it’s usually 
painted as unhealthy. That said, hamburgers arevery fast to prep: if you’re in 
a hurry and want a treat, you can reach for a packet of mince and make burgers 
from conception to plate in less than 20 minutes. And if you buy your mince 
from a good source, you can be sure the meat is top quality and, hopefully, 
antibiotic-free, too. If you go light on the size of the burgers and the buns, 
as with todays’s deliciously minty lamb burgers, bulk up instead with a lovely 
summer salad.

For pudding, a honeyed sponge cake that makes the most of apricots, which are 
bang in season right now. This year has been a particularly good one for 
apricots (they are juicy, fragrant and plump) so we may as well make the most 
of them while we can.

Lamb burgers with minty new potato, feta and pea salad

This sharp, bright salad is the ideal foil for the juicy, minty burgers. 
Serves six.

½ large onion, peeled
1 handful mint leaves, washed 
500g lamb mince
¼ tsp sea salt
Olive oil, for frying
For the salad
500g baby new potatoes
225g fresh peas or frozen 
1 round lettuce, washed
200g feta

For the dressing
1 handful mint, leaves picked and finely chopped
2 tbsp red-wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
80ml extra-virgin olive oil
A squeeze of lemon juice

Blitz the onion and mint in a food processor until very finely chopped, then 
mix into the mince, season with salt, and shape into six patties.

Cook the potatoes for 15 minutes in salted boiling water; steam the peas on 
top of the spuds for the last two to four minutes, depending on whether they’re 
fresh or frozen. Drain both and leave to cool.

Heat a splash of olive oil in a wide frying pan. Lay in the burgers, in 
batches if need be, and flatten them a little in the pan with the back of a 
fish slice. Fry the burgers for five minutes on each side until golden.

Meanwhile, whisk the mint leaves with the vinegar and sugar until the sugar 
dissolves, then whisk in the oil and lemon juice, and season. Tear the lettuce 
straight into a large bowl, add the potatoes, peas and feta, then pour on the 
dressing and toss. Serve alongside the burgers.

Buttermilk and honey cake with honeyed apricots

Light buttermilk goes so well with the sweet, floral notes of the apricot, 
vanilla and cream filling, making an excellent, fluffy sponge that’s perfect 
for afternoon tea. Serves eight to 10.

175g unsalted butter, at room temperature
220g caster sugar
4 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
420g white spelt flour, plus extra for dusting
2 tsp baking powder
220ml buttermilk
1 tbsp honey

For the filling
10 apricots, halved and stoned
6 tbsp good-quality honey
1½ tbsp elderflower cordial
2 tbsp muscat (optional)
Zest of 1 lemon
300ml double cream (or Greek yoghurt)
Seeds from 1 vanilla pod
Icing sugar, to dust

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed, 
spring-form cake tin and line the base with a circle of greased baking paper. 
Dust the sides lightly with flour and shake off any excess.

Beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, and the sugar has almost 
dissolved (use a stand mixer or hand-held beater). Briefly beat in the eggs one 
by one, adding a pinch of flour if the mix looks as if it might curdle, then 
stir in the vanilla extract. Sift the flour and baking powder, fold into the 
batter until combined, then beat in the buttermilk and honey.

Pour the cake mix into the prepared tin and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until 
it’s risen and golden and a skewer comes out cleanly. Remove and leave to sit 
in the tin for five minutes, then turn out on to a cooling rack lined with 
greaseproof paper or kitchen towel.

While the cake is baking, lay the apricots cut side down in a large pan and 
drizzle over two-thirds of the honey, the cordial, muscat (if using) and lemon 
zest. Cook on a medium heat until the fruit softens and is beginning to break 
up. Gently stir in the last two tablespoons of honey, and leave to cool 
completely.

When the cake and apricots have cooled, whip the cream to soft peaks with the 
vanilla seeds (if you want to make the cake lighter, use thick Greek yoghurt 
instead of cream, or a half-and-half mix.)

Using a serrated knife or cake wire, cut the cake through the middle into two 
equal halves and brush off any excess crumbs with a pastry brush. Put the lower 
half of the cake on a serving plate or cake stand, spoon on the cream (or 
yoghurt) in big dollops, then smooth it down with the back of the spoon. 
Arrange the apricots over the cream, lay the second cake-half on top, dust with 
icing sugar and serve.

And for the rest of the week…

Consider buying double the quantity of lamb mince, either to make an emergency 
supper of burgers for the freezer, or for meatballs – they’re delicious with a 
coriander-spiced tomato sauce. If you can get fresh peas, buy lots and blitz 
any excess into a kind of pesto with fresh mint, a little feta, some toasted 
almonds, plenty of black pepper and olive oil. And definitely make extra 
honeyed apricots: they’re gorgeous with yoghurt for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
