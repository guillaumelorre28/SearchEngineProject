The idea for the birthday gigs was inspired by the series of tributes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/29/david-bowie-tribute-concert-pixies-blondie-live-streamed-skype>
 which took place in the wakeof Bowie’s death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69>
 – most notably the two shows in spring this year, in which more than 70 
artists and musicians in Los Angeles and San Francisco celebrated his career. 
The cast of those shows includedGary Oldman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/18/gary-oldman-five-best-moments>, 
Seal, Ewan McGregor, Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads, and Bowie band alumni 
from Space Oddity to the latest Blackstar album.

Titled Celebrating David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie>, 
the London strand of the event will happen in Brixton, Bowie’s birthplace, at 
the O2 Academy. Led by Oldman, who delivered a speech about his late friend at 
the Brit awards, the show is to feature former Bowie band members Mike Garson, 
Earl Slick, Adrian Belew, Sterling Campbell,Holly Palmer and Catherine Russell, 
along with ensembles from Los Angeles and New York and many other special 
guests yet to be announced.

Proceeds from the London show will go to the Children & the Arts 
<http://www.childrenandarts.org.uk/> charity. More details about the other 
shows will be announced “sporadically” in the run-up to the events.
