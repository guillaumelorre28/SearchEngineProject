Doctor Who <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who> fans will 
have to tune into the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday to find out the identity of 
the Time Lord’s new companion. The news will be revealed live on BBC1 at 
half-time during Everton’s match against Manchester United.

It was confirmed in September last year that Jenna Coleman would be departing 
as the Doctor’s companion

 during the show’s ninth series. Coleman bowed out after three years playing 
Clara Oswald, making her the longest-serving companion since the show’s 
relaunch in 2005. She replaced Karen Gillan, who played Amy Pond, to star 
alongside Matt Smith and later Peter Capaldi.

Fan theories about the identity of the new companion went into overdrive 
recently, following remarks made by Capaldi to a South American outlet. Among 
the people considered a favourite for Coleman’s replacement is EastEnders 
actress Rakhee Thakrar.

In January, Steven Moffat revealed that he was stepping down as the lead writer

 and executive producer of the show. He will be replaced by Broadchurch creator 
Chris Chibnall, who will start work as executive producer in 2018. Series 10 is 
to be Moffat’s last and will be broadcast next year.
