In the light of your book, Nation on the Take (How Big Money Corrupts Our 
Democracy and What We Can Do About It), what do you make of this current 
presidential election? Are there any surprises in terms of funding and 
expenditure of the candidates?
I think that the popularity of Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/05/sanders-hails-wisconsin-victory-in-campaign-by-the-people-for-the-people-video>
 has been very interesting and surprising. I think it shows that there is a lot 
of support for candidates who are not on the take, who do not seek big 
donations from corporate interests and billionaires. And I think even the rise 
of Donald Trump is interesting in that people are attracted to his campaign 
because he’s not taking money from special interests, corporations and other 
wealthy people. I think the common trend is that people are really fed up with 
the money-driven aspect of American politics. Whether you’re on the left or 
right, people want to see things change.

Sanders has pointed out that Hillary Clinton has taken money from Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/feb/04/democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-new-hampshire-msnbc-live-coverage>
. Has that had a serious political impact?
I definitely think voters have noticed that. I think it’s one reason why 
Bernie Sanders continues to be a contender and why Hillary Clinton hasn’t sewn 
the nomination up yet. I think there are a lot of Democrats who are concerned 
about money and politics; even though she says she’s not influenced by people 
who give her money, there is a concern that it would be a continuation of the 
same old same old. That said, on her campaign platform, she says she wants to 
reform the system and get big money out of American politics. To get elected, 
you have to play the game as it’s currently played. She may be right about 
that. She may well end up being the Democratic nominee, but I think there will 
be a lot of people who hold her to her word on reforming the political system.

What has been the biggest contribution to the corruption of the US political 
system?
The unrestricted growth of money in politics. The ability of a few 
billionaires, a few very wealthy families and individuals to inordinately 
influence elections and public policy. We’ve had similar times in our past when 
we’ve got to this point and we’ve had corrections. President Teddy Roosevelt, 
for example, was probably our country’s most vocal champion of campaign finance 
reform. He was able to rally public support and push forward reforms that were 
very important in bringing an end to the gilded age. What we have now is a 
second gilded age and it’s because some of the laws that were passed have been 
unravelled or amended.

Why do US election campaigns need to be so long? Could they be shortened?
I think it’s possible. That is absolutely something that we as a country 
should take up. I think there is probably the assumption by a lot of reformers 
that it’s an area we just can’t tackle at this point because the various states 
set their primaries early on so that they can have more influence on the 
outcome of campaigns. We should look at the elections in the UK and Canada.

Your book argues that it’s not just voters but politicians themselves who are 
fed up with their onerous fundraising duties with the rich and powerful. So why 
is so little done about it?
Politicians are fed up. They do not like having to leave their offices on 
Capitol Hill and go to another building where they can legally sit in a cubicle 
and dial for dollars for hours on end. But they don’t as yet see a movement 
[against this] that’s taking shape. We need a groundswell of support and also 
support from the elite in the country. It’s going to take a coalition of 
grassroots and grasstops advocacy.

How long will that process take?
I don’t see a reason why we can’t see significant change in five years from 
now. Legislation can be introduced and enacted in a very short period of time. 
Look at how rapidly things changed on the issue of marriage equality. We’re 
seeing things change much more rapidly partly because of the ability of people 
to communicate more effectively in the internet age.

The supreme court Citizens United decision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/21/citizens-united-supreme-court-ruling>
 was a controversial ruling. Can you explain its impact?
That ruling and others, which said that Super Pacs [independent groups that 
collect donations in support of candidates] can receive unlimited contributions 
from individuals and corporations and labour unions, opened the floodgates of 
money into politics. And these groups are unaccountable. They don’t have to 
disclose their donors. They have come to influence voters’ decisions and policy 
decisions in ways that didn’t exist previously. We now have little knowledge 
about who is trying to influence public policy and elections. That needs to be 
changed.

Republican backers the Koch brothers, you say, have forged a small network of 
the very wealthy to spendnearly $900m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/26/koch-brothers-889m-budget-2016-presidential-election>
 to influence the outcome of this year’s elections. Are they having any success?
A lot of people look at the success of Donald Trump and the demise of 
Jed Bush’s campaign and say that shows you money can’t buy elections. That’s 
not true. That obscures the fact that enormous sums of money from the Koch 
brothers and others are able to influence congressional and state elections. 
Most of the money they spend goes to organisations that are very active at the 
state level. But it’s extraordinarily important because the states determine 
the House of Representatives, which is largely in control of the Republican 
party. And in most of the state capitals the governorship and the legislature 
are controlled by conservative politicians. So you shouldn’t underestimate the 
influence of the Koch brothers.

What’s been the feedback on your book?
We’ve had extraordinarily good reviews. We’ve had good audiences on our book 
tour. What’s been really gratifying is the support we receive from Republicans 
as well as Democrats. If we’re ever going to make progress it’s going to have 
to be on a bipartisan basis. One thing on the negative side is I think the book 
would be getting even greater recognition if the American media weren’t so 
completely obsessed with Donald Trump’s campaign. One producer told us we’ve 
been Trumped. The media are hardly covering anything else.
