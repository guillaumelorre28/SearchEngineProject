Steve on Claire

What were you hoping for?
A fun evening, or to change my life for ever.

First impressions?
Sparkly outfit, and suitably bright and smiley to go with it.

What did you talk about?
Nineties pop, mastering the tumble turn at swimming, and favourite tube lines.

Any awkward moments?
I was born awkward. I am the most self-conscious man on the planet.

Good table manners?
Impeccable, of course.

Best thing about Claire?
I can imagine her being a loyal and supportive friend.

Would you introduce her to your friends?
I don’t see why not. They passed on plenty of advice – including which shirt 
to wear.

Describe Claire in three words
Smart, funny, warm.

What do you think she made of you?
She told me she usually went for younger men and wasn’t into beards.

Did you go on somewhere?
Only as far as the tube.

And... did you kiss?
Just a cuddle.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’ve reached the age where background music is too loud, meaning the 
conversation got a bit repetitive.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
I think following each other on Twitter is as committed as this is going to 
get.

Claire on Steve

What were you hoping for?
Someone with good conversation.


First impressions?
Punctual, nervous but pleased to see me, which was good.

What did you talk about?
His work, his shirt, my job and bananas. I was also asked what my favourite 
tube line was.

Any awkward moments?
He confessed he ran a few online polls prior to us meeting to decide what to 
talk about.

Good table manners?
Yes, he insisted on being the one to leave the tip.

We were able to talk without any awkward silences.

Pleasant, honest, kind.

Did you go on somewhere?
We walked together to the tube, then parted at the platforms.

And... did you kiss?
We did not.

If you could change one thing, what would it be?
To have had a romantic spark.
