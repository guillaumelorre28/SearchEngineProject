 Act before you start missing payments, or risk penalty charges that will add 
to your debt.

 Contact card and other loan companies to explain the position. Ask to 
negotiate a payment programme and whether they will freeze interest on your 
account.

 Draw up a budget to work out how much you can repay each month.

 Sort debts into priorities: mortgage or rent at the top, followed by council 
tax and utilities.

 Consider contacting a debt advice service. The main free services are the 
citizens advice bureaux, the National Debtline and the Consumer Credit 
Counselling Service. A counsellor can help you negotiate with creditors and the 
CCCS actually collects money from you and pays off creditors.


 You don't have to pay for debt counselling. Debt counsellors that charge a 
fee are largely unregulated, typically levy a 15 per cent charge, and possibly 
an upfront fee as well.


 Think carefully before borrowing to pay off existing debts. Banks often 
suggest you consolidate your debts, offering a rate on a personal loan that may 
be lower than rates on your other debts. This can work well, but you need to be 
sure that you don't build up fresh debts before a loan is paid off. Never 
borrow on cards to pay minimum amounts on others. This sort of juggling is a 
signal that you are in trouble.
