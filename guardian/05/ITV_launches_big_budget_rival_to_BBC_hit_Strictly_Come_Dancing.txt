ITV is to make a new celebrity dancing show on Saturday night - but it will 
not go head to head with BBC1’sStrictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing>.

The new show, called Dance Dance Dance, will recreate famous dance routines 
from music videos, movies and theatre, and promises to use “the most up to date 
technology on a truly epic scale”.

The six-part series will air next year but is not expected to be scheduled 
against Strictly Come Dancing, which traditionally airs from September to the 
end of the year, regularlywinning the ratings battle

against ITV’s The X Factor.

Dance Dance Dance is based around a format developed by The Voice makers, 
Talpa Media, aDutch production company bought by ITV last year

“It will have a very different feel to any other dance show out there,” said a 
programme insider. “It will use state of the art technology and augmented 
reality to put celebrities into classic dance routines of the past, from 
Thriller to Singing in the Rain.”

Each week, one celebrity and their partner will be voted out following a 
critique from a judging panel.


Dance Dance Dance drew impressive ratings when it premiered in Holland last 
year.

ITV will be hoping the show enjoys more success than its recent dancing talent 
contest Stepping Out, hosted by Davina McCall, which lasted only one series in 
2013.

The broadcaster has enjoyed more talent show success with Simon Cowell’s The X 
Factor and Britain’s Got Talent. It will also be home to the new series of The 
Voice, after it outbid theBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> for the 
new series.
