In 2014 we went mad for kale, quinoa and craft beer, so what will be the food 
trends of 2015?

Here are our top five predictions for the next food crazes.


Kaniwa

Now that we have all worked out how to pronounce quinoa, there is a new 
super-grain to get your lips around. Kaniwa (ka-nyi-wa), a relative of quinoa 
that also hails from South America and is dark reddish-brown in colour, with a 
nutty, slightly sweet flavour.

High in protein and gluten-free, it is smaller than quinoa but just as 
versatile, and can be used in salads, pilafs and soups – or as a breakfast food.

Also becoming popular with health-conscious celebs is the Ethiopian 
super-grain teff. Cooked in a similar way to quinoa, try it as a hot breakfast 
cereal instead of porridge.

Cauliflower

The kale craze is waning (about time). It’s time for the dowdy old cauliflower 
to have its moment to shine.

Cauliflower, long considered the poor cousin to broccoli, is becoming a 
regular on restaurant menus, jazzed up with bold sauces and interesting spices. 
Expect to see some creative versions of the cruciferous vegetable in salads and 
as side dishes.

Cauliflower steaks have already proved a hit in the US, and LA-based 
restaurant Superba Snack Bar even has a cauliflower T-bone on its menu which it 
serves with almond hummus and olive and raisin pistou. For those who are 
convinced cauliflower is bland and boring and should remain in the vegetable 
crisper, be inspired by influential New York chef Dan Barber, of Blue Hill. On 
his menu: roasted cauliflower with sausage bolognese and cheddar-bacon broth.

Seaweed

Seaweed is set to transition from sushi rolls to dinner plates with chefs 
serving it in salads, seasonings, sauces – even as a seaweed butter. High in 
iodine and purportedly excellent for detoxing, keep an eye out for dishes which 
include wakame, kombu and dulse. Beverages are also getting into the algae 
action, with a sprinkle of seaweed added to smoothies and juices. In America, a
Maine-based brewing company <http://www.marshallwharf.com/> is using seafood in 
booze, recently releasing a seaweed-infused craft beer.

Fermented foods

The buzz about kimchi, miso and sauerkraut – and their so-called probiotic 
powers – will get louder next year. While raw food enthusiasts have long 
embraced fermentation, the trend is set to go mainstream with DIY lessons on 
how to create your own sauerkraut and kombucha. Health experts are also 
encouraging people to pick up a jar of sauerkraut from their health store and 
put a dollop on their meals to improve digestion. More chefs will continue to 
work the age-old tradition into their menus and follow the lead of restaurants 
such as Marque in Sydney, which serves wagyu beef with beetroot and radicchio 
kimchi.

Ice-cream sandwiches

Sweet tooths will be doubly happy: cronuts and cupcakes are out and ice-cream 
sandwiches are on the rise. Look out for delicately constructed versions on 
dessert menus and at gelato bars as the trend, which took off in New York in 
2014, reaches Australian shores. Among the combinations are dulce de leche 
ice-cream sandwiched between chocolate chip cookies, and brownies with vanilla 
gelato. An added bonus is that unlike cupcakes, ice-cream sandwiches are quick 
and easy to make at home. Grab some biscuits, or even the old-school wafers, 
and wedge your favourite ice-cream in between.
