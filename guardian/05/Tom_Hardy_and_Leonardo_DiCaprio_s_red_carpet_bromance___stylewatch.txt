Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio> have made no secret of 
their affection for one another on The Revenant promotion trail, practically 
nuzzling nightly on the red carpet. It has been a joy witness their bromance 
unfold – and to see the relationship’s reflection in their dual red-carpet 
style.

Just a month ago the two actors dressed in contrast to one another – Hardy in 
a graphic T-shirt and a sweatband, DiCaprio in a middle-ranking bank manager’s 
suit

. Now their planets have aligned. Thursday night’s The Revenant premiere saw 
the pair mirroring each other in slightly crumpled coats – one single-breasted, 
one double – uniting against the usual red-carpet rules and refusing to suffer 
the cold just to show off the sharp lines of their suits.

In fact, with slightly squiffy collars, crooked ties and five o’clock shadow, 
the pair look like office workers who have rushed home on the train just in 
time for a parents’ evening. Two fairly normal guys who get on really well and 
just happen to be in the running for12 Oscars
