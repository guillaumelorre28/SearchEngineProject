The US polling strategist behind Goddard Gunster who was hired by the Leave.EU 
campaign backed byNigel Farage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>. The advocacy firm, which 
claims to have a 90% success rate in advising on referendums, assisted Leave.EU 
with its strategy during the EU referendum campaign.

Arron Banks

The Bristol-based multi-millionaire who has bankrolled Ukip for the last few 
years. He defected from the Conservatives before the 2015 general election and 
became part of Farage’s inner circle. He founded the Leave.EU group which 
applied unsuccessfully to be the official out campaign. It still garnered 
millions of grassroots supporters and a considerable social media presence. 
Since Farage resigned as Ukip leader (he is interim leader until a new one is 
elected), Banks has considered setting up a new anti-establishment movement 
along the lines of Five Star in Italy, which advocates direct democracy.

Nigel Farage

The interim Ukip leader has been expressing admiration, if not outright 
support, forDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> over 
the last few months. He went to the US to spin for Trump at one of the debates 
between the presidential candidates, and appeared on stage at a Trump rally. He 
was the first foreign politician to secure a meeting with the president-elect 
in person.

News website. Kassam is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart in the UK but decided 
to run for Ukip leader in the autumn. He later withdrew saying the “path to 
victory was too narrow”.
