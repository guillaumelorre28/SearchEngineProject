Natalie Portman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/natalie-portman> has advised 
graduating Harvard seniors to use their inexperience to their advantage, saying 
she has learned that taking calculated risks can lead to life-changing rewards.

The Academy Award winner, speaking at Harvard College’s class day, cited her 
work inBlack Swan <https://www.theguardian.com/film/black-swan> as an example 
of a time she did not know her own limitations and it paid off.

Portman, who won an Oscar for best actress in the 2010 film, said she might 
not have taken the role had she known how “woefully unprepared” she was to pull 
off the movie’s ballet moves.

“The point is, if I had known my own limitations I never would have taken the 
risk,” she said. “And the risk led to one of my greatest personal and 
professional achievements.”

The 33-year-old met her husband, the choreographer Benjamin Millepied, on the 
set of the movie.

Portman, who graduated from Harvard in 2003, cited another personal example: 
her first experience writing, directing and acting in a movie. The film, A Tale 
of Love and Darkness, premiered at the Cannes film festival.

“Make use of the fact that you don’t doubt yourself too much right now 
because, as we get older, we get more realistic,” she told the graduating 
seniors. “Accept your lack of knowledge and use it as your asset.”

Portman’s address was a highlight of Wednesday’s events, which also included 
award presentations and student speeches. Harvard seniors receive their 
diplomas on Thursday.

Harvard’s tradition of inviting a guest speaker to address graduates the day 
before commencement began in 1968. The first invited guest was the civil rights 
leader Martin Luther King Jr. His wife, Coretta Scott King, delivered the 
speech after his assassination.

In 2014 the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg delivered the address.
