Masterpiece of the week 

 Photograph: Courtauld Gallery/Alamy 
The Montagne Sainte-Victoire by Paul Cézanne, c1887
The light of Provence is hard and spiky in Cézanne's revolutionary modernist 
landscape. Sheer heat has turned the air into a vibrating crystalline entity. 
As if we were listening to a prelude byWagner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-wagner>, the tension rises 
inescapably as we contemplate this still yet portentous vista. Cézanne's 
longings and fears are in this heatwave of genius. Is the mountain god, or 
death, or just a rock?
