BBC director general Tony Hall <https://www.theguardian.com/media/tony-hall> 
is expected to give an update on the issue of bullying at the BBC when he 
unveils the corporation’s annual report.

In the wake of Dame Janet Smith’s report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/25/serious-failings-bbc-jimmy-savile-abuse-72-woman-children-report>
 into the failings at the BBC that allowed Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall to 
sexually abuse nearly 100 people without detection for decades, the BBC has 
tried to address bullying and Smith’s conclusion that “an atmosphere of fear 
still exists today in the BBC possibly because obtaining work in the BBC is 
highly competitive and many people no longer have the security of an employment 
contract”.


It is understood that the number of cases reported during the past year has 
fallen by around half compared with two years ago, and that Hall will talk 
about steps theBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> is making to try to 
reduce the figures further.


Hall will use the Tom Hiddleston drama The Night Manager and Mary Berry 
cookery show The Great British Bake Off as evidence of BBC success when he 
unveils the corporation’s annual report on Tuesday.

The annual report comes a year after the BBC was saddled with the £700m-plus 
cost of funding free TV licence fees for the over-75s in its controversial 
funding deal with the government.

The report is due to reveal the head count at the BBC, which despite 
cost-cutting and the efficiencies that have been made during the £700m
Delivering Quality First savings programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/10/bbc-cuts-nao-delivering-quality-first>
, has fallen by less than 150 since last year, according to sources.


The BBC will say that it has cut one in 10 senior managers, with the total 
reduced to 356 from 401 last year and 640 in 2009. The senior management bill 
has been reduced by £5m and is down 40% since 2009, while talent pay has been 
cut by £8m to less than £200m.

The amount of money it spends on its biggest earning stars has been cut by 
more than £2m following the departure of some of its most familiar faces, 
includingformer Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson

The number of people earning between £500,000 and £5m – the highest BBC pay 
bracket – fell from nine in 2014/15 to seven in the last financial year, 
according to figures released by the corporation last month.

The total pay bill for its biggest stars – likely to include Match of the Day 
presenter Gary Lineker, Radio 2 breakfast DJ Chris Evans and talkshow host 
Graham Norton – fell by 25% from £8.9m to £6.6m.

The BBC does not currently identify any of its top-earning stars, but 
on-screen talent earning more than Hall – who is paid £450,000 – will be named 
under plans outlined by the government.

Meanwhile, commercial division BBC Worldwide is understood to have increased 
revenues by around 3%. Worldwide is thought to usually make about £50m a year 
from its most lucrative show, Top Gear. It is not known how much impact

<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/12/jeremy-clarkson-bbc-bosses-fracas-top-gear-suspension>
 has had on worldwide sales of the car series and on merchandising.

The BBC has declared itself broadly happy with the government’s white paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/bbc-white-paper-key-points-john-whittingdale>
 on its future published in May, before the renewal of its royal charter at the 
end of the year.

But critical details, including the make-up of the corporation’s unitary 
board, which will absorb some of the responsibilities of the BBC Trust, are 
still to be agreed, with concerns about the impact of government-imposed 
appointees on its independence.

A BBC source said: “Programmes like The Night Manager and War and Peace have 
shown the BBC at its creative best over the past year and by cutting senior 
managers and back-office costs we have been able to focus more of our money on 
the things which really matter to the public.


“There are still tough financial challenges ahead, so the search for savings 
is not over, but the progress we have made will help us create a BBC fit for 
the digital age, which continues to act as a creative beacon to the world.”

Last week the BBC named finance chief Anne Bulford as deputy director general 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/06/bbc-anne-bulford-deputy-director-general>
 in a senior staff restructure that will reduce the corporation’s top executive 
team by almost a third, from 16 members to 11. The appointment of Bulford 
marked the first time the corporation has had a deputy director general since 
the departure of Mark Byford in 2011.
