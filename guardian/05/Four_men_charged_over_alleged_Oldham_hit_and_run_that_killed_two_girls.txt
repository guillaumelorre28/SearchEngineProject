Four men have been charged over the deaths of a 12-year-old girl and her 
younger cousin after an apparent hit-and-run incident in Greater Manchester on 
New Year’s Eve.

Helena Kotlarova and Zaneta Krokova, 11, were crossing the road in Oldham 
holding hands when they were hit by a car.

Helena was pronounced dead at the scene and Zaneta died two days later in 
hospital.

On Wednesday Greater Manchester police charged four men with offences 
including causing death by dangerous driving.

Gabor Hegedus, 39, from Oldham, was charged with two counts of causing death 
by dangerous driving, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, driving 
without a licence, failing to stop after a collision and failing to report the 
collision.

David Orsos, 18, Janos Kalanyos, 50, and Zoltan Peto, 49, also of Oldham, were 
charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

The men have been remanded in custody and were due to appear at Tameside 
magistrates court later on Wednesday.

Helena’s parents, Sylva and Robert, raced to the scene, 100 metres from their 
home, moments after the girls were hit.

Helena’s sister, Sylva Kotlarova, 19, described how her mother held the 
fatally injured 12-year-old and stroked her hair before she was pronounced dead 
by paramedics.


Helena, who has seven sisters and one brother, came to England from the Czech 
Republic eight years ago, her family told reporters. She attended the 
Collective Spirit free school in Oldham.
