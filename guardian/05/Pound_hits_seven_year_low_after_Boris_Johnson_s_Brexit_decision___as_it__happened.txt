Pound suffers biggest one day fall since Cameron became PM

A growing risk of Britain leaving the European Union has sent the pound 
tumbling.

Against the dollar the UK currency has suffered its biggest one day fall since 
prime minister David Cameron first came to power in 2010.

It has fallen 1.72% to $1.4156, its worst daily performance since May 6 2010 - 
the day of the general election - when it fell 2.22%.

It has also reached its lowest level against the US currency since March 2009.

Against a basket of currencies the pound is at its weakest since April 2014.

The fears of a Brexit grew as London mayor Boris Johnson said he backed the UK 
leaving the European Union, whileMoody’s added to the uncertainty by saying the 
country’s credit rating could be affected.

ETX Capital currency trader Richard Wiltshire told Reuters:

Boris has upset the apple cart in going against his party leader. Everyone is 
now thinking it’s going to be a much closer-run thing than we previously 
thought.

On that note it’s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments and we’ll be 
back tomorrow.

European stock markets end higher

A rebound in commodity prices has lifted European shares despite the 
uncertainty created by the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union. Hopes 
of further Chinese stimulus to boost its economy and thus increase demand for 
commodities lifted metal prices, while oil was also higher in the wake of last 
week’s proposals to freeze supply levels and talk that US shale output was 
falling.

The pound dropped sharply as London mayor Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> said he would campaign for a 
Brexit, but stock markets shrugged off the uncertainty. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 87.50 points or 1.47% at 6037.73 
 * Germany’s Dax added 1.98% to 9573.59 
 * France’s Cac climbed 1.79% to 4298.70 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 3.52% to 17,504.58 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 2.35% at 8387.0 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 1.55% to 487.97 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 213 points or 
1.3%.

Sterling is likely to continue falling even with the risk of Brexit, says 
CapitalEconomics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics>, partly 
because the US is likely to continue raising interest rates while the Bank of 
England holds steady. The research group’s analyst John Higgins said:

Our forecast remains that sterling will fall further against the dollar this 
year, to $1.30 from around $1.41 now. Granted, the exchange rate has already 
fallen a long way in 2016, despite some stability in the gap between UK and US 
interest rate expectations.

 And if the recent experience of Scotland’s referendum on membership of the UK 
is any guide, the exchange rate could rebound if it becomes clear to investors 
that the UK electorate will vote to stay in the EU. After all, sterling’s slide 
on Monday was similar in scale to the one that took place on the 8th September 
2014, when a YouGov poll suggested Scotland might vote to secede from the UK – 
that slide had been completed unwound by the time the referendum took place 
eleven days later.

 Yet a week is a long time in politics, let alone four months. So now, as 
then, there is ample opportunity for uncertainty about the result of the 
referendum to weigh on sterling, especially given the UK’s reliance on foreign 
investors to plug its large current account deficit. Indeed, our forecast that 
sterling will fall to $1.30 is partly based on a view that a further decline in 
the UK’s currency is needed in order to rebalance her economy...

There is another key reason why we expect sterling to lose more ground against 
the dollar, which is the relative prospects for monetary policy in the UK and 
US...

The risk of a Brexit could make the Bank of England disinclined to begin to 
tighten monetary policy before the referendum and we think it is likely to 
tread cautiously thereafter. Our end-2016 forecast for UK Bank Rate is 
therefore 0.75%. While this is more hawkish than the rate implied in the 
market, it represents just one 25 basis point increase from the current level.

By contrast, our end-2016 forecast for the US federal funds rate is a range of 
1.0-1.25%, the equivalent of a further three increases of 25 basis points each. 
We continue to expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy much more rapidly than 
expected by the average investor as a tightening labour market in the US puts 
upward pressure on wage inflation.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said:

There is no doubt that the Brexit referendum is rapidly becoming one of the 
biggest risk events of 2016 for financial markets. Boris Johnson’s decision to 
bolster the ‘out’ campaign with his support not only serves to undermine the 
fruits of David Cameron’s labour in Brussels, but clearly damages UK economic 
confidence, with sterling pounded across the board today. With the referendum 
set to take place in June, when the migrant crisis will be back into full flow, 
anxiety and fear will certainly push some voters towards a more isolationist 
stance.

Sterling seems to be picking up slightly as he speaks, but the questioning 
once he finishes is likely to be key.

As prime minister David Cameron stands up in the Commons to defend his EU 
deal, ING Bank suggests the pound could have further to fall. Strategist Viraj 
Patel said:

We remain cautious in prematurely calling the end of the Brexit-induced GBP 
downside.

The role of Brexit in steering recent sterling price action can be likened to 
a roller coaster warming up with some small twist and turns before an 
inevitable sharp drop.

Our short-term financial models show that even after today’s sharp move lower, 
only a 1.5-2.0% risk premium is priced into sterling/dollar. Moreover, other UK 
asset markets are yet to be trading with any meaningful discount, while UK 
activity data is also likely to show signs of a temporary slowdown over the 
coming months. Hence, there are still valid reasons why the UK’s in-out 
referendum poses further downside risks to the pound.

Sterling’s recent immunity to opinion polls is a double-edged sword; while any 
under-estimation of Brexit risks by markets would limit near-term downside, the 
economic and political costs of a Brexit are likely to dawn on investors as we 
approach the June vote. As such, the pricing in of any Brexit risk premium 
could manifest itself swiftly and aggressively (while only fully showing up in 
the weeks or months leading up the vote).

Expect sterling implied volatilities to stay very elevated, particularly those 
covering the referendum date. Today’s price action in the pound risk reversals 
shows the “longevity” of Brexit risks (ie, the enduring nature of downside 
potential stemming from a UK exit).

Everyone wants their say on Brexit and after Moody’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/22/pound-falls-city-gets-brexit-jitters-business-live?page=with:block-56cb20c9e4b041c56e71d6ca#block-56cb20c9e4b041c56e71d6ca>
, comes Fitch.

The ratings agency says the impact of a vote for Britain to leave the EU is 
uncertain but could have significant risks, depending on the reaction of the 
remainder of the Union:

Lengthy negotiations and uncertainty over UK firms’ future access to EU 
markets following a vote to leave in the upcoming referendum on EU membership 
(Brexit) would weigh on confidence and delay investment decisions. This would 
have a short-term economic cost, although the precise impact would be highly 
uncertain...

 We believe that in the event of a Leave vote, the authorities on both sides 
would try to avoid disrupting the deep economic and financial integration 
between the UK and EU by establishing a clear new relationship, including a 
trade agreement that preserves UK attractiveness for investment. Some 
tightening of the freedom of EU citizens’ to work in the UK would be likely. 
Avoiding large-scale, permanent disruption to trade relations, including 
services, could limit the long-term economic cost to the UK, with Brexit only 
moderately negative for the UK.

But there would be significant risks, especially if the remaining EU members 
attempted to impose punitive conditions on the UK to deter other countries from 
leaving, or the UK sought very tough restrictions on EU citizens coming to work 
in the UK.

US manufacturing weaker than forecast

Over to the US briefly and some weaker than expected manufacturing figures, 
adding to the idea that a rate rise from the Federal Reserve could be some way 
off.

The Markit initial estimate for the manufacturing purchasing managers index 
came in at 51 for February compared to forecasts of 52.3 and last month’s 
figure of 52.4. This is the lowest reading since October 2012.

The news has supported equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
now up 1.3% or 221 points.

A growing risk of Britain leaving the European Union has sent the pound 
tumbling.

Against the dollar the UK currency has suffered its biggest one day fall since 
prime minister David Cameron first came to power in 2010.

It has fallen 1.72% to $1.4156, its worst daily performance since May 6 2010 - 
the day of the general election - when it fell 2.22%.

It has also reached its lowest level against the US currency since March 2009.

Against a basket of currencies the pound is at its weakest since April 2014.

The fears of a Brexit grew as London mayor Boris Johnson said he backed the UK 
leaving the European Union, whileMoody’s added to the uncertainty by saying the 
country’s credit rating could be affected. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/22/moodys-warns-on-brexit-risk-to-uk-credit-rating-eu-referendum>
ETX Capital currency trader Richard Wiltshire told Reuters:

Boris has upset the apple cart in going against his party leader. Everyone is 
now thinking it’s going to be a much closer-run thing than we previously 
thought.

On that note it’s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments and we’ll be 
back tomorrow.
 
A rebound in commodity prices has lifted European shares despite the 
uncertainty created by the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union. Hopes 
of further Chinese stimulus to boost its economy and thus increase demand for 
commodities lifted metal prices, while oil was also higher in the wake of last 
week’s proposals to freeze supply levels and talk that US shale output was 
falling.

The pound dropped sharply as London mayor Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> said he would campaign for a 
Brexit, but stock markets shrugged off the uncertainty. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 87.50 points or 1.47% at 6037.73 
 * Germany’s Dax added 1.98% to 9573.59 
 * France’s Cac climbed 1.79% to 4298.70 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 3.52% to 17,504.58

Sterling is likely to continue falling even with the risk of Brexit, says 
CapitalEconomics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics>, partly 
because the US is likely to continue raising interest rates while the Bank of 
England holds steady. The research group’s analyst John Higgins said:

Our forecast remains that sterling will fall further against the dollar this 
year, to $1.30 from around $1.41 now. Granted, the exchange rate has already 
fallen a long way in 2016, despite some stability in the gap between UK and US 
interest rate expectations.

 And if the recent experience of Scotland’s referendum on membership of the UK 
is any guide, the exchange rate could rebound if it becomes clear to investors 
that the UK electorate will vote to stay in the EU. After all, sterling’s slide 
on Monday was similar in scale to the one that took place on the 8th September 
2014, when a YouGov poll suggested Scotland might vote to secede from the UK – 
that slide had been completed unwound by the time the referendum took place 
eleven days later.

 Yet a week is a long time in politics, let alone four months. So now, as 
then, there is ample opportunity for uncertainty about the result of the 
referendum to weigh on sterling, especially given the UK’s reliance on foreign 
investors to plug its large current account deficit. Indeed, our forecast that 
sterling will fall to $1.30 is partly based on a view that a further decline in 
the UK’s currency is needed in order to rebalance her economy...

There is another key reason why we expect sterling to lose more ground against 
the dollar, which is the relative prospects for monetary policy in the UK and 
US...

The risk of a Brexit could make the Bank of England disinclined to begin to 
tighten monetary policy before the referendum and we think it is likely to 
tread cautiously thereafter. Our end-2016 forecast for UK Bank Rate is 
therefore 0.75%. While this is more hawkish than the rate implied in the 
market, it represents just one 25 basis point increase from the current level.

By contrast, our end-2016 forecast for the US federal funds rate is a range of 
1.0-1.25%, the equivalent of a further three increases of 25 basis points each. 
We continue to expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy much more rapidly than 
expected by the average investor as a tightening labour market in the US puts 
upward pressure on wage inflation.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said:

There is no doubt that the Brexit referendum is rapidly becoming one of the 
biggest risk events of 2016 for financial markets. Boris Johnson’s decision to 
bolster the ‘out’ campaign with his support not only serves to undermine the 
fruits of David Cameron’s labour in Brussels, but clearly damages UK economic 
confidence, with sterling pounded across the board today. With the referendum 
set to take place in June, when the migrant crisis will be back into full flow, 
anxiety and fear will certainly push some voters towards a more isolationist 
stance.

Sterling seems to be picking up slightly as he speaks, but the questioning 
once he finishes is likely to be key.



 
As prime minister David Cameron stands up in the Commons to defend his EU 
deal, ING Bank suggests the pound could have further to fall. Strategist Viraj 
Patel said:

We remain cautious in prematurely calling the end of the Brexit-induced GBP 
downside.

The role of Brexit in steering recent sterling price action can be likened to 
a roller coaster warming up with some small twist and turns before an 
inevitable sharp drop.

Our short-term financial models show that even after today’s sharp move lower, 
only a 1.5-2.0% risk premium is priced into sterling/dollar. Moreover, other UK 
asset markets are yet to be trading with any meaningful discount, while UK 
activity data is also likely to show signs of a temporary slowdown over the 
coming months. Hence, there are still valid reasons why the UK’s in-out 
referendum poses further downside risks to the pound.

Sterling’s recent immunity to opinion polls is a double-edged sword; while any 
under-estimation of Brexit risks by markets would limit near-term downside, the 
economic and political costs of a Brexit are likely to dawn on investors as we 
approach the June vote. As such, the pricing in of any Brexit risk premium 
could manifest itself swiftly and aggressively (while only fully showing up in 
the weeks or months leading up the vote).

Expect sterling implied volatilities to stay very elevated, particularly those 
covering the referendum date. Today’s price action in the pound risk reversals 
shows the “longevity” of Brexit risks (ie, the enduring nature of downside 
potential stemming from a UK exit).
 
Everyone wants their say on Brexit and after Moody’s

, comes Fitch.

The ratings agency says the impact of a vote for Britain to leave the EU is 
uncertain but could have significant risks, depending on the reaction of the 
remainder of the Union:

Lengthy negotiations and uncertainty over UK firms’ future access to EU 
markets following a vote to leave in the upcoming referendum on EU membership 
(Brexit) would weigh on confidence and delay investment decisions. This would 
have a short-term economic cost, although the precise impact would be highly 
uncertain...

 We believe that in the event of a Leave vote, the authorities on both sides 
would try to avoid disrupting the deep economic and financial integration 
between the UK and EU by establishing a clear new relationship, including a 
trade agreement that preserves UK attractiveness for investment. Some 
tightening of the freedom of EU citizens’ to work in the UK would be likely. 
Avoiding large-scale, permanent disruption to trade relations, including 
services, could limit the long-term economic cost to the UK, with Brexit only 
moderately negative for the UK.

But there would be significant risks, especially if the remaining EU members 
attempted to impose punitive conditions on the UK to deter other countries from 
leaving, or the UK sought very tough restrictions on EU citizens coming to work 
in the UK.

Over to the US briefly and some weaker than expected manufacturing figures, 
adding to the idea that a rate rise from the Federal Reserve could be some way 
off.

The Markit initial estimate for the manufacturing purchasing managers index 
came in at 51 for February compared to forecasts of 52.3 and last month’s 
figure of 52.4. This is the lowest reading since October 2012.

The news has supported equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
now up 1.3% or 221 points.
