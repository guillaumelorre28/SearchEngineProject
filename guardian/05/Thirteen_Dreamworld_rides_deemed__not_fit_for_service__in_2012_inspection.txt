Air compressors on 13 Dreamworld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/dreamworld> rides, including the 
rapids ride, were deemed “not fit for service” in an inspection four years ago, 
according to documents released by Queensland’s workplace regulator.

The death of four people on Tuesday afternoon on the Thunder River Rapids ride 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/25/dreamworld-accident-gold-coast-theme-park>
 has sparked an immediate coronial investigation and an inquiry by Workplace 
Health and Safety Queensland.

It has also raised questions about Dreamworld’s maintenance of rides 
throughout the theme park. Late on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Dreamworld’s 
public relations company said a complete safety audit had been undertaken for 
the Rapids ride on 26 September.

However, the Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland>
 secretary of the Australian Workers’ Union, Ben Swan, said there had been 
concerns raised over the past 18 months about maintenance at the park.

He told Guardian Australia that there had been a number of operational and 
maintenance issues raised about rides at Dreamworld “from a very general point 
of view”.

A series of documents obtained by the AWU in 2015 and released by the 
Queensland Office of Industrial Relations on Wednesday set out a number of 
complaints, some of which sparked inspections at the park.

In November 2012 an inspector for Australian In-Service Inspection Pty Ltd 
examined “air receivers” on 13 rides.

Air receivers are part of air compression systems that help to store 
compressed air. These types of systems can be used on amusement rides to propel 
rides along at speed, for instance as part of a rollercoaster.

 by Safe Work Australia said they can “explode and cause serious injuries or 
death if they are not adequately inspected and maintained, or if they have been 
operated above the design pressure”.

In an email to Workplace Health and Safety he said: “I issued corrective 
actions for all of the vessels examined and declared all of the vessels not fit 
for service, including the requirement for registration of the plant with QLD 
Workplace Health and Safety.”

He said Dreamworld’s engineer had told him they were exempt from registration 
requirements because they were part of the amusement park.

“The engineering department at Dreamworld did not produce any evidence of 
having a quality management system in place or any previous vessel inspection 
reports.”

The company declined to correspond with the inspector any further, according 
to the email. The inspector wrote to the workplace regulator: “This leaves me 
with no option but to request your mediation to resolve the outstanding 
corrective actions to assist in closing out my reports.”

The Queensland workplace regulator allocated an inspector to the case, who 
said the state government had determined it didn’t want to “double dip” on 
licences for the air compressors – and that 13 separate ones were not required 
for the rides. It is unclear what action the regulator required for the other 
issues identified.

The documents also reveal that the owner of Dreamworld, Ardent Leisure 
Limited, challenged the disclosure of the documents to the AWU. The case went 
on appeal to the Queensland information commissioner, who rejected the 
arguments put forward by Dreamworld’s owner and said access “may not be refused 
to any of the information in issue”.

In another complaint in October 2012 an anonymous author lodged a written 
complaint with the regulator that said: “Several rides and water slides are in 
dire need of fixing, rust visible and falling into pools and major leaks, 
cracks, chips on slides.”

“Tape is used to cover rides, Queensland licence stickers out of date at 
rides”.

On Wednesday, a media statement supplied through Dreamworld’s PR company from 
DRA Safety Specialists said: “Dreamworld under the leadership of Craig 
Davidson, the CEO has demonstrated a commitment to developing and maintaining a 
strong safety culture across all departments.

“Annual audits have resulted in continuous improvement in the management of 
safety. A number of consultancy visits to assist in the implementation have 
been undertaken and have included regular training programs with the senior 
leadership team which have kept them abreast of legislative requirements and 
changes.”
