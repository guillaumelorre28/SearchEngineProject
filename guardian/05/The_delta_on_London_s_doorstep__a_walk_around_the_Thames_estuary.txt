As a child playing on the beach in Southend, I used to think the hazy land I 
could see on the far horizon was France. It was actually the Isle of Sheppey, 
but the opposite shore of this wide estuary was so distant and unfamiliar, it 
might as well have been another country. My sense of geography has improved 
since then, but my knowledge of the mysterious outer reaches of the Thames 
estuary remains sketchy.

If the Thames between Westminster and Greenwich is the show that London puts 
on for tourists, the stretch beyond the Thames barrier is backstage, where the 
ropes and pulleys that keep the glittering spectacle in place are hidden. As 
the river widens to meet the North Sea, the city’s ornate bridges, Victorian 
warehouses and slick waterside apartments give way to petrochemical plants, 
power stations, cement works and landfill sites.

It ain’t pretty, but heavy industry is only a part of the story. For centuries 
the “edgelands” of south Essex and north Kent have been a place of refuge and 
inspiration for artists, writers, slum dwellers, religious sects and 
visionaries looking to escape the city. And it’s not just human migrants who 
have found a home here: the estuary’s marshes and mudflats are one of the 
country’s richest wildlife habitats.

Since moving back to Essex a couple of years ago, I’ve become increasingly 
fascinated by the moody riverscapes and big skies of the estuary. So I plotted 
a journey that would take me around its outer reaches. Starting in Southend, 
not far from my home, I would walk upriver to Tilbury, catch the passenger 
ferry across to Gravesend and walk back along the north Kent coast, finishing 
at the Isle of Sheppey.

 The ruins of Hadleigh castle in the distance 
Before setting off, I arranged to meet Colette Bailey, artistic director of 
Southend-based arts organisation Metal. It’s the driving force behindEstuary 
<http://www.estuaryfestival.com/>, a new biennial arts festival that launches 
in September and will celebrate the stories and subcultures of the area, with 
an exciting programme of walks, talks, art exhibitions and literary and music 
events in venues as diverse asSouthend Pier 
<http://www.visitessex.com/thedms.aspx?dms=3&venue=0670439> and Tilbury cruise 
terminal <http://www.londoncruiseterminal.com/>.

I ask Bailey what it is about this landscape that makes it so inspiring for 
artists. “It’s unknowable, it’s full of mystery, and it has endless stories, 
some of which are really hidden, quite literally under the water,” she says. 
“Before planes, this was the major route into the country, so all of history 
has passed through here.”

depending on which way you’re travelling) of theThames Estuary Path 
<http://www.thamesestuarypath.co.uk/>, a 29-mile walking route that opened two 
years ago, linking Tilbury with the seaside town of Southend. For much of its

 Jo in Canvey Island, birthplace of Dr Feelgood 
After four miles the path emerges from the country park at Benfleet train 
station. At this point there’s a choice between following the trail upriver, or 
taking a diversion on to Canvey Island. Reclaimed from the tides by Dutch 
engineers in the 17th century, Canvey is perhaps best known as the place that 
spawned pub-rock bandDr Feelgood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/dr-feelgood-all-through-review>. 
Their long-time manager, Chris Fenwick, runs occasional guided walks for fans 
and agrees to show me around.

We meet outside the Lobster Smack 
<http://www.thelobstersmackcanveyisland.co.uk/>, a weather-boarded old 
mariners’ pub, once famous for bare-knuckle fighting, and Chris points out the 
spot where the sleeve for Dr Feelgood’s debut album,Down by the Jetty, was 
shot. We walk along the sea wall, passing one of the oil storage depots from 
which aviation fuel is pumped via underground pipelines from Canvey to Heathrow 
airport. As we pass, a siren starts to wail, adding to the eeriness.

 Paddling pool at Concord Beach, Canvey Island 
One of the best insights into Canvey and the influences that shaped Dr 
Feelgood can be found in Julien Temple’s brilliant documentaryOil City 
Confidential <http://www.oilcityconfidential.co.uk/>. The film plays with the 
idea of the Essex mudflats, creeks and oil refineries as the British answer to 
the Mississippi delta, a notion that the band themselves were happy to buy in 
to. “We were great romanticisers,” says Fenwick. “We loved boats and the blues 
music of the American south. If you’ve got a bit of imagination, this could 
easily be the marshland of Louisiana.”

Chris tells me he likes the film because it “captures the barminess of 
Canvey”. And there is undeniably something quite bonkers about this place, 
where caravan parks sit in the shadow of petrochemical plants and children 
paddle in the river as huge cargo ships glide by. It wasn’t so long ago that 
Canvey was being promoted as the “Thames Riviera”.The Labworth 
<http://www.thelabworth.com/>, a handsome modernist building with cruise-ship 
curves designed byOve Arup <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ove_Arup> in the 
1930s, is a hangover from those heady days and one of the best places to eat on 
the island. Just behind the Labworth, Chris points out the Monico, one of the 
nightclubs where Dr Feelgood cut their teeth in the 1970s. The home crowds were 
the hardest to play, as the islanders remained unimpressed by the band’s 
success. “It was a real straightener,” he says. “If you can front this lot up, 
you can front anywhere in the world.”

 Jo at the Labworth cafe, designed by Ove Arup 
Our walk finishes at Canvey Heights, a country park at the eastern tip of the 
island, with far-reaching views towards Southend Pier and the North Sea. “The 
view is never the same twice,” says Chris, whose next public walk will take 
place on 30 September, as part of the Estuary festival. “The sky and the tides 
and the river traffic are always changing.”

At Benfleet, the Thames Estuary Path curves inland for several miles. Parts of 
this stretch can feel suburban at times, as you skirt around the edge of yet 
another housing estate, but it’s worth persevering for theThurrock Thameside 
nature park <http://www.essexwt.org.uk/reserves/thurrock-thameside>, an 
extraordinary project which is restoring to wilderness one of Europe’s largest 
landfill sites and creating an important habitat for wading birds, brown hares, 
water voles, adders, butterflies and bats. The cafe in the striking new visitor 
centre is a good spot for a coffee stop.

On the approach to Tilbury the river starts to narrow, and the Thames’ 
historic strategic importance becomes apparent as I pass theVictorian Coalhouse 
Fort <http://www.coalhousefort.co.uk/>, a second world war radar tower and the 
Tudor-builtTilbury Fort 
<http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/tilbury-fort/> in quick 
succession. Between these fortifications is Clinker Beach, where each new tide 
deposits a hoard of old porcelain fragments, medicine bottles, clay pipes and 
the odd human bone.

Ahead of me is Tilbury Dock, where the Empire Windrush landed from Kingston, 
Jamaica, in 1948. The cruise terminal is off-limits to non-passengers, but for 
the 16 days of the Estuary festival it will be turned into an art gallery and 
literary salon, giving visitors a rare chance to glimpse inside its historic 
buildings. A tall ship will be moored outside for the duration of the festival, 
renting out cabins for overnight stays, but in the meantime your best bet for a 
room is theBell Inn <http://www.bell-inn.co.uk/> (doubles from £80 B&B), a 
15th-century coaching inn in Horndon-on-the-Hill, a 20-minute cab ride from 
Tilbury.

Boats have been ferrying passengers between the ancient ports of Tilbury and 
Gravesend for at least 500 years. Waiting for the ferry on the floating pontoon 
at Tilbury, I feel a thrill that I can’t say I’ve ever experienced queuing to 
enter the Dartford Tunnel, a couple of miles upriver. The boat that eventually 
pulls up is much smaller and older than I’d been expecting, but that only adds 
to the sense of adventure.

As we cross the river (£3 for an off-peak return 
<https://www.thurrock.gov.uk/ferry-services/tilbury-to-gravesend-ferry-service>
), I get talking to a group of young people commuting to work in a shopping 
centre in Gravesend. I ask them what there is to see in the town. “Literally 
nothing,” comes the reply.

It turns out that this is a slightly downbeat assessment of Gravesend’s 
charms. The narrow, cobbled high street that leads uphill from the pontoon is 
festooned with bunting and lined with quirky shops selling everything from 
saris to Airfix models. But there’s no time for shopping, as I’m here to meet 
my friend Carole at Gravesend station, to begin the next leg of the journey.

Gravesend is the starting point for the Saxon Shore Way 
<https://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Saxon+Shore+Way>, 
a long-distance footpath that hugs the Kent and Sussex coastline. It starts off 
promisingly enough, with green footpath signs pointing east along the 
riverfront, but it’s not long before we’re wandering around a dismal industrial 
estate, wondering if we’ve taken a wrong turn. Fortunately, Carole knows how to 
read a map and assures me we’re going the right way. So we plod on through 
yards piled high with shipping containers, buoys and rusting anchors, 
eventually emerging onto a scrubby expanse of foreshore, grazed by piebaldIrish 
cobs 
<https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Irish+cob&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk4qnAxJPOAhWsIsAKHeZFDR4Q_AUICCgB&biw=1872&bih=877>
.

With the river to our left we stride out along the grassy embankment, gulls 
screeching above us. Charles Dickens, who lived near Rochester, was an avid 
explorer of these lonely marshlands and took his inspiration for the opening 
scenes of Great Expectations – in which young Pip first encounters the escaped 
convict Magwitch in a graveyard – from the Hoo peninsula. At the ruined Cliffe 
fortress we stop to watch a pristine white cruise liner head serenely upriver, 
while in the foreground the wooden ribs of a ship’s hull poke from the muddy 
riverbed like the skeleton of a beached whale. There are an estimated 1,000 
wrecks on the bed of the estuary, victims of the Thames’ merciless tides and 
currents.

The footpath here is currently closed due to erosion, but we manage to clamber 
down on to the beach and rejoin it later as it heads inland past theCliffe 
Pools RSPB reserve 
<http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/c/cliffepools/>
, which is famous for its nightingales, and into the village of Cliffe, where 
we stop at theSix Bells 
<http://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/pubs/rochester/six-bells> for a late lunch. 
From here you can follow the Saxon Shore Way all the way to Rochester and 
beyond, but with the afternoon drawing on, we decide to call it a day and catch 
a bus from outside the pub to Strood train station.

The distant shores of Sheppey may have stood for all that was foreign and 
mysterious when I was a child, but the reality is slightly more prosaic. The 
island, which is cut off from the mainland by the River Medway, has its fair 
share of caravan sites and dubious looking “fun pubs”, but it’s also home to 
one the UK’s most important nature reserves.

Elmley <http://www.elmleynaturereserve.co.uk/> is unusual on two counts: it’s 
the only farm-managed national nature reserve, with a cattle-grazing regime 
designed to keep the grass exactly the right height for the breeding lapwing 
and redshank; and it’s the only nature reserve in the country where you can 
spend the night.

If you’re coming by train the managers of the reserve can pick you up from the 
station at Swale Halt or Sittingbourne for a small fee. Within minutes of 
arriving we’ve spotted a heron, two swans, a hare and dozens of marsh birds and 
tiny rabbits.

 One of the shepherd’s huts at Elmley. Photograph: PR 
The owners, Georgina and Gareth, show us to one of the custom-built shepherd’s 
huts <http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/kent/elmley>, which sit 
overlooking the marshes (a fourth will open this summer). Ours,Vanellus 
<http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/kent/elmley/vanellus> (sleeps 
two, from £95 a night), strikes the perfect balance between rustic and luxe, 
with a cosy sheepskin rug, cabinets from reclaimed wood and an en suite 
bathroom with flushing loo. The attention to detail is impressive: the window 
allows you to birdwatch and stargaze without leaving the comfort of your 
kingsize bed.

The skies here are enormous, and as the sun starts to set we light a fire 
outside our hut, pour a glass of the sloe gin Georgina has thoughtfully left 
for us, and watch birds skimming the lagoon. The sense of peace and space are 
uplifting. As if on cue, a barn owl emerges from the tree opposite, drifting 
silently and ghostly white over the reedbeds. This may not be France, but it 
feels a long way from home.
