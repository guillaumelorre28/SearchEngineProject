It was described as a “meat market” and a “Blind Date in a brothel”, but 
Channel 4’s nude dating show, Naked Attraction, rose to the occasion and drew 
more viewers than both BBC2 and Channel 5’s Big Brother on Monday night.


Naked Attraction, presented by Anna Richardson, featured copious full frontal 
nudity, like Sex Box but without the box (or the sex) or, if you prefer, How To 
Look Good Naked without the tiresome clothes shopping trip with Gok Wan.


The new series began with 1.4 million viewers, a 9.1% share of the audience, 
from 10pm on Monday.

It had the better of Channel 5’s Big Brother, which drew 1.2 million viewers 
(7.9%), also from 10pm, and BBC2’s Rhod Gilbert’s Work Experience, which lost 
its shirt with 400,000 viewers, a 2.6% share, between 10pm and 10.30pm.


Naked Attraction did better than the first outing of Mariella Frostrup’s Sex 
Box, in which couples had sex in a box and then talked about it, which drew 1.1 
million viewers in 2013.


The Daily Mail’s reviewer said

 the show was “like Blind Date in a brothel”.


“Anyone who doubts the poisonous influence of internet porn has only to watch 
five minutes of Naked Attraction to see the damage done,” wrote Christopher 
Stevens.

“For an entire generation, constant exposure to clinical sexual footage has 
ripped the soul out of erotic love.”


In a similar vein, the Daily Telegraph said 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/07/25/naked-attraction-how-low-can-this-channel-4-dating-show-go/>
 it was “Blind Date with knobs on” and “reduced human attraction to a kind of 
game show meat market. How low can this Channel 4 dating show go?”
