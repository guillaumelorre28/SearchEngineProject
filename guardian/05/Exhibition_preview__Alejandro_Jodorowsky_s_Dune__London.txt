This is one of those exhibitions that brings out the nerd in all of us. 
Subtitled An Exhibition Of A Film Of A Book That Never Was, it has been curated 
by Tom Morton, who has got hold of a series of drawings created for the film 
directorAlejandro Jodorowsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alejandro-jodorowsky> for his doomed 1976 
Dune project. Sci-fi artist Chris Foss, Swiss painter HR Giger (later famed for 
his designs for Ridley Scott's Alien) and French cartoonist Moebius all 
contributed fantastical sketches, picturing a post-apocalyptic world of desert 
sands and monolithic totems, some of which can be seen here alongside 
commissioned work made in response by Steven Claydon, Matthew Day Jackson and 
Vidya Gastaldon. Jodorowsky never managed to secure the funding for his epic 
movie and the project was abandoned before a single frame was shot, but this 
collection offers a tantalizing vision of what might have been.
