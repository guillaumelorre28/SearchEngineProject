Fade in. An aerial view of an anonymous US suburb. A voiceover begins.

"My name is Lester Burnham." 

Closer in on the streets below. 

"This is my neighbourhood." 

Cut to a generic tree-lined avenue. 

"This is my street." 

Cut to Lester (Kevin Spacey), dozing in bed. 

"This is my life. I'm 42 years old. In less than year, I'll be dead." 

Lester's alarm clock goes off. 

"Of course, I don't know that yet." 

He stumbles out of bed. 

"In a way, I'm dead already." 

Cut to Lester, behind the thick glass of the shower. He masturbates 
unenthusiastically.

"Look at me, jerking off in the shower. This will be the highpoint of my day. 
It's all downhill from here."

Outside, in the garden, an immaculately presented woman (Annette Bening) 
hovers over a rosebed.

"That's my wife, Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears 
matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident."

A smart man in early middle-age (Scott Bakula) approaches. 

"That's our next door neighbour, Jim." 

An equally dapper man of around the same age (Sam Robards) follows him. 

"That's his lover, Jim." 

"Morning Jim!" Carolyn cries. 

"Morning Carolyn!" 

Cut back to Lester, standing glumly at the window. 

"I'm exhausted just watching her. She wasn't always like this. She used to be 
happy. We used to be happy."
