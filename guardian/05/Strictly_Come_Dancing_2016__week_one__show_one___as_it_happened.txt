So that’s it for the first live show! The other nine contestants are giving it 
full glitter and jazz hands at 6.30pm tomorrow, so join me then and we’ll do it 
all again (repeat every weekend until Christmas).


In the meantime you can find me on Twitter/Insta @heidistephens, or if you’re 
up early I’m on BBC5Live at 6.50am-ish tomorrow chatting all things Strictly. 
Thanks for joining in, it’s great to be back. See you tomorrow!

Bruno shouts a bit about Greg could go all the way - it didn’t have precision, 
but Greg gave it plenty of welly. Craig thought it was flat-footed and stompy 
and he was pigeon-toed, but he enjoyed it enormously. Darcey thought Greg 
looked like a blue frog jumping around, and Len thought it was was full on for 
“a bloke who larks around in a sandpit” (never change, Len).

Greg comes out with a big jump, and it’s a jive with great pace and 
personality (and bonus leapfrog). His feet turn in and his arms and 
shovel-hands are a mess, however - all a bit of shambles after a good start. 
Boo, but still love him and I reckon Nats can mould him into something fabulous.

And finally for tonight’s show, it’s Greg and Natalie! Their first dance is 
the Jive to ‘Get Ready’ by The Temptations. I’m disappointed that they didn’t 
pick ‘Jump’ by either Van Halen or The Pointer Sisters, such a wasted drinking 
opportunity. Still, a Jive in Week One is quite a big ask, so let’s see if Greg 
has moves (please have moves please have moves).

Len thought it took too long to get started - too much larking about. Bruno 
loved the cheeky spin, it was fresh and something he hadn’t seen before. Craig 
loved the storytelling, and it was dramatic and confident. Darcey thought it 
has ease and attack, and Ore kept his focus to the end.

So Ore is a nerd in a bad shirt, and this all takes a very long time to get 
going. But once they’re doing some actual Tango, it’s really not bad - a bit 
shuffly and lacking commitment from Ore in places, but a confident effort. Dear 
lord those beige trousers are tight.

Next up it’s Ore and Joanne! Tonight they’re dancing the Tango to ‘Geronimo’ 
by Sheppard. I’ve got no idea what this has to do with Ore, but it’s an 
absolute banger. A Tango in Week One is quite a big ask, but at least he can’t 
get voted out, so might as well get it out of the way early. If I’ve been in 
any way unclear on this matter previously, I’ve got a tiny crush on Ore and I’d 
appreciate it if he could not let me down please. Thanks.

So that’s it for the first live show! The other nine contestants are giving it 
full glitter and jazz hands at 6.30pm tomorrow, so join me then and we’ll do it 
all again (repeat every weekend until Christmas).


In the meantime you can find me on Twitter/Insta @heidistephens, or if you’re 
up early I’m on BBC5Live at 6.50am-ish tomorrow chatting all things Strictly. 
Thanks for joining in, it’s great to be back. See you tomorrow!
 
Scores: 6,7,7,7 - a total of 27 for Greg and Natalie, putting them joint top 
of the leaderboard. Inexplicable, but that’s why we love Strictly.

 
Bruno shouts a bit about Greg could go all the way - it didn’t have precision, 
but Greg gave it plenty of welly. Craig thought it was flat-footed and stompy 
and he was pigeon-toed, but he enjoyed it enormously. Darcey thought Greg 
looked like a blue frog jumping around, and Len thought it was was full on for 
“a bloke who larks around in a sandpit” (never change, Len).

 
Greg comes out with a big jump, and it’s a jive with great pace and 
personality (and bonus leapfrog). His feet turn in and his arms and 
shovel-hands are a mess, however - all a bit of shambles after a good start. 
Boo, but still love him and I reckon Nats can mould him into something fabulous.

 
And finally for tonight’s show, it’s Greg and Natalie! Their first dance is 
the Jive to ‘Get Ready’ by The Temptations. I’m disappointed that they didn’t 
pick ‘Jump’ by either Van Halen or The Pointer Sisters, such a wasted drinking 
opportunity. Still, a Jive in Week One is quite a big ask, so let’s see if Greg 
has moves (please have moves please have moves).
 
Scores: 7,7,6,7 - 27 for Ore and Joanne, puts them top of the leader board so 
far.

 
Len thought it took too long to get started - too much larking about. Bruno 
loved the cheeky spin, it was fresh and something he hadn’t seen before. Craig 
loved the storytelling, and it was dramatic and confident. Darcey thought it 
has ease and attack, and Ore kept his focus to the end.

 
So Ore is a nerd in a bad shirt, and this all takes a very long time to get 
going. But once they’re doing some actual Tango, it’s really not bad - a bit 
shuffly and lacking commitment from Ore in places, but a confident effort. Dear 
lord those beige trousers are tight.

 
Loving all the training footage in the VTs, by the way. Can we stick with this 
throughout this year instead of the comedy skits please? THANKS.


Ore’s already introduced us to his beautiful wife. Harrumph.

 
Next up it’s Ore and Joanne! Tonight they’re dancing the Tango to ‘Geronimo’ 
by Sheppard. I’ve got no idea what this has to do with Ore, but it’s an 
absolute banger. A Tango in Week One is quite a big ask, but at least he can’t 
get voted out, so might as well get it out of the way early. If I’ve been in 
any way unclear on this matter previously, I’ve got a tiny crush on Ore and I’d
