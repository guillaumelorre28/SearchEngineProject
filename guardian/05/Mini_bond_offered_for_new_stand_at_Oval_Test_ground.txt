Supporters of Surrey county cricket club who are looking for high returns on 
their savings are being made an interesting offer – although it’s not without 
risk. The club has launched a five-year fixed-rate “mini bond” paying 5.5%, 
with the money to be used to help build a new stand at the Oval, which plays 
host to the final Ashes Test next week.

The club has planning permission to build the 1,300 seat stand to be completed 
by September 2016. The mini bond aims to raise £3.5m of the £10m total cost. 
The rest of money is being raised conventionally, from loans and club funds.

The minimum investment is £2,000, but applicants need to be aware that mini 
bonds of this type are risky and there is no safety net from the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme if the worst happens. The bonds are not secured 
against the assets of the club, are not transferable, and they cannot be traded 
during the five years. Other mini bondshave collapsed and left investors

.

Meanwhile, buy-to-let lender Paragon Group has launched a similar bond paying 
6% until maturity on 28 August 2024. Minimum investment is £2,000 and the 
closing date is noon on 24 August. Like the Surrey bonds, this offer is not 
FSCS-protected.
