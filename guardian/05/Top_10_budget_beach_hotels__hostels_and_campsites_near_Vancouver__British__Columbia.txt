HI Jericho Beach, Vancouver

A whiff of military utilitarianism still permeates the basic private rooms of 
this converted 1930s air force barracks, 20 minutes from downtown Vancouver, 
set amongst the beachside blackberry bushes. But the imposing white HI Jericho 
Beach hostel also retains the convivial air that wafted around the 
decommissioned base when it was squatted by hippies and became the Cool Aid 
commune in 1970. After the "Battle of Jericho", in which the squatters were 
evicted, in 1971 it was converted into a 300-bed hostel, the largest in North 
America. Hippies, students and travellers still frequent the beach and a 
popular pursuit is sailing off into the sunset on a stand-up paddleboard; 
heading across English Bay towards the mountain-framed downtown peninsula.

Pacific Sands Beach Resort, Tofino
 Pacific Sands Beach Resort, Tofino, Canada 
Squirrelled away among storm-ravaged alder trees on the edge of Pacific Rim 
national park is the family-run Pacific Sands Beach Resort. When the Pettingers 
opened the hotel, on Vancouver Island's most westerly point, 40 years ago, it 
took six hours on dirt tracks to reach Cox Bay. Now a scenic three-hour drive 
brings you across from the Nanaimo ferry port. Comb the beach for "sand 
dollars" (white urchin shells) or take an all-weather surfing lesson. Epic 
winter waves rush into Cox Bay on to the doorstep of the luxurious 
beach-houses. Fully decked-out kitchens, cosy fireplaces and sexy hot tubs make 
them the perfect place to enjoy some storm-watching.

park. Your neighbours are likely to be black bears, swooping eagles, otters and 
sea lions. Crunch across the beach's blue carpet of mussel shells to explore 
the sea caves and spot the grey whales that migrate here every May until

Haida Gwaii Islands were the birthplace of distinctive Haida Gwaii First Nation
