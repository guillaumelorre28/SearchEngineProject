So that’s it for another Strictly week! Next week is the SEMI FINAL, when our 
dancers have to do TWO DANCES, so make sure you’re here for a 6.50pm kick-off. 
Thank you all for joining in with your very funny and wise commentary down 
below, it is much appreciated.


I’m off to the recording of the Strictly Christmas Special tomorrow night, so 
keep an eye on Twitter @heidistephens and I’ll try to post a picture of me 
giving Harry Judd a light squeeze. Otherwise I’ll see you next Saturday! 
Keeeeep dancing! Hx

So what will the judges do? Craig votes to keep Georgia and Giovanni (after 
having a moan about the public’s choices, YES THAT’S WHAT WE DO CRAIG), and 
Darcey does the same. Bruno saves Georgia and Giovanni too, which means Helen 
and Aljaz are going home. Len would have done likewise, and I think this was 
the right choice.

Heartfelt speeches all round, and Helen’s clinging on to Aljaz like a koala. 
Let him GO, Helen, retain your dignity. They dance their final dance to 
‘Tomorrow’ from Annie, and there’s that mute button again.

You’ve got to hand it to Helen, she’s giving this both barrels. I’d argue this 
is a better performance than last night, although there really isn’t much 
actual Paso in here, is there? But definitely less wobbly, Helen wants this BAD.

The good news is we get to enjoy another round of Beauty and The Beast, 
featuring dancing furniture and ornaments. So that’s something.

Just for info, I will be FOOMIN if the judges save Helen. FOOMIN.

Right let’s find out who’s safe, and who’s in the dance-off? Anita and Gleb 
are safe (yay!), along with…Katie and Anton!

Which means GEORGIA AND GIOVANNI in the dance-off! Goodness, didn’t see that 
coming, they were second on the leaderboard. The perils of going first, or 
everyone assuming they were safe and voting frantically for Anita and Gleb?


SURELY the judges will boot Helen and Aljaz?

So if it’s Anita and Gleb in the dance-off, I fear they’re going home (noooo). 
Maybe they’d be saved over Katie and Anton too, if Helen manages a wobble-free 
Paso. But if it’s anyone else, Helen and Aljaz could be toast. Who will it be?

Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Josh Groban singing Somewhere Over 
The Rainbow. I’ve never scurried for the mute button quite so quickly.

Craig finds it “shocking” that Helen and Aljaz are in the dance-off. They were 
second from bottom on the leaderboard, so not entirely shocking, is it?

TWO DANCES! DRINK!

So who is the first couple in this week’s dance-off, and who is safely through 
to the semi-final? Kellie and Kevin are safe (oh), along with Jay and Aliona 
(YES).


First couple in the dance-off: HELEN AND ALJAZ. Ooh, INTERESTING.

Last night on Strictly – a musical extravaganza that wasn’t as entirely awful 
as I was expecting, although it definitely had its moments. My highlights were 
Georgia and Giovanni’s Disney princess Foxtrot, Jay and Aliona’s gorgeous Rumba 
and Gleb dressed as a pornstar policeman (is it wrong to want them to be in the 
bottom two just a tiny bit so I can see that again?).


Lowlights were Helen and Aljaz’s too-much-going-on Paso, and Kellie and 
Kevin’s Viennese, mostly because I had “OOM PAH PAH OOM PAH PAH” stuck in my 
head for about five hours afterwards. I’m really hoping they’re not in the 
bottom two, just so I don’t have to experience that again.


If you were playing the drinking game, I’m sorry about the hats.

Tess and Claudia dress watch: Tess in a letter box (feel free to post your 
Christmas cards in her cleavage), Claudia in a studded shift and sensible 
ponytail. I’ve seen worse, 7/10.


Meanwhile Darcey is dressed in a 1960s lampshade, and looks like an Austin 
Powers extra.

Anyway, enough of that. We’re off! Tonight’s opening pro dance features the 
cast of the Lion King, doing a medley from the stage show. I’d be happy just to 
watch all the puppet animals, but they’ve also crammed in the pro dancers, who 
are dressed as garden peas.


I think we’ve reached peak busy dancefloor.

Casual Countryfile Weatherperson update: the lovely Sarah Keith-Lucas in 
sensible high-waisted jeans and a fuchsia top. Weather: another week of weirdly 
mild, blustery and soggy, unless you’re in Scotland, in which case BRRRRR.

So that’s it for another Strictly week! Next week is the SEMI FINAL, when our 
dancers have to do TWO DANCES, so make sure you’re here for a 6.50pm kick-off. 
Thank you all for joining in with your very funny and wise commentary down 
below, it is much appreciated.


I’m off to the recording of the Strictly Christmas Special tomorrow night, so 
keep an eye on Twitter @heidistephens and I’ll try to post a picture of me 
giving Harry Judd a light squeeze. Otherwise I’ll see you next Saturday! 
Keeeeep dancing! Hx
 
So what will the judges do? Craig votes to keep Georgia and Giovanni (after 
having a moan about the public’s choices, YES THAT’S WHAT WE DO CRAIG), and 
Darcey does the same. Bruno saves Georgia and Giovanni too, which means Helen 
and Aljaz are going home. Len would have done likewise, and I think this was 
the right choice.

Heartfelt speeches all round, and Helen’s clinging on to Aljaz like a koala. 
Let him GO, Helen, retain your dignity. They dance their final dance to 
‘Tomorrow’ from Annie, and there’s that mute button again.

 
You’ve got to hand it to Helen, she’s giving this both barrels. I’d argue this 
is a better performance than last night, although there really isn’t much 
actual Paso in here, is there? But definitely less wobbly, Helen wants this BAD.
 
This Foxtrot is still lovely, and making me all smiley. Hold it together 
Georgia, you can’t leave yet. Aww, that was gorgeous.
 
The good news is we get to enjoy another round of Beauty and The Beast, 
featuring dancing furniture and ornaments. So that’s something.

Just for info, I will be FOOMIN if the judges save Helen. FOOMIN.

 
Right let’s find out who’s safe, and who’s in the dance-off? Anita and Gleb 
are safe (yay!), along with…Katie and Anton!

Which means GEORGIA AND GIOVANNI in the dance-off! Goodness, didn’t see that 
coming, they were second on the leaderboard. The perils of going first, or 
everyone assuming they were safe and voting frantically for Anita and Gleb?


SURELY the judges will boot Helen and Aljaz?

 
So if it’s Anita and Gleb in the dance-off, I fear they’re going home (noooo). 
Maybe they’d be saved over Katie and Anton too, if Helen manages a wobble-free 
Paso. But if it’s anyone else, Helen and Aljaz could be toast. Who will it be?
 
Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Josh Groban singing Somewhere Over 
The Rainbow. I’ve never scurried for the mute button quite so quickly.
 
Craig finds it “shocking” that Helen and Aljaz are in the dance-off. They were 
second from bottom on the leaderboard, so not entirely shocking, is it?

TWO DANCES! DRINK!

 
So who is the first couple in this week’s dance-off, and who is safely through 
to the semi-final? Kellie and Kevin are safe (oh), along with Jay and Aliona 
(YES).


First couple in the dance-off: HELEN AND ALJAZ. Ooh, INTERESTING.

 
Last night on Strictly – a musical extravaganza that wasn’t as entirely awful 
as I was expecting, although it definitely had its moments. My highlights were 
Georgia and Giovanni’s Disney princess Foxtrot, Jay and Aliona’s gorgeous Rumba 
and Gleb dressed as a pornstar policeman (is it wrong to want them to be in the 
bottom two just a tiny bit so I can see that again?).


Lowlights were Helen and Aljaz’s too-much-going-on Paso, and Kellie and 
Kevin’s Viennese, mostly because I had “OOM PAH PAH OOM PAH PAH” stuck in my 
head for about five hours afterwards. I’m really hoping they’re not in the 
bottom two, just so I don’t have to experience that again.


If you were playing the drinking game, I’m sorry about the hats.

 
Tess and Claudia dress watch: Tess in a letter box (feel free to post your 
Christmas cards in her cleavage), Claudia in a studded shift and sensible 
ponytail. I’ve seen worse, 7/10.


Meanwhile Darcey is dressed in a 1960s lampshade, and looks like an Austin 
Powers extra.

 
Anyway, enough of that. We’re off! Tonight’s opening pro dance features the 
cast of the Lion King, doing a medley from the stage show. I’d be happy just to 
watch all the puppet animals, but they’ve also crammed in the pro dancers, who 
are dressed as garden peas.


I think we’ve reached peak busy dancefloor.
