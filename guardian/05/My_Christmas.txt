 Christmas Eve: once again the season of goodwill is upon us. I will be about 
six hours into an eight-hour shift, and the mood in the department will be 
generally happy and festive. However, the Christmas tree in the waiting room, 
decorated the last week, does not look particularly festive as someone has 
stolen all of its decorations again.
 The accident and emergency department is normally full of Christmas revellers 
who've been making merry in the various watering holes across the city. They 
are usually heavily decked with tinsel, mistletoe and alcohol.

 It's a little bit of a pain being here when everyone else seems to have been 
out celebrating, but we enjoy it all the same. Obviously, someone has to be on 
duty in case Santa gets stuck up the chimney and breaks his leg.

 Christmas Day: I will be back in the department again by 7.30am. As tradition 
has it, bacon sandwiches are consumed and Christmas gifts are exchanged.

 There are many children here over Christmas, and though unwell, they will all 
be clutching their newly-opened gifts. They always receive an extra surprise 
left by Santa in the department the night before.

 Christmas in emergency is often a mixture of laughter and sadness. One 
elderly lady who is usually alone at Christmas said she had had the best 
Christmas she ever had with us, as she had met so many new people and had 
sampled all the delicacies we had brought into work.

 The afternoon brings a steady stream of children injured on their new 
bicycles and roller blades, and a number of people with what we call 'turkey 
related injuries'- cut fingers, fat burns, and indigestion manifesting itself 
in many ways. By 4pm I'll be home myself, eating lunch and drinking wine.
