All hail the age of austerity. Even if that doesn’t extend to the expensive 
devices we carry in our pockets. But smartphones can save you money, if you let 
them.

Apps <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apps> comparing the prices of 
meals, plane tickets, insurance and more are well established on the app stores 
now, as are apps with more specific methods of saving you a few pounds.

Here are 10 apps that should help leave your wallet feeling a little fatter at 
the end of the month.

can use it to add products you need to buy throughout the week, then tick them 
off as you walk through the aisles. But the app also keeps tabs on prices at 
the various UK supermarkets, helping you compare prices and see new deals as 
they go live.

 Minicabit. 
Do cab-hailing apps like Uber save you money? Sometimes, although not when the 
infamous “surge” pricing is in effect. Minicabit takes a different approach: 
it’s a comparison app for taxi and mini-cab companies across the UK, getting 
you to tap in details of your trip, then browse quotes from various local 
firms. It currently works in 40 UK cities.

Computers rather than smartphones may be the preferred way to research car 
insurance prices. MoneySuperMarket’s MoreMoney app is hoping to tempt a few
