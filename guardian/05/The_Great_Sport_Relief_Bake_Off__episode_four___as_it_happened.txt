So that’s IT for Sport Relief Bake Off 2016 – it’s been a blast as ever, so 
thank you to everyone who has popped by for a read, or to be very funny and 
clever in the comment box – I’m on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say 
hello.


I’ll be back in the summer to liveblog the main GBBO series, but in the 
meantime don’t forget it’sEurovision: You Decide on Friday (BBC4 7.30pm), where 
we’ll exercise our democratic right to choose which lamb we send to the 
Stockholm Euro-slaughter on 14th May. Will be fun, so please come and join in 
with the liveblog. Cheers, Hx

So who will win the Star Baker apron? Probably should be Morgana, but could be 
Ade on the basis of that Showstopper.


And this week’s Star Baker is…ADE! He looks really quite chuffed. Poor 
Morgana, should have done an Impressionist Elvis. I’m not sure Will’s hands 
will ever be a normal colour again.

Time for the judges’ verdicts on tonight’s Showstoppers. Will’s is a bit of a 
mess, and a bit simplistic. This is a polite way of saying “what a shambles”. 
The cakes are a bit dry, and his tomato soup pancakes are completely raw. 
Alison’s hot water bottle looks lovely, but the cupcakes are a bit 
close-textured. Morgana’s Julie face looks great, and the cupcakes are 
beautifully baked.


Ade’s Cubist artwork of Cliff Richard is AMAZING. They all have a good flavour 
too, but who cares? He’s made Cliff Richard out of CAKE.

Will’s cake is starting to look like a crime scene. Ade is mounting his cakes 
on pegs, so they stand horizontal. How fancy is that?

Ade is worried that it’s not as stiff as when he’s at home, and he’s worried 
about it dripping off. Leave it, Heidi.

Icing time! Morgana has iced some rather fabulous orange hair, and Will 
appears to be shovelling it on like plaster. Alison’s fox has crumbled, and 
she’s stressing out. Wait, where does a fox fit in to a cat hot water bottle?

Will can’t work out how to lay out the cakes to do the icing, suggesting he’s 
never actually done it before. Alison’s fondant hot water bottle looks quite 
tidy, but Will’s tomato-coloured icing looks more like fishpaste.

Ade’s cupcakes are all in neon shades, but Morgana’s are a bit flat. Never 
mind Morgana, you had a lovely set in the first challenge.

Morgana is worried about the judges’ lack of enthusiasm for coconut, so she’s 
changed the recipe to include lime. Will is chopping apples, and admitting he 
has no idea what he’s doing. I think we already knew that, Will.

Will’s tomato soup cupcakes have been in the oven for forty minutes, and still 
aren’t cooked. Basically he’s creating a tomato soup reduction in cupcake 
moulds.

Will is making three different cupcake flavours to recreate his biggest 
achievement – growing tomatoes last year. Not beating Gareth Gates to win Pop 
Idol, having four number one albums, winning various awards…but growing 
tomatoes. I’m not sure I could love Will more.

Morgana is making the face of Julie from House of Fools, the TV show she did 
with Vic and Bob. It’s quite coconut heavy, and Paul is worried they might 
taste like sun cream. At least there’s no dill.

Nuts in May. Okaaaay then.

So the first part of this is making lots of cupcakes. Will’s cupcakes contain 
tomato soup, which sounds hideous.

Morgana takes the win. Her lipstick is immaculate, I need to know where she 
gets it.

Judging time! Morgana’s looks immaculate, and has perfect spirals. Tastes 
great too - pretty much perfect from Morgana. Will’s is soaked through with 
spinach - Paul describes it as “smoked salmon wrapped around a flannel”, which 
is harsh (but fair). Ade has too much filling, but the flavour is good. 
Alison’s filling is uneven, but good flavour again. Still looks vile.

Time to put the salmon and cream cheese mix on the cooked base and roll it up. 
Alison’s seems to be rolling quite well, as does Ade’s. Will’s is a bit flat, 
but Morgana’s looks lovely.

So that’s IT for Sport Relief Bake Off 2016 – it’s been a blast as ever, so 
thank you to everyone who has popped by for a read, or to be very funny and 
clever in the comment box – I’m on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say 
hello.


I’ll be back in the summer to liveblog the main GBBO series, but in the 
meantime don’t forget it’sEurovision: You Decide on Friday (BBC4 7.30pm), where 
we’ll exercise our democratic right to choose which lamb we send to the 
Stockholm Euro-slaughter on 14th May. Will be fun, so please come and join in 
with the liveblog. Cheers, Hx

 
So who will win the Star Baker apron? Probably should be Morgana, but could be 
Ade on the basis of that Showstopper.


And this week’s Star Baker is…ADE! He looks really quite chuffed. Poor 
Morgana, should have done an Impressionist Elvis. I’m not sure Will’s hands 
will ever be a normal colour again.

 
Time for the judges’ verdicts on tonight’s Showstoppers. Will’s is a bit of a 
mess, and a bit simplistic. This is a polite way of saying “what a shambles”. 
The cakes are a bit dry, and his tomato soup pancakes are completely raw. 
Alison’s hot water bottle looks lovely, but the cupcakes are a bit 
close-textured. Morgana’s Julie face looks great, and the cupcakes are 
beautifully baked.


Ade’s Cubist artwork of Cliff Richard is AMAZING. They all have a good flavour 
too, but who cares? He’s made Cliff Richard out of CAKE.
 
Will’s cake is starting to look like a crime scene. Ade is mounting his cakes 
on pegs, so they stand horizontal. How fancy is that?
 
Ade is worried that it’s not as stiff as when he’s at home, and he’s worried 
about it dripping off. Leave it, Heidi.

Icing time! Morgana has iced some rather fabulous orange hair, and Will 
appears to be shovelling it on like plaster. Alison’s fox has crumbled, and 
she’s stressing out. Wait, where does a fox fit in to a cat hot water bottle?

 
Will can’t work out how to lay out the cakes to do the icing, suggesting he’s 
never actually done it before. Alison’s fondant hot water bottle looks quite 
tidy, but Will’s tomato-coloured icing looks more like fishpaste.
 
Ade’s cupcakes are all in neon shades, but Morgana’s are a bit flat. Never 
mind Morgana, you had a lovely set in the first challenge.
 
Morgana is worried about the judges’ lack of enthusiasm for coconut, so she’s 
changed the recipe to include lime. Will is chopping apples, and admitting he 
has no idea what he’s doing. I think we already knew that, Will.
 
Will’s tomato soup cupcakes have been in the oven for forty minutes, and still 
aren’t cooked. Basically he’s creating a tomato soup reduction in cupcake 
moulds.
 
Will is making three different cupcake flavours to recreate his biggest 
achievement – growing tomatoes last year. Not beating Gareth Gates to win Pop 
Idol, having four number one albums, winning various awards…but growing 
tomatoes. I’m not sure I could love Will more.
 
Morgana is making the face of Julie from House of Fools, the TV show she did 
with Vic and Bob. It’s quite coconut heavy, and Paul is worried they might 
taste like sun cream. At least there’s no dill.

 
Ade is making seven different cupcake flavours, whilst Alison is only making 
one. She’s recreating a cat hot water bottle from a TV show she did in the 70s, 
Nuts in May. Okaaaay then.
 
Ade is making a Cubist cupcake model of Cliff Richard, to celebrate their 
Comic Relief version of Living Doll from the 1980s. You had to be there, 
really. Ask your mum.
 
So the first part of this is making lots of cupcakes. Will’s cupcakes contain 
tomato soup, which sounds hideous.
 
And finally, it’s time for this week’s Showstopper Challenge! Tonight they 
have to create a momentous life achievement out of cupcakes.


For the record, mine would be giving birth to my first child, rendered through 
the medium of tiny iced sponges. Mmm, yummy.

 
In fourth place - Will’s salmon flannel. Ade gets third, Alison second, and 
Morgana takes the win. Her lipstick is immaculate, I need to know where she 
gets it.

 
Judging time! Morgana’s looks immaculate, and has perfect spirals. Tastes 
great too - pretty much perfect from Morgana. Will’s is soaked through with 
spinach - Paul describes it as “smoked salmon wrapped around a flannel”, which 
is harsh (but fair). Ade has too much filling, but the flavour is good. 
Alison’s filling is uneven, but good flavour again. Still looks vile.

Alison’s seems to be rolling quite well, as does Ade’s. Will’s is a bit flat, 
but Morgana’s looks lovely.
