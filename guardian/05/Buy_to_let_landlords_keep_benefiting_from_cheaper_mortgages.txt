Buy-to-let landlords are continuing to benefit from falling mortgage rates, 
according to new data, despite policymakers saying they are keeping a close eye 
on the fast-growing sector.

Data from finance website Moneyfacts shows that the average rate on a two-year 
fixed rate buy-to-let (BTL) mortgage has fallen from 5.21% in 2011 to 3.32% 
now, and rates on five-year fixed rates are down from 6.24% from 4% over the 
same period.

“Savings rates are currently so poor that many are looking elsewhere to fund 
their retirement, so lenders have tried to capitalise on this new pool of cash 
by offering some of the best rates the BTL sector has ever seen,” said 
Charlotte Nelson, finance expert at Moneyfacts.

The Bank of England announced last month it was setting out a number of 
measures

 to combat risks to the financial system from the buy-to-let sector, which 
included assessing the borrower’s costs associated with letting the property 
and the impact of future interest rate increases in affordability assessments.

It announced the measures after data for January showed the number of loans 
granted to would-be landlords increased 22%

. The increase in borrowing was said to be fuelled bychanges to stamp duty

 which were announced in November to come into force this month. Anyone buying 
a home that is not their main residence must now pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge.
