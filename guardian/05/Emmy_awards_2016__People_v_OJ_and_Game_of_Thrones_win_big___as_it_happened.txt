That was ... something. While I thoroughly enjoyed Jimmy Kimmel’s laconic, 
snarky performance as host, this year’sEmmys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/emmys> lacked surprise, controversy, 
or much to talk about. It was a by the book awards show, plodding along from 
category to category, rewarding many of the same people from years past. Even 
new winners like Rami Malek, who won best actor in a drama series for Mr Robot, 
had a whiff of the expected. Besides the typically elaborate, expensive set 
design, there wasn’t much that was grand about this show. Oh, and did I mention 
John Mayer?

Did The Americans and Mr Robot have better seasons than the sixth season of 
Game of Thrones? Sure. ButGame of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> is still one of the 
most excellent programs around with sky-high production values and a galaxy of 
great characters. Should we be upset about it’s win? Of course not. And if you 
are, Khaleesi is coming for you.

With this win it now has the most awards ever. Is that correct? Maybe, maybe 
not. But there’s no going back now.

Good job, Veep, you deserve it. But can’t we make a rule about comedy shows 
not being able to win two years in a row, because Blackish, Unbreakable Kimmy 
Schmidt, and Master of None really deserve a chance at the big award.

HOLY COW! It’s taken four years for Tatiana Maslany to go from constant Emmy 
snub to winning the award. Like Keri Russell she plays a number of different 
characters on the same show, but unlike Russell her variety of accents and 
personalities are constantly shifting. She sometimes has to play one of her 
clones pretending to be another one of her clones. It’s a mind-bendingly 
amazing performance. Too bad the show hasn’t been that great the past few 
seasons.

Lanre Bakare writes our news story on the night from Los Angeles:

Winter might be coming for the residents of Westeros but for the creators of 
Game of Thrones <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> and 
HBO it was clear skies again at the Emmys, where the series won the best drama 
series award for the second year in a row.

That was ... something. While I thoroughly enjoyed Jimmy Kimmel’s laconic, 
snarky performance as host, this year’sEmmys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/emmys> lacked surprise, controversy, 
or much to talk about. It was a by the book awards show, plodding along from 
category to category, rewarding many of the same people from years past. Even 
new winners like Rami Malek, who won best actor in a drama series for Mr Robot, 
had a whiff of the expected. Besides the typically elaborate, expensive set 
design, there wasn’t much that was grand about this show. Oh, and did I mention 
John Mayer?
 
Did The Americans and Mr Robot have better seasons than the sixth season of 
Game of Thrones? Sure. ButGame of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> is still one of the 
most excellent programs around with sky-high production values and a galaxy of 
great characters. Should we be upset about it’s win? Of course not. And if you 
are, Khaleesi is coming for you.

With this win it now has the most awards ever. Is that correct? Maybe, maybe 
not. But there’s no going back now.
 
The HBO drama wins for the second year in a row.
