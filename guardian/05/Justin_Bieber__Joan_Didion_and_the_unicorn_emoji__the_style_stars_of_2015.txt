Having style is about using how you look to say something about yourself. 
Being a style leader, however – that’s more than that. When the way you look 
not only says something about you, but also engages with or captures something 
about the world around you: boom. You’re in.

Our style stars of 2015 make for an eclectic list. They range from a coolly 
highbrow writer (Joan Didion) to a hot-tempered pop puppy (Justin Bieber.) They 
represent television, music, politics, cooking – and, of course, what’s on our 
phones. What they don’t represent, this year, is any easily digestible gloss or 
glamour.

Looking at the people we were obsessed with this year, it becomes clear that 
straight-shooting good looks, in the sense of symmetry and polish and pin-sharp 
presentation, has not been what this year was about. This is seen most clearly 
when we look at 2015 as a reaction to the year before. In 2014, we gorged 
ourselves on photos of Amal Clooney getting married, and the Duchess of 
Cambridge on overseas duty. As visions of immaculate polish, blow-dried and 
coordinated, they were fantasy creatures made flesh and, therefore, compelling 
for a while. But the look of 2015 is altogether wilder, less easily 
categorised. This could be simply because we are tired of bland perfection, or 
could represent something about how incongruous a nattily coordinated pastel 
wardrobe now looks, when you pan the lens back to include the world around us 
in the picture.

There are no men slaying the style critics with their tailoring and cufflinks, 
right now: instead, the men who capture the public imagination, from Greek 
finance minister Yanis Varoufakis toBen Whishaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ben-whishaw> as Danny in London Spy, are 
defiantly without the conventional trappings of male power.

If fashion does reflect the world we live in, perhaps the way that style has 
atomised this year says something about the fractured, confusing world picture. 
It’s an interesting list for anyone who thinks gender fluidity is a key issue 
of our times only in some abstract, theoretical way. Note that the only name on 
the list whose image channels traditional, mainstream femininity is that of 
Caitlyn Jenner. Both the young men we have included – Bieber, 21, and Zayn 
Malik, 22 – have reinvented themselves by bleaching their hair blond. The 
platinum move is traditionally a female move, not a male one; the times, they 
are a’ changing. Meanwhile, both Cookie Lyon and Chanel Oberlin are women who 
use fashion as warpaint, not ornament. (Our style icons are, unwittingly, 
testament to the continuing power of television to set the agenda.) And the 
unicorn? Well,emojis are the visual shorthand of now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/17/crying-with-laughter-how-we-learned-how-to-speak-emoji>
, to the point where they have, arguably, taken on a life of their own. The 
dancing lady had her moment, but is now a bit party-season-2014; the 
crying-with-laughter face was deemed word of the year. A unicorn emoji in a 
blue speech bubble is the crest of arms of 2015. And if that doesn’t make it an 
icon, what does?Jess Cartner-Morley

 Caitlyn Jenner: cover star of the year. Photograph: Annie Liebovitz/Courtesy 
of Vanity Fair 
Vanity Fair’s “Call me Caitlyn” shoot with Annie Leibovitz made Caitlyn Jenner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/caitlyn-jenner> the cover girl of the 
year, by a country mile. The power and reach of one simple portrait, in ivory 
silk underwear, was a masterclass in the ability of image to define identity. 
(It showed, also, how bare skin can read as brave, rather than brazen.) That 
first shoot drew on the iconography of Marilyn Monroe in the pearly gleam of 
that curvy, old-fashioned underwear on the cover, and in the liquid-gold sequin 
evening dress Jenner wore in another shot. In public appearances since then, 
Jenner’s best looks have channelled the woman she acknowledges as her fashion 
icon, Angelina Jolie. Versace and Moschino gowns with deep V-necklines and 
long, slim sleeves radiate a poised, confident glamour.JCM

autumn with a new Draco Malfoy, bleach-blond, shaved-sided look. He has 
borrowed from the Kanye camp a wardrobe of oversized, neutral-toned layers that

The cover of Gloria Steinem’s new memoir, My Life on the Road, features the 
author in her most iconic 70s era: centre-parted hair, high-waisted jeans, 
soulful half-smile. And by serendipity, the first-wave-feminist chic she 
personified – a dark turtleneck, a pair of slightly awkward trousers – was a 
touchstone for fashion this year. (See: the Chanel spring/summer 2015 fashion 
show, staged as a faux-feminist protest.) At 81, key elements of Steinem’s 
image remain constant, notably the pale streaks of hair that frame her face. 
She borrowed this detail,she has said 
<http://www.teenvogue.com/story/gloria-steinem-hbo-documentary>, from Audrey 
Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, “the first Hollywood film in which a woman 
was allowed to be sexual and not to be punished”. The details of Steinem’s 
wardrobe have altered – she has swapped the high necklines for a softer scoop 
neck on the book tour – but she remains a highly identifiable icon.JCM

 Muscle Ts: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Photograph: Nikos Pilos 
for the Observer 
It is so rare that male politicians give style commentators anything other 
than a new hairdo to deconstruct. What joy then when Varoufakis, the then Greek 
finance minister, rocked up outside No 10 wearing a leather jacket he’d 
apparently borrowed from Shaun Ryder’s “It’s great when you’re straight ... 
yeah” years. The bad boy of anti-capitalism has form when it comes to dressing 
against convention, indeed his peers have made fond reference to his loud 
shirts and muscle Ts in parliament. To quote the Greek prime minister Alexis 
Tsipras: “You can blame him as much as you want for his political plan, for his 
statements, for his taste in shirts ... but you cannot accuse him of stealing 
the money of Greek people.” Tantalisingly, although he has cited Monty Python 
as an important political influence, Varoufakis declined to admit who has 
influenced his sartorial swagger. But whether it was indeed Ryder or Grant 
Mitchell, the economist undoubtedly knows how to let his clothes have their say 
in the workplace. Respect.Imogen Fox

Forget working out who the serial killer is. The real drama in dark sorority 
comedy Scream Queens takes place in evil queen bee Chanel Oberlin’s glossy 
white wardrobe. The cavernous space brims with ambition and entitlement – it 
looks a lot like Coco Chanel’s apartment on Rue Cambon – and its staircase and 
central department-store-style countertop are the perfect podiums from which to 
terrify minions. It is also bursting with gob-smacking clothes. In fact, it 
would be easy to write a PhD onOberlin’s style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/07/scream-queens-alpha-fashion-at-its-most-evil>
, but instead here’s the digested read: note the fluff, the pastels, the 
withering stares, the foot stamping, and follow accordingly. Oberlin’s 
obnoxious approach to life is reflected in her obnoxious approach to fashion – 
she destroys her clothes rather than giving them to charity, for example, 
because “there is something so depressing about a poor person walking around in 
couture.” Her standout ensemble – dressed up as Jackie Kennedy inthat fake 
Chanel pink suit for Chanel-oween (yes, this is her own version of Halloween) – 
will provide ample inspiration for October 2016.Lauren Cochrane

 Excellent work with hair: Whishaw as Danny in London Spy. Photograph: BBC/WTTV 
Limited 
Take away the chem sex and espionage and London Spy is all about the jeans, 
really, isn’t it? Ben Whishaw, as lead character Danny, gets involved in all 
sorts in the BBC drama but his jeans remain the constant, a beacon of hope. 
Just slouchy enough, just worn enough, just the right length to sit on his 
white trainers, and just the colour to contrast with a smart navy pea coat. All 
that and I haven’t even started on the ribbed mustard jumper, theflip phone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/10/from-rihanna-to-london-spy-how-flip-phones-were-called-back-into-fashion>
 and Whishaw’s excellent work with hair. This, basically, is a lesson in how 
all men should dress now. It’s also deceptively simple, on the surface, 
although – like the unsettling glass of peel-top wine that confirms all is not 
what it seems when Danny visits Alex’s parents – every look is imbued with 
meaning. As Whishaw is warned by his only ally, Scottie, the forces he is up 
against “look at the cut of your suit before they listen to what you say. It’s 
not about wealth; it’s about a set of signals. They require a lifetime of study 
which is precisely the point.”LC

When Joan Didion was unveiled as a Céline model 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/12/celine-joan-didion-literary-hero-fashion-advertisement>
 in January 2015, a few fashion insiders might have had to Google her name. 
They would have found the cult of Joan dedicated toher laidback Californian look
 
<http://thesalonnieresapartments.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Joan-Didion-Cigarette.jpg>
 that mostly invoked ribbed T-shirts, loose hair and smoking – an aesthetic and 
attitude that pinpoints everything fashion aspires to right now, as famously 
illustrated by hersparse packing list 
<http://www.vogue.com/866060/joan-didion-the-white-album-packing-list/>. 
Céline’s Phoebe Philo putting the grown-up 81-year-old Didion in her campaign, 
in pictures taken by Juergen Teller, was inspired. Didion’s “I’ve seen it all” 
interior eyeroll plus black poloneck, statement necklace and floral sofa were 
appropriately concise, a Miranda Priestley-esque“that’s all” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3a5BsmxNJ0> to fashion. Possibly this 
backfired. To Didion’s exasperation, it only left us wanting more.LC

 New fashion force: Zayn Malik. Photograph: Dominique Charriau/Getty Images 
Remember when Robbie Williams left Take That, his dissent expressed through 
Adidas stripes and blond hair that looked as though it had been dyed in a tour 
bus sink? This year, Zayn Malik has demonstrated what boy band rebellion looks 
like now – and it’s a lot more knowing and glossy. This was the year that Malik 
became a fashion force to be reckoned with, bringing his soulful stare to the 
front row of all the best menswear shows and treating fans to a masterclass in 
high-low fashion – fromembellished Louis Vuitton bomber jackets

. Really, though, it has been his hair’s year, whether Grade 2 and platinum or 
quiffed and grey. Rarely has a style icon emerged so decisively.Hannah Marriott

 Fashion as punchline: Taraji P Henson as Cookie Lyon in Empire. Photograph:

As Joan Collins auctions off her collection of gargantuan shoulder pads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/13/joan-collins-auction-warren-beatty-love-letters-power-suits>
, it is fitting to celebrate the only true successor Alexis Carrington has ever 
had: Cookie Lyon, matriarch of music-industry drama Empire, a woman who dazzles 
her detractors with diamante and triple leopardprint. When we meet Cookie, she 
is emerging from prison in fur coat, mini dress and violently scraped-back 
ponytail, a look that had clearly been conceived when Destiny’s Child were 
still a four-piece. In those first first few post-incarceration episodes, it’s 
all Mary J Blige hats and French Connection frocks; obviously she has not yet 
had time to go shopping. But like all the best fictional heroes, Cookie has a 
special gift – she is easily the best music producer in town – and her wardrobe 
flourishes as her power and talent become increasingly apparent.

By season two, it’s head-to-toe Oscar de la Renta, Versace, Maison Margiela 
and Moschino. Not only does Cookie never wear the same outfit twice, she racks 
up about seven different looks an episode, and yet she never peaks. Every 
outfit is more, more, more – an explosion of bodycon, high heels and nail art. 
All this and Empire is more than spectacular fashion porn – it uses style as a 
prop and a punchline in a way not seen since Sex and the City. God forbid you 
wear cheap shoes or a bad weave around Cookie Lyon. Like hip-hop’s answer to 
Joan Rivers, she will make sure you regret it.HM

The irony of fashion drawing inspiration from a cake isn’t lost on us, but it 
is precisely this comic-ness that makes pink and yellow 2015’s funnest trend. 
Some went separate (things were pink at autumn/winter Marni and Prabal Gurung 
and sugary yellow at Dries van Noten and Topshop Unique); others paired them up 
(see Jonathan Saunder’s ombre coat, a hero piece of the season). The year’s 
multicoloured hair trend, too, has its origins in confection (at Gucci,Linn 
Arvidsson’s hair faded from blonde to Pepto-Bismol 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/gucci/slideshow/collection#22%E2%80%99s>
). Plus, unlike most trends, this one rolled over from spring/summer to 
autumn/winter, like 2015’s answer to monochrome. Why does it work? Paired 
together, pink and yellow are easy on the eye, a relaxing, whimsical colour 
combination. See a blonde Gwyneth Paltrow in pink Ralph & Russo Couture at the 
Oscars and try not to think about cake. The marzipan element? Well, no, it’s 
not for everyone.Morwenna Ferrier

Unicorn emoji
 The most fashion-appropriate of all emojis. Photograph: Screengrab 
The unicorn emoji is, perhaps, the most fashion-appropriate of all emojis – 
and the others have had a good go. Two reasons, really. One, the iridescent 
pink-and-blue mishmash which preceded Pantone’s colour of 2016; two, its roots 
are in chaos magic, the trend created by the same forecasters who came up with 
Normcore. Chaos magic never quite happened (the concept of wearing something 
because it was “imbued with meaning” is a bit arch), but the idea of magic? 
Well, that’s a different story. Forever 21 stuck them on sunglasses, Chanel 
borrowed the palette for its iridescent prints on the spring/summer catwalk and 
the models at Maison Margiela were painted to look like unicorns. We’d hazard 
unicorns weren’t actually on makeup artist Pat McGrath’s original moodboard, 
but the results are uncanny.MF
