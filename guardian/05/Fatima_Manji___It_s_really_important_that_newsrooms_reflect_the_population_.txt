A correspondent on Channel 4 News since 2012, in March Fatima Manji became 
Britain’s first (and only) hijab-wearing newsreader on national television. 
Born in Peterborough, she studied history and politics at London School of 
Economics, before being accepted on a BBC trainee scheme. In July, she made 
headlines around the world when Kelvin MacKenzie wrote a column in theSun 
questioning whether it was appropriate that she presented coverage on the 
evening of the terrorist attack in Nice.

When Kelvin MacKenzie wrote his column 
<https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1459893/why-did-channel-4-have-a-presenter-in-a-hijab-to-front-coverage-of-muslim-terror-in-nice/>
 in theSun, was it strange to be embroiled in something you couldn’t have seen 
coming?
If you say or do something controversial, you expect a backlash, but purely 
for just doing your job on the day… and it was just another day. Yes, it was a 
horrific, tragic, awful story, but it was another day of news. To go from that 
to, a few days on, suddenly being splashed all over the place, yes, that was 
surreal.

Your response – written in the Liverpool Echo 
<http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/fatima-manji-truth-kelvin-mackenzies-11635404>
 – was very strong and combative. Did you consider not saying anything back?
For me to stay silent just wasn’t an option. When I first saw his column, I 
had a nervous laugh, disbelief reaction. I thought, “Well, I’m not going to 
respond to that, that’s just crazy.” But as it unfolded and it already had a 
life of its own, I had to say something. And I had to react to it with strength 
rather than be a victim. So even though I was worried about my safety, even 
though it was incredibly upsetting, I felt the reaction had to be, “Hey, you 
don’t get to say that!” And, “I am Britain, get used to me.”

As a minority, you're more exposed to politics because you’re having to 
understand why you look different

Are you pleased you did?
You know, it meant an awful lot to people that I reacted in that way. I had so 
many people contact me, some of whom had been victims of Islamophobia or racism 
or bigotry of some kind. And they said, “It felt like someone was throwing a 
punch back.” That’s what it stood for.

The press regulator decided MacKenzie was entitled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/oct/19/kelvin-mackenzie-entitled-to-attack-fatima-manji-over-hijab-says-ipso>
 to criticiseChannel 4 News. Do you feel it’s over now?
I was very clear about my reaction, both to what happened and subsequently to 
losing the complaint. Now I just say I refuse to be defined by the ramblings 
and bigotry of an irrelevant dinosaur. That’s how I feel about it.

Muslims are under-represented as journalists in the UK – although they are 
almost 5% of the population, they make up just 0.4% of the media. Why does that 
matter?
Actually all religious groups are under-represented: Muslims, Christians, 
Sikhs, Hindus. It matters because it’s really important that newsrooms reflect 
the populations they serve. That’s not just a catchphrase, not just because we 
want to look like some Benetton ad. It’s because it allows you to be in touch 
with the different communities and to say, “I know someone who’s experiencing 
that.” It allows us to be better journalists – that’s why it’s important.

What did you make of the recent decision of the culture secretary to block the 
appointment of a black woman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/29/bme-woman-blocked-from-channel-4-board-as-four-white-men-join>
 to the all-white, mostly male Channel 4 board?
Let me think about this one… All I’d say is, I find it surprising. I don’t 
know any of the characters, but it seems to me from the profile of the woman 
who was apparently to be appointed that she was highly qualified so, yeah, we 
need some answers.

Well hedged. Why did you become a journalist?
I often say I made a really informed career decision at the age of eight. I 
wanted to be where history is made, I wanted to be in the centre of things. I’m 
also very nosy, I love asking questions. Maybe I just didn’t know the reality 
of news, maybe I thought it was glamorous. No one told me I’d be standing in a 
muddy field talking about floods, in waders. Maybe if they had, I’d have 
rethought.

Eight is very precocious. You grew up in Peterborough – was yours a very 
politically engaged family?
Yeah, I have very early memories of reading broadsheets when they seemed 
really massive, and that statement in itself now feels so dated. When you’re a 
minority in a country, you are inevitably more exposed to politics because 
you’re having to understand why you look different and why you do certain 
things differently. Or why someone’s calling you a Paki, quite honestly.

I’m really amused when things happen in politics that could be scripts, like 
“trousergate”

After university, your first jobs were in local radio and regional TV. What 
was the silliest story you had to report on?
I remember one time when I walked into the newsroom at BBC Look East and my 
colleague told me I had to cover a story about police horses shitting 
everywhere and causing chaos in a village. And I just lost it and said, “I’m 
not doing horseshit!” It was actually a windup – even though the story was real 
– and they kept it going for an hour, just to see me more and more seething.

What do you like doing outside of work? 

I’m obsessed with museums. I hate the idea of being ahistorical and they are a 
wonderful reminder of how things came about. I spend a lot of time at the V&A 
in London – especially the south-east Asia and Middle East sections – because 
it really brings home to you the idea of empire and how connected it was to 
Britain. Sometimes when we talk about immigration or change in Britain, we act 
as if it’s something new. There’s this false idea that there’s a perfect 
Englishman and a perfect Englishwoman, which is just not true.

That still sounds a little worky. What’s relaxation for you?
[Laughs] Apart from hanging round in museums? I’ll binge-watch comedies. I 
can’t get enough ofFriday Night Dinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/friday-night-dinner> and I constantly 
rewatchThe Thick of It 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-thick-of-it> and quote lines from 
it. I’m really amused when I find things happening in politics that could be 
scripts, like“trousergate” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/11/theresa-may-trousers-row-angry-text-exchange-nicky-morgan>
.

There’s a lot of commentary on social media about how you dress. Does that 
bother you?
For me it’s less about what people think than how happy I am with the outfit. 
At the moment, I’m excited by jumpsuits and dungarees. That sounds weird. But 
yes, sometimes people come out with all kinds of mad things, some of which are 
amusing, some of which are racist. There’s a fixation with my headgear, 
obviously, which I find tiring. Not just about me, but I’m so bored of media 
depictions of women in headscarves. It’s either, “Oh, look at this terribly 
oppressed woman”, or, “Oh, how exciting, woman in headscarf can play football!” 
Let’s just get over it.

Many people will have found some of the big news stories this year a bit grim. 
Does it ever get you down?
I wouldn’t say that. It’s confusing and it’s unknown and it’s obviously a time 
of massive change, which is inevitably scary. It could be the beginning of 
great things and it could be the beginning of terrible things. News-wise it’s 
been nonstop, which has been thrilling but also tiring. I’m looking forward to 
a few days off and some time to reflect on things over Christmas. I’m presenting
Channel 4 Newson Christmas Eve and then I have a couple of days off, so I’m 
really looking forward to just calm.
