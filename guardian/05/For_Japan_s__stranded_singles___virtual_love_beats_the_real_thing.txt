Japan’s apparently waning interest in true love is creating not just a 
marriage crisis but a relationship crisis, leading young people to forgo 
finding a partner and resort to falling for fictional characters in online and 
video games.

New figures show that more than 70% of unmarried Japanese men and 75% of women 
have never had any sexual experience by the time they reach 20, though that 
drops to almost 50% for each gender by the time they reach 25.

According to Professor Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist at Chuo University in 
Tokyo, who has coined the phrase “stranded singles” for the phenomenon, the 
rise in virginity rates is matched by a rise in the lack of interest in having 
any kind of “real” relationship.

Recent research by the Japanese government showed that about 30% of single 
women and 15% of single men aged between 20 and 29 admitted to having fallen in 
love with a meme or character in a game – higher than the 24% of those women 
and 11% of men who admitted to falling in love with a pop star or actor.

The development of the multimillion-pound virtual romance industry in Japan 
reflects the existence of a growing number of people who don’t have a real-life 
partner, said Yamada. There is even a slang term, “moe”, for those who fall in 
love with fictional computer characters, while dating sims allow users to 
adjust the mood and character of online partners and are aimed at women as much 
as men. A whole subculture, including hotel rooms where a guest can take their 
console partner for a romantic break, has been springing up inJapan

But Yamada says this is only a small part of the problem, which has its roots 
in traditional culture. Young people want conventional marriage and will wait 
for it. They don’t want to cohabit or have children outside marriage – Japan 
has the lowest rate of babies born outside marriage in the world at 2.2%, 
compared with Britain’s 47%.

Yamada labels as the “parasitics” those young people forced for economic 
reasons to live at home with their parents, and says that the phenomenon 
explains this year’s population fall in Japan as the birthrate drops. “Children 
are not likely to be born if men and women fail to bond in couples. Not just 
marriage but even the formation of couples has weakened in modern Japan.

“For daughters in particular, the family home is a place where they can wait 
under their parents’ wing until an ideal marriage partner comes along,” he 
added. “Instead of having to get hooked up with a man whose income is unstable, 
they can adopt a strategy of remaining at home in the expectation that sooner 
or later they will meet a man with sufficient income for a marriage partner. 
This is probably one reason why young Japanese are not very sexually active.

“Of course, a certain percentage of the daughters eventually meet and marry 
men with good income prospects. But most daughters end up staying with their 
parents.

“Sons who do not enjoy income stability also opt to remain in the family home. 
They, too, can be expected to get married and move out if their wages rise 
enough, or if they come across a woman who thinks their income is sufficient. 
But this is not the way life ordinarily turns out. As a result, the number of 
sons who continue to live with parents is on the rise.”

Yamada said there was now an expectation gap, with many young people giving up 
hope in the real world and turning to their computer world, where they could 
control their “lives”.

Professor Adrian Favell, a sociologist at the University of Leeds, who 
recently shared a speaking stage with Yamada in London, cautioned against the 
idea of a dysfunctional generation in Japan, saying that the west liked to 
exaggerate the “oddness” of young Japanese people. He said that a declining 
population was not necessarily “bad news”.

“Is it unique to Japan for young people to obsess over pop, film stars, and 
the rest? Or to ‘fall in love’ on the internet? I don’t think so,” he said.
