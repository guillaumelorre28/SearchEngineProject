1 Der Rosenkavalier

The Royal Opera’s turn-of-the-year show is a new production of one of the core 
works of the operatic repertoire. Directed by Robert Carsen, it sets Strauss’s 
rococo comedy at the time of its composition in 1910. Andris Nelsons conducts 
all the performances, while the two central roles are double cast: Renée 
Fleming and Rachel Willis-Sørensen share the part of the Marschallin; Alice 
Coote and Anna Stéphany alternate as Octavian.

2 Messiah

There’s never a shortage of chances to hear Handel’s best-known oratorio at 
this time of year. The performances by the Edinburgh-based Dunedin Consort have 
consistently been among the finest around; this time London also gets a chance 
to appreciate their approach.

3 Vingt Regards Sur l’enfant-Jésus

Though there aren’t many piano works with specific Christmas connections, 
Messiaen’s epic cycle is unquestionably the greatest of them and one of the 
milestones in 20th-century keyboard music in its own right. Latvian pianist 
Reinis Zariņš tackles the monumental 20 pieces, which trace a spiritual journey 
as much as a musical one.

4 Goldberg Variations

Over the next five seasons, the outstanding harpsichordist Mahan Esfahan will 
be working his way through Bach’s solo keyboard works in a series of recitals 
at the Wigmore Hall. He begins his pilgrimage with the Goldberg Variations, 
arguably the greatest of all the composer’s instrumental works.
