One thing this series has always been very good at is a finale. This week’s 
nail-biter was no exception, as Tommy raced against time to save his kidnapped 
son, facing his tunnelling demons and revealing the entertaining truth about 
the great jewel robbery in the process. But the most powerful moment came at 
the very end, as a physically and emotionally battered Mr Shelby summoned his 
family and went fullCorleone <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYnRBX2Trtk> on 
them, dashing money across the table, reminding everyone that if they take “the 
King’s shilling” then they’ve agreed to kill, before dropping the bombshell 
that they were all about to be arrested, but that he’d managed to strike a deal 
…


It was a bittersweet, brilliant ending to what has been an occasionally patchy 
series, and one that made it clear that the constant sense of the Shelbys 
having jumped too far too fast was deliberate. Tommy over-extended himself: he 
believed that having the big house, the perfect wife, the adored child meant he 
was untouchable, and that his countryside folly meant he could take on the big 
boys. He was wrong.

This has always been a show drenched in sin, guilt and redemption, and this 
episode was heavy in all three. Throughout this series, Steven Knight has 
consistently hinted that there is a price to pay for behaving as thePeaky 
Blinders <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peaky-blinders> do. That was 
hammered home tonight, both during the superbly tense confrontation with Alfie 
– “How many sons have you cut, killed, murdered, butchered, both innocent and 
guilty to send them straight to hell?” – and in the final scene in which Tommy 
was as much priest as gang boss, reminding his family of all their sins and 
asking for absolution even as the police poured through the door.

Given how obsessed this season has been with family, it was perfect to end 
with the Shelbys being pulled apart. Family all but destroyed Tommy (Grace and 
Charles were very much his weak spots, understandably so) yet it also got him 
through: John and Arthur bore his worst crimes, Michael saved his life and 
killed the priest, Ada “came back for love”.

For all that, Tommy’s final bitter vision of the Peaky Blinders as a ruthless 
criminal enterprise, perfect players in Alfie Solomons’ wicked world, felt 
bleakly true. Yet there was hope: like Lizzie, Esme and Ada, I too would be 
very interested to hear Polly’s plan for the future of the gang.

 The best reveal of the night … Tommy gives the jewels to Tatiana. Photograph:

The greatest reveal of the night was that Tatiana hired Tommy to do the 
robbery. As to why – the suggestion seemed to be that Grand Duchess Izabella 
was stepmother rather than mother, that the jewels basically belonged to her 
anyway, that she didn’t want her useless father and his impassive wife spunking 
them on a pointless revolution when she could take them and waltz off to a new 
life in Vienna where “a man is waiting for me”. “Poor man,” replied Tommy 
dourly. I can only agree.

The evening was far less kind to our other main villain: Father Hughes died 
choking on his own blood after fatally underestimating nascent psychopath 
Michael. Paddy Considine has been great in this role, sleazy and unnerving at 
every turn, and it’s almost a shame we had to see him go (I did say almost). As 
for the rest of the mysterious “Oddfellows”, they lived to fight another day, 
ending the evening in the ascendant with most of the Shelbys arrested. That’s 
the trouble with shadowy figures of establishment corruption: they’re 
notoriously hard to bring down.

 And the cruellest moment of the night … poor broken Polly. Photograph: Robert 
Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd/Tiger Aspect 
• The cruellest moment of the night was Tommy’s rebuttal of Polly: “He pursued 
you, sought you out – why would an educated man of his standing do something 
like that?” True, it was said in desperation but it was also gratuitously nasty 
… and, as it turned out, gloriously wrong.

• “There were things in that treasury that God himself, he spoke to me and 
said ‘Alfie you were meant to have these things.’” Tom Hardy has so much fun 
with this role that it’s impossible not to go along with the performance, 
baroque as it is.

• The moment before Arthur and John blew up the train was one of the best of 
the entire series. It was subtle and very affecting, from Arthur’s turmoil to 
John’s quiet “I’ll do it.” This series has really fleshed out their 
relationship well.

• It’s pretty much Michael’s fault the train got blown up. If he hadn’t been 
so intent on pulling the trigger on Hughes, word would have reached Finn in 
time. Bad Michael.

• Also bad – the way he callously abandoned the poor motor heiress to her 
abortion. I have a feeling that will come back to bite him.

• The line about Lizzie stopping Tommy’s heart from breaking was interesting. 
I find their relationship believable. It’s not healthy, it’s horribly unequal 
and it couldn’t work long-term but it makes sense. They fall back on each other 
when times are bad.

• Poor Linda and her shattered Californian dreams. I wonder if she’ll head for 
America’s promised land anyway?

• “I’m going back to Birmingham to buy a racehorse and have it trained” – and 
suddenly, the ears of all the May Carleton fans in the audience pricked up …

• I was amused that the Women’s Institute were smart enough to get Tommy a 
horse statue. Forget sex and Siberian kisses: that’s the real way to his heart.

 What a performance … a special shout-out to Paul Anderson’s guilt-ridden 
Arthur Shelby. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions 
Ltd/Tiger Aspect 
• The acting was fantastic again this episode. Special shout-outs to Paul 
Anderson’s guilt-ridden Arthur, Helen McCrory’s broken Polly, Finn Cole’s 
terrifying Michael and, of course, Cillian Murphy, who was outstanding once 
again.

• The whole thing was also beautifully directed by Tim Mielants. Even when 
this craziest of shows is at its most insane, it always looks glorious.

• Finally, if I have one real complaint about a season I’ve largely enjoyed, 
it’s that they did a disservice to Grace by writing her into a lady of the 
manor hole then summarily killing her off to give Tommy further motivation. I 
may not have been particularly fond of the character or actress, but it was 
still poorly done.

Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week

I’m not the biggest Radiohead fan but the use of Life in a Glass House 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXO9KUaI8KM> as Tommy looked round his now 
empty folly was brilliant.

Quote of the week

“I’ve learnt something in the last few days: those bastards are worse than us. 
Politicians, lords and ladies, they’re all worse than us and they will never 
admit us to their palaces no matter how legitimate we become because of who we 
are and where we’re from.” Tommy Shelby, class warrior, lays down the law.

What did you think? Did the ending satisfy you? Will Tommy really save his 
family or did he just get them all locked up so he could grab a bit of peace? 
Thanks again to everyone who has made below the line so entertaining for the 
past six weeks. Let’s raise our glasses of whisky and place bets on what will 
happen when the gang return…
