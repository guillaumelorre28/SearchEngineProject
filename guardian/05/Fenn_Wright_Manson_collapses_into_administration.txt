Fashion chain Fenn Wright Manson has collapsed into administration â€“ the 
latest casualty of the downturn.

The retailer, which was founded in 1974, operates 17 standalone stores and 62 
concessions in department stores such as John Lewis. It was acquired by private 
equity group Darwin in 2010 and employs some 350 staff.

Administrators from the insolvency specialists Zolfo Cooper have been 
appointed. Partner Peter Holder said: "Unfortunately, as with many other 
fashion retailers exposed to declining consumer spend,the deterioration in 
trading conditions in recent months has led to increased financial pressures on 
the business." FWM will continue to trade while Zolfo Cooper seeks a buyer.
