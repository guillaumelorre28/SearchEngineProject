Facebook <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> signalled its 
increasing power and influence with an emphatic set of financial results that 
showed quarterly revenue passing $5bn for the first time, and putting it in a 
position to challenge Google’s dominance of Silicon Valley.

The social networking company’s fourth-quarter report, released on 27 January, 
saw a better-than-expected 51.7% jump in revenues as new advertising formats 
and an improved mobile app drove a sharp rise in ad sales.

Facebook’s net income also more than doubled to $1.56bn in the last three 
months of 2015, even as the Menlo Park, California, company invests heavily in
virtual reality

 and internet access in remote parts of the world.


The company’s total revenue rose to $5.84bn from $3.85bn a year earlier, with 
ad revenue increasing 56.8% to $5.64bn in the holiday shopping period, when 
spending on advertising typically spikes.

Facebook, whose shares were up 7.5% in extended trading on 27 January, said 
mobile ads accounted for 80% of total ad revenue in the quarter, compared with 
about 78% in the third quarter and 69% a year earlier.

Mark Zuckerberg told investors that he was pleased with the continued growth 
of the site, which recorded 1.59 billion users in December 2015, up 14% from 
December 2014.

Of those, 1.44 billion used the service on mobile devices, an increase of 21%.

“Our strategy is working and we have many more opportunities ahead. So we’re 
going to keep investing to deliver more great results over the long term,” said 
Zuckerberg, who has just returned from two months paternity leave.

“With the new addition in my family I’ve been reflecting on the legacy we want 
to pass on to yet next generation. I’m excited about our progress and the 
chance to build great things for the future. If we continue to focus on the 
fundamental challenges of bringing the world closer together, we can create a 
better world for the whole next generation. That’s what I think about every day 
as we think about as we continue to build Facebook.”

Zuckerberg talked enthusiastically about virtual reality, a technology he has 
previously described as the next major computing platform. Facebook’s Oculus 
Rift headset will be shipped to customers by the end of March 2015.

“The Oculus launch is shaping up to be a big moment for the gaming community, 
but virtual reality has the potential to change how we live, work and 
communicate as well. We look forward to seeing how people use it.”


“The reason we’re interested in it as a social company is because we think 
this is going to be a new way people interact,” he said, referring to the 
Oculus Touch accessory, a connected glove which will allow users to interact 
with their hands in a virtual environment.

Zuckerberg emphasized the growth of video on Facebook, which now sees 10m 
hours of video watched every day. The company, which claims the world’s most 
popular smartphone app, has also been benefiting from a surge in video views 
that has attracted advertising dollars.

“It’s much stronger ad growth than we were expecting,” said Ken Sena, an 
analyst at Evercore ISI.


“It signifies the importance of what they’re providing to advertisers,” he 
said. “They’re providing a very efficient method of distribution for them; 
they’re making big investments and, evidenced by their quarterly performance, 
it seems to be working.”

Facebook has also been investing in artificial intelligence

 by experimenting with a virtual assistant, exploring drones to provide 
internet access for remote parts of the world and explored how to monetize some 
of its other products, such as Instagram. The photo-sharing app surpassed 400 
million users last year and began selling ads in September.


Up to Wednesday’s close of $94.45, Facebook’s stock had risen nearly 25% in 
the past 12 months.
