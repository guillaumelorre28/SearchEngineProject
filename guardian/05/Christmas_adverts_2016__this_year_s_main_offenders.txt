John Lewis you already know about. Dog on a trampoline. Bang. Merry Christmas.

 But now, right in the middle of November, we’re practically drowning in 
overblown Christmas adverts. How are you supposed to know if they’re any good? 
Watch them? Hardly – they’re about an hour and a half long each. Instead, 
here’s a quick rundown of this year’s main offenders.

Aldi – Kevin the Carrot

This is a cheap shot. On the surface, Aldi has given us a cavalcade of cruelty 
– a frightened carrot gets maimed over and over again, and the happy ending is 
his dawning realisation that he must spend the rest of his life an inch away 
from the drooling maw of a vicious reindeer. But that doesn’t matter because 
it’s soundtracked by the Home Alone theme tune. Your Christmas advert could 
feature literally anything and it’d still tug at your heartstrings if 
soundtracked by the Home Alone theme tune. Like I said, a cheap shot.

M&S – Christmas with Love from Mrs Claus

Mrs Claus gets in a helicopter and hand-delivers a present to a girl. Then 
Santa gets back, asks how her evening was and she smiles to herself because she 
mistakenly believes that delivering one present to one person requires the same 
amount of planning and effort as delivering billions of presents to literally 
every child on Earth. And there’s a reason why Santa doesn’t use a helicopter, 
Mrs Claus. It’s because fuel is expensive and margins are tight. But no, you 
had to go and hog some of the limelight for yourself. Don’t come running to me 
when the final demands come rolling in.

Waitrose – Home for Christmas

“How about we have a robin battling against the odds to get home for 
Christmas?” “I dunno, it sounds a bit like that John Lewis snowman ad from a 
few years ago.” “Well, what if we get a sailor to stamp on the robin’s face 
halfway through?” “Now you’re talking! Merry Christmas everyone!”

Sainsbury’s – The Greatest Gift

Three fun facts about this year’s Sainsbury’s advert. One: it is over six 
hours long. Two: it’s about a man whose Christmas shopping plans are ruined 
because he’s stuck on a delayed train, though he could just order all his gifts 
on his phone if he gave it even a second of thought. Three: the song is 
performed by James Corden and sounds a bit likeToday’s the Day by Sean Maguire 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_d_fi8IDMo>, which means that the whole thing 
should be encased in cement and flung in a volcano.

Tesco – Bring It On

You have to hand it to Tesco for sticking to its guns. Last year it delivered 
what was by far the worst campaign of the year, with Ruth Jones and Ben Miller 
abjectly mooching around a supermarket along with theirawful adult son 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vf6Hk3YshA>. This year, it’s exactly the same 
again – just without the son.

Boots – The Gift of Beauty

Nice try Boots, but you’ve come dead last this year. Honestly, taking a bunch 
of real-life inspiring women who’ll be working on Christmas Day and making them 
feel wanted? Come back next year with a cartoon about a hobbled reindeer or an 
orphaned manatee who tastes sprouts for the first time or a pig on a pogo 
stick. Then we’ll talk.
