My uncle and aunt lived in Wales, and my memories of summer holidays there are 
full not only of the buzzing of bees and the whirring of the lawnmower, but 
also of the tall, spiky plants in their garden that bore a strange, exotic 
vegetable. Artichoke suppers were a family tradition: we’d eat them with beurre 
noir, dunking in the leaves, then the hearts, before mopping up the butter with 
bread. It was a brilliantly economical supper for my mother, who turned it into 
a ritual that we came to love.

I now eat artichokes in as many ways as I can when they’re in season. If you 
need just the hearts, as for today’s recipes, boil them whole and have the 
leaves as a cook’s perk, or as a starter; otherwise buy ready-prepared hearts 
in jars or tins.

Artichoke heart and summer vegetable tempura with honey saffron mayonnaise

There’s no great secret to tempura batter: use a deep pan so you don’t need as 
much oil, and get it up to heat before frying. Serves six to eight.

2 courgettes
1 small aubergine
8 artichoke hearts
1 handful fresh sage leaves (optional)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Sunflower or vegetable oil, for frying

For the mayonnaise
1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped
2 egg yolks
½ tsp honey
1 tbsp white-wine vinegar
Juice of 1 lemon
500ml sunflower oil 
1 big pinch saffron threads, soaked in 2 tbsp hot water for 30 minutes

For the batter
2 free-range egg yolks
About 350ml iced sparkling water
200g self-raising flour
1 tsp cornflour

Start with the mayo: whizz the garlic, egg yolks, honey, vinegar and 
a tablespoon of lemon juice in a food processor for 30 seconds, then, with the 
motor running, slowly drip the oil through the funnel until the mixture starts 
to thicken and emulsify. With the motor still running, now pour in the rest of 
the oil in a thin, steady stream, then add the saffron and its soaking liquid. 
Season, then stir in lemon juice to taste: you want a bright and lemony mayo 
that’s not too acidic. If it’s a bit on the thick side, loosen with 
a tablespoon of cold water.

Cut the courgettes and aubergine into two-bite pieces and cut the artichoke 
hearts in half. Whisk the egg yolks for the batter with the fizzy water, then 
stir in both flours, but only just to combine: you want some lumps, because 
they’ll help with the crispness. Add the vegetables and sage, if using.

Fill a narrow, heavy-based pan with enough oil to come 5cm up the sides and 
heat to 180C (if you don’t have a thermometer, that’s the stage when a cube of 
bread browns and crisps within 30 seconds). Frying each different vegetable at 
a time, lift them out of the batter and fry in batches so as not to overcrowd 
the pan. Cook until crisp and pale gold all over, then transfer to a plate 
lined with kitchen paper and season with salt. Keep warm and repeat with the 
other veg. Serve hot with the mayo alongside. (Alternatively, fry everything in 
advance and reheat in a hot oven: the tempura won’t be as light and crisp as it 
is straight from the fryer, but it’ll still be very good.)

This comforting, silky stew is a celebration of summer vegetables, and 
definitely worthy of a good bottle of olive oil and fresh parmesan, which will 
transform it into a bowl of rich, savoury flavours. Serves four.

25g butter
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
3 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced
3 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
A few sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
1 sprig rosemary, picked and chopped
2 bay leaves
2 globe artichokes hearts cut into 2cm-wide chunks (or 200g jarred artichoke 
hearts, drained)
200ml white wine
250g podded broad beans (fresh or frozen)
250g podded peas (fresh or frozen)
1 big handful fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
1 big handful fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped

For the polenta
250g quick-cook polenta
50g butter
60g grated parmesan, plus extra to serve
Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve

Heat the butter and oil in a wide, deep pan, add the shallots and garlic, and 
season generously. Fry on a medium heat until the shallots are softened, about 
five minutes, then stir in the thyme, rosemary, bay, artichoke hearts and wine. 
Bring to a boil and simmer for three minutes. If you’re using fresh artichoke 
hearts, now add 100ml water, cover and simmer until they are tender, for about 
12 minutes, before adding the beans and peas; if you are using jarred or tinned 
hearts, don’t add any extra water, and just stir in the beans and peas after 
you have simmered the hearts, wine and herbs.

Leave the stew to simmer for four to five minutes, until the beans and peas 
are tender, then lift out and discard the bay leaves. Stir in the mint and 
parsley, and adjust the seasoning to taste.

Make the polenta according to the packet instructions and, when ready, stir in 
the butter and grated parmesan. Season to taste, then spoon into shallow bowls. 
Top the soft polenta with ladles of the stew and serve with a wedge of 
parmesan, a bottle of good extra-virgin olive oil and a pepper grinder, so that 
people can dress their bowls with extras of all three.

And for the rest of the week…

The saffron mayo is great with fish: dollop some on a simple cod stew with 
tomato and fennel (and maybe more saffron), and serve with crostini, say; or 
use leftovers for dunking artichoke leaves, or in fish finger sandwiches, or 
even in a posh egg mayonnaise. The stew keeps for three to four days in the 
fridge; its vivid, green colour will fade, but the flavour gets better and 
better.
