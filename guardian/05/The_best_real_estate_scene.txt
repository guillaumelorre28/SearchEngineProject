Suburbia. The ever-spruce Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) stands before the 
curtains of her latest property, a slightly down-at-heel condo. Her eyes 
brighten; she straightens her back.

"I will sell this house today." 

Cut to Carolyn, on her hands and knees cleaning the kitchen. 

"I will sell this house today." 

She arranges flowers in the lounge. 

"I will sell this house today." 

Carolyn shows a pair of sullen, middle-aged women into the house. 

"Welcome! I'm Carolyn Burnham. This living room is very dramatic. But wait 
until you see the native stone fireplace!"

She hovers in the bedroom. 

"Cream would really lighten this place up. You could even put in skylights!" 

On to the kitchen. 

"A dream come true for any cook!" 

Outside, Carolyn stands beside the pool with her disgruntled clients. 

"We were told this pool was lagoon-like. There's nothing lagoon-like about it."

"Except the bugs." 

"There aren't even any plants out here." 

Carolyn's smile freezes. She motions toward a bush. 

"What do you call this? Is this not a plant? If you have a problem with the 
plants, I can call my landscape architect."

"I think lagoons, I think tropical. This is a... hole." 

Back in the house, alone again, Carolyn weeps. Suddenly she slaps herself 
around the face.

"Shut up! You're weak! You baby! Shut up! SHUT UP!"

 Pointless trivia: Annette Bening has described Hilary Clinton's bid to become 
Senator of New York as the work of "an opportunist".
