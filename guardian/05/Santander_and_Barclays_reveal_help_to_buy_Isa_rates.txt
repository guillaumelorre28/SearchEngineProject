These rates are in line with those offered by Nationwide and NatWest, but just 
half the rate available at Halifax, where savers can earn 4%.

Help-to-buy Isas <https://www.theguardian.com/money/isas> are available from 
Tuesday, offering first-time buyers who pay in up to £200 a month the chance to 
boost their savings with a 25% government subsidy.

The subsidy, which is capped at £3,000, is available to each first-time buyer, 
so a couple can get up to £6,000 towards their first home.

The money is only paid when a purchase goes through, and can be claimed at any 
point up to December 2030.

Santander’s help-to-buy Isa will pay a rate of 2% to existing customers with 
123, World and Select accounts, and 1.5% to all other customers. As with all 
cash Isas, interest is tax-free.

Barclays will offer a flat rate of 2.25%. Its account will go on sale through 
branches and by phone on 17 December 2015.

According to the scheme rules, savers can deposit up to £1,200 within the 
first calendar month of opening an account, and then up to £200 a month after 
that.

The 25% government bonus can be claimed once a buyer has saved £1,600 and is 
payable on the savings plus any interest.
