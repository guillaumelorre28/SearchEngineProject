The emerging singer Arlissa is 5ft 9in, usually tops 6ft in heels, and has 
been this height since she was 13. At times a help, at times a hindrance – 
though nothing but terrible, obviously, when she was a pupil at school in south 
London. "I was taller than all the boys in my year," says the 20-year-old, name 
pronounced Ar-lee-sa, who'll soon release a first solo single,Sticks & Stones 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSg2lTpmlMI>. "I felt freakish."

But in seeking out friends who were taller – older – she reckons she learned 
to focus on what she wanted in life from a young age. At 16, she started 
skipping A-level lessons to spend hours with a songwriting partner in a music 
studio in Surrey. Meanwhile, the willowy frame helped get her weekend work at 
the Abercrombie & Fitch shop off Savile Row, selling clothes and modelling for 
£6.50 an hour. She spent the wages on recording sessions and, at 19, after 
unsatisfying A-level grades had come through, the disappointment was offset by 
an album deal with London Records and later Jay-Z'sRoc Nation

Preview tracks from Arlissa's debut LP, including the stomping break-up anthem 
Sticks & Stones, have led people to make comparisons with Florence Welch. 
Exactly: her stuff is all bazooka vocal over urgent, tribal drums. Lyrically, 
it's heartbreak city.Arlissa <https://www.theguardian.com/music/arlissa> 
explains: "When I broke up with my first boyfriend, I tried to steer away from 
writing about it. I wanted to be like Regina Spektor, writing cute, quirky 
songs, but I couldn't do it. Whenever I tried to write I poured my heart out."

The results are stirring, valedictory anthems about discontinued love, 
mournful but not nostalgic. The anomaly is Arlissa's only released track to 
date, a 2012 duet with the US rapper Nas,Hard to Love Somebody 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IKmR6dISj8>. In it, Nas offers belligerent 
verses about a clingy ex-girlfriend while Arlissa dutifully sings choruses 
about never again knowing his like, etc. "I'm proud to have sung on it but 
that's not my song. None of my writing delivers the message: all I want is you."

She is verging on very good things, I think. She must, by now, be just fine 
with being tall. "Still a bit iffy," she says. There is a tattoo of a bird on 
Arlissa's right hand. I ask if it has any meaning (tattoos reliably do). "I've 
always been self-conscious, especially about my height. This tattoo was meant 
to be a meadowlark, which is supposed to symbolise being happy within yourself, 
a native American thing."

Annoyingly, the tattooist couldn't manage the required detail for a 
meadowlark. Arlissa got a swallow instead. Even so: "Whenever I'm singing I can 
look at it and think: it's going to be OK."
