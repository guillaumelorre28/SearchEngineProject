Readers reacted with fury, trolling and occasional agreement when we published 
an article about overrated television shows last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/26/most-overrated-tv-shows-friends-seinfeld-west-wing-lost-mad-men-downton-abbey>
.


Thousands of commenters took to our threads to argue whether Seinfeld was 
overrated, underrated or just terrible; and whether Mad Men was one of the most 
profound series of our time or a big ol’ waste of the precious hours of human 
existence.

They also came up with their own nominations. Here are five of the most 
compelling suggestions.


We apologise in advance if your favourite show is included below.

 ‘Corrie with nudity’ … Game of Thrones. Photograph: HBO 
Serious academic question: is Game of Thrones a gateway drug into the world of 
fantasy? Has the show’s popularity led to a surge of interest in Warhammer and 
dark elves? Or is everyone just in it for the naked dragons?

“Game of Thrones = Coronation Street with swords and nudity,” said ThamesSider.

“And that’s as complimentary as I can get”.

 Excruciatingly dull … Breaking Bad. Photograph: Frank Ockenfels/AP 
It is a shibboleth that Breaking Bad was good and important, coming at a time 
when critics considered US television drama to be going through a patch more 
purple than Prince in a purple suit mid-way through a performance of Purple 
Rain.

On the other hand ...

“Breaking Bad was a telemovie thinly spread over five excruciatingly dull 
seasons,”said TheKernel 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/79911271>.

“Utterly, disproportionately loved by TV pseudos everywhere.”

 ‘Went on at least a decade too long’ … The X-Files. Photograph: Channel 5 
As a teenager, I loved the X-Files. Adored it. It was very much of its time, a 
kind of post-Fukuyama, post-enlightenment romp of conspiracy theories, aliens 
and monsters of the week.

But it did go downhill – and fast – after a couple of seasons. Was it the 
1990s version of Lost?


“If you’re not a fan of wasting years of your life on pointless conspiracies, 
then surely The X-Files deserves a place on the list,” said Steven Hyde.

“That show went on at least a decade too long.”

 ‘Incredibly boring’ … The Wire. Photograph: BBC/HBO/HBO 
Somewhere deep in my Guardian contract, it is stipulated that I never say a 
bad word about The Wire*. Fortunately, our readers have no such contractual 
obligation.

“Honestly, for all its great social commentary, it is just incredibly boring 
television,”said Ripuli 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/79910144>, before having 
a nice sit-down and reflecting on what he’d done, gazing into the mid-distance 
for an exceptionally long time.

 Like a mediocre Jonathan Creek … Sherlock. Photograph: BBC/Hartswood Films 
I never truly understood the love for Sherlock, but a lot of that comes down 
to whether you enjoy the performances of the show’s occasionally infuriating 
breakout star, Benedict Cumberbatch, who went on to appear in the worst Star 
Trek film of all time. That’s right, even worse than the one directed by 
Shatner.

 “I truly think it’s not half as interesting, clever or witty as a mediocre 
Jonathan Creek episode,” saidnemo1887.
