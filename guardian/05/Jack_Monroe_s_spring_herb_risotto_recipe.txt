It finally feels as if spring is here, and I’m celebrating with a great fresh 
herb risotto. Risotto is my favourite catch-all dinner for odds and ends in the 
fridge, or new season flavours, and this one is no exception. I used parsley, 
mint and dill in mine, but choose the combination of herbs you prefer. It also 
works nicely with leftover salad leaves, such as spinach, rocket or pea shoots 
– there is a huge choice of greenery at this time of year. I used chicken stock 
here, but a ham stock risotto with pea shoots is another favourite of mine.

(Serves 4)

1 onion, finely sliced

2 fat cloves of garlic, minced

2 tbsp oil

400g rice (arborio or long grain)

100ml white wine

700ml veg or chicken stock

A fistful of herbs

Zest and juice of a lemon

Toss the onion and garlic into a wide, shallow pan with a little oil. Cook on 
a low heat for about five minutes until it starts to soften, stirring 
occasionally.

Add the rice and a little more oil, and crank the heat up high for a minute to 
toast the edges of the rice.

Slosh in the wine, stir, and add a generous splash of stock.

Turn the heat down low again. When the stock is almost absorbed, repeat, and 
carry on until your rice is soupy but al dente, which may take slightly more or 
less stock.

Finely chop the herbs and fold through with the lemon zest and juice, and a 
drizzle more oil.

Rest for five minutes before serving.
