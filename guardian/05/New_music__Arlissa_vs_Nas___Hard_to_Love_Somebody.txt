Nineteen-year-old Londoner Arlissa sort of has her ex-boyfriend to thank for 
her success. Inspired by their break-up after a three-year relationship, she 
wrote Hard to Love Somebody, which made its way to Nas. The rapper liked what 
he heard and asked to turn the song into a duet of sorts, flying Arlissa out to 
LA to watch him record his mainly improvised verses. "The whole experience was 
completely surreal," Arlissa said recently about the collaboration. "My ex was 
obsessed with Nas, and we used to listen to him all the time. [Nas] just makes 
you feel so comfortable that it wasn't until I was on the plane home that I 
suddenly realised, 'Fuck, I just did a track with Nas.'" Over a swelling intro 
of delicate piano and angelic backing vocals, Arlissa delivers lines about the 
usual things people who are recently heartbroken feel: running out of love and 
sunshine being replaced by rain. But it's Arlissa's voice that makes it all 
seem less cliched – her resigned, Beth Orton-esque lilt weaving in and out of 
Nas's typically energetic verses.

• Hard to Love Somebody is released on London Records on 30 September.
