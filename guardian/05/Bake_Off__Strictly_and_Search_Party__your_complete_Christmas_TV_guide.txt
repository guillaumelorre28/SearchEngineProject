Search Party. Photograph: Macall Polay/TBS 
A brilliantly drawn send-up of New York millennial hipster life that has been 
all over the US best-TV-of-the-year lists. But at its heart, Search Party is a 
thrilling detective drama. Alia Shawkat (Maeby Fünke, to Arrested Development 
fans) plays Dory, a sane, sweet, aimless woman in a sea of narcissists, who 
becomes obsessed with solving the case of her missing college friend Chantal – 
then takes her drippy boyfriend Drew and her infectiously awful friends Elliott 
and Portia (and their kombucha) along for the ride. Available from Boxing Day.

, but will it prove as popular as last year’s Making a Murderer? Brit Marling’s 
paranormal mumblecore mystery is about a blind woman who has been missing for 
years – and then returns home, able to see. But beyond that, it’s about 
existentialism, near-death experiences and the Russian oligarchy.

The Crown
Forget the Queen’s speech and get to know Claire Foy’s Her Maj instead. Over 
10 solid hours, you’re guaranteed more intrigue, more of Prince Philip’s gaffes 
– and more sex (both horse and human).

Trollhunters
From 23 December, you can watch Guillermo del Toro’s animated series about a 
gang of friends who discover their suburban town’s secret troll underworld. 
When a boy named Jim accidentally finds the Amulet of Daylight, it turns him 
into a champion trollhunter. If he fails, trolls will destroy the whole human 
world.

Captive
Made by the Oscar-winning producers of Man on Wire and Searching for Sugar 
Man, Captive is a slick, compelling documentary series about hostage 
situations, from US prison riots to the retired couple held for over a year by 
Somali pirates.

 One for the Friday Night Lights fans … Last Chance U. Photograph: Alan

A great American football documentary that requires absolutely no prior 
knowledge of the game. If you have yet to meet Ronald Ollie and Miss Wagner and 
Coach Buddy Stephens, head straight to Scooba, Mississippi and join them for a 
thrilling season at East Mississippi Community College. One for the Friday 
Night Lights fans.

Last Chance U: is this the best sports documentary series of all time?

The Grand Tour
Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May head to Lapland for this 
festive edition – but will they outspeed Santa in the first right-hand-drive 
Ford Mustang? Expect an alternative car-based gift guide, more PC-baiting 
jokes, and icicles glinting on their giant tent.

Mr Robot
Brought to you by the world’s least reliable narrator, Elliot Alderson. What 
could be more Christmassy than hacking and the downfall of American capitalism?

Halt and Catch Fire
Sex, drugs and Silicon Valley … AMC’s sensational and sadly underrated 80s 
tech drama had been gathering pace in the first two series, but this year it 
went into overdrive, with each episode more staggering than the last.
