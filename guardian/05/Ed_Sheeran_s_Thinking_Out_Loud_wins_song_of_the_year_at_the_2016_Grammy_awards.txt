The song, which featured on Sheeran’s album x, was actually written after the 
album had finished.Wadge told the Western Mail 
<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/amy-wadge-8933506>: 
“His album was finished and I was just going to his house to have some 
chilling-out time with my mate – it wasn’t ever supposed to be a songwriting 
session. But when Ed went for a shower, I picked up a guitar which Harry Styles 
had bought him and I played two lines. Ed came running downstairs and said, 
‘What’s that? We have to do something with that.’ We went for dinner with his 
mum and dad and then came back and wrote the song, which Ed recorded on his 
phone straight away.”

Sheeran was also nominated for record of the year and best pop solo 
performance, in both cases for Thinking Out Loud.

The other nominees for song of the year were Alright, by Kendrick Lamar; Blank 
Space, by Taylor Swift; Girl Crush, by Little Big Town; and See You Again, by 
Wiz Khalifa featuring Charlie Puth.
