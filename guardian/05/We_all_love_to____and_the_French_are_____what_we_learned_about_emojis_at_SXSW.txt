Linguists, and perhaps everyone else, started taking emojis a bit more 
seriously afterOxford Dictionaries made

 the “tears of joy”emoji its word of the year 
<http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/11/word-of-the-year-2015-emoji/> in 
November. The first, very basic, emojis were created in Japan around 1998, but 
the rich, color emojis we use now didn’t make it to a full emoji keyboard on 
Apple’s iOS devices until 2011 and Android in 2013.

The alternative keyboard app SwiftKey found in August that 70% of emojis are 
used to express positive emotion, 15% neutral and only 15% negative. SwiftKey 
co-founder Ben Medlock told a packed room atSXSW 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sxsw> that this might be because we tend 
to feel we have to present a positive image to the world. So we’re self-editing 
in favor of happy, shiny emojis.

Emojis being added to a dictionary is a small side note in the development of 
language. Linguist Gretchen McCulloch described emojis as a new “fourth 
quadrant” of communication; speech has both formal and informal expressions, 
and now writing has an informal version. “When we’re communicating by speech, 
we expect to be able to see the person, to see the emotions and reactions. And 
it’s the same in emoji. It’s not language but a supplement to language and 
helps us embody our emotions online,” she said.

Crying with laughter: how we learned how to speak emoji

Things we learned about emojis:

• The most popular is the tears of laughter emoji by some way, accounting for 
something like 20% of all emoji use. 😂

• Emojis are used in 4.6% of all typing sessions (at least by SwiftKey users) 
and only 15% of those are emoji-only – meaning people normally mix emojis with 
words.

• DJ Khalid was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive spike in 
use of the key emoji in December. 🔑

• Emojis are very often used in repetition, reflecting common gestures such as 
nodding, clapping and shaking the head. 😂 😂 😂

In the US, emoji use varies significantly by state:

• People in Hawaii were the top users of palm trees, sunsets and surfing.🌴 🌅 
🏄

• Las Vegas residents were the top users of lips, devils, the scream, the 
angel and the, um, aubergine/eggplant. (The latter has been co-opted as the 
nearest thing to male anatomy.) 👄 😱 👿 🍆

• LGBT emojis are used at the highest rate in conservative states, possibly 
because things that are accepted or the norm seem less discussed. 🌈 But 
Portugal and Australia, where drug laws are most liberal, are the highest users 
of the mushroom, pill, syringe and cigarette emoji. 🍄 💊 💉 🚬

• Santa is most heavily used by Danish, Norwegian and Swedish speakers. 🎅

• French speakers use hearts and broken hearts four times more than speakers 
of other languages do. 💔 💔 💔 💔

Proposals for new emojis currently have to be approved and then integrated by 
the Unicode Consortium. They are then added to the ever-expandinglists of emojis
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/17/crying-with-laughter-how-we-learned-how-to-speak-emoji>
 that can be added in messaging apps and social media tools.

What’s the next phase? It could be more centralized tracking of emojis – if a 
new emoji were added for earthquakes, geo-location services could aggregate 
real-time news of activity. Advertisers will also try to get in on the trick; 
it’s not a huge leap of imagination to see McDonald’s golden arches as an 
emoji. And a predictive emoji keyboard would be a challenge, but will 
inevitably happen.
