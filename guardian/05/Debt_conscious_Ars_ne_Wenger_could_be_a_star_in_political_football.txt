There is someone missing from the list of top thinkers attending the 
International Monetary Fund's conference in Washington this week – Arsenal 
managerArsène Wenger <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsene-wenger>.

As someone who has consistently warned of the catastrophe awaiting any 
organisation with sky-high debts, he deserves his place at high table. More 
than that, Wenger's charisma and an economics degree from the University of 
Strasbourg would be a positive benefit to debates usually conducted by 
terrified bureaucrats and policymakers.

In 2008 he supported a Uefa investigation into club finances after Michel 
Platini, the former French footballer and Uefa boss, said the emergence of a 
debt-fuelled aristocracy of super-clubs was bad for the game. (The dominance of 
Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea – all of which would be 
broke if their debt deals crumbled – scuppered Platini's plans.)

In January, Wenger restated his position: "Professional football is about 
winning and balancing the budget," he said. "That's the basic rule, one I 
fought for. All the rest is half-cheating."

Now, he believes only the cleansing properties of a full-scale banking crash 
will sort out football's financial ills – and that one is on its way. It's a 
drastic solution. But it may be the only one that putsArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> back at the top table of 
European football.
