Jared on Ellen




What were you hoping for?
A pleasant evening that would lead to wilder evenings.

First impressions?
Pretty, friendly and funny.

What did you talk about?
The cheapness of drinks outside London, which bake we’d present to Mary and 
Paul <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off>, and 
whether Blair and Bush are war criminals.

Any awkward moments?
I couldn’t remember the name of the documentary maker Adam Curtis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/adam-curtis>.

Good table manners?
Perfect.

Best thing about Ellen?
She’s a no-nonsense, down-to-earth liberal lefty who made me laugh.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
Yes, she enjoys a lot of the same music and tipples.

Describe her in three words
Fun, warm, raconteur.

What do you think she made of you?
Probably a little formal, but hopefully sweet.

Did you go on somewhere?
I was tempted to ask her to hit up 2 Many DJs <http://www.2manydjs.com/> at 
XOYO, but it was a school night.

And... did you kiss?
A gentleman never tells.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I should have gone in a T-shirt and trainers rather than a shirt and boat 
shoes.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
To share a couple of £4 pints, sure.

back outside.

Good table manners?
Very efficient.

Best thing about Jared?
He was a good listener.

Would you introduce him to your friends?

Describe him in three words

What do you think he made of you?
Looks like a teenager, sounds like a cartoon voiceover.

Did you go on somewhere?
On to the 341 bus.

And... did you kiss?
We parted ways with an awkward hug. Very British.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d have eaten all the cheese – wasted cheese makes me sad.

Marks out of 10?
6.

Would you meet again?
I had a nice time, but some things aren’t meant to be.

Jared and Ellen ate at Macellaio RC, London EC2 <http://www.macellaiorc.com>.
