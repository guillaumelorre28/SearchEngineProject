Karim Benzema scored twice but then picked up a thigh injury as France claimed 
an emphatic 4-0 home win in a friendly againstArmenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/armenia> on Thursday.

The Real Madrid striker scored twice in as many minutes after the break, 
adding to goals from Antoine Griezmann and Yohan Cabaye, before being 
substituted with fewer than 10 minutes left due to a thigh problem.

It was France’s third victory in a row after wins against Serbia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2015/sep/07/france-v-serbia> and 
Portugal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/04/portugal-france-match-report> 
in friendlies last month.

The Euro 2016 hosts next face Denmark in Copenhagen and once again they will 
be without the midfielder Paul Pogba who was ruled out of the game in Nice and 
will also sit out Sunday’s match because of a sprained ankle.

As expected, it was a one-sided affair at the Allianz Riviera. Mathieu 
Valbuena and Griezmann were the most dangerousFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> players, threatening the Armenia 
defence on the flanks.

Griezmann opened the scoring 10 minutes before the interval, firing home a 
powerful low shot from just outside the box after a fine one-two with Benzema.

France doubled their lead 10 minutes into the second half when Cabaye was set 
up by Valbuena and curled a perfect shot into the far corner.

Benzema made it 3-0 with a header from Griezmann’s corner in the 78th minute, 
before rubbing salt into Armenia’s wounds with a low shot after being set up by 
Anthony Martial, who was on as a substitute.

Benzema was replaced by Olivier Giroud two minutes later, holding his thigh as 
he limped off the pitch.
