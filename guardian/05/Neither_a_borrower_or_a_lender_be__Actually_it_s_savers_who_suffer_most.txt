There is a lot of justifiable angst about lack of borrowing in the economy and 
what can be done to persuade the banks to start lending again.

But it is also worth sparing a thought for savers, especially those who rely 
on income from their savings. With the consumer prices index now at 2.6%, a 20% 
basic rate taxpayer needs to find an account paying 3.25% to offset the impact 
of inflation. A 40% taxpayer needs an account paying at least 4.3%.

According to Moneyfacts, which monitors UK savings products, there are 1,092 
savings accounts available on the market and only 227 of them will offset the 
inflation rate (and then only just). Of those, 128 are ISAs and 96 are 
fixed-term accounts. There are just two notice accounts that allow savers to 
stay ahead of inflation (by 0.05% and 0.1%) and not a single no-notice account.

For higher rate taxpayers there is just one account that won't see the value 
of their savings eroded. But don't rush â€“ there's a drawback. It's a five-year 
bond, offered by the Yorkshire and Clydesdale Banks, and hopeless for those 
seeking income because the 4.39% interest is paid only on maturity.
