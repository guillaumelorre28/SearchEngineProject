It’s not often that a man with his top on becomes a sex symbol, but that is 
precisely what happened to Colin Firth when heclimbed out of a pond 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hasKmDr1yrA> with his white shirt clinging to 
his manly chest in the BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The shirt 
is so famous that it is going to be apart of an exhibit 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/arts/television/mr-darcys-shirt-is-coming-to-america.html>
 starting in August at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, about 
the similarities between Shakespeare and Jane Austen, the Regency’s most famous 
novelist.

But why should we let our historical and literary tour of European history 
begin and end at 1813? There is a whole host of things we can learn from the 
pectoral and abdominal muscles of TV’s hottest men across time. Here, we 
imagine how a whole museum show might look if made up from the many shirtless 
scenes in costume dramas.

First, let us return to 30 BC, when Marc Antony taught us all about the Roman 
occupation of Egypt <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA3Mbbht4WQ>, and how to 
look amazing while not wearing any armor at all. Thanks, Rome.

Now let us get into our studly time machine and venture to Norway in the 8th 
century and check in withthe Vikings 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiMEUbCZKSo>, where we learn that this race of 
warriors is covered in tattoos, scars and manicured chest hair. Given that they 
live so close to the Arctic, you would think they might invest in more 
clothing. You would be wrong.

It’s time to spy on a young Henry VIII, the 16th century’s biggest playboy. 
Not only did he have many wives and no sons during the Tudors’ dynasty, but he 
also made those weird puffy pants look a whole lot better when hewasn’t wearing 
his frilly collar and billowing shirt

Around the same time the Borgias were in control of the Vatican. While we 
don’t have any footage of the pope and his ilk in their skivvies, let this 
young lad teach you about the unusual bathing habits that wereprevalent at the 
time

While excavating history it’s important to look not just at the kings and 
rulers, but also the common people. Here isthe wonderful Poldark

 exhibiting some of the agricultural techniques that were popularized in the 
18th century.

Since we’re speaking about the downtrodden of those times, take a look at 
Jamie Frazier <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi465rDMtAM>, a Scottish 
clansman from 1743 who fell in love with anOutlander 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/mar/21/ronald-d-moore-outlander>
. He also felt the whip of his English overlords before the Battle of Culloden 
ended the nascent Jacobite uprising.

Skipping forward a mere 200 years, in the Cambridgeshire village of 
Grantchester during the 1950s we learnthat bathing costumes

, at least among the rural clergy and their policeman best friends, are a lot 
skimpier than the shirt and undergarments we saw Mr Darcy wear more than 100 
years earlier.

Over in urban areas, thanks to Call the Midwife we see an example of the act 
of cottaging 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/call-midwife-homophobia-storyline-moves-5090733>
, the practice where men could find anonymous sex with one another in the 
public toilets of London from the 1950s and beyond.

So there you go: 2,000 years of human history and a whole lot of pecs. And to 
think your mother always taught you that television would rot your brain.
