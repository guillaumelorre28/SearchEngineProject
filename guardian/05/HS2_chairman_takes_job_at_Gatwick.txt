HS2’s chairman, Sir David Higgins, is to become chairman of Gatwick next 
month, leaving the£55bn high-speed rail project

 with an increasingly occupied figurehead and no permanent chief executive.


Higgins, who also spends time working in Australia as a director of the 
Commonwealth Bank, will take over from Sir Roy McNulty on 1 January at the 
Sussex airport.


He is paid £240,000 for three days a week at HS2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2> and is understood to be remaining in post 
as chair for up to a year, until a replacement is found and as the search for a 
new chief executive continues.

The previous chief executive, Simon Kirby, whom Higgins brought over from 
Network Rail on a salary of £775,000,announced his departure in September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/10/hs2-boss-quits-before-key-decision-on-high-speed-rail-project>
 for a more lucrative role at Rolls-Royce.


Earlier this week Higgins told the transport select committee that HS2 should 
consider offering loyalty bonuses to ensure its top people stayed in the job.


He told MPs on Monday: “It is always difficult to talk about bonuses in the 
public sector … but we should look at some sort of bonus over a period of years 
that encourages people to stay – it is something we should consider.”


Higgins was chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/28/oda-chief-quits-for-network-rail> 
from 2005-11 and ran Network Rail from 2011-14.


Gatwick is continuing to invest and remains poised to push its claim for a 
second runway shouldHeathrow’s planned expansion

 be blocked by parliament next year.


Higgins said Gatwick had made “remarkable progress” in recent years: “Whilst 
the case for Gatwick expansion in the future remains very strong, the challenge 
for Gatwick now is to continue to invest so it can maximise the use of its 
existing facilities and so can do even more for Britain in the coming years.”


HS2 said the extra work would not affect or conflict with Higgins’s current 
role at HS2.
