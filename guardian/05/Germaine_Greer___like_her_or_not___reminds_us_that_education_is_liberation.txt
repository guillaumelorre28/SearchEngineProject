The event was held deep in the belly of Hobart’s subterranean art gallery, Mona
 <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mona>, the cavernous space with one 
huge wall hugged by Sidney Nolan’s enormous snake mural. To my right, on a long 
couch on a makeshift stage, sat our esteemed guest for an evening’s debate 
about the representation of women in art.

Before proceedings kicked off, I checked to see that my guest was happy with 
where she was placed on the couch. She looked me directly in the eyes, and with 
added twinkle, gave me a succinct answer: “I don’t give a fuck.”

With that, Professor Germaine Greer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/germainegreer> gave all of us permission to 
do the same. And with no fucks given, the evening turned into an engaging, 
enlightening and occasionally fiery discussion.

Being on a panel with an individual responsible for writing – like it or not – 
one of the most significant feminist texts of our times, who possesses a 
startling intellect and is known for eviscerating folk whose arguments aren’t 
up to scratch on the facts, is equal parts daunting and terrifying.

What Germaine Greer and The Female Eunuch mean to me

Agree or disagree with Greer – and everyone has a view 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/26/germaine-greer-female-eunuch-feminists-influence>
 – as our discussion unfolded, I realised that there is something utterly 
glorious about watching someone who is truly liberated through knowledge in 
full flight.

Greer is capable of returning serve on a smorgasbord of ideas thrown at her. 
If you’ve thought about it, she’s probably thought about it more. Sadly, 
though, I feel that she is mainly rolled out these days for panels because she 
happily courts controversy. She gives good quotes, that are often far too 
complex for these clickbait times of polarised views and simplified outrage.

We Australians haven’t really got their heads around the fact that people can 
have both intellectual rigour and a sense of humour at once. Greer, who has 
both, knows exactly what she’s doing.

Intellectuals are an anomaly in Australia. Good ones, that is. Entertaining 
ones. Funny ones. Greer survives it all by having a healthy sense of self and 
by avoiding social media, which she calls a vomitorium. She suggests that 
because we get only one star to nurture, we shouldn’t waste that star on 
internet trolls who spew forth opinions. Twitter, Facebook and the like are 
just another way of people yelling at one another in the town square.

 Germaine Greer and Roxane Gay discuss contemporary feminism - video 
Terror abated, I walked away from the evening inspired. The discussion 
provided a bagload of thoughts about the representation of women in art, which 
was entirely the point, but also an even stronger reminder that education is 
power.

It’s important we foster a new generation of young ’uns who don’t give two 
fucks and have the intellectual rigour to back that up. Even if they aren’t 
always agreeable. True power and liberation comes through education. That is 
why it – and those who hold it, as Greer does – are feared.

Education should be accessible for all. Education is how we make a better 
Australia. I hope we still want that.
