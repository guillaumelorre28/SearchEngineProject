There is something grand about vegetables roasted whole. All the food I make 
celebrates vegetables in some way, but cooking them whole takes it a step 
further. A complete vegetable, served up all golden and crackling, its colour 
intensified, makes a wonderful centrepiece that can be lacking in some 
meat-free cooking.

These recipes find their way into our kitchen on most weeknights with a simple 
salad, or at weekends as the focus of a lazy lunch or dinner with lemon and 
coriander-seed roast potatoes, steamed lemon-dressed greens and honeyed 
parsnips with a few cumin seeds.

Whole, roasted cauliflower has been a mainstay on restaurant menus for the 
past couple of years. It looks and tastes brilliant – burnished and browned, 
its buttery clean white inside offers a sharp contrast to the crisp and highly 
flavoured exterior. It’s so easy to do at home and is a really pleasing thing 
to put on the table with a sharp knife for everyone to cut big wedges for 
themselves.

Roast squash is something that I have returned to after a few years of doing 
without. Along with the other vegetarian stalwarts of mushroom risotto and 
stuffed peppers, there was a time when roast squash was the offering of choice 
and we all overindulged. But it’s time to welcome it back – it’s an amazing, 
nurturing veg, generous in flavour, and comes in a ton of varieties. And now is 
the time to get your hands on more unusual specimens. I used onion and kabocha 
squash here, stuffed with plump grains and sweet roast fennel, some good sharp 
cheddar and topped with toasted buttery oats. A butternut would work too, 
though you won’t get quite as much of a hollow for stuffing.

Whole roast squash

I used a mixture of two, bright-orange onion squash, big enough to serve two, 
plus two smaller green kabocha or acorn squash each big enough for one. Both 
roast in about the same time, though huge pumpkins would take longer.

Serves 4
A mixture of whole squashes: about 750g squash per person (I used 2 onion 
squash and 2 smaller kabocha squash)
4 fennel bulbs
1 garlic bulb
Olive oil
Salt and black pepper
250g freekeh or pearl barley
125g sharp cheddar or other cheese
1 lemon, zested
1 bunch fennel tops or dill
1 red chilli, deseeded if you like
A knob of butter
50g rolled oats or barley flakes
1 tsp fennel seeds

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Use a big, heavy knife to cut off 
the base of each squash, so they sit upright on a tray. Cleanly cut the top off 
each one in a single piece (you are going to put the tops back on) about 3-4cm 
from the top. Use a metal spoon to scoop out the seeds and the fibres until you 
have a neat hollow.

2 Trim the fennel, removing any tough outer leaves, then cut the bulb into a 
few big wedges.

3 Put the squash in a large roasting tray or two. Scatter the fennel wedges 
around and put the bulb of garlic on too. Drizzle the lot with olive oil, 
making sure you get inside the squash, and season with salt and pepper. Pop the 
tops back on the squash. Roast for 45-60 minutes, or until the squash are 
tender and the fennel has started to soften and brown. If your squash take a 
little longer, you can remove the fennel once it’s nicely soft and brown around 
the edges, as you don’t want it to overcook.

4 Put the freekeh or pearl barley in a medium pan and cover with cold water. 
Add a big pinch of salt, then bring to the boil and simmer until al dente 
(about 12 minutes for freekeh and 25 minutes for pearl barley). Drain and 
transfer to a large bowl.

5 Remove the garlic and fennel from the roasting dish. When cool enough to 
handle, squeeze the roasted garlic into the freekeh. Roughly chop the fennel 
and add it to the bowl along with the cheese, lemon zest, salt and pepper. Chop 
the fennel tops and chilli and add these too. Taste the mixture and adjust the 
seasoning, if you like.

6 Divide the mixture between the squash and return them to the oven for 10 
minutes. Meanwhile, heat some butter in a small pan, add the oats, fennel seeds 
and a little salt and pepper. Stir to coat in the butter, then toast the flakes 
until golden (this will take about 5 minutes). Drain on a plate lined with 
kitchen paper.

7 Once the squash and freekeh are out of the oven, sprinkle over the toasted 
oats and put in the middle of the table for everyone to dig in.

Turmeric and coconut baked cauliflower

This is my favourite way to eat cauliflower, the sweet note of coconut milk, 
the punch of ginger and green chilli, earthiness from mustard seeds and the 
clean, spiced note of turmeric are soaked up by the vegetable. Other days I 
roast it with lemon, bay and saffron or cover it in a green herb pesto.


Serves 4-6
2 large cauliflowers
4 tbsp coconut oil 
A thumb-sized piece of ginger
4 green chillies
4 garlic cloves
1 tbsp black mustard seeds
2 tsp ground turmeric
Salt and black pepper
400ml tin of coconut milk
1 lemon, halved

 To serve
Thick Greek or coconut yoghurt
Almond flakes, toasted
Small bunch of coriander, leaves picked

1 Set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Boil the kettle. Cut the large leaves 
and stalks away from the cauliflower. Leave the little ones close to the 
florets – they will go nice and crisp when roasted. Turn the cauliflowers 
upside down. Using a small paring knife, carefully cut hollows in the stalks, 
so they cook evenly. Take a saucepan big enough to hold both cauliflowers, 
otherwise do them one at a time. Half fill the pan with water from the kettle, 
then bring to the boil. Add salt, then immerse the cauliflowers and simmer for 
6 minutes. Drain. Put the lid back on. Let the cauliflower steam in the 
residual heat for a further 10 minutes.

2 Take an ovenproof dish or pan (that can go on the hob and in the oven) large 
enough to take the cauliflowers, with just enough room for you to get a spoon 
in to baste. Spoon in the coconut oil, and grate the ginger into the oil. 
Finely chop the chillies, discarding the seeds if you wish, then add to the 
pan. Peel, crush and add the garlic, then put the pan over a moderate heat and 
let the spices and aromatics cook for a few minutes, until fragrant. Stir in 
the mustard seeds. Cook until the garlic has softened, then add the turmeric 
and a big pinch of salt.

3 Pour the coconut milk into the spice mixture, stir well and season with a 
little ground black pepper. When it starts to bubble gently, turn off the heat, 
put the drained cauliflower in the dish, then baste it with the coconut-spice 
mixture. Throw the lemon halves into the side of the dish too.

4 Bake the cauliflower, basting now and then with the spiced sauce in the 
roasting tin, for 40-45 minutes. You want it to catch a little on top. To test 
if the cauliflower is cooked, insert a small sharp knife into the middle: it 
should be really tender. Once it’s perfect, take it out and squeeze over the 
roasted lemons. Serve in the middle of the table with spoonfuls of yoghurt, 
almonds and green herbs for sprinkling on top of your plate.
