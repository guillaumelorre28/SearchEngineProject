So that’s it for another charity Bake Off, and what a lovely hour of telly 
that was. Thank you for reading and for your brilliant comments - I’ll be back 
here for next week’s show, so join me then for more carb-themed mayhem. In the 
meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so feel free to give me a 
wave (cake emoji optional). See you next week!

She’s very happy, I hope this goes some way to compensating for losing 
Strictly to Louis Smith. Or maybe not, it’s only been three years.

So Kimberley to win, surely? I’m not sure Ed will ever get over it. 


And the winner of the Star Baker apron is…KIMBERLEY!

Judging time! Mary loves VCM’s sea, but the boat is more of a life raft. The 
flavour is far too salty, but I can’t take Paul seriously because his tongue 
has gone blue.


Chris’s dead bodyboarder cake gets plenty of laughs, but the sponge is 
beautifully baked and the flavour is one of the best Paul has tasted this year. 
Ed’s cake design is super-impressive and the flavour is great – Mary will be 
trying his double cream sponge method.


Kimberley’s mountain cake looks professional, and is a proper showstopper. The 
cake is delicious too, and Mary loves the yoghurt flavour. Good work Kimberley.

VCM is finished, there’s nothing she can do to save that cake. I’d drink more 
vodka if I were you. Kimberley’s mountain looks like an elephant foot, but I 
love her silhouette animals around the outside. Ed is making the Olympic logo 
out of fruit polos. Time’s UP!

Ed is assembling his ski jump, he’s taking this all very seriously. Chris’s 
bodyboarder is stuck to the board, and VCM’s boat looks like old cheese. 
Chris’s fondant person is now on the cake, but it all looks like a horrible 
bodyboarding accident.

Ed is something of an expert at novelty cakes, we learn. He’s made a 
cheeseburger and an iPad in cake form. Icing is being spread frantically, and 
mostly looks like a huge mess. Chris’s cake is also listing slightly.

Ed appears to making a fondant penis; oh, it’s a snowman. Chris’s fondant 
looks like mustard, so he gets some advice from Kimberley. Ed’s Eddie the 
Easgle looks really good, whilst Chris’s bodyboarder looks like dog poo.


Kimberley’s Mount Kilimanjaro looks great, and VCM is having a panic that her 
cake isn’t looking as exciting as everyone else’s. She sprinkles extra salt on, 
because she is certifiably insane.

Kimberley is making Mount Kilimanjaro in cake form, in memory of her Sport 
Relief climb a few years ago. It sounds quite complicated. Ed is doing a ski 
jump cake, complete with a fondant Eddie The Eagle. He’s going to buttercream 
up the front, back and sides, which is definitely not a euphemism.

Victoria is making a chocolate sea sponge, representing round-the-world 
sailing. As opposed to just general sailing around Lake Windermere or 
something. But let’s go with it.

Ed is putting double cream in his sponge, VCM’s contains salt, and Kimberley’s 
has yoghurt. Chris is making an extreme bodyboarding cake, because riding 
shallow waves on a bit of foam is clearly the most extreme of all the 
water-based sports.

It’s showstopper time! This week our bakers have to make a three-laired cake 
that represents an extreme sport. After last week’s dubious interpretation of 
the showstopper brief, I fully expect a pilates traybake or snooker-themed 
cookies.

Kimberley’s looking good after the first two rounds, and she’s a big 
cake-maker too. Ed wants it bad, but he’s a maverick. Victoria’s a bit random, 
but super-competitive. Let’s not talk about Chris.

Kimberley’s have a “sort of” football on the top. The pastry is nice and thin, 
but they could be a little more baked. The filling needs a bit more seasoning. 
Chris’s pastry has a good colour, but again they’re under-seasoned. VCM’s have 
an attempt at a football on the top, and it’s a nice bake. Paul and Mary like 
the filling too. Ed’s pies are underbaked and have collapsed, and they needed 
more seasoning.

Ed comes fourth, Chris third, Kimberley third and VCM in first place! I’d eat 
all those pies in one go.

So that’s it for another charity Bake Off, and what a lovely hour of telly 
that was. Thank you for reading and for your brilliant comments - I’ll be back 
here for next week’s show, so join me then for more carb-themed mayhem. In the 
meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so feel free to give me a 
wave (cake emoji optional). See you next week!
 
She’s very happy, I hope this goes some way to compensating for losing 
Strictly to Louis Smith. Or maybe not, it’s only been three years.
 
So Kimberley to win, surely? I’m not sure Ed will ever get over it. 


And the winner of the Star Baker apron is…KIMBERLEY! 

 
Judging time! Mary loves VCM’s sea, but the boat is more of a life raft. The 
flavour is far too salty, but I can’t take Paul seriously because his tongue 
has gone blue.


Chris’s dead bodyboarder cake gets plenty of laughs, but the sponge is 
beautifully baked and the flavour is one of the best Paul has tasted this year. 
Ed’s cake design is super-impressive and the flavour is great – Mary will be 
trying his double cream sponge method.


Kimberley’s mountain cake looks professional, and is a proper showstopper. The 
cake is delicious too, and Mary loves the yoghurt flavour. Good work Kimberley.

 
VCM is finished, there’s nothing she can do to save that cake. I’d drink more 
vodka if I were you. Kimberley’s mountain looks like an elephant foot, but I 
love her silhouette animals around the outside. Ed is making the Olympic logo 
out of fruit polos. Time’s UP!
 
Ed is assembling his ski jump, he’s taking this all very seriously. Chris’s 
bodyboarder is stuck to the board, and VCM’s boat looks like old cheese. 
Chris’s fondant person is now on the cake, but it all looks like a horrible 
bodyboarding accident.
 
Ed is something of an expert at novelty cakes, we learn. He’s made a 
cheeseburger and an iPad in cake form. Icing is being spread frantically, and 
mostly looks like a huge mess. Chris’s cake is also listing slightly.
 
Ed appears to making a fondant penis; oh, it’s a snowman. Chris’s fondant 
looks like mustard, so he gets some advice from Kimberley. Ed’s Eddie the 
Easgle looks really good, whilst Chris’s bodyboarder looks like dog poo.


Kimberley’s Mount Kilimanjaro looks great, and VCM is having a panic that her 
cake isn’t looking as exciting as everyone else’s. She sprinkles extra salt on, 
because she is certifiably insane.
 
Kimberley is making Mount Kilimanjaro in cake form, in memory of her Sport 
Relief climb a few years ago. It sounds quite complicated. Ed is doing a ski 
jump cake, complete with a fondant Eddie The Eagle. He’s going to buttercream 
up the front, back and sides, which is definitely not a euphemism.

 
Victoria is making a chocolate sea sponge, representing round-the-world 
sailing. As opposed to just general sailing around Lake Windermere or 
something. But let’s go with it.
 
Ed is putting double cream in his sponge, VCM’s contains salt, and Kimberley’s 
has yoghurt. Chris is making an extreme bodyboarding cake, because riding 
shallow waves on a bit of foam is clearly the most extreme of all the 
water-based sports.
 
It’s showstopper time! This week our bakers have to make a three-laired cake 
that represents an extreme sport. After last week’s dubious interpretation of 
the showstopper brief, I fully expect a pilates traybake or snooker-themed 
cookies.
 
Kimberley’s looking good after the first two rounds, and she’s a big 
cake-maker too. Ed wants it bad, but he’s a maverick. Victoria’s a bit random, 
but super-competitive. Let’s not talk about Chris.
 
Kimberley’s have a “sort of” football on the top. The pastry is nice and thin, 
but they could be a little more baked. The filling needs a bit more seasoning. 
Chris’s pastry has a good colour, but again they’re under-seasoned. VCM’s have 
an attempt at a football on the top, and it’s a nice bake. Paul and Mary like 
the filling too. Ed’s pies are underbaked and have collapsed, and they needed 
more seasoning.

Ed comes fourth, Chris third, Kimberley third and VCM in first place! I’d eat 
all those pies in one go.
