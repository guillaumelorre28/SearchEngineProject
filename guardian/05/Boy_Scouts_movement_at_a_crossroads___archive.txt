Major General Sir R.S.S. Baden-Powell visited Liverpool yesterday in 
connection with the organisation of the Boy Scouts. Addressing a large meeting 
of scoutmasters, military men, clergymen, and others in sympathy with the Boy 
Scouts, he said the movement had grown up of itself at such a tremendous pace 
as to surprise everybody connected with it, and none more than himself.

It needed careful direction if it was to become a permanent institution with a 
really wide influence over the lads, which he thought was what was wanted. They 
must decentralise authority and administration as much as possible, and place 
it in the hands of capable local councils and committees. Let the officers be 
responsible to their own authority for their work, and the movement with 
increased vitality would be able to adapt itself all the better to different 
local conditions as they arose.

The main point was to work shoulder to shoulder with other organisations for 
boys, and not pull against them in any way. They did not want any jealousy or 
rivalry, and he had no doubt that the leaders of the various imitations of the 
Boy Scouts would come to see that their personal ideas must subordinate 
themselves to the whole scheme if it was going to become a big national 
movement.


It had been said that the Boy Scouts were in some cases too military but it 
was not their policy to be a military organisation. Personally he was very much 
against drilling boys and making imitation soldiers of them. The first idea was 
to make the boys good men and citizens. Mere drilling was a destroyer of 
initiative. Again, their religion had been rather cast in their teeth. Some 
said they had no religion, and others that they had too much. They did not want 
to be religious instructors: they left that to the parents and pastors, but 
they did expect every Scout to have a religion, and observe it, although they 
were non-sectarian and did not care what form that religion took. He knew one 
company in which nine religions were represented.


In the evening General Baden-Powell inspected the Liverpool companies of Boy 
Scouts.
