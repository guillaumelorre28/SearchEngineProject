A Journey <https://www.theguardian.com/books/a-journey> is already 
Waterstone's fastest seller ever in the autobiography and biography category. 
The chain said the book had "unprecedented" sales on its release this morning.

"We've never seen anything like this for a political book. It is rewriting 
what we expect this sort of book to achieve," said Andrew Lake, Waterstone's 
politics buyer. By 3pm yesterday, A Journey had sold more copies than Peter 
Mandelson's book, The Third Man, in its first three days. And the chain 
predicted that by the end of the day Tony Blair's book would outsell The Third 
Man's entire first three weeks.

"Mandelson's book was, at the time, the fastest selling political book 
Waterstone's had ever seen, but has now been eclipsed by Blair," said Lake.

"You cannot fault Mandelson's book for timing, marketing and content – it was 
brilliantly done – butTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> has returned to show who 
really is the boss when it comes to New Labour. Mandelson may remain the 
prince, but Blair has reclaimed his title as king."

The chain has the book on sale at half price, £12.50, while it was also 
available on Amazon yesterday at anything from £12.50 to its full price – and 
up to an astounding £99.99.
