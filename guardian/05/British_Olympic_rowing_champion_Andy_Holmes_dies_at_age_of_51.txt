Great Britain's double Olympic champion rower Andy Holmes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-holmes> has died aged 51.

Holmes was part of the coxed four crew, along with Sir Steve Redgrave, that 
claimed gold at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. He then partnered Redgrave to 
victory in the coxless pairs in Seoul four years later.

The Olympics minister, Hugh Robertson, paid tribute to the rower during 
Commons question time. He told MPs Holmes had "sadly passed away at the age of 
51".

Holmes is believed to have died from the rare bacterial disease leptospirosis, 
also called Weil's disease. Leptospirosis can be caught through contact with 
water which contains the urine of infected animals and is notorious among water 
sport athletes.
