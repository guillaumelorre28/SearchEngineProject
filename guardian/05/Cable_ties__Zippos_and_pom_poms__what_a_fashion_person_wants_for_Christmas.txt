Fancy tights and cable ties

Well, I’m sure she’d love a Chanel 2.55 handbag. But unless you are (a) a 
billionaire or (b) being blackmailed, handbags costing two grand probably 
aren’t particularly useful gift suggestions. You could buy her a £95 keyring by 
a fancy designer brand, as suggested by every gift guide ever. But, then again, 
you might as well get two £50 notes and rip them into tiny pieces, for all the 
value that represents.

 Falke tights, £18. 
I’m not going to lie, fashion people can be snobby about brands. Don’t buy a 
cheap handbag or sunglasses. Much better to buy the kind of pretty, 
of-the-moment accessory that doesn’t need to have a fancy label. A fur collar 
in a bright colour, say. A yoga mat. Or – my top tip for this Christmas – a 
pair of fancy tights.Polka-dot sheer tights 
<http://www.falke.com/uk_en/falke-dot-tights-pantyhose-black-40685-3009/>, as 
seen on the Diane von Furstenberg catwalk in New York fashion week, are a quick 
way to update a black party frock for New Year’s Eve. (The 1989 Tatler 
Bystander Pages Party Look, I’m calling it. It’s very now.) They are a sexier 
gift than socks, but not as intimate as knickers.

 Crystal pendant earrings from Mango, £14.99. 
I don’t have a single fashion colleague who isn’t easily impressed by cheap 
jewellery. It appeals to our inner snob. Straight from the “people with money 
buy precious jewels, but people with taste buy fun jewels” school of thought. 
Obviously this creates a massive margin for error, as fun jewels can go 
hideously wrong. So I am going to suggestthese

 from Mango. Specifically. The fact that they come from a lesser referenced 
high street shop will only add to the win.

My other top tip is even cheaper. This Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, there is kudos to be had 
from wearing a grosgrain ribbon in your hair (very Alexa Chung) or around the 
collar of your blouse in a Saint Laurent meets new-era Gucci kinda way. But a 
length of ribbon from the John Lewis haberdashery department doesn’t look like 
much of a gift, so I suggest wrapping any Fashionable’s present in a length of 
black ribbon, then at least if she hates the present and returns it on Boxing 
Day, all is not lost.Imogen Fox

People in fashion are some of the funniest people you’ll ever meet. Honestly.

really the little things that keep you going on a day-to-day basis, which is

 comes in. Yes, it’s ostensibly a silly phone case perfectly sized to ruin the 
pocket-lining of your structured camel coatbut Krusty’s colour scheme is also 
bang-on Gucci AW15 meets seapunk. Which is precisely how you couch in when the 
recipient pulls a face.

and is therefore genius. Don’t worry about the logic, embrace the fluff 
instead. Your fashionable friend will thank you.Lauren Cochrane
