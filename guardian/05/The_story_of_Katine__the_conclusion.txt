The Guardian's media coverage of the Katine project has now finished, but 
Amref decided that it wanted to stay in Katine for a further year to 
consolidate its work with continued funding from Guardian readers and Barclays.

In particular, it wanted extra time to strengthen the community structures on 
which the long-term sustainability of the project depends.

New boreholes will be constructed, with the aim of 85% of the community having 
access to clean water by the end of the fourth year, and Amref also wants to 
increase household latrine coverage from 39% to 75%.

The offices built by Amref, and the small house built by the Guardian for its 
journalists, will be given to Katine as community resources. Several options 
are being considered about how to make the best use of these two buildings.

The Guardian is planning to return to Katine intermittently over the next few 
years to report on how the community fares following Amref's withdrawal. Those 
articles will appear onthe Guardian's new global development website 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development>.

Amref and the Guardian are still working on plans for a form of legacy fund in 
Katine, with the aim of providing the community with a small amount of ongoing 
support.
