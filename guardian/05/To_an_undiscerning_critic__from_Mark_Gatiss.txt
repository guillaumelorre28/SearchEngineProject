With reference to your recent article (Sherlock is slowly and perversely 
morphing into Bond. This cannot stand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/03/sherlock-slowly-perversely-morphing-into-james-bond-benedict-cumberbatch>
, theguardian.com, 3 January), and with apologies to AC Doyle:

Here is a critic who says with low blow 
Sherlock’s no brain-box but become double-O.
Says the Baker St boy is no man of action – 
whilst ignoring the stories that could have put him in traction.

The Solitary Cyclist sees boxing on show, 
The Gloria Scott and The Sign of the Fo’ 
The Empty House too sees a mention, in time, of Mathews, 
who knocked out poor Sherlock’s canine.

As for arts martial, there’s surely a clue 
in the misspelled wrestle Doyle called baritsu. 
In hurling Moriarty over the torrent 
did Sherlock <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sherlock> find violence 
strange and abhorrent?

In shooting down pygmies and Hounds from hell 
Did Sherlock on Victorian niceties dwell? 
When Gruner’s men got him was Holmes quite compliant 
Or did he give good account for The Illustrious Client?

There’s no need to invoke in yarns that still thrill, 
Her Majesty’s Secret Servant with licence to kill 
From Rathbone through Brett to Cumberbatch dandy 
With his fists Mr Holmes has always been handy.
