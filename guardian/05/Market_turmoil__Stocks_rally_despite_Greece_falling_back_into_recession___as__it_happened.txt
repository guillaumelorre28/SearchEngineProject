New York Fed boss cool on negative interest rates

Finally, more on New York Fed president William Dudley playing down talk of 
negative interest rates in the US, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/12/market-turmoil-eurozone-gdp-growth-figures-france-germany-live-updates?page=with:block-56be0165e4b0ae601610a590#block-56be0165e4b0ae601610a590>
 in the wake of Janet Yellen’s comments this week.Edward Helmore writes:

New York Fed president William Dudley has dismissed speculation that the US 
Federal Reserve could adopt negative interest rates as “extraordinarily 
premature”.

Speaking a day after Fed chair Janet Yellen concluded two days of 
congressional testimony during which sheleft open questions 
<http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/feb/09/interest-rates-markets-janet-yellen-briefs-congress>
 on whether the US could follow central banks in Europe and Japan by adopting 
negative rates, Dudley, a voting member on the Fed’s policymaking committee, 
struck an optimistic tone.

He said US households and banks are better able to absorb shocks than they 
were when the last recession hit.

Against a backdrop of supportive US consumer and household debt data released 
Friday, Dudley added US monetary policy remains “quite accommodative” after the 
Fed’s decision to raise interest rates in December.

“Key sectors of the US economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in 
good shape,” he said, repeating Yellen’s assertion that despite market turmoil 
that’s caused the S&P 500 to lose 10% of its value this year, economic 
expansions do not simply “die of old age”.

On that note we’ll close up, and say thanks for all your comments. See you 
again soon.

European markets end a turbulent week on a buoyant note

Worries about a global slowdown, falling oil prices and the effect of negative 
interest rates on banks have combined to produce another traumatic week for 
stock market investors.

But the week ended with sentiment much improved, with European markets showing 
significant gains. Oil jumped on renewed hopes that producers would agree to 
meet to cut output (although we have heard this many times before), which 
helped lift energy companies. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves 
Lansdown said:

Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut 
production. It will need to be a big cut though; some US storage facilities are 
at 90% of capacity with new production still to come online this year.

Banks also came back from their beaten-down levels, after better than expected 
figures from Commerzbank, news that JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon was snapping up the 
bank’s shares and Deutsche Bank’s plan to buy back debt.

Wall Street also helped, moving higher after better than expected US retail 
sales, while there appeared to be no real shocks in the eurozone GDP figures, 
albeitGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> moved back into 
recession.

Investors are already looking ahead to Monday, when Chinese markets re-open 
after a week’s holiday for New Year. Will its stock market move higher or play 
catch up with the falls elsewhere in global markets? With Wall Street closed on 
Monday, it could be another volatile day. Meanwhile the final scores inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> ahead of the weekend showed:

 * The FTSE 100 jumped 3.08% or 170.63 points to 5707.60, its biggest one day 
rise since August 
 * Germany’s Dax added 2.45% to 8967.51 
 * France’s Cac climbed 2.52% to 3995.06 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 4.7% up at 16,514.87 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 2.25% better at 7920.8 
 * In Greece, despite the protests and a slump back into recession, the Athens 
market added 3.04% to 454.29 
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 227 points or 1.4% 
higher.

Despite the current market rally, leading shares still have some way to go to 
mount a major recovery. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:

The week finishes in much better form than it began, with stock markets in 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and the US clawing back 
losses, with even some better US retail sales figures adding to the merry mood. 
European markets in particular can look forward to more positive momentum on 
Monday, when the US is out of action for Presidents Day.

That of course is the short-term picture, and for the FTSE 100 even a 
significant recovery in coming weeks, similar to that seen in January, would 
still leave the market in a firm downward move.

Oil prices have been on another tear higher today, which has provided a firm 
base on which to build the broader stock market rally. However, pessimists (and 
there are many around at the moment) will be quick to point out that there’s 
little sign of an actual meeting between major oil producers, and that Saudi 
intransigence on production cuts remains the chief, and currently insuperable, 
obstacle to tackling the problem of huge oversupply.

At least the banks are doing better today, with both the FTSE banking sector 
and its European counterparts racing away. After all, even if rates aren’t 
going higher, there’s always the hope of more ECB largesse to sweeten the 
outlook somewhat...

The return of China to the market fray after their holiday could also be key 
for further gains, although a couple of days of volatility as they play 
catch-up cannot be ruled out.

US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen floated the idea the bank could look at 
negative rates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/11/market-turmoil-hong-kong-europe-ftse-banks-yellen-live?page=with:block-56bcb022e4b0d007e4723bd9#block-56bcb022e4b0d007e4723bd9>
in her testimony to Congress this week.

But one of her colleagues is not so sure. New York Fed President William 
Dudley said negative rates elsewhere - ie in Japan andEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> - would have little effect on 
the US economy, reports Reuters, adding that negative rates “should not be part 
of the conversation right now in the US.”

He also said US bank were in good shape despite the share price falls in the 
sector in recent days.

Negative interest rates should help lift growth and inflation but if the 
market turmoil continues, the economic consequences could outweigh the benefits
, says Michael Pearce at Capital Economics. He says:

In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth 
and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, 
and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined 
confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good.

Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in 
particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim 
that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have 
focused on three main concerns.

 * First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, 
harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new 
loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European 
economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around €3bn a 
year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for 
their profitability either... 
 * The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the 
latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as 
a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can 
operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are 
competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will 
be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth. 
 * Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to 
the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are 
running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, 
market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response 
because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered 
further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central 
bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could 
go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims 
that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there 
is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing. Facebook

The US consumer confidence figures are not too bad under the circumstances, 
reckons James Knightley at ING Bank:

US consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan dipped to 
90.7 in February versus 92.0 in January. This is a bit weaker than the 92.3 
consensus, but isn’t too bad given the scale of equity market sell-off.

Indeed, strong employment gains, rising real incomes and a firm housing market 
are providing enough offsetting effects for now and with retail sales having 
come in stronger than expected (when upward revisions are included) it looks a 
reasonably encouraging consumer spending story for now.

However, equity markets don’t seem particularly interested unfortunately and 
the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into 
the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions.

And after the US retail sales, here is some less positive news in terms of 
consumer confidence.

The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has missed expectations 
with a fall from 92 in December to 90.7. The consensus forecast was for a 
reading of 92 for January. The index of consumers expectations fell from 82.7 
to 81, a four month low.

Meanwhile business inventories rose 0.1%, in line with forecasts.

Oil continues to rebound, on renewed hope of production cuts to stem the 
supply glut.

Apparently helping the rally were reported comments from United Arab Emirates 
oil minister Suhail Al Mazrouei that producers were ready to work together.

But we have been here many times before, and he was also reported as saying 
that there would be no cuts unless there was full co-operation among producers.

There have been several optimistic reports suggesting Opec might be ready to 
talk to other producers such as Russia about limiting output, but so far no 
real progress.

Nevertheless, Brent crude is now up 5% at $31.59 a barrel while West Texas 
Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 6% better at $27.79.

And that is one of the factors helping to support stock markets as they bounce 
back from recent lows.

Another cut in the European Central Bank’s deposit rate in March has strong 
support among the central bank’s governing council, Reuters is reporting.

Any cut could come as part of a broader package including some changes to the 
bank’s asset purchase programme, but there is little appetite for more radical 
action . Reuters says markets are pricing in at least two rate cuts by the end 
of the year, taking the deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.55%.

Banking groups are unlikely to be happy, since their shares have been hammered 
this week by fears about the effects of the wave of negative rates on their 
balance sheets and margins.

Reuters reports one policymaker as saying: “Cutting the deposit rate by more 
than 10 basis points would hurt bank profitability, not a popular idea right 
now, especially given what’s happening in the banking sector.”

Wall Street opens higher

With markets elsewhere moving ahead after the recent turmoil (the Nikkei was 
the exception), the US has joined in the more optimistic mood.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 140 points or 0.9% while the S&P 500 
opened 0.6% higher and the Nasdaq added 1%. Energy and financial stocks were 
among the early gainers.

The US retail sales show consumer spending remains important to the country’s 
economy but the key question is how it will cope with the global problems, says 
Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management:

Consumer spending has played a starring role in supporting growth in the US’ 
service-led economy, and the latest retail figures suggest this is set to 
continue. Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer 
benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market 
continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn’t been shaken, all of 
which bodes well for the domestic economy.

What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in 
the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the 
stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are 
spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing 
volatility. Equally, the dollar has been strengthening due to the robustness – 
until recently – of the US recovery and the Fed’s decision to hike rates in 
December. However, it does drag down exports and adds to the already widening 
trade deficit. While it’s not yet a case of stunting US growth, all eyes will 
remain on Yellen to soothe where she can. For now, as hinted in her testimony 
to Congress, she’ll continue to put any immediate rates rise on hold.

Finally, more on New York Fed president William Dudley playing down talk of 
negative interest rates in the US, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/12/market-turmoil-eurozone-gdp-growth-figures-france-germany-live-updates?page=with:block-56be0165e4b0ae601610a590#block-56be0165e4b0ae601610a590>
 in the wake of Janet Yellen’s comments this week.Edward Helmore writes:

New York Fed president William Dudley has dismissed speculation that the US 
Federal Reserve could adopt negative interest rates as “extraordinarily 
premature”.

Speaking a day after Fed chair Janet Yellen concluded two days of 
congressional testimony during which sheleft open questions 
<http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/feb/09/interest-rates-markets-janet-yellen-briefs-congress>
 on whether the US could follow central banks in Europe and Japan by adopting 
negative rates, Dudley, a voting member on the Fed’s policymaking committee, 
struck an optimistic tone.

He said US households and banks are better able to absorb shocks than they 
were when the last recession hit.

Against a backdrop of supportive US consumer and household debt data released 
Friday, Dudley added US monetary policy remains “quite accommodative” after the 
Fed’s decision to raise interest rates in December.

“Key sectors of the US economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in 
good shape,” he said, repeating Yellen’s assertion that despite market turmoil 
that’s caused the S&P 500 to lose 10% of its value this year, economic 
expansions do not simply “die of old age”.

Worries about a global slowdown, falling oil prices and the effect of negative 
interest rates on banks have combined to produce another traumatic week for 
stock market investors.

But the week ended with sentiment much improved, with European markets showing 
significant gains. Oil jumped on renewed hopes that producers would agree to 
meet to cut output (although we have heard this many times before), which 
helped lift energy companies. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves 
Lansdown said:

Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut 
production. It will need to be a big cut though; some US storage facilities are 
at 90% of capacity with new production still to come online this year.

Banks also came back from their beaten-down levels, after better than expected 
figures from Commerzbank, news that JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon was snapping up the 
bank’s shares and Deutsche Bank’s plan to buy back debt.

Wall Street also helped, moving higher after better than expected US retail 
sales, while there appeared to be no real shocks in the eurozone GDP figures, 
albeitGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> moved back into 
recession.

Investors are already looking ahead to Monday, when Chinese markets re-open 
after a week’s holiday for New Year. Will its stock market move higher or play 
catch up with the falls elsewhere in global markets? With Wall Street closed on 
Monday, it could be another volatile day. Meanwhile the final scores inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> ahead of the weekend showed:

 * The FTSE 100 jumped 3.08% or 170.63 points to 5707.60, its biggest one day 
rise since August 
 * Germany’s Dax added 2.45% to 8967.51 
 * France’s Cac climbed 2.52% to 3995.06 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 4.7% up at 16,514.87 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 2.25% better at 7920.8 
 * In Greece, despite the protests and a slump back into recession, the Athens 
market added 3.04% to 454.29 
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 227 points or 1.4% 
higher.

Deutsche of course had been hit by worries about its balance sheet and the 
effect of negative interest rates, like others in the sector, as well as 
pressure on itscontingent convertible bonds. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/market-turmoil-what-are-cocos-banks-bonds>

But along with the recovery in bank shares, Deutsche has also been lifted by

The FTSE 100 has jumped 3.08%, its biggest one day rise since 27 August.

As of Thursday, some £80bn had been wiped off the UK’s leading index.

More on oil:

<https://twitter.com/humenm/status/698177329995128832>  
Despite the current market rally, leading shares still have some way to go to 
mount a major recovery. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:

The week finishes in much better form than it began, with stock markets in 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and the US clawing back 
losses, with even some better US retail sales figures adding to the merry mood. 
European markets in particular can look forward to more positive momentum on 
Monday, when the US is out of action for Presidents Day.

That of course is the short-term picture, and for the FTSE 100 even a 
significant recovery in coming weeks, similar to that seen in January, would 
still leave the market in a firm downward move.

Oil prices have been on another tear higher today, which has provided a firm 
base on which to build the broader stock market rally. However, pessimists (and 
there are many around at the moment) will be quick to point out that there’s 
little sign of an actual meeting between major oil producers, and that Saudi 
intransigence on production cuts remains the chief, and currently insuperable, 
obstacle to tackling the problem of huge oversupply.

At least the banks are doing better today, with both the FTSE banking sector 
and its European counterparts racing away. After all, even if rates aren’t 
going higher, there’s always the hope of more ECB largesse to sweeten the 
outlook somewhat...

The return of China to the market fray after their holiday could also be key 
for further gains, although a couple of days of volatility as they play 
catch-up cannot be ruled out.
 
US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen floated the idea the bank could look at 
negative rates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/11/market-turmoil-hong-kong-europe-ftse-banks-yellen-live?page=with:block-56bcb022e4b0d007e4723bd9#block-56bcb022e4b0d007e4723bd9>
in her testimony to Congress this week.

But one of her colleagues is not so sure. New York Fed President William 
Dudley said negative rates elsewhere - ie in Japan andEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> - would have little effect on 
the US economy, reports Reuters, adding that negative rates “should not be part 
of the conversation right now in the US.”

He also said US bank were in good shape despite the share price falls in the 
sector in recent days.

Negative interest rates should help lift growth and inflation but if the 
market turmoil continues, the economic consequences could outweigh the benefits
, says Michael Pearce at Capital Economics. He says:

In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth 
and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, 
and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined 
confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good.

Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in 
particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim 
that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have 
focused on three main concerns.

 * First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, 
harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new 
loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European 
economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around €3bn a 
year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for 
their profitability either... 
 * The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the 
latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as 
a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can 
operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are 
competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will 
be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth. 
 * Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to 
the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are 
running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, 
market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response 
because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered 
further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central 
bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could 
go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims 
that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there 
is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing.  
The University of Michigan survey suggests a falling outlook for inflation:

The US consumer confidence figures are not too bad under the circumstances, 
reckons James Knightley at ING Bank:

US consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan dipped to 
90.7 in February versus 92.0 in January. This is a bit weaker than the 92.3 
consensus, but isn’t too bad given the scale of equity market sell-off.

Indeed, strong employment gains, rising real incomes and a firm housing market 
are providing enough offsetting effects for now and with retail sales having 
come in stronger than expected (when upward revisions are included) it looks a 
reasonably encouraging consumer spending story for now.

However, equity markets don’t seem particularly interested unfortunately and 
the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into 
the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions.

slump. Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters  
And after the US retail sales, here is some less positive news in terms of 
consumer confidence.

The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has missed expectations 
with a fall from 92 in December to 90.7. The consensus forecast was for a 
reading of 92 for January. The index of consumers expectations fell from 82.7 
to 81, a four month low.

Meanwhile business inventories rose 0.1%, in line with forecasts.
 
Oil continues to rebound, on renewed hope of production cuts to stem the 
supply glut.

Apparently helping the rally were reported comments from United Arab Emirates 
oil minister Suhail Al Mazrouei that producers were ready to work together.

But we have been here many times before, and he was also reported as saying 
that there would be no cuts unless there was full co-operation among producers.

There have been several optimistic reports suggesting Opec might be ready to 
talk to other producers such as Russia about limiting output, but so far no 
real progress.

Nevertheless, Brent crude is now up 5% at $31.59 a barrel while West Texas 
Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 6% better at $27.79.

And that is one of the factors helping to support stock markets as they bounce 
back from recent lows.
 
Another cut in the European Central Bank’s deposit rate in March has strong 
support among the central bank’s governing council, Reuters is reporting.

Any cut could come as part of a broader package including some changes to the 
bank’s asset purchase programme, but there is little appetite for more radical 
action . Reuters says markets are pricing in at least two rate cuts by the end 
of the year, taking the deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.55%.

Banking groups are unlikely to be happy, since their shares have been hammered 
this week by fears about the effects of the wave of negative rates on their 
balance sheets and margins.

Reuters reports one policymaker as saying: “Cutting the deposit rate by more 
than 10 basis points would hurt bank profitability, not a popular idea right 
now, especially given what’s happening in the banking sector.”

With markets elsewhere moving ahead after the recent turmoil (the Nikkei was 
the exception), the US has joined in the more optimistic mood.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 140 points or 0.9% while the S&P 500 
opened 0.6% higher and the Nasdaq added 1%. Energy and financial stocks were 
among the early gainers.

The US retail sales show consumer spending remains important to the country’s 
economy but the key question is how it will cope with the global problems, says 
Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management:

Consumer spending has played a starring role in supporting growth in the US’ 
service-led economy, and the latest retail figures suggest this is set to 
continue. Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer 
benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market 
continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn’t been shaken, all of 
which bodes well for the domestic economy.

What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in 
the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the 
stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are 
spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing 
volatility. Equally, the dollar has been strengthening due to the robustness – 
until recently – of the US recovery and the Fed’s decision to hike rates in 
December. However, it does drag down exports and adds to the already widening 
trade deficit. While it’s not yet a case of stunting US growth, all eyes will 
remain on Yellen to soothe where she can. For now, as hinted in her testimony 
to Congress, she’ll continue to put any immediate rates rise on hold.
 
Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said the US retail sales showed 
some positive signs:

With US data on the whole far from convincing following the interest rate 
rise, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be pleased with the green shoots shown in 
today’s retail sales figures.

Any positive figure is a step in the right direction, and onlookers still 
await an uptick in consumer activity prompted by continuing low fuel and energy 
prices.

Yellen will still be wary given that the numbers have been given a leg-up from 
the holiday season, and she should expect there to be further strain on the US 
economy in the coming months.
