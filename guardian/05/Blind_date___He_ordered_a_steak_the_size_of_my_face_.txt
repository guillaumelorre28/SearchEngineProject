Dan on Andre

What were you hoping for?
A three-course dinner and a bottle of house red.


First impressions?
A fantastically dry wit, a nice smile and very good at speed ordering.

What did you talk about?
Our grandparents, his LGBT football team and our love of cycling while 
inebriated.

Any awkward moments?
He ordered a steak the size of my face and couldn’t finish it, so promptly 
offloaded some of it on to my plate.

Good table manners?
He let me order the whiskey like a true gent.

Best thing about Andre?
His singing.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Yeah, of course – he’d get along with them.

Describe him in three words
Eloquent, witty, driven.

What do you think he made of you?
Someone who steals toilet paper from work (I don’t!).

Did you go on somewhere?
No. We both had work off the next day, so maybe we should have...

And... did you kiss?
Just a hug.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I would have preferred it if all of his friends weren’t Whatsapping him about 
how our date was going!

Marks out of 10?
8.5.

Would you meet again?
We’ve planned a rendezvous at Horse Meat Disco, but probably just as mates.

Andre on Dan

First impressions?
Relaxed and smiley.

What did you talk about?
Sadiq Khan, Saabs and nightclubbing on your own.

Any awkward moments?
My shoe broke as I entered the restaurant, but I don’t think he noticed.

Good table manners?
He sat very patiently as I desperately tried to finish a steak the size of my 
face.

Best thing about Dan?
He’s got a good vibe.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Without hesitation.
