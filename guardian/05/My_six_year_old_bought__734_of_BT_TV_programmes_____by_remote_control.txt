I have a severely autistic six-year-old who got hold of the TV remote and 
bought £734 of kids’ programmes on my BT account.BT 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/btgroup> refuses to waive the charges, 
although I have never purchased any programme during my five years as a 
customer. It has given me two weeks to pay but, as a single parent, I can’t 
afford this.HT, Mirfield, W Yorks

You say your child managed to order 40 programmes in 10 minutes, so it’s 
disappointing that BT didn’t flag up unusual usage in the same way that banks 
do. It has now agreed to cancel the charges as a goodwill gesture.

You now need to ensure that future payments via the remote are protected by 
the pin you chose when you first subscribed so this can’t happen again.
