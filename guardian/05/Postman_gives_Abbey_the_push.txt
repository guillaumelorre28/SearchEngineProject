When his sorting office moved from Birmingham city centre to just inside 
Spaghetti Junction, postman Devindra Mistry could no longer nip to Abbey 
National in his lunch hour. So he started doing his banking on Saturdays at the 
Five Ways branch near his home.

Problem solved - until a couple of months ago when the new manager announced 
the branch would no longer be open on a Saturday morning. Mistry felt so 
strongly about the inconvenience of having to traipse down to the much busier 
city centre branch that he started a petition. Despite securing the objections 
of around 80 other customers, 'we weren't important enough', he says and the 
closure went ahead as planned.

Mistry felt annoyed but it wasn't until Abbey National announced its Â£5 charge 
for paying bills over the counter that he decided to take his business 
elsewhere. 'It was the final straw. I'd been loyal to Abbey National for 27 
years but it didn't seem to matter to them.'

He now has a charge-free account with the Nationwide, which is open until 4pm 
on a Saturday.
