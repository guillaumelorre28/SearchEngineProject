This hearty soup does the warming and tasty thing that all winter soups should 
do. It has the perfect colour to brighten up winter days, and with such 
vibrancy also comes a whack of antioxidants. Pour in a vacuum flask for a 
lunchtime treat, and save the rest for later – the leftovers last for 3–4 days 
in the fridge.

Serves 4 

500g/4 medium raw beetroot, grated
2 tbsp butter
1 tsp caraway or cumin seeds
2 medium onions, roughly chopped
2 bramley apples, peeled and quartered
1 litre stock, light chicken or vegetable
2 star anise
Greek yoghurt
A few chives, chopped
Salt and black pepper

1. Put a wide, heavy-based pan with a lid on a medium heat and melt 
the butter, then add the seeds. Sweat the onions with the spices, 
keeping the lid on and being careful not to let them colour.

2. Tip in the grated beetroot and stir well. Slice the core out of all the 
apple quarters, chuck the apple in too and put the lid back on.

3. Fry for about 10-15 minutes until the beetroot strands begin to soften.

4. Pour in the stock, turn the heat up, drop the star anise in with some 
seasoning and put the lid back on. Once it has come to the boil, turn down the 
heat and simmer for 5 minutes.

5. Pick out the star anise and throw it away, then blitz the soup in a blender 
until pureed. Finish the soup with a splodge of Greek yoghurt and some chopped 
chives.
