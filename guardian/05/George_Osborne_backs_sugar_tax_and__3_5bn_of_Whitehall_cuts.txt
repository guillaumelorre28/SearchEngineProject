George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> has placed 
a tax on sugary drinks at the centre of his budget, as he sought to mask a 
significant downgrade to Britain’s economic potential with a flurry of 
initiatives and giveaways to small businesses, motorists and savers.

Delivering his final budget before voters decide whether Britain should remain 
a member of the European Union on 23 June, the chancellor said he would seek to 
“put the next generation first” and introduced a proposal for a sugar levy that 
was welcomed by TV chef and food campaigner Jamie Oliver.

The tax on sugary drinks, which will take effect in two years’ time, will 
apply to drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, with a higher rate 
applying above 8g per 100ml, and is aimed at persuading manufacturers to 
reformulate their recipes to cut sugar levels.

Osborne said: “I am not prepared to look back at my time here in this 
parliament doing this job, and say to my children’s generation, ‘I’m sorry, we 
knew there was a problem with sugary drinks, we knew it caused disease, but we 
ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing.’”

The sugar tax was the most eye-catching measure in a statement that was 
described by the independent Office forBudget 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget> Responsibility chairman Robert Chote as 
“eventful by any standards”.

Osborne announced a subsidised “lifetime ISA” for the under-40s; tax cuts for 
small businesses; and significant new devolution plans which will bring elected 
mayors to new regions, including south-west England and the east of England.

George Osborne's budget is for the very short term only

But the overarching message of the OBR’s assessment of the economy was that 
Britain’s productivity - the key to future economic growth - has been dealt a 
permanent blow by the financial crisis that ripped through the global economy 
in 2008-09 and sent the UK plunging into recession.

Chote said: “In the short time since our November forecast, economic 
developments have disappointed relative to expectations and the outlook for the 
economy and the public finances looks materially weaker.”

The OBR downgraded its forecast for growth in 2016 to 2%, from 2.4% in its 
last outlook in November. Even by 2020, it is expected to be growing at a pace 
of just 2.1%, well below the rate that was previously regarded as the economy’s 
long-term trend.

Combined with the slower-than-expected pace of changes to disability benefits, 
Chote said the deficit was, on average, £11bn larger over the next five years 
than it had previously expected. “Weaker potential output growth in turn means 
weaker growth in spending and incomes and a significant loss of tax revenue,” 
he said.

Osborne still expects to deliver a surplus on the public finances by 2019-20, 
but the smallprint of his budget documents showed that he can only do so by 
forcing Whitehall departments to make as-yet unspecified spending cuts of 
£3.5bn a year; and delaying plans to bring forward corporation tax payments for 
big businesses.

In the short term, though, the budget was packed with giveaways. Under-40s 
will be able to save up to £4,000 a year tax-free in a new lifetime ISA and 
receive a top-up of £1,000 a year from the Treasury. They will be able to 
continue saving until they are 50 and then choose whether to withdraw the cash 
to fund the deposit for a house or keep it for retirement.

Osborne said: “This is a budget that gets investors investing, savers saving, 
businesses doing business, so that we build for working people a low-tax, 
enterprise Britain, secure at home, strong in the world.”


He insisted that the spending cuts he had pencilled in for the end of this 
parliament would help to shore up the economy. “Financial markets are 
turbulent. Productivity growth across the west is too low. And the outlook for 
the global economy is weak. It makes for a dangerous cocktail of risks. But one 
that Britain is well-prepared to handle, if we act now so we don’t pay later.”

A radical shakeup of the tax system for companies will result in larger firms 
paying up to £9bn more each year, while small firms receive a £7bn cut, as part 
of what the chancellor called a road map towards a fairer system. Capital gains 
tax will be also be cut, from 28% to 20%, to “put rocket boosters on the backs 
of enterprise and productive investment”.

Osborne described the new approach, which includes increasing the threshold 
for business rates, as “a £7bn tax cut for our nation of shopkeepers. A tax 
system that says to the world: we’re open for business. A government that’s on 
your side.”

A barrage of anti tax-avoidance measures, plus levying gambling tax on the 
“free bets” given by bookmakers and forcing employers to pay national insurance 
contributions on staff redundancy payments over £30,000, are slated to bring in 
almost £3bn a year by 2019-10, although the OBR pointed out that the revenue 
from the anti-tax avoidance measures could be uncertain.

The chancellor said he would press ahead with fulfilling the Conservatives’ 
manifesto promises to move the personal tax allowance towards £12,500 by 2020 
and to increase the threshold at which employees pay the higher rate of income 
tax towards £50,000.

Jeremy Corbyn blasts budget: the culmination of George Osborne’s failures – 
video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/mar/16/jeremy-corbyn-blasts-budget-the-culmination-of-george-osbornes-failures-video>
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, responding to Osborne, accused him of 
delivering a budget with “unfairness at its very core”.

“The budget the chancellor has just delivered is actually the culmination of 
six years of his failures,” he said as deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle intervened 
to discourage Tory MPs from heckling him.

Corbyn went on: “It’s a recovery built on sand on a budget of failure. He’s 
failed on the budget deficit, failed on debt, failed on investment, failed on 
productivity, failed on trade deficit, failed on the welfare cap, failed to 
tackle inequality in this country.”
