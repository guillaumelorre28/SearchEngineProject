They dance their final dance to ‘Yesterday’, which is a song about when this 
was actually filmed. They give it their own personal spin with some Running Man 
and disco moves, which probably would have kept them out of the dance-off. Oh 
the irony.

So that’s it for Strictly Week 2! Next week it’s MOVIE WEEK, so let’s endure 
it together from 6.45pm next Saturday. In the meantime you can find me on 
Twitter @heidistephens, so feel free to swing by and give me a wave. Thanks for 
joining in, and have a brilliant week! Hx

Ooh, TWIST! Anastacia and Brendan aren’t going to dance again, so the 
dance-off has been cancelled. So instead the public vote is deciding who is 
going home, and it’s….MELVIN AND JANETTE! 

I think that was the right way to do it, and the right decision in the end, as 
Melvin was the weakest dancer on the night. And on the upside, Janette now has 
all the time in the world to plan her wedding to Aljaz. Every cloud, eh?

Next week is Movie Week! It’s my least favourite of all the theme weeks, and 
of course it has a rubbish trailer. Judge Rinder is going to be a Flintstone, 
but he doesn’t say which one. Wilma? Pebbles?

So who else is in this week’s Really Uncomfortable Dance Off? Judge Rinder and 
Oksana are safely through to next week, along with Danny and Oti, Laura and 
Giovanni, Claudia and AJ, Ore and Joanne, Ed and Katya (YES) and Naga and Pasha!

So that means Melvin and Janette are in the Dance Off! This is going to be 
awful, how are the judges going to decide?

So who is safe, and who is in tonight’s Dance Off? Tameka and Gorka are safe, 
along with Greg and Natalie, Louise and Kevin, Daisy and Aljaz, Will and Karen 
(yay #justiceforwill) and Lesley and Anton.

The first couple in the dance-off is…Anastacia and Brendan!

OH NO. This is bad. Are they really going to make her dance again? This is not 
a dance-off I want to see at all.

Goodness – turns out Anastacia’s injury last night was torn scar tissue from 
her mastectomy. That sounds awful, hope she’s able to continue.

Last night on Strictly: some pretty decent dancing, all told. My mum came over 
for lunch today and is not happy about how good everyone is, it spoils the 
‘journey’ for her and means the non-dancers get hoofed out too early. Thoughts?

Highlights for me included Claudia and AJ’s whirling, Ore’s anorak, Ed’s 
banjo, Tameka’s swimsuit and Oti’s silver dress. Lowlights included Greg’s bum, 
Daisy’s cupcake costume, Louise’s lampshade, Rinder’s slapstick, Lesley’s 
grinding and the overall lack of training footage.

Pro dance time! Gorka’s on Spanish guitar, Oskana is contempo-wafting in a 
white hankie. An amateur production of Chicago provides the backing dance, 
while someone sings a half-arsed cover of Zayn’s Pillowtalk at a really weird 
tempo. Fin.

This year’s Countryfile calender has a fat mouse on the cover. I almost bought 
the 2016 one with the hedgehog cover, but opted to buy a filthy Gleb calendar 
instead.

They dance their final dance to ‘Yesterday’, which is a song about when this 
was actually filmed. They give it their own personal spin with some Running Man 
and disco moves, which probably would have kept them out of the dance-off. Oh 
the irony.

So that’s it for Strictly Week 2! Next week it’s MOVIE WEEK, so let’s endure 
it together from 6.45pm next Saturday. In the meantime you can find me on 
Twitter @heidistephens, so feel free to swing by and give me a wave. Thanks for 
joining in, and have a brilliant week! Hx
 
Ooh, TWIST! Anastacia and Brendan aren’t going to dance again, so the 
dance-off has been cancelled. So instead the public vote is deciding who is 
going home, and it’s….MELVIN AND JANETTE! 

I think that was the right way to do it, and the right decision in the end, as 
Melvin was the weakest dancer on the night. And on the upside, Janette now has 
all the time in the world to plan her wedding to Aljaz. Every cloud, eh?
 
Next week is Movie Week! It’s my least favourite of all the theme weeks, and 
of course it has a rubbish trailer. Judge Rinder is going to be a Flintstone, 
but he doesn’t say which one. Wilma? Pebbles?
 
So who else is in this week’s Really Uncomfortable Dance Off? Judge Rinder and 
Oksana are safely through to next week, along with Danny and Oti, Laura and 
Giovanni, Claudia and AJ, Ore and Joanne, Ed and Katya (YES) and Naga and Pasha!

So that means Melvin and Janette are in the Dance Off! This is going to be 
awful, how are the judges going to decide?
 
Time for Len’s Lens! Just popping the kettle on.
 
Barry Gibb is on! Daughter has just asked “who is this, and is he singing or 
gasping for breath?” Harsh.

Ooh, Ralph Fiennes on drums!
 
In next week’s Movie Week, Daisy is going to be Mary Poppins. So that’s nice.
 
So who is safe, and who is in tonight’s Dance Off? Tameka and Gorka are safe, 
along with Greg and Natalie, Louise and Kevin, Daisy and Aljaz, Will and Karen 
(yay #justiceforwill) and Lesley and Anton.

The first couple in the dance-off is…Anastacia and Brendan!

OH NO. This is bad. Are they really going to make her dance again? This is not 
a dance-off I want to see at all.
 
Ooh, I’d forgotten about Laura and Giovanni’s Waltz. It was proper dreamy.
 
Goodness – turns out Anastacia’s injury last night was torn scar tissue from 
her mastectomy. That sounds awful, hope she’s able to continue.

 
Last night on Strictly: some pretty decent dancing, all told. My mum came over 
for lunch today and is not happy about how good everyone is, it spoils the 
‘journey’ for her and means the non-dancers get hoofed out too early. Thoughts?

Highlights for me included Claudia and AJ’s whirling, Ore’s anorak, Ed’s 
banjo, Tameka’s swimsuit and Oti’s silver dress. Lowlights included Greg’s bum, 
Daisy’s cupcake costume, Louise’s lampshade, Rinder’s slapstick, Lesley’s 
grinding and the overall lack of training footage.
 
Tess and Claudia Dress Watch: Tess in a one-shouldered horror in a really 
unflattering length, Claudia in a weird lace thing. 2/10.
 
Pro dance time! Gorka’s on Spanish guitar, Oskana is contempo-wafting in a 
white hankie. An amateur production of Chicago provides the backing dance, 
while someone sings a half-arsed cover of Zayn’s Pillowtalk at a really weird 
tempo. Fin.
 
Oh lord, The Apprentice is back. Does anyone still watch it? It was fun to 
liveblog back in the day. Ooh, Strictly’s starting!
 
This year’s Countryfile calender has a fat mouse on the cover. I almost bought 
the 2016 one with the hedgehog cover, but opted to buy a filthy Gleb calendar 
instead.

 
 It’s nearly time for Strictly, so only a few more minutes to endure Anita 
wanging on about hops with some Surrey ale bores.
