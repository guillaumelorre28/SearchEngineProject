Gas <https://www.theguardian.com/business/gas> supplies in Australia will be 
expanded and suppliers forced to publish previously secret prices under reforms 
agreed to by state and federal ministers at the Coag energy council meeting in 
Canberra.

All states except Victoria, which has a blanket ban on coal seam gas, agreed 
to focus on expanding onshore gas activities. The state government in Melbourne 
agreed to consider its position.

The federal environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said after 
Friday’s meeting that thecurrent practice of secret gas deals

 would be banned.

Blocking the sale of Ausgrid was a poor decision and will cost Australia dear

“Going forward, we want new gas contracts to be transparent. That is a very 
significant change,” he said. “We’ll have a bulletin board that will publish 
the prices of the gas contracts that have been agreed.”

The comments follow an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report 
in April 
<https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/release-of-east-coast-gas-inquiry-report-into-the-increasingly-complex-and-uncertain-gas-market>
 that found that industrial users received offers “at sharply higher prices and 
on strict take-it-or-leave-it terms”.

The details of how the new system would work will be the job of a gas market 
reform group, headed by Michael Vertigan, which will be required to find ways 
to increase both gas supply and suppliers.

“These are the most significant reforms to the domestic gas market in two 
decades,” Frydenberg said in a statement.


Frydenberg said the council also agreed to examine ways to “ensure consumers 
can confidently take advantage of new technologies such as battery storage 
through the introduction of appropriate consumer protections”.

The council “recognised the growing importance of gas as a transition fuel as 
we move to incorporate more renewables into the system”.

Olivia Kember from the Climate Institute described the meeting as a “missed 
opportunity”.

“In considering the impact of climate and clean energy developments on the 
electricity system, we need to think beyond the current 2030 emissions target 
to deliver a well-managed transition to zero emission electricity,” she said.

Managing the closure of the dirty power generators was also something the 
council should have dealt with, Kember said.

“As we saw in South Australia, disorderly, unplanned closures can have bad 
consequences for the local community, energy users and the stability of the 
market as a whole,” she said.

Dylan McConnell from the Melbourne Energy Institute told Guardian Australia 
that the focus on gas seemed misplaced. “We actually have plenty of gas,it’s 
just all being exported

,” he said.

“I am yet to be convinced that increased local supply will necessarily 
dramatic impact on prices, unless there is a gas reservation policy, which 
seems to be unpopular with just about everyone.”

He said the focus on gas as a “transition fuel” was also an outdated idea and 
not consistent with climate change targets.

“Gas may have a role in balancing variable renewables such as wind and solar 
PV – but will have to compete with storage including but not limited to pumped 
hydro, concentrating solar thermal and battery storage,” he said. “If it does 
have a balancing role, it will actually not produce much energy, operating in 
‘peak’ mode, when required, but only for small periods of time. As such, the 
demand for gas to fire the turbine shouldn’t actually be very high.”
