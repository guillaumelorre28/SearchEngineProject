It feels like a long time since economy-watchers were gripped by the saga 
about how long Mark Carney would stay at theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor>. In fact it was 
only two weeks ago that the governor agreed to extend his term by a year to 
2019 after an apparent attempt by various Conservatives to drive him out as 
soon as possible.

His critics were emboldened by Theresa May’s criticism of recent monetary 
policy in her conference speech, but in the end May needed Carney – and his 
decision came across as if he’d granted the prime minister another year of his 
time.

When he took the job in 2013, Carney said he would only serve five years of 
the usual eight-year term, but – after enduring barbs from William Hague, 
Michael Gove and other Tories – leaving as planned in 2018 could have looked 
like flouncing out.

Andrew Tyrie, the indefatigable chairman of the Treasury committee, wants to 
know more and will get his chance on Tuesday when Carney and other BoE 
rate-setters appear before MPs. The session will also pit the governor once 
more against his most personal critic, the anachronistic Tory backbencher Jacob 
Rees-Mogg, who was bizarrely touted as a potential replacement for Carney. The 
governor could barely hide his irritation at Rees-Mogg during previous 
committee sessions, so Tuesday should be fun.

May’s governance moment

The word on the corporate governance grapevine is that this could be the week 
the government publishes its proposals for holding companies to account.

In her pitch for the Tory leadership, Theresa May said she would put worker 
and consumer representatives on boards and impose binding votes on bosses’ pay. 
May repeated the pledge in her conference speech last month, setting herself up 
as the champion of working people left behind by globalisation. But lobbyists 
have been working away at the government, suggesting weaker alternatives to 
employees on boards such as workers’ councils, or giving a director the job of 
sounding out the workforce.

If that happens, the City and the government could have a hard time since 
Donald Trump’s victory reinforced the idea that disenfranchised workers are in 
revolt. Unions and other supporters of reform could reasonably argue May has 
been got at by big business just when she should be sticking to her promises. 
The government has said only that the proposals will come before Christmas, so 
we may have to wait a bit longer: but the speculation shows how exercised 
investors are about the matter.

Troubled vintage at Majestic?


When Rowan Gormley arrived at Majestic Wine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/majestic-wine> in April 2015 he was 
greeted as a saviour after years of recurring disappointments at Britain’s 
biggest independent wine merchant.

Majestic, which reports half-year results on Thursday, brought Gormley in 
along with his Naked Wines business and his ideas made sense. He scrapped the 
offputting six-bottle minimum purchase and set about livening up shops and 
products and giving staff more time to talk to customers. But things have got 
gloomier this year. The shares lost a quarter of their value in one day in 
September when Gormley unveiled a profit warning caused by a failed US 
marketing campaign and weak sales to business customers.

Perhaps more worrying for Majestic in the long run is the big fall in the 
pound since the vote for Brexit. English wines may be increasingly popular, but 
almost all Majestic’s stock comes from France, Australia and other countries 
whose goods have become more expensive. Gormley has said cost increases may 
need to be passed on to customers but supermarkets locked in a price war may 
choose to absorb some of the hit, limiting his scope to protect profits. 
Gormley is doing the right things but, with the crucial Christmas period coming 
up, what assurances can he give about sterling’s fall?
