Arianna Huffington <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ariannahuffington>, the 
founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post, is the overwhelming winner 
of our poll for the most notable absentee from our annual MediaGuardian 100 
list.

Selected from a shortlist of the most common suggestions below the line and on 
social media, Huffington was last on the list in 2012, the year aftershe sold 
her blogging network to AOL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2011/feb/07/huffington-post-sale-aol-ariana>
 for $315m (£200m).

Three years after this sale, she has confounded expectations that she might 
leave while proselytising for a new way of being, the so-called “third metric”, 
with a book and speaking tourkeeping her in the headlines

Beating rivals such as Mark Thompson, chief executive of the New York Times 
Company, and Katie Vanneck-Smith, global managing director of Dow Jones, 
Huffington garnered 46% of our online poll.

Huffington also helps redress the gender balance of a list still dominated by 
men. This year she has also been listed as the52nd most powerful woman in the 
world by Forbes
