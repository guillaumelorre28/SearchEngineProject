European markets end higher

News of the Greek debt deal has seen stock markets record some good gains - 
apart ironically from in Athens - while Greek bond yields have fallen sharply.

Germany’s Dax added 1.47%, France’s Cac closed 1.13% higher, while Italy’s 
FTSE MIB rose 1.66% and Spain’s Ibex ended 2.32% higher.

But after an early 1.5% rise, the Athens market ended virtually unchanged, 
slipping back 0.04% amid the threat of further strikes in protest against the 
proposed pension and tax reforms.

Greek two year bond yields are currently down 80 basis points at 7.4% as 
investors welcomed the progress in the bailout talks.

On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.

After Moody’s saying the Greek deal was credit positive, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/25/greek-debt-deal-imf-eurozone-markets-shares-business-live?page=with:block-57457c47e4b038ba175e40c3#block-57457c47e4b038ba175e40c3>
 Fitch has also welcomed the late night agreement but warned of possible 
problems implementing reform measures. The ratings agency said:

The agreement reached between Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>
 and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis 
this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out 
programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek 
government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with 
politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme 
commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high.

The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its 
official creditors since last summer’s often confrontational negotiations 
leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented 
prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for 
additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target.

For their part, Greece’s official creditors have agreed to possible debt 
relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)...

 Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance 
could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, 
given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five 
years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be 
missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could 
increase if the conditionality in Wednesday’s agreement meant that sizeable 
debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or 
unattainable prospect.

A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek 
debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next 
few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow 
in the long term without further debt re-profiling.

Our ‘CCC’ sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to 
programme implementation and debt sustainability.

The Eurogroup “breakthrough” on debt relief was no such thing, says Joan Hoey, 
Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit:

The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been 
banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, 
remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified.

The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout 
programme. It looked at the reforms passed so far and found them wanting. It 
concluded that several conditions “prior reforms” will have to be met before 
any money can be handed over.

The release of funds would then follow in two sub-tranches, the first amount 
of €7.5bn in June, depending on successful completion of “prior actions”. The 
balance of €2.8bn will be released only after the clearance of government 
arrears and after the government has met milestones related to the 
privatisation fund, bank governance, the revenue collection agency and the 
energy sector. This disbursement is scheduled for the end of the third quarter.

 The Eurogroup won a commitment from the IMF, with which it has been at 
loggerheads over debt relief, to participate in the bailout, pending approval 
from the Fund’s executive board.

 We retain our view that disaffection in the party and among the electorate 
will grow, posing risks to political stability and Greece’s membership of the 
eurozone.

European markets are holding onto their gains as they head to the close. 
Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:

Stocks extended gains on Wednesday as a tentative agreement on Greek debt 
relief and a fresh seven-month high in the price of US oil offered more cause 
for optimism. Banks were top risers for a second day as markets price-in the 
earnings benefit of a possible US rate rise in the summer. Banks in the 
peripheral ofEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> most 
exposed to Greek debt, including Spain’s Banco Santander, were top performers.

Less exposure to Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and weak 
earnings from M&S weighed on the FTSE 100, which rose less than its European 
counterparts.

Greek shares rose and the yield on Greek Debt fell after the IMF and Germany 
deferred a quarrel on Greek debt relief until 2018... Greece avoiding another 
cliff-edge moment is undoubtedly positive for markets, which already face the 
uncertainty of the Brexit referendum and Spanish elections in June.

The funds to be released following the late night Eurogroup agreement should 
lastGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> until the end of October 
when the second review of the bailout programme is due start, according to the 
Athens-Macedonian News Agency. It says:

The €10.3bn tranche that the Eurogroup decided to disburse to Greece will 
fully meet the country’s financing needs until the end of October, when the 
second review of the Greek programme is set to start, Eurozone officials said 
on Wednesday.

Describing the events behind the scenes at Tuesday’s Eurogroup, the sources 
said that the IMF and Europeans had reached a compromise in spite of their 
different initial positions, while confirming that the IMF will participate. 
According to one EU official, this was not so much a “power play” but more that 
all sides moved from their initial position, with the IMF fully understanding 
that the Eurozone operates in a different way from the fund.

Tsakalotos, and EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis at the Eurogroup meeting

Regarding the measures for the debt, the European sources said that there were 
no “immediate decisions” but this was not a surprise, since there were no debts 
maturing in the short term. In the medium-term, the Eurozone countries said 
they will examine the possibility of buying up debt to the IMF early, or the 
bilateral loans with Eurozone countries, using the unspent funds (approximately 
20 billion euros) originally destined for the recapitalisation of the banks. 
This would, however, require the approval of some national parliaments.

According to Eurozone officials, the chances that Greece can return to 
borrowing from the markets at reasonable interest rates at the end of the 
programme are much higher following the agreement at Tuesday’s Eurogroup. They 
said that Greece’s access to the markets can begin to be restored gradually, in 
the second half of 2017, and that the aim is to restore full market access by 
the end of 2018.

The more credible Greece’s economic policy, including its success in 
delivering primary surplus targets, the smaller the spreads on Greek bonds will 
be, though borrowing from the Eurozone will always be cheaper, the same sources 
said. The second review of the Greek programme would begin at the end of 
October, they added, noting that the measures that remained to be taken will 
not be as difficult as those required by the first review.

Helena Smith

In Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> trade unionists are 
already flexing their muscles and planning mass industrial action,reports 
Helena Smith.

Strikes are expected to start tomorrow when workers at the Piraeus Port 
Organisation and Thessaloniki Port Organisation begin a 48-hour walk-out in 
opposition to the controversial privatisation programme the government has 
signed up to.

Adedy, which represents employees in the public sector, has also decided to 
hold a Pan-Hellenic work stoppage on June 8. “We decided, today, after meeting 
health and education federations that we would take this action to protest all 
the things that these new measures mean: lack of staff, underfunding, 
appointments that should, but will never happen,” Adedy’s chief policy maker, 
Grigoris Kalomoiris told the Guardian.

“The Eurogroup was a fiasco for Greece. The government was just a spectator 
while Germany rode roughshod over everyone else and made all the decisions. To 
conclude the review we agreed to sell off all our public wealth and impose more 
of the same counter-productive measures. It makes no sense. Come 
September/October we foresee mass and dynamic reaction because it is then that 
the measures will start to kick in.”

Kalomoiros said the trade union now firmly believed the only way out for the 
debt-stricken country was to leave the eurozone.

Wall Street opens higher

As expected, US markets have followed their counterparts elsewhere and moved 
higher in early trading, partly buoyed by the Greek agreement overnight and 
continuing strength in the oil price.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 124 points or 0.7% while the 
S&P 500 opened up 0.28% and Nasdaq 0.34% better.

The moves came despite some weaker than expected US services and composite PMI 
data.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble has said last night’s result on 
Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> was a good one, and the next 
tranche of aid can now be paid out. But it looks like it’s not all sweetness 
and light with the IMF:

Markets continue to be buoyed by the early morning Greek deal, although are 
now off their best levels.

Banks are among the main movers, both on the Eurogroup agreement and because a 
rise in US interest rates, which could come as early as June or July, is likely 
to bolster their balance sheets.

In Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, the Athens market is 
currently up 0.45%, while the country’s 10 year bond yields are down 8 basis 
points at 7.3%. Two year bond yields are currently down 87 basis points at 
7.37%.

Elsewhere in Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, Germany’s 
Dax is up 1.4%, France’s Cac has climbed 1.1%, Italy’s FTSE MIB is up 1.3% and 
Spain’s Ibex has added 2.1%.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is up 0.6% and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average is forecast to open around 73 points higher.

News of the Greek debt deal has seen stock markets record some good gains - 
apart ironically from in Athens - while Greek bond yields have fallen sharply.

Germany’s Dax added 1.47%, France’s Cac closed 1.13% higher, while Italy’s 
FTSE MIB rose 1.66% and Spain’s Ibex ended 2.32% higher.

But after an early 1.5% rise, the Athens market ended virtually unchanged, 
slipping back 0.04% amid the threat of further strikes in protest against the 
proposed pension and tax reforms.

Greek two year bond yields are currently down 80 basis points at 7.4% as 
investors welcomed the progress in the bailout talks.

On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
After Moody’s saying the Greek deal was credit positive, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/25/greek-debt-deal-imf-eurozone-markets-shares-business-live?page=with:block-57457c47e4b038ba175e40c3#block-57457c47e4b038ba175e40c3>
 Fitch has also welcomed the late night agreement but warned of possible 
problems implementing reform measures. The ratings agency said:

The agreement reached between Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>
 and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis 
this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out 
programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek 
government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with 
politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme 
commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high.

The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its 
official creditors since last summer’s often confrontational negotiations 
leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented 
prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for 
additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target.

For their part, Greece’s official creditors have agreed to possible debt 
relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)...

 Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance 
could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, 
given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five 
years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be 
missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could 
increase if the conditionality in Wednesday’s agreement meant that sizeable 
debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or 
unattainable prospect.

A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek 
debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next 
few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow 
in the long term without further debt re-profiling.

Our ‘CCC’ sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to 
programme implementation and debt sustainability.
 
The Eurogroup “breakthrough” on debt relief was no such thing, says Joan Hoey, 
Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit:

The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been 
banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, 
remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified.

The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout 
programme. It looked at the reforms passed so far and found them wanting. It 
concluded that several conditions “prior reforms” will have to be met before 
any money can be handed over.

The release of funds would then follow in two sub-tranches, the first amount 
of €7.5bn in June, depending on successful completion of “prior actions”. The 
balance of €2.8bn will be released only after the clearance of government 
arrears and after the government has met milestones related to the 
privatisation fund, bank governance, the revenue collection agency and the 
energy sector. This disbursement is scheduled for the end of the third quarter.

 The Eurogroup won a commitment from the IMF, with which it has been at 
loggerheads over debt relief, to participate in the bailout, pending approval 
from the Fund’s executive board.

 We retain our view that disaffection in the party and among the electorate 
will grow, posing risks to political stability and Greece’s membership of the 
eurozone.
 
And now some comments emerging from the IMF:

Here’s a timeline of Greece’s incoming bailout funds and outgoing payments in 
the next few months:
Greek debt timeline 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/greek-bailouttimeline/giv-12515wpZ6yoKXzMny/> 
European markets are holding onto their gains as they head to the close. 
Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:

Stocks extended gains on Wednesday as a tentative agreement on Greek debt 
relief and a fresh seven-month high in the price of US oil offered more cause 
for optimism. Banks were top risers for a second day as markets price-in the 
earnings benefit of a possible US rate rise in the summer. Banks in the 
peripheral ofEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> most 
exposed to Greek debt, including Spain’s Banco Santander, were top performers.

Less exposure to Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and weak 
earnings from M&S weighed on the FTSE 100, which rose less than its European 
counterparts.

Greek shares rose and the yield on Greek Debt fell after the IMF and Germany 
deferred a quarrel on Greek debt relief until 2018... Greece avoiding another 
cliff-edge moment is undoubtedly positive for markets, which already face the 
uncertainty of the Brexit referendum and Spanish elections in June.
 
The funds to be released following the late night Eurogroup agreement should 
lastGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> until the end of October 
when the second review of the bailout programme is due start, according to the 
Athens-Macedonian News Agency. It says:

The €10.3bn tranche that the Eurogroup decided to disburse to Greece will 
fully meet the country’s financing needs until the end of October, when the 
second review of the Greek programme is set to start, Eurozone officials said 
on Wednesday.

Describing the events behind the scenes at Tuesday’s Eurogroup, the sources 
said that the IMF and Europeans had reached a compromise in spite of their 
different initial positions, while confirming that the IMF will participate. 
According to one EU official, this was not so much a “power play” but more that 
all sides moved from their initial position, with the IMF fully understanding 
that the Eurozone operates in a different way from the fund.

Tsakalotos, and EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis at the Eurogroup meeting

Regarding the measures for the debt, the European sources said that there were 
no “immediate decisions” but this was not a surprise, since there were no debts 
maturing in the short term. In the medium-term, the Eurozone countries said 
they will examine the possibility of buying up debt to the IMF early, or the 
bilateral loans with Eurozone countries, using the unspent funds (approximately 
20 billion euros) originally destined for the recapitalisation of the banks. 
This would, however, require the approval of some national parliaments.

According to Eurozone officials, the chances that Greece can return to 
borrowing from the markets at reasonable interest rates at the end of the 
programme are much higher following the agreement at Tuesday’s Eurogroup. They 
said that Greece’s access to the markets can begin to be restored gradually, in 
the second half of 2017, and that the aim is to restore full market access by 
the end of 2018.

The more credible Greece’s economic policy, including its success in 
delivering primary surplus targets, the smaller the spreads on Greek bonds will 
be, though borrowing from the Eurozone will always be cheaper, the same sources 
said. The second review of the Greek programme would begin at the end of 
October, they added, noting that the measures that remained to be taken will 
not be as difficult as those required by the first review.
 
In Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> trade unionists are 
already flexing their muscles and planning mass industrial action,reports 
Helena Smith.

Strikes are expected to start tomorrow when workers at the Piraeus Port 
Organisation and Thessaloniki Port Organisation begin a 48-hour walk-out in 
opposition to the controversial privatisation programme the government has 
signed up to.

Adedy, which represents employees in the public sector, has also decided to 
hold a Pan-Hellenic work stoppage on June 8. “We decided, today, after meeting 
health and education federations that we would take this action to protest all 
the things that these new measures mean: lack of staff, underfunding, 
appointments that should, but will never happen,” Adedy’s chief policy maker, 
Grigoris Kalomoiris told the Guardian.

“The Eurogroup was a fiasco for Greece. The government was just a spectator 
while Germany rode roughshod over everyone else and made all the decisions. To 
conclude the review we agreed to sell off all our public wealth and impose more 
of the same counter-productive measures. It makes no sense. Come 
September/October we foresee mass and dynamic reaction because it is then that 
the measures will start to kick in.”

Kalomoiros said the trade union now firmly believed the only way out for the 
debt-stricken country was to leave the eurozone.
 
Back with German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble. According to Bloomberg he 
has said a fourth Greek bailout programme is not needed as of now.
 
As expected, US markets have followed their counterparts elsewhere and moved 
higher in early trading, partly buoyed by the Greek agreement overnight and 
continuing strength in the oil price.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 124 points or 0.7% while the 
S&P 500 opened up 0.28% and Nasdaq 0.34% better.

The moves came despite some weaker than expected US services and composite PMI 
data.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble has said last night’s result on 
Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> was a good one, and the next 
tranche of aid can now be paid out. But it looks like it’s not all sweetness

"It wld have been helpful if the (IMF) managing director had been present.That 
wld have saved us a few hours,"Schaeuble says of Greek talks.

to bolster their balance sheets.
