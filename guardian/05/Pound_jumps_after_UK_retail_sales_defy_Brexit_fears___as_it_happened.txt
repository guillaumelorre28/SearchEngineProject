The latest US unemployment report is as impressive as ever.

Just 262,000 people filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, 4,000 
fewer than the previous week.

That means the initial jobless claims total has been below 300,000 for 76 
weeks in a row, which hasn’t happened since 1973.

Britons are less pessimistic about the economy - survey

The UK public have shaken off some of their post-referendum worries, according 
to IPSOS Mori, the polling company.

Its latest survey has found that 43% of the public expect the economy to 
deteriorate over the next 12 months, down from 57% a month ago.

And the proportion expecting conditions to improve has risen to 28%, from 23%.

Conservative voters have become particularly optimistic this month, 
apparently, perhaps showing they’re happy with Theresa May’s premiership. But 
remain supporters, young people and Labour voters are all still gloomy, 
according to IPSOS Mori’s Gideon Skinner:

The European Central Bank has urged EU leaders to pick up their game following 
Britain’s EU referendum.

The minutes of its last meeting, released today, state that:

“A strong call was made for European policymakers to contain political 
uncertainty surrounding the UK exit negotiations and to provide a clear vision 
for the future path of the European Union and its integration process.”

The ECB also hinted that it might deploy fresh stimulus measures at its 
September meeting, once policymakers had assessed the situation in the eurozone.

The minutes of July’s meeting say:

“It was widely felt among members that it was premature tod iscuss any 
possible monetary policy reaction at this stage.

More time was needed to assess the incoming information over the coming 
months, although downside risks had clearly increased.”

Asda’s record fall in sales shows that the company needs to compete better on 
price, and quality, to stay afloat, saysPaul Thomas, senior consultant at 
Retail Remedy.

The limping Asda ship has a new captain and for Sean Clarke’s first trading 
update, it could be no worse.

It is too soon for the new CEO to have had any significant impact but a 7.5% 
decline in like for like sales is apocalyptic for Asda.

There is absolutely no honeymoon period for Sean Clarke: it’s a case of get in 
there and power up the defibrillator.

The 7.5% fall in like-for-like sales needs to be viewed alongside the fact 
that the other 3 supermarkets all grew sales in same period#asda

Ouch. In fact. double-ouch.

Sales at ASDA, the supermarket chain owned by US mega-group Walmart, have 
fallen by 7.5% in the last quarter - its worst performance ever!

Walmart says it is urgently addressing the situation, but admits turning Asda 
around will take time given the “competitive environment in the UK”, and food 
deflation.

Back in June, Walmart surprise retail experts by parachuting the head of its 
Chinese operation, Sean Clarke, to run Asda.

Like all UK supermarkets, Asda has been squeezed by the rise of discount 
chains such as Aldi and Lidl. It is also struggling to cope with the shift 
towards online shopping, and the move away from large supermarkets towards 
smaller convenience stores.

Sports Direct puts own board under the microscope

Newsflash: Sports Direct has announced plans to review its own board.

The retail chain, whose working practices were exposed by the Guardian last 
December, has also told the City that its own internal review will be published 
early next month.

Here’s the statement:

Sports Direct announces that the independent report on working practices being 
undertaken by the law firm RPC, which will review and report on the internal 
investigation announced in December 2015, will be published in the week 
commencing 5 September 2016, (ahead of the AGM on 7 September 2016).

An external evaluation of the board is planned for later this financial year.

In other retail news, Amazon has just announced is is opening a new fulfilment 
centre in Tilbury, Essex next year.

This will create 1,500 new permanent jobs, but Amazon will also be deploying 
its latest Robotics technology, which means....

The robots slide under a tower of shelves where products are stowed, lift it 
and move it through the fulfilment centre. Robots help speed order processing 
time and reduce walking time by moving the shelves to employees, reducing the 
time taken to stow items for sale or pick them for new customer orders.

They also save space, allowing for 50 per cent more items to be stowed per 
square foot.

Here’s a recent feature about Amazon’s smart robot work:

Amazon moves one step closer toward army of warehouse robots

The jump in the pound suggests investors have been too gloomy about the UK 
since the Brexit vote, saysArnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank 
<http://en.swissquote.com/fx/news>.

Perhaps July’s solid retail sales are a once-off and the positive effects of 
the weaker pound will be short-lived. However, one thing is certain: the market 
has been overly pessimistic in the wake of the Brexit vote and clearly needs to 
better assess the lay of the land.

Tourism boosts retail sales

It appears that Britain’s shopkeepers are benefitting from a flurry of 
tourists, thanks to the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote


Joe Grice, Chief Economic Adviser at the Office for National Statistics, 
explains:

“These are strong numbers showing a pronounced increase in sales compared with 
last July. Better weather this year could be a major factor with sales of 
clothing and footwear doing particularly well. There is also anecdotal evidence 
from respondents suggesting the weaker pound has encouraged overseas visitors 
to spend.

Department stores and specialist retailers like jewellers are among those 
reporting a good month.”

Pound surges after retail sales surprise

Sterling is rocketing higher, as fears of a Brexit-induced recession ease.

The pound has jumped by over one cent against the US dollar to $1.3154, a two 
week-high, astraders hail the 1.4% jump in retail sales last month

It’s also up 0.8 eurocents at €1.1631, bouncing back from Tuesday’s three-year 
low.

Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, says British consumers appear to be “unfazed” 
by the Brexit vote. That could mean the UK avoids falling into recession, as 
some economists had feared.

Scott says:

Sentiment is key to avoiding a prolonged downturn or recession and the 
consumers willingness to spend would point to it holding up well.

The latest US unemployment report is as impressive as ever.

Just 262,000 people filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, 4,000 
fewer than the previous week.

That means the initial jobless claims total has been below 300,000 for 76 
weeks in a row, which hasn’t happened since 1973.
 
The UK public have shaken off some of their post-referendum worries, according 
to IPSOS Mori, the polling company.

Its latest survey has found that 43% of the public expect the economy to 
deteriorate over the next 12 months, down from 57% a month ago.

And the proportion expecting conditions to improve has risen to 28%, from 23%.

Conservative voters have become particularly optimistic this month, 
apparently, perhaps showing they’re happy with Theresa May’s premiership. But 
remain supporters, young people and Labour voters are all still gloomy, 
according to IPSOS Mori’s Gideon Skinner:

The European Central Bank has urged EU leaders to pick up their game following 
Britain’s EU referendum.

The minutes of its last meeting, released today, state that:

“A strong call was made for European policymakers to contain political 
uncertainty surrounding the UK exit negotiations and to provide a clear vision 
for the future path of the European Union and its integration process.”

The ECB also hinted that it might deploy fresh stimulus measures at its 
September meeting, once policymakers had assessed the situation in the eurozone.

The minutes of July’s meeting say:

“It was widely felt among members that it was premature tod iscuss any 
possible monetary policy reaction at this stage.

More time was needed to assess the incoming information over the coming 
months, although downside risks had clearly increased.”
 
Asda’s record fall in sales shows that the company needs to compete better on 
price, and quality, to stay afloat, saysPaul Thomas, senior consultant at 
Retail Remedy.

The limping Asda ship has a new captain and for Sean Clarke’s first trading 
update, it could be no worse.

It is too soon for the new CEO to have had any significant impact but a 7.5% 
decline in like for like sales is apocalyptic for Asda.

There is absolutely no honeymoon period for Sean Clarke: it’s a case of get in 
there and power up the defibrillator.

Walmart says it is urgently addressing the situation, but admits turning Asda 
around will take time given the “competitive environment in the UK”, and food 
deflation.

Back in June, Walmart surprise retail experts by parachuting the head of its 
Chinese operation, Sean Clarke, to run Asda.

Like all UK supermarkets, Asda has been squeezed by the rise of discount 
chains such as Aldi and Lidl. It is also struggling to cope with the shift 
towards online shopping, and the move away from large supermarkets towards 
smaller convenience stores.
 
Newsflash: Sports Direct has announced plans to review its own board.

The retail chain, whose working practices were exposed by the Guardian last 
December, has also told the City that its own internal review will be published 
early next month.

Here’s the statement:

Sports Direct announces that the independent report on working practices being 
undertaken by the law firm RPC, which will review and report on the internal 
investigation announced in December 2015, will be published in the week 
commencing 5 September 2016, (ahead of the AGM on 7 September 2016).

An external evaluation of the board is planned for later this financial year.

In other retail news, Amazon has just announced is is opening a new fulfilment 
centre in Tilbury, Essex next year.

This will create 1,500 new permanent jobs, but Amazon will also be deploying 
its latest Robotics technology, which means....

The robots slide under a tower of shelves where products are stowed, lift it 
and move it through the fulfilment centre. Robots help speed order processing 
time and reduce walking time by moving the shelves to employees, reducing the 
time taken to stow items for sale or pick them for new customer orders.

They also save space, allowing for 50 per cent more items to be stowed per 
square foot.

Here’s a recent feature about Amazon’s smart robot work:

The jump in the pound suggests investors have been too gloomy about the UK 
since the Brexit vote, saysArnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank 
<http://en.swissquote.com/fx/news>.

Perhaps July’s solid retail sales are a once-off and the positive effects of 
the weaker pound will be short-lived. However, one thing is certain: the market 
has been overly pessimistic in the wake of the Brexit vote and clearly needs to 
better assess the lay of the land.
 
It appears that Britain’s shopkeepers are benefitting from a flurry of 
tourists, thanks to the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote


Joe Grice, Chief Economic Adviser at the Office for National Statistics, 
explains:

“These are strong numbers showing a pronounced increase in sales compared with 
last July. Better weather this year could be a major factor with sales of 
clothing and footwear doing particularly well. There is also anecdotal evidence 
from respondents suggesting the weaker pound has encouraged overseas visitors 
to spend.

Department stores and specialist retailers like jewellers are among those 
reporting a good month.”
