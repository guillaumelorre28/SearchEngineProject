Al Jazeera America’s digital newsroom became the latest new media organization 
to unionize on Tuesday.

Staff voted in favour 32 to 5, the National Labor Relations Board declared 
after counting the ballots cast by eligible employees.

Al Jazeera America is the latest of a number of newsrooms to unionize this 
year. Guardian US editorial staff, Gawker, Salon and Vice have all had internal 
votes or petitions and were voluntarily recognized by their management. So far, 
Al Jazeera America has been the only new media outlet that has organized its 
vote through the National Labor Relations Board.

Peter Szekely, president of the News Guild, said he was “disappointed” that 
the management did not voluntarily recognize the unionization efforts, but was 
confident that the NLRB vote would go in the workers’ favor.

“Our priority was to ensure that every employee of Al Jazeera America’s 
Digital Department could have a say about union representation and we respect 
the decision they have reached through this democratic vote,” an Al Jazeera 
America spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. “We look forward to 
concluding a collective bargaining agreement and will continue to work closely 
with all of our staff to make working at AJAM a positive experience.”

 Nine editors, who are part of the digital newsroom at Al Jazeera America, 
were not eligible to cast their vote because the company argued that their 
positions were supervisory in nature. The union, which pointed out that these 
editors do not have power to hire or fire, planed to fight their exclusion from 
the bargaining unit.

Yet, just hours after the results of the vote were announced, the company 
issued another statement that it “will not maintain our challenge to the status 
of the nine individuals in question”.

The News Guild of New York, which will now represent Al Jazeera America 
digital staff, is part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union.
