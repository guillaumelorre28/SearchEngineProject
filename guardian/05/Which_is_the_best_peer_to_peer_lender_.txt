Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

After years of terrible rates on my bank-held savings I am considering a 
peer-to-peer lender that promises 3%-6% returns. I know my money is at risk of 
default, but I’m desperate. Have others taken the plunge, and how did it go? 
Any tips?
