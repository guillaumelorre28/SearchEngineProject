Two of the mainstays of geek culture, comics and games have shared an awkward 
relationship – for many years, games were re-imagined to mediocre effect in 
print. There were exceptions, but today it’s much easier to find 
well-considered game-comics. Here are some of the best.

Tomb Raider


Based on the 2014 reboot of Lara Croft’s interactive escapades, esteemed 
writer Gail Simone’sTomb Raider comics do a marvellous job of replicating the 
spirit of their source material. They also provide an entry point into Croft’s 
fictional world for series newcomers and those who’ve not played aTomb Raider 
game or read the associated comics in some time.

Assassin’s Creed

With issue one of their latest creation still warm from the printing presses, 
writers Anthony Del Col and Conor McCreery capture much of what makes the best
Assassin’s Creed games so enticing while delivering convincing characters and a 
snappy pace. .

EVE Valkyrie


The EVE Valkyrie comics take a rather bold step in that they are based on a 
game yet to see release.Valkyrie is the virtual reality space dog-fighting 
spin-off of distinct MMOEVE Online, and here DMZ author Brian Wood is at the 
helm of this pictorial prelude.

Injustice: Gods Among Us


Starting out as a beat ’em up game based on the DC Comics world, when spun 
back into comic formInjustice made for a surprisingly interesting read. The 
story recently concluded after a four-year run and proves good comics can 
inspire good games that make for good comics.
