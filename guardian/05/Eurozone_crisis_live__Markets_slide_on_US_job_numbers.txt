Closing time

Just a quick look at the Dow before we sign the blog off for the week - it's 
off around 100 points at 14500. See you next week ...

continental shares this year:

Ibex (-0.73%), Dax (-1.99%), Cac (-1.6%).

Italy's MIB is up, however. The FTSE 100 has closed down nearly 1.5% at 
6249.78 (still settling).

4.09pm BST 

The DJIA and the FTSE 100 have come off their lows - Dow is just under 14500 
and the FTSE is at 6241.

Troubled eurozone debt slides

Yields on Spanish sovereign debt - about 4.83% - and Italian sovereign debt - 
4.45% - are attracting chatter in the wake of the US jobs data, as well as the 
Bank ofJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> spending spree, which 
has sent investors scurrying to European assets.
Mike Bergen (@BergenCapital) 
Spanish & Italian yields are coming down HARD; I think we rally here on the 
S&P.There will be no talk of slowing QE - +ve for risk.

Mr Bergen is saying that Bernanke is very unlikely to turn off QE now, so S&P 
stocks represent a decent buy opportunity.

Our take on the US jobs data

Here is the first take from Dominic Rushe 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/05/march-us-jobs-report-economy>, 
our man in New York. Worth noting that the expectation was for 200,000 extra 
jobs. No wonder the Dow and S&P are feeling a bit rum today.

2.38pm BST 

Brent crude falls

Brent crude has hit a five-month low off the back of the US jobs data, nearing 
$105 per barrel and dimming the global economic outlook.

2.36pm BST 

US stocks fall

The DOW is down 1% and the S&P 500 is down 1% in early trading on the jobs 
data.

2.23pm BST 

More reaction to US jobs figures

Marcus Bullus, trading director at MB Capital in London, says:

The US economy just hit a major speed bump.

Economists are also debating whether Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal 
Reserve, will pull back on the Fed's quantitative easing programme. Russell 
Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Michigan, says:

The recent discussions about the Fed backing off from its quantitative easing 
has been premature.

Yen rises after payroll data

That dread phrase among Japanese manufacturers, chō endaka or "super-strong 
yen", is back after the dollar fell sharply against the euro and the yen in the 
wake of the worse-than-expected US jobs numbers. The dollar fell 0.3% to 96.03 
yen while the euro hit session highs against the dollar at $1.3026.

Reaction to US figures

Much of the reaction relates to the participation rate: too many people 
dropping out of the workforce, say commentators.

US payroll data disappoints

US non0farm payrolls are out and they have rattled investors, hitting European 
shares. American employers hired at their slowest pace in nine months in March, 
adding just 88,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell a tenth of a percentage 
point to 7.6%, but this was largely due to people dropping out of the workforce.

1.09pm BST 

Berlusconi intervenes

The former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has demanded that Italy 
returns to the polls - something investors might not like - unless the centre 
left agrees to govern with him. The inconclusive February election has left 
Italy inpolitical gridlock  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/27/italian-deadlock-beppe-grillo-deal>
with no bloc receiving enough votes to govern.

In a tweet today Berlusconi said "it's crucial to form a strong and stable 
government immediately." He added that if the centre left Democratic party 
rejects his call for a coalition "we must return to the polls".

12.03pm BST 

European shares dip

The FTSEurofirst 300 index hit a one-month low this morning of 1,176 points 
amid fears that US non-farm payrolls will disappoint. The FTSE is off too, down 
1.35% at 6258.

Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital, said: 

We have seen some moderation in the pace of growth in the United States. The 
fundamentals are not as supportive as they were this time last year.

However, he adds:

But the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme isn't going away 
and hence it's difficult to see, despite my caution on the fundamentals, the 
market coming off sharply in the near term.

UK house prices rise for fourth successive quarter

Further good macroeconomic news for the UK, albeit of the more modest variety. 
The monthly housing market survey by Halifax, the mortgage lender, has show 
that prices rose for the fourth quarter in a row at the beginning of the year. 
Halifax warned, though, of "significant constraints" on housing demand such as 
weak income growth. The average house price is nearly £164,000, but still some 
distance below the peak of £199,612 recorded in August 2007. That feels like a 
long time, and a lot of crisis blogs, ago now.

UK car sales rise

Hello Dan Milmo here taking over from Simon Neville for a while. Just a bit of 
UK macroeconomic news that bodes well for one our most successful 
manufacturing/retail industries. New car registrations in March - a proxy for 
sales - rose by 5.9% to 395,000 registrations. It is the 13th consecutive month 
of sales growth. Because UK car factories export more than eight out of ten 
cars that they make, there is not a direct read across for manufacturing, but 
it is widely believed that a strong domestic market is important for sustaining 
a production base.

Mike Baunton, interim chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers 
and Traders, said:

Despite ongoing economic concerns, consistent monthly growth in the market is 
an encouraging sign of returning consumer confidence as motorists are attracted 
to forecourts by new models and the latest technologies.

BoJ market reaction

While we wait for the US jobs figures, Brenda Kelly, Market Analyst, at IG, 
gives some commentary on today's events.

She said:

While Japan’s Nikkei <https://www.theguardian.com/business/nikkei> surged to 
its highest closing level in over four years, the upbeat mood has not made the 
journey west.

In early morning trade there is little appetite for risk-taking, with the FTSE 
100 down 26 points, though it is succeeding in holding the 6300 level. While 
equity markets blazed a trail in the last quarter, investors have digested the 
slew of central bank action and inaction from yesterday and are sticking to the 
cautious path ahead of the US payrolls number.

Initial non-farm payrolls expectations of 200,000-210,000 have been pared back 
after both the ADP employment report and jobless claims failed to meet 
forecasts. A good number may serve to temporarily calm the market against 
recent poor data, but given that the market has a proven addiction to monetary 
easing one could expect markets to rally if the data prints is a significant 
miss.

Eurozone retail sales weaker than expected

Eurozone retail sales for February have just been announced.

They show sales volume down 0.3% month-on-month and down 1.4% compared with a 
year earlier.

January's retail data was also revised down from a rise of 1.2% to just 0.9% 
month-on-month.

Trade in French shops was particularly hit, dropping 2.2% between January and 
February, while sales in Belgium, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland also fell.

The worst hit year-on-year were Spain, down 9.7% and Portugal down 5.3%.

Reaction to ECB's comments

Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight has given some reaction to ECB board 
member, Benoit Coeure's commentsearlier  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/05/eurozone-crisis-live-bank-japan-markets#block-515e89b995cbd0ecba5ec06b>
that inflation will be carefully monitored.

He said:

We suspect that likely ongoing disappointing Eurozone economic news and 
further evidence of muted inflation will continue to push the ECB towards 
cutting interest rates, and likely sooner rather than later. We expect a cut 
from 0.75% to 0.50% in the second quarter, and consider a move as soon as May 
as highly possible.
 
Not only does further Eurozone GDP contraction now seem highly probable in the 
first quarter, but prospects for the second quarter are looking increasingly 
worrying. With Eurozone consumer price inflation down at a 31-month low of 1.7% 
in March, wage growth generally weak and most inflationary measures currently 
muted, the ECB has ample scope to cut interest rates.

BoE calls on bankers to curb bonuses

The latest minutes from the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee 
meeting has been published.

It said:

Banks should continue to exercise restraint on distributions and compensation.

In other words - stop paying such huge bonuses.

Last week the committee said banks needed an extra £25bn of capital by the end 
of the year to absorb any future losses.

The Committee agreed that a line needed to be drawn under doubts about UK 
banks' capital adequacy.

ECB will "monitor inflation carefully over next 18 months"

Meanwhile, over in Paris, ECB board member, Benoit Coeure reiterated his boss 
Mario Draghi's message from yesterday that it would do what it can to keep to 
inflation targets.

Eurozone inflation fell for the third month in a row in March to 1.7%, 
compared with the ECB's 2% target.

Coeure said:

We have a rate of inflation which looks set to move away from the ECB's 2% 
target over the next 18 months.

It is still fairly close to the 2% target but it is moving below that goal and 
this is something the board of governors is clearly following as we have a goal 
of 2%.

Monetary policy cannot be the main tool used to try and resolve difficulties 
with credit flows. Monetary policy can contribute but it cannot completely 
resolve these problems.

European bond yields fall

Bond yields across Europe are falling on the back of the Japanese stimulus.

French 10-year bond yields fell to a record low, hitting 1.81%, down 7 basis 
points to the lowest level on record.

German, Italian, Spanish, Austrian, Dutch and Belgian bonds were all down, as 
investors turned their attentions to Europe with Japan's bond yield sinking in 
response to the BoJ's announcement.

One trader told Reuters:

The view seems to be that the Bank of Japan moves will force money out of 
Japan and into other markets, and semi-core has always been one of the (Asian) 
favourites.

8.46am BST 

Japanese bonds swing wildly

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, complete with an old-school printed 
chart, gave a press conference in the early hours on day two of the 
announcement to pump an unprecedented $1.4tn into the economy.

He said:

We will be vigilant of the risk of a bubble. I don't think there's a bond or 
stock market bubble now and I don't see one emerging any time soon. But we will 
be vigilant of the risk.

But the market soon reacted, with yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds 
following to record lows early in the morning, before rebounding sharply.

The 10-year yield climbed 18 basis points to 0.615 percent in the afternoon 
session after dropping as much as 12 basis points in the morning to a record 
low of 0.315 percent.

Ten-year JGB futures dropped 2.49 points to 143.55 on the day to a near 
two-month low. They hit a record high of 146.41 in morning trade.

8.17am BST 

Good morning and welcome to another day of the eurozone crisis live blog, 
keeping you up to date on the key political and economic events to effect 
Europe and elsewhere.

Overnight, more news from Tokyo, where Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda 
played down concerns of an asset-price bubble as a result of yesterday's 
announcement of plans to pump $1.4tn into the economy over the next two years.

However, this was a tricky sell, with government bond yields at a record low, 
the yen hitting a three-and-a-half year trough and the Nikkei soaring to a 
five-year high.

Elsewhere, over in the US, President Obama is expected to offer cuts to 
welfare programmes in return for Republican support on the budget, creating a 
compromise on a deficit reduction deal. We will bring you any market reaction 
to the news.

Today, all eyes will remain on the US where the latest non-farm employment 
numbers will come out at 1.30pm as an indicator of further recovery.

Meanwhile, in Europe, the eurozone retail sales figures for February come out 
at 10am and are expected to show a continued fall in consumer spending.

All this, and other events as they unfold.
