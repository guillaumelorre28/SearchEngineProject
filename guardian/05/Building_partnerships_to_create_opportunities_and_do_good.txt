Guardian News & Media's commercial sustainability objective is to enhance 
commercial opportunities and the business model by building partnerships based 
on our brand values to actively do good.

This objective requires innovative, efficient and profitable ways to champion 
social and environmental justice. We believe that adopting our open philosophy 
and Living our Values will bring us closer to our global audience, allowing us 
to go beyond simply advertising to create more dynamic engaging sponsorship.

Crucial to our success is understanding how our values influence both our 
audience engagement and our clients' advertising choices.

To achieve these goals we will focus on:

 * Maintaining and building the trust, loyalty and integrity of our brand 
through transparency. 
 * Creating forums to facilitate informed debate and build audience 
communities. 
 * Inspiring and collaborating with our audience/commercial partners to 
contribute to a sustainable future. 
 * Offering quality services and products that are also ethically and 
environmentally sound. 
The following sections provide an overview of the actions taken over 2011-12 
to live up to our commitments and integrate sustainability into our commercial 
goals.
