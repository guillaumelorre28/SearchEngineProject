There is something a bit 80s about the word “dip”. It makes me think of my 
parents’ dinner parties, Mum in her turquoise-and-silver lapeled jumpsuit, 
passing round what we called “The Dip” and tortilla chips.

But a dip, spread or hummus is a very useful thing to have in your fridge. I 
make up a batch of some kind at least once a week. It means I have something on 
hand to dip a carrot in to fill the gap before dinner, or something flavourful 
to spoon into a bowl of greens and grains or to spread into a sandwich with a 
sprinkling of feta and some peppery leaves.

The dips I make fall into two camps – hummus-style (made from a base of 
buttery pulses) or veg-centred – and are rarely ever the same. I use beans as a 
base, to which I add something rich and buttery, something deep and flavourful 
(think smoky cumin or miso) and some brightness from citrus, with a finishing 
flurry of herbs. Have a look at the flavour map (below) for some suggestions.

The two dips that follow – together with a stack of these fluffy, blistered 
flatbreads and a plate of colourful, crunchy summer veg – make for a social 
dinner best eaten outside. Or at least with the windows thrown open.

Golden beetroot borani

This Iranian dip is usually made with aubergine, but its flavours work with 
lots of different vegetables. This week, my veg-centered dip is all about 
golden beetroots. The warmer days seem to suit its slightly sweeter, more 
subtle notes, though the deep purple ones will work just as well and will turn 
your borani a vivid, fuchsia pink.

Serves 4
500g golden or red beetroot (about 600g raw weight), cooked and peeled
1 small garlic clove, finely chopped
4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
4 tbsp Greek yoghurt
A small bunch of dill, chopped 
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
2 dates, mashed to a paste with a splash of hot water
A pinch of salt
100g feta cheese, crumbled
A small handful of walnuts
½ tsp black onion seeds

1 If you are cooking your beetroot, wash them, leaving the skins on, then 
cover with boiling water and simmer for about 40 minutes, or until they are 
tender to the tip of a knife. Top up the water when needed. Drain the beetroot, 
then leave them to cool.

2 Peel the beetroot and blend in a food processor until you have a rough puree 
with a bit of texture.

3 Transfer to a bowl, add the chopped garlic, olive oil, yoghurt, chopped 
dill, vinegar, mashed dates and a pinch of salt.

4 Sprinkle with the feta, walnuts, black onion seeds and extra sprigs of dill, 
then drizzle with a little olive oil. Serve with yoghurt flatbreads and crisp 
vegetables, for dipping.

Frying pan yoghurt flatbreads

There is a corner shop about 100 paces from my house but I still find myself 
making these in a fix: they are pleasingly simple and also work brilliantly on 
a barbecue.

Makes 4
200g white flour, plus extra for dusting (I use spelt)
1 tsp baking powder 
200g Greek yoghurt, or 150ml warm water

1 Put all the flatbread ingredients into the bowl of your food processor and 
pulse until the mixture forms a ball. If you don’t have a food processor, this 
can be done in a bowl using a fork to begin with, followed by your hands, but 
it will take a little longer.

2 Tip the dough out on to a clean work surface dusted with flour. Knead for a 
minute or so, to bring it all together. Put the dough into a flour-dusted bowl 
and cover with a plate. Put to one side to rise a little for 10–15 minutes. 
Don’t expect it to rise like normal dough, but it may puff up a tiny bit.

3 Dust a clean work surface and rolling pin with flour, then divide the dough 
into four equal pieces. Using your hands, pat and flatten out the dough, then 
use the rolling pin to roll each piece into a disc roughly 20cm in diameter and 
2–3mm thick.

4 Warm a frying pan or griddle pan that’s a bit larger than your flatbreads 
over a medium heat. Once your pan is nicely hot, cook each flatbread for 1–2 
minutes on each side, until nicely puffed up, turning with tongs.

Butterbean, roast lemon and caramelised onion hummus-style dip

This is my favourite version of hummus, using plump butterbeans instead of 
chickpeas. Pan-roasted lemons add a spike of mellow acidity, which is nicely 
balanced out by sweet, slow‑cooked onions.

Serves 4
Olive oil, for frying
4 onions, finely sliced 
2 lemons, halved
2 x 400g tins or a 660g jar of cooked butterbeans (about 450g drained weight)
1 tbsp tahini
A pinch of salt
Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
1 tsp coriander seeds

1 Heat a medium frying pan with a little olive oil; once hot, add the sliced 
onions and cook on a medium heat for 10-15 minutes until browned and beginning 
to crisp a little. Push to one side of the pan. Put the lemons, cut-side down, 
on one half of the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes until softened, sticky and brown 
on the underneath, all the while stirring the onions. Transfer the onions and 
lemons to a bowl to cool a little.

2 Put the coriander seeds into the pan and toast for a few minutes until they 
are starting to brown and smell toasty. Scrape them into a pestle and mortar 
with all the goodness from the bottom of the pan and bash until quite fine.

3 Drain the beans and put into a food processor with the tahini, salt and 
extra virgin olive oil. Blitz well, until you have a cloudy, creamy dip.

4 Squeeze in the juice of all the lemon halves and scrape in some of the 
roasted middles, taking care to pick out any seeds. Add half the onions and 
pulse a couple of times – try to keep a bit of texture here.

5 Serve piled on to flatbreads, baby vegetables or next to some warm cooked 
grains and veg for a simple dinner.
