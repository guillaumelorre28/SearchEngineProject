The wastes of January – when our coffers are empty and our trouser cuffs are 
soggy – is traditionally when advertisers like to torment us with images of 
well-adjusted people enjoying sunny holidays.

It’s a rough old business, but at least we know the hallmarks – copyright-free 
pan-pipe music, Rob Brydon larking about self-consciously on a boat, parents 
looking far too happy to be trapped at 40,000 feet with their offspring – and 
can time our trips to the kettle accordingly.

The new Thomsons ad, then, is something of a curveball. It starts with a 
tinkly orchestral score John Lewis would be proud of. A little girl tiptoes 
through a beach scene frozen in time – waves paused mid-curl, volleyball 
players hanging in the air – to a pool, where her father is waiting. As she 
leaps towards him, she too is caught in the tableau. “That moment when time 
stands still,” comes the voiceover, as the music swells. “And you wish you 
never had to grow up.”

Well, thanks a lot advertising. Now we’re halfway to the kettle with lumps in 
our throats, nostalgic for our own childhood holidays: rain-soaked caravans, 
stand-up rows about Scrabble and all.
