Making small talk

The weather, the traffic, Ocado delivery slots, Strictly: the well-worn paths 
of party chat can get a little hard going at this time of year. But master the 
art of Conversation Dressing and you’ll never again be short of small talk.

A little black dress and gold studs is all very well, but you’re not giving 
your fellow guests much to get their teeth into repartee-wise. I am a longtime 
devotee of a novelty accessory, myself. Naff? Me? Well, possibly, but ever 
since I sawMiuccia Prada with miniature plastic bananas dangling from each lobe 
<http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iAV77SAeFwY/TZzI5torIWI/AAAAAAAACbg/2ajy-0g6QsQ/s1600/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-04-06%2Bat%2B21.09.58.png>
, I am entirely without shame. Earrings are a good place to start: I have an 
enormous Dolce & Gabbana pair of glitzed up farfalle pasta shapes, a tiny duo 
of owls made from feathers that I bought in Accessorize, and tiny Eiffel Towers 
bought for a couple of euros years ago from a tourist stall on the Rue de 
Rivoli, which I have worn a lot in recent weeks. All have rescued me from 
weather chat more than once.

My alternative is a silly clutch bag. My logic here is that clutch bags are, 
by their very nature, silly – ludicrous, dolly-sized things we carry when we’re 
on evenings off from real life. So a silly clutch bag is a sensible investment,

You have two options: dress to dazzle or dress for escape. For the first, you 
want to find the most alpha outfit possible without veering into barmy fashion 
territory (to quote the fierce Della Garry in Channel 4’sRaised by Wolves 
<http://www.channel4.com/programmes/raised-by-wolves>: “Do not ever give them a 
prop”). A good bet would be somethingshoulder-flashing 
<http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/product/clothing-427/open-shoulder-dress-by-boutique-4601222?Ntt=shoulder&bi=1&ps=200>
 (otherwise known, appropriately enough, as a cold-shoulder top) or a hint of 
velvet – like theseplatform shoes 
<http://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman/evening/velvet-platform-sandal-c764512p2875531.html>
 or thisjumpsuit 
<http://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman/jumpsuits/velvet-jumpsuit-c663016p2973560.html>
 – worn with high heels and a defiant hint of winter toe. In other words, set 
yourself apart from the sea of sequinned dresses and enjoy the sweet revenge as 
the begrudging compliments roll in all night.

If “pretending to be fabulous and cheerful” isn’t your thing, try becoming the 
sartorial equivalent of a shadow in black skinny jeans, an oversized black 
jumper and little black boots. Smile at your boss on arrival, ensuring your 
presence is registered, and as soon as they are no longer looking, run.
Hannah Marriott

The whole ‘Christmas look’

The trad aesthetic of Christmas – red, green, white and loaded with tinsel – 
does not naturally segue into everyone’s wardrobes. It certainly doesn’t in 
mine – nothing says yuletide joy quite unlike a navy ribbed polo-neck, does it? 
This can make Christmas parties, when the sartorial ambition tends towards 
kitsch, a tad tricky. In an ideal world fashion humbugs would be able to rise 
above season dressing and take a wholly lateral approach. But showcasing the 
really nice things about Christmas – the sound of a champagne cork popping 
before lunch or the acceptable length of TV watching – is hard to do with 
clothes. Even the majestic Le Labo Pin 12 scent is only made as a room 
fragrance not a perfume. No, if you really hate the aesthetic of Christmas, you 
have to beat it at its own game. You need to happen upon something that feels a 
bit jolly and Christmassy and subvert it to look ultra fashion.

 A model in Loewe spring/summer 2016. Photograph: WWD/REX Shutterstock/Handout 
This year, my inner wardrobe humbug was inspired by the Loewe catwalk – a 
place where only good things can happen fashion wise. DesignerJonathan Anderson 
 <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/03/jw-anderson-loewe-interview>
showed what can only be described as upcycled tinsel earrings. How hard can 
this be to recreate with a small gold hoop and a little shredded tinsel. “How 
jolly” they’ll say; “How Loewe does it look?” you’ll think. OK, it’s a little 
convoluted but the alternatives – dressing like Mariah Carey or wearing a 
Christmas jumper with a grimace – are too tragic to contemplate.

What with restaurants without reservations and H&M collaborations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/05/hm-balmain-designer-fashion-launch-scuffles-regent-street>
, queuing has quite the cache these days. But I think we can agree that the 
cloakroom queue is a bore for all concerned, especially when it’s the end of 
the evening and you’re in danger of missing the last tube. The way to avoid 
having to think about such things when you would rather discuss the 
misbehaviour of a colleague, is to wear – or at least bring – a jacket that 
works as part of your outfit, and is light enough so it can be slung across the 
back of a chair. This could be anything from an embellished bomber (I like this 
one fromNeedle & Thread 
<http://www.asos.com/Needle-Thread/Needle-Thread-Rose-Scatter-Embellished-Bomber/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5384249&cid=11894&sh=0&pge=1&pgesize=36&sort=-1&clr=Black%2fburgundy&totalstyles=370&gridsize=3>
) to that Elle MacPherson-approved warm-but-glamorous classic, the faux-fur 
gilet. Keep it on, or pick it up at the end of the night and walk straight out 
the bar. Warning: try not to smirk when walking past the cloakroom queue.

Paying for taxis

I love taxis because I’m afraid of the dark. I don’t think I’m alone in this. 
London is terrifying and wide. The inconvenient twist is that taxis hate me – 
check me and my 4.3 Uber rating ;-) (I have a difficult address). Luckily, I’m 
also a good walker, and I often carry a small torch in my pocket. If this 
sounds familiar, it’s worth remembering you don’t actually have to wear heels 
to a party. I don’t really wear proper heels because proper heels are absurd.

Firstly, avoid anything as lame as ballet pumps. Ditto those roll-up banana 
shoes which you keep in your bag and that were popular for about nine days. 
Instead try something like these fromKenzo 
<http://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Kenzo-Shearling-lined-flatform-espadrilles--1020557>
 which, sure, look a bit wacky, but are 3D logo’d (!!) and lined with shearling 
(despite being espadrilles). I’d probably wear them under a wide-legged 
jumpsuit. You can’t go wrong with boxfreshStan Smiths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2014/jan/12/stan-smith-tennis-adidas-trainer>
, either, or even a pair ofDr Marten’s 
<http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/uk/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=5319428576209&category=BRANDS-EU>
 which sound a bit “fun mum” on paper, unless you get patent ones and suddenly 
you’re a bit fetishy. Wear with tights or thick socks. The latter will shave at 
least five years off you because you look as if you’re still at school. Then, 
chances are, someone might even take pity on you and offer to share their cab 
with you, hopefully in a non-creepy way.
