Two linked comedy dramas by Alan Plater 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanplater> appear as the Afternoon Play 
today and tomorrow. Only A Matter Of Time (2.15pm, Radio 4) finds Fanshawe in 
the Welsh borders early in the 19th century explaining to Meredith, a deeply 
sceptical farmworker, the imminent wonders of Mr Brunel's new railway. Not 
least of the benefits, of course, will be the arrival of London time. A 
sparkling text is splendidly played by James Bolam (pictured) and Alan David. 
Tomorrow's instalment (equally entertaining) continues the action 150 years 
later.

All Saints' Day is celebrated with a unique transmission of  Choral Vespers 
(4pm,Radio <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> 3) from the Benedictine 
Abbey of Solesmes in Normandy. It is the first time this community of 100 monks 
has ever allowed one of its services to be broadcast, a decision made only 
after several years of negotiation. The monks are renowned for their 
traditional Gregorian chant, which regularly attracts hundreds of Christian 
pilgrims from around the world.
