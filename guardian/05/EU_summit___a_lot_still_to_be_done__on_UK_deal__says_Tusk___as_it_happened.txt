David Cameron has exited – temporarily, Brexit fans! – the talks with Tusk and 
Juncker. I think we can forgive him for not looking relaxed at 5.30am on zero 
sleep.

He’ll reportedly be back for talks at 9am CET.
Alex Pigman (@AlexRPigman) 
Out goes Cameron. Not relaxed to say the least. #Brexit

What we know so far

Claire Phipps

As day one of the summit ticks over into day two with barely a chance for a 
snooze, here are the latest developments:

 * Donald Tusk, president of the European Council and a key broker of any 
potential UK deal, said the negotiations were moving ahead slowly: 
 We have made some progress but a lot still remains to be done.


 * Tusk spoke ahead of a series of bilateral talks, including with British 
prime ministerDavid Cameron, which went late into the night in Brussels. 
 * Talks were said to be sticking on a number of key points 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c65c9fe4b0316343ed8f9e#block-56c65c9fe4b0316343ed8f9e>
, including the duration of the so-called emergency brake to restrict in-work 
benefits for EU migrants in the UK; curbs on child benefit for EU migrants 
whose children are not in the UK; and potential treaty changes to exempt 
formally the UK from the goal of “ever-closer union” and to underpin 
protections for non-eurozone members.  David Cameron and Angela Merkel at the

 * Full discussions between the leaders are due to resume at 11am CET (10am 
GMT), although earlier spin-off talks are mooted to include a meeting between 
Germany’sAngela Merkel, France’s François Hollande and Greece’s Alexis Tsipras 
at 10am CET. 
 * Leaders offered differing verdicts on any hope of a deal, with Italian 
prime ministerMatteo Renzi saying 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c67409e4b0f276c5add29a#block-56c67409e4b0f276c5add29a>
 he was “less optimistic” than he had been. Finnish PMJuha Sipilä suggested 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c66d20e4b0f276c5add293#block-56c66d20e4b0f276c5add293>
 an agreement would be struck by Friday, echoing Spain’sMariano Rajoy, who said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c678bfe4b0f276c5add29e#block-56c678bfe4b0f276c5add29e>
 things were “going well”. But Dutch PMMark Rutte raised the possibility 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c689abe4b0f276c5add2ac#block-56c689abe4b0f276c5add2ac>
 of talks on a UK deal running into Saturday.

 * Agreement was reached 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/refugee-crisis-eu-calls-extraordinary-summit-with-turkey>
 – after adinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c66b58e4b0f276c5add291#block-56c66b58e4b0f276c5add291>
 lasting five-and-a-half hours – on a rescheduled meeting between EU leaders 
and Turkey, pencilled in for 5 March, to address the ongoing migration crisis. 
 * Merkel said the migration talks were the “priority” for the summit: 
 The important statement for me today is that we have not only reaffirmed the 
EU-Turkey action plan, but we have said it is our priority.


 * Ukip leader Nigel Farage said Cameron was acting “rather like Oliver Twist”:
He has come along with his begging bowl, saying please sir, can we have more 
concessions? Most of what you are seeing here is theatre. It’s theatre from Mr 
Cameron and it’s theatre from the other leaders.

5am in Brussels. I’m not sure whether this now counts as day one or day two. 
But Cameron appears to have returned to the table with Tusk and Juncker:
Bruno Waterfield (@BrunoBrussels) 
Yawn. Bilateral with Michel ended. Now Cameron back in the room again #EUCO

Deliberately or not, EU leaders have ensured that the key lines to come out of 
the summit at the end of day one concern migration, rather than Britain’s 
demand for a new deal:

European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> leaders threw their 
weight behind efforts to work with Turkey to limit the flow of refugees to 
Europe, with German chancellor Angela Merkel labelling it a priority in an 
announcement early on Friday.

“The important statement for me today is that we have not only reaffirmed the 
EU-Turkey action plan, but we have said it is our priority,” Merkel said of the
plan to address migration 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/18-euco-conclusions-migration/>
 and border controls.

Merkel noted Austria backed the plan, despite its unilateral decision to 
introduce daily caps on migrants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/austria-dismisses-criticism-of-its-plan-to-limit-daily-refugee-numbers>
. “In Europe we are all always partners,” she said.

The European Council president, Donald Tusk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/donald-tusk>, earlier announced the 
postponed extraordinary summit with Turkey would now be held probably in early 
March.

The “joint action plan with Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> 
remains a priority and we must do all we can to succeed”, he said.

The full text of the European council conclusions on migration is now available
here 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/18-euco-conclusions-migration/>
.

Some key lines:

 * “The objective must be to rapidly stem the flows, protect our external 
borders, reduce illegal migration and safeguard the integrity of the Schengen 
area.” 
 * “The flows of migrants arriving in Greece from Turkey remain much too high. 
We need to see a substantial and sustainable reduction of the number of illegal 
entries from Turkey into the EU.” 
 * “Humanitarian assistance should continue to be provided to Syrian refugees 
and to the countries neighbouring Syria. This is an urgent global 
responsibility.” 
 * “We need to get back to a situation where all Members of the Schengen area 
apply fully the Schengen borders code and refuse entry at external borders to 
third-country nationals who do not satisfy the entry conditions or who have not 
made an asylum application despite having had the opportunity to do so.”

Angela Merkel has held a press conference in which she discussed the agreement 
among EU leaders to meet with Turkey in March in a further attempt to resolve 
Europe’s migration crisis:

The important statement for me today is that we have not only reaffirmed the 
EU-Turkey action plan, but we have said it is our priority.

Merkel said Austria backed the EU-Turkey plan, despite its unilateral decision 
to introduce daily caps on migrants:

In Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> we are all always 
partners.

David Cameron’s meeting with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker continues – 
we don’t know what they’re saying but the body language is interesting enough:

It also looks likely that German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president 
François Hollandewill meet separately – though reportedly not until the more 
civilised hour of 10am Friday.

migration crisis.

Reuters reports that the meeting has been pencilled in for 5 March.

Renzi 'less optimistic' about UK deal

Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said he was less optimistic than before 
about aEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> deal on new 
membership terms for Britain after some backward steps occurred on the first 
day of an EU summit, Reuters reports.

Speaking to reporters early on Friday after hours of summit debate on 
Britain’s reform demands and the EU’s migration crisis, Renzi said there had 
been “some timid steps forward on migration, some steps back on a UK deal”.

Asked whether he still believed a deal with Britain would be possible on 
Friday, he said:

I’m always confident, but a bit less optimistic than when I arrived.

'A lot still to be done' on UK deal, says Tusk

On the UK deal negotiations, Tusk adds:

For now I can only say that we have made some progress but a lot still remains 
to be done.

He doesn’t take questions from waiting reporters but tells them:

 Thank you and I wish you a good and long night.


Juncker doesn’t speak about the UK talks.

Donald Tusk says the EU leaders have agreed conclusions on migration.

An action plan with Turkey remains the priority, and a meeting should take 
place in March.

 Our discussion in this critical moment of the migration crisis has only 
reinforced our commitment to building a European consensus.


On migration, there is no good alternative to a comprehensive European plan. 
We must look for a synthesis of different approaches.

A European solution on migration is about decisions taken in capitals but we 
must improve the coordination of those decisions.

We need to get back to a situation where all members of the Schengen area 
fully apply the Schengen borders code.

David Cameron has exited – temporarily, Brexit fans! – the talks with Tusk and 
Juncker. I think we can forgive him for not looking relaxed at 5.30am on zero 
sleep.

He’ll reportedly be back for talks at 9am CET.

Out goes Cameron. Not relaxed to say the least. #Brexit

As day one of the summit ticks over into day two with barely a chance for a 
snooze, here are the latest developments:

 * Donald Tusk, president of the European Council and a key broker of any 
potential UK deal, said the negotiations were moving ahead slowly: 
 We have made some progress but a lot still remains to be done.


 * Tusk spoke ahead of a series of bilateral talks, including with British 
prime ministerDavid Cameron, which went late into the night in Brussels. 
 * Talks were said to be sticking on a number of key points 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c65c9fe4b0316343ed8f9e#block-56c65c9fe4b0316343ed8f9e>
, including the duration of the so-called emergency brake to restrict in-work 
benefits for EU migrants in the UK; curbs on child benefit for EU migrants 
whose children are not in the UK; and potential treaty changes to exempt 
formally the UK from the goal of “ever-closer union” and to underpin 
protections for non-eurozone members.  David Cameron and Angela Merkel at the

 * Full discussions between the leaders are due to resume at 11am CET (10am 
GMT), although earlier spin-off talks are mooted to include a meeting between 
Germany’sAngela Merkel, France’s François Hollande and Greece’s Alexis Tsipras 
at 10am CET. 
 * Leaders offered differing verdicts on any hope of a deal, with Italian 
prime ministerMatteo Renzi saying 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c67409e4b0f276c5add29a#block-56c67409e4b0f276c5add29a>
 he was “less optimistic” than he had been. Finnish PMJuha Sipilä suggested 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c66d20e4b0f276c5add293#block-56c66d20e4b0f276c5add293>
 an agreement would be struck by Friday, echoing Spain’sMariano Rajoy, who said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c678bfe4b0f276c5add29e#block-56c678bfe4b0f276c5add29e>
 things were “going well”. But Dutch PMMark Rutte raised the possibility 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c689abe4b0f276c5add2ac#block-56c689abe4b0f276c5add2ac>
 of talks on a UK deal running into Saturday.

 * Agreement was reached 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/refugee-crisis-eu-calls-extraordinary-summit-with-turkey>
 – after adinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/18/david-cameron-heads-for-summit-amid-widening-eu-rifts-live-updates?page=with:block-56c66b58e4b0f276c5add291#block-56c66b58e4b0f276c5add291>
 lasting five-and-a-half hours – on a rescheduled meeting between EU leaders 
and Turkey, pencilled in for 5 March, to address the ongoing migration crisis. 
 * Merkel said the migration talks were the “priority” for the summit: 
 The important statement for me today is that we have not only reaffirmed the 
EU-Turkey action plan, but we have said it is our priority.


 * Ukip leader Nigel Farage said Cameron was acting “rather like Oliver Twist”:
He has come along with his begging bowl, saying please sir, can we have more 
concessions? Most of what you are seeing here is theatre. It’s theatre from Mr 
Cameron and it’s theatre from the other leaders.
 
5am in Brussels. I’m not sure whether this now counts as day one or day two. 
But Cameron appears to have returned to the table with Tusk and Juncker:

Yawn. Bilateral with Michel ended. Now Cameron back in the room again #EUCO

It’s not over yet, though: Tusk and Juncker are reportedly now in a bilateral 
meeting with Belgian PMCharles Michel.
 
Deliberately or not, EU leaders have ensured that the key lines to come out of 
the summit at the end of day one concern migration, rather than Britain’s 
demand for a new deal:

European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> leaders threw their 
weight behind efforts to work with Turkey to limit the flow of refugees to 
Europe, with German chancellor Angela Merkel labelling it a priority in an 
announcement early on Friday.

“The important statement for me today is that we have not only reaffirmed the 
EU-Turkey action plan, but we have said it is our priority,” Merkel said of the
plan to address migration 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/18-euco-conclusions-migration/>
 and border controls.

Merkel noted Austria backed the plan, despite its unilateral decision to 
introduce daily caps on migrants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/austria-dismisses-criticism-of-its-plan-to-limit-daily-refugee-numbers>
. “In Europe we are all always partners,” she said.

The European Council president, Donald Tusk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/donald-tusk>, earlier announced the 
postponed extraordinary summit with Turkey would now be held probably in early 
March.

The “joint action plan with Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> 
remains a priority and we must do all we can to succeed”, he said.

Good news for fans of exceedingly drawn-out negotiations and days-long live 
blogs: Dutch PMMark Rutte says the talks on a UK deal might run into Saturday:

The full text of the European council conclusions on migration is now available
here 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/18-euco-conclusions-migration/>
.

Some key lines:

 * “The objective must be to rapidly stem the flows, protect our external 
borders, reduce illegal migration and safeguard the integrity of the Schengen 
area.” 
 * “The flows of migrants arriving in Greece from Turkey remain much too high. 
We need to see a substantial and sustainable reduction of the number of illegal 
entries from Turkey into the EU.” 
 * “Humanitarian assistance should continue to be provided to Syrian refugees 
and to the countries neighbouring Syria. This is an urgent global 
responsibility.” 
 * “We need to get back to a situation where all Members of the Schengen area 
apply fully the Schengen borders code and refuse entry at external borders to 
third-country nationals who do not satisfy the entry conditions or who have not 
made an asylum application despite having had the opportunity to do so.”  
Angela Merkel has held a press conference in which she discussed the agreement 
among EU leaders to meet with Turkey in March in a further attempt to resolve 
Europe’s migration crisis:

The important statement for me today is that we have not only reaffirmed the 
EU-Turkey action plan, but we have said it is our priority.

Merkel said Austria backed the EU-Turkey plan, despite its unilateral decision 
to introduce daily caps on migrants:

In Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> we are all always 
partners.

David Cameron’s meeting with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker continues – 
we don’t know what they’re saying but the body language is interesting enough:

It also looks likely that German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president 
François Hollandewill meet separately – though reportedly not until the more 
civilised hour of 10am Friday.
 
Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy doesn’t share his Italian counterpart’s 
pessimism

 on the UK/EU talks:

I think it is going well. I hope that tomorrow we will have a deal.
 
Some more details on what is, so far, the only breakthrough of the evening: a 
special summit between EU leaders and Turkey to attempt to resolve the 
migration crisis.

Reuters reports that the meeting has been pencilled in for 5 March.

Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said he was less optimistic than before 
about aEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> deal on new 
membership terms for Britain after some backward steps occurred on the first 
day of an EU summit, Reuters reports.

Speaking to reporters early on Friday after hours of summit debate on 
Britain’s reform demands and the EU’s migration crisis, Renzi said there had 
been “some timid steps forward on migration, some steps back on a UK deal”.

Asked whether he still believed a deal with Britain would be possible on 
Friday, he said:

I’m always confident, but a bit less optimistic than when I arrived.

He doesn’t take questions from waiting reporters but tells them:

 Thank you and I wish you a good and long night.
