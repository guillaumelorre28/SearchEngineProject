Egypt <https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> has pardoned and released two 
al-Jazeera journalists who had been jailed for disseminating “false news” in a 
trial widely criticised as a political charade by human rights groups and 
international observers.

Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mohamed-fahmy> and Egyptian national Baher 
Mohamed <https://www.theguardian.com/world/baher-mohamed> were pardoned by the 
president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, along with about 100 other prisoners, including 
activists and a poet.

Egyptian presidents have traditionally freed prisoners for the Muslim holiday 
of Eid al-Adha, which is celebrated this week. But the latest releases also 
come on the eve of a trip to New York by Sisi, who will attend the UN general 
assembly where he would likely have faced questions about the controversial 
case.

Fahmy, who was released outside his old high school in Cairo after being 
driven there, said he was preparing to celebrate freedom. His lawyer, Amal 
Clooney, welcomed the decision to correct “a long-standing injustice” but said 
her client had endured a protracted ordeal.

A friend, journalist Samer al-Atrush, posted pictures of Fahmy, his wife and 
Mohamed shortly after the men were released, and while they were still wearing 
prison clothes.

It was not clear if Sisi also pardoned a third journalist, Australian Peter 
Greste, who had been on trial with his colleagues and spent 400 days in an 
Egyptian jail before being deported in February under a law allowing prisoners 
to serve out detentions in their home countries.

The state-run Mena news agency said a third person from the al-Jazeera case 
had been pardoned, but there were several other foreign defendants beside 
Greste who avoided jail because they were outside Egypt when police arrested 
the three men.

“Reminder that as well as Baher and Fahmy, there are seven other [al-Jazeera 
journalists] convicted in absentia whose lives have been affected,” the 
network’s spokesman Osama Saeed said on Twitter.

The case had drawn condemnation from around the world, including from the US 
secretary of state, John Kerry, and Australia’s new prime minister, Malcolm 
Turnbull, who had promised Greste he would push for a pardon.

A spokeswoman for Canada’s foreign affairs department, Rachna Mishra, 
reportedly said Canada was pleased with the pardon and would help facilitate 
Fahmy’s departure. “We look forward to Mr Fahmy reuniting with his family and 
loved ones, and his return to Canada,” she told AP.

 Peter Greste receives news of al-Jazeera journalists’ pardons 
Fahmy gave up his Egyptian nationality during the trial in hope of being 
deported to Canada.

He has also distanced himself from al-Jazeera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/20/mohamed-fahmy-al-jazeera-protecting-journalists-cairo-agenda>
, where he worked for the English-language channel, accusing the network of 
placing him and his colleagues in danger, lying about the channel’s legal 
status in Egypt and displaying editorial bias in favour of Islamists. He is 
suing the network for damages in a Canadian court. Al Jazeera denies the claim.
