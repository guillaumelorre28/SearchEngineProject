For the next president of the United States, the Oval Office will come with 
more than 11mTwitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> followers 
and a new handle.


Barack Obama was the first US president to be on the platform, drawing 11.1m 
followers to the verified@POTUS account <https://twitter.com/potus> since 
signing up in May 2015.

The next president will take over the handle on Inauguration Day, 20 January 
2017, but the slate will be wiped clean of tweets.

Obama’s 317 posts will be archived at a newly created handle, @POTUS44, by the 
National Archives and Records Administration.

The same will happen with Obama’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, along with 
other presences on Twitter, such asMichelle Obama’s @FLOTUS 
<https://twitter.com/flotus>, Joe Biden’s @VP <https://twitter.com/vp>, 
@WhiteHouse <https://twitter.com/whitehouse> and @PressSec 
<https://twitter.com/presssec>.
Vice President Biden (@VP) 
Happy 55th, Barack! A brother to me, a best friend forever.

Obama is leaving office with far more digital content to preserve than any 
previous president, with Spotify playlistsfrom both this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/barack-obama-workout-playlist-proves-master-eclectic-mixtape>
 and last, and appearances on Facebook Live and Snapchat among the artefacts to 
be archived.

The thousands of hours of video and millions of photos are being transferred 
to digital archives that will eventually be available to download in compact 
form, like zip files.

“This digital infrastructure is an asset not just for the next president but 
for all future presidents to build off of,” wrote Kori Schulman, the deputy 
chief digital officer at the White House,in a statement 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/10/31/digital-transition-how-presidential-transition-works-social-media-age>
. “The archive belongs to the American people.

“From tweets to snaps, all of the material we’ve published online will be 
preserved with Nara just as previous administrations have done with records 
ranging from handwritten notes to faxes to emails.”

Schulman said a smooth digital transition – much of which was unprecedented, 
given the technological advances over the last eight years – was a priority for 
the White House.

“We are working to ensure that the next president and administration – 
regardless of party – can continue to use and develop the digital assets we 
have created to connect directly with the people they serve.”

The @POTUS Twitter account will only be “made available” to the next 
president, suggesting the successful candidate could choose to continue using 
their existing handle.

Both presidential candidates already have huge followings on Twitter, with 
Hillary Clinton followed by 10.1m people at@HillaryClinton 
<https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton> and Donald Trump 12.8m at @realDonaldTrump 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump> – nearly 2m more than the @POTUS account.

Clinton has tweeted close to 9,500 times since she signed up to the platform 
on 11 June 2013, inspired by the now-infamous viral photograph of her checking 
her Blackberry on a plane as secretary of state.

But Trump was an early adopter, sending his first tweet on 5 May 2009. Since 
then he has made close to 34,000 posts.
