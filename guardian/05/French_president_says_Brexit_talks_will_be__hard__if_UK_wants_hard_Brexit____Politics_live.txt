Afternoon summary

 * François Hollande, the French president, has said that the Brexit talks 
will be “hard” if Britain insists on a hard Brexit.Speaking as he arrived at 
the EU summit in Brussels, he said: 
I have said it very clearly; Madame Theresa May wants a hard Brexit, then 
talks will be hard too.

 * Downing Street has left the door open to removing foreign students from net 
migration figures, after the chancellor hinted he thought they should not be 
counted.

 * It is “not in the national interest” for the government to reveal its 
Brexit plans before negotiations with the European Union, David Davis has told 
the Commons during his first interrogation by MPs as the minister in charge of 
the process. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/hilary-benn-brexit-wont-obstruct-britain-exit-eu>
 * Theresa May has called on EU leaders to put pressure on Russia to stop its 
“appalling, sickening” atrocities in Syria. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/may-european-leaders-stop-russian-atrocities-syria-brexi>
 * MPs have backed a call for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his 
knighthood in the wake of the BHS scandal.

 * A draft bill on a second independence referendum has been published by the 
Scottish government after the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, pledged to hold 
a new poll in the event of a hard Brexit in a direct challenge to Theresa May. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/second-scottish-independence-referendum-bill-published>
 * Ideas for a regional visa system have been set out by the local authority 
for London’s financial district in an attempt to avoid staff shortages after 
the vote to leave the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/city-of-london-weighs-up-regional-visa-system-to-avoid-post-brexit-staff-gaps>
 * Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has said Britain is using cyber 
warfare in the bid to retake Mosul from Islamic State.Speaking at an 
international conference on waging war through advanced technology, Fallon made 
it clear Britain was unleashing its cyber capability on IS, also known as 
Daesh. Asked if the UK was launching cyber attacks in the bid to take the 
northern Iraqi city from IS, he replied: 
I’m not going into operational specifics, but yes, you know we are conducting 
military operations against Daesh as part of the international coalition, and I 
can confirm that we are using offensive cyber for the first time in this 
campaign.

That’s all from me for today, and for another 10 days. I’ll put up a readers’ 
edition blog next week, and next week I’ll be off for the half-term break. My 
colleagues Jessica Elgot, Haroon Siddique and Peter Walker will be driving the 
blog in my place.

Thanks for the comments.

Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, has reaffirmed his 
opposition to the EU starting Brexit negotiations with the UK until article 50 
is invoked. He posted these messages on Twitter.

More people want Brexit talks to prioritise single market access than curbing 
immigration, poll suggests

Ipsos MORI has published some polling today suggesting that more people think 
the UK should prioritise access to the single market in the Brexit negotiations 
(45%) than think it should prioritise controlling immigration (39%). 
<https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3795/Public-divided-on-prioritising-access-to-the-Single-Market-or-controlling-immigration.aspx>
This is significant because the Theresa May has made it clear that she sees 
controlling immigration as more important, although May and other ministers 
insist both objectives are achievable.
Ben Page, Ipsos MORI (@benatipsosmori) 
New - The public now clearly puts access to the single market (45%) over 
controlling immigration (39%) in#brexit 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/brexit?src=hash> - but remains split.

2016 <https://twitter.com/benatipsosmori/status/789076214296215552> 
As Ipsos MORI says, opinion is split largely in line with how people voted in 
the referendum.

Public opinion is largely split along the lines of how specific groups tended 
to vote in the referendum on EU membership. The single market is the priority 
for professionals and skilled workers with more than half (54%) of ABC1s and 
two in three (67%) graduates preferring Britain to put this option first. This 
compares with those in social classes C2DE preferring to prioritise immigration 
control (51%), as do those without a qualification (53%).

There is also a clear age difference. Fifty-seven percent of 18-34 year olds 
favour access to the single market (24% favour immigration control) compared 
with 32% of those aged 55+ (50% of whom favour immigration control).

Jeremy Corbyn has accused the prime minister of delaying the government’s 
commitment to bringing lone child refugees to the UK, including those who do 
not have family in the UK.

The Labour leader said it was “worryingly unclear what system the Government 
has in place to continue to identify and register children to see who might be 
eligible.”

Child refugees have two legal routes to enter the UK, the first under the EU’s 
Dublin Regulation to reunite children with families already in the UK, and the 
second is the government’s commitment in the so-called Dubs amendment to the 
Immigration Act.

Under this amendment, introduced by Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who arrived in 
the UK as a Kindertransport child refugee, the government pledged to take an 
unspecified number of unaccompanied refugee children, without them having 
family ties.

At the time of the amendment in May, Home Office sources briefed around 3,000 
would be allowed into the UK, though since the act was passed it appears that 
no children have arrived in the UK under its provisions.

In a letter to Theresa May, Corbyn said there was an “obvious delay in 
implementing the Alf Dubs amendment and commitments to help child refugees.”

Today Corbyn has been meeting Labour MEPs and others in Brussels.

Here are some more tweets from Laura Kuenssberg from the EU summit.
Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) 
May hardly mentioned Brexit on way in - chose to focus on Russia instead, one 
of main items on agenda

and will be a strong and dependable partner after we've left'

Tusk says Summit isn't a 'lion's den' but a 'nest of doves' for UK But warns 
May again not to try even for informal talks

<https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/789083329979092992> 
Tusk is Donald Tusk, the president of the European council.
Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) 
Not exactly a warm welcome, from Tusk this is 'a request to Theresa May, only 
a short information, not discussions'

decide what it wants first before any proper conversations

This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, who is at the EU summit in Brussels.

negotiations will be hard'

Back to Brexit for a moment. This morning David Davis, the Brexit secretary, 
told MPs that Norway trades perfectly well with Sweden even though it is 
outside the customs union. (See10.13am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/20/philip-green-knighthood-commons-set-to-debate-stripping-philip-green-of-his-knighthood-politics-live?page=with:block-58088a42e4b005f21833b606#block-58088a42e4b005f21833b606>
 But in the comments BTL acme and maxfisher have both flagged up this blog by L 
Alan Winters, an economics professor and head of the UK Trade Policy 
Observatory (UKTPO), about Sweden and Brexit. He says:

Swedish exporters find exporting to Norway far more troublesome than exporting 
within the EU. This chimes with the UKTPO’s argument that the EEA is not a 
simple alternative to belonging to the EU customs union and Single Market (see:
Roos And Rules: Why The EEA Is Not The Same As Membership Of The Single Market 
Briefing Paper 
<https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=briefing-paper-3.pdf&site=18>

Green's knighthood - What happens next?

Here is the amendment MPs have passed.

[This House] noting that Philip Green received his knighthood for his services 
for the retail industry, believes his actions raise the question of whether he 
should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour and calls on the 
honours forfeiture committee to recommend his knighthood be cancelled and 
annulled.

MPs voted in favour by acclamation. (Voting always starts with the speaker, or 
deputy speaker, asking if MPs are in favour of a motion. If they all shout 
“aye”, and no one shouts “no”, as happened on this occasion, the motion gets 
passed without a formal division. That is not quite the same as the Commons 
voting unanimously in favour of something, because many MPs were not in the 
chamber. But no MPs spoke out against Green losing his knighthood.)

It is now up to the honours forfeiture committee, a group of civil servants 
chaired by Sir Sir Jonathan Stephens, permanent secretary at the Northern 
Ireland Office, to decide what to do. It does not have to obey the House of 
Commons in this matter but, given the importance the government places on 
parliamentary sovereignty in the context of Brexit, it would be odd for Heywood 
and his committee to snub the Commons on this.

Of course, if Green were to act speedily and generously to make up the 
shortfall in theBHS <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs> pension fund, as 
MPs demanded, the committee could decide that that somehow superseded the 
Commons vote.

UPDATE: The original post wrongly said the forfeiture committee is chaired by 
Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary. But it is chaired by Sir Jonathan 
Stephens.

 * Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has said Britain is using cyber 
warfare in the bid to retake Mosul from Islamic State.Speaking at an 
international conference on waging war through advanced technology, Fallon made 
it clear Britain was unleashing its cyber capability on IS, also known as 
Daesh. Asked if the UK was launching cyber attacks in the bid to take the 
northern Iraqi city from IS, he replied: 
I’m not going into operational specifics, but yes, you know we are conducting 
military operations against Daesh as part of the international coalition, and I 
can confirm that we are using offensive cyber for the first time in this 
campaign.

That’s all from me for today, and for another 10 days. I’ll put up a readers’ 
edition blog next week, and next week I’ll be off for the half-term break. My 
colleagues Jessica Elgot, Haroon Siddique and Peter Walker will be driving the 
blog in my place.

Thanks for the comments.

Ipsos MORI has published some polling today suggesting that more people think 
the UK should prioritise access to the single market in the Brexit negotiations 
(45%) than think it should prioritise controlling immigration (39%). 
<https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3795/Public-divided-on-prioritising-access-to-the-Single-Market-or-controlling-immigration.aspx>
This is significant because the Theresa May has made it clear that she sees 
controlling immigration as more important, although May and other ministers 
insist both objectives are achievable.

As Ipsos MORI says, opinion is split largely in line with how people voted in 
the referendum.

Public opinion is largely split along the lines of how specific groups tended 
to vote in the referendum on EU membership. The single market is the priority 
for professionals and skilled workers with more than half (54%) of ABC1s and 
two in three (67%) graduates preferring Britain to put this option first. This 
compares with those in social classes C2DE preferring to prioritise immigration 
control (51%), as do those without a qualification (53%).

There is also a clear age difference. Fifty-seven percent of 18-34 year olds 
favour access to the single market (24% favour immigration control) compared 
with 32% of those aged 55+ (50% of whom favour immigration control).

Jeremy Corbyn has accused the prime minister of delaying the government’s 
commitment to bringing lone child refugees to the UK, including those who do 
not have family in the UK.

The Labour leader said it was “worryingly unclear what system the Government 
has in place to continue to identify and register children to see who might be 
eligible.”

Child refugees have two legal routes to enter the UK, the first under the EU’s 
Dublin Regulation to reunite children with families already in the UK, and the 
second is the government’s commitment in the so-called Dubs amendment to the 
Immigration Act.

Under this amendment, introduced by Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who arrived in 
the UK as a Kindertransport child refugee, the government pledged to take an 
unspecified number of unaccompanied refugee children, without them having 
family ties.

At the time of the amendment in May, Home Office sources briefed around 3,000 
would be allowed into the UK, though since the act was passed it appears that 
no children have arrived in the UK under its provisions.

In a letter to Theresa May, Corbyn said there was an “obvious delay in 
implementing the Alf Dubs amendment and commitments to help child refugees.”

Today Corbyn has been meeting Labour MEPs and others in Brussels.

Back to Brexit for a moment. This morning David Davis, the Brexit secretary, 
told MPs that Norway trades perfectly well with Sweden even though it is 
outside the customs union. (See10.13am.)

 But in the comments BTL acme and maxfisher have both flagged up this blog by L 
Alan Winters, an economics professor and head of the UK Trade Policy 
Observatory (UKTPO), about Sweden and Brexit. He says:

Swedish exporters find exporting to Norway far more troublesome than exporting 
within the EU. This chimes with the UKTPO’s argument that the EEA is not a 
simple alternative to belonging to the EU customs union and Single Market (see:

Here is my colleague David Conn on the Commons vote.

MPs vote to strip Sir Philip Green 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green> of knighthood - but his 
business practices were all known when he got it, and he was made a govt 
advisor.

Here is the amendment MPs have passed.

[This House] noting that Philip Green received his knighthood for his services 
for the retail industry, believes his actions raise the question of whether he 
should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour and calls on the 
honours forfeiture committee to recommend his knighthood be cancelled and 
annulled.

MPs voted in favour by acclamation. (Voting always starts with the speaker, or 
deputy speaker, asking if MPs are in favour of a motion. If they all shout 
“aye”, and no one shouts “no”, as happened on this occasion, the motion gets 
passed without a formal division. That is not quite the same as the Commons 
voting unanimously in favour of something, because many MPs were not in the 
chamber. But no MPs spoke out against Green losing his knighthood.)

It is now up to the honours forfeiture committee, a group of civil servants 
chaired by Sir Sir Jonathan Stephens, permanent secretary at the Northern 
Ireland Office, to decide what to do. It does not have to obey the House of 
Commons in this matter but, given the importance the government places on 
parliamentary sovereignty in the context of Brexit, it would be odd for Heywood 
and his committee to snub the Commons on this.

Of course, if Green were to act speedily and generously to make up the 
shortfall in theBHS <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs> pension fund, as 
MPs demanded, the committee could decide that that somehow superseded the 
Commons vote.

UPDATE: The original post wrongly said the forfeiture committee is chaired by 
Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary. But it is chaired by Sir Jonathan 
Stephens.
