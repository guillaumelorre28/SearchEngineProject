What were you hoping for?
A lovely, pleasant evening, eating fine food.

First impressions?
Bouncy, confident and good fun. I don’t think she’s a shy woman.

What did you talk about?
Books, families and our potted biographies. The world was a better place in 
the morning.

Any awkward moments?
None whatsoever.

Good table manners?
Yes, she’s a smart, sophisticated woman and totally at home in an upmarket 
restaurant.

Best thing about Amanda?
Her warmth and spontaneity.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
No problem – she would get on well with all of them.

Describe her in three words.
Intelligent, bubbly and good-looking.

What do you think she made of you?
Craggy old git.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, it was already gone 10pm when we left the restaurant.

And... did you kiss?
Only on the cheeks to say goodnight.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
Nothing.

Marks out of 10?
10

Would you meet again?
I’ve already invited her up to see my etchings.
