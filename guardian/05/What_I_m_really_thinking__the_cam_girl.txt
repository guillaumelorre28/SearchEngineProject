I tried webcam work for the first time at the age of 20, when I found myself 
homeless with my three-year-old daughter. A friend said we could stay with her 
while I tried to save some money, and she mentioned that she worked as a “cam 
girl”.

The first time I logged on was terrible. I was scared and found it hard to 
deal with the way clients talk to you and the strange things they ask you to 
do. I don’t tolerate sexism and view porn as incredibly damaging for women. I 
made a deal with myself to stop as soon as I was back on my feet. It wasn’t 
what I’d been expecting (someone wanted me to cover myself in custard; another 
paid me to sit motionless, back to the camera, and got angry when I sneezed).

Mostly, though, it’s very boring, sitting in free chat answering the same 
questions about your age, bra size, location, real name, bra size and bra size. 
After a while, I got used to it and managed to make around £1,500 a week 
working two hours each night. That’s not the usual amount I make; I just got 
very lucky. I did try bar work for a while, but it was 12-hour shifts for 
slightly less than the minimum wage, so I soon went back to cam work.

I still work on camera when I have no alternative. It’s a lot harder to make 
money now, thanks to the growing numbers of broke young people resorting to 
this sort of work. I’ve had to weigh up the risk it poses to any future job and 
to my love life.

I don’t know how or if I’d talk to my daughter about it. The media are quick 
to glamorise this job, but the truth is, it’s emotionally and morally draining. 
I hate objectifying myself.
