First impressions?
A really friendly face that puts you at ease straight away.

Our families and our favourite foods.

Any awkward moments?
We tried to guess each other’s age and he thought I was two years older.

Really good.

He is very engaging and you feel like he is interested in what you’re saying.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Yeah, I’m sure he’d get on with them.

Describe him in three words
Smiley, inquisitive, driven.

What do you think he made of you?
He may have thought I was more mature and sorted than the average 23-year-old.

Did you go on somewhere?
Only to Victoria train station for our onward journeys; it was a school night 
after all.

And... did you kiss?
No.

Not a lot really, it was very enjoyable.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Padraig on Aidan


What were you hoping for?
Ultimately, to find “the one” and have it be a story to tell the grandkids.


First impressions?
A warm smile.

What did you talk about?
Honduras. Our last supper if we were on death row. Irish life on the farm. 
Twitter and why he should join it.

Any awkward moments?
I literally ate a loaf of bread – I don’t like to waste food.

Good table manners?
Impeccable.

Best thing about Aidan?
His ability to listen – I can talk for Ireland.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Yeah.

Describe him in three words
Courteous, kind, sanguine.

What do you think he made of you?
Maybe more life-experienced – he’d left uni more recently.

I’d have happily had more wine but he was working early.

And... did you kiss?
A peck on the cheek.
