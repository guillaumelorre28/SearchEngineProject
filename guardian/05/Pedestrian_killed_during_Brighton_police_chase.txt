A hunt is under way for a hit-and-run driver who left a pedestrian for dead in 
the middle of the road during a police chase.


The victim died at the scene after being struck by a Vauxhall Astra as police 
chased the vehicle in St James’s Street, Brighton, yards from the Palace Pier.


The driver abandoned the car a short distance from the crash on Madeira Drive, 
near the Concorde 2 music venue.


Sussex police said the pursuit took place after the Astra failed to stop for 
officers at about 10pm on Tuesday in the Bear Road area.


A spokesman said: “Officers pursued the car towards Brighton where the 
Vauxhall collided with a pedestrian on St James’s Street. The pedestrian sadly 
died at the scene.”


The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an 
investigation into the incident.


Crime <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime> officers in white forensics 
suits combed the crash scene for clues as a tent stood in the middle of the 
sealed-off road.


Locals described their shock at the death. Pat Hogan, 70, said he knew the 
victim, who has not been formally identified, as a “very nice, quiet man”.


He said: “I feel awful. It knocks you for six. If you knock someone down you 
have to stop, you don’t just drive off.”


Barry Salvage, 68, who lives in the Kemptown area of the city, said: “It’s 
terrible. I hope they find whoever did it and bang them up.”


No details of the identity or age of the victim have been released. 

Some roads into Brighton were choked with traffic as police closed large 
sections of the Old Steine area.


A spokesman for the IPCC said: “We were alerted by Sussex police to the fatal 
road traffic incident in Brighton yesterday evening.


“The IPCC deployed investigators straight away and we have since begun an 
independent investigation into the circumstances of the police pursuit.”
