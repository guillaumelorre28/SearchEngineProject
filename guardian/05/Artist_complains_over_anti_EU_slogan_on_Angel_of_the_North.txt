The sculptor Antony Gormley <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gormley> 
has complained to the Vote Leave campaign after the group emblazoned its 
anti-EU logo on his Angel of the North statue.

The message “Vote Leave Take Control” with a red ballot box was projected on 
the 54-metre wingspan of the sculpture near Gateshead in Tyne and Wear last 
week. It prompted Gormley to send a letter to the group, which claims to bethe 
official leave campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/03/vote-leave-says-it-will-be-official-brexit-campaign-in-referendum>
. Its high-profile members include the justice secretary, Michael Gove, and 
Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston.

Sent to Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, the letter seen by the 
Chronicle says 
<http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/angel-north-stunt-prompts-anger-11047235>
: “As an artist with a substantial reputation in the United Kingdom and 
worldwide, it amounts to ‘passing off’ to suggest a false endorsement by, or by 
connection with, Sir Antony in connection with the activities and political 
purposes of Vote Leave Limited.

“Presumably the reputation of the work and its instantly recognisable 
character were the reasons that it was selected for the projection or digital 
manipulation.”

The Angel of the North, one of Britain’s most distinctive pieces of public 
art, has been hijacked before. In 2014, the supermarket chainMorrisons 
projected an image of a baguette on to the wings of Gormley’s sculpture

. The supermarket subsequently apologised.

A few months after it was unveiled in 1998, some Newcastle United fans draped 
a giant replica No 9 shirt <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/92891.stm>, in 
tribute to the club’s former centre-forward Alan Shearer, across the chest of 
the statue using fishing lines, rubber balls and catapults.

Gormley has described his sculpture as a link between the region’s coal-mining 
past and the information age. “The hilltop site is important and has the 
feeling of being a megalithic mound. When you think of the mining that was done 
underneath the site, there is a poetic resonance. Men worked beneath the 
surface in the dark. Now, in the light, there is a celebration of this 
industry.”

A Gateshead council spokesperson said: “It’s very disappointing that our 
iconic structures have been misused in this way, particularly as the council 
welcomes the benefits that Gateshead residents receive from UK membership of the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

“It’s also somewhat ironic that both the Angel of the North and Baltic [art 
centre] actually benefited from European regional development funding, along 
with many other important projects in Gateshead.”
