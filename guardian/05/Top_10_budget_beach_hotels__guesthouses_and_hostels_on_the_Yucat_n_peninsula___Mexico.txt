Beachscape Kin Ha Villas & Suites, Cancún

On the surface, this mid-size hotel in Cancún’s hotel zone is pretty 
unremarkable. The tile-floored rooms are big and clean, with terraces or 
balconies – though they’re not notably stylish. The restaurant is good, not 
gourmet. The pool is a sensible size. But set this against its glitzy, 
high-rise neighbours and check the rates, which are often lower than similarly 
appointed hotels on the mainland, 30 minutes from the water – and Beachscape 
starts looking pretty good. Then walk out on to the palm-shaded beach, one of 
the prettiest stretches in the hotel zone, and the place becomes a minor 
miracle.

Travel In’, Mahahual

Usually, a full beach-bum escape means limiting your diet to coconut drinks 
and fish dinners. But at this Dutch-run restaurant and guesthouse, four miles 
down the coast from Mahahual town, you can also enjoy an ever-changing menu 
that ranges from curry to baked aubergine. There are only two rooms. The big 
suite has a well-stocked library and large French doors through which you can 
see the water (the beach here is shaded by both palms and pines). A smaller, 
rustic cabin has screens on all four sides and a separate cold-water shower 
nearby.

 The beach at Isla de Mujeres. Photograph: Alamy 
At this blocky old hotel in Isla’s main town, a few blocks from the Cancún 
ferry terminal, the rooms are standard Mexican budget-style: scuffed but clean 
tiled floors, lemon-yellow walls and bathrooms done in delectable mint-green 
tiles – floor, walls and all. There are screens on the windows, the ceiling 
fans work and the price hasn’t changed in almost a decade. What more could a 
budget traveller ask for? Oh, yes, the name lives up to its promise: from the 
wide front veranda, there is indeed a view of the pale-blue sea, glinting 
through palm trees. You need only cross the road to get to the white-sand beach 
and wade right into the water.

The few remaining bare-bones cabañas that made Tulum famous on the backpacker 
trail are now unreasonably expensive – for sand floors and shared showers. 
Better to pay a bit more and get some comfort for your money. Nueva Vida de 
Ramiro, near the southern end of Tulum’s long, flawless, white-sand beach, is 
notable for its lush, forest-like setting. Its 32 rooms – some sturdy 
cement-walled buildings and some wooden cabins – are tucked into dense 
greenery, for privacy. You get a ceiling fan, a proper tiled floor and even a 
private bathroom – with an outdoor shower, to conjure the wild-beach days past.

Probably the most overlooked town on the Riviera Maya, Puerto Morelos lives in 
the shadow of Cancún, 20 minutes north. PoMo, as repeat visitors call the town, 
has low buildings, a wide, quiet beach lined with fishing boats and a handful 
of hotels, all inexpensive. Though it’s a few minutes’ walk from the water, 
Posada el Moro is the best option, with shady, well cared-for rooms with 
ceiling fans and optional aircon, plus a small pool in the garden. The 
continental breakfast isn’t much better than a hostel’s, but no matter – 
another feature of PoMo is its excellent budget restaurants.

While the rest of the island of Cozumel is cushy all-inclusive resorts, 
Ventanas al Mar stands alone on the east side of the island, facing the open 
Caribbean – an ideal perch for anyone in search of solitude. This is the 
windward coast, so the water is seldom calm enough for swimming, but just north 
of the hotel lies a small, empty beach dotted with shells. Plus, that wind 
comes in handy – it provides all the power for the hotel. At night, the skies 
are utterly dark, and you’ll be lulled to sleep by the waves crashing against 
the rocks below.

Years ago, most of Playa’s hippie beach bars and hostels converted to slicker, 
louder operations. But for both sleeping and nightlife, Fusion conjures the 
feel of Playa the way old-timers remember it – with just a bit more polish. The 
bar has low tables and chairs in the sand, lit by hurricane lamps, and mellow 
live music and fire-spinning most nights. The rooms are simple, with stone 
floors, heavy local wood furniture and colourful bedspreads, but they do have 
aircon and TV. Forgo the pricey sea views – you’ll be glad of the quieter, 
cheaper rooms in the back when you turn in from the beach party.

Don’t write this place off when you hear it’s a trailer park – the people who 
live on this small, private bay, in crafty homes built around their camper 
vans, keep the area tidy. Short-term guests have the choice of rooms in a small 
hotel block or (cheaper) wood cabañas with palm-thatch roofs (screened in, so 
the bits don’t fall on you). All have private facilities and are steps from the 
beach. Past the rocky point at the bay’s south side, the empty beach stretches 
for more than a mile, the longest stretch of undeveloped land in the Riviera 
Maya.

On a lightly developed island in the Gulf of Mexico, this is the kind of place 
that restores faith in hostels. Almost entirely hand-built, it looks quirky but 
is smartly designed for good ventilation in all the cheerfully painted dorms 
and private rooms. Guests can cook in the huge communal kitchen, kick back in 
the groovy bar tucked up in the trees and, on rainy days, chill out in the 
movie room. The beach is half a block a way, and you even get a cute, 
hand-drawn map to guide you around the sand-street town.

To get to this classic old Mexican beach hotel, you basically go straight: 
straight west on the highway from Mérida, then straight through town. Check in 
to your tiled room with its hard-working ceiling fan (aircon is optional), then 
walk straight again, into the milky-green water of the Gulf of Mexico. The 
place is busy during Mexican holidays (July and August, Easter week, 
Christmas), but at other times, you’ll only share the place with the handful of 
tourists who come to see the flamingoes in the nearby lagoon. Put up a hammock 
on your tree-shaded balcony and enjoy the solitude.
