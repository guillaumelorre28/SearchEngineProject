Rates on two-year, fixed-rate mortgages – already at record lows – could fall 
even further because of tough competition among lenders to attract new 
customers, according to leading City analysts.

Super-cheap home loans could give the market a boost after the vote for 
Brexit, which forced Threadneedle Street tocut rates to 0.25% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates>
 in August. This was the first rate-cut for more than seven years and 
economists expect the Bank to cut the base rate again – to just 0.1% – possibly 
in November.

According to analysts at Bernstein, which is based in the City, another rate 
cut from the Bank of England would drive standard two-year fixed-rate mortgages 
to 1.1% – and to less than 1% for customers with a good credit rating.

The analysts at Bernstein said that customers looking for two-year fixed-rate 
mortgage with deposit of at least 20% of the value of the property would 
currently pay between 1.6% and 1.7%. “The bet is that it gets another 50 basis 
points [half a percentage point] cheaper,” the analysts said.

They calculate mortgage rates could reach 1.1% by the middle of next year, 
adding: “If your credit rating is fine, you are probably going to get a cheaper 
mortgage from either a bank with excess deposits (HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland) 
or ones desperate to grow their book – that’s sub 100 basis points (1%).”

HSBC is already offering a mortgage rate of 0.99% for two years  
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/21/hsbc-fixed-rate-mortgage-below-1-per-cent-interest-rate>
for customers with a deposit of at least 35% – but no other bank is offering 
rates lower than 1%. Repayments on a £150,000 mortgage are £565 a month, 
according to David Hollingworth, of mortgage brokers London and Country, 
although the product has a fee of £1,499 which could prove expensive for 
customers with smaller loans.

The Bernstein analysts argue that rate cuts will be generated by competition 
in the mortgage market – traditionally dominated by six players controlling 
around 75% of lending – and the fact that it is relatively cheap for lenders to 
attract new customers.

Figures from a property website, Rightmove, published on Monday show that 
house prices are up 4% on last September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/19/uk-first-time-buyers-hit-by-steeper-rises-in-starter-home-prices>
. Hollingworth said that any further rate would spur activity in the market – 
even through rates are already record lows.
