Preacher (season one finale available now)
Preacher may already have lost you from its congregation. But wait. Come back! 
The badass tale of pastor Jesse Custer gaining superpowers from God did perhaps 
start outtoo bonkers to have broad appeal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jul/18/the-problem-with-preacher-why-no-ones-talking-about-the-best-show-of-the-year>
, but it’d be well worth your while to revisit it. Humans are being fed to 
vampires now, and angels are having truly epic fights in motels. The more it’s 
strayed from the original comic book, the more gripping it’s become.

Mr Robot (new episodes available every Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/mr-robot-episode-by-episode>)
Now that Evil Corp seems to have bulwarked itself against Elliot’s hacking 
collective, f.soc, has Mr Robot’s second outing lost its oomph – or is western 
civilisation as we know it still on the cusp of combustion?

Halt and Catch Fire (available weekly from 24 August)
My TV highlight of the summer: the return of AMC’s gripping, sterling drama 
about the punks, programmers and ginormous personal computers of the 80s tech 
scene. It should be as popular and iconic as Mad Men, but is still sadly
underseen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/27/tvs-most-underrated-shows-pulling-top-gear-time-trumpet>
. Get cracking now and catch up before season three kicks off.

I Love Dick (available from 19 August)
Transparent creator Jill Soloway’s adaptation of the cult feminist classic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/02/i-love-dick-sex-chris-kraus-men-women-book>
 about a woman who becomes obsessed with her husband’s friend – then discusses 
how to seduce him endlessly with her spouse. It was a radical and revolutionary 
novel, so let’s hope the show lives up to it (Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Hahn 
star, so the odds are looking good). Only the pilot is available to watch at 
present, but if you’re a fan, vote for it to be commissioned for a full series. 
Also part of Pilot Season isThe Interestings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/21/interestings-meg-wolitzer-review>
, based on Meg Wolitzer’s bestseller about a bunch of wide-eyed creative kids 
who meet at summer camp – then find that hardly any of their dreams come true 
as they descend into the drudgery of adulthood.

 Cheesy singalong … Jersey Boys. Photograph: Warner Br/Everett/REX 
Clint Eastwood’s cheesy singalong remake of the hit Broadway musical about 
Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.

Dheepan
Jacques Audiard’s Palme D’Or winner is an exhilarating crime drama about Tamil 
refugees in Paris. A rare and mysterious treat.

Tammy
Susan Sarandon plays Melissa McCarthy’s grandma – I’ll just leave that with 
you – in this silly road movie about cruising for guys and robbing fast-food 
joints. Thelma and Louise it is not.

Argo
Ben Affleck’s smart Oscar-winning comedy, based on the incredible true story 
of a bogus film shoot in Tehran, dreamed up by the CIA to save US embassy 
workers who’d been taken hostage.

Bastille Day
Brash terrorism thriller starring Idris Elba as a macho CIA agent.

The Dark Knight Rises
The spectacular final movie in Christopher Nolan’s Batman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/batman> trilogy.
