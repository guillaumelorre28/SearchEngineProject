Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> will do more to 
tackle harassment and abuse on its network, the company has said, as it 
announces a new safety council made up of specialist charities and a slate of 
new anti-harassment features that will roll out through 2016.

Twitter UK’s head of policy, Nick Pickles, said that the global council would 
include the mental health charity the Samaritans, the advice charity the Safer 
Internet Centre, and theInternet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet> Watch Foundation, a 
specialist organisation that deals with criminal content including child abuse 
material.

“I don’t think we will have all the answers, but it is important to seek 
expertise in these still very young issues,” he said. “We want to make sure we 
hear different views and think about these challenges in the fullest and most 
nuanced way.”

Pickles said there wouldn’t be one particular safety project but “regular and 
consistent action” through the year. “This comes from the top of the company – 
safety is never finished.”

Twitter has been heavily

criticised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/05/feminist-campaigner-police-twitter-rape-threats>
 for failing to provide adequate and responsive protections for users who have 
been the subject of extreme abuse or threats. Laws in the UK offer users some 
protection against more extreme harassment and several people have been jailed, 
yet most countries, including the US, have no such protections.

Twitter, which sees an average 500m individual tweets every day, has struggled 
to strike a balance between allowing free speech and protecting users from 
abusive comments. Former CEODick Costolo told staff 
<http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the>
 in 2015 that Twitter needed to do more. “We suck at dealing with abuse and 
trolls on the platform and we’ve sucked at it for years,” he wrote in an 
internal memo.

“Safety and freedom of speech go hand in hand,” Pickles said. “The unique 
thing aboutTwitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> as a public 
platform is that what I have to say can be seen by anyone anywhere in the 
world, and it has the power to challenge views. Twitter’s sum is greater than 
its parts.”

Pickles said Twitter’s users had to have the confidence to speak out on 
subjects that mattered to them without the threat of being “silenced by the 
mob”, and said this is an “everyday discussion” among staff.

While the issue of abusive and aggressive messages has been an important one 
for Twitter, the company is also facing its own torrent of abusive messages 
from users angry at proposed changes to the service, including allowing tweets 
of up to 10,000 characters from the current limit of 140, and changing the 
order of messages in the timeline.

In the latest round of complaints – tagged #RIPTwitter and trending on the 
site for at least a day – some users rounded on one low-profile Twitter 
employee who expressed shock at being targeted with negative messages about the 
changes.
