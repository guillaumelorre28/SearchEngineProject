I’m a hopeless fruit romantic. I go in search of the perfect stone fruit every 
year. Keep your summer berries – it’s when the rosy-cheeked apricots, 
golden-fleshed peaches and cheerful little pairs of cherries show up that I get 
the most excited. This week it’s all peaches and apricots, the first proudly 
Italian, the second from France.

Perfect stone fruit can be elusive – it’s all in the choosing. Pick the ripest 
fruit from the greengrocer’s; you’re searching for the softest, 
deepest-coloured ones. Leave any harder ones in a shallow bowl in a single 
layer to ripen. After a couple of days warming in the June sun, they will 
become softer, sweeter and more interesting. I think you need to pick and feel 
a stone fruit just like you do an avocado. If they are particularly stubborn 
and refuse to ripen, the best place for them is in a quick compote or a jam.

If I’m lucky enough to chance upon an entire box of glowing, honeyed apricots, 
I’ll eat them as they are over the sink or with a tea towel on my lap to catch 
the juices. Otherwise, I tend to cook or bake most of the fruits I buy, 
allowing the flesh to soften into custardy sweetness, and the skin to burnish.

Whether your fruits are eaten perfectly ripe or baked, mildly flavoured dairy 
offsets their sweetness. I’m thinking milky ricotta, a soft goat’s cheese or 
even a slick of cream cheese. Spices set them off, too: cardamom, black pepper, 
fragrant long pepper (if you can get your hands on it) and, of course, the old 
favourites – cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. The butteriness of a nut seems to 
offset their honeyed flavour, too.

On these warmer evenings, I don’t have much of an appetite for drawn-out, 
heavy cooking, but I always have an appetite for puddings. These quick, 
weeknight puddings serve two, but they are very easily doubled or made for more 
with no fuss at all. The recipes will see you through the summer: the first 
Spanish and Italian peaches and French apricots are arriving now. Later in the 
season both will change, deepening in flavour and take on the colours of a 
flaming sunset.

Peaches on toast

As the peaches roast, their sticky juices soak into the toast as it crisps 
around the edges. I use soft sourdough here, but you can use leftover brioche 
or panettone instead, if you like. I keep a jar of honeycomb in the cupboard 
for quick, beautiful puddings – its perfect geometry never ceases to amaze me 
and I love its pleasing chew. You could use a little more honey if you don’t 
have honeycomb.

Serves 2 
2 just-ripe peaches, halved or quartered
A couple of sprigs of thyme, leaves picked
2 tbsp runny honey
Juice and zest of ½ lemon
2 slices of sourdough

 To serve 
A little honeycomb or more runny honey
4 tbsp ricotta or Greek yoghurt

1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Toss the peaches in the thyme 
leaves, honey, lemon juice and zest.

2 Pile the peaches on to the bread on a baking tray and bake for 20 minutes in 
the hot oven until everything caramelises. You are looking for the peaches to 
soften and the edges of the bread to brown a little. Pull them out and top with 
spoonfuls of ricotta and honeycomb.

Quick cardamom and vanilla apricots with pistachio frangipane crumbs

When it’s a good year for apricots, I eat them with enthusiasm then spend the 
rest of the year rationing out the always-too-small batch of jam I make. This 
recipe works well with apricots a little before or even after their best, 
meaning anyone with an impatient nature can eat them as soon as they get them 
home.

The frangipane crumb is a quick way of adding a little crunch and butteriness 
to the custardy, burnished fruits. If you had other nuts left over, I am sure 
they would work well here, too. This spice mixture works so well with fruit – 
vanilla, pepper and cardamom are a perfect trio of sweet warmth, mellow heat 
and heady citrus.

Serves 2
For the apricots
2 cardamom pods, bashed and seeds removed
2 black peppercorns 
1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out
4 apricots, stoned and halved
2 tbsp honey or brown sugar

 For the frangipane 
A small handful of pistachio nuts
A small handful of almonds
1 tbsp honey
A knob of good butter or coconut oil

 To serve 
A dollop of yoghurt (I use coconut yoghurt)
Rose petals (optional)

1 Preheat your grill to medium hot. Pound the cardamom seeds, peppercorns and 
vanilla seeds in a pestle and mortar then scatter over the fruit. Douse with 
honey or brown sugar and put under the grill to soften and warm.

2 To make the frangipane, blitz the nuts with the honey, being careful not to 
overdo it – you want to retain some texture.

3 Warm the butter in a small frying pan and fry small, half-teaspoon sized 
pieces of the nut and honey mixture until they are beginning to brown a little, 
then turn and cook on the other side.

4 Serve the apricots warm with the crumb on top, some yoghurt and – if you 
like things pretty – a few rose petals.
