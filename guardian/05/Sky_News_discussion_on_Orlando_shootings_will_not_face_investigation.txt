A Sky News discussion about newspaper coverage of the deadly attack on an 
Orlando nightclub 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/orlando-nightlcub-shooting-pulse-florida-attack-timeline>
 which ended with Guardian columnist Owen Jones walking off the set will not be 
investigated by media regulator Ofcom, despite more than 250 complaints.

Viewers complained that presenter Mark Longhurst and another guest, Julia 
Hartley-Brewer, had caused offence by appearing to dismiss Jones’s view that 
the attack specifically targeted the LGBT community.

A total of 253 people complained after Longhurst, conducting the Press Preview 
programme on 12 June, said the Orlando gunman targeted “human beings” in 
general.

Hartley-Brewer said the LGBT community had “no ownership of horror”. But Jones 
told the programme the shootings were “an intentional attack on LGBT people”.

A spokesman for Ofcom <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom> said: “We 
assessed a number of complaints that Mark Longhurst and Julia Hartley-Brewer 
caused offence by appearing to dismiss Owen Jones’s view that the attack on a 
nightclub in Orlando specifically targeted the LGBT community.

“However, after careful consideration, we won’t be taking the matter forward 
for investigation.

“We found that neither person responded to Owen Jones in a way that caused 
unjustified offence. Both were simply attempting to highlight the impact of 
terror attacks on society more broadly.”

Jones later wrote about the incident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/sky-news-homophobia-orlando-sexuality>
, saying it was an instinctive response to an “unpleasant and untenable 
situation”.
