The recent influx of refugees into Europe is likely to raise economic growth 
slightly in the short term – mainly in Austria,Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> and Sweden – and could deliver a 
bigger long-term economic boost to the EU if refugees are well integrated into 
the job market, according to the International Monetary Fund.

The Washington-based organisation described the surge in refugees from Syria 
and other conflict zones as a “humanitarian catastrophe” with important 
ramifications across the Middle East, Europe and beyond. The number of asylum 
seekers arriving at EU borders is unparalleled in recent times – in the first 
10 months of last year, 995,000 first-time asylum applications were submitted 
to EU countries, more than twice the number over the same period in 2014,the 
50-page report said <http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43609>
.

The fund said this is likely to result in a “modest increase in GDP growth” in 
the short term, due to higher state spending on housing and benefits for asylum 
seekers, as well as a boost to the job market from the newcomers. Austria, 
Germany andSweden <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden>, which have been 
taking in most of the refugees and have low unemployment rates, will see the 
biggest economic impact.

GDP in the EU as a whole could be lifted by 0.05%, 0.09% and 0.13% in 2015, 
2016 and 2017 respectively. The IMF estimates the largest impact in Austria, 
with GDP rising by 0.5% by 2017, followed by Sweden (0.4%) and Germany (0.3%).

In the long run, the economic impact could be larger, but will depend on the 
integration of refugees into the labour market. Assuming this is successful, by 
2020 the level of GDP could be 0.25% higher for the EU as a whole, and between 
0.5% and 1% higher in Germany, Austria and Sweden, the IMF estimates.

“Rapid labour market integration is key to reducing the net fiscal cost 
associated with the current inflow of asylum seekers. Indeed, the sooner the 
refugees gain employment, the more they will help the public finances by paying 
income tax and social security contributions,” the report said.

The authors said government spending on the refugee crisis should be taken 
into account when looking at fiscal targets, for example, Greece.

Confounding widespread fears, the IMF said most immigration studies showed 
that the effect of new arrivals on domestic workers is usually small, possibly 
because they are in different segments of the job market or because of a rise 
in investment in response to a sudden surge in workers. Enrica Detragiache, one 
of the report’s lead authors, said: “By and large the negative effects tend to 
be short-lived and temporary.”

She also said the analysis had not found a “tipping point where we say the 
inflows [of refugees] are so large that the economies cannot accommodate them 
any more.”

Germany’s open-door refugee policy

 recorded 1.1 million refugees arriving last year, by far the highest number in 
the EU. Alexander Dobrindt, itstransport minister, said this week that Germany 
must close its borders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/germany-must-soon-close-borders-to-refugees-transport-minister-tells-merkel>
 if the number of new arrivals does not drop soon.

The IMF called on EU governments to help refugees into the job market by 
easing restrictions on taking up work during the asylum application. Other 
suggestions include wage subsidies to private employers and temporary 
exceptions to minimum or entry-level wages, as well as startup funds for 
immigrant entrepreneurs.

Reducing restrictions on refugees’ mobility would allow them to move to where 
there is a high demand for workers, the IMF said. It raised the possibility 
that the most recent wave of asylum seekers are better educated than those in 
the past, with 21% of Syrians who arrived in Germany in 2013-14 having 
post-secondary education, close to the German average (23%).

When asked about whether the recent arrivals will be able to fill skill gaps 
in Germany, Detragiache cautioned: “It would be naive to think that the 
refugees at the moment have those particular skills. The challenge is to 
provide the type of training that is required and that will take some time.”

The IMF noted that the Swedish introduction programme, which includes language 
training, employment preparation and basic knowledge of Swedish society, has 
helped refugees achieve high rates of employment, although it is a lengthy 
process.

Germany has a higher share of foreign-born population than the UK or the US 
after previous immigration waves in the 1960s and 1990s, the report noted. 
While the gap narrows over time, in the long run the unemployment rate remains 
3 percentage points higher among immigrants.
