The Americans

There’s slightly less espionage action 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/19/the-americans-best-spy-show-tv-kgb>
 in the fourth season of the impeccable spy drama, as KGB sleeper agents Philip 
(Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) take time off to collect 
themselves. Not that it stops them doing a heist to break biological weapons 
out of a lab.

What we said: What makes The Americans one of the standout shows in the 
“golden age of television” is that it isn’t about spies at all. Just as The 
Sopranos isn’t really about the mafia, Mad Men isn’t really about advertising, 
and Six Feet Under isn’t really about funerals,The Americans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-americans> goes way beyond 
whether or not Philip and Elizabeth will continue to get away with their 
duplicitous life.

Better Call Saul

The Breaking Bad spin-off about Jimmy McGill slowly becoming Saul Goodman is 
hilarious but alsotouching and utterly human 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/19/better-call-saul-its-not-breaking-bad-but-it-might-be-even-better>
. It’s also less male than BB, especially in the second series when Kim Wexler 
(Rhea Seehorn) comes into her own.

What we said: The longer it takes Jimmy to get to Saul and beyond, the better.

Damian Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/11/damian-lewis-hedge-fund-billionaires-are-misunderstood>
 and Paul Giamatti go head-to-head in a disconcerting drama that manages to 
make hedge funds sexy (thanks in no small part to a smattering of S&M kink). 
Lewis plays Bobby “Axe” Axelrod, a charming, slippery billionaire trader who 
the endlessly het-up US attorney Chuck Rhoades (Giamatti) is convinced is doing 
insider trading. Compelling viewing that’ll leave you feeling icky and 
complicit.

What we said: Hell it’s fun, even if I feel ever so slightly naughty – guilty 
even – for enjoying it so much.

Julia Davis’s excruciating campsite comedy about relationships and middle age

Deutschland 83

The 80s-set German-American spy drama that makes the cold war feel more fun 
than frosty.

What we said: It’s a fast-paced tale of espionage set in Germany in 1983, a 
time when the cold war was getting notably hotter, as the United States and the 
Soviet Union squared off and the threat of imminent nuclear meltdown became 
increasingly possible. D83 makes that terror clear from the start.

Employable Me

Poignant documentary series in the same vein as The Undateables, but with a 
whole lot more heart. It follows six people with neurological conditions from 
Tourette’s to Asperger’s as they try to get jobs as lawyers, tree surgeons, 
teachers and auctioneers – in many cases their first ever.

What we said: If it helps to highlight, and destigmatise, and encourage a 
wiser, more enlightened approach to recruitment, that’s got to be good. Plus, 
it’s warm, human, moving telly.

What we said: It grew in confidence and stature, from a promising but shaky 
start, into something excellent ... but knowing when to knock something on the

Photograph: CBS Paramount 
Alicia Florrick bows out after seven sharp, topical, superb, law-fuelled 
seasons. But with her husband Peter facing indictment, will she end up back 
where she started out – standing ill-advisedly by her man?

What we said: There is an urgency to the storytelling that is more nail-biting 
than any action show like The Walking Dead. Its use of cliffhangers is also 
unparalleled, concluding episodes in unexpected places right before viewers get 
all the answers they want. It would be mind-blowingly frustrating if it weren’t 
so brilliant.

things get messy and unravel until even the title becomes knowingly, ironically 
hipster.

What we said: It’s smart and hilarious. But God, it’s annoying, too, because 
of all the to-ing and fro-ing, the will-they, won’t-they (C’mon, just do it!). 
I’ll watch one more, though. And, go on then, one more after that. I did five 
in the end. And I’ll probably binge the next five, too.

 Bona fide international stars … Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine and Hugh

John Le Carré spy drama with £20m thrown at it by the BBC. Tom Hiddleston 
gives his best Bond audition as Jonathan Pine, the hotelier-cum-double agent 
trying to infiltrate and implode the operation of the smooth-talking global 
arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie), AKA the “worst man in the world”.

What we said: The Night Manager is as sexed up as television drama comes. In 
Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie it has bona fide international stars; in John Le 
Carre’s source novel it has a pedigree of untouchable grandeur. It always seems 
to be spy thrillers that get the fat end of the licence fee payer’s wodge …The 
Night Manager <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-night-manager> 
channels all that money into a smoothly accomplished atmosphere of alienation 
and dread.

 More swagger than really seems fair … Peaky Blinders. Photograph: BBC 
The third series of BBC2’s garish period gangster drama served up a heady stew 
of Russians, robbery, religion and rampage with more swagger than really seems 
fair.

What we said: This is a drama at that imperious stage where it’s hard to go 
wrong – confident in its storytelling, secure in its character development and 
trusting the audience to join them on another tumultuous journey through the 
back streets of Small Heath, Birmingham and the equally dangerous corridors of 
power.

 Exquisitely acted … Cuba Gooding Jr as OJ Simpson with Courtney B Vance as

It was the trial of the century, and we all knew how it ended. But somehow, 
Ryan Murphy’s American Crime Story still managed to keep us glued to our 
screens the second time around.

What we said: The drama – exquisitely acted with marquee names such as John 
Travolta,Cuba Gooding Jr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/26/cuba-gooding-jr-on-oj-simpson-it-could-have-been-me-in-that-bronco>

ravine and imagining how the hell anybody in their right mind thinks they are 
going to get it back up the hill, in the full glare of the media.

Silicon Valley

Excellent and agonisingly underwatched tech satire. In the third season, 
Richard Hendricks and his developer gang finally get their compression platform 
Pied Piper off the ground. Cue photoshoots in unicorn outfits, CEO battles and 
a ridiculous million-dollar Hawaiian-themed party on Alcatraz.

What we said: Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley has been embraced by those it so 
brilliantly skewers. Executive producer Alec Berg says: “Mark Zuckerberg 
apparently wears a Pied Piper shirt to work and Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the 
Google guys, did their ice-bucket challenge wearing shirts from our show …”

 Seductive, involving, gripping … Andri in Trapped. Photograph: BBC/RVK Studios 
A headless torso gets caught in a trawler’s net in Seyðisfjörður, a tiny 
Icelandic port town, and the troubled and loveable local copsAndri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/24/trapped-bbc-olafur-darri-olafsson-interview>
 and Henrika face their biggest investigation ever. Then a blizzard sets in and 
cuts off the whole town. Fantastically claustrophobic Nordic noir, the first 
Icelandic drama ever picked up by the BBC.

What we said: Trapped certainly shares DNA with its Scandi cousins, but this 
is not merely a copy. The cut-off thing adds a new intensity – it’s properly 
claustrophobic. And the beauty is different – it’s more about nature: grand, 
scooped-out glacial valleys, icy fjords, a volcanic land that is alive and 
dangerous. Nordic maybe but this is also most definitely, and proudly, 
Icelandic ... seductive, involving, gripping: I am already, thoroughly, trapped.

 Unstoppably peppy … Ellie Kemper as Kimmy Schmidt with her roommate Titus 
Andromedon, played by Tituss Burgess. Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock 
In the second season of Tina Fey and Robert Carlock’s sitcom about an 
unstoppably peppy cult survivor, Kimmy is still naive, funny and 
Frasier-obsessed – only now she’s channelling her cheeriness into her new job 
as a Christmas elf.


What we said: The humour still comes fast and furious and Kimmy is as 
wonderfully misinformed as ever. (She thinks Milf stands for My Interesting 
Lady Friends.)

 Give Andrew Davies a peerage … War and Peace. Photograph: BBC 
Andrew Davies took on Tolstoy’s blockbuster with a stellar cast, plenty of 
spectacle and a scene-stealing turn from Tom Burke as the caddish Dolokhov.

What we said: The government should give Davies a peerage like the one it 
awarded Julian Fellowes for his genius in keeping Britain supine during 
austerity years.
