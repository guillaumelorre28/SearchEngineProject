Andy Murray’s second Wimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> 
triumph was watched by more than 13 million viewers on BBC1, but not quite as 
many as saw Portugal beat France in the final of Euro 2016.


Murray’s straight-sets win over Milos Raonic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/10/andy-murray-wins-wimbledon-2016-milos-raonic>
 drew an average of 9.2 million viewers (55%) from 1.50pm on BBC1 on Sunday, 
with a five-minute peak of 13.3 million.

It was 300,000 fewer than the 13.6 million peak who saw Portugal beat France 
in the final of Euro 2016 on BBC1.

The final, in which substitute Éder won the championship for Portugal after 
Christiano Ronaldo went off injured in the first half

, averaged 10.2 million viewers (46%) across four hours of coverage on BBC1 
from 7pm.

It delivered a 5-1 win for the BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> 
over ITV, which drew 1.9 million viewers (8.9%) for its coverage of the final.

BBC1 traditionally wins the ratings battles when the two channels go head to 
head and this year was no exception.

ITV suffers because it has to carry advertising but viewers also said they 
preferred BBC1’s coverage, fronted by Gary Lineker.
