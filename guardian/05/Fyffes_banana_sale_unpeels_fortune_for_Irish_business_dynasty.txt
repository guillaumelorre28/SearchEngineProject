The world’s oldest banana brand Fyffes is to be sold to Japanese giant 
Sumitomo for €751m (£630m), resulting in a big payout for the McCann family, 
one of Ireland’s most prominent business dynasties.

The McCann family, whose links with Dublin-based Fyffes date back to 1902, has 
agreed to sell its 11.79% stake in the Irish fruit supplier, worth nearly 
€87.5m. The South-Carolina based Zucker family is in line for a similar payout 
for its 11.83% stake.


The two families and other shareholders will receive €2.23 per share in cash

 as well as a final dividend of two cents a share. The Irish company has 
recommended the deal to investors and 27% have already backed it.

David McCann, executive chairman of Fyffes, said the offer was compelling. 
“Our employees, customers, suppliers and joint venture partners will benefit 
from Fyffes being part of an enlarged group with greater scale, reach and 
resources to broaden and accelerate delivery of Fyffes’ strategic objectives.”

The takeover comes two years after Fyffes and US rival Chiquita abandoned 
plans for a merger

 that would have created the world’s largest banana company. Since then, Fyffes 
has been on an acquisition trail and recently added mushroom businesses to its 
portfolio of bananas, melons and pineapples.

McCann told the Irish Times 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/business/agribusiness-and-food/how-very-enjoyable-meal-in-dublin-led-to-751m-deal-for-fyffes-1.2899391>
 that the deal was discussed at a dinner with Sumitomo executives at the 
Merrion hotel in Dublin two months ago.


“When discussions like this begin, you can never predict how they’re going to 
finish,” he said, “but this is a good transaction for our shareholders and for 
our people, as we expect the business as a whole to remain intact.” He said he 
would “stay for a period”.


The business has come a long way since 1902 when McCann’s grandfather Charles 
set up a fruit and veg shop in Dundalk and became the first agent inIreland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> for Fyffes, a then-London-based 
banana importer. Fyffes began in 1888 when Edward Fyffe, a tea importer, went 
into partnership with a fruit distributor, James Hudson, and started shipping 
bananas from the Canary Islands to London.

The McCanns built up their business and it became known as Fruit Importers of 
Ireland, which floated on the Irish stock exchange in 1981 and bought Fyffes 
five years later.

Hirohiko Imura, managing executive officer of Sumitomo, said: “We are grateful 
that the McCann family has provided an irrevocable commitment of support and is 
entrusting us to continue with them the rich Fyffes heritage. Sumitomo will 
provide Fyffes with experience, support and investment to continue to build on 
the tremendous Fyffes skills and experience and reach greater potential.”
