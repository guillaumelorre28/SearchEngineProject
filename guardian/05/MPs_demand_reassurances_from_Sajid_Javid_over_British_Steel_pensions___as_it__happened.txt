Closing summary: Steel crisis rumbles on

Time to wrap up. A quick recap:

MPs have urged Sajid Javid to treat cautiously, after the business secretary 
confirmed that the government is considering cutting the pension entitlements 
of British Steel workers. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746ed62e4b00a2e2e3a0b11#block-5746ed62e4b00a2e2e3a0b11>

During an urgent statement in parliament, MPs from across the House warned of 
the risk that other organisations try to follow suit, potentially hitting 
millions of workers in the pocket.

During the session, Javid explained that the scheme’s Trustees had proposed 
shifting the scheme to a lower inflation rate [from RPI to CPI], to cover its 
£700m deficit.

He also promised not to be hasty, despite giving just four weeks to consult on 
the proposal.

Jo Stevens, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, said it was a “potentially very 
risky and precedent-setting proposal”.

Neil Gray, the SNP’s employment spokesman, said the “incredibly sensitive” 
pensions issue must be “handled with extreme care” by the Government. 
Otherwise, he fears it could create:

 “a very dangerous precedent that undermines workplace pensions and incentives 
to save to secure dignity in retirement”.

And Frank Field, who chairs parliament’s pensions committee, warned that 
“thousands of other schemes” are in a similar predicament.


Javid had just returned from meeting with Indian conglomerate Tata. He told 
MPs that there are seven credible bidders interested in buying Tata’s assets.

But he refused to comment on rumours that Tata is now considering keeping its 
plants

, if the proposal for pension cuts is accepted.

Unions representing Britain’s workers have welcomed the government’s decision 
to launch a consultation today.

 They said it would be an “unmitigated disaster” if the scheme had to be 
rescued by the Pensions Protection Fund.

One expert has predicted that the proposed change to inflation indexing would 
save the scheme £2.5bn, and steadily eat into a pensioners’ income

Here's what the Steel pension changes would mean in practice
 Steel workers marching through London yesterday. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA 
Shifting the British Steel pension scheme from the Retail Prices Index to the 
Consumer Prices index, as the Trustees have proposed, would wipe £2.5bn of its 
liabilities.

So says Clive Fortes, Partner at Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy firm.

Fortes explains:

“In 2011 the Government changed statutory pension increases from RPI to CPI. 
If CPI is used, pension entitlements increase by around 1% less per annum than 
under CPI. Over a 15-20 year period, that’s a 15-20% reduction on the size of 
an individual’s pension.

“Whether or not a scheme has the flexibility to adopt CPI comes down to how 
the lawyer wrote scheme rules before 2011. Some schemes, such as British 
Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, 
clearly don’t. There’s a ‘scheme rules lottery’ in respect of RPI and CPI.

And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer:

“For a British Steel pensioner with a £5,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI 
will see them £50 worse in year one, £100 in year two and so in. Over a typical 
pensioners’ lifetime this is a loss of £15,000 of lifetime savings. On the plus 
side, this only one third of the average loss on falling in to the Pension 
Protection Fund.

FT: Brussels might not approve of Steel pension changes

The government’s proposed changes to the British Steel pension scheme could 
prompt a row with the European Union, according to the Financial Times. 
<https://next.ft.com/content/65871036-2349-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c>

It says:

If the government legislates to amend the rules governing one pension fund — 
for a struggling industry — it could raise alarm bells in Brussels: it is 
likely to be seen as state aid by EU officials.

This won’t be a problem, though, if Britain votes to leave the EU next month 
(on the day the consultation closes).

The FT also flags up the winners and losers from the plan:

In the 40-page consultation document it emerged that not all members of the 
scheme would be better off under the proposals. Some 5,800 would be worse off, 
70,000 would be in the same situation and 40,000 would be in a better situation.

(that’s compared to entering the Payment Protection Fund, which would also 
prompt a cut to benefits)

Parliament’s Business, Innovation and Skills committee has just moved a step 
closer to getting Mike Ashley, boss of Sports Direct, to testify before them.

The committee has written to Askley, declining his invitation to visit his 
Shirebrook warehouse. Instead, they expected to see the retail titan in their 
committee room on June 7 to face questions about working conditions at Sports 
Direct.

Committee chairman Iain Wright also warns Ashley that they may also hear some 
critical comments about working practices (something the Guardian exposed last 
year

Steel unions welcome government consultation

Britain’s steel union have welcomed the government’s decision to open a 
consultation on making changes to the British Steel pension scheme.

They confirm that the deficit - now £700m, it appears – is a serious hurdle to 
finding a buyer for Tata’s operations in the UK.

Crucially, they warn that it would be a disaster if the scheme fell into the 
Pension Protection Scheme – the lifeboat for failed pension scheme.

Here’s the full statement:

The steel trade unions – Community, Unite and GMB – have been in dialogue with 
the UK Government and Tata Steel for a number of weeks to secure a sustainable 
future for our industry. A number of bidders have made it clear that the 
British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We 
also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both 
current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK.

There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata’s assets would 
involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions 
believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a 
financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an 
unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such 
that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided.

We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the 
BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. 
It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options 
that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst 
deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK 
Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our 
members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this 
unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions 
responsibilities.

It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor 
of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities 
with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have 
worked and continue to work within it.

As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our 
members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great 
uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK’s 
entire industrial base. The steel industry’s highly skilled and dedicated 
workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable 
future for the industry will be built.

The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason.

The prospect of workers’ pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to 
reconsider selling its UK assets at all!

That’s according to The Times, which reported today that: 

The sale of Tata Steel’s UK assets has been thrown into confusion after 
speculation that the business secretary has offered Tata a deal so attractive 
that it may yet keep Port Talbot and a dozen other facilities around the 
country.

One of those sweeteners is said to include an accommodation to downgrade the 
retirement benefits of members in the British Steel Pensions Scheme to try to 
keep a lid on the £15 billion fund’s £485 million deficit.

But some ministers are apparently fighting the proposal, fearing that it would 
open a “Pandora’s Box” and prompt other companies to cut entitlements too.

My colleague Graham Ruddick sums up the key exchange from the steel session (
which starts back at noon BST 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d#block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d>

Sajid Javid <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid>, the business 
secretary, said the trustees had asked the government to make the scheme exempt 
from legislation in the 1995 Pensions Act.

“The scheme’s trustees have come forward and asked us to look at current 
legislation,” Javid told MPs. “The scheme trustees have put forward this 
proposal and it is only right that we consider it.”

However, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said the plans “risk 
setting a very worrying precedent” and questioned whether the government can 
ensure that any changes to pension laws are “safely ring-fenced”.

Here’s our latest story on the issue:

Sajid Javid's steel statement: snap verdict

In Yes Minister, Jim Hacker defined a dangerous precedent thus:

“If we do the right thing this time, we might have to do the right thing again 
next time.”

But several MPs who spoke in parliament this lunchtime 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d#block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d>
 are worried that the government’s plans for British Steel could create the 
wrong sort of precedent, and hurt millions of workers in the pocket.

And I think they’re right to be concerned. As Sajid Javid pointed out, the 
suggestion to switch inflation linking from RPI to the (lower) CPI ratecame 
from the British Steel trustees themselves 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746db5ee4b04536c2a44255#block-5746db5ee4b04536c2a44255>
.

Other trustees wrestling with similar pension deficits are likely to be 
pondering whether a similar shift could work for them.

Javid pointed out that the only thing preventing the British Steel trustees is 
current legislation (pesky laws, eh?). And we must assume that this legislation 
could be changed,if the consultation backs the plan.

I say if, but the Trustees have already concluded that the change would mean 
workers are either better off, or no worse off, than other options.
 Photograph: BBC Parliament 
Labour’s Angela Eagle didn’t let Javid off lightly, though  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746da53e4b04536c2a4424e#block-5746da53e4b04536c2a4424e>
– reminding the House of the minister’s failure to fly to Mumbai in March, when 
Tata decided to pull out of the UK.


Eagle also put her finger on a serious concern -- the government’s 
consultation closes in four weeks time.Is that really enough time to consider 
such a serious issue? And how much time will be spent deliberating? Tata are 
clearly determined to get a sale quickly, so there’s a lot of pressure on the 
government.

On a brighter note, Javid had just returned to the UK from Mumbai, where he 
met with Tata’s top brass. He still seems optimistic that a deal will be found, 
with seven credible bidders showing serious interest.

But still..... the precedent of changing pensions rules to that workers get 
less than they were promised has clearly worried MPs on both sides of the house.

Several members pushed Javid to confirm that any changes would just be 
ringfenced to British Steel, not used as a template for other companies.

The business secretary did indeed give that assurance, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746ddc0e4b038ba175e45cd#block-5746ddc0e4b038ba175e45cd>
 but some MPs looked pretty concerned. Not just Labour -- Conservative Julian 
Knight pointed out that there is a fundamental principle here. Pensioners are 
entitled to receive what they were promised when they paid into a scheme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746e264e4b04536c2a4428d#block-5746e264e4b04536c2a4428d>
.

Javid also appeared to indicate that steel workers wouldn’t get a ballot on 
the changes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746e59ce4b038ba175e4611#block-5746e59ce4b038ba175e4611>

And finally, Labour MP Madeleine Moon of Bridgend says that other companies 
are already poaching skilled steel workers.

Q: Shouldn’t the government give an assurance that public sector contracts 
will always demand a high percentage of British steel, to underpin confidence?

Javid says that the government has already allowed economic and social factors 
to be taken into account.

And he repeats that the government’s promise of financial help has also 
provided confidence.

And that is the end of the session

Geriant Davies, Labour Co-operative MP for Swansea West, tells the house that 
he warned the government that minimum carbon pricing would hurt the steel

Javid agrees that energy costs are important, but not the only factor facing

close  
Time to wrap up. A quick recap:

MPs have urged Sajid Javid to treat cautiously, after the business secretary 
confirmed that the government is considering cutting the pension entitlements 
of British Steel workers. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746ed62e4b00a2e2e3a0b11#block-5746ed62e4b00a2e2e3a0b11>

During an urgent statement in parliament, MPs from across the House warned of 
the risk that other organisations try to follow suit, potentially hitting 
millions of workers in the pocket.

During the session, Javid explained that the scheme’s Trustees had proposed 
shifting the scheme to a lower inflation rate [from RPI to CPI], to cover its 
£700m deficit.

He also promised not to be hasty, despite giving just four weeks to consult on 
the proposal.

Jo Stevens, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, said it was a “potentially very 
risky and precedent-setting proposal”.

Neil Gray, the SNP’s employment spokesman, said the “incredibly sensitive” 
pensions issue must be “handled with extreme care” by the Government. 
Otherwise, he fears it could create:

 “a very dangerous precedent that undermines workplace pensions and incentives 
to save to secure dignity in retirement”.

And Frank Field, who chairs parliament’s pensions committee, warned that 
“thousands of other schemes” are in a similar predicament.


Javid had just returned from meeting with Indian conglomerate Tata. He told 
MPs that there are seven credible bidders interested in buying Tata’s assets.

But he refused to comment on rumours that Tata is now considering keeping its 
plants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-57470033e4b006af16bc0aa1#block-57470033e4b006af16bc0aa1>
, if the proposal for pension cuts is accepted.

Unions representing Britain’s workers have welcomed the government’s decision 
to launch a consultation today. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-574702cbe4b006af16bc0aaa#block-574702cbe4b006af16bc0aaa>
 They said it would be an “unmitigated disaster” if the scheme had to be 
rescued by the Pensions Protection Fund.

One expert has predicted that the proposed change to inflation indexing would 
save the scheme £2.5bn, and steadily eat into a pensioners’ income

Shifting the British Steel pension scheme from the Retail Prices Index to the 
Consumer Prices index, as the Trustees have proposed, would wipe £2.5bn of its 
liabilities.

So says Clive Fortes, Partner at Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy firm.

Fortes explains:

“In 2011 the Government changed statutory pension increases from RPI to CPI. 
If CPI is used, pension entitlements increase by around 1% less per annum than 
under CPI. Over a 15-20 year period, that’s a 15-20% reduction on the size of 
an individual’s pension.

“Whether or not a scheme has the flexibility to adopt CPI comes down to how 
the lawyer wrote scheme rules before 2011. Some schemes, such as British 
Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, 
clearly don’t. There’s a ‘scheme rules lottery’ in respect of RPI and CPI.

And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer:

“For a British Steel pensioner with a £5,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI 
will see them £50 worse in year one, £100 in year two and so in. Over a typical 
pensioners’ lifetime this is a loss of £15,000 of lifetime savings. On the plus 
side, this only one third of the average loss on falling in to the Pension 
Protection Fund.
 
The government’s proposed changes to the British Steel pension scheme could 
prompt a row with the European Union, according to the Financial Times. 
<https://next.ft.com/content/65871036-2349-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c>

It says:

If the government legislates to amend the rules governing one pension fund — 
for a struggling industry — it could raise alarm bells in Brussels: it is 
likely to be seen as state aid by EU officials.

This won’t be a problem, though, if Britain votes to leave the EU next month 
(on the day the consultation closes).

The FT also flags up the winners and losers from the plan:

In the 40-page consultation document it emerged that not all members of the 
scheme would be better off under the proposals. Some 5,800 would be worse off, 
70,000 would be in the same situation and 40,000 would be in a better situation.

(that’s compared to entering the Payment Protection Fund, which would also 
prompt a cut to benefits)
 
Parliament’s Business, Innovation and Skills committee has just moved a step 
closer to getting Mike Ashley, boss of Sports Direct, to testify before them.

The committee has written to Askley, declining his invitation to visit his 
Shirebrook warehouse. Instead, they expected to see the retail titan in their 
committee room on June 7 to face questions about working conditions at Sports 
Direct.

Committee chairman Iain Wright also warns Ashley that they may also hear some 
critical comments about working practices (something the Guardian exposed last 
year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay>
).

Here’s the full letter:

 Photograph: Iain Wright MP  
Britain’s steel union have welcomed the government’s decision to open a 
consultation on making changes to the British Steel pension scheme.

They confirm that the deficit - now £700m, it appears – is a serious hurdle to 
finding a buyer for Tata’s operations in the UK.

Crucially, they warn that it would be a disaster if the scheme fell into the 
Pension Protection Scheme – the lifeboat for failed pension scheme.

Here’s the full statement:

The steel trade unions – Community, Unite and GMB – have been in dialogue with 
the UK Government and Tata Steel for a number of weeks to secure a sustainable 
future for our industry. A number of bidders have made it clear that the 
British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We 
also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both 
current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK.

There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata’s assets would 
involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions 
believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a 
financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an 
unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such 
that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided.

We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the 
BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. 
It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options 
that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst 
deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK 
Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our 
members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this 
unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions 
responsibilities.

It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor 
of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities 
with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have 
worked and continue to work within it.

As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our 
members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great 
uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK’s 
entire industrial base. The steel industry’s highly skilled and dedicated 
workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable 
future for the industry will be built.

The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason.

The prospect of workers’ pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to 
reconsider selling its UK assets at all!

That’s according to The Times, which reported today that: 

The sale of Tata Steel’s UK assets has been thrown into confusion after 
speculation that the business secretary has offered Tata a deal so attractive 
that it may yet keep Port Talbot and a dozen other facilities around the 
country.

One of those sweeteners is said to include an accommodation to downgrade the 
retirement benefits of members in the British Steel Pensions Scheme to try to 
keep a lid on the £15 billion fund’s £485 million deficit.

But some ministers are apparently fighting the proposal, fearing that it would 
open a “Pandora’s Box” and prompt other companies to cut entitlements too.

My colleague Graham Ruddick sums up the key exchange from the steel session (
which starts back at noon BST 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d#block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d>
)

Sajid Javid <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid>, the business 
secretary, said the trustees had asked the government to make the scheme exempt 
from legislation in the 1995 Pensions Act.

“The scheme’s trustees have come forward and asked us to look at current 
legislation,” Javid told MPs. “The scheme trustees have put forward this 
proposal and it is only right that we consider it.”

However, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said the plans “risk 
setting a very worrying precedent” and questioned whether the government can 
ensure that any changes to pension laws are “safely ring-fenced”.

Here’s our latest story on the issue:

Tata Steel pension chief backs controversial cuts
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/tata-steel-pension-chief-backs-controversial-cuts> 
In Yes Minister, Jim Hacker defined a dangerous precedent thus:

“If we do the right thing this time, we might have to do the right thing again 
next time.”

But several MPs who spoke in parliament this lunchtime 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d#block-5746d61ae4b00a2e2e3a0a5d>
 are worried that the government’s plans for British Steel could create the 
wrong sort of precedent, and hurt millions of workers in the pocket.

And I think they’re right to be concerned. As Sajid Javid pointed out, the 
suggestion to switch inflation linking from RPI to the (lower) CPI ratecame 
from the British Steel trustees themselves 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746db5ee4b04536c2a44255#block-5746db5ee4b04536c2a44255>
.

Other trustees wrestling with similar pension deficits are likely to be 
pondering whether a similar shift could work for them.

Javid pointed out that the only thing preventing the British Steel trustees is 
current legislation (pesky laws, eh?). And we must assume that this legislation 
could be changed,if the consultation backs the plan.

I say if, but the Trustees have already concluded that the change would mean 
workers are either better off, or no worse off, than other options.
 Photograph: BBC Parliament 
Labour’s Angela Eagle didn’t let Javid off lightly, though  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746da53e4b04536c2a4424e#block-5746da53e4b04536c2a4424e>
– reminding the House of the minister’s failure to fly to Mumbai in March, when 
Tata decided to pull out of the UK.


Eagle also put her finger on a serious concern -- the government’s 
consultation closes in four weeks time.Is that really enough time to consider 
such a serious issue? And how much time will be spent deliberating? Tata are 
clearly determined to get a sale quickly, so there’s a lot of pressure on the 
government.

On a brighter note, Javid had just returned to the UK from Mumbai, where he 
met with Tata’s top brass. He still seems optimistic that a deal will be found, 
with seven credible bidders showing serious interest.

But still..... the precedent of changing pensions rules to that workers get 
less than they were promised has clearly worried MPs on both sides of the house.

Several members pushed Javid to confirm that any changes would just be 
ringfenced to British Steel, not used as a template for other companies.

The business secretary did indeed give that assurance, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746ddc0e4b038ba175e45cd#block-5746ddc0e4b038ba175e45cd>
 but some MPs looked pretty concerned. Not just Labour -- Conservative Julian 
Knight pointed out that there is a fundamental principle here. Pensioners are 
entitled to receive what they were promised when they paid into a scheme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746e264e4b04536c2a4428d#block-5746e264e4b04536c2a4428d>
.

Javid also appeared to indicate that steel workers wouldn’t get a ballot on 
the changes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/26/oil-50-per-barrel-uk-economy-eu-g7-greece-live?page=with:block-5746e59ce4b038ba175e4611#block-5746e59ce4b038ba175e4611>
.
 
And finally, Labour MP Madeleine Moon of Bridgend says that other companies 
are already poaching skilled steel workers.

Q: Shouldn’t the government give an assurance that public sector contracts 
will always demand a high percentage of British steel, to underpin confidence?

Javid says that the government has already allowed economic and social factors 
to be taken into account.

And he repeats that the government’s promise of financial help has also 
provided confidence.

And that is the end of the session
 
Geriant Davies, Labour Co-operative MP for Swansea West, tells the house that 
he warned the government that minimum carbon pricing would hurt the steel 
industry.

Javid agrees that energy costs are important, but not the only factor facing 
steel plants.
