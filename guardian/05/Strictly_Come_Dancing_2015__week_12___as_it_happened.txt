So that’s it for the semi-final - all that remains is for us to reconvene here 
at 6.35pm next Saturday for the Grand Final, where we’ll crack through two 
shows in one night and have a final marathon liveblog party. There’ll also be a 
bumper Strictly Come Bingo, so prepare for some self-mulling.

In the meantime, what’s your prediction for this year’s glitterball champion? 
For me it’s a toss-up between Jay and Aliona and Georgia and Giovanni, but I 
think Jay still has more to give and might edge the win. If you swing by 
@heidistephens on Twitter we’ll do a highly unscientific survey, or pop your 
thoughts in the comment box below – who will be getting your vote next week? 
Thank you all for joining in and being brilliant as ever this weekend, have a 
lovely weekend and I’ll see you next Saturday! Hx

Anita and Gleb dance their final dance to End Of The Road by Boyz II Men. I 
hate myself for knowing this.

So Anita and Gleb are out of Strictly, and say lots of lovely things about 
each other. Some very odd decisions from the judges this weekend, and a lack of 
consistency throughout the series, I think.


But there you go, the deed is done and we have our four grand finalists - 
Kellie and Kevin, Jay and Aliona, Georgia and Giovanni and Katie and Anton!

So who will the judges choose? Craig chooses Anita and Gleb, but Darcey choose 
Katie and Anton (PERIL). Bruno saves Katie and Anton too…so what will Len do?


Len decides to judge on this one dance, and saves Katie and Anton. To be fair 
to Len, it’s what he would have done with the Jamelia/Peter debacle too, but I 
can’t help feeling that Anita was a victim of Gleb’s choreography this week, 
which isn’t really her fault.


I’m also gutted that we won’t get to see two minutes of back-to-back Gleb 
Specials in their showdance next week. Can you imagine? Alas we’ll never know.

Meanwhile Anita and Gleb’s Salsa is not great - some timing issues and very 
loose footwork in and out of several of the 97 lifts. Eeeek.

Well this is definitely a more confident and assured Waltz from Katie, 
although you could still drive a bus between them in places. But footwork and 
balance is much better.

I’m a bit worried about Anita and Gleb in this dance-off. If it comes down to 
Len with the deciding vote, he might well pick Katie and Anton, the Salsa 
really wasn’t his cup of tea (or a Salsa, for that matter).

Time for another montage, but this is just a taster of how many we’ll get next 
week. I might include it in Strictly Come Bingo.

So who else is joining Anita and Gleb in the dance-off? Georgia and Giovanni 
are safely through to the final (quite right too), which means KATIE AND ANTON 
are in the dance-off!


I think Anton’s semi might be coming to an end.

Tonight’s musical interlude comes courtesy of the nation’s favourite 80s 
aussie soap actress-turned pop pixie, Kylie Minogue. She’s singing “I’m going 
to be warm this winter”, presumably because she’s claimed her Winter Fuel 
Allowance. Personally I’d have put some warmer trousers on, you’ll catch your 
death in those hotpants.

Look, I love Christmas as much as anyone, but this is dreadful.

So who is the first couple in the dance-off, and who is safely through to the 
GRAND FINAL? Jay and Aliona are though (excellent), along with Kellie and Kevin 
(hits mute button).

First couple in the dance-off: ANITA AND GLEB! Well, we expected that.

Last night on Strictly – a couple of lovely Viennese Waltzes, a mixed bag of 
Charlestons, a cheeky Cha Cha, a gappy Waltz, a raunch-free Rumba and a classy 
American Smooth. Anita and Gleb managed a Foxtrot that was actually an American 
Smooth, and a Salsa that was an aerobics routine sponsored by 
hideousoutfits.com. If that’s Gleb’s idea of a Salsa, I can’t WAIT to see his 
showdance next week.

And we’re off! I love watching the opening titles at this stage of the 
competition, Daniel O’Donnell, Anthony Ogogo and Kirsty Gallagher all feel like 
such a distant memory.


Tonigh’s pro dance opens with Tristan and a clipboard. They’re all in a 
terrible nightclub, busting latin moves to J-Lo’s On The Floor, which also 
features Pitbull. Are they on some kind of 2-for-1 deal on Pitbull tracks this 
week?

Casual Countryfile Weatherperson Update (the last of this Strictly season – 
wah!): a sensibly-attired Matt Taylor dressed like an estate agent. I’m already 
nostalgic for the days of jeans and check shirts, made the crappy weather seem 
better, somehow.

Every week I feel like this show is judging me for not buying a Countryfile 
calendar. What if I give a few quid to Children in Need and hang my Gleb 
Savchenko one instead? There’s no happy hedgehog, but plenty of shirt-free 
Gleb. What’s not to love?

What’s occurring on Countryfile? Currently there is an In-depth discussion 
around the growing wild boar population, and Matt Baker (in a horrible blue 
beanie hat) doing chemistry experiments on limestone. I’m not sure I can bear 
the excitement.

SUNDAY NIGHT RESULTS SHOW UPDATE!

Evening all, and welcome back for tonight’s Strictly Results Show! Last 
night’s double-dancing semi was an up and down affair from start to finish - 
there was definitely a whiff of ‘not enough rehearsal time’, and bonkers 
scoring all round from the judges. By rights It should be Katie and Anton going 
home this evening, but we’re at the stage in the competition where anything 
could happen, and usually does.


I’ll be here from 7.20pm to record all the action for future generations to 
ponder, so join me here then. It’s our very last Sunday show of the season, so 
let’s make it a good one. See you in a bit!

So that’s it for the semi-final - all that remains is for us to reconvene here 
at 6.35pm next Saturday for the Grand Final, where we’ll crack through two 
shows in one night and have a final marathon liveblog party. There’ll also be a 
bumper Strictly Come Bingo, so prepare for some self-mulling.

In the meantime, what’s your prediction for this year’s glitterball champion? 
For me it’s a toss-up between Jay and Aliona and Georgia and Giovanni, but I 
think Jay still has more to give and might edge the win. If you swing by 
@heidistephens on Twitter we’ll do a highly unscientific survey, or pop your 
thoughts in the comment box below – who will be getting your vote next week? 
Thank you all for joining in and being brilliant as ever this weekend, have a 
lovely weekend and I’ll see you next Saturday! Hx

 
Anita and Gleb dance their final dance to End Of The Road by Boyz II Men. I 
hate myself for knowing this.
 
So Anita and Gleb are out of Strictly, and say lots of lovely things about 
each other. Some very odd decisions from the judges this weekend, and a lack of 
consistency throughout the series, I think.


But there you go, the deed is done and we have our four grand finalists - 
Kellie and Kevin, Jay and Aliona, Georgia and Giovanni and Katie and Anton!
 
So who will the judges choose? Craig chooses Anita and Gleb, but Darcey choose 
Katie and Anton (PERIL). Bruno saves Katie and Anton too…so what will Len do?


Len decides to judge on this one dance, and saves Katie and Anton. To be fair 
to Len, it’s what he would have done with the Jamelia/Peter debacle too, but I 
can’t help feeling that Anita was a victim of Gleb’s choreography this week, 
which isn’t really her fault.


I’m also gutted that we won’t get to see two minutes of back-to-back Gleb 
Specials in their showdance next week. Can you imagine? Alas we’ll never know.

 
Meanwhile Anita and Gleb’s Salsa is not great - some timing issues and very 
loose footwork in and out of several of the 97 lifts. Eeeek.
 
Well this is definitely a more confident and assured Waltz from Katie, 
although you could still drive a bus between them in places. But footwork and 
balance is much better.
 
I’m a bit worried about Anita and Gleb in this dance-off. If it comes down to 
Len with the deciding vote, he might well pick Katie and Anton, the Salsa 
really wasn’t his cup of tea (or a Salsa, for that matter).
 
Time for another montage, but this is just a taster of how many we’ll get next 
week. I might include it in Strictly Come Bingo.
 
So who else is joining Anita and Gleb in the dance-off? Georgia and Giovanni 
are safely through to the final (quite right too), which means KATIE AND ANTON 
are in the dance-off!


I think Anton’s semi might be coming to an end.
 
Tonight’s musical interlude comes courtesy of the nation’s favourite 80s 
aussie soap actress-turned pop pixie, Kylie Minogue. She’s singing “I’m going 
to be warm this winter”, presumably because she’s claimed her Winter Fuel 
Allowance. Personally I’d have put some warmer trousers on, you’ll catch your 
death in those hotpants.

Look, I love Christmas as much as anyone, but this is dreadful.

 
Anita and Gleb are doing their non-Salsa again in the dance-off. Nooooo! BAD 
DECISION.
 
So who is the first couple in the dance-off, and who is safely through to the 
GRAND FINAL? Jay and Aliona are though (excellent), along with Kellie and Kevin 
(hits mute button).

First couple in the dance-off: ANITA AND GLEB! Well, we expected that.

 
Last night on Strictly – a couple of lovely Viennese Waltzes, a mixed bag of 
Charlestons, a cheeky Cha Cha, a gappy Waltz, a raunch-free Rumba and a classy 
American Smooth. Anita and Gleb managed a Foxtrot that was actually an American 
Smooth, and a Salsa that was an aerobics routine sponsored by 
hideousoutfits.com. If that’s Gleb’s idea of a Salsa, I can’t WAIT to see his 
showdance next week.
 
Tess and Claudia dress watch: Tess in black with random mirror-shard boobage, 
Claudia in a black lace nightie. Meh.
 
And we’re off! I love watching the opening titles at this stage of the 
competition, Daniel O’Donnell, Anthony Ogogo and Kirsty Gallagher all feel like 
such a distant memory.


Tonigh’s pro dance opens with Tristan and a clipboard. They’re all in a 
terrible nightclub, busting latin moves to J-Lo’s On The Floor, which also 
features Pitbull. Are they on some kind of 2-for-1 deal on Pitbull tracks this 
week?

 
Casual Countryfile Weatherperson Update (the last of this Strictly season – 
wah!): a sensibly-attired Matt Taylor dressed like an estate agent. I’m already 
nostalgic for the days of jeans and check shirts, made the crappy weather seem 
better, somehow.
 
Every week I feel like this show is judging me for not buying a Countryfile 
calendar. What if I give a few quid to Children in Need and hang my Gleb 
Savchenko one instead? There’s no happy hedgehog, but plenty of shirt-free 
Gleb. What’s not to love?

 
What’s occurring on Countryfile? Currently there is an In-depth discussion 
around the growing wild boar population, and Matt Baker (in a horrible blue 
beanie hat) doing chemistry experiments on limestone. I’m not sure I can bear 
the excitement.
 
Evening all, and welcome back for tonight’s Strictly Results Show! Last 
night’s double-dancing semi was an up and down affair from start to finish - 
there was definitely a whiff of ‘not enough rehearsal time’, and bonkers 
scoring all round from the judges. By rights It should be Katie and Anton going 
home this evening, but we’re at the stage in the competition where anything 
could happen, and usually does.


I’ll be here from 7.20pm to record all the action for future generations to 
ponder, so join me here then. It’s our very last Sunday show of the season, so 
let’s make it a good one. See you in a bit!
