Welcome to Hear here, our new column on podcasting. Here, we’ll discuss great 
episodes and share new discoveries – and we hope you’ll chip in with your own 
recommendations.


Something enlightening

Let’s start with a classic. This week’s This American Life episode is a 
delightful delve into the show’s archives.Promised Land 
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/259/promised-land> 
features all kinds of people who are looking for a spiritual awakening, from a 
little girl’s devotion to Disneyland to a potentially life-changing 
conversation overheard on a train. In it, the late and wonderfulDavid Rakoff 
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/contributors/david-rakoff> tries a 20-day fast 
to see if he can achieve spiritual enlightenment like the Buddha, monks, saints 
and new age gurus have accomplished. He doesn’t exactly (“I think I’m doing it 
wrong!”), but it’s worth every minute. Plus,Ira Glass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/07/ira-glass-i-feel-like-im-actually-sort-of-scared-all-the-time>
 sings (is that a plus?).

Something hopeful


Another Round <https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround> has been one of the 
happiest results of the podcasting boom. Produced by Buzzfeed and hosted by
Heben Nigatu <https://twitter.com/heavenrants> and Tracy Clayton 
<https://twitter.com/brokeymcpoverty>, it features heartwarming, funny-as-hell 
episodes such as this week’s on 11-year-oldMarley Dias 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/09/marley-dias-1000-black-girl-books-hits-target-with-outpouring-of-donations>
, who created the#1000blackgirlbooks 
<http://grassrootscommunityfoundation.org/1000-black-girl-books-resource-guide/>
 campaign to collect children’s books with black girls for main characters, 
after becoming tired of reading about “white boys and their dogs”.

She talks about travelling to Ghana, where “literally every single place you 
go there is a black person on a billboard” or on the street, and delivers lines 
such as: “In America, there’s so much difference in everyone, that it’s just 
hard for us to sometimes feel like we’re special or that we’re important 
because we know there are other people out there who are still different than 
us and what does that prove to us? It doesn’t give us power, it doesn’t make us 
feel important if we feel like we’re alone.” Yep, she’s 11 alright. The 
roundtable that follows with her, the hosts and writerAshley Ford 
<https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle> discussing their favourite books is 
unmissable.

Come for the cuteness, stay for the female empowerment.

Something blue

“I put on a sweater. I went outside with him for a parting cigarette and 
kissed him goodbye in the forgiving October air. We had met in October, too, 
and at once it seemed like a very long time ago and only a whisper, like all 
time, really.” If the New York Times’sModern Love 
<http://www.nytimes.com/column/modern-love> column series about relationships 
wasn’t touching enough, this podcast is taking our teary commutes to the next 
level. The premise is simple: actors and notable personalities narrate essays 
from the series, often with updates from the writers. Somehow, though, the 
simplicity makes it all the more powerful. This week, actressTaissa Farmiga

Bonus: something new(ish)

If you still haven’t listened to 2 Dope Queens 
<http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens/>, you can catch up with it and get that 
feeling of completion without having to renounce your social life. This standup 
and storytelling podcast launched a couple of months ago on WNYC. It’s recorded 
in Brooklyn before a live audience and features Phoebe Robinson and Jessica 
Williams, along with their comedians of choice, talking about “sex, romance, 
race, hair journeys, living in New York, and Billy Joel. Plus a whole bunch of 
other s**t”. This week, on top of some excellent standup guests, the hosts 
imagine what they’d do if they had a penis for a day (Spoiler alert: “Nothing 
substansh.” Head to minute 40:42). Phoebe also reveals that she “gave up on 
life two days ago and signed up for Tinder” – and provides the most accurate 
analysis of the dating app I’ve heard to this day.
