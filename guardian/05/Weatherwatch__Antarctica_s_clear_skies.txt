If you are looking for the calmest, driest and coldest place on Earth your 
search could be over. Astronomers seeking the best site in the world for an 
observatory discovered a place known simply as Ridge A, 4,052m (13,297ft) high 
up on the Antarctic Plateau. Not only is the weather serene, but the place is 
so pristine no human is thought to have ever set foot there.

It might seem bizarre to find such peace and calm on Antarctica, famous for 
spectacular blizzards and vast piles of snow and ice. But the Antarctic 
Plateau, deep in the continent's interior, is far removed from the howling 
winds and big snowfalls that afflict much of the lowlands below.

The big disadvantage for anyone tempted to look for a peaceful retreat there 
is the intense cold; the average winter temperature is -70C (-94F). That 
intense cold also makes it incredibly dry, and with very little wind and 
atmospheric turbulence, the stars don't twinkle in the night sky, a huge bonus 
for an astronomical observatory.

"It's so calm that there's almost no wind or weather there at all," said the 
science team leader Will Saunders, of the Anglo-Australian Observatory in 
Australia. "The astronomical images taken at Ridge A should be at least three 
times sharper than at the best sites currently used by astronomers. Because the 
sky there is so much darker and drier, it means that a modestly sized telescope 
there would be as powerful as the largest telescopes anywhere else on earth."
