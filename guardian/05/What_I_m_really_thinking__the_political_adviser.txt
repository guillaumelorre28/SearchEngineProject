I’m only here to help get you elected. But why you? Yes, I know, you won the 
party’s nomination, but did they realise that, despite your firm handshake and 
boyish charm, you know as much about corporate tax policy as I know about 
astrophysics? That you can’t name the president of France?

OK, now it’s your turn. Fill your soul with compassion for the less fortunate. 
Look at the audience. Stick to our talking points. Smile.
