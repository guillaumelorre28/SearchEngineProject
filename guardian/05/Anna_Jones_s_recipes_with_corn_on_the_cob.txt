There is something about corn and warm days that sits just right. Every single 
summer holiday I have been on has memories of corn: maybe I seek it out. 
Crunched straight off the cob, bathed in lime and butter, eaten with sandy feet 
on the beaches of Indonesia. Little plastic cups piled withelote corn 
<http://www.yummly.com/recipe/Mexican-street-corn-_elotes_-370469?prm-v1>, 
trimmed from its kernels, topped with sour cream, mayonnaise, cayenne and a 
squeeze of lemon from stands that line Mexican beaches and roadsides, and 
tamales – little patties of fluffy cornmeal wrapped in their husks and steamed 
over fires on the Native American reservations of Arizona. There is something 
about the sweet pop of a kernel of corn that makes it OK to eat when its 
searingly hot, when almost nothing else (apart from an ice-cream or an ice-cold 
coconut) will do.

Here in the UK, we are eating record amounts of it – 4 million cobs a week in 
the summer of 2014 apparently – and here, too, there seems to be a rule that 
when its hot outside we reach for the corn. The first of the English corn 
arrived only a few weeks ago. It’s so good that I have had it for dinner at 
least twice a week and will again tonight. In my local greengrocer, six fat 
cobs still in their husks cost just £1: try to find me a cheaper dinner.

The first, freshest corn I treat with restraint, just like the first 
asparagus: I cook them simply with little fuss and flavour; just a good dousing 
of sea salt and butter. The first heads have their green, papery husks peeled 
away and the cobs simply plunged into boiling water in my biggest pot. I use a 
lid from a smaller pan to weigh them down and stop them bobbing, so they cook 
evenly. I don’t add salt when cooking, as it’s said to toughen up the kernels, 
but I add it generously after to offset the sweetness.

As the weeks draw on and the corn nears the end of its run, I look for more 
ways to use my six cobs for £1. This week, I took my cobs to south India, with 
a dousing of spice and ghee and a fresh green herb and coconut chutney. My 
favourite combinations are mapped out below.

Often a corn soup finds its way to the stove, or a chowder with some potato 
and musky smoked paprika, or a green, coriander-heavy Mexican soup (more of 
that in a couple of weeks).

I make quick curries from quickly shaved ears of corn, with chilli, cumin 
seeds and toasted coconut and serve it piled next to chapatis with a spoonful 
of mango, thick cooling yoghurt and a few wedges of lime. I mix some freshly 
sheared kernels with a couple of eggs, a spoonful of flour and some cottage 
cheese and – corn’s favourite flavour match – chilli, then fry spoonfuls into 
little fritters, eaten at breakfast with some mashed avocado, or at tea with 
some salad.

Then there is cornmeal, the mainstay of cooking in Central America. Polenta 
recipes we’ll leave for the winter, but one thing I often make with cornmeal is 
cornbread. This one I make on repeat, dotted with little tomatoes and eaten 
with avocado-and chilli-spiked black beans for a summer breakfast or brunch – 
but it has enough flavour to stand up on its own.

Sweetcorn loses its sweetness by the hour. The quicker you can get it into the 
pot, or on to the grill, the better. Success depends more on shopping than 
cooking. If you find the corn still in its husk, make sure the husks are green 
and supple, not dry and pale, and that the corn underneath feels plump and 
full. Avoid the overly sweet varieties at the supermarket, which are, in my 
opinion, sweeter than necessary – and I have a very sweet tooth.

Traffic-light tomato cornbread brunch (pictured above)


Serves 6 
150g cornmeal or polenta 
A pinch of salt
1½ tsp baking powder
1 tsp runny honey 
A good pinch of ground cumin
A good pinch of hot smoked paprika
150ml milk
100ml natural yoghurt
½ a bunch of fresh coriander
½ a bunch of fresh basil
Olive oil
Zest and juice from 1 unwaxed lime 
1 egg, beaten
2 ears of corn, husks removed
1 fresh green chilli, trimmed and sliced
400g ripe small or cherry tomatoes, halved
2 avocados

 For the beans
2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 
2 x 400g tins black beans with liquid
A pinch of cinnamon

1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Grease a high-sided 20cm ovenproof 
dish or frying pan and pop it in the oven until hot – this will give a nice 
crisp crust to your cornbread.

2 Put the cornmeal/polenta, sea salt, baking powder, honey and spices in a 
bowl and mix to combine.

3 Put the milk, yoghurt, coriander and basil (including the stalks), 2 tbsp of 
oil and lime zest into a liquidiser. Squeeze in the juice from half the lime 
and whizz until combined. Add the beaten egg, and pulse to combine.

4 Pour the wet mixture into the dry and stir. Cut the kernels from the ears of 
corn and fold into the mixture along with the chilli.

5 Remove the hot dish from the oven and pour the mixture in. Put the tomatoes 
on top, cut-side up, then bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until puffed and golden.

6 Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a small saucepan. Add the garlic, cook for a 
minute, then add the black beans and their liquid and the cinnamon. Cook for 
6-8 minutes, or until thick and glossy, then set aside. Keep warm.

7 Stone, peel and mash the avocado with some lime juice. Serve the cornbread 
in slices with the smashed avocado and black beans on the side.

Corn on the cob with chutney and mustard-seed butter

How I’ve been eating corn all summer: grilled and rolled in spiced butter then 
topped with a punchy, but fresh, green chutney.

For the corn
4 ears of corn
100g butter or ghee
1 tbsp mustard seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
A sprinkling of dried red chilli
For the chutney
A large bunch of coriander
A large bunch of mint
2 green chillies
2 tbsp coconut cream
Juice and zest of 2 limes

1 Warm a griddle or barbecue. Pull the leaves from four corn cobs, and when 
the griddle is hot, cook the corn on the grill, turning regularly, so it is 
deep gold and brown here and there: this will take about 10 minutes.

2 Put the herbs, chillies, coconut cream and lime juice in a blender and blitz 
until you have a brilliant green herb paste, adding a little water or olive oil 
to loosen, if you need to. Taste and season with salt, adding a little more 
lime or chilli, if needed.

3 Warm the ghee or butter in a small pan and, once it’s hot, add the mustard 
seeds and cumin seeds. Cook for a minute or so until the mustard seeds pop, 
then take off the heat and sprinkle with chilli.

4 When the corn is tender, remove to a baking tray and pour over the warm 
butter, anointing every last kernel in the spiced butter. Put on plates, spoon 
over the green chutney and serve.
