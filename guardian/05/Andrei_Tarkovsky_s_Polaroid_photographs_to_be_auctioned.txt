Ghostly images of a lost world, the Polaroid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/polaroid> photographs taken by the 
film directorAndrei Tarkovsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/andrei-tarkovsky>, shot in his native Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>, and in Italy when he was working on 
his revered 1983 film, Nostalghia, are to be auctioned.

Many of the images which are particularly technically flawed are expected to 
be among the most coveted when the collection is sold by his son Andrey, who is 
also his archivist, at Bonhams auction house in October. Blurry, hazed with 
light spill, or with colour fading into watercolour softness, they have the 
eerie haunted atmosphere of many of the director’s own films – and many 
directly echo frames from his works.

“These photographs were intensely personal to him,” Daria Chernenko, head of 
the Russian art department at Bonhams, said. “Once he discovered thePolaroid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/polaroid> camera, friends recall him 
with it always in his hand. And his son told me that when his father travelled, 
he carried the entire collection of Polaroids with him everywhere he went. 
Every image was personally chosen: some are quite misty, but they are ones he 
wanted to keep – as he took them, he routinely burned the ones he was 
dissatisfied with.”

His scriptwriter, Tonino Guerra, wrote in an introduction to an album of the 
photographs published in 2006: “Tarkovsky often reflected on the way that time 
flies, and this is precisely what he wanted: to stop it, even with these quick 
Polaroid shots.”

Tarkovsky’s films, including Ivan’s Childhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/ivans-childhood-andrei-tarkovsky-review-audacious-lucid-classic>
, Solaris, Mirror and Stalker, were heaped with international awards and 
worshipped by many other directors.Ingmar Bergman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ingmarbergman> described him as “the 
greatest”, and Danish directorLars Von Trier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/lars-von-trier> dedicated his film Antichrist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/16/antichrist-lars-von-trier-feminism>
 to him, saying in a recent interview: “It’s the closest I’ve got to a religion 
– to me he is God.” But Tarkovsky had endless problems with the Soviet 
authorities over funding, distribution and censorship.

He died in self-imposed exile in 1986, aged just 54 – leading some to suggest 
he was murdered. He was buried in Paris in the Russian section of the Sainte 
Geneviève cemetery, under a memorial created by the sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, 
inscribed in Russian “To the man who saw the angel”.


The film historian Mark Le Fanu described Tarkovsky’s adoption of the Polaroid 
camera as “an addiction”. He said: “There was something about the way that the 
camera gave an instant image of the view being photographed that he found 
propitious, and useful, for his task of location hunting. That, and the fact 
that he liked their saturated but at the same time diffused (and ever so 
slightly ‘retro’) colour reproduction, which gave to each of the stills an air 
of mystery.”

The 257 Polaroids are being sold in 29 lots, which it is estimated could sell 
in total for up to £500,000. Chernenko said his son’s decision to split the 
collection into themed lots was because the whole collection was likely to be 
too expensive for the many enthusiasts who would like to acquire some of the 
photographs.

“We very much hope some will be acquired by a museum or film institute,” she 
said.

• The photographs will go on display at Bonhams <https://www.bonhams.com> in 
London from 2 October, before the sale on 6 October.

• This article was amended on 17 August 2016. The standfirst (summary) of the 
original incorrectly stated that photographs could could fetch up to £50,000. 
The correct estimated price, as stated in the article, is £500,000.
