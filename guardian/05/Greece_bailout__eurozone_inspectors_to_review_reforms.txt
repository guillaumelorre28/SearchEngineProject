Eurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> inspectors of 
Greece’s bailout have been cleared to return to Athens to complete a 
much-delayed review of the government’s adherence to its economic reform 
commitments.

Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone’s top official, said there was “enough 
common ground” between the two sides for the inspectors to return to the Greek 
capital as soon as Tuesday.


However, he said the Greek government had more work to do if the review was to 
be favourable, notably on plugging a budget hole and deepening certain reforms.

A successful review of the reforms that were demanded in the country’s latest 
€80bn (£62bn) bailout programme

 is needed to release more rescue loans and pave the way for discussions on how 
to reduce Greece’s debt burden. Dijsselbloem confirmed the debt discussions 
would be forthcoming.

Separately, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Monday that 
Cyprus <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cyprus> had ended the IMF-leg of a 
three-year rescue programme a week ahead of schedule.

Christine Lagarde hailed Cyprus for delivering “an impressive turnaround of 
the economy” in the past three years. She said the Cypriot economy grew again 
last year, the banking system was on a more solid footing, spending was in 
check and public debt was shrinking.

But she said Cyprus needed to stick to reforms in light of continued 
volatility in international markets.

Cyprus received €1bn from the IMF and another €9bn from its eurozone partners

 in March 2013 in a rescue deal that forced a grab of uninsured savings in its 
two largest banks and led to the closure of the smaller lender.
