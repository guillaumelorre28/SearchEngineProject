Apologies again for the tech glitch that prevented us starting on time. But 
thank you for staying with us and we look forward to normal service - twits 
doing daftness with commentary - resuming next week. See you in the comments!

Next week, they are throwing the team right into the pit with the advertising 
challenge. It looks like Alan gets pretty angry about jeans next week. 
Something to look forward to.

Michelle is bitter and thinks Rebecca is skating on very thin ice. Back at the

Alan’s summarising and he starts with Rebecca. She’s a bit meh, Alana didn’t 
something or other, Michelle didn’t boss good.

But Rebecca feels the crosshairs hot on her forehead.

Alan says Michelle didn’t take control of her team properly. When do we think 
we’re going to find out Alana was actually named after Alan by her Apprentice 
super-fan mum? Perhaps there’ll be a subplot which reveals she’s actually 
Alan’s daughter? I’m drifting off while they argue.

In terms of television, I suppose Rebecca would be the least noticeable loss 
on account of her not making any kind of impression at all. It would be like 
Lord Sugar firing water or air.

Alana and Michelle turn on Rebecca because she looks a bit weak and an easy 
target because she sold nowt.

Claude also has it in for her. Is she to be the first sacrifice for blending

Trishna has put in quite a chippy boardroom performance so far, saying she 
knew it was all bobbins and she was the only one who tried to do it properly. 
All eyes turn towards Michelle for want of a better scapegoat.

She brings back Alana and Rebecca. I don’t think she even knows who Rebecca 
is. I certainly don’t.

That tray of polystyrene cups is so depressing. They’re not even allowed mugs. 
That’s how austere this segment gets. They don’t deserve china.

The arguing begins. Michelle says she isn’t here to make friends and starts 
fighting for her life. Everyone blames everyone else but not for long as 
they’re back in boardroom hell.

Never mind the boys lindy-hopping. Cut the bitter recriminations over scummy 
tea and disconsolate elbows on sad formica.

Apologies again for the tech glitch that prevented us starting on time. But 
thank you for staying with us and we look forward to normal service - twits 
doing daftness with commentary - resuming next week. See you in the comments!
 
Next week, they are throwing the team right into the pit with the advertising 
challenge. It looks like Alan gets pretty angry about jeans next week. 
Something to look forward to.
 
Michelle is bitter and thinks Rebecca is skating on very thin ice. Back at the 
house, the teams welcome back Alana and Rebecca and quiz them on what the 
firing finger jamboree is like.
 
As the drums build it’s Michelle! The PM is fired and she thanks Alan for the 
opportunity. The opportunity to run around London like a pillock, and have it 
filmed for TV.
 
Alan’s summarising and he starts with Rebecca. She’s a bit meh, Alana didn’t 
something or other, Michelle didn’t boss good.

But Rebecca feels the crosshairs hot on her forehead.
 
Alan says Michelle didn’t take control of her team properly. When do we think 
we’re going to find out Alana was actually named after Alan by her Apprentice 
super-fan mum? Perhaps there’ll be a subplot which reveals she’s actually 
Alan’s daughter? I’m drifting off while they argue.
 
In terms of television, I suppose Rebecca would be the least noticeable loss 
on account of her not making any kind of impression at all. It would be like 
Lord Sugar firing water or air.
 
Alana and Michelle turn on Rebecca because she looks a bit weak and an easy 
target because she sold nowt.

Claude also has it in for her. Is she to be the first sacrifice for blending 
into the wallpaper?
 
Karrren tucks into Alana while the three wait outside. It’s not long before 
they are marched back in. Who is getting the firing finger right in their mush?
 
It’s reality show tradition that a woman should go first. The world is a 
misogynist. Business is a misogynist.
 
Trishna has put in quite a chippy boardroom performance so far, saying she 
knew it was all bobbins and she was the only one who tried to do it properly. 
All eyes turn towards Michelle for want of a better scapegoat.

She brings back Alana and Rebecca. I don’t think she even knows who Rebecca 
is. I certainly don’t.
 
Grainne appeared briefly there, frozen in the headlights. Has she spoken yet 
or is she a Westworld escapee stuck in a reverie?
 
Frances (no distinguishing features so far) blames Alana as sub-team leader 
for the poor pricing policy at the car boot. Natalie (Scots) apologies for 
selling two £300 vases for £15. I hope the vases’ new owner is watching tonight 
and drinking champagne out of those vases.
 
Lord Sugar aims both barrels at the team in general and Aleksandra (god it 
takes a long time to type her name) jumps straight in and blames the team 
leader with a side order of Alana.
 
That tray of polystyrene cups is so depressing. They’re not even allowed mugs. 
That’s how austere this segment gets. They don’t deserve china.

The arguing begins. Michelle says she isn’t here to make friends and starts 
fighting for her life. Everyone blames everyone else but not for long as 
they’re back in boardroom hell.
 
Never mind the boys lindy-hopping. Cut the bitter recriminations over scummy 
tea and disconsolate elbows on sad formica.
