"Primitive, uncivilized, loutish" is how the Oxford English Dictionary puts 
it, a neat summary of the way the Neanderthal name is taken in vain. The beetle 
brow and thick-set features, perhaps, discourage the view that these ancients 
fizzed with ideas. But the real reason reactionaries are branded Neanderthal is 
that they are seen as a crude prototype of ourselves, a throwback to the 
brutish times before the new-and-improved Homo sapiens.

That conceit is misguided. Neanderthals are not so much one rung down the 
evolutionary ladder as a separate branch growing from the same trunk as 
ourselves. Our ancestors lived alongside them, and new DNA analysis suggests 
little interbreeding. Working with a Neanderthal who died long ago in what is 
now Croatia, the Max Planck Institute is charting the species' genome.

The emerging map shows they were always quite rare - there were probably never 
more than 10,000 of these people alive. And people they fully deserve to be 
called, in the light of what we already knew. Neanderthals were once presumed 
to be dumb, but they turned out to have the hyoid bone needed for speech, and 
one expert reckons they conversed in a musical tongue.

Their brains were bigger than ours, and similar in structure. Grave goods show 
they looked after the dead, and specimens that survived into frail old age 
prove they looked after the living as well. In the end, it may well be that 
modern man wiped them out. Maybe the lazy caricatures are an expression of 
collective guilt.
