Taboo

London, 1814. In top hat and trench coat, Tom Hardy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hardy> is every inch the anti-Poldark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark>. He plays James Keziah 
Delaney, an irascible renegade last seen on a slave ship in Africa and long 
presumed dead, who shows up at his father’s funeral. It’s a gruff gothic 
thriller, hooking us in with sordid rumours, gravediggers and supernatural 
visions. Co-written by Hardy with his dad, Chips, and produced byRidley Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott>.

Chewing Gum

At the Baftas last year, the Beyoncé-loving acting-and-writing sensation 
Michaela Coel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/04/michaela-coel-chewing-gum-e4-comedy-series-men-and-sex>
 accepted her award for best female comedy performance wearing a gown her mum 
made – then gave a speech thanking her hero,Victoria Wood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/victoria-wood>, and encouraging black 
women to embrace their comedy, their beauty and the power of their voices. Coel 
has certainly found hers: there’s nothing else like Chewing Gum. Set on a 
council estate, it stars Coel as the naive Tracey, who falls in love with a 
white boy called Connor, then gets kicked out of her strict mum’s house. At 
series end, the pair were wandering off across the estate, in their pants, 
carrying binbags full of their belongings. You should watch this show.

(Ben Chaplin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chaplin>) takes an intriguing 
turn when she realises he’s a spook – then suddenly gets very dark indeed. A 
provocative study of obsession, longing and just how far down a criminal path 
desire can take you.

Love it or loathe it, without Lena Dunham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lena-dunham>’s show leading the way, some 
of our TV favourites would never have been greenlit. And if the penultimate 
season was anything to go by, this, its last ever series, will be 
heartbreaking, bitchy, emotionally astute and electric television. Goodbye 
Hannah, Jessa, Marnie and Shosh. We’ll miss your narcissistic ways.

The Deuce

There are a few rules to guarantee you melt the internet. First, you take 
David Simon <https://www.theguardian.com/media/david-simon>. Then you add James 
Franco <https://www.theguardian.com/film/james-franco> playing twin-brother 
mobsters. Finally, you throw inMaggie Gyllenhaal

New York’s former porn HQ, Times Square.

Line of Duty <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/line-of-duty>

For three years, it’s been a relentlessly tense barrage of corruption and 
torture and murder, tightening the screws with each new series and becoming 
ever more polished and unforgiving. The 2016 series was the best yet, dripping 
with references to real-life abuse. IfJed Mercurio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/jed-mercurio> can top it, we’re all in 
trouble.
