Detectives have launched an investigation after a woman was sexually assaulted 
in her home while her young children heard her screams.

The 35-year-old woman was in bed when she heard a repeated knocking at the 
house’s front door shortly before 10.30pm on Wednesday, police said.


She opened the door and the stranger grabbed her by the throat and pushed her 
to the ground. He then sexually assaulted her before fleeing because of her 
loud screams, Greater Manchester police said.

Detectives appealed for information about the violent attack and said 
additional police officers would patrol the area in Heald Green, Stockport.

DI Julia Bowden of GMP’s Stockport borough said: “This was a terrifying attack 
for both the victim and her children who heard their mother’s screams.


“They are currently being supported by specially trained officers. Incidents 
of this nature are horrifying but rare and we are doing everything in our power 
to find the man responsible.

“We have a team of highly skilled detectives working round the clock and there 
will be additional officers patrolling the area.

“I would urge anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time to 
please contact us immediately.”

Police said the attacker was described as Asian, about 20 years old and 6ft 
with a slim build. He was wearing a dark green zip-up hooded top and dark blue 
baggy jeans.

Officers searched the surrounding area immediately after the attack and 
inquiries were continuing on Thursday, the force said.
