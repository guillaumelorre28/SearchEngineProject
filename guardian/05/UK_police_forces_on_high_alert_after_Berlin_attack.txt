Police forces across Britain are reviewing their security plans after the 
Berlin Christmas market attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/19/berlin-truck-crashes-into-christmas-market>
 and remain on high alert.

The threat level in London remains at “severe”, meaning an attack is 
considered highly likely, the Metropolitan police said on Tuesday.


A Downing Street spokesman said: “The safety and security of British citizens 
is the government’s number one priority. Clearly in the light of what has 
happened in Berlin, police will be reviewing what is in place.”

Theresa May sent a message of condolence to the German chancellor, Angela 
Merkel, on Monday night. “She expressed that her thoughts are with the people 
of Berlin and we stand ready to assist in any way we can,” a spokesman said.

Greater Manchester police said they had strengthened their presence at 
Christmas markets across the city.


Scotland Yard said an attack with a large vehicle had already been considered 
as a possible scenario prior to the Berlin lorry attack.

“The Metropolitan police has detailed plans for protecting public events over 
the Christmas and new year period. As a matter of routine … we review our plans 
after attacks overseas, and we are doing so at present following the awful 
incidents in Berlin andAnkara

 last night,” the Met said.

The Met also said it would it be bringing forward enhanced security measures 
for the Changing the Guard at Buckingham Palace, with the ceremony set to take 
place on Thursday and then again on Christmas Eve. The Met said it would be 
implementing road closures during the ceremonies.

Large numbers of people will be in London around the festive period as 
post-Christmas sales start, while more than 100,000 revellers are expected to 
attend the New Year’s Eve fireworks display on the banks of the Thames.

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, sought to reassure Londoners and visitors 
that the Met would review its security plans in light of Monday night’s events. 
“Keeping everyone safe remains the highest priority for the Met commissioner 
and for me,” he said.


Khan added: “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the awful 
suspected attack on Berlin last night, particularly those who were injured, the 
families and friends of those who were killed and all the emergency responders.


“We don’t yet have the full details, but this appears to have been a horrific 
and cowardly act of terror. All Londoners stand in solidarity with the people 
of Berlin today. This was an attack on our shared values, freedoms and way of 
life.”

Britain’s experience of Islamist terrorists using vehicles to stage attacks 
dates back to 2007, when a car was driven intoGlasgow airport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/03/terrorism.scotland> in an attempted 
suicide bombing.

 So-called “hostile vehicle mitigation measures” have been in place for 
several years.

 The threat to Christmas events and shoppers is seen by UK counter-terrorism 
officials as part of the severe threat level Britain faces.

 Nothing seen so far in Isis propaganda, which has inspired previous attacks, 
has urged plots targeting Christmas events. But there are calls for attacks 
against westerners at any time of the year.

 Counter-terrorism officials believe an attack against the UK is highly 
likely, in keeping with the current threat level. They are understood to be 
tracking and investigating plots they fear may be attempts to cause mass 
casualties in Britain.

In Manchester, police said they had strengthened their presence at the city’s 
Christmas markets, which have almost 350 stalls spread across 10 sites.

Assistant chief constable Debbie Ford said police already had a visible 
operation in place around the markets and in other key areas.

She said: “We will be working in line with the national response and have 
strengthened our policing presence at the Manchester Christmas markets and 
stepped up visible patrols, to ensure that people feel safe to go about their 
daily lives.

“I would like to stress at this point that there is absolutely no information 
or intelligence suggesting any attack is imminent in Greater Manchester.”

Dave Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands police, tweeted:

Terrible events in #Berlin <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Berlin?src=hash> last 
night. We always review events carefully to assess the protection we have in 
place for our communities.

Birmingham’s Christmas market, which claims to be the largest outside Germany 
and Austria, had concrete barriers installed to guard against terrorist attacks 
like that inNice in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bastille-day-truck-attack>, when a 19-tonne 
cargo truck was driven into crowds celebrating Bastille Day.

It is estimated that 5.5 million people will visit the market before it closes 
on 29 December. A West Midlands police spokesman said: “A number of security 
measures were agreed before the market opened, including installing some 
concrete bollards at a number of locations.”

Supt Andy Parsons said the bollards were part of the original security plan 
and not a result of any specific intelligence.

“It is a busy time of year for the city and we want to ensure a safe and 
enjoyable time for everyone who visits over the festive period,” he said. “Our 
policing tactics and security measures are constantly reviewed and we, along 
with our partners, are working around the clock to keep our cities as safe as 
can be.”

North Yorkshire police said their plans were constantly under review, and road 
closures and increased patrols were in place to protect people around York 
Christmas market and pedestrianised areas.

 A Merseyside police spokesperson asked people to remain vigilant during the 
festive season but added that police had a plan to ensure people’s safety.

This month Northumbria police were criticised by shoppers for the presence of 
armed officers at Newcastle’s Christmas market. Visitors complained on social 
media that officers with guns should not be at an event with so many children.

Nic King wrote on Facebook: “I don’t want to see guns the size of my child 
when Christmas shopping and these images have put me off going into Newcastle.” 
Northumbria police said the armed officers served to reassure the public.


Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> Scotland said their plans were 
being assessed after the events in Berlin. Assistant chief constable Bernard 
Higgins said: “Police Scotland has detailed plans in place to ensure the safety 
of the public at a wide range of festive and major events.

 “There is no intelligence at this time to suggest a threat to any specific 
event in Scotland. Any suspicious activity should be reported. Police Scotland 
work with a wide range of partners including the UK counter-terrorism network 
to ensure people can go about their lives safely and securely at all times.”

National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for protective security, deputy assistant 
commissioner Lucy D’Orsi, said it was “routine” to review and assess security 
measures following incidents like the attacks in Germany.

“I would like to reassure everyone that the police, along with the security 
and intelligence services, are tirelessly working together to deal with the 
terrorist threat to keep the public safe,” she said.
