A few names swirl from the mists over the pending chair of the new BBC unitary 
board. John Makinson, chair of Random House Penguin, and a formerFT journalist. 
Roger Parry, chair of YouGov, and a former BBC journalist. Sir David Clementi, 
former chair of the Prudential and no one’s idea of a journalist, but author of 
the report that clinched the demise of the BBC Trust and handed its regulatory 
role toOfcom <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom>.

Which, in turn, puts Ofcom itself in the frame. Here’s the Sky deal coming 
over for a decision. But here, too, from April on, is regulation of theBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> and thus of every commanding height in 
British broadcasting. Will that mean a separate BBC-watching sub-board in 
Southwark Bridge Road, as Clementi recommended? If so, who’ll lead it?

There’s a strange radio silence on such crucial points. “Between now and the 
effective date, Ofcom will be working hard to ensure that we have the right 
people and procedures in place so that we can deliver our new responsibilities 
effectively and efficiently,” says its first report on regulatory governance. 
Reassurance in the same league as Brexit means Brexit?
