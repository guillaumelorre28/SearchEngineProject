The British B&B is an institution – once derided but now lauded as the best in 
the world (at least according to recent Tripadvisor awards). Beyond the UK, 
B&Bs may not play such a prominent part in the holiday experience, but they can 
still make brilliant places to stay if the owners are both entertaining hosts 
and experts in the local area. We’d love to hear about a favourite place you 
know, whether in the UK or overseas.

Send us your tips via GuardianWitness, with as much detail as you can 
(including website and prices etc, if possible) inaround 100 words. There’s no 
prize on offer here; this one is just for sharing your experiences – and maybe 
bringing that top little B&B some extra business. You’re welcome to add a 
photo, too.
