The Hospital private members club in London played host to its third annual 
creative awards last night, attracting the great and the good of the media 
world.Alan Carr was awarded the TV gong and was introduced by Stuart Murphy, 
creative director of the independent production company TwoFour, as a 'fragrant 
bush', whatever that is, prompting a wry raising of the eyebrow from the comic. 
After collecting his award, Carr left the stage saying he was now off to appear 
on ITV2's CelebAir. Surely it hasn't come to that yet, Alan?
