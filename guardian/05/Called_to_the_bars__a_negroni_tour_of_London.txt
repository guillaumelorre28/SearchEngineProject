“I don’t really know what a negroni is,” confessed my companion who I’d roped 
in to accompanying me on London’s first negroni-themed tour. Our collective 
hipster point total plummeted. We were sitting in an upstairs room in68 & Boston
 <http://www.68andboston.com/>, a wine-and-cocktail bar in Soho, which has a 
gentleman’s club feel with its panelled walls, corniced ceiling and 
stained-glass windows. “Gin, vermouth, Campari,” I whispered to my friend who 
had unwittingly stumbled into this baptism of firewater.

This was the first stop out of five, as our guides, Leon and Max, took us on a 
quest to find the best negroni in town. While my friend had no idea what to 
expect, I had some prior experience. I had attended Leon’s inaugural tour,a 
London “gin journey” in 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/aug/23/gin-tour-of-london>. The format 
was similar: a minibus drives a small group around an eclectic selection of 
bars, with a cocktail and some good-humoured education at each stop. Since 
then, Leon has launched the tours in Liverpool, Manchester and, from June, 
Edinburgh. There are even plans to expand internationally, to Singapore, 
Sydney, New York and Amsterdam.

 Key ingredients for a negroni 
But why a specific negroni tour? Max has a theory as to why this cocktail has 
seen a spike in popularity across the UK. He thinks a generation that grew up 
on sickly-sweet alcopops sees the bitter negroni as the ultimate antithesis to 
the tropical-flavoured errors of our youth. Leon, whose early bartending days 
involved mixing frozen strawberry daiquiris, said he had a similar revelation 
when an older colleague first introduced him to the negroni. “It’s not an easy 
drink,” he admitted. “You have to have three before you like them.”

 Max discusses all things negroni with the writer (left) in the Merchant House 
Fortunately, everyone in our group was enthusiastic from the start. Max, who 
is part Italian and a vermouth fanatic, kicked things off with a potted history 
of the drink. It was allegedly created in Caffè Casoni in Florence (now called
Caffè Giacosa <http://www.caffegiacosa.com/index.php?file=history>) in 1919 
when a Count Negroni came back from travels in the US and ordered an americano 
cocktail (vermouth, Campari and soda), but asked the bartender to take it up a 
level by replacing the soda with gin.

Both Max and Leon went out of their way to share their passion for spirits. It 
would have been easy for them to cut corners and take us to four more bars 
within walking distance, but instead we set off on an ambitious trajectory no 
Londoner would ever attempt on a night out. Our bus takes us from Soho to 
Regent’s Park to Aldgate East, from a top-end hotel bar (theMeliá White House 
<http://www.melia.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/london/melia-white-house/Restaurants-and-bars.html>
) to Merchant House, a hidden gin den in the middle of the City.

The final bar of the night is my favourite. Aperitivo is a new, 
speakeasy-style gin and vermouth specialist, hidden away above theOliver 
Conquest <http://www.theoliverconquestpub.com/#!aperitivo/l1qh7> pub, on the 
City-East End border. Yet somehow it has eschewed pretension to retain the feel 
of a friendly, local boozer. The walls are plastered with magazine cuttings of 
music icons, the bar is framed by Beach Boy LPs, and there are candles in gin 
bottles dotted around. There’s a fun element, too, in the pick-and-mix menu 
that enables you to build your own negroni.

In fact, the entire tour had a satisfying pick-and-mix feel. Everyone could 
easily have walked away having found a different favourite drink of the night, 
or a different favourite bar. At closing time, we left armed with plenty of 
ideas, from how to recreate the drink at home to which bars should be on our 
future hit lists. I like to think further independent research will be required 
to truly earn my stripes. And with Aperitivo estimating that it alone has 1,200 
possible negroni combinations, I may be some time …

More unusual booze tours

Belfast: is it a bar? Is it a bike? 
Husband-and-wife team Ron and Jennifer Kenna have brought a pedal-powered 
mobile bar to the streets of Belfast so that visitors can see the sights of the 
city from the comfort of their own bar stool. Up to 15 participants sit around 
a central bar, drinking their BYO drinks, and pedal the vehicle to various pubs 
and night spots. Crucially, steering, navigation and brakes are under the 
control of an abstinent driver.

Manchester. Photograph: Mark Briscoe 
The canals of Manchester aren’t the obvious places to evoke the Mississippi 
blues, but this is the theme of The Liquorists’ latest venture. The barge-based 
booze cruise includes drinks, a Southern-style barbecue, and a full history of 
bourbon and rye whiskey. If you favour an alternative tipple, try the Gincident 
or the Vodyssey.

Leicester: toast the Foxes
There are plenty of reasons to raise a glass in Leicester right now. Not only 
is the city celebrating footballing glory, it now has its own gin school. Ten 
miles north of the city, 45 Gin School is an artisan distiller amid farmland. 
The most economical way to visit is by arranging your own group visit (minimum 
10 people, £20pp), which includes a tour and G&T cocktail. Or learn to make a 
bottle of gin (£95pp, £110 a couple). Afterwards, head to the school’s bar,45 
West <http://45westdistillers.com/45-west-distillers--spirits-of-adventure.html>
, in Leicester’s city centre, where you can toast the Foxes with a special Blue 
Lady cocktail made from Burleighs gin, blue curaçao, egg white and sweetened 
lime juice.
