Welcome to our column on podcasting. Here, we’ll discuss great episodes and 
share new discoveries – and we hope you’ll chip in with your own 
recommendations. Thanks for all your comments last week: we are listening, and 
we do know there are so many fantastic episodes, mainstream and not, that 
deserve to be featured. Give us time! In the meantime, keep them coming.


Reply All goes full Serial

A female reporter’s weekly phone calls with a jailed man who says he didn’t 
commit the crime he’s serving for. An incomprehensible crime and trial from the 
late 90s, dissected over months by an enthralled journalist. Sound familiar? 
That’s because Reply All’s miniseries has all the Serial ingredients (with some 
sprinkles of Fargo) – and we could not have enjoyed it more.


Over the past three episodes, producer Sruthi Pinnamaneni has told a story 
that started when she discovered a man had been writing a blog inside a maximum 
security prison, and she gave him a call ... then was hooked for a year. See 
minute 15:42:

It gets better, and darker … and Part III just dropped. Reply All tackles all 
the sides you didn’t know the internet had – from the tragic to the hilarious, 
but always fascinating. This full-blown investigation proves it’s the best 
podcast around.

Come for the “correctional facility” calls, stay for the investigative 
storytelling.

Jeff Daniels sobers up


The actor Jeff Daniels is best known for perfecting “a particular brand of 
white American male that is not altogether likeable” – seeThe Newsroom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/10/breaking-the-newsroom-is-still-as-irritating-as-ever>
,The Squid and the Whale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/aug/14/why-i-love-bernard-berkman-squid-and-whale>
,Terms of Endearment <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxQPnTqPeVM> – as well as 
mastering “lovingly stupid” (Dumb and Dumber). What is probably less known is 
that, for the past 30 years, he has been working from his Michigan hometown – 
population 5,000. Daniel talks candidly about leaving New York for the Midwest, 
being so frustrated by the business that he “couldn’t even watch the Oscars”, 
and getting sober a second time around, having started drinking again after a 
decade of sobriety.


I had just turned 50, which is a speed bump – at 80 miles an hour. And I 
hadn’t drank for 14 years, had quit cold turkey. I was two months into 50, and 
I was checking into a hotel room in some city, I’m throwing the suitcase on the 
bed, and I hear a voice behind me – and it’s me, clear as day – say: ‘Don’t you 
think you’ve punished yourself enough?’

Anna Sale masterfully creates a no-judgment safe space for interviewees to 
open up about “the things we think about a lot and need to talk about more” – 
and addiction is one of them:

In acting, we call it “fire the judge”. It’s the devil on your shoulder. It’s 
the judge where you go out on stage and, right before you go into the big 
speech, that voice says “you’re going to screw this up.” You’ve got to fire 
him. And I didn’t fire him that day.

Come for Sale’s soothing voice, stay for the confessions.

Joanna Newsom in the garage

She’s so fantastically alien when she sings and plays that it almost feels 
wrong to hear songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and actor Newsom talk like the 
rest of us. But she’s great company, it turns out. Marc Maron, as most podcast 
fans will know, interviews guests in his garage in an honest, conversational 
manner that often results in really intimate chats. Here, Newsom describes her 
childhood in Nevada City (as hippy a town as Californian towns get), her 
obsessive harp-playing as a teenager, Renaissance paintings, and her 
preoccupation with permanence and “what it actually means to be remembered – 
which is basically to say death”.
