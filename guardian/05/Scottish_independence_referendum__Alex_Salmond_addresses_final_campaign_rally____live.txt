With only eight hours to go until polls open in a referendum that could 
transform the 307-year-old union ofScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> and the rest of the UK, the yes and 
no campaigns have been gathering for a series of emotional final rallies across 
the country.

 * In Perth, Alex Salmond, the SNP first minister for whom tomorrow’s 
referendum on independence is the culmination of his political career,told a 
rapturous crowd that this was “our choice, our opportunity, our time” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/live/2014/sep/17/scottish-independence-referendum-salmond-and-darling-interviewed-on-today-live#block-5419f26be4b04db5de86f5be>
. He gave a bullish run-through of his now-familiar arguments in favour of 
independence, and the crowd responded with the Barack Obama-like chant of “yes 
we can”.Salmond said an independent Scotland would be England, Wales and 
Northern Ireland’s “closest friend, most honest counsel and most committed 
ally”.

 * Earlier, former UK prime minister Gordon Brown, increasingly seen in these 
final days as the de facto leader of the no campaign, matched or surpassed 
Salmond in passion as he galvanised supporters with biblical language and 
warned that SNP policies could send an independent Scotland down “an economic 
trapdoor ... from which we might never escape

”.Other yes and no rallies took place in Edinburgh, Glasgow and elsewhere. 
 * Four new polls were released showing narrow leads for the no camp.

Around a hundred independence supporters gathered in front of Holyrood this 
evening in time for the BBC 10 o’clock news, which was being filmed at the 
parliament, reportsFrances Perraudin. The group sang Scottish folk songs and 
shouted anti-BBC chants, such as: “Where are your cameras, BBC?”

Those she spoke to told Frances the gathering was completely spontaneous.

“It’s more of a celebration than a protest,” says Clara Harris, a 21-year-old 
student. “I want to live in a place where my vote counts.”

“The yes campaign isn’t really a specific organisation,” said Lisette Boxman, 
28, who works at Edinburgh zoo. “It’s more of a movement.”

Kyle MacKay, 26, first attended a protest at the city’s Meadows before moving 
with the crowds down to Holyrood. “Blair Jenkins was right when he said that 
the yes campaign isout of control 
<http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2014/03/03/the-yes-campaign-is-out-of-control/> 
and that that’s a good thing.”

My colleague Polly Curtis sends this clip of yes campaigners chanting “yes we 
can” towards the BBC journalist brought in to replace political editor Nick 
Robinson after he was booed and heckled.

It was a strong speech, particularly Salmond’s argument that Scottish people 
are the ones best placed to deal with Scottish problems, his line about 
Commonwealth countries that have broken free from “Westminster” and never 
looked back, and his dismissal of the new powers on offer from the UK parties, 
which necessarily fall short of what he is offering himself. His promises about 
a fairer, nuclear-freeScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> with 
an unthreatened NHS are perhaps on shakier ground. Nevertheless Salmond must 
surely be pleased with the way he has set the terms of debate and dominated the 
arguments throughout this campaign. Whether that will be enough to get the yes 
campaign over the line tomorrow we will have to wait and see.PO

We are one nation, Salmond says. If the vote goes against us I pledge to 
accept that result with dignity.

But if the vote is yes there will cease to be a yes and a no campaign, there 
will only be TeamScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> to take 
this nation forward, he says. (Another echo of Barack Obama, this time of his 
remark that there are no red states or blue states, just the United States.)

Salmond says. He can’t believe Westminster politicians tell the nation of Adam 
Smith it can’t run its economy and Robert Burns that it doesn’t understand 
internationalism.

Scotland’s success can only be asserted when poverty is replaced by employment 
and opportunity, he says.

With only eight hours to go until polls open in a referendum that could 
transform the 307-year-old union ofScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> and the rest of the UK, the yes and 
no campaigns have been gathering for a series of emotional final rallies across 
the country.

 * In Perth, Alex Salmond, the SNP first minister for whom tomorrow’s 
referendum on independence is the culmination of his political career,told a 
rapturous crowd that this was “our choice, our opportunity, our time” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/live/2014/sep/17/scottish-independence-referendum-salmond-and-darling-interviewed-on-today-live#block-5419f26be4b04db5de86f5be>
. He gave a bullish run-through of his now-familiar arguments in favour of 
independence, and the crowd responded with the Barack Obama-like chant of “yes 
we can”.Salmond said an independent Scotland would be England, Wales and 
Northern Ireland’s “closest friend, most honest counsel and most committed 
ally”.

 * Earlier, former UK prime minister Gordon Brown, increasingly seen in these 
final days as the de facto leader of the no campaign, matched or surpassed 
Salmond in passion as he galvanised supporters with biblical language and 
warned that SNP policies could send an independent Scotland down “an economic 
trapdoor ... from which we might never escape

 reaffirming his opposition to Scottish independence.But of course this 
historic decision is completely out of his hands - it’s in the hands of the 
Scottish people, who will start voting at 7am tomorrow. We’ll have live 
coverage right here from then  
Around a hundred independence supporters gathered in front of Holyrood this 
evening in time for the BBC 10 o’clock news, which was being filmed at the 
parliament, reportsFrances Perraudin. The group sang Scottish folk songs and 
shouted anti-BBC chants, such as: “Where are your cameras, BBC?”

Those she spoke to told Frances the gathering was completely spontaneous.

“It’s more of a celebration than a protest,” says Clara Harris, a 21-year-old 
student. “I want to live in a place where my vote counts.”

“The yes campaign isn’t really a specific organisation,” said Lisette Boxman, 
28, who works at Edinburgh zoo. “It’s more of a movement.”

Kyle MacKay, 26, first attended a protest at the city’s Meadows before moving 
with the crowds down to Holyrood. “Blair Jenkins was right when he said that 
the yes campaign isout of control 
<http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2014/03/03/the-yes-campaign-is-out-of-control/> 
and that that’s a good thing.”

My colleague Polly Curtis sends this clip of yes campaigners chanting “yes we 
can” towards the BBC journalist brought in to replace political editor Nick 
Robinson after he was booed and heckled.
 
It was a strong speech, particularly Salmond’s argument that Scottish people 
are the ones best placed to deal with Scottish problems, his line about 
Commonwealth countries that have broken free from “Westminster” and never 
looked back, and his dismissal of the new powers on offer from the UK parties, 
which necessarily fall short of what he is offering himself. His promises about 
a fairer, nuclear-freeScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> with 
an unthreatened NHS are perhaps on shakier ground. Nevertheless Salmond must 
surely be pleased with the way he has set the terms of debate and dominated the 
arguments throughout this campaign. Whether that will be enough to get the yes 
campaign over the line tomorrow we will have to wait and see.PO
 
Let’s get to it, and let’s do it now, he says in conclusion.
 
The vote is not about Salmond or the political parties, he says - it’s about 
you. Don’t let them tell us we can’t. Let’s do this now.
 
It’s our choice, our opportunity, and our time, he says. All we seek is 
equality and friendship, he tells the rest of the UK.
 
We are one nation, Salmond says. If the vote goes against us I pledge to 
accept that result with dignity.

But if the vote is yes there will cease to be a yes and a no campaign, there 
will only be TeamScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> to take 
this nation forward, he says. (Another echo of Barack Obama, this time of his 
remark that there are no red states or blue states, just the United States.)
 
The argument has been won that Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> could be a hugely successful country, 
Salmond says. He can’t believe Westminster politicians tell the nation of Adam 
Smith it can’t run its economy and Robert Burns that it doesn’t understand 
internationalism.

Scotland’s success can only be asserted when poverty is replaced by employment 
and opportunity, he says.
 
Tomorrow we can choose hope over fear and opportunity over despair, he says. 
An NHS properly funded and always in public hands, he says (verblessly), ending 
the bedroom tax, and “a chance” to remove nuclear weapons.

After tomorrow Scots can get the government they vote for not the government 
someone else votes for, he says.

This is the greatest, most empowering moment we have experienced, he says. 

There are challenges to overcome - “undoubtedly” - but who better to meet them 
than the people who live and work in this nation?
 
Salmond contrasts the “fearmongering” in Downing Street, asking supermarkets 
to come out for no, with the ordinary Scots “getting on with making this 
country prosperous”.

He calls Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> the most 
politically engaged country in western Europe, and campaigners should be 
immensely proud, he says.

The Westminster parties have cobbled together their “contradictory” proposals 
for new powers for Scotland, he says. This is insipid and tepid, he says. But 
tomorrow he can take “every job-creating power” for Scotland, he says.

The crowd interrupts with chants of “yes we can”.

Salmond says Tory backbenchers and the House of Lords would block any such 
plans anyway. “Scotland’s future must be in Scotland’s hands.”
