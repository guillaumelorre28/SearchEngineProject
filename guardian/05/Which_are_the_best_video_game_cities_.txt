Anyone who has picked up a games controller in the past few years has 
marvelled at the impeccably detailed realism of the virtual cities in Bioshock, 
Grand Theft Auto,Assassin's Creed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/assassins-creed> and many more. But 
from SimCity to Minecraft, many of us have also made our own cities – labours 
of love that teach us it's not always easy to be a godlike mayor.

 Following our piece on what video games can teach us about cities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/10/watch-dogs-gtav-video-games-reshape-cities-sim-city-will-wright>
, we want to hear your favourite virtual places – from a beautiful view in GTA 
to that 20-million-strong SimCity megalopolis you've been building (or possibly 
destroying). What are the best game cities to live in? The worst? Perhaps 
you've designed one you think would be better than your own city?
