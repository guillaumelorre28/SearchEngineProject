Eurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> factories performed 
slightly better in April, with output not losing as much momentum as initially 
forecast although growth in activity stayed weak despite deep discounting, a 
survey shows.

 There was a mixed picture , with manufacturing growth strong in Italy and 
Spain last month while Germany showed signs of reviving.Activity in France, 
however, contracted at the steepest rate in a year.

 Markit’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the eurozone rose 
to 51.7 from March’s 51.6. A reading above 50 indicates growth.

 “The survey is signalling an anaemic annual rate of growth of manufacturing 
production of just less than 1%, which is half the pace seen in the months 
leading up to the recent slowdown,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at 
Markit.

 “The survey data therefore so far shows no signs of European Central Bank 
stimulus or the weaker euro helping to revive the manufacturing sector, at 
least for the euro area as a whole.”

 The eurozone economy grew 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the January-March 
period, early data showed last week

. While that was more than expected, inflation once again fell below zero last 
month as energy prices dropped.

 What is likely to make for grim reading in the survey for ECB policymakers is 
the deep discounting manufacturers have had to resort to to drum up new 
business, even though deflationary pressures appear to be easing slightly.

 The output price index came in below the flash reading of 47.7 at 47.4, 
higher than March’s 47.1. However, the latest result was the second-lowest 
since early 2010.
