 Congratulations were sent from many parts of the world yesterday to the 
British expedition that climbed Mount Everest (29,002 feet). The news was sent 
by the team in a wireless message to the British Embassy in Katmandu, Nepal, on 
Monday: "Hillary and Tensing climbed on May 29. All well." The Queen was 
immediately informed and it was announced half an hour before she left 
Buckingham Palace yesterday morning [June 2] that she had sent the following 
message to the minister in Katmandu: "Please convey to Colonel Hunt and all 
members of the British expedition my warmest congratulations on their great 
achievement in reaching the summit of Mount Everest."
The Embassy said the summit had been scaled at the second attempt; the first 
failed 1,500 feet from the top on May 25. The expedition should be clear of 
Everest itself by the end of this week, before the monsoon begins. It is 
expected back by the third week in June.

Embassy sources said that [Edmund] Hillary and Tensing [Norgay] had made their 
ascent after spending the night in a small tent at their last advanced camp on 
a ridge above the south col. Thanks to their equipment the two men, though 
handicapped by the light powdered snow that has foiled previous expeditions, 
experienced little difficulty from exhaustion and climbed the remaining 1,300 
feet in less than six hours.

During the few minutes that they stayed on the summit, the sources added, they 
took off their oxygen masks to take photographs of each other. Then they 
started the descent.
