From the beginning, education has been at the heart of the Guardian News & 
Media community programme, and in the last financial year GNM continued to 
support three long-term partners â€“Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (EGA) secondary 
<http://www.egaschool.co.uk/>, Winton primary 
<http://www.wintonprimaryschool.com/>, and Richard Cloudesley special needs 
school.

GNM has also prioritised media-related projects and over the 12 months 
maintained its partnerships with Pentonville prison's Voice of the Ville 
magazine and organised the mentoring of young people atLive magazine 
<http://www.live-magazine.co.uk/>.

We also ran a summer project with Live magazine for young people to experience 
an intensive two weeks at the Guardian and Observer learning about reporting, 
editing and all the elements needed to put together a mini magazine. You can 
read more about the projecthere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/live-north> and read what Diamond 
Abdulrahim thought about her experience as joint editorhere

In December 2011, the young journalists from Live magazine took part in a Live 
magazine Film & Music take-over 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/film-music-live-magazine>, 
developing feature ideas and articles with support from our journalists.

Zindzi Rochque Drayton, who took part in the project, commented on how it had 
given her practical insight into how the world of journalism works. "Writing 
for the Guardian had always been a dream of mine, but I never thought I'd be 
able to pitch an idea and get it commissioned. I didn't even know the process 
of getting an article in the newspaper, so working with Michael Hann for a film 
and music feature was extremely beneficial. It also gave me the confidence to 
develop more pitches and know that it is possible and I am capable of becoming 
a freelance journalist."

Within the media sphere, the Media Trust <http://www.mediatrust.org/>, of which
Guardian Media Group <http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/> is a partner, provided free 
places for all our community partners at their "Communications for a digital 
world" conference, as well as providing volunteer matching services for our 
partners.

Beyond education and the media, GNM's community programme also has a focus on 
supporting marginalised communities, and as part of this volunteers have been 
running and supporting sessions atAge UK Camden's Great Croft centre 
<http://www.ageuk.org.uk/camden/Local-directory/Great-Croft-resource-centre/>. 
Janet Woodward, one of the older people using the centre, said the volunteers 
are a "lifeline for us. We don't know what we would do without them."

GNM also developed a number of new projects with our partners, including staff 
delivering sessions for the Level Two Business BTEC withGlobal Generation 
<http://globalgeneration.org.uk/> and helping local job seekers in a club 
organised by Islington council andTeam Cally <http://www.teamcally.org.uk/>. 

The regular support from volunteers is greatly appreciated by the 
organisations we work with. For example, Marina Johnston, the head of literacy 
at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school, said: "It has been a pleasure to work 
with the Guardian volunteers, and they have provided the students with more 
than just support with their reading. The volunteers have built up very 
positive relationships with the girls, enabling them to learn from an adult 
from a different walk of life, which has really expanded their horizons."

Despite budget cuts, we have maintained relationships with all our community 
partners, although direct funding has been cut. For next financial year we will 
have a full review of all our relationships, and it might be necessary to 
augment part of what is an extensive programme of support in line with current 
funding and resources.
