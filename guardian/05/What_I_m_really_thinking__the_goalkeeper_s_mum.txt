They say that the goalkeeper is the loneliest man on the football pitch. Well, 
try putting that amount of pressure on a 10-year-old boy in a highly 
competitive environment.

Any other player can make a mistake, miss an open goal, give the ball away in 
the middle of the pitch, and it often doesn’t affect the game, but when your 
son misses the save, the one he has made over and over again in training, it 
breaks your heart.

You smile at him, give him the thumbs up, ignoring the other parents’ murmurs 
and groans, and you think to yourself: “You’re so brave – I’m so proud of you.”

Sympathetic smiles from the friendlier parents combat the looks of disgust 
from the fathers of the other boys, who seem to have forgotten all those times 
their sons have given the ball away or missed an easy tackle.

What I’m really thinking: the non-driving couple

My heart races, my stomach churns and I will him to carry on, to keep trying 
his hardest, not to let the mistake bother him. After all, it can change in a 
heartbeat, from zero to hero, and vice versa. When he leaps like a salmon and 
pushes that ball over the crossbar, making the most spectacular save, I am so 
relieved and happy for him. I can breathe again.

He, on the other hand, takes it all in his stride. He never gets nervous. 
Sometimes elation, sometimes frustration, but no tears – and by the time we are 
home from training or a game, it’s all forgotten. He has the heart of a lion; 
he does his best.

So, to those other parents who are quick to condemn, get a hold of yourselves 
– it’s kids playing football and it is meant to be fun.
