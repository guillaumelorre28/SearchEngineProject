The breakdown of the rig figures 
<http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&p=irol-reportsother> shows 
oil rigs falling by 11, gas rigs by 1 and miscellaneous rigs rising by 1 to 
give the total decline of 11 for the week.

The total is the lowest since November 2009, as oil companies continue to be 
cautious despite the revival in crude in recent days, with Brent around its 
highest levels for the year. The Baker Hughes figures showed:

comments, and we’ll be back next week.

S&P warns on Brexit risk for UK and says referendum will be close call

Standard and Poor’s has kept its UK credit rating at AAA, but with a negative 
outlook due to the risks of Britain leaving the European Union in what it 
expects to be a close referendum vote. It said:

 In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union 
(EU) as a consequence of a planned “leave or remain” referendum set for June 
23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to 
its large financial services sector and exports.

If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more 
difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% 
in 2015.

A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on 
Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty.

It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in 
three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added:

A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and 
is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a 
U.K. departure from the EU (or “Brexit”) would likely lead us to lower the 
long-term sovereign credit rating.

We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. 
goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to 
influence the EU’s policies for key sectors, including financial services.

In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.’s EU membership could also put at risk 
important external financing sources for the U.K.’s large current account 
deficit. The U.K.’s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the 
highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, 
the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955.

In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling’s role as a 
global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our ‘AAA’ 
rating on the U.K.

That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a 
small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well 
as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open 
economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys 
credible monetary policy.

Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month. Tony 
Cross at Trustnet Direct said:

Recapping the month, it’s been the miners that have shone as commodity prices 
appear to be moving away from the dark days seen at the start of the year and 
some stability is returning to the market. Anglo American is up 40% on the 
month, whilst a number of the sector peers have added 15%-20% too. The index 
may be comprehensively off the highs we touched just 10 days ago, but without 
the boost from commodity stocks, the picture for April would have looked a 
whole lot bleaker.

Oil prices have flattened out, with Brent crude now up just 0.1% at $48.2 a 
barrel.

But they are still on track for their biggest monthly gain in seven years, 
helped by a weaker dollar and signs of a dip in US production. The increase 
also came despite Opec’s inability to agree a cap on output at January’s levels 
to tackle the current supply glut.

The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said:

Consumer sentiment continued its slow decline in late April due to weakening 
expectations for future growth, although their views of current economic 
conditions remained positive. All of the April decline was in the Expectations 
component, which fell by 4.8% from one month ago and by 12.6% from a year ago 
and by 14.7% from its January 2015 peak. The retreat from the 2015 peaks was 
evident across a wide range of expectations about prospects for the national 
economy.

The size of the decline, while troublesome, is still far short of indicating 
an impending recession. The decline is all the more remarkable given that 
consumers’ assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal 
finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the 
past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to 
the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty 
about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates. 
Overall, the data indicate that inflation-adjusted personal consumption 
expenditures will grow by 2.5% in 2016.

More downbeat US data.

The Chicago purchasing management index 
<https://www.ism-chicago.org/insidepages/reportsonbusiness/> has come in at 
50.4 in April, compared to 53.6 in the previous month and expectations of a 
level of 53.

Philip Uglow, chief economist of compilers MNI Indicators, said:

This was a disappointing start to the second quarter, with the Barometer 
barely above the neutral 50 mark in April. Against a backdrop of softer 
domestic demand and the slowdown abroad, panellists are now more worried about 
the impact a rate hike might have on business than they were at the same time 
last year.

Wall Street opens lower

US markets have followed other global bourses lower, with the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average down 46 points or 0.2% in early trading.

Markets remain nervous as the yen hits an 18 month high, on concerns that the 
Bank of Japan may hold fire on any further stimulus measures after 
disappointing investors at this week’s meeting.

With mixed performances so far from the latest company reporting season - 
Apple being a notable casualty - markets are looking fairly fragile again. The 
FTSE 100 is down 0.9% while German and French markets are both down around 2%.

Stronger than expected eurozone growth figures have done little for equities, 
but helped push the euro higher.

The breakdown of the rig figures 
<http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&p=irol-reportsother> shows 
oil rigs falling by 11, gas rigs by 1 and miscellaneous rigs rising by 1 to 
give the total decline of 11 for the week.

The total is the lowest since November 2009, as oil companies continue to be 
cautious despite the revival in crude in recent days, with Brent around its 
highest levels for the year. The Baker Hughes figures showed:

Brent is currently 0.46% lower at $47.92 a barrel.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back next week.
 
The number of US oil rigs drilling has dropped for the sixth week in a row.

According to data from Baker Hughes, the number of rigs dropped by 11 to 420.
 
The strength of the yen after the Bank of Japan decided on Thursday to delay 
any further stimulus measures has helped push stock markets sharply lower on 
the last trading day of the month. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 1.27% or 80.51 points to 6241.89 
 * Germany’s Dax has dropped 2.73% to 10,038.97 
 * France’s Cac closed 2.82% lower at 4428.96 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB finished down 1.98% at 18,600.56 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 2.62% lower at 9025.7 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 583.65 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 122 points or 
0.69% lower.
 
Standard and Poor’s has kept its UK credit rating at AAA, but with a negative 
outlook due to the risks of Britain leaving the European Union in what it 
expects to be a close referendum vote. It said:

 In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union 
(EU) as a consequence of a planned “leave or remain” referendum set for June 
23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to 
its large financial services sector and exports.

If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more 
difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% 
in 2015.

A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on 
Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty.

It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in 
three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added:

A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and 
is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a 
U.K. departure from the EU (or “Brexit”) would likely lead us to lower the 
long-term sovereign credit rating.

We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. 
goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to 
influence the EU’s policies for key sectors, including financial services.

In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.’s EU membership could also put at risk 
important external financing sources for the U.K.’s large current account 
deficit. The U.K.’s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the 
highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, 
the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955.

In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling’s role as a 
global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our ‘AAA’ 
rating on the U.K.

That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a 
small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well 
as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open 
economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys 
credible monetary policy.
 
Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month. Tony 
Cross at Trustnet Direct said:

Recapping the month, it’s been the miners that have shone as commodity prices 
appear to be moving away from the dark days seen at the start of the year and 
some stability is returning to the market. Anglo American is up 40% on the 
month, whilst a number of the sector peers have added 15%-20% too. The index 
may be comprehensively off the highs we touched just 10 days ago, but without 
the boost from commodity stocks, the picture for April would have looked a 
whole lot bleaker.
 
A June rise in US interest rates looks a little unlikely, and not just because 
of the uncertain US economic data:

Oil prices have flattened out, with Brent crude now up just 0.1% at $48.2 a 
barrel.

But they are still on track for their biggest monthly gain in seven years, 
helped by a weaker dollar and signs of a dip in US production. The increase 
also came despite Opec’s inability to agree a cap on output at January’s levels 
to tackle the current supply glut.
 
And here’s a chart of the consumer sentiment index:

Michigan  
The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said:

Consumer sentiment continued its slow decline in late April due to weakening 
expectations for future growth, although their views of current economic 
conditions remained positive. All of the April decline was in the Expectations 
component, which fell by 4.8% from one month ago and by 12.6% from a year ago 
and by 14.7% from its January 2015 peak. The retreat from the 2015 peaks was 
evident across a wide range of expectations about prospects for the national 
economy.

The size of the decline, while troublesome, is still far short of indicating 
an impending recession. The decline is all the more remarkable given that 
consumers’ assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal 
finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the 
past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to 
the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty 
about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates. 
Overall, the data indicate that inflation-adjusted personal consumption 
expenditures will grow by 2.5% in 2016.
 
US consumer confidence is at its weakest since September last year, according 
to a new survey.

The University of Michigan consumers sentiment index  
<http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/>has fallen from 91 in March to 89 in April, 
below estimates of a level of 90.
 
More downbeat US data.

The Chicago purchasing management index 
<https://www.ism-chicago.org/insidepages/reportsonbusiness/> has come in at 
50.4 in April, compared to 53.6 in the previous month and expectations of a 
level of 53.

Philip Uglow, chief economist of compilers MNI Indicators, said:

This was a disappointing start to the second quarter, with the Barometer 
barely above the neutral 50 mark in April. Against a backdrop of softer 
domestic demand and the slowdown abroad, panellists are now more worried about 
the impact a rate hike might have on business than they were at the same time 
last year.

US markets have followed other global bourses lower, with the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average down 46 points or 0.2% in early trading.

Markets remain nervous as the yen hits an 18 month high, on concerns that the 
Bank of Japan may hold fire on any further stimulus measures after 
disappointing investors at this week’s meeting.

With mixed performances so far from the latest company reporting season - 
Apple being a notable casualty - markets are looking fairly fragile again. The 
FTSE 100 is down 0.9% while German and French markets are both down around 2%.

Stronger than expected eurozone growth figures have done little for equities, 
but helped push the euro higher.
