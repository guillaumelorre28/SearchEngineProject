Geno Auriemma, the US women’s basketball coach, isn’t going to start 
apologizing for his team being so good.

USA have been stung by some criticism that their dominant displays have been 
bad for the women’s good, but Auriemma pointed out that the US men’s team 
hasn’t been subjected to the same kind of scrutiny. A double standard?

Auriemma said: “We live in that Trumpian era where it’s OK to be sexist and 
degrade people that are good, just because they’re the opposite sex.

“We are what we are,” he said. “We’re never going to apologize for being that 
good. We’re never going to apologize for setting a standard that other people 
aspire to achieve. We got a guy in the pool with a USA swim cap on who nobody 
can beat. And if he wasn’t in swimming, there would be a lot of other guys with 
gold medals.

Donald Trump quadruples down on remarks he made last night in which he called 
President Barack Obamathe “founder of Isis” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-obama-founder-isis-most-valuable-player>
 at the American Renewal Project’s Pastors and Pews meeting, telling the 
audience three times that Obama and Hillary Clinton co-founded the terrorist 
network.

“Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: these are the founders of Isis. These are 
the founders of Isis, because of bad judgment. These are the founders of Isis,” 
Trump said, to a muted crowd.

“They get the most valuable player award - Isis is going to present them with 
the most valuable player award, like in high school. Most valuable player. You 
know, these are bad people, with bad judgment, and at the top we have an 
incompetent leader,” Trump says.

Trump’s remarks about Isis came while he is still dealing with backlash from 
his hint that gun rights supporters might attack Clinton, something thatseemed 
to cause genuine shock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment>
 in a country that has grown used to Trump pushing the boundaries of 
appropriate political discourse. On Thursday, Patti Davis, the daughter of late 
Republican former president Ronald Reagan, joined his critics to lambast him 
for what she called a “glib and horrifying comment”.

“They took away your voice! They took away the voice of great people.”

After sharp criticism for the creation of an economic advisory council 
composed of 13 white men - six of whom were named “Steve” - Donald Trump’s 
campaign has announced the addition ofnine more people to the council 
<https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/TRUMP_ECONOMIC_ADVISORY_COUNCIL_ADDITIONS_FINAL_round_two.pdf>
, eight of whom are women:

 * Diane Hendricks: Chair and owner of building products distributor ABC 
Supply Co., Inc. 
 * Darlene Jordan: Executive director of the Gerald R. Jordan Foundation, a 
nonprofit, and a former assistant attorney general for Massachusetts. 
 * Betsy McCaughey: A former New York lieutenant governor and anti-Obamacare 
advocate who popularized the “death panels” fraud. 
 * Brooke Rollins: CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a think tank. 
 * Anthony Scaramucci: A co-managing partner and founder of SkyBridge Capital, 
a global investment firm. 
 * Carla Sands: Chair of Vintage Capital Group, an investment firm. 
 * Judy Shelton: A former economic advisor for the National Commission on 
Economic Growth and Tax Reform. 
 * Liz Uihlein: Co-founder of Uline, Inc, a shipping and packaging company. 
 * Kathleen Hartnett White: Director of the Armstrong Center for Energy and 
the Environment at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. 
After Trump’s initial list was released, opponent Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> lambasted the council as 
showing Trump’s lack of emphasis on the economic struggles of women: “Well, so 
today in Detroit he’s got, oh, I don’t know, a dozen or so economic advisers he 
just named, hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, 
apparently.”

In closing, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> dismisses the threadbare 
economic plan proposed by opponent Donald Trump as “just a more extreme version 
of the failed theory of trickle-down economics” with the inclusion of 
“outlandish Trumpian ideas” rejected even by his own supporters in the 
Republican party.

president Mark Jurcak. Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP 
At the heart of the matter, Clinton says, is an ability to get economic 
proposals through Congress in the first place.

“Who can bring people together to get any of this done?” Clinton asks the 
audience about her economic plan, before emphasizing her belief in “leadership 
that rises above personal attacks and name calling, not revels in it. I just 
don’t think insults and bullying are going to get things done.”

“There was a time and Republicans actually worked together - I know that’s 
true, I did it as first lady, senator and secretary of state!” Clinton says. 
“We’re gonna get everyone at the table, not justRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> and Democrats, but businesses 
and labor unions and experts - and most importantly Americans, like all of you! 
I think there are a lot of great ideas out in America, and I want you to have a 
say about your government.”

“The bottom line is this,” Clinton concludes. “I’m running for president to 
build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top , and based 
on what we know about the Trump campaign, he wants America to work for him and 
his wealthy friends.”

Trump’s economic plan doesn’t address things like racial inequality, the 
rising cost of healthcare and prescriptions or the importance of clean energy, 
Clinton says: It’s “just a more extreme version of the failed theory of 
trickle-down economics, with his own addition of outlandish Trumpian ideas that 
even Republicans reject! And as we heard him say at his convention, he may 
believe that he alone can fix our country, but clearly he doesn’t know the 
people of Michigan.”

“There is still a long road ahead, but Michigan is on the rise, and everyone 
is contributing.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is a 
relatively new Wall Street skeptic, as anyone who has attended one of her 
high-paying bank speeches will tell you. Progressives are very keen to see how 
she intends to follow up.

Yesterday activists, including the Center for Popular Democracy Action, 
MoveOn.org, Public Citizen, theRootstrikers and others wrote to Clintonasking 
for details 
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/demandprogress/letters/clinton-transition-letter-20160810.pdf>
 of her “transition team” to see if they are the sort of people who are likely 
to follow through on her newly minted progressive values.

We can expect more scrutiny in the coming weeks.

Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump's tax plan is a massive 'Trump Loophole'

Speaking in Michigan, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> lambasts Donald Trump’s 
proposed tax cuts for the wealthy, including the elimination of the estate tax, 
calling them part of a “Trump Loophole” that offers millions in tax benefits to 
the rich while leaving the poor in the cold.

“There is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful 
because somehow he’s really on the side of the little guy. Don’t believe it,” 
Clinton says. “Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations 
accountable, when he wants to scrap regulations that prevent companies from 
polluting” air and water.

“Trump even wants to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new 
agency that has already returned more than $11b to 25 million Americans who 
were taken advantage of by corporations,” Clinton continues. “Why would you get 
rid of that?”

Trump’s tax plan, Clinton says, would “explode our national debt and 
eventually lead to massive cuts to priorities like healthcare, education and 
environmental protection.”

“He’d pay a lower rate than millions of middle-class families,” Clinton says 
of Trump’s tax plan. “It’s hard to say how nice [the deal would be], because he 
refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in decades and 
release his tax returns! But we do know that the 400 richest taxpayers in 
America would get an average tax cut of $15m a year through the Trump loophole.”

The elimination of the estate tax “alone would save the Trump family $4b. It 
would do nothing for 99.8% of Americans. So they’d get a $4b tax cut, and 99.8% 
of Americans would do nothing.”

That $4b could go a long way, Clinton suggests: “We could pay for more than 
47,000 vets to get a college degree - we could provide a year’s worth of 
healthcare for more than 3m kids! I think there are a lot of better ways to 
spend the money.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> launches 
into a section on free and fair trade, vowing to stand up to currency 
manipulators and theft of American intellectual property - before making a 
detour to talk about the Olympics as a metaphor for international economic 
competition.

“As president, I will stand up to China and anyone else who tries to take 
advantage of American workers and companies, and I’m going to ramp up 
enforcement by appointing, for the first time, a chief trade prosecutor,” 
Clinton says. “And when other companies break the rules, we won’t hesitate to 
impose targeted tariffs”

“Mr. Trump may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, 
not strength,” Clinton says. “Fear that our country has no choice but to hide 
behind walls. If Team USA was as fearful asDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, Michael Phelps and Simone 
Biles would be cowering in the locker room, afraid to come out and compete! 
Instead, they’re winning gold medals.”

It’s nice to hear Hillary Clinton talk about infrastructure - Donald Trump has 
mentioned it too - but the scale of the problem is massive. According to the 
American Society of Civil Engineers after years of neglect the USneeds to spend 
$3.6t <http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/executive-summary/> on its 
roads, ports, bridges, airports and other essential infrastructure by 2020 just 
to fix what’s broken or breaking.

Speaking in Warren, Michigan, on the outskirts of Detroit, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> announces that she will 
“dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses,” part of a line of 
argument that opponent Donald Trump does not care about small businesses, as 
evidenced by his history of not paying contractors.

“Right now, the smallest businesses - the kind that my dad had - spend twenty 
times more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to larger companies. It 
should be as easy as printing out a bank statement,” Clinton proposes.

“Now, Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has a 
different views - he’s made a career out of stiffing small business,” Clinton 
says. “There are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay 
their bills.”

“Some of them ended up taking bankruptcy. It wasn’t because Trump couldn’t pay 
them - it was because Trump wouldn’t pay them. And that’s why I take it 
personally.”

“I can’t imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he 
had gotten a contract from Trump,” Clinton says. “My father never could have 
sued a big organization like that! I just don’t understand it. I’ve met all 
kinds of workers... all of whom were denied payment and after going back time 
and again, being told ‘okay, maybe we’ll pay you 30 cents on the dollar, or 50 
cents on the dollar’ - that’s just not how we do business in America.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> tells 
the audience in Warren, Michigan, that she will push for reinvestment in 
American infrastructure that will include the largest injection of human 
capital into the workforce since World War II.

“We will put Americans to work building and modernizing our roads, our 
bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports,” Clinton says. “We 
are way overdue for this, my friends. We are living off the investments made by 
our parents’ and grandparents’ generations.”

“Let’s build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy 
to power every home in our country, as well,” Clinton continues. “Some country 
is going to be the clean-energy superpower of the 21st century and create 
millions of new jobs and businesses … I want it to be us. We invent the 
technology - we should make it, and use it, and export it!”

“A big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to 
create more jobs at higher pay and that means, for us, creating an 
infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and compliment” our 
infrastructure plans, Clinton says. “We’re going to invest $10b in … 
partnerships to support American manufacturing.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> casts 
the importance of the middle class in a personal light, telling the audience in 
Michigan that she is “a product of the American middle class.”

“My mission in the White House will be to make the economy work for everyone, 
not just the people at the top,” Clinton says. “This is personal for me - I am 
a product of the American middle class.”

Speaking of her grandfather, a factory worker at a plant that manufactured 
lace in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Clinton emphasizes the importance of the 
ability of workers to build wealth so that they and their families may advance 
economically.

“Because he worked hard, my dad was able to go to college and eventually start 
his own business, and eventually send me out into the world to start on my own 
dreams,” Clinton says.

“I am the daughter of a small business owner, and the granddaughter of a 
factory worker, and proud of both.”

Geno Auriemma, the US women’s basketball coach, isn’t going to start 
apologizing for his team being so good.

USA have been stung by some criticism that their dominant displays have been 
bad for the women’s good, but Auriemma pointed out that the US men’s team 
hasn’t been subjected to the same kind of scrutiny. A double standard?

Auriemma said: “We live in that Trumpian era where it’s OK to be sexist and 
degrade people that are good, just because they’re the opposite sex.

“We are what we are,” he said. “We’re never going to apologize for being that 
good. We’re never going to apologize for setting a standard that other people 
aspire to achieve. We got a guy in the pool with a USA swim cap on who nobody 
can beat. And if he wasn’t in swimming, there would be a lot of other guys with 
gold medals.

Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton is the ‘MVP’ of Isis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/11/trump-hillary-clinton-isis-mvp-video> 
Donald Trump, to pastors:

 Pray for me - I pray for you.

 
Donald Trump quadruples down on remarks he made last night in which he called 
President Barack Obamathe “founder of Isis” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-obama-founder-isis-most-valuable-player>
 at the American Renewal Project’s Pastors and Pews meeting, telling the 
audience three times that Obama and Hillary Clinton co-founded the terrorist 
network.

“Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: these are the founders of Isis. These are 
the founders of Isis, because of bad judgment. These are the founders of Isis,” 
Trump said, to a muted crowd.

“They get the most valuable player award - Isis is going to present them with 
the most valuable player award, like in high school. Most valuable player. You 
know, these are bad people, with bad judgment, and at the top we have an 
incompetent leader,” Trump says.

Trump’s remarks about Isis came while he is still dealing with backlash from 
his hint that gun rights supporters might attack Clinton, something thatseemed 
to cause genuine shock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment>
 in a country that has grown used to Trump pushing the boundaries of 
appropriate political discourse. On Thursday, Patti Davis, the daughter of late 
Republican former president Ronald Reagan, joined his critics to lambast him 
for what she called a “glib and horrifying comment”.
 
“I’m going to figure out a way to give you back your freedom of speech, that 
was taken away!”Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
says, of the revocation of tax-exemption for churches that engage in direct 
political action. “We’re gonna get your voice back - we’re gonna get it back.”

“This will be so great for religion, but it will be so great for the 
evangelicals, for the pastors, for the ministers, for America” Trump continues. 
“They took away your voice! They took away the voice of great people.”

“It’s not like they took away a bad voice, an evil voice - they took it away.”
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking at a 
Pastors and Pews meeting at the American Renewal Project, just told the room of 
pastors and ministers that he has decided to ditch his prepared remarks on the 
teleprompter because “it was boring.”

Saddle up, folks.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is speaking in 
Orlando at the American Renewal Project - watch it live here:
 
After sharp criticism for the creation of an economic advisory council 
composed of 13 white men - six of whom were named “Steve” - Donald Trump’s 
campaign has announced the addition ofnine more people to the council 
<https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/TRUMP_ECONOMIC_ADVISORY_COUNCIL_ADDITIONS_FINAL_round_two.pdf>
, eight of whom are women:

 * Diane Hendricks: Chair and owner of building products distributor ABC 
Supply Co., Inc. 
 * Darlene Jordan: Executive director of the Gerald R. Jordan Foundation, a 
nonprofit, and a former assistant attorney general for Massachusetts. 
 * Betsy McCaughey: A former New York lieutenant governor and anti-Obamacare 
advocate who popularized the “death panels” fraud. 
 * Brooke Rollins: CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a think tank. 
 * Anthony Scaramucci: A co-managing partner and founder of SkyBridge Capital, 
a global investment firm. 
 * Carla Sands: Chair of Vintage Capital Group, an investment firm. 
 * Judy Shelton: A former economic advisor for the National Commission on 
Economic Growth and Tax Reform. 
 * Liz Uihlein: Co-founder of Uline, Inc, a shipping and packaging company. 
 * Kathleen Hartnett White: Director of the Armstrong Center for Energy and 
the Environment at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. 
After Trump’s initial list was released, opponent Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> lambasted the council as 
showing Trump’s lack of emphasis on the economic struggles of women: “Well, so 
today in Detroit he’s got, oh, I don’t know, a dozen or so economic advisers he 
just named, hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, 
apparently.”

In closing, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> dismisses the threadbare 
economic plan proposed by opponent Donald Trump as “just a more extreme version 
of the failed theory of trickle-down economics” with the inclusion of 
“outlandish Trumpian ideas” rejected even by his own supporters in the 
Republican party.

At the heart of the matter, Clinton says, is an ability to get economic 
proposals through Congress in the first place.

“Who can bring people together to get any of this done?” Clinton asks the 
audience about her economic plan, before emphasizing her belief in “leadership 
that rises above personal attacks and name calling, not revels in it. I just 
don’t think insults and bullying are going to get things done.”

“There was a time and Republicans actually worked together - I know that’s 
true, I did it as first lady, senator and secretary of state!” Clinton says. 
“We’re gonna get everyone at the table, not justRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> and Democrats, but businesses 
and labor unions and experts - and most importantly Americans, like all of you! 
I think there are a lot of great ideas out in America, and I want you to have a 
say about your government.”

“The bottom line is this,” Clinton concludes. “I’m running for president to 
build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top , and based 
on what we know about the Trump campaign, he wants America to work for him and 
his wealthy friends.”

Trump’s economic plan doesn’t address things like racial inequality, the 
rising cost of healthcare and prescriptions or the importance of clean energy, 
Clinton says: It’s “just a more extreme version of the failed theory of 
trickle-down economics, with his own addition of outlandish Trumpian ideas that 
even Republicans reject! And as we heard him say at his convention, he may 
believe that he alone can fix our country, but clearly he doesn’t know the 
people of Michigan.”

“There is still a long road ahead, but Michigan is on the rise, and everyone 
is contributing.”
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is a 
relatively new Wall Street skeptic, as anyone who has attended one of her 
high-paying bank speeches will tell you. Progressives are very keen to see how 
she intends to follow up.

Yesterday activists, including the Center for Popular Democracy Action, 
MoveOn.org, Public Citizen, theRootstrikers and others wrote to Clintonasking 
for details 
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/demandprogress/letters/clinton-transition-letter-20160810.pdf>
 of her “transition team” to see if they are the sort of people who are likely 
to follow through on her newly minted progressive values.

We can expect more scrutiny in the coming weeks.
 
Speaking in Michigan, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> lambasts Donald Trump’s 
proposed tax cuts for the wealthy, including the elimination of the estate tax, 
calling them part of a “Trump Loophole” that offers millions in tax benefits to 
the rich while leaving the poor in the cold.

“There is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful 
because somehow he’s really on the side of the little guy. Don’t believe it,” 
Clinton says. “Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations 
accountable, when he wants to scrap regulations that prevent companies from 
polluting” air and water.

“Trump even wants to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new 
agency that has already returned more than $11b to 25 million Americans who 
were taken advantage of by corporations,” Clinton continues. “Why would you get 
rid of that?”

Trump’s tax plan, Clinton says, would “explode our national debt and 
eventually lead to massive cuts to priorities like healthcare, education and 
environmental protection.”

“He’d pay a lower rate than millions of middle-class families,” Clinton says 
of Trump’s tax plan. “It’s hard to say how nice [the deal would be], because he 
refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in decades and 
release his tax returns! But we do know that the 400 richest taxpayers in 
America would get an average tax cut of $15m a year through the Trump loophole.”

The elimination of the estate tax “alone would save the Trump family $4b. It 
would do nothing for 99.8% of Americans. So they’d get a $4b tax cut, and 99.8% 
of Americans would do nothing.”

That $4b could go a long way, Clinton suggests: “We could pay for more than 
47,000 vets to get a college degree - we could provide a year’s worth of 
healthcare for more than 3m kids! I think there are a lot of better ways to 
spend the money.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> launches 
into a section on free and fair trade, vowing to stand up to currency 
manipulators and theft of American intellectual property - before making a 
detour to talk about the Olympics as a metaphor for international economic 
competition.

“As president, I will stand up to China and anyone else who tries to take 
advantage of American workers and companies, and I’m going to ramp up 
enforcement by appointing, for the first time, a chief trade prosecutor,” 
Clinton says. “And when other companies break the rules, we won’t hesitate to 
impose targeted tariffs”

“Mr. Trump may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, 
not strength,” Clinton says. “Fear that our country has no choice but to hide 
behind walls. If Team USA was as fearful asDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, Michael Phelps and Simone 
Biles would be cowering in the locker room, afraid to come out and compete! 
Instead, they’re winning gold medals.”
 
It’s nice to hear Hillary Clinton talk about infrastructure - Donald Trump has 
mentioned it too - but the scale of the problem is massive. According to the 
American Society of Civil Engineers after years of neglect the USneeds to spend 
$3.6t <http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/executive-summary/> on its 
roads, ports, bridges, airports and other essential infrastructure by 2020 just 
to fix what’s broken or breaking.
 
Speaking in Warren, Michigan, on the outskirts of Detroit, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> announces that she will 
“dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses,” part of a line of 
argument that opponent Donald Trump does not care about small businesses, as 
evidenced by his history of not paying contractors.

“Right now, the smallest businesses - the kind that my dad had - spend twenty 
times more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to larger companies. It 
should be as easy as printing out a bank statement,” Clinton proposes.

“Now, Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has a 
different views - he’s made a career out of stiffing small business,” Clinton 
says. “There are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay 
their bills.”

“Some of them ended up taking bankruptcy. It wasn’t because Trump couldn’t pay 
them - it was because Trump wouldn’t pay them. And that’s why I take it 
personally.”

“I can’t imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he 
had gotten a contract from Trump,” Clinton says. “My father never could have 
sued a big organization like that! I just don’t understand it. I’ve met all 
kinds of workers... all of whom were denied payment and after going back time 
and again, being told ‘okay, maybe we’ll pay you 30 cents on the dollar, or 50 
cents on the dollar’ - that’s just not how we do business in America.”
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> tells 
the audience in Warren, Michigan, that she will push for reinvestment in 
American infrastructure that will include the largest injection of human 
capital into the workforce since World War II.

“We will put Americans to work building and modernizing our roads, our 
bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports,” Clinton says. “We 
are way overdue for this, my friends. We are living off the investments made by 
our parents’ and grandparents’ generations.”

“Let’s build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy 
to power every home in our country, as well,” Clinton continues. “Some country 
is going to be the clean-energy superpower of the 21st century and create 
millions of new jobs and businesses … I want it to be us. We invent the 
technology - we should make it, and use it, and export it!”

“A big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to 
create more jobs at higher pay and that means, for us, creating an 
infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and compliment” our 
infrastructure plans, Clinton says. “We’re going to invest $10b in … 
partnerships to support American manufacturing.”
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> casts 
the importance of the middle class in a personal light, telling the audience in 
Michigan that she is “a product of the American middle class.”

“My mission in the White House will be to make the economy work for everyone, 
not just the people at the top,” Clinton says. “This is personal for me - I am 
a product of the American middle class.”

Speaking of her grandfather, a factory worker at a plant that manufactured 
lace in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Clinton emphasizes the importance of the 
ability of workers to build wealth so that they and their families may advance 
economically.

“Because he worked hard, my dad was able to go to college and eventually start 
his own business, and eventually send me out into the world to start on my own 
dreams,” Clinton says.

“I am the daughter of a small business owner, and the granddaughter of a 
factory worker, and proud of both.”
