Jumping from one persona to another is second nature to an actor. But what 
happens if you are simultaneously playing two parts: one the most unscrupulous, 
lascivious woman on television; the other, the best-behaved and most cruelly 
put-upon?

Tuppence Middleton, star of both War and Peace and Dickensian, appears on 
British television screens this winter in two entirely different guises. She 
plays the manipulative seductress Hélène Kuragin in the BBC 1 adaptation of 
Tolstoy’s Russian epic

and is also to be seen on the same channel as the guileless Amelia Havisham, 
victim of an evil fortune hunter, inscreenwriter Tony Jordan’s episodic 
Victorian series

.

“Even though they are both period dramas, they are so different in their 
nature and in the nature of the characters I am playing,” she said, explaining 
she had not known they would be broadcast at the same time. “Miss Havisham, I 
suppose, is quite repressed and contained, while Hélène is very liberated, 
seductive and manipulative. It was really appealing that they were so 
different.”

Andrew Davies, who adapted War and Peace, has said Middleton’s Hélène is “the 
naughtiest woman on TV at the moment”, yet inDickensian she is also arguably 
the most vulnerable woman on TV. The high-profile roles have propelled 
Middleton, 29 next month, into the first rank of new British acting talent, 
particularly since viewing figures forWar and Peace have grown in America.

But the actress has a cautious approach to impending stardom. She was 
grateful, she said, for having learned her craft quietly in her 20s and does 
not know how her talented younger co-stars inDickensian, Joseph Quinn, who 
plays her brother Arthur, and Ben Starr, who plays Captain Hawdon, have handled 
the pressure of tackling their first professional roles. “Joe is only 21. I 
don’t know how I would have coped at that age. When I went to drama school at 
18 I wanted to do everything straightaway, but as I have got older I realise 
that helps me to imagine what a character is dealing with.”

The contrasting parts of Hélène and the young Miss Havisham, she said, have 
also offered her the luxury of building up a character slowly.

“I started off doing film in my first few years but I am thankful to 
television because you have a longer stretch to develop a character, even in a 
supporting role, than in a film, where you might have perhaps just five scenes. 
In these two television shows you have such a big story arc to follow, it is a 
gift.”

Middleton grew up in Clevedon, near Bristol, and was named “Tuppence” after 
her mother’s childhood nickname. So far this month she has managed to avoid 
recognition off screen thanks to another TV role that demands peroxide blonde 
hair. She is filming the second series ofSense8, a Netflix series written by 
Andy and Lana Wachowski and J Michael Straczynski, in which she plays Riley 
Blue, an Icelandic DJ. Despite her change of hair colour, photographers tracked 
her down earlier this month at an event with her new boyfriend, Robert Fry, 35, 
an abstract painter.

There is no comparison to being in Russia and feeling that sense of culture 
that they have there

Middleton believes in research and so re-read Great Expectations before making 
Dickensian and completed War and Peace before travelling to Lithuania, Latvia 
and Russia for filming. She had already read a third of Tolstoy’s great work 
for pleasure three years ago and then finished it off over four days in a hotel 
in Brussels once she knew she had the part.

“With Miss Havisham I also have the resource of Great Expectations, although 
my character is obviously a different age,” she said.

Her executive producer on Dickensian, Belinda Campbell, is impressed by her 
“clever and subtle” portrayal. “While Tuppence’s Miss Havisham is a million 
miles away from the vengeful woman of the novel, it is possible to see in her 
nuanced portrayal the elements which might lead to the character she becomes,” 
she said this weekend.

Middleton auditioned for Dickensian in a break from filming War and Peace and 
knew she must be bold.

“Everyone reads the same words in a book, but has a very clear picture of 
their own. We see what happens to Miss Havisham to make her end up that way, 
but she is essentially a normal young woman of the times from a wealthy family.”

Costume has been important in finding both characters, Middleton said. “It 
helps transport you into that world when you are in costume and on the set of
Dickensian it was completely immersive. It is much harder on a real street that 
has been blocked off and you can see the cars behind.”

The experience of working in Russia has also clearly left a big mark.

“There is no comparison to being there in Russia and feeling that sense of 
culture that they have there. I always really loved Russian literature and I 
think Tolstoy’s writing is full of a sense of melancholy and humanity, so it 
seems really modern.”
