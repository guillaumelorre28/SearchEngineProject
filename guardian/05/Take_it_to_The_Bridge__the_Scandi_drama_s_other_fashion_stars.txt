SPOILER ALERT: Spoiler ahead if you haven’t seen episode five, series three, of
The Bridge <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-bridge> 

As fans of dimly lit Scandi menace will know, Saga Norén’s leather trousers 
are the most important piece of clothing on TV at the moment,with her military 
coat coming a close second 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/20/get-sagas-coat-the-bridge-buy-of-the-day>
. But as brilliant as Saga’s look is –Withnail & I 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/withnail-i> meets Captain Jack Sparrow – it 
should not overshadow the other fashion stars of The Bridge, who deserve to be 
recognised for their own services to cold-weather style. To wit:

Strongest outerwear: Lillian

With more than a touch of Charlotte Rampling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlotte-rampling>, police chief Lillian is 
never not glamorous, although in series three she has really come into her own. 
It’s all about the outerwear, which has been upgraded from the furry collars 
and fluffy scarves of earlier series (some of which looked a little as if they 
could be from the miscellaneous January sales bucket at Next). Now she’sdouble 
coating 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2015/jan/23/double-coating-how-layering-went-20>
 – a catwalk trend adopted by many a fashion editor, who style it exactly as 
Lillian does: a slim Uniqlo gilet worn under a smart overcoat.

Most resigned accessory: John

You’ve got to feel for John. Every day he tackles a litany of mind-numbing, 
time-consuming demands from Saga, his efforts rarely met with as much as atack. 
His commitment to glasses on a string – the ultimate administrator’s accessory 
– is laden with meaning, suggesting he has made peace with his desk job and is 
actually quite happy not to be the one breaking into houses on the hunt for a 
psychopath.

Best maternity chic: Jeanette

For someone playing the genuinely pregnant half of a secret surrogate swap, 
Jeanette’s gargantuan bump looks remarkably prosthetic – and she doesn’t seem 
to be suffering from swollen ankles or water retention, either. Still, she 
remains the last word in refreshingly scruffy, tough, maternity chic: 
cross-body bags layered over longline jumpers – veryJustin Bieber does Kanye

Services to facial hair: Henrik

Saga’s new partner is quadruple coating, here, and making it look smart and 
sleek – and not at all likethat episode of Friends where Joey wears all of 
Chandler’s clothes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxCY0KsCCLI> – which is the 
epitome of masterful layering. It’s his Guy Fawkes facial hair that steals the 
show, however, finally offering a compelling alternative to themuch-maligned 
hipster beard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2015/sep/21/hipster-beards-historian-dr-alun-withey-clean-shaven-urban-creatives>
