1 The xx

The xx stop off at Brixton Academy, SW9, for seven dates in March, but don’t 
be dismayed, this isn’t a new lazy approach to touring; they’re heading off 
around the country, too, in support of new album I See You.

4-17 Mar, tour starts Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham <http://thexx.info/tour/>

2 Drake

Seven nights in Brixton, you say? Drake is doing eight at the O2 Arena, SE10, 
and taking his soulful solipsism around the UK as well. Can anyone better this?

25 Jan-23 Feb, tour starts The SSE Hydro, Glasgow

 Tegan and Sara 
Sadly, Tegan And Sara won’t be doing nine nights from the international space 
station, but they will be performing their emotionally fraught electropop 
during a February tour.

13-19 Feb, tour starts Roundhouse, NW1 <http://teganandsara.com/shows/>

4 Aphex Twin

They’re building a whopping new arena at Field Day to accommodate the 
electronic auteur’s first UK show in half a decade; you can be sure he’ll do 
his best to demolish it.

Field Day, Victoria Park, E3, 3 Jun <http://fielddayfestivals.com/news/>

Can the music of the Smiths withstand a Mexican makeover? It certainly can if 
past Mexrrissey shows are anything to go by. Expect mariachi horns, accordion 
and bajo sexto to brighten up the miserablist classics.

25-29 Jan, tour starts O2 ABC Glasgow <http://www.mexrrissey.com/splash/>

6 AR Rahman 

Dubbed the “Mozart of Madras”, the Indian composer behind Slumdog 
Millionaire’s soundtrack will be bringing Bollywood to the UK’s arenas.

24-Mar, tour starts The SSE Arena, Wembley

7 Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks

Phil Collins and Justin Bieber are also doing Hyde Park gigs as part of the 
2017 British Summer Time series, but the lineup of Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty 
steals the show.

Hyde Park, W2, 9 Jul

 Frank Ocean. 
As festival bookings go this is some scoop: the man behind 2017’s best album 
(according to several polls and, more importantly, me) will be headlining the 
first night of London’s Lovebox festival in July.

9 The Weeknd

Abel Tesfaye used to suffer from stage fright; nowadays he admits to being 
addicted to playing live. Help him feed his habit when he hits the UK.

5-14 Mar, tour starts Manchester Arena <https://www.theweeknd.com/tour>

10 The Maccabees

Wave goodbye to the indie charmers at their huge final gigs in June; tickets
