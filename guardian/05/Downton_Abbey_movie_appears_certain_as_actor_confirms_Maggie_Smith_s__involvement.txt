The long-rumoured movie version of hit show Downton Abbey looks ever more 
likely as one of the actors has appeared to confirm the involvement ofMaggie 
Smith

 in such a project.

Smith, 81 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/26/maggie-smith-downton-abbey-dowager-career-profile>
, who won an Emmy for her performance as Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham 
in the show, had previously been sceptical about the endeavour, saying a year 
ago she feared her character’s advancing years ruled her out of such an 
appearance.

Asked if she would appear in any film, Smith told Graham Norton: “I can’t – 
what age would she be? By the time we finished, she must have been about 110. 
It couldn’t go on and on, it just didn’t make sense.”

But at a Bafta event in Los Angeles over the weekend, Michael Fox, who plays 
friendly valet Andy Parker on the show, said that Smith signing on meant the 
film would not only proceed – but be the better for it.

“The film without her would still be good with all the other actors,” he was 
quoted by MailOnline, “but it puts a stamp of quality with her in it.”

At the same event, show creator and writer Julian Fellowes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/31/julian-fellowes-this-much-i-know>
 expressed enthusiasm about the prospect.

“I think it will be fun to get everyone together,” he said, “and move it to a 
larger scale because you have got more money to spend.”

Speaking to Good Morning Britain following the victory on Sunday, Fellowes 
reiterated his commitment. “I would love to make [a Downtown movie],” he said. 
“As far as I am concerned, I am completely up for it. Most of the cast are up 
for it.”
