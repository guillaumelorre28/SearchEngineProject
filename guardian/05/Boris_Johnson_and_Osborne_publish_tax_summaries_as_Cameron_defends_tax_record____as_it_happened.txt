Afternoon summary

 * David Cameron has used a Commons statement to attempt to close down the 
controversy about his family finances and his involvement in an offshore fund. 
He told MPs that he accepted his handling of his issue last week had been 
flawed, but he claimed that his decision at the weekend to publish information 
from his tax returns for the last six years was “unprecedented”. He spoke about 
his finances in some detail but sidestepped certain questions - most notably 
one from Jeremy Corbyn about whether any of the shares worth £70,000 sold by 
Cameron in 2010 (in addition to the Blairmore Holdings shares) were held 
offshore. Number 10 has refused to say they confirm they were onshore. (See 
12.49pm.)

Jeremy Corbyn gave a spirited response accusing Cameron of failing to address 
wider issues of inequality, but Cameron received strong support from his MPs 
and by the end it looked as if he had pulled off a reasonably competent damage 
limitation exercise. 
 * Cameron told MPs that, although he was calling for prime ministers, 
chancellors and their official opposition counterparts to publish their tax 
information, he did not believe it was right to enforce transparency on MPs or 
public figures more generally. 
I think there is a strong case for the prime minister and the leader of the 
opposition, and for the chancellor and shadow chancellor, because they are 
people who are or who wish to be responsible for the nation’s finances. As for 
MPs, we already have robust rules on members’ interests and their declaration 
and I believe that is the model we should continue to follow.

We should think carefully before abandoning completely all taxpayer 
confidentiality in this House as some have suggested. If this were to come in 
for MPs, people would also ask for a similar approach for those who ask us 
questions, those who run large public services, or lead local government, or 
indeed those who edit the news programmes or newspapers. I think this would be 
a very big step for our country, it certainly shouldn’t take place without a 
long and thoughtful debate and it is not the approach that I would recommend.

 * Cameron said the allegations about his late father having been engaged in 
tax avoidance were “deeply hurtful and profoundly untrue”.He said he was proud 
of his father: 
I know he was a hard-working man and a wonderful dad and I’m proud of 
everything he did to build a business and provide for his family.

 * He said organisations like the BBC and the Guardian have money invested 
offshore in funds like the one set up by his father.Describing Blairmore 
Holdings, he said: 
This investment fund was set up overseas in the first place because it was 
going to be trading predominantly in dollar securities. So like very many other 
commercial investment funds it made sense to be set up inside one of the main 
centres of dollar trading.

There are thousands of these investment funds, and many millions of people in 
Britain who own shares, many of whom hold them through investment funds or unit 
trusts. Such funds, including those listed outside the UK, are included in the 
pension funds of local government, most of Britain’s largest companies, and 
indeed even some trade unions. Even a quick look shows that the BBC, the Mirror 
Group, Guardian Newspapers, and to pick one council entirely at random - 
Islington - all have these sorts of overseas investments. This is an entirely 
standard practice and it is not to avoid tax.

 * He said did not respond to the allegations about his investments earlier 
because he was angry about what was being said about his father. 
I accept all of the criticisms for not responding more quickly to these issues 
last week but as I said I was angry about the way my father’s memory was being 
traduced.

 * Corbyn said Cameron did not appreciate how angry members of the public were 
about tax avoidance. Responding to Cameron, Corbyn said: 
May I thank you for the advance sight of your statement, it is absolutely a 
masterclass in the art of distraction.

I’m sure you will join me in welcoming the outstanding journalism that has 
gone into exposing the scandal of destructive global tax avoidance revealed by 
the Panama Papers.

What they have driven home is what many people have increasingly felt - there 
is now one rule for the super-rich and another for the rest.

I’m honestly not sure that you fully appreciate the anger that is out there 
over this injustice.

Corbyn also published his own tax return. Labour confirmed he paid a £100 fine 
because he submitted it late.

 * The Labour MP Dennis Skinner was suspended from the chamber for calling 
Cameron “dodgy Dave”.He asked Cameron: 
Does the prime minister recall that at the time after he became prime minister 
under the coalition and at the time when he was dividing the nation between 
strivers and scroungers, I asked him a very important question about the 
windfall he received when he wrote off the mortgage of the premises in Notting 
Hill, and I said to him he didn’t write off the mortgage of the one taxpayers 
were helping to pay for at Oxford. I didn’t receive a proper answer then. Maybe 
dodgy Dave will answer it now.

John Bercow, the Speaker, asked Skinner to withdraw the word “dodgy” (it is 
against parliamentary rules to use an insult like that in the chamber) and he 
suspended Skinner for the rest of the day when Skinner refused. Cameron never 
answered the question.

 * George Osborne has released a summary of his tax return for last year 
showing he earned almost £200,000 by topping up his chancellor’s salary with 
rental income and dividends from his family’s wallpaper firm. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/11/george-osborne-tax-return-reveals-198000-income>
 * Sir Alan Duncan, the Conservative former minister and former oil trader, 
said the Commons could end up being “stuffed full of low-achievers” if MPs had 
to publish their tax returns.He asked Cameron: 
Shouldn’t the prime minister’s critics really just snap out of the synthetic 
indignation and admit that their real point is that they hate anyone who has 
got a hint of wealth in them? May I support the prime minister in fending off 
those who are attacking him, particularly in thinking of this place, because if 
he doesn’t, we risk seeing a House of Commons which is stuffed full of 
low-achievers who hate enterprise, hate people who look after their own family 
and know absolutely nothing about the outside world.

Cameron said he did not want to discourage people with a successful careers 
from becoming MPs.

UPDATE: Duncan has just issued a clarification on Twitter.
Alan Duncan (@AlanDuncanMP) 
Seems I could have been a little clearer in Parliament today. Success is of 
course not always the same as wealth (1/2)

from entering Parliament by sniping at wealth per se (2/2)

 * Cameron effectively withdrew his criticism of the comedian Jimmy Carr over 
his involvement with a tax avoidance scheme.Four years ago Cameron said what 
Carr was doing was “morally wrong”. Today he said: 
What I’ve said before, and I’m very happy to say again, is there are some 
practices of very aggressive tax avoidance that I think do merit proper 
questions and then legislative action. And to be fair to Jimmy Carr, as soon as 
it was pointed out that he was in a scheme to artificially reduce his income he 
immediately changed his arrangements. He made that very clear and I pay tribute 
to him for doing that.

 * Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has told MPs the government could 
“co-invest” with a commercial buyer to support the Port Talbot steelworks. Jim 
Pickard (@PickardJE) 
Big news: Sajid Javid confirms possibility of "co-investing with a buyer on 
commercial terms" at Port Talbot.

 * Ministers have been defeated twice in the House of Lords on the housing 
bill.As the Press Association reports, peers backed an amendment requiring 
repayment of the 20% discount for starter homes on a sliding scale if sold 
during the first 20 years. Voting was 275 to 181, a majority of 94, for the 
amendment tabled by independent crossbencher Lord Best with opposition support. 
And the government was defeated again over the starter home policy when peers 
backed a move to let local authorities decide on the proportion of such homes 
in new developments. Voting was 280 to 194, a majority of 86. 
That’s all for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, said David Cameron’s measures 
to crack down on tax havens did not go far enough. He said:

It is estimated that between 21 and 32 trillion dollars of private financial 
wealth is located, untaxed or lightly taxed, in tax havens around the world.

Illicit cross-border financial flows are estimated at more than £1 trillion 
dollars per year, ten times more than global foreign aid budgets combined. The 
Panama Papers leak is so large that if one printed the file the final document 
would be 650m pages long.


It is right that a special task force has been set up to go through the 
information that has been leaked. Hopefully charges will follow if criminality 
can be proven.


The public are indignant here and around the world. People are rightly angered 
by the different rules for normal tax-payers and a small ultra-rich elite.


But we must ask ourselves whether the scale of the problem has been taken 
seriously, because quite patently it has not been thus far domestically and 
internationally. The UK bears a particular responsibility given that the UK and 
its overseas territories collectively sit at the top of the Financial Secrecy 
Index of theTax <https://www.theguardian.com/money/tax> Justice Network.



In the Commons Robertson responded to Cameron after Andrew Tyrie, but I did 
not include his comments earlier because I was looking at Corbyn’s tax return.

The David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
statement has just finished. I will post a summary of the key points soon.

Number 10 have not released the full text of what Cameron said yet, but they 
have issued a news release about the plans to create a criminal offence for 
corporations who fail to stop their staff facilitating tax evasion.

Cameron says his mother is developing “a thicker skin” with every week that

He says we should be encouraging people to leave assets to their children, not 
discouraging this.

Robert Jenrick, a Conservative, says he has gone back through Hansard over the 
13 years while Labour was in power and he cannot find any reference toJeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> complaining about 
tax havens. He says the only relevant reference he found was Corbyn saying the 
plan to use orders in council to take control of the Turks and Caicos Islands 
in 2009 was “medieval” and “extreme”. But Corbyn is now proposing that for tax 
havens, he says.

Cameron jokes that Corbyn has now found a use of nuclear submarines; he can 
send them to subjugate the Isle of Mann.

Labour’s Caroline Flint says she was disappointed to hear Sir Alan Duncan 
suggests that people who were not wealthy were low-achiever. (See 4.17pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/11/cameron-tax-commons-statement-offshore-tax-osborne-likely-to-publish-tax-return-details-treasury-hints-politics-live?page=with:block-570bbff4e4b0c3a2a706b031#block-570bbff4e4b0c3a2a706b031>
As a low-achiever, she says, she wants to ask Cameron if he will support moves 
to force companies to publish details of their tax returns.

Cameron says he has always thought of Flint as a high-achiever. She “put the 
boot in” to his predecessor (Gordon Brown) more successfully than he did, he 
says.

He says the government is working to get multinationals to pay more in tax. 
Flint’s idea is an interesting one, but he says he does not want to make the 
best the enemy of the good.

Labour’s Wes Streeting asks if Cameron regrets saying in 2013 that crown 
dependencies and overseas territories should not be called tax havens.

Cameron says that he made that statement in 2013 after those governments 
agreed to share some tax information with the UK.

He says the last Labour government was content to let these places carry on 
acting as they wanted.

Labour’s John Mann asks if it is appropriate to claim expense to live in a 
grace and favour apartment while making money from renting out a home.

Cameron says a member of his family went to the parliamentary commissioner for 
standards’ office today to respond to Mann’s complaint, but found Mann had not 
submitted it yet.

He says Mann has misunderstood the arrangement. Living in Downing Street 
counts as a benefit in kind, he says. He says he has to pay tax because that’s 
a taxable benefit.

 * David Cameron has used a Commons statement to attempt to close down the 
controversy about his family finances and his involvement in an offshore fund. 
He told MPs that he accepted his handling of his issue last week had been 
flawed, but he claimed that his decision at the weekend to publish information 
from his tax returns for the last six years was “unprecedented”. He spoke about 
his finances in some detail but sidestepped certain questions - most notably 
one from Jeremy Corbyn about whether any of the shares worth £70,000 sold by 
Cameron in 2010 (in addition to the Blairmore Holdings shares) were held 
offshore. Number 10 has refused to say they confirm they were onshore. (See 
12.49pm.)

Jeremy Corbyn gave a spirited response accusing Cameron of failing to address 
wider issues of inequality, but Cameron received strong support from his MPs 
and by the end it looked as if he had pulled off a reasonably competent damage 
limitation exercise. 
 * Cameron told MPs that, although he was calling for prime ministers, 
chancellors and their official opposition counterparts to publish their tax 
information, he did not believe it was right to enforce transparency on MPs or 
public figures more generally. 
I think there is a strong case for the prime minister and the leader of the 
opposition, and for the chancellor and shadow chancellor, because they are 
people who are or who wish to be responsible for the nation’s finances. As for 
MPs, we already have robust rules on members’ interests and their declaration 
and I believe that is the model we should continue to follow.

We should think carefully before abandoning completely all taxpayer 
confidentiality in this House as some have suggested. If this were to come in 
for MPs, people would also ask for a similar approach for those who ask us 
questions, those who run large public services, or lead local government, or 
indeed those who edit the news programmes or newspapers. I think this would be 
a very big step for our country, it certainly shouldn’t take place without a 
long and thoughtful debate and it is not the approach that I would recommend.

 * Cameron said the allegations about his late father having been engaged in 
tax avoidance were “deeply hurtful and profoundly untrue”.He said he was proud 
of his father: 
I know he was a hard-working man and a wonderful dad and I’m proud of 
everything he did to build a business and provide for his family.

 * He said organisations like the BBC and the Guardian have money invested 
offshore in funds like the one set up by his father.Describing Blairmore 
Holdings, he said: 
This investment fund was set up overseas in the first place because it was 
going to be trading predominantly in dollar securities. So like very many other 
commercial investment funds it made sense to be set up inside one of the main 
centres of dollar trading.

There are thousands of these investment funds, and many millions of people in 
Britain who own shares, many of whom hold them through investment funds or unit 
trusts. Such funds, including those listed outside the UK, are included in the 
pension funds of local government, most of Britain’s largest companies, and 
indeed even some trade unions. Even a quick look shows that the BBC, the Mirror 
Group, Guardian Newspapers, and to pick one council entirely at random - 
Islington - all have these sorts of overseas investments. This is an entirely 
standard practice and it is not to avoid tax.

 * He said did not respond to the allegations about his investments earlier 
because he was angry about what was being said about his father. 
I accept all of the criticisms for not responding more quickly to these issues 
last week but as I said I was angry about the way my father’s memory was being 
traduced.

 * Corbyn said Cameron did not appreciate how angry members of the public were 
about tax avoidance. Responding to Cameron, Corbyn said: 
May I thank you for the advance sight of your statement, it is absolutely a 
masterclass in the art of distraction.

I’m sure you will join me in welcoming the outstanding journalism that has 
gone into exposing the scandal of destructive global tax avoidance revealed by 
the Panama Papers.

What they have driven home is what many people have increasingly felt - there 
is now one rule for the super-rich and another for the rest.

I’m honestly not sure that you fully appreciate the anger that is out there 
over this injustice.

Corbyn also published his own tax return. Labour confirmed he paid a £100 fine 
because he submitted it late.

 * The Labour MP Dennis Skinner was suspended from the chamber for calling 
Cameron “dodgy Dave”.He asked Cameron: 
Does the prime minister recall that at the time after he became prime minister 
under the coalition and at the time when he was dividing the nation between 
strivers and scroungers, I asked him a very important question about the 
windfall he received when he wrote off the mortgage of the premises in Notting 
Hill, and I said to him he didn’t write off the mortgage of the one taxpayers 
were helping to pay for at Oxford. I didn’t receive a proper answer then. Maybe 
dodgy Dave will answer it now.

John Bercow, the Speaker, asked Skinner to withdraw the word “dodgy” (it is 
against parliamentary rules to use an insult like that in the chamber) and he 
suspended Skinner for the rest of the day when Skinner refused. Cameron never 
answered the question.

 * George Osborne has released a summary of his tax return for last year 
showing he earned almost £200,000 by topping up his chancellor’s salary with 
rental income and dividends from his family’s wallpaper firm. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/11/george-osborne-tax-return-reveals-198000-income>
 * Sir Alan Duncan, the Conservative former minister and former oil trader, 
said the Commons could end up being “stuffed full of low-achievers” if MPs had 
to publish their tax returns.He asked Cameron: 
Shouldn’t the prime minister’s critics really just snap out of the synthetic 
indignation and admit that their real point is that they hate anyone who has 
got a hint of wealth in them? May I support the prime minister in fending off 
those who are attacking him, particularly in thinking of this place, because if 
he doesn’t, we risk seeing a House of Commons which is stuffed full of 
low-achievers who hate enterprise, hate people who look after their own family 
and know absolutely nothing about the outside world.

Cameron said he did not want to discourage people with a successful careers 
from becoming MPs.

UPDATE: Duncan has just issued a clarification on Twitter.

Seems I could have been a little clearer in Parliament today. Success is of 
course not always the same as wealth (1/2)

 * Cameron effectively withdrew his criticism of the comedian Jimmy Carr over 
his involvement with a tax avoidance scheme.Four years ago Cameron said what 
Carr was doing was “morally wrong”. Today he said: 
What I’ve said before, and I’m very happy to say again, is there are some 
practices of very aggressive tax avoidance that I think do merit proper 
questions and then legislative action. And to be fair to Jimmy Carr, as soon as 
it was pointed out that he was in a scheme to artificially reduce his income he 
immediately changed his arrangements. He made that very clear and I pay tribute 
to him for doing that.

 * Ministers have been defeated twice in the House of Lords on the housing 
bill.As the Press Association reports, peers backed an amendment requiring 
repayment of the 20% discount for starter homes on a sliding scale if sold 
during the first 20 years. Voting was 275 to 181, a majority of 94, for the 
amendment tabled by independent crossbencher Lord Best with opposition support. 
And the government was defeated again over the starter home policy when peers 
backed a move to let local authorities decide on the proportion of such homes 
in new developments. Voting was 280 to 194, a majority of 86. 
That’s all for today.

Thanks for the comments. 

 
Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, said David Cameron’s measures 
to crack down on tax havens did not go far enough. He said:

It is estimated that between 21 and 32 trillion dollars of private financial 
wealth is located, untaxed or lightly taxed, in tax havens around the world.

Illicit cross-border financial flows are estimated at more than £1 trillion 
dollars per year, ten times more than global foreign aid budgets combined. The 
Panama Papers leak is so large that if one printed the file the final document 
would be 650m pages long.


It is right that a special task force has been set up to go through the 
information that has been leaked. Hopefully charges will follow if criminality 
can be proven.


The public are indignant here and around the world. People are rightly angered 
by the different rules for normal tax-payers and a small ultra-rich elite.


But we must ask ourselves whether the scale of the problem has been taken 
seriously, because quite patently it has not been thus far domestically and 
internationally. The UK bears a particular responsibility given that the UK and 
its overseas territories collectively sit at the top of the Financial Secrecy 
Index of theTax <https://www.theguardian.com/money/tax> Justice Network.



In the Commons Robertson responded to Cameron after Andrew Tyrie, but I did 
not include his comments earlier because I was looking at Corbyn’s tax return.

Here is my colleague Gaby Hinsliff’s assessment of the statement.

Tax <https://www.theguardian.com/money/tax> debate summary: Cameron cheerily 
unruffled, Dennis Skinner soon to be a meme, Alan Duncan possibly ditto. World 
entirely unchanged.

The David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
statement has just finished. I will post a summary of the key points soon.

Number 10 have not released the full text of what Cameron said yet, but they 
have issued a news release about the plans to create a criminal offence for 
corporations who fail to stop their staff facilitating tax evasion.

Cameron says his mother is developing “a thicker skin” with every week that 
passes.

He says we should be encouraging people to leave assets to their children, not 
discouraging this.
 
Asked about today’s Guardian splash saying Edward Troup, the head of HM 
Revenue and Customs who is overseeing the Panama Papers investigation, used to 
be a partner at Simmons & Simmons, the firm that acted for Blairmore Holdings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/10/hmrc-chief-partner-law-firm-offshore-fund-cameron>
, Cameron says Troup had a distinguished career in the private sector and that 
the fact that the public sector attracts people of this calibre is a good thing.
 
Robert Jenrick, a Conservative, says he has gone back through Hansard over the 
13 years while Labour was in power and he cannot find any reference toJeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> complaining about 
tax havens. He says the only relevant reference he found was Corbyn saying the 
plan to use orders in council to take control of the Turks and Caicos Islands 
in 2009 was “medieval” and “extreme”. But Corbyn is now proposing that for tax 
havens, he says.

Cameron jokes that Corbyn has now found a use of nuclear submarines; he can 
send them to subjugate the Isle of Mann.
 
Labour’s Caroline Flint says she was disappointed to hear Sir Alan Duncan 
suggests that people who were not wealthy were low-achiever. (See 4.17pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/11/cameron-tax-commons-statement-offshore-tax-osborne-likely-to-publish-tax-return-details-treasury-hints-politics-live?page=with:block-570bbff4e4b0c3a2a706b031#block-570bbff4e4b0c3a2a706b031>
As a low-achiever, she says, she wants to ask Cameron if he will support moves 
to force companies to publish details of their tax returns.

Cameron says he has always thought of Flint as a high-achiever. She “put the 
boot in” to his predecessor (Gordon Brown) more successfully than he did, he 
says.

He says the government is working to get multinationals to pay more in tax. 
Flint’s idea is an interesting one, but he says he does not want to make the 
best the enemy of the good.
 
Cameron says some countries have complete tax disclosure. That is not the 
British system, he says. We should not give it up lightly.
 
Labour’s Wes Streeting asks if Cameron regrets saying in 2013 that crown 
dependencies and overseas territories should not be called tax havens.

Cameron says that he made that statement in 2013 after those governments 
agreed to share some tax information with the UK.

He says the last Labour government was content to let these places carry on 
acting as they wanted.
 
Labour’s John Mann asks if it is appropriate to claim expense to live in a 
grace and favour apartment while making money from renting out a home.

Cameron says a member of his family went to the parliamentary commissioner for 
standards’ office today to respond to Mann’s complaint, but found Mann had not 
submitted it yet.

He says Mann has misunderstood the arrangement. Living in Downing Street 
counts as a benefit in kind, he says. He says he has to pay tax because that’s 
a taxable benefit.
