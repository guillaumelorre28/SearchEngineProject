Charles Dickens described it as “a deadly sewer” that “ebbed and flowed, in 
the place of a fine fresh river”, while TS Eliot imagined it as a “brown god – 
sullen, untamed and intractable”. For its biographer,Peter Ackroyd, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/16/historybooks.features1> it 
represented “an escape from the world”. The river Thames, as the documentary 
photographer Chloe Dewe Mathews notes, “is many things to many people”. Her new 
series,Thames Log, is the result of five years spent wandering the course of 
England’s longest river, “documenting encounters and happenings” from its 
source in rural Gloucester to its mouth in the Thames estuary near 
Southend-on-Sea.

 Putney Bridge, London, 11.45am. Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘Mudlarks scan the beach 
for treasure at low tide. The use of metal detectors requires a licence and any 
objects of archeological interest must be handed in to the Museum of London.’ 
Dewe Mathews’s images of the Thames are, among other things, a contemporary 
inventory of the often surprising ways in which ordinary people use the river, 
from the mudlarks who scour its banks for Roman coins to the Hindus who gather 
there in devotion to Ganesh as they would gather at the Ganges. “I started 
thinking about the Thames when I finished aproject about the Caspian Sea 
<http://www.chloedewemathews.com/caspian/> back in 2011,” she says. “I’d just 
returned from a place where people have a complex ritual relationship to water, 
whether through their religious beliefs or in terms of the health-giving powers 
they attribute to it, and it seemed to me that most people in London seemed 
hardly aware of the river. I thought, ‘Why does nothing mysterious and 
ritualistic happen on the river in homogenised England?’ – but I soon realised 
I was mistaken.”

 Oxford, 6:30pm: Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘Members of the Oxford Pagan Circle 
perform a river ritual. They dance around a goblet of red wine, a postcard of 
the Hokusai wave, some blue fabric and some incense sticks.’ 
The more she explored the river, the more she uncovered. In the countryside 
near Oxford, she encountered a trio of female pagan revellers who dance by the 
river amid swirling trails of incense smoke. At Tilbury, she befriended a group 
of ship-spotters, who log the vessels that pass through the docks. On London 
Bridge, she photographed rush-hour commuters walking to work in the shadow of 
the Shard, and an annual Anglican procession that culminates there with a 
wooden cross being thrown into the river. At Southend, where the river joins 
the sea, she found white-robed members of an African Pentecostal church 
performing full-immersion baptisms, and, in leafy Richmond, witnessed a busload 
of Hindu devotees from Dollis Hill watch a Ganesh idol being submerged in the 
waters.

 Southend, 3:30pm. Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘A Pentecostal Christian group from 
London perform a mass baptism on Southend Beach. During the course of the day, 
each member of the group is fully immersed in water, including one 
opportunistic passerby.’ 
Dewe Mathews is best known for ambitious documentary projects that can take 
years of preparation. ForCaspian, she walked around the Caspian Sea, through 
Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. In 2014, her seriesShot 
at Dawn <http://www.chloedewemathews.com/shot-at-dawn/> – in which she 
photographed the sites across France and Belgium where deserters were executed 
during the first world war – was included in the Conflict, Time, Photography 
exhibition at Tate Modern.Thames Log is a more personal journey along a river 
that ran by her childhood home in Hammersmith and that she crossed every day on 
her way to school.

 London Bridge, 1.30pm Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘A wooden cross floats downriver. It 
marks the end of the Blessing of the Water, a recently created tradition that 
sees the congregations of St Magnus the Martyr and Southwark Cathedral process 
to the centre of London Bridge at Epiphany. After prayers are said in 
remembrance of Jesus’s baptism in the river Jordan, they throw the cross into 
the water below.’ 
“As a Londoner, my interest is really in the ordinary people who engage with 
the river rather than well-known events like the Oxford-Cambridge boat race or 
Henley Regatta, not least because they have been photographed so much. Most of 
what I photographed came from chatting to local people who live along the 
river.”

 Southend, 6.45pm. Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘Day-trippers from east London perform 
Maghrib, the Islamic evening prayer on the promenade at Southend.’ 
The title of the series, Thames Log, came from the ship spotters at Tilbury, 
who “sit all day logging the continual stream of vessels passing through”. Like 
many who use the river, they keep a constant eye on the weather and on tide 
timetables – the Thames is tidal below Teddington Lock and high tide readings 
are recorded at London Bridge and posted online by the Port of London 
Authority. “I monitored the weather and the tide timetables every day when I 
was working,” says Dewe Mathews, “and when I exhibit the photographs, they have 
a log underneath showing the weather and the high and low water readings on 
that day.”

 Lechlade, 6pm. Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘Druid Chris Parks rows his homemade 
coracle on the upper Thames. In 2010, he built the boat and rowed it from 
source to mouth of the river. He carried an ostrich egg with him and called it 
a pilgrimage for peace.’ 
“The river is the oldest thing in London and it changes not at all 
<http://www.poetryatlas.com/poetry/poem/2266/the-oldest-thing-in-london.html>, 
writes Ackroyd inThames. But people’s relationship to it changes constantly, 
just as the city and the countryside around it change. “People told me that 
they often saw coconut shells on the water and these turned out to be remnants 
of the Hindu ceremonies conducted on the river,” says Dewe Mathews. “I 
photographed a brightly coloured Hindu idol that had been washed up in 
Shoeburyness after 2,000 people had attended a ceremony for the elephant god. 
These are recent developments. The river is a constant but now it seems to be 
attracting people who see it as a mysterious presence or maybe as an antidote 
to the increasingly homogenised city. Their motivations are diverse, but all of 
them are drawn to the water’s edge by their fascination with the river.”
