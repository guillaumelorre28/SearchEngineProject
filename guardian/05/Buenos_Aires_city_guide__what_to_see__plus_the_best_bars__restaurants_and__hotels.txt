One of Latin America’s most energetic metropolises, Buenos Aires today is a 
city for good times, and late nights. Just bear in mind that 1am is an early 
kick-off when it comes to Argentinian nightlife, and head for Palermo. Divided 
into numerous sub-districts, this is the city’s pumping pulse. Palermo Soho is 
the place for speakeasies and clubs, Palermo Hollywood for burger joints and 
craft breweries, and Las Cañitas for posher bars. This barrio isn’t the be all 
and end all, though: Retiro has spawned a hip bar scene, Almagro remains the 
preferred haunt for tango aficionados, and San Telmo’s Avenue Caseros is a 
short yet sweet foodie hub. And with the city designated Ibero-American Capital 
of Gastronomy 2017, the food scene is extending its palate – it’s not all steak.

Buenos Aires has also cleaned up its act in recent years. The Metrobus and 
extended Subte, its subway network, means getting around is relatively 
painless, while 180km of cycle lanes and free bike hire hint at a greener 
future. Bandaged by scaffolding for years, facelifted facades such as that 
belonging to the cultural centreCentro Cultural Kirchner 
<http://www.cck.gob.ar/> have finally been unveiled: a bonus is that many 
museums and cultural spaces charge low, or no, entry fees.

WHAT TO SEE

Centro Cultural Kirchner

After a lengthy makeover, the Correo Central post office reopened in 2015 as 
the Centro Cultural Kirchner. At this neo-classical Beaux Arts beauty all 
activities are free, from exhibits by renowned local names such as conceptual 
artist Leandro Erlich, to opera recitals and tango dance classes on the terrace.

Espacio Memoria y Derechos Humanos

An acute reminder of Argentina’s most recent dictatorship – General Galtieri’s 
ended in 1983 – the former ESMA, ornavy petty-officers school of mechanics 
<http://www.espaciomemoria.ar/english.php>, was one of the most active secret 
detention centres during the Guerra Sucia (“Dirty War”) waged by the military 
junta against suspected leftwing dissidents from 1976-83. Today it’s known as 
the Remembrance and Human Rights Centre, a tribute to the thousands of victims 
of state terrorism. The Casino de Oficiales is especially poignant, given that 
an estimated 5,000 people were held and tortured in this building.

Free walking tours 

In the morning she works at her family’s security firm, but come the 
afternoon, Sol Cernadas shows off her beloved city on a free walking tour. One 
of a group of guides – who offer tours that show off the capital’s eclectic 
architecture, and include intriguing cultural insights – her goal is for 
“visitors to understand us: who we are, what we’re like and how we think. And, 
yes, there are contradictions everywhere!” The Aristocratic tour includes a 
“safari”, featuring statues of lions sporting fixed smiles – her cheeky nod to 
the natives’ penchant for plastic surgery.

WHERE TO EAT

Nerca

Vegetarians, avert your eyes … An ongoing pop-up, Nerca – Argentine slang for 
meat – invites prominent chefs to prepare a protein-loaded, seven-course 
banquet at curious venues (how about a metal workshop?), with lamb and pork to 
the fore recently. Prepare for a meat sweat.
• From £30, on Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/mundonerca> 

Proper
 Photograph: Nicolas Falduti PH 
While Proper’s CV screams “hipster” – it has a mechanic’s workshop location, 
and a self-built wood-burning oven – the offering by dynamic culinary duo Leo 
Lanussol and pastry chef Augusto Mayer is solid. The market-to-table approach 
is organic where possible; fail-safe picks include oven-charred octopus with 
pickled beans and garlic cream, or oven-roasted artichokes with cashew nut 
cream and charred lemon. Building on the Argentinian penchant for playing with 
fire, Proper gives most ingredients the flame treatment, while moving flavours 
and plating straight into the 21st century. No reservations.
• Open Tues-Sat, 8.30pm-midnight; Aráoz 1676, Palermo, 011 4831 0027,

Pulpería Quilapán

Built in 1714 and having survived four yellow fever epidemics in the 1800s, 
thiscasa chorizo – long, thin Argentina houses, named for their sausage shape – 
was recently saved from demolition. Taking inspiration from a ruralpulpería – 
grocery store – to sell organic produce, Quilapán specialises in hearty fare 
such as buffalo milk cheese provoleta, and wild boar slow-roasted for 14 hours 
in Buenos Aires’ largest clay oven. House wine is served in a classic penguin 
jug, and the decor features football flags and disused street signs. Fancy a 
digéstif? Ask waiters Luis or Antonio for the password, then weave through the 
warren-like establishment to unearth the clandestine patio bar, adorned with 
jasmine.

Aramburu Bis

A trendy yet well-priced bistro from the culinary mind behind fine-dining 
establishmentAramburu <http://www.arambururesto.com.ar/home.html>, Bis has 
lifted this corner of Constitución. Thoughtful dishes such as steak tartare 
with mustard ice-cream, or cheese soufflé, are the mainstay. A well-designed 
wine list focuses on unusual local vintages. Slip downstairs for cocktails at 
Bis’s hidden basement bar, Ünder.

Rita Restaurante

On a residential corner close to Argentina’s biggest cemetery, in Chacarita, 
Rita is somewhere between lo-fi restaurant and upmarket cafe. Operating during 
daylight hours, its diners can kickstart the day with creamy scrambled eggs and 
bread baked in house; refuel at lunch with a pearl barley, pumpkin and beetroot 
salad, or drop by for a slice of carrot cake come teatime. Simplicity rules, 
and the ambience is equally unfussy, attracting low-profile digital nomads keen 
for decent coffee, Wi-Fi and a well-priced three-course lunch menu.

Parrilla Secretito

For a no-frills parrilla (barbecue) experience, head to this clandestine 
joint. Mirror-fronted doors used to detract unwanted attention until word got 
out that Secretito was grilling top-quality cuts at rock-bottom prices. Now, 
the sparsely decorated tavern, orbodegón, crams in diners hungry to share juicy 
entraña (skirt) and bife de chorizo (sirloin) steaks for lunch and dinner every 
day of the week. Fans ofRacing football club <http://www.racingclub.com.ar/> 
will appreciate the memorabilia, too.

WHERE TO DRINK

Café San Bernardo

Join table-tennis and pool-playing porteños – the locals – from across the 
social spectrum at this sports hall, which has been running since 1912. The 
cavernous Villa Crespo dive bar also offers up table football, billiards and 
darts for £4 an hour. Always buzzing, service is efficient if brusque; with 
last orders at 5am, it’s an ideal port of call for a late-night digéstif. The 
daily happy hour between 6pm and 9pm includes 60 minutes playing your game of 
choice, plus a half-bottle of red vermouth and a tortilla, for £9.

M Salumería & Enoteca

Trading only in wine with a story, sommelier Mariana Torta picks and chooses 
new selections on a daily basis, and maintains a list of around 250 labels. She 
is keen to show there’s more to Argentine wine than Malbec and Mendoza, and can 
put together a tasting on the spot. There’s no wine menu – simply grab your 
bottle from the shelf, then pair it with charcuterie.

CSJ La Vermutería

While vermouth is an integral part of Argentina’s drinking culture, Lele 
Cristóbal has brought it bang up to date at this tiny bar, dedicated to the 
fortified wine. The tattooed TV chef mans the hot plates, whipping up tapas 
such as lamb meatballs with chickpea mash, while the house apéritif – Cinzano 
Rosso, Fernet Branca and Cynar with a dash of soda – comes on tap for £3. 
Slotted into the facade of his Café San Juan La Cantina restaurant, the bar is 
a buzzing space, with bar stools for eight and standing room for not many more. 
Cash only.

WHERE TO STAY

Querido

This cheerful seven-room town house in Villa Crespo goes above and beyond the 
average B&B’s duty, with 300-cotton thread counts and a 24-hour front desk. 
Fusing rescued wooden floorboards with contemporary furnishings, en-suite rooms 
are airy, each individually designed. An abundant breakfast is served in the 
stylish dining room. Querido’s convenient location means Palermo Soho is a 
short stroll away, though far enough to avoid the late-night hubbub.

Design and comfort are key at this 20-room hotel in hip Palermo Hollywood. From
Florence Knoll <https://www.knoll.com/shop/by-designer/florence-knoll> 
furniture to William Morris wallpaper, every detail has been hand-picked by the 
British-Argentinian owners. There’s an outdoor swimming pool, lush, urban 
garden lined with silk floss and cherry trees, and a compact spa. Walking 
distance from the nightlife in Hollywood, weekend brunch in house is a welcome 
option the morning after.

its heart, it isn’t obligatory.Carlos Gardel

familiar face and aficionados can practise theocho on the dance steps rug, in

unintrusive. Head to the terrace for a cityscape of domes and spires. 
Wednesday’s in-house spectacle is an easy dinner-tango show option.

La Querencia B&B

Close to edgy Constitución, this cosy, four-room B&B in San Telmo is run by a 
French expat, Yann. He has faithfully renovated much of the house – acasa 
chorizo, built in 1900 – but original elements remain, such as a mural and 
encaustic floor tiles. A sunny courtyard is home to two rooms, while the other 
two are set back from the street; all are en suite with showers. Décor is 
simple but the place is spotless. Guests can make use of the compact kitchen 
where Yann prepares breakfast – enjoy it in the dining room or on the patio.
