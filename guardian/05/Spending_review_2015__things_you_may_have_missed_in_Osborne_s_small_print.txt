Not all of the tax credit cuts announced in the summer are being abandoned. 
The Treasury is still going ahead with a cut to the “income rise disregard” – 
the amount of extra money a tax credit claimant can earn before losing 
benefits. In July,George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> announced that this was 
being cut from £5,000 to £2,500. That cut still applies, and it raises £170m.

2. The Office for Budget Responsibility is assuming another delay in the 
rollout of universal credit

The OBR is assuming there will be another delay in the rollout of universal 
credit, the government’s flagship new method of paying benefits. The scheme has 
been downgraded and delayed repeatedly. This is from the OBR’s report:

We have added our own forecast judgment of a further six-month delay to the 
managed migration phase of the [universal credit, or UC] rollout. As usual, we 
have considered evidence from DWP and the latest assessment of UC rollout by 
the Major Projects Authority. While this indicates greater confidence in the 
‘transition phase’ rollout plan, considerable uncertainty remains over the 
‘managed migration’ phase. And of course the transition phase rollout schedule 
has just been pushed back six months, just a year after the previous delay.

And this chart highlights all the delays that have already occurred. (The line 
on the left shows what was originally meant to happen, and the lines on the 
right are the most recent forecasts.)

4. Household disposable income revised down

According to the OBR, the level of real household disposable income has also 
been revised down for 2015 by 0.5%. That means the OBR thinks we have had less 
money to spend this year than it previously assumed.

5. Student loan repayment threshold frozen

Student loans: Osborne criticised for freezing repayment threshold

<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/25/student-loans-george-osborne-criticised-freezing-repayment-threshold>
The government has quietly announced that it is hitting students in the 
pocket, by not raising the threshold for repaying their loans.


The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills says:

To reduce government debt, the student loan repayment threshold for plan two 
borrowers will be frozen until April 2021.

Plan two borrowers are those who took out loans from 2012 onwards. Previously, 
the threshold for repayments was meant to rise in line with earnings.

6. Funding for opposition parties to be cut

Osborne accused of ‘despicable’ attempt to cut opposition party funding

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/25/osborne-accused-of-despicable-attempt-to-cut-opposition-party-funding>
It is often claimed that we don’t have state funding for political parties in 
the UK. But we do, on a modest level, because opposition parties get so-called 
Short money (named after Ted Short, a former leader of the Commons) to fund 
what they do in parliament. Currently this is worth more than £6m a year to 
Labour, and more than £1m a year to the SNP. All political parties can also get 
policy development grants, which add up to another £2m a year in total.

This money is now being cut. The Tories will lose a bit through the changes to 
policy development grant funding, but Labour will be hit the hardest. This is 
from the autumn statement document:

Therefore, subject to confirmation by parliament, the government proposes to 
reduce Short money allocations by 19%, in line with the average savings made 
from unprotected Whitehall departments over this spending review. Allocations 
will then be frozen in cash terms for the rest of the parliament, removing the 
automatic RPI indexation. Policy development grant allocations will also be 
reduced by a similar proportion, ensuring that political parties in receipt of 
taxpayer funding contribute to the savings being asked of local and central 
government.

7. New stamp duty rate covers second homes as well as buy to let

George Osborne announced a new top-up stamp duty, 3% above the current rate, 
for people buying homes for buy to let. Bad news, if you have the money and 
plan to splash; the new rate will cover all second homes, not just ones that 
are being let.

8. London bears brunt of transport cuts, but HS2 survives


Transport has been dealt the biggest cut of any government department as a 
proportion of its day-to-day spending, with 37% slashed from the Department for 
Transport’s (DfT) resource budget by 2020,reports our transport correspondent,

 London bears brunt of transport cuts, but HS2 survives 
Most of the savings will come from London. Transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London’s operational budget of 
almost £700m a year will be entirely wiped out by the end of the decade, 
leaving TfL to fund its services through commercial investment, cuts or 
potentially higher fares.

But the chancellor said that transport cuts would be offset by money earmarked 
for infrastructure funding, up 50% from the last parliament to £61bn over the 
next six years, including 2020-21.

Much of the later spending will go on HS2 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2>
, whose price tag has been officially increased to £55.7bn at 2015 prices. Road 
building will account for £15bn in spending, which Osborne hailed as the 
largest road investment programme since the 1970s.

London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> will still receive a total 
£11bn to continue upgrades and new infrastructure, including Crossrail.

The chancellor said the increased capital budget would ensure that critical 
rail projects such as the electrification of the Midland mainline and 
Transpennine route could go ahead, after they were shelved earlier this year, 
to outcry in the north. The DfT forecasts that rail franchising will deliver 
bigger returns to the Treasury than it currently receives.

The DfT’s budget will fall from £2.6bn this year to £1.8bn in 2019-20. Its 
departmental administration budget will be cut by 12% in real terms, a slightly 
less severe cut than the 18% average across government.
