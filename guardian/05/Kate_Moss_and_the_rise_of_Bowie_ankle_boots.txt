Is your footwear fancy enough? That’s the question we’re asking after Kate 
Moss’s 42nd birthday celebrations this weekend, for which the modelalmost 
achieved a social media blackout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/jan/18/fomo-five-more-feelings-angst-social-media-acronyms>
 – but not quite.

A picture of Moss’s party outfit has emerged, via designer Pam Hogg’s 
Instagram account <https://www.instagram.com/pamhoggfashion/>, and there are a 
whole lot of sequins going on. In the background, no fewer than four varieties 
of animal print vie for attention, presenting further evidence thatMoss’s 
recently established interiors company

 will have no truck withKinfolk <http://www.kinfolk.com/>-style neutral walls 
and hand-hewn wooden furniture.

in tribute to the singer in the wake of his death. As with so much Moss does, 
she seems to have captured the zeitgeist with this – from the feet on the front 
rows of Milan’s menswear shows to the partywear ofactor Juno Temple,

Saint Laurent got the ball rolling last year, showing ankle boots that looked 
as though they had been dipped in glue and rolled in glitter. Next season, 
designers have graduated to shiny, proper glam-rock platforms, as seen at Miu 
Miu and Marc Jacobs.

But even better news from the high street: retailers don’t generally expect 
shoppers to wear something this shimmery so soon after Christmas, so many disco

raised eyebrows, curtain-twitchers and squares and wears sequins on their feet 
in January – which, as fashion tributes go, feels rather fitting.
