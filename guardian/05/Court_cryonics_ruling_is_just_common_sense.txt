Honestly, these cryonics stories are driving me mad (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/18/teenage-girls-wish-for-preservation-after-death-agreed-to-by-court>
, 18 November). As someone with terminal cancer (and ignoring the fact that I 
find the description in your articles of people like myself as “cancer victims” 
to be teeth-grindingly irritating) I feel everyone is ignoring the fact that a 
young woman looked into her future and saw the denial of everything she was 
promised. She was denied boyfriends, university, a job, marriage, children, 
life… and she was not ready to give up on those promises. She didn’t want to 
die. None of us does. I’m grateful that the judge had the good sense to realise 
this was not about whether cryonics worked, but her own hopes for the future. 
Reading some pieces lately it seems that while we’ll arrange bungee-jumping 
days out for the terminally ill, how one disposes of one’s own corpse is a step 
too far in giving the dying what they’re asking for.
