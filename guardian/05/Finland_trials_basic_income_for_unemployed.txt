Finland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland> has become the first 
country in Europe to pay its unemployed citizens an unconditional monthly sum, 
in a social experiment that will be watched around the world amid gathering 
interest in the idea of a universal basic income.

Under the two-year, nationwide pilot scheme, which began on 1 January, 2,000 
unemployed Finns aged 25 to 58 will receive a guaranteed sum of €560 (£475). 
The income will replace their existing social benefits and will be paid even if 
they find work.

Kela, Finland’s social security body, said the trial aimed to cut red tape, 
poverty and above all unemployment, which stands in the Nordic country at 8.1%. 
The present system can discourage jobless people from working since even low 
earnings trigger a big cut in benefits.


“For someone receiving a basic income, there are no repercussions if they work 
a few days or a couple of weeks,” said Marjukka Turunen, of Kela’s legal 
affairs unit. “Working and self-employment are worthwhile no matter what.”

The government-backed scheme, which Kela hopes to expand in 2018, is the first 
national trial of an idea that has been circulating among economists and 
politicians ever since Thomas Paine proposed a basic capital grant for 
individuals in 1797.

Attractive to the left because of its promise to lower poverty and to the 
right – including, in Finland, the populist Finns party, part of the ruling 
centre-right coalition – as a route to a leaner, less bureaucratic welfare 
system, the concept issteadily gaining traction as automation threatens jobs

A survey last year by Dalia Research 
<https://daliaresearch.com/two-thirds-of-europeans-for-basic-income-dalia-ceo-presents-surprising-results-at-future-of-work-conference-in-zurich/>
 found that 68% of people across all 28 EU member states would “definitely or 
probably” vote in favour of some form of universal basic income, also known as 
a citizens’ wage, granted to everyone with no means test or requirement to work.

In a referendum last year 75% of Swiss voters rejected a basic income scheme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/05/swiss-vote-give-basic-income-every-adult-child-marxist-dream>
, but that proposal – to give every adult an unconditional minimum monthly 
income of SFr2,500 (£1,980) – would have meant increasing welfare spending from 
19.4% to around a third of the country’s GDP, and did not have government 
backing.


Basic income experiments are also due to take place this year in several 
cities in the Netherlands, including Utrecht, Tilburg, Nijmegen, Wageningen and 
Groningen.In Utrecht’s version 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/state-handouts-for-all-europe-set-to-pilot-universal-basic-incomes>
, called Know What Works, several test groups will get a basic monthly income 
of €970 under slightly different conditions.

One will get the sum as unemployment benefit, with an obligation to seek work 
– and sanctions – attached. Another will get it unconditionally, whether or not 
they seek work. A third will get an extra €125 providing they volunteer for 
community service. Another will get the extra €125 automatically, but must give 
it back if they do not volunteer.

The Italian city of Livorno began giving a guaranteed basic income 
<http://basicincome.org/news/2016/12/italy-basic-income-pilot-launched-italian-coastal-city/>
 of just over €500 a month to the city’s 100 poorest families last June, and 
expanded the scheme to take in a further 100 families on 1 January. Ragusa and 
Naples are considering similar trials.

In Canada, Ontario is set to launch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/universal-basic-income-ontario-poverty-pilot-project-canada>
 a C$25m (£15m) basic income pilot project this spring. In Scotland, local 
councils in Fife and Glasgow are looking into trial schemes that could launch 
in 2017, which would make themthe first parts of the UK to experiment

 with universal basic income.

Basic income for all: a 500-year-old idea whose time has come?

The Green party in the UK has supported the idea of a citizen’s wage, partly 
owing to rapidly increasing job insecurity and the rise of the gig economy, and 
partly owing to the massive costs associated with administering increasingly 
complex and unwieldy welfare systems.

Proponents of universal basic income argue that it can be more efficient and 
more equitable than traditional welfare systems, and will also protect people 
better as economies change through automation.


“Credible estimates suggest it will be technically possible to automate 
between a quarter and a third of all current jobs in the western world within 
20 years,” Robert Skidelsky, professor of political economy at the University 
of Warwick, saidin a paper last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/universal-basic-income-could-be-the-best-way-to-tackle-inequality>
.

He said a universal basic income that grew in line with productivity “would 
ensure the benefits of automation were shared by the many, not just the few.”

Economists Howard Reed and Stewart Lansley saw further benefits in a report 
for Compass last year 
<http://citizensincome.org/news/howard-reed-and-stewart-lansley-universal-basic-income-an-idea-whose-time-has-come/>
. As well as a solid income base in an age of increasing economic and social 
insecurity, a universal basic income would offer “financial independence and 
freedom of choice for individuals between work and leisure, education and 
caring, while recognising the huge value of unpaid work,” they said.

Opponents, including the Conservative government which rejected a call from 
the Scottish National party 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/universal-basic-income-uk-tories-tories-unaffordable-damian-hinds-labour-green-snp-a7307476.html>
 last year for a basic income scheme, see it as unaffordable and unlikely to 
incentivise people to find work.
