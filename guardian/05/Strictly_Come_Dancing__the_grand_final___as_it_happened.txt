So that’s another Strictly year over, and I’d like to say a massive thank you 
to everyone who has read and shared this blog, but particularly those of you 
who have rocked up every week and been entirely hilarious and brilliant in the 
comment box. It makes this blog an absolutely joy to write, and I really can’t 
thank you enough.


My liveblogging duties aren’t quite finished for the year – I’ll be wrapping 
up The Apprentice tomorrow night at 9pm, so hopefully I’ll see some of you 
there. If not you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so do come and say 
hello.


Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy 2017 – see you same time next year? 
Keeeeeep dancing! Hx

That said, I’m gutted for Danny and Louise. Both of them worked incredibly 
hard, and it was a brilliant final.

The winners of 2017’s Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing> are…ORE AND 
JOANNE! His mum and dad are going ballistic, and there is SO much crying

I know some of you won’t be happy about that, but I’m delighted for him. I 
think he really deserved it.

So who will be this year’s winner? Really can’t call this one, which is very 
exciting.

It’s a Rick Astley/Spice Girls/S Club 7 group dance! Melvin is on the decks, 
Tameka is on a throne, Naga’s got her legs in the air, Leslie’s at the café 
table, Anastacia’s doing the splits, Laura’s wrapped around Giovanni, Daisy is 
riding a pretend bicycle, Greg’s throwing Natalie around, Ed is riding his 
Katya pony, Rinder is lying on the floor and Claudia is doing multiple 
somersaults, just because she can.

Pure cheese. I loved it.

Right, let’s lighten the mood. Time to bring back all the celebs we’ve 
forgotten about and throw together a final Group Dance. But first, a montage. 
So many montages.

No mention of Will Young, however. It’s like he never happened.

on his Uber is already running, isn’t it?

So that’s another Strictly year over, and I’d like to say a massive thank you 
to everyone who has read and shared this blog, but particularly those of you 
who have rocked up every week and been entirely hilarious and brilliant in the 
comment box. It makes this blog an absolutely joy to write, and I really can’t 
thank you enough.


My liveblogging duties aren’t quite finished for the year – I’ll be wrapping 
up The Apprentice tomorrow night at 9pm, so hopefully I’ll see some of you 
there. If not you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so do come and say 
hello.


Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy 2017 – see you same time next year? 
Keeeeeep dancing! Hx
 
That said, I’m gutted for Danny and Louise. Both of them worked incredibly 
hard, and it was a brilliant final.
 
The winners of 2017’s Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing> are…ORE AND 
JOANNE! His mum and dad are going ballistic, and there is SO much crying

I know some of you won’t be happy about that, but I’m delighted for him. I 
think he really deserved it.

Time for one final montage, because god knows we haven’t had nearly enough 
yet. The Strictly teat is INFLAMED from all this milking.
 
So who will be this year’s winner? Really can’t call this one, which is very 
exciting.
 
The Christmas Special looks fun – I won’t be liveblogging, but I can get an 
open thread set up for you again if you like?
 
It’s a Rick Astley/Spice Girls/S Club 7 group dance! Melvin is on the decks, 
Tameka is on a throne, Naga’s got her legs in the air, Leslie’s at the café 
table, Anastacia’s doing the splits, Laura’s wrapped around Giovanni, Daisy is 
riding a pretend bicycle, Greg’s throwing Natalie around, Ed is riding his 
Katya pony, Rinder is lying on the floor and Claudia is doing multiple 
somersaults, just because she can.

Pure cheese. I loved it.
 
Right, let’s lighten the mood. Time to bring back all the celebs we’ve 
forgotten about and throw together a final Group Dance. But first, a montage.
