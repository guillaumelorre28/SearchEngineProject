There are so many brilliant ingredients in season right now that it’s hard to 
know what to do: so many ideas, so little time to use them all. One fish I’m 
always mad for in summer, though, is wild sea trout: it’s a fraction of the 
cost of wild salmon, but just as sweet and delicate, and the perfect foil for 
gentle summer veg. I’m also partial to gooseberries, which make a deliciously 
soft filling for my very British take on strudel.

Poached sea trout with summer vegetables and lemon aïoli 

A beautifully, summery dish. A whole side of trout is a real treat, but for a 
simpler family feast, make this with a few fillets instead. Serves six plus.

3 tbsp olive oil
40g butter
½ bunch spring onions, trimmed, outer layer removed, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced thin
200g podded broad beans
1 handful asparagus spears
100ml white wine 
400g peas 
1 large handful mint leaves

For the sea trout
1.2kg side of sea trout, pin-boned
1 lemon, sliced
2 big bunches fresh dill
175ml white wine
2 bay leaves
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
1 shallot, halved
Fine sea salt

For the lemon aïoli
2 egg yolks
1 clove garlic, peeled
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
2 tsp cider vinegar
250ml olive oil 
250ml vegetable oil 

Put all the ingredients for the fish apart from the water in a deep roasting 
tin that’s big enough to hold the trout flat (or use a fish kettle). Add cold 
water to cover, measuring the amount, then add a tablespoon of fine sea salt 
for every 1.3 litres of water. Bring to a boil, then cover tightly in foil and 
take off the heat. Leave the fish to sit in the water until it has cooled, then 
lift out on to kitchen paper to drain. Transfer to a serving platter, cover 
with clingfilm and refrigerate – you can make it to this stage up to a day 
ahead.

For the aïoli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard, lemon and vinegar in a food 
processor. Briefly blitz, then, with the engine running, slowly pour in the oil 
drip by drip. When the mayo starts coming together, add the oil in a thin, 
steady stream, until you have a glossy, emulsified mayo. Season, add a touch 
more lemon if it needs sharpening, and refrigerate. (If the mayo splits, you 
can rescue it by adding a teaspoon of warm water or a little lemon juice. If 
that doesn’t work, keep the split mayo and start over again in a clean 
processor bowl, adding the split mayo bit by bit once the new batch starts 
emulsifying.)

Heat a deep saute pan or casserole on a medium flame and add the oil and 
butter. Sweat the onions for five minutes, then add the garlic and cook for 
three to four minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the beans, asparagus and 
wine, leave to bubble for two minutes, season, then toss in the peas and mint. 
Cook for a few minutes, until the peas and beans are tender, season and spoon 
around the fish. Serve with the aïoli, and rye sourdough or steamed jersey 
royals.

The naturally tart gooseberries are softened and enhanced by the floral notes 
of elderflower in this nutty, flaky and absurdly delicious pudding. You can 
bake this and freeze it, too, if you want to get ahead. Serves six to eight.

75g melted butter, plus extra for greasing
2 eating apples, peeled, cored and roughly chopped
500g gooseberries, topped and tailed
Grated zest of 1 lemon
1 star anise
5 tbsp elderflower cordial
3 tbsp caster sugar
3 tbsp Pernod or water 
100g demerara sugar
75g ground almonds
4 sheets filo pastry
35g flaked almonds, toasted
Creme fraiche or ice-cream, to serve

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and butter a large baking tray. Put the 
apples, gooseberries, lemon zest, star anise, elderflower and caster sugar in a 
saucepan on a medium heat. Slowly bring up to a boil, gently stirring, then 
cover, turn down the heat to a simmer and leave for eight to 10 minutes. Add 
the Pernod or water, and simmer uncovered for two minutes, until the apple has 
softened and the gooseberries have just burst but are still holding their 
shape. Leave to cool while you prepare the pastry.

In a small bowl, combine all but a tablespoon of the demerara sugar with the 
ground almonds. On a clean work surface, lay out a sheet of filo and brush 
generously with melted butter. Sprinkle over a third of the sugar mix, then lay 
another sheet of filo on top. Repeat twice more. Once you put on the final 
sheet of filo, drain the fruit and spoon it along one of the long edges of the 
pastry, reserving the cooking juices. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds and 
brush the far pastry edge with melted butter.

Pick up the fruit edge of the pastry and carefully roll it over as if you were 
making a swiss roll. Transfer seam-side down to the greased tray, and brush all 
over with more melted butter. Scatter over the remaining demerara, then bake 
for 15 minutes, until golden and crisp.

Leave to cool for five minutes, then serve slices of warm strudel with dollops 
of creme fraiche or vanilla ice-cream and drizzled with the reserved cooking 
syrup.

And for the rest of the week…

Cover any leftover veg mix with stock and bulk up with spuds or pearl barley 
for a wonderful summery stew. Leftover trout makes great fishcakes – add some 
finely chopped capers, gherkins and plenty of fresh dill and lemon. Unused 
aïoli goes very well with steamed asparagus or summer crudités. And make extra 
fruit filling and turn it into ice-cream by churning with vanilla, cream and 
some crushed meringue.
