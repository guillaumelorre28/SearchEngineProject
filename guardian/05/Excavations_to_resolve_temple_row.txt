 A court in India yesterday ordered archaeologists to excavate the site of the 
demolished Ayodhya mosque to determine whether a Hindu temple ever existed 
there.
Three judges sitting at the Uttar Pradesh state high court ordered the work to 
start within a week. The findings, due within six weeks, could finally settle a 
quarrel that has claimed thousands of lives and fuelled a violent Hindu 
nationalist revival acrossIndia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india>.

Hindu mobs destroyed the Babri mosque at Ayodhya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayodhya>, 350 miles east of New Delhi, in 
1992, triggering riots between Hindus and Muslims which claimed 3,000 lives. 
Some 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in violence in Gujarat after the row 
resurfaced last year.

Hardline Hindus linked to India's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) say 
Muslim invaders in the 16th century destroyed a Hindu temple at Ayodhya and 
replaced it with a mosque. Muslim groups deny this, and say the Babri mosque 
must be rebuilt.

Since 1992, Hindu militants have set up a makeshift temple on the site and 
have carved hundreds of stone statues and pillars for a new temple. A supreme 
court order is in place to stop them building.

The court at Lucknow ordered archaeologists "to find the truth in regard to 
rival contentions of the parties." Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, a BJP spokesman, said: 
"It is a positive development toward the resolution of the dispute."

Zafaryab Gilani, a lawyer with a Muslim group which demands the mosque be 
rebuilt, said: "There is nothing in the court order which can be opposed."

Temples and mosques in India have traditionally been built on the sites of 
older buildings. Some archaeologists believe that although there may once have 
been a Hindu temple at Ayodhya, a Buddhist temple probably stood there first.
