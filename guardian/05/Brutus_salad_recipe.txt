There is nothing wrong with caesar salads – they're just a bit too familiar, 
and no one does them at home as they can't be bothered to make the dressing. 
Enter Brutus – with all the flavour his old boss had before him, but healthier.

Serves 2

A hunk of bread (60g) – whatever kind you have around, preferably white; old 
is good, but not completely desiccated
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
350g cos/baby gem/romaine lettuce – just the crisp leaves
1 pomegranate – the redder they are on the outside, the better the colour 
inside
Salt and black pepper

For the dressing
70g lardons
100g feta
3 tbsp Greek yoghurt
3 tbsp olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
A pinch of black pepper

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. Cut the bread into rough 2cm chunks and put 
on a baking tray.

2. In a small bowl, mix the garlic with a tablespoon of olive oil and some 
salt and pepper. Drizzle this over the bread chunks and scrunch with your hands 
so all the pieces are coated with garlicky oil. Stick them in the oven and cook 
for 12 minutes, shuffling halfway.

3. Meanwhile, fry the lardons in a small frying pan over a high heat, stirring 
regularly so they get an even golden-brown colour.

4. While the lardons are frying, make your dressing: roughly crumble up the 
feta, still leaving a few lumps, and mix with the yoghurt, the rest of the oil, 
some lemon juice (probably most of a lemon) and some pepper.

5. When the lardons are shrunken and crisp (after 5 minutes), lift them out 
with a slotted spoon and place them on some kitchen roll.

6. Cut the pomegranate into quarters and empty the seeds into a bowl, leaving 
no white pith.

7. Slice your cos into wide ribbons and give it a wash and dry/drain.

8. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce with the croutons and dressing. Divide 
these into suitable lunch containers then scatter on the bacon bits and 
pomegranate seeds.
