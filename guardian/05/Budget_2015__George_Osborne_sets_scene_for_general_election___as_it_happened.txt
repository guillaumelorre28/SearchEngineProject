Political verdict

Ed Balls thinks George Osborne’s budget was “a bit of a flop”. (See 5.37pm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509b328e4b0d8348eda9590>
.)

That’s not the way Tory MPs are seeing it, and that won’t be the way it will 
be written up in the papers tomorrow, but, nevertheless, it is starting to look 
like a small-scale, functional budget.

It is not one that reshapes the Whitehall fiscal architecture (as the welfare 
cap budget arguably did), nor does it pose any tricky policy challenges for 
Labour (as the pension reforms initially did), and consequently Labour seems 
rather relieved. Ed Miliband gave a decent response in the chamber, which 
helped too.

Some of the measures will undoubtedly get good headlines, but you don’t win an 
election with 1p on beer, income tax cuts far ahead in the future (the tax 
allowance won’t hit £11,000 until 2017-18), or even Help to Buy ISAs. Osborne 
did take some steps to defuse the claim that he’s planning vicious public 
spending cuts, but Labour aren’t going to let him turn his back on Wigan Pier 
that easily (see 5.37pm again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509b328e4b0d8348eda9590>
) and, in one sense the argument about future spending plans is bogus anyway.

The OBR says that, although both coalition parties agreed the budget spending 
plans up to 2019-20, “both parties have said they would pursue different 
policies if they were to govern alone”.


The Tories also claim that departmental spending cuts would not be as bad as 
the OBR claims because they would rustle up some money from as-yet-unspecified 
cuts in benefits.

So, perhaps nothing much has changed. But that might be enough for the Tories. 
Over the last two weeks their morale has been notably more positive than 
Labour’s, and, on economic matters, they are well ahead in the polls.

Thanks for the comments. AS

Economic verdict:

The economic picture from today’s budget is that the end of austerity may be 
in sight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-britain-walking-tall-again-claims-george-osborne>
, but the road to get there is still long, bumpy and painful.

If the OBR are correct, growth is going to be unspectacular through the next 
parliament at between 2.3% and 2.5% per year. Better than our European rivals, 
of course, but there’s more to economic success than outperforming France.

Although borrowing will be lower than expected in December, the national debt 
will be comfortably over £1.5 trillion pounds by the time the books are 
balanced (several years behind Osborne’s Plan A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509b68ee4b04eaa7f286189>
).

And despite Britain running such large deficits for several years, living 
standards have suffered -- it remains to be seen if they’ll really be higher 
this year than in 2010:

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2015/mar/18/reality-check-will-living-standards-really-be-higher-this-year-than-in-2010>
But if anything, the OBR may have leaned on the overly cautious side. 
Economists reckon the forecasts could be raised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-550999a1e4b0d8348eda9547>
, so whoever delivers the next budget or autumn statement may have more good 
news.

The budget has gone down rather well in the City, where the Footsie has surged 
close to a record high. Good news for investors and those with pension pots, 
but not for the poorest in society.GW

George Osborne enjoyed several laughs at Ed Miliband’s expense during his 
speech, but they weren’t cheap gags.

In fact, our datablog editor Alberto Nardelli has calculated that the policies 
behind the jokes cost more than £80m.

Here are some thinktank verdicts on the budget.

From the Resolution Foundation 
<http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/press-releases/31bn-difference-remains-between-parties-latest-fiscal-plans/>

The latest OBR figures show that real household disposable income (RHDI) will 
be higher this year than in 2010. However, the Resolution Foundation believes
this measure is flawed as it includes things people wouldn’t usually consider 
income, such as imputed rents, as well as the incomes of universities and trade 
unions. By updating its preferred measure of household incomes, the Foundation 
finds that averageincomes remain around 4 per cent below their pre-downturn 
peak and are still some way below their 2010 level.

Resolution Foundation analysis of the latest OBR figures shows that typical 
weekly earnings are expected to rise to £452 (in 2015 prices) by 2020,just 
short of their pre-downturn peak (based on CPI). However, using its own RPI-J 
forecast, the Foundation expects the weekly wages of a typical worker to 
increase by £17 a week by 2020, leaving them still some way short of their 
pre-downturn peak.

From the Social Market Foundation 
<http://www.smf.co.uk/smf-budget-2015-reaction-osborne-resists-big-pre-election-giveaways-but-budget-has-election-campaign-firmly-in-its-sights/>

The proposal to make income from savings tax free for those earning below the 
higher rate tax threshold is eye-catching but the benefits are illusory. A 
large proportion of the population have no savings (29%). At a household level, 
for those that do have savings, the average in non-ISA savings accounts is 
£4,000. If this amount was saved in a typical instant access account, the new 
tax allowance would save someone less than £5 a year.

The problem with this reform is not so much that they make ISAs entirely 
redundant, but that they appear to do so. This reform could damage the ISA and 
the positive effect the product has on savings levels. Asrecent research 
<http://www.smf.co.uk/publications/savings-in-the-balance-managing-risk-in-a-post-crisis-world/>
 from the SMF showed, the ISA wrapper acts as a way of encouraging saving 
because it is highly visible, widely marketed and because the annual deadline 
acts as a trigger to encourage saving.

Ed Balls' post-budget briefing - summary

Here is a summary of the key points from Ed Balls’ post-budget briefing.

 * Balls said that Osborne was still planning “extreme” cuts that would take 
public spending back to 1948 levels on one measure.(See 5.17am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509ae28e4b04eaa7f28617d>
 * He said that Osborne’s claim that living standards have risen since 2010 
was based on a selective reading of the data.In his budget speech, Osborne 
cited the real household disposable income per capita measure. Balls said he 
did not think this was a good one, because it included charities as well as 
household. But, even on this measure, living standards in the first quarter of 
2015 were lower than in the first quarter of 2010. Osborne could only claim 
they were higher by looking at annual figures, he said. 
 * He said Osborne’s raid on pensions tax relief had used up £600m of the 
£2.9bn that Labour needed to fund its tuition fee cut, but that the party would 
announce alternative ways of finding this money.This would be announced at the 
time of the manifesto. Labour had plans to announce an alternative way of 
funding the entire package if Osborne had adopted the other pension tax relief 
measures that Balls is proposing as a means of funding the tuition fees cut, 
Balls said. 
 * He said that Osborne mentioned Agincourt in the speech twice as often as 
the NHS. 
 * He said Osborne’s plans to increase the bank levy would not stop Labour 
going ahead with its own plans to raise taxes on banks. 
 * He said Labour would not reverse the increase in the income tax threshold. 
 * He said Labour would not oppose help-to-buy Isas, although he did not think 
they would address the problem of lack of housing supply. 
 * He claimed that it was “a bit of a flop”. The reaction of Tory MPs in the 
Commons chamber suggested they were not impressed, he claimed.

George Osborne may have sounded confident today, but the bottom line is that 
the strategy laid out in 2010 has flopped, writes economics editorLarry Elliott:

The economy has grown much less than expected, and deficit reduction has been 
much slower than forecast. Borrowing this year will be £90bn, two-and-a-half 
times what was pencilled in five years ago.

The government’s failure to rein in the deficit means that cuts in public 
spending – and deep ones at that – will continue for the first three years of 
the next parliament. Tax increases are also likely.

George Osborne talks a good game, but his strategy has been a flop

Small print alert: UK planning bitcoin regulations

The budget includes a section on digital currencies, showing that the 
government is planning to tighten up the use of bitcoin et al, and also provide 
more research funding.

It says:

Digital currencies: The government is today announcing its intention to apply 
anti- money laundering regulation to digital currency exchanges in the UK, to 
support innovation and prevent criminal use. The government is also launching a 
new research initiative which will bring together the research councils, Alan 
Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry in order to address the 
research opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology, and will 
increase research funding in this area by £10 million to support this.

Finally, the government will work with the British Standards Institution and 
the digital currency industry to develop voluntary standards for consumer 
protection.

Today’s budget didn’t include any fresh measures on individuals who work in 
the UK but are domiciled abroad for tax reasons.

Those “non-doms” will be breathing a sign of relief, says David Kilshaw, head 
of private client tax at accountancy firm EY, even though the remittance charge 
paid by long-term residents is going up (as announced in the autumn statement):

Kilshaw explains that these higher charges could be dodged:

“The RBC will increase from £50,000 to £60,000 for those resident here for 12 
years or more and a new £90,000 charge will be introduced for those who have 
been here for 17 years.

“The new charge may see the rise of the “Boomerang-Dom” - those who leave the 
UK for a few years to restart their clock in order to benefit from the 
remittance basis without paying the new higher charges.”

about how Osborne’s cuts anticipate deeper than planned cuts in 2016-17 and 
2018-18, Balls said that, if you look at one of the OBR documents, it implies 
that day to day government spending will fall to its lowest level since 1938. 
(In other words, we’re back on the Road to Wigan pier.)

Here’s the chart in the main OBR report showing how the planned cuts will be 
deeper than in this parliament.

 Balls said the figures showing spending falling to 1938 levels were contained 
in table 1.2 of the OBR’s economic supplementary data, butthe chart itself (pdf)
 
<http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/pubs/Charts-and-Tables-March-2015-Economic-and-fiscal-outlook_03-18.xls>
 is not helpful. You need to have the 1938 figures to hand too. Balls said this 
meant Osborne was still committed to “extreme” cuts.


For the next three years, for the NHS, police and defence, these are 
eye-watering cuts. I don’t think they are deliverable.

In response to a tweet from Paul Waugh, the Tory Treasury Twitter account said 
the better date was 1964, not 1938.

Balls responded to that by saying the Tories would regret admitting cutting 
spending to 1960s levels.

Ed Balls thinks George Osborne’s budget was “a bit of a flop”. (See 5.37pm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509b328e4b0d8348eda9590>
.)

That’s not the way Tory MPs are seeing it, and that won’t be the way it will 
be written up in the papers tomorrow, but, nevertheless, it is starting to look 
like a small-scale, functional budget.

It is not one that reshapes the Whitehall fiscal architecture (as the welfare 
cap budget arguably did), nor does it pose any tricky policy challenges for 
Labour (as the pension reforms initially did), and consequently Labour seems 
rather relieved. Ed Miliband gave a decent response in the chamber, which 
helped too.

Some of the measures will undoubtedly get good headlines, but you don’t win an 
election with 1p on beer, income tax cuts far ahead in the future (the tax 
allowance won’t hit £11,000 until 2017-18), or even Help to Buy ISAs. Osborne 
did take some steps to defuse the claim that he’s planning vicious public 
spending cuts, but Labour aren’t going to let him turn his back on Wigan Pier 
that easily (see 5.37pm again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509b328e4b0d8348eda9590>
) and, in one sense the argument about future spending plans is bogus anyway.

The OBR says that, although both coalition parties agreed the budget spending 
plans up to 2019-20, “both parties have said they would pursue different 
policies if they were to govern alone”.


The Tories also claim that departmental spending cuts would not be as bad as 
the OBR claims because they would rustle up some money from as-yet-unspecified 
cuts in benefits.

So, perhaps nothing much has changed. But that might be enough for the Tories. 
Over the last two weeks their morale has been notably more positive than 
Labour’s, and, on economic matters, they are well ahead in the polls.

Thanks for the comments. AS
 
The economic picture from today’s budget is that the end of austerity may be 
in sight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-britain-walking-tall-again-claims-george-osborne>
, but the road to get there is still long, bumpy and painful.

If the OBR are correct, growth is going to be unspectacular through the next 
parliament at between 2.3% and 2.5% per year. Better than our European rivals, 
of course, but there’s more to economic success than outperforming France.

Although borrowing will be lower than expected in December, the national debt 
will be comfortably over £1.5 trillion pounds by the time the books are 
balanced (several years behind Osborne’s Plan A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509b68ee4b04eaa7f286189>
).

And despite Britain running such large deficits for several years, living 
standards have suffered -- it remains to be seen if they’ll really be higher 
this year than in 2010:

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2015/mar/18/reality-check-will-living-standards-really-be-higher-this-year-than-in-2010>
But if anything, the OBR may have leaned on the overly cautious side. 
Economists reckon the forecasts could be raised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-550999a1e4b0d8348eda9547>
, so whoever delivers the next budget or autumn statement may have more good 
news.

The budget has gone down rather well in the City, where the Footsie has surged 
close to a record high. Good news for investors and those with pension pots, 
but not for the poorest in society.GW

Here are some thinktank verdicts on the budget.

From the Resolution Foundation 
<http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/press-releases/31bn-difference-remains-between-parties-latest-fiscal-plans/>

The latest OBR figures show that real household disposable income (RHDI) will 
be higher this year than in 2010. However, the Resolution Foundation believes
this measure is flawed as it includes things people wouldn’t usually consider 
income, such as imputed rents, as well as the incomes of universities and trade 
unions. By updating its preferred measure of household incomes, the Foundation 
finds that averageincomes remain around 4 per cent below their pre-downturn 
peak and are still some way below their 2010 level.

Resolution Foundation analysis of the latest OBR figures shows that typical 
weekly earnings are expected to rise to £452 (in 2015 prices) by 2020,just 
short of their pre-downturn peak (based on CPI). However, using its own RPI-J 
forecast, the Foundation expects the weekly wages of a typical worker to 
increase by £17 a week by 2020, leaving them still some way short of their 
pre-downturn peak.

From the Social Market Foundation

The proposal to make income from savings tax free for those earning below the 
higher rate tax threshold is eye-catching but the benefits are illusory. A 
large proportion of the population have no savings (29%). At a household level, 
for those that do have savings, the average in non-ISA savings accounts is 
£4,000. If this amount was saved in a typical instant access account, the new 
tax allowance would save someone less than £5 a year.

The problem with this reform is not so much that they make ISAs entirely 
redundant, but that they appear to do so. This reform could damage the ISA and 
the positive effect the product has on savings levels. Asrecent research 
<http://www.smf.co.uk/publications/savings-in-the-balance-managing-risk-in-a-post-crisis-world/>
 from the SMF showed, the ISA wrapper acts as a way of encouraging saving 
because it is highly visible, widely marketed and because the annual deadline 
acts as a trigger to encourage saving.

Here is a summary of the key points from Ed Balls’ post-budget briefing.

 * Balls said that Osborne was still planning “extreme” cuts that would take 
public spending back to 1948 levels on one measure.(See 5.17am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509ae28e4b04eaa7f28617d>
 * He said that Osborne’s claim that living standards have risen since 2010 
was based on a selective reading of the data.In his budget speech, Osborne 
cited the real household disposable income per capita measure. Balls said he 
did not think this was a good one, because it included charities as well as 
household. But, even on this measure, living standards in the first quarter of 
2015 were lower than in the first quarter of 2010. Osborne could only claim 
they were higher by looking at annual figures, he said. 
 * He said Osborne’s raid on pensions tax relief had used up £600m of the 
£2.9bn that Labour needed to fund its tuition fee cut, but that the party would 
announce alternative ways of finding this money.This would be announced at the 
time of the manifesto. Labour had plans to announce an alternative way of 
funding the entire package if Osborne had adopted the other pension tax relief 
measures that Balls is proposing as a means of funding the tuition fees cut, 
Balls said. 
 * He said that Osborne mentioned Agincourt in the speech twice as often as 
the NHS. 
 * He said Osborne’s plans to increase the bank levy would not stop Labour 
going ahead with its own plans to raise taxes on banks. 
 * He said Labour would not reverse the increase in the income tax threshold. 
 * He said Labour would not oppose help-to-buy Isas, although he did not think 
they would address the problem of lack of housing supply. 
 * He claimed that it was “a bit of a flop”. The reaction of Tory MPs in the 
Commons chamber suggested they were not impressed, he claimed.

George Osborne may have sounded confident today, but the bottom line is that 
the strategy laid out in 2010 has flopped, writes economics editorLarry Elliott:

The economy has grown much less than expected, and deficit reduction has been 
much slower than forecast. Borrowing this year will be £90bn, two-and-a-half 
times what was pencilled in five years ago.

The government’s failure to rein in the deficit means that cuts in public 
spending – and deep ones at that – will continue for the first three years of 
the next parliament. Tax increases are also likely.

George Osborne talks a good game, but his strategy has been a flop

The budget includes a section on digital currencies, showing that the 
government is planning to tighten up the use of bitcoin et al, and also provide 
more research funding.

It says:

Digital currencies: The government is today announcing its intention to apply 
anti- money laundering regulation to digital currency exchanges in the UK, to 
support innovation and prevent criminal use. The government is also launching a 
new research initiative which will bring together the research councils, Alan 
Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry in order to address the 
research opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology, and will 
increase research funding in this area by £10 million to support this.

Finally, the government will work with the British Standards Institution and 
the digital currency industry to develop voluntary standards for consumer 
protection.

Today’s budget didn’t include any fresh measures on individuals who work in 
the UK but are domiciled abroad for tax reasons.

Those “non-doms” will be breathing a sign of relief, says David Kilshaw, head 
of private client tax at accountancy firm EY, even though the remittance charge 
paid by long-term residents is going up (as announced in the autumn statement):

Kilshaw explains that these higher charges could be dodged:

“The RBC will increase from £50,000 to £60,000 for those resident here for 12 
years or more and a new £90,000 charge will be introduced for those who have 
been here for 17 years.

“The new charge may see the rise of the “Boomerang-Dom” - those who leave the 
UK for a few years to restart their clock in order to benefit from the 
remittance basis without paying the new higher charges.”
 
Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has just been briefing journalists at 
Westminster. Picking up on a point we’ve made already (see4.04pm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/mar/18/budget-2015-george-osborne-pre-election-windfall-inheritance-tax-live-updates#block-5509a02de4b0d8348eda9559>

about how Osborne’s cuts anticipate deeper than planned cuts in 2016-17 and 
2018-18, Balls said that, if you look at one of the OBR documents, it implies 
that day to day government spending will fall to its lowest level since 1938. 
(In other words, we’re back on the Road to Wigan pier.)

Here’s the chart in the main OBR report showing how the planned cuts will be 
deeper than in this parliament.

 Balls said the figures showing spending falling to 1938 levels were contained 
in table 1.2 of the OBR’s economic supplementary data, butthe chart itself (pdf)
 
<http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/pubs/Charts-and-Tables-March-2015-Economic-and-fiscal-outlook_03-18.xls>
 is not helpful. You need to have the 1938 figures to hand too. Balls said this 
meant Osborne was still committed to “extreme” cuts.


For the next three years, for the NHS, police and defence, these are 
eye-watering cuts. I don’t think they are deliverable.

In response to a tweet from Paul Waugh, the Tory Treasury Twitter account said 
the better date was 1964, not 1938.
