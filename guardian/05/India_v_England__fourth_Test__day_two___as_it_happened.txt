Stumps - India trail by 254 with nine wickets in hand

52nd over: India 146-1 (Pujara 47, Vijay 70) We can indeed and it’s Root to 
bowl it. Vijay sees the first couple of balls off before working a short one 
round the corner for two, before going back to the business of defending the 
rest. That’sstumps on a day that started very well for England before quickly 
souring. The match is just about evenly poised but the tourists’ bowling was 
absolute dross, too short and with far too many easy runs offered to this 
partnership, which is worth 107. Join us again tomorrow as India look to pile 
on more runs before bringing - gulp - Virat Kohli to the crease. Cheers for 
reading. Bye!

51st over: India 144-1 (Pujara 47, Vijay 68) Rashid goes up for lbw second 
ball against Pujara but he’d got outside the line and it was turning away too, 
I’ll wager. A couple of balls later Vijay, at the non-striker’s end, wants a 
single but Pujara is playing for stumps now. We should squeeze in one extra 
over past the 90.

probably counts as a plus for England in context.

49th over: India 144-1 (Pujara 47, Vijay 68) Ugh, yet more crap from Rashid: 
very short and about a yard and a half wide of leg-stump. Pujara gives it what 
it deserves and pulls it to the long-leg boundary. Two overs to go today, or 
eight minutes, and Pujara will be eyeing his own 50 with spin bowling like this.

48th over: India 140-1 (Pujara 43, Vijay 68) A double change: here, for the 
first time today, is Joe Root. He begins with a filthy, very wide ball that 
nearly brings a wicket when Pujara’s attempt at a cut so nearly takes the edge 
through to Bairstow. Once again there’s a mix-up in the middle when Vijay opts 
not to run for an easy single. Vijay is batting in a cap now.

47th over: India 139-1 (Pujara 42, Vijay 68) Spin from both ends as Rashid, 
whose length hasn’t been great either and is reflected by Batty-esque figures 
of 10-0-44-0, replaces Woakes. He has a slip and a sort-of silly forward point, 
which feels generous given those figures. Pujara pushes to mid-on for a single, 
which brings up the secondhundred partnership of the series for this pair.

46th over: India 138-1 (Pujara 41, Vijay 68) Pujara goes into the 40s, coming 
down the track to Moeen and clipping beautifully between the fielders on the 
on-side to the boundary at wide mid-on. Moeen has been too short today.

45th over: India 133-1 (Pujara 36, Vijay 68) Six overs at least left in the 
day after this one, so with 25 minutes left and a spinner at one end we might 
well get one or two extras. These two have put on 94 so far; they average more 
than 65 together, the best of any Indian pair with at least 2,000 runs. Those 
stats do not change in this over.

44th over: India 133-1 (Pujara 36, Vijay 68) Moeen switches to round the 
wicket, an angle none of the off-spinners have tried all that much on either 
side in this match. And perhaps this is why: Vijay hoiks a short on on 
leg-stump through midwicket for four more.

Is this a joke?

43rd over: India 128-1 (Pujara 36, Vijay 63) After leaking three boundaries in 
his last three overs, Anderson is taken off and replaced by Woakes. I feel like 
England are missing Stuart Broad and his cutters here, which sounds curious 
given that it’s a spinning pitch, but he is perhaps England’s best bowler as - 
shameless Guardian plug alert - Barney Ronay explains here.

It looks like Barney has a new byline picture too. Pujara gets the only four 
runs of the over off the last ball, standing up on the back foot and punching 
through extra cover. That gives the scores a nice symmetrical feel.

42nd over: India 124-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 63) You know what I just actually let 
out a low whistle at this one: Vijay steps down the track as Moeen wanted, only 
his drilled it inside-out, over mid-off and miles back into the stands for his 
second six. A couple of balls before that there was an lbw appeal when he 
missed a sweep, but he was hit outside the line. What a way to celebrate that 
though.

41st over: India 118-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 57) Just a few signs of nerves among 
the batsmen now: there’s a slight mixup that results in a run being missed, as 
there was (but, um, I forgot to mention) in the previous over. One off this one.

40th over: India 117-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 56) This is a good battle, with Moeen 
looking to tempt the batsmen forward as he did to bring about KL Rahul’s 
downfall and the pair at the crease looking for areas to score. A stalemate 
here.

“Always nice to see Thom Yorke slowly drowning,” writes Jonathan Budds, “but 
you lose big points for misquoting the lyric; it’s ‘tired and unhappy’, which 
probably sums up you OBO’ers for this test series up pretty well.”


I should draft my resignation now.

39th over: India 117-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 56) Now Anderson’s plan nearly comes 
off when Pujara flicks him off the pads and just wide of the diving Jennings at 
short-leg. That was travelling much too fast for the fielder though. The 
in-form No3 drills one square on the off-side, off the back foot with a 
vertical bat, and away to the boundary. Vijay ends the over with two to 
fine-leg.

Meanwhile this is a perfectly good suggestion:

@danlucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86> if we have to bowl another 
spinner just to take up overs, why not just give Root a bowl? (We don't have 
too, I agree with you)

38th over: India 109-1 (Pujara 27, Vijay 53) “Here, have a 50, it’s yours, I 
don’t mind,” proffers the generous Moeen Ali to Vijay. He drops short and wide 
and Vijay just rolls it down to the rope at third man to bring up a fine, 
hard-foughthalf-century. He’s done well after a tough start.

37th over: India 104-1 (Pujara 27, Vijay 48) Anderson continues, sans slip 
with the lead whittled down to just 296. He does have a silly mid-on and a 
forward short leg but neither is required to do more than gather the ball and 
return it to the bowler here.

England for picking 4 seamers. "Brainless" apparently. Can't disagree - more

Yeah a solid 8-0-44-0 from Gareth Batty would be just the tonic.

35th over: India 104-1 (Pujara 27, Vijay 48) Stokes, drier than a Charlie 
Brooker review with none for four from his four overs, gets a rest and is 
replaced by Anderson. Pujara immediately brings up the Indian 100 with a very 
nice shot, guided off the back foot to the third-man boundary and follows that 
up with a nice drive through cover point for four more. They weren’t even bad 
balls, with barely a hint of width outside off, just outstanding batting. The 
final ball brings a ludicrous appeal for lbw, missing leg and too high.

Raakesh Natraj isn’t happy: “Precisely the kind of partnership that is going 
to ruin things for the home team. These two go on serenely, making the dressing 
room believe this is a featherbed. They in turn come out, go for their shorts 
and the side ends up getting bowled out for 270. The World Cup winning venue 
hasn’t really worked out for India against England in Tests in the recent past.”


You’re going to fit in very well around here, Raakesh. That is some 
outstanding pessimism.

34th over: India 96-1 (Pujara 19, Vijay 48) Change of bowling with Moeen 
replacing Rashid. He has Pujara in all kinds of trouble with a right old jaffa, 
going through the top and coming back a long way and bouncing violently into 
the batsman’s midriff. One off the over, driven down the ground.

33rd over: India 95-1 (Pujara 18, Vijay 48) Another Stokes over, another 
maiden. Atherton agrees with me and, perhaps more importantly, the England 
selectors (but did Harry Shearer from Spinal Tap and The Simpsons buy them 
lunch this week*? No) that this is the best balance for England’s attack.

*Sorry, I know how shameless this is.

32nd over: India 95-1 (Pujara 18, Vijay 48) There’s a delay while the umpires 
check the shape of, and subsequently opt to change, the ball. Ravi Shastri 
points out that India got through 121 overs without having the old ball changed 
once. I don’t know what conclusion to draw from that. Back here, Vijay is 
beaten on the inside edge by a googly and, like the subject of a rubbish Verve 
song, is a lucky man as the ball barely misses his off-stump. The final ball 
isn’t anywhere near as good - the Lucky Man to that googly’s The Drugs Don’t 
Work to confuse the analogy - and Vijay works it square on the leg-side for 
three.

31st over: India 90-1 (Pujara 17, Vijay 45) During the tea break I think it 
was Marcus Trescothick who said India would be all out before the close. 
However firmly his tongue might have been planted in his cheek, he was very 
wrong; this is still a good pitch to bat on even if the odd ball from the 
spinners is doing a bit. Vijay’s single to midwicket brings up the 50 stand 
from 98 balls. Some way short of their 209 in Rajkot but still, it’s a solid 
start.

30th over: India 87-1 (Pujara 16, Vijay 43) In his last 10 innings, Vijay has 
only gone past 50 once - his century in the first Test at Rajkot - but of those 
other nine innings this is only the second time he’s properly got in, so India 
will be expecting a big score from him now. He drills Rashid down the ground 
for a couple then climbs right into a full-toss, driving brilliantly, inside 
out over the top of extra-cover for four of the best. A single off the last and 
it might be time to give Rashid a break.

29th over: India 80-1 (Pujara 16, Vijay 36) A heart that’s full up like a 
landfill, a job that slowly kills you, bruises that won’t heal. You look so 
tired and pretty, bring down the government, they don’t, they don’t speak for 
us. I’ll take a quiet life, a handshake, some carbon monoxide, and no alarms 
and no surprises.

28th over: India 79-1 (Pujara 16, Vijay 35) Vijay nurdles a single and Pujara 
slashes a leg-break away for a couple, but the highlight is the gloriously 
soft-hands with which the latter defends the final ball, a classy leg-break, to 
slip.

27th over: India 76-1 (Pujara 14, Vijay 34) Perhaps a little later than we 
might have expected, Stokes is into the attack. His pace is excellent, pushing 
90mph, and Vijay is becalmed although there’s no movement for the bowler. 
Stokes becomes the third England seamer to begin with a maiden.

Nasser Hussain reckons we’re all wrong and thinks England should have left out 
Ball and picked an extra batsman. Unsurprsingly, given it’s Nass, that’s not a 
terrible idea.

26th over: India 76-1 (Pujara 14, Vijay 34) Two more to Pujara, turning an 
off-line googly round the corner and sending Stokes off on a long old chase to 
long-leg. These two are looking pretty settled now.

25th over: India 73-1 (Pujara 11, Vijay 34) Regarding that review in the 
previous over, I can only assume that it was the fact Pujara left the ball that 
seduced Cook into the review. As Nasser points out on the telly, Bairstow’s 
gloves were outside off when it hit the pad, so that should have been a clue. 
In this over, Vijay adds two with a nice push through extra cover off the last 
ball.

24th over: India 71-1 (Pujara 11, Vijay 32) Rashid gets a go from the other 
end. He beats Vijay with an absolutely pitch perfect leg-break, which is taken 
at slip by Stokes after drifting millimetres past the outside edge and glancing 
off Bairstow’s gloves. After some consideration Cook decides against reviewing, 
rightly so I reckon. That’ll stick in the batsman’s head at least. There is a 
review from the final ball, after a single and a two had ticked the scoreboard 
over, but it’s not a great one.

23rd over: India 68-1 (Pujara 9, Vijay 31) The final session begins in fine 
fashion: Pujara driving a full Ball ball back down the ground and only a good 
diving half-stop by the bowler keeps it to two rather than four. Those are the 
first runs off the Notts man in this match and indeed series, and he induces 
the edge next ball. It drops short of slip though, where Anderson, I think, 
saves four with a good diving stop. Four leg-byes when he strays on to the 
thigh pad then an appeal from Bairstow and Ball - but no one else - when Pujara 
misses a woolly pull shot. Whew.

And Kristian Petterson is back on the spinners debate: “I agree up to a point. 
You expect spinners to do lions share on this wicket but, say Stokes only bowls 
10 overs - I’d suggest he’s had a light shift for a test innings. The key 
though, as you say with regards to Leach, it’s not quantity but quality. Third 
spinner just to have a third spinner is no philosophy at all - they need to be 
good enough to be there. So, in conclusion - you’re correct.”

Yep I think we’re in agreement now.

Exactly.
James (@investor_bod) 
@danlucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86> You're right about 3 spinners... 
If we had Ashwin on the bench we'd play him, but no point playing Batty and 
then not bowl him.

Tea

22nd over: India 62-1 (Pujara 7, Vijay 31) This is probably going to be the 
last over before tea. Vijay works the first ball past short-leg for a single 
then Pujara flicks a full-toss down to mid-on for the same. The former is 
struck on the pad a couple of balls later albeit outside the line of off. That 
prompts a change of angle and Moeen bowls the final two balls of the session 
from round the wicket. That’s tea, with India 338 runs behind. England’s 
session, just, that, albeit on account of their efforts with bat rather than 
ball.

21st over: India 60-1 (Pujara 6, Vijay 30) It might be my rubbish eyes, but I 
reckon I’ve just spotted the tiniest hint of reverse swing there for Ball. He 
carries on aping Anderson with a second maiden on the spin.

On two spinners, Kristian Petterson reckons: “Guess we’ll see what the over 
split is at the end of the innings/match - if Ali and Rashid have bowled 40 
overs each and the 3rd/4th seamers 10 each.”


Well that’s exactly what you’d expect to happen, isn’t it? There are more 
seamers so they can spread their load more thinly? And seam bowling is 
obviously more physically demanding. I’d play three spinners if Leach was out 
there, but he isn’t.

19th over: India 59-1 (Pujara 5, Vijay 30) We’re getting a bowling change now, 
in fact: England’s latest all-rounder (ahem) Jake Ball is on. I like Ball, 
although I can’t pinpoint what exactly about him it is I rate. “Good 
cricketer,” Hussain calls him but he looks exactly that and little more. I 
guess it’s just instinct that’s telling me he’ll do well. His shoulder, which 
he hurt while batting, looks fine now. He begins with a maiden.

18th over: India 59-1 (Pujara 5, Vijay 30) Not for the first time, Vijay 
misses out on a rank full-toss, which he can only sweep behind square leg for a 
single. Four off the over, all in singles, nonetheless. We’re getting a bowling 
change soon.

17th over: India 55-1 (Pujara 3, Vijay 28) More luck for Vijay! A wild slog 
goes straight up and has Cook haring towards long-on, but the ball drops beyond 
the England captain and dribbles over the rope. Later on, he misses with a 
wafty slog-sweep. Since the loss of his opening partner he’s looked as 
comfortable as a man sat on a leather sofa in shorts with the heating on full. 
Still, he’s got some shots in the locker and he nails a full one back over 
Rashid’s head for a flat six!

16th over: India 45-1 (Pujara 3, Vijay 18) Pujara, the new man and one in 
great touch, gets off the mark by rocking back and cutting against the spin, 
behind point for two runs as comfortable as you’ll see. The second of those is 
his 1,000th against England in Test cricket, in 13 matches, at almost 48. The 
final ball nearly brings something that might look like a chance of a run-out 
if you squint, when Vijay thinks he wants a second run that was never on. 
Pujara tells him as much.

15th over: India 41-1 (Pujara 0, Vijay 17) Now Vijay is a lucky man: he looks 
to lift Rashid against the spin - I think he might have been expecting a googly 
- over mid-on but gets a leading edge that loops up high but drops short of the 
man at mid-off.

“Still early days to get too despondent, no?” wrote Kristian Petterson before 
the wicket. “England were 230 for 2 and wickets terms to fall in clusters, 
especially at Wankhede, it seems. Then again, only 2 spinners does already seem 
an oversight. Ach, alright... DOOMED!”

Well yes I was being facetious. But I’m sticking to two spinners being the 
right call.

14th over: India 39-1 (Vijay 15) Sky are showing a replay of Panesar’s six for 
81 here four years ago, which is serving only to cause fans to lament England’s 
spin bowling options now. Rahul is a touch lucky when he top-edges a 
premeditated sweep over Jennings at short leg - surely he’s too tall to field 
there? - but then, a couple of balls later, Moeen makes your OBOer look a bit 
foolish with a lovely lovely wicket.

Wicket! Rahul b Moeen 24

Great ball from Moeen, tossed up and Rahul looks to drive against the spin. 
The ball spins back viciously and crashes into the woodwork.

13th over: India 37-0 (Rahul 23, Vijay 14) I suppose the good news for England 
is that this is vindicating their decision not to pick a third spinner. A 
single from what I expect to be one of several forgettable overs in this spell.

12th over: India 36-0 (Rahul 22, Vijay 14) Another filthy short ball, albeit 
from Moeen this time, and Vijay rocks back to hammer it to the fence at extra 
cover. I have to come up with a “ball of the day” for tomorrow’s panel in the 
paper and it’s safe to say that nothing in this spell is going into my 
notebook. That’sdrinks.

if the pitch is doing anything or is it time to give the Lanky DOOMED klaxon a 
good airing?”

Air it loud and proud. Game over man, game over. Kinda.

11th over: India 32-0 (Rahul 22, Vijay 10) Ah that’s lovely from Rahul, 
rocking back to a slightly short leg-break and caressing it behind point for 
four. He follows this with a curious leave, going down on one knee to sweep and 
then periscoping his bat up out the way. “A Courtney Walsh leave”, Mike 
Atherton calls it.

10th over: India 26-0 (Rahul 17, Vijay 9) It’s probably too early to worry, 
but India’s batsmen are having little trouble working Moeen around on a pitch 
that’s likely to get easier for batting on as it slows up. Just one from the 
over, mind.

Have we talked about the ODI squad yet? It seems harsh that ODI form got 
Duckett into the Test squad and now his struggles there have seen him dropped 
from the ODI squad. And lord knows Bairstow could do with a rest.

9th over: India 25-0 (Rahul 16, Vijay 9) In fact it’s a double change: Rashid 
is on for Jimmy. I was just about to write that there’s a case for thinking the 
leggie is now England’s No1 spinner but Rahul is less impressed: he looks at a 
floaty, full first ball and drills it back over the bowler’s head for a brutal 
four before flaying the next through the covers for a single. Not much turn for 
Rashid out there.

8th over: India 20-0 (Rahul 11, Vijay 9) Cheers Simon, hello all. A change of 
OBOer coincides with/brings (you choose) a change of bowler as Moeen replaces 
Woakes. Vijay gets a couple of nice runs by opening up his wrists and driving 
through cover.

7th over: India 12-0 (Rahul 6, Vijay 6) Bapu Nadkarni can rest easy - 
Anderson’s run of consecutive maidens is over. It took 23 overs for India to 
score off him, as Vijay rolls the ball square and runs a single, and then Rahul 
drives nicely past cover for four. At which point, I’m going to hand over to 
Dan Lucas. You can email himhere <mailto:dan.lucas.casual@guardian.co.uk> or

52nd over: India 146-1 (Pujara 47, Vijay 70) We can indeed and it’s Root to 
bowl it. Vijay sees the first couple of balls off before working a short one 
round the corner for two, before going back to the business of defending the 
rest. That’sstumps on a day that started very well for England before quickly 
souring. The match is just about evenly poised but the tourists’ bowling was 
absolute dross, too short and with far too many easy runs offered to this 
partnership, which is worth 107. Join us again tomorrow as India look to pile 
on more runs before bringing - gulp - Virat Kohli to the crease. Cheers for 
reading. Bye!

51st over: India 144-1 (Pujara 47, Vijay 68) Rashid goes up for lbw second 
ball against Pujara but he’d got outside the line and it was turning away too, 
I’ll wager. A couple of balls later Vijay, at the non-striker’s end, wants a 
single but Pujara is playing for stumps now. We should squeeze in one extra 
over past the 90.
 
50th over: India 144-1 (Pujara 47, Vijay 68) A steady maiden from Root, which 
probably counts as a plus for England in context.
 
49th over: India 144-1 (Pujara 47, Vijay 68) Ugh, yet more crap from Rashid: 
very short and about a yard and a half wide of leg-stump. Pujara gives it what 
it deserves and pulls it to the long-leg boundary. Two overs to go today, or 
eight minutes, and Pujara will be eyeing his own 50 with spin bowling like this.
 
48th over: India 140-1 (Pujara 43, Vijay 68) A double change: here, for the 
first time today, is Joe Root. He begins with a filthy, very wide ball that 
nearly brings a wicket when Pujara’s attempt at a cut so nearly takes the edge 
through to Bairstow. Once again there’s a mix-up in the middle when Vijay opts 
not to run for an easy single. Vijay is batting in a cap now.

47th over: India 139-1 (Pujara 42, Vijay 68) Spin from both ends as Rashid, 
whose length hasn’t been great either and is reflected by Batty-esque figures 
of 10-0-44-0, replaces Woakes. He has a slip and a sort-of silly forward point, 
which feels generous given those figures. Pujara pushes to mid-on for a single, 
which brings up the secondhundred partnership of the series for this pair.
 
46th over: India 138-1 (Pujara 41, Vijay 68) Pujara goes into the 40s, coming 
down the track to Moeen and clipping beautifully between the fielders on the 
on-side to the boundary at wide mid-on. Moeen has been too short today.
 
45th over: India 133-1 (Pujara 36, Vijay 68) Six overs at least left in the 
day after this one, so with 25 minutes left and a spinner at one end we might 
well get one or two extras. These two have put on 94 so far; they average more 
than 65 together, the best of any Indian pair with at least 2,000 runs. Those 
stats do not change in this over.
 
44th over: India 133-1 (Pujara 36, Vijay 68) Moeen switches to round the 
wicket, an angle none of the off-spinners have tried all that much on either 
side in this match. And perhaps this is why: Vijay hoiks a short on on 
leg-stump through midwicket for four more.

Is this a joke?

If not, I really don’t think it’s something you need to waste your time 
thinking about.
 
43rd over: India 128-1 (Pujara 36, Vijay 63) After leaking three boundaries in 
his last three overs, Anderson is taken off and replaced by Woakes. I feel like 
England are missing Stuart Broad and his cutters here, which sounds curious 
given that it’s a spinning pitch, but he is perhaps England’s best bowler as - 
shameless Guardian plug alert - Barney Ronay explains here.

An ode to Stuart Broad: England’s underrated, but best, big-time bowler | 
Barney Ronay

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/11/stuart-broad-england-underrated-best-big-time-bowler>
It looks like Barney has a new byline picture too. Pujara gets the only four 
runs of the over off the last ball, standing up on the back foot and punching 
through extra cover. That gives the scores a nice symmetrical feel.
 
42nd over: India 124-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 63) You know what I just actually let 
out a low whistle at this one: Vijay steps down the track as Moeen wanted, only 
his drilled it inside-out, over mid-off and miles back into the stands for his 
second six. A couple of balls before that there was an lbw appeal when he 
missed a sweep, but he was hit outside the line. What a way to celebrate that 
though.
 
41st over: India 118-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 57) Just a few signs of nerves among 
the batsmen now: there’s a slight mixup that results in a run being missed, as 
there was (but, um, I forgot to mention) in the previous over. One off this one.
 
40th over: India 117-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 56) This is a good battle, with Moeen 
looking to tempt the batsmen forward as he did to bring about KL Rahul’s 
downfall and the pair at the crease looking for areas to score. A stalemate 
here.

“Always nice to see Thom Yorke slowly drowning,” writes Jonathan Budds, “but 
you lose big points for misquoting the lyric; it’s ‘tired and unhappy’, which 
probably sums up you OBO’ers for this test series up pretty well.”


I should draft my resignation now.
 
39th over: India 117-1 (Pujara 32, Vijay 56) Now Anderson’s plan nearly comes 
off when Pujara flicks him off the pads and just wide of the diving Jennings at 
short-leg. That was travelling much too fast for the fielder though. The 
in-form No3 drills one square on the off-side, off the back foot with a 
vertical bat, and away to the boundary. Vijay ends the over with two to 
fine-leg.

Lee Smith writes: “Perhaps a recall for the King of Spain is in order then we 
call all listen tothis. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSGUPsAeL34>”

Meanwhile this is a perfectly good suggestion:
Matt Potter (@thepostmanp) 
@danlucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86> if we have to bowl another 
spinner just to take up overs, why not just give Root a bowl? (We don't have 
too, I agree with you)

38th over: India 109-1 (Pujara 27, Vijay 53) “Here, have a 50, it’s yours, I 
don’t mind,” proffers the generous Moeen Ali to Vijay. He drops short and wide 
and Vijay just rolls it down to the rope at third man to bring up a fine, 
hard-foughthalf-century. He’s done well after a tough start.

37th over: India 104-1 (Pujara 27, Vijay 48) Anderson continues, sans slip 
with the lead whittled down to just 296. He does have a silly mid-on and a 
forward short leg but neither is required to do more than gather the ball and 
return it to the bowler here.
 Gavin Hudson (@gavhudson) 
@DanLucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86> Boycott is really laying into 
England for picking 4 seamers. "Brainless" apparently. Can't disagree - more

<https://twitter.com/gavhudson/status/807164065370034176> 
Yeah a solid 8-0-44-0 from Gareth Batty would be just the tonic.
 
36th over: India 104-1 (Pujara 27, Vijay 48) Murali Vijay’s wait for his 50 
will go on a few minutes more as a maiden precedesdrinks.

Thank you for all your tweets about the photo caption that had a small mistake 
for all of a few minutes. Refresh the page and it has been spotted and changed.
 
35th over: India 104-1 (Pujara 27, Vijay 48) Stokes, drier than a Charlie 
Brooker review with none for four from his four overs, gets a rest and is 
replaced by Anderson. Pujara immediately brings up the Indian 100 with a very 
nice shot, guided off the back foot to the third-man boundary and follows that 
up with a nice drive through cover point for four more. They weren’t even bad 
balls, with barely a hint of width outside off, just outstanding batting. The 
final ball brings a ludicrous appeal for lbw, missing leg and too high.

Raakesh Natraj isn’t happy: “Precisely the kind of partnership that is going 
to ruin things for the home team. These two go on serenely, making the dressing 
room believe this is a featherbed. They in turn come out, go for their shorts 
and the side ends up getting bowled out for 270. The World Cup winning venue 
hasn’t really worked out for India against England in Tests in the recent past.”


You’re going to fit in very well around here, Raakesh. That is some 
outstanding pessimism.
 
34th over: India 96-1 (Pujara 19, Vijay 48) Change of bowling with Moeen 
replacing Rashid. He has Pujara in all kinds of trouble with a right old jaffa, 
going through the top and coming back a long way and bouncing violently into 
the batsman’s midriff. One off the over, driven down the ground.
 
33rd over: India 95-1 (Pujara 18, Vijay 48) Another Stokes over, another 
maiden. Atherton agrees with me and, perhaps more importantly, the England 
selectors (but did Harry Shearer from Spinal Tap and The Simpsons buy them 
lunch this week*? No) that this is the best balance for England’s attack.

*Sorry, I know how shameless this is.
 
32nd over: India 95-1 (Pujara 18, Vijay 48) There’s a delay while the umpires 
check the shape of, and subsequently opt to change, the ball. Ravi Shastri 
points out that India got through 121 overs without having the old ball changed 
once. I don’t know what conclusion to draw from that. Back here, Vijay is 
beaten on the inside edge by a googly and, like the subject of a rubbish Verve 
song, is a lucky man as the ball barely misses his off-stump. The final ball 
isn’t anywhere near as good - the Lucky Man to that googly’s The Drugs Don’t 
Work to confuse the analogy - and Vijay works it square on the leg-side for 
three.
 
31st over: India 90-1 (Pujara 17, Vijay 45) During the tea break I think it 
was Marcus Trescothick who said India would be all out before the close. 
However firmly his tongue might have been planted in his cheek, he was very 
wrong; this is still a good pitch to bat on even if the odd ball from the 
spinners is doing a bit. Vijay’s single to midwicket brings up the 50 stand 
from 98 balls. Some way short of their 209 in Rajkot but still, it’s a solid 
start.
 
30th over: India 87-1 (Pujara 16, Vijay 43) In his last 10 innings, Vijay has 
only gone past 50 once - his century in the first Test at Rajkot - but of those 
other nine innings this is only the second time he’s properly got in, so India 
will be expecting a big score from him now. He drills Rashid down the ground 
for a couple then climbs right into a full-toss, driving brilliantly, inside 
out over the top of extra-cover for four of the best. A single off the last and 
it might be time to give Rashid a break.
 
29th over: India 80-1 (Pujara 16, Vijay 36) A heart that’s full up like a 
landfill, a job that slowly kills you, bruises that won’t heal. You look so 
tired and pretty, bring down the government, they don’t, they don’t speak for 
us. I’ll take a quiet life, a handshake, some carbon monoxide, and no alarms 
and no surprises.
 
28th over: India 79-1 (Pujara 16, Vijay 35) Vijay nurdles a single and Pujara 
slashes a leg-break away for a couple, but the highlight is the gloriously 
soft-hands with which the latter defends the final ball, a classy leg-break, to 
slip.
 
27th over: India 76-1 (Pujara 14, Vijay 34) Perhaps a little later than we 
might have expected, Stokes is into the attack. His pace is excellent, pushing 
90mph, and Vijay is becalmed although there’s no movement for the bowler. 
Stokes becomes the third England seamer to begin with a maiden.

Nasser Hussain reckons we’re all wrong and thinks England should have left out 
Ball and picked an extra batsman. Unsurprsingly, given it’s Nass, that’s not a 
terrible idea.
 
26th over: India 76-1 (Pujara 14, Vijay 34) Two more to Pujara, turning an 
off-line googly round the corner and sending Stokes off on a long old chase to 
long-leg. These two are looking pretty settled now.
 
25th over: India 73-1 (Pujara 11, Vijay 34) Regarding that review in the 
previous over, I can only assume that it was the fact Pujara left the ball that 
seduced Cook into the review. As Nasser points out on the telly, Bairstow’s 
gloves were outside off when it hit the pad, so that should have been a clue. 
In this over, Vijay adds two with a nice push through extra cover off the last 
ball.
 
24th over: India 71-1 (Pujara 11, Vijay 32) Rashid gets a go from the other 
end. He beats Vijay with an absolutely pitch perfect leg-break, which is taken 
at slip by Stokes after drifting millimetres past the outside edge and glancing 
off Bairstow’s gloves. After some consideration Cook decides against reviewing, 
rightly so I reckon. That’ll stick in the batsman’s head at least. There is a 
review from the final ball, after a single and a two had ticked the scoreboard 
over, but it’s not a great one.
 
Hawkeye has it turning past off-stump.
 
Lbw shout against Pujara, given not out when he leaves a straight one. I don’t 
think it’s hitting.
 
23rd over: India 68-1 (Pujara 9, Vijay 31) The final session begins in fine 
fashion: Pujara driving a full Ball ball back down the ground and only a good 
diving half-stop by the bowler keeps it to two rather than four. Those are the 
first runs off the Notts man in this match and indeed series, and he induces 
the edge next ball. It drops short of slip though, where Anderson, I think, 
saves four with a good diving stop. Four leg-byes when he strays on to the 
thigh pad then an appeal from Bairstow and Ball - but no one else - when Pujara 
misses a woolly pull shot. Whew.
 
We’re back. Or, more accurately, the players are.
 
And Kristian Petterson is back on the spinners debate: “I agree up to a point. 
You expect spinners to do lions share on this wicket but, say Stokes only bowls 
10 overs - I’d suggest he’s had a light shift for a test innings. The key 
though, as you say with regards to Leach, it’s not quantity but quality. Third 
spinner just to have a third spinner is no philosophy at all - they need to be 
good enough to be there. So, in conclusion - you’re correct.”

Yep I think we’re in agreement now.
 
Bit of news: Paul Reiffel will not stand in the remainder of this Test.
 
Exactly.

@danlucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86> You're right about 3 spinners... 
If we had Ashwin on the bench we'd play him, but no point playing Batty and 
then not bowl him.

22nd over: India 62-1 (Pujara 7, Vijay 31) This is probably going to be the 
last over before tea. Vijay works the first ball past short-leg for a single 
then Pujara flicks a full-toss down to mid-on for the same. The former is 
struck on the pad a couple of balls later albeit outside the line of off. That 
prompts a change of angle and Moeen bowls the final two balls of the session 
from round the wicket. That’s tea, with India 338 runs behind. England’s 
session, just, that, albeit on account of their efforts with bat rather than 
ball.
 
21st over: India 60-1 (Pujara 6, Vijay 30) It might be my rubbish eyes, but I 
reckon I’ve just spotted the tiniest hint of reverse swing there for Ball. He 
carries on aping Anderson with a second maiden on the spin.

On two spinners, Kristian Petterson reckons: “Guess we’ll see what the over 
split is at the end of the innings/match - if Ali and Rashid have bowled 40 
overs each and the 3rd/4th seamers 10 each.”


Well that’s exactly what you’d expect to happen, isn’t it? There are more 
seamers so they can spread their load more thinly? And seam bowling is 
obviously more physically demanding. I’d play three spinners if Leach was out 
there, but he isn’t.
 
20th over: India 60-1 (Pujara 6, Vijay 30) Moeen continues, with eight minutes 
or so until tea by my reckoning. Pujara takes one from the over.

Being an England fan, you can't help thinking these loose shots would've gone 
to a fielder in our innings@DanLucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86> Such is

You can spot an OBO veteran a mile off, Hornsby.
 
19th over: India 59-1 (Pujara 5, Vijay 30) We’re getting a bowling change now, 
in fact: England’s latest all-rounder (ahem) Jake Ball is on. I like Ball, 
although I can’t pinpoint what exactly about him it is I rate. “Good 
cricketer,” Hussain calls him but he looks exactly that and little more. I 
guess it’s just instinct that’s telling me he’ll do well. His shoulder, which 
he hurt while batting, looks fine now. He begins with a maiden.
 
18th over: India 59-1 (Pujara 5, Vijay 30) Not for the first time, Vijay 
misses out on a rank full-toss, which he can only sweep behind square leg for a 
single. Four off the over, all in singles, nonetheless. We’re getting a bowling 
change soon.
 
17th over: India 55-1 (Pujara 3, Vijay 28) More luck for Vijay! A wild slog 
goes straight up and has Cook haring towards long-on, but the ball drops beyond 
the England captain and dribbles over the rope. Later on, he misses with a 
wafty slog-sweep. Since the loss of his opening partner he’s looked as 
comfortable as a man sat on a leather sofa in shorts with the heating on full. 
Still, he’s got some shots in the locker and he nails a full one back over 
Rashid’s head for a flat six!
 
16th over: India 45-1 (Pujara 3, Vijay 18) Pujara, the new man and one in 
great touch, gets off the mark by rocking back and cutting against the spin, 
behind point for two runs as comfortable as you’ll see. The second of those is 
his 1,000th against England in Test cricket, in 13 matches, at almost 48. The 
final ball nearly brings something that might look like a chance of a run-out 
if you squint, when Vijay thinks he wants a second run that was never on. 
Pujara tells him as much.
 
15th over: India 41-1 (Pujara 0, Vijay 17) Now Vijay is a lucky man: he looks 
to lift Rashid against the spin - I think he might have been expecting a googly 
- over mid-on but gets a leading edge that loops up high but drops short of the 
man at mid-off.

“Still early days to get too despondent, no?” wrote Kristian Petterson before 
the wicket. “England were 230 for 2 and wickets terms to fall in clusters, 
especially at Wankhede, it seems. Then again, only 2 spinners does already seem 
an oversight. Ach, alright... DOOMED!”

Well yes I was being facetious. But I’m sticking to two spinners being the 
right call.
 
14th over: India 39-1 (Vijay 15) Sky are showing a replay of Panesar’s six for 
81 here four years ago, which is serving only to cause fans to lament England’s 
spin bowling options now. Rahul is a touch lucky when he top-edges a 
premeditated sweep over Jennings at short leg - surely he’s too tall to field 
there? - but then, a couple of balls later, Moeen makes your OBOer look a bit 
foolish with a lovely lovely wicket.
 
Great ball from Moeen, tossed up and Rahul looks to drive against the spin. 
The ball spins back viciously and crashes into the woodwork.

13th over: India 37-0 (Rahul 23, Vijay 14) I suppose the good news for England 
is that this is vindicating their decision not to pick a third spinner. A 
single from what I expect to be one of several forgettable overs in this spell.
 
12th over: India 36-0 (Rahul 22, Vijay 14) Another filthy short ball, albeit 
from Moeen this time, and Vijay rocks back to hammer it to the fence at extra 
cover. I have to come up with a “ball of the day” for tomorrow’s panel in the 
paper and it’s safe to say that nothing in this spell is going into my 
notebook. That’sdrinks.

Lee Smith writes: “As I am at work (though not working, yet) could you advise 
if the pitch is doing anything or is it time to give the Lanky DOOMED klaxon a 
good airing?”

Air it loud and proud. Game over man, game over. Kinda.
 
11th over: India 32-0 (Rahul 22, Vijay 10) Ah that’s lovely from Rahul, 
rocking back to a slightly short leg-break and caressing it behind point for 
four. He follows this with a curious leave, going down on one knee to sweep and 
then periscoping his bat up out the way. “A Courtney Walsh leave”, Mike 
Atherton calls it.
 
10th over: India 26-0 (Rahul 17, Vijay 9) It’s probably too early to worry, 
but India’s batsmen are having little trouble working Moeen around on a pitch 
that’s likely to get easier for batting on as it slows up. Just one from the 
over, mind.

Have we talked about the ODI squad yet? It seems harsh that ODI form got 
Duckett into the Test squad and now his struggles there have seen him dropped 
from the ODI squad. And lord knows Bairstow could do with a rest.
 
9th over: India 25-0 (Rahul 16, Vijay 9) In fact it’s a double change: Rashid 
is on for Jimmy. I was just about to write that there’s a case for thinking the 
leggie is now England’s No1 spinner but Rahul is less impressed: he looks at a 
floaty, full first ball and drills it back over the bowler’s head for a brutal 
four before flaying the next through the covers for a single. Not much turn for 
Rashid out there.
 
8th over: India 20-0 (Rahul 11, Vijay 9) Cheers Simon, hello all. A change of 
OBOer coincides with/brings (you choose) a change of bowler as Moeen replaces 
Woakes. Vijay gets a couple of nice runs by opening up his wrists and driving 
through cover.
 
7th over: India 12-0 (Rahul 6, Vijay 6) Bapu Nadkarni can rest easy - 
Anderson’s run of consecutive maidens is over. It took 23 overs for India to 
score off him, as Vijay rolls the ball square and runs a single, and then Rahul 
drives nicely past cover for four. At which point, I’m going to hand over to 
Dan Lucas. You can email himhere <mailto:dan.lucas.casual@guardian.co.uk> or
