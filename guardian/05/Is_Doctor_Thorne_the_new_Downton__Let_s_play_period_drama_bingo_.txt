Watching ITV’s new series Doctor Thorne is like being punched in the face by 
the very concept of Sunday night television. It’s a lush, light period drama 
about dozens of posh people who live in big houses and don’t really do an awful 
lot. AndJulian Fellowes <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/julian-fellowes> 
adapted it. If Doctor Thorne were any more of a Sunday-night show, it’d be an 
hour-long static shot of a chocolate-box lid.

Sunday night television is not for everyone. There may be some of you – maybe 
stuck at your parents’ house, or in bed with an illness that would kill you if 
your nervous system registers even the slightest hint of excitement – who will 
be forced to watchDoctor Thorne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-thorne> under duress. But 
never fear, because I have decided to liven up your viewing experience with a 
game of Julian Fellowes bingo. Below is a list of apparently mandatory tropes 
from his work. It’s up to you to check them off as they occur. Ready?

 * Someone vomits blood on to a table and it is never mentioned again. 
 * Heavy-handed dramatic irony is deployed over an upcoming historical event. 
 * There are so many characters in a scene, you briefly think you’re watching 
a Game of Thrones remake that’s had all the boobs and dragons replaced by 
parasols and constipated facial expressions. 
 * There’s a scene where characters communicate exclusively in eyebrow 
movements.

 * There’s a party scene where everyone might as well just stand around going 
“fim fim fim” for all the good it does the plot.

over.

happened.
