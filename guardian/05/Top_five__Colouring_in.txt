Birdtopia, £12.95 and Floribunda, 
laurenceking.com <http://www.laurenceking.com/en/birdtopia-colouring-book-1/> 
Birdtopia might look more traditional, but illustrator Daisy Fletcher plays 
with scale to create miniature birds or giant flowers. Floribunda, meanwhile, 
features intricate illustrations on high-quality paper (suitable for paint as 
well as pens or pencils) that can be removed and hung up or framed.
