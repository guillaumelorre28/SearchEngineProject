Cheesy American Voiceover Man set a puzzling tone for this episode with the 
line “before things get better, they’re going to get a lot worse...” Is he 
doing it tongue-in-cheek or not? That question sums up this series so far: 
sometimes it’s hard to figure out exactly whereThe Halcyon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-halcyon> is pitched. I don’t 
really care, though. Because of the ambition of the thing and the sheer, 
breathtaking elegance of it, I am loving it – and with only occasional 
reservations.

There are moments where I like to think it’s tongue-in-cheek, almost like 
Woody Allen’s Bullets Over Broadway. At other times it’s more like a straight, 
quality drama. And sometimes it crosses over into self-parody. Still, it’s only 
episode two. It has time to steady itself.

Series creator Charlotte Jones is intriguing. She’s a playwright with a 
massive list of theatre credits whose last TV creation was the 2011 mini-series 
Without You. ITV has also pulled in directors who have worked on Harry Potter 
and Mr Selfridge. They’re not messing about. And it can’t be a coincidence that 
costume designer Anna Robbins (doing a fabulous job here) worked on two series 
of Downton Abbey.

 Don’t let him go! There’ll be nothing left … Steven Mackintosh as Mr Garland.

What matters, though, is whether we fall in love with the characters. We went 
straight to the heart of things as her Ladyship attempted to oust Mr Garland. 
Freddy: “I’ve been instructed to let you go.” Oh dear me, no. Mr Garland is the 
best thing about this whole series. Don’t let him go. There’ll be nothing left 
– unless he gets a job at a rival hotel... But no. “There won’t be a job for 
you here. She’s aristocracy. You’re management.”

There is so much riding on Mr Garland and her Ladyship. Without these two 
performances, this whole thing could sink. Luckily Steven Mackintosh and Olivia 
Williams are well cast and have a brilliant, understated chemistry. The 
penultimate scene with his grieving speech was excellent. Clearly there’s 
history here. Or if there isn’t, the actors have the good sense to play it as 
if there is.

As Freddy says of his father and Mr Garland: “I don’t know what secrets he had 
on you.” This has been hinted at a few times, and will surely will be the key. 
I was surprised, though, to learn that Mr Garland has only been working at the 
hotel for “nearly 10 years.” He behaves as if he was born there.

Which is why I wasn’t sure about the idea of him moving in with the badger. 
This compromises his status; he’s the hotel manager, not a doorman. He’s 
virtually family. And I wasn’t sure he would be a drinker and a gambler either, 
even if he is a world war one survivor. Or that one of his staff would follow 
him to the casino to spell out just at the right moment that he shouldn’t risk 
it all.

But never mind; it’s all part of the bedding in. Hopefully soon we will be 
done with the melodrama and the semaphoring. Have they thrown away the “tension 
between the brothers” plot line too early? Possibly. Do we want to see more of 
Betsy (Kara Tointon)? Probably. Do we want a special plot line for the 
Unfeasibly Large Dog? Of course we do! In other news, I loved the bit with the 
wobbly teapot and the olden days bus with the “Wrigley’s” advert on it.

 That dress! Oscar-worthy … Beverley Knight as Ruby, the Cafe de Paris singer. 
Photograph: ITV 
It’s tempting to award the brooch to Kara Tointon (Betsy) again because her 
look steals every scene. Her Ladyship’s mourning weeds were also wonderful. And 
her Bloomsbury blouse game? Fierce. As for the costumes in the Cafe de Paris 
scene – extraordinary. But the brooch must go to this episode’s obvious winner: 
Beverley Knight, guest-starring as the Cafe de Paris singer Ruby. That dress! 
Oscar-worthy.

 Would they really be allowed to be so close without his mother intervening? … 
Freddy and post-feminist icon Emma. Photograph: ITV 
This is the part where we look at anachronisms, inconsistencies and 
unlikelihoods – the hallmarks of the all-conquering Downton brand. “Got my eye 
on you, Fritz ...” “I was going to invite you to the Cafe de Paris, chef. But 
with that attitude ...” Betsy attempts some Remoaniac sympathising in 
solidarity with Refugee Kitchen Man. But would anyone really be bothered about 
a bit of casual German bashing in May 1940? Doubtful.

I am also trying not to overanalyse the relationship between Freddy (the new 
Lord Hamilton) and Emma, presented here as a post-feminist icon. Would they 
really be allowed to be so close without his mother intervening? And would 
someone in the family not stand in the way of a young woman being made 
Assistant Manager of the hotel, especially when she’s the daughter of the 
Manager? As I say, best not to overanalyse...

 She plays the bitch a treat … Olivia Williams as Lady Hamilton. Photograph: ITV
“I need you for once in your life to be a bloody son to me.” “A madam knows 
how to run a brothel. It’s not something to be proud of.” “All my life I’ve 
been dictated to by men. Why should my son be any different?” Her Ladyship’s 
zingers don’t come close to Cousin Violet’s in Downton, but she plays the bitch 
a treat. More Elizabeth Taylor-style nostril-flaring, please.

“Today is not the day to test me.” Mr Garland displays his hidden shallows – 
and an unexpectedly hot temper. He is not the mild-mannered hotel manager he 
seems.

“I escaped Austria to run from one angry little man. I’m not running from 
another.” I love Refugee Kitchen Man.
