 Can you work out who’s who from the descriptions below? Composite: Getty

Regular readers will be aware that my articles often degenerate into little 
more than a series of heavy-handed derogatory similes. But sometimes I can’t 
even be bothered to shoehorn them into the relevant article. Which characters 
from this year’s news am I describing here? Match the description to the photo.

1 He looks like someone has drawn a moustache on an extended middle finger.

2 I sometimes wonder if he only exists to give the work experience girl at 
Madame Tussauds an excuse to put her half-melted attempt in a suit and hide it 
behind a bear.

3 He’s like a transatlantic Nigel Farage who’s unaware that his boiler leaks 
carbon monoxide.

4 He is, essentially, a bouncy castle with Alzheimer’s.

5 His wrinkled face looking like a collage made from elephant vaginas.

6 He was savaged simply for looking and sounding like a cum-nosed space alien.

I pitched the following as an episode idea for the Channel 4 series Black 
Mirror <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/black-mirror>, but didn’t 
receive a reply.

A man works for a company that stores people’s masturbatory fantasies on to 
experiential memory cards. You can stick them on a card and upload them into a 
machine that lets you experience someone else’s fantasy. The man notices that 
the glass inside old cards changes reality when you look through it. It 
glamorises what you see, smoothes the edges. He makes a pair of glasses and 
wears them as sort of beer goggles. He promotes them as contact lenses and 
makes a fortune, as people find going back to reality a bit saddening after 
wearing them. Makers of Valium go out of business.

One day he loses a lens and notices that the news looks the same with and 
without the lenses. He think that the TV might be made of the same material, or 
the TV cameras, but they aren’t. Eventually he discovers that we all already 
have a very advanced version of these lenses put over our eyes at birth. The 
only way they can be removed is with corrosive acid, at great risk. He feels he 
must see reality as it is, and uses the acid. We see that his reality is really 
a horrendous dystopia, our world a sort of concentration camp, just before he 
goes blind. It ends with him as a blind prophet screaming at people in the 
street, but they only see a humorous street performer.

Which of the following is NOT a star of the UK grime scene?

Legal woes

Sometimes the Guardian refuses to run a joke that might put it in an awkward 
position legally. Which of the following legal worries meant that a joke was 
cut from a column?

a) That Vladimir Putin would sue for a joke saying he was probably a homophobe 
because he’d had to go through life with the name of a gay porn star.

b) That Ricky Gervais would sue, because a joke saying that a Syrian refugee’s 
best chance of survival these days is to dress up as a leopard and hope that he 
gets saved by Ricky Gervais might suggest that he cared more about animals than 
people.

c) That David Cameron would sue, because a joke saying that Cobra is the 
government’s way of showing terrorists they’re not scared by gathering behind 
steel doors in a bomb-proof room would suggest that he is afraid of terrorists.

d) That Top Gear would sue for a joke that said their viewers were relaxed 
about the idea of a new female presenter, and didn’t care who presented the 
show, so long as they were white.
