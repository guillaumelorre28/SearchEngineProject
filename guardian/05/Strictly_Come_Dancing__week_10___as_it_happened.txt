So that’s it for another Strictly Week – only three more to go, which makes me 
feel a bit sad, but also mildly elated at the prospect of Christmas/getting my 
weekends back.


Thank you all for joining in and sharing your thoughts and musings, you are 
very much the icing on my sponge, and it would all be a bit dry and tasteless 
without you. As if by magic, you can read my review of Ed’s best bitshere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/27/ed-balls-strictly-come-dancing-best-bits>
, otherwise I’ll see you next week! Hx

 Ed says lovely things about everyone, including being entirely charming about 
Katya, who has been the star of this year’s show as far as I’m concerned. Katya 
has a cry, and they take a final spin around the dancefloor to ‘That’s What 
Friends Are For’ by Dionne Warwick. Blub.

So how will he judges vote? Craig saves Judge Rinder and Oksana, as does 
Darcey. Bruno does likewise, and Len would have done the same, even though his 
vote doesn’t matter.

Oh Ed, I will miss you. You’ve been an unexpected ray of sunshine in a pretty 
bleak year. Please keep dancing, the nation needs you.

It’s time for Ed! He knows he’s going very likely going home, so I really want 
this to be entirely insane. But actually Ed is really trying, which I love 
about him – he’s giving it both barrels right to the end, and it’s actually a 
very decent Tango. Bit dusty in here.

So this is still a Ropey Rumba from Rinder, but considerably better than last 
night – more fluid and less spiky. His face still looks like he’s dancing on 
Lego in bare feet, but whatever.

Let’s face it, unless Judge Rinder comes out and does the Macarena with his 
pants on his head, Ed is going home. Actually even that probably wouldn’t stop 
the judges getting rid of Ed.

Craig has secretly enjoyed Ed’s dancing, we learn. Perhaps a little of that 
could have made it to his scoring paddle? Isn’t that how the show works?

So who is joining Judge Rinder an Oksana in the dance off? Ore and Joanne are 
safe, along with Claudia and AJ, which means ED AND KATYA in the dance-off.

I’m focussing on the positive - we get to see both of their dances again, 
hooray!

 It’s time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Ellie Goulding. Face of an 
angel, voice of an angle grinder. Not sure about the underwear-as-outerwear 
plus feathery boots look either, she looks like a Flintstone.


 Accompanying dance: barefoot contempo-wafting from Kevin and Karen. You’re 
welcome.

“We all know how difficult the Rumba is for the male celebrity”, says Tess. 
Really? I had no idea. You should have said.

So who is in the dance off tonight, and who is safely through to next week’s 
quarter final?

Oh lord, I’d forgotten next week’s show has a FEEM – it’s Musicals Week, so 
prepare yourself for a Strictly Come Bingo heavy on props. It’s also the last 
week of only one dance, so it’s only an hour long – we should probably plan an 
afterparty.

Anyway Louise and Kevin are safe, along with Danny and Oti (obvs). 

First couple in tonight’s Dance Off: JUDGE RINDER AND OKSANA.

Last night on Strictly: six pretty entertaining performances, all told. 
Highlights: Danny and Oti’s OMG Samba, Ed giving it Blue Steel on the chaise 
longue, Louise’s starry dress, Rinder’s Cha Cha hips. Lowlights: Rinder’s Rumba 
music and Billy Elliot theming, Animal from The Muppets playing drums on Justin 
Timberlake’s Cry Me A River.

Incidentally I watched both Ore’s Paso and Claudia’s Argentine Tango again 
today, and they both improved significantly with second viewing. Just don’t 
think I was feeling it last night.

And we’re off! I love the point in the series where you’ve forgotten half the 
people in the credits ever existed. Like Anastacia.

This week’s opening pro dance has a vintage sports day theme, with lots of 
slapstick Charleston action. Lovely to see Gorka back after the Blackpool 
incident. This is making me itch, but rather fabulous all the same.

It’s time for the Countryfile Casual Weatherman! This week it’s the very 
handsome John Hammond, rocking the check shirt/jeans/brown belt combo. He has 
very manly forearms.

Countryfile is reminding me of the week I spent narrowboating on the Monmouth 
& Brecon Canal. The weather was so bad we moored up in Crickhowell and spent 
most of the week in the pub watching the Rugby World Cup. Happy days.

So that’s it for another Strictly Week – only three more to go, which makes me 
feel a bit sad, but also mildly elated at the prospect of Christmas/getting my 
weekends back.


Thank you all for joining in and sharing your thoughts and musings, you are 
very much the icing on my sponge, and it would all be a bit dry and tasteless 
without you. As if by magic, you can read my review of Ed’s best bitshere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/27/ed-balls-strictly-come-dancing-best-bits>
, otherwise I’ll see you next week! Hx
 
 Ed says lovely things about everyone, including being entirely charming about 
Katya, who has been the star of this year’s show as far as I’m concerned. Katya 
has a cry, and they take a final spin around the dancefloor to ‘That’s What 
Friends Are For’ by Dionne Warwick. Blub.

 Oh Ed, we will miss you Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC/PA  
So how will he judges vote? Craig saves Judge Rinder and Oksana, as does 
Darcey. Bruno does likewise, and Len would have done the same, even though his 
vote doesn’t matter.

Oh Ed, I will miss you. You’ve been an unexpected ray of sunshine in a pretty 
bleak year. Please keep dancing, the nation needs you.
 
It’s time for Ed! He knows he’s going very likely going home, so I really want 
this to be entirely insane. But actually Ed is really trying, which I love 
about him – he’s giving it both barrels right to the end, and it’s actually a 
very decent Tango. Bit dusty in here.
 
So this is still a Ropey Rumba from Rinder, but considerably better than last 
night – more fluid and less spiky. His face still looks like he’s dancing on 
Lego in bare feet, but whatever.
 
Let’s face it, unless Judge Rinder comes out and does the Macarena with his 
pants on his head, Ed is going home. Actually even that probably wouldn’t stop 
the judges getting rid of Ed.
 
Craig has secretly enjoyed Ed’s dancing, we learn. Perhaps a little of that 
could have made it to his scoring paddle? Isn’t that how the show works?
 
So who is joining Judge Rinder an Oksana in the dance off? Ore and Joanne are 
safe, along with Claudia and AJ, which means ED AND KATYA in the dance-off.

I’m focussing on the positive - we get to see both of their dances again, 
hooray!

 It’s a Rinder v. Balls dance-off Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC/PA  
 It’s time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Ellie Goulding. Face of an 
angel, voice of an angle grinder. Not sure about the underwear-as-outerwear 
plus feathery boots look either, she looks like a Flintstone.


 Accompanying dance: barefoot contempo-wafting from Kevin and Karen. You’re 
welcome.

 
“We all know how difficult the Rumba is for the male celebrity”, says Tess. 
Really? I had no idea. You should have said.
 
So who is in the dance off tonight, and who is safely through to next week’s 
quarter final?

Oh lord, I’d forgotten next week’s show has a FEEM – it’s Musicals Week, so 
prepare yourself for a Strictly Come Bingo heavy on props. It’s also the last 
week of only one dance, so it’s only an hour long – we should probably plan an 
afterparty.

Anyway Louise and Kevin are safe, along with Danny and Oti (obvs). 

First couple in tonight’s Dance Off: JUDGE RINDER AND OKSANA. 
 
Last night on Strictly: six pretty entertaining performances, all told. 
Highlights: Danny and Oti’s OMG Samba, Ed giving it Blue Steel on the chaise 
longue, Louise’s starry dress, Rinder’s Cha Cha hips. Lowlights: Rinder’s Rumba 
music and Billy Elliot theming, Animal from The Muppets playing drums on Justin 
Timberlake’s Cry Me A River.

Incidentally I watched both Ore’s Paso and Claudia’s Argentine Tango again 
today, and they both improved significantly with second viewing. Just don’t 
think I was feeling it last night.
 
Darcey appears to wearing frilly chaps. Stop it.
 
Tess and Claudia Dress Watch: Tess in a slashed-to-the-waist navy Aladdin 
pantsuit with one of the 7,000 metallic belts she owns, Claudia in a frilly 
lace lampshade. Both awful.
 
And we’re off! I love the point in the series where you’ve forgotten half the 
people in the credits ever existed. Like Anastacia.

This week’s opening pro dance has a vintage sports day theme, with lots of 
slapstick Charleston action. Lovely to see Gorka back after the Blackpool 
incident. This is making me itch, but rather fabulous all the same.
