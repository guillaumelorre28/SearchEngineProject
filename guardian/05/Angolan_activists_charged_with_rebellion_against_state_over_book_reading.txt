the state yesterday, fororganising a reading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/angola-book-club-dos-santos-arrests>
 of a US academic’s book.

The young campaigners were detained in June after organising a reading of Gene 
Sharp’s 1993 book From Dictatorship to Democracy: A Conceptual Framework for 
Liberation. The book’s blurb describes it as “a blueprint for nonviolent 
resistance to repressive regimes”.

Charges against them read out in court included acts of rebellion, planning 
mass action of civil disobedience in the capital Luanda and producing fake 
passports.

Their defence lawyer told the hearing his clients were not guilty of any crime 
because debate and freedom of speech were protected under the constitution.

Human rights groups have accused Angola’s president Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/angola-jose-eduardo-dos-santos> 
and his government of using the legal system to crack down on critics after 
several activists were jailed or detained this year on charges of crimes 
against the state.

Dos Santos has led Angola <https://www.theguardian.com/world/angola> for 36 
years, maintained peace since the end of civil war in 2002 and overseen rapid 
economic growth. But, his opponents say, he uses a well-funded military and 
patronage from oil sales to keep a grip on power.
