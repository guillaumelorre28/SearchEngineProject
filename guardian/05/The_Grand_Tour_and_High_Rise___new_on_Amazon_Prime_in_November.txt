The Grand Tour (available 18 November)
There’s no Stig, no Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, no static studio allowed 
and,according to Jeremy Clarkson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/30/jeremy-clarkson-bbc-legal-amazon-show-top-gear-intellectual-property-grand-tour>
, no one in the new show from the old Top Gear gang can say the wordcock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/24/top-gear-cast-change-perfect-storm-former-producer>
 either, in case they stray too close to their former BBC incarnation. Will the 
lads-on-tour banter stand up in tents around the globe? Clarkson’s comment on 
their first filming location choice, Johannesburg, is revealing: “Crack a gag 
at a Friday night event in London and you get a chuckle ... But crack it in 
South Africa and they laugh for about a year.”

Good Girls Revolt (available now)
People keep comparing this 1969 newsroom drama to that other 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series> 60s show, the 
ultimate critical darling. Sure, it may lack the psychological depth and nuance 
of the show-that-shall-not-be-named. But you’ll root for the women of News of 
the Week as they sue their employer for equal rights. You’ll cheer for feisty 
free spirit Patti when she gets a scoop while high as a kite; for Sindy as she 
discovers her clitoris and that her husband is a supremely boring berk; and for 
Angie when you see the others pass an envelope around the office for her to 
afford an abortion, because if she has a fourth child the other three won’t be 
able to eat. You’ll back these women all the morewhen you know it’s a true story
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/27/good-girls-revolt-mad-men-new-york>
: it happened at Newsweek magazine, a depressingly short while ago. The fight’s 
still not over.
