Barrie, who was born Leslie Hulme, provided the voice for Pat and many of the 
other characters in the animated series, as well as singing the famous theme 
song. His daughter, Lorraine Peterson, told the Press Association that he died 
peacefully at home in Denham, Buckinghamshire, of liver cancer.

Barrie, who was born in Tunstall in Stoke-on-Trent, voiced the famous postman 
from 1981. He also had a successful singing career, performing on an album with 
Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby and on advertising jingles for Smash and Martini.

 The original Postman Pat theme song. 
Paying tribute to her father, Peterson said: “He was the master of different 
characters and voices. He was very reserved about what he did, but he loved it 
and got to work with his heroes.”

The children’s series followed the adventures of a postman as he carried out 
his mail rounds in the fictional village of Greendale. Barrie got the job after 
recording his voice on tape, at the suggestion of the guitarist working on the 
show’s music. He later said he never imagined the programme would be so popular.

Peterson said: “We are celebrating his life today. He was very proud of what 
he did for children, but his legacy is not so much Postman Pat – he did a lot 
more and he loved singing after starting in the late 1950s.


“When you ask me what dad was most proud of, it was his closest family. We 
were very close, and he provided for us really well, but particularly his son 
and my brother, Paul.

“We used to go to work with dad when we were growing up, and Paul ended up a 
successful and accomplished sound engineer in the same industry, but sadly he 
passed away in a road accident aged 38.”

Barrie lent his voice to 31 episodes of Postman Pat between 1981 and 2005, as 
the narrator, the famous postman and other characters. He also worked onPostman 
Pat: Special Delivery Service 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/10/television.post> in 2008. 

He appeared in TV drama Centre Play and Christmas Eve with Val Doonican, and 
later topped the charts as part of Peter Kay’s Animated All Star Band on the 
Official BBC Children in Need Medley single in 2009.
