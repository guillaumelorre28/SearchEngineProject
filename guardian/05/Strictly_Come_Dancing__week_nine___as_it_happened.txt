So that’s IT for Blackpool Week! It’s been emotional, but I’ll be glad to get 
back to studio normality next week. Also it’s the last week before the move to 
two dances each week, so it’s a super-short show, which my fingers are always 
thankful for. Many thanks for joining in and being amazing as usual, do feel 
free to come and say hello on Twitter @heidistephens if you’re passing. 
Otherwise I’ll see you next week! Hx

Greg gets all weepy about his amazing experience, and Natalie starts sniffling 
too. Bit dusty in here.

So what will the judges do? Craig votes to save Claudia and AJ for being 
“close to perfection” (EH?), and Darcey saves them too. Bruno does likewise, 
and Len would have done the same.

Oh Greg, I’m gutted for you. I really wanted to see you in the final, you’ve 
been amazing.

OK, Greg and Natalie’s turn to give their Quickstep another go. He’s 
definitely less bouncy, but the hand jiving bit goes a bit awry. The leap at 
the end is loads better, however. Have they done enough? I really hope so.

It’s Claudia and AJ’s Jive up first - I thought this was a bit of a mess last 
night, but the judges loved it. I’ll watch more closely this time, see if I 
missed something.

Nope, this is still a mess, and it looks like Claudia is struggling in 
too-high heels. Better than last night, though.

Time for an Olympic Dance Off - based on yesterday’s scores, Claudia and AJ 
will stay tonight. But I actually enjoyed Greg and Natalie’s dance FAR more, 
and feel like he’s made much bigger improvements than Claudia.

It’s time for more music! This time from 80s pop puppet Rick Astley. He has a 
new single out, which I heard on Radio 2 the other day and decided was a bit 
Christian rock for my liking. But I’m guessing some people like that kind of 
thing, otherwise how would you explain the popularity of Cliff Richard?

So who else is in tonight’s dance off? Louise and Kevin are safe (SO much 
guyliner and lace), along with Judge Rinder and Oksana and ED AND KATYA 
(YAAAAAAAAAS)

Which means GREG AND NATALIE in tonight’s dance off! Ed has the face of a man 
who would really like to go home now please.

That’s a real shame for Greg. I’m guessing doing a Quickstep to Jive music 
probably didn’t help.

Last night on Strictly: a bumper Blackpool bonanza, with boozy Bingo to boot. 
I apologise if any of you have a sore head.


Highlights: Ore and Joanne’s Viennese (with endless fleckerl), Rinder calling 
out the show for tenuous VT fodder, Katya’s piano boobs, Oti’s Charleston (I 
believe Danny might also have been involved). Lowlights: overmarking, 
superfluous human props, Ed’s Jive (much as it pains me).

I love this picture of Judge Rinder’s bootylicious Salsa. So much technicolour 
madness.

So that’s IT for Blackpool Week! It’s been emotional, but I’ll be glad to get 
back to studio normality next week. Also it’s the last week before the move to 
two dances each week, so it’s a super-short show, which my fingers are always 
thankful for. Many thanks for joining in and being amazing as usual, do feel 
free to come and say hello on Twitter @heidistephens if you’re passing. 
Otherwise I’ll see you next week! Hx
 
Greg gets all weepy about his amazing experience, and Natalie starts sniffling 
too. Bit dusty in here.

They dance their final dance to Bye Bye Love by The Everly Brothers. BLUB.

So what will the judges do? Craig votes to save Claudia and AJ for being 
“close to perfection” (EH?), and Darcey saves them too. Bruno does likewise, 
and Len would have done the same.

Oh Greg, I’m gutted for you. I really wanted to see you in the final, you’ve 
been amazing.
 
OK, Greg and Natalie’s turn to give their Quickstep another go. He’s 
definitely less bouncy, but the hand jiving bit goes a bit awry. The leap at 
the end is loads better, however. Have they done enough? I really hope so.
 
It’s Claudia and AJ’s Jive up first - I thought this was a bit of a mess last 
night, but the judges loved it. I’ll watch more closely this time, see if I 
missed something.

Nope, this is still a mess, and it looks like Claudia is struggling in 
too-high heels. Better than last night, though.
 
Time for an Olympic Dance Off - based on yesterday’s scores, Claudia and AJ 
will stay tonight. But I actually enjoyed Greg and Natalie’s dance FAR more, 
and feel like he’s made much bigger improvements than Claudia.
 
Incidentally, is anyone else finding that they fancy Ed Balls just a tiny bit? 
Anyone? Hello?

 
It’s time for more music! This time from 80s pop puppet Rick Astley. He has a 
new single out, which I heard on Radio 2 the other day and decided was a bit 
Christian rock for my liking. But I’m guessing some people like that kind of 
thing, otherwise how would you explain the popularity of Cliff Richard?
