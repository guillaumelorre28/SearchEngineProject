The new season has also recruited an impressive list of talent behind the 
camera with Joe Wright, 10 Cloverfield Lane director Dan Trachtenburg and actor 
and writer Rashida Jones all onboard. Brooker has promised an even more 
shocking vision of the future than before.

“Usually if something is so horrendous that people are staggering away, I’m 
kind of like, ‘Yay! Mission accomplished!’” he said toIndiewire

. “We always want to elicit a response. Not all our episodes are just sort of 
bleak fests and the like. We’ve got a little bit more variety this time around. 
But certainly we want a response from the viewer.”

Black Mirror premieres on Netflix on 21 October.
