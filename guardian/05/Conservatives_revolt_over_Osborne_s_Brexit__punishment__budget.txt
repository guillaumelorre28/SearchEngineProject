George Osborne’s authority has been directly challenged by 65 pro-Brexit Tory 
MPs, who have signed a letter saying they will not back the “emergency” 
tax-raising budget he said would be necessary if the country voted to leave the 
EU.

The backbench MPs called the chancellor’s measure a “punishment budget”. The 
scale of the revolt demonstrates the struggle Osborne andDavid Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> will face in picking up the 
reins of government next Friday after the referendum on 23 June.

The 65 MPs who signed the letter, saying they would refuse to back the 
measures, include six former cabinet ministers –Iain Duncan Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/iain-duncan-smith>, Liam Fox, Owen 
Paterson, David Jones, John Redwood and Cheryl Gillan. Osborne claimed that a 
vote to leave would leave a £30bn blackhole, which, he said, would have to be 
plugged with income tax rises and public spending cuts.

George Osborne warning of £30bn public finances black hole if UK left EU

The joint statement said it was incredible that the chancellor could set out 
proposals reneging on manifesto pledges not to raise taxes.


“If the chancellor is serious, then we cannot possibly allow this to go 
ahead,” the MPs said. “It would be unnecessary, wrong and a rejection of the 
platform on which we all stood. If he were to proceed with these proposals, the 
chancellor’s position would become untenable.”

Crispin Blunt, chair of the backbench foreign affairs committee, said: 
“There’s no support for this nonsense – and it is nonsense.” Asked whether the 
chancellor should continue in his job after next week’s vote, he said: “That 
has to be up to the prime minister.”


Another senior Brexit MP, Bernard Jenkin, said: “[Cameron and Osborne] should 
take some deep breaths, calm down and remember they are running the country, 
not just a referendum campaign. They should not be talking up a crisis when 
there isn’t one. Their campaign has been hugely irresponsible.”

Osborne’s position on immigration was also undermined by Theresa May, the home 
secretary, who backs remain but is still a possible leadership contender. May, 
who has kept a low profile in the campaign, told the BBC that the UK should 
“look at further reform in future” of free movement in the EU – which some 
senior Labour figures have recently demanded.

Osborne pointed out on Wednesday morning that there was no appetite for this 
in the EU and argued migration could be controlled through restrictions on 
welfare.

There was also criticism of Cameron, although the leaders of the Vote Leave 
campaign have insisted in public that they believe he could remain in post even 
in the event of a vote to quit the EU and take charge of the negotiations for 
an exit.

But one senior Vote Leave source told the Guardian the intensity of the 
campaign had been such that “we think Cameron would be out by lunchtime”.

The chancellor, who remains a contender to succeed Cameron, defended his 
position on Wednesday and produced a mocked-up budget document to bolster his 
argument.

“You would have to show the British public you had a credible plan to deal 
with the public finances,” Osborne insisted. Pressed on whether it would spell 
the end of his own career, he said: “It’s not about one politician, it’s not 
about one political career … this is about the future of our country, about who 
we are as a country. What’s the point of getting involved in public life if 
you’re not prepared to fight for the things you think are really important to 
our country and its future, its standing in the world and for jobs and 
prosperity?”

He is expected to double down on the economic arguments on Thursday, 
delivering a Mansion House speech in the City of London in which he is expected 
to underline afresh the financial risks of leaving. A senior remain campaign 
source said: “He makes no apology for making the economic argument – it isthe 
argument.”

But backbench Conservatives reacted with fury to the mocked-up document, which 
entailed abandoning a series of key Conservative election pledges, on 
everything from income tax to inheritance tax.

The Tory MP for Peterborough, Stewart Jackson, said: “Osborne, by his 
appalling conduct, has lost the confidence of the parliamentary conservative 
party and the City. His efforts to talk down the UK economy are unprecedented 
and his petulant threats of a fantasy budget are desperate and risible.” He 
added: “His position is now untenable.”

Another senior Tory MP in the Brexit camp, who signed the statement against 
the emergency budget, said the country might need Cameron to stay on for a 
while to ensure stability if there were a vote to leave but that Osborne was 
more dispensable. “I think George’s chances of becoming PM have been on the 
rocks for quite some time, since around the time of tax credits certainly. But 
this would be hard to come back from. It’s not impossible, after a few years, 
if there is a vote to remain, but a lot of party members voting to leave are 
very angry about the way they have been portrayed as little Englanders and 
unpatriotic by both David and George.”

However, Michael Gove, the justice secretary and a leading Brexit campaigner, 
dismissed the idea that he would join fellow Tories in voting down an emergency 
budget called by Osborne, but only because he did not think such a fiscal event 
would be necessary.

Questioning the judgment of Osborne, who has for years been one of his closest 
political friends, Gove said in a BBC Question Time interview: “There is no 
need for an emergency budget. The truth is, if we vote to leave we will be in 
an economically stronger position.”

The argument arose on a day of drama in Westminster as the Ukip leader, Nigel 
Farage, and pop star Bob Geldof clashed in the middle of the Thames 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/nigel-farage-bob-geldof-rival-eu-referendum-thames-flotillas>
 in boats campaigning for and against remaining in the EU. Farage dismissed the 
chancellor’s warning. “Ignore Mr Osborne’s fantasy budget. Post-Brexit he won’t 
be the chancellor for very long,” he tweeted.

Even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, Osborne’s leadership hopes have 
already been wounded by U-turns over tax credits and disability benefit cuts, 
and the animosity of much of the Conservative grassroots towards Downing 
Street’s campaign to stay in.

Osborne stood his ground on Wednesday, however, insisting there would be no 
choice but to make extremely tough spending decisions to protect the 
economy.Cameron backed him and the former Labour chancellorAlistair Darling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling>, at prime minister’s 
questions, saying the financial shock of leaving the EU must not be ignored. 
“Nobody wants to have an emergency budget. Nobody wants to have cuts in public 
services. Nobody wants to have tax increases,” he said. “But I would say this. 
There is only one thing worse than not addressing a crisis in your public 
finances through a budget, and that is ignoring it.”

The spotlight will switch back to Labour on Thursday, with Gordon Brown and 
the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appearing together in Manchester to make 
the argument that northern Britain could be entitled to more EU funding if it 
votes to remain next week. Separately, Labour local council leaders will argue 
that poorer areas would be hardest hit by the economic shock in the event of 
Brexit.

Brown will warn that leaving the EU could put Britain’s great cities at risk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/leaving-eu-could-put-uks-cities-at-risk-of-industrial-decline-says-brown>
 of industrial decline last seen in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher. The 
Labour former prime minister will say the UK’s 10 biggest cities outside London 
would see their economies threatened by leaving the EU, which has poured 
funding into areas that the Tories turned “from industrial heartlands into 
industrial wastelands”.
