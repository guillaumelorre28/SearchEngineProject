It was the most infamous fall in Olympic history and now Zola Budd has told 
how she deliberately slowed down after she tangled with Mary Decker who came 
crashing to the ground at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.

Budd, the barefoot South Africa-born runner who was given a fast-track 
passport to represent Great Britain at the Olympics, said she “gave up” after 
the incident because she did not want to win a medal when the crowd started to 
boo her.

Budd and Decker have been reunited for a feature-length documentary 32 years 
after the catastrophic finish to one of the most eagerly anticipated clashes on 
the running track.

Budd said she could only recall a “blur” of the events of the 3,000m Olympic 
final. “I only knew someone had fallen. When I passed by the spot again, on the 
next lap, it was then I realised it was Mary,” she told the Radio Times. “And 
the crowd started booing. That’s when I gave up. Everything leading up to it, 
all the politics, all the hype, and then for Mary to fall. it was like a soap 
opera. It couldn’t be real. I slowed down deliberately. I didn’t want to be on 
the medal podium. In a way, I stopped running.”

Budd had joined the British team on the grounds that her grandfather was 
British, but the switch was hugely controversial during the apartheid-era 
sporting boycott.

She and Decker clashed just after the halfway mark in the race. Budd, who was 
at the front of the field at the time, briefly regained the lead but finished 
seventh. The gold medal was won by Romania’s Maricica Puică.

 Five minutes in and ... ‘Decker is down ... the booing has started’ 
Budd said she still thought about the race today. “Yes I do. You can’t not. It 
becomes part of your life,” she said. “It did make me angry, but not any more. 
I still feel angry at people for blaming me for apartheid, and wanting me to 
take responsibility for that. But I’m not bitter.”

Decker, the former world champion and one-time golden girl of US athletics who 
set a string of world records in the run-up to the 1984 Games, said: “I don’t 
think about it. It’s something that almost happened in a different lifetime. 
People need to understand that the Olympics are important, but they don’t 
define your entire career.”

In the Sky Atlantic documentary, The Fall, the two women jog together on the 
grassed-over track in the LA stadium where it happened.

Budd said it was “probably good for both of us. To be there with Mary put a 
lot of things to rest. Before, it was this huge stadium full of booing people. 
But meeting Mary normalised everything. It healed both of us.”

Decker said: “I think I have arrived at a good place. I have one child, Zola 
has three. We have life.”

• The Fall opens on 29 July in selected cinemas and will be broadcast on the 
same day, at 9pm, on Sky Atlantic
