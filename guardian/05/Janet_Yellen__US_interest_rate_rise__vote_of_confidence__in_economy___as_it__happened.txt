Eurogroup puts Greek debt measures on hold

And it seems that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ plan to give struggling 
pensioners a Christmas bonus has riled the country’s creditors, who had not 
agreed the deal.

The spokesman for the Eurogroup has just said there was no agreement now to 
implement the latest short term debt measures:

Helena Smith

Over to Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> where tensions 
between Athens and the International Monetary Fund continue. As prime minister 
Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this 
week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw 
from the country’s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek 
capital:

Greece’s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based 
institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks 
even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest 
spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in 
the wake of the fund’s decision to go public with its views – in a blog penned 
this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice 
Obstfeld – Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from 
the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. “The Fund has never 
officially joined this programme and we don’t really need it,” said one. “At 
most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.”

The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by 
“irrational technocrats,” is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more 
pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018. Far too often, he 
said, the IMF had got it wrong with assessments that either over-estimated or 
under-estimated the impact of recessionary policies on Greece.

In the blog, Thomsen and Obstfeld sought to clarify what they described as 
“misinformation” surrounding the Fund’s role in Greece insisting that far from 
advocating more austerity the organisation wanted less. Instead, they said, it 
was the agreement of Athens to achieve higher fiscal targets that made more 
austerity inevitable.

Tsipras’ new stance has not been met with universal applause. Many see it as 
counter-productive, arguing that despite popular myth the IMF is by far 
Greece’s best ally supporting it on the need for debt relief and primary 
surplus requirements to be reduced.

Wolfgang Manchau, the prominent European affairs columnist, tweeted that 
Tsipras was making a huge strategic mistake aligning himself with the Europeans 
against the IMF.

Stefanos Manos, Greece’s former finance minister, also said he welcomed the 
IMF officials’ intervention. “I’m glad they went public with their views. Their 
[blog] comments amounted to a very balanced presentation and made quite a lot 
of sense,” he told me. “Some of their points – like the one that more than 50 % 
of people in Greece are not taxed at all - were hair-raising, absolutely 
maddening to read but needed to be aired.”

Oil prices slip

Oil prices have slipped lower after their surge since the weekend’s agreement 
between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output.

The fall follows data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing 
a 4.7m weekly rise in US crude inventories compared to expectations of a 1.6m 
decline. Official figures from the US Energy Information Administration are due 
later.

Meanwhile Opec’s latest report showed a growing oil surplus next year unless 
members stick to their output curbs. Opec said with the cuts the 2017 overhang 
would reach 1.24m barrels a day, up 300,000 on its previous estimate.

Brent crude is currently down 1.29% at $55 a barrel.

Weak US retail sales figures, but strong producer prices

Something for the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> to think about as they 
sign off on their latest interest rate decision, with the first rise for a year 
widely expected.

Retails sales growth cooled off in November after two months of strong gains. 
They edged up just 0.1% as consumers cut back on car purchases, while October’s 
figure was revised down from the initial 0.8% gain to 0.6%. Economists had been 
expecting a rise of 0.3%.

Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

Retailers will be more than a little disappointed with November’s drop in 
retail sales, as well as October’s revised figure, which overall leaves 
question marks hanging over the sector going in to the festive shopping season.

However, observers will point to the contentious presidential election as a 
prime reason for shoppers keeping their wallets closed amid the swirling 
uncertainty.

With retailers making the bulk of their profits in December, the sector will 
be hoping the lure of sales will be too tempting for shoppers to resist.

But signs of rising inflation have come from another set of data. US producer 
prices climbed 0.4% last month, the largest gain since June, after being 
unchanged in October. This is higher than the 0.1% increase expected by 
analysts. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said:

..What really grabs the attention is the 1.3% month on month rise in trade 
services. This is mainly due to wider margins in the wholesale and retail 
sector. And as such, could well be echoed in the November CPI release on 
December 15.

With the consensus expectation for only a 0.2% month on month increase in 
November’s headline CPI, we now think that the risk of a higher (say 0.4% month 
on month) figure is looking more likely.

If so, then headline inflation will rise from 1.6% in October, to 1.9% in 
November - in excess of the 1.7% year on year consensus estimate.

With markets looking for little further tightening from the Fed after what 
looks a near-certain rate hike today - the Fed may start to look as if it is 
either allowing the economy to run a little hot, or alternatively, falling 
behind the curve, unless today’s expected hike is coupled with more hawkish 
guidance.

With the UK employment figures out of the way, investors are waiting patiently 
for the Federal Reserve’s interest rates decision in six hours time.

European stock markets are basically flat (the FTSE 100 has lost 7 points, or 
0.1%), and Wall Street is expected to open quietly in 75 minutes time.

Punch shares surge as takeover battle breaks out

Back in the City, shares in British’s second largest pub chain have soared by 
a third as a takeover battle breaks out.

Punch Tavern is being pursued by Heineken, the Dutch brewer which produces 
Strongbow and Foster’s, and also by Alan McIntosh, one of Punch’s cofounders.

This two-way battle, broken by Sky’s Mark Kleinman this morning, has excited 
the City.

EXCLUSIVE: Heineken in secret takeover battle for Punch Taverns, group which 
owns 3300 pubs. Bidding against Punch co-founder Alan McIntosh.

Shares in Punch have rocketed by 35% to 172p, from 128p, a two-year high.

The company leases urban and rural pubs across the country to tenant 
landlords, and has been spending years tackling its huge debt pile build up 
before the financial crisis.
 Punch Tavern’s share price Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Punch has just issued a statement, confirming that it is in “advanced 
discussions” with the Heineken side, Patron Capital Advisers ,about an offer of 
174p per share.

It is also in “discussions” with McIntosh’s consortium, Emerald Investment 
Partners, which are offering 185p per share (subject to due diligence etc).

Punch cautions that:

There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by either Patron or 
Emerald. A further announcement will be made in due course.

Both groups have until 11 January to make a firm bid, or walk away.

That might not be the end of it, though -- industry regulators might have 
concerns about such a large pub estate changing hands, especially as Heineken 
already owns 1,100 leased pubs.

FSB urges more help for self-employed people

Today’s report shows that there are now 4.75 million self-employed people in 
the UK, up 129,000 compared to last year.

Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, is 
urging the government to provide more help for these workers - who aren’t 
entitled to the full range of benefits which employees receive.

“The huge rise in self-employment since the recession must be met with action. 
There is much to do to improve our social security and financial systems in 
particular.

“Social security and our tax system have not kept up with the changing nature 
of 21st century work. It is urgent that Government gets to grips with the new 
reality of more people striking out on their own and working for themselves. In 
maternity, low pay, pensions and the housing market, the self-employed lose out 
from systems designed for a different age.

“The Government’s Taylor review is a crucial opportunity to help the wellbeing 
of the self-employed and the companies they start. Maternity support must be 
raised to a level closer with the employed and the design of Universal Credit 
changed so it’s no longer a threat to business start-ups. The financial system 
must ensure the self-employed have the same chance to buy their own homes and 
save for retirement as those in traditional employment.”

And it seems that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ plan to give struggling 
pensioners a Christmas bonus has riled the country’s creditors, who had not 
agreed the deal.

The spokesman for the Eurogroup has just said there was no agreement now to 
implement the latest short term debt measures:

Over to Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> where tensions 
between Athens and the International Monetary Fund continue. As prime minister 
Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this 
week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw 
from the country’s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek 
capital:

Greece’s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based 
institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks 
even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest 
spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in 
the wake of the fund’s decision to go public with its views – in a blog penned 
this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice 
Obstfeld – Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from 
the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. “The Fund has never 
officially joined this programme and we don’t really need it,” said one. “At 
most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.”

The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by 
“irrational technocrats,” is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more 
pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018. Far too often, he 
said, the IMF had got it wrong with assessments that either over-estimated or 
under-estimated the impact of recessionary policies on Greece.

In the blog, Thomsen and Obstfeld sought to clarify what they described as 
“misinformation” surrounding the Fund’s role in Greece insisting that far from 
advocating more austerity the organisation wanted less. Instead, they said, it 
was the agreement of Athens to achieve higher fiscal targets that made more 
austerity inevitable.

Tsipras’ new stance has not been met with universal applause. Many see it as 
counter-productive, arguing that despite popular myth the IMF is by far 
Greece’s best ally supporting it on the need for debt relief and primary 
surplus requirements to be reduced.

Wolfgang Manchau, the prominent European affairs columnist, tweeted that 
Tsipras was making a huge strategic mistake aligning himself with the Europeans 
against the IMF.

Stefanos Manos, Greece’s former finance minister, also said he welcomed the 
IMF officials’ intervention. “I’m glad they went public with their views. Their 
[blog] comments amounted to a very balanced presentation and made quite a lot 
of sense,” he told me. “Some of their points – like the one that more than 50 % 
of people in Greece are not taxed at all - were hair-raising, absolutely 
maddening to read but needed to be aired.”
 
Ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, US markets have edged 
lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which has been toying with the 20,000 
barrier for the first time - is down 11 points at 19,900 while the S&P 500 and 
Nasdaq Composite are also marginally lower.

All three indices hit new peaks on Tuesday.
 
Oil prices have slipped lower after their surge since the weekend’s agreement 
between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output.

The fall follows data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing 
a 4.7m weekly rise in US crude inventories compared to expectations of a 1.6m 
decline. Official figures from the US Energy Information Administration are due 
later.

Meanwhile Opec’s latest report showed a growing oil surplus next year unless 
members stick to their output curbs. Opec said with the cuts the 2017 overhang 
would reach 1.24m barrels a day, up 300,000 on its previous estimate.

Brent crude is currently down 1.29% at $55 a barrel.
 
Something for the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> to think about as they 
sign off on their latest interest rate decision, with the first rise for a year 
widely expected.

Retails sales growth cooled off in November after two months of strong gains. 
They edged up just 0.1% as consumers cut back on car purchases, while October’s 
figure was revised down from the initial 0.8% gain to 0.6%. Economists had been 
expecting a rise of 0.3%.

Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

Retailers will be more than a little disappointed with November’s drop in 
retail sales, as well as October’s revised figure, which overall leaves 
question marks hanging over the sector going in to the festive shopping season.

However, observers will point to the contentious presidential election as a 
prime reason for shoppers keeping their wallets closed amid the swirling 
uncertainty.

With retailers making the bulk of their profits in December, the sector will 
be hoping the lure of sales will be too tempting for shoppers to resist.

But signs of rising inflation have come from another set of data. US producer 
prices climbed 0.4% last month, the largest gain since June, after being 
unchanged in October. This is higher than the 0.1% increase expected by 
analysts. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said:

..What really grabs the attention is the 1.3% month on month rise in trade 
services. This is mainly due to wider margins in the wholesale and retail 
sector. And as such, could well be echoed in the November CPI release on 
December 15.

With the consensus expectation for only a 0.2% month on month increase in 
November’s headline CPI, we now think that the risk of a higher (say 0.4% month 
on month) figure is looking more likely.

If so, then headline inflation will rise from 1.6% in October, to 1.9% in 
November - in excess of the 1.7% year on year consensus estimate.

With markets looking for little further tightening from the Fed after what 
looks a near-certain rate hike today - the Fed may start to look as if it is 
either allowing the economy to run a little hot, or alternatively, falling 
behind the curve, unless today’s expected hike is coupled with more hawkish 
guidance.

With the UK employment figures out of the way, investors are waiting patiently 
for the Federal Reserve’s interest rates decision in six hours time.

European stock markets are basically flat (the FTSE 100 has lost 7 points, or 
0.1%), and Wall Street is expected to open quietly in 75 minutes time.

Back in the City, shares in British’s second largest pub chain have soared by 
a third as a takeover battle breaks out.

Punch Tavern is being pursued by Heineken, the Dutch brewer which produces 
Strongbow and Foster’s, and also by Alan McIntosh, one of Punch’s cofounders.

This two-way battle, broken by Sky’s Mark Kleinman this morning, has excited 
the City.

EXCLUSIVE: Heineken in secret takeover battle for Punch Taverns, group which 
owns 3300 pubs. Bidding against Punch co-founder Alan McIntosh.

Shares in Punch have rocketed by 35% to 172p, from 128p, a two-year high.

The company leases urban and rural pubs across the country to tenant 
landlords, and has been spending years tackling its huge debt pile build up 
before the financial crisis.

Punch has just issued a statement, confirming that it is in “advanced 
discussions” with the Heineken side, Patron Capital Advisers ,about an offer of 
174p per share.

It is also in “discussions” with McIntosh’s consortium, Emerald Investment 
Partners, which are offering 185p per share (subject to due diligence etc).

Punch cautions that:

There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by either Patron or 
Emerald. A further announcement will be made in due course.

Both groups have until 11 January to make a firm bid, or walk away.

That might not be the end of it, though -- industry regulators might have 
concerns about such a large pub estate changing hands, especially as Heineken 
already owns 1,100 leased pubs.

real wage growth is still below its pre-crisis levels (pay rises minus 
inflation).

They also warn that inflation could overtake pay rises in 2017, hitting 
workers with another pay squeeze:

Today’s report shows that there are now 4.75 million self-employed people in 
the UK, up 129,000 compared to last year.

Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, is 
urging the government to provide more help for these workers - who aren’t 
entitled to the full range of benefits which employees receive.

“The huge rise in self-employment since the recession must be met with action. 
There is much to do to improve our social security and financial systems in 
particular.

“Social security and our tax system have not kept up with the changing nature 
of 21st century work. It is urgent that Government gets to grips with the new 
reality of more people striking out on their own and working for themselves. In 
maternity, low pay, pensions and the housing market, the self-employed lose out 
from systems designed for a different age.

“The Government’s Taylor review is a crucial opportunity to help the wellbeing 
of the self-employed and the companies they start. Maternity support must be 
raised to a level closer with the employed and the design of Universal Credit 
changed so it’s no longer a threat to business start-ups. The financial system 
must ensure the self-employed have the same chance to buy their own homes and 
save for retirement as those in traditional employment.”
