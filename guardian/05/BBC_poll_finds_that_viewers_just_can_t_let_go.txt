He who lives by opinion polls and “consultations” must sometimes swallow his 
lumps. The BBC, offering listeners and viewers new digital and related services 
as more traditional channels (farewell, BBC3) disappear, wants its trust and 
audience enthusiasm to proceed. But the trust, with a little help from ICM, is 
sucking its thumb. “Most often, the concern is that new services will be funded 
by cutting existing services.” And, since you ask, “particularly in relation to 
the World Service, there are questions whether theBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> should fund certain services at all”.

There’s the rub. Viewers and listeners are ordinary mortals. They like what 
they’ve got: they don’t want to swap it for the forward-looking notions that 
Broadcasting House embraces for the future. No either/or please: just both. The 
best approach might be a simpler one: stop commissioning expensive pollsters to 
sprinkle fairy dust over your best ideas. Just do them.

■And so farewell, after only two years of trying and $500m (£347m) upfront, to 
al-Jazeera America, its cable life snapped and due to expire in April. You only 
reached into 60m US homes. You could only manage 28,000 primetime viewers at 
best – and a mere 19,000 through the day. You were mugged by MSNBC, clobbered 
by CNN and obliterated by Fox. You had your own view of the world, but America 
didn’t want to share it. Cause for regret and self-reproach? Not so much. The 
demise and all the jobs lost aren’t less a reflection on what you offered than 
a commentary on what America doesn’t want to know.
