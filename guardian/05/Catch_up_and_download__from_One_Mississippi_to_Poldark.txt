One Mississippi

Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical show comes with the advance notice of being 
one of the bleakest sitcoms of all time. In it, the standup comedian faces a 
cancer diagnosis and deals with the death of her mother; a period that has 
proved as fertile creatively as it was presumably traumatic in personal terms. 
Amazingly, the laughs do indeed come thick and fast, although the humour is 
overwhelmingly of the dark variety. It’s executive produced by Louis CK, who 
knows a thing or two about finessing misery into comedy.

Shark Jumping

This thoroughly entertaining web series on the Channel Awesome platform 
explores all manner of amusing TV trivia. Journalist hosts Beth and Tim are 
impressively strong on what can be found in the odder corners of telly’s 
extensive junkyard. Particular kudos goes to their evisceration of barely 
believable 1990s “at home with the Hitlers” sitcom pilot Heil Honey I’m Home, 
and there’s also an amusing look at the failed NBC attempt to remake The IT 
Crowd for the US market.Available now

Sky Box Sets

The Walking Dead

Feel like there’s simply too much joy in your life? Well, the 
planet-conquering necrotic bite-’em-up has landed on Sky Box Sets in full, 
providing an entirely natural antidote to all of those pesky laughter lines. 
With season seven kicking off in October, and the fate of Andrew Lincoln’s 
ragtag gaggle of survivors-but-for-how-long left teetering in the balance, it’s 
a perfect opportunity to catch up or finally see what all the fuss is about. 
Bleak as a Megabus odyssey, stressful, but still reliably excellent.Available 
from Monday

Intriguing import set in a near-future version of Australia. In it, an ancient 
species known as Hairypeople (pictured) are persecuted and exploited by the 
dominant human majority. Provocatively, the Hairies are played, seemingly 
exclusively, by indigenous Australians. But, actually, that looks like being 
merely one strand of a drama that promises a critique of the media, a touch of 
the supernatural and even a little body horror. Very promising.

With Aidan Turner flexing his threshing muscles in readiness for the new 
series of Poldark (which begins on BBC1 on Sunday), now is a good time to 
revisit the original, which was a huge hit back in 1975 and starred Robin Ellis 
as the titular hero smouldering charismatically through tough rural times.

Harry Shearer: Le Show

He has been at the heart of two of the funniest cultural phenomena of the last 
50 years – The Simpsons and This Is Spinal Tap – but Harry Shearer’s podcast 
doesn’t prioritise humour (although he’s still wonderfully wry). Instead, this 
is an off-centre ramble through hot-button issues such as cholera in Haiti, 
burqas in Europe and, inevitably, Trump in the United States. He may be the 
voice of C Montgomery Burns, but Shearer’s liberal credentials appear 
unimpeachable.
