Photo:Tina Fineberg/APThanks to the gaol house blog for noticing  
<http://gaolhouseblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/bright-eyes-and-books.html>the rather
astonishing list <http://www.artgarfunkel.com/library.html> on Art Garfunkel's 
officialwebsite <http://www.artgarfunkel.com/> of every book he has read in the 
last 30 years as a "voracious reader".

There must be some 1,000 books on the "Garfunkel library", which carefully 
records when the singer/songwriter/poet/actor read each book.

Whether or not you think the list is a work of slightly scary/sad obsession, 
you have to be impressed at how many highbrow works of literature or philosophy 
are in there. Shakespeare, Milton, Proust, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy all make the 
list, alongside a sprinkling of more modern books: an Arthur C Clarke, a Tom 
Wolfe, an Anne Rice.

Clicking through, I was feeling a little down at how cerebral the curly-haired 
one was and then I spotted what I had been looking for. The shaming entry for 
February 2004: Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code.

Goodness knows what a reader of Garfunkel's erudite tastes thought of it, or, 
for that matter, what he made of his apparently solitary exposure to the 
talents of Jeffrey Archer. Neither Archer or Brown are on hisfavourites  
<http://www.artgarfunkel.com/favorites.html>section though, I barely need to 
tell you.
