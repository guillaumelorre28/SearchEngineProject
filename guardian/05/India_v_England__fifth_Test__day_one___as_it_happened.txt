STUMPS: England 284-4

Overall a very good day for the tourists, who certainly had the better of the 
last two sessions, even if Bairstow is probably still kicking a chair to pieces 
in the dressing room for giving his wicket away on 49. “I’ve not always been 
Moeen’s most vocal supporter. But isn’t it a little odd that you can take a 
century from our No4 batsman, away from home, against India, so lightly?” asks 
George Rogers. “It’s been a problem position ever since we moved Root up the 
order and the revolving door of players to have come in there only to be chewed 
up and spat out is impressive. Now we take our bits and pieces No7, who we’ve 
spent two years trying to turn into a specialist spinner, promote him to No4 
and he scores a century. His second of the series.”

Yes, indeed, absolutely. It’s been a classic Moeen innings - plenty of lovely 
drives and a few loose moments, though I missed the period before lunch when 
Nasser Hussain says he resembled “a walking wicket”.

90th over: England 284-4 (Moeen 120, Stokes 5) The batsmen spend a while 
before the over begins exchanging gloves and bumping fists and generally 
strolling around in a transparent attempt to delay over No91 until tomorrow. 
Then Sharma starts bowling, and Stokes could have used up a bit more time had 
he actually hit the ball at any point - four balls are left entirely, and two 
defended - but it was enough.

89th over: England 284-4 (Moeen 120, Stokes 5) Jadeja replaces Ashwin, but his 
final over of the day (presumably) brings a couple of runs for Moeen, but 
little drama. “I congratulate you on your campaign to downplay the significance 
of scoring 100 runs and thereby negating any criticism of Joe Root’s failure to 
move from double to triple figures often enough” writes Stuart Hetherington. 
“Barely acknowledging Moeen’s passage from 99 to 100 is an important first shot 
in the campaign. Keep it up.” I did mention it, but I thought we’d established 
that it was just an arbitrary target of no logical significance.

88th over: England 282-4 (Moeen 118, Stokes 5) Moeen goes for another square 
drive but he doesn’t time this one. Still, the result’s the same: he 
inside-edges well wide of the stumps, back past Patel and gets four runs for 
it. The last delivery at Stokes moves away slightly off the seam and flies just 
past the bat. Nicely bowled.

86th over: England 274-4 (Moeen 110, Stokes 5) Ishant comes back, sends down a 
couple of dots with the old ball and then takes the new one, which is promptly 
despatched past point and to the rope by Moeen, and then driven (not far, and 
in the air) wide of cover for four more.

85th over: England 265-4 (Moeen 101, Stokes 5) Ashwin bowls, and the batsmen 
score a single each. There are five overs left today and a new ball ready to 
roll, but India are happy to stick with the old one for now.

bisects the two cover fielders with another lovely drive to find the rope. A 
single off the next, and it’s bat-waving time.

83rd over: England 256-4 (Moeen 95, Stokes 2) My mistake, the fresh cherry 
remains in its wrapping. Still, Ashwin is bowling, so that’s something. And 
with Bairstow gone, Michael Vaughan’s calendar-year Test scoring record remains 
intact for now. Root requires 11 runs in the second innings to break it, and 
Bairstow 13.
The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) 
If Root and Bairstow score 61 between them in 2nd inns it will be 1st time two 
team-mates have scored 3,000 combined in a Test year

81st over: England 253-4 (Moeen 94, Stokes 0) The wicket falls from the final 
delivery of the over, and Bairstow departs in manifest frustration, swishing 
his bat wildly, and tossing his gloves away in fury.

WICKET! Bairstow c Rahul b Jadeja 49 (England 253-4)

Bairstow will not reach his round number. He drives in the air straight into 
the midriff of Rahul at cover, who doesn’t have to move his feet and barely has 
to move his hands either.

80th over: England 252-3 (Moeen 94, Bairstow 49) English fans of round numbers 
must be extraordinarily excited - the team has just tickled past 250, and both 
batsmen are on the verge of either full or half centuries. Happy times.

79th over: England 247-3 (Moeen 90, Bairstow 48) Maiden over from Jadeja. It 
should be said that Michael Vaughan, who is in first place, had three fewer 
matches in which to accumulate his runs. The two all-time all-country leaders, 
Mohammad Yousuf (2006) and Lord Vivian of Richards (1976), had three fewer 
still, with 11, and are some 300 runs distant.

runs of England’s all-time record for Test runs in a calendary year today, 
could end the day in third place. Bairstow is hot on his heels, and only 18 
away from taking top spot himself now.

77th over: England 244-3 (Moeen 89, Bairstow 46) Bairstow pushes the ball to 
cover and sets off on a single, and the fielding is so good Nasser Hussain on 
commentary immediately credits it to Jadeja, but in fact it’s Rahul. Either 
way, he dives on the ball, spins and returns it at pace to Parthiv Patel in 
double-quick time, and the run is only just completed.

76th over: England 243-3 (Moeen 89, Bairstow 45) The players take drinks. 
England have been pretty untroubled since tea, and indeed for most of the time 
since lunch, and if that doesn’t cause an immediate collapse I don’t know what 
will. India have no reviews remaining, having lost one on nearly getting Moeen 
out a couple of overs back.

bowling of the innings, and it’s pretty uneventful stuff, England taking four 
singles.

74th over: England 235-3 (Moeen 84, Bairstow 42) Amit Mishra bowls, and Moeen 
survives a review here by the slenderest of skin-tight margins. The on-field 
umpire, Simon Fry, turns down a very loud lbw appeal, India review and get two 
reds and an orange, the ball being on its way to hitting leg stump pretty 
emphatically, but not quite emphatically enough to overturn the on-field 
decision.

73rd over: England 233-3 (Moeen 83, Bairstow 41) Bairstow works the ball down 
towards deep backward point. Luckily India have a fielder in the way, but 
unluckily it’s Ashwin, who goes down in instalments and it rolls embarrassingly 
under his body. Still, the ball’s moving slowly enough for him to get up, brush 
himself down, catch up with it and return it to the middle for the cost of only 
two runs.

71st over: England 223-3 (Moeen 74, Bairstow 38) Ooof! Bairstow perhaps gets a 
bit greedy, goes down the ground to Jadeja and doesn’t read the flight of the 
ball at all. Fortunately he gets a slight edge on it, because that was a 
stumping waiting to happen.

70th over: England 221-3 (Moeen 74, Bairstow 38) Moeen spoons the ball 
straight back to Ashwin, a puzzlingly loose shot, and he is extremely fortunate 
that it lands a foot short of the bowler’s hands. He drives the next through 
the covers for three.

69th over: England 217-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 37) Bairstow paddles the ball 
over his left shoulder towards deep fine leg, forcing Kohli to sprint from slip 
to chase it down. The two resulting runs bring up the 50 partnership, in which 
Bairstow has been responsible for 74% of the scoring.

68th over: England 215-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 35) And he does it again! Like in 
the last over, Bairstow slog sweeps for a maximum! There have only been 73 
England Test innings in all of history with three or more sixes in them, fact 
fans.

67th over: England 208-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 28) Bairstow absolutely thunders 
Jadeja’s first delivery over midwicket for a massive six. He hasn’t scored a 
four yet, but that’s his second maximum. He only needs nine more to take a 
joint share of England’s all-time sixes-in-an-innings record, set by Ben Stokes 
in the first Test of the year.

66th over: England 201-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 21) “I think Jonathan Gresty 
(over 63) has somewhat missed the point,” writes Martin Sinclair. “You don’t 
get bonus points for converting fifties into centuries but you do get more 
runs. 88 elegant runs don’t win you the match whereas Kohli’s mammoth centuries 
do. But Joe Root has the highest average on this tour, so we shouldn’t knock 
him. Here’s to reliving the halcyon days of the 80s when we were dynamite at 
winning dead rubbers.”

64th over: England 199-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 19) Moeen smashes Ashwin to the 
long off boundary, the ball bouncing a foot inside the rope, and then the next 
ball skims off his glove but lands a couple of feet short of slip. “Exactly how 
many overs has Ashwin bowled?” asks Amod Paranjape. “He takes exactly 14 overs 
to claim his first wicket and from then on its top gear for him.” Um, 17.

63rd over: England 192-3 (Moeen 66, Bairstow 17) Umesh bowls wide at Bairstow, 
who stretches to reach it and inside-edges into the ground and behind. A 
totally uncontrolled shot, though the ball was never going to end up hitting 
the stumps. Later Bairstow smashes through the covers, only for Jadeja to dive 
to his left and pluck the speeding ball from the air as if he were catching a 
snowflake. Great fielding. “I too have little time for conversion rates 
especially if they’re being used as an opportunity to knock Joe Root,” writes 
Jonathan Gresty. “It’s not as if you get bonus points for getting centuries, 
after all. Perhaps we shouldn’t fixate so much about them.”

61st over: England 185-3 (Moeen 65, Bairstow 11) Umesh Yadav gets the final 
session of the day under way, and a few singles are scored.

“Who are all these pessimistic emailers of which you write?” wonders Andrew 
Benton. “What brought on the gloom? Are they unhappy at not attending the 
Guardian Christmas party? The first test of any series is for sizing up the 
opposition, the second for testing their mettle, the third for all out war, the 
fourth for a strategic victory, but the fifth is just for fun. Yes, we’ll lose, 
but who cares, there’s the whole one day series to look forward to, soon. Which 
we’ll lose. West Indies series? Would be suprised if we didn’t contrive to lose 
that too. Enjoy. And if we win, be happy.” That’s the spirit!

Waiter, I’ll have what he’s having.

Right, I’m back, the players are back, and we’re good to go. It looks very 
dark, but that’s probably just because a TV producer somewhere needs to fiddle 
with a knob. Or something.

TEA: England 182-3

And that’s the interval. From 68-2 at lunch to 182-3 at tea, that’s got to go 
down as England’s session, however angry Root is about developments.

Root:
First 21 scores of 50+ in Tests: converted 8 of them = 38%
Last 17 scores of 50+ in Tests: converted 3 of them = 18%

60th over: England 182-3 (Moeen 63, Bairstow 10) Bairstow sends the ball 
looping into the hands of the man at midwicket. India celebrate, but there’s no 
immediate finger-raising from the umpire. After a brief chat, however, they 
send it upstairs while indicating a belief that it is in all probability out. 
Baistow, meanwhile and most tellingly, is happily discussing the weather with 
Moeen, totally unbothered, and sure enough, replays show the ball going 
straight from bat to ground before bouncing back up again.

Blimey. That was a bit blatant wasn't it ? #INDvENG

59th over: England 179-3 (Moeen 62, Bairstow 8) From nowhere, after a cautious 
opening to his innings, Bairstow sends the last ball of Jadeja’s over down the 
ground for six. “I didn’t say it would effect his skippership I said it would 
impact on his batting,” clarifies Felix Wood. “I think long periods of 
concentration are his downfall, as they are for the entire younger generation 
with their Twitter and their internet and their loud music and low-slung 
trousers and youthful optimism but they’ll learn. They’ll learn alright. Dreams 
crumble, the world is flawed. Deal with it, snowflake.” Good point. So long as 
the England coaches encourage him to check Facebook every drinks break, he may 
just pull through.

58th over: England 171-3 (Moeen 61, Bairstow 1) A couple of singles here, from 
Sharma’s latest over. “It seems churlish to complain of Root’s conversion rate 
(such an empty Blairite phrase) when he consistently contributes,” writes Ian 
Copestake. “It’s not as if he is doing a Ramps and getting out in the not in 
the least bit nervous 30s.”

56th over: England 169-3 (Moeen 60, Bairstow 0) Sharma now replaces Mishra, 
with a new batsman to aim at. Although he doesn’t actually aim at him, sending 
all six deliveries down at Moeen. “While Root is clearly our best batsman, his 
conversion rate is dreadful,” complains Felix Wood. “It does make me even more 
sceptical that he has the mental toughness to be captain without his batting 
suffering.” Interesting theory, though I’m not sure that whatever it is that 
makes him wobble as he nears a potential century would also impact on his 
skippership.
Simon Wilde (@swildecricket) 
Root has failed to go from 75 to 100 seven times in last ten: 85 88 110 76 80 
254 124 78 77 88 (the last three in the last three Tests)

55th over: England 167-3 (Moeen 58, Bairstow 0) Root is undone by an 
optimistic, uncertain but ultimately decent review, but though Kohli was pretty 
sure at slip, nobody else seemed so convinced. “In an effort to up the 
positivity, can I suggest that we are very lucky to have Nasser Hussain’s 
commentary,” writes Ian Copestake. Yes, you can. “He seems to open up avenues 
of analysis and observation that a hick like me appreciates hugely, such as the 
point about how Root improves the players he plays with as his style brings 
them along in his flow. Shame he is out now as the ship becomes vulnerable once 
more.”

WICKET! Root c Parthiv b Jadeja 88 (England 163-3)

A good review here for India, UltraEdge showing that the ball just flicked the 
underside of Root’s swishing bat on its way through. Root’s furious about it, 
all angry muttering and occasional air-kicks on his way back to the 
dressing-room.

54th over: England 164-2 (Moeen 57, Root 87) A Mishra maiden. Chennai’s MA 
Chidambaram Stadium is a quiet and sparsely-populated open space today, and 
thus in every possible way the opposite of the heaving, noisy London bar where 
the Guardian’s sports desk held its Xmas party last night. And all the better 
for it, obviously.

53rd over: England 164-2 (Moeen 57, Root 87) Record alert! Root is apparently 
but a dozen runs from history. Moeen, meanwhile, reverse-sweeps with the back 
of his bat, but gets no runs for it.
George Dobell (@GeorgeDobell1) 
If Root makes 99 - and my maths is ok - he'll set record for most Test runs in 
calendar year by England player. Currently Vaughan with 1481.

52nd over: England 163-2 (Moeen 56, Root 86) Moeen smacks Mishra high but 
safe, wide of mid-off for four. His last four innings: 5, 50, 0, and now 56. 
Moeen hasn’t reached double figures in both innings of a Test since Chittagong 
in October, five-and-a-bit matches ago. So, in short, don’t get excited about 
innings two.

49th over: England 147-2 (Moeen 43, Root 83) Root sweeps very nicely for four. 
His current record of six 50s in six Tests (well, five and a bit) in India is 
impressive. But not unbeatable: Andy Flower scored seven in five.

48th over: England 141-2 (Moeen 43, Root 77) Crikey, you’re a pessimistic 
bunch this morning. My first emails of the day include Lawrent Baldoni’s “Good 
fightback from these two but if we’ve learned anything from this series it’s 
that even if we were 350 for 3 you’d still fancy India to school us”, and Simon 
Ward’s “I’m looking forward to watching India rack up 800 against the England 
attack. A great way to ease into the Christmas period.”

Moeen Ali century gives England a strong platform against India
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/16/england-india-moeen-ali-century-fifth-test> 
And that’s your lot for today. We’ll be back bright and early/late/whatever to 
see what day two has in store for us. Bye!
 
Overall a very good day for the tourists, who certainly had the better of the 
last two sessions, even if Bairstow is probably still kicking a chair to pieces 
in the dressing room for giving his wicket away on 49. “I’ve not always been 
Moeen’s most vocal supporter. But isn’t it a little odd that you can take a 
century from our No4 batsman, away from home, against India, so lightly?” asks 
George Rogers. “It’s been a problem position ever since we moved Root up the 
order and the revolving door of players to have come in there only to be chewed 
up and spat out is impressive. Now we take our bits and pieces No7, who we’ve 
spent two years trying to turn into a specialist spinner, promote him to No4 
and he scores a century. His second of the series.”

Yes, indeed, absolutely. It’s been a classic Moeen innings - plenty of lovely 
drives and a few loose moments, though I missed the period before lunch when 
Nasser Hussain says he resembled “a walking wicket”.

90th over: England 284-4 (Moeen 120, Stokes 5) The batsmen spend a while 
before the over begins exchanging gloves and bumping fists and generally 
strolling around in a transparent attempt to delay over No91 until tomorrow. 
Then Sharma starts bowling, and Stokes could have used up a bit more time had 
he actually hit the ball at any point - four balls are left entirely, and two 
defended - but it was enough.
 
89th over: England 284-4 (Moeen 120, Stokes 5) Jadeja replaces Ashwin, but his 
final over of the day (presumably) brings a couple of runs for Moeen, but 
little drama. “I congratulate you on your campaign to downplay the significance 
of scoring 100 runs and thereby negating any criticism of Joe Root’s failure to 
move from double to triple figures often enough” writes Stuart Hetherington. 
“Barely acknowledging Moeen’s passage from 99 to 100 is an important first shot 
in the campaign. Keep it up.” I did mention it, but I thought we’d established 
that it was just an arbitrary target of no logical significance.
 
88th over: England 282-4 (Moeen 118, Stokes 5) Moeen goes for another square 
drive but he doesn’t time this one. Still, the result’s the same: he 
inside-edges well wide of the stumps, back past Patel and gets four runs for 
it. The last delivery at Stokes moves away slightly off the seam and flies just 
past the bat. Nicely bowled.
 
87th over: England 275-4 (Moeen 111, Stokes 5) Ashwin keeps going with the new 
ball, and after Moeen takes a single off the first Stokes flat-bats the rest.
 
86th over: England 274-4 (Moeen 110, Stokes 5) Ishant comes back, sends down a 
couple of dots with the old ball and then takes the new one, which is promptly 
despatched past point and to the rope by Moeen, and then driven (not far, and 
in the air) wide of cover for four more.
 
85th over: England 265-4 (Moeen 101, Stokes 5) Ashwin bowls, and the batsmen 
score a single each. There are five overs left today and a new ball ready to 
roll, but India are happy to stick with the old one for now.
 
84th over: England 263-4 (Moeen 100, Stokes 4) Mishra continues, and Moeen 
bisects the two cover fielders with another lovely drive to find the rope. A 
single off the next, and it’s bat-waving time.

83rd over: England 256-4 (Moeen 95, Stokes 2) My mistake, the fresh cherry 
remains in its wrapping. Still, Ashwin is bowling, so that’s something. And 
with Bairstow gone, Michael Vaughan’s calendar-year Test scoring record remains 
intact for now. Root requires 11 runs in the second innings to break it, and 
Bairstow 13.

82nd over: England 255-4 (Moeen 95, Stokes 1) One last over for Mishra, and at 
the end of it India take the new ball, and hand it straight to Ashwin.
 
81st over: England 253-4 (Moeen 94, Stokes 0) The wicket falls from the final 
delivery of the over, and Bairstow departs in manifest frustration, swishing 
his bat wildly, and tossing his gloves away in fury.
 
Bairstow will not reach his round number. He drives in the air straight into 
the midriff of Rahul at cover, who doesn’t have to move his feet and barely has 
to move his hands either.

80th over: England 252-3 (Moeen 94, Bairstow 49) English fans of round numbers 
must be extraordinarily excited - the team has just tickled past 250, and both 
batsmen are on the verge of either full or half centuries. Happy times.
 
79th over: England 247-3 (Moeen 90, Bairstow 48) Maiden over from Jadeja. It 
should be said that Michael Vaughan, who is in first place, had three fewer 
matches in which to accumulate his runs. The two all-time all-country leaders, 
Mohammad Yousuf (2006) and Lord Vivian of Richards (1976), had three fewer 
still, with 11, and are some 300 runs distant.
 
78th over: England 247-3 (Moeen 90, Bairstow 48) Root, having got within 10 
runs of England’s all-time record for Test runs in a calendary year today, 
could end the day in third place. Bairstow is hot on his heels, and only 18 
away from taking top spot himself now.
 
77th over: England 244-3 (Moeen 89, Bairstow 46) Bairstow pushes the ball to 
cover and sets off on a single, and the fielding is so good Nasser Hussain on 
commentary immediately credits it to Jadeja, but in fact it’s Rahul. Either 
way, he dives on the ball, spins and returns it at pace to Parthiv Patel in 
double-quick time, and the run is only just completed.
 
76th over: England 243-3 (Moeen 89, Bairstow 45) The players take drinks. 
England have been pretty untroubled since tea, and indeed for most of the time 
since lunch, and if that doesn’t cause an immediate collapse I don’t know what 
will. India have no reviews remaining, having lost one on nearly getting Moeen 
out a couple of overs back.
 
75th over: England 239-3 (Moeen 86, Bairstow 44) Karun Nair does his first 
bowling of the innings, and it’s pretty uneventful stuff, England taking four 
singles.
 
74th over: England 235-3 (Moeen 84, Bairstow 42) Amit Mishra bowls, and Moeen 
survives a review here by the slenderest of skin-tight margins. The on-field 
umpire, Simon Fry, turns down a very loud lbw appeal, India review and get two 
reds and an orange, the ball being on its way to hitting leg stump pretty 
emphatically, but not quite emphatically enough to overturn the on-field 
decision.
 
73rd over: England 233-3 (Moeen 83, Bairstow 41) Bairstow works the ball down 
towards deep backward point. Luckily India have a fielder in the way, but 
unluckily it’s Ashwin, who goes down in instalments and it rolls embarrassingly 
under his body. Still, the ball’s moving slowly enough for him to get up, brush 
himself down, catch up with it and return it to the middle for the cost of only 
two runs.
 
72nd over: England 230-3 (Moeen 82, Bairstow 39) Lovely drive from Moeen, who 
eases the ball past point for four. Class.
 
71st over: England 223-3 (Moeen 74, Bairstow 38) Ooof! Bairstow perhaps gets a 
bit greedy, goes down the ground to Jadeja and doesn’t read the flight of the 
ball at all. Fortunately he gets a slight edge on it, because that was a 
stumping waiting to happen.
 
70th over: England 221-3 (Moeen 74, Bairstow 38) Moeen spoons the ball 
straight back to Ashwin, a puzzlingly loose shot, and he is extremely fortunate 
that it lands a foot short of the bowler’s hands. He drives the next through 
the covers for three.
 
69th over: England 217-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 37) Bairstow paddles the ball 
over his left shoulder towards deep fine leg, forcing Kohli to sprint from slip 
to chase it down. The two resulting runs bring up the 50 partnership, in which 
Bairstow has been responsible for 74% of the scoring.
 
68th over: England 215-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 35) And he does it again! Like in 
the last over, Bairstow slog sweeps for a maximum! There have only been 73 
England Test innings in all of history with three or more sixes in them, fact 
fans.
 
67th over: England 208-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 28) Bairstow absolutely thunders 
Jadeja’s first delivery over midwicket for a massive six. He hasn’t scored a 
four yet, but that’s his second maximum. He only needs nine more to take a 
joint share of England’s all-time sixes-in-an-innings record, set by Ben Stokes 
in the first Test of the year.
 
66th over: England 201-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 21) “I think Jonathan Gresty 
(over 63) has somewhat missed the point,” writes Martin Sinclair. “You don’t 
get bonus points for converting fifties into centuries but you do get more 
runs. 88 elegant runs don’t win you the match whereas Kohli’s mammoth centuries 
do. But Joe Root has the highest average on this tour, so we shouldn’t knock 
him. Here’s to reliving the halcyon days of the 80s when we were dynamite at 
winning dead rubbers.”
 
65th over: England 200-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 20) Just a single off Jadeja’s 
over, but it was the single that took England to 200 runs.
 
64th over: England 199-3 (Moeen 71, Bairstow 19) Moeen smashes Ashwin to the 
long off boundary, the ball bouncing a foot inside the rope, and then the next 
ball skims off his glove but lands a couple of feet short of slip. “Exactly how 
many overs has Ashwin bowled?” asks Amod Paranjape. “He takes exactly 14 overs 
to claim his first wicket and from then on its top gear for him.” Um, 17.
 
63rd over: England 192-3 (Moeen 66, Bairstow 17) Umesh bowls wide at Bairstow, 
who stretches to reach it and inside-edges into the ground and behind. A 
totally uncontrolled shot, though the ball was never going to end up hitting 
the stumps. Later Bairstow smashes through the covers, only for Jadeja to dive 
to his left and pluck the speeding ball from the air as if he were catching a 
snowflake. Great fielding. “I too have little time for conversion rates 
especially if they’re being used as an opportunity to knock Joe Root,” writes 
Jonathan Gresty. “It’s not as if you get bonus points for getting centuries, 
after all. Perhaps we shouldn’t fixate so much about them.”

 
62nd over: England 187-3 (Moeen 66, Bairstow 12) Ashwin bowls, and England get 
another couple of singles. In other news, the TV man has found his knob.

61st over: England 185-3 (Moeen 65, Bairstow 11) Umesh Yadav gets the final 
session of the day under way, and a few singles are scored.

“Who are all these pessimistic emailers of which you write?” wonders Andrew 
Benton. “What brought on the gloom? Are they unhappy at not attending the 
Guardian Christmas party? The first test of any series is for sizing up the 
opposition, the second for testing their mettle, the third for all out war, the 
fourth for a strategic victory, but the fifth is just for fun. Yes, we’ll lose, 
but who cares, there’s the whole one day series to look forward to, soon. Which 
we’ll lose. West Indies series? Would be suprised if we didn’t contrive to lose 
that too. Enjoy. And if we win, be happy.” That’s the spirit!

Waiter, I’ll have what he’s having.
 
Right, I’m back, the players are back, and we’re good to go. It looks very 
dark, but that’s probably just because a TV producer somewhere needs to fiddle 
with a knob. Or something.
 
And that’s the interval. From 68-2 at lunch to 182-3 at tea, that’s got to go 
down as England’s session, however angry Root is about developments.

Root:
First 21 scores of 50+ in Tests: converted 8 of them = 38%
Last 17 scores of 50+ in Tests: converted 3 of them = 18%

60th over: England 182-3 (Moeen 63, Bairstow 10) Bairstow sends the ball 
looping into the hands of the man at midwicket. India celebrate, but there’s no 
immediate finger-raising from the umpire. After a brief chat, however, they 
send it upstairs while indicating a belief that it is in all probability out. 
Baistow, meanwhile and most tellingly, is happily discussing the weather with 
Moeen, totally unbothered, and sure enough, replays show the ball going 
straight from bat to ground before bouncing back up again.

Blimey. That was a bit blatant wasn't it ? #INDvENG

59th over: England 179-3 (Moeen 62, Bairstow 8) From nowhere, after a cautious 
opening to his innings, Bairstow sends the last ball of Jadeja’s over down the 
ground for six. “I didn’t say it would effect his skippership I said it would 
impact on his batting,” clarifies Felix Wood. “I think long periods of 
concentration are his downfall, as they are for the entire younger generation 
with their Twitter and their internet and their loud music and low-slung 
trousers and youthful optimism but they’ll learn. They’ll learn alright. Dreams 
crumble, the world is flawed. Deal with it, snowflake.” Good point. So long as 
the England coaches encourage him to check Facebook every drinks break, he may 
just pull through.
 
58th over: England 171-3 (Moeen 61, Bairstow 1) A couple of singles here, from 
Sharma’s latest over. “It seems churlish to complain of Root’s conversion rate 
(such an empty Blairite phrase) when he consistently contributes,” writes Ian 
Copestake. “It’s not as if he is doing a Ramps and getting out in the not in 
the least bit nervous 30s.”
 
57th over: England 169-3 (Moeen 60, Bairstow 0) A maiden from Jadeja, just the 
third maiden overall since the 10th over of the innings.
 
56th over: England 169-3 (Moeen 60, Bairstow 0) Sharma now replaces Mishra, 
with a new batsman to aim at. Although he doesn’t actually aim at him, sending 
all six deliveries down at Moeen. “While Root is clearly our best batsman, his 
conversion rate is dreadful,” complains Felix Wood. “It does make me even more 
sceptical that he has the mental toughness to be captain without his batting 
suffering.” Interesting theory, though I’m not sure that whatever it is that 
makes him wobble as he nears a potential century would also impact on his 
skippership.
Simon Wilde (@swildecricket) 
Root has failed to go from 75 to 100 seven times in last ten: 85 88 110 76 80 
254 124 78 77 88 (the last three in the last three Tests)

55th over: England 167-3 (Moeen 58, Bairstow 0) Root is undone by an 
optimistic, uncertain but ultimately decent review, but though Kohli was pretty 
sure at slip, nobody else seemed so convinced. “In an effort to up the 
positivity, can I suggest that we are very lucky to have Nasser Hussain’s 
commentary,” writes Ian Copestake. Yes, you can. “He seems to open up avenues 
of analysis and observation that a hick like me appreciates hugely, such as the 
point about how Root improves the players he plays with as his style brings 
them along in his flow. Shame he is out now as the ship becomes vulnerable once 
more.”
 
A good review here for India, UltraEdge showing that the ball just flicked the 
underside of Root’s swishing bat on its way through. Root’s furious about it, 
all angry muttering and occasional air-kicks on his way back to the 
dressing-room.

54th over: England 164-2 (Moeen 57, Root 87) A Mishra maiden. Chennai’s MA 
Chidambaram Stadium is a quiet and sparsely-populated open space today, and 
thus in every possible way the opposite of the heaving, noisy London bar where 
the Guardian’s sports desk held its Xmas party last night. And all the better 
for it, obviously.

 
53rd over: England 164-2 (Moeen 57, Root 87) Record alert! Root is apparently 
but a dozen runs from history. Moeen, meanwhile, reverse-sweeps with the back 
of his bat, but gets no runs for it.
George Dobell (@GeorgeDobell1) 
If Root makes 99 - and my maths is ok - he'll set record for most Test runs in 
calendar year by England player. Currently Vaughan with 1481.

52nd over: England 163-2 (Moeen 56, Root 86) Moeen smacks Mishra high but 
safe, wide of mid-off for four. His last four innings: 5, 50, 0, and now 56. 
Moeen hasn’t reached double figures in both innings of a Test since Chittagong 
in October, five-and-a-bit matches ago. So, in short, don’t get excited about 
innings two.
 
51st over: England 157-2 (Moeen 51, Root 84) And now Moeen does have a fifty, 
completed in most relaxed style with a gentle push to long-on and a slow, 
bat-waving jog to the other end.

50th over: England 154-2 (Moeen 49, Root 84) Moeen moves to the brink of a 
half-century of his own by flaying the ball wide of past mid-off for four, and 
then grabbing a further single.
 
49th over: England 147-2 (Moeen 43, Root 83) Root sweeps very nicely for four. 
His current record of six 50s in six Tests (well, five and a bit) in India is 
impressive. But not unbeatable: Andy Flower scored seven in five.
 
48th over: England 141-2 (Moeen 43, Root 77) Crikey, you’re a pessimistic 
bunch this morning. My first emails of the day include Lawrent Baldoni’s “Good 
fightback from these two but if we’ve learned anything from this series it’s 
that even if we were 350 for 3 you’d still fancy India to school us”, and Simon 
Ward’s “I’m looking forward to watching India rack up 800 against the England 
attack. A great way to ease into the Christmas period.”
