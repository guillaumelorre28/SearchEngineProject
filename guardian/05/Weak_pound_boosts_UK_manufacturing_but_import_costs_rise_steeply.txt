Expansion in British factories slowed a little in October as the weak pound 
boosted exports but also pushed the prices of imports sharply higher.

In the latest sign that consumers in the UK will face higher prices

 since the Brexit vote, manufacturers raised the price of their goods at the 
fastest rate in more than five years.

The latest Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers’ index) survey 
suggested that firms are starting to pass on higher import costs as the weak 
pound makes raw materials such as oil more expensive.

However, the weak exchange rate also helped to boost orders from the US, the 
EU and China.

The broader survey suggested the sector got off to a decent start in the 
fourth quarter. The headline index combining output, orders, and employment 
fell to 54.3 in October, from 55.5 in September, where anything above 50 
signals expansion.

Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, and an author of the report, said 
themanufacturing sector

growth in the fourth quarter, after shrinking by 1% in the third.

He added: “On the positive side, the boost to competitiveness [from the weak 
pound] drove new export order inflows higher, providing a key support to output 
volumes. The downside of the weaker currency is becoming increasingly evident, 
however, with increased import prices leading to one of the steepest rises in 
purchasing costs in the near 25-year survey history.

“Inflationary pressure was also experienced at the factory gate, with average 
selling prices rising at the steepest pace since mid-2011.”

Capital Economics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> warned that 
the data suggested consumer prices would “pick up sharply” in the next few 
months.

The UK economy has shown more resilience than expected since the EU referendum 
 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>on 23 June. Official 
figures published last week showedthe economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter 
between July and September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-shrugs-off-brexit-uncertainty-with-05-growth>
. It was slower than the 0.7% growth in the second quarter, but stronger than 
economists expected and ruled out the possibility of a recession in the second 
half of 2016.

A stronger-than-expected performance has fuelled expectations that the Bank of 
England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) will refrain from cutting interest 
rates on Thursday, instead holding them at a record low of 0.25%.


Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said: “The 
decent October manufacturing purchasing survey reinforces belief that the Bank 
of England will be sitting tight on monetary policy on Thursday after the 
November MPC meeting.”
