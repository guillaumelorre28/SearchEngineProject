There is a debate as to which type of internet bank provides the best value. 

The high street banks, which provide online banking as an additional service, 
say standalone banks such asSmile <http://www.smile.co.uk> and Egg 
<http://www.egg.com> are operating at loss creating rates. 

They claim that, as more and more customers join these banks to take advantage 
of higher interest rates, the rates will become increasingly difficult to 
sustain and the banks will be paying out more than they expected.

Standard advice when buying any financial product is to check the financial 
history of the providers. Look at the long-term performance of the banks before 
choosing. Of course, as relatively new start-ups, the standalone banks will not 
have long term performance figures, but many are usually backed by more 
traditional companies so an investigation of their financial history may 
suffice.

In addition, consumer groups say it is very easy to make a mistake on the 
internet. For example, when transferring £1,000, you might press the 0 too many 
times and transfer £10,000. In this case, it is your responsibility to contact 
whoever the £10,000 was transferred to in order to get it back.
