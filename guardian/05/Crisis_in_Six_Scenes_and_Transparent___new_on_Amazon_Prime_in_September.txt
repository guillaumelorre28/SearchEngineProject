 he’s chalked it up as? Only a matter of weeks until we find out for certain.

The Collection (new episodes every Friday from 2 September)
Set in an atelier in postwar Paris, The Collection could soon overtake Mad Men 
in the stylish TV show stakes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/01/step-aside-mad-men-the-collection-is-now-the-best-dressed-show-on-tv>
. Created by Oliver Goldstick, who also worked on Ugly Betty and Pretty Little 
Liars, it’s clear from the get-go that there will be gorgeous costumes, wild 
parties and dark, probably Nazi pasts.

Transparent (available from 23 September)
Brace yourself for more fun with the Pfeffermans. Maura (Jeffrey Tambor) edges 
ever closer to gender reassignment surgery, while Sarah sets up a religious 
movement (and continues to explore her newfound BDSM fetish) and the whole 
family take a cruise together. Let’s just hope it’s as poignant and brilliant 
as the last two outings.

Halt and Catch Fire (new episodes every Tuesday)
It’s high time the cult 80s computer drama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/22/halt-and-catch-fire-amc-set-visit-kerry-bishe>
 broke into the big time. In its third series, punky tech startup Mutiny has 
moved to California in the nascent days of Silicon Valley and co-founders Donna 
and Cameron are already tired of the bald, bland West Coast sexism. Meanwhile, 
former colleagues turned foes Joe and Gordon may have to face that they 
actually need each other to scale the summit of the tech world.

One Mississippi (new episodes every Friday from 9 September)
Standup comic turned cult star Tig Notaro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/11/tig-notaro-people-wanting-take-care-look-good>
 has appeared in many TV shows before – from The Office to Community, 
Transparent to Inside Amy Schumer. Now, she’s created this 
semi-autobiographical black comedy about a woman returning to her home town as 
her mother lays dying.

Southern belle Scarlett O’Hara (played by Vivien Leigh) and lovable rogue 
Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) still shine luxuriantly after all these years – in 
spite of the grotesque politics. All together now: “Frankly, my dear, I don’t 
give a damn.”
