Alan Plater <http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/alanplater>'s series Oliver's 
Travels <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112109/> is a mystery, and two of the key 
questions are: who and where is the Guardian crossword setter Aristotle?

There's also a bunch of murders, some arson and a massive conspiracy, but it 
begins when Oliver, a lecturer in comparative religion, is made redundant and 
travels off to find his favourite setter, stumbling on the crimes by mistake.

As he becomes amorously involved and hired goons start trying to kill him, the 
crossword solvers in the audience might worry that Aristotle is a meremacguffin 
<http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/hitch/tour6.html>. They can rest easy: 
Oliver is soon stopping to pick up Guardians at little newsagents on his 
journey from Rhondda to Orkney - there's a pervading sense of place - and the 
clues keep providing, well, clues: driving the action, yielding unhurriedly and 
playfully, like a good crossword.

Yep, Oliver's Travels is a drama from a time when the BBC would make a ludic 
miniseries about an academic's slow-burning romance with a middle-aged WPC, 
kindled as they natter about Restoration comedianGeorge Farquhar 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Farquhar>. It's 1995, so characters 
wielding mobile phones are a little suspect and probably associated with one of 
those "PLC"s, and denial-of-service attacks are carried out by 
three-and-a-half-inch floppy disk and make a "pshoo" sound.

The world of the setter is likewise pre-digital, affectionately and - to my 
eyes - authentically rendered when we're given glimpses of the elusive 
Aristotle at work. Hey, aLongman Crossword Key

As well as the romance, this is a story about the relationship between setter 
and solver. Though Plater wrote the part for Tom Courtenay, Oliver is played by 
a greyingAlan Bates 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/dec/29/guardianobituaries.filmnews>, a 
long way from A Kind of Loving, as a wounded soft soul who lets wordplay help 
in life's decisions. He's a serious solver who enthuses that Aristotle is "the 
best in the business - theTimes <http://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/>, the Observer 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords>, the Listener 
<http://www.listenercrossword.com/>, rest its soul - we've corresponded for 
many years."

(A mark docked here: following the demise of the Listener magazine, its 
crossword had been adopted intact by the Times in 1991.)

At the end, we hear that Oliver is like Aristotle, in that he has "an 
inventive and lateral mind - no use in a straight line but brilliant sideways." 
And in the end, Oliver's Travels is a homage to unorthodox reasoning, 
playfulness and thinking things through slowly. I hope I've avoided spoilers; 
BBC Four should run a repeat - possibly as part of the crossword centenary 
season I hope the channel is working on.

Plater wrote the introduction for the sadly out-of-print fourth volume of 
Chambers <http://www.chambers.co.uk/>' collection of Araucaria 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/araucaria> crosswords, charmingly explaining 
that writer met setter in the garden of English jazz clarinettist John 
Dankworth, but that "it would take too long to explain why". He goes on:

[F]or my wife Shirley, as for me, it was like meeting a semi-deity. To 
understand this, you need to know something of the domestic patterns in our 
house.

Monday to Saturday, The Guardian arrives [and] the first thing we check is the 
authorship of the day's crossword. If we see the name Araucaria, we know later 
in the day, he will help ease the pain of the front page and the sports section.

Shirley was one of the guests at the setter's 90th birthday party; you can

death in 2010. There's alsoa tribute crossword
