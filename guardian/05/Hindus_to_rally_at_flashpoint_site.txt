 Hindu nationalists pushed ahead yesterday with plans for a mass gathering near 
the site of a demolished Mughal-era mosque at Ayodhya, in the state of Uttar 
Pradesh in northern India, as police surrounded a camp with about 2,000 
pilgrims outside the town.
Fears are growing within the central government that an estimated 100,000 
Hindus from across the country are heading for the site in response to a call 
from the World Hindu Council for a rally on Friday.

But the state's chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has strong support 
from Muslims, has blocked all approaches to the town with armed police in an 
attempt to prevent the demonstration.

Police have detained at least 4,000 pilgrims in the last few days, many of 
whom were deported from the state.

Hindu nationalists want to construct a temple dedicated to the god-king Ram at 
the site of the demolished Babri mosque. They say that the Mughal emperor Babur 
had the mosque built over a much earlier temple dedicated to Ram.

A court has yet to decide whether the land belongs to Hindus or to Muslims. 

A mob of Hindu nationalists destroyed the 16th century mosque in December 
1992, triggering riots across the country in which an estimated 3,000 people 
were killed.

But yesterday there seemed to be little enthusiasm for the rally in Ayodhya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayodhya>. A local Hindu leader announced 
that about 500 Hindu holy men would guard Muslim neighbourhoods on the day of 
the demonstration.

"Muslims are frightened of the World Hindu Council show," said Mahant Gyan 
Das. He said his group would not let "a sense of fear" take over the town's 
Muslims.
