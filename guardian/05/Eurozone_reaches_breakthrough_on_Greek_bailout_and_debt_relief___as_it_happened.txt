Dijsselbloem sounds quite cheerful, telling reporters that this is an 
important moment in the long Greek saga.

Confidence has begun to recover since the drama of last summer, and he extends 
his thanks to Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his staff.

We have entered a new phase, and I welcome that very much, Dijsselbloem 
concludes.

Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem says ministers have agreed a range of debt 
relief measures forGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>.

In the short term, these relate to ‘debt management’ - smoothing Greece’s 
repayments to avoid any shocks.

Medium-term measures will kick in from mid-2018, when Greece’s bailout expires 
(assuming Athens complies with its demands).

He also explains that profits which the European Central Bank has made on 
Greek bonds will be returned to Athens, to help with debt sustainability.

However, most of this new loan will be returned to Greece’s creditors, of

GREECE GETS ITS BAILOUT LOANS

It’s official! Jeroen Dijsselbloem confirms that the eurozone’s bailout 
vehicle has agreed to extend €10.3bn of bailout loans toGreece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>.

But as rumoured earlier, the aid will be handed over in several instalments, 
not in one lump.

Dijsselbloem says:

This is very good news... the programme is fully back on track. Greece is 
delivering a lot, and we are making good progress.

Curious metaphor alert, from the Slovakian finance minister:
Peter Kažimír (@KazimirPeter) 
It was a complicated birth tonight. It's probably about as good as it gets.

<https://twitter.com/KazimirPeter/status/735265011677958144>  
The Eurogroup’s statement is online here:

Eurogroup statement on Greece 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/05/24-eurogroup-statement-greece/?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Eurogroup+statement+on+Greece>

It confirms that Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> will 
receive its bailout loans, that the eurozone will offer debt relief, and that 
IMF officials are planning to recommend that they join the Greek bailout 
programme.

 
The key points:
Jeroen Dijsselbloem (@J_Dijsselbloem) 
We achieved a major breakthrough on #Greece 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash> which enables us to enter a new 
phase in the Greek financial assistance programme#eurogroup

Dijsselbloem (@J_Dijsselbloem)

#Greece <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/J_Dijsselbloem/status/735263263974391809> May 25, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/J_Dijsselbloem/status/735263263974391809>  
Dijsselbloem sounds quite cheerful, telling reporters that this is an 
important moment in the long Greek saga.

Confidence has begun to recover since the drama of last summer, and he extends 
his thanks to Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his staff.

We have entered a new phase, and I welcome that very much, Dijsselbloem 
concludes.
 
In another important development, Dijsselbloem says that that IMF is on board 
with the Greek bailout.

He explains that the Fund’s management have agreed to recommend a new 
financial arrangement for Athens before the end of this year.
Eric Maurice (@er1cmau) 
#IMF <https://twitter.com/hashtag/IMF?src=hash> will recommend its board to 
stay in programme before the end of the year

<https://twitter.com/er1cmau/status/735263349454344192>  
Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem says ministers have agreed a range of debt 
relief measures forGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>.

In the short term, these relate to ‘debt management’ - smoothing Greece’s 
repayments to avoid any shocks.

Medium-term measures will kick in from mid-2018, when Greece’s bailout expires 
(assuming Athens complies with its demands).

He also explains that profits which the European Central Bank has made on 
Greek bonds will be returned to Athens, to help with debt sustainability.
 
This decision eases concerns that Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> could default over the summer.

However, most of this new loan will be returned to Greece’s creditors, of 
course, or used to cover outstanding government bills.

ESM will endorse disbursement of 10.7 mn euro - in installments (much of which 
Greece will send straight back in forms of arrears/loans)
