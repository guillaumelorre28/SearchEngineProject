The state of play

With that news, it’s time to close the live blog down for the time being, 
although if there’s any developments, we will be back. Otherwise, let’s do it 
all again tomorrow.

 * Allardyce is unlikely to be announced as England manager today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/21/sam-allardyce-england-delayed-compensation-sunderland>
, with compensation negotiations between the FA and Sunderland still 
unresolved, but should be confirmed by Friday, with a press conference taking 
place next week

 * The FA’s selection panel – Martin Glenn, David Gill and Dan Ashworth – 
recommended Allardyce to the FA board at this morning’s Wembley meeting

 * Outgoing FA chairman Greg Dyke told reporters “the three-man group are 
convinced [Allardyce] is the right man, and I’d agree with them”

 * Allardyce has spent the day at Sunderland’s training ground, and took 
training this morning, having told his players he would be leaving at half-time 
in Wednesday night’s friendly against Hartlepool

 * Sunderland have begun the search for a new manager, with David Moyes widely 
expected to take over from Allardyce

From PA, here’s half a dozen names that could end up on Allardyce’s backroom 
team. Warning: it’s not massively inspiring.

Neil McDonald
Allardyce’s assistant manager for four years at West Ham, and worked on the 
staff at Blackburn and Bolton. Has a UEFA Pro licence; currently out of work 
after leaving Blackpool at the end of last season.

Mark Taylor
First appointed by Allardyce as a physio at Blackpool in 1995. Has worked as 
head of sports science and medicine at both Bolton and Newcastle. Brought to 
Sunderland by Allardyce but was dismissed against the manager’s wishes.
Sammy Lee
Worked under Allardyce at Bolton, and was an employee of the FA while 
Sven-Goran Eriksson was in charge. Also earned 14England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> caps as a player.


Teddy Sheringham
Brought in by Allardyce as an attacking coach at West Ham and impressed the 
then Hammers manager. Left for a short spell as Stevenage manager, and fits the 
FA’s wish to have a high-profile former player on board.

Peter Reid
A close friend and contemporary of Allardyce for many years, and successful 
player whose stint at Sunderland inspired Allardyce’s methods at Bolton.
Kevin Nolan
Has worked with Allardyce at Bolton, Newcastle and West Ham, and recently 
tried out as a player-manager at Leyton Orient. Only 34, but could play a part 
in the coaching setup.

Greg Dyke’s clumsy, al fresco interview is still the closest thing we have to 
an FA statement. Sunderland were reportedly informed yesterday of the FA 
panel’s decision, and have been talking to David Moyes in a bid to catch up the 
pre-season time lost. Anyway, do you fancy a quiz? Here you go:

Football quiz: how did previous England managers respond to defeat?

One thing we can expect from England’s Sam Allardyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce> is a sharp increase in 
managerial head games, after the mild-mannered Roy Hodgson and standoffish 
Fabio Capello. Allardyce has rarely shied away from a spot of verbal sparring, 
with his ‘long ball’ comments as West Ham manager inspiring this reaction from 
Louis van Gaal:
 I miss Louis van Gaal.

Back to limericks, for this strong effort from John Hayward:

There once was a big lad from Dudley

Whose Tinder profile said he was ‘cuddly’

The fans all took fright

But Sam said ‘relax, we’ll win ugly!’

Some more reaction, this time from a pair of managerial legends. First, Sir 
Alex Ferguson has said Allardyce is “the top English manager, and his many 
years of club management have earned him the chance. His confidence will 
inspire the players.”

Meanwhile, here’s former England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>
 boss Sven-Goran Eriksson: “He’s done good jobs wherever he went. If you take a 
team from the lower part of the table, you have to adapt. He will have a very 
organised team, so why not? Good luck, Sam!”

I’m handing back to Niall now, thanks for the haikus. Meanwhile, here’s Usain 
Bolt’s view, asked what he makes of Sam’s imminent arrival. He’s having none of 
it. “Personally I’m really disappointed in England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>. Every year I say that. You guys 
have the biggest league in the world and you have the best footballers, but no 
titles. It’s really sad.”

This just in from PA: “The surname Allardyce is of early medieval Scottish 
origin. According to the publication The Surnames of Scotland, it is “a 
territorial name from the old barony of Allardice in the parish of Arbuthnott, 
Kincardineshire, believed to be so called from the Middle English ‘aller’, 
alder, and an uncertain second element, thought to be the Gaelic ‘deas’, south 
(facing). Locational surnames, such as this, were originally given to local 
landowners, and the lord of the manor”. So he’s a south-facing lord of the 
manor. Thanks PA.

And so it’s back to the poetry. Here’s David Wall’s:

So Samuel is getting the gig

The FA have said ‘We’ll go big!’

But it’s doomed for a mess

At the wrath of the press

And he’ll leave in fake nose and a wig.

And this from Paul Crinion. 

A big man once left Sunderland

In search of a footballing wonderland

But he’ll be over a barrel

When they lump it to Carroll

Even if he somehow beats Iceland

It was going so well. Anyone have a Big Sam haiku?

Lunchtime summary

So here’s the latest from our live coverage of FA suits enjoying a finger 
buffet at Wembley. What we know so far:


• Right now, the selection panel – Martin Glenn, David Gill and Dan Ashworth – 
are making their case for Allardyce to the FA board. The deal should be 
announced soon after. Outgoing FA chairmanGreg Dyke appeared to give the game 
away earlier when he said: “I haven’t been involved … [but] the three-man group 
are convinced [Allardyce] is the right man, and I’d agree with them.”

• Allardyce has been taking training at Sunderland, and gave reporters a 
tell-all thumbs-up on his way in. He’s expected to be replaced by David Moyes.

• José Mourinho has given his verdict (see 10.43am 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jul/21/sam-allardyce-new-england-manager-live?page=with:block-5790984ee4b05c282c918f9b#block-5790984ee4b05c282c918f9b>
): “Well it’s your country and I think you are a complicated country for the 
person who gets the job.”Antonio Conte was more upbeat: “It’s fantastic because 
you know that you represent your country, your colours … I am happy for him.”

• And that’s it so far. But here’s some lunchtime reading: how Rob Smyth 
called itten years ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jan/24/sport.comment2>; West Ham’s 
Aaron Cresswell on how Big Sam “works on your weaknesses every day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/18/aaron-cresswell-sam-allardyce-england-manager>
”; Owen Gibson on how this is onethe FA cannot afford to get wrong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/14/england-manager-fa-martin-glenn>
; and an indelible image, via Sam’s autobiography: “I’ve doneFreddie Mercury, 
John Travolta, Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson in Thriller, which I think was 
my finest effort as I squeezed into some very tight black pants and nailed the 
Moonwalk. I’ve even dressed up asCheryl Cole.”

I’m going to hand over to David Hills for a few moments. I’ll leave you with 
another limerick, from Steven Eccles:

There once was an England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> head 
coach

Known well for his route one approach

He has working class steel

And a Northern appeal

Like the star of a film by Ken Loach.

He's got a strong track record of getting the best out of an average squad so 
it looks like a good fit. The football isn't going to be easy on the eye but 
tbh I can only think of a dozen or soEngland

It's a decent choice in my opinion - if nothing else England will have a 
system that is based on analysis and that the players understands, unlike the 
bizarre throwing mud at a wall approach we had in the Euros.

Still don't get why some people have this obsession that the England manager 
needs to be English. Why employ a mid-table plodder when you could get someone 
better?

...and spare a thought for Sunderland fans:

Poor old bloody Sunderland! The one time we make a sensible appointment as 
manager, a bigger club come and steal him.

Ah well - have to wish him well and thank him for keeping us up last year. At 
least he'll be used to coaching not-very-good players.

Another Big Sam limerick, this time from Andrew Simmons:

Big Sam will lead England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> to

Fan clashes in Russia may be gory

Transcendental meditation

Another bizarre English footballing story

Transcendental meditation? That’s right:

Here are a few quotes (care of PA) from Allardyce, pulled from his 
autobiography, er, ‘Big Sam: my Autobiography 
<http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25966670-big-sam>’.

On England:
“I got England schoolboy trials, although I didn’t make the team. I never 
represented my country at any level, which is why I was so excited to be 
interviewed for theEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> 
manager’s job [ in 2006]. You should never give up hope and I still haven’t.”
On St George’s Park:
“It is a fantastic facility which gets some stick for being in the middle of 
nowhere, but if the FA had dumped Wembley and built the national stadium in 
Birmingham, as it should have done, the complex would have been on the 
doorstep.”

On dressing room discipline:
“’If a player came walking into the dressing room talking away on his mobile 
... I’d take it off him and throw it in the bin, even if it was Wayne Rooney.”

On the FA:
“The more time (former Bolton chairman) Phil Gartside spent on the FA, the 
more I detected the influence of his blazer-wearing mates on him. He was 
interfering more and more.”

On tactics:
“I’ve always regarded losing possession in your own half as a criminal 
offence. There are more goals scored that way than by playing it out from the 
back yourselves. And as the facts show, most goals are scored from four passes 
or less.”

On ‘Moneyball’:
“I was assessing player stats long before it was fashionable in football in 
England. Now there are owners who believe algorithms determine whether a player 
will be a success or not. I would never go that far, because there are too many 
imponderables.”

On impersonations:
“I’ve done Freddie Mercury, John Travolta, Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson in 
Thriller, which I think was my finest effort as I squeezed into some very tight 
black pants and nailed the Moonwalk. I’ve even dressed up as Cheryl Cole.”


On Andy Carroll:
“When fit he should be England’s regular centre-forward because we’ve missed 
having enough quality strikers in recent years in the mould of Gary Lineker or 
Alan Shearer. Rooney has had to carry the country’s hopes and we need more than 
him if we are ever to win a tournament.”
On missing out on top club jobs:
“The top clubs in England would not risk taking on me and my team. Nowadays 
they are rarely managed by anyone from Britain. They’ve got to get a fancy-dan 
foreigner in, it’s almost compulsory. Are they really any better than the 
coaches we produce in this country? Do they have more knowledge than we do? I 
doubt it.”

Nobody thinks England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> can play

But nobody can know or can say

Allerdici he’s not

But Sam’s what we’ve got

That remarkable man from Dudley

Fair play to Gareth Duggan, particularly for trying to rhyme ‘say’ and ‘play’ 
with Dudley. That’s where Allardyce grew up and developed as a youth player – 
although his parents were (gasp!) from Scotland.

Some more reaction to the upcoming appointment, this time from Chelsea’s

What we’re all wondering, of course, is how David Squires, who had so much fun 
withRoy ‘Supa Hot Fire’ Hodgson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/jun/17/david-squires-on-england-beating-wales-at-euro-2016>

very entertaining webchat with Squires from earlier this week:

To clarify, the FA board are currently holding a meeting at Wembley, where the 
panel – Martin Glenn, David Gill and Dan Ashworth – presenting the case for 
Allardyce to the board. This part of the meeting could go on until midday or 
1pm, and may be followed by a generously stocked buffet. Sky’s Nick Collins, 
thankfullynot up a ladder this time 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=368EQES_3kA>, says an announcement may not 
come for some time. So, while we’re waiting...

<https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> unbelievable the best the FA can come up 
with is a relegation escape artist.

The eternal question is this: does the England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> manager have to be English? If 
the FA wanted an Englishman in charge, Allardyce is one of just five English 
bosses in the Premier League – of the other four, two are newly promoted (Sean 
Dyche and Steve Bruce), Eddie Howe is only 38, and the other is Alan Pardew. Of 
course, the fact that Jürgen Klinsmann was considered suggested that the 
three-man panel were prepared to look further afield – it’s unclear why the 
best they could find was Klinsmann.

Sam Allardyce: the story so far

Allardyce began his managerial career in the League of Ireland, with Limerick. 
After a brief stint at Preston, he managedBlackpool and Notts County, winning 
the Third Division (fourth tier) with the Magpies before joiningBolton in 1999. 
He stayed at the Reebok Stadium until April 2007, taking the Trotters into the 
Premier League and establishing them as a top-eight team.

After being offered the Manchester City job, eventually losing out to former 
England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson, Allardyce moved toNewcastle, but lasted just 
eight months. He rebuilt his reputation withBlackburn before he was memorably 
replaced by Steve Kean. A four-year spell atWest Ham, securing a Premier League 
return but falling out withfans he called “deluded” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/14/sam-allardyce-west-ham-brainwashed-supporters>
. Now established as a man to secure Premier League survial, he repeated the 
trick last season withSunderland.

Jamie Jackson

José Mourinho has given his view on Sam Allardyce’s imminent appointment as 
England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> manager.

“Well it’s your country and I think you are a complicated country for the 
person who gets the job. I think he is the right person for that, I think he’s 
a good choice but I think he needs support and I think you can do better in 
respect to that. Because my experience in your country shows me that in the 
football world you could do a bit better.

“I think Sam never had the big chance at the highest level, lots of 
experiences in the Premier League but never that big one and now he has the big 
one.

Mourinho is clear Allardyce is suited for the role. “I think he’s more than 
ready, he’s a good motivator, he can create a good team spirit with his players 
and I wish him the best from my side, not just as a friend but my side as the 
Manchester United manager,” he said.

“The only thing I can promise is I am going to try and support him the best 
way, preparing the players for him, always trying to have the English players 
always available and in good conditions to help him and I hope you can do the 
same. Because it’s your time, in Portugal we were waiting and waiting and 
finally we got it. Now I think it is time for you because [19]66 was a long 
time ago so good luck Big Sam.”

Greg Dyke’s interview, on a kerb underneath Wembley Way, is something to 
behold. Asked about the three-man panel’s decision, Dyke said “I haven’t been 
involved ... I’m leaving, so you should ask [the panel].”

The outgoing FA chairman then added “the three-man group are convinced 
[Allardyce] is the right man, and I would agree with them,” thereby revealing 
the information he had tried to keep to himself.

He's the manager England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>

So.
Leicester City are Premier League champions, Britain is no longer in the EU, 
Theresa May is PM andSam Allardyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce> is England manager. Can 
somebody wake me up before this year gets any weirder?

Big Sam spotted! But he’s a long way from Wembley – he’s in Cleadon, at 
Sunderland’s training ground. He’s given a thumbs-up on his way in. The Black 
Cats will be looking for another manager – their ninth, including caretakers, 
in the last five years.David Moyes is reportedly already talking to the club’s 
owners, and is firmly odds-on to replace Allardyce.

Sorry, Peter. You may have a point. It’s been reported that Allardyce was more 
willing than other candidates to consider mentoring a younger successor. It may 
well turn out that this protége is a formerEngland

If you’ve been anywhere near Twitter in the last few weeks, you’ll have seen a 
laboured gag aboutSam Allardyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce> at least making sure 
England avoid relegation. Except of course, with the introduction of Uefa’s new 
Nations League ahead of Euro 2020, he may end up doing just that:

Preamble

Hello. The worst-kept secret of the summer is about to be revealed, with Sam 
Allardyce <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce> set to be named 
England manager following the FA’s board meeting, taking place at Wembley any 
minute now. The three-man panel making the decision – Martin Glenn, Dan 
Ashworth and David Gill – are yet to make public comment, but FA chairman Greg 
Dyke has spilled the beans, confirming that they will recommend the current 
Sunderland manager to replace Roy Hodgson.

We’ll have all the news and reaction as it happens, plus your views on an 
appointment that’s been at different points in the pipeline for the last 
decade. Is Big Sam the right man for England’s rebuilding job?

With that news, it’s time to close the live blog down for the time being, 
although if there’s any developments, we will be back. Otherwise, let’s do it 
all again tomorrow.

 * Allardyce is unlikely to be announced as England manager today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/21/sam-allardyce-england-delayed-compensation-sunderland>
, with compensation negotiations between the FA and Sunderland still 
unresolved, but should be confirmed by Friday, with a press conference taking 
place next week

 * The FA’s selection panel – Martin Glenn, David Gill and Dan Ashworth – 
recommended Allardyce to the FA board at this morning’s Wembley meeting

 * Outgoing FA chairman Greg Dyke told reporters “the three-man group are 
convinced [Allardyce] is the right man, and I’d agree with them”

 * Allardyce has spent the day at Sunderland’s training ground, and took 
training this morning, having told his players he would be leaving at half-time 
in Wednesday night’s friendly against Hartlepool

 * Sunderland have begun the search for a new manager, with David Moyes widely 
expected to take over from Allardyce
 
We have some news! And the news is... Sam Allardyce probably won’t be 
confirmed asEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> manager today
, as the FA and Sunderland are still ironing out compensation. Here’s more from 
Louise Taylor:

Sam Allardyce’s England appointment delayed by haggling over compensation

From PA, here’s half a dozen names that could end up on Allardyce’s backroom 
team. Warning: it’s not massively inspiring.

Neil McDonald
Allardyce’s assistant manager for four years at West Ham, and worked on the 
staff at Blackburn and Bolton. Has a UEFA Pro licence; currently out of work 
after leaving Blackpool at the end of last season.

Mark Taylor
First appointed by Allardyce as a physio at Blackpool in 1995. Has worked as 
head of sports science and medicine at both Bolton and Newcastle. Brought to 
Sunderland by Allardyce but was dismissed against the manager’s wishes.
Sammy Lee
Worked under Allardyce at Bolton, and was an employee of the FA while 
Sven-Goran Eriksson was in charge. Also earned 14England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> caps as a player.


Teddy Sheringham
Brought in by Allardyce as an attacking coach at West Ham and impressed the 
then Hammers manager. Left for a short spell as Stevenage manager, and fits the 
FA’s wish to have a high-profile former player on board.

Peter Reid
A close friend and contemporary of Allardyce for many years, and successful 
player whose stint at Sunderland inspired Allardyce’s methods at Bolton.
Kevin Nolan
Has worked with Allardyce at Bolton, Newcastle and West Ham, and recently 
tried out as a player-manager at Leyton Orient. Only 34, but could play a part 
in the coaching setup.
 
Here’s more on the news that Julen Lopetegui, tipped for the Wolves job last 
week, has been announced as the new Spain manager.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/21/spain-appoint-julen-lopetegui-replace-vicente-del-bosque> 
From Whitley over in the US, here’s another Allardyce specialising in 
emergency repair jobs:
 
Greg Dyke’s clumsy, al fresco interview is still the closest thing we have to 
an FA statement. Sunderland were reportedly informed yesterday of the FA 
panel’s decision, and have been talking to David Moyes in a bid to catch up the 
pre-season time lost. Anyway, do you fancy a quiz? Here you go:

One thing we can expect from England’s Sam Allardyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce> is a sharp increase in 
managerial head games, after the mild-mannered Roy Hodgson and standoffish 
Fabio Capello. Allardyce has rarely shied away from a spot of verbal sparring, 
with his ‘long ball’ comments as West Ham manager inspiring this reaction from 
Louis van Gaal:
 I miss Louis van Gaal.  
“The FA are delaying the announcement for maximum effect, before introducing 
Henry James Redknapp as the newEngland

Speaking of the FA, it’s ten minutes until the shutters come down on the 
buffet. Here’s another haiku:

Back to limericks, for this strong effort from John Hayward:

There once was a big lad from Dudley

Whose Tinder profile said he was ‘cuddly’

The FA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa> swiped right

The fans all took fright

But Sam said ‘relax, we’ll win ugly!’
 
There’s still no word from Wembley as to when, or if, we will get an 
announcement this afternoon. As mentioned earlier, Allardyce has Scottish 
roots, and my colleague Simon Burnton has unearthed the Allardyce clan crest, 
which looks ripe for Photoshopping:
 ‘In defence of the distressed,’ indeed. Photograph: Family-Crests.com  
Just like the FA, I’ve got the best man for the job when it comes to haikus; 
Joe Williams of Haiku Hole.

No messing about

Give it to the big fella

One nil to England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>.
 
Some more reaction, this time from a pair of managerial legends. First, Sir 
Alex Ferguson has said Allardyce is “the top English manager, and his many 
years of club management have earned him the chance. His confidence will 
inspire the players.”

Meanwhile, here’s former England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>
 boss Sven-Goran Eriksson: “He’s done good jobs wherever he went. If you take a 
team from the lower part of the table, you have to adapt. He will have a very 
organised team, so why not? Good luck, Sam!”

And credit where it’s due – Jonathan ‘Soccer Aid’ Wilkes called this weeks ago:
 
More from the Guardian on Allardyce and the England

...or not. Still all quiet on Wembley Way, so here’s Chris Brock, with a 
rhyming haiku. Top that, readers.

Route one it will be

For a scrappy victory

England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> in Sochi
 
Thanks David. The FA’s meeting at Wembley is due to break for lunch in a 
couple of minutes, so we might just get some news shortly...
 
I’m handing back to Niall now, thanks for the haikus. Meanwhile, here’s Usain 
Bolt’s view, asked what he makes of Sam’s imminent arrival. He’s having none of 
it. “Personally I’m really disappointed in England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england>. Every year I say that. You guys 
have the biggest league in the world and you have the best footballers, but no 
titles. It’s really sad.”
 
That didn’t take long. As requested a few minutes back, here’s the first known 
Big Sam haiku. Nice work,Dave Rowe.

Daniel Sturridge dive:

furious expulsion of

Big Sam’s chewing gum
 
Via BrandtCantWatch in the comments, a taste of things to come. (Contains bad 
language).
 
This just in from PA: “The surname Allardyce is of early medieval Scottish 
origin. According to the publication The Surnames of Scotland, it is “a 
territorial name from the old barony of Allardice in the parish of Arbuthnott, 
Kincardineshire, believed to be so called from the Middle English ‘aller’, 
alder, and an uncertain second element, thought to be the Gaelic ‘deas’, south 
(facing). Locational surnames, such as this, were originally given to local 
landowners, and the lord of the manor”. So he’s a south-facing lord of the 
manor. Thanks PA.
 
And so it’s back to the poetry. Here’s David Wall’s:

So Samuel is getting the gig

The FA have said ‘We’ll go big!’

But it’s doomed for a mess

At the wrath of the press

And he’ll leave in fake nose and a wig.

And this from Paul Crinion. 

A big man once left Sunderland

In search of a footballing wonderland

But he’ll be over a barrel

When they lump it to Carroll

Even if he somehow beats Iceland

It was going so well. Anyone have a Big Sam haiku?
 
So here’s the latest from our live coverage of FA suits enjoying a finger 
buffet at Wembley. What we know so far:


• Right now, the selection panel – Martin Glenn, David Gill and Dan Ashworth – 
are making their case for Allardyce to the FA board. The deal should be 
announced soon after. Outgoing FA chairmanGreg Dyke appeared to give the game 
away earlier when he said: “I haven’t been involved … [but] the three-man group 
are convinced [Allardyce] is the right man, and I’d agree with them.”

• Allardyce has been taking training at Sunderland, and gave reporters a 
tell-all thumbs-up on his way in. He’s expected to be replaced by David Moyes.

• José Mourinho has given his verdict (see 10.43am 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jul/21/sam-allardyce-new-england-manager-live?page=with:block-5790984ee4b05c282c918f9b#block-5790984ee4b05c282c918f9b>
): “Well it’s your country and I think you are a complicated country for the 
person who gets the job.”Antonio Conte was more upbeat: “It’s fantastic because 
you know that you represent your country, your colours … I am happy for him.”

• And that’s it so far. But here’s some lunchtime reading: how Rob Smyth 
called itten years ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jan/24/sport.comment2>; West Ham’s 
Aaron Cresswell on how Big Sam “works on your weaknesses every day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/18/aaron-cresswell-sam-allardyce-england-manager>
”; Owen Gibson on how this is onethe FA cannot afford to get wrong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/14/england-manager-fa-martin-glenn>
; and an indelible image, via Sam’s autobiography: “I’ve doneFreddie Mercury, 
John Travolta, Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson in Thriller, which I think was 
my finest effort as I squeezed into some very tight black pants and nailed the 
Moonwalk. I’ve even dressed up asCheryl Cole.” 
 
I’m going to hand over to David Hills for a few moments. I’ll leave you with 
another limerick, from Steven Eccles:

There once was an England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> head 
coach

Known well for his route one approach

He has working class steel

And a Northern appeal

Like the star of a film by Ken Loach.

It's a decent choice in my opinion - if nothing else England will have a

Poor old bloody Sunderland! The one time we make a sensible appointment as 
manager, a bigger club come and steal him.

Ah well - have to wish him well and thank him for keeping us up last year. At 
least he'll be used to coaching not-very-good players.
 
Another Big Sam limerick, this time from Andrew Simmons:

glory

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/sam-allardyce-transcendental-meditation-relegation-battle> 
Here are a few quotes (care of PA) from Allardyce, pulled from his 
autobiography, er, ‘Big Sam: my Autobiography 
<http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25966670-big-sam>’.

On England:
“I got England schoolboy trials, although I didn’t make the team. I never 
represented my country at any level, which is why I was so excited to be 
interviewed for theEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> 
manager’s job [ in 2006]. You should never give up hope and I still haven’t.”
On St George’s Park:
“It is a fantastic facility which gets some stick for being in the middle of 
nowhere, but if the FA had dumped Wembley and built the national stadium in 
Birmingham, as it should have done, the complex would have been on the 
doorstep.”

On dressing room discipline:
“’If a player came walking into the dressing room talking away on his mobile 
... I’d take it off him and throw it in the bin, even if it was Wayne Rooney.”

On the FA:
“The more time (former Bolton chairman) Phil Gartside spent on the FA, the 
more I detected the influence of his blazer-wearing mates on him. He was 
interfering more and more.”

On tactics:
“I’ve always regarded losing possession in your own half as a criminal 
offence. There are more goals scored that way than by playing it out from the 
back yourselves. And as the facts show, most goals are scored from four passes 
or less.”

On ‘Moneyball’:
“I was assessing player stats long before it was fashionable in football in 
England. Now there are owners who believe algorithms determine whether a player 
will be a success or not. I would never go that far, because there are too many 
imponderables.”

On impersonations:
“I’ve done Freddie Mercury, John Travolta, Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson in 
Thriller, which I think was my finest effort as I squeezed into some very tight 
black pants and nailed the Moonwalk. I’ve even dressed up as Cheryl Cole.”


On Andy Carroll:
“When fit he should be England’s regular centre-forward because we’ve missed 
having enough quality strikers in recent years in the mould of Gary Lineker or 
Alan Shearer. Rooney has had to carry the country’s hopes and we need more than 
him if we are ever to win a tournament.”
On missing out on top club jobs:
“The top clubs in England would not risk taking on me and my team. Nowadays 
they are rarely managed by anyone from Britain. They’ve got to get a fancy-dan 
foreigner in, it’s almost compulsory. Are they really any better than the 
coaches we produce in this country? Do they have more knowledge than we do? I 
doubt it.”

 
Nobody thinks England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> can play

But nobody can know or can say

Allerdici he’s not

But Sam’s what we’ve got

That remarkable man from Dudley

Fair play to Gareth Duggan, particularly for trying to rhyme ‘say’ and ‘play’ 
with Dudley. That’s where Allardyce grew up and developed as a youth player – 
although his parents were (gasp!) from Scotland.
 
Leon Wilde has another limerick for us:

There once was a manager Allardyce

was paradise

But after two years

Of brickbats and jeers

Humble pie he did have a slice

Some more reaction to the upcoming appointment, this time from Chelsea’s 
Antonio Conte, who is fresh from international management himself. “It’s 
fantastic because you know that you represent your country, your colours ... I 
am happy for him” Conte said.

Understandably, current England players are keeping schtum until things are 
official. FormerEngland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> stars

To clarify, the FA board are currently holding a meeting at Wembley, where the 
panel – Martin Glenn, David Gill and Dan Ashworth – presenting the case for 
Allardyce to the board. This part of the meeting could go on until midday or 
1pm, and may be followed by a generously stocked buffet. Sky’s Nick Collins, 
thankfullynot up a ladder this time

come for some time. So, while we’re waiting...

<https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> unbelievable the best the FA can come up 
with is a relegation escape artist.

<https://twitter.com/ClaffL/status/756060253385621504> 
The eternal question is this: does the England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> manager have to be English? If 
the FA wanted an Englishman in charge, Allardyce is one of just five English 
bosses in the Premier League – of the other four, two are newly promoted (Sean 
Dyche and Steve Bruce), Eddie Howe is only 38, and the other is Alan Pardew. Of 
course, the fact that Jürgen Klinsmann was considered suggested that the 
three-man panel were prepared to look further afield – it’s unclear why the 
best they could find was Klinsmann.
 
Sam Allardyce: the story so far

Allardyce began his managerial career in the League of Ireland, with Limerick. 
After a brief stint at Preston, he managedBlackpool and Notts County, winning 
the Third Division (fourth tier) with the Magpies before joiningBolton in 1999. 
He stayed at the Reebok Stadium until April 2007, taking the Trotters into the 
Premier League and establishing them as a top-eight team.

After being offered the Manchester City job, eventually losing out to former 
England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson, Allardyce moved toNewcastle, but lasted just 
eight months. He rebuilt his reputation withBlackburn before he was memorably 
replaced by Steve Kean. A four-year spell atWest Ham, securing a Premier League 
return but falling out withfans he called “deluded” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/14/sam-allardyce-west-ham-brainwashed-supporters>
. Now established as a man to secure Premier League survial, he repeated the 
trick last season withSunderland.
 
José Mourinho has given his view on Sam Allardyce’s imminent appointment as 
England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> manager.

“Well it’s your country and I think you are a complicated country for the 
person who gets the job. I think he is the right person for that, I think he’s 
a good choice but I think he needs support and I think you can do better in 
respect to that. Because my experience in your country shows me that in the 
football world you could do a bit better.

“I think Sam never had the big chance at the highest level, lots of 
experiences in the Premier League but never that big one and now he has the big 
one.

Mourinho is clear Allardyce is suited for the role. “I think he’s more than 
ready, he’s a good motivator, he can create a good team spirit with his players 
and I wish him the best from my side, not just as a friend but my side as the 
Manchester United manager,” he said.

“The only thing I can promise is I am going to try and support him the best 
way, preparing the players for him, always trying to have the English players 
always available and in good conditions to help him and I hope you can do the 
same. Because it’s your time, in Portugal we were waiting and waiting and 
finally we got it. Now I think it is time for you because [19]66 was a long 
time ago so good luck Big Sam.”

What’s coming up for England’s new manager? After the embarrassing Euro 2016 
exit, the road to Russia in 2018 begins with a trip toSlovakia, on Sunday 4th 
September. Also in England’s qualifying group –Scotland, Slovenia, Lithuania 
and Malta. There’s scope in the schedule for a friendly beforehand, with Fifa’s 
window for internationals beginning on 29th August.
 
Greg Dyke’s interview, on a kerb underneath Wembley Way, is something to 
behold. Asked about the three-man panel’s decision, Dyke said “I haven’t been 
involved ... I’m leaving, so you should ask [the panel].”

The outgoing FA chairman then added “the three-man group are convinced 
[Allardyce] is the right man, and I would agree with them,” thereby revealing 
the information he had tried to keep to himself.

Big Sam spotted! But he’s a long way from Wembley – he’s in Cleadon, at 
Sunderland’s training ground. He’s given a thumbs-up on his way in. The Black 
Cats will be looking for another manager – their ninth, including caretakers, 
in the last five years.David Moyes is reportedly already talking to the club’s 
owners, and is firmly odds-on to replace Allardyce.
 
A couple of choice cuts from the archive, starting with a video looking back

Sorry, Peter. You may have a point. It’s been reported that Allardyce was more 
willing than other candidates to consider mentoring a younger successor. It may 
well turn out that this protége is a formerEngland

If you’ve been anywhere near Twitter in the last few weeks, you’ll have seen a

England avoid relegation. Except of course, with the introduction of Uefa’s new

An air of resignation in some corners over Mr S Allardyce’s ascension. Sad 
really, given that he is English andEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> are not Brazil.

Hello. The worst-kept secret of the summer is about to be revealed, with Sam 
Allardyce <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sam-allardyce> set to be named 
England manager following the FA’s board meeting, taking place at Wembley any 
minute now. The three-man panel making the decision – Martin Glenn, Dan 
Ashworth and David Gill – are yet to make public comment, but FA chairman Greg 
Dyke has spilled the beans, confirming that they will recommend the current 
Sunderland manager to replace Roy Hodgson.

We’ll have all the news and reaction as it happens, plus your views on an 
appointment that’s been at different points in the pipeline for the last 
decade. Is Big Sam the right man for England’s rebuilding job?
