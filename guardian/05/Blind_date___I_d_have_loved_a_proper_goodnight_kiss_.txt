Max on Tamara

What were you hoping for?
A mutual chemical match. And someone who’d grow vines with me in Italy.


First impressions?
Relieved. The name Tamara can mean someone who speaks the Queen’s English and 
likes ponies.

What did you talk about?
Her Russian great-grandfather. How her grandmother was given up for adoption. 
Where our lives had taken us, and where we’d travel next.

Any awkward moments?
A stray hand toppled a glass of wine.

Good table manners?
She had great composure.

Best thing about Tamara?
She’s sensible, open-minded and generous-hearted.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
I’d like to introduce her outlook to some of my friends.

Describe her in three words
Resilient, sensitive, sincere.

What do you think she made of you?
Relaxed, interested and frightfully British.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, we stayed for coffee and a nightcap.

And... did you kiss?
Just a farewell kiss on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I didn’t get a sense of what she does to let her hair down.

Marks out of 10?
7.

Would you meet again?
For a great conversation on European culture, perhaps.

Tamara on Max

What were you hoping for?
Someone like-minded who wouldn’t run away (and secretly hoping he could be The 
One).


First impressions?
A gentleman in every sense of the word.

What did you talk about?
Living abroad, the Loch Ness monster and good wine.

Any awkward moments?
Breaking my glass. I was impressed that he just kept on chatting.

Good table manners?
He was very attentive.

Best thing about Max?
His cheeky comments (and his eyes).

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Absolutely.

Describe him in three words
Kind, handsome, funny.

What do you think he made of you?
A chatterbox.

Did you go on somewhere?
No. He had to get up early the next day for a boxing workout.

And... did you kiss?
Just a peck on the cheek.

I hope so, although we didn’t exchange numbers.
