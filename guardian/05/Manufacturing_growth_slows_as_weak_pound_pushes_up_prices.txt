Growth in the UK’s manufacturing sector has eased and the weak pound is 
further driving up firms’ prices

, according to an industry survey.

The closely watched manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.4 in 
November from 54.2 in October, according to the latest monthly snapshot from 
Markit/CIPS. A reading above 50 signals expansion; a reading below points to 
contraction.

The industry has been growing for four months, but growth has eased in output 
and new orders from the highs reached in September.

Sterling, which has dropped sharply since the EU referendum

 in June, continues to push up manufacturers’ costs, prompting them to raise 
their prices. Selling prices rose for the seventh month, and at a rate close to 
October’s 64-month high. This is further evidence that consumers face higher 
prices for food and household goods in coming months.

Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said 
overall manufacturing “remained in good health”.

“Although the recent growth spurt showed further signs of slowing, the pace of 
expansion is still solid and above its long-term trend. This should be 
sufficient to ensure manufacturing is a positive contributor to fourth quarter 
GDP,” he said.

He said the expansion was underpinned by rising consumer demand and spending 
by businesses, but noted that the trend in new orders for investment goods such 
as factory parts and machinery had eased sharply in the fourth quarter.

The weaker pound has boosted export orders, he said, but added: “The concern 
is that higher costs may in time offset any positive effect of the weaker 
exchange rate, especially given that export order book growth has already waned 
markedly from September’s five and a half year high.”

A recent survey from the Confederation of British Industry painted a similar 
picture

. It showed order books were strong but warned that factory gate prices were 
rising at their fastest rate since early 2014.
