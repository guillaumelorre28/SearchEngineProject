Just like old times ... Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel

They have always been excluded from our music collection even though it's 
fairly heavy on folk singers. It was one thing to discover the Texan troubadour 
Townes Van Zandt after hearing his great version of the Rolling Stones'Dead 
Flowers <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wonPmOhglhs> on the soundtrack of The 
Big Lebowski 
<http://film.theguardian.com/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558593,00.html>
, and become so obsessed with his dark version of country music that I ended up 
making contact with his widow. It was even OK to start listening to obscure 
English folk recordings by singers whose biographies include phrases such as 
"after recording a version of Dirty Old Town in 1956 she got on a bus to 
Swindon and was never seen again." And as for The Incredible String Band - 
well, they're cool, aren't they?

But Simon and Garfunkel 
<http://arts.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,,1261020,00.html>?

And yet I actually listened to them as a teenager, alternating them with Joy 
Division. I found it hard to admit this truth until the other day. An old 
cassette found its way into the house and suddenly I was homeward bound ...

Simon and Garfunkel are never going to be a fashionable taste to confess to. 
They probably weren't even fashionable in 1972. Only when you're the age to see
The Graduate <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/> as a brilliantly subversive 
vision of the American dream's hollowness (about 16, generally) are you truly 
open to the message ofSound of Silence 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kd8xp86reY>. Maybe the strange truth is that 
Simon and Garfunkel are a truly youthful obsession.

Listening to them again, it's I Am A Rock 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4_-uinXzwo> that sends shivers down my spine. 
What a great song - what a poem. Paul Simon's idea is so simple: to take John 
Donne's declaration that "no man is an island" and reverse its terms. To give a 
voice to the person who actually believes it is possible to be separate from 
the rest of humanity.

"I am a rock, I am an island ..."

You could abolish English exams and replace them with a test on this song. 
Anyone who doesn't get it is never going to get any poetry (clue: "and a rock 
feels no pain").

And it's not only in the field of music that Simon and Garfunkel excel. Paul 
Simon gives a great self-mocking performance in Woody Allen'sAnnie Hall 
<http://film.theguardian.com/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,576675,00.html>
, and in Curb Your Enthusiasm Larry David is desperate to see him in concert. 
But the best S+G film performance is Art Garkunkel's horrific impersonation of 
an arrogant academic in Nic Roeg's masterpieceBad Timing 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080408/>.

Anyway the confession is made. And I feel groovy about it.
