The remote island of South Georgia, between South America and Antarctica, is 
among nine new locations to have been mapped onGoogle Street View 
<https://www.google.com/maps/views/u/0/streetview?gl=us>.

The island, where the explorer Ernest Shackleton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/04/my-hero-ernest-shackleton> found 
refuge, is one of the most least-visited places on Earth. Now it is possible 
for users to discover the path of the legendary polar explorer from their own 
homes.
 Shackleton’s final resting place is among the locations mapped using the 
Trekker 
In 1914, Shackleton was planning to cross Antarctica via the South Pole, but 
en route from Buenos Aires his ship, Endurance, became trapped in the ice. 
After living on the ice for two months, the crew sailed their lifeboats to the 
small and barren Elephant Island, before risking their lives navigating a 
further 800 nautical miles to the South Georgia whaling stations to find help.

The explorer died of a heart attack on his return to the islands in 1922, on a 
further expedition, and Grytviken, South Georgia, was his final resting place.

 The islands are mostly populated by wildlife, including albatross, elephant 
seals and penguins 
The Google Trekker 
<http://www.google.co.uk/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/> project is 
the result of a collaboration between Linblad Expeditions and National 
Geographic to commemorate the centenary of Shackleton’s extraordinary 
expedition. The Trekker is a backpack-mounted camera that has 15 lenses and 
shoots a photo every 2.5 seconds.

More than 10,000 panoramas were shot at nine locations, including Shackleton’s 
grave, Grytviken church, Grytviken whaling station and Prion Island.


You can also observe the colonies of penguins, albatrosses and elephant seals 
that occupy the islands.
