1 Skepta

2016 has clearly been the year of Skepta, which makes a change from 2015 which 
was clearly the year of, erm, Skepta. With the grime star’s ascent seemingly 
unstoppable of late, you can put your house on the fact that he will shut down 
Ally Pally with this gigantic end-of-year show.

If you think guitar music is about as relevant as a Gangnam Style oral history 
dictated on to MiniDisc, make your way to the nearest Hinds show immediately. 
These four women make a clattering, freewheeling racket that sounds like the 
Shaggs covering the Shangri-Las, while unapologetically enjoying themselves in 
the process.

While most teenage brothers are busy giving each other dead arms and a beating 
on GTA, Michael and Brian D’Addario have been busy channelling the likes of 
Supertramp, Big Star and Todd Rundgren. Their live shows – which involve an 
impressive amount of high kicks – have been leaving fans dazed but amused.

Is swaggering northern indie on the rise again? Stockport’s Blossoms certainly 
believe so, conjuring psychedelic indie that’s somewhere between Arctic Monkeys 
and Echo And The Bunnymen on their recent debut record. They’re not ready for a 
tour in the shape of rabbit ears just yet, but watch this space.

The London-based art collective find themselves at a tricky crossroads. Are 
they radical pop subversives? Or increasingly problematic art-school wallies? 
You suspect a degree of reinvention is needed if they’re to sustain their early 
hype, which could mean shaking things up a bit for this show, featuring AG Cook 
and Danny L Harle among others.
