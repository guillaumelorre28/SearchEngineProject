‘I programmed my ghost to say them because that’s what my ghost had said.’

That moment, as people say on the internet, when an episode of Doctor Who 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who> strays so far into the 
weird that it becomes a classic, somehow despite itself. There’s more to pick 
over within Before The Flood than any episode in recent memory.

For a start, either the production team are developing a reckless disregard 
for the fourth wall, or, along with chalkboards, Ray Bans and Fender 
Stratocasters, one of the 12th Doctor’s “things” is striding around the Tardis 
imagining he’s an abnormally effusive One Show correspondent. After last year’s 
Listen, and the promise of a Capaldi single-hander towards the end of the 
series, I would suggest the latter.


Actually, it was no bad thing that the pre-credits amounted to a user-guide 
for an episode that, after last week’s slow-burning creeps, was mind-boggling 
in its ingenuity; hinging on the time travel theory of the “bootstrap paradox”, 
or “causal loop <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop>”, wherein a 
subsequent event becomes the cause of a previous one.

Writer Toby Whithouse tends to deliver the more colourful episodes. And while 
his hallmarks of fizzy dialogue and relatable supporting characters are present 
and correct, here he effectively out-Moffats Steven Moffat. And he’s on the 
record as saying that initial drafts were even more timey-wimey than what was 
delivered. I don’t think my tiny mind would have been able to cope with any 
more. Yet it’s the basic simplicity of the premise that will keep you awake at 
night. This short film about a man remembering his own death might shed some 
light. Or indeed, not.

 Short film Infinite Chaos 
‘You owe me. You’ve made yourself essential to me, you’ve given me something 
else to … be.’

This might be a bit bitchy, but can anybody now even remember that half-series 
when Jenna Coleman was paired with a departing Matt Smith and it just didn’t 
really work at all? I now feel horribly guilty at my initial disdain for the 
Clara character. A woman still mad with grief; so still reckless with abandon; 
so still vulnerable to making mistakes while holding on to her heart. It’s no 
coincidence that it’s her who sympathises with what Bennet is going through.

There’s another ghost looming large in this story, and his name is Danny Pink. 
Capaldi and Coleman are surely now one of the most successful pairings in 
Doctor Who’s history.

‘At the risk of starting a bidding war, you could enslave me. In the ship, I 
have directions to my planet and a selection of items you could oppress me 
with.’

Sorry, this isn’t even really a section. I’m just still trying to pull myself 
up from the floor after laughing at Paul Kaye as Prentis, and a reference to 
S&M in Doctor Who so blatant that they didn’t even bother trying to conceal it. 
If only Torchwood was still on air; goodness knows what else might be revealed 
about the planet Tivoli. Sorry, my mind is filthy.

Fear Factor 

As much as we said last week that Cass’s deafness would not impinge on the 
story, I’m fairly sure that her sequence through the corridors of the Drum, 
oblivious to Ghost Moran’s axe, was the creepiest sequence of Doctor Who since 
Amy Pond faced the Weeping Angels in 2010.

Meanwhile, I’m not one to scare easily, but found the realisation of the 
Fisher King difficult to look at, putting this old fanboy in mind of the
Destroyer <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP6T1wcFwms> from 1989’s Battlefield 
(surely a design classic). The publicity surrounding the Fisher King’s vocal 
might have turned heads when he started coming out with English-rep style 
soliloquies – that was because the dialogue was delivered by Peter 
Serafinowicz. Slipknot’s Corey Taylor just provided the roar.


For those unfamiliar with histrionic heavy metal who might be wondering what 
all the fuss is about, here’s their song People = Shit.

Mysteries and questions 

Poor, doomed O’Donnell knew plenty about the Doctor, Rose, Martha and Amy 
having entered into fangirl folklore (although not Donna, perhaps something to 
do with her memory wipe having also wiped her from records?). She knew about 
Harold Saxon, but the Doctor was not yet familiar with the “Minister of War”. A 
throwaway line, or foreshadowing of darker events to come?

Continuity 104 

Whithouse got to bring back the Tivolians from his story The God Complex. But 
the other race to enslave them, referenced off-screen, were the translucent 
telepaths the Arcateenians, featured in his 2006 Torchwood episode Greeks 
Bearing Gifts. If that guy really does become the next showrunner, he’s got 
quite a universe part-built already.

Meanwhile, the Doctor’s amplifier was made by Magpie Electricals, a brand 
first featured in Mark Gatiss’ The Idiot’s Lantern from 2006. That story was 
set in the 1950s, but Magpie endured, having manufactured River’s scanner, 
Martha’s TV and the microphone on the starship Titanic.

Housekeeping and such 

As much as I love you all dearly for making us (possibly) the biggest Who 
portal on the whole internet, it’s also true that as we’ve grown, so has the 
negativity; sometimes fair comment, sometimes propagated by a minority of 
trolls. Our friends over atThe Doctor Who Forum 
<http://www.thedoctorwhoforum.com/> even formed their site because they were 
growing tired of the negging, so would flock over there after an initial chat 
here.

But three weeks in, something feels different. Looking over the comments (as I 
do, always), a flash flood of positivity has broken out. Enthusiastic comments 
are far outweighing the “I don’t even own a TV but …” brigade. Contributor 
@Kevcoe even suggested that this might be shaping up to be the best series 
since the 2005 revival. So how do we all feel about that? Was a return to 
cliffhangers all it was ever going to take to placate angry fandom?

Deeper into the vortex 

In yet more rock’n’roll crossover, Before the Flood shares its name with a 
1974 Bob Dylan live album. This was a good nine years after the controversy 
surrounding Dylan going electric.

On the same topic, that was Capaldi playing the guitar himself, the actor 
having form with post-punk band The Dreamboys. Shall we listen to their track 
Outer Limits? Why not.

 The Dreamboys: Outer Limits. 
Meanwhile, did anyone else prefer this riff-tastic version of the theme tune 
above over the unpopular current arrangement?

This week’s finest example of adorably berserk fandom comes in the form of this
change.org petition 
<https://www.change.org/p/steven-moffat-bbc-doctor-who-production-team-get-rid-of-the-sonic-sunglasses-and-maybe-the-screwdriver-too>
, demanding an immediate axe to the sonic shades. At the time of writing, it 
has so far garnered 2,346 signatures, although it is not clear whether founder 
Jason Irving quite realises that production on the series wrapped up weeks ago.

Steven Moffat has weighed in on the sonic shades controversy (although not, as 
reported elsewhere, in response to the petition – the video was published 
beforehand), declaring “sometimes you just have to embrace the heresy”.

The Doctor constantly facing certain death never really hangs too well with a 
character defined by his ability to regenerate, but at least it’s addressed 
here, this “12th” incarnation being a “clerical error” after the Timelords 
granted him a new regeneration cycle.

In Arthurian legend, the Fisher King, or Wounded King, was the last in a long 
line of keepers of the Holy Grail, wounded in the groin and incapable of moving 
on his own. The ghosts can wield axes because as electro-magnetic projections, 
the magnetism attracts the blade head. Clever, Mr Whithouse.

Finally, here’s a lovely behind the scenes film from the BBC’s magazine for 
the deaf community, See Hear, focusing on Cass actor Sophie Stone.

Next week


Maisie Williams arrives as (presumably) The Girl Who Died. Here’s the 
episode’s co-writer, Jamie Mathieson: “The Doctor meets the Vikings! Of course 
he does. The only question is, why did it take so long? Odin has come to visit 
his loyal followers, the Vikings, and reward their bravest warriors with a 
place in Valhalla. There’s only one problem – the Doctor and Clara, who smell a 
rat and are having none of this. They are soon caught up in the middle of a war 
between an advanced race of mercenary aliens and a village full of angry 
Vikings, who don’t take kindly to having their gods insulted.”
