Irish detectives have arrested two men in connection with the murder of one of 
MI5’s most important spies inside the IRA.

The pair have been detained for questioning about the murder of former leading 
Sinn Féin member Denis Donaldson in Co Donegal in 2006.

The Garda Síochána said the men, who are in their 40s and 70s, were detained 
on Tuesday under the Irish Republic’s Offences Against the State Act.

They are being held at Letterkenny garda station in Co Donegal. Donaldson, a 
former close associate of Sinn Féin’s president, Gerry Adams, was killed by a 
shotgun blast as he answered the door to his cottage near Glenties in April 
2006.

The 55-year-old had been exposed months before his death as an MI5 agent 
working inside Sinn Féin and the IRA. Dissident republican terror group the 
Real IRA admitted responsibility for the murder.

Prior to his exposure as a British spy, Donaldson was a prominent figure in 
the republican movement and eventually became head of Sinn Féin’s 
administrative team in the Stormont parliament in Belfast.

The inquest into his death has been delayed at least 19 times, with his family 
taking legal action against the authorities in Ireland over the delays.

There have been allegations that a journal belonging to Donaldson was found in 
his cottage and, due to its sensitive contents, the Irish police have 
consistently applied for postponements of the inquest.
