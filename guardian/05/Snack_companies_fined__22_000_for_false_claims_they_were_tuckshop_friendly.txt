The makers of two children’s snacks have been fined and have agreed to stop 
using claims that their products are suitable for school canteens after an 
investigation by the consumer watchdog.

The makers of Rainbow Paddle Pops and Sakata rice snacks have been fined 
almost $22,000 after making misleading health claims about their products on 
packaging.

The Smith’s Snackfood Company’s Sakata Paws Pizza Supreme Rice Snacks and 
Unilever Australia’s Paddle Pop Rainbow carried misleading claims about their 
suitability for school canteens, the Australian Competition and Consumer 
Commission said.

The packaging bore logos which said they had met national health guidelines 
for school canteens.

However, clarification that the products were rated “amber” were written in 
small print, separately from the logos.

An amber rating defines products that can be included on canteen menus but are 
recommended to be served in small amounts and to be kept to a minimum.

“The ACCC believes both companies were using logos to claim that these 
products were a healthy option for school canteens to supply to children, when 
they were not,” the ACCC commissioner, Sarah Court, said.
