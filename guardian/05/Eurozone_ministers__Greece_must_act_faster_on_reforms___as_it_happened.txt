Closing summary: Greece urged to work faster on reforms

Before closing up for the day, here is a summary of events on what has been a 
busy day.

The main event was the Eurogroup meeting in Bratislava, where eurozone finance 
ministers gathered to discuss Greece’s progress on reform. Athens is hoping to 
secure a €2.8bn tranche of bailout money, but it is dependent on a programme of 
15 reforms.

With only two of the 15 reforms complete, ministers urged the Greek government 
to hurry up.The message was this: Athens still has time but it must work faster.
 Eurogroup press conference 
Other developments today:


 * In Athens itself, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hosted fellow 
leaders of southern European countries

, at a summit designed to find common ground and identify a unified position. 
 * A surprise fall in German exports  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/09/eurozone-ministers-meet-for-key-talks-on-greek-bailout-business-live?page=with:block-57d26f1ee4b013613fffb86d#block-57d26f1ee4b013613fffb86d>
dragged the country’s trade surplus lower and raised concerns about the 
strength of Europe’s largest economy. 
 * The weak figures from Germany, as well as a failure by the ECB to announce 
more eurozone stimulus on Thursday, weighed on European stocks, with all major 
indices down. Europe’s STOXX 600 is currently down 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 is 
off 0.8% or 58 points. 
 * In the UK, the Serious Fraud Office revealed it has charged three former 
senior executives of Tesco with fraud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sfo-charges-former-tesco-directors-with-fraud>
, in relation to a £263m-plus accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. 
 * There was better than expected data from the UK’s construction sector 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/construction-exports-figures-uk-economy-growing>
, where output was flat in July. It suggested the sector was not sent into a 
shock downward spiral following the Brexit vote. 
 * Britain’s trade deficit narrowed in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/construction-exports-figures-uk-economy-growing>
 to £11.8bn after exports rose but imports fell. The data suggested the sharp 
drop in the pound since the Brexit vote could be starting to feed through to 
increased exports. 
 * Sir Philip Green, founder of collapsed retailer BHS, issued a statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sir-philip-green-i-am-working-every-day-on-the-bhs-pension-crisis>
 to reject the idea that he is dragging his feet over reaching a settlement for 
the firm’s 20,000 pensioners. He insisted he is working on a solution every day.

Oil falls below $49 but set for weekly rise

Brent crude oil is down 2.4% at $48.77 a barrel.

However, prices are still on course for the first weekly gain in three weeks 
after oil producers Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to work together to 
rebalance the markets.

Prices have also been boosted over the week by the International Energy Agency
, which said oil demand should finally exceed supply in the third quarter of 
2016, meaning global stockpiles could start to fall.

The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been addressing leaders of 
southern European countries who are in Athens for a (Club Med) summit:

 Our countries have in recent years been disproportionately affected by the 
economic crisis... and are on the front line of migratory flows. We were on the 
front line of the parallel crises which have tested Europe.


He added in an interview with the EurActiv news website:

 In such a debate, Europe’s Mediterranean countries can and must raise their 
voice. The way to have a bigger say is to seek a common approach and common 
positions.

 Tim Martin 
Here in the UK, the Eurosceptic chairman of the Wetherspoon’s pub chain has 
blasted Britain’s establishment stance over the Brexit vote.

Tim Martin, who also founded Wetherspoon’s, said those predicting doom had 
been proved wrong:

 In the run-up to, and the aftermath of, the recent referendum, the 
overwhelming majority of FTSE 100 companies, the employers’ organisation CBI, 
the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the leaders of all the main political parties 
and almost all representatives of British universities forecast trouble, often 
in lurid terms, for the economy, in the event of the leave vote.

City voices such as PwC and Goldman Sachs, and the great preponderance of 
banks and other institutions, also leant weight to this negative view.


Martin added there was no need for anxiety over a UK trade deal with the EU:

‘Scare Story 2’ is that failure to agree on a trade deal with the EU will have 
devastating consequences.

Common sense suggests that the worst approach for the UK is to insist on the 
necessity of a ‘deal’ – we don’t need one and the fact that EU countries sell 
us twice as much as we sell them creates a hugely powerful negotiating 
position.”

The party continues in Bratislava, where the Eurogroup meeting has ended but 
the broader Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers is underway.

Top of the agenda 
<http://www.eu2016.sk/en/political-and-expert-meetings/informal-meeting-of-ministers-for-economic-and-financial-affairs-informal-ecofin>
 is “the future of the EU economic policies”.

 Ministers will assess whether the existing framework is sufficient for the 
current unprecedented challenges such as migration, Brexit or security 
challenges.

Peter Kažimír, Slovakia’s finance minister and Ecofin host, adds:

The aim is to draw a lesson from previous mistakes and gradually design tools 
enabling us to avoid or at least to mitigate possible future crises.

Eurogroup has published a list of its “main results”, here 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2016/09/09/?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Eurogroup%2c%2009%2f09%2f2016%20-%20Main%20results>
.

Specifically on Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, it says:

 The institutions and the Greek minister for finance, Euclid Tsakalotos, 
briefed the Eurogroup on the state of play of the implementation of Greece’s 
economic adjustment programme.


The Greek authorities intend to complete the milestones, agreed in the context 
of the programme’s first review in a timely manner.

These include 15 measures relating to privatisation, energy sector reform, 
bank governance and the establishment of the revenue agency. The achievement of 
these milestones is a condition for a disbursement of €2.8 billion by the 
European Stability Mechanism
 Representatives of the institutions will be travelling to Athens shortly to 
prepare for the start of the second review of the programme.

Tesco has commented since the news broke that the SFO has charged three former 
executives with fraud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sfo-charges-former-tesco-directors-with-fraud>
.

The retailer said in a statement 
<https://www.tescoplc.com/news/news-releases/2016/tesco-statement-in-response-to-sfo-announcement/>
:

 We note the decision of the SFO to bring a prosecution against former 
colleagues in relation to historic issues and acknowledge the investigation 
into the company is ongoing.

Tesco continues to cooperate with the SFO’s investigation. The last two years 
have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an 
ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.

close  
Before closing up for the day, here is a summary of events on what has been a 
busy day.

The main event was the Eurogroup meeting in Bratislava, where eurozone finance 
ministers gathered to discuss Greece’s progress on reform. Athens is hoping to 
secure a €2.8bn tranche of bailout money, but it is dependent on a programme of 
15 reforms.

With only two of the 15 reforms complete, ministers urged the Greek government 
to hurry up.The message was this: Athens still has time but it must work faster.

Other developments today:


 * In Athens itself, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hosted fellow 
leaders of southern European countries

, at a summit designed to find common ground and identify a unified position. 
 * A surprise fall in German exports  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/09/eurozone-ministers-meet-for-key-talks-on-greek-bailout-business-live?page=with:block-57d26f1ee4b013613fffb86d#block-57d26f1ee4b013613fffb86d>
dragged the country’s trade surplus lower and raised concerns about the 
strength of Europe’s largest economy. 
 * The weak figures from Germany, as well as a failure by the ECB to announce 
more eurozone stimulus on Thursday, weighed on European stocks, with all major 
indices down. Europe’s STOXX 600 is currently down 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 is 
off 0.8% or 58 points. 
 * In the UK, the Serious Fraud Office revealed it has charged three former 
senior executives of Tesco with fraud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sfo-charges-former-tesco-directors-with-fraud>
, in relation to a £263m-plus accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. 
 * There was better than expected data from the UK’s construction sector 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/construction-exports-figures-uk-economy-growing>
, where output was flat in July. It suggested the sector was not sent into a 
shock downward spiral following the Brexit vote. 
 * Britain’s trade deficit narrowed in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/construction-exports-figures-uk-economy-growing>
 to £11.8bn after exports rose but imports fell. The data suggested the sharp 
drop in the pound since the Brexit vote could be starting to feed through to 
increased exports. 
 * Sir Philip Green, founder of collapsed retailer BHS, issued a statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sir-philip-green-i-am-working-every-day-on-the-bhs-pension-crisis>
 to reject the idea that he is dragging his feet over reaching a settlement for 
the firm’s 20,000 pensioners. He insisted he is working on a solution every day.

weekend, and please join us again on Monday.AM

Meanwhile Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren - historically a dovish 
policymaker in favour of lower rates - said the Federal Reserve increasingly 
faces risks by failing to raise interest rates.

Brent crude oil is down 2.4% at $48.77 a barrel.

However, prices are still on course for the first weekly gain in three weeks 
after oil producers Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to work together to 
rebalance the markets.

Prices have also been boosted over the week by the International Energy Agency
, which said oil demand should finally exceed supply in the third quarter of 
2016, meaning global stockpiles could start to fall.
 
The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been addressing leaders of 
southern European countries who are in Athens for a (Club Med) summit:

 Our countries have in recent years been disproportionately affected by the 
economic crisis... and are on the front line of migratory flows. We were on the 
front line of the parallel crises which have tested Europe.


He added in an interview with the EurActiv news website:

 In such a debate, Europe’s Mediterranean countries can and must raise their 
voice. The way to have a bigger say is to seek a common approach and common 
positions.

  Tim Martin 
Here in the UK, the Eurosceptic chairman of the Wetherspoon’s pub chain has 
blasted Britain’s establishment stance over the Brexit vote.

Tim Martin, who also founded Wetherspoon’s, said those predicting doom had 
been proved wrong:

 In the run-up to, and the aftermath of, the recent referendum, the 
overwhelming majority of FTSE 100 companies, the employers’ organisation CBI, 
the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the leaders of all the main political parties 
and almost all representatives of British universities forecast trouble, often 
in lurid terms, for the economy, in the event of the leave vote.

City voices such as PwC and Goldman Sachs, and the great preponderance of 
banks and other institutions, also leant weight to this negative view.


Martin added there was no need for anxiety over a UK trade deal with the EU:

‘Scare Story 2’ is that failure to agree on a trade deal with the EU will have 
devastating consequences.

Common sense suggests that the worst approach for the UK is to insist on the 
necessity of a ‘deal’ – we don’t need one and the fact that EU countries sell 
us twice as much as we sell them creates a hugely powerful negotiating 
position.”
 
The party continues in Bratislava, where the Eurogroup meeting has ended but 
the broader Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers is underway.

Top of the agenda 
<http://www.eu2016.sk/en/political-and-expert-meetings/informal-meeting-of-ministers-for-economic-and-financial-affairs-informal-ecofin>
 is “the future of the EU economic policies”.

 Ministers will assess whether the existing framework is sufficient for the 
current unprecedented challenges such as migration, Brexit or security 
challenges.

Peter Kažimír, Slovakia’s finance minister and Ecofin host, adds:

The aim is to draw a lesson from previous mistakes and gradually design tools 
enabling us to avoid or at least to mitigate possible future crises.

Eurogroup has published a list of its “main results”, here 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2016/09/09/?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Eurogroup%2c%2009%2f09%2f2016%20-%20Main%20results>
.

Specifically on Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, it says:

 The institutions and the Greek minister for finance, Euclid Tsakalotos, 
briefed the Eurogroup on the state of play of the implementation of Greece’s 
economic adjustment programme.


The Greek authorities intend to complete the milestones, agreed in the context 
of the programme’s first review in a timely manner.

These include 15 measures relating to privatisation, energy sector reform, 
bank governance and the establishment of the revenue agency. The achievement of 
these milestones is a condition for a disbursement of €2.8 billion by the 
European Stability Mechanism
 Representatives of the institutions will be travelling to Athens shortly to 
prepare for the start of the second review of the programme.

Tesco has commented since the news broke that the SFO has charged three former 
executives with fraud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sfo-charges-former-tesco-directors-with-fraud>
.

The retailer said in a statement 
<https://www.tescoplc.com/news/news-releases/2016/tesco-statement-in-response-to-sfo-announcement/>
:

 We note the decision of the SFO to bring a prosecution against former 
colleagues in relation to historic issues and acknowledge the investigation 
into the company is ongoing.

Tesco continues to cooperate with the SFO’s investigation. The last two years 
have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an 
ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.
