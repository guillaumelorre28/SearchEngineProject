Al-Jazeera <https://www.theguardian.com/media/al-jazeera> has formally 
launched its international arbitration claim against Egypt’s military 
government following what it regards as a prolonged campaign against its 
business and its journalists.

According to a press release issued by the London law firm, Carter Ruck, the 
Qatar-based broadcaster’s action is being taken under the jurisdiction of the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes 
<https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/Pages/default.aspx> (ICSID) in 
Washington DC.

As long ago as September 2013, Al-Jazeera first announced that it would seek 
legal redress against the Egypt 
<http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/09/20139128127645428.html>. And 
in April 2014, it served a formal notice of dispute on Egypt, citing breaches 
of the 1999 Qatar-Egypt bilateral investment treaty.

The terms of the treaty required that Al-Jazeera refrain from a formal process 
of arbitration for a period of at least six months to enable the parties to 
discuss a settlement.Egypt <https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> did not 
engage in such discussions.

Now, says Carter Ruck, “having allowed a further 12 months to pass, in the 
vain hope that Egypt would be willing to talk”, Al-Jazeera has submitted its 
formal arbitration request to ICSID’s secretary-general.It was registered on 20 
January 
<https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/cases/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseno=ARB/16/1>
.

The press release states that several journalists working for Al-Jazeera were 
arrested and harassed in the months following the July 2013 overthrow of the 
government led by President Mohammed Morsi by the Egyptian military.

The release further states that some of the broadcaster’s staff were detained 
without charge while others were subjected to what it calls “spurious and 
politically motivated charges.”

Among them were three journalists - Peter Greste 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/peter-greste>, Baher Mohamed and Mohamed 
Fahmy - who were sentenced to seven years and more in prison in June 2014.

Greste, having been released from jail in February 2015, was re-convicted in 
absentia. Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy were pardoned and eventually released 
from prison in September 2015.

Their freedom occurred shortly before Egypt’s current president, Abdel Fatah 
al-Sisi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi>, was due to 
address the UN general assembly in New York.

According to the Carter Ruck statement, “numerous” other Al-Jazeera 
journalists have been convicted by Egyptian courts in absentia. It further 
claims that the company’s offices in Cairo have suffered attacks by the 
military, police and gangs supporting Sisi’s government.

And the statement alleges that Al-Jazeera’s transmissions were subject to 
jamming before its licence to broadcast in Egypt was cancelled while its local 
branch was compulsorily liquidated.

Carter Ruck states: “As well as being in breach of its obligations under 
international law generally, Egypt’s actions have placed it in clear breach of 
its obligations under the Qatar-Egypt bilateral investment treaty.

“It requires that investors be afforded fair and equitable treatment by the 
governments of both countries and provides other enforceable rights.”

Under the treaty, Egypt was obliged to treat Al-Jazeera “in a manner 
consistent with its obligations under international human rights treaties” such 
as respecting its right to freedom of expression.

Al-Jazeera argues that, due to Egypt’s actions, it has suffered losses of at 
least $150m (£105m).

An Al-Jazeera spokesman quoted in the press release said the company had been 
left with no option but to take legal action.

He spoke of hopes that the arbitration “will allow an impartial, international 
tribunal to render its own judgment on politically motivated prosecutions and 
false charges to which Egypt has subjected a number of our journalists.”

A spokesman at Egypt’s London consulate said: “We have no comment to make on 
this at the present time.”

make clear that statements and allegations about what happened to Al-Jazeera 
journalists, the company’s offices and their licence to broadcast were part of 
the Carter Ruck press release. We have now also appended a response from the 
Egyptian government.
