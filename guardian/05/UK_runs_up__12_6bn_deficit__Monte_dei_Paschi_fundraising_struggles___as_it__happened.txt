UK borrowed £12.65bn in November

Newsflash: Britain borrowed more than £12.6bn to balance the books in November.

The public sector net borrowing requirement (excluding the impact of our 
state-owned banks) came in at £12.647bn.

That’s around £400m ahead of City expectations but lower than the £13.2bn 
borrowed in November 2015.

And it pushes the national debt up to £1.655 trillion, a new record high, 
equivalent to 84.5% of GDP.

Now this is interesting.... three of the six policymakers at Sweden’s Riksbank 
voted against extending its QE programme by six months.

One deputy governor wanted a smaller QE boost, while two more opposed any 
extension.

That forced governor Stefan Ingves to use his casting vote to get today’s 
decision through

Monte dei Paschi shares plunge on liquidity worries

Shares in Italy’s Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have just been temporarily suspended 
in Milan after plunging over 8%.

The selloff was triggered, I think, by a Reuters report showing that MPS is 
burning through its €11bn cash reserves faster than expected. It is now on 
track to run out of funds in four months time, rather than having almost a 
year’s worth of liquidity.

Reuters said:

Monte dei Paschi said it now expected its net liquidity position, currently 
standing at €10.6bn, to turn negative after four months. On Sunday the bank had 
forecast that a current net liquidity position, which was of €11bn, would turn 
negative after 11 months under a number of assumptions.

The pound is dipping in early trading, down 0.25% against the US dollar to 
$1.2334, and 0.4% against the euro to €1.185.

The US dollar itself is edging away from yesterday’s 14-year high, but remains 
strong -- possibly too strong, given the political uncertainty in America.

Jeremy Cook of World First says:

Once again, we have to think that the market is irrationally exuberant heading 
into the New Year and while the economic side of the new politics is being 
fully priced in – US and Chinese stimulus – the political side of the economics 
– policy mistakes and antagonistic trade stances – are not.

The dollar has made an impressive run but our minds keep circling back to the 
inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th as a possible turning point. 
Markets like to ‘buy the rumour and sell the fact’ and the swelling of asset 
prices, the dollar and inflation expectations could be a monster version of 
this trading plan. We cannot be sure until Trump is in the White House and that 
is in a month’s time.

Some breaking news: Britons are expecting inflation to pick up speed over the 
next few years, according to a new survey. 

Reuters has the details:

The British public’s long-term expectation for inflation rose to 3% in 
December, a more than two year high, according to a closely watched survey by 
polling company YouGov.

The survey for U.S. bank Citi showed that in December, people on average 
expected inflation in 5-10 years to reach 3%, the highest level since September 
2014 and up from a November forecast of 2.8%.

In the shorter term, respondents to the survey expect inflation in 12 months’ 
time to be at 2.43% from an earlier forecast of 2.36%.

Last month, inflation picked up to 1.2% - and economists expect it to keep 
rising in 2017.

The survey comes after a series of Brexit-inflation stories, including the row 
between Unilever and Tesco over the price of marmite, and price hikes by US 
technology firms such as Apple.

The Agenda: UK public finances in focus

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the 
financial markets, the eurozone and business.

Even though its unseasonably mild, this morning’s economic data may send a 
shiver through the City.

At 9.30am, we find out how much Britain had to borrow last month to balance 
the gap between government income and spending. It’s likely to show that the 
deficit widened to £12.2bn in November, up from just £4.8bn in October.

A poor reading may reignite concerns over the UK’s public finances as we head 
towards 2017, and a likely economic slowdown.

The data may put a few investors off their mince pies, with analysts at RBC 
Capital Markets saying:

November is traditionally a seasonally difficult month for the public 
finances, and we see a deficit of £12bn on the public sector net borrowing 
(ex-banking groups) measure.

Also coming up....

Italy’s government will be pushing on with a €20bn rescue package for its 
banks, with time running short.

Monti dei Paschi, Italy’s oldest lender, is making a last-ditch attempt to 
raise €5bn by selling shares to retail investors and investors. But this plan 
hit another roadblock last night, when the country’s bank rescue fund expressed 
concerns about a €1.5bn loan that would underpin the deal.

If the rescue plan fails, then the Italian state will have to step in.

European stock markets are expected to dip this morning, after Wall Street hit 
record highs (again) last night, and the dollar hit a new 14-year high.

state-owned banks) came in at £12.647bn.

That’s around £400m ahead of City expectations but lower than the £13.2bn 
borrowed in November 2015.

And it pushes the national debt up to £1.655 trillion, a new record high, 
equivalent to 84.5% of GDP.

 are accurate, then pay packets are going to be eroded by rising prices in the 
next few years.

This chart from the Resolution Foundation shows how real wages could start 
falling in 2017, as inflation overtakes nominal pay growth:

Now this is interesting.... three of the six policymakers at Sweden’s Riksbank 
voted against extending its QE programme by six months.

One deputy governor wanted a smaller QE boost, while two more opposed any 
extension.

That forced governor Stefan Ingves to use his casting vote to get today’s 
decision through

Shares in Italy’s Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have just been temporarily suspended 
in Milan after plunging over 8%.

The selloff was triggered, I think, by a Reuters report showing that MPS is 
burning through its €11bn cash reserves faster than expected. It is now on 
track to run out of funds in four months time, rather than having almost a 
year’s worth of liquidity.

Reuters said:

Monte dei Paschi said it now expected its net liquidity position, currently 
standing at €10.6bn, to turn negative after four months. On Sunday the bank had 
forecast that a current net liquidity position, which was of €11bn, would turn 
negative after 11 months under a number of assumptions.

Newsflash from Stockholm: Sweden’s central bank has voted to leave interest 
rates at their current record low of minus 0.5%.

The Riksbank has also extended its asset-purchase scheme by another six 
months, to maintain its current expansionary monetary policy.

The pound is dipping in early trading, down 0.25% against the US dollar to 
$1.2334, and 0.4% against the euro to €1.185.

The US dollar itself is edging away from yesterday’s 14-year high, but remains 
strong -- possibly too strong, given the political uncertainty in America.

Jeremy Cook of World First says:

Once again, we have to think that the market is irrationally exuberant heading 
into the New Year and while the economic side of the new politics is being 
fully priced in – US and Chinese stimulus – the political side of the economics 
– policy mistakes and antagonistic trade stances – are not.

The dollar has made an impressive run but our minds keep circling back to the 
inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th as a possible turning point. 
Markets like to ‘buy the rumour and sell the fact’ and the swelling of asset 
prices, the dollar and inflation expectations could be a monster version of 
this trading plan. We cannot be sure until Trump is in the White House and that 
is in a month’s time.

Have City traders clocked off for Christmas already?

European stock markets have barely shifted in early trading, and are hovering 
close to their highest level in 11 months.

In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 4 points, or 0.07%.

Some breaking news: Britons are expecting inflation to pick up speed over the 
next few years, according to a new survey. 

Reuters has the details:

The British public’s long-term expectation for inflation rose to 3% in 
December, a more than two year high, according to a closely watched survey by 
polling company YouGov.

The survey for U.S. bank Citi showed that in December, people on average 
expected inflation in 5-10 years to reach 3%, the highest level since September 
2014 and up from a November forecast of 2.8%.

In the shorter term, respondents to the survey expect inflation in 12 months’ 
time to be at 2.43% from an earlier forecast of 2.36%.

Last month, inflation picked up to 1.2% - and economists expect it to keep 
rising in 2017.

The survey comes after a series of Brexit-inflation stories, including the row 
between Unilever and Tesco over the price of marmite, and price hikes by US 
technology firms such as Apple.
 
Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the 
financial markets, the eurozone and business.

Even though its unseasonably mild, this morning’s economic data may send a 
shiver through the City.

At 9.30am, we find out how much Britain had to borrow last month to balance 
the gap between government income and spending. It’s likely to show that the 
deficit widened to £12.2bn in November, up from just £4.8bn in October.

A poor reading may reignite concerns over the UK’s public finances as we head 
towards 2017, and a likely economic slowdown.

The data may put a few investors off their mince pies, with analysts at RBC 
Capital Markets saying:

November is traditionally a seasonally difficult month for the public 
finances, and we see a deficit of £12bn on the public sector net borrowing 
(ex-banking groups) measure.

Also coming up....

Italy’s government will be pushing on with a €20bn rescue package for its 
banks, with time running short.

Monti dei Paschi, Italy’s oldest lender, is making a last-ditch attempt to 
raise €5bn by selling shares to retail investors and investors. But this plan 
hit another roadblock last night, when the country’s bank rescue fund expressed 
concerns about a €1.5bn loan that would underpin the deal.

If the rescue plan fails, then the Italian state will have to step in.

European stock markets are expected to dip this morning, after Wall Street hit 
record highs (again) last night, and the dollar hit a new 14-year high.
