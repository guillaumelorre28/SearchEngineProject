Afternoon summary

 * MPs on the Commons Treasury committee have cast doubt on George Osborne’s 
claim to have halved the £1.7bn budget bill that the EU demanded in October. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/07/osbrone-claims-eu-1-point-7bn-uk-chancellor>
 Osborne told the committee that his claim was justified because initially it 
was not clear that the British budget rebate would apply to the £1.7bn sum. But
Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said, although 
Osborne did well to negotiate an interest-free delay before Britain had to pay 
up, the size of the bill “didn’t change a scrap” because the rebate was never 
in doubt. He told Osborne: 
Actually getting a delay, an interest-free delay, is a considerable 
achievement, and worth something. But that strong message, I can’t help 
feeling, has been somewhat distorted by a claim that we got 50% back of this 
extra payment when it seems clear, as soon as you start looking at the rules, 
that money was coming anyway ... I’m not sure that the deal you said you 
brought back was quite as good as the one that in fact was achieved by those 
negotiations.

Other MPs on the committee were also sceptical of Osborne’s claims, and one 
Conservative, Steve Baker, suggested that Osborne’s claim could make people 
less likely to believe the government when it did secure a good deal from 
Brussels.

 * Osborne has said that, if Labour votes for the government’s charter for 
budget responsibility but refuses to accepts Osborne’s spending cuts, it will 
have to explain what taxes would have to go up to fund the £30bn savings the 
charter requires. 
 * Osborne has defended his decision to aim for a £23bn surplus in 209-20. 
 * A report has said he controversial system for assessing people for the 
personal independence payment (PIP) gives a “disjointed experience” for 
claimants, with many experiencing “very long delays”.As the Press Assocation 
reports, in his first independent review of the scheme, former senior civil 
servant Paul Gray said it was too early to draw conclusions about the scheme’s 
effectiveness but he called for improvements in communication with claimants 
and the way evidence is collected. The document was published as the latest 
quarterly figures showed 208,000 PIP claims were being paid at the end of 
October, a 95% increase on the figure for July, but charities said thousands of 
ill or disabled people were still awaiting assessment. The Gray report said:

The current PIP process gives a disjointed experience for claimants. Some 
short term improvements are needed, for example to communications including 
decision letters. In the longer term, there should be a more integrated, 
digitally enabled claims process under common branding that would improve 
claimant experience and effectiveness.

 * The British parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) has 
started to question intelligence agencies over whether they requested 
redactions in the explosive US Senate report on CIA torture.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Q: These new figures include the black economy. How do you measure this?

Osborne says there are international standards that apply to this.

Tyrie says that’s it. He realises some of his questions on the rebate may have 
been “uncomfortable”, but he says it is important to get clarification on this.

I’ll post a summary shortly.

Earlier Andrew Tyrie and George Osborne were discussing a statement from an EU 
commissioner saying the rebate would apply. (See5.01pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/dec/17/cameron-and-miliband-at-pmqs-politics-live-blog#block-5491b64fe4b0b53180a01720>

Here is the text. <http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-723_en.htm> 
It is fromJacek Dominik, the budget commissioner, and dated 27 October 2014.

And here is the key quote.

For example, in 2014, the UK rebate was revised upwards by EUR 567.3 million, 
which is financed by all other Member States. This adjustment was included in 
Amending Budget 4/2014. Similarly in 2013, the UK rebate was revised upwards by 
EUR 436 million; this was budgeted in AmendingBudget

 * MPs on the Commons Treasury committee have cast doubt on George Osborne’s 
claim to have halved the £1.7bn budget bill that the EU demanded in October. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/07/osbrone-claims-eu-1-point-7bn-uk-chancellor>
 Osborne told the committee that his claim was justified because initially it 
was not clear that the British budget rebate would apply to the £1.7bn sum. But
Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said, although 
Osborne did well to negotiate an interest-free delay before Britain had to pay 
up, the size of the bill “didn’t change a scrap” because the rebate was never 
in doubt. He told Osborne: 
Actually getting a delay, an interest-free delay, is a considerable 
achievement, and worth something. But that strong message, I can’t help 
feeling, has been somewhat distorted by a claim that we got 50% back of this 
extra payment when it seems clear, as soon as you start looking at the rules, 
that money was coming anyway ... I’m not sure that the deal you said you 
brought back was quite as good as the one that in fact was achieved by those 
negotiations.

Other MPs on the committee were also sceptical of Osborne’s claims, and one 
Conservative, Steve Baker, suggested that Osborne’s claim could make people 
less likely to believe the government when it did secure a good deal from 
Brussels.

 * Osborne has said that, if Labour votes for the government’s charter for 
budget responsibility but refuses to accepts Osborne’s spending cuts, it will 
have to explain what taxes would have to go up to fund the £30bn savings the 
charter requires. 
 * Osborne has defended his decision to aim for a £23bn surplus in 209-20. 
 * A report has said he controversial system for assessing people for the 
personal independence payment (PIP) gives a “disjointed experience” for 
claimants, with many experiencing “very long delays”.As the Press Assocation 
reports, in his first independent review of the scheme, former senior civil 
servant Paul Gray said it was too early to draw conclusions about the scheme’s 
effectiveness but he called for improvements in communication with claimants 
and the way evidence is collected. The document was published as the latest 
quarterly figures showed 208,000 PIP claims were being paid at the end of 
October, a 95% increase on the figure for July, but charities said thousands of 
ill or disabled people were still awaiting assessment. The Gray report said:

The current PIP process gives a disjointed experience for claimants. Some 
short term improvements are needed, for example to communications including 
decision letters. In the longer term, there should be a more integrated, 
digitally enabled claims process under common branding that would improve 
claimant experience and effectiveness.

 * The British parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) has 
started to question intelligence agencies over whether they requested 
redactions in the explosive US Senate report on CIA torture. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/17/cia-torture-report-uk-inquiry-redactions>

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Alok Sharma goes next.

Q: These new figures include the black economy. How do you measure this?

Osborne says there are international standards that apply to this.

Tyrie says that’s it. He realises some of his questions on the rebate may have 
been “uncomfortable”, but he says it is important to get clarification on this.

I’ll post a summary shortly.
 
John Mann goes next.

Q: Could you provide us with all the written documents provided to you on this?

Tyrie says the committee will have to discuss this request.

Osborne says he will look into this.
 
Q: Will this affair undermine future government claims to have achieved a good 
deal in Britain?

No, says Osborne. He says the government has shown it can achieve good deals 
for the UK.
 
Steve Baker, a Conservative, goes next.

Q: Isn’t this illustrative of the highly unsatisfactory nature of our 
relationship with the EU?

Osborne says he and Baker both want to see changes to Britain’s relationship 
with the EU.
 
Earlier Andrew Tyrie and George Osborne were discussing a statement from an EU 
commissioner saying the rebate would apply. (See5.01pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/dec/17/cameron-and-miliband-at-pmqs-politics-live-blog#block-5491b64fe4b0b53180a01720>

Here is the text. <http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-723_en.htm> 
It is fromJacek Dominik, the budget commissioner, and dated 27 October 2014.

And here is the key quote.

For example, in 2014, the UK rebate was revised upwards by EUR 567.3 million, 
which is financed by all other Member States. This adjustment was included in 
Amending Budget 4/2014. Similarly in 2013, the UK rebate was revised upwards by 
EUR 436 million; this was budgeted in AmendingBudget 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget> 6/2013.
