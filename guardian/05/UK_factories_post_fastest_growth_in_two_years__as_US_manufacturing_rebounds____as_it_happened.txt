European shares turn in mixed performance

With a timetable for Brexit now unveiled, the pound dropped sharply but UK 
shares went in the opposite direction.

The UK currency is currently down 1% against the dollar and down a similar 
amount against the euro to a three year low, while the Bank of England’s 
trade-weighted sterling index is down more than 1% to a six and a half year low.

Uncertainties over the status of trade deals and economic growth once Brexit 
has happened has hit the pound, but conversely the FTSE 100 was flying, lifted 
by exporters benefitting from weaker sterling.

The UK index almost broke through the 7000 barrier for the first time since 
May 2015, but failed to quite make it. Elsewhere European markets were more 
mixed, although Germany was shut for a holiday.

Worries about Deutsche Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank>
 continued to weigh on its US shares and helped pull the whole financial sector 
lower on Wall Street. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 84.19 points or 1.22% higher at 6983.52 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.12% at 4453.56 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 16,273.95 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 8751.6 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.74% to 569.72 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 88 points 
or 0.48%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Cutting interest rates further would increase risks - ECB board member

The European Central Bank’s negative interest rate policy has side effects and 
cutting them further would come with increasing risks, says ECB board member 
Yves Mersch.

In a speech in Luxembourg 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html>, Mersch 
said:

We are aware... that in particular our non-standard policy measures come with 
side effects. Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the 
full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary 
policy action on banks.

Low rates put pressure on banks’ profitability, particularly on banks which 
are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative 
interest rates will significantly reduce banks’ profitability over the next 
five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%.

Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and 
ECB staff estimates show that theoverall impact on bank profitability of recent 
monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no 
monetary policy action[2 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html#footnote.2>
]. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank 
that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust 
business model to stay in the market.

Mersh added:

Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area 
has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line 
with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we 
had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies 
more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are 
implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be.

Although the notion of a “zero lower bound” no longer stands, there is a limit 
to how low interest rates can go – the point at which the costs of lower rates 
incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we 
have reached the “effective lower bound” or that it might be not that far from 
the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%.

This level I would still deem to be “mildly negative” – but I would shy away 
from moving into “wildly negative” territory. Cutting interest rates even more 
would come with increasing risks as reactions to such cuts might not always be 
linear.

The continuing fall in the pound is not necessarily a major reason for 
concern, according to Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics:

While the latest dip in sterling has partly reflected concerns over the 
prospect of a “hard Brexit”, the currency’s depreciation should continue to 
cushion the economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.

Sterling’s latest drop appears to have been at least partly prompted by 
speculation that the UK government is willing to accept a hard form of Brexit, 
in which the country would forego full access to the EU single market, in order 
to secure full control over its borders. Along with confirmation that the 
Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased 
concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.

But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency’s 
depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a 
move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the 
economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that 
the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the 
conditions that a “soft Brexit” might imply.

Second, the key driver of sterling’s depreciation (against the US dollar at 
least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US 
interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general “Brexit premium” 
being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly 
depreciation.

And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a 
substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. 
Monday’s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the 
export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the 
growth of actual exports in the coming months.

Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a “sweet spot” in which the 
beneficial effects of the pound’s drop have been felt before the adverse 
effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that 
the pound’s fall remains relatively orderly – our forecast is that it will fall 
from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year – we expect the inflationary effects 
to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to 
support growth.

Greek pensioner protests overshadow budget unveiling

Helena Smith

Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners 
peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to 
the government – just as it tables next year’s budget in parliament. Helena 
Smith reports from Athens

The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police 
overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have 
come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all 
leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners 
who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return 
for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today’s (otherwise low-key) 
rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the 
beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras’ poll 
ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he 
first assumed power in January 2015 – and in the newspaper of Avgi, the 
mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the 
Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main 
opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of 
prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks 
said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for 
Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel.

Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would 
be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally 
called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In 
an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: “After today’s incident the 
order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and 
pensioners.”

That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - 
which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 
per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year – 
being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick 
up on the fact that it also projects an extra €1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes 
– prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on 
the way.

The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on 
Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:

Looking to Friday’s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered 
encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job 
creation. This index rose to 49.7, up from 48.3, while also rising above the 
six month moving average of 49.4. With the consumer confidence report showing a 
marked pick-up in households feeling that jobs are “plentiful” the signs look 
pretty good for a decent rebound following a rather disappointing 151,000 gain 
last month.

Despite the ISM manufacturing data strengthening the case for the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates before the end of the year, analysts are 
divided about whether it will actually happen.

David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: 

Last month the US manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in six 
months. It was one of the major data releases which led many commentators to 
doubt that the Fed would hike rates at its September meeting. Today’s release 
has gone some way to countering fears that the US economy isn’t as robust as 
the FOMC would like us to believe. In that respect, it strengthens the 
likelihood of a December hike. Later this week we’ll get an update on the 
services sector with Non-Farm Payrolls wrapping things up on Friday. If the 
data comes in better-than-expected, the we should see the dollar strengthen 
further.

But Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

It has been a tough few months for US manufacturing, so Janet Yellen and her 
colleagues at the Fed will be happy to see an above expectations rise on the 
ISM PMI gauge for September.

The reading signifies a return to expansion for the manufacturing sector, and 
will provide another tick for the Fed’s widely-expected interest rate hike 
later this year.

However, that rate increase remains contingent on stable growth, and as we 
enter the final weeks of a highly contentious presidential election, unpleasant 
surprises could be just around the corner.

US manufacturing rebounds in September - ISM

If Markit’s survey is showing a slowdown in US manufacturing growth, then a 
second survey is more positive.

The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index jumped to 51.5 in 
September, a turnaround from August’s surprisingly weak 49.4. Anything below 50 
shows contraction, so the September figure shows a return to growth.

The outcome is better than the 50.3 expected by analysts. The new orders and 
employment indices were also higher than had been forecast.

Markit’s chief business economist Chris Williamson has a rather downbeat view 
on the US PMI data. He said:


Manufacturing growth slowed to a crawl in September, suggesting the economy is 
stuck in a soft-patch amid widespread uncertainty in the lead up to the 
presidential election.

The survey saw firms pulling back on expanding production and focusing instead 
on cost-cutting, as inflows of new business slowed to the weakest seen so far 
this year.

Any growth is largely being driven by the consumer, in turn helped by 
tail-winds of low interest rates, low inflation and a solid labour market.

Business spending, in contrast, is being subdued by the headwinds of 
uncertainty about the economic outlook, cost-driven inventory reduction and the 
strong dollar, the latter linked to yet another drop in exports.

US manufacturing dipped slightly in September but came in slightly better than 
initially anticipated.

In the first of two surveys, Markit’s final manufacturing PMI for September 
was 51.5 compared to the flash estimate of 51.4 and 52 in August.

Wall Street opens lower

US markets are on the slide in early trading, as investors await a spate of 
data this week, starting with manufacturing PMIs and culminating on Friday with 
non-farm payrolls.

With oil prices coming off their best levels, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
has dropped around 70 points in early trading while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 
Composite have both opened around 0.25 lower.

The fall on Wall Street has taken the shine off shares elsewhere, with the 
FTSE 100 off its best levels at 6971, up around 72 points.

Deutsche Bank's US shares down in pre-market trading

Deutsche Bank’s shares jumped on Friday on talk it may agree a deal with the 
US Department of Justice to pay a fine of some $5.4bn over mis-selling mortage 
bonds, rather than the $14bn initial demand.

There was even some talk of a deal coming over the weekend, given some 
plausibility by the fact that the bank’s chief executive John Cryan is in the 
US. Germany’s stock market is closed today for a holiday which would - the 
theory went - give some breathing space for a deal to be done.

But so far no announcement, so the bank’s US shares - also up sharply on 
Friday - are down around 1.8% in pre-market trading, according to Reuters.

FItch cuts US growth forecast

Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data- which are expected to be fairly 
upbeat - ratings agency FItch has cut its forecast for the country’s growth 
this year.

In its latest bi-monthly Global Economic Outlook, Fitch says:

Downside risks to advanced country economic growth have risen in recent 
months... With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of 
political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has 
increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger 
growth appears to be diminishing...

With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no 
significant changes to Fitch’s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite 
significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is 
best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth 
over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual 
average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to 
advanced country growth have increased.

“The rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to 
increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, 
both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private 
sector investment,” added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.

On the US in particular it says:

Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today’s 
Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].

“This year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 
2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier 
appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,” said 
[Coulton].

Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:

Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may 
be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank 
profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, 
reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are 
complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. 
Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest 
rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on 
inflation expectations.

Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary 
easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal 
stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is 
increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be 
hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a 
co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in 
the short term.

 The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary 
policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. 
With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying 
inflation close to the Fed’s target and the labour market holding up, the 
conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in 
the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing 
programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely 
need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach 
adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the 
policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ 
to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year 
JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to 
-0.5% by end-2017.

In the UK, the Bank of England’s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early 
August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly 
better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance 
to cut rates again before year-end.

In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:

Most importantly, China’s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp 
slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. 
Russia’s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real 
wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In 
Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new 
leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support 
confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end.

Summary: Factories fly, but pound slides

Time for a catch-up, as City traders scoff down a quick sandwich before facing 
another volley of economic data from across the Atlantic.

Activity in Britain’s factory sector has grown at its fastest pace since June 
2014, bolstering hopes that the EU referendum won’t trigger a recession 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live?page=with:block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae#block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae>
.

Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the 
weak pound helps firms sell overseas.

Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health 
right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter.

Capital Economics, for example, say:

The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic 
and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit 
vote well. And the sector should contribute to an expansion in GDP in Q3.

In the Eurozone, Germany’s manufacturing firms also had a good month

. France, Ireland and the Netherlands did less well, though, while Greece 
slipped back into contraction.

The pound has fallen by 1%, close to a 31-year low against the US dollar. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live?page=with:block-57f20914e4b015be638339b5#block-57f20914e4b015be638339b5>
 The selloff was sparked by prime minister Theresa May laying out her Brexit 
plans. Analysts fear that sterling will remain weak, as the government appears 
to be heading towards a hard Brexit.

Currently, the pound is hovering around $1.288 against the US dollar - a three 
month low. It’s also close to the 31-year low struck in late June.

Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets says the City is worried about the prospect of 
Smexit - or exit from the Single Market.

For businesses whose prospects are sensitive to the freedoms of Single Market 
membership, the Prime Minister’s broad message is the clearest signal yet that 
Brexit could force potentially significant changes to current arrangements with 
EU countries.

It is too soon to know whether or not successor arrangements will end up being 
better or worse for the UK’s prosperity in the long run. But, even if current 
economic data suggests economic performance is showing resilience to the 
referendum result, May’s stance is a reminder that uncertainties related to 
Smexit turbulence could be costly for the economy in the short run.

But London’s stock market is romping ahead, hitting a new 16-month high today.

There’s not much cheer in Greece this morning, as the government prepares to 
present its 2017 budget to parliament.

First up, Markit reported that Greece’s manufacturing sector shrank in 
September - after posting some much needed growth in August.

The manufacturing PMI fell to 49.2 points last month from 50.4 in August, 
indicating activity contracted.

That won’t help Athens hit its growth and fiscal surplus targets, set with its 
lenders in return for a third bailout.

Meanwhile on the streets, Greek pensioners have scuffled with riot police 
during a protest against pension cuts. Local media report that the police fired 
pepper spray at the crowds.

James Knightley of ING also believes there is “significant doubt” that the 
Bank of England will cut interest rates at its next meeting, in November.

It all depends on the economic data, including a healthcheck on the dominant 
services sector on Wednesday.

We will see later this week if the (much larger) service sector is rebounding 
to the same extent. If not...then there remains a case for further BoE stimulus 
later this year.

However, if the service PMI does indeed improve then it is looking as though 
the BoE will hold off until the new year and it will be up to Chancellor Philip 
Hammond to provide some medium to longer term fiscal support in November

With a timetable for Brexit now unveiled, the pound dropped sharply but UK 
shares went in the opposite direction.

The UK currency is currently down 1% against the dollar and down a similar 
amount against the euro to a three year low, while the Bank of England’s 
trade-weighted sterling index is down more than 1% to a six and a half year low.

Uncertainties over the status of trade deals and economic growth once Brexit 
has happened has hit the pound, but conversely the FTSE 100 was flying, lifted 
by exporters benefitting from weaker sterling.

The UK index almost broke through the 7000 barrier for the first time since 
May 2015, but failed to quite make it. Elsewhere European markets were more 
mixed, although Germany was shut for a holiday.

Worries about Deutsche Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank>
 continued to weigh on its US shares and helped pull the whole financial sector 
lower on Wall Street. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 84.19 points or 1.22% higher at 6983.52 
 * France’s Cac closed up 0.12% at 4453.56 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 16,273.95 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 8751.6 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.74% to 569.72 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 88 points 
or 0.48%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
The European Central Bank’s negative interest rate policy has side effects and 
cutting them further would come with increasing risks, says ECB board member 
Yves Mersch.

In a speech in Luxembourg 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html>, Mersch 
said:

We are aware... that in particular our non-standard policy measures come with 
side effects. Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the 
full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary 
policy action on banks.

Low rates put pressure on banks’ profitability, particularly on banks which 
are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative 
interest rates will significantly reduce banks’ profitability over the next 
five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%.

Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and 
ECB staff estimates show that theoverall impact on bank profitability of recent 
monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no 
monetary policy action[2 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html#footnote.2>
]. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank 
that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust 
business model to stay in the market.

Mersh added:

Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area 
has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line 
with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we 
had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies 
more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are 
implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be.

Although the notion of a “zero lower bound” no longer stands, there is a limit 
to how low interest rates can go – the point at which the costs of lower rates 
incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we 
have reached the “effective lower bound” or that it might be not that far from 
the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%.

This level I would still deem to be “mildly negative” – but I would shy away 
from moving into “wildly negative” territory. Cutting interest rates even more 
would come with increasing risks as reactions to such cuts might not always be 
linear.
 
The continuing fall in the pound is not necessarily a major reason for 
concern, according to Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics:

While the latest dip in sterling has partly reflected concerns over the 
prospect of a “hard Brexit”, the currency’s depreciation should continue to 
cushion the economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.

Sterling’s latest drop appears to have been at least partly prompted by 
speculation that the UK government is willing to accept a hard form of Brexit, 
in which the country would forego full access to the EU single market, in order 
to secure full control over its borders. Along with confirmation that the 
Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased 
concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.

But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency’s 
depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a 
move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the 
economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that 
the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the 
conditions that a “soft Brexit” might imply.

Second, the key driver of sterling’s depreciation (against the US dollar at 
least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US 
interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general “Brexit premium” 
being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly 
depreciation.

And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a 
substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. 
Monday’s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the 
export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the 
growth of actual exports in the coming months.

Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a “sweet spot” in which the 
beneficial effects of the pound’s drop have been felt before the adverse 
effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that 
the pound’s fall remains relatively orderly – our forecast is that it will fall 
from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year – we expect the inflationary effects 
to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to 
support growth.
 
Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners 
peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to 
the government – just as it tables next year’s budget in parliament. Helena 
Smith reports from Athens

The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police 
overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have 
come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all 
leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners 
who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return 
for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today’s (otherwise low-key) 
rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the 
beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras’ poll 
ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he 
first assumed power in January 2015 – and in the newspaper of Avgi, the 
mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the 
Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main 
opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of 
prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks 
said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for 
Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel.

Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would 
be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally 
called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In 
an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: “After today’s incident the 
order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and 
pensioners.”

That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - 
which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 
per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year – 
being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick 
up on the fact that it also projects an extra €1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes 
– prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on 
the way.

Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank’s US shares have now dropped by 
around 2.5%.
 
The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on 
Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:

Looking to Friday’s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered 
encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job 
creation. This index rose to 49.7, up from 48.3, while also rising above the 
six month moving average of 49.4. With the consumer confidence report showing a 
marked pick-up in households feeling that jobs are “plentiful” the signs look 
pretty good for a decent rebound following a rather disappointing 151,000 gain 
last month.
 
Despite the ISM manufacturing data strengthening the case for the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates before the end of the year, analysts are 
divided about whether it will actually happen.

David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: 

Last month the US manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in six 
months. It was one of the major data releases which led many commentators to 
doubt that the Fed would hike rates at its September meeting. Today’s release 
has gone some way to countering fears that the US economy isn’t as robust as 
the FOMC would like us to believe. In that respect, it strengthens the 
likelihood of a December hike. Later this week we’ll get an update on the 
services sector with Non-Farm Payrolls wrapping things up on Friday. If the 
data comes in better-than-expected, the we should see the dollar strengthen 
further.

But Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

It has been a tough few months for US manufacturing, so Janet Yellen and her 
colleagues at the Fed will be happy to see an above expectations rise on the 
ISM PMI gauge for September.

The reading signifies a return to expansion for the manufacturing sector, and 
will provide another tick for the Fed’s widely-expected interest rate hike 
later this year.

However, that rate increase remains contingent on stable growth, and as we 
enter the final weeks of a highly contentious presidential election, unpleasant 
surprises could be just around the corner.
 
If Markit’s survey is showing a slowdown in US manufacturing growth, then a 
second survey is more positive.

The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index jumped to 51.5 in 
September, a turnaround from August’s surprisingly weak 49.4. Anything below 50 
shows contraction, so the September figure shows a return to growth.

The outcome is better than the 50.3 expected by analysts. The new orders and 
employment indices were also higher than had been forecast.
 
Markit’s chief business economist Chris Williamson has a rather downbeat view 
on the US PMI data. He said:


Manufacturing growth slowed to a crawl in September, suggesting the economy is 
stuck in a soft-patch amid widespread uncertainty in the lead up to the 
presidential election.

The survey saw firms pulling back on expanding production and focusing instead 
on cost-cutting, as inflows of new business slowed to the weakest seen so far 
this year.

Any growth is largely being driven by the consumer, in turn helped by 
tail-winds of low interest rates, low inflation and a solid labour market.

Business spending, in contrast, is being subdued by the headwinds of 
uncertainty about the economic outlook, cost-driven inventory reduction and the 
strong dollar, the latter linked to yet another drop in exports.

US manufacturing dipped slightly in September but came in slightly better than 
initially anticipated.

In the first of two surveys, Markit’s final manufacturing PMI for September 
was 51.5 compared to the flash estimate of 51.4 and 52 in August.
 
Deutsche Bank’s US shares are currently down around 1.2% in early trading, as 
investors await any signs that a deal on its Department of Justice fine may be 
near.
 
US markets are on the slide in early trading, as investors await a spate of 
data this week, starting with manufacturing PMIs and culminating on Friday with 
non-farm payrolls.

With oil prices coming off their best levels, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
has dropped around 70 points in early trading while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 
Composite have both opened around 0.25 lower.

The fall on Wall Street has taken the shine off shares elsewhere, with the 
FTSE 100 off its best levels at 6971, up around 72 points.
 
Deutsche Bank’s shares jumped on Friday on talk it may agree a deal with the 
US Department of Justice to pay a fine of some $5.4bn over mis-selling mortage 
bonds, rather than the $14bn initial demand.

There was even some talk of a deal coming over the weekend, given some 
plausibility by the fact that the bank’s chief executive John Cryan is in the 
US. Germany’s stock market is closed today for a holiday which would - the 
theory went - give some breathing space for a deal to be done.

But so far no announcement, so the bank’s US shares - also up sharply on 
Friday - are down around 1.8% in pre-market trading, according to Reuters.
 
And here is a sign of improvement in Asia:

Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data- which are expected to be fairly 
upbeat - ratings agency FItch has cut its forecast for the country’s growth 
this year.

In its latest bi-monthly Global Economic Outlook, Fitch says:

Downside risks to advanced country economic growth have risen in recent 
months... With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of 
political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has 
increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger 
growth appears to be diminishing...

With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no 
significant changes to Fitch’s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite 
significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is 
best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth 
over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual 
average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to 
advanced country growth have increased.

“The rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to 
increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, 
both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private 
sector investment,” added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.

On the US in particular it says:

Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today’s 
Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].

“This year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 
2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier 
appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,” said 
[Coulton].

Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:

Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may 
be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank 
profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, 
reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are 
complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. 
Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest 
rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on 
inflation expectations.

Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary 
easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal 
stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is 
increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be 
hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a 
co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in 
the short term.

 The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary 
policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. 
With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying 
inflation close to the Fed’s target and the labour market holding up, the 
conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in 
the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing 
programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely 
need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach 
adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the 
policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ 
to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year 
JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to 
-0.5% by end-2017.

In the UK, the Bank of England’s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early 
August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly 
better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance 
to cut rates again before year-end.

In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:

Most importantly, China’s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp 
slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. 
Russia’s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real 
wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In 
Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new 
leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support 
confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end.

.

Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the 
weak pound helps firms sell overseas.

Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health 
right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter.

Capital Economics, for example, say:

The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic 
and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit 
vote well. And the sector should contribute to an expansion in GDP in Q3.

In the Eurozone, Germany’s manufacturing firms also had a good month

. France, Ireland and the Netherlands did less well, though, while Greece 
slipped back into contraction.

The pound has fallen by 1%, close to a 31-year low against the US dollar.

 The selloff was sparked by prime minister Theresa May laying out her Brexit 
plans. Analysts fear that sterling will remain weak, as the government appears 
to be heading towards a hard Brexit.

Currently, the pound is hovering around $1.288 against the US dollar - a three 
month low. It’s also close to the 31-year low struck in late June.

Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets says the City is worried about the prospect of 
Smexit - or exit from the Single Market.

For businesses whose prospects are sensitive to the freedoms of Single Market 
membership, the Prime Minister’s broad message is the clearest signal yet that 
Brexit could force potentially significant changes to current arrangements with 
EU countries.

It is too soon to know whether or not successor arrangements will end up being 
better or worse for the UK’s prosperity in the long run. But, even if current 
economic data suggests economic performance is showing resilience to the 
referendum result, May’s stance is a reminder that uncertainties related to 
Smexit turbulence could be costly for the economy in the short run.

There’s not much cheer in Greece this morning, as the government prepares to 
present its 2017 budget to parliament.

First up, Markit reported that Greece’s manufacturing sector shrank in 
September - after posting some much needed growth in August.

The manufacturing PMI fell to 49.2 points last month from 50.4 in August, 
indicating activity contracted.

That won’t help Athens hit its growth and fiscal surplus targets, set with its 
lenders in return for a third bailout.

Meanwhile on the streets, Greek pensioners have scuffled with riot police 
during a protest against pension cuts. Local media report that the police fired 
pepper spray at the crowds.

James Knightley of ING also believes there is “significant doubt” that the 
Bank of England will cut interest rates at its next meeting, in November.

It all depends on the economic data, including a healthcheck on the dominant 
services sector on Wednesday.

We will see later this week if the (much larger) service sector is rebounding 
to the same extent. If not...then there remains a case for further BoE stimulus 
later this year.

However, if the service PMI does indeed improve then it is looking as though 
the BoE will hold off until the new year and it will be up to Chancellor Philip 
Hammond to provide some medium to longer term fiscal support in November
