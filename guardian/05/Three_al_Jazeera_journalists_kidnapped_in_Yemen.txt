 Saudi-backed fighters loyal to Yemen’s president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, are 
battling Iran-allied Houthi militia and loyalists of the country’s former 
leader in a war that has raged for nine months and in which some 6,000 people 
have been killed.

 The Qatari-funded news channel, whose reporting of the 2011 Arab Spring 
uprisings won it millions of viewers in the Middle East, has seen several of 
its journalists detained and killed in recent years in conflicts across the 
region.

 In December, it said a cameraman had died of his injuries several days after 
being shot and wounded in the flashpoint Syrian province of Homs.
