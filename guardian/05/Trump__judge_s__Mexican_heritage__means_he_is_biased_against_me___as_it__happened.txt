Today in Campaign 2016

With Donald Trump under heavy fire for declaring that a judge of Mexican 
descentcould not rule impartially

 on any case involving Trump, due to his controversial immigration policies, 
the real estate tycoon has successfully snatched a news cycle from Hillary 
Clinton.

The former secretary of state’s speech this afternoon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-speech-foreign-policy-security>
 in San Diego, in which she said that Trump’s foreign policy initiatives 
“aren’t just different – they are dangerously incoherent,” received loud kudos 
from her supporters, who saw the address as proof that she could take on the 
infamously aggressive candidate.

 * House speaker Paul Ryan, after weeks of declining to endorse Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, has finally offered his 
formal support for the presumptive Republican nominee. Ryan, the 
highest-ranking Republican in the nation, took the unprecedented step last 
month ofrefusing to back the candidate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/paul-ryan-declines-to-support-trump-as-republican-nominee>
 after the businessman all but secured the party’s presidential nomination. But 
this afternoon, Ryan declared his support in an op-ed in theJanesville Gazette 
<http://www.gazettextra.com/20160602/paul_ryan_donald_trump_can_help_make_reality_of_bold_house_policy_agenda#sthash.IfxnLHs3.dpuf>
, a local newspaper in his hometown in Wisconsin, writing that he planned to 
vote for Trump in November. “It’s no secret that he and I have our differences. 
I won’t pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I’ll continue to speak 
my mind,” Ryan wrote. “But the reality is, on the issues that make up our 
agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.”

 * Donald Trump may have accused the presiding judge in the Trump University 
fraud suit of a “conflict of interest” because of his Mexican heritage, buta 
report from the Associated Press 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/67444ec825f3460ba4aadefc0d29d22f/trump-university-model-sell-hard-demand-see-warrant>
 details a more concrete example of potential partiality: The presumptive 
Republican nomineedonated tens of thousands of dollars to attorneys general who 
declined to pursue fraud charges against the now-defunct organization.

 * Another poll of likely California voters, another two-point race: The Field 
Pollhas released a survey 
<http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2537.pdf> conducted on 
26-31 May of 571 Democrats and found Hillary Clinton a whisper “ahead” of 
Bernie Sanders, 45-43 – with a 4.1-point margin of error.Clinton led the same 
poll by 11 points in January and six points in April. That’s a trend line to 
make Sanders supporters smile.

That’s all for today - stay tuned for more breaking news from the campaign 
trail!

Donald Trump may have accused the presiding judge in the Trump University 
fraud suit of a “conflict of interest” because of his Mexican heritage, buta 
report from the Associated Press 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/67444ec825f3460ba4aadefc0d29d22f/trump-university-model-sell-hard-demand-see-warrant>
 details a more concrete example of potential partiality: The presumptive 
Republican nominee donated tens of thousands of dollars to attorneys general 
who declined to pursue fraud charges against the now-defunct organization.

Trump donated $35,000 to the gubernatorial campaign of then-Texas attorney 
general Greg Abbott - a campaign that was ultimately successful - after 
Abbott’s office dropped a 2010 probe into Trump University’s “possibly 
deceptive business practices.”

Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, who endorsed Trump the day before the 
crucial Florida primary, reportedly declined to join New York attorney general 
Eric Schneiderman’s multi-state fraud suit against the organization after the 
Donald J. Trump Foundation made a $25,000 contribution to a super-Pac 
supporting her reelection campaign.

Scott Lemieux

In a prescient piece, the Guardian’s Scott Lemieux argued today that Donald 
Trump’s bashing of a federal judge based on his ethnicity crossed a line.
Trump attacks judge overseeing Trump University case 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-attacks-judge-overseeing-trump-university-case-video>
When US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel unsealed a hoard of highly unflattering 
documents this week about Trump University, Donald Trumpresponded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-attacks-judge-overseeing-trump-university-case-video>
 the way one would expect: with bullying and race-baiting.

“They ought to look into Judge Curiel,” Trump declared, “because what Judge 
Curiel is doing is a total disgrace.” Trump also asserted that the Indiana-born 
Curiel “happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great”. Trump also called 
for Curiel to recuse himself … on the grounds that he made decisions Trump 
disagreed with.

His attacks 
<http://fusion.net/story/307971/donald-trump-judge-mexican-hater-trump-university/>
 exemplify, yet again, why the prospect of a President Trump is terrifying. 
First of all, they suggest a rather cavalier attitude towards judicial 
independence. Politicians are, needless to say, free to publicly criticize 
judges, even when they’re one of the parties before the court. But the call to 
“look into” Curielcrosses a line 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/06/01/437ccae6-280b-11e6-a3c4-0724e8e24f3f_story.html>
 towards being threatening.

Admittedly, there are limits to how much Trump could threaten judicial 
independence from the White House. Article III of the consitution provides 
various tools that could theoretically undermine the independence of the courts 
– packing federal courts with additional members selected by the president, 
stripping the courts of jurisdiction and removal from office. All of these 
actions, however, would require an act of Congress. Given that FDR’s proposal 
to pack the courts was rejected by Congress in the aftermath of a historic 
landslide in the 1936 presidential election, it’s unlikely that even a 
Trump-friendly Republican Congress would take such extreme measures.

But there’s still reason for concern. Would Trump be willing to abide by 
adverse rulings? And how much in general would Trump feel bound by legal 
constraints?

Donald Trump: Trump University judge has 'conflict of interest' because he is 
'of Mexican heritage'

Donald Trump has reiterated his objection to the presence of a federal judge 
of Mexican descent presiding over a fraud lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump 
University,telling the Wall Street Journal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442>
 that US district judge Gonzalo Curiel’s assignment to the case represents “an 
absolute conflict” because he is “of Mexican heritage.”

“I’m building a wall,” Trump said, of his proposed 2.000-mile wall along the 
US-Mexico border with the stated goal of preventing undocumented immigrants 
from entering the country. “It’s an inherent conflict of interest.”

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s statements - which run 
counter to the traditional legal understanding of requirements for judicial 
recusal - follow a speech the candidate gave in San Diego last week, in which 
he lambasted Curiel as “a hater of Donald Trump” and “a total disgrace.”

Former Mexican president: I'll debate Donald Trump

Former president of Mexico Vicente Fox has challenged presumptive Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to a debate, mano a mano.

“I’m willing to come here, to come here to the states, if it’s for a debate,” 
Fox toldWABC Radio’s Rita Cosby 
<https://audioboom.com/boos/4647986-rita-cosby-with-former-mexican-president-vicente-fox>
. “A direct, personal debate with him.”

After calling Trump “a real danger” to the future of the US and to his native 
Mexico, Fox said that he would be willing to debate Trump, because “the 
presidency of this great nation has a strong influence everywhere else in the 
world.

“We are highly worried about his attitude, about his warrior stance, that he 
wants to fight with everybody,” Fox said.

“I would love to” meet with Trump, Fox continued, if Trump apologized to the 
millions of Mexican nationals who he has offended. “Yes, I would debate him 
here in the states - or have him down for a free lunch in Mexico.”

Fox was less conciliatory towards Trump in February, when he called him “a 
crazy guy”in an interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/donald-trump-former-mexico-president-vincente-fox-im-not-paying-for-wall>
 with Univision’s Jorge Ramos. At the time, Fox responded to Trump’s 
declaration that Mexico would be forced to build a fence along its nearly 
2,000-mile border with the US by declaring that “I’m not going to pay for that 
fucking wall. He should pay for it. He’s got the money.”

Former House speaker and onetime presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has 
lauded current House speaker Paul Ryan’s endorsement of presumptive Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, calling the delayed 
endorsement “the right way to do it.”
Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) 
Speaker Paul Ryan showed real leadership in patiently working through key 
issues and then endorsing Trump. The right way to do it.
 <https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/738449167685713920> June 2, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/738449167685713920> 
But Gingrich didn’t always feel so warmly about Ryan’s wait-and-see tactics 
for endorsement. Four weeks ago, the former Georgia congressman called Ryan’s 
decision “dangerous.”

“It was also in some ways a demonstration of fear and weakness,” Gingrich 
wrote in the Washington Examiner 
<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gingrich-paul-ryan-showed-fear-and-weakness-not-endorsing-trump/article/2590776>
 at the time. “Faced with an amazing avalanche of personal victories for Trump, 
Ryan apparently felt he needed a big enough event to get Trump’s attention. 
This is a very dangerous game.”

Whether, in his heart of hearts, Gingrich views Ryan’s “patiently working 
through” his endorsement as an example of “the right way to do it” or as a 
“demonstration of fear and weakness” is up for debate.

Senior advisers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> are lashing out at former 
secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy acumen after the likely 
Democratic nominee gave a blistering speech in San Diego this afternoon, 
calling Trump’s ideas “dangerously incoherent.”

“You see chaos, death and destruction everywhere you look,” Trump adviser 
Stephen Miller told CNN after Clinton’s address. “That is Hillary Clinton’s 
foreign policy signature: A trail of blood and death in her wake.”


Calling Clinton “worst secretary of state in American history,” Miller accused 
the Democratic frontrunner of representing “an internationalist, America-last 
foreign policy that seeks to nation build and spread democracy with American 
blood and dollars that has proven to be a catastrophic failure.”

“The most important qualifying factor when it comes to our nation’s foreign 
policy is philosophy,” Miller said, defending Trump. “Philosophy is ‘America 
First.’ ”

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> has released a statement 
responding to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy 
speech, which did not mention him either obliquely or by name. Charging that 
anyone who voted in favor of authorizing George W. Bush to invade Iraq has 
little business deriding anyone else’s foreign policy bona fides, Sanders 
declared that Clinton’s tenure has been characterized by action “without 
thinking of the consequences.”


“I agree with Secretary Clinton that Donald Trump’s foreign policy ideas are 
incredibly reckless and irresponsible,” Sanders wrote. “But when it comes to 
foreign policy, we cannot forget that Secretary Clinton voted for the war in 
Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history, and that she 
has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through 
the consequences.”

“We need a foreign policy based on building coalitions and making certain that 
the brave American men and women in our military do not get bogged down in 
perpetual warfare in the Middle East. That’s what I will fight for as 
president.”

Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has issued a 
statement on House speaker Paul Ryan’s endorsement of presumptive Republican 
nomineeDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, calling 
Ryan’s “tepid, halfhearted” endorsement evidence of a “lack of conviction.”

“When he initially refused to endorse Trump four weeks ago, Paul Ryan said it 
was time to set aside bullying and belittlement,” Wasserman Schultz wrote in 
the statement. “But with his tepid, halfhearted endorsement today, Ryan has 
backed away from his own criticisms of Trump’s dangerous, divisive campaign, 
bowed down, kissed the ring, and conceded that Trump is the leader of the 
Republican Party.

““Ryan’s lack of conviction isn’t exactly news though,” Wasserman Schultz 
continued. “On issue after issue, Ryan’s ideas are almost as bad as Trump’s.”

“The failed Romney-Ryan presidential ticket in 2012 was the catalyst for a GOP 
autopsy report that said Republican leaders should move the party in a new 
direction. Trump has soaked that report in gasoline and Paul Ryan just lit the 
match that’s about to turn it to ashes.”

In an interview with Rolling Stone 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/hamilton-creator-lin-manuel-miranda-the-rolling-stone-interview-20160601?page=3>
, Hamilton creator andcertified genius <https://www.macfound.org/fellows/941/> 
Lin-Manuel Miranda says that although the 2016 campaign is ugly, it’s not any 
more acrimonious than the election of 1800.
 Seriously if you can get tickets it’s so worth mortgaging your house.

“Yes, this election cycle is bizarre,” the Pulitzer-winning Miranda said. “But 
it’s no more bizarre than the election in 1800, wherein Jefferson accused Adams 
of being a hermaphrodite and Adams responded by [spreading rumors] that 
Jefferson died, so Adams would be the only viable candidate. He was counting on 
news to travel slow! That, weirdly, gives me hope.”

Miranda also said that the notion of making America “great again” belies the 
fact that the nation’s founders were far from perfect themselves.

“I think the notion of our Founders being these perfect men who got these 
stone tablets from the sky that became our Constitution and Bill of Rights is 
bullshit,” Miranda said. “They did a remarkable thing in sticking the landing 
from revolution to government. That’s the hardest thing to do. You can go 
across the ocean to France, where they totally fucked it up and then got stuck 
in a cycle of revolution and tyranny. So that’s not nothing.”

The San Diego Union-Tribune’s editorial board 
<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jun/02/time-to-send-trump-a-message-gop/>
 has suggested to its Republican readers that, rather than voting for 
presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, they write in “Ronald Reagan” in 
next Tuesday’s primary.

Calling Trump “the Great Excommunicator,” the board draws a negative 
comparison between the candidate and Reagan, whose presidency is still viewed 
fondly by conservatives more than a quarter century after its end.

“[Trump] doesn’t deserve the party’s mandate,” the board wrote. “If you are 
voting in the GOP primary Tuesday, write in Ronald Reagan for president. Maybe 
Trump will get the message.”

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sees in Donald Trump an existential 
threat to the future of the Republican party among Latino voters,according to 
an interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/politics/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-hispanics/index.html>
 with CNN this afternoon.

“I think the attacks that he’s routinely engaged in, for example, going after 
Susana Martinez, the Republican governor of New Mexico, the chairman of the 
Republican Governors’ Association, I think, was a big mistake,” McConnell told 
Jake Tapper.


When asked if he was worried about a Latino departure from the Republican 
party similar to the mass migration of African Americans to the Democratic 
party in the 1960s after the nomination of Barry Goldwater, McConnell said “I 
do. I do.”

Citing Goldwater’s vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, McConnell said, “It 
did define our party, for at least African American voters, and it still does 
today. That was a complete shift that occurred that year and we’ve never be 
able to get them back. So I think it was a defining moment for Republicans with 
regard to the accomplishments that we had made for African-Americans going back 
to the Civil War.”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> “personally 
pocketed $5m” from his Trump University “scam”, New York’s attorney general 
said today.


“This never was a university. The fraud started with the name of the 
organization,” said Eric Schneiderman, who is suing Trump University in New 
York over allegations of fraud. “It really was a fraud from beginning to end.”

Schneiderman said Trump “bilked people out of millions of dollars” and 
promised to “make sure he pays it back”.

“Thousands of people paid millions of dollars believing that he would tell 
them his real estate secrets,” Schneiderman toldABC News’s Good Morning America 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ny-attorney-general-slams-trump-university-fraud-beginning/story?id=39552689>
. “And we know from his own sworn testimony … that he didn’t write the

Schneiderman said he will demand that the presumptive Republican presidential 
nominee takes the stand when his case comes to court, by which time the real 
estate magnate could be president. “He doesn’t have immunity from civil fraud 
trials,” he said.

Trump is currently facing three class action lawsuits against Trump University 
over allegations of fraud. Trump denies all the charges and has vowed to fight 
them all in court.

Clinton: 'Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?'

Clinton narrates the Bin Laden raid and then says:

“Imagine Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
sitting in the situation room making life-and-death decisions with the lives of 
American soldiers...

“Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he’s 
angry, but the entire American arsenal...

“Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?”

“Making Donald Trump commander-in-chief would be an historic mistake.”

Don’t let anybody tell you that America isn’t great. Donald Trump’s got the 
country all wrong.

“This election is a choice between two very different visions,” Clinton says. 
Afraid versus hopeful, discouraged versus confident.

 on any case involving Trump, due to his controversial immigration policies, 
the real estate tycoon has successfully snatched a news cycle from Hillary 
Clinton.

The former secretary of state’s speech this afternoon

 in San Diego, in which she said that Trump’s foreign policy initiatives

, a local newspaper in his hometown in Wisconsin, writing that he planned to 
vote for Trump in November. “It’s no secret that he and I have our differences. 
I won’t pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I’ll continue to speak 
my mind,” Ryan wrote. “But the reality is, on the issues that make up our 
agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.”

Donald Trump may have accused the presiding judge in the Trump University 
fraud suit of a “conflict of interest” because of his Mexican heritage, buta 
report from the Associated Press 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/67444ec825f3460ba4aadefc0d29d22f/trump-university-model-sell-hard-demand-see-warrant>
 details a more concrete example of potential partiality: The presumptive 
Republican nominee donated tens of thousands of dollars to attorneys general 
who declined to pursue fraud charges against the now-defunct organization.

Trump donated $35,000 to the gubernatorial campaign of then-Texas attorney 
general Greg Abbott - a campaign that was ultimately successful - after 
Abbott’s office dropped a 2010 probe into Trump University’s “possibly 
deceptive business practices.”

Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, who endorsed Trump the day before the 
crucial Florida primary, reportedly declined to join New York attorney general 
Eric Schneiderman’s multi-state fraud suit against the organization after the 
Donald J. Trump Foundation made a $25,000 contribution to a super-Pac 
supporting her reelection campaign.
 
In a prescient piece, the Guardian’s Scott Lemieux argued today that Donald 
Trump’s bashing of a federal judge based on his ethnicity crossed a line.
Trump attacks judge overseeing Trump University case 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-attacks-judge-overseeing-trump-university-case-video>
When US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel unsealed a hoard of highly unflattering 
documents this week about Trump University, Donald Trumpresponded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-attacks-judge-overseeing-trump-university-case-video>
 the way one would expect: with bullying and race-baiting.

“They ought to look into Judge Curiel,” Trump declared, “because what Judge 
Curiel is doing is a total disgrace.” Trump also asserted that the Indiana-born 
Curiel “happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great”. Trump also called 
for Curiel to recuse himself … on the grounds that he made decisions Trump 
disagreed with.

His attacks 
<http://fusion.net/story/307971/donald-trump-judge-mexican-hater-trump-university/>
 exemplify, yet again, why the prospect of a President Trump is terrifying. 
First of all, they suggest a rather cavalier attitude towards judicial 
independence. Politicians are, needless to say, free to publicly criticize 
judges, even when they’re one of the parties before the court. But the call to 
“look into” Curielcrosses a line 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/06/01/437ccae6-280b-11e6-a3c4-0724e8e24f3f_story.html>
 towards being threatening.

Admittedly, there are limits to how much Trump could threaten judicial 
independence from the White House. Article III of the consitution provides 
various tools that could theoretically undermine the independence of the courts 
– packing federal courts with additional members selected by the president, 
stripping the courts of jurisdiction and removal from office. All of these 
actions, however, would require an act of Congress. Given that FDR’s proposal 
to pack the courts was rejected by Congress in the aftermath of a historic 
landslide in the 1936 presidential election, it’s unlikely that even a 
Trump-friendly Republican Congress would take such extreme measures.

But there’s still reason for concern. Would Trump be willing to abide by 
adverse rulings? And how much in general would Trump feel bound by legal 
constraints?

Donald Trump has reiterated his objection to the presence of a federal judge 
of Mexican descent presiding over a fraud lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump 
University,telling the Wall Street Journal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442>
 that US district judge Gonzalo Curiel’s assignment to the case represents “an 
absolute conflict” because he is “of Mexican heritage.”

“I’m building a wall,” Trump said, of his proposed 2.000-mile wall along the 
US-Mexico border with the stated goal of preventing undocumented immigrants 
from entering the country. “It’s an inherent conflict of interest.”

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s statements - which run 
counter to the traditional legal understanding of requirements for judicial 
recusal - follow a speech the candidate gave in San Diego last week, in which 
he lambasted Curiel as “a hater of Donald Trump” and “a total disgrace.”

Former president of Mexico Vicente Fox has challenged presumptive Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to a debate, mano a mano.

“I’m willing to come here, to come here to the states, if it’s for a debate,” 
Fox toldWABC Radio’s Rita Cosby 
<https://audioboom.com/boos/4647986-rita-cosby-with-former-mexican-president-vicente-fox>
. “A direct, personal debate with him.”

After calling Trump “a real danger” to the future of the US and to his native 
Mexico, Fox said that he would be willing to debate Trump, because “the 
presidency of this great nation has a strong influence everywhere else in the 
world.

“We are highly worried about his attitude, about his warrior stance, that he 
wants to fight with everybody,” Fox said.

“I would love to” meet with Trump, Fox continued, if Trump apologized to the 
millions of Mexican nationals who he has offended. “Yes, I would debate him 
here in the states - or have him down for a free lunch in Mexico.”

Fox was less conciliatory towards Trump in February, when he called him “a 
crazy guy”in an interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/donald-trump-former-mexico-president-vincente-fox-im-not-paying-for-wall>
 with Univision’s Jorge Ramos. At the time, Fox responded to Trump’s 
declaration that Mexico would be forced to build a fence along its nearly 
2,000-mile border with the US by declaring that “I’m not going to pay for that 
fucking wall. He should pay for it. He’s got the money.”
 
Former House speaker and onetime presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has 
lauded current House speaker Paul Ryan’s endorsement of presumptive Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, calling the delayed 
endorsement “the right way to do it.”
Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) 
Speaker Paul Ryan showed real leadership in patiently working through key 
issues and then endorsing Trump. The right way to do it.

<https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/738449167685713920> 
But Gingrich didn’t always feel so warmly about Ryan’s wait-and-see tactics 
for endorsement. Four weeks ago, the former Georgia congressman called Ryan’s 
decision “dangerous.”

“It was also in some ways a demonstration of fear and weakness,” Gingrich 
wrote in the Washington Examiner 
<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gingrich-paul-ryan-showed-fear-and-weakness-not-endorsing-trump/article/2590776>
 at the time. “Faced with an amazing avalanche of personal victories for Trump, 
Ryan apparently felt he needed a big enough event to get Trump’s attention. 
This is a very dangerous game.”

Whether, in his heart of hearts, Gingrich views Ryan’s “patiently working 
through” his endorsement as an example of “the right way to do it” or as a 
“demonstration of fear and weakness” is up for debate.
 
Senior advisers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> are lashing out at former 
secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy acumen after the likely 
Democratic nominee gave a blistering speech in San Diego this afternoon, 
calling Trump’s ideas “dangerously incoherent.”

“You see chaos, death and destruction everywhere you look,” Trump adviser 
Stephen Miller told CNN after Clinton’s address. “That is Hillary Clinton’s 
foreign policy signature: A trail of blood and death in her wake.”


Calling Clinton “worst secretary of state in American history,” Miller accused 
the Democratic frontrunner of representing “an internationalist, America-last 
foreign policy that seeks to nation build and spread democracy with American 
blood and dollars that has proven to be a catastrophic failure.”

“The most important qualifying factor when it comes to our nation’s foreign 
policy is philosophy,” Miller said, defending Trump. “Philosophy is ‘America 
First.’ ”
 
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> has released a statement 
responding to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy 
speech, which did not mention him either obliquely or by name. Charging that 
anyone who voted in favor of authorizing George W. Bush to invade Iraq has 
little business deriding anyone else’s foreign policy bona fides, Sanders 
declared that Clinton’s tenure has been characterized by action “without 
thinking of the consequences.”


“I agree with Secretary Clinton that Donald Trump’s foreign policy ideas are 
incredibly reckless and irresponsible,” Sanders wrote. “But when it comes to 
foreign policy, we cannot forget that Secretary Clinton voted for the war in 
Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history, and that she 
has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through 
the consequences.”

“We need a foreign policy based on building coalitions and making certain that 
the brave American men and women in our military do not get bogged down in 
perpetual warfare in the Middle East. That’s what I will fight for as 
president.”
 
Donald Trump responds

Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has issued a 
statement on House speaker Paul Ryan’s endorsement of presumptive Republican 
nomineeDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, calling 
Ryan’s “tepid, halfhearted” endorsement evidence of a “lack of conviction.”

“When he initially refused to endorse Trump four weeks ago, Paul Ryan said it 
was time to set aside bullying and belittlement,” Wasserman Schultz wrote in 
the statement. “But with his tepid, halfhearted endorsement today, Ryan has 
backed away from his own criticisms of Trump’s dangerous, divisive campaign, 
bowed down, kissed the ring, and conceded that Trump is the leader of the 
Republican Party.

““Ryan’s lack of conviction isn’t exactly news though,” Wasserman Schultz 
continued. “On issue after issue, Ryan’s ideas are almost as bad as Trump’s.”

“The failed Romney-Ryan presidential ticket in 2012 was the catalyst for a GOP 
autopsy report that said Republican leaders should move the party in a new 
direction. Trump has soaked that report in gasoline and Paul Ryan just lit the 
match that’s about to turn it to ashes.”

 Seriously if you can get tickets it’s so worth mortgaging your house.

“Yes, this election cycle is bizarre,” the Pulitzer-winning Miranda said. “But 
it’s no more bizarre than the election in 1800, wherein Jefferson accused Adams 
of being a hermaphrodite and Adams responded by [spreading rumors] that 
Jefferson died, so Adams would be the only viable candidate. He was counting on 
news to travel slow! That, weirdly, gives me hope.”

Miranda also said that the notion of making America “great again” belies the 
fact that the nation’s founders were far from perfect themselves.

“I think the notion of our Founders being these perfect men who got these 
stone tablets from the sky that became our Constitution and Bill of Rights is 
bullshit,” Miranda said. “They did a remarkable thing in sticking the landing 
from revolution to government. That’s the hardest thing to do. You can go 
across the ocean to France, where they totally fucked it up and then got stuck 
in a cycle of revolution and tyranny. So that’s not nothing.”
 
The San Diego Union-Tribune’s editorial board 
<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jun/02/time-to-send-trump-a-message-gop/>
 has suggested to its Republican readers that, rather than voting for 
presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, they write in “Ronald Reagan” in 
next Tuesday’s primary.

Calling Trump “the Great Excommunicator,” the board draws a negative 
comparison between the candidate and Reagan, whose presidency is still viewed 
fondly by conservatives more than a quarter century after its end.

“[Trump] doesn’t deserve the party’s mandate,” the board wrote. “If you are 
voting in the GOP primary Tuesday, write in Ronald Reagan for president. Maybe 
Trump will get the message.”
 
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sees in Donald Trump an existential 
threat to the future of the Republican party among Latino voters,according to 
an interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/politics/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-hispanics/index.html>
 with CNN this afternoon.

“I think the attacks that he’s routinely engaged in, for example, going after 
Susana Martinez, the Republican governor of New Mexico, the chairman of the 
Republican Governors’ Association, I think, was a big mistake,” McConnell told 
Jake Tapper.


When asked if he was worried about a Latino departure from the Republican 
party similar to the mass migration of African Americans to the Democratic 
party in the 1960s after the nomination of Barry Goldwater, McConnell said “I 
do. I do.”

Citing Goldwater’s vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, McConnell said, “It 
did define our party, for at least African American voters, and it still does 
today. That was a complete shift that occurred that year and we’ve never be 
able to get them back. So I think it was a defining moment for Republicans with 
regard to the accomplishments that we had made for African-Americans going back 
to the Civil War.”

The timing of the release of House speaker Paul Ryan’s endorsement of Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> was not, according to 
his communications chief, a snub of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton:

And no, while a fun coincidence, it wasn't timed to a Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> speech. Believe it or 
not, we don't follow her sched that closely.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> “personally 
pocketed $5m” from his Trump University “scam”, New York’s attorney general 
said today.


“This never was a university. The fraud started with the name of the 
organization,” said Eric Schneiderman, who is suing Trump University in New 
York over allegations of fraud. “It really was a fraud from beginning to end.”

Schneiderman said Trump “bilked people out of millions of dollars” and 
promised to “make sure he pays it back”.

“Thousands of people paid millions of dollars believing that he would tell 
them his real estate secrets,” Schneiderman toldABC News’s Good Morning America 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ny-attorney-general-slams-trump-university-fraud-beginning/story?id=39552689>
. “And we know from his own sworn testimony … that he didn’t write the 
curriculum – none of them were his secrets.”

Schneiderman said he will demand that the presumptive Republican presidential 
nominee takes the stand when his case comes to court, by which time the real 
estate magnate could be president. “He doesn’t have immunity from civil fraud 
trials,” he said.

Trump is currently facing three class action lawsuits against Trump University 
over allegations of fraud. Trump denies all the charges and has vowed to fight 
them all in court.

That’s it for Clinton. 
 
Clinton narrates the Bin Laden raid and then says:

“Imagine Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
sitting in the situation room making life-and-death decisions with the lives of 
American soldiers...

“Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he’s 
angry, but the entire American arsenal...

“Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?”

“Making Donald Trump commander-in-chief would be an historic mistake.”

Don’t let anybody tell you that America isn’t great. Donald Trump’s got the 
country all wrong.

“This election is a choice between two very different visions,” Clinton says. 
Afraid versus hopeful, discouraged versus confident.
