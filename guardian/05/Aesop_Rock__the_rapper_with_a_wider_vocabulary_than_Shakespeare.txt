Name: Aesop Rock.

Age: 37.

Appearance: Unbarbered.

You mean hairy? Bearded? One may as fruitfully set to number up the bristles 
on a porpentine as count the many tines of meaning, yo.

What? Analysis of data doth reveal that Aesop's lyrical flow is o'ertopp'd by 
none in breadth, e'en Shakespeare's.

If I'm going to understand this, you'll need to pretend to be a normal person 
for a while.OK, fine. Data scientist and designer Matt Daniels has plugged the 
lyrics of lots of rappers into a computer, calculated how many different words 
each uses, andplotted the results on a series of charts 
<http://rappers.mdaniels.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/>.

And? And Aesop Rock uses by far the widest range of words among the 85 rappers 
tested, much wider than Shakespeare's would have been in a comparable analysis 
of his plays. Indeed, many rappers did better than Shakespeare, including three 
members of the Wu-Tang clan.

Wow. They've brought him the ruckus, all right. Fo sooth.

Who is this Aesop Rock guy, anyway? He's a New Yorker called Ian Bavitz who 
has been around since the late 1990s. Depending on your point of view, he's 
famous for either the sophistication or the utter incomprehensibility of his 
lyrics.

From my point of view he's not famous at all. That's another common opinion.

He's a hipster rapper then? Basically, yes. He's recondite as hell.

So who scored badly on the Daniels scale? I don't see Fiddy impressing many 
English teachers.You're right there. 50 Cent's fourth worst, just ahead of 
Drake. In fact there seems to be a correlation between being successful and not 
using too many different words. L'il Wayne, Tupac and Kanye West are all among 
the lowest scorers.

I bet they're pretty broken up about that. Mos def. Size of vocabulary is not 
the same thing as quality of work, mind you. Jay-Z and Eminem are both barely 
average.

It probably doesn't help if you sing "My name is" about 200 times. Perhaps 
that has something to do with it.

Do say: "Would you rather have a lexis or justice?"

Don't say: "On the mic, it's my dog Will Self."
