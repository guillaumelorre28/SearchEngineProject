Honey is one of (perhaps the only) food that never goes off – in that regard, 
it is beyond seasonality and can be stored for long periods without ill effect. 
But spring is the moment when Australian bees emerge from their winter lull, 
and as the early flowers burst – the jasmine and the wattle and the flowering 
gums – bees can be seen burrowing for pollen in the luscious petals that have 
evolved to attract them.


I spoke with Robert, who runs a lovely Bee Sustainable 
<https://www.beesustainable.com.au/> shop in East Brunswick, Melbourne, which 
sells among other things beautiful local honey. You can bring your own 
container and buy it by weight, and by its floral source: yellow box, 
leatherwood, blackberry, banksia, grey box, mallee gum and so on. The banksia 
honey has the most wonderful soft flavour and is a light, golden colour, a 
stark contrast to leatherwood that’s dark, strong and candy.

We used yellow mallee for this recipe, a honey recently collected from the 
warm north west of Victoria, a region famous for its wildflowers. Robert says: 
“Honey is usually collected from bee hives from October through to March. After 
that, as the bees collect less, none is usually taken (there are exceptions) 
until spring arrives.”

 Spoonful of sugar: buy locally sourced honey over the supermarket variety.

Bees may still work all winter, if the weather is warmer than 10 or 11°C, but 
don’t usually have excess to be robbed until spring. It is really worthwhile 
searching out a supplier of specialty local honey rather than the mass produced 
stuff you get from the supermarket – the difference in flavour is astronomical.

This recipe for honey cake was given to us by a family friend. I first had a 
slice at a Rosh Hashanah celebration this time last year, a feast in honour of 
the Jewish new year. There was an array of fancies on offer, but it was this 
humble cake that caught my heart. It smells divine, has a beautiful, damp crumb 
and a caramelised crust. A wonderful cake for afternoon tea, or for a decadent 
breakfast slice.

 A cake to catch your heart. Photograph: Lauren Bamford 
Preheat the oven to 177C/350F.

In an electric mixer, mix the wet ingredients on a high speed until the 
mixture is thick and smooth. In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients until 
well combined. Slowly fold the dry ingredients through the wet ingredients and 
then add 1 ½ cups of hot water mixing very slowly, on the lowest speed. Pour 
into a greased cake tin.

Bake for 50 minutes or until a skewer, inserted into the centre of the cake, 
comes out clean.
