One of new media's highest profile practitioners, Arianna Huffington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ariannahuffington>, is aware of both the 
positive and negative effects of the net.

The Huffington Post's founder told the Sunday Times's Brian Appleyard: 
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/newsreview/features/article1295642.ece>

"I've always said the future is going to be hybrid. Old media are going to 
have to do more online and new media are going to be adopting more traditional 
journalistic practices like investigative journalism, like fact-checking and 
fairness. I never thought newspapers would die."

And she is concerned enough about misbehaviour on the net - such as the Twitter
 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> threats to women - to say:

"It connects us in so many ways which is amazing, but it is also the snake in 
the Garden of Eden which is a huge danger if we don't master it."

She identifies the problem as one of anonymity. When Appleyard points out that 
comments on HuffPo can be anonymous, she counters that her organisation 
moderates comments while Twitter does not (and cannot, of course).

By chance - or maybe by design, given HuffPo's talent for self-promotion - its 
UK editor, Carla Buzasi,has also just given an interview to The Drum.

She talks of Arianna as "an 'amazing' role model" and laments that "women are 
definitely not represented enough in media." She says:

"There aren't many female newspaper editors in this country and that's really 
sad. It is tough, especially now as there are fewer jobs, but if you believe in 
it enough there is no reason why you can't succeed."
