So that’s it for the launch show! Some interesting pairings there, have a good 
feeling about this series. Thank you all for joining in - it’s time for a three 
week break now while the celebs learn to dance, the pros realise what they’ve 
let themselves in for, and I go on holiday. Come and say hello on 
Twitter/Instagram @heidistephens if you’re passing, otherwise I’ll see you on 
Saturday 24th for the first live show! Cheers Hx

And we’re off! Danny is mostly posing, Ore is giving it both barrels, Ed looks 
like the uncle nobody likes at a wedding. Greg and Anastacia are giving it 
plenty of attitude. Tameka looks amazing, and Daisy, Naga and Will look 
promising too. Definitely some rhythm on show out there, which is a good thing.

Right, nearly time for the group dance, which is the first opportunity to see 
who has some moves, and who appears to have put their legs on backwards. I 
can’t WAIT.

So Will is paired with…Karen! Now, this is interesting. Because despite his 
dodgy Pop Idol audition and only managing one term at Ringer College, I suspect 
Will might have some secret moves. And Karen may be just the woman to bring 
them out, provided he ditches that dreadful suit at some point and embraces the 
fake tan and sparkly spandex.

Ed Balls is spectacularly awkward, I’m already clenching. He’s paired 
with…Katya! Katya is Russian, and married to one of this year’s other pros, 
Neil. Ed is Ed Balls, of “Ed Balls” fame. They’ll be gone by Week 2, so let’s 
not dwell on this pairing for too long.

I particularly like the lyric “it leaves you blind, with no vision”. As 
opposed to all the other kinds of blind.

I love how everyone has to squat slightly to talk to Claudia. She’s 
brilliantly tiny.

Ooh time for Olly Murs! I don’t care what any of you think, this song is a 
solid gold summer banger. TURN IT UP AND DANCE.

So that’s it for the launch show! Some interesting pairings there, have a good 
feeling about this series. Thank you all for joining in - it’s time for a three 
week break now while the celebs learn to dance, the pros realise what they’ve 
let themselves in for, and I go on holiday. Come and say hello on 
Twitter/Instagram @heidistephens if you’re passing, otherwise I’ll see you on 
Saturday 24th for the first live show! Cheers Hx
 
And we’re off! Danny is mostly posing, Ore is giving it both barrels, Ed looks 
like the uncle nobody likes at a wedding. Greg and Anastacia are giving it 
plenty of attitude. Tameka looks amazing, and Daisy, Naga and Will look 
promising too. Definitely some rhythm on show out there, which is a good thing.
 
Right, nearly time for the group dance, which is the first opportunity to see 
who has some moves, and who appears to have put their legs on backwards. I 
can’t WAIT.
 
So Will is paired with…Karen! Now, this is interesting. Because despite his 
dodgy Pop Idol audition and only managing one term at Ringer College, I suspect 
Will might have some secret moves. And Karen may be just the woman to bring 
them out, provided he ditches that dreadful suit at some point and embraces the 
fake tan and sparkly spandex.
 
Ed Balls is spectacularly awkward, I’m already clenching. He’s paired 
with…Katya! Katya is Russian, and married to one of this year’s other pros, 
Neil. Ed is Ed Balls, of “Ed Balls” fame. They’ll be gone by Week 2, so let’s 
not dwell on this pairing for too long.
 
Ore is paired with…Joanne! Oh. I wanted him to be paired with somebody less 
annoying. I thought Balls would get Joanne, and I suspect Ore wanted Karen. Pah.

 
Love that Will has confessed up to this WHOLE TERM term at musical theatre 
college. Can you be a ringer on one term?
 
In the interests of full disclosure, I discovered Ore Oduba on the BBC4 
Olympic coverage this summer, and I have QUITE the crush.
