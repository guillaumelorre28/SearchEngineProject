The Huffington Post is to end anonymity for commenters by requiring them to 
use their real identities. The change was announced by the site's founder,
Arianna Huffington <https://www.theguardian.com/media/ariannahuffington>, after 
speaking at a conference yesterday (21 August) in Boston.

She said: "Trolls are just getting more and more aggressive and uglier and I 
just came from London where there are rape and death threats."

Explaining the "need to evolve a platform to meet the needs of the grown-up 
internet," she said: "I feel that freedom of expression is given to people who 
stand up for what they say and not hiding behind anonymity."

HuffPo is reputed to have logged more than 260m comments in the course of its 
existence. It has 40 moderators and also uses algorithms to track comments.

The initiative was confirmed in an email to Poynter by HuffPo spokesperson 
Rhoades Alderson, who said the site's current moderators "will be freed up to 
engage more with the community, facilitating the kinds of productive 
conversations our community members want to be having."

Gigaom's reporter, Barb Darrow, wrote: "Whether or not commenters on blogs and 
news sites should post with their identity — and how that identify is verified 
— is part of a long-running debate."

Indeed it is. Many sites have attempted to enforce the identity of users 
through a registration system based on verification by credit card.
