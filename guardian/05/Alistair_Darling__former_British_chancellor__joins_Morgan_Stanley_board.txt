The 62-year-old has been a prominent member of the campaign backing Britain to 
remain within the EU.

The Morgan Stanley <https://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley> 
chairman, James Gorman, said Darling’s experience at the helm during the 
economic crash would be useful. “I am very pleased to welcome Mr Darling to our 
board. He brings strong leadership experience, as well as insight into both the 
global economy and the global financial system.

“As chancellor of the exchequer he played a central role in responding to the 
financial crisis. The board, our management and our shareholders will greatly 
benefit from his experience and perspective.”

James W Owens, chairman of the board’s nominating and governance committee, 
said: “We will all benefit from his financial, risk management and regulatory 
insights.”

The news comes a day after it was revealed Gordon Brown had taken on a job at 
global investment firm Pimco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/08/gordon-brown-investment-firm-pimco-global-advisory-board>
.

The ex-Labour leader would advise Pimco on economic and political issues, the 
firm said.

The former Labour prime minister announced in 2015 that he was bowing out of 
Westminster politics at the May election and would instead focus on charity 
work and his role as a United Nations envoy.
