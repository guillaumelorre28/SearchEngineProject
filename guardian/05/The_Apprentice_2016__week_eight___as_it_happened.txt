With that in mind, you’d better join me here next week to see what on earth 
they do next. There’s no way Amanda Holden can follow the Dyer WDYTYA so skip 
that, make a strong drink and meet me here just before 9pm.

Byeeeeeee.

Lord! Al is already advertising for contestants for NEXT year. Every year I 
kind of assume that’s it. It must be over now. The experiment to find the 
occupants of the next Golgafrincham B Arc. But no, on it goes.

“I’m just looking forward to seeing my mum,” says Paul in the back of the 
terminal taxi. Spoken like Danny Dyer after he’s just found out he’s NOT 
related to Henry III after all.

Bye Paul, you big unreconstructed misogynist what Al could not afford to be 
associated with and who probably had a balls business plan anyways.

And so to Al’s decision.

He says that Paul is not a potential winner and firs his arse right out of the 
door.

He’s STILL telling both “ladies” to calm themselves down because they live to 
fight another week. Paul is fired, Jess and Fran continue.

 Al accuses Paul of aggression like he doesn’t think that’s a good thing. If 
Paul wasn’t aggressive, he’d tell him he was a pussy. No wonder these 
candidates go mad. There is literally no way for them to win.

Paul was always the one I thought of as like Lord Sugar and that he’d see as a 
kindred spirit. But I’ve gone right off him now. Both women get passionate in 
their own defence and both of them are told to “calm down” by Alan. Sitting on 
my hands here.

Could this be Jessica’s last stand. I find myself suddenly sad to see her on 
the cusp of going. I hope the women realise it’s time to turn on Paul because 
it’s their own means of survival and he’d do the same to them.

Naturally, Paul is coming back with Jessica and... Fran. Wow. That’s got to 
hurt when she thought she’d gained safety by becoming his wing person. I hope 
Fran actually tries to kill him.

This is unexpected. Paul is now getting heat for demoting Jessica. It’s like 
they’ve noticed that he doesn’t really like women and they’re not OK with that. 
Fair play.

Paul’s team learns that the shitty canapés they served actually cost them a 
pile of cash in refunds. Everyone sucks lemons as Fran tries to give Jess some 
props for trying to save the situation.

Paul and team have drained their polystyrene cups and returned to the 
boardroom. Sofiane makes the fair point that his sales went down the toilet the 
minute his punters heard the tickets were going cheaper elsewhere.

Trishna adds weight to the argument that Jess was to blame. Paul agrees with 
her and the knives are fully out for Jess. She might as well be smeared in 
blood and be tethered to a hook dangling over a shark tank.

Trishna brings up Jess’s hot food thing. She has sensed blood and sees Jess’s 
feet stumbling into the quicksand. There’s no way she’s going to support her 
fellow sister now, not wishing to be dragged down with her.

With that in mind, you’d better join me here next week to see what on earth 
they do next. There’s no way Amanda Holden can follow the Dyer WDYTYA so skip 
that, make a strong drink and meet me here just before 9pm.

Byeeeeeee.
 
Lord! Al is already advertising for contestants for NEXT year. Every year I 
kind of assume that’s it. It must be over now. The experiment to find the 
occupants of the next Golgafrincham B Arc. But no, on it goes.
 
“I’m just looking forward to seeing my mum,” says Paul in the back of the 
terminal taxi. Spoken like Danny Dyer after he’s just found out he’s NOT 
related to Henry III after all.

Bye Paul, you big unreconstructed misogynist what Al could not afford to be 
associated with and who probably had a balls business plan anyways.
 
And so to Al’s decision.

He says that Paul is not a potential winner and firs his arse right out of the 
door.

He’s STILL telling both “ladies” to calm themselves down because they live to 
fight another week. Paul is fired, Jess and Fran continue.
 
 Al accuses Paul of aggression like he doesn’t think that’s a good thing. If 
Paul wasn’t aggressive, he’d tell him he was a pussy. No wonder these 
candidates go mad. There is literally no way for them to win.

 
Jessica is finding this really hard to to listen to and tries to turn away 
from the table because she knows crying is not acceptable in a boardroom 
situation.
 
Oh women, with your feelings and your hormones.
 
Paul was always the one I thought of as like Lord Sugar and that he’d see as a 
kindred spirit. But I’ve gone right off him now. Both women get passionate in 
their own defence and both of them are told to “calm down” by Alan. Sitting on 
my hands here.
 
Could this be Jessica’s last stand. I find myself suddenly sad to see her on 
the cusp of going. I hope the women realise it’s time to turn on Paul because 
it’s their own means of survival and he’d do the same to them.
 
Naturally, Paul is coming back with Jessica and... Fran. Wow. That’s got to 
hurt when she thought she’d gained safety by becoming his wing person. I hope 
Fran actually tries to kill him.
 
This is unexpected. Paul is now getting heat for demoting Jessica. It’s like 
they’ve noticed that he doesn’t really like women and they’re not OK with that. 
Fair play.
 
Paul’s team learns that the shitty canapés they served actually cost them a 
pile of cash in refunds. Everyone sucks lemons as Fran tries to give Jess some 
props for trying to save the situation.
 
Paul and team have drained their polystyrene cups and returned to the 
boardroom. Sofiane makes the fair point that his sales went down the toilet the 
minute his punters heard the tickets were going cheaper elsewhere.

Trishna adds weight to the argument that Jess was to blame. Paul agrees with 
her and the knives are fully out for Jess. She might as well be smeared in 
blood and be tethered to a hook dangling over a shark tank.
 
Trishna brings up Jess’s hot food thing. She has sensed blood and sees Jess’s 
feet stumbling into the quicksand. There’s no way she’s going to support her 
fellow sister now, not wishing to be dragged down with her.
