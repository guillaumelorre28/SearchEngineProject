The third and final episode is due to air on BBC1 on Sunday night, but it was 
illegally uploaded to the internet 24 hours before. That prompted a statement 
from the show’s official Twitter account. It said:

 Sherlock producer Sue Vertue said the leak had come from Russia. She tweeted:

The modern-day revival of Sherlock Holmes, starring Benedict Cumberbatch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch> and Martin Freeman, 
has become one of the BBC’s most successful television shows over its four 
seasons. More than 11 million people watched the opening episode on New Year’s 
Day and the Sunday night finale is expected to draw in similar audience numbers.

 The show’s creators, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss – who also plays 
Sherlock’s brother Mycroft – have said this series is not intended to be the 
last and that more adventures for Sherlock are “possible”. However, they 
admitted thatjuggling the schedules

 of Cumberbatch and Freeman was proving difficult.

 Some have criticised Sherlock for becoming too similar to James Bond in its 
fourth series. Speaking at a screening of the final episode, Moffat said: “For 
all those complaints being a bit too James Bondy and actiony ... not till 
tonight.”
