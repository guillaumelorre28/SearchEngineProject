Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

My DIY-mad partner is planning to put foil behind all our radiators in a bid 
to make our heating more efficient. I fear it will look awful, and won’t work. 
There must be better money-saving measures to help cut our heating bill, surely?
