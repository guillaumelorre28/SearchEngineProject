Brenda Blethyn and Kevin Whately start filming a new ITV feature-length drama 
this week about love and betrayal written by veteran screenwriterAlan Plater 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanplater>.

The Web of Belonging has been adapted from the comic novel by Stevie Davies 
and will also star Anna Massey and Peter Sallis. Whately plays a dependable 
husband, Jacob, who suddenly walks out on his wife Jess, leaving her to look 
after his mother, his aunt, played by Massey, and his widowed uncle (Sallis).

Plater, 68, wrote BBC1's award-winning Last of the Blonde Bombshells, starring 
Dame Judi Dench, and began his career on Z Cars in 1962. He has scripted 
Dalziel and Pascoe and Midsomer Murders, but perhaps is best known for 80s 
political drama A Very British Coup, and comedy drama The Beiderbeck Affair, 
which starred James Bolam.

"One day Jacob goes out to the pub and never returns," said a spokeswoman for 
the show. "Slowly and inexorably, Jess's life starts to fall apart. She now has 
to question the entire foundations on which her life has been built... and to 
cope with the younger woman now in Jacob's life.

"It is painful in its honesty yet tenderly funny... spinning its web around 
Jess's world, where we see a woman rebuilding her life around the lives of 
those she cares for - or not."

The one-off drama is being made by independent production company The 
Producers, makers of Sarah Lancashire drama Seeing Red, and The Politician's 
Wife. The Web of Belonging is expected to air on ITV1 in the winter.
