• On 11 May 2010 we amended this article after we received a complaint from 
Emma Forbes that, contrary to what we had been told by a third party, her 
contract came to an end before she leftRadio 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-2>. We apologise to Emma Forbes.

The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> Radio 2 presenter, Emma 
Forbes, has unexpectedly quit the station.

Forbes co-hosted Alan Carr's Saturday evening show 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00k2lq6> on the station.

It is understood her decision followed a disagreement with BBC executives over 
who would present tomorrow's show with Carr.

Forbes was due to take a holiday but is understood to have later asked station 
executives if she could present the show as usual. But stand-in Melanie Sykes 
had already been told she would do the show.

A Radio 2 spokeswoman said: "'Emma Forbes has resigned as the co-host of Radio 
2's Going Out withAlan Carr <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-carr>. We 
wish Emma the best of luck for the future."

Forbes was recruited by Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan in April last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/13/paul-ogrady-alan-carr-emma-forbes>
 as part of a refresh of the weekend schedule.

Forbes is represented by James Grant Group 
<http://www.jg-group.co.uk/index.php>, which declined to comment.
