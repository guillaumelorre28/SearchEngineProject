Irritation is generally considered a minor emotion, less noble than anger, 
less operatic than rage. Over the centuries, it has inspired no great poem, 
speech or drama, though it may have prevented quite a few from seeing the light 
of day. But in Kingsley Amis’sEnding Up 
<http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/ending-up/>, irritation is 
raised to the level of art. Just as his old friendPhilip Larkin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin> thought that “deprivation is 
for me what daffodils were to Wordsworth”, so Amis’s daffodils were irritation. 
He was both irritable and irritating, equally adept at feeling intense 
irritation and dishing it out.

His first wife, Hilly, noticed Kingsley’s remarkable two-way capacity in this 
area soon after they met at Oxford in 1946, when he was just 23 years old. From 
the start, she was aware of his “endless complaints about what seemed to me 
harmless things like apparently ordinary, nice people going through the 
swing-door at Elliston’s restaurant. He’d start muttering, ‘Look at those 
fools; look at that idiot of a man,’ and so on. If doors got stuck, or he was 
held up by some elderly person getting off a bus, or the wind blew his hair all 
over the place, he would snarl and grimace in the most irritating fashion.”

As a young novelist, he seemed to know instinctively how to channel this curse 
into prose. Throughout his oeuvre, irritation plays on the Amis landscape like 
sun on sea. His first novelLucky Jim (1954) bristles with it. Its antihero, Jim 
Dixon, lacks any sort of capacity for brushing things off. “He wished this set 
of dances would end; he was hot, his socks seemed to have been sprayed with 
fine adhesive sand, and his arms ached like those of a boxer keeping his guard 
up after fourteen rounds.” Figures in authority, notably the professor who is 
his boss, are particularly annoying. “Welch’s driving seemed to have improved 
slightly; at any rate, the only death Dixon felt himself threatened by was 
death from exposure to boredom.”

Subsequent Amis novels extend the boundaries of irritation to form something 
approaching an empire. “It was no wonder that people were so horrible when they 
started life as children,” observes the protagonist inOne Fat Englishman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/classics.kingsleyamis>. More 
often than not, Amis’s characters are drawn into a spiral of irritation at 
themselves. “Feeling a tremendous rakehell, and not liking myself for it, and 
feeling rather a good chap for not liking myself much for it, and not liking 
myself at all for feeling rather a good chap,” observes the narrator ofThat 
Uncertain Feeling

But it was not until he was well into middle age that Kingsley Amis decided to 
pluck irritation from the chorus line and place it centre stage. For some time, 
he had been living in the countryside outside London with a slightly ragtag 
group of people: his second wife, the novelistElizabeth Jane Howard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/elizabeth-jane-howard>, known as Jane; her 
brother Colin, known as Monkey; and Monkey’s artist friendSargy Mann 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/21/sargy-mann-blind-painter-tim-adams>
. For three years, they had been joined by Jane’s mother, Katherine “Kit” 
Howard, “an unhappy woman with a sharp tongue, not an easy presence in the 
household for anyone”, in the words of Amis’s biographer.

One day, Jane wondered aloud what would happen “if we all went on living 
together and grew old together”. With these words, she planted the seed for
Ending Up. Interviewed by Clive James <http://www.clivejames.com/kingsley-amis> 
after the novel was published in 1974, Amis said the idea had come from his own 
experience of “relations and people living in … what would this sort of 
arrangement be like if one had a pack of characters who were all about 20 years 
older?” He had imagined “a situation where everybody was old, everybody had got 
to the end of their lives, and everybody had been there for a good long time so 
that all knew how boring one another was, and exactly the areas where one 
another was most vulnerable”.

Before he embarked on writing Ending Up, on 29 January 1973, Amis compiled 
eight pages of notes, kicking off with a list of 45 “ways of being annoying”, 
each of which pops up in the novel. Alongside each different way, he added one 
of five letters, indicating the character who would best personify it: A for 
Perverse shag (Adela), B for Egotist (Marigold), X for Shit (Bernard), Y for 
Fool (Shorty) and Z for Bore (George). Thus:
 X Being deaf – the which? – contemptuous when told 
Z Talking quietly, then v loudly 
Y Repeating the wrong bit 
A Telling people to do what they’ll do anyway & what they know 
A Wrong end of stick through eye of needle 
X Anger at simple questions 
B Whining – I’m old, on scrap-heap 
Y Punning – dud spoonerisms 
Y Polysyllabic facetiousness 
B Lying about what’s happened, whose side was on in argt. 
And so forth. He then wrote suitably merciless short biographies for each of 
the five characters, such as:
 A <Adela> (72). X’s sister. Never married (too ugly, but really too boring or 
annoying). Ex-matron. Runs house … 
and:
 B <Marigold> (74) A’s oldest friend. Widow. Ex-‘actress’. Has children. Hates 
X & Y. Laxative (for Y). Rt wing. Hates homos, lefties … EEC … Makes 
convenience of A, enjoys showing herself superior to her. Upper class. Amnesia 
just starting. 
Alongside X for Bernard (76), who was to become the pivotal character, Amis 
wrote “Old queer but has child. Deaf. Malicious. Amnesiac. Hates everyone. 
Telephone wire for B. Heated wine for Y. Funny. ‘Bad leg’. Dying & knows it. 
Waterpistols cats. India (for laxative). Can’t drink. Small pension. Reads. Not 
enough to do.”

Amis’s method seems to have been to gather 45 ways of being annoying from the 
inhabitants of his own home, and then to redistribute them, in roughly equal 
proportions, among his fictional characters. For instance, he told his official 
biographer, Eric Jacobs, that Jane Howard’s most annoying characteristic was 
primarily conversational: “Amis would ask Jane a question and instead of 
answering she would ask why he’d asked it, as if nothing could be 
straightforward, not even a simple question.” This tic reappears in the 
conversation of Marigold.

Jane used to complain to Amis that the publisher Victor Gollancz could never 
remember who she was, and always mistook her for an actor – a mistake Amis 
could understand, he said, given that she was so “affected”.

Cruel, perhaps, but he was crueller still in his characterisation of Bernard, 
who appears to be an exaggerated and accelerated version of Amis himself. John 
Cleese once remarked that every young comic plays the character he dreads 
becoming. At the age of 50, Amis was far from young, but his portrait 
of Bernard is surely a projection of all his most objectionable tendencies, 
amplified by old age. The only joy Bernard is able to extract from life is 
in making it worse for others: “his only relief, and that a mild, transient 
one, had turned out to lie in malicious schemes, acts and remarks”.

In 1971, Amis said: “If you can’t annoy somebody with what you write, I think 
there’s little point in writing.” His most thorough biographer, Zachary Leader, 
suggests that “the desire to irritate and annoy animated Amis all his life”;
Ending Up represents the most extravagant, unbridled, and, it must be added, 
hilarious animation of this perverse desire.
 What do they think has happened, the old fools, 
To make them like this? Do they somehow suppose 
It’s more grown up when your mouth hangs open and drools, 
And you keep on pissing yourself, and can’t remember 
Who called this morning? 
Philip Larkin finished his poem “The Old Fools” 
<http://plagiarist.com/poetry/4879/> just over a fortnight before Amis began 
writingEnding Up. The two works share an almost rapturous sense of disgust at 
the various afflictions of old age – fear, panic, incontinence, amnesia, 
paralysis.

“One thing the book isn’t going to be is a serious, in-depth etc, study of old 
age,” Amis wrote to an interviewer when he was roughly halfway through. “It’s 
about five particular people who wouldn’t be behaving as they do if they 
weren’t old.”

The finished product is short and brutal, a series of cackling vignettes 
of man’s cruelty to man, all conveyed in Amis’s crisp, beady prose. It is also 
very funny, growing funnier with each fresh misery, mishap and atrocity. The 
blurb on my Penguin edition draws attention to its “humanity”, but it might 
more accurately have highlighted its inhumanity: few novels have ever been 
quite this bleak, quite this nasty. Even the pets at Tuppeny-hapenny Cottage 
become embroiled in the general unpleasantness, in a manner that mirrors their 
masters: “Mr Pastry and Pusscat were locked in their peculiar form of combat, 
one that started as a mixture of fight and game in about equal proportions, 
with an escalating trend in favour of the fight element.”

Amis’s well-loved misanthropy had never been so extreme. When an interviewer 
from the Paris Review suggested it was “very bleak”, he replied: “Yes, well, no 
book is the author’s last word on any subject, or expresses what he feels all 
the time. So if I were to walk under a bus this afternoon, thenEnding Up would 
be my last novel, and people might say, ‘Well, he ended in a fit of pessimism 
and gloom.’ This wouldn’t really be so. Each novel can only represent a single 
mood, a single way of looking at the world, and one feels bleak from time to 
time, and takes a fairly pessimistic view of one’s own future and chances. But 
there are other times when one doesn’t, and out of that other books emerge.”

Yet it is also, to my mind, one of the funniest of his novels, its pessimism 
refined and polished so that it glistens with glee. It is one of his most 
irresistibly inventive, as he employs the verbal tics of each different 
character to create a succession of conversational cartwheels, most notably 
with poor old George, who following a stroke suffers fromnominal aphasia 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomic_aphasia>, and is always groping for the 
right word. “Did you watch, you know, the thing on the switching it on last 
night?” he says. He means television.

On its publication in the US, Ending Up was reviewed glowingly in the New York 
Review of Books by Matthew Hodgart, who suggested its author derived the 
novel’s structure from a baroque suite or classical work in sonata form, 
possibly Mozart’sstring quintet in No 4 in G minor K 516 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vs7YFDHb_c>. Amis’s response was 
characteristically blunt. “Is he mad?” he asked an American friend, adding “… 
as far as I know I’ve never even heard that Mozart quintet. Still, the review 
certainly won’t lose any sales.”

Amis despised artists who gave themselves airs, and made sure he never did it 
himself, much preferring to play the role of the anti-intellectual philistine. 
While writingEnding Up, he took issue with an article Frank Kermode wrote in 
the Daily Telegraph in celebration ofEzra Pound 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview1>
. “Few would deny he had genius,” Kermode had proclaimed. In response, Amis 
wrote a letter to the editor: “No indeed; only it was a genius not for poetry 
(he had not even any particular talent in that direction) but for behaving 
sufficiently like a great poet to gull the gullible.” Ten days later,Pablo 
Picasso <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso> happened to 
die, and Amis’s reaction was much the same. “My dear Philip,” he wrote to 
Larkin on 9 April 1973. “So Pablo the piss-poor paint-pusher has fallen off the 
hooks at last, eh? Ho ho ho. Beckett next?”

Yet, despite its author’s forthright denial, there remains something musical 
aboutEnding Up. It is an elaborate dance of death, the five main characters 
following the manic, fateful steps preordained by their characters, right up to 
the moment when the music stops and they all collapse. But Amis’s mischievous 
delight in language and the extreme brevity of his chapters also give the work 
a jaunty feel, so that the great sombre themes of old age and death are 
transformed into the prose equivalent of a jig.

In one particular way, Ending Up proved eerily prophetic. Ten years later, 
Amis had, by all accounts, turned into an only slightly paler version of 
Bernard Bastable – grumpy, cussed, perversely devoted to causing offence. His 
60th birthday, in 1982, was marked by the Observer newspaper with a dinner in 
his honour at the Garrick Club, attended by no fewer than four editors and five 
columnists. At the meal’s end, the editor delivered a fulsome toast. In reply 
Amis stood up and said, “I just want to make a few remarks. The first thing 
I’ve got to say to you is the Observer is a bloody awful paper.”

Julian Barnes <http:> had long been a friend and admirer of Kingsley, but as 
the years went by, he found the role more difficult: “The price you had to pay 
for his company got higher. Every meeting would involve at least one remark, 
aside, riff at which you thought, well, I’m just not going to rise to that 
...It would be Jews, it would be women, it would be Irish, it would be gays. 
You would think, we’ll let that pass, but increasingly ... it seemed that the 
price to pay was swallowing what you believed about things.”

Another example of life following art, of a prophecy fulfilled, came in Amis’s 
last days, when this most articulate of men lay in a hospital bed, the power 
of language having all but deserted him, now more George Zeyer than Amis. His 
sonMartin <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-amis> writes movingly 
about it in his memoir,Experience 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/05/martinamis>:
 – I feel a bit … you know. 
– What, Dad? 
– You know. 
– Anxious? Uneasy? 
– Not really. Just a bit … you know. 
At one point, Martin asks Kingsley, “Do you remember the book you wrote called 
Ending Up?” and goes on to regale him with the wit and brilliance he applied to 
George’s nominal aphasia.
 – All this, Dad, in the book you wrote. 
He is contemplating me with delighted admiration. 
– Do you remember? 
– No, he said.
