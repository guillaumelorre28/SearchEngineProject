Two pedestrians were killed when a driver crashed into them in Cambridgeshire 
before fleeing the scene on foot.

The men were on a rural road near Yaxley when a BMW car collided with them 
just after 11am on Tuesday.

Police said the driver, a man in his 40s, then fled on foot and has not been 
caught. A police helicopter has joined the hunt.

An air ambulance was called for the two victims, who have not been identified, 
but they were pronounced dead at the scene.
