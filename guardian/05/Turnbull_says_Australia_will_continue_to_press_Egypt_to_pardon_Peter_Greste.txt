Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> 
says his government will continue to press the government of Egypt to pardon 
Australian journalist Peter Greste, and his al-Jazeera colleagues, Mohamed 
Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.


Turnbull paid tribute to Greste’s courage and dedication to truth telling 
during a speech in Canberra on Wednesday honouring war correspondents.

Peter Greste: Egypt's press lost its freedom when my al-Jazeera colleagues and 
I lost ours

“I want Peter … to know that the Australian government continues to support 
you and your colleagues and we will continue to press the government ofEgypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> to pardon you and the other 
journalists with whom you worked,” Turnbull said on Wednesday.

Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed were sentenced to at least three years’ jail

 at a retrial in a Cairo court in August. The three journalists were charged 
with supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood and operating in Egypt without a 
licence.

Greste was deported to Australia by the Egyptian government in February, so 
was tried in absentia. His two colleagues, Fahmy and Mohamed, remain in custody 
in Egypt.

Greste runs the risk of being returned to Cairo to serve the sentence whenever 
he crosses an international border.

Australia’s new prime minister met Greste in Canberra late on Tuesday to be 
briefed about the legal processes in the long running case.

Greste is expected to travel to New York later this week for the United 
Nations general assembly (UNGA). The Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, 
is expected to attend that gathering.

Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is already in New York for the UN 
session.

Bishop expressed dismay after the court’s decision and pledged support from 
the Australian government to clear Greste’s name.

Egypt’s president has previously signalled preparedness to consider pardons in 
the event the al-Jazeera trio were convicted.

Turnbull’s public statement on Wednesday made it clear the new political 
leadership in Australia remains fully supportive of the diplomatic effort to 
secure a pardon for Greste and his colleagues.

The prime minister also used Wednesday’s opportunity to underscore the 
importance of a free press.

“We are one of the oldest democracies in the world. Our democracy depends on 
many men and women, on many institutions, all of them vitally important – but 
none is more important than a free and courageous press,” Turnbull said.

“Our democracy depends not just on the politicians, not just on the judges, it 
depends on our armed services defending our freedoms, but it depends vitally on 
a free press, on a free and courageous press, on free and courageous 
correspondents who are not cowed by governments and big vested interests.”

In various tranches of counter-terrorism legislation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/national-security-laws-strike-at-the-heart-of-press-freedom>
, the previous Abbott government passed laws which impose some of the most 
significant curbs on press freedom in this country since the second world war.

Section 35P of the Asio Act imposes a maximum penalty of five years’ 
imprisonment in cases where a person discloses information relating to a 
special intelligence operation.

Turnbull’s speech on Wednesday morning was at the dedication to a memorial for 
Australian war correpsondents.

“This is a memorial about courage,” he said. “Courage in the face of death, 
courage in the face of physical threat.”

“But it is also a memorial for the men and women who do what is so essential 
to democracy – hold up the truth to power, and at a time when the power is more 
powerful than it ever can be. That [times of war] is when governments are at 
their most powerful, and the pressure they can exert on a free press, greatest.”
