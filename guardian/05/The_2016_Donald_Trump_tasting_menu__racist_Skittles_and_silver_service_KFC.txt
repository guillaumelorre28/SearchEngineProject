Plastic bottle of Diet Coke

Served with french fries, and a reminder that you once tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/257552283850653696?lang=en-gb> “I 
have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke”.

Fish Delight

Your purported favourite item on the McDonald’s menu 
<http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/02/donald-trump-fast-food.html>, even though 
McDonald’s has never sold anything called a Fish Delight.

KFC Bargain Bucket, gravy

To be eaten alone on a private jet, from a cardboard plate, with a silver 
knife and fork 
<http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/02/politics/donald-trump-eats-kfc-knife-fork/>, 
while staring into a camera like a radioactive Chucky doll.

Show the world 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/728297587418247168?lang=en> that 
you love Hispanic people by eating a bracingly inauthentic Mexican dish that 
was brought to you by people who work in the restaurant in the basement of your 
golden skyscraper.

Trump Grill filet mignon

“Overcooked and mealy, with an ugly strain of pure fat running through it … 
slumped to the side over the potatoes like a dead body inside a T-boned 
minivan” –Tina Nguyen, Vanity Fair 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/trump-grill-review>.

Young garlic soup with thyme and sautéed frog legs

To be eaten unironically 
<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/romney-swallows-pride-frogs-legs-at-dinner-with-trump.html>
 after running a campaign largely centred around reaching out to white 
working-class men who have become disillusioned by out-of-touch elitists.

Skittles, bowl

Warning: three of these Skittles will kill you 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37495094>. Please, take a handful.

Tic Tacs

Just in case you start kissing her 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/tic-tac-denounces-trump-229373>. Because 
when you’re a star, they let you do it.

£500 per person

An optional 12.5% service charge will be added to your bill if you also 
require photographic evidence of your dining companion lookinghumiliated and 
sheepish 
<http://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-mitt-romney-dinner-photo-memes-internet-response>
