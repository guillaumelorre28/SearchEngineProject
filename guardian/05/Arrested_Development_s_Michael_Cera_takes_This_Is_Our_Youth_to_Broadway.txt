It is the off-Broadway hit that made Mark Ruffalo a star and brought a string 
of young American actors to the West End, including Matt Damon and Jake 
Gyllenhaal. Eighteen years after its premiere in New York, Kenneth Lonergan's 
This Is Our Youth will have its first run onBroadway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/broadway> this summer in a production by the 
Steppenwolf theatre company.

The cast includes Michael Cera and Kieran Culkin, who appeared together in an 
Australian revival of the play in 2012

 and played flatmates in the 2010 filmScott Pilgrim vs the World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-review>
. It is the first time both have done a stint on Broadway. Their co-star will 
be Tavi Gevinson, the founder ofRookie <http://www.thestylerookie.com/>, a 
website for teenage girls, who recently appeared in the James Gandolfini film 
Enough Said.

Anna D Shapiro will direct the revival of the play, which is set in a New York 
apartment in 1982 and follows three friends as they use a pot of stolen cash to 
finance a drug deal. Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij will compose the music.

Lonergan's play divided critics in the US and in the UK, where it was staged 
with a seemingly endless lineup of starry casts, including three actors 
emerging from the shadow of their more famous siblings: Casey Affleck, Summer 
Phoenix and Kieran Culkin. The New York Times review judged the play to be 
"caustic, cruel, compassionate; a devastating portrait".The Telegraph's Charles 
Spencer 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3577077/Drugs-snogs-a-stellar-cast-and-the-coolest-night-at-the-theatre.html>
 thought it "the best young play of its decade" butMichael Billington concluded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/mar/18/theatre.artsfeatures>: 
"Lonergan's study of subsidised social rebels leaves you wanting more."

This Is Our Youth premieres in Chicago in June at Steppenwolf 
<https://www.steppenwolf.org/> and starts previews at the Cort theatre in New 
York from 18 August. Opening night is 11 September.
