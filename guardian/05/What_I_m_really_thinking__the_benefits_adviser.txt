I’m doing my best for you. The Department for Work and Pensions 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions> 
demands that your claim form for employment and support allowance is returned 
by next Wednesday, or you won’t get any money to pay for food or electricity. 
It’s a difficult form and the department provides no credible help, despite 
many claimants being incapable of completing the forms adequately. Instead, it 
relies on you having access to an experienced volunteer like me.

You have many medical problems, including anxiety and other mental health 
issues. I can tell you’ve been getting increasingly agitated as the session has 
progressed. I’ve apologised and explained that there aren’t any shortcuts for 
filling in this form if you want a reasonable chance of a successful claim. We 
simply have to talk through each question before I draft your response and 
transcribe it.

Eventually you’re unable to answer any more questions. I’m hoping that we’ve 
captured enough. “I’ve been here two hours already!” you complain. We’re both 
tired and I feel like replying, “So have I – and it will take me another 45 
minutes to write up the case”, but I don’t. I haven’t gone through the trauma 
you have.

Confidentiality is crucial, but sometimes I can’t help telling people, in 
general terms, what my clients have gone through. People do sympathise, but 
their reactions are coloured by media reports of benefit fraudsters and 
“slackers”. Such people are the exception, not the rule. People think it must 
be your fault that you’re in this position; it isn’t.
