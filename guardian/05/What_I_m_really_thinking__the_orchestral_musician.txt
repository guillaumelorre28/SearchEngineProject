I have done this for so long, my mind is free to wander while I play. The 
thrill of this being a fresh challenge has long gone: I just want to get to the 
end of the concert and go home. Travelling against commuter traffic is great, 
but it’s also a reminder that most people are on their way to relax and I’m 
only just getting started.

“Oh, but you play music you love, on an instrument you love,” I’m regularly 
told. I don’t: I was forced to learn my instrument by abusive parents who 
thought classical music was posh. Whatever is put in front of me I have to 
play; I have no say in it.

We’re not all friends. The person on my right had an affair with the person on 
my left, and the ex sits close by. We all spend six hours a day together on 
average. Most people around me have had affairs, abuse alcohol or smoke. The 
working conditions are gruelling enough that people develop coping mechanisms. 
It is a hugely toxic environment.

Late nights and out-of-town work mean I often get home after midnight, but I 
sleep only around six hours or I’ll miss the family in the only half-hour we 
have together. I work most weekends and holidays, then have random weekdays 
off. The freelance pay structure and low fees keep my nose glued to the 
grindstone, with almost zero opportunities to develop broader interests or 
a social life outside. People fraternise exclusively according to instrument, 
reinforcing the incestuous lifestyle, especially on tour.

Once in a blue moon, a performance will be extraordinary. But for now, please 
stop clapping. I just want to go home, even if my family will already be asleep 
when I get there.
