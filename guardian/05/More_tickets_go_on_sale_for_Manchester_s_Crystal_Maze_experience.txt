available for the sell outthe Crystal Maze <http://the-crystal-maze.com/>

<http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/crystal-maze-manchester-granada-studios-12213730>
, in Manchester’s former Granada Studios, following the opening in London in 
March this year. In it, teams make their way round a reconstruction of the set 
from the hit Channel 4 gameshow, completing logic puzzles and physical 
challenges in order to collect precious crystals . It prompted much excitement 
from the generation who grew up watching it on television and both venues sold 
out quickly.

Manchester 
This week organisers released a new batch of tickets for the London location 
from May to June 2017, and for Manchester from April to July.

Although the design of the Manchester venue will stay true to the four 
original themed zones of Industrial, Future, Medieval and Aztec, the plan is to 
make each zone grander and “more immersive”: think rope bridges, robots and an 
outdoor Mars-scape. The Manchester venue will also feature different games to 
London (barring Lazers). The opening of the original venue garnered a huge 
amount of attention, andGuardian Travel went along 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/10/game-on-the-crystal-maze-is-back-and-this-time-youre-all-invited>
 to try it out – although we cheated and got disqualified. Tip: when you’re in 
the Crystal Dome, DON’T scoop the foil from the floor.
