The end of a five-hour hearing

That’s the end of this liveblog. To recap: A grueling five-hour hearing 
revealed an unusual antipathy toward the Department of Justice in the usually 
FBI-friendly house of representatives judiciary committee.

Lawmakers didn’t merely accuse the FBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> of undermining cybersecurity. Ranking 
committee member John Conyers attacked bureau director James Comey, saying that 
using the case of the iPhone belonging to the San Bernardino killer Syed Farook 
had undermined the remit of the legislature itself.

“Can you appreciate my frustration with what appears to be little more than an 
end-run around this committee?” asked Congressman Conyers. California 
representative Zoe Lofgren, whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, 
called the quest to provide entry into encryption exclusively for law 
enforcement “a fool’s errand”.

Farook, with his wife Tashfeen Mailk, killed 14 people and wounded 22 in a 
shooting spree on 2 December, after which agents retrieved two destroyed cell 
phones, one useless laptop and Farook’s locked iPhone.Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> has said it will not open the 
phone despite the government’s acquisition of a court order under the 
227-year-old All Writs Act by the Department of Justice attempting to compel 
the company to write a tool that will break its password security measures.

Law-and-order conservatives including committee chairman Jim Sensenbrenner 
told Comey they supported his efforts, some invoking arguments ranging from 
Isis to the nuclear holocaust.

Trey Gowdy told Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell he was unimpressed with the 
company’s contributions to lawmaking and demanded the company draft a bill to 
address what he characterized as a technology problem. “We draft it and then 
your army of government relations folks opposes it, so I’m just trying to save 
us time,” he said. “Why don’t you propose it? Tell us what you could agree to.”

For perhaps the first time, Comey summarized the Department of Justice’s 
argument without the disingenuous claim that the San Bernardino case was 
limited in scope: “It’s not [Apple’s] job to watch out for public safety,” he 
said. “That’s our job.”

Sewell said that the company did want to help with public safety and said the 
company held the rights as a private citizen, among them its first amendment 
right to free speech and thirteenth amendment right to deny forced labor.

The government’s argument in the San Bernardino case “makes my blood boil,” he 
told the committee. “To say that it’s a marketing ploy, to say that it’s about 
PR really diminishes a very serious conversation that should be about security 
of the American people.””

Susan Landau, a security expert who has worked with Google and the National 
Security Agency, offered perhaps the most daring take of the lengthy hearing: 
the FBI needs to get real about technology and start trying harder to break 
encryption. “While the NSA has the right to break into a system, nobody ever 
guaranteed that it would be easy to do so,” she says. “TheFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> needs to take a page from the NSA.”

Landau, answering a question from Congresswoman Lofgren, says that everything 
is connected to the internet and treating it like it isn’t will lead to 
trouble. TheFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> is asking for login 
credentials, she says, which would set an especially dangerous precedent.

“Whether you’re talking about the power grid, the water supply, whatever, 
we’re connected in disastrously insecure ways and the best way to get in is 
login credentials,” says Landau.Encryption 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/encryption>, she said, was a serious 
problem. “What law enforcement is asking for is going to preclude those strong 
solutions.”

“Director Comey said we’ve talked to everyone who’ll talk to us, but I was at 
an event held by the FCC, and some senior people from DOJ were there and I said 
‘Well NSA has skill X and skill Y’ and they said ‘They don’t share them with us 
except in extraordinary circumstances.’”

“Law enforcement don’t have the skills and they need to develop them,” she 
says.

Gowdy on encryption legislation: 'We draft it - and then your army of 
government relations folks opposes it'

One of Sewell’s better rhetorical flourishes is immediately undercut by Gowdy, 
who out-yells committee chairman Sensenbrenner.

“Is it right to make our society overall less safe in order to solve crime?” 
Sewell asks softly; Gowdy immediately leaps in to demand “a fact-pattern” in 
which Gowdy would comply with the order.

Sewell: “Congressman, we will follow the law.”

Gowdy: “I’m asking you for a fact-pattern.”

Sewell: “I don’t, uh –”

Gowdy: “Can you give me a fact pattern where you would agree with what the 
bureau is asking you to do in California, whether it be nuclear weapons or a 
terrorist plot?”


Sewell: “I can’t imagine such a fact pattern.”

Gowdy: “Can you submit legislation, to Chairman Sensenbrenner’s question, that 
you would wholeheartedly support?”

Gowdy goes on to make one of the better points against Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple>, which is that they already have 
quite a bit of influence congressionally and the legislature’s inaction on 
encryption doesn’t exactly have nothing to do with Apple’s interests. “We draft 
it and then your army of government relations folks opposes it, so I’m just 
trying to save us time. Why don’t you propose it? Tell us what you could agree 
to.”

“We’re willing to and we’ve offered to engage in this process,” Sewell says.

Congressman Lofgren, who represents Silicon Valley, is pretty contemptuous of 
Comey. “It’s a fool’s errand,” she says. “We’ll never be able to do what’s 
being asked of us by theFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi>.”

Again, strange bedfellows

 here: Ted Poe (again, a Texan Republican, and also a former judge) reiterates

possibility that Congress might simply tell Apple it can’t have encryption of 
the type it wants. “I actually agree with Mr Nadler; I know that’s going to 
bother him a little bit.”

Apple: code is protected under first amendment

Sewell tells Nadler he believes ordering Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> to unlock the iPhone both 
violates both the first amendment to the US constitution and the thirteenth 
(which abolished slavery in 1865).

“This is a compelled speech by the government for the purposes of the 
government which is absolutely a first amendment problem, and it is speech that 
Apple does not want to make,” he says. “And it is conscription; forced labor.”

Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, chairman of the judiciary committee, yells at 
Sewell for not bringing a bill with him to Congress.

“We have the iPhone of a dead terrorist!” he says. “You’ve come to us to ask 
us to do something, but you don’t know what you want us to do.” He theatrically 
yields his time in disgust, then Sewell tries to answer, then Sensenbrenner 
yells at him and yields his time again. It’s less impressive the second time.

“I assume Apple will have legislative suggestions for us after the court makes 
its decision and Apple likes orApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> doesn’t like it,” Jerrold 
Nadler, a Democrat from New York, says after Sensenbrenner yields for real. He, 
too, isn’t happy with the one-device argument, and lights into Manhattan 
district attorney Cyrus Vance over it.

Vance has said he has 175 iPhones waiting to be unlocked, but the number has 
now risen to 205.

Here’s an interesting exchange highlighting one of the odd contours of the 
debate:there’s been a lot of discussion about cryptography that seems to 
suggest that there’s a difference between “breaking encryption,” whatever that 
means (sharing super-secret prime numbers? Unclear.) and weakening the passcode 
so that it can be brute forced, as Comey describes below, inless than half an 
hour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2016/mar/01/apple-fbi-congressional-hearing-live?page=with:block-56d5f964e4b0d0eebca058ea#block-56d5f964e4b0d0eebca058ea>
.

Conyers gets at this asks by asking Sewell what the functional difference is 
between asking Apple to break its own encryption, and askingApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> to weaken the passcode 
protections.

“Functionally there is no difference,” Sewell says. “What we’re talking about 
is an operating system in which the passcode is an inherent and integrated part 
of the decryption system. That passcode is a cryptographic key.” So that’s your 
cryptography 101 lesson: you participate in encryption on an incredibly 
sophisticated level every time you punch in your passcode.

Back to the hearing: “I was hoping you’d go in that direction,” Conyers 
replies.

Sewell says that it is “absolutely false” that Apple no longer works with law 
enforcement. “The relationship with law enforcement falls within my shop at 
Apple and I’m incredibly proud of the work we do. We have dedicated individuals 
available around the clock.”

“This is not about the San Bernardino case,” Sewell tells Conyers. “This is 
about the safety and security of every iPhone.”


It’s probably safe to stop talking about the “one device” argument, made by 
Josh Earnest, among others, but Sewell kicks it one more time to make sure it’s 
stopped moving permanently: “There’s no distinction between a 5C and a 6 in 
this case. It is extensible, it is common, it is effectively the same.”

Apple's general counsel: ' Hearing that this is a marketing issue makes my 
blood boil'

Goodlatte asks Sewell whether Comey’s assertion that Apple’s position is 
informed by its business model is “a fair contrast”.

“It’s by no means a fair contrast, Mr Chairman,” Sewell tells Goodlatte. He 
says he does not, in fact, agree with the characterization and says that 
hearing this described as a marketing issue “makes my blood boil”.

“I’ve heard this raised before. It was raised in New York, it was raised in 
San Bernardino. This is not a marketing issue, that’s a way of demeaning our 
argument. We don’t take out billboards for our security. We don’t take out ads 
for our encryption. We’re doing this because we think it’s the right thing to 
do. To say that it’s a marketing ploy to to say that it’s about PR really 
diminishes a very serious conversation that should be about security of the 
American people.”

It’s not quite true that Apple doesn’t advertise based on its security, but it 
is true thatApple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> advertises its 
security as being non-annoying, rather than, say, so hard to break that you can 
sell drugs with impunity.

Sewell goes on to cites Orenstein’s decision from yesterday finding Apple 
“conscientious,” and says that in fact Apple is at war toimprove public safety. 
“We see ourselves as being in an arms race with crminals, cyberterrorists and 
hackers,” Sewell said.

Apple's testimony begins

The second panel is finally up. 

Bruce Sewell, general counsel for Apple, reads the statement released yesterday
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/29/apple-lawyer-fbi-bruce-sewell-more-crime>
, telling the committee that he “appreciate[s] your invitation and the 
opportunity to a part of the conversation on this issue.”

Sewell doesn’t say much to put Comey’s mind at ease, given his earlier remarks 
on what Comey sees as Apple’s attempt to usurp the FBI’s remit. “We share their 
goal of creating a safer world,” Sewell says, adding that the company 
cooperates often with law enforcement.

Susan Landau, a former privacy analyst for Google, gives a very interesting 
testimony. Among other observations, she says that “smartphones are 
increasingly wallets” and points out that “NSA will tell you that stealing 
login credentials is the easiest way into a system,” a direct contradiction to 
the FBI’s assertion that what it’s asking is less harmful than to break 
encryption.

Landau also quotes words of wisdom she attributes to a former NSA colleague: 
“While the NSA has the right to break into a system, nobody ever guaranteed 
that it would be easy to do so,” she says. “TheFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> needs to take a page from the NSA.”

FBI concludes argument: 'Public safety is not Apple's job'

Finally, after three hours of condescending to the House of Representatives 
and being sniped at in return,FBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> 
director James Comey is getting around to saying what he actually thinks about 
five minutes before he leaves the panel.

Hakeem Jeffries from Queens presses Comey on whether the Department of 
Justice’s characterization of Apple’s position as driven entirely by marketing 
and PR was as contemptuous as it sounded to Jeffries.

Comey responds that he thinks Apple’s market power “is not an illegitimate 
motive,” but he doesn’t like what they’re selling, because it essentially 
privatizes law enforcement. “It’s not their job to watch out for public 
safety,” he says shortly. “That’s our job.”

Comey also manages to state the opposition’s case very succintly in pushing 
back on a question from Jeffries about breaking into the phone; he also 
identifies where he takes issue with it: “I don’t agree with your framing,” he 
tells Jeffries. “It sounds like you’re saying you either have privacy or you 
have unfettered access and I don’t agree with that.”

Rhode Island democrat David Cicilline asks Comey if encryption law ought to 
come from the legislative branch rather than case law. “Do you agree that the 
authority has to come from Congress?” he asks.

Comey, for perhaps the first time, gives a flat negative. “No, I don’t agree 
with that.”

Comey’s case in a nutshell is that he does not want Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> to destroy its security and that 
the distinction is not a hairsplitting one.

We’re asking Apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock.

Suzan DeIbene tells Comey that the tension is not between privacy and security 
but between security and security, Comey replies, “You’ve said that very well, 
between privacy and security.”


“It’s not a technological problem - it’s a business model problem,” he said.

Cedric Richmond, Democrat from Louisiana’s second district, representing New 
Orleans, is present to discuss the case of a pregnant woman murdered by an 
unknown assailant; investigators have asked for access to her phone but have 
run up against encryption – she is believed to have kept a detailed diary on 
it. Comey has mentioned the case several times.

“We balance public safety and criminal justice; are we in danger of creating 
an underground criminal sanctuary for some very disturbed people?” Richmond 
asks Comey.


“Until this, there was no closet in America, no safe in America, no bank in 
America that could not be entered with a judge’s order. Until we drift to that 
place, we gotta talk about it.”

The case is not one that has been regularly mentioned up to this point; there 
is a case similar to the one described that was reported on in Louisiana last 
year.

FBI could access the San Bernardino phone in 26 minutes - if Apple helped with 
the password

An interesting note from Comey: a brute force attack on the phone would take 
26 minutes, were Apple’s password-entry security measures defeated (again, see
our explainer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/20/apple-fbi-iphone-explainer-san-bernardino>
 for a little more detail on how this works).

And then Comey tells the committee he blames one man for his current 
predicament: Edward Snowden.

“Since Mr. Snowden’s revelations, terrorist tradecraft changed.” Terrorists 
tried to “wrap their lives in encryption,” he says, and as a result, “we’re 
looking for needles in a haystack, and the most important needles turn 
invisible.”


Steve King of Iowa brings up the Isis activity on Twitter, possibly, though 
his syntax is a little hard to decipher. “I’m interested in how the parameters 
that have been examined thoroughly by all the lawyers on this panel might apply 
to Isis, or any of their affiliates or subordinates that might be necessary if 
we’re going to defeat that ideology.”
 Congressman Steve King, seen with Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz 
Photograph: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters 
King’s opinion appears to be that San Bernardino is small potatoes and that 
the American public ought to be more worried about “radical Islam” than even 
the constant discussion of Isis around Farook/Malik murders has made them.

“I think it’s known that Isis or Isil are seeking a nuclear device,” King 
tells Comey. “If that became part of the American consciousness, do you think 
that would change this debate?”

Comey does the thing he’s done so beautifully during the FBI’s messaging to 
the public, which is to plead for reasoned debate while reminding everybody 
that theFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> stands between them and 
anarchy. “I do worry that it’s hard to have nuanced complicated conversations 
like this in the wake of a disaster, which is why I think it’s so important 
that we have this conversation now.”

The director also rejects the contention that the FBI already has the 
technology and just wants precedent. “If we could have done this quietly and 
privately, we would have done it.”

Congressman Gowdy backs the FBI

James Comey has a friend! Trey Gowdy, the mind behind the Benghazi hearings, 
says that “I confess up front that my bias is toward public safety” when it 
comes to the need to balance the various rights conferred by the US 
constitution.

“You just can’t go in these categories [of device] unless somebody consents, 
really?” Gowdy asks, appalled. Comey agrees wholeheartedly with Gowdy’s outrage.

“I love privacy too but I want my fellow citizens to understand that we also 
love our bodies,” Gowdy says.

“If you have a bullet from an officer who was shot in a defendant, you can go 
to a judge and ask the defendant to anesthetize a patient and remove a that 
bullet from the body.” If that’s not unreasonable search and seizure, the South 
Carolina Republican asks, what is?

Gowdy is 100% wrong on this. 

The incident to which he appears to refer is a well-known Supreme Court case 
called Winston v Lee in which it was decided that the use of a previous high 
court decision, Schmerber v California, to mandate surgery to recover bullets 
against the will of a defendantwas unreasonable search and seizure.

“The proposed surgery would violate respondent’s right to be secure in his 
person and the search would be ‘unreasonable’ under the Fourth Amendment,”said 
the court <https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/470/753/case.html>.

Comey no longer seems at ease; when quizzed on the nature of the Fourth 
Amendment (which secures Americans against unreasonable search and seizure) he 
continually says he’s not a constitutional scholar, though he was district 
attorney for the southern district of New York. He then says that he thinks the 
framers of the constitution “wouldn’t have imaginedany box or storage area or 
device that couldn’t be entered <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVScBf8Znw>.”

He’s also clearly getting annoyed with the line of questioning. “People keep 
asking ‘Why didn’t you come to Congress?’” he says. “Well, because we’re in the 
middle of a terrorism investigation. I think the courts will resolve this 
faster than any legislative body could.”


He further takes the opportunity of being criticized for seeking judicial 
redress when he ought to have come to Congress in the opinion of the committee 
to praise the judiciary. “I have a number of friends who are magistrate judges, 
and they’re awesome and they think well and they rule well.”

“The world I imagine is a world in which people comply with warrants,” Comey 
says. “How they do it is up to them.”

Congressman Chaffetz: the FBI already seriously overreaches

We’re back, and the committee has resumed queuing up around Room 2141 of the 
Rayburn House Office Building to spank the director of theFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi>.

Jason Chaffetz of Utah asks Comey when historically the government has been 
able to compel a company to create a product to help it. Comey says he doesn’t 
know but cites one of the cases in the DoJ’s brief, New York Telephone. Comey 
is fairly short with him.

Chaffetz then tells Comey he thinks the FBI already overreaches to a serious 
extent. “We can’t even see the degree to which you’re using Stingrays, or the 
requirements [to use them].” Chaffetz points out that the devices areapparently 
being supplied to the IRS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/stingray-surveillance-technology-irs-cellphone-tower>
 without any congressional oversight. What is the occasion of their use, he 
asks. “Is it articulable suspicion? Is it probable cause?”

“I don’t have a great answer,” Comey responds. “I like the idea of giving as 
much transparency as possible.”

The Guardian has repeatedly attempted to use the Freedom of Information Act to 
acquire records on the use of Stingrays from law enforcement and the documents 
received have without exception been redacted to remove all mention of the 
device.

That’s the end of this liveblog. To recap: A grueling five-hour hearing 
revealed an unusual antipathy toward the Department of Justice in the usually 
FBI-friendly house of representatives judiciary committee.

Lawmakers didn’t merely accuse the FBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> of undermining cybersecurity. Ranking 
committee member John Conyers attacked bureau director James Comey, saying that 
using the case of the iPhone belonging to the San Bernardino killer Syed Farook 
had undermined the remit of the legislature itself.

“Can you appreciate my frustration with what appears to be little more than an 
end-run around this committee?” asked Congressman Conyers. California 
representative Zoe Lofgren, whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, 
called the quest to provide entry into encryption exclusively for law 
enforcement “a fool’s errand”.

Farook, with his wife Tashfeen Mailk, killed 14 people and wounded 22 in a 
shooting spree on 2 December, after which agents retrieved two destroyed cell 
phones, one useless laptop and Farook’s locked iPhone.Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> has said it will not open the 
phone despite the government’s acquisition of a court order under the 
227-year-old All Writs Act by the Department of Justice attempting to compel 
the company to write a tool that will break its password security measures.

Law-and-order conservatives including committee chairman Jim Sensenbrenner 
told Comey they supported his efforts, some invoking arguments ranging from 
Isis to the nuclear holocaust.

Trey Gowdy told Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell he was unimpressed with the 
company’s contributions to lawmaking and demanded the company draft a bill to 
address what he characterized as a technology problem. “We draft it and then 
your army of government relations folks opposes it, so I’m just trying to save 
us time,” he said. “Why don’t you propose it? Tell us what you could agree to.”

For perhaps the first time, Comey summarized the Department of Justice’s 
argument without the disingenuous claim that the San Bernardino case was 
limited in scope: “It’s not [Apple’s] job to watch out for public safety,” he 
said. “That’s our job.”

Sewell said that the company did want to help with public safety and said the 
company held the rights as a private citizen, among them its first amendment 
right to free speech and thirteenth amendment right to deny forced labor.

The government’s argument in the San Bernardino case “makes my blood boil,” he 
told the committee. “To say that it’s a marketing ploy, to say that it’s about 
PR really diminishes a very serious conversation that should be about security 
of the American people.””

Susan Landau, a security expert who has worked with Google and the National 
Security Agency, offered perhaps the most daring take of the lengthy hearing: 
the FBI needs to get real about technology and start trying harder to break 
encryption. “While the NSA has the right to break into a system, nobody ever 
guaranteed that it would be easy to do so,” she says. “TheFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> needs to take a page from the NSA.”

We’ve written a summary of the full hearing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/01/apple-fbi-congress-hearing-iphone-encryption-san-bernardino>
; follow the Guardiantechnology <https://www.theguardian.com/us/technology> 
section and national security editorSpencer Ackerman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/spencerackerman> for more on the 
developing story.
 
Landau, answering a question from Congresswoman Lofgren, says that everything 
is connected to the internet and treating it like it isn’t will lead to 
trouble. TheFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> is asking for login 
credentials, she says, which would set an especially dangerous precedent.

“Whether you’re talking about the power grid, the water supply, whatever, 
we’re connected in disastrously insecure ways and the best way to get in is 
login credentials,” says Landau.Encryption 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/encryption>, she said, was a serious 
problem. “What law enforcement is asking for is going to preclude those strong 
solutions.”

“Director Comey said we’ve talked to everyone who’ll talk to us, but I was at 
an event held by the FCC, and some senior people from DOJ were there and I said 
‘Well NSA has skill X and skill Y’ and they said ‘They don’t share them with us 
except in extraordinary circumstances.’”

“Law enforcement don’t have the skills and they need to develop them,” she 
says.
 
One of Sewell’s better rhetorical flourishes is immediately undercut by Gowdy, 
who out-yells committee chairman Sensenbrenner.

“Is it right to make our society overall less safe in order to solve crime?” 
Sewell asks softly; Gowdy immediately leaps in to demand “a fact-pattern” in 
which Gowdy would comply with the order.

Sewell: “Congressman, we will follow the law.”

Gowdy: “I’m asking you for a fact-pattern.”

Sewell: “I don’t, uh –”

Gowdy: “Can you give me a fact pattern where you would agree with what the 
bureau is asking you to do in California, whether it be nuclear weapons or a 
terrorist plot?”


Sewell: “I can’t imagine such a fact pattern.”

Gowdy: “Can you submit legislation, to Chairman Sensenbrenner’s question, that 
you would wholeheartedly support?”

Gowdy goes on to make one of the better points against Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple>, which is that they already have 
quite a bit of influence congressionally and the legislature’s inaction on 
encryption doesn’t exactly have nothing to do with Apple’s interests. “We draft 
it and then your army of government relations folks opposes it, so I’m just 
trying to save us time. Why don’t you propose it? Tell us what you could agree 
to.”

“We’re willing to and we’ve offered to engage in this process,” Sewell says.
 
Congressman Lofgren, who represents Silicon Valley, is pretty contemptuous of 
Comey. “It’s a fool’s errand,” she says. “We’ll never be able to do what’s 
being asked of us by theFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi>.”

Again, strange bedfellows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/29/apple-fbi-encryption-battle-supporters-technology-politics>
 here: Ted Poe (again, a Texan Republican, and also a former judge) reiterates 
New York Democrat Jerrod Nadler’s point earlier that there’s a distinct 
possibility that Congress might simply tell Apple it can’t have encryption of 
the type it wants. “I actually agree with Mr Nadler; I know that’s going to 
bother him a little bit.”
 
Sewell tells Nadler he believes ordering Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> to unlock the iPhone both 
violates both the first amendment to the US constitution and the thirteenth 
(which abolished slavery in 1865).

“This is a compelled speech by the government for the purposes of the 
government which is absolutely a first amendment problem, and it is speech that 
Apple does not want to make,” he says. “And it is conscription; forced labor.”

Committee, seated next to encryption expert professor Susan Landau Photograph:

Darrell Issa makes a more utilitarian argument, echoing the point former FBI 
counterterrorism agent Mike German madeearlier in this blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2016/mar/01/apple-fbi-congressional-hearing-live?page=with:block-56d5e2d8e4b0d0eebca058af#block-56d5e2d8e4b0d0eebca058af>
. “Have you ever ordered a shredding company to put paper back together?” he 
asks Vance.

Vance has to concede. “Of course I haven’t.”
 
Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, chairman of the judiciary committee, yells at 
Sewell for not bringing a bill with him to Congress.

“We have the iPhone of a dead terrorist!” he says. “You’ve come to us to ask 
us to do something, but you don’t know what you want us to do.” He theatrically 
yields his time in disgust, then Sewell tries to answer, then Sensenbrenner 
yells at him and yields his time again. It’s less impressive the second time.

“I assume Apple will have legislative suggestions for us after the court makes 
its decision and Apple likes orApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> doesn’t like it,” Jerrold 
Nadler, a Democrat from New York, says after Sensenbrenner yields for real. He, 
too, isn’t happy with the one-device argument, and lights into Manhattan 
district attorney Cyrus Vance over it.

Vance has said he has 175 iPhones waiting to be unlocked, but the number has 
now risen to 205.

York, not California, as previously stated
 
Here’s an interesting exchange highlighting one of the odd contours of the 
debate:there’s been a lot of discussion about cryptography that seems to 
suggest that there’s a difference between “breaking encryption,” whatever that 
means (sharing super-secret prime numbers? Unclear.) and weakening the passcode 
so that it can be brute forced, as Comey describes below, inless than half an 
hour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2016/mar/01/apple-fbi-congressional-hearing-live?page=with:block-56d5f964e4b0d0eebca058ea#block-56d5f964e4b0d0eebca058ea>
.

Conyers gets at this asks by asking Sewell what the functional difference is 
between asking Apple to break its own encryption, and askingApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> to weaken the passcode 
protections.

“Functionally there is no difference,” Sewell says. “What we’re talking about 
is an operating system in which the passcode is an inherent and integrated part 
of the decryption system. That passcode is a cryptographic key.” So that’s your 
cryptography 101 lesson: you participate in encryption on an incredibly 
sophisticated level every time you punch in your passcode.

Back to the hearing: “I was hoping you’d go in that direction,” Conyers 
replies.

Sewell says that it is “absolutely false” that Apple no longer works with law 
enforcement. “The relationship with law enforcement falls within my shop at 
Apple and I’m incredibly proud of the work we do. We have dedicated individuals 
available around the clock.”

“This is not about the San Bernardino case,” Sewell tells Conyers. “This is 
about the safety and security of every iPhone.”


It’s probably safe to stop talking about the “one device” argument, made by 
Josh Earnest, among others, but Sewell kicks it one more time to make sure it’s 
stopped moving permanently: “There’s no distinction between a 5C and a 6 in 
this case. It is extensible, it is common, it is effectively the same.”
 
Goodlatte asks Sewell whether Comey’s assertion that Apple’s position is 
informed by its business model is “a fair contrast”.

“It’s by no means a fair contrast, Mr Chairman,” Sewell tells Goodlatte. He 
says he does not, in fact, agree with the characterization and says that 
hearing this described as a marketing issue “makes my blood boil”.

“I’ve heard this raised before. It was raised in New York, it was raised in 
San Bernardino. This is not a marketing issue, that’s a way of demeaning our 
argument. We don’t take out billboards for our security. We don’t take out ads 
for our encryption. We’re doing this because we think it’s the right thing to 
do. To say that it’s a marketing ploy to to say that it’s about PR really 
diminishes a very serious conversation that should be about security of the 
American people.”

It’s not quite true that Apple doesn’t advertise based on its security, but it 
is true thatApple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> advertises its 
security as being non-annoying, rather than, say, so hard to break that you can 
sell drugs with impunity.

Sewell goes on to cites Orenstein’s decision from yesterday finding Apple 
“conscientious,” and says that in fact Apple is at war toimprove public safety. 
“We see ourselves as being in an arms race with crminals, cyberterrorists and 
hackers,” Sewell said.
 
The second panel is finally up. 

Bruce Sewell, general counsel for Apple, reads the statement released yesterday
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/29/apple-lawyer-fbi-bruce-sewell-more-crime>
, telling the committee that he “appreciate[s] your invitation and the 
opportunity to a part of the conversation on this issue.”

Sewell doesn’t say much to put Comey’s mind at ease, given his earlier remarks 
on what Comey sees as Apple’s attempt to usurp the FBI’s remit. “We share their 
goal of creating a safer world,” Sewell says, adding that the company 
cooperates often with law enforcement.

Susan Landau, a former privacy analyst for Google, gives a very interesting 
testimony. Among other observations, she says that “smartphones are 
increasingly wallets” and points out that “NSA will tell you that stealing 
login credentials is the easiest way into a system,” a direct contradiction to 
the FBI’s assertion that what it’s asking is less harmful than to break 
encryption.

Landau also quotes words of wisdom she attributes to a former NSA colleague: 
“While the NSA has the right to break into a system, nobody ever guaranteed 
that it would be easy to do so,” she says. “TheFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> needs to take a page from the NSA.”
 
Finally, after three hours of condescending to the House of Representatives 
and being sniped at in return,FBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> 
director James Comey is getting around to saying what he actually thinks about 
five minutes before he leaves the panel.

Hakeem Jeffries from Queens presses Comey on whether the Department of 
Justice’s characterization of Apple’s position as driven entirely by marketing 
and PR was as contemptuous as it sounded to Jeffries.

Comey responds that he thinks Apple’s market power “is not an illegitimate 
motive,” but he doesn’t like what they’re selling, because it essentially 
privatizes law enforcement. “It’s not their job to watch out for public 
safety,” he says shortly. “That’s our job.”

Comey also manages to state the opposition’s case very succintly in pushing 
back on a question from Jeffries about breaking into the phone; he also 
identifies where he takes issue with it: “I don’t agree with your framing,” he 
tells Jeffries. “It sounds like you’re saying you either have privacy or you 
have unfettered access and I don’t agree with that.”

Trans-Pacific Partnership in October 2015 Photograph: J. Scott Applewhite/AP 
Rhode Island democrat David Cicilline asks Comey if encryption law ought to 
come from the legislative branch rather than case law. “Do you agree that the 
authority has to come from Congress?” he asks.

Comey, for perhaps the first time, gives a flat negative. “No, I don’t agree 
with that.”
 
Comey’s case in a nutshell is that he does not want Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> to destroy its security and that 
the distinction is not a hairsplitting one.

We’re asking Apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock.

Suzan DeIbene tells Comey that the tension is not between privacy and security 
but between security and security, Comey replies, “You’ve said that very well, 
between privacy and security.”


“It’s not a technological problem - it’s a business model problem,” he said.
 
Cedric Richmond, Democrat from Louisiana’s second district, representing New 
Orleans, is present to discuss the case of a pregnant woman murdered by an 
unknown assailant; investigators have asked for access to her phone but have 
run up against encryption – she is believed to have kept a detailed diary on 
it. Comey has mentioned the case several times.

“We balance public safety and criminal justice; are we in danger of creating 
an underground criminal sanctuary for some very disturbed people?” Richmond 
asks Comey.


“Until this, there was no closet in America, no safe in America, no bank in 
America that could not be entered with a judge’s order. Until we drift to that 
place, we gotta talk about it.”

The case is not one that has been regularly mentioned up to this point; there 
is a case similar to the one described that was reported on in Louisiana last 
year.
 
FBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> director James Comey:

“They’ve set out to make a phone that they can’t get into and they’re darn 
near succeeding. I think with the 6 and beyond, they would have succeeded. That 
doesn’t make them bad people.”
 
An interesting note from Comey: a brute force attack on the phone would take 
26 minutes, were Apple’s password-entry security measures defeated (again, see
our explainer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/20/apple-fbi-iphone-explainer-san-bernardino>
 for a little more detail on how this works).

And then Comey tells the committee he blames one man for his current 
predicament: Edward Snowden.

“Since Mr. Snowden’s revelations, terrorist tradecraft changed.” Terrorists 
tried to “wrap their lives in encryption,” he says, and as a result, “we’re 
looking for needles in a haystack, and the most important needles turn 
invisible.”


Steve King of Iowa brings up the Isis activity on Twitter, possibly, though 
his syntax is a little hard to decipher. “I’m interested in how the parameters 
that have been examined thoroughly by all the lawyers on this panel might apply 
to Isis, or any of their affiliates or subordinates that might be necessary if 
we’re going to defeat that ideology.”
 Congressman Steve King, seen with Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz 
Photograph: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters 
King’s opinion appears to be that San Bernardino is small potatoes and that 
the American public ought to be more worried about “radical Islam” than even 
the constant discussion of Isis around Farook/Malik murders has made them.

“I think it’s known that Isis or Isil are seeking a nuclear device,” King 
tells Comey. “If that became part of the American consciousness, do you think 
that would change this debate?”

Comey does the thing he’s done so beautifully during the FBI’s messaging to 
the public, which is to plead for reasoned debate while reminding everybody 
that theFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> stands between them and 
anarchy. “I do worry that it’s hard to have nuanced complicated conversations 
like this in the wake of a disaster, which is why I think it’s so important 
that we have this conversation now.”

The director also rejects the contention that the FBI already has the 
technology and just wants precedent. “If we could have done this quietly and 
privately, we would have done it.”
 
James Comey has a friend! Trey Gowdy, the mind behind the Benghazi hearings, 
says that “I confess up front that my bias is toward public safety” when it 
comes to the need to balance the various rights conferred by the US 
constitution.

“You just can’t go in these categories [of device] unless somebody consents, 
really?” Gowdy asks, appalled. Comey agrees wholeheartedly with Gowdy’s outrage.

“I love privacy too but I want my fellow citizens to understand that we also 
love our bodies,” Gowdy says.
 Congressman Trey Gowdy Photograph: Corbis & Getty Images 
“If you have a bullet from an officer who was shot in a defendant, you can go 
to a judge and ask the defendant to anesthetize a patient and remove a that 
bullet from the body.” If that’s not unreasonable search and seizure, the South 
Carolina Republican asks, what is?

Gowdy is 100% wrong on this. 

The incident to which he appears to refer is a well-known Supreme Court case 
called Winston v Lee in which it was decided that the use of a previous high 
court decision, Schmerber v California, to mandate surgery to recover bullets 
against the will of a defendantwas unreasonable search and seizure.

“The proposed surgery would violate respondent’s right to be secure in his 
person and the search would be ‘unreasonable’ under the Fourth Amendment,”said 
the court <https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/470/753/case.html>.
 
Comey no longer seems at ease; when quizzed on the nature of the Fourth 
Amendment (which secures Americans against unreasonable search and seizure) he 
continually says he’s not a constitutional scholar, though he was district 
attorney for the southern district of New York. He then says that he thinks the 
framers of the constitution “wouldn’t have imaginedany box or storage area or 
device that couldn’t be entered <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVScBf8Znw>.”

He’s also clearly getting annoyed with the line of questioning. “People keep 
asking ‘Why didn’t you come to Congress?’” he says. “Well, because we’re in the 
middle of a terrorism investigation. I think the courts will resolve this 
faster than any legislative body could.”


He further takes the opportunity of being criticized for seeking judicial 
redress when he ought to have come to Congress in the opinion of the committee 
to praise the judiciary. “I have a number of friends who are magistrate judges, 
and they’re awesome and they think well and they rule well.”

“The world I imagine is a world in which people comply with warrants,” Comey 
says. “How they do it is up to them.”
 
We’re back, and the committee has resumed queuing up around Room 2141 of the 
Rayburn House Office Building to spank the director of theFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi>.

Jason Chaffetz of Utah asks Comey when historically the government has been 
able to compel a company to create a product to help it. Comey says he doesn’t 
know but cites one of the cases in the DoJ’s brief, New York Telephone. Comey 
is fairly short with him.
 Congressman Jason Chaffetz Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP 
Chaffetz then tells Comey he thinks the FBI already overreaches to a serious 
extent. “We can’t even see the degree to which you’re using Stingrays, or the 
requirements [to use them].” Chaffetz points out that the devices areapparently 
being supplied to the IRS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/stingray-surveillance-technology-irs-cellphone-tower>
 without any congressional oversight. What is the occasion of their use, he 
asks. “Is it articulable suspicion? Is it probable cause?”

“I don’t have a great answer,” Comey responds. “I like the idea of giving as 
much transparency as possible.”

The Guardian has repeatedly attempted to use the Freedom of Information Act to 
acquire records on the use of Stingrays from law enforcement and the documents 
received have without exception been redacted to remove all mention of the 
device.
