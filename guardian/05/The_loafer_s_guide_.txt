Southern boys, then? 
 Well, they are a southern band, but in the south-of-the-Thames rather than 
the Lynryd Skynryd sense. The title of their first album, 1997's Exile on 
Coldharbour Lane, offers a clue to their neighbourhood.
But they are a trio? 
 Not exactly. An informal core of six or seven band members - led by Larry 
Love, harmonica player The Mountain of Love, and The Very Reverend Dr D Wayne 
Love, First Minister of the First Presleyterian Church of Elvis the Divine - is 
often supplemented by up to 20 people, including DJs and dancers.

He's not really a reverend, is he?
 I don't think he's a doctor, either.

Come on, get to the point.
 OK. So, although they were a bunch of self-confessed 'lowlife no-hopers going 
nowhere' from Brixton's anarchic sound-system scene, their album contained the 
bluesy 'Woke Up This Morning', which TV producer David Chase heard on the radio 
and decided he'd use as the title music for his new project - something called 
The Sopranos. In no time, The Sopranos was the hottest show on television, the 
nation found itself singing the lyric, 'You woke up this morning/Got yourself a 
gun' andAlabama 3 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alabama-3> was being 
introduced on stage by the Soprano mob boss himself, James Gandolfini.

Wow. So where does Alabama 3 stand on the law-and-order issue?
 Let's just say that some of them are not unfamiliar with the interior of a 
police cell. Song titles such as 'Hypo Full of Love' are a bit of a giveaway. 
They're also chummy with Hell's Angels, have played a gig in Brixton prison and 
are ardent supporters of Mojo.

What, the po-faced rock mag? 
 No, Birmingham Six member Paddy Hill's Miscarriages of Justice Organisation. 

Whatever would Carmela say?
 Ay! Enough already

 'Woke Up This Morning' is released tomorrow
