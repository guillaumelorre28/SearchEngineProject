Chelsea will be without Eden Hazard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eden-hazard> for tonight’s game at 
Sunderland after the forward was omitted from the Premier League leaders’ squad.

Hazard is understood to have suffered a knock in Sunday’s narrow victory over 
West Bromwich Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/11/chelsea-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report>
, in which he was replaced late on by Branislav Ivanovic.

His absence represents a blow for Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, who are seeking to secure a 
10th successive league victory at the Stadium of Light to establish a six-point 
advantage at the top of the table. Hazard has been in resurgent form, operating 
from a free role on the left of an attacking trio.

Antonio Conte is conscious of the cluttered nature of the festive fixture 
programme and, having intimated some players were carrying knocks from the 
weekend, was anxious not to take any risks with his players before five matches 
in 22 days. He will hope Hazard will be fit for Saturday’s trip to Crystal 
Palace.
