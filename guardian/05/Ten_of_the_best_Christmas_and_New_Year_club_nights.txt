1 Rinse FM Boxing Day

If eggnog bloat and casual racism from the in-laws has you itching to draw a 
line under Christmas, demolish yuletide here with the help of sub bass. Grime 
stars Novelist and Abra Cadabra appear alongside a host of celebrated selectors 
(Zinc, Geeneus, Oneman, Loefah) and the Boxed crew.

2 Shine Boxing Night 

Belfast boys Bicep risk frowns from their grandparents by dashing off to host 
a night of deep techno and disco-fringed house. Fabric resident Craig Richards 
winds up his enforced sabbatical from the club alongside Clouds, nd_baumecker 
and more.

3 La Cheetah NYE 2016

Spending midnight amid the unremitting thud of bass drums isn’t always the 
best omen for a new year; so why not spin around to disco edits provided by 
Rahaan and Sassy J instead?

highlight.

5 The Art School NYE

If 2016 made you contemplate life on an off-world colony, Jon Hopkins and 
Nathan Fake’s cosmic techno will attempt to propel you there. But Glaswegians 
are reminded that it’s also the last ever night at Paisley rave institution The 
Club.

6 Wigflex NYE Cage Party

The stage for this Midlands bash is inside a caged wrestling ring, and while 
the perma-hunched Ben UFO, Pearson Sound, Pangaea and Call Super probably 
wouldn’t last five seconds in an actual match, they’ll go for 10 rounds of 
killer futurist techno here. The former three also play WHP’s New Year’s Day 
closing party in Manchester.

7 RAM NYE

The drum’n’bass label celebrates 25 years, admittedly without co-founder Andy 
C, but with nearly every other heavy-yet-poppy producer in the game, topped by 
Sub Focus and Nero.

For lovers of smart but big-hearted 4/4, this is London’s best NYE option,

9 Canal Mills Presents

For a blast of pure positive energy, pop-house don MK is hard to beat, plus 
there’s melodic techno from Modeselektor and The Black Madonna the next day.
