It is a humid morning. Steamy and misty on the mountain. For a few weeks now 
the elderflower has been out, proudly flashing its white bunched flowers as I 
pass by on country roads. Its been taunting me from the yards of older houses 
in town and even my very own back yard. Through the toilet window I've been 
monitoring the progress, from fresh green buds to full-formed clusters of 
clean, white flowers. For a few seasons now I've been brewing up these blooms 
into the most refreshing cordial I've ever had. Mixed with some spirits it can 
make a summer afternoon rather cheeky. But before I can enjoy an afternoon of 
drinking elderflower I first have to get out there and make it.

I grab my old canvas fruit picker’s bag from the larder, one of my most used 
tools over the spring to autumn period. With the tough leather straps over my 
shoulders I start the trek to the closest trees, sitting at the edge of the 
neighbouring paddocks. Rabbits scurry in front of me, darting into the safety 
of the long weedy grass that covers the verge. Soon my jeans are soaking from 
last night’s rain, which clings to the vegetation – just one of the discomforts 
of foraging for these flowers along with the blackberry and thistle that seem 
almost a test for the picker. You can almost hear nature sassing you: "How much 
do you really want it?"

On the first tree I reach the flower heads are small but they look plump and 
full. Elderflower has unique aromatics and when I start the very first picking 
session the smell reminds me of drinking the cordial the previous summer. A 
pleasure to enjoy when it returns each year.

I stretch and climb to reach every last cluster of flowers. I'm not the 
tallest bloke and didn't drag a ladder with me, so the top half of the tree 
remains laden with flowers, enough for nature to continue doing its job. I 
continue along the track picking from trees and filling my bag until its 
bulging: time to return to the farm house and dump a load of flowers in the 
stewing pot.

With one load done I head in the opposite direction, up the hill where the 
views become spectacular. Rolling green hills meander for miles. To the west 
sits a huge wind farm, large propellers spinning in the wind making clean 
energy. It’s not a pretty sight, but it’s reassuring, giving hope for our 
future. I think too that what I'm doing, harvesting a weed, is part of our 
future. The concept of gathering food from around me seems to make sense.

And elder trees are considered a weed in Australia. The seeds are spread 
easily by the forces of nature, birds and wind, and once introduced to the area 
tends to make itself at home; a real pest. And given that it will never be 
contained or controlled, why not drink it?

I spot a series of trees along a deserted roadside. I pick one flower head 
after another, my bag filling like an air balloon. It’s a sweet chore this 
flower picking: the birds around me making cheerful noises as I go about my 
work, insects buzzing about me and a cool breeze that has worked its way up the 
hill creating a gentle rustle in the trees.

 A refreshing drink for hot afternoons: serve your Elderflower cordial with 
ice, mint – and perhaps a shot of booze. Photograph: /Rohan Anderson 
At home I work on the brew. The cordial uses the simple technique of steeping 
– basically the flower heads soak in water like a huge cup of tea. I add a bag 
of lemons, citric acid and the all important sugar, dissoIved in warm water, 
and stir in my large cauldron like I was one of the three witches. The brew 
sits overnight, or for a few days if you get lazy, with the elderflowers’ 
unique flavour infusing into the sugar syrup.

Each year the end product is different; this year the batch has a strong lemon 
kick which I’m looking forward to drinking on a hot summer’s day with plenty of 
ice, water and fresh mint. At the end of this food project I have made 32 
bottles of cordial. Enough to last to the end of summer. And there will 
doubtless be many afternoons after a day pottering in my food bowl when I 
decided its time to down tools and break for the day. I'll sip that cordial, 
look up at the hill where I picked it and say cheers to the weed that’s made my 
drink.
