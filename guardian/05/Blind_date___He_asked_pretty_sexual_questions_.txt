Patrick on Giuseppe 

What were you hoping for?
Great conversation, a hilarious story to tell, and a hangover the next day.

First impressions?
Definitely lives in Hackney, charming and easy on the eye.

What did you talk about?
Drag queens, Grindr <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/grindr>, and our 
shared love of negronis.

Any awkward moments?
When he kissed me in front of a very old couple who were staring at us.

Good table manners?
Neither of us has. You should have seen the state of the tablecloth when we 
left.

Best thing about Giuseppe?
His spare ticket to see Four Tet <http://www.fourtet.net/> the next day.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
If I had any…

Describe Giuseppe in three words?
Affectionate, sarcastic, seductive.

What do you think he made of you?
Annoying, flirtatious, and hopefully funny.

Did you go on somewhere?
We stayed at the restaurant quite late, and had plenty of wine and espresso 
martinis.

And… did you kiss?
We sure did.

If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?
That the hot waiter joined us.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
In his dreams. Just kidding, Giuseppe!

He seems nice and he’s almost as blond as me.

He asked pretty sexual questions, but I found it funny.

Good table manners?
Yeah, good with tagliatelle.
