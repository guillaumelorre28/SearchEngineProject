The biggest new children’s TV genre of recent years isn’t on broadcast 
television. It’s people posting videos on YouTube of themselves playing video 
gameMinecraft and racking up billions of views from children around the world. 
One of those stars is Joseph Garrett, whose YouTube persona is a cat named 
Stampy.His channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/stampylonghead> has 7.8 
million subscribers and its videos have been viewed 5.3bn times, making him one 
of the most popular British YouTube stars. Others include Dan Middleton, whose 
Minecraft-focusedthe Diamond Minecart 
<https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDiamondMinecart> channel has 12.2 million 
subscribers and 8bn views. YouTube’s biggest star so far is also a gamer, 
Brighton-based SwedeFelix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg 
<https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie?gl=GB&hl=en-GB>. His videos are not 
aimed at children, but he has an audience of 47.5 million YouTube subscribers 
and 13.2bn views. The popularity of their channels may baffle many parents, but 
to children these online creators are as influential as pop stars.

Still only in his mid-20s, Joseph Garrett has also developed a show called 
Wonder Quest <https://www.youtube.com/user/Wonderquest> with Disney-owned Maker 
Studios. It aims to teach science and maths to children usingMinecraft and 
after 60m views of its first series has just returned for a second season.

How would you describe Wonder Quest to parents who haven’t seen the first 
series?
It’s not so different to a Saturday morning cartoon really. The characters are 
in a game calledMinecraft, so they look blocky, but the way it’s filmed, edited 
and presented isn’t that dissimilar to a cartoon.

But because it is filmed in a game rather than acted or animated, we are 
controlling the characters. There’s an opportunity to improvise. Although we 
have a script, if we suddenly do something different or add a line, we can keep 
it in.

Season 2 is grander and more epic, but it’s also funnier. While it’s a show 
with education in, the priority is the entertainment. If it’s not entertaining, 
no one’s ever going to be able to enjoy it.

How do you introduce science and maths concepts into the show without them 
seeming to be crowbarred in?
We always try to have it heavily embedded in the plot and relevant to what the 
characters are going through. We don’t try to force that side of the show.

It’s funny, because from talking to people, I think a lot of them don’t really 
look at it as an “educational” show. When I see comments or people messaging me 
looking forward to the next episode, they’re enjoying it as a show. It’s 
reaching a wide age range, which can make it hard to get the balance right to 
appeal to everyone. I don’t want to come across as too babyish or patronising. 
I just imagine I’m speaking to a friend.

Is there something specific about Minecraft that makes it a good backdrop for 
education and science?
I feel that Minecraft is a very good platform for so many different things: to 
tell stories, to teach, to do whatever you want to do. The great value is that 
so many children like it. Well, so many people from all different ages and 
parts of the world; there’s no age or gender bias.

For children and education, the fact that they love Minecraft is almost enough 
to get their attention already. If you’re a teacher in a classroom talking about
Minecraft, right out of the gate your class might be paying more attention than 
if you were just writing on a whiteboard.

It’s a very natural way to teach and tell stories. When people think of games, 
it’s something you play from beginning to end with one story.Minecraft is more 
a plaything like plasticine or Lego. There’s so much depth to it and what you 
can do within it.

Other YouTube <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube> stars make 
guest appearances inWonder Quest and you regularly make videos with friends. Is 
collaboration an important part of being a YouTuber?
With Wonder Quest, it’s another way for people to get excited about the show. 
People might have ideas about YouTubers being rivals, but the reality is we are 
people who understand what it’s like to be YouTubers. A lot of us are friends, 
happy to help each other out.

There aren’t many people who understand what it’s like to be a YouTuber, 
especially a gaming YouTuber, which is a community within YouTube. We all know 
each other from events or just from talking, so there is that sense of 
community. It’s nice to have a group of people to collaborate with or you can 
feel a little bit isolated.

How does the fact that you have an audience of children affect your videos and 
how you behave online?
It’s something I’m always actively thinking about when I’m making videos. It 
was the motivation behindWonder Quest: I realised I had this audience of 
children, so let’s do something good with that.

That even goes beyond the videos to real life and what I’m tweeting about on 
social media. I’ve become this Stampy character, which is still the real me, 
but it’s almost like the perfect version of me, or the cartoon version.

I make sure that in every situation I’m acting in a way that I would hope 
other people would act. If I get really angry about something, I’m not going to 
tweet about it and if I play a mini-game and end up losing, I’m going to say 
congratulations and be gracious about it. People think if you don’t swear in 
videos you’re child-friendly, but there’s a lot more to it than that.

As your audience grows up, what are your ambitions? How will you keep them 
interested?
In my life in general I don’t know what I’m going to be doing in five months’ 
time, let alone longer term. I’m happy with the videos I’ve been doing recently 
though.

A big thing for me has been almost stepping away from falling into a template: 
the mindset of “these are the videos I need to make this week on YouTube”. I’ve 
learned to not worry so much about particular formats and instead experiment a 
bit more.

There’s a mindset on YouTube to plan the thumbnail image and the title of the 
video before worrying about what the actual video is going to be. That can give 
you some success in the short term, but if you get into that mindset, you lose 
the creativity.

Mainstream media are more interested in YouTube and YouTubers now. Is that 
attention welcome or intrusive?
I’ve seen for a very long time that this was where it was heading; with the 
speed that online content was growing, I was very aware that it was the future. 
Now it feels like a lot of the mainstream is catching up to that.

People do often ask me: “Do you think one day you could transition to TV?”, as 
if that should be the ultimate ambition. But I’m happy here! YouTube isn’t a 
stepping stone. But it’s good to see that it is being taken a little bit more 
seriously now.

It’s nice to see more people understanding what we’re doing, asking more 
interesting questions about it and looking at it as just another pillar of 
media rather than a strange internet thing that “the kids” are into.
