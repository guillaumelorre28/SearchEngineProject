The Homecoming <http://thejamielloydcompany.com/our-shows/the-homecoming> 

I went to see this Pinter play with one eye on the fact that I’m about to do 
The Caretaker. I’d seen The Homecoming with Ian McShane on Broadway years ago 
and it wasn’t very good – most of the actors were American trying to do London 
accents which was jarring. But this production by Jamie Lloyd was flawless.John 
Simm <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/john-simm> played a Soho pimp Gemma 
Chan, the only woman in the cast, plays his brother’s wife arriving back from 
the States. She starts as the lowest-status character but by the end this very 
poised, intelligent woman becomes all-powerful. It’s very subtly done; on a 
knife edge it turns. The language is darkly hilarious but you have a sense of 
dread and menace at the same time. I thought all the performances were 
brilliant.

Orthodox <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=525xpuTWo-4> (2015) 

This is the directorial debut of David Leon, the actor who played Brenda 
Blethyn’s sidekick on the TV seriesVera. It’s a great, gritty, dark, punchy 
British film, a crime thriller set in the world of Orthodox Jews. Stephen 
Graham plays a butcher struggling with his faith and trying to make ends meet. 
His friend (Michael Smiley), a shady boxing promoter, asks him to burn down a 
house and so unfolds a crime story. It’s a really accomplished film: the 
direction is assured, the cinematography is impressive and the editing is 
imaginative, but Stephen Graham and Michael Smiley really carry it. They have a 
great dynamic and actors like that can elevate any material. I could watch 
Stephen Graham read the phone book.

Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/dan-leno-and-the-limehouse-golem.html> by 
Peter Ackroyd <https://www.theguardian.com/books/peterackroyd> 

I read this book because I’m in the film version, which is coming out later 
this year. It’s an amazing read, a very dark, macabre tale set in Victorian 
London. I’d describe it as a cross between the movieSeven 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4YV2_TcCoE>, because of the whodunnit serial 
killer element, and the Pinero playTrelawney of the ‘Wells’, about Victorian 
actors and life behind the scenes. The book is littered with real-life figures 
like Karl Marx, George Gissing and Dan Leno.Ackroyd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/peterackroyd> is brilliant in his 
understanding of London and all the incredible research he pours into his work, 
which gives the book a real sense of authenticity. There’s a fantastic 
edge-of-your-seat crime thriller running through it as well, and it has one of 
the best twists you’re ever likely to read.

 ‘One of the greatest ever’: Marlon Brando in The Wild One. Photograph:

Listen to Me Marlon <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgoFFzy0z8k> (2015) 

I just thought this was an amazing documentary. They discovered that Marlon 
Brando <https://www.theguardian.com/film/marlonbrando> had spent hours and 
hours recording himself on a Dictaphone, pouring out his thoughts and feelings 
on every aspect of his life from childhood to his training to his explosive 
rise. It was an incredible journey into an extraordinarily successful life that 
was very tragic at the same time. For me it was amazing to get an insight into 
his working methods, because he’s one of the greatest ever. He was obviously 
before my time but he influenced all the guys – Hackman, De Niro, Pacino – who 
influenced me. The documentary was done with such consideration for the subject 
and I can’t recommend it highly enough.

 London/Huddersfield combo Flawes: imaginative and soulful.

Flawes <http://www.flawes.com/> 

This is a new trio from London and Huddersfield that someone put me on to 
recently. They’re sort of bubbling just under the surface at the moment – their 
first single,Don’t Wait for Me <http:>, was on the BBC Introducing… playlist 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/introducing/entries/c403f512-366e-4a99-b8f5-e8f270dad0a6>
 at the end of last year and they’ve had an EP out calledUNSPKN. I love London 
Grammar <http://www.londongrammar.com/> and this is in a similar vein: soft 
guitar riffs mixed with an electronic sound. It’s imaginative and soulful and 
creates a very memorable dynamic. They’ve got a second EP calledCTRL coming out 
in April and I’m really looking forward to hearing it.

This Is England  <http://www.channel4.com/programmes/this-is-england>

I worked on Line of Duty <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00yzlr0> with Vicky 
McClure after she’d just finished the last series ofThis Is England and I kept 
nagging her to find out how it ended. It seems to have got stronger and 
stronger every series, and the last one seriously didn’t disappoint. I remember 
initially wondering why Shane Meadows was making a TV series out of the film, 
because the film on its own was a knockout, but it’s been such a brilliant 
journey. It’s kind of like that documentarySeven Up! 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rQ1V7m0Kfs> – you see these actors growing 
older and you’re so involved, you feel so much empathy for the characters. 
There’s a wonderful scene around a dinner table in the final series that goes 
on and on. I remember talking to Vicky about it. Apparently it was filmed on a 
bank of cameras and they only did a couple of takes, all improvised. It was 
just brilliantly acted. It left you wanting more.
