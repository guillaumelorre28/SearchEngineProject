Here are two Ivan Rogers-related blogs that are worth reading.

 * George Eaton at the New Statesman says Brexiteers do not respect the 
British constitution. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/01/how-brexit-breaking-british-constitution>
For decades, eurosceptics revered the UK’s unwritten constitution: its 
sovereign parliament, its independent judiciary, its neutral civil service. But 
an alternative centre of power - the people - has now been established. Rather 
than their loyalty to the constitution, institutions are now judged according 
to their loyalty to the demos (nearly half of whom voted to remain) ...

The elected Commons is no more respected. There is only one parliament that is 
currently guaranteed a say on the final Brexit deal - and it is not the British 
one. Brussels’ much-maligned MEPs, unlike MPs, are assured a vote.

Like past revolutionaires, the Brexiteers are seeking to remake national 
institutions in their own image. But as they contend with the biggest task 
facing any government since 1945, they may yet regret their dismissal of 
accumulated wisdom.

 * Vincenzo Scarpetta, a policy analyst at Open Europe, says in an article for 
CapX that Rogers’ resignation will not have a big impact on Brexit. 
<https://capx.co/the-departure-of-ivan-rogers-wont-knock-brexit-off-course/> 
But the reality is that Sir Ivan was never going to be the UK’s lead 
negotiator in the Brexit talks. This role will be reserved for the so-called 
“sherpas” of heads of state and government. Oliver Robbins, the permanent 
secretary at the new Department for Exiting the EU, will function as the sherpa 
for Theresa May.

Had Robbins resigned out of the blue instead, that would have been a 
completely different proposition – and a much bigger deal.

In other words, while Sir Ivan’s experience and knowledge would certainly have 
come in handy over the next few months, we should not exaggerate the possible 
consequences of his resignation for the government’s negotiating strategy – let 
alone for the UK’s chances of securing a good deal.

The Commons European scrutiny committee wrote to Sir Ivan Rogers last month 
asking him to give evidence to it in the new year. Nothing was agreed butSir 
Bill Cash, the Conservative Eurosceptic who chairs the committee, has written 
to him again today renewing the invitation. Cash said the committee’s interest 
in hearing from Rogers was “all the stronger” in the light of his resignation.

Labour calls for Commons statement on Rogers' resignation

Sir Keir Starmer <https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer>, the shadow 
Brexit secretary, has written an open letter to David Davis, the Brexit 
secretary, urging him to make a Commons statement next Monday about the 
resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers. Starmer says Rogers’s departure, and his 
farewell email, raise a number of questions about the government’s strategy.

Here’s an extract from the letter.

Since the UK permanent representation to the EU (UKRep) should be central to 
the negotiations that will then ensue, it is frankly astonishing that in his 
resignation letter to his colleagues, Sir Ivan says: “We do not yet know what 
the government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK’s relationship 
with the EU after exit”. Time is running out. It is now vital that the 
government demonstrates not only that it has a plan but also that it has a 
clear timetable for publication ...

It is – as I know you agree – a crucial part of our system of government that 
our civil service remains independent of the executive and able to give 
detailed, objective advice tomMinisters. There are obvious concerns – 
underlined by Sir Ivan’s insistence that UKRep staff continue to “challenge 
ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and … never be afraid to speak the 
truth to those in power” – that this principle is being undermined by the 
government’s current approach to Brexit negotiations. It is crucial that the 
government remain open, transparent and accountable throughout this process and 
I hope you will provide reassurance that this will be the case.

Lunchtime summary

 * A Conservative former cabinet minister and leading leave campaigner has 
been accused of smearing Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain’s outgoing ambassador to the 
EU.In successive interviews Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions 
secretary, claimed that Rogers had a role in information embarrassing to 
ministers being leaked, that he was not trusted, and that he was kept out of 
the loop. (See8.42am  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/04/ivan-rogers-brexit-eu-ambassador-ids-couldnt-be-trusted-by-ministers-claims-duncan-smith-politics-live?page=with:block-586caf43e4b08d2df8a6e400#block-586caf43e4b08d2df8a6e400>
and 12.28pm.)Dave Penman, head of the FDA, the union representing senior civil 
servants, hit back, saying Duncan Smith’s allegations would undermine the civil 
service. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/ministers-failing-to-defend-independence-of-senior-mandarins-dave-penman>
 AndLord Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office, told the World at One 
that Duncan Smith’s claim amounted to a “smear”. Commenting on the claim that 
Rogers leaked the story about him telling Number 10 it could take 10 years to 
negotiate a free trade deal with the EU, Ricketts said: 
I think there’s absolutely no evidence for that. I’m afraid that’s a bit of a 
smear against Ivan Rogers. I think it’s equally likely that it was leaked 
somewhere from the centre with a political motive of undermining him because he 
was saying things that people at the centre were not very happy about.

That’s what I mean when I say whoever is put into Brussels, ministers have got 
to stand behind them and defend them because officials cannot operate in this 
politicised environment if ministers are not prepared to stand behind them.

The claim that Rogers was actually the victim of that leak, not the 
perpetrator of it, is also backed up by an account in the Times (paywall) 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/angry-hurt-and-hung-out-to-dry-by-may-s-chief-lieutenants-bbfhxs93p>
 saying this episode ruined his relationship with Number 10. The Times says:

If [Rogers] was cross about the leak, he was apoplectic about the reaction. No 
10’s failure to offer him sufficient backing after the leak left him surprised 
and dismayed. Mrs May’s chief lieutenants, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, were 
blamed for hanging him out to dry, with all the consequences for his authority 
acrossEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and in Whitehall 
that would bring.

“No 10 might be furious that he is going but they created this resignation. 
They briefed against him, someone leaked the memo [about Brexit taking ten 
years], and they tried to pin the so-called failed negotiation [under Mr 
Cameron] on Tom Scholar [Mr Cameron’s adviser on the European Union] and Ivan 
Rogers,” according to one former colleague in Brussels.

“If you are the British ambassador, your job is to say the truth back home and 
to put the best possible case in Brussels. When you do not have the support of 
your prime minister you cannot do the job.”

On the World at One Peter Lilley, another Conservative former cabinet minister 
and prominent leave supporter, partially defended Duncan Smith. Lilley said he 
did not know who leaked the “10 years” story, but that Rogers clearly did want 
the email he sent out yesterday to be leaked. Lilley said:

This letter was clearly intended and inevitably going to leak because he sent 
it to all his staff as an email, and it is written in a tone which is really 
designed for publication. So we know that at least one of his two leaked emails 
was made in a way that was designed to become public.

 * Former top civil servants have said the government will be making a grave 
mistake if it insists on Rogers being replaced by a committed Brexiteer.The 
Telegraph and the Daily Mail have both reported that this is the government’s 
intention. BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews)

 AndLord Ricketts, the former head of the Foreign Office, said the same thing 
on the World at One. He said:

I’m really concerned about this undertone of denigration of Ivan as a person 
and this feeling that it has got to be one of us next time. That is a complete 
misunderstanding of what civil servants are for ... This idea that you have got 
to have someone pro-Brexit out their politicises the civil service in a way 
that we have never done in this country.

However, a close reading of the Telegraph

be replaced by someone who wants to make a success of Brexit, not necessarily 
by someone who has been a lifelong supporter of leaving the EU. My colleague

 * Alistair Burt, a former Foreign Office minister, has said there should be a 
statement in the Commons about Rogers’ resignation when MPs return next week.
(See12.11pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/04/ivan-rogers-brexit-eu-ambassador-ids-couldnt-be-trusted-by-ministers-claims-duncan-smith-politics-live?page=with:block-586ce596e4b081b2b4ed9ee4#block-586ce596e4b081b2b4ed9ee4>
 * The European commission has said it regrets the departure of Rogers. At a 
briefing in Brussels commission spokeswomanNatasha Bertaud said: 
We regret the loss of a very professional, very knowledgeable - while not 
always easy - interlocutor and diplomat who always loyally defended the 
interests of his government.

Asked if his resignation shortly before the tough Brexit talks begin would 
cause problems, Bertaud said: “This is not something that we are going to 
comment on at this stage. Negotiations have not yet started and we are still 
waiting for the triggering of article 50 to commence those negotiations.”

 * Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, has said that slashing 
regulations for farmers will be the government’s key priority for the 
agriculture sector as Britain leaves the European Union. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/andrea-leadsom-vows-to-scrap-eu-red-tape-for-farmers-after-brexit>
She also suggested that farmers would still be able to employ seasonal workers 
from the EU after Brexit. (See11.39am.)

 * Britain’s manufacturers ended 2016 on a strong note, according to a survey 
that signalled the fastest growth in the sector for more than two years and 
indicated that the weak pound had boosted exports. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/uk-manufacturing-growth-at-a-30-month-high-says-pmi-survey>
Commenting on the figuresMark Reckless, Ukip’s economics spokesman, said: 
The manufacturing purchasing managers index hitting a two and a half year high 
of 56.1 today is just the latest data showing the UK economy growing strongly. 
Why do the media always preface such news with ‘unexpectedly’ or ‘despite 
Brexit’? Most people voted leave because they thought we would be better off 
out of the EU, so their confidence increased when they won the vote.

The problem is that the remainers who write and report on economic commentary 
do not understand this. The worst aspect of this misapprehension is that it has 
led the Bank of England, led with a remainer mindset, to stoke what may be an 
inflationary boom with yet lower interest rates and even more quantitative 
easing (QE). It’s time they woke up, understood how strong our economy is, and 
corrected their mistakes. We should stop QE and raise interest rates to limit 
inflation, rather than artificially stoke an economy that is doing well enough 
in its own as we leave the EU.

 * Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has said he is not consulted by Jeremy 
Corbyn on key strategy decisions, and does not even know with whom the party 
leader discusses such issues. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/jeremy-corbyn-doesnt-consult-me-on-strategy-decisions-says-watson>
 * John Whittingdale, the former culture secretary, has said that Sir Brian 
Leveson does not to chair the second phase of his public inquiry into the press.
There is meant to be a second part of the Leveson inquiry looking into the 
specific phone-hacking allegations involving the News of the World and other 
papers that were overlooked during the first inquiry because criminal trials 
were pending. The government is consulting on whether to go ahead with this. 
Asked if it should go ahead, Whittingdale told the Today programme: 
Apart from anything else, the one thing that’s clear is that Lord Justice 
Leveson has no wish to undertake another inquiry. So you’ve got to find 
somebody.

He’s got other jobs to do now, he’s already given up 15 months of his life for 
one inquiry and I’ve talked to him and I know he doesn’t have any enthusiasm.

 * Arlene Foster has said that she will not stand down as Northern Ireland’s 
first minister over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal and that calls for her 
to go were “misogynistic”.

Sir Ivan Rogers could still take part in a meeting with European counterparts 
next week despite the criticisms expressed in his resignation email, the Press 
Association reports. The next scheduled meeting of the Coreper II group - made 
up of the permanent representatives from each member state - is due to take 
place on January 10, but officials at the UK mission in Brussels said no formal 
date had been fixed for Rogers’ departure. Final arrangements for the UK 
presence at the meeting have not been confirmed but a spokeswoman said: “Ivan 
would, I assume, attend.”

The head of the top civil servants’ union has accused ministers including 
Theresa May of failing to defend the independence of its senior mandarins 
following the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers as Britain’s ambassador in 
Brussels, my colleagueRajeev Syal reports.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Here are two Ivan Rogers-related blogs that are worth reading.

 * George Eaton at the New Statesman says Brexiteers do not respect the 
British constitution. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/01/how-brexit-breaking-british-constitution>
For decades, eurosceptics revered the UK’s unwritten constitution: its 
sovereign parliament, its independent judiciary, its neutral civil service. But 
an alternative centre of power - the people - has now been established. Rather 
than their loyalty to the constitution, institutions are now judged according 
to their loyalty to the demos (nearly half of whom voted to remain) ...

The elected Commons is no more respected. There is only one parliament that is 
currently guaranteed a say on the final Brexit deal - and it is not the British 
one. Brussels’ much-maligned MEPs, unlike MPs, are assured a vote.

Like past revolutionaires, the Brexiteers are seeking to remake national 
institutions in their own image. But as they contend with the biggest task 
facing any government since 1945, they may yet regret their dismissal of 
accumulated wisdom.

 * Vincenzo Scarpetta, a policy analyst at Open Europe, says in an article for 
CapX that Rogers’ resignation will not have a big impact on Brexit. 
<https://capx.co/the-departure-of-ivan-rogers-wont-knock-brexit-off-course/> 
But the reality is that Sir Ivan was never going to be the UK’s lead 
negotiator in the Brexit talks. This role will be reserved for the so-called 
“sherpas” of heads of state and government. Oliver Robbins, the permanent 
secretary at the new Department for Exiting the EU, will function as the sherpa 
for Theresa May.

Had Robbins resigned out of the blue instead, that would have been a 
completely different proposition – and a much bigger deal.

In other words, while Sir Ivan’s experience and knowledge would certainly have 
come in handy over the next few months, we should not exaggerate the possible 
consequences of his resignation for the government’s negotiating strategy – let 
alone for the UK’s chances of securing a good deal.
 
The Commons European scrutiny committee wrote to Sir Ivan Rogers last month 
asking him to give evidence to it in the new year. Nothing was agreed butSir 
Bill Cash, the Conservative Eurosceptic who chairs the committee, has written 
to him again today renewing the invitation. Cash said the committee’s interest 
in hearing from Rogers was “all the stronger” in the light of his resignation.
 
Sir Keir Starmer <https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer>, the shadow 
Brexit secretary, has written an open letter to David Davis, the Brexit 
secretary, urging him to make a Commons statement next Monday about the 
resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers. Starmer says Rogers’s departure, and his 
farewell email, raise a number of questions about the government’s strategy.

Here’s an extract from the letter.

Since the UK permanent representation to the EU (UKRep) should be central to 
the negotiations that will then ensue, it is frankly astonishing that in his 
resignation letter to his colleagues, Sir Ivan says: “We do not yet know what 
the government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK’s relationship 
with the EU after exit”. Time is running out. It is now vital that the 
government demonstrates not only that it has a plan but also that it has a 
clear timetable for publication ...

It is – as I know you agree – a crucial part of our system of government that 
our civil service remains independent of the executive and able to give 
detailed, objective advice tomMinisters. There are obvious concerns – 
underlined by Sir Ivan’s insistence that UKRep staff continue to “challenge 
ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and … never be afraid to speak the 
truth to those in power” – that this principle is being undermined by the 
government’s current approach to Brexit negotiations. It is crucial that the 
government remain open, transparent and accountable throughout this process and 
I hope you will provide reassurance that this will be the case.

The main person from Ukip commenting on the Ivan Rogers story yesterday was 
Nigel Farage, the former leader. TodayPaul Nuttall, the current leader, has 
posted his first tweet on the subject.
Paul Nuttall (@paulnuttallukip) 
Sir Ivan Rogers resignation is a good thing for Britain. He had become far to 
close to the EU Institutions to do his job properly.

 * A Conservative former cabinet minister and leading leave campaigner has 
been accused of smearing Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain’s outgoing ambassador to the 
EU.In successive interviews Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions 
secretary, claimed that Rogers had a role in information embarrassing to 
ministers being leaked, that he was not trusted, and that he was kept out of 
the loop. (See8.42am  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/04/ivan-rogers-brexit-eu-ambassador-ids-couldnt-be-trusted-by-ministers-claims-duncan-smith-politics-live?page=with:block-586caf43e4b08d2df8a6e400#block-586caf43e4b08d2df8a6e400>
and 12.28pm.)Dave Penman, head of the FDA, the union representing senior civil 
servants, hit back, saying Duncan Smith’s allegations would undermine the civil 
service. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/ministers-failing-to-defend-independence-of-senior-mandarins-dave-penman>
 AndLord Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office, told the World at One 
that Duncan Smith’s claim amounted to a “smear”. Commenting on the claim that 
Rogers leaked the story about him telling Number 10 it could take 10 years to 
negotiate a free trade deal with the EU, Ricketts said: 
I think there’s absolutely no evidence for that. I’m afraid that’s a bit of a 
smear against Ivan Rogers. I think it’s equally likely that it was leaked 
somewhere from the centre with a political motive of undermining him because he 
was saying things that people at the centre were not very happy about.

That’s what I mean when I say whoever is put into Brussels, ministers have got 
to stand behind them and defend them because officials cannot operate in this 
politicised environment if ministers are not prepared to stand behind them.

The claim that Rogers was actually the victim of that leak, not the 
perpetrator of it, is also backed up by an account in the Times (paywall) 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/angry-hurt-and-hung-out-to-dry-by-may-s-chief-lieutenants-bbfhxs93p>
 saying this episode ruined his relationship with Number 10. The Times says:

If [Rogers] was cross about the leak, he was apoplectic about the reaction. No 
10’s failure to offer him sufficient backing after the leak left him surprised 
and dismayed. Mrs May’s chief lieutenants, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, were 
blamed for hanging him out to dry, with all the consequences for his authority 
acrossEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and in Whitehall 
that would bring.

“No 10 might be furious that he is going but they created this resignation. 
They briefed against him, someone leaked the memo [about Brexit taking ten 
years], and they tried to pin the so-called failed negotiation [under Mr 
Cameron] on Tom Scholar [Mr Cameron’s adviser on the European Union] and Ivan 
Rogers,” according to one former colleague in Brussels.

“If you are the British ambassador, your job is to say the truth back home and 
to put the best possible case in Brussels. When you do not have the support of 
your prime minister you cannot do the job.”

On the World at One Peter Lilley, another Conservative former cabinet minister 
and prominent leave supporter, partially defended Duncan Smith. Lilley said he 
did not know who leaked the “10 years” story, but that Rogers clearly did want 
the email he sent out yesterday to be leaked. Lilley said:

This letter was clearly intended and inevitably going to leak because he sent 
it to all his staff as an email, and it is written in a tone which is really 
designed for publication. So we know that at least one of his two leaked emails 
was made in a way that was designed to become public.

 * Former top civil servants have said the government will be making a grave 
mistake if it insists on Rogers being replaced by a committed Brexiteer.The 
Telegraph and the Daily Mail have both reported that this is the government’s 
intention. BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews)

Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff, said insisting on giving 
the job to a Brexiteer would be a mistake. (See10.26am.)

 AndLord Ricketts, the former head of the Foreign Office, said the same thing 
on the World at One. He said:

I’m really concerned about this undertone of denigration of Ivan as a person 
and this feeling that it has got to be one of us next time. That is a complete 
misunderstanding of what civil servants are for ... This idea that you have got 
to have someone pro-Brexit out their politicises the civil service in a way 
that we have never done in this country.

However, a close reading of the Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/03/british-ambassador-eu-sir-ivan-rogers-unexpectedly-quits-just/>
 andMail 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4084172/Britain-s-ambassador-EU-QUITS-just-weeks-Theresa-set-start-Brexit-talks.html>
 stories suggests that government sources are briefing that they want Rogers to 
be replaced by someone who wants to make a success of Brexit, not necessarily 
by someone who has been a lifelong supporter of leaving the EU. My colleague
Patrick Wintourhas written an article about who the possible candidates are.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/may-begins-search-for-new-eu-envoy-amid-calls-for-pro-brexit-appointment>
 * Alistair Burt, a former Foreign Office minister, has said there should be a 
statement in the Commons about Rogers’ resignation when MPs return next week.
(See12.11pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/04/ivan-rogers-brexit-eu-ambassador-ids-couldnt-be-trusted-by-ministers-claims-duncan-smith-politics-live?page=with:block-586ce596e4b081b2b4ed9ee4#block-586ce596e4b081b2b4ed9ee4>
 * The European commission has said it regrets the departure of Rogers. At a 
briefing in Brussels commission spokeswomanNatasha Bertaud said: 
We regret the loss of a very professional, very knowledgeable - while not 
always easy - interlocutor and diplomat who always loyally defended the 
interests of his government.

Asked if his resignation shortly before the tough Brexit talks begin would 
cause problems, Bertaud said: “This is not something that we are going to 
comment on at this stage. Negotiations have not yet started and we are still 
waiting for the triggering of article 50 to commence those negotiations.”

 * Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, has said that slashing 
regulations for farmers will be the government’s key priority for the 
agriculture sector as Britain leaves the European Union. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/andrea-leadsom-vows-to-scrap-eu-red-tape-for-farmers-after-brexit>
She also suggested that farmers would still be able to employ seasonal workers 
from the EU after Brexit. (See11.39am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/04/ivan-rogers-brexit-eu-ambassador-ids-couldnt-be-trusted-by-ministers-claims-duncan-smith-politics-live?page=with:block-586cdb3de4b081b2b4ed9e91#block-586cdb3de4b081b2b4ed9e91>
 * Britain’s manufacturers ended 2016 on a strong note, according to a survey 
that signalled the fastest growth in the sector for more than two years and 
indicated that the weak pound had boosted exports. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/uk-manufacturing-growth-at-a-30-month-high-says-pmi-survey>
Commenting on the figuresMark Reckless, Ukip’s economics spokesman, said: 
The manufacturing purchasing managers index hitting a two and a half year high 
of 56.1 today is just the latest data showing the UK economy growing strongly. 
Why do the media always preface such news with ‘unexpectedly’ or ‘despite 
Brexit’? Most people voted leave because they thought we would be better off 
out of the EU, so their confidence increased when they won the vote.

The problem is that the remainers who write and report on economic commentary 
do not understand this. The worst aspect of this misapprehension is that it has 
led the Bank of England, led with a remainer mindset, to stoke what may be an 
inflationary boom with yet lower interest rates and even more quantitative 
easing (QE). It’s time they woke up, understood how strong our economy is, and 
corrected their mistakes. We should stop QE and raise interest rates to limit 
inflation, rather than artificially stoke an economy that is doing well enough 
in its own as we leave the EU.

 * Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has said he is not consulted by Jeremy 
Corbyn on key strategy decisions, and does not even know with whom the party 
leader discusses such issues. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/jeremy-corbyn-doesnt-consult-me-on-strategy-decisions-says-watson>
 * John Whittingdale, the former culture secretary, has said that Sir Brian 
Leveson does not to chair the second phase of his public inquiry into the press.
There is meant to be a second part of the Leveson inquiry looking into the 
specific phone-hacking allegations involving the News of the World and other 
papers that were overlooked during the first inquiry because criminal trials 
were pending. The government is consulting on whether to go ahead with this. 
Asked if it should go ahead, Whittingdale told the Today programme: 
Apart from anything else, the one thing that’s clear is that Lord Justice 
Leveson has no wish to undertake another inquiry. So you’ve got to find 
somebody.

He’s got other jobs to do now, he’s already given up 15 months of his life for 
one inquiry and I’ve talked to him and I know he doesn’t have any enthusiasm.

 * Arlene Foster has said that she will not stand down as Northern Ireland’s 
first minister over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal and that calls for her 
to go were “misogynistic”. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38504878?intlink_from_url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/9365406e-dc41-4855-84cf-c6990bb3ef2e/arlene-foster&link_location=live-reporting-story> 
Sir Ivan Rogers could still take part in a meeting with European counterparts 
next week despite the criticisms expressed in his resignation email, the Press 
Association reports. The next scheduled meeting of the Coreper II group - made 
up of the permanent representatives from each member state - is due to take 
place on January 10, but officials at the UK mission in Brussels said no formal 
date had been fixed for Rogers’ departure. Final arrangements for the UK 
presence at the meeting have not been confirmed but a spokeswoman said: “Ivan 
would, I assume, attend.”
 
Two Brussels experts have rejected claims that Sir Ivan Rogers did not 
anticipate the UK voting to leave the EU.
