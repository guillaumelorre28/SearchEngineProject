The eurozone recovery remains disappointingly weak after Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> fell back into recession and Italy 
slowed to near stagnation.

The single currency area grew by just 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015, 
statistics body Eurostat reported on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/12/market-turmoil-eurozone-gdp-growth-figures-france-germany-live-updates>
.

On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 1.5%, down from 1.6% three months 
earlier, suggesting growth remains weak despite the European Central Bank’s 
stimulus measures and the positive impact of cheap oil.

Greece was the worst performing member of the eurozone, with GDP falling by 
0.6% in the last three months of last year. That followed a steep contraction 
of 1.4% between July and September, when capital controls were imposed and its 
banks were shut.

“Greece continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls,” 
said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight.

The news came as protesting farmers clashed with riot police in Athens

, as part of a major demonstration against austerity measures.

Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, the eurozone’s largest 
economy, grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. Domestic demand was solid, but 
foreign trade had a negative impact on growth with exports falling faster than 
imports.

The country was affected by the slowdown in the global economy, according to 
Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody’s Analytics.

Zabrodzka said:

The slowdown in emerging markets, particularly China, has dampened external 
demand for German products. The upside should come from the weaker euro, which 
should partially mitigate soft external demand

Carsten Brzeski of ING fears that Germany could struggle in 2016.


“On top of the well-known risk factors like slowing China and emerging markets 
or a still struggling eurozone, low oil prices and the possible weakness of the 
US economy could give the German economy a hard time,” he said.

“In particular, any slowdown of the US economy could turn out to be a double 
whammy for Germany.”

Portugal <https://www.theguardian.com/world/portugal> only grew by 0.2% in the 
last quarter, down from 0.4% in the third quarter. That’s a blow to Lisbon’s 
new leftwing government, as it tried to unwind some of the austerity measures 
implemented by its predecessors.

Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> was the big disappointment, 
with expansion slowing to just 0.1% against predictions of 0.3% growth. Italian 
growth has slowed steadily through 2015, since managing growth of 0.4% in the 
first three months.

And Finland, one of the most fervent supporters of austerity during the debt 
crisis, is also still shrinking. GDP fell by 0.1% in the last quarter.

The Netherlands expanded by 0.3%, while the Spanish economic recovery 
continued with growth of 0.8%. That made Spain the only large EU member to grow 
faster thanBritain, which posted growth of 0.5%

.

Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets warned that the eurozone faced “big risks” 
this year, if the recent stock market turmoil fed through to the real economy.

He said:

We currently pencil in GDP growth of 0.3% q/q for Q1. The big question is how 
much the turmoil on financial markets will weigh on growth. The wealth effect 
may not be very strong in the euro area, but it is still negative.

“Moreover, the euro is about to strengthen which dampens both exports and 
inflation. On top of that, problems in the banking sectors might mean that bank 
lending soon will decline before long.”

IHS’s Howard Archer also warned that the eurozone figures could be 
disappointing this year.

We have been expecting eurozone GDP growth to improve modestly to 1.7% in 
2016, but this is currently looking ever more questionable and may well need to 
be revised down.

“There are clearly mounting downside risks to the eurozone growth outlook 
coming from global growth problems and financial market weakness and 
volatility.”

European stock markets rallied on Friday morning, after days of heavy losses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/turbulent-week-stock-markets-investors-safe-havens-gold-yen>
. The Stoxx 600 index has shed 15% of its value this year, with bank shares 
hitting their lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.
