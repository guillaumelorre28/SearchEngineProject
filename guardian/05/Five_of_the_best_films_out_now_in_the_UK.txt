1 Office Christmas Party (15)

(Josh Gordon, Will Speck, 2016, US) 105 mins. 

Maybe what the world needs right now is an apolitical, irreverent, 
inconsequential farce – in which case, this is Christmas come early. The title 
tells you enough: thinkThe Hangover 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-the-hangover> meets 
Horrible Bosses, with a dash ofHigh Rise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/high-rise>. Not every gag lands but many do, 
and the cast is packed with seasoned performers:Jennifer Aniston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-aniston>, Kate McKinnon and Jason 
Bateman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/09/jason-bateman-my-dirty-secret-playing-the-straight-man-because-he-gets-to-be-in-every-scene>
 among them.

Lee fights Chicago gun crime with theatrical satire, rap musical and farce in 
this energised transposition of the Greek myth Lysistrata, which seesTeyonah 
Parris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/17/teyonah-parris-mad-men-chi-raq-spike-lee>
 lead a women’s sex strike against their trigger-happy menfolk. The tone is 
wildly uneven but the passion is palpable and the cast full of familiar faces (

Hailee Steinfeld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/20/hailee-steinfeld-interview-enders-game>
 is on star-making form in this smart, rounded teen comedy, playing an 
ugly-duckling type sent into meltdown when her BFF gets together with her 
brother. Witty dialogue and affection for its characters (Woody Harrelson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/woody-harrelson> is terrific as her 
despairing teacher) make this one to cherish.

A stirring demonstration of the power of cinema, in particular Disney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company>, this part-animated 
documentary tells how the studio’s cartoons enabled two parents to communicate 
with their child after he was diagnosed with autism. It’s an insight into both 
disability and storytelling.

Disney sails into lovingly rendered Polynesian waters with its latest heroine: 
an island teen who teams up with a cocky demigod to avert disaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/moana>. Their seafaring odyssey is 
crowd-pleasing and the cultural setting sensitively rendered, even if the story 
isn’t exactly a whole new world.
