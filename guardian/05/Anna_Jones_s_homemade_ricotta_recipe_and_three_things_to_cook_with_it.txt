There is so much to love about ricotta. First up, its clean, fresh cloud-like 
milkiness – many of us think of it as a spring-time thing, but in fact, it 
works brilliantly as a much needed partner for the roots and roasts and 
punchier flavours we’ll be eating for the next few months. Next, its 
versatility – in baking and desserts; to fill ravioli or spoon over warm 
vegetables. Best of all, though, is that it’s made from something that would 
otherwise be wasted. The ricotta that you buy in the shops is a byproduct of 
the cheesemaking process. Whey that has been drained off the cheese curds is 
reheated to make ricotta – hence its Italian name, which means “recooked”.

My recipe involves gently heating whole milk, then adding vinegar to encourage 
little curds to form, which are then gathered and strained to form the softest 
and most gentle of the cheeses. I’ve tried lemon juice, but vinegar somehow 
produces more ricotta. The quantity of vinegar is key, too little and the curds 
won’t form properly; too much and the end result will taste like a chip shop. 
Because this recipe is so simple there is nowhere to hide, so use the best milk 
that you can afford (the best ricotta I’ve tasted was made in Italy using raw, 
unpasteurised milk, but that’s not as widely available in theUK 
<http://www.hookandson.co.uk/RawMilk/>).

Some recipes need a certain type of ricotta. The type you can buy in most 
supermarkets can be very soft, more mascarpone-like in texture than the firmer, 
strained ricotta I got used to working with when I cooked in Italy. That’s why 
I started making my own and I’d urge you to try too – it’s not as difficult as 
you might think. If that’s a step too far though, you can make the recipes 
below with supermarket ricotta. If you do, then leave it in a sieve to drain 
excess liquid for a few hours, or ideally overnight, so it’s a little firmer. 
If you’re lucky enough to live near an Italian deli, most sell a good strained 
ricotta.

As well as a recipe for homemade ricotta, I have included three of my 
favourite simple ways to eat it. Aside from these almost any pasta would 
benefit from a little ricotta stirred through it, any pancake or waffle will 
sit happily next to a spoonful, and most fruits will team up well with a clean 
white helping drizzled with a little honey.

Homemade ricotta

How long you hang your ricotta for will depend on how you want to use it. To 
bake your ricotta whole or to use it to fill pasta you want something firm, so 
no moisture seeps out during cooking. For other recipes, such as the pasta or 
the whipped ricotta below, you could get away with a less firm texture, so 
hanging it for just a few hours would suffice.

Makes about 300g
2 litres whole milk
A pinch of sea salt
40ml distilled white vinegar

1 Pour the milk into a large pan, add a pinch of sea salt and put over a 
medium heat. Allow the milk to heat up slowly, stirring from time to time.

2 When it is almost coming to the boil – when steam and small bubbles begin to 
appear on the surface (if you have a kitchen thermometer it should be 82C-85C) 
– remove from the heat, add the vinegar and stir gently. You will see curds 
starting to form. Continue to stir for 1 minute or so.

3 Cover with a clean cloth and allow it to sit for a couple of hours. Once the 
ricotta has rested, line a colander with a large piece of damp muslin and put 
this over a larger bowl or pan.

4 Spoon the ricotta into the colander and allow it to drain for an hour or so, 
or overnight depending on your desired firmness (see note above). To test 
whether the cheese is ready, gently lift the muslin up by the corners and twist 
lightly – the liquid should be slightly milky in colour. The ricotta is now 
ready. Transfer to a container, seal and store in the fridge and use within 3 
days.

Whipped herb and lemon ricotta

Quick and super-light, this blend of herbs and ricotta is ideal for dipping. I 
use baby vegetables, but fingers of good toast or crackers would work too.

Serves 4
450g fresh ricotta
Salt and black pepper
1 garlic clove, crushed or grated
2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 
1 tbsp mint leaves, finely chopped
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon, plus a good squeeze of lemon juice
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus more to serve

To serve
Baby carrots, beetroots and radishes, cut into sticks

1 Put your ricotta into a bowl with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then beat 
it with a wooden spoon until light and fluffy. You can do this with an electric 
mixer if you want it really cloud-like.

2 Now stir in the garlic, herbs, zest and olive oil. Taste for balance and 
adjust the seasoning, if necessary, adding a squeeze of lemon juice and a 
little more of whatever you think it needs.

3 Serve in the middle of the table with your choice of veg or toast for 
dipping.

4 Drizzle with some olive oil and serve.

Honey ricotta with baked figs

This is a faintly sweet take on ricotta that could be served as a dessert or a 
quick lunch, piled on top of toasted bread with some bitter leaves to counter 
the very slight sweetness.

Serves 4-6
250g ricotta
1 tbsp of runny honey
Seeds from 1 vanilla pod
1 orange, zested, juice reserved
6 figs
50g almonds

1 Preheat your oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a baking tray with a sheet 
of greaseproof paper.

2 Turn the ricotta out of its packet on to the lined tray, then drizzle it 
with honey. Grate over the orange zest and scatter the vanilla seeds on top.

3 Halve the figs and arrange them around the ricotta. Squeeze over the juice 
of ½ the orange and a little more honey then put into the oven to bake for 20 
minutes.

4 Meanwhile, roughly chop the almonds. Scatter them over the baking tray and 
roast for the last 5 minutes.

5 Serve straight from the oven in the middle of the table. 


Spaghetti with chard, garlic, chilli and ricotta

One of the fastest pastas I know (the sauce is cooked in the time it takes for 
the pasta to turn al dente) and for my money one of the nicest.

Serves 4 
400g spaghetti
Extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced 
1–2 red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
1 sprig of fresh rosemary, leaves picked 
400g chard, rinsed leaves shredded and stalks finely sliced
Grated zest and juice of 1 large unwaxed lemon (plus an extra lemon for juice, 
if needed)
Salt and black pepper
150g of ricotta 
Parmesan or pecorino (optional)

1 Put a large pan of boiling water on to boil and add a couple of generous 
pinches of salt. Once the water is at a rolling boil, add your pasta and cook 
according to the packet instructions or until just al dente.

2 Meanwhile, heat a good drizzle of olive oil in a large frying pan and add 
the garlic, chilli and rosemary. Fry for a minute or so, until the garlic is 
starting to colour, then add the chard stalks and sizzle for 1-2 minutes. Add 
the leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3–4 minutes, or until the leaves 
have wilted a little.

3 Drain the pasta, reserving a mugful of cooking water. Add a splash of the 
pasta water to the greens and mix well. Grate over the zest of the lemon and 
squeeze over the juice. Take off the heat and taste for seasoning. Crumble over 
the ricotta and stir it though. Serve topped with a drizzle of olive oil and, 
if you like, a wispy grating of parmesan or pecorino.
