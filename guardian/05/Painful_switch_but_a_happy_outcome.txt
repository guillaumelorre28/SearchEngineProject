It was the £2 WH Smith voucher that persuaded Vicky Fisher to honour Lloyds 
with her student grant cheque back in 1973 - that and the fact that her mother 
banked with them. Since then she's switched accounts twice.

The first time was painless: 'They switched me because they said a Lloyds 
Classic account would be better for me,' says Fisher. 'But when I realised I 
was paying something like £12 a quarter, I objected. I'd never had any problems 
with Lloyds but I didn't see why I should pay them to keep my money.' She 
didn't do anything about switching straight away and confesses that she was put 
off both by the prospect of 'financial limbo' and by the thought that 'it would 
all be too complicated'. It was.

'I did it all wrong. It didn't occur to me that I could run accounts in tandem.

'I closed down the Lloyds account, forgot to tell all the direct debit people 
that I was changing and ran up an overdraft. I should have planned it better 
and a long time in advance. First Direct sent me a splendid little package with 
lots of forms and useful information. I sort of scanned the booklet but that's 
as far as it got. It turned out all right in the end, though, and Lloyds were 
very understanding about paying off the overdraft.'

Would she switch again? 'It would have to reach crisis point. I like the 
convenience of First Direct, and being able to ring up cuts down on having to 
write a lot of letters.'
