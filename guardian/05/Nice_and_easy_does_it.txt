Until automated switching becomes fully operational in 2001, you will need to 
take charge of the process.

 Ask your bank for a list of your standing orders and direct debits - if you 
get your new bank to do it, the old bank may charge.

 Arrange an overdraft at your new bank, just to be on the safe side. Several 
providers offer switchers temporary interest- and charge-free overdrafts.

  Contact all organisations that you pay by direct debit to ask for a new 
mandate, then fill these in with your new details.

 Give your employer (or pension provider) your new bank details straight 
after your next pay-day.

 Give your new bank all the necessary details for setting up your standing 
orders, then cancel them at your old bank.

 Make sure that you have money in your new account by the date you give for 
the first payment of direct debits and standing orders.

 If you have sufficient savings, keep enough money in your old account to 
cover your monthly commitments until the new account is running smoothly.

 As soon as you are happy with the way things are going on your new account, 
and have your new cheque book and cards, close the old one. Write to your old 
bank and return your cards (cut in half), cheque books, paying-in books and so 
on.
