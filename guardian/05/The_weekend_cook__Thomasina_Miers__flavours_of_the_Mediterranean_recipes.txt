This summer we are swapping the Mediterranean for Burgundy. The food and wine 
will be delicious where we are staying, but part of me longs for the sun-baked 
olive oil and vinegar-steeped flavours of southern Europe. There the fruit is 
full, heavy and sweet, the roads are lined with lavender and olive groves and 
the influences of Africa and the Middle East have long permeated the cuisine.

The sweet-sour “agrodolce” flavours of Arabia are particularly felt in Sicily 
and Greece, where capers, olives and aubergines are in abundance and fig trees 
sag with the weight of ripe fruit dripping with sticky juices.

This week I am cooking in homage to all these ingredients: the first recipe is 
a mouth-watering and deeply satisfying classic, and the second an invention 
inspired by idyllic holidays in Greece, with tahini, honey and those wonderful 
figs. As in the Med, both recipes taste infinitely better with ripe fruit and 
vegetables. Long live the summer.

Aubergine caponata


Aubergine is known as poor man’s meat, but there is nothing poor about the 
rich flavours of this simple supper dish. Serves four.

4 aubergines 
Salt
5 large vine tomatoes
4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the final bake
1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
Large handful each of parsley and marjoram or thyme leaves, chopped
2 tbsp capers in brine, plus a little of the brine from the jar
Handful of kalamata or other juicy black olives, stoned and roughly chopped
2 tbsp red-wine vinegar
½-1 tsp brown sugar, depending on sweetness of tomatoes
4 tbsp breadcrumbs, optional
3-4 tbsp finely grated parmesan 

Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Slice the two largest aubergines in 
half lengthways and score them in a 0.5cm-deep criss-cross pattern, salt and 
leave to drain upside down over a wire rack for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, top and tail the other two aubergines, cut into 2-3cm rough cubes, 
salt and drain in a colander for 20 minutes. While they are draining, cover the 
tomatoes with boiling water, leave for 30 seconds, drain and peel. Roughly chop 
the flesh.

Rinse and pat the aubergine dry. Scoop out the flesh of the four halves and 
place the boat-like skins on a baking tray. Drizzle with a tablespoon of olive 
oil, season with salt and pepper and roast for 20-25 minutes until soft.

Heat a wide, heavy-bottomed saucepan over a high heat and add all the 
remaining aubergine flesh with the rest of the oil and some salt. Cook on a 
high heat for five to 10 minutes until turning golden, stirring every minute or 
so. Add the red onion, garlic and herbs and cook for a further five minutes, 
adding a splash more oil if needed. Add the capers and olives, followed by the 
tomatoes and vinegar. Season with salt, pepper and the sugar, and simmer for 
about 15 minutes, until thick and tender. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

Spoon a generous helping of caponata into the aubergine boats, sprinkle with 
the breadcrumbs and parmesan and drizzle with a little extra olive oil. Put 
back in the oven and roast until the breadcrumbs are golden and crunchy and the 
parmesan has melted.

Serve with rice and a sprinkling of fresh parsley.

The not-so-sweet flavour of this pudding, with its hint of sea salt, makes you 
want to keep going back for more. Serves six.

500g full-fat greek yoghurt
2-3 tbsp clear honey
3 tbsp tahini
Juice of ½ lemon
¼ tsp fine sea salt
6-10 figs
2 tbsp maple syrup
To serve
2-3 tbsp runny honey
2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
Extra-virgin olive oil, optional

Whisk together the yoghurt, honey, tahini, lemon juice and salt and taste. The 
yoghurt will taste less sweet when frozen, so you may want a little more honey 
if you have a sweet tooth. Pour into an ice-cream machine and churn for 45 
minutes until softly frozen. When it is ready, transfer to a freezer-proof 
container and freeze for at least four hours. If you don’t have an ice-cream 
machine, transfer to a freezer-proof container and freeze for an hour, then 
whisk it every hour for a further three hours then leave to freeze.

Heat the grill to its highest setting. Place the figs on a baking tray, 
drizzle with the maple syrup, then grill for 10 minutes until golden and 
bubbling. Allow to cool slightly.

Remove the ice-cream from the freezer 10 minutes before you are ready for 
pudding and then scoop into bowls with the warm figs. Drizzle with extra honey 
and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and, if you like, a tiny scrunch of 
extra sea salt and a drop or two of your finest olive oil.

And for the rest of the week


You may not be able to cram all the aubergine filling into the boats. If not, 
keep it in the fridge and use to stuff tomatoes or courgettes at another 
sitting – it would be delicious with currants and pine nuts scattered through. 
The yoghurt is also delicious with roast grapes or grilled peaches and so low 
in sugar that it makes a fairly virtuous and refreshing addition to breakfast 
spooned on to hot porridge.
