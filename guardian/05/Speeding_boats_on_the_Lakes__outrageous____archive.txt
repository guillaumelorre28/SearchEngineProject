The Lake District <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lake-district> Planning 
Board was urged at its meeting at Kendal yesterday to take immediate action 
with other interested authorities to control the speed of boats on lakes in the 
National Park.

Mr C. H. D. Acland of Ambleside, declared: “We do not want to see the 
slaughter on the roads finding its way on to our lakes.”


After stating that the speed of some craft on Windermere was “already 
outrageous,” he referred to fresh problems which were arising from an 
increasing amount of water ski-ing.


The board was told that the development control committee is to review the 
matter at its next meeting with a view to considering what action might be 
taken.


In raising the matter, Mr Acland said that the question of speed on the lakes 
should be treated in a much more urgent way and on a more radical and 
fundamental basis than had been done in the past.


Lady Muriel Lowther of Askham said the board should not do anything to stop 
water ski-ing because it was a sport that so many enjoyed.

She thought the matter might be solved if the board was able to recommend 
certain areas of the lakes which could be used for that purpose away from other 
craft.

With a view to protecting the beauty at the head of the dales, the Development 
Control Committee is to consider proposals at a meeting in the early autumn to 
prevent caravanning in certain areas.

Mr C. H. Bicknell said that in the past they had encouraged a broad policy of 
having large caravan sites well sited on the fringe of the Lake District and 
allowing development on smaller sites within the park provided they did not 
cause any injury to amenity. Approval had never been given for caravan sites at 
the head of the dales and the proposals would be designed to prevent any such 
development in particular areas in the future. The approval of the Minister of 
Housing and Local Government would have to be sought for the proposals to 
become effective.

Middle course
Mr Acland said during the Easter and Whitsuntide holidays camping had been 
taking place which was unsatisfactory from both the scenic and sanitation 
aspects.

Replying on behalf of the committee, Mr P. Cleave of Ulverston said that it 
was felt that the board would be unwise if it appeared to persecute the person 
who wanted to go off and camp on his own and enjoy quiet. The position at the 
head of Langdale had improved since the trouble of two years ago and he felt 
they should steer a course between too much control and too much licence when 
dealing with the problem of camping.
