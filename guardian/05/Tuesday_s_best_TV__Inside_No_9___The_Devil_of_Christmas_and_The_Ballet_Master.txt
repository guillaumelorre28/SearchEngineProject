The Ballet Master: Sir Peter Wright At 90 
7pm, BBC4

In his first major TV interview, Peter Wright candidly reflects on a dazzling 
career encompassing dance, choreography, teaching and TV directing. Under his 
supervision, the touring company of the Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet was 
transformed into the Birmingham Royal Ballet, while his Nutcracker has been 
cited as the greatest of all versions. This birthday tribute features 
contributions from colleagues and archive footage.Ali Catterall

The Real Marigold On Tour 
9pm, BBC2

A quartet of famous pensioners – Bobby George, Miriam Margolyes, Rosemary 
Shrager and Wayne Sleep – explore ways of spending their twilight years. 
Following their India trip, tonight it’s Florida, and life in two gated 
communities. Unsurprisingly, the odd preconception is overturned – plus, the 
occasionally acrid vibe between Rosemary and Miriam is something to behold. 
Concludes Friday, when the gang are in Japan.John Robinson

Tattoo Fixers 
9pm, E4

As per, the Fixers are on hand to help the victims of incapable inksmiths – or 
just those who regret their tats. Hapless romantic Karl needs Sketch’s skills 
following a misjudged tribute to his ex, while Christian convert Darren’s newly 
found faith proves incompatible with a devilish tattoo adorning his body. 
Meanwhile, Lucy Ann requires rectification on an unfortunate backside blunder, 
and a misjudged Game Of Thrones tribute requires Alice’s expertise.Mark 
Gibbings-Jones

Walliams & Friend Christmas Special 
10pm, BBC1

David Walliams is joined by Hugh Bonneville for a Christmas special, with the 
Downton actor playing a grammar-obsessed vicar, a toothsome gameshow host and a 
yoga guru with anger issues. To his credit, he hurls himself into this sorry 
business with vim, but even with sketches featuring, in one case, the combined 
heft of Biggins, the Chuckle Brothers and Bob Carolgees, the material just 
isn’t up to snuff.Ben Arnold

Inside No 9: The Devil Of Christmas 
10pm, BBC2

Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith’s twisted anthology comedy returns for a 
Christmas special, with Pemberton, Jessica Raine and Rula Lenska hamming it up 
gleefully as a family getting more than they bargained for while on an Alpine 
holiday. Initially, it’s a homage to 70s TV melodrama. But a voiceover – 
director’s commentary or something more sinister? – lends an uneasy undertone, 
and soon the spoofy chuckles are over.Phil Harrison

People Magazine Investigates 
10pm, Investigation Discovery

“It’s the American Jack the Ripper story,” says one talking head in this 
efficient doc, “except I think it’s Jack the Rippers.” The Long Island serial 
killer – or maybe killers – is believed to have murdered between 10 and 17 sex 
workers over 20 years, and yet police still have no suspects. A sobering and 
fascinating instalment of the true-crime series, if – somewhat inevitably – the 
investigators don’t provide any real resolution to events.Luke Holland

Pompeii With Michael Buerk
10.45pm, ITV

Clad in relaxed hack-on-safari beige and surrounded by oozing CGI, Buerk hosts 
a one-off documentary “following in the footsteps of” the real inhabitants of 
the port destroyed by volcanic eruption. The fancy bits where surviving ruins 
morph into the complete buildings of the past don’t reveal much we don’t know 
from any other show set in Roman times, but interviews with experts on 
Pompeiian food, drink, sex and entertainment are illuminating.Jack Seale

Raiders Of The Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, 1981) 1.35pm, BBC1

“Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?” Nice Spielbergian touch to give his 
heroic adventurer Indiana Jones these little human fears and foibles. The 
first, fastest and funniest of the Jones movies, with Harrison Ford’s 
indestructible archaeologist chasing from Nepal to Cairo with sparky partner 
Karen Allen to whip the ark of the covenant from under Nazi noses. A tremendous 
upgrade of the old Saturday matinees.Paul Howlett

Mr Peabody & Sherman (Rob Minkoff, 2014) 3.50pm, BBC1

Even by the flexible laws of animated movies, this Pixar adventure is a wacky 
creation. Mr Peabody (Ty Burrell) is a big-brained beagle who adopts 
seven-year-old human Sherman (Max Charles) and decides to teach him some 
history via his homemade time machine. Their headspinning tour includes the 
Trojan horse, King Tut, Leonardo da Vinci, Marie Antoinette, and a rip in the 
space-time continuum. Whoops!PH

Skyfall (Sam Mendes, 2012) 8pm, ITV2

Mendes’s Skyfall marked the 50th anniversary of Bond and is probably the best 
yet. Daniel Craig’s edgy, haunted 007 is pitted against rogue former agent 
Silva, played entertainingly as a fey, dyed-blond psychopath by Javier Bardem. 
Silva’s target is in fact Judi Dench’s regal M, very much the belle of this 
ball. There are spectacular stunts in Macau and Shanghai, but this is a 
staunchly British affair, set largely in London before a barnstorming, 
unusually poignant showdown at Skyfall, the Highlands pile of Bond’s youth.PH

The Impossible (JA Bayona, 2012) 9pm, More4

The Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 killed 230,000 people in south-east Asia, and 
this gripping, thoroughly convincing film brings all the shock, horror and 
emotion of the disaster surging back. It’s based on the true-life story of a 
Spanish family who were separated in the chaos and struggled desperately to 
locate each other. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are excellent as the parents 
in an extraordinary tale of familial love and survival.PH
