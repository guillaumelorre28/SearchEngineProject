For our final show of 2016, we were joined by Surrey batsman Arun Harinath and 
Felix White, guitarist inThe Maccabees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-maccabees>, cricket nut, Surrey member 
and all-round top man.

We discussed England’s travails – or not? – in India, whether Alastair Cook 
should remain Test captain and whether the national team’s year has had more 
highs than lows.

We picked through the year in cricket, spoke about our hopes for 2017 and, 
most importantly, do a cricketing secret Santa – what on earth is Felix buying 
for Haseeb Hameed?

Somehow, somewhere along the way, Harinath reveals that his mate Kumar 
Sangakkara regularly turns up to play cricket without his (much-needed) 
spectacles – cue a mad dash home – and they pick through why the break-up of 
cricket teams is invariably even more bitter than the break up of bands. Happy 
Christmas.
