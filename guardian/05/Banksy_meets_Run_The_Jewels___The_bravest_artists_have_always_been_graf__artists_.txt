BANKSY: Thanks for agreeing to play my theme park. Have you ever played in a 
theme park before?

EL-P I have not yet had the pleasure of playing in a theme park, or enjoying 
one for that matter.

KILLER MIKE I have not played a theme park. My dream is to play [US theme 
park] Six Flags Over Georgia before I check out of life. Mostly because they 
used to have a teen nightclub called Graffiti’s; I was there when I was a kid 
and that’s where I heard dope music and danced with girls from the suburbs 
after we snuck in.

The clip of your speech at Ferguson 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQs7CWKHM9w> after the verdict [when the jury 
decided not to charge officer Darren Wilson for the death of unarmed black 
teenager Michael Brown] made me cry. When did you last cry watching YouTube?

KM The last time YouTube made me cry was watching Dr John Henrik Clarke speak 
about Marcus Garvey. I was overwhelmed with pain for a great man that was 
abused and mistreated because he wanted to better the state of blacks globally. 
It is scary to think a system exists that wishes not to see all people live 
with human dignity and respect. I did, however, finish feeling encouraged that 
day will come.

EL-P When the two guys raised the lion and then set the lion free but they 
missed the lion and they visited it in Africa and the lion was now king of his 
tribe and had a wife and children but he recognised the two guys and ran up and 
hugged them and licked their faces. I wept like a baby.

When Kanye came to the UK recently, he played on a dairy farm and declared 
himself the greatest rock star in the world. Does he have any competition for 
that?

EL-P Absolutely not.

KM Kanye is amazing and may be the greatest rock star in the world but Rihanna 
is the new Tupac (in feminist form), and as much as I love rock, ain’t nobody 
do it like Pac! Ri-Ri rules in my book.

The magazine publishing this interview suggested the following conversation 
topics: pressure to conform, creative expression and corporate sponsorship, who 
are the bravest artists you know, what’s the future going to look like in your 
respective art forms? So yeah… what they said.

KM I’m a Banksy <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/banksy> fan. I’m 
also a fan of Chris Hobe, Mister Totem, Drew Wootten, Mad Clout, Hense and 
Sever, in visual and street art. And Jonathan Mannion and Shane Nash in 
photography.

EL-P The bravest artists I’ve ever known have always been graf artists. 
Risking your life and your freedom is no joke. Whoever made Mount Rushmore was 
probably brave as well, assuming that rock-climbing equipment was not at its 
zenith at the time.

street artist Banksy 
I like to ask artists this question: if you could choose only one, would you 
rather be thought of as a great artist or a nice person?

EL-P Interesting question. We all want recognition and validation to an extent 
for our art, but greatness as a trade for decency is a risky proposition. In my 
life I try to leave the people I encounter with the feeling that they have been 
respected and treated with warmth and appreciation. Being known as honorable is 
way more important to me. But being that my career is in the public and my 
personal relationships are ultimately private, I suppose, for the sake of the 
question, being considered a great artist publicly means a bit more than being 
considered a nice guy publicly. Although I like to think I am thought of in 
that way. Point being, I don’t get paid to be a nice guy, I just try to be one.

KM I don’t know what the hell the future brings. If I did, I would play the 
lotto and win the mega millions and buy toy cars, real muscle cars, sneakers 
and art. I cannot lie: as good as it feels to get my deserved props, the best 
part of reading social media after I meet folks is reading: “Mike was a nice 
guy”. I believe being honourable lasts longer than rapping good.
