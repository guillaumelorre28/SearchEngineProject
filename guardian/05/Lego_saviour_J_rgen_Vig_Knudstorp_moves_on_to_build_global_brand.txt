British chief operations officer and the first non-Dane to lead the 84-year-old 
company.

<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lego> brand group as the toymaker 
looks to expand overseas. He was appointed chief executive in 2004, overseeing 
a transformative period when Lego’s losses turned into profit and revenue 
increased five-fold to 35.8bn kroner (£4.1bn) in 2015.

 Outgoing CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp 
Thomas Kirk Kristiansen, great grandson of Lego’s founder, will become deputy 
chair of the new brand group. He said: “Our family ownership is deeply rooted 
in the Lego idea, which is about learning and development through play ... With 
our recent growth and globalisation come new and exciting opportunities for the 
brand, and we establish theLego <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lego> 
brand group to look into these new opportunities.”

Padda, 60, has been with Lego for 14 years and is currently responsible for 
operations, people, and organisational development.

“He has a deep knowledge of our entire company, a very clear sense of what we 
need to do to take the company to the next level, and he is a true ambassador 
for [Lego],” Kristiansen said.

Padda said there was still a lot of untapped opportunity for Lego, where 60% 
to 70% of products are new every year. “There are millions of children around 
the world that do not have access to the product,” he added.

He said targets for expansion include China, where Lego last month opened a 
new factory in Jiaxing to supply toys to markets across Asia 
<https://www.lego.com/en-gb/aboutus/news-room/2016/november/jiaxing-factory-grand-opening/>
. The plant is expected to produce between 70% and 80% of all Lego products 
sold in the region.

Knudstorp will also become chairman of Lego’s board in May 2017.
