The remake takes the hugely-successful 1991 cartoon as its starting point; 
that made $375m worldwide. Disney’s remake of The Jungle Book from earlier this 
year is edging towards the $1bn mark; similar treatments for Cinderella and 
Maleficent were also successes.

In the works are live-action remakes of Dumbo, Sword in the Stone, Aladdin, 
Mulan, Pinocchio, Snow White, and two of The Little Mermaid.
