The leaders’ debate reminded me of the fruit and veg mongers of my youth who 
with bluster and bluff tried to convince weary shoppers that their spuds or 
apples were the best at market.

Ed Miliband <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband> seemed the most 
prime ministerial and confident when it came to defending affordable healthcare 
and creating proper jobs, not just zero-hours contracts.

David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> wasn’t on 
top form. He looked as tired as a used-car salesman, especially when he tried 
to dismiss the economic stress corporate tax avoidance has caused Britain.

Nigel Farage did a second rate panto of a modern day Enoch Powell when he 
suggested that that there were thousands of people infected with HIV flooding 
Britain for free NHS care. Clegg was just glib and irrelevant, acting as if 
he’d been in opposition for the last five years rather than in government.
Natalie Bennett <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/natalie-bennett> tried to 
present herself as the most caring leader but was drowned out by both Leanne 
Wood and Nicola Sturgeon’s message of compassion during times of austerity.

More heat than light as the result of a format that forced superficiality on 
the – I want to say contestants – participants. But two hours is a long time to 
fake it and there were snapshot moments of exposure that let a chink of light 
in. Not enough to change my views, though.

Nicola Sturgeon <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> was no 
surprise to us Scots. We know she’s a passionate fighter, but she showed the 
rest of the UK that she can go head to head with the big dogs. Amazing that the 
leader of a party most people can’t vote for should do so well nationally.

Farage revealed his hypocrisy – he is one of the rich public schoolboys he 
castigated – and his nastiness. Cameron had his prepackaged soundbites but 
showed he was fast on his feet, taking on the heckler. And Miliband kept saying 
“If I’m prime minister,” as if trying to convince himself as much as us.

Poor old Nick Clegg <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg> knows 
it’s all over but he hopes a mixture of sackcloth and ashes and disowning his 
past will save him. Wrong.

And Natalie Bennett? Nice woman, but she can afford to be. We’ll never find 
out how she’d pay for her pipe dreams.

I expected chaos with so many participants but it was refreshing to hear other 
voices – many of which advocated progressive opinions rarely reflected in 
mainstream politics.

For me the winner was Nicola Sturgeon. Cool, calm and collected, she was 
unequivocal in opposing austerity, privatisation in the NHS, the scapegoating 
of immigrants, nuclear weapons and tuition fees, and all with the creditability 
of SNP having delivered progressive policies in Scotland. For the growing 
numbers of voters disillusioned by Westminster politics, the prospect of an SNP 
bloc in parliament providing a pressure from the left onLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is an attractive one.

You can see why Cameron didn’t want to do the debates. He was surprisingly 
wooden, and looked dazed when Miliband landed some good punches over his 
failures in Europe. Overall a poor night for him and a solid if not inspiring 
one from Miliband, who was strong on bankers’ bonuses, mansion tax, tuition 
fees, fairer taxation and came across as honest when he said Labour governments 
got it wrong on banker regulation.

The other highlight was the dismal performance of Nigel Farage. The dressing 
down he got from Leanne Wood for seeking to scapegoat immigrants suffering with 
HIV for soaking up the NHS budget generated one of the few spontaneous rounds 
of applause of the night. WhenGary Lineker calls you a dick on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/583719470322982912>, you know you’ve 
not had a good night.

 I was taken aback by David Cameron’s answer to the NHS question when he spoke 
quite like many parents I meet who bring their sick children to hospital. At 
that moment I believed him. On the issue of private finance initiative 
hospitals brought in under New Labour, Ed Miliband said they were preferable to 
the old buildings they replaced. This scheme has financially ruined many 
hospitals, leaving them to draw on finances normally reserved for staff and 
supplies to repay steep mortgages.

Nigel Farage’s comments on immigration made me gasp out loud. I was thinking 
about my Italian, Spanish, Polish, Philippine, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Indian, 
Afghanistani, Chinese, Pakistani and Nigerian colleagues – without whom it is 
impossible to do a day’s shift. And denying HIV treatment to anyone who arrives 
in our hospitals? Just try and make doctors do that.

For me the “winner” was, Nicola Sturgeon as she posed the questions that I 
wanted answers to. There is something about the SNP, and in particular 
Sturgeon, that makes politics interesting again. As Sturgeon said, it is time 
to break up the old boys’ network at Westminster.

Important as elections are, I cannot help seeing them as a combination of the 
World Cup and the Eurovision Song Contest for the media and political nerds. 
This debate is the group stage and like football or singing contests I can only 
bear to watch it quite drunk after coming home from a party. It didn’t help 
much. I felt I was being rinsed in reasonableness.

After the opening poems of spin, all the leaders seemed to take great pains 
holding their fear/anger/boredom in check ready for the cutaway shots of them 
looking thoughtful while someone else said something they would have to 
passionately disagree with in a minute.

The ideal way to watch any political broadcast is with the sound turned off. 
Miliband was the best at staring into the camera lens. Cameron did very good 
disdainful sort of “tut” motions as if his opponent was just not worth 
responding to. Nige pulled music hall faces. Clegg overdid the 
intensely-relaxed-with-nothing-to-lose look. Nicola Sturgeon was the jolliest 
and I look forward to her being deputy prime minister.

I was most impressed by Ed Miliband. What he had to say on the NHS really 
resonated with me. Miliband seems to understand the importance of this issue, 
and this concern feels as if it genuinely goes beyond his ambition to be prime 
minister. I found it really effective the way he looked into the eyes of the 
viewers.

I am a British Pakistani and didn’t like the comment Nigel Farage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> made about how the NHS 
needs to be there for British families only. I found that rude and 
disrespectful, and much preferred Sturgeon when she said doesn’t care if a 
person is a British citizen or not.

My verdict is that all of the leaders had a few good points but it was 
Miliband who really performed well and made the most of his opportunities to 
speak. I felt that many of his points were really targeted towards young people 
and he understands that our votes matter.

There was one clear winner and it was women: Bennett, Sturgeon and Wood all 
calmly holding their own in the face of Farage shouting over them with 
condescension at every turn.

Bennett illustrated well the impact of cuts to services with a parable of a 
children’s centre worker who once provided a service to the community, used to 
pay tax and had “a modest amount of income to spend”, but is now struggling on 
Job Seekers Allowance. With more than 600 Sure Start centres closing since the 
coalition government came to power, her words were not empty political 
rhetoric, but a hard reality for laid-off staff and the parents subsequently 
unable to find nursery provisions for their children.

Sturgeon reiterated that “austerity is pushing people into poverty” – a fact 
backed up by the steep rise in the number of people using food banks in the 
last five years, and repeated by Miliband, who reminded us that wages do not 
keep pace with rising living costs.

And as Leanne Wood <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/leanne-wood> said, 
Farage ought to be ashamed of himself.

People say they are disengaged with politics because they don’t get a sense of 
authenticity from the party leaders. I think everybody came across as 
reasonably human last night.

Miliband had a problem with where he thought the camera was, causing a bit of 
wide-eyed staring into my sitting room. But apart from that he did well. If I 
had voted for Clegg last time, nothing I saw in the debate would have stopped 
me from voting for him again. As far as Cameron is concerned, he felt a bit 
like the best behaved one in a family who gets ignored.

Nigel Farage’s comments on needing to build a house every seven minutes 
sounded about right. I think one of the most unfortunate things about the 
current immigration debate is Farage. He stops the rest of the candidates and 
country from having an intelligent discussion about immigration. And it is 
something that impacts on housing. There are all sorts of thing we could do to 
help solve the housing crisis and I don’t understand why it hasn’t come up more 
so far in the campaign.

I’m not a supporter of Natalie Bennett and the Green party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/green-party> because so many of their 
ideas aren’t workable. But I found her impressive and passionate. Sturgeon and 
Wood were much more dogmatic and by the end I was worried about what the SNP 
would do in a coalition. Out of the three smaller parties, Bennett is the one I 
would vote for – if I were chucking away my vote.
