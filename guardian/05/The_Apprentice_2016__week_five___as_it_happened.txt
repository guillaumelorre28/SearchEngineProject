Not a vintage episode, but certainly a pleasant diversion from the fact that 
we could be watching the next episode under the rule of a former Apprentice 
boss. We could ALL be working for Sir Alan come next Thursday. Which is why I 
won’t be here again because I will be crying into a hamburger and bourbon 
smoothie.

No, but seriously, come back next week. Let’s stick together in these trying 
times and I’ll see you in two weeks.

JD gives it the full back-0f-taxi, he doesn’t know what he’s missing speech 
but he holds it together while the others mutter about the heat being on and 
how they’ll smash it next time because they are not, in any way, real people.

I think you have to view this show as graphic novel or a cartoon. Makes it 
much easier to get through I find. That, and biscuits.

Rebecca lives to fight another (probably one more) episode. Will she be made 
PM next time? And will any of the boys notice?

He won’t cut Paul. He just won’t. Unless Paul’s business idea is dross which 
is always the problem with the re-jigged format.

And JD is fired! I will have to eat that biscuit. DAMN.

Are you frowing in the towel, asks Alan to JD. Is he frowing in the towel? And 
if he is, what does it mean? Sitting on the front row at a fashion show, 
wearing only a towel? Let’s all picture that.

“If that’s what you call going viral, I think the virus must have been

Collect you light up loose woman at the end of the episode.

Not a vintage episode, but certainly a pleasant diversion from the fact that 
we could be watching the next episode under the rule of a former Apprentice 
boss. We could ALL be working for Sir Alan come next Thursday. Which is why I 
won’t be here again because I will be crying into a hamburger and bourbon 
smoothie.

No, but seriously, come back next week. Let’s stick together in these trying 
times and I’ll see you in two weeks.
 
JD gives it the full back-0f-taxi, he doesn’t know what he’s missing speech 
but he holds it together while the others mutter about the heat being on and 
how they’ll smash it next time because they are not, in any way, real people.

I think you have to view this show as graphic novel or a cartoon. Makes it 
much easier to get through I find. That, and biscuits.
 
Rebecca lives to fight another (probably one more) episode. Will she be made 
PM next time? And will any of the boys notice?
 
He won’t cut Paul. He just won’t. Unless Paul’s business idea is dross which 
is always the problem with the re-jigged format.

And JD is fired! I will have to eat that biscuit. DAMN.
 
“I’m not here to massage egos or modley-coddle,” says Paul when he’s accused 
of being a shouty mc shout face. Rebecca says she prefers a quieter approach 
and would like to prove it by being project manager. She’s so going.
 
Are you frowing in the towel, asks Alan to JD. Is he frowing in the towel? And 
if he is, what does it mean? Sitting on the front row at a fashion show, 
wearing only a towel? Let’s all picture that.
 
“I shouldn’t be here,” says Paul who goes onto admit he’s had “blow-ups”. You 
can get tablets for that over the counter. No prescription required.
 
“If that’s what you call going viral, I think the virus must have been 
sleeping sickness.” And that’s Alan’s Zinger for this week. Who has 9.52pm? 
Collect you light up loose woman at the end of the episode.
