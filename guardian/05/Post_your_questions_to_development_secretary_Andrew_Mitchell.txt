The British international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-mitchell>, will be live online on 
the Poverty Matters blog this afternoon to answer your questions about 
development.

Next week Mitchell and the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, will head to New 
York to attend aUN summit <http://www.un.org/en/mdg/summit2010/> where leaders 
will assess progress and discuss future strategy to meet the millennium 
development goals (MDG) by 2015.Yesterday in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2010/sep/14/nick-clegg-global-poverty-fight>
, Clegg announced that the UK would reorientate its aid programme toprioritise 
women in developing countries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/sep/14/nick-clegg-coalition-maternal-deaths>
 and will be encouraging UN members to follow suit next week.

The British government has already ring-fenced its development budget and has 
vowed to increase aid spending to 0.7% of GDP by 2013. It's also spoken of the 
need for greater transparency in how it spends taxpayers' money.

So far so good? Or is the government off-track in its thinking?

Mitchell will be live online between 5.45pm and 6.30pm today. Post your
