We've waited more than three years since it first aired in the US – but 
tonight Parks and Recreation, the warm-hearted sitcom starring Saturday Night 
Live alumna Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, a small-town local government employee
finally hits British screens 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/nov/22/parks-and-recreation-bbc4>
. The fifth season of theEmmy-award winning show 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdxkdQ-gmaw>, which comes from team also behind 
The Office: An American Workplace, is currently airing in the US – how did it 
take this long to find a British broadcaster? – but BBC4 viewers have the joy 
of the first two seasons to look forward to. And to get you in the mood, here's 
our guide to the characters who make up the local council department in Pawnee 
ahead of tonight's first episode (10pm, BBC4).

Deputy parks director of Pawnee, a small town in Indiana, Leslie Knope is a 
tenacious and diligent character obsessed with council work, bureaucracy and 
becoming the first female president of America. But while her heroes include 
Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, Leslie lives in the shadow of her mother, 
retired local politician Marlene.

The first series sees Leslie battle to get her ideas across in a town not 
known for its progressive views on equality, while also harbouring romantic 
feelings for her co-worker Mark Brendanawicz. Her love of whipped cream is 
legendary and she can often be found enjoying the treat on waffles.

After a romantic liaison eight years ago, Leslie lives in the hope that one 
day Mark will come back to her. Which would be fine if Mark wasn't one of 
Pawnee's best-known womanisers, who thinks nothing of flirting with Leslie's 
friends and seducing her rivals.

The most masculine man in Pawnee, parks director Ron Swanson has an iconic 
moustache <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFWeoxrhbE8> and a deep-seated hatred 
of big government. He does not believe Pawnee should build parks at all and 
despises bureaucracy in all forms. But he does have a great respect for his 
deputy Leslie and also listsmeat <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOF6Jc-dSxc>, 
liquor and woodwork among his interests. Ron also has a secret identity and 
plays saxophone in local jazz clubs under the name of Duke Silver. His two 
ex-wives are both called Tammy – as is his mother.

The anti-Leslie Knope, April is the office intern with a dry wit and 
impressive lack of enthusiasm for everyone and everything. Superbly played by 
Aubrey Plaza, Ludgate's eyeroll of disdain brings much-needed archness to the 
cosy world of Pawnee. She claims she ended up with the internship at theParks 
and Recreation <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation> 
department because she over-slept and it was all the college had left to give 
her.

In his head, Tom Haverford is Kanye West and Tom Ford rolled into one. In 
reality he is a wannabe ladies man who is invisible to the female population of 
Pawnee. Tom is not against sucking up in order to further his career and often 
deliberately loses in games of online scrabble with Ron Swanson to get on his 
good side. Deeply in awe of Mark Brendanawicz and his lifestyle.

The only non-council worker in the series, Ann turns to Leslie for help in 
filling the huge pit outside her home. The hole in the ground has become such a 
health-hazard that her boyfriend Andy accidentally fell in and broke both his 
legs. He, meanwhile, has been taking full advantage of the situation – making 
put-upon Ann cater to his every need while he watches TV all day.
