Workers at JCB’s world headquarters in Staffordshire were stunned on Thursday 
when a mini tornado caused a wall to collapse and windows to crash to the 
ground.

Production of diggers stopped after the tornado tore into the side of the 
factory. No one was injured in the incident and the factory was back up and 
running after 30 minutes. The damaged areas have been cordoned off.

JCB’s assembly manager, Richard Williams, said: “I was about 30 yards away at 
the time and I heard an enormous crash. I turned around and saw the wall and 
the windows had come out and a big whirlwind of leaves and branches blowing 
around outside. Luckily no one was in the vicinity at the time.”

A JCB <https://www.theguardian.com/business/jcb> spokesman said: “Shortly 
after midday the skies blackened and powerful winds moved in, whipping up big 
waves on the lake at the front of the factory. Employees who have been here for 
decades said they had never seen anything like it.”
