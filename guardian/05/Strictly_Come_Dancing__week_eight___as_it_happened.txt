Their final dance is to Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time”, and Daisy takes 
the opportunity to wrap her endless legs around Aljaz one last time. And who 
can blame her?

So that’s it for Strictly Week 8 – I’ll be back for next week’s fun-packed 
jaunt to the Tower Ballroom, complete with a Booze-filled Bumper Blackpool 
Bingo. Since it’s a Seaside Special, feel free to make your suggestions in the 
comment box below, and I’ll pick my favourite five. Thank you everyone for 
joining in – have a wonderful week and I’ll see you next Saturday! Hx

So what will the judges do? Craig saves Greg and Natalie, for totally nailing 
the dance this time round. Darcey saves them too, but Bruno saves Daisy and 
Aljaz! Ooh, TENSION.

So it’s down to Len, and he chooses brain over heart and saves GREG AND 
NATALIE! Goodness, that was close.

So DAISY AND ALJAZ are going home tonight, and take the opportunity to say 
lovely things about each other.

Ah Daisy, you’ve been delightful. But in a year packed with big personalities, 
being perfectly charming and nice and wasn’t going to cut it I’m afraid. Such 
is the way of Strictly.

Greg, meanwhile, is Paso-ing like his life depends on it. He knows he’s on the 
ropes, and isn’t going down without a fight. But has Greg done enough?? I 
really hope so.

So, Daisy and Aljaz’s Salsa once again. Daisy has incredible legs, but this is 
still a bit like she’s sober in a nightclub and kind of wishing she’d gone home 
two hours ago. We’ve all been there.

I fear this might be the week we say goodbye to Greg and Natalie, which I’m 
quite sad about. But not nearly as sad as I am about the return of the comedy 
VTs; the respite was clearly brief.

So who is joining Daisy and Aljaz in the Dance Off? Ed and Katya are off to 
Blackpool (YAAAAAAAAS), along with Louise and Kevin and Judge Rinder and Oksana!

Which means GREG AND NATALIE in the bottom two! Oooh, this could definitely go 
either way.

Lovely to see Brendan and Natalie doing some proper dancing – I’ve seen enough 
barefoot contempo-wafting this year to last a lifetime.

Meanwhile, the cut of those strapless ballgowns mean the cellists look naked, 
which is unfortunate. Or, you know, Hallelujah.

Ah, I love the Poppy Appeal kick-off in Covent Garden. My RAF sister was there 
last year, but she did Paddington Station this year.

Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Andre Rieu and his Amazing 
Technicolour Orchestra singing Hallelujah, aka the only Leonard Cohen song 
everyone knows.

Also 


Salmon are pink. Darcey is more of a trout. 

This is going to be a very long night.

Last night on Strictly – a really good show, I thought. Highlights for me 
included the return of the mythical training VT (oh lord how we’ve missed you), 
Ed’s amazing Gangnam Salsa, from brilliant turns from the Dave Archer Singers, 
Claudia and AJ’s Viennese and Judge Rinder and Oksana’s Foxtrot.


Lowlights: Daisy and Aljaz’s Salsa (bad night to do a Salsa, Daijaz), Ore and 
Joanne’s frigid Rumba, and the absence of Chaz and Dave.

Their final dance is to Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time”, and Daisy takes 
the opportunity to wrap her endless legs around Aljaz one last time. And who 
can blame her?

So that’s it for Strictly Week 8 – I’ll be back for next week’s fun-packed 
jaunt to the Tower Ballroom, complete with a Booze-filled Bumper Blackpool 
Bingo. Since it’s a Seaside Special, feel free to make your suggestions in the 
comment box below, and I’ll pick my favourite five. Thank you everyone for 
joining in – have a wonderful week and I’ll see you next Saturday! Hx
 
So what will the judges do? Craig saves Greg and Natalie, for totally nailing 
the dance this time round. Darcey saves them too, but Bruno saves Daisy and 
Aljaz! Ooh, TENSION.

So it’s down to Len, and he chooses brain over heart and saves GREG AND 
NATALIE! Goodness, that was close.

So DAISY AND ALJAZ are going home tonight, and take the opportunity to say 
lovely things about each other.

Ah Daisy, you’ve been delightful. But in a year packed with big personalities, 
being perfectly charming and nice and wasn’t going to cut it I’m afraid. Such 
is the way of Strictly.
 
Greg, meanwhile, is Paso-ing like his life depends on it. He knows he’s on the 
ropes, and isn’t going down without a fight. But has Greg done enough?? I 
really hope so.
 
So, Daisy and Aljaz’s Salsa once again. Daisy has incredible legs, but this is 
still a bit like she’s sober in a nightclub and kind of wishing she’d gone home 
two hours ago. We’ve all been there.
 
I fear this might be the week we say goodbye to Greg and Natalie, which I’m 
quite sad about. But not nearly as sad as I am about the return of the comedy 
VTs; the respite was clearly brief.
 
I love you, Great British Public.
