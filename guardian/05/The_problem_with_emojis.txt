The best thing I’ve read all week is the Unicode Consortium’s Emojis and 
Dingbats FAQ <http://www.unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html>. The Consortium, 
a nonprofit organisation that counts most major software and hardware companies 
among its members, is responsible for developing Unicode, a way of encoding 
text so that it displays consistently across different platforms. (Except if 
you’re using Google’s Chrome browser, which clearly violates its “Don’t Be 
Evil” motto by displaying emoji either not at all or as sad little black line 
drawings –so change to Firefox or Safari if you want to laugh along.)

This means, among other things, that the Consortium is in charge of emojis. 
Every time you say ✈⛺🚲👰😷💊🏥😥 instead of “My wife and I have cut our 
adventure biking honeymoon short because she’s been admitted to hospital 
suffering from Ebola,” the selection of little cartoon pictures to which you’re 
limited is determined by the Consortium.

They’re almost like the Académie Française for your smartphone. They’re a 
major determinant of global communications, and their role in emoji regulation 
is a gobsmackingly 2014 state of affairs with which we’ll regale our baffled 
grandchildren while they change the water in our floating head tanks. “You 
think sexting is hard now,” we’ll croak. “Back in my day all we had was 
😘🍆👌🍑🌈.”


The FAQ reflects the Consortium’s new authoritative role in our lives. My 
favourite question is section 2.4, “What about diversity?”, to which the 
Consortium gives an answer involving possible use of theFitzpatrick scale 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale> to represent a range of skin 
tones. 😌🌀🚶🐾🚀! (“Ah, the inevitable march of progress!”) What a world we 
live in, where we get better responses to questions about racial representation 
from an international coterie of unelected code monkeys than from many 
institutions in politics or the media. It’s gratifying to see an organisation 
working within whatever limited remit it has to respond to these criticisms. It 
might even be, dare I say it, 👍.

I’m glad for this, and pleased in general that I can fill awkward silences in 
my text conversations with funny little pictures thatresemble nothing 
<http://thegardenparty.co.nz/images/uploads/371/2013-09-15_13.24.37__magnify.jpg>
 so much as a sheet of stick-on earrings.


But, like the other 1.75bn smartphone users on the planet, I have a 
disproportionate litany of complaints to make about the current emoji selection.

My suspicion is that if you asked each of those 1.75bn people what pisses them 
off most about emojis, the answers would form a beautiful rainbow of individual 
grievances. Emojis certainly facilitates communication between people who speak 
different languages, but its users also form a global network of frustration. 
😓📱💪🔨💥 is a regular emotion we experience when the task of selecting 
pictures, which is something we’ve likely chosen to do because we figured it 
would be quicker than typing, ends up taking longer than if we’d written it out 
in the first place.

Some people hate the lack of a face rolling its eyes, and considering how 
crucial mutual contempt is in maintaining social bonds that’s not surprising. 
There’s no vomiting emoji, no option for cheese, and you’re out of luck if you 
want to shrug in a disappointed but resigned way – for that you’ve got to use 
old standby Shruggie, who is a complexconfiguration 
<http://www.theawl.com/2014/05/the-life-and-times-of-> of English and Japanese 
characters ¯_(ツ)/¯ [ツ_¯]. Others lament the impossibility of conveying adult 
concepts in a way that doesn’t make you feel like you’re acting out a drug deal 
with finger puppets. 🕙💰🍀🚬 😎🍔 📺? Sorry, what? You want to rob an Irish 
bank at 10pm and use the proceeds to become a cigarette-smuggling television 
burger chef?

The real sticking point for me is the engagement ring emoji, which I believe 
is proof the Unicode Consortium is part of a shameful plot to destroy the 
institution of marriage. For what reason does this exist, if not as a trap to 
flush out people who would be stupid enough to propose over SMS? Using it 
probably sends out an ambulance to the recipient’s house, so paramedics can 
rush in and catch them before they hit their head on something after fainting 
from outrage and humiliation. The engagement ring emoji is a clear incitement 
to interpersonal malfeasance, and should be excluded from future releases for 
the maintenance of public virtue.

But my anger over this is mitigated by 💩, the pile of poop emoji, a cult 
favourite that extends and enriches our ability to provide solidarity in trying 
times. It’s hard to express genuine empathy in text without becoming awkward or 
verbose, but 💩, the little poop guy, maybe a handful of him, strikes the 
perfect balance between acknowledgement and sorrow while also being a bit 
¯_(ツ)_/¯: a smiling turd is inherently preposterous, but there he is on the 
screen trying to cheer you up anyway. Sending the grinning shitpile is a way of 
indicating that you, too, are emotionally affected by the fundamental absurdity 
of human existence. Sorry you lost your job because your manager embezzled 
thousands of dollars to spend on dog clothes! 💩💩💩💩💩!

But in absurdity lies the tense charm of all emoji: it is bizarre that, at 
this stage in human lexicographical development, we’ve resurrected the 
pictogram for everyday use. And it’s very bizarre that our use is limited by 
the proprietary concerns of the people who make our pocket space computers. 
Because don’t forget: emojis, at least the sets most of us are familiar with,
