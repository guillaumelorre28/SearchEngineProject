Afternoon summary

 * Theresa May will not hold the final vote on airport expansion for more than 
a year to allow for public debate, with cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson 
and Justine Greening allowed to express opposition if Heathrow is the chosen 
option. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/airport-expansion-vote-put-on-hold-for-more-than-a-year-by-theresa-may>
AsRowena Mason reports, the prime minister wrote to cabinet colleagues on 
Tuesday saying the government’s decision on whether to back airport expansion 
at Heathrow or Gatwick would be taken by a cabinet committee before the end of 
the month. She said any cabinet minister with longstanding opposition to the 
chosen optionwill be permitted to dissent publicly on behalf of their 
constituents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week>
, without campaigning against the government or speaking against it in 
parliament. At Westminster MPs were expecting the key vote on airport expansion 
to come this autumn, and the news has prompted speculation about why May 
appears to have postponed the Commons decision. One theory is that she wants to 
avoid Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP, resigning and triggering a byelection 
in Richmond Park, as he has threatened to do if Heathrow goes ahead. Today the 
Evening Standard reports thatlocal Conservatives would back Goldsmith, 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/tories-in-revolt-over-heathrow-a3372236.html>
 as would Tania Mathias, the Tory MP for the neighbouring constituency, 
Twickenham. 
 * The Treasury has cancelled plans to let people sell their pension annuities.
 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cancels-plans-to-create-a-market-for-secondary-annuities>
 * A member of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse panel has said 
she went to the Home Office with concerns about the then chair, Dame Lowell 
Goddard, in April, months before the Home Office said it was aware of the 
reservations surrounding her. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/child-abuse-inquiry-insider-told-home-office-lowell-goddard-concerns-april>
 * Parliament is “very likely” to be asked to ratify any future treaty 
agreement with the European Union, the high court has been told by lawyers for 
the government. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/parliament-very-likely-to-be-asked-to-agree-brexit-deal>
As Owen Bowcott reports, the suggestion that MPs might ultimately be able to 
exert some control over the final Brexit settlement prompted the pound to surge 
immediately against the dollar in exchange markets. Details of parliament’s 
potential role emerged during the third day of a legal challenge over whether 
ministers or MPs have the power to give formal notification to Brussels that 
Britain is withdrawing under article 50 of the treaty on theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. 
 * The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that 11.5m families set to lose 
an extra £100 a year from the government’s benefits freeze because of 
post-Brexit inflation.(See 1.19pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/18/hague-calls-for-bank-of-england-and-other-central-banks-to-raise-interest-rates-or-lose-independence-politics-live?page=with:block-580606dde4b055209adaebfa#block-580606dde4b055209adaebfa>
 * The Treasury blocked other government departments from charging diesel cars 
to enter towns and cities blighted by air pollution, documents revealed during 
a high court hearing on Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/treasury-blocked-moves-to-charge-diesel-cars-to-enter-polluted-uk-cities>
. 
 * One of the MPs behind a damning report on Sir Philip Green’s handling of 
BHS has dismissed criticism of their work by the peer’s lawyers as an attempt 
to “wiggle off the hook for his responsibilities”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-criticises-mps-report-bhs-collapse>
 * The former foreign secretary William Hague has warned the Bank of England 
that public anger about the impact on savers of low interest rates is rising 
and could lead to a revolt that threatens its independence. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/william-hague-interest-rates-savers-revolt-bank-england>
 * Jeremy Corbyn has announced more appointments to his frontbench team nearly 
two weeks after starting the reshuffle. As the Press Association reports, Andy 
Slaughter and Steve Reed, who were among the 63 shadow ministers who walked out 
in June, have agreed to serve the Labour leader. Slaughter becomes shadow 
minister for housing and London while Reed becomes shadow civil society 
minister. Serving under chief whip Nick Brown to enforce party discipline are 
Thangam Debbonaire, Nick Smith, Chris Elmore, Karl Turner, Alan Campbell, Mark 
Tami, Jessica Morden, Judith Cummins, Vicky Foxcroft, Jeff Smith and Nic Dakin.
Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner is given additional 
responsibility for international climate change and Bill Esterson, shadow 
minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, also takes on the 
international trade brief. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Treasury abandons plan to let people sell their pension annuities

The government has made a second big announcement this afternoon. A key 
element of the coalition’s pension reforms has been abandoned, the Press 
Association reports.

Plans to allow people to be able to sell on their retirement annuities on have 
been scrapped by the government because consumers could not be guaranteed that 
they would get good value for money.

Due to be launched in April 2017, the planned changes would have freed up 
people to sell their annuity income if they want to, without tax restrictions 
that currently apply, as long as their annuity provider agreed.

But the Treasury said that after speaking to the industry, regulators and 
consumer groups, it had decided not to take forward the plans - saying it was 
not willing to allow a market to develop which could produce poor outcomes for 
consumers, such as receiving poor value for their annuity income and suffering 
higher costs.

Here is some more Twitter comment on the airports expansion letter released by 
Number 10.

From the Telegraph’s James Kirkup
James Kirkup (@jameskirkup) 
So Boris, Justine etc can speak vs Heathrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/heathrow> expansion but still banned from 
"actively campaigning" against; and can't speak in HoC. Huh?

<https://twitter.com/jameskirkup/status/788405882560405505> 
From the Independent’s John Rentoul
John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) 
Observations: 1. "Official Sensitive" means "on Twitter". 2. Option of "no 
expansion" ruled out. 3. Heathrow 3rd runway will never be built.

Not right to say that the Heathrow decision delayed by a year - National 
Policy Statement was always going to take a year...

Key airport expansion vote to be put off for at least another year, says No 10

Turning away from the child abuse inquiry hearing, my colleague Rowena Mason 
has just come back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Amazingly, it turns out 
that the finalHeathrow <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/heathrow> vote will 
not take place for at least another year.

Q: It has been reported that Liz Sanderson, a special adviser to Theresa May 
when she was home secretary, knew about concerns about Goddard well before she 
resigned.

Sedwill says that the same report says he was told about these concerns. But 
he was not, he says. The report was wrong.

David Winnick, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, 
goes next.

Q: Should we be satisfied with what Amber Rudd told us in September about why 
Goddard resigned?

Sedwill says Winnick asked Rudd about this in the Commons on Monday. Rudd said 
she was giving Goddard’s own reason for going. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/17/brexit-cabinet-infighting-is-just-lively-debate-says-hunt-politics-live?page=with:block-5804ed5fe4b055209adae75d#block-5804ed5fe4b055209adae75d>

Given Goddard rejects the allegations, we can only go on her own explanation 
when wanting to know why she resigned.

Q: When were your first made aware of the allegations of racism against 
Goddard?

Sedwill says he heard some of these allegations for the first time when he 
read them in the Times last week.

Q: What about the racism allegations?

Sedwill says he had not heard about those, formally or informally, before they 
were in the papers. The complaints he had heard about Goddard had been 
expressed in general terms.

He stresses that Goddard denies these allegations fiercely.

Q: Are you satisfied that Goddard was vetted properly?

Yes, says Sedwill. She went through a proper vetting process. The Home Office 
took references from the New Zealand judiciary. He points out that the home 
affairs committee also took evidence from her.

Q: Did you report to Theresa May on the meeting Drusilla Sharpling had with a 
Home Office director general in April?

Sedwill says he did not, because he was not aware of that. He says the point 
of that meeting was to provide an early warning that things were off track. But 
Sharpling said at the time that she wanted no action taken.

Q: But why wasn’t that reported upwards?

Sedwill says the information was provided in confidence. At that point the 
panel did not want any action taken. They were trying to resolve the problems.

Q: Was that a reasonable judgement?

Sedwill says that was a reasonable decision for the Home Office director 
general to take at the time.

Q: Did you have regular discussions with the home secretary about the child 
abuse inquiry?

Sedwill says he had weekly bilateral meetings with Theresa May, when she was 
home secretary, as he does with Amber Rudd. They discussed child abuse and 
other issues. But he does not recall specifically discussing how the inquiry 
was going.

Q: John O’Brien, secretary to the inquiry, said it was separated from the Home 
Office by a “low brick wall”. What did you mean that?

Sedwill says Tim Loughton would have to ask O’Brien. He says as far as he was 
concerned, the Home Office had an arm’s length relationship with it.

Until 29 July, that is correct, says Sedwill.

He says Tim Loughton raised the prospect in an interview at the weekend that 
the Home Office might have picked up on these concerns unofficially.

But that was not the case, he says. It would have been wrong for the Home 
Office to have used back channels to find out what was happening in the 
inquiry, he says.

He says MPs would have objected if the Home Office had been monitoring the 
inquiry unofficially.

Mark Sedwill, Home Office permanent secretary, questioned by committee

Mark Sedwill, the Home Office permanent secretary, is giving evidence now.

Q: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, told us in September that Dame Lowell 
Goddard resigned because she was lonely. Why did Rudd not mention all the 
complaints about Goddard that led up to this.

Sedwill says that Rudd could only go on what Goddard said in her resignation 
letter.

Q: We have been told this afternoon that concerns were raised about Goddard in 
April?

Sedwill says he was not aware of that meeting. He only became aware of that 
recently. The meeting was with a Home Office director general who did not pass 
that information on, in accordance with the terms agreed at the time.

 * Theresa May will not hold the final vote on airport expansion for more than 
a year to allow for public debate, with cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson 
and Justine Greening allowed to express opposition if Heathrow is the chosen 
option. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/airport-expansion-vote-put-on-hold-for-more-than-a-year-by-theresa-may>
AsRowena Mason reports, the prime minister wrote to cabinet colleagues on 
Tuesday saying the government’s decision on whether to back airport expansion 
at Heathrow or Gatwick would be taken by a cabinet committee before the end of 
the month. She said any cabinet minister with longstanding opposition to the 
chosen optionwill be permitted to dissent publicly on behalf of their 
constituents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week>
, without campaigning against the government or speaking against it in 
parliament. At Westminster MPs were expecting the key vote on airport expansion 
to come this autumn, and the news has prompted speculation about why May 
appears to have postponed the Commons decision. One theory is that she wants to 
avoid Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP, resigning and triggering a byelection 
in Richmond Park, as he has threatened to do if Heathrow goes ahead. Today the 
Evening Standard reports thatlocal Conservatives would back Goldsmith, 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/tories-in-revolt-over-heathrow-a3372236.html>
 as would Tania Mathias, the Tory MP for the neighbouring constituency, 
Twickenham. 
 * The Treasury has cancelled plans to let people sell their pension annuities.
 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cancels-plans-to-create-a-market-for-secondary-annuities>
 * A member of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse panel has said 
she went to the Home Office with concerns about the then chair, Dame Lowell 
Goddard, in April, months before the Home Office said it was aware of the 
reservations surrounding her.

the government.

As Owen Bowcott reports, the suggestion that MPs might ultimately be able to 
exert some control over the final Brexit settlement prompted the pound to surge 
immediately against the dollar in exchange markets. Details of parliament’s 
potential role emerged during the third day of a legal challenge over whether 
ministers or MPs have the power to give formal notification to Brussels that 
Britain is withdrawing under article 50 of the treaty on theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

BHS has dismissed criticism of their work by the peer’s lawyers as an attempt 
to “wiggle off the hook for his responsibilities”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-criticises-mps-report-bhs-collapse>
 * The former foreign secretary William Hague has warned the Bank of England 
that public anger about the impact on savers of low interest rates is rising 
and could lead to a revolt that threatens its independence.

 * Jeremy Corbyn has announced more appointments to his frontbench team nearly 
two weeks after starting the reshuffle. As the Press Association reports, Andy 
Slaughter and Steve Reed, who were among the 63 shadow ministers who walked out 
in June, have agreed to serve the Labour leader. Slaughter becomes shadow 
minister for housing and London while Reed becomes shadow civil society 
minister. Serving under chief whip Nick Brown to enforce party discipline are 
Thangam Debbonaire, Nick Smith, Chris Elmore, Karl Turner, Alan Campbell, Mark 
Tami, Jessica Morden, Judith Cummins, Vicky Foxcroft, Jeff Smith and Nic Dakin.
Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner is given additional 
responsibility for international climate change and Bill Esterson, shadow 
minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, also takes on the 
international trade brief. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
The government has made a second big announcement this afternoon. A key 
element of the coalition’s pension reforms has been abandoned, the Press 
Association reports.

Plans to allow people to be able to sell on their retirement annuities on have 
been scrapped by the government because consumers could not be guaranteed that 
they would get good value for money.

Due to be launched in April 2017, the planned changes would have freed up 
people to sell their annuity income if they want to, without tax restrictions 
that currently apply, as long as their annuity provider agreed.

But the Treasury said that after speaking to the industry, regulators and 
consumer groups, it had decided not to take forward the plans - saying it was 
not willing to allow a market to develop which could produce poor outcomes for 
consumers, such as receiving poor value for their annuity income and suffering 
higher costs.
 
Here is some more Twitter comment on the airports expansion letter released by 
Number 10.

From the Telegraph’s James Kirkup

So Boris, Justine etc can speak vs Heathrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/heathrow> expansion but still banned from 
"actively campaigning" against; and can't speak in HoC. Huh?

Observations: 1. "Official Sensitive" means "on Twitter". 2. Option of "no 
expansion" ruled out. 3. Heathrow 3rd runway will never be built.

Winnick says that he thinks the committee has been treated in a “shabby way” 
and that it has been “misled”.
 
Q: It has been reported that Liz Sanderson, a special adviser to Theresa May 
when she was home secretary, knew about concerns about Goddard well before she 
resigned.

Sedwill says that the same report says he was told about these concerns. But 
he was not, he says. The report was wrong.
 
David Winnick, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, 
goes next.

Q: Should we be satisfied with what Amber Rudd told us in September about why 
Goddard resigned?

Sedwill says Winnick asked Rudd about this in the Commons on Monday. Rudd said 
she was giving Goddard’s own reason for going. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/17/brexit-cabinet-infighting-is-just-lively-debate-says-hunt-politics-live?page=with:block-5804ed5fe4b055209adae75d#block-5804ed5fe4b055209adae75d>

Given Goddard rejects the allegations, we can only go on her own explanation 
when wanting to know why she resigned.
 
Q: When were your first made aware of the allegations of racism against 
Goddard?

Sedwill says he heard some of these allegations for the first time when he 
read them in the Times last week.

Q: What about the racism allegations?

Sedwill says he had not heard about those, formally or informally, before they 
were in the papers. The complaints he had heard about Goddard had been 
expressed in general terms.

He stresses that Goddard denies these allegations fiercely.
 
Ranil Jayawardena, a Conservative, goes next.

Q: Are you satisfied that Goddard was vetted properly?

Yes, says Sedwill. She went through a proper vetting process. The Home Office 
took references from the New Zealand judiciary. He points out that the home 
affairs committee also took evidence from her.
 
Q: Did you report to Theresa May on the meeting Drusilla Sharpling had with a 
Home Office director general in April?

Sedwill says he did not, because he was not aware of that. He says the point 
of that meeting was to provide an early warning that things were off track. But 
Sharpling said at the time that she wanted no action taken.

Q: But why wasn’t that reported upwards?

Sedwill says the information was provided in confidence. At that point the 
panel did not want any action taken. They were trying to resolve the problems.

Q: Was that a reasonable judgement?

Sedwill says that was a reasonable decision for the Home Office director 
general to take at the time.

Q: Did you have regular discussions with the home secretary about the child 
abuse inquiry?

Sedwill says he had weekly bilateral meetings with Theresa May, when she was 
home secretary, as he does with Amber Rudd. They discussed child abuse and 
other issues. But he does not recall specifically discussing how the inquiry 
was going.
 
Q: John O’Brien, secretary to the inquiry, said it was separated from the Home 
Office by a “low brick wall”. What did you mean that?

Sedwill says Tim Loughton would have to ask O’Brien. He says as far as he was 
concerned, the Home Office had an arm’s length relationship with it.
 
Q: How many meetings did you have with Goddard?

Sedwill says he met her twice.
 
Q: Are you saying you were never told of any concerns about Goddard?

Until 29 July, that is correct, says Sedwill.

He says Tim Loughton raised the prospect in an interview at the weekend that 
the Home Office might have picked up on these concerns unofficially.

But that was not the case, he says. It would have been wrong for the Home 
Office to have used back channels to find out what was happening in the 
inquiry, he says.

He says MPs would have objected if the Home Office had been monitoring the 
inquiry unofficially.
