Al-Jazeera <https://www.theguardian.com/media/al-jazeera> Media Network is 
preparing to make its English language international news channel video content 
digitally available to US viewers again, according to an email sent to 
employees.


 The move comes almost three months after it shut down its US cable television 
network, al-Jazeera America, citing economic challenges in the US media market.

 Al-Jazeera English reaches more than 305 million households in over 160 
countries. But US viewers could not access its live stream coverage.

 Al-Jazeera English is in talks with cable carriers that carried the now 
defunct al-Jazeera America to make its live video stream available in the US 
starting in September, according to the email from Giles Trendle, acting 
managing director of al-Jazeera English and director of programs.

 “I am pleased to be able to say that, all going well, AJE will available in 
the USA, across digital platforms, in September,” an email obtained by Reuters 
stated. “The exact date will be fixed once we get the green light from our 
Legal team, who have been concluding deals with the cable carriers of AJAM.”

 The memo did not specify which cable carriers.

 “We won’t comment on internal memos that are informal and not definitive,” 
said Hasan Salim Patel, a spokesman for al-Jazeera Media Network.

 Qatar-based al-Jazeera Media Network shut down al-Jazeera America on 30 
April, three years after its high profile launch. At the time, the company said 
it would expand its international digital service in the US as more consumers 
use their mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets for news.
