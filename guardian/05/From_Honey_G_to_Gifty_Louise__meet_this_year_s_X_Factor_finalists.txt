The X Factor <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-x-factor> live 
shows begin this weekend, with 12 acts left in the running to become the next 
big singing sensation. Only one of them can make it, against all odds, in the 
face of fierce competition and greatly enhanced media scrutiny.

The only problem is that I don’t know who any of them are.

I haven’t been watching X Factor this year. I watched 15 minutes of one 
episode a fortnight ago by accident, but that’s it. Which is obviously great 
for me, because having liveblogged my way through all the previous series, I 
feel like a newly escaped hostage. However, I’ve still managed to retain enough 
residual X Factor knowledge to know exactly where each of the finalists will 
come based purely on their publicity photographs. Witness my eerie skills of 
prediction, then applaud accordingly.

Last place: Saara Aalto

 Not kooky enough? Saara Aalto. Photograph: Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
Poor Saara Aalto. The woman is basically a walking litany of everything X 
Factor viewers dislike. She’s kooky, but not kooky enough to qualify as a 
Genuine Eccentric. She’s too old (at least by X Factor’s relentlessly 
youth-fixated worldview) to pass as eye candy. Her name is very slightly 
unconventional. Alas Saara, we’ll barely get to know you.

 Dressed by someone’s aunt? Ryan Lawrie. Photograph: Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
Adhering to the purview that every young male X Factor finalist has to look 
like the cover star of a fictional teen magazine called No Genitals, here’s 
Ryan Lawrie. His hair is floppy, his smile is wet, he looks like he has been 
dressed by someone’s aunt and I’d imagine that he has a voice like a gnat 
peeing into a hurricane. This competition will not be kind to him.

 Weirdly specific time of day: 5 After Midnight. Photograph: 
Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
The X Factor producers cannot possibly allow a group such as 5 After Midnight 
to succeed, because it would inspire a rush of other groups named after weirdly 
specific times of day to enter X Factor. Imagine how miserable the 2017 series 
would be if everyone was called Twenty to Three or Two Thirteen AM. I predict 
that Louis Walsh will deliberately scupper their chances early on by forcing 
them to sing a reggae medley of Funky Town and My Boy Lollipop.

 Chorus singer at heart? Relley C. Photograph: Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
Themed episodes will be in full effect by week four. I predict that this is 
when Relley C, during a Tin-Foil Dance Music week rendition of Do It Loud by 
The Maniac Agenda, will give up halfway through and just go for a job as a 
chorus singer in The Lion King musical instead.

 Least annoying novelty act: Bratavio. Photograph: Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
With a name that sounds a bit like a lingerie company and a bit like an 
anonymous east European town, Bratavio were never destined to do very well. At 
this point in the series, Simon Cowell will start grumping on about the 
leftover novelty acts in the competition and Bratavio – as the least annoying 
novelty act in the finals – will be the first to succumb to his wrath.

 Looks like a Catherine Tate character: Honey G. Photograph:

It seems as if Honey G is this year’s joke entry. This might be because she 
looks like a Catherine Tate character called Harrowing Mum, or it could be 
because she sounds like she has been named after a low-value brand of throat 
disinfectant. Either way, unless she pulls a Rhydian and reveals at the last 
minute that she can sing like Harry Secombe, expect her novelty to burn out 
halfway through.

At this point, before the pressures of the live shows kick in, Sam Lavery

 The anonymous one: Matt Terry Photograph: Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
You know how, in every reality show, there’s a character so inherently 
anonymous that they make it to the latter stages of the competition purely 
because everyone watching had forgotten that they even existed? This is Matt 
Terry though and through. He is destined to be the pub-quiz question that 
nobody ever gets right.

 Looks like the most talented: Gifty Louise Photograph: Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
Gifty Louise looks like the most talented, contemporary and commercially 
viable artist in the final 12. She’ll have got this far with a sequence of 
breathtaking performances and endless hyperbolic feedback from the X Factor 
judges. The poor woman is doomed to finish second.

Winner: Emily Middlemass

 Reliable and smiles a lot: Emily Middlemass. Photograph: Burmiston/Syco/Thames 
Sure, she might not be the best, or the most original, performer on X Factor. 
But she’s reliable, and she smiles a lot, and she’ll look good crying during 
her second performance of the winner’s single. Congratulations Emily Middlemas! 
May the one album you release before you’re ignominiously dropped from your 
record label not be a miserable embarrassment.
