Leonardo DiCaprio <https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio> had a 
broad smile but few words for several hundred fans who braved near-freezing 
temperatures and rain outside a restaurant in central Edinburgh that helps the 
homeless.


DiCaprio, the Oscar-winning star of The Revenant and Titanic, arrived at Home 
for lunch on Thursday with a smitten fan, Elise Lovell, who had won a raffle to 
dine with him in aid of the Social Bite homeless charity, which set up the 
restaurant and runs a chain of sandwich shops that train and employ homeless 
staff.


Apparently on his first visit to Scotland, DiCaprio was in Edinburgh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/edinburgh> as guest speaker at the Scottish 
Business Awards on Thursday night, following previous US guests at the event 
such as Bill Clinton and George Clooney.

Part of his meal at Home was prepared by Biffy Mackay, a previously homeless 
trainee chef who said it was the most nerve-racking thing she had ever done. 
Her reward was a signed note from DiCaprio reading: “To Biffy, all the best.”

Mackay added: “I steamed his couscous. He’s having lamb tagine. I told him 
I’ve loved him since I was nine and that I did a project about him at school. 
He said, ‘That’s so cool.’”

Lovell said the actor was “absolutely charming”, before adding: “It was quite 
surreal but a fantastic couple of hours.” After she mentioned Donald Trump’s US 
election win, she said DiCaprio gave little away. He “kind of laughed and said 
it was definitely a shock to a lot of people”.
