A 48-year-old man has been arrested in Wrexham on suspicion of terrorism 
offences.


Police said the man, whom they did not identify, was held on Thursday on 
suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of 
acts of terrorism, under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

He was arrested as part of a joint operation between the Welsh extremism 
counter-terrorism unit, North Wales police and the West Midlands 
counter-terrorism unit.

A police spokesman said: “The man is being questioned at a police station in 
the West Midlands. The arrest was preplanned and intelligence-led. There was no 
threat to the public’s safety. An address in Wrexham is the subject of an 
ongoing search.”

Officers have 48 hours to question the suspect before charging or releasing 
him or applying for a warrant of further detention.
