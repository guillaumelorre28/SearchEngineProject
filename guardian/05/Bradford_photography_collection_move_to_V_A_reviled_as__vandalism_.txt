The decision to move a world-famous photography collection in Bradford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bradford> to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 
London has been condemned as “an appalling act of cultural vandalism”.

The move will see 400,000 objects from the Royal Photographic Society 
collection at Bradford’s National Media Museum transferred to London to create 
an“international photography resource centre”

The decision, lauded by both museums, has angered local politicians and art 
enthusiasts who described it as a paring down of Bradford’s resources “by 
stealth” and a step towards closing the National Media Museum.

Simon Cooke, the leader of the Conservatives on Bradford council, described 
the move as an “act of cultural rape on my city” and called for the deal to be 
reviewed.

He said: “I know London is a big, grand and fantastic city but to denude my 
city of these photographs reminds us that you – all the V&A’s trustees are 
based in London, many will never have visited Bradford – care not one jot for 
our heritage and history.

“I know you are incredibly excited by all this but, trust me, you could – had 
you had the guts and vision – have based this new resource centre in the north, 
in Bradford, where they would have been loved and cherished in a way you in 
London can never understand. We don’t have much up here and it fills me with a 
kind of sad rage that you felt able to visit this act of cultural rape on my 
city.

“I don’t expect anything to happen. You’ll make some sort of gesture, will 
utter a few banal platitudes and punch the air because the collection is where 
you and your pals can pop round, can show off to visiting dignitaries. A plague 
on you and your metropolitan cultural fascism.”

 The move has reignited fears over the long-term future of the National Media 
Museum, which sailed close to closure in 2013. Photograph: Alamy 
The collection, dating from 1827 to 2016, has been based in Bradford’s 
National Media Museum since 2003 
<http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/Collection/Photography/RoyalPhotographicSociety.aspx>
.

Among the treasures moving to the V&A are works by the British photography 
pioneersWilliam Henry Fox Talbot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2013/feb/11/william-henry-fox-talbot-photography>
, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and
Julia Margaret Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/22/julia-margaret-cameron-victorian-portrait-photographer-exhibitions>
, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography.


In a statement announcing the move, the Royal Photographic Society said it had 
serious reservations about moving the collection from a single national museum 
dedicated to the history of photography.

It said that while the move would prove beneficial in “opening up access to 
the RPS collection” the society “is concerned that the absence of a single 
institution with the curatorial expertise to collect and interpret all aspects 
of photography beyond its art will lead to a selective and narrow appreciation 
of photography that existed before the formation of the National Media Museum 
in 1983 when the V&A and Science Museum worked independently”.

Michael Pritchard, the director general of the Royal Photographic Society, 
said the move was disappointing but that there were serious practical 
considerations behind it. He said it would increase the collection’s 
accessibility “in both a geographical sense and through the resources that the 
V&A is able to bring ensure public and research access”.


Pritchard added: “The media museum has suffered declining staff and funding 
cuts over recent years which has impacted on public access to the collection, 
despite the very best efforts of the curatorial staff.”

Imran Hussain, the Labour MP for Bradford East, said the move smacked of 
“absolute metropolitanism” and that he would be writing to the culture minister 
to demand an explanation.

“It’s a real blow to Bradford,” he said. “We have just spent the last few 
years progressing in the right direction and now this. It’s going to have a 
major impact ... culturally and on education, because there’s children who will 
not get to see this collection.”

The decision is “in direct contravention” to the government’s northern 
powerhouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2015/may/14/george-osborne-northern-powerhouse-devolution-manchester>
rhetoric, he said, and had been made without the consultation of local MPs. 
“What are the reasons? Is it because it’s easier for various people to visit it 
in London? Is Bradford not good enough? It will mean that many people will not 
now come to Bradford.”

The move has reignited fears over the long-term future of the National Media 
Museum, whichsailed perilously close to closure in 2013 
<http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/local/localbrad/10472376.Film_legends_join_a_growing_chorus_against_National_Media_Museum_closure/>
.

Judith Cummins, the Bradford South MP, said: “It was just over three months 
ago that I received assurances from the government about keeping the museum 
here in Bradford and, importantly, keeping the entry free.

“Visitor numbers have been rising, so to learn an important collection – which 
is 10% of the collection as a whole – is to be shipped off to London starts 
alarm bells ringing.”

Colin Ford, the first director of the museum, added: “This looks as if it may 
be a step towards closing the museum. This doesn’t fit in any way with the 
government’s avowed intention to create a ‘northern powerhouse’. Quite the 
opposite. What we’ve found is that metropolitanism is triumphing again.”

Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, the portfolio holder for culture on Bradford 
council, said she “profoundly regrets” the loss of the collection.

But, she said, the government must bear responsibility for the cuts in funding 
to the National Media Museum. “Let’s not forget that the National Media Museum 
was under threat of closure not so long ago and while the council has provided 
financial support, the only support they’ve had from government has been a loan 
for the new Imax projector,” she said.

“We have a strong history of photography in the city and if there’s investment 
going into the V&A in London then why don’t we see the same investment 
opportunity in Bradford?

“It’s yet another example of the government not supporting investment in 
Bradford and shows up their much-vaunted northern powerhouse for what it is – 
empty rhetoric.”


A spokesman for the National Media Museum said: “We are not closing. Quite the 
contrary. We have ambitious plans for the future and strong support both within 
the Science Museum Group and among key local stakeholders such as the council.”


In 2013, the National Media Museum was said to contribute more than £24m a 
year to the Bradford economy in purchases made by museum visitors in local 
cafes and shops across the city. It provides about 100 jobs that add an extra 
£3.7m to the city’s economy.

Jo Quinton-Tulloch, director of the National Media Museum, said the move would 
sharpen the museum’s focus on science and technology 
<http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/14246347.National_Media_Museum_resets_its_focus_on_science_and_technology/>
 and add value to Bradford. The museum’s new focus is to be heralded by a new 
£1.5m interactive light and sound gallery, due to open in March 2017.

The culture secretary, John Whittingdale, warned on Monday of a “danger” of 
too much arts funding being focused on the capital 
<http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/whittingdale-backs-fairer-spread-of-arts-funding-1-7708965>
.

“I do think there is a danger that too much is spent in London and obviously 
what we want to do is demonstrate that the UK has fantastic cultural offerings 
right across the country and not just in London,” he said.

Whittingdale said culture and tourism had a “very significant” part to play in 
the government’s economic vision for the north of England.

The Yorkshire Post has previously revealed the huge geographic differences in 
funding from Arts Council England. Last year, Yorkshire received £11.46 per 
person compared to £33.77 in the capital.
