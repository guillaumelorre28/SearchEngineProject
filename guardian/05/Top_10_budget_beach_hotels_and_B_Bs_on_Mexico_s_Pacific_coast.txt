Mexico’s Pacific coast, more than 1,000 miles of it, is renowned for its 
beaches, as well as the resorts which have attracted Hollywood royalty. 
However, it’s also an area that can experience tropical storms, usually between 
June and December. The most recent wasHurricane Patricia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/hurricane-patricia-batters-mexico-with-165mph-winds-rain-and-storm-surges>
, the strongest hurricane ever recorded at sea, which swept across the region 
at the end of October, but caused less damage than anticipated. Hotels are now 
operating as normal.

1. Hotel Posada Freeman, Mazatlán, Sinaloa

This 12-storey hotel, built in 1944 on Old Mazatlán’s seafront (and not to be 
confused with the newer Posada Freeman Zona Dorado), hosted the likes of Rock 
Hudson and John Wayne while they shot westerns in Mexico. Its early 2000s 
restoration helped resuscitate the historic colonial centre, Mazatlán’s most 
alluring neighbourhood, and it’s just across the street from Olas Altas beach. 
It has bright, comfortable rooms with ocean views, a top-floor bar and an 
outdoor pool on the 11th floor. It’s not the cheapest Mazatlán has to offer, 
but it’s one of a very few beachfront lodgings outside the expensive and often 
insufferable Zona Dorada hotel zone at the north end of town.

San Blas is best known for its jungle cruise through the La Tovara estuary 
(and an optional visit to a crocodile nursery). On a tranquil back street one 
block from another estuary, Casa Roxana is a small compound of spacious white 
bungalows. Interiors are simple but spotless and comfy with two double beds, 
kitchenettes, air conditioning, a screened porch and reliable Wi-Fi. The 
surrounding gardens are lush and meticulously maintained and with a small pool. 
The estuary is a magnet for birders who delight in spotting both resident and 
migrant species.

On the Riviera Nayarit – the coastline north of Puerto Vallarta dotted by 
villages just awakening to tourism – Sayulita was discovered first and is well 
on its way to over-development. Travellers pressing north in search of 
unspoiled beaches will find the greatest selection of lodging in Guayabitos. 
This beachfront hotel goes for colonial arches (windows, doorways, corridors), 
carved wood and wrought iron in a big way; minimalists are advised to focus 
instead on the comfy, high-ceilinged rooms and abundant ocean views at a price 
rarely found on the beach. Guests do have to walk past the adjacent restaurant 
to reach the sand (the hotel’s own restaurant is on the street side), a 
hardship amply compensated for by the price.

4. Eloisa Hotel, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco

Ignore the blocky exterior; rooms at this stalwart in the old town, or 
Romantic Zone as it now brands itself, have some zip. Accented by warm colours 
and wooden furniture, the modest quarters are bright and inviting, and many 
have balconies with beautiful views. Stay away from the courtyard rooms, which 
are darker and can get musty in the tropical heat. The location is ideal, two 
blocks south of the Río Cuale and less than a block from Playa Olas Altas in a 
quiet cul-de-sac adjacent to the lovely Plaza Lázaro Cárdenas. There’s a cafe 
and bar, two outdoor pools and a rooftop deck with fine ocean, city and 
mountain panoramas.

5. Casa Bahia Bonita, Yelapa, Jalisco

Accessible only by water taxi and swathed in jungle at the southern end of 
Banderas Bay, Yelapa is usually a day trip visit from Puerto Vallarta (45 
minutes way). With no roads leading from the coastal highway through the 
jungle, it is removed from any motor vehicle traffic, providing a serene 
retreat where rooms command top dollar. Casa Bahia Bonita bucks that trend, the 
trade-off being lack of a pool and Wi-Fi (the town’s service doesn’t quite 
reach this end of the beach), and the need for substantial climbing to get 
here. But lazing on the huge patio overlooking the ocean, well away from other 
buildings, will make you forget those inconveniences. Higher-priced upper-level 
balcony rooms are bigger and have panoramic views. For stays of three weeks or 
more, see the discounted prepaid plans.

6. La Posada, Manzanillo, Colima

Excessive pink exterior aside, this small colonial-style inn, makes a 
supremely relaxing getaway. It commands a long ribbon of golden sand at the end 
of the Las Brisas peninsula, where Manzanillo is the only major destination on 
the sparsely travelled stretch of coast between Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco. 
Some of the big, airy rooms have air conditioning and balconies; all have 
exposed brick walls, tile floors, modest handmade furniture and Mexican rugs 
and blankets. Public spaces include a library, a restaurant and ocean-view bar. 
Guests can cool off in the freshwater pool or, a few steps away, in a bay 
teeming with tropical fish.

7. Hotel Palacios, Zihuatanejo, Guerrero

This family-friendly place overlooking the east end of Playa Madera was one of 
the original hotels in Zihuatanejo. It has few frills, but it doesn’t feel bare 
bones, either. Wood accents and traditional colours lend the white interior a 
distinctly Mexican flavour. Five of the 28 rooms face the ocean and have large 
terraces, as well as in-room refrigerators. The small pool is rarely used as 
guests more often opt for the beach, but the separate children’s pool is a 
bonus. The hotel restaurant is right on the beach, with the option of eating at 
a table set in the sand.

8. Hacienda Eden, Playa Troncones, Guerrero

The name is not an idle boast: commanding a spot in the middle of gorgeous 
Manzanillo Bay, 22 miles north of Zihuatanejo, Hacienda Eden’s 10 rooms and 
four bungalows fill primarily with repeat guests. Ocean-view rooms and terraces 
draped with hammocks occupy the two-storey main house, while four bungalows 
with private terraces open onto the ocean. All are venues for beamed ceilings, 
Talavera tile, wood trim and colourful accents. The restaurant is one of the 
best on the beach. The catch? It closes from 1 May to 1 Nov.

9. Cabañas Balamjuyuc, Mazunte, Oaxaca

The only fault of southern Oaxaca’s ethereally beautiful Bays of Huatulco is a 
dearth of affordable beach lodging. Fortunately, much of the coast to the north 
is also stunning, and much better served by budget digs. This eco-hostel, set 
in a tropical garden on a hill above Mazunte Beach’s west end – with stairs 
leading down to the sand – offers camping space and six cabanas of varying 
configurations, all with shared showers. The solar-powered property offers a 
traditionaltemescal (a version of ancient Mexico’s ceremonial sweat lodges), 
therapeutic massage and help with sifting through the many eco-tourism options.

10. Bahia de La Luna, Pochutla, Oaxaca

This is the embodiment of a tropical escape. These 12 rustic yet thoughtfully 
designed adobe cabanas are on a palmy beach cradled by rocky headlands two 
miles east of Puerto Angel and about 50 miles from Puerto Escondido. Some 
cabanas peek out from the forested hillside rising above La Boquilla beach, 
while others are set right on the sand. Except for two suites and a villa, all 
are one large room with a private bathroom, cooled by ocean breezes and ceiling 
fans. The hotel’s restaurant is worth savouring.
