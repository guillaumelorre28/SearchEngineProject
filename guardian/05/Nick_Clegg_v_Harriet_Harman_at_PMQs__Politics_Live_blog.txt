Afternoon summary

 * Lord Mandleson, the Labour former business secretary, has said mainstream 
parties must learn to fight back against the arguments being used by populist 
parties like Ukip. In a speech to the IPPR thinktank he said:

Arguments about identity are very emotional. Arguments about migrants are very 
emotional. But we have to argue back.

We have forgotten how to make a case. We have forgotten what the arguments are.

We have lost our confidence, lost our bullishness and ability to push back 
against that emotion with equally charged, emotional, passionate beliefs of our 
own. And until we rediscover that ability then we are not going to recover or 
recover very quickly.

 * Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former first minister, has used an interview with 
the Spectator to set out the SNP’s three ambitions in a hung parliament.He said 
they were: “pursuing the redemption of the vow in full terms, sticking up for 
Scottish causes, and pursuing progressive politics with allies on things like 
the living wage or international issues when we have got a lot to say.” He 
confirmed that the SNP would not do a deal with the Tories in a hung 
parliament. And he also defended Prince Charles’ right to send letters to 
ministers containing advice. He said: 
I don’t think I’ve met anyone with a greater love of Scotland than Prince 
Charles, or the Duke of Rothesay as we should call him. I know some newspapers 
get extremely upset and irritated by the messages he sends to ministers and I 
can confirm he does send messages to ministers. But I can also say I have never 
been upset about any of them. Most of them sound to me entirely sensible.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

UPDATE AT 4.48pm: Nick Clegg has now released open letters answering the 
charge that he misled MPs at PMQs. (See 12.40pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/dec/10/mps-question-obrs-robert-chote-about-autumn-statement-politics-live-blog#block-54883dd4e4b0e350c699ac44>
 This is what he says about his claim that Andy Burnham oversaw the 
privatisation of an NHS hospital.

On 26 March 2010, that is before the General Election and while you were still 
Health Secretary, the three organisations shortlisted for the contract to run 
Hinchingbrooke Hospital were Circle Health, Ramsay Health Care UK and Serco 
Health ... all of which are non-NHS organisations.

The NAO report of the bidding process published on 8 November 2012 ... clearly 
states that in December 2009 there were only 3 bidders left in the process – 
Circle Health, Ramsay Health Care UK and Serco Health. It says on page 20 that 
the “the two NHS trusts involved both withdrew at early stages of the process.”

When making your Point of Order, you may have been referring to the fact that 
the Serco bid included working with the Peterborough and Stamford NHS 
Foundation Trust. Given it is clear that the actual bidder was Serco, I suggest 
that you are stretching the boundaries of accuracy to their very limit.

And this is what he says about the charge that he wrongly said pensioner 
poverty went up underLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

I did not, at any point, claim that pensioner poverty “rose under the last 
government”. I said that it was “higher” under the Labour Government than it is 
now, after the reforms led by the Liberal Democrat Pensions Minister, Steve 
Webb MP, in the Coalition Government. These are very different things and what 
I said is entirely accurate.

In the letters he has released, he has not addressed the charge that he was 
wrong about women benefiting more than men from the increase in the basic rate 
tax threshold.

Poll shows strong support for Labour messages on the economy

ComRes has released some polling it has done for ITV on the autumn statement.  
<http://comres.co.uk/poll/1346/itv-news-autumn-statement-poll.htm>

It found that, of the four tax measures in the autumn statement, the Google 
tax was the one that people were most likely to say was good for them 
personally (with a net score of +55 - those who say it will be good for them, 
59%, minus those who say it won’t, 4%). The others are cutting stamp duty 
(+48), abolishing inheritance tax on ISAs (+47) and abolishing air passenger 
duty (+31). This is curious because the Google tax won’t actually benefit most 
people personally, unless they recognise the indirect gain they might get from 
the government getting a fairly minuscule increase in tax revenue. The tax 
change that most people are most likely to notice, the cut in air passenger 
duty, is bottom of the list.

But the poll is interesting because it shows strong support for two Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> messages on the economy:

The government is cutting public spending too much and too quickly: +19 (net 
score - those who agree minus those who disagree)

It would be better to slow the rate of spending cuts even if it makes it take 
longer to get the country’s finances back on track: +27

By contrast, two coalition messages on the economy do not have public support:

The way the government is going about cutting public spending is fair: -15

Things in this country are generally heading in the right direction: 0

(A third message, that the economy has been fixed, has a net approval rating 
of -56, but I did not include this in the list of coalition messages because 
ministers argue the coalition is on course to being fixed, not that it has been 
fixed.)

The Commons foreign affairs committee has published a short report on China’s 
decision to stop it visiting Honk Kong as part of its inquiry into the former 
colony. 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmfaff/842/84202.htm>
 It says the government should be protested more robustly, and that the Chinese 
ambassador should have been summoned to the Foreign Office.

Here’s an extract.

We thank the FCO for its efforts to assist the committee and we welcome the 
contact it has already had with senior ministers and officials in China about 
the ban. However, we consider that the minister’s reply did not go far enough, 
given the gravity of the circumstances and the insult to theHouse of Commons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> and to the UK as a whole. 
We call on the government to respond more robustly to this unprecedented act by 
the Chinese government. We recommend that the FCO raise this matter with its 
partners in the European Union. In particular, we recommend that the government 
summon the Chinese ambassador in London to the Foreign Office, and make formal 
written protests to its counterparts in Beijing and Hong Kong.

Lunchtime summary

 * Harriet Harman, the deputy Labour leader, has used PMQs to accuse the 
coalition to penalising women through its policies. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30411212> She said that the number of 
women bringing sex discrimination cases to tribunals had fallen dramatically 
since charges were introduced and that 85% of those who benefited from the cut 
in the top rate of tax to 45p were men.Nick Clegg, who was standing in for 
David Cameron, rejected her claims. Clegg said:

We have cut tax for 11.9m women - the gender pay gap for women under 40 has 
pretty well disappeared under this coalition. Under Labour, only one in eight 
of FTSE board members, under this government there are more women on FTSE 100 
boards than ever before. TheLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
 party is becoming the Lance Armstrong of British politics - they have 
forgotten the better half of a decade of how they messed things

 * David Cameron has conceded he has no control over when the Chilcot report 
into the Iraq war will appear after previously urging the inquiry to publish 
before Christmas. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/10/david-cameron-not-in-control-iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-report>
 * Cameron has lit a candle at a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust on a 
visit to the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland.As the Press 
Association reports, writing in the book of remembrance, Mr Cameron described 
Auschwitz as “this place where the darkest chapter of human history happened” 
and vowed that the world must “never forget”. During a 90-minute tour of the 
camp, the prime minister saw the train tracks which brought at least 1.1 
million men, women and children - the majority of them Jews - to the camp and 
entered prison huts where they were held and gas chambers where many of them 
were murdered. Speaking later, he said his first visit to the camp had filled 
him with “an overwhelming sense of grief for all those who were killed simply 
because of their faith, their beliefs or their ethnicity”.  David Cameron is

he made to the former concentration camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau Photograph:

 * Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has said that refugees should be 
taken out of the government’s immigration target as it is clouding their 
consciences over helping vulnerable people. Speaking in the Commons during an 
urgent question, she called on the government to sign up to the United Nations 
programme to give asylum to the most vulnerable Syrian refugees. As the Press 
Association reports, Cooper said the government’s own scheme, which has so far 
accepted 90 refugees, is not working and stressed the UN is now asking for more 
help while ministers “do nothing”. James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, 
said Cooper’s assertion that decisions are being clouded by the net migration 
target was “actually not worthy to the debate”. 
 * Birmingham city council, the UK’s largest authority, has announced plans to 
cut a further 6,000 jobs and reduce a wide range of services to make savings of 
more than £300m. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/10/birmingham-city-council-axe-thousands-jobs-cuts>
 * Theresa May, the home secretary, has told a child abuse summit that 
so-called snooper’s charter laws could have helped law enforcement officers 
catch more paedophiles online. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/10/theresa-may-data-law-catch-paedophiles>
 * Natasha Bolter, the former Ukip candidate who claims she was sexually 
harassed by the party’s general secretary, Roger Bird, has said that he invited 
her to his club on the day of her initial interview to become a parliamentary 
candidate.

PMQs verdict

PMQs Verdict: Why was Nick Clegg quite so bad? He can be reasonably 
effectively at the despatch box, and today it is not as if he was caught out by 
surprise by Harriet Harman’s line of attack.Overnight she signalled that she 
was going to focus women’s issues today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/09/labour-women-challenge-conservatives-general-election-harriet-harman>
and this morning the Labour party even issued a press release from her on this 
topic.

What she didn’t do, though, was reveal in advance the precise questions she 
was going to ask. Clegg should have been able to guess the first one, about the 
lack of female Lib Dem cabinet minsters, and the sensible thing to have done 
would have been too concede the problem, and perhaps say something newsy about 
Lib Dem selection procedures. (The party has a long-standing problem getting 
women selected in winnable seats.) A real announcement from the despatch box 
almost always trumps what the opposition has to say. But he didn’t.

After that Harman raised some much trickier questions, all of which were good 
examples of how an opposition figure can use PMQs to highlight an unpalatable 
fact. What is the fall in sex discrimination cases since tribunal fees were 
introduced? 90% What proportion of the people gaining from cutting the top rate 
of tax were men? 85%. What proportion of those hit by the bedroom tax are 
women? Two thirds. Clegg did not really try to engage with any of these 
questions, but instead resorted to a broad-brush defence of the coalition’s 
general record, using claims that weren’t always factually robust. (See12.40pm.)
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/dec/10/mps-question-obrs-robert-chote-about-autumn-statement-politics-live-blog#block-54883dd4e4b0e350c699ac44>
It was rather unimpressive.

Harman did not just win the exchanges comfortably. She also effectively 
countered Clegg’s Lib Dem differentiation strategy by getting him to defend the 
coalition’s record so unequivocally. Mostly Clegg sounded like David Cameron - 
except Cameron would have been funnier.

But that takes us back to the question: why was Clegg so poor? I’ve got two 
theories.

First, perhaps he just thinks it doesn’t count. Performing well at PMQs 
clearly does matter to Cameron, butClegg has made no secret of that fact that 
he finds Westminster culture in general, and PMQs in particular, fairly awful 
<http://www.libdemvoice.org/this-is-not-a-snub-i-thought-it-would-be-a-nice-change-to-get-out-of-the-westminster-bubble-clegg-on-his-autumn-statement-absence-43633.html>
and he may have decided there was not point spending a day and a half crafting 
his answers just so he could get a good write-up at 12.3opm.

Second, mentally, he may already be heading for the exit. Given the 
probability of a hung parliament, and the possibility that seat numbers could 
pushLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> towards a coalition 
with the Lib Dems, you would have thought a shrewd Lib Dem leader might make an 
effort to keep relations cordial with the opposition. But today it was as if 
Clegg simply could not be bothered. One reason might be that he does not expect 
to be around for long after 7 May.

On a point of order, Gregg McClymont, the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, says Clegg misled MPs about 
Labour’s record on pensioner poverty. He should set the record straight.

John Bercow says these issues are a matter for debate. If he had to correct 
MPs when they said something wrong, he would be very busy, he says.

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, says Clegg did not have a good 
outing on points of fact. Clegg accused Burnham of privatising a hospital. That 
was not true, he says. Burnham says he did not choose a private bidder to run 
Hinchingbrooke hospital. When it left his hands, there were three bidders, 
including an NHS one.

Bercow says it is up to Clegg to decide if he wants to correct the record.

Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, rises to accuse Clegg of getting 
another fact wrong. He said more women than men gained from the rise in the 
basic rate tax threshold, she says. But theHouse of Commons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> library has produced 
figures showing that more men have gained.

Bercow repeats the point about it being up to Clegg to decide whether to

 * Lord Mandleson, the Labour former business secretary, has said mainstream 
parties must learn to fight back against the arguments being used by populist 
parties like Ukip. In a speech to the IPPR thinktank he said:

Arguments about identity are very emotional. Arguments about migrants are very 
emotional. But we have to argue back.

We have forgotten how to make a case. We have forgotten what the arguments are.

We have lost our confidence, lost our bullishness and ability to push back 
against that emotion with equally charged, emotional, passionate beliefs of our 
own. And until we rediscover that ability then we are not going to recover or 
recover very quickly.

 * Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former first minister, has used an interview with 
the Spectator to set out the SNP’s three ambitions in a hung parliament.He said 
they were: “pursuing the redemption of the vow in full terms, sticking up for 
Scottish causes, and pursuing progressive politics with allies on things like 
the living wage or international issues when we have got a lot to say.” He 
confirmed that the SNP would not do a deal with the Tories in a hung 
parliament. And he also defended Prince Charles’ right to send letters to 
ministers containing advice. He said: 
I don’t think I’ve met anyone with a greater love of Scotland than Prince 
Charles, or the Duke of Rothesay as we should call him. I know some newspapers 
get extremely upset and irritated by the messages he sends to ministers and I 
can confirm he does send messages to ministers. But I can also say I have never 
been upset about any of them. Most of them sound to me entirely sensible.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

UPDATE AT 4.48pm: Nick Clegg has now released open letters answering the 
charge that he misled MPs at PMQs. (See 12.40pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/dec/10/mps-question-obrs-robert-chote-about-autumn-statement-politics-live-blog#block-54883dd4e4b0e350c699ac44>
 This is what he says about his claim that Andy Burnham oversaw the 
privatisation of an NHS hospital.

On 26 March 2010, that is before the General Election and while you were still 
Health Secretary, the three organisations shortlisted for the contract to run 
Hinchingbrooke Hospital were Circle Health, Ramsay Health Care UK and Serco 
Health ... all of which are non-NHS organisations.

The NAO report of the bidding process published on 8 November 2012 ... clearly 
states that in December 2009 there were only 3 bidders left in the process – 
Circle Health, Ramsay Health Care UK and Serco Health. It says on page 20 that 
the “the two NHS trusts involved both withdrew at early stages of the process.”

When making your Point of Order, you may have been referring to the fact that 
the Serco bid included working with the Peterborough and Stamford NHS 
Foundation Trust. Given it is clear that the actual bidder was Serco, I suggest 
that you are stretching the boundaries of accuracy to their very limit.

And this is what he says about the charge that he wrongly said pensioner 
poverty went up underLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

I did not, at any point, claim that pensioner poverty “rose under the last 
government”. I said that it was “higher” under the Labour Government than it is 
now, after the reforms led by the Liberal Democrat Pensions Minister, Steve 
Webb MP, in the Coalition Government. These are very different things and what 
I said is entirely accurate.

In the letters he has released, he has not addressed the charge that he was 
wrong about women benefiting more than men from the increase in the basic rate 
tax threshold.

 
ComRes has released some polling it has done for ITV on the autumn statement.  
<http://comres.co.uk/poll/1346/itv-news-autumn-statement-poll.htm>

It found that, of the four tax measures in the autumn statement, the Google 
tax was the one that people were most likely to say was good for them 
personally (with a net score of +55 - those who say it will be good for them, 
59%, minus those who say it won’t, 4%). The others are cutting stamp duty 
(+48), abolishing inheritance tax on ISAs (+47) and abolishing air passenger 
duty (+31). This is curious because the Google tax won’t actually benefit most 
people personally, unless they recognise the indirect gain they might get from 
the government getting a fairly minuscule increase in tax revenue. The tax 
change that most people are most likely to notice, the cut in air passenger 
duty, is bottom of the list.

But the poll is interesting because it shows strong support for two Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> messages on the economy:

The government is cutting public spending too much and too quickly: +19 (net 
score - those who agree minus those who disagree)

It would be better to slow the rate of spending cuts even if it makes it take 
longer to get the country’s finances back on track: +27

By contrast, two coalition messages on the economy do not have public support:

The way the government is going about cutting public spending is fair: -15

Things in this country are generally heading in the right direction: 0

(A third message, that the economy has been fixed, has a net approval rating 
of -56, but I did not include this in the list of coalition messages because 
ministers argue the coalition is on course to being fixed, not that it has been 
fixed.)
 
The Commons foreign affairs committee has published a short report on China’s 
decision to stop it visiting Honk Kong as part of its inquiry into the former 
colony. 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmfaff/842/84202.htm>
 It says the government should be protested more robustly, and that the Chinese 
ambassador should have been summoned to the Foreign Office.

Here’s an extract.

We thank the FCO for its efforts to assist the committee and we welcome the 
contact it has already had with senior ministers and officials in China about 
the ban. However, we consider that the minister’s reply did not go far enough, 
given the gravity of the circumstances and the insult to theHouse of Commons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> and to the UK as a whole. 
We call on the government to respond more robustly to this unprecedented act by 
the Chinese government. We recommend that the FCO raise this matter with its 
partners in the European Union. In particular, we recommend that the government 
summon the Chinese ambassador in London to the Foreign Office, and make formal 
written protests to its counterparts in Beijing and Hong Kong.
 
 * Harriet Harman, the deputy Labour leader, has used PMQs to accuse the 
coalition to penalising women through its policies. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30411212> She said that the number of 
women bringing sex discrimination cases to tribunals had fallen dramatically 
since charges were introduced and that 85% of those who benefited from the cut 
in the top rate of tax to 45p were men.Nick Clegg, who was standing in for 
David Cameron, rejected her claims. Clegg said:

We have cut tax for 11.9m women - the gender pay gap for women under 40 has 
pretty well disappeared under this coalition. Under Labour, only one in eight 
of FTSE board members, under this government there are more women on FTSE 100 
boards than ever before. TheLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
 party is becoming the Lance Armstrong of British politics - they have 
forgotten the better half of a decade of how they messed things

 * David Cameron has conceded he has no control over when the Chilcot report 
into the Iraq war will appear after previously urging the inquiry to publish 
before Christmas. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/10/david-cameron-not-in-control-iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-report>
 * Cameron has lit a candle at a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust on a 
visit to the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland.As the Press 
Association reports, writing in the book of remembrance, Mr Cameron described 
Auschwitz as “this place where the darkest chapter of human history happened” 
and vowed that the world must “never forget”. During a 90-minute tour of the 
camp, the prime minister saw the train tracks which brought at least 1.1 
million men, women and children - the majority of them Jews - to the camp and 
entered prison huts where they were held and gas chambers where many of them 
were murdered. Speaking later, he said his first visit to the camp had filled 
him with “an overwhelming sense of grief for all those who were killed simply 
because of their faith, their beliefs or their ethnicity”.  David Cameron is 
shown the Birkenau extermination camp in Poland, during a personal visit that 
he made to the former concentration camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau Photograph:

 * Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has said that refugees should be 
taken out of the government’s immigration target as it is clouding their 
consciences over helping vulnerable people. Speaking in the Commons during an 
urgent question, she called on the government to sign up to the United Nations 
programme to give asylum to the most vulnerable Syrian refugees. As the Press 
Association reports, Cooper said the government’s own scheme, which has so far 
accepted 90 refugees, is not working and stressed the UN is now asking for more 
help while ministers “do nothing”. James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, 
said Cooper’s assertion that decisions are being clouded by the net migration 
target was “actually not worthy to the debate”. 
 * Birmingham city council, the UK’s largest authority, has announced plans to 
cut a further 6,000 jobs and reduce a wide range of services to make savings of 
more than £300m. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/10/birmingham-city-council-axe-thousands-jobs-cuts>
 * Theresa May, the home secretary, has told a child abuse summit that 
so-called snooper’s charter laws could have helped law enforcement officers 
catch more paedophiles online. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/10/theresa-may-data-law-catch-paedophiles>
 * Natasha Bolter, the former Ukip candidate who claims she was sexually 
harassed by the party’s general secretary, Roger Bird, has said that he invited 
her to his club on the day of her initial interview to become a parliamentary 
candidate.

PMQs Verdict: Why was Nick Clegg quite so bad? He can be reasonably 
effectively at the despatch box, and today it is not as if he was caught out by 
surprise by Harriet Harman’s line of attack.Overnight she signalled that she 
was going to focus women’s issues today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/09/labour-women-challenge-conservatives-general-election-harriet-harman>
and this morning the Labour party even issued a press release from her on this

What she didn’t do, though, was reveal in advance the precise questions she 
was going to ask. Clegg should have been able to guess the first one, about the 
lack of female Lib Dem cabinet minsters, and the sensible thing to have done 
would have been too concede the problem, and perhaps say something newsy about 
Lib Dem selection procedures. (The party has a long-standing problem getting 
women selected in winnable seats.) A real announcement from the despatch box 
almost always trumps what the opposition has to say. But he didn’t.

After that Harman raised some much trickier questions, all of which were good 
examples of how an opposition figure can use PMQs to highlight an unpalatable 
fact. What is the fall in sex discrimination cases since tribunal fees were 
introduced? 90% What proportion of the people gaining from cutting the top rate 
of tax were men? 85%. What proportion of those hit by the bedroom tax are 
women? Two thirds. Clegg did not really try to engage with any of these 
questions, but instead resorted to a broad-brush defence of the coalition’s 
general record, using claims that weren’t always factually robust. (See12.40pm.)

It was rather unimpressive.

Harman did not just win the exchanges comfortably. She also effectively 
countered Clegg’s Lib Dem differentiation strategy by getting him to defend the 
coalition’s record so unequivocally. Mostly Clegg sounded like David Cameron - 
except Cameron would have been funnier.

But that takes us back to the question: why was Clegg so poor? I’ve got two 
theories.

First, perhaps he just thinks it doesn’t count. Performing well at PMQs 
clearly does matter to Cameron, butClegg has made no secret of that fact that 
he finds Westminster culture in general, and PMQs in particular, fairly awful 
<http://www.libdemvoice.org/this-is-not-a-snub-i-thought-it-would-be-a-nice-change-to-get-out-of-the-westminster-bubble-clegg-on-his-autumn-statement-absence-43633.html>
and he may have decided there was not point spending a day and a half crafting 
his answers just so he could get a good write-up at 12.3opm.

Second, mentally, he may already be heading for the exit. Given the 
probability of a hung parliament, and the possibility that seat numbers could 
pushLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> towards a coalition 
with the Lib Dems, you would have thought a shrewd Lib Dem leader might make an 
effort to keep relations cordial with the opposition. But today it was as if 
Clegg simply could not be bothered. One reason might be that he does not expect 
to be around for long after 7 May.
 
On a point of order, Gregg McClymont, the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP, says Clegg misled MPs about 
Labour’s record on pensioner poverty. He should set the record straight.

John Bercow says these issues are a matter for debate. If he had to correct 
MPs when they said something wrong, he would be very busy, he says.

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, says Clegg did not have a good 
outing on points of fact. Clegg accused Burnham of privatising a hospital. That 
was not true, he says. Burnham says he did not choose a private bidder to run 
Hinchingbrooke hospital. When it left his hands, there were three bidders, 
including an NHS one.

Bercow says it is up to Clegg to decide if he wants to correct the record.

Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, rises to accuse Clegg of getting 
another fact wrong. He said more women than men gained from the rise in the 
basic rate tax threshold, she says. But theHouse of Commons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> library has produced 
figures showing that more men have gained.

Bercow repeats the point about it being up to Clegg to decide whether to 
correct the record.
 
Peter Bone, a Conservative, asks Clegg if he agrees with David Cameron that 
new immigration controls should be introduced.

Clegg says that he favours proper exit checks.
