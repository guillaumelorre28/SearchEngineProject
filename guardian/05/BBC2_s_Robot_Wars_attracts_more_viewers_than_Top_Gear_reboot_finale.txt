The show, which began on BBC2 in 1998, peaked in its first incarnation with 6 
million viewers, before tailing off to just 1.2 million and ending up on 
Channel 5.


Occupying the “Top Gear slot” in which viewers have grown accustomed to 
watching whooping middle-aged men indulge in a bit of wanton four-wheel 
destruction, Robot Wars managed to beat the last episode of the new series of 
Top Gear, the first without Jeremy Clarkson.


Chris Evans’ new incarnation of Top Gear finished with a Sunday night audience 
of 1.9 million viewers

It was a good night for BBC2, with Robot Wars being followed by the first of a 
new series of Dragons’ Den, which had 2.9 million viewers, a 14.4% share, from 
9pm.


Dragons’ Den is back for a new 16-part series, so BBC2 looks to have Sunday 
nights all wrapped up.


The Evan Davis business ideas show beat the second episode of BBC1’s three-part
Toby Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/toby-jones> drama, The 
Secret Agent, which is failing to match the ratings performance of previous 
BBC1 Sunday night dramas, such as The Night Manager and War and Peace.


Last night it had 2.7 million viewers, a 13.6% share of the audience.
