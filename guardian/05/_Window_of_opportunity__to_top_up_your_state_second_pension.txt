Retired people and those reaching retirement age before April 2016, with 
broken career records, are being urged to take advantage of a "window of 
opportunity" to top up their state pension.

The autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/05/autumn-statement-how-affects-you>
 announced a new class of voluntary national insurance contributions (NICs) for 
retirees and those close to retirement who have not worked enough years to be 
eligible for the state second pension (an earnings-related top-up that will be 
abolished in April 2016). The new NICs will be introduced in October 2015 and 
run for a limited time.

Tom McPhail, head of pensions at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: "This offers a 
short window of opportunity for those who qualify, and who have a broken record 
of contributions with less than the 35-year entitlement you need to qualify for 
a basic state pension and additional state second pension."

Ros Altmann, pensions expert, adds: "It is definitely worth taking advantage 
of an extra state pension which, unlike putting money into a private pension, 
will give you inflation linking and spouse cover. If you have a partner and die 
early, the state pension will continue for them under the pre-2016 rules."

The current basic state pension is £110.15 a week and the maximum you can 
claim in state second pension for 2013/14 is £163 a week on top of your basic 
state pension – a total of £273.15.

You can already top up your basic state pension with voluntary NICs, which 
offers a "fantastically generous deal", adds McPhail.

He calculates that if you are one year short of receiving the full basic state 
pension you could pay £705 for a year's NICs, which will buy you £190 a year in 
extra basic state pension for the rest of your life.
