 Tony Lloyd, a former Foreign Office minister and Iraq rebel, ousted Ann Clwyd 
as chair of the parliamentary Labour party last night, in what some described 
as an orderly transition and others as a bid for greater backbench influence.
Mr Lloyd defeated Ms Clwyd by 169 to 156 votes after MPs accused her of 
behaving as a "government patsy".

Ms Clwyd is a staunch supporter of Tony Blair, while Mr Lloyd, who is closer 
to Gordon Brown, has earned a reputation for independence by voting against the 
whip on issues tuition fees, foundation hospitals and anti-terrorism 
legislation.
