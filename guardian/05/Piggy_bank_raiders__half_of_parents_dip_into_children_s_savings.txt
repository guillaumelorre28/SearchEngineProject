Nearly half of parents admit to being “piggy bank raiders” who occasionally 
dip into their children’s cash to cover costs such as parking, takeaways, 
taxis, school trips and paying the window cleaner.

Some 46% of parents of children aged between four and 16 years old said they 
have taken money from theirchild’s savings

a survey by Nationwide Building Society has found. The average amount taken 
over the past year was £21.41, while one in 10 parents had taken £50 or more 
during that period.

Mums are more likely to raid their child’s savings than dads, but dads tend to 
swipe larger amounts the survey found.

The months after Christmas, when many families are getting their finances back 
on track, also appear to be the time when piggy bank raiders are most prolific.

The survey of 2,000 parents found those in Yorkshire and the Humber, 
north-east England and south-west England were the most likely to use 
children’s savings, with those in London, Wales and north-west England the 
least likely.

About 15% of piggy bank raiding parents said they used the cash to pay school 
lunch money, while the same proportion also use it to pay a bill; 11% used the 
money for school trips and 11% used it as loose change for parking. One in 12 
took the money to tide themselves over as they were broke.

A further 12% used the cash for other purposes, including bus fares, hair 
cuts, petrol costs, takeaways, paying the window cleaner and for the “tooth 
fairy”.

The vast majority of parents (93%) said they put the money back afterwards – 
and only 39% of children noticed the money had disappeared.

Nearly a third of parents who took money said they had confessed to their 
child, while 23% sneaked the money back into their child’s piggy bank. One in 
seven added interest to the amount they had borrowed.

Andrew Baddeley-Chappell, Nationwide’s head of savings and mortgage policy, 
said: “Despite being in charge of instilling a good approach to finance, almost 
half of parents have been caught in spring raids on their kid’s piggy bank 
stash. While liberating change for parking or to pay school lunch money could 
be viewed as excusable, one in 10 parents borrowed more than £50 in the last 
year, including for paying bills.

“Although more than half of kids don’t even notice the money has gone, it is 
reassuring that the vast majority of parents, including me, pay the cash back, 
with one in seven paying back even more than they borrowed to ease their guilt. 
Based on these findings, perhaps there are even more reasons for parents to 
encourage their kids to start the savings habit.”
