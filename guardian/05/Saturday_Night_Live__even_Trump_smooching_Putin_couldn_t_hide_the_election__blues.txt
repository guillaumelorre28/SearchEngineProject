The greatest Saturday Night Live 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live> tradition of 
them all is the hallowed tradition of the cold open, when the characters only 
really break the fourth wall when they shout: “Live from New York, it’s 
Saturday night!”

They may walk backstage – or in the case of Kate McKinnon’s Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Alec Baldwin’s Donald 
Trump, “run” several blocks south and west to Times Square to embrace people 
who look like their opponent’s supporters – but it’s always in character.

Until Saturday night, when they ran back in the studio as a Rock the Vote 
advertisement.

“And now it’s time to get out there and vote. None of this will have mattered 
if you don’t vote,” said Baldwin.

“And we can’t tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday, we all get to chose 
what kind of country we want to live in” said McKinnon, before they shouted the 
cold open.

The parts where Baldwin’s Trump kissed the FBI, Putin and the Ku Klux Klan 
while Cecily Strong’s Erin Burnett insisted on focusing on Clinton’s emails 
were funnier.

Afterwards, Benedict Cumberbatch welcomed the audience with: “It’s so great to 
be hosting Saturday Night Live on the last weekend of America as we know it.” 
Then he encouraged us to drink, as though Americans watching television at 
11.35pm on a Saturday needed any encouragement.

After that, he performed the most British version possible of the theme from 
Shaft, during which Leslie Jones revealed herself as a Cumberbitch and he 
revealed his feminist discomfort with the term.

Jones also asked him to read her “Sherlock Holmes and the case of the missing 
underwear” fanfic and he called himself “The mother-loving Cumberbatch”, all 
while other (white) cast members played the blacksploitation Greek chorus and 
McKinnon played his BFF Tilda Swinton. (Look, Americans think all British 
actors just hang out together all the time, just go with it.)

Next, Cumberbatch perched on “The Koohl Toiler by Kohler”.

After, he picked his wedgie, which was a weird lead-in for the first sketch, 
the Game Show network show “Why is Benedict Cumberbatch hot?”

Cast member Beck Bennett hosted, with the explanation: “Every girl in the cast 
has been so horny for this dude all week and, as a guy, I’m just trying to 
figure that out.”

Breaking news: Cumberbatch admitted he had an “average-sized” ... something.

But for the Cumberbitches:

Time for a boring taped sketch: “office hours”, with Cumberbatch as a 
professor questioning his sexuality because of a really dumb undergraduate 
named Chad. It was most notable for the almost-kiss, Cumberbatch’s excellent 
(in the last half) American accent and Chad snickering “Huh, huh, Taint” like 
Beavis.

Next, Grandma is getting re-married at 83 but, at her surprise bachelorette 
party, her drunken female friends and relatives miss her deadly heart attack. 
Two construction worker strippers, one of whom is portrayed by Cumberbatch, 
abuse her corpse, cover her in whipped cream, and then dry hump her face. At 
the end, three members of the World Series champion Cubs show up to grind on 
her while saying: “Who wants to hit a granny slam?”

It was funnier on Weekend at Bernie’s.

Finally, a palate cleanser: Solange

After which, of course, came weekend update, in which hosts Michael Che and 
Colin Jost hit on the disclosure that there were new Clinton emails for the FBI 
to review because of Huma Abedin’s soon-to-be ex-husband. “A Weiner always pops 
up at the worst possible time,” said Jost.

Che said Clinton has to be annoyed at running against Trump and being 
criticized over her emails: “It’s like giving up weed for a job interview and 
then losing the job to a crackhead.”

Jost then slammed Melania Trump’s impassioned plea for people to be nicer to 
one another on the internet: “Donald Trump called his wife’s speech sad, fake 
and gay.”

Che and Jost also hit the get-out-and-vote message, after which Jost said: 
“Soon we’ll come together as a country to begin that long journey toward 
impeaching whomever we just elected. Because on Tuesday, the fate of our 
country is finally in the hands of the people who truly matter: the Russian 
teenagers who will hack into our voting machines.”

They did bring back Dana Carvey at the Church Lady, who didn’t have much to 
say about the election itself but told Jost: “You’re just a late-night comic 
with a belly full of booze and a dressing room full of whores.” She also 
insisted he was gay, which ... I don’t know, I guess it’s funny to call people 
that read incredibly straight gay now.

After a few jokes about the random news stories of the week, Jost and Che 
brought on the winners of “Weekend Update’s The Voice contest”, which is 
unaffiliated with the NBC Emmy-winning juggernaut reality show but who cares. 
It was Bill Murray and three Cubs singing.

If Murray at one point had fucks to give, he is all out. And it’s great.

Viewers in New York City, at least, were then treated to a “The Clintons” 
cartoon that looked like a crappy Simpsons parody, featuring Anthony Weiner. 
But it was actually an adby the anti-Clinton super pac, Future 45 
<http://fortune.com/2016/11/02/donald-trump-is-getting-a-10-million-tv-ad-boost-from-this-super-pac/>
, which is led by the founder of TD Ameritrade and whose largest donor is 
Sheldon Adelson.

Still, in the comedy desert that is often the post-Weekend Update minutes, a 
poorly animated Super Pac commercial was at least more entertaining than the 
next sketch, which featured Cumberbatch as a “rock and roll mentalist” whose 
British girlfriend (Strong doing what I think was an American version of what 
Americans think a cockney accent is) gives Kenan Thompson an erection. Yes, 
that was the punchline.

The second-to-last sketch, featuring Cumberbatch as an evil villain who 
insists on giving the law enforcement heroes a way to avoid certain death by 
answering riddles would have been funny, if it hadn’t been a joke in the Austin 
Powers series. And the final sketch, in which a couple of hospital 
administrators ask for money from a rich guy, whose assistant is Cumberbatch, 
who turns out to be just a bald eagle statue atop a suit was, possibly, funny 
to people who solicit money for a living and have to jump through hoops and 
pretend the emperor is quite well-dressed, actually. To anyone still watching 
and sober, it was just sort of depressing.

Maybe it’s the election blues, but something about dry-humping grandma’s 
corpse and later finding out that one’s future is controlled by those in the 
thrall of a mass delusion isn’t that funny. Maybe it’s just too soon.
