The gender pay gap is growing when it comes to how much pocket money children 
get, with boys 12% better off than girls, it was claimed on Friday.

While boys are handed an average of £6.93 a week by generous payments, girls 
get £6.16, according to Halifax’s latest pocket money survey. In 2015 the gap 
was just 2%.

Despite getting much more than the girls, boys were more likely to tell the 
survey that they thought their pocket money should be increased, with 44% 
saying they needed a pay rise, versus 39% of girls.

Recent analysis put the gender pay gap in women’s full-time salaries at 24%

, with female workers earning £300,000 less than men over their working lives.

Halifax’s survey found that pocket money was at a nine-year high, averaging 
£6.55 a week – up by 35p on 2015’s figure.

Pocket money was found to be highest in London, with children being given an 
average of £8.21 a week. In contrast, youngsters in East Anglia were typically 
handed £4.96 a week.

The study – which has been compiled by Halifax since 1987 – shows that 
parents, on average, start giving their children pocket money between the age 
of six and seven.

The average amounts are based on a survey of children aged between eight and 
15. On average eight-year-olds received £5.06 while 15-year-olds got £7.85.


Giles Martin, head of Halifax Savings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/savings>, said: “It’s reassuring to see that 
the average weekly amount has reached a nine-year high. Some parents are 
clearly not feeling the pinch in the same way as they have done in recent 
years, when weekly pocket money dipped as low as £5.89.

“It’s likely it’ll be a few more years until we reach the dizzy heights of 
£8.37 in 2005 though, when we saw the highest average pocket money since our 
records began.”
