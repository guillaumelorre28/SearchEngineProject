The Game of Thrones episode Battle of the Bastards has won a record seven 
Emmys, which prompted a Guardian article onsix of the best hours of TV drama 
ever made.

There were hundreds of counter-suggestions for era-defining moments on other 
telly shows, some even made before the year 2000.


Here are 10 of our favourites. A warning: there are some final episodes and 
plot twists discussed below, so if you’re the kind of person who is worried 
about spoilers for shows broadcast 20 years ago that you never quite got round 
to, tread carefully.

The bleak and occasionally surreal 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83637063> last episode of 
Alan Bleasdale’s angry drama about Thatcherism’s effect on the working classes 
got plenty of mentions below the line, but Yosser’s Story won out for its 
memorable central character, Yosser Hughes.


“There will never be daring politically-charged drama like BFTB again, never,” 
said one commenter. “The older this series becomes the more haunting and raw it 
comes across ... each episode makes you laugh out loud and cry with despair.”

We got quite a few Doctor Who propositions, spanning decades of the rambling 
Gallifreyan’s adventures. Blink was also popular, and “how about the first 
episode ofDoctor Who <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who> with 
the intrigue of the two teachers following up on the problematic pupil Susan.”

But let’s go with Heaven Sent, brutal though it is.

sublime.

As I once said, only David Lynch would have his protagonist walk into the 
realm of ultimate evil and then begin the scene with an illusion of a guy 
singing a song about sycamore trees.

Other great moments:
- The ominous tone of the meeting at the sheriff's office as Cooper pieces 
everything together.
- Mulder and Scully were not the first FBI agents to cast a flashlight into 
the darkness as they prepare to confront the great unknown - Cooper did it 
first and perhaps most memorably. (And I'm a big X-Files fan too.)
- The whole Red Room sequence is fantastic because it really does feel like 
another plane of reality. Sometimes the supernatural in fiction can be a bit 
bland when the supernatural entities behave and speak like they're just humans 
with magical powers. Definitely not the case here.
- "How's Annie?" Heartbreaking but fittingly frustrating open-ended conclusion 
(it wasn't scripted to be one, strictly speaking, though I think they knew 
cancellation was likely).

The death of Christopher Eccleston’s police inspector at the hands of Robert 
Carlyle’s burgeoning psychopath in Jimmy McGovern’s Cracker came about because 
Eccleston was fed up playing “second fiddle” to Robbie Coltrane’s brooding 
genius psychologist Fitz. But he was lured back for the second series so he 
could be written out in style.

That Cracker was devastating. It really rewrote the rule book on crime drama. 
I'm still in shock. Great choice.

Michael Conrad, who played the philosophical Sergeant Phil Esterhaus in this 
memorable 1980s cop drama, had been suffering from urethral cancer. His 
workload in the series was gradually reduced, and after his death, it was 
decided no other actor should step in to replace him. The character was duly 
written out as having had a heart attack while having sex with his girlfriend.

Hill Street Blues. Season 4 Episode 17. First episode I ever saw of this.

Michael Conrad who played the station Sergeant, had just died in real life, so 
was given a heart attack in the show, and all the actors were struggling 
throughout to try to keep composed. It struck a nerve with me (whilst I was 
waiting for the new Frankie Goes To Hollywood video premiere, and off my face 
on acid.)

Since then, I have watched the whole series a couple of times, and it is up 
there with the best television ever created.

Certainly one of the most influential – and most parodied – British series 
ever made, The Prisoner’s unsettling, surreal and disturbing themes of Cold War 
paranoia seem as important today as they ever were.

Plus, Portmeirion is lovely for a nice day out.

Yes, OK, you're absolutely right 23rdturnoff, 16 has a lot of 'answers' if 
that's how you want to think of it, but don't you think the last episode is *so 
much more surreal - and even shocking - than Once Upon A Time? I've always felt 
it was the one I loved most. I remember vividly all those years ago sneaking 
out of bed to watch it, it was on quite late and my mum had said I had to go to 
bed, but I watched it anyway, with the sound on really low. (In second place I 
might have the first episode, Arrival.)

It’s now fondly remembered as a classic, though like a lot of Trek series, TNG 
took a while to get going. But nothing prepared viewers for the cliffhanger end 
to Best of Both Worlds, with Captain Picard assimilated into the Borg and 
acting Captain Riker making the order to fire upon him.

Admittedly the conclusion wasn’t quite so good, but hey.

Best of Both Worlds - Star Trek: The Next Generation.

As much as I love both episodes of that Star Trek: The Next Generation story 
it's far from being the best. ST:TNG's "Darmok", "Yesterday's Enterprise", "The 
Inner Light" and "Chain of Command, part 2" are all arguably superior.

Don't get me wrong, "Best of Both Worlds" is a great story but part 2 has an 
anticlimactic ending, especially the way that the Borg are eventually defeated.

If you love space battles and conflict in the Star Trek universe then Star 
Trek: Deep Space Nine has some pretty good episodes, too.

agree on this one in the end.

The West Wing's season 2 episode 'Noel' was brilliant TV. Dealing with Josh's 
PTSD and the emotional trauma of the shooting at the end of S1.
And Leo's story about the guy in a hole.

Also Season 1's 'In Excelsis Deo'. Toby's one man mission after the homeless 
veteran died due to the cold winds off the chesapeake, Mrs Landingham's 
heartbreaking story about her two sons being killed in DaNang on Christmas eve 
and the finale of the military funeral in Arlington over the sounds of 'the 
little drummer boy'

So many ER tips. Among them, Hell and High Water – “the making of George 
Clooney”, according toBennyBlanco: 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83618303>

“ER is woefully neglected here. It was unbelievable TV in the early days, 
before it got bogged down trying to ruin Carter’s life at every single turn.”

But we’re going with Love’s Labour Lost 
<http://www.avclub.com/article/a-riveting-er-gives-dr-greene-one-bad-day-that-jus-107338>
. “The one where the woman dies in childbirth after Greene makes an error?

The late, lamented frontier psychodrama Deadwood was cancelled unforgivably 
early 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/14/deadwood-is-the-best-drama-hbo-has-ever-made-it-must-be-revived>
, and we wait with optimism for a follow-up movie. But what a cracking show it 
was while it lasted – six seasons of Gold Rush machinations and Ian McShane’s 
brutal brothel owner Al Swearengen gave our readers plenty to pick over. But 
the swaggering, profanity-heavy opening episode gets the nod.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83626376> 
And any other episode of any other season, most especially those featuring Ian 
McShane's soliloquies, Timothy Olyphant's dashing good looks and urbane 
politeness, Geri Jewel's wise, crippled servant girl in a whorehouse, and Robin 
Weigert as the flamboyant, talented ,troubled, terminal alcoholic, Calamity 
Jane . Deadwood is Shakespearean brilliance.
