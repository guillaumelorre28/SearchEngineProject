Polls close

The polls are closing now following a campaign which many believe was the most 
divisive in British politics.

On election nights, it’s usually at this time that broadcasters put out their 
exit polls and make their projection for the night ahead.

There is no such exit poll this time however, although some financial 
institutions are said to have commissioned private exit polls which they are 
likely to keep to themselves.Here’s your guide  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/referendum-night-when-to-nap-and-the-results-to-watch>
on how the night is expected to play out.

Now, turn over to Andrew Sparrow’s referendum night blog

We’re getting some reports around the country of people who say that they have 
been turned away from election booths.

They include people who turned up, polling card in hand, only to be told that 
their name was not on a list.

It’s hard to gauge at this stage how extensive those problems might have been 
but I’ll try to look into a few of those later.

Has Boris Johnson conceded defeat even before the polling stations close or is 
this a little bit of mischief?

Lewis Iwu, a Londoner, says that he bumped into the MP on the underground a 
little earlier and was asked if he voted leave.

Iwu said no and suggested that Johnson had also conceded defeat.

Nick Fletcher

Global stock markets have been climbing sharply today as investors took the 
view that the UK was increasingly unlikely to vote to leave theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, reports the Guardian’s Nick Fletcher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just closed 1.29% higher, with banking 
shares among the main gainers. Earlier in London the FTSE 100 finished 1.23% 
higher, while the pound is currently up 1% at $1.4875.

But the recent rally could be dramatically reversed if the leave campaign does 
end up winning the day.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at City firm CMC Markets, said: “The FTSE 
100 has gained nearly 7% in the last seven days while the pound has rebounded 
from lows of 1.4010 to peak earlier today at 1.4950 and post its highest levels 
this year, as the polls continue to improve in favour of remain.


 “This suggests that a good part of this remain bounce could well be largely 
priced in already and if we get some early results in the early hours of the 
morning pointing to a move back to the leave camp then sterling could drop back 
sharply, potentially dragging stock markets down too.”

Away from the torrential rain in some parts of Britain, the possibility of 
Brexit has been very much on the minds of Britons in sunny southern Spain. A 
sleepless night beckons for some, it seems.


 The Guardian’s Sam Jones has been canvassing opinion in Orihuela Costa

Isle club and reflecting on his paradoxical feelings about Brexit.

Like many of the expats who have made homes here, the retired 75-year-old, 
originally from Bedfordshire, would hate to give up the life of sunshine he and 
his wife have enjoyed for 14 years.

If he’d got round to getting his postal vote in on time, he would have opted 
to remain. Yet if he were still in England, he would have voted to leave the EU.

“I don’t like the way we were conned into it as the man on the street,” he 
said. “When we first went into it, it was a trading deal. It’s just escalated 
and the whole thing has got totally out of hand.”

There is however, little to tempt him back to the UK – and it’s not just the 
excellent Spanish healthcare, the bowls and the sense of community in Alicante 
province.

“We couldn’t afford to go back now,” he said. “If we had to, it would be very 
expensive. The cost of living here is lower and it’s a very sensible life.”

Academic researchers have concluded that 61.6% of young voters intended to 
vote to remain in the EU.

That’s a survey – the details have just come – by Oxford and University of 
Manchester researchers who worked with the data firm RIWI to run the survey 
from the beginning of March up to June. Partial responses came from 7,444 
people under the age of 40.

A last email push is being made by both sides.

One which has arrived from Boris Johnson says:

Polls close in 90 minutes, so obviously we don’t have time for long emails. If 
you have voted leave, thank you.

If you haven’t yet, please do. And please email, text or phone all your 
friends to Vote Leave.

Don’t lose this chance to make today our Independence Day!!!

Thank you so much.

It ends with “Sent from my iPhone” because of course he’s been busy tapping 
that out in the last while.


Another, from Labour, says:


It looks like there could be a record number of people at the polls today, 
showing just how historic an event and how important this decision is to all of 
us.

If you haven’t voted yet — don’t miss out on being a part of it.

There’s still plenty of time, polls are open until 10pm. 

It comes with a link to a Labour gizmo designed to help voters find their 
polling station

Hannah Ellis-Petersen

A dispatch comes in from Glastonbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury>, where the Guardian’s Hannah 
Ellis-Petersen says that there’s general agreement that the “Glastonbury 
bubble” is a welcome break from the political bickering. That said:

Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis may have had no qualms about 
loudly declaring their voting intentions in the EU referendum, but the 
once-in-a-generation poll proved more divisive among the 180,000 festivalgoers 
who arrived in the last 24 hours.

Eavis was not allowed to have a polling station on site but had repeatedly 
urged people coming on Thursday or before to arrange either a postal or proxy 
vote – advice it seems many followed.

The Fleming family, who had travelled from Chesterfield for their first 
Glastonbury together, were divided on the issue. Parents Tim and Jane, 51, both 
favoured Brexit, but their daughter Holly, 20, took the opposite view.

“It just isn’t that bad in the EU and we’re going to be the generation where 
if it goes tits up, we’ll have to sort it out,” she said.

Susan Hardisty, 60, who was also at Glastonbury for the first time, said the 
referendum was “one of the most important votes of our generation, more 
important than the general election”.

She added: “We have kids in their 20s and I think the world will be a lot 
easier for them if we are part of the EU. And the thought of retracting into an 
isolated little Britain just scares the life out of me.”

The man was found collapsed with a stab wound in the Waverley Road area of the

The polls are closing now following a campaign which many believe was the most 
divisive in British politics.

On election nights, it’s usually at this time that broadcasters put out their 
exit polls and make their projection for the night ahead.

There is no such exit poll this time however, although some financial 
institutions are said to have commissioned private exit polls which they are 
likely to keep to themselves.Here’s your guide  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/referendum-night-when-to-nap-and-the-results-to-watch>
on how the night is expected to play out.

Now, turn over to Andrew Sparrow’s referendum night blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-result-live-counting-leave-remain-brain-in-europe>

We’re getting some reports around the country of people who say that they have 
been turned away from election booths.

They include people who turned up, polling card in hand, only to be told that 
their name was not on a list.

It’s hard to gauge at this stage how extensive those problems might have been 
but I’ll try to look into a few of those later.
 
Has Boris Johnson conceded defeat even before the polling stations close or is 
this a little bit of mischief?

Lewis Iwu, a Londoner, says that he bumped into the MP on the underground a 
little earlier and was asked if he voted leave.

Iwu said no and suggested that Johnson had also conceded defeat.

Global stock markets have been climbing sharply today as investors took the 
view that the UK was increasingly unlikely to vote to leave theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, reports the Guardian’s Nick Fletcher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just closed 1.29% higher, with banking 
shares among the main gainers. Earlier in London the FTSE 100 finished 1.23% 
higher, while the pound is currently up 1% at $1.4875.

But the recent rally could be dramatically reversed if the leave campaign does 
end up winning the day.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at City firm CMC Markets, said: “The FTSE 
100 has gained nearly 7% in the last seven days while the pound has rebounded 
from lows of 1.4010 to peak earlier today at 1.4950 and post its highest levels 
this year, as the polls continue to improve in favour of remain.


 “This suggests that a good part of this remain bounce could well be largely 
priced in already and if we get some early results in the early hours of the 
morning pointing to a move back to the leave camp then sterling could drop back 
sharply, potentially dragging stock markets down too.”

Away from the torrential rain in some parts of Britain, the possibility of 
Brexit has been very much on the minds of Britons in sunny southern Spain. A 
sleepless night beckons for some, it seems.


 The Guardian’s Sam Jones has been canvassing opinion in Orihuela Costa 
<https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/orihuela+costa/@37.9955088,-0.9715485,11z/data=!3m1!4b1>
, the largest British enclave in Spain:

Early evening found Colin Lindgren nursing an al fresco pint at the Emerald 
Isle club and reflecting on his paradoxical feelings about Brexit.

Like many of the expats who have made homes here, the retired 75-year-old, 
originally from Bedfordshire, would hate to give up the life of sunshine he and 
his wife have enjoyed for 14 years.

If he’d got round to getting his postal vote in on time, he would have opted 
to remain. Yet if he were still in England, he would have voted to leave the EU.

“I don’t like the way we were conned into it as the man on the street,” he 
said. “When we first went into it, it was a trading deal. It’s just escalated 
and the whole thing has got totally out of hand.”

There is however, little to tempt him back to the UK – and it’s not just the 
excellent Spanish healthcare, the bowls and the sense of community in Alicante 
province.

“We couldn’t afford to go back now,” he said. “If we had to, it would be very 
expensive. The cost of living here is lower and it’s a very sensible life.”
 
Academic researchers have concluded that 61.6% of young voters intended to 
vote to remain in the EU.

That’s a survey – the details have just come – by Oxford and University of 
Manchester researchers who worked with the data firm RIWI to run the survey 
from the beginning of March up to June. Partial responses came from 7,444 
people under the age of 40.
 
A last email push is being made by both sides.

One which has arrived from Boris Johnson says:

Polls close in 90 minutes, so obviously we don’t have time for long emails. If 
you have voted leave, thank you.

If you haven’t yet, please do. And please email, text or phone all your 
friends to Vote Leave.

Don’t lose this chance to make today our Independence Day!!!

Thank you so much.

It ends with “Sent from my iPhone” because of course he’s been busy tapping 
that out in the last while.


Another, from Labour, says:


It looks like there could be a record number of people at the polls today, 
showing just how historic an event and how important this decision is to all of 
us.

If you haven’t voted yet — don’t miss out on being a part of it.

There’s still plenty of time, polls are open until 10pm. 

It comes with a link to a Labour gizmo designed to help voters find their 
polling station

A dispatch comes in from Glastonbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury>, where the Guardian’s Hannah 
Ellis-Petersen says that there’s general agreement that the “Glastonbury 
bubble” is a welcome break from the political bickering. That said:

Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis may have had no qualms about 
loudly declaring their voting intentions in the EU referendum, but the 
once-in-a-generation poll proved more divisive among the 180,000 festivalgoers 
who arrived in the last 24 hours.

Eavis was not allowed to have a polling station on site but had repeatedly 
urged people coming on Thursday or before to arrange either a postal or proxy 
vote – advice it seems many followed.

The Fleming family, who had travelled from Chesterfield for their first 
Glastonbury together, were divided on the issue. Parents Tim and Jane, 51, both 
favoured Brexit, but their daughter Holly, 20, took the opposite view.

“It just isn’t that bad in the EU and we’re going to be the generation where 
if it goes tits up, we’ll have to sort it out,” she said.

Susan Hardisty, 60, who was also at Glastonbury for the first time, said the 
referendum was “one of the most important votes of our generation, more 
important than the general election”.

She added: “We have kids in their 20s and I think the world will be a lot 
easier for them if we are part of the EU. And the thought of retracting into an 
isolated little Britain just scares the life out of me.”

A council in an area where a polling booth was temporarily closed after a man 
was stabbed nearby has been using Twitter to let voters know that it’s open 
again.
Kirklees Council (@KirkleesCouncil) 
The polling station at Waverley Road, Hudds, has now reopened. Anyone who 
could not vote in the 30 minute closure can return up to 10pm

A 19-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident in 
Huddersfield, which West Yorkshire police said was not linked to the EU 
referendum.

The man was found collapsed with a stab wound in the Waverley Road area of the 
town at 5.15pm. Frances Perraudinhad some more details earlier
