First it was the Beatles, now Motown classics are to be re-recorded by stars 
for a newNetflix <https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix> children’s show 
aimed at reaching out to parents tired of listening to saccharine children’s 
songs.

Hot on the heels of forthcoming animation series Beat Bugs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/10/beatles-for-babies-beat-bugs-the-cartoon-bringing-fab-four-to-the-next-generation>
, which features modern renditions of the Beatles classics sung by artists 
including Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams and James Corden, comes another show 
from the same creator, which will be based on the songs of Motown artists such 
as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and the Jackson 5.

The new series will be executive produced by Smokey Robinson and revolves 
around a young boy called Ben who brings to life street art in the imaginary 
city of Motown, Detroit.

Inspired by such songs as You Can’t Hurry Love and Reach Out I’ll Be There, 
Ben and his friends learn about creativity and art.

Beat Bugs creator Josh Wakely broke new ground when, after almost three years 
of trying, he was granted permission by the Beatles’ rights holder Sony/ATV to 
bring the Fab Four’s songs to a new generation.

His latest, as-yet-untitled Motown project will use 52 songs from the 
catalogue of the record company that changed Amercian music in the 20th century 
and have more of an urban feel than Beat Bugs, which is based around five 
animated insects Jay, Kumi, Crick, Buzz, and Walter who have adventures in 
their garden.

Beat Bugs is being released by Netflix around the world on 3 August, along 
with a range of toys and merchandise – plus an album that is available to 
download on Apple Music.

Each of the Beat Bugs episodes is based around two Beatles songs, with some of 
music’s biggest names giving modern versions of the famous melodies. Stewart is 
crooning Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, while Williams sings Good Day 
Sunshine and chatshow host and Carpool Karaoke star Corden takes on I’m A Loser.


The Motown series is still in the early stages of development but is likely to 
follow the same route as Beat Bugs.

Wakely told the Guardian he wanted to not only introduce a new generation to 
some of the classics he grew up with but also make the experience of watching 
children’s shows more enjoyable for parents: “When you come home you want to 
spend time with your child but you also want to watch something you can engage 
with them too. You can enjoy the music and not feel like it’s a chore to listen 
to and they can enjoy it too.”

The surviving Beatles know about the series, says Wakely: “There’s a whole 
dialogue that occurs between Sony/ATV and them. They’re aware of it … I want to 
make [it] as extraordinary as their legacy deserves to be. I have a singular 
goal I think that in 400 years’ time we’ll be talking about the Beatles in the 
same way we talk about Shakespeare now.”

From a couple of series two years ago, Netflix will have 40 original 
children’s shows airing by the end of the year. It is also working with the BBC 
and making more UK-produced programmes and other locally-sourced shows, said 
Netflix global director of children’s content Andy Yeatman: “As we expand 
around the world and as internal markets become bigger and bigger sources of 
our member base it’s something we’re going to do more and more.”
