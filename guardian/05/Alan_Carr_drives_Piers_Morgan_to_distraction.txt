It is fair to assume that Piers Morgan is not a huge fan of Channel 4's Alan 
Carr. According to the Sun the former Mirror man said Carr had "quite possibly 
the most excruciatingly high-pitched, whiny, helium-fuelled, nasal repugnant 
voice in the history of mankind". This after Carr said he would like to replace 
Morgan as a judge on Britain's Got Talent. Alan, it's over to you.
