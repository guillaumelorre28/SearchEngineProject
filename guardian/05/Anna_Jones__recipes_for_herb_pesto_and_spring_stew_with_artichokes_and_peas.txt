Last Sunday afternoon was spent in my friend’s herb garden, which surrounds 
their little cottage on a green, wandering Wiltshire lane. We sat and drank 
bubbly wine and tasted the food we’ll be feasting on at our wedding in a few 
weeks’ time. The table was perched on a little patio right in the middle of the 
herb garden, between the nasturtiums and the lemon verbena, just up from the 
nigella and the baby chard. As platters of joyfully cooked vegetables made 
their way out of the little kitchen and down the garden path, the chefs reached 
into the borders and picked fronds of bronzed fennel to adorn them or darted 
off to the top of the garden for a scattering of allium flowers. These herbs 
really made the plates of food we ate, anointing them with a herby, summery 
greenness.

Just before we ate, a light spattering of rain released a wave of clean, 
bright heady scent. I was instantly convinced that we must move to the 
countryside and create our own herby utopia – but that is by the by ...

As a young, wide-eyed chef I remember being fascinated by the medicinal 
properties of herbs, of how clever they are, how they grow next to plants they 
eat well with, how they can enliven and soothe. Mint and dill helps us digest 
our food, parsley cleanses our palate, basil calms and soothes and used to be 
infused in hot milk as a calming bedtime drink for babies (which I must try). 
There is evidently more to them than just the eating.

My fridge is always home to at least a couple of bunches of herbs. I keep them 
in glasses in our fridge door, with a little water at the bottom of each glass, 
like cut flowers. This way, they last for a week or more and the veil of green 
which meets me when I open the fridge means they constantly inspire and inform 
my cooking.

I use herbs in almost everything I cook and, when a bunch is looking like it 
needs using up, it gets blitzed into a grassy paste before going back into the 
fridge door for another week or so ...

Herb smash and pestos

Herb pastes and pestos are a key part of how I cook. They are spooned on to 
roasted vegetables, used to dress grains, slathered into sandwiches and tossed 
through noodles or pasta. If I have a jar of a herby preparation in my fridge, 
I know I have lunch with flavour and vibrancy on the dreariest of days.

Made with nuts, cheese, herbs and oil and a host of other ingredients, these 
smashes or pestos may not be in your daily repertoire, but they’re one of the 
easiest, most effective and labour-saving ways I know to give a dish a flavour 
boost. All you need is a hand blender or a pestle and mortar.

Start with a simple herb oil. Blitz up a bunch of herbs with a few tablespoons 
of oil and put it in the fridge, or in the freezer in ice cube trays. Use it to 
top soups and stews, to dress salads and to drizzle over roast vegetables or a 
poached egg. It’s a good way to use up a lingering bunch. Just don’t add any 
lemon or vinegar if you want to keep it for a while, as it will turn the herbs 
black.

You can experiment with the flavours here and make herb pestos. Play around 
and pulse, paste and pulverise whatever you fancy. The joy is that these pestos 
and pastes take only seconds to make, but boost the flavour of your food 
tenfold.

Late spring stew of artichokes, peas and herbs

Sometimes I stir through a generous helping of herbs, like in this Vignole, 
which is made all the better and fresher from a bold handful of mint and 
parsley.

Vinarola, or vingole, is a Roman stew that is cooked in April in Rome, and a 
little later here. It uses everything that is wonderful about this season. Mine 
is a little different from the classic Roman version as its topped with some 
crisp seedy bread and a lot of herbs instead of the traditional crowning of 
prosciutto. I will probably be in trouble with purists and Italians, but this 
dish is so good I didn’t want to stop making it when I stopped eating meat. 
It’s a celebration of the vegetables of the hour and the smoked salt and crisp 
cornered bits of bread add a depth that I think matches the classic version.


Serves 4 
8 small violet artichokes
350g fresh baby broad beans, double podded
1 leek, outer leaves removed, washed and shredded
200g spinach or chard, picked and washed
Extra virgin olive oil
2 small white onions, peeled and finely chopped
350g podded fresh peas
A few slices of good seeded bread
1 tsp salt (I use smoked salt here)
Black pepper
1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked
1 small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked
A few chive flowers, to serve (optional)

1 Put the artichokes into a pot of cold salted water and bring to the boil. 
Cook for about 10 minutes or until tender (check by inserting a knife into the 
heart to see if it is soft) and drain. Allow to cool, then peel back the outer 
leaves till you reach the pale tender ones and remove the choke using a 
teaspoon. Tear the hearts into quarters.

2 Fill the pot with water again, add some salt and bring to the boil. Blanch 
the broad beans for a minute, then remove from the water with a slotted spoon 
and drain. Blanch the spinach or chard until just wilted. Keep this water.

3 Preheat your oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Tear the bread on to a baking 
tray and drizzle with olive oil. Scatter liberally with salt, then put into the 
hot oven for 15 minutes to crisp up.

4 Heat a large saucepan, big enough to hold all the ingredients, and add a 
good splash of oil. Cook the onions and leeks very gently for about 10 minutes 
until soft, add the reserved vegetable cooking water along with the peas and 
broad beans, then bring back to a gentle simmer.

5 Stir the roughly chopped spinach or chard into the peas with the artichokes 
and the broad beans. Bring back to simmer and let all the vegetables stew 
together for about 10 more minutes.

6 Taste, season with smoked salt and pepper, stir together with almost all the 
chopped herbs and a good few lugs of olive oil. Serve with the crisped bread on 
top and finally the flowers, if you are using them, as well as the remaining 
herbs.
