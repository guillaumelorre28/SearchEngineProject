We Have Been Watching
8pm, Gold

New addition to the curious watching-people-watching-television genre. The 
twist in this case is that the people watching TV comedies have also acted in 
them themselves. The commentators – including Meera Syal, David Baddiel, Ralf 
Little and Ricky Tomlinson – are funny people, and their critiques and 
appreciations are well informed, even if some jumpy editing gets in the way.

No Offence
9pm, Channel 4

The return of Paul Abbott’s entertaining, comedy-tinged procedural drama sees 
Joanna Scanlan’s Viv come back from extended leave only to be plunged right 
into, er, the thick of it. As the extraordinary circumstances of an attempted 
murder at a funeral (an explosion, no less) become clear, a vicious set-to 
shapes up between rival gangleaders and their families. Paul Ritter’s forensics 
expert is a particular delight amid the carnage.David Stubbs

In this enjoyable opener, Alexander Armstrong and Dr Michael Scott travel to 
Il Bel Paese. A trip both cultural and geological, their visit to the bay of 
Naples uncovers fruity detail (“See Naples and die” was a reference to its 
18th-century syphilis problem) and physical marvels. Taking a break from 
strained banter, the pair visit the jawdropping network of tunnels created by 
the Bourbons, from which the city’s preferred building stone was also sourced.

Pop Quiz: The Comeback 
9.30pm, BBC4

One of the most reliable sources of delight on the BBC iPlayer is the small, 
rotating cache of early 80s Top of the Pops episodes. This two-part revival of 
the same era’s music quiz is a cheerful companion piece to those cherishable 
slices of pop culture, offering an opportunity to catch up – a few decades on – 
with the likes of Nick Heyward, Cheryl Baker, David Grant and Ranking Roger.

A Very British Brothel
10pm, Channel 4


The last time a Channel 4 documentary crew visited Sheffield’s City Sauna – a 
pub-turned-massage-parlour – they encountered pragmatic mother-daughter team 
Kath and Jenni, plus a couple of talkative regulars and a goldfish called Pimp. 
Now, more than a year later, business is booming to the extent that Kath is 
actively scouting for a second location, while also dealing with day-to-day 
problems such as damp in the lounge.Graeme Virtue

In Therapy: Coleen Nolan
10pm, Channel 5

The Nolans have publicly aired much of their family drama, so it’s no surprise 
that youngest sibling and long-serving Loose Woman Coleen Nolan has decided to 
book televised sessions with Channel 5’s resident therapist, Mandy Saligari. At 
first, such an intimate insight into a stranger’s life – albeit familiar from 
tabloid splashes – makes for uncomfortable viewing. But, like all car-crash TV, 
you’ll find you just can’t look away.Grace Rahman

Supernatural
10pm, E4

By this point, only the staunchest Supernaturaller will have the foggiest 
what’s going on, but a show doesn’t reach the wizened old age of 12 series 
without a few superfans occasionally updating its Wikipedia entry. This opener 
sees Sam withstanding “enhanced interrogation” of various hues at the hands of 
Toni, while Dean and the lads’ mum try to sniff him out. Meanwhile, Crowley is 
looking for Lucifer. As you do. Still nonsense, but of the ripely enjoyable 
sort.Luke Holland

Film choice


The Man Who Knew Too Much (Alfred Hitchcock, 1956), 11.20am, More4
Hitchcock’s glossy Technicolor remake of his own black-and-white 1934 British 
thriller stars James Stewart and Doris Day as a doctor and his wife holidaying 
in Morocco who have to sharpen up their act when their son is kidnapped. Many 
prefer the leaner, fun-filled original, but this grips, too – and has Day’s 
lovely rendition of Que Sera, Sera as a bonus.Paul Howlett
