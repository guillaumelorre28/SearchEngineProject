Vivid magenta, sky blue and a deep aquamarine are hardly colours that bring to 
mind the classical galleries of the Royal Academy inLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, but for this year’s Summer Exhibition 
– now in its 247th year – the bland white walls have been scrapped for an 
altogether jazzier colour scheme.


Dublin-born artist Michael Craig-Martin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/michael-craig-martin>, who is curator of 
this year’s event, has transformed three of the annual show’s central 
galleries, painting each a different bright shade of pink, blue or turquoise.

The unconventional design is a nod to the unconventional nature of the Summer 
Exhibition, which remains the world’s oldest art show, and this year received 
about 12,000 submission from professionals and amateurs alike – exhaustingly 
narrowed down by a panel to a final 1,200 works.

This year’s show features pieces as varied as an unseen drawing by Jasper Johns
 <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/johns>, sculpture by Anish Kapoor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kapoor> and Antony Gormley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gormley>, prints by Julian Opie and 
Tracey Emin <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin> and a bodice made 
entirely from human hair by Clancy Gebler Davies.

The works also spill out from beyond the confines of the gallery walls. One 
piece, a vast six-foot high sculpture made from steel byConrad Shawcross 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/conrad-shawcross>, dominates the RA 
courtyard, while a specially commissioned work by Turner-nominated Jim Lambie 
sees the gallery’s central staircase transformed into a multi-coloured artwork.

Craig-Martin said his first response to being asked to curate the enormous 
show was that he “didn’t want to do it at all”, adding: “There are few 
exhibitions of this scale so it is very demanding to look at and it is very 
demanding to hang and can be very demanding to make sense of without collapsing 
into a sense of confusion.”

His decision to paint the central galleries different vivid colours came from 
a desire simply to help viewers differentiate between the rooms and fully 
appreciate the plethora of artworks. The pink room, in particular, had raised a 
few eyebrows among the academicians, admitted the head of the Summer 
Exhibition, Edith Devaney, but they had all been delighted with the end result, 
she added.

As this year’s chief curator, Craig-Martin was also given the chance to invite 
artists of his choice to submit works, and he has used the opportunity to 
showcase older, often overlooked contemporary artists. His condition was simply 
that they had to be over 65 and still working.

“The art world is very focused on young emerging artists and I thought, well 
what about old emerging artists?” said Craig-Martin. “There are artists I have 
shown here who have had very distinguished careers and many of them used to be 
in the public eye much more than they are now. I saw this as an opportunity to 
bring audience attention to these artists and you certainly don’t go into that 
room and think, this is full of work by old people.”

Another distinct aspect of the Summer Exhibition is that the majority of the 
works, with a few exceptions, are for sale. Those looking for a bargain can 
snap up some of the smaller amateur pieces for around a few hundred pounds, but 
pieces from more established artists are at the pricier end of the scale. An 
enormous new tapestry byGrayson Perry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/grayson-perry>, depicting the 
fictional couple Julie and Rob for whom he recently designed a house in Essex, 
will set a buyer back £69,600, whileGary Hume 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gary-hume>’s painting The Blue Ground 
is priced at £138,000, and the five Gormley sculptures are £174,000 each.

For a unique end to the exhibition, Craig-Martin chose to give the final 
gallery over to a monumental piece byTom Phillips titled A Humument 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/20/tom-phillips-a-humument-birthday>
, which has been in the works for almost 50 years. Since 1966, Phillips has 
altered every page of a Victorian book published in 1892 called A Human 
Document, using intricate illustration, drawing, painting and collage to create 
an extensive work that he still continues to develop. The first 48 pages of the 
work have been publicly displayed for the first time as part of the show.

“It is wonderful to be able to show this here,” said Devaney. “We also hope it 
will mean Tom Phillips will finally get the attention he deserves. To have this 
work here for people to see I think will change things and will get people’s 
attention to his work at last. There’s nothing else quite like it.”
