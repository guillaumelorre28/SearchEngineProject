As an asylum seeker I can work – but not open a bank account

I am a 25-year-old asylum seeker. I have received a permit to work but can’t 
open a bank account because banks require my passport which is with the Home 
Office. What can I do?DB, London

In theory, banks should accept your IND Application Registration Card issued 
by the Home Office, along with proof of address, and confirmation of asylum 
support allowance or other income. In practice, bank staff are wary of 
paperwork that’s out of the ordinary.

Although asylum seekers are not normally allowed to work, the Refugee Council 
says that your plight is common. Banks frequently refuse to accept biometric 
resident permits as ID, even though the Home Office declares them valid proof. 
Proof of address is difficult if you are in Home Office accommodation with all 
bills paid.

The British Banking Association says banks accept a range of documents at 
their discretion. “The industry is keen to help refugees who have been offered 
asylum, while balancing the need to protect the financial system by undertaking 
thorough checks before opening accounts,” says a spokesperson. “Banks are 
working closely with various government agencies to establish how the process 
for refugees can be further improved.”
