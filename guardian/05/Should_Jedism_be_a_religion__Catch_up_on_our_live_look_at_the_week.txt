Christmas on Facebook v the reality of it: share your stories

Sarah Marsh

Christmas is a time of family gatherings, presents, overindulgence and cheesy 
films. In the modern age, what was once a relatively private affair is now a 
lot more public. The buildup is filled with festive selfies, andChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> day itself is spent taking 
pictures of food and snoozing relatives. But how much of what we share on our 
social media stream reflects reality?


We want to hear from our readers about their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram> lives during the festive 
period, compared with their real lives. How did you really feel when you took 
that photo of you out Christmas shopping in a Santa hat? Did the 
perfect-looking pudding you made actually taste as great as it looked?Tell us 
your stories, anonymously or otherwise here

Why Andy Martin, documenter of a changing Sunderland, has left his city

Karl Whitney

Karl Whitney is the author of Hidden City: Adventures and Explorations in 
Dublin (Penguin).

A few months ago, I heard that Andy Martin, a photographer from Sunderland, 
was leaving the city after many years documenting its streets and buildings. It 
felt like thetime to write about his work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/dec/21/sunderland-stranger-home-town-brexit-andy-martin>
. Martin’s photos have a haunting quality that, to my mind, capture a side of 
the city that speaks of both its industrial past and its haunted present. His 
pictures are the result of his nocturnal rambles through Sunderland, climbing 
into disused buildings: swimming pools, police stations, condemned blocks of 
flats. His photos are highly distinctive products of his own obsession with one 
city, while also gesturing towards a wider issue facing regional towns and 
cities: will regeneration be enough to counter the effects of increased 
austerity?

What hairdryer do you need this Christmas?

Samuel Gibbs

Testing hairdryers is a complicated business. Almost every one of them claims 
fancy things such as an “ultimate shine” or “effortless de-frizzing” with some 
promising to deliver cinema-quality hair in the time it takes to make a cup of 
tea. Sadly the reality is way different.
But when you sit down and actually use these things you realise that the end 
result relies on much more than just the machine – the hair type matters almost 
as much. Some hair types are a lot happier to sate than others. People with 
short hair can almost get away with much more than someone with tight, luscious 
locks.
When it came to putting five of the top-end hairdryers to the test, we had to 
assemble a group of testers capable of putting them through their paces for as 
many hair types and scenarios as possible. The results were surprising.
For instance, you’d expect every hairdryer costing £100 or more to come with 
every tool under the sun, but many lack a diffuser – essential for trying to 
dry tight curls. And then a dryer that suits one type of hair isn’t necessarily 
a winner for all.

Your underwhelming Christmas images

James Walsh

One of the weirder things I do at the Guardian is cultivate our underwhelming 
series, whereby readers send in pictures of stuff at the apex of averageness. 
So we’ve had underwhelming Halloween,underwhelming British holidays 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/14/british-holiday-pictures-rain-raining-rained>
,underwhelming ghosts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/19/your-top-10-worst-pictures-of-ghosts>
, andunderwhelming pictures of fog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/11/uk-fog-your-underwhelming-photos>
. Occasionally we ask for underwhelming pictures, andyou ignore us and send 
nice ones instead. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/britains-sunny-may-weekend-your-underwhelming-photos>


I started the series as I felt the middling, meh, and occasionally outright 
terrible photos sent in by our readers were just as worthy of attention as the 
good ones.


In a world increasingly dominated by worries about fake news, fake lives - or 
rather, the often idealised versions of our lives we choose to reveal on social 
media - is a phenomenon equally as worthy of attention. So how refreshing to 
see images that reveal the banality and occasional bleakness of modern 
existence.

Also, some of them are pretty funny.

It’s not late to send in your images 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/584e91a9e4b08659393bb82c> - our 
assignment will be open until it’s time to take the Christmas tree down to the 
skip.

Should Jedism be made an official religion?

Stuart Heritage

The Charity Commission for England and Wales has declared that Jedism isn’t a 
real religion. And, really, that’s probably best for everyone.

I can see why people wanted it to be a religion. After all, since Jedism is 
largely a hodgepodge of hooey platitudes about supernatural forces and eternal 
life, it shares a lot in common with almost all major religions.

But just imagine if the commission had granted its application. Then Jedism 
would have become areligion, with leaders and dogma and fundamentalists and 
guilt. It would stop being fun almost instantly. Let’s just keep Star Wars as a 
receptacle for space monsters and laserguns, OK?

Is the US death penalty on its way out?

Ed Pilkington

This week I reported on the health of the US death penalty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/21/death-penalty-end-2016-report>
, and concluded that it was very sick indeed, arguably on its way out. 
Executions, as well as new death sentences, are at historic lows. The piece 
prompted interesting emails from people who questioned whether I was being too 
optimistic in saying capital punishment in the US is dying, given the history. 
They have a point. In the 1970s the death penalty was ended for four years by 
the US supreme court, but in 1976 it was allowed to start again and it came 
back with a vengeance. The emails made me think that maybe we are in another 
temporary lull. The death penalty ain’t over til it’s over, and until it is, 
those who care about human rights need to remain vigilant.

I love Christmas with all the trimmings. But if I want to still fit in my 
wheelchair, and to be able to transfer (stand up and move from wheelchair to 
seat etc) safely, I need to be careful what I eat on every day of the year.

You go right ahead and eat whatever you choose at Christmas time. But please, 
don't try to bully me to match what you eat (I'm looking at you, work 
colleagues at Christmas lunch). It should be OK for me to eat what I choose at 
Christmas time too.

I'm not a big fan of the trimmings. They just clutter up the plate, and take 
up valuable room that would be better utilised by roasties.
Of them all, I dislike pigs in blankets the most. Always too greasy and salty 
for my taste.

Calories at Christmas? As somebody who, in everyday life, is - how shall I put 
it? - no stranger to the dessert trolley, it's not impossible that I will lose 
weight at Christmas. Seriously!

I stay at home and get some treats but I don't do the big meal. A few years 
ago I just couldn't be arsed to cook so headed straight for the cheeseboard. 
(Cheese is my favourite food anyway.) So now I buy a few things I want and 
that's it. So, Christmas Day is basically a cheese and wine party for me.

It's great getting to the end of Christmas Day and still being able to move.

The picture desk's photographer of the year

Joanna Ruck

This year we have received around 12 million photographs to the Guardian 
picture desk, between us we will have looked at every one of those. Despite the 
huge numbers, certain photographers consistently catch your attention. We 
started our Photographer of the Year award four years ago to recognise the 
outstanding work done by photojournalists everywhere. This year we had a
shortlist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ng-interactive/2016/dec/09/agency-photographer-of-the-year-2016-shortlist-trump-refugees-and-the-battle-for-mosul>
 of 12 amazing people butCarl Court 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/21/guardian-photographer-of-the-year-2016-carl-court>
 had stood out to us all year. He was also one of our most published 
photographers throughout the year, due to the sheer variety of subjects he 
covered and the consistently high standard of his work.

Christmas listening

Martin Belam

I’m not going to lie. I am a big fan of Christmas songs - and the cheesier the 
better. Earlier this week we were driving to visit some friends in Kent, and it 
was a chance for me to dig out my massive Christmas playlist and get the kids 
singing along in the back of the car. As well as the usual suspects, I’ve also 
been trying to expand their understanding of Christmas music with some more 
recent efforts, like The FutureheadsChristmas Was Better in the 80’s 
<https://play.spotify.com/track/4qDTEW5gjiEU3zBmFvxSFv>, Erasure’s Snow Globe 
album <https://play.spotify.com/album/6aBxPFFWxzrJFIKtw9Ox2g>, and the 
ridiculously nostalgicA Christmas We Deserve 
<https://play.spotify.com/track/1ms5SGefaAdijcPMfab8Hp>, which ABC released 
this year.

But if you want a more relaxing Christmas listen, then can I point you in the 
direction ofa series of classical Christmas playlists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/christmas-playlists> that the 
Guardian put together a couple of years ago? We askedtrumpeter Alison Balsom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/15/alison-balsom-christmas-playlist>
,pianist Stephen Hough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/16/stephen-hough-christmas-playlist>
,tenor Ian Bostridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/17/ian-bostridge-christmas-playlist>
,mezzo Sarah Connolly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/18/sarah-connollys-christmas-playlist>
,the King’s Singers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/22/the-kings-singers-christmas-playlist>
 andthe legendary John Rutter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/19/john-rutter-christmas-playlist>
 to pick their festive favourites. It’s a lovely change of pace.

And while listening to those, why not marvel at this delightful over-analysis 
of whether Stay Another Day by East 17 is actually a Christmas song

Christmas is the one day you can indulge without any guilt, I like to eat 
about 20,000 calories, go heavy on the bread sauce, then smash through a gram 
of top quality coke and sleep with my sister in law. Guilt free.

Even at 51 I still get excited about Christmas. But then I feel all let down. 
Last year mutha bought me some wine glasses from Morrisons. She didn't even 
bother wrapping them, just left them in the carrier with the price still on 
(3.99 or thereabouts). I died a little inside - more to do with mutha just not 
caring about stuff now (she's 89) rather than the actual prezzie.

Who counts calories on Christmas day?

Alexandra Topping

When one of my editors on the news desk asked me to write a story about the 
calories in a typical Christmas dinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/21/counting-calories-this-christmas-beware-the-pigs-in-blankets>
, I must admit the idea did not fill me with festive cheer. Indeed, it’s 
possible I called him a grinch. Who cares how many calories you consume on 
Christmas day? Who can clear their head long enough from the roastie binge haze 
to even tot them up? I am not a calorie counter, but writing this piece did 
give me pause for thought. It was the pigs in blankets that got me – a whopping 
58 calories per little pig. Normally I wouldn’t think twice about wolfing down 
half a packet, but maybe this year will now be different. Four max. Ok, maybe 
five. Will knowing how many calories you’re consuming make you hold back this 
year?

We are officially heading off for Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, have a great next few 
days everyone!
 
Christmas is a time of family gatherings, presents, overindulgence and cheesy 
films. In the modern age, what was once a relatively private affair is now a 
lot more public. The buildup is filled with festive selfies, andChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> day itself is spent taking 
pictures of food and snoozing relatives. But how much of what we share on our 
social media stream reflects reality?


We want to hear from our readers about their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram> lives during the festive 
period, compared with their real lives. How did you really feel when you took 
that photo of you out Christmas shopping in a Santa hat? Did the 
perfect-looking pudding you made actually taste as great as it looked?Tell us

Karl Whitney is the author of Hidden City: Adventures and Explorations in 
Dublin (Penguin).

A few months ago, I heard that Andy Martin, a photographer from Sunderland, 
was leaving the city after many years documenting its streets and buildings. It 
felt like thetime to write about his work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/dec/21/sunderland-stranger-home-town-brexit-andy-martin>
. Martin’s photos have a haunting quality that, to my mind, capture a side of 
the city that speaks of both its industrial past and its haunted present. His 
pictures are the result of his nocturnal rambles through Sunderland, climbing 
into disused buildings: swimming pools, police stations, condemned blocks of 
flats. His photos are highly distinctive products of his own obsession with one 
city, while also gesturing towards a wider issue facing regional towns and 
cities: will regeneration be enough to counter the effects of increased 
austerity?

Testing hairdryers is a complicated business. Almost every one of them claims 
fancy things such as an “ultimate shine” or “effortless de-frizzing” with some 
promising to deliver cinema-quality hair in the time it takes to make a cup of 
tea. Sadly the reality is way different.
But when you sit down and actually use these things you realise that the end 
result relies on much more than just the machine – the hair type matters almost 
as much. Some hair types are a lot happier to sate than others. People with 
short hair can almost get away with much more than someone with tight, luscious 
locks.
When it came to putting five of the top-end hairdryers to the test, we had to 
assemble a group of testers capable of putting them through their paces for as 
many hair types and scenarios as possible. The results were surprising.
For instance, you’d expect every hairdryer costing £100 or more to come with 
every tool under the sun, but many lack a diffuser – essential for trying to 
dry tight curls. And then a dryer that suits one type of hair isn’t necessarily 
a winner for all.

One of the weirder things I do at the Guardian is cultivate our underwhelming 
series, whereby readers send in pictures of stuff at the apex of averageness. 
So we’ve had underwhelming Halloween,underwhelming British holidays 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/14/british-holiday-pictures-rain-raining-rained>

, andunderwhelming pictures of fog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/11/uk-fog-your-underwhelming-photos>
. Occasionally we ask for underwhelming pictures, andyou ignore us and send 
nice ones instead. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/britains-sunny-may-weekend-your-underwhelming-photos>


I started the series as I felt the middling, meh, and occasionally outright 
terrible photos sent in by our readers were just as worthy of attention as the 
good ones.


In a world increasingly dominated by worries about fake news, fake lives - or 
rather, the often idealised versions of our lives we choose to reveal on social 
media - is a phenomenon equally as worthy of attention. So how refreshing to 
see images that reveal the banality and occasional bleakness of modern 
existence.

Also, some of them are pretty funny.

The Jedism question has certainly divided us 

 Photograph: Sarah Marsh  
The Charity Commission for England and Wales has declared that Jedism isn’t a 
real religion. And, really, that’s probably best for everyone.

I can see why people wanted it to be a religion. After all, since Jedism is 
largely a hodgepodge of hooey platitudes about supernatural forces and eternal 
life, it shares a lot in common with almost all major religions.

But just imagine if the commission had granted its application. Then Jedism 
would have become areligion, with leaders and dogma and fundamentalists and 
guilt. It would stop being fun almost instantly. Let’s just keep Star Wars as a 
receptacle for space monsters and laserguns, OK?

This week I reported on the health of the US death penalty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/21/death-penalty-end-2016-report>
, and concluded that it was very sick indeed, arguably on its way out. 
Executions, as well as new death sentences, are at historic lows. The piece 
prompted interesting emails from people who questioned whether I was being too 
optimistic in saying capital punishment in the US is dying, given the history. 
They have a point. In the 1970s the death penalty was ended for four years by 
the US supreme court, but in 1976 it was allowed to start again and it came 
back with a vengeance. The emails made me think that maybe we are in another 
temporary lull. The death penalty ain’t over til it’s over, and until it is, 
those who care about human rights need to remain vigilant.

Happy Christmas all. And thanks to Martin, Sarah, Matthew and Rachel for some

I love Christmas with all the trimmings. But if I want to still fit in my 
wheelchair, and to be able to transfer (stand up and move from wheelchair to 
seat etc) safely, I need to be careful what I eat on every day of the year.

You go right ahead and eat whatever you choose at Christmas time. But please, 
don't try to bully me to match what you eat (I'm looking at you, work 
colleagues at Christmas lunch). It should be OK for me to eat what I choose at 
Christmas time too.

If I knew how many calories I consumed on christmas day there would be a two

I'm not a big fan of the trimmings. They just clutter up the plate, and take 
up valuable room that would be better utilised by roasties.
Of them all, I dislike pigs in blankets the most. Always too greasy and salty 
for my taste.

Turkey does not stimulate salivary glands and I don't eat it. I don't mind 
putting on 10,000 calories but I draw the line with a regrettable meat that 
resembles chewing sawdust.

Calories at Christmas? As somebody who, in everyday life, is - how shall I put 
it? - no stranger to the dessert trolley, it's not impossible that I will lose 
weight at Christmas. Seriously!

I stay at home and get some treats but I don't do the big meal. A few years 
ago I just couldn't be arsed to cook so headed straight for the cheeseboard. 
(Cheese is my favourite food anyway.) So now I buy a few things I want and 
that's it. So, Christmas Day is basically a cheese and wine party for me.

It's great getting to the end of Christmas Day and still being able to move.
 
This year we have received around 12 million photographs to the Guardian 
picture desk, between us we will have looked at every one of those. Despite the 
huge numbers, certain photographers consistently catch your attention. We 
started our Photographer of the Year award four years ago to recognise the 
outstanding work done by photojournalists everywhere. This year we had a
shortlist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ng-interactive/2016/dec/09/agency-photographer-of-the-year-2016-shortlist-trump-refugees-and-the-battle-for-mosul>
 of 12 amazing people butCarl Court 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/21/guardian-photographer-of-the-year-2016-carl-court>
 had stood out to us all year. He was also one of our most published 
photographers throughout the year, due to the sheer variety of subjects he 
covered and the consistently high standard of his work.

What’s been your favourite photo so far this year? Let us know in the comments.

 
I’m not going to lie. I am a big fan of Christmas songs - and the cheesier the 
better. Earlier this week we were driving to visit some friends in Kent, and it 
was a chance for me to dig out my massive Christmas playlist and get the kids 
singing along in the back of the car. As well as the usual suspects, I’ve also 
been trying to expand their understanding of Christmas music with some more 
recent efforts, like The FutureheadsChristmas Was Better in the 80’s 
<https://play.spotify.com/track/4qDTEW5gjiEU3zBmFvxSFv>, Erasure’s Snow Globe 
album <https://play.spotify.com/album/6aBxPFFWxzrJFIKtw9Ox2g>, and the 
ridiculously nostalgicA Christmas We Deserve 
<https://play.spotify.com/track/1ms5SGefaAdijcPMfab8Hp>, which ABC released 
this year.

But if you want a more relaxing Christmas listen, then can I point you in the 
direction ofa series of classical Christmas playlists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/christmas-playlists> that the 
Guardian put together a couple of years ago? We askedtrumpeter Alison Balsom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/15/alison-balsom-christmas-playlist>
,pianist Stephen Hough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/16/stephen-hough-christmas-playlist>
,tenor Ian Bostridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/17/ian-bostridge-christmas-playlist>
,mezzo Sarah Connolly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/18/sarah-connollys-christmas-playlist>
,the King’s Singers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/22/the-kings-singers-christmas-playlist>
 andthe legendary John Rutter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/19/john-rutter-christmas-playlist>
 to pick their festive favourites. It’s a lovely change of pace.

And while listening to those, why not marvel at this delightful over-analysis 
of whether Stay Another Day by East 17 is actually a Christmas song

Calories!, at nearer 80yrs than 70yrs I don't give a toss and a very merry

Christmas is the one day you can indulge without any guilt, I like to eat 
about 20,000 calories, go heavy on the bread sauce, then smash through a gram 
of top quality coke and sleep with my sister in law. Guilt free.

Even at 51 I still get excited about Christmas. But then I feel all let down. 
Last year mutha bought me some wine glasses from Morrisons. She didn't even 
bother wrapping them, just left them in the carrier with the price still on 
(3.99 or thereabouts). I died a little inside - more to do with mutha just not 
caring about stuff now (she's 89) rather than the actual prezzie.
 
When one of my editors on the news desk asked me to write a story about the 
calories in a typical Christmas dinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/21/counting-calories-this-christmas-beware-the-pigs-in-blankets>
, I must admit the idea did not fill me with festive cheer. Indeed, it’s 
possible I called him a grinch. Who cares how many calories you consume on 
Christmas day? Who can clear their head long enough from the roastie binge haze 
to even tot them up? I am not a calorie counter, but writing this piece did 
give me pause for thought. It was the pigs in blankets that got me – a whopping 
58 calories per little pig. Normally I wouldn’t think twice about wolfing down 
half a packet, but maybe this year will now be different. Four max. Ok, maybe 
five. Will knowing how many calories you’re consuming make you hold back this 
year?
