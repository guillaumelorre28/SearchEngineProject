The UK housing market could see a credit boom like that of the early 2000s and 
see annual prices increase by almost 7% if interest rates are kept on hold in 
2016, one of the world’s biggest banks has warned.

Researchers at BNP Paribas <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bnp-paribas> 
said that while the deferral of a rate rise until 2017 might seem like good 
news for homeowners, it could lead to higher prices and force the Bank of 
England to act to restrict mortgage lending.

The bank said it expected house prices in the UK to rise by 4.4% in 2016 if 
the base rate started to rise slowly from its current level of 0.5%, and that 
this would be followed by a 6.7% rise in 2017.

This level of growth would see the average house price, as measured on 
Nationwide’s monthly index, rise from £197,582 in December 2015 to £206,256 by 
the end of 2016, and £220,116 a year later.

BNP Paribas said that improved household finances and confidence in the 
economy would bolster demand for homes, and prices paid, but the lack of supply 
of property for sale remained “a serious concern”.


If the base rate rise is delayed, the bank said prices could rise by 6.9% in 
2016 and by 11.5% in 2017, increasing prices to £211,215 then £235,500 
respectively.

Adrian Owen, head of residential at BNP Paribas Real Estate, said: “While on 
the face of it a deferral would be good news for homeowners, we believe this 
scenario is a cautionary tale for the UK economy as a whole.

“There is already concern at the Bank of England over the pace of house price 
growth, and while the current lack of housing supply is a significant driver, 
the sustained low cost of finance is also a major contributor.”


Mortgage rates <https://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgage-rates> have fallen 
to record lows this year, with the average rate on a two-year fixed-rate 
mortgage at 75% of a property’s value now at just 1.87%, and the average 
five-year deal at 2.78%.

In some areas of the country house prices are now at a higher multiple of 
earnings than ever before, although intervention by theBank of England in 2014 
has reduced the amount of lending that is being done

 at more than four-and-a-half times an applicant’s salary.

The Bank of England’s governor, Mark Carney, has indicated that rates could 
stay on hold until well into 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/interest-rate-bank-of-england-leave-record-low-decision>
and that other measures may be needed to cool the market.

Owen said: “Even under our central scenario that base rates rise next year, it 
is likely that the Bank of England will seek to place a brake on house price 
growth by introducing further restrictions on the availability of finance.

“This may achieve the desired dampening effect, although does not address the 
underlying structural issue in the market of insufficient supply.”

The researchers predict that across the UK house prices will increase by 
almost 27% by the end of 2019. In the south-west of England they said prices 
could grow by 40.2% by 2020, while in the south-east (excluding London) the 
increase could be 36.1%. In London prices are expected to grow by 25.1% over 
the period.

George Osborne’s announcement that buyers of any kind of second property will 
face a 3% stamp duty surcharge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-unveils-his-bold-plan-to-tackle-housing-crisis>
has been factored into the forecasts. The researchers found the move would have 
little national impact, but would dampen house price growth in regional town 
centres and in London. They said that as a result they had reduced expectations 
for price rises in London in 2016 from 5.6% to 4.7%.

As a result, their forecast for the average price of a London home in 12 
months time has been cut by £5,000 to £468,893.
