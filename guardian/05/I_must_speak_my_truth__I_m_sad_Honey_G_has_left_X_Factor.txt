This isn’t a sentiment I was expecting to express, and I can’t blame you if it 
makes you angry. However, it is my truth and I will speak it: I’m a bit sad 
that Honey Gisn’t on X Factor any more 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5HPb22-vP0>.


Wait, hear me out. This doesn’t mean that I liked Honey G. Never in a trillion 
years – even if it cured all illness, reversed Brexit and brought Alan Rickman 
back to life – would I willingly listen to Honey G’s recorded output. Because I 
already know what it’d sound like. It’d sound like a recently divorced 
recruitment consultant from Berkshire trying to drunkenly displace their pain 
by shouting the Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme tune at a policeman outside a 
Nando’s on a Thursday night.


But at least her presence managed to artificially inflate the rest of X 
Factor. Now that she’s gone, and there’s nobody left to angrily befuddle us, we 
have to wake up to the terrible realisation that one of these other bozos has 
to win.

And that’s sad, because the remaining acts are arguably the least gifted in 
all of X Factor history. Given that previous semi-finalists have included 
Journey South, Leon Jackson, Eoghan Quigg and Christopher Maloney, this is 
really saying something. Either 5 After Midnight, Saara Aalto, Emily Middlemas 
or Matt Terry will be crowned victor of X Factor 2016. Two of them are 
mannequins brought half to life by a concussed professor, one is a boyband that 
collectively sounds like a documentary about cattery abuse, and the other is 
Saara Aalto. That any of them have made it this far is an indictment of what X 
Factor has become.

Oh, sure, that might not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, since X 
Factor winners now routinely vanish from view. But people still watch it. 
They’re going to watch the final four episodes – which, since this is X Factor, 
will take up between six and 12 hours of their lives – and realise that they’ve 
binned the only contestant capable of making them feel anything.

Honey G is destined to spend the rest of her life intoning the phrase “When I 
say Honey, you say G” at scattered crowds of holiday camp visitors, and that’s 
probably deserved. Whichever way you slice it, Honey G does not belong in the 
semi-final of a talent contest.

But X Factor isn’t a talent contest. It’s just wallpaper now, a framework 
designed to prop up reams of Christmas adverts. Nobody left in the competition 
will become a star. Judging by last year, no one even bothers to buy the 
winners’ single any more. X Factor hasn’t even pretended to be interested in 
star-making for half a decade now. And you’ve kicked out the only act who 
wasn’t a ceaselessly one-note demonstration of almost-adequacy. For shame.

Whoever wins X Factor now will help maintain that cycle of tedium. But if 
Honey G had won, she’d have blown the whole thing up. And surely that would 
have been a win for everybody.
