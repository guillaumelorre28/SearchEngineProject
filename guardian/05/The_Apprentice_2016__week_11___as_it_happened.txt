The flash forward to Sunday (the final) does not fill me with optimism as 
Courtney demonstrates his trophy baby beaker. He needs to stop with the weird 
infant drinking receptacles. He’s freaking me out.

Anyway! There are your finalists. And although I sadly won’t be able to join 
you on Sunday, you’ll be in the capable charge of Heidi Stephens. So join her 
at 9pm for all the fun of the fair. Well, of the Apprentice final.

And thanks for being here! I need a bath and two weeks of de-programming as 
usual. Find me on Twitter @jnraeside and good night!

Alanna is in tears, Courtney actually cracks his first full smile of the 
series.

In the cab of doom, Frances tries to put a cheerful face on her bitter 
disappointment. And the other two share a jovial people carrier back to the 
house. Courtney taunts Alanna about her nest egg. She tells him her heels are 
dug firmly into the ground and she means to crush him. It is so on.

Alanna is in the final. Repeat, Alanna is in the final.

Courtney talks down the other two while describing his products as unique. 
Yes, that’s the word for his bizarre champagne baby bottle. What a brain he’s 
got to come up with that.

They go out. They come back in. Alan gives them one more completely 
superfluous going over just to spin out the tension for a bit longer.

Who is it going to be? Cakes? Gifts? Kids’ clothes?

Could Courtney actually win this? More than anyone else, he seems to inspire 
sympathy in the mentors. They all want to coax the fight out of him.

This is the moving finger bit. He hops from one to the next, saying why he 
doesn’t like each one.

But he’s settling on Jessica. She starts to babble and fight and hustle. But 
it doesn’t work. She’s out. Jessica is out before the final.

So our three finalists are Alanna, Courtney and Frances. Who bet on these 
three?

Frances’ kiddies’ shops next. He says it’s a wild idea based on unpredictable 
end-of-line stock and he expresses general doubts about her “handbag” filing 
system. In person she’s convincing but he’d rather focus on one silly remark 
made six months ago.

And now onto Jess. Alan says she got the personality but the music is turning 
sad.

He moans on at her about not reinvesting her own money in the business because 
she fecklessly wanted to save for her own house.

Courtney’s turn to get it now. So he’s going to dance about as usual, keeping 
us guessing. I’m pretty sure he’ll keep Courtney in the final because he does 
love an inventor. Alan doesn’t do ideas. He wants an ideas person.

That’s right, never start anything. You’ll never make it. That’s the attitude.

For this bit in the boardroom, they might as well play charades. From week 
one, he’ll have identified which business idea is a goer and the rest of the 12 
weeks is just farting around in mermaid costumes.

Never the less, we’ve all bothered to follow it this far, so ignore the 
elephant in the room and back to the fray. Alan is running through each 
business pitch in more detail. Grainne says she wants her own make-up brand and 
Sugar scoffs that she fancies herself as the new Mac.

The flash forward to Sunday (the final) does not fill me with optimism as 
Courtney demonstrates his trophy baby beaker. He needs to stop with the weird 
infant drinking receptacles. He’s freaking me out.

Anyway! There are your finalists. And although I sadly won’t be able to join 
you on Sunday, you’ll be in the capable charge of Heidi Stephens. So join her 
at 9pm for all the fun of the fair. Well, of the Apprentice final.

And thanks for being here! I need a bath and two weeks of de-programming as 
usual. Find me on Twitter @jnraeside and good night!
 
Alanna is in tears, Courtney actually cracks his first full smile of the 
series.

In the cab of doom, Frances tries to put a cheerful face on her bitter 
disappointment. And the other two share a jovial people carrier back to the 
house. Courtney taunts Alanna about her nest egg. She tells him her heels are 
dug firmly into the ground and she means to crush him. It is so on.
 
And she’s in the final with....

No more music, please. Just tell us. Frances, Frances.....gets the boot! 
Courtney vs Alanna for the final. I’m 100% convinced that Courtney is going to 
win.
 
Sad music, sad music, sad music.........

He’s really struggling to pad this til the music cue catches up with him. 
Alanna is in the final. Repeat, Alanna is in the final.
 
Courtney talks down the other two while describing his products as unique. 
Yes, that’s the word for his bizarre champagne baby bottle. What a brain he’s 
got to come up with that.
 
They go out. They come back in. Alan gives them one more completely 
superfluous going over just to spin out the tension for a bit longer.

Who is it going to be? Cakes? Gifts? Kids’ clothes?
 
Ah yes, I see. We still have to lose one more dufus. 
 
Could Courtney actually win this? More than anyone else, he seems to inspire 
sympathy in the mentors. They all want to coax the fight out of him.
 
This is the moving finger bit. He hops from one to the next, saying why he 
doesn’t like each one.

But he’s settling on Jessica. She starts to babble and fight and hustle. But 
it doesn’t work. She’s out. Jessica is out before the final.

So our three finalists are Alanna, Courtney and Frances. Who bet on these 
three?
 
Frances’ kiddies’ shops next. He says it’s a wild idea based on unpredictable 
end-of-line stock and he expresses general doubts about her “handbag” filing 
system. In person she’s convincing but he’d rather focus on one silly remark 
made six months ago.

And now onto Jess. Alan says she got the personality but the music is turning 
sad.
 
He moans on at her about not reinvesting her own money in the business because 
she fecklessly wanted to save for her own house.

Courtney’s turn to get it now. So he’s going to dance about as usual, keeping 
us guessing. I’m pretty sure he’ll keep Courtney in the final because he does 
love an inventor. Alan doesn’t do ideas. He wants an ideas person.
 
He turns his attention to Alanna and her little cake business. Oh spare us the 
post mortem, Alan. It’s obvious he’s going to bin her from a great height.
 
That’s right, never start anything. You’ll never make it. That’s the attitude. 
Even he doesn’t believe this nonsense. Alan breaks it to her gently but he 
tells Grainne.....

You’re fired. Good bye, Grainne.
 
For this bit in the boardroom, they might as well play charades. From week 
one, he’ll have identified which business idea is a goer and the rest of the 12 
weeks is just farting around in mermaid costumes.

Never the less, we’ve all bothered to follow it this far, so ignore the 
elephant in the room and back to the fray. Alan is running through each 
business pitch in more detail. Grainne says she wants her own make-up brand and 
Sugar scoffs that she fancies herself as the new Mac.
 
The millionaires are dismissed and the famous five are summoned to face their 
Waterloo. Good god, the hair. So shiny. Can I touch it?
 
Alanna hopes to scatter her cakes throughout the independent delicatessens of 
the nation. The panel don’t know how she’s going to find out where these delis 
are. Should we tell them about the internet?
 
Frances’ kids’ clothes shops sound like money-spinners but they talk down her 
business plan and say she never really thought she’d get this far.
