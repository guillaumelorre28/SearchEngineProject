“This is so awkward, I just feel really awkward,” says actor-turned-singer 
Raleigh Ritchie as he sits down for wings, chips and an invasive chat about his 
personal life with presenter Amelia Dimoldenberg. The Londoner’s dry sense of 
humour and inquisitive interview style is enough to leave anyone a little on 
edge – and herein lies the charm of this irreverent webseries, which has 
featured “dates” with People Just Do Nothing’s Chabuddy G and hip-hopper Fuse 
ODG among others.

A Dot’s Story Of Grime
UK grime has risen and risen in recent years to become one of the nation’s 
most successful musical genres. Pioneered by the likes of Dizzee Rascal, Kano 
and Boy Better Know, and continued by a new generation that includes Stormzy, 
Novelist and AJ Tracey, today grime ranges from pirate radio-ish tracks with 
dark, drum-heavy instrumentals to chart-ready hits, but generally sticks around 
that recognisable 140bpm. This new doc – part of the BBC’s Black And British 
season – gets into its nuts and bolts, with 1Xtra’s A Dot organising a grime 
clash with backing from the likes of Lord Of The Mic founder and BBK member 
Jammer.

Just when it seemed that we couldn’t possibly lose any more musical greats 
before the end of 2016, on 7 November the world said so long to Leonard Cohen. 
Although the Canadian singer, songwriter and poet’s most known work will likely 
remain Hallelujah – which he wrote and rewrote for five long years – he also 
gave the world 14 studio albums, ranging from acoustic folk to 80s electronica. 
This long-lost documentary, unearthed and remastered by its creator Tony Palmer 
back in 2010, is a candid, moving account of Cohen’s life on the road back in 
the early 70s. Following its recent BBC4 airing, you’ll find it on iPlayer for 
a few weeks.

3%
Netflix’s first Brazilian original is a futuristic thriller seeking to 
conflate The Hunger Games’s YA dystopianism and Westworld’s “what is actually 
going on here?” water-cooler buzz. All but 97% of the population live destitute 
on the mainland, while the supposed cream of society are permitted to live 
offshore on an island, enjoying “luxuries” such as food, healthcare and 
showering facilities. This 3% is determined through rigorous testing: imagine 
Myers-Briggs, only with results that are more RIP than ENTP. Arriving into an 
admittedly crowded near-future TV marketplace, it nonetheless looks intriguing.
