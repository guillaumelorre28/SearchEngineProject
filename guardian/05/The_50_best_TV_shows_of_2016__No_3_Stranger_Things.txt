The key ingredients barely need repeating. The Duffer brothers took the best 
of 80s pop culture – elements of John Carpenter, Steph(v)ens King and Spielberg 
– shoved them in with Dungeons & Dragons,New Order

<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/aug/10/from-heathers-to-stranger-things-winona-ryders-best-looks>
, and ended up with an algorithm-busting, genre-melding, word-of-mouth smash. 
From the deep-dive discussion of the plot to thesoundtrack 
<http://www.what-song.com/Tvshow/173/Stranger-Things/s/666>, the title 
graphics, the endless memes and a new star in the shape of Millie Bobby Brown, 
Stranger Things provided a genuine 2016 TV moment.

Set in the fictional Indiana town of Hawkins 
<http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/stranger-things-filming-locations-are-just-as-spooky-in-real-life>
, Stranger Things is the story of the mysterious disappearance of Will Byers,

 nerds. It quickly spread its narrative out over eight episodes into 
string-theory-twisting sci-fi horror via real-life CIA conspiracy thriller with 
a side of high-school romance.

What’s interesting about the Duffers’ vision is that their nostalgia for the 
80s is secondhand. They were born in 1984, so their depiction of the era is 
told through a language learned from VHS tapes and old records. It’s 90s kids 
giving us their version of an 80s where 11-year-olds were free to ride their 
BMXs around pitch-dark towns; where parents wouldn’t notice if their children 
sneaked an escapee from a government black-ops experiment in to live in the 
basement. If you grew up watchingET

world that’s a long way from today’s helicopter-parentedGen Zs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/10/generation-z-latest-data-teens>
. But it’s not like you had to be steeped in the intricacies of Dungeons & 
Dragons to lap up its love of its period. (What actually is aDemogorgon 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demogorgon_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)>?) 

Stranger Things <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stranger-things> 
triumphed on two key fronts. Its plot whipped viewers through the series, 
delivering a narrative cycle as satisfying as the first season of Twin Peaks. 
(Though, one wonders if a second series will also struggle to deliver in the 
same way that Lynch’s did.) But it was the performances that really made it 
hard not to binge episode after episode in a spooky Netflix haze.

Leading the way were the four (then three) nerdy boys – particularly the 
wonderful Gaten Matarazzo – who managed to combine doctoral-level physics with 
basic compassion in the hunt for their friend. Then aFreaks and Geeks

-like dynamic of younger and older high-school kids was added with the dark, 
non-love triangle between Natalia Dyer’s Nancy, Joe Deery’s Steve and Charlie 
Heaton’s Jonathan. And that was a nod to the kind of 80s movies starred in by 
Ryder – whose bereft, mad-not-mad Joyce, Will’s mother, confirmed the TV 
rebirth hinted at by her turn in David Simon’s Show Me a Hero in 2015.

But the breakout star ended up being English actor Millie Bobby Brown as the 
shaven-headed psychokinetically-powered Eleven. An escapee from a government 
facility’s MKUltra-style experiments, her abilities powered the entire story. 
Brown’s intense performance (undercut slightly if you happened to land on the 
videos of hersinging Amy Winehouse songs on YouTube 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOfpUO_1L4c>) made her the face of the show. 
At just 12, she has the makings of a superstar.

After a terrifying first episode, Stranger Things became gradually less scary 
as it unfolded and explained (or sort of explained) its secrets. But it still 
contained a moment that had this viewer considering going to bed with the 
lights on – andnot the fairy lights in the living room 
<http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/make-a-stranger-things-christmas-light-message.html>
. Let’s just say that many of uswill never listen to Should I Stay Or Should I 
Go? in an empty house again <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZHqhjkIMg>. 


At the end, we learned of Will’s fate. (Though it’s not exactly clear what 
happened to Barb 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/barb-stranger-things-popularity>.) 
We also got a final scene suggesting that we’ve not seen the last of the 
creatures from the Upside Down. Given the year 2017 isshaping 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump> up 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37532364> to 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2017> be 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2017>, the idea of 
slipping into a pitch-black parallel reality filled with demons might not be 
the strangest thing in the world.
