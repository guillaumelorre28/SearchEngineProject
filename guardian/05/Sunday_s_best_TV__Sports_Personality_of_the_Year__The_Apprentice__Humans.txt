Sports Personality of the Year 
6.40pm, BBC1

A particularly difficult year to call, this one. The 2015 winner Andy Murray’s 
remarkable achievements at Wimbledon would surely guarantee a gong any other 
year, yet 2016 also boasts Mo Farah, Laura Kenny and the rest of Team GB’s 
panoply of Rio success stories. Live from Birmingham’s Genting Arena, Gabby 
Logan, Gary Lineker and Clare Balding host an event that quite rightly lets 
British sport pat itself on the back.Luke Holland

Danielle De Niese: The Birth of an Opera 
7pm, BBC4

Australian-American soprano De Niese is both star in, and host of, this 
avowedly warts-and-all look at Glyndebourne’s recent production of Rossini’s 
famous comic opera, The Barber Of Seville (broadcast afterwards). She is a 
pleasant host and clearly a diligent professional but, for all the glimpses 
behind the curtain, you leave with the impression that this is the authorised 
version, inside which a rather more interesting film is hiding.John Robinson

The Apprentice 
9pm, BBC1

A surprisingly cordial final, fought between two candidates who share a not 
very Apprentice-like weakness: low confidence. Puppyish Courtney can’t pick a 
name for his novelty gifts firm (“Bingo Bongo… Ringo Dingo?”) and needs 
intensive Rada training before a presentation, while quietly determined Alana 
isn’t bold enough in branding her gooey homemade cakes. At the final showdown 
in City Hall, they both look one fumbled PowerPoint slide away from tears.Jack 
Seale

Humans 
9pm, Channel 4

After a corker of a second series, it’s time to bid farewell to the synth 
chums. Troublemaking duo Niska (Emily Berrington) and Astrid (Bella Dayne) are 
preparing to go back to Berlin, but will family ties scupper their plans? Leo 
is in danger as Hester is out for revenge, and there’s trouble for Joe and 
Laura (the excellent Tom Goodman-Hill and Katherine Parkinson) when a shock 
revelation rocks their family. A third series would be very welcome indeed.

Victoria Wood: At It Again
 10pm, BBC2

The death of the astonishingly versatile and widely adored comic was one of 
2016’s bitterest blows. Quite appropriately, BBC2 is devoting the whole evening 
to Wood tonight, offering an array of shows that emphasise her remarkable 
range. There are sketches in an As Seen On TV special, a doc from 1998 in which 
she reflects on her career, a hyperactive Christmas special and, finally, this 
one-woman show from the Albert Hall.Phil Harrison 

Who Killed JonBenét?
10pm, Lifetime 

The unsolved murder of six-year-old beauty queen JonBenét Ramsey became an 
international obsession back in 1996. As the 20th anniversary of her death 
looms, More4 is screening CBS’s new two-part docu-series The Case Of JonBenét 
Ramsey from Thursday. But first up is this dramatised TV movie that features 
the victim narrating her story from beyond the grave, Lovely Bones-style. 
Queasy viewing.Graeme Virtue 

The X Factor Winner’s Story
6.05pm, ITV2

Matt Terry – the Louis Tomlinson lookalike of silky voice and sizeable brows – 
was last week named X Factor champ. But what next for the 23-year-old who - in 
a reversal of the usual talent-show trajectory – had to pull out of a Cumbrian 
panto once he had made it to Boot Camp? Will he go the way of Matt Cardle and 
Joe McElderry before him, or could he emulate his more successful doppelganger? 
Here, contestants and judges ponder his fate.Hannah J Davies

 Marc Webb’s fun – if premature – Spidey reboot 
The Amazing Spider-Man (Marc Webb, 2012) 7.10pm, ITV2
It seemed a tad premature to reboot Spidey so soon after the Tobey Maguire 
trilogy, but Webb’s movie is altogether more fun. Andrew Garfield is slightly 
less nerdy as Peter Parker, who gains his powers via the experiments of his 
scientist father (Campbell Scott) – as does the hugely menacing villain, Rhys 
Ifans’s Dr Curt Connors, aka The Lizard.Paul Howlett

Last Chance Harvey (Joel Hopkins, 2008) 11.30pm, BBC2
Dustin Hoffman is the melancholic New York musician Harvey Shine, in London to 
attend his estranged daughter’s wedding and striking up an awkward relationship 
with Emma Thompson’s Kate, who is struggling with an overbearing mother (Eileen 
Atkins). It ambles along at a tourist’s pace but is nevertheless a sweet 
midlife romance.PH

Before I Go To Sleep (Rowan Joffe, 2014) 12.55am, Channel 4
Joffe’s daft, entertaining thriller, based on SJ Watson’s bestseller, stars 
Nicole Kidman as Christine, who wakes every morning not knowing who she is. Her 
solicitous husband Ben (Colin Firth) explains she is suffering amnesia after an 
accident, but then Mark Strong’s mysterious Doc Nasch phones with twisty plot 
developments. It’s no Memento, but Kidman is terrific.PH
