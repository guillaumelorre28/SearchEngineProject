Did you know that the Guardian has been making podcasts for a decade now? That 
the word “podcasting” was coined byBen Hammersley writing for the Guardian in 
2004 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia>? 
That what was for many years the world’s most downloaded podcast,The Ricky 
Gervais Show <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ricky_Gervais_Show>, was first 
released on our site?

What would a feminist do? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/what-would-a-feminist-do>

The Guardian’s Jessica Valenti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessicavalenti> brings you interviews, 
advice and real life stories from the front lines of feminism. She talks about 
everything from periods (or lack thereof), to cyberbullying, objectification, 
crafting an equal and egalitarian relationship, abortions and sex education. 
This is the place for women and men, or as we like to call them, people, to 
share their questions and thoughts about everyday issues facing women and 
feminism.

 Brexit Means... 
Brexit Means... <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/brexit-means>

We delve into the nitty gritty of Brexit and try to make some sort of sense of 
it, bringing you episodes as and when you need them.

In the coming months we’ll be hearing from Britons and Europeans, Leavers and 
Remainers, politicians and ordinary people, economists, businessmen, lawyers, 
researchers, campaigners and many more about what Brexit means for them, for 
the UK and for the EU, how it might work – and how it might not.

 The Biggest Story in the World 
The biggest story in the world 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/mar/16/the-biggest-story-in-the-world>

Behind the scenes at the Guardian, former editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger> and his team reveal a 
newspaper’s mission to help save the world from climate change. Can they find a 
new narrative to tell a 20 year-old story? And what will they risk in their 
efforts to do so? This award-winning podcast is simply a must: you don’t have 
to know much about climate change to begin, we explain everything and what we 
can all do to stop it in its tracks. We are not doomed, but we soon will be if 
we don’t change.

 Close Encounters 
Close Encounters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/close-encounters>

Honest, unguarded conversations about sex and relationships, with journalist 
and sex educator Alix Fox.
In this podcast series Alix visits individuals and couples who have something 
interesting to say about their past and present loves, taking us through their 
sexual encounters from the first time, to the last. It will be messy, sometimes 
sticky and often downright rude. So you might want to wear headphones.

Australian Culture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/series/guardian-australia-culture-podcast>

Don’t say it. We’ve all heard the joke about Australian culture... but it’s 
simply not true, and the Guardian Australia culture team can prove it. They are 
often joined by performers, writers, musicians, and artists of every form, from 
around the country and the world, discussing the news, trends, events and 
everything else which encompass Australia’s incredible culture.

 Token Podcast 
Token <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/token-podcast>

All three branches of the Guardian have come together to discuss race, 
culture, sex, gender and identity. Starting in Australia and now currently in 
the UK, our teams talk frankly about what it’s like being a minority or indeed 
the token in society, the change they’d like to see and answer those questions 
which most people feel aren’t PC enough to ask. We don’t want to preach to the 
converted here though, it’s a podcast based on discussion and differences and 
we’re hoping to find voices who disagree with us (we don’t think it should be 
too hard)

The Music podcast is our irregular but ever-excellent look at music culture. 
The latest in this series is the podcast version of our live radio shows on 
NTS, The Guardian Radio Hour. Each week a special guest joined the Guardian’s
Kate Hutchinson <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hutchinson> to 
discuss a musical theme, from Neneh Cherry on her journey from jazz to punk, to 
Stewart Lee’s survey of music and stand-up comedy. It’s very Guardian.
