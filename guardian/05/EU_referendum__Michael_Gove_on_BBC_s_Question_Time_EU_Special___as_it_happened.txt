Gove on Question Time - Summary

 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary and leading Vote Leave campaigner, 
accused the Guardian of misreporting the views of his father.He spoke out 
angrily on the BBC’s Question Time EU Special after the Guardian publisheda 
story saying Gove’s father Ernest has contradicted claims made by his son that 
the family’s fish processing firm in Aberdeen was destroyed by the European 
Union’s fisheries policies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>
. Gove accused the Guardian of putting words into his father’s mouth and 
exploiting him to further a pro-EU agenda. (See 8.01pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-live-osborne-punishment-budget-farage-flotilla-thames?page=with:block-5761a474e4b02d7fb43eae36#block-5761a474e4b02d7fb43eae36>
The Guardian has responded by publishing a transcript of the interview with 
Gove snr which backs up the story written by Severin Carrell. (See 8.23pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-live-osborne-punishment-budget-farage-flotilla-thames?page=with:block-5761aa3ee4b04ceead988c83#block-5761aa3ee4b04ceead988c83>
 * Gove said that he would not vote for the hypothetic post-Brexit emergency 
budget proposed by George Osborne today.But, when asked if he would support it, 
he made it clear that he was saying no because he did not think it would be 
necessary. Asked if he would vote for it he said: 
No, because I think that what we have heard from the Remain campaign 
throughout this whole referendum have been dire warnings of the terrible 
consequences of the British people just taking control of our own destiny.

And, the truth is, if we vote to Leave we will be in an economically stronger 
position. We will be able to take back some of the money that we currently give 
to theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and we can invest 
it in our priorities.

 * Gove said there will be “bumps in the road” if the UK leaves the EU. 
However, he refused to say what these would be. He said: 
If we leave the European Union, yes there will be bumps in the road, 
inevitably, but we will be in a better position to deal with them.

 * He said the UK rebate would be cut if Britain stays in the EU. 
 * He suggested that immigration would not start to fall until after 2020 if 
Britain voted to leave the EU because withdrawal would not take place until the 
end of this parliament. 
 * He accused the Remain campaign of “ramping up the fear, turning it up to 
11”. 
 * He said Turkey would “inevitably” join the EU in his lifetime if Britain 
stayed in. 
 * He was criticised by members of the audience, with one man saying he was 
“off his rocker” and a woman calling him a“wolf in sheep’s clothing”. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Michael Gove has subtly changed what he has been saying about his father’s 
business since he appeared on Sky News earlier this month.

In his Sky News interview Gove implied the business went bust while his father 
owned it. He said:

My father had a fishing business in Aberdeen destroyed by the European Union 
and the Common Fisheries Policy, theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> …

If you heard earlier, Faisal, I know what it’s like to see someone lose their 
job as a result of the European Union. I saw my father lose his job, I saw his 
business go to the wall, I saw 24 people who he employed also lose their jobs.

But Gove’s father told the Guardian he sold the business before it had to 
close. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>

Tonight Gove was careful not to say the business closed while his father still 
owned it. He said:

One of reasons I was able to go to university was because of the sacrifices my 
family made. One of the things I know about the European Union is that the 
European Union can destroy jobs. My dad ran a fish business in Aberdeen. The 
common fisheries policy unfortunately led to the devastation of fishing in
Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>. My dad had to close his 
business. As a result something that he been built up by by grandfather and 
maintained by my dad disappeared. So my dad suffered ...

My dad has been clear, he was clear to the BBC on Sunday night, he was clear 
to me when I was a boy, that the business that he invested so much care and 
time in had to close as a result of the common fisheries policy.

Transcript of the Guardian's conversation with Michael Gove's father

Severin Carrell

This is a full transcript of the interview the Guardian had by telephone with 
Ernest Gove, Michael Gove’s father, on the morning Tuesday 14 June. It has been 
slightly edited to remove verbal tics and some slight repetition.

Ernest Gove: “Hello?”

Severin Carrell: Oh, hello, is that Earnest Gove?

EG: “Yeah, it is.”

SC: Hi. My name is Severin Carrell, I’m the Guardian newspaper’s Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> editor. I’m just phoning to see 
whether you’d be able to give me some more information about what happened to 
your family business in the early ‘80s. Just following up on the interviews 
your son Michael has been giving and the speeches he has made about the CFP 
[Common Fisheries Policy].

EG: “There’s nothing really to go back about anyway because it just was, when 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> went into fishing, the 
industry more or less collapsed down and I just packed in and got a job with 
another firm, you know. That was all that was happening.


“That was all that was happening. It wasn’t any hardship or things like that, 
or what you call it: I just decided to call it a day and just sold up my 
business and went on to work with someone else, you know.”

SC: Right. So there wasn’t any hardship?

EG: “It wasn’t because of hardship but I couldn’t see any future in it, that 
type of thing, the business that I had, so I just said I wasn’t going to go 
into all the trouble of going hardship, and things like that. I just decided to 
sell up and get a job with someone else, you know. That was all.”

SC: Okay.

EG: “And that’s all it was, like.”

SC: The reason I’m interested is it’s just that I have covered the fishing 
industry quite a bit in my work and I was a bit puzzled about whether, how the 
CFP itself would’ve been the sole cause of problems in Aberdeen because I know 
from other people in the industry that the biggest issues in the early, mid 
1980s were to do with the 200 mile nautical limit, the cod wars; then there was 
the competition in Aberdeen harbour with North Sea oil and gas, and there was 
the dockworkers strike, all of that happening making life in Aberdeen much more 
difficult.

EG: “You had all that going on. So, to be quite honest, I just decided to sell 
up really and then go ahead and try and make a good living out of it, I can get 
a job with someone I could be more or less employed and know I was going to be 
employed.

“But as I say, yes oil and everything else came along and things like that. I 
mean, as you understand, that is just what industry does. It goes on and on and 
on and you go from one to another and to another. As regards my own business, I 
just decided, as I said, that things weren’t going to work well with me, and I 
decided to pack it in and that’s all.”

SC: Right. OK. When was that?

“I couldn’t tell you the dates. It’s eh … I’m getting on for 80 now. So all 
these type of things is not staying in my head, you know.”

SC: OK. But would it have been around 1983, ’84, ’85, that kind of time?

EG: “I couldn’t really say because I can’t remember to be honest. But that’s 
all that I can tell you.”

SC: My final question Mr Gove, if you don’t mind. Were you aware that Michael 
had been saying that the CFP had destroyed your business? And it was solely to 
blame for the business folding?

“Yeah but I’m not saying anything because I’m not going against my son and I’m 
not going … he’s got his own policies, his own mind, and reasons, and I’m not 
going to give out any information at all to turn round and say one way or 
another. No, no, I’m not going to start fighting over [heads](?).

“As far as I’m concerned, I decided it wasn’t going to be my way of living, 
the way things was going, and I decided to change it. That was all.”

SC: Alright

EG: “Okay?”

SC: Thanks very much, I’m grateful.

EG: “Okay? Right.”

SC: Bye now, bye bye.

Gove on the Guardian

Here is the key quote from Michael Gove about the Guardian’s story about his 
father contradicting claims made by Gove himself about the family’s fish 
processing firm in Aberdeen being destroyed by the European Union’s fisheries 
policies. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>
 Gove told Question Time:

My dad was rung up by a reporter from the Guardian who tried to put words into 
his mouth but my dad has been clear, he was clear to the BBC on Sunday night, 
he was clear to me when I was a boy, that the business that he invested so much 
care and time in had to close as a result of the common fisheries policy.

I remember when my dad ran his business. Two of his employees were lads who 
were in a care home. They did not have parents. My dad took them in, gave them 
a job and allowed them to work in his business and to sleep there in a spare 
room that he made for them. That business closed. Those boys lost their home as 
a result of what happened. I know what my dad went through when I was a 
schoolboy and I don’t think that the Guardian or anyone else should belittle 
his suffering or try to get a 79-year-old man to serve their agenda instead of 
agreeing and being proud of what his son does.

Gove on Question Time - Snap verdict

Gove on Question Time - Snap verdict: Michael Gove’s appearance on Sky News’s 
EU referendum special two weeks ago was generally viewed as a success.
Personally I felt that his failure to answer key economic questions was a fatal 
handicap, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-michael-gove-questioned-on-sky-news?page=with:block-5751e17de4b0efb101874340#block-5751e17de4b0efb101874340>
 but generally commentators felt he came across as measured, likeable and 
persuasive.

Tonight did not go quite so smoothly. It did not go badly either, but Gove 
sounded just a little more edgy and thin-skinned, and at times some of his 
answers sounded glib. Question Time with David Dimbleby is in a league of its 
own when it comes to getting members of a studio audience to interrogate 
politicians in a forensic way, and not just a shouty way, and Gove had several 
exchanges with people where his answers clearly fell short (eg the woman with 
the translation business). It was also interesting to note that immigration, 
which is normally an easy subject for leave, was quite tricky for him tonight, 
with Dimbleby highlighting the government’s failure to use its powers to curb 
non-EU migration and a Spanish woman trying to make Gove ashamed of his stance.

The highlight, though, was Gove’s attack on the Guardian. All of us can 
understand the desire to protect one’s parents and no doubt many people 
watching will sympathise with what he said. We will be publishing more on this 
soon. But as far as I’m aware at no point has Gove, or anyone else, challenged 
the accuracy of a single word attributed to Gove’s father in Severin Carrell’s 
story. I’ve worked with Severin on and off for about 20 years and he is one of 
the most scrupulous and accurate reporters I know. Obviously you would expect 
me to say that. You’ll have to readhis story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>
 and Gove’s remarks (which I will post shortly) and decide for yourself who you

Q: Do you regret using the £350m a week figure for the amount the EU costs the 
UK?

Gove says some people have criticised. He says that is the amount of money the 
EU controls. Some of it comes back. But the rebate has been cut in the past, 
and it will be cut in the future again if we stay in.

 * Gove says UK rebate will be cut if we remain in the EU. 
Q: You sound plausible, but I can’t help thinking you are a wolf in sheep’s 
clothing.(She is using a phrase Jeremy Corbyn used yesterday.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/jeremy-corbyn-attacks-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing-johnson-farage>

Gove says Britain will be stronger, freer and fairer outside the EU. 

And that’s it.

I will post a verdict and a summary soon.

Gove says he does not favour deporting anyone who is hard working.

But he says a Bank of England report showed wages were being held down by 
immigration. It is not right to set community against community, he says.

He says he objects to the way a member of the audience is talking down people 
in this country.

A member of the audience complains about how immigrants like her are treated 
in this country. “We are not the enemy, Mr Gove,” she says.

Gove says he understands the woman’s point of view. He is in favour of 
migration, he says. He just wants to control the numbers.

The woman says she does not believe him.

Gove says he thinks we can secure exit from the EU by 2020.

And we can get immigration down in the next parliament.

Q: But the government can control immigration from outside the EU, and those

Q: Are you scaremongering when you say Turkey will join the EU?

Absolutely not, says Gove. He says the Financial Times has a story today 
saying moves to get Turkey into the EU are being accelerated.

Q: Cameron says we have a veto on Turkey joining the EU?

Gove says that is correct. But it is official government policy for Turkey to 
join. The government has no intention of using that veto.

He says he thinks Turkey joining the EU will “’inevitably” happen in our 
lifetime unless we vote to leave.

Q: If we get a leave vote, are you confident a prime minister who campaigned 
for remain will deliver what the country wants?

Gove says the referendum is about giving instructions to the prime minister. 
David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has promised 
he will abide by the decision of the people.

Q: And what will happen to George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne>. Some 65 Tory MPs say they 
will not vote for his budget. Will he have to go?

Gove says the remain campaign have been “ramping up the fear, turning it up to 
11”. Do you want the UK to govern itself? Or do you want it run by the EU and 
its five presidents, none of whom you can name?

 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary and leading Vote Leave campaigner, 
accused the Guardian of misreporting the views of his father.He spoke out 
angrily on the BBC’s Question Time EU Special after the Guardian publisheda 
story saying Gove’s father Ernest has contradicted claims made by his son that 
the family’s fish processing firm in Aberdeen was destroyed by the European 
Union’s fisheries policies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>
. Gove accused the Guardian of putting words into his father’s mouth and 
exploiting him to further a pro-EU agenda. (See 8.01pm.)

The Guardian has responded by publishing a transcript of the interview with 
Gove snr which backs up the story written by Severin Carrell. (See 8.23pm.)

 * Gove said that he would not vote for the hypothetic post-Brexit emergency 
budget proposed by George Osborne today.But, when asked if he would support it, 
he made it clear that he was saying no because he did not think it would be 
necessary. Asked if he would vote for it he said: 
No, because I think that what we have heard from the Remain campaign 
throughout this whole referendum have been dire warnings of the terrible 
consequences of the British people just taking control of our own destiny.

And, the truth is, if we vote to Leave we will be in an economically stronger 
position. We will be able to take back some of the money that we currently give 
to theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and we can invest 
it in our priorities.

 * Gove said there will be “bumps in the road” if the UK leaves the EU. 
However, he refused to say what these would be. He said: 
If we leave the European Union, yes there will be bumps in the road, 
inevitably, but we will be in a better position to deal with them.

 * He said the UK rebate would be cut if Britain stays in the EU. 
 * He suggested that immigration would not start to fall until after 2020 if 
Britain voted to leave the EU because withdrawal would not take place until the 
end of this parliament. 
 * He accused the Remain campaign of “ramping up the fear, turning it up to 
11”. 
 * He said Turkey would “inevitably” join the EU in his lifetime if Britain 
stayed in. 
 * He was criticised by members of the audience, with one man saying he was 
“off his rocker” and a woman calling him a“wolf in sheep’s clothing”. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Michael Gove has subtly changed what he has been saying about his father’s 
business since he appeared on Sky News earlier this month.

In his Sky News interview Gove implied the business went bust while his father 
owned it. He said:

My father had a fishing business in Aberdeen destroyed by the European Union 
and the Common Fisheries Policy, theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> …

If you heard earlier, Faisal, I know what it’s like to see someone lose their 
job as a result of the European Union. I saw my father lose his job, I saw his 
business go to the wall, I saw 24 people who he employed also lose their jobs.

But Gove’s father told the Guardian he sold the business before it had to 
close. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>

Tonight Gove was careful not to say the business closed while his father still 
owned it. He said:

One of reasons I was able to go to university was because of the sacrifices my 
family made. One of the things I know about the European Union is that the 
European Union can destroy jobs. My dad ran a fish business in Aberdeen. The 
common fisheries policy unfortunately led to the devastation of fishing in
Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>. My dad had to close his 
business. As a result something that he been built up by by grandfather and 
maintained by my dad disappeared. So my dad suffered ...

My dad has been clear, he was clear to the BBC on Sunday night, he was clear 
to me when I was a boy, that the business that he invested so much care and 
time in had to close as a result of the common fisheries policy.
 
This is a full transcript of the interview the Guardian had by telephone with 
Ernest Gove, Michael Gove’s father, on the morning Tuesday 14 June. It has been 
slightly edited to remove verbal tics and some slight repetition.

Ernest Gove: “Hello?”

Severin Carrell: Oh, hello, is that Earnest Gove?

EG: “Yeah, it is.”

SC: Hi. My name is Severin Carrell, I’m the Guardian newspaper’s Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> editor. I’m just phoning to see 
whether you’d be able to give me some more information about what happened to 
your family business in the early ‘80s. Just following up on the interviews 
your son Michael has been giving and the speeches he has made about the CFP 
[Common Fisheries Policy].

EG: “There’s nothing really to go back about anyway because it just was, when 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> went into fishing, the 
industry more or less collapsed down and I just packed in and got a job with 
another firm, you know. That was all that was happening.


“That was all that was happening. It wasn’t any hardship or things like that, 
or what you call it: I just decided to call it a day and just sold up my 
business and went on to work with someone else, you know.”

SC: Right. So there wasn’t any hardship?

EG: “It wasn’t because of hardship but I couldn’t see any future in it, that 
type of thing, the business that I had, so I just said I wasn’t going to go 
into all the trouble of going hardship, and things like that. I just decided to 
sell up and get a job with someone else, you know. That was all.”

SC: Okay.

EG: “And that’s all it was, like.”

SC: The reason I’m interested is it’s just that I have covered the fishing 
industry quite a bit in my work and I was a bit puzzled about whether, how the 
CFP itself would’ve been the sole cause of problems in Aberdeen because I know 
from other people in the industry that the biggest issues in the early, mid 
1980s were to do with the 200 mile nautical limit, the cod wars; then there was 
the competition in Aberdeen harbour with North Sea oil and gas, and there was 
the dockworkers strike, all of that happening making life in Aberdeen much more 
difficult.

EG: “You had all that going on. So, to be quite honest, I just decided to sell 
up really and then go ahead and try and make a good living out of it, I can get 
a job with someone I could be more or less employed and know I was going to be 
employed.

“But as I say, yes oil and everything else came along and things like that. I 
mean, as you understand, that is just what industry does. It goes on and on and 
on and you go from one to another and to another. As regards my own business, I 
just decided, as I said, that things weren’t going to work well with me, and I 
decided to pack it in and that’s all.”

SC: Right. OK. When was that?

“I couldn’t tell you the dates. It’s eh … I’m getting on for 80 now. So all 
these type of things is not staying in my head, you know.”

SC: OK. But would it have been around 1983, ’84, ’85, that kind of time?

EG: “I couldn’t really say because I can’t remember to be honest. But that’s 
all that I can tell you.”

SC: My final question Mr Gove, if you don’t mind. Were you aware that Michael 
had been saying that the CFP had destroyed your business? And it was solely to 
blame for the business folding?

“Yeah but I’m not saying anything because I’m not going against my son and I’m 
not going … he’s got his own policies, his own mind, and reasons, and I’m not 
going to give out any information at all to turn round and say one way or 
another. No, no, I’m not going to start fighting over [heads](?).

“As far as I’m concerned, I decided it wasn’t going to be my way of living, 
the way things was going, and I decided to change it. That was all.”

SC: Alright

EG: “Okay?”

SC: Thanks very much, I’m grateful.

EG: “Okay? Right.”

SC: Bye now, bye bye.
 
Here is the key quote from Michael Gove about the Guardian’s story about his 
father contradicting claims made by Gove himself about the family’s fish 
processing firm in Aberdeen being destroyed by the European Union’s fisheries 
policies. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>
 Gove told Question Time:

My dad was rung up by a reporter from the Guardian who tried to put words into 
his mouth but my dad has been clear, he was clear to the BBC on Sunday night, 
he was clear to me when I was a boy, that the business that he invested so much 
care and time in had to close as a result of the common fisheries policy.

I remember when my dad ran his business. Two of his employees were lads who 
were in a care home. They did not have parents. My dad took them in, gave them 
a job and allowed them to work in his business and to sleep there in a spare 
room that he made for them. That business closed. Those boys lost their home as 
a result of what happened. I know what my dad went through when I was a 
schoolboy and I don’t think that the Guardian or anyone else should belittle 
his suffering or try to get a 79-year-old man to serve their agenda instead of 
agreeing and being proud of what his son does.
 
Gove on Question Time - Snap verdict: Michael Gove’s appearance on Sky News’s 
EU referendum special two weeks ago was generally viewed as a success.
Personally I felt that his failure to answer key economic questions was a fatal 
handicap, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-michael-gove-questioned-on-sky-news?page=with:block-5751e17de4b0efb101874340#block-5751e17de4b0efb101874340>
 but generally commentators felt he came across as measured, likeable and 
persuasive.

Tonight did not go quite so smoothly. It did not go badly either, but Gove 
sounded just a little more edgy and thin-skinned, and at times some of his 
answers sounded glib. Question Time with David Dimbleby is in a league of its 
own when it comes to getting members of a studio audience to interrogate 
politicians in a forensic way, and not just a shouty way, and Gove had several 
exchanges with people where his answers clearly fell short (eg the woman with 
the translation business). It was also interesting to note that immigration, 
which is normally an easy subject for leave, was quite tricky for him tonight, 
with Dimbleby highlighting the government’s failure to use its powers to curb 
non-EU migration and a Spanish woman trying to make Gove ashamed of his stance.

The highlight, though, was Gove’s attack on the Guardian. All of us can 
understand the desire to protect one’s parents and no doubt many people 
watching will sympathise with what he said. We will be publishing more on this 
soon. But as far as I’m aware at no point has Gove, or anyone else, challenged 
the accuracy of a single word attributed to Gove’s father in Severin Carrell’s 
story. I’ve worked with Severin on and off for about 20 years and he is one of 
the most scrupulous and accurate reporters I know. Obviously you would expect 
me to say that. You’ll have to readhis story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen>
 and Gove’s remarks (which I will post shortly) and decide for yourself who you 
trust.
 
Q: Do you regret using the £350m a week figure for the amount the EU costs the 
UK?

Gove says some people have criticised. He says that is the amount of money the 
EU controls. Some of it comes back. But the rebate has been cut in the past, 
and it will be cut in the future again if we stay in.

 * Gove says UK rebate will be cut if we remain in the EU. 
Q: You sound plausible, but I can’t help thinking you are a wolf in sheep’s 
clothing.(She is using a phrase Jeremy Corbyn used yesterday.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/jeremy-corbyn-attacks-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing-johnson-farage>

Gove says Britain will be stronger, freer and fairer outside the EU. 

And that’s it.

I will post a verdict and a summary soon.
 
Gove says he does not favour deporting anyone who is hard working.

But he says a Bank of England report showed wages were being held down by 
immigration. It is not right to set community against community, he says.

He says he objects to the way a member of the audience is talking down people 
in this country.
 
A member of the audience complains about how immigrants like her are treated 
in this country. “We are not the enemy, Mr Gove,” she says.

Gove says he understands the woman’s point of view. He is in favour of 
migration, he says. He just wants to control the numbers.

The woman says she does not believe him.
 
Gove says he thinks we can secure exit from the EU by 2020.

And we can get immigration down in the next parliament.

 * Gove suggests immigration would not be reduced until after 2020 if we left 
the EU. 
Q: But the government can control immigration from outside the EU, and those 
numbers are still well over 100,000.

Gove says that is within our control. If we leave the EU, we cannot place any 
limits on migration from within the EU.
 
Gove says under EU law there are criminals here we cannot deport. If we leave 
the EU, we can have an Australian-style points system.
 
Q: Are you scaremongering when you say Turkey will join the EU?

Absolutely not, says Gove. He says the Financial Times has a story today 
saying moves to get Turkey into the EU are being accelerated.

Q: Cameron says we have a veto on Turkey joining the EU?

Gove says that is correct. But it is official government policy for Turkey to 
join. The government has no intention of using that veto.

He says he thinks Turkey joining the EU will “’inevitably” happen in our 
lifetime unless we vote to leave.

 * Gove says Turkey will “inevitably” join the EU in our lifetime unless we 
vote to leave.  
Q: If we get a leave vote, are you confident a prime minister who campaigned 
for remain will deliver what the country wants?

Gove says the referendum is about giving instructions to the prime minister. 
David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has promised 
he will abide by the decision of the people.

Q: And what will happen to George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne>. Some 65 Tory MPs say they 
will not vote for his budget. Will he have to go?

Gove says the remain campaign have been “ramping up the fear, turning it up to 
11”. Do you want the UK to govern itself? Or do you want it run by the EU and 
its five presidents, none of whom you can name?
