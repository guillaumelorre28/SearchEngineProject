One of the oldest edible foods to be cultivated, grapes are produced around 
the world, for wine, to be consumed fresh, or dried into raisins – among other 
uses. In Australia, in areas with rich soils and warm, dry summers we have 
perfect grape growing conditions. We are reaching the end of the season, but at 
least in Victoria where the majority of the late season table grapes are grown 
it’s the perfect time to eat grapes.

The most common table varieties in Australia are the Thompson Seedless, 
Menindee Seedless, Crimson Seedless and Red Globe. Table grapes vary in 
flavour, shape and colour of the grape and texture of the pulp and skin. Grapes 
don’t ripen off the vine, so at the market, always choose ripe fruit. The fruit 
should be firm, the clusters plump and securely attached to their stems. The 
stems should be green not brown. Red and black varieties should have foggy 
bloom, which is a natural protection for the fruit. If stored in an airtight 
container, at very cool temperatures, grapes can last weeks in the fridge. They 
store very well. This also means though, that as the season progresses you will 
be presented at the market, with old grapes. Look for those signs, the green 
stems, to make sure the grapes you’re buying are fresh.

For this dish, choose whichever grapes look best at the market. I like the 
large red globe grapes, even though they have seeds, they just look so grand, 
but seedless is more convenient. The grapes will soften, relax and caramalise 
into the winey sauce at the bottom of the pan. The sweetness compliments the 
chicken, and by the end of it you’ll be wanting to mop up the pan juices with a 
loaf of crusty bread.

Depending on the weather – at this time of year, especially in Melbourne, the 
weather can flip flop from freezing to warm and glorious – serve this chicken 
with something comforting and wintery, like mashed potato, or if you’re serving 
this on a crisp sunny day for lunch, a peppery rocket salad and some steamed 
kipflers would be perfect.

 The perfect seasonings for roast chicken: grapes, onion and thyme. Photograph:

Roast chicken with grapes

a large, free range, organic chicken

pepper and salt

olive oil

150ml sweet white wine

500g seedless grapes

2 red onions, wedges

1 bulb of garlic, separated

a handful of Kalamata olives (green Spanish olives would also be delicious)

sprigs of rosemary

sprigs of thyme

Get the best whole chicken you can find, and ask your butcher to section it 
for you, if you don’t know how to do it yourself. Preheat oven at 200C. Season 
the chicken pieces. In a large, heavy bottomed pan that can go from stovetop to 
oven, over high heat, drizzle a little olive oil and brown the chicken pieces. 
When brown, remove the chicken pieces from the pan and set aside. Deglaze the 
pan with the white wine and turn off the heat. Add grapes, red onion and 
garlic, olives and herbs to the wine at the bottom of the pan – season with a 
little more pepper and salt. Nuzzle the chicken pieces into this mixture, in 
the pan, with the skin side facing up.

Roast for 45 to 50 minutes. The dish is ready when the grapes have relaxed, 
and begun to caramalise and the chicken is tender and still moist.

Serves 4.
