Channel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> News has defended its 
decision to live stream a conflict for the first time amid concerns over the 
dangers of watching the battle for Mosul on a Facebook live feed.

The publicly owned broadcaster joined other TV stations including Al-Jazeera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/al-jazeera> and Rudaw, the Kurdish news 
agency that provided the content, to live stream the advance of Iraqi troops 
and Kurdish fighters into Mosul, Islamic State’s last major stronghold in Iraq.

Watched more than 500,000 times by lunchtime on Tuesday, the Channel 4 News 
feed prompted a mixed response with several users questioning the 
appropriateness of “liking” and pasting emojis on scenes of potential 
devastation.

In an email, Jon Laurence, digital editor of Channel 4 News, told the 
Guardian: “On live streaming the Mosul footage, we wanted to bring the one of 
the most significant stories of our time to our viewers as it happened. Given 
the nature of conflict – we are cautious and vigilant that the material is 
appropriate at all times and have measures in place to stop the stream when 
necessary.

“We apply the same editorial standards to Facebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> Lives that we do to our 
award-winning programme and that means ensuring that they are effectively 
supervised at all times; this is the case with every new platform or format 
with which we engage.”

A Channel 4 spokeswoman said a digital editor was assigned to make editorial 
“judgment calls” on the footage and switch it off if warranted. Asked about the 
use of emojis she said: “That’s part and parcel of the FB live package. The 
benefit for us is the immediacy.”

Laurence has described Facebook Live as a “key priority” for the channel as a 
way of engaging viewers and cited previous success such as thelive feed of the 
protests in the aftermath of the EU referendum <http:// 
https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/videos/10153852956136939/>. Spilling onto 
Facebook from the Channel 4 News, at 7.55pm the EU protest feed had 2 million 
views.

The Mosul feed on Al-Jazeera  
<http://popularmilitary.com/watch-live-broadcast-battle-isis-mosul-iraq/>
attracted more than 892,000 views.

Both feeds attracted debate online with some worried that war had become 
“entertainment” for commercial gain. A comment from journalist Harriet Salem 
was retweeted 3,600 times:

The 21st century. A place where we live stream war while Facebook prompts us 
to 'react' with an emoticon.#Mosul <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mosul?src=hash>

“This is not entertainment for you to get more viewers”.

The use of the “like” button or ability to use emojis expressing anger, horror 
or even a thumb’s up offended others.Aodhán Ó Súilleabháin

the emojis flashing across the screen gives the war as entertainment angle a 
real dystopian vibe.”


Others were were positive about a method of filming live events that is 
gaining in popularity despite its cost and legal complexities.

The Lad Bible website prefaced a report announced the live streaming with: 
“This could be the biggest battle of the 21st century so far and it began with 
a live stream on Facebook.”

Hemin Lihony, Rudaw’s head of digital portal, told Bloomberg 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-18/the-battle-for-mosul-will-be-live-streamed-with-emoji>
 in an email that broadcasters set up cameras last week in the safest location 
close to Mosul and were going to move closer each day as forces make further 
advances. Rudaw’s audience on Facebook has increased more than 200% this week, 
he said.

In some ways live streaming is continuing the tradition of media companies 
using new technology to bring events to a wider audience. CNN broke new ground 
in the early 1990s by broadcasting live audio of American bombing raid in 
Baghdad

 while others used Facebook to stream live footage of shootings in Dallas and
Minnesota
