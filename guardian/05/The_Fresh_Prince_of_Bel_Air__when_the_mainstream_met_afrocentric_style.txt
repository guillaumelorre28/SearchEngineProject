When it debuted on TV in 1990, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air – which finished 20 
years ago – brought with it a new vanguard of style.


In the same year that The Word and The Mary Whitehouse Experience altered the 
pop-culture diet, the sitcom allowed mainstream audiences to digest hip-hop 
culture both as a non-threatening concept and a bold new visual identity.

 A bold new visual identity – Will Smith. Photograph:

In the infamous opening credits <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQZc53dpPrQ>, 
Will Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/film/willsmith>’s character moves from 
the mean inner-city streets of Philadelphia to the plush surroundings of Bel 
Air, bringing with him a sassy attitude, but also a street style that was new 
for TV. Smith’s visual identity had its roots in the afrocentric style that had 
become popular in the late 80s.

This mainstreaming of hip-hop style can be seen from the rich palette of A 
Different World (costumed byJudy Richman 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2541737/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1>, who also worked on The 
Fresh Prince) and Spike Lee’s Do The Right Thing (1989). There was also a 
sartorial movement in music, led by artists such as Queen Latifah and The Daisy 
Age crew (De La Soul <https://www.theguardian.com/music/de-la-soul>, The Jungle 
Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest), in reaction to the likes of NWA. 
Stylistically, this meant a contrast to those tightly regimented monochromes 
and golds, opting instead for brightly patterned shirts worn loosely, 
stone-washed denim and Gatsby caps worn in various colours.

In the show Smith’s style was OTT and daring (he described it as “Classy 
Splat-ow 
<https://thescene.com/watch/gq/will-smith-is-super-embarrassed-of-this-fresh-prince-style-fail?source=player_scene_logo>
”). Combining labels like Nike with edgy items like paisley blazers and 
patterned trousers, it’s saucer eyed visual identity was tailor made for the 
cartoonish GIF-age, where the one stand out visual was everything.

You can see the stylistic influence on labels like the LOL-core Lazy Oaf 
<http://images.asos-media.com/inv/media/0/8/3/7/3777380/white/image1xxl.jpg>, 
founder Gemma Shiel says that the fashion was: “bold, playful and verging on 
the cartoon.” She says that it was a stylistic inspiration. “I have, on 
occasion, gone back to reference the show as the costume design was pretty full 
on and brave. I loved that (Smith) wore his blazers inside out and patterns 
went with patterns (and) no apologies.”

You can see the influence in contemporary menswear lines like of Coach

 andSibling

, too. And it speaks volumes about the show’s continued sartorial influence you
