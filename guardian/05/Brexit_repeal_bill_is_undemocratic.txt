Theresa May says her repeal bill to incorporate all existing EU laws into UK 
law (Theresa May to trigger article 50 by end of March 2017 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws>
, 2 October) will also “include powers to make changes to the laws originating 
from the EU, using secondary legislation”. This does not return power to our 
elected institutions, it gives virtually untrammelled power to ministers who 
can pass secondary legislation without any reference at all to parliament. Yet 
again this country demonstrates just how undemocratic it is and how desperately 
we need constitutional reform in order to allow the elected parliament to hold 
the government to account.

• There is a simpler solution to calling an early general election than trying 
to get a two-thirds majority in the Commons (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/fierce-debate-on-the-future-of-the-labour-party>
, 29 September ). Theresa May could repeal or amend the Fixed Term Parliament 
Act 2011 by a simple majority.

• Vernon Bogdanor (Opinion, 3 October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/article-50-trade-eu-deals-globalisation>
) writes that membership of the European Economic Area requires accepting the 
free movement of people. Liechtenstein, an EEA member since 1995, imposes 
strict quotas limiting the number of people who can work and live there. This 
quota system applies to nationals of all EU countries.

• Vernon Bogdanor writes “it will be the ‘left behind’, those most likely to 
have voted for Brexit, who will suffer the most”. Surely it is those misguided 
voters who most deserve to suffer its consequences?

• Surely the true meaning of the enigmatic question is “contintental Brexit or 
full English Brexit (with Oxford marmalade)”.
