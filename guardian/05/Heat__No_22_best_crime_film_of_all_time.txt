Michael Mann's masterpiece is a three-hour crime epic, a love/hate letter the 
city of Los Angeles, a scathing Balzacian view of a society corrupt from top to 
bottom, and a vision of the universe as a space contested over by the fractious 
armies of crime and the law. Opening with a spectacular armoured-car robbery 
that degenerates into mass murder, Heat follows the consequences of the raid, 
the plans for its successor, the response of the police, led by detective 
Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and the consequences of it all for wives, families, 
girlfriends and innocent bystanders.

The cops and the crooks are both constituted like armies, with generals, ranks 
and special skills assigned – and doppelgangers in the opposing team. Mann is 
less interested in moral questions than in professionalism as a code worth 
adhering to, no matter which side of the law one finds oneself on. Mann's equal 
sympathies for both sides are always evident. He also loves Los Angeles at 
night, and rarely has it been evoked as beautifully as it is here.
