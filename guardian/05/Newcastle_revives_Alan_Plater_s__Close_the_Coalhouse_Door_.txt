For the original Newcastle Playhouse production of "Close the Coalhouse Door" 
in 1968, bus loads of miners would come in from the pit villages of County 
Durham and Northumberland, and forced the play's run to be extended five times.

 Samuel West, who is directing the new version which opens at Northern Stage 
<http://www.northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/close-the-coalhouse-door> this Friday, 
thinks its popularity back then was partly because

in 1968 people in the North East hadn't seen themselves on stage very much and 
it spoke to them in their own language and with song and humour and it spoke to 
them about something they cared about and that ran through them like rock.

This time round the popularity (and the production is already not far from a 
sell-out in Newcastle) is likely to be caused by a mixture of local pride 
tinged with nostalgia. There is no doubt that there is an audience –Live Theatre
 <>'s 2007 production of Lee Hall's The Pitmen Painters 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/17/in-praise-of-pitman-painters?INTCMP=SRCH>
 was originally only supposed to run for six weeks, and, after two runs at the 
National Theatre, is still playing in London's West End, as well as having 
clocked up tours to the rest of England, Broadway and, in a Spanish version 
called "Mineros", is on at the Metropolitan Theatre in Buenas Aires.

Previous revivals of "Close the Coalhouse Door" had been updated by Plater 
himself – for the Leeds version of 1974 he remembered doing some of the
re-writes by candlelight 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2000/jul/12/artsfeatures1> during a 
power-cut caused by the three day week. However, because of Plater's death in 
2010, Lee Hall was set the task of bringing the version up to date 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/mar/26/close-the-coalhouse-door-revival?INTCMP=SRCH>
, including references to the miners' strike of 1984-5. As a close friend and 
protégé of Alan Plater's, he stressed that the adaptations he has made are like 
"keyhole surgery" –

I didn't want to write Lee Hall's version of this. I'm not trying to impose 
anything because I was really trying to think "what would Alan do? What would 
Alan do?"

In the Bloodaxe Books 
<http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852244895> edition of the 
play, Plater wrote

The soul of the piece is unchanging. We originally described it as "a hymn of 
unqualified praise to the miners – who created a revolutionary weapon without 
having a revolutionary intent." If, today, the hymn is more in the nature of an 
elegy, it is a strain that haunts the dreams of everyone with roots in the 
North East.

As well as being elegiac it is, like most of Plater's work, richly humorous - 
Max Roberts, Live Theatre's artistic director and director of the play's 1994 
revival, and of many of Plater's other works, says of him: "All the scripts I 
directed possessed a delightful anarchy along with a genuine, heartfelt, 
humanist concern. I truly believe he was one of the finest comic writers of the 
20th Century".

Alan Plater's Close the Coalhouse Door <> is co-produced by Live Theatre and 
Northern Stage. It runs in Newcastle, Richmond (Surrey), Salford, Huddersfield, 
Guildford, Durham, Oxford and York, until June 30th.
