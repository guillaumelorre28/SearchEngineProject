The film is to take place before Star Wars: A New Hope and will focus on the 
formative years of Solo and Calrissian as they became space smugglers and, as 
Lucasfilms put it, “scoundrels on the rise”.

Clarke’s confirmation as the female lead in the film comes after rumors that 
Tessa Thompson, Naomi Scott and Zoe Kravitz were in consideration for the role. 
Other actors in the running were relative unknown Kiersey Clemons and Clarke’s 
fellow Game of Thrones star, Jessica Henwick.
