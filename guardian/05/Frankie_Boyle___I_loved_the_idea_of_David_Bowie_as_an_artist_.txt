In my early 20s, there was a period when all I owned was about a dozen CDs and 
a crappy Discman. I’d listen toThe Man Who Sold The World

endlessly as I sat on off-peak trains jerking around the Sussex countryside to 
and from the asylum I worked in.

I loved the idea of Bowie as an artist, with his Burroughsian cut-up 
technique, creating these undecipherable, abstract songs, where we all 
projected our own meanings onto his jarring word choices and unexpected chord 
changes.

It occurred to me one day that the song After All, which had sounded like 
nonsense at first, was about mental illness, and I suppose possibly about his 
half-brother, who had been a schizophrenic. It was odd to hear something from 
1970 dealing with mental illness so compassionately, so beautifully, at a 
period when the only time it really came up in culture was when a detective in 
a movie was profiling a serial killer.

Listen to David Bowie’s After All <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvfhObm14Oc> 
I think afterwards I always listened to his songs feeling that there was 
probably some explicit meaning intended if you could work it out.

And that’s kind of how I enjoyed Bowie, trying to work out what he was getting 
at. Life on Mars for me became about American movie culture swamping our 
imaginations, Queen Bitch about a guy living a straight life wishing he had the 
courage to fuck (or perhaps become) a transvestite prostitute.

‘An extraordinary, alien, otherworldly creature’: David Bowie 1947-2016 - video 
tribute 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-1947-2016-video-tribute>
Once I went to Oslo on holiday and there was a huge crowd outside the hotel. 
It turned out that Bowie was playing next door. I bought a ticket after a 
halfhearted attempt to haggle with the most reasonable tout in the world (“You 
understand I have to charge a little extra, this is in the nature of buying 
tickets and selling them on, yes?”). The crowd kept shouting out requests and 
he settled them with a very gentle and charming: “Don’t worry, we’re going to 
play all the hits, we’re going to be here for absolutely ages.”

Yesterday, my girlfriend woke me with “David Bowie is dead”. We have a game 
that started after Nelson Mandela died and I tweeted “Nelson Mandeada”; it’s 
basically to think of a dead pun involving the recently deceased celebrity. 
Prone Rivers; Robin Killshimself, that kind of thing.

I really didn’t have the heart, and it’s hard to pun on Bowie anyway, when 
nobody is ever really quite sure how to pronounce it.

“Are you in mourning?” she laughed as she went to work. “Yeah, I’m in 
mourning,” I laughed back. I stood, as a 43-year-old man, and cried in the 
shower.
