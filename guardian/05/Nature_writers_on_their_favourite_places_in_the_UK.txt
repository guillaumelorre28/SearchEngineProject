“There are certain landscapes that get under your skin and for me that’s 
Dartmoor. It is romantic – and English in a very particular way – but it’s not 
untouched, so if you see it that way you’re missing what makes it captivating. 
This is an uplands landscape of moorlands and granite and it is marked and 
scarred; it has layers of use there for you to see: medieval tin mines, 
neolithic stone circles and the remains of Victorian tramways from when that 
granite was being extracted. And what’s happening to it now, how it is being 
managed by the Duchy of Cornwall, the MoD, and as a national park, that’s 
another layer of use that will become part of its history.

It’s part of my history in that it’s somewhere my family and I went every 
summer when I was a child. We used to visit my grandmother, who lived in 
Ashburton, and would rent a stone cottage in Buckland-in-the-Moor a few miles 
away. It was a happy time. There was, though, a long period when I didn’t go: 
my time at university and in my 20s. I found that you end up connecting places 
with your childhood and, in a way, feel like you’re exiled from them. It’s the 
land of childhood and you can’t go back. But, after the end of a difficult 
relationship, I did go back.

 The road to Widecombe-in-the-Moor on Dartmoor. Photograph: Getty Images 
I went for a break and stayed in a B&B in Widecombe-in-the-Moor with an 
elderly couple who seemed concerned about me and would drive me in their 
Citroën 2CV to the start of my walks. It was astonishing to return to Dartmoor, 
to find that I didn’t dream it and that the places I remembered were still 
there. I think because of that absence and reconnection my relationship with 
the area has deepened.

The south west can be wet: there are two sea coasts and between them a big 
hump of upland, so you get orographic rainfall on Dartmoor. I’ve written about 
that weather in a chapter of Rain, and I’ve also mentioned how, as kids, my dad 
used to take my brothers and sisters out for hikes in that sometimes dreadful 
weather. We’d be wearing cheap cagoules and complaining, but I’m glad we did it 
because it taught me resilience. It taught me that you can go out, get wet and 
be uncomfortable but that is fine. You don’t have to seek convenience. In fact, 
if you do your life is limited by it.”

“The weather is constantly changing in Orkney and you can watch it approaching 
over the sea. There is so much sea and so much sky and there are few trees – it 
feels like the landscape has been reduced to its raw elements.

The Outrun is the largest field on my dad’s sheep farm on the west coast of 
the Orkney mainland, where I grew up. Outrun is an agricultural term … you have 
“in-bye” land, which is the closest land to the farm steading, then there is 
“out-bye” land, or outrun, which is further away and uncultivated. 
Historically, it was often hill ground or communal grazing shared between 
crofts.

My Outrun is land edged by cliffs on the west side that look out on the 
Atlantic, all the way to Canada. To the south, on a clear day, you can see the 
mountains of Ben Hope and Ben Loyal on mainland Scotland. At the top [of the 
Outrun] is a seastack where birds nest and you can spot guillemots and puffins. 
You may also findprimula scotica (Scottish primrose) growing, a tiny rare 
flower that survives in specific coastal conditions.

The area isn’t inaccessible, there’s a coastal path and you can walk from 
Skara Brae, the famous neolithic settlement, up to the Kitchener Memorial at
Marwick Head 
<https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/m/marwickhead/>
. The memorial commemorates the loss of the HMS Hampshire, which sank off this 
coast in 1916 and claimed the lives of more than 600 servicemen, includingLord 
Kitchener 
<https://www.theguardian.com/century/1910-1919/Story/0,6051,126462,00.html>.

I wouldn’t say it is the “best” place in the country but it does have 
particular meaning for me.

To some eyes it might look a bleak, unpromising place but it’s somewhere I 
love – and in all kinds of weather. I was there in January and went for a walk 
when it was hailing, but I felt exhilarated with the high seas and the crashing 
waves. I love it in summer, too, when you can spot great yellow bumblebees and 
look out to sea and try to pick out Sule Skerry – once the UK’s most remote 
manned lighthouse – about 30 miles to the west. I usually don’t see it, but I 
know it’s there.”

“Slip down between the grocer’s store and the pet shop in Pulborough, West 
Sussex. Barn House Lane narrows to a steep-sided track, there’s a gate at the 
end, then you’re out onto the Brooks, with the river Arun running between banks 
on the left and a great expanse of marsh stretching away to where the bare 
downs rise in the distance. There’s nowhere else like it; I’ve looked. This was 
the landscape I loved when I was growing up, and it’s still my secret standard 
for understanding other places.

It looks wild, but the flood plain is a working landscape shaped by human 
hands over centuries. The water level is precisely controlled by a network of 
drainage ditches which make grazing possible in summer, before the floods rise 
in winter and transform the humming grassland into an inland sea reflecting 
white skies. Even on warm days, when dragonflies flit in the meadowsweet, this 
place holds the memory of winter like a basin.

Part of the marsh is owned by the RSPB, and people come with their binoculars. 
I don’t see what they see: lapwings pass me by. But there’s already more than I 
can take in with two eyes: the shape of the land as I move through it, the 
texture of the grasses which change day by day. Each clump of rough sedge has a 
character of its own that seems to demand attention.

You can feel exposed and alone on the flat marsh, but there’s something 
sheltering and containing about this landscape too. Life has gone on, 
continuously, and left its traces on all sides. To the east is the site of a 
Roman bath; to the west there’s the Roman road, Stane Street (London Bridge to 
Chichester), which strikes confidently out across the wetland, undeterred by 
rising rivers.

 The parish church at Hardham. Photograph: Alamy 
The hamlet of Hardham is little more than a lay-by, but what a lay-by it is. 
There are 12th-century paintings in the church: a cycle of bible scenes drawn 
with the muscular contours of the Romanesque. Adam and Eve have been losing 
paradise here for 900 years, as the traffic goes by outside and a cow coughs in 
the water meadows on the other side of the road.

I don’t live in the area now, but perhaps the shape a place takes in the mind 
matters as much as what is verifiably there on the ground. At a distance, 
separate experiences fuse and colour each other. So the ochre of a painting in 
Hardham church becomes part of the tawny glow of a reed bank on the Brooks.”

“My response to nature in no way includes wanting to conquer it. I love just 
to observe, to feel invisible, and one of the most amazing places to experience 
that is Wester Ross, in the north-west Highlands. When I first went there I was 
immediately hooked. Joy. Wonder. Respect. All of that. I remember thinking this 
is absolutely the place I want to be. That was 14 years ago and I’ve been back 
every year since.

It has a savagery that I like very much. I can wander up a track and there 
will be strange things to see, dramas playing out. I remember watching a 
buzzard through my field glasses as it swooped down – you rarely see them dive 
– and came up with a long grass snake. The snake was whipping and bending and 
curling. It was an amazing battle. The buzzard was trying to keep its 
equilibrium with this heavy thing in its beak. The snake suddenly whip-lashed 
itself free and fell back to the ground. I watched the buzzard circling before 
it decided not to return for another attempt.

Applecross peninsula is an amazing part of Wester Ross. From there, you can 
look west towards the horizon through five alternating planes of darkness and 
light: you have islands, water and mountain peaks. If you are there towards the 
end of the day and looking towards the sun, all colour is drained out of that 
landscape and the sea becomes a shimmering sheet of silver, ending in the 
jagged peaks of the Cuillins on Skye.

When I drive up in March, one of my favourite times, I have the excitement of 
seeing snow glistening on peaks and delight in the way shadows move over them. 
I enjoy the solitude around the cottage I rent to do my writing. October brings 
wonderful changes of colour: the rowan trees are full of berries, the birches 
become butter yellow and the bracken turns a fox-like colour. My only company 
then is the stags who bellow and fight – a magnificent sound to hear in the 
night.

Our landscape and its wildlife are staggering; we need to understand them 
better and to grasp there are few things we do that some plant, animal or 
insect can’t do better. One of the things I hoped when I was writing the book 
was that it might make people care more – because until you care about 
something you can’t fight for it.”

“My book The Fish Ladder is about a manmade structure and the place I’ve 
chosen, High Dam, in Cumbria, is also manmade. I enjoy the contrast: you are in 
the Lakes, with all the hills and tarns, and here is something we have created. 
But High Dam is also the first place in nature that as a child I grew to love.

My dad had helped his graduate supervisor at Liverpool University build a 
cottage near Newby Bridge and, as a result, we were able to stay there as a 
family every year. It was more of a bothy than a cottage: two rooms, no 
electricity, and water from a hosepipe off the side of the hill. We would walk 
behind the cottage to a wood, called Bell Intake, which led to a pool, Low Dam, 
and then we would come to High Dam.

High Dam is shallow – not like the ice-scooped tarns on the tops of the 
mountains – and in summer one end is filled with water lilies. It has this 
lovely tea colour because of the peat, is surrounded by pines, silver birch and 
oak and, to me, has always had a Swallows and Amazons feel. The dam was created 
in 1835 to feed the water wheel at Stott Park Bobbin Mill on the shores of 
Windermere, and you can still visit it; it’s run by English Heritage.

 Stott Park Bobbin Mill 
As a child it was an adventure to get to. There were footpaths, but they 
weren’t well-maintained then, and you’d be up to your thighs in mud if you 
slipped off the logs there for you to walk across. TheLake District national 
park 
<http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/planyourvisit/travelandtransport/carparks/carparks_highdam>
 runs a car park near there now; it’s a beauty spot! The paths have been made 
good and bridges have been put over streams. I was horrified when that happened 
but then I was a child and I didn’t want to share it.

Every time I visit there is this feeling of a new experience: the light on the 
water is different, the sound of the trees is different; go on a winter’s day 
and it’s covered in frost or snow; go on a glorious summer’s day and people are 
swimming in the tarn. I’ve visited so often all those imprints are in my 
memory. There are also memories of the people I’ve known. The test of love of 
someone was always to see how they responded to High Dam.”
