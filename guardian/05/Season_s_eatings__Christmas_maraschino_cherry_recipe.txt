A bowl of cherries and a box of mangos has always been a Christmas tradition 
in our home. With a short picking season, and what can be a delicate, easily 
spoiled crop, cherries are usually expensive.

A large bowl as a centre piece of the Christmas table, is decadent. That juicy 
bite into the red flesh of a cherry is one of the joys of summer. The crack of 
the skin, the drip of sweet juice down your hand or chin. Despite their expense 
they should be enjoyed.

They’re at their best in Australia in December, though later varieties, and 
the Tasmanian cherries are available through January and early February.

 An ancient cultivated fleshy stone fruit, they can spoil easily, so 
refrigerate after purchase and if it’s one of those oppressively hot days 
taking a cool bag to the market can assure your cherries remain plump and 
delicious. Look for cherries that are firm of flesh and smell good.

The recipe we’ve given is a beautiful way to preserve a fruit that is 
available for such a short time, and a jar of maraschino cherries makes a 
pretty Christmas present for someone who is interested in fine food.

This recipe is a far cry from the maraschino cherries of the fifties and 
sixties, the cherries preserved in brine and bleached, then dyed an intense 
artificial red. These maraschino cherries were used for cocktails, as well as 
adorning kitsch dishes like baked ham and ice cream sundays. They tasted 
nothing like a cherry. Maraschino is a Croatian liquor made from the 
distillation of the Marasca cherry – a sour cherry. (There are two main types 
of cherries, the sweet which is what is mostly cultivated here in Australia, 
and the sour cherries which are used predominately in cooking and are very 
common in Europe.)

The maraschino cherry was originally preserved in this liquor, hence its name, 
but underwent an evolution that left even the process of preserving in liquor 
behind. We’ve preserved our cherries in brandy, with aromatics that bring out 
the flavour of the cherry, rather than mask it with sweetness. We used our 
preserved cherries in a Manhattan cocktail, perfect for a balmy summer evening.

 Put sugar, water, salt, rind, cinnamon into a small saucepan and simmer until 
the sugar dissolves. Take off the heat, add the brandy and cherries. Place in a 
sterilized jar. Let it come to room temperature before placing in the 
refrigerator. You can keep them for a good while in the refrigerator, but 
they’re so delicious, they won’t last long.

 Makes 400ml of cherries in their liquid.
