US oil rig count falls again

The number of oil rigs in use in the US has dropped for the eighth week in a 
row.

Total rig numbers dropped by 9 to 406, according to the weekly Baker Hughes 
rig count 
<http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&p=irol-reportsother>. Of 
this, 10 oil rigs were cut, but one gas rig was added. This was the lowest 
level since October 2009, as companies concentrated on completing existing 
wells rather than drilling new ones.

The oil price, which was already in negative territory, was little changed 
after the figures, with Brent crude now down 0.79% at $47.7.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for 
all your comments, and we’ll be back next week.

European shares end higher

Despite a mixed bag of economic data, European shares have ended the week on a 
positive note. There were some poor UK construction figures, while European 
growth figures were revised down, albeit by less than feared. The news from the 
US was better, with positive retail sales and confidence figures providing some 
support for markets.

Investors even took the latest warnings on Brexit - this time from the IMF - 
in their stride. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 34.31 points or 0.56% at 6138.5, just avoiding its 
fourth weekly fall in succession 
 * Germany’s Dax added 0.92% to 9952.90 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.62% to 4319.99 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.44% to 17,729.45 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 8721.5 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.59% to 622.71 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 47 points or 
0.27%.

Standard & Poor’s has confirmed its ratings on Italy with a stable outlook. 
The agency said:

We project that Italy’s economic recovery will stay on track, despite having 
revised downward our forecast for real GDP growth to 1.1% in 2016 and 1.3% in 
2017 (from 1.3% and 1.4% in our previous review).

We view as positive, recent initiatives to support Italian banks and reduce 
the high level of nonperforming loans in the banking sector, although we 
believe they alone may not be sufficient to fully address the related 
challenges.

We are affirming our long- and short-term sovereign credit ratings on the 
Republic of Italy at ‘BBB-/A-3’.

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the Italian government will 
continue to implement comprehensive and potentially growth-enhancing structural 
and budgetary reforms that will stabilise, and start reducing, the very high 
public debt ratio.

The dollar has continued to strengthen following the better than expected US 
data, despite analysts still not convinced the country’s economy is strong 
enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June meeting.

Against the pound, the US currency is currently at a three week high of 
$1.4343, up around 0.8% on the day. Brexit worries are also weakening sterling, 
with the IMF’s statements the latest in a serious of dire warnings about the 
impact of the UK leaving the EU.

Despite the strong US data today, the Federal Reserve may still decide not to 
hike rates in Junes, says James Knightley at ING Bank:

[The sentiment data] bodes well for consumer spending in 2Q16, particularly 
after the stronger than expected April retail sales report. While many at the 
Fed are keen to tighten monetary policy further we still feel that June is 
perhaps a little too early given the softness in data seen earlier in the year. 
We instead continue to favour a 3Q rate hike.

US consumer confidence jumps

Following the better than expected US retail sales figures comes news that 
consumer confidence is higher than forecast so far this month.

The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment rose from 89 in April 
to 95.8 in a preliminary reading for May. Analysts had expected a rise to 90.

This is the highest reading since June 2015.

The survey compilers said:

Consumer sentiment rebounded in early May due to more frequent income gains, 
an improved jobs outlook, and the expectation of lower inflation and interest 
rates. The largest gains were recorded among lower income and younger 
households, although the gains were recorded among all income and age subgroups 
as well as across all regions.

 Nearly all of the gains were in the Expectations Index, which rose to its 
highest level in nearly a year. To be sure, the data still indicated the 
negative impact of uncertainty about future economic policies associated with 
the Presidential election, but its overall impact was overwhelmed by favourable 
economic developments. It is too early to judge the potential impact of the 
election on consumers’ expectations, and one month’s rebound in consumer 
confidence is insufficient to increase the current forecast for 
inflation-adjusted consumer expenditures from 2.5% during 2016.

Greece and its creditors are close to agreeing a basic package of measures 
worth €5.4bn, paving the way for a loan tranche of some €10bn to be released, 
according to the Athens-Macedonia-News Agency.

More on the US retail sales.

The better than expected figures have eased some concerns about the state of 
theUS economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy>, says David 
Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco:

The number comes as a real relief for investors as it rounds off a week which 
has brought a lot of pain for US retailers. Department store operators Macy’s 
and Nordstrom posted weak earnings and slashed their forward guidance for the 
rest of the year. This comes on top of a number of high profile retail 
bankruptcies including American Apparel, Quicksilver and Aeropostale.

 All of this goes to demonstrate the US consumer’s unwillingness (or 
inability) to spend money, particularly on clothes and accessories. This is 
particularly worrying as consumer spending is widely accepted as accounting for 
over 70% of all US economic activity. If the recent disappointing news on 
payrolls and jobless claims proves to be the start of a trend rather than a 
blip, then there could be worse to come. But today’s retail sales numbers go 
some way to offsetting these concerns.
Ian Shepherdson (@IanShepherdson) 
April department store sales -2.9% y/y. Non-store retailers +8.5% y/y. 
Structural change, in two numbers.
 <https://twitter.com/IanShepherdson/status/731113385505521664> May 13, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/IanShepherdson/status/731113385505521664> 

Steve Murphy, US economist at Capital Economics, said:

The retail sales report shows that recent claims of the demise of the US 
consumer have been greatly exaggerated. Thanks to a massive 0.9% month on month 
gain in control sales in April and a sizeable rebound in motor vehicle sales, 
it now appears that second-quarter GDP growth will be close to 3.0% 
annualised...

At this stage, a June rate hike is a toss-up. The activity data certainly 
warrants a hike, but separately we are becoming worried that May’s employment 
figures could be pulled down by a couple of big temporary factors. Given how 
cautious the Yellen-led Fed has shown itself to be, the decision next month 
could go either way.

2.10pm BST 14:10  <> 

James Knightley, economist at ING, says that the jump in US retail sales won’t 
be enough to convince the Federal Reserve it’s time to raise interest rates 
just yet.

This report is likely to generate some encouraging headlines suggesting a 
bounceback in consumer activity, and it certainly is good news.

However, the Federal Reserve will want to make sure it isn’t just a one-off. 
With other activity indicators suggesting that there has been something of a 
loss of momentum over the past twelve months we still favour just one-rate rise 
this year, which will most likely come in the third quarter of 2016.

We continue to doubt that the Fed will hike in June. This partly reflect the 
need for a better run of data, but also external risks. One of those is Brexit 
– should the UK vote to leave the EU on June 23rd this could see both the euro 
and sterling tumble against the dollar, which will lead to a tightening of 
financial conditions that may deter the Fed from tightening policy.

The monthly 1.3% jump in April retail sales was the biggest increase in more 
than a year.

The number for March was also revised up, to show a 0.3% rise and not the 0.4% 
drop previously estimated.

The increase was broad-based across different kinds of goods, but car sales 
were particularly strong.

The number of oil rigs in use in the US has dropped for the eighth week in a 
row.

Total rig numbers dropped by 9 to 406, according to the weekly Baker Hughes 
rig count 
<http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&p=irol-reportsother>. Of 
this, 10 oil rigs were cut, but one gas rig was added. This was the lowest 
level since October 2009, as companies concentrated on completing existing 
wells rather than drilling new ones.

The oil price, which was already in negative territory, was little changed 
after the figures, with Brent crude now down 0.79% at $47.7.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for 
all your comments, and we’ll be back next week.
 
Despite a mixed bag of economic data, European shares have ended the week on a 
positive note. There were some poor UK construction figures, while European 
growth figures were revised down, albeit by less than feared. The news from the 
US was better, with positive retail sales and confidence figures providing some 
support for markets.

Investors even took the latest warnings on Brexit - this time from the IMF - 
in their stride. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 34.31 points or 0.56% at 6138.5, just avoiding its 
fourth weekly fall in succession 
 * Germany’s Dax added 0.92% to 9952.90 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.62% to 4319.99 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.44% to 17,729.45 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 8721.5 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.59% to 622.71 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 47 points or 
0.27%.
 
Standard & Poor’s has confirmed its ratings on Italy with a stable outlook. 
The agency said:

We project that Italy’s economic recovery will stay on track, despite having 
revised downward our forecast for real GDP growth to 1.1% in 2016 and 1.3% in 
2017 (from 1.3% and 1.4% in our previous review).

We view as positive, recent initiatives to support Italian banks and reduce 
the high level of nonperforming loans in the banking sector, although we 
believe they alone may not be sufficient to fully address the related 
challenges.

We are affirming our long- and short-term sovereign credit ratings on the 
Republic of Italy at ‘BBB-/A-3’.

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the Italian government will 
continue to implement comprehensive and potentially growth-enhancing structural 
and budgetary reforms that will stabilise, and start reducing, the very high 
public debt ratio.
 
The dollar has continued to strengthen following the better than expected US 
data, despite analysts still not convinced the country’s economy is strong 
enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June meeting.

Against the pound, the US currency is currently at a three week high of 
$1.4343, up around 0.8% on the day. Brexit worries are also weakening sterling, 
with the IMF’s statements the latest in a serious of dire warnings about the 
impact of the UK leaving the EU.
 
Despite the strong US data today, the Federal Reserve may still decide not to 
hike rates in Junes, says James Knightley at ING Bank:

[The sentiment data] bodes well for consumer spending in 2Q16, particularly 
after the stronger than expected April retail sales report. While many at the 
Fed are keen to tighten monetary policy further we still feel that June is 
perhaps a little too early given the softness in data seen earlier in the year. 
We instead continue to favour a 3Q rate hike.
 
Following the better than expected US retail sales figures comes news that 
consumer confidence is higher than forecast so far this month.

The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment rose from 89 in April 
to 95.8 in a preliminary reading for May. Analysts had expected a rise to 90.

This is the highest reading since June 2015.

The survey compilers said:

Consumer sentiment rebounded in early May due to more frequent income gains, 
an improved jobs outlook, and the expectation of lower inflation and interest 
rates. The largest gains were recorded among lower income and younger 
households, although the gains were recorded among all income and age subgroups 
as well as across all regions.

 Nearly all of the gains were in the Expectations Index, which rose to its 
highest level in nearly a year. To be sure, the data still indicated the 
negative impact of uncertainty about future economic policies associated with 
the Presidential election, but its overall impact was overwhelmed by favourable 
economic developments. It is too early to judge the potential impact of the 
election on consumers’ expectations, and one month’s rebound in consumer 
confidence is insufficient to increase the current forecast for 
inflation-adjusted consumer expenditures from 2.5% during 2016.

More on the US retail sales.

The better than expected figures have eased some concerns about the state of 
theUS economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy>, says David 
Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco:

The number comes as a real relief for investors as it rounds off a week which 
has brought a lot of pain for US retailers. Department store operators Macy’s 
and Nordstrom posted weak earnings and slashed their forward guidance for the 
rest of the year. This comes on top of a number of high profile retail 
bankruptcies including American Apparel, Quicksilver and Aeropostale.

 All of this goes to demonstrate the US consumer’s unwillingness (or 
inability) to spend money, particularly on clothes and accessories. This is 
particularly worrying as consumer spending is widely accepted as accounting for 
over 70% of all US economic activity. If the recent disappointing news on 
payrolls and jobless claims proves to be the start of a trend rather than a 
blip, then there could be worse to come. But today’s retail sales numbers go 
some way to offsetting these concerns.
Ian Shepherdson (@IanShepherdson) 
April department store sales -2.9% y/y. Non-store retailers +8.5% y/y. 
Structural change, in two numbers.

Steve Murphy, US economist at Capital Economics, said:

The retail sales report shows that recent claims of the demise of the US 
consumer have been greatly exaggerated. Thanks to a massive 0.9% month on month 
gain in control sales in April and a sizeable rebound in motor vehicle sales, 
it now appears that second-quarter GDP growth will be close to 3.0% 
annualised...

At this stage, a June rate hike is a toss-up. The activity data certainly 
warrants a hike, but separately we are becoming worried that May’s employment 
figures could be pulled down by a couple of big temporary factors. Given how 
cautious the Yellen-led Fed has shown itself to be, the decision next month 
could go either way.

US markets have opened roughly flat, just a touch into the red:

 * Dow Jones: -0.1% at 17,703 
 * S&P 500: -0.1% at 2,062 
 * Nasdaq: -0.1% at 4,731

Christine Lagarde’s warning this morning that Brexit would send shockwaves 
through the UK economy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit>
 - prompting the stock market and house prices to crash - is not helping 
sentiment.
 
James Knightley, economist at ING, says that the jump in US retail sales won’t 
be enough to convince the Federal Reserve it’s time to raise interest rates 
just yet.

This report is likely to generate some encouraging headlines suggesting a 
bounceback in consumer activity, and it certainly is good news.

However, the Federal Reserve will want to make sure it isn’t just a one-off. 
With other activity indicators suggesting that there has been something of a 
loss of momentum over the past twelve months we still favour just one-rate rise 
this year, which will most likely come in the third quarter of 2016.

We continue to doubt that the Fed will hike in June. This partly reflect the 
need for a better run of data, but also external risks. One of those is Brexit 
– should the UK vote to leave the EU on June 23rd this could see both the euro 
and sterling tumble against the dollar, which will lead to a tightening of 
financial conditions that may deter the Fed from tightening policy.
