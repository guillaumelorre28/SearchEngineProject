Graduates of Goldsmiths, University of London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/goldsmiths> who have become household 
names in contemporary art, including Damien Hirst, Antony Gormley, Sarah Lucas, 
Yinka Shonibare and Michael Craig-Martin, are donating works to raise funds for 
a new art gallery at their old art school. Sam Taylor-Johnson, Julian Opie and 
Steve McQueen, whose Twelve Years a Slave won an Oscar last year, have also 
given pieces.

The works, including a spot painting and a swirl painting by Hirst, a bronze 
by Lucas, and one of Gormley’s cast iron standing men, are expected to raise 
most of the £2.8m cost of the gallery at a Christie’s auction next month.

The gallery, which will become a public contemporary art space in south 
London, will be created in the shell of the Laurie Grove Baths, formerly a 
public bath house built in 1898 for the southLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> poor. It also held a swimming pool 
where generations of local people learned to swim – and danced when the main 
pool was boarded over to form a dance floor – until the complex finally closed 
in 1991.

The winning design by Assemble, a London-based architecture collective, will 
incorporate the giant black steel tanks which originally held the water supply 
for the baths.

Goldsmiths alumni include 30 Turner Prize nominees, and seven winners. The 
Young British Artists movement of the late 1980s grew out of the art school 
when Hirst launched an exhibition called Freeze while a second year student 
there. Hirst, like many of the other young artists, was taught by Michael 
Craig-Martin.

Gormley said the gallery would become a resource for the university and 
London. “Goldsmiths remains one of the liveliest, most challenging and 
ambitious of Britain’s universities. Its art department is blessed by being 
part of a university campus with many allied disciplines engaged in research 
that has direct relevance for the evolution of the visual culture of our time.”
