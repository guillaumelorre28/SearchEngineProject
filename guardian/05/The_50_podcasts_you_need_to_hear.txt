Alice Isn’t Dead <http://aliceisntdead.libsyn.com/>

The creepy podcast from the Welcome To Night Vale 
<http://www.welcometonightvale.com/> gang

The makers of the gloriously weird Welcome To Night Vale are behind this eerie 
podcast. Those concerned that they might have to get up to speed with that 
series’ labyrinthine backstory, fear not: this is not a spinoff, nor a tie-in, 
but a completely new serialised drama. Alice Isn’t Dead tells the story of a 
truck driver searching for her presumed-dead wife, and experiencing much 
enigmatic spookiness along the way. The bad news is that you can’t just jump 
in; you have to go back and listen from the beginning. The good news is that 
the episodes are only 20 minutes long, so you’ll catch up in no time. And you 
really should.SH

You Must Remember This <http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/>

The podcast that dishes the dirt on old-world Hollywood

This secret history of Hollywood podcast doubled its listenership with a 
special on the Charles Manson murders. But narrator Karina Longworth, a former 
film critic with an appetite for meticulous research and an LA purr, is just as 
compelling on Frank Sinatra’s weird space foray or the troubled life of 30s 
bombshell Frances Farmer. It’s a film podcast that actually feels cinematic, 
with crackly clips and incidental music. Like attending the ultimate starry 
cocktail party.BT

Another Round <https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround>

The podcast for those who love a drink... or 10

Even though the worst thing in the universe is to be sober around drunk 
people, Buzzfeed’s Another Round podcast somehow manages to feel inclusive. Its 
gimmick is extraordinarily flimsy – Tracy Clayton and Heben Nigatu (pictured, 
left)talk to each other and drink – and yet their conversations, on everything 
from racial politics to how to pronounce posh British actors’ names, manage to 
be both earnest and wide-ranging. Hamilton’s Lin-Manuel Miranda pops up for one 
brilliantly freewheeling episode. Bim Adewunmi, formerly of this parish, turns 
up in another. Better than it sounds, honest.SH

A new entrant in the overstuffed “two blokes ramble on about whatever” genre. 
It has an unfair advantage: one of the blokes is Bob Mortimer, of Vic and Bob 
fame. He talks with humorist Andy “Get in the Sea” Dawson in a show where the 
promise of “at least 8% football content” is more likely to refer to Raheem 
Sterling’s home cinema or Leighton Baines’s tiny shorts than the merits of a 
double-pivot midfield. It’s 98% funnier than regular footy bantz.JS

The Allusionist <http://www.theallusionist.org/>

The vitally verbose pod for those in love with words

If you’re bored of language, you’re bored of life. At least that’s how it 
feels listening to comedian and etymology enthusiast Helen Zaltzman, who you 
might know from her other podcast Answer Me This. This fortnightly series is 
all about words, from the 5,000-year history of the emoji to the smallest 
language in the world. She chats with experts from crime reporters and CBT 
therapists to her brother, standup Andy Zaltzman. The Detonating The C-Bomb 
episode has proved predictably popular, while one titled Post-Love finds 
listeners sharing their worst breakup lines. Imagine Dictionary Corner playing 
the Edinburgh festival fringe.BT

Death, Sex & Money <http://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney/>

The podcast that asks life’s difficult questions

Anna Sale’s interview-led podcast tackles the “big questions and hard choices 
that are often left out of polite conversation”, all of which feature at least 
one of the three magic words in the show’s title. So we hear from the former 
NFL player who has fallen out of love with the sport, the Sesame Street star 
battling memories of her own childhood and the sex worker trying to support her 
family. Sale is a fine interviewer, warm and empathetic but always willing to 
push forward with questions that some might leave unasked.GM

The Comedian’s Comedian <http://www.comedianscomedian.com/>

The podcast that stands up for standups

Comedian Stuart Goldsmith’s career has been given a boost by this nerdy yet 
inclusive podcast. Exploring the intricacies of standup, from writing methods 
to internal struggles, what might come across as a specialist series turns out 
to be an education in creativity that even outsiders will enjoy. Goldsmith’s 
forensic interview style often prompts fascinatingly raw responses – Tony Law’s 
drunken joyride of an interview is an agonising/enthralling listen. Both a 
great way of learning what drives major-league acts (Jimmy Carr, David Cross et 
al) and a an introduction to comics unnoticed by the mainstream.HG

“I shall prove that Heaven’s Clover exists. But first, I shall give each and

Clement as Lord Joseph Banks, a “squillionaire” berk who sets sail from the 
Gravy Isles on a quest to prove his mad-scientist uncle (also Clement) right. A 
gag-packed script – think Jules Verne redone by Yonderland – is finessed with 
lavish production and great music. Sumptuous.JS

baseball to US presidential campaigns, foreign correspondent Kelly McEvers

Tales of true crime, once banished to a shelf at the back of WH Smith, are 
flourishing online. Criminal approaches the genre from a thoughtful angle, 
privileging curious tales and quirks of jurisprudence over anything overly 
grisly. In an episode titled The Finger, host Phoebe Judge interviews a man 
defending his legal right to flip off the cops, while Jolly Jane is the tale of 
a nurse operating in 19th-century Boston who eased her patients to an early 
death via an injection of morphine. Cheerful stuff!LP

admissions on everything from dealing with grief to his dog, Rosie. Worth a 
five-star rating for the DIY jingles alone.HG

space by mistake. Cue silly songs rhyming “android” with “overjoyed”, delivered 
in a Pet Shop Boys style, puns that will make seven-year-olds’ giggles rain 
down, and gags about pop, space and sandals. So far only three episodes are on 
iTunes – each one is crowdfunded and when they reach their total, they make 
another – so treat yourself to the lot.HV

quick-fire one-liners that ensue. Start with episode 35: The Saddest Hello 
Since Lionel Richie, where the duo come out as Bieber sympathisers, discuss 
Drake’s penis muscles and wonder how Adele can be so sad when she’s dating a 
“hot bear”.HV

Josie Long – The Beef and Dairy Network podcast 
<http://www.beefanddairynetwork.com/>

“It’s odd, incredibly funny and the production values are wonderful. Ben 
Partridge plays it pitch perfectly. His guests improvise so well you can’t 
believe it’s off the cuff. Mike Bubbins as Eli Roberts is my favourite.”

Adam Buxton - Throwing Shade <http://www.throwingshade.com/#opening> 

“My podcast producer Seamus got me into Throwing Shade, an American podcast 
hosted by Erin Gibson and Bryan Safi (who describe themselves in their intro as 
“feminasty” and “homosensual” respectively). To paraphrase Erin and Bryan, they 
discuss topics that affect women and gays and treat them with much less respect 
than they deserve, which means they veer from baffling LA gossip to serious 
political subjects with an enjoyable mixture of silliness and outrage. When 
they get the giggles it reminds me of doing the 6 Music music radio show with 
Joe. They have that thing that is often such a big part of making a good 
podcast: a shared comedic language of cajoling and teasing that the listener is 
invited to feel part of.”

Scroobius Pip – The Joe Rogan Experience <http://podcasts.joerogan.net/> 

“This is the podcast that got me into podcasts. Two to three hour 
conversations that can go from discussing the vastness of reality looking both 
outside of the known universe and inside on a cellular level to making dart 
jokes at the flick of a switch.”

Helen Zaltzman – The Dinner Party Download 
<http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/>

“It’s what I listen to when I can’t figure out what mood I’m in, because it 
has everything: interviews, music, food, drinks, jokes.”

Not forgetting... the Guardian’s range of podcasts
