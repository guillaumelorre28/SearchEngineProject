Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening) have been to see 
their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) perform in her high-school 
cheerleading squad. During the show, Lester found himself stricken with lust 
for a beautiful blonde cheerleader. The same girl, Angela (Mena Suvari), now 
waits outside the school with Jane. Jane catches sight of her parents.

"Shit, they're still here." 

Carolyn and Lester approach, both beaming. 

"Hey, I really enjoyed that." 

"Congratulations honey, you were great." 

Lester turns to Angela. He lowers his voice to a gruff approximation of Barry 
White.

"Hi. I'm Lester. Janey's dad." 

"Hi." 

Jane scowls at her father. 

"This is my friend, Angela Hayes." 

"OK. Good to meet you. You were also good tonight. Very precise." 

"Thanks." 

"Nice to meet you Angela", smiles Carolyn. She turns to Jane. 

"Honey, I am so proud of you. You know, I watched you very closely - and you 
didn't screw up once! OK, we have to go."

"So," enquires Lester, "what are you girls doing now?" 

"Dad!" 

"We're going for pizza." 

Lester stares at Angela. 

"Really? Do you need a ride? We can give you a ride. I have a car. Do you want 
to come with us?"

"Thanks, but I have a car." 

"That's great, because Janey's thinking about getting a car. Aren't you honey?"

"Dad! Mom's waiting for you."
