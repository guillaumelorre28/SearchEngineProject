Quesionts, and one on the Greek situation and the need to legislate any 
contingency measures, which the Greeks had said is not possible 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/22/eurozone-finance-ministers-hold-talks-on-greece-business-live?page=with:block-571a213be4b07c29fbd5f153#block-571a213be4b07c29fbd5f153>
.

Dijsselbloem said the institutions will work with the Greek authorities to 
design the contingency measures. They need to be credible.

[There was mention of a fourth bailout]. Dijsselbloem said this is not about a 
fourth bailout. This is about if the [proposed] measures do not deliver. “When 
I look at the latest figures, the Greeks are on track, it is an extra security 
package. If there are legal constraints, we will design it in a way that 
delivers... and needs to be legally possible of course.”

Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank talked of low carbon economy. Discussed 
how to help consumers in their decisions by increasing transparency.

Essential that adequate price incentives are available. Better disclosure of 
climate exposure is needed.

Stress testing should be introduced [in a co-ordinated way]. This could be 
taken up, for example, by the European systemic risk board.

Ministers was speedy implementation of transparency, including Panama.

Panama Papers gave another boost to our agenda to tackle tax evasion and money 
laundering. Clear view that Europe should lead.

Secondly they discussed strengthening the banking union, with differing views 
on how to achieve it.

Finally, Panama Papers. Hadn’t initially intended to discuss it. They were 
also discussed in G20 and last week the G5 took initiative on information on 
ultimate ownership.

(As George Osborne said earlier ) 28 others joined it, which is a great 
outcome says Dijsselbloem.

The damage done to Volkswagen from the emissions scandal has been revealed in 
its full year results. Julia Kollewe writes:

Volkswagen has slumped to its first annual loss in more than 20 years after 
making a €16.2bn (£12.6bn) provision for costs relating to the diesel emissions 
scandal.

This pushed VW into an operating loss of €4.1bn 
<http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2016/04/VW_FYP.html>
 for 2015, bigger than analysts had expected and the company’s first annual 
loss since 1993, after a €12.7bn profit in 2014.

The company more than doubled its provision for fixing diesel cars to €16.2bn, 
a day afterannouncing plans for the biggest car buyback in history in the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/21/volkswagen-buying-cars-back-vw-settlement-emissions-scandal>
, potentially almost 500,000 vehicles, as part of a deal with the State 
Department to halt more than 600 class action civil suits.

VW said the provision related to the emissions scandal, “among other things 
for pending technical modifications and customer-related measures as well as 
global legal risks”.

The German carmaker stunned the world when it admitted last September that it 
had installed software 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-timeline-events>
 in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests – potentially affecting a total of 
11m cars worldwide.

Chief executive Matthias Müller said: “The current crisis – as the figures 
presented today also reveal – is having a huge impact on Volkswagen’s financial 
position. Yet we have the firm intention and the means to handle the difficult 
situation we are in using our own resources.”

Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week.
 
And here is some video of the opening remarks from Eurogroup President Jeroen 
Dijsselbloem at the Ecofin press conference.
 
And with that the press conference is over. Meanwhile Dijsselbloem has tweeted 
more on the Panama Papers:

Quesionts, and one on the Greek situation and the need to legislate any 
contingency measures, which the Greeks had said is not possible 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/22/eurozone-finance-ministers-hold-talks-on-greece-business-live?page=with:block-571a213be4b07c29fbd5f153#block-571a213be4b07c29fbd5f153>
.

Dijsselbloem said the institutions will work with the Greek authorities to 
design the contingency measures. They need to be credible.

[There was mention of a fourth bailout]. Dijsselbloem said this is not about a 
fourth bailout. This is about if the [proposed] measures do not deliver. “When 
I look at the latest figures, the Greeks are on track, it is an extra security 
package. If there are legal constraints, we will design it in a way that 
delivers... and needs to be legally possible of course.”
 
Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank talked of low carbon economy. Discussed 
how to help consumers in their decisions by increasing transparency.

Essential that adequate price incentives are available. Better disclosure of 
climate exposure is needed.

Stress testing should be introduced [in a co-ordinated way]. This could be 
taken up, for example, by the European systemic risk board.

Working to get agreement on anti-tax avoidance, hope for agreement in May, 
says Dijsselbloem.

Also list of non-co-operative jurisdictions.

On money laundering, focus was on terrorist funding, now want more on 
beneficial ownership and others.

Ministers was speedy implementation of transparency, including Panama.

Panama Papers gave another boost to our agenda to tackle tax evasion and money 
laundering. Clear view that Europe should lead.
 
Secondly they discussed strengthening the banking union, with differing views 
on how to achieve it.

Finally, Panama Papers. Hadn’t initially intended to discuss it. They were 
also discussed in G20 and last week the G5 took initiative on information on 
ultimate ownership.

(As George Osborne said earlier ) 28 others joined it, which is a great 
outcome says Dijsselbloem.
 
Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said duing lunch, finance ministers 
discussed the EU budget, and how the financail framework could better respond 
to unforeseen events.

He mentions in particular the response to challenges like the migration crisis.

The damage done to Volkswagen from the emissions scandal has been revealed in 
its full year results. Julia Kollewe writes:

Volkswagen has slumped to its first annual loss in more than 20 years after 
making a €16.2bn (£12.6bn) provision for costs relating to the diesel emissions 
scandal.

This pushed VW into an operating loss of €4.1bn 
<http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2016/04/VW_FYP.html>
 for 2015, bigger than analysts had expected and the company’s first annual 
loss since 1993, after a €12.7bn profit in 2014.

The company more than doubled its provision for fixing diesel cars to €16.2bn, 
a day afterannouncing plans for the biggest car buyback in history in the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/21/volkswagen-buying-cars-back-vw-settlement-emissions-scandal>
, potentially almost 500,000 vehicles, as part of a deal with the State 
Department to halt more than 600 class action civil suits.

VW said the provision related to the emissions scandal, “among other things 
for pending technical modifications and customer-related measures as well as 
global legal risks”.

The German carmaker stunned the world when it admitted last September that it 
had installed software 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-timeline-events>
 in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests – potentially affecting a total of 
11m cars worldwide.

Chief executive Matthias Müller said: “The current crisis – as the figures 
presented today also reveal – is having a huge impact on Volkswagen’s financial 
position. Yet we have the firm intention and the means to handle the difficult 
situation we are in using our own resources.”
