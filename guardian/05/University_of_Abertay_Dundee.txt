You could never accuse Abertay of being stuck in the past. It offers 
world-leading courses in computer arts and computer games technology, has some 
of the best IT facilities in the UK, and an £8m library. Dundee itself is a 
bustling, hard-working kind of city, the fourth largest in Scotland and also, 
apparently, the warmest, thanks to its south-facing aspect. In 2005, a new £6m 
student centre with cinema, coffee shop, nightclub and exhibition space opened. 
There are good local arts scenes, with a particularly good track record in 
music. Snow Patrol was formed by Dundee students, if you like that sort of 
thing.

Fees
Fees for all undergraduate courses are £1,735 for new students in 2007-8. 
Scottish students have their fees paid for them.

Bursaries
Means-tested hardship fund, with an average payout of £1,000. Another similar 
fund for mature students. Other scholarships and bursaries available.

Accommodation
Priority is given to first year students and the accommodation office is 
helpful in finding private rooms for students. All university accommodation is 
in single rooms. Average rent is around £65 a week.

Facilities
A higher rate of PCs to students that almost any other university. There are 
new teaching facilities and the brand new student centre too.

Transport
The campus is right in the city centre, so short walks will take you most 
places you want to be. Dundee is 90 minutes by train from Glasgow and an hour 
from Edinburgh. There's an airport with direct links to London too.
