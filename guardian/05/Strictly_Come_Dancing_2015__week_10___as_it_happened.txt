So that’s the end of Peter’s Strictly journey! He makes a heartfelt speech and 
spreads some love around. Obviously he has plenty more to say, but Tess cuts 
him off and sends them off to do their final dance to Simple Minds’ ‘Don’t You 
Forget About Me’. This could be Peter’s anthem for life.

So who will the judges choose? All of them pretend this is really tough 
decision, then save Kellie and Kevin.

This is a considerably smoother American Smooth from Peter and Janette, loads 
better than last night. Too little too late, I fear, but you can’t deny he 
wants this BAD.

Time for the dance-off! Kellie and Kevin’s Salsa is still a fun and 
frolic-filled affair, and she’s a much better dancer than Peter by a country 
mile, so this should be a fairly straightforward affair.

It’s Musicals Week next week. Everything we loved about this week’s show is 
about to be cast off in favour of crappy props, comedy VTs and bloody jazz 
hands. BOO TO THIS.

They are singing Dean Martin’s ‘Sway’ in Italian, I think. Or maybe Spanish. 
Can’t be sure. Lovely bit of Argentine Tango from Natalie and Gleb either way.

More music, this time from professional warble-totty Il Divo, because it

I think the only box we haven’t ticked this series is Katherine Jenkins, but 
we’ve got three weeks left, so don’t give up hope.

First musical interlude is courtesy of professional Freddie Mercury 
impersonator and American Idol winner Adam Lambert. Interestingly (or not, 
depending on how you feel about these things), this performance was recorded 
two weeks ago when I was in the studio. This is like actual time travel.

So who is the first couple in tonight’s dance-off, and who is safely through 
to next week? Georgia and Giovanni are safe (cue weeping), along with Helen and 
Aljaz.

First couple in the dance-off tonight is…KELLIE AND KEVIN! I claim my ten 
pounds.

Kellie is feeling OK about being in the dance-off, possibly because she knows 
there’s a fair chance she’s up against Peter and Janette.

Last night on Strictly: a corker of a show. Fabulous dancing from Helen and 
Aljaz, Georgia and Giovanni and Jay and Aliona, fair-to-middling from Kellie 
and Kevin, Katie and Anton and Anita and Gleb. Peter and Janette was a bit 
lacking, I think Peter may have peaked in Week One.


Also: Len being more random than usual, Bruno waving his 9 and 10 paddles like 
a man possessed, and the Quickstepathon. Less said about that the better, 
frankly.

So that’s it for another week! Thank you all for joining in, I’ll be back for 
next week’s QUARTER FINALS, which has a musical feem. So that’s nice. Have a 
brilliant week, and I’ll see you next Saturday! Keeeeep dancing!
 
So that’s the end of Peter’s Strictly journey! He makes a heartfelt speech and 
spreads some love around. Obviously he has plenty more to say, but Tess cuts 
him off and sends them off to do their final dance to Simple Minds’ ‘Don’t You 
Forget About Me’. This could be Peter’s anthem for life.
 
So who will the judges choose? All of them pretend this is really tough 
decision, then save Kellie and Kevin.
 
This is a considerably smoother American Smooth from Peter and Janette, loads 
better than last night. Too little too late, I fear, but you can’t deny he 
wants this BAD.
 
Time for the dance-off! Kellie and Kevin’s Salsa is still a fun and 
frolic-filled affair, and she’s a much better dancer than Peter by a country 
mile, so this should be a fairly straightforward affair.
 
It’s Musicals Week next week. Everything we loved about this week’s show is 
about to be cast off in favour of crappy props, comedy VTs and bloody jazz 
hands. BOO TO THIS.

 
They are singing Dean Martin’s ‘Sway’ in Italian, I think. Or maybe Spanish. 
Can’t be sure. Lovely bit of Argentine Tango from Natalie and Gleb either way.
 
More music, this time from professional warble-totty Il Divo, because it 
wouldn’t be Strictly without wheeling out a bit of tedious popera.


I think the only box we haven’t ticked this series is Katherine Jenkins, but 
we’ve got three weeks left, so don’t give up hope.
 
So who else is in the dance-off? Jay and Aliona are safe, along with Katie and 
Anton and Anita and Gleb.


Second couple in the dance-off…PETER AND JANETTE! Bye.

 
Did I miss anything good on Len’s Lens? I popped into the kitchen to bung some 
oven chips in.
 
Kevin and Karen are dong a contemporary affair that involves a lot of rolling 
around on the floor. Karen is wearing lace pyjamas. No.
 
First musical interlude is courtesy of professional Freddie Mercury 
impersonator and American Idol winner Adam Lambert. Interestingly (or not, 
depending on how you feel about these things), this performance was recorded 
two weeks ago when I was in the studio. This is like actual time travel.
 
Wait, what fresh hell is this? Giovanni just suggested that next week has a 
THEME, and it’s musicals. A THEME, this late on? Oh Strictly, why do you punish 
us so?
 
So who is the first couple in tonight’s dance-off, and who is safely through 
to next week? Georgia and Giovanni are safe (cue weeping), along with Helen and 
Aljaz.

First couple in the dance-off tonight is…KELLIE AND KEVIN! I claim my ten 
pounds.

Kellie is feeling OK about being in the dance-off, possibly because she knows 
there’s a fair chance she’s up against Peter and Janette.
 
Last night on Strictly: a corker of a show. Fabulous dancing from Helen and 
Aljaz, Georgia and Giovanni and Jay and Aliona, fair-to-middling from Kellie 
and Kevin, Katie and Anton and Anita and Gleb. Peter and Janette was a bit 
lacking, I think Peter may have peaked in Week One.


Also: Len being more random than usual, Bruno waving his 9 and 10 paddles like 
a man possessed, and the Quickstepathon. Less said about that the better, 
frankly.
