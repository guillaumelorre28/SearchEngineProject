Orange and white is the new camel and grey

When a colour combination appears in a blockbuster film and on the Céline 
catwalk, you know a fashion moment is in progress. So it is with orange and 
white, as modelled by the little, round BB-8 – a droid so adorable that 
watching him produces the same oxytocin release as petting a kitten – and his 
equally adorable owner, Poe Dameron. If you are neither a robot nor a 
resistance fighter, take inspiration fromlook 20 of Phoebe Philo’s

 autumn/winter 2015 collection and pair a white shirt with something 
unexpectedly orange.

won Shoe of the Year

Is Rey’s triple bun stegosaurus up-do the new Princess Leia cinnamon rolls? In 
a word, yes – as the prevalence of “how to do Rey hair” YouTube tutorials 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZuSqy9E2M> confirms. But eagle-eyed viewers 
will notice a more complex tonsorial joke on the resistance base: one 
character, Lieutenant Connix – whose only line is, “General, are you seeing 
this?” – wears double buns that look suspiciously like pastry. In fact, the 
actor is Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher’s daughter, who also plays Chanel #3 in
Ryan Murphy’s black TV comedy Scream Queens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/07/scream-queens-alpha-fashion-at-its-most-evil>
, in which she perennially wears ear muffs. In the Star Wars universe there is 
no such thing as coincidence.

Sure, Poe Dameron and the other resistance fighters look great in their boiler 
suits, but Princess Leia’s takes the prize. Her khaki version – all popped 
collars and precisely turned cuffs – is tough, chic and comfortable at the same 
time, which must be a blessed relief after confronting the world with your 
bottom in a gold bikini. It’s exactly what a general would wear, and also an 
outfit idea for the rest of us to nick for walking the dog –see Topshop for 
similar

Han Solo has always had a look – knee-high boots, tight trousers, a shirt and 
a cropped jacket or waistcoat, as inspired by western films – and he sticks to 
it in Episode VII, despite insisting to Leia that he is actually wearing a new 
jacket. But his devotion to the aesthetic can be damaging. It suggests a man 
trapped in the drama of the past and it makes him chilly. At one point, he is 
handed a parka – to combat freezing conditions – but grimaces and takes it off 
at the first opportunity. Clearly, the reformed smuggler is not aware that in 
the 30 years he has been off screen functional wear has shed its “tourist at a 
bus stop” connotations –even Drake wears North Face 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/10/north-face-how-it-set-the-winter-style-agenda>
 now. This knowledge might have kept him warmer.

 Villainous storm troopers. Photograph: Allstar/Disney/Lucasfilm 
Lots of villainous masks to decode in Episode VII – but which is the most 
high-fashion? True front-row types would probably findKylo Ren 
<https://www.starwarsnewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Kylo-Ren1.jpg>’s a 
bit, well, triggering – that menacing quadruple-chrome-lined forehead looks too 
much like the wrinkles produced by a furrowed brow for fashion-industry 
approval. Captain Phasma’s mask is sleek – very on-trend silver coupled with a 
sexy off-the-shoulder cape – but the storm troopers’ monochrome styling and 
dark glasses are unequivocally the best. As with Ray Ban sunglasses and the
Chanel 2.55 <http://eluxemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/15390.jpg>, 
sometimes you can’t improve on a classic.
