So that’s it for another Strictly week, and only two to go! Thank you all for 
joining in, and I’ll see you next Saturday at 6.50pm for the semi-final, which 
involves TWO DANCES. It’s the final push, so let’s make it count. See you next 
week! Hx

Judge Rinder thanks the judges, because he knows how difficult it is to be a 
judge. He then makes Oksana cry by being entirely lovely.

They dance their final dance to Defying Gravity from Wicked, and I am already 
missing Rinder’s sense of fun (a lot), his latin hips (a bit) and his dancing 
sex face (less so). Rinder has without doubt been on the biggest journey of 
this year’s Strictly quarter finalists, and I’m sorry to see him go. Things 
might be decidedly light on laughs from here on in.

As expected, all the judges save Ore and Joanne, which means JUDGE RINDER AND 
OKSANA are going home.

Judge Rinder’s Samba is still an absolute joy, albeit entirely shambolic – it 
won’t be enough to save him, but he’s been an absolute delight this series.

So Ore and Joanne are up first. This is still a bit sedate for my liking, but 
I thing Ore’s top line has definitely improved. I’d still love to see him in 
the final, ideally with Claudia and Louise, but that isn’t going to happen.

It’s time for a musical interlude, courtesy of legendary musical theatre 
luvvie Elaine Paige bellowing Don’t Cry For Me Argentina, wearing a dress made 
of cobwebs and jellyfish.


Alas the picture desk doesn’t seem to have a shot of that dress. Either it’s 
an endangered species, or we’re all being encouraged to pretend that never 
happened.

Apparently there are two dances next week. I had no idea, they should have 
mentioned it sooner.

Last night on Strictly – a slightly lacklustre Musicals Week, with far too 
many superfluous backing dancers and some odd music choices. Highlights: 
Rinder’s Samba hips, Oti’s Beyonce hair, Louise looking like she’s having fun, 
the West Side Story pro dance.

Lowlights: Anton’s impression of Bruce Forsyth, Bruno’s impression of Donny 
Osmond, Kevin’s chaps, no Ed Balls.

So that’s it for another Strictly week, and only two to go! Thank you all for 
joining in, and I’ll see you next Saturday at 6.50pm for the semi-final, which 
involves TWO DANCES. It’s the final push, so let’s make it count. See you next 
week! Hx

 
Judge Rinder thanks the judges, because he knows how difficult it is to be a 
judge. He then makes Oksana cry by being entirely lovely.

They dance their final dance to Defying Gravity from Wicked, and I am already 
missing Rinder’s sense of fun (a lot), his latin hips (a bit) and his dancing 
sex face (less so). Rinder has without doubt been on the biggest journey of 
this year’s Strictly quarter finalists, and I’m sorry to see him go. Things 
might be decidedly light on laughs from here on in.
 
As expected, all the judges save Ore and Joanne, which means JUDGE RINDER AND 
OKSANA are going home.

Judge Rinder’s Samba is still an absolute joy, albeit entirely shambolic – it 
won’t be enough to save him, but he’s been an absolute delight this series.
 
So Ore and Joanne are up first. This is still a bit sedate for my liking, but 
I thing Ore’s top line has definitely improved. I’d still love to see him in 
the final, ideally with Claudia and Louise, but that isn’t going to happen.
 
 So who is joining Ore and Joanne in the dance-off? As expected, it’s Judge 
Rinder an Oksana, who immediately gives the crowd a wave. He knows he’s going 
home. Boo.
 It’s Ore . Rinder in the dance-off Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA  
It’s time for a musical interlude, courtesy of legendary musical theatre 
luvvie Elaine Paige bellowing Don’t Cry For Me Argentina, wearing a dress made 
of cobwebs and jellyfish.


Alas the picture desk doesn’t seem to have a shot of that dress. Either it’s 
an endangered species, or we’re all being encouraged to pretend that never 
happened.

 
Apparently there are two dances next week. I had no idea, they should have 
mentioned it sooner.
 
You know what would improve Ore and Joanne’s Foxtrot, Bruno? Taking a scythe 
to the superfluous flowers.

couple in the bottom two? Claudia and AJ are safe (hooray!), along with Louise 
and Kevin!
