Next week looks fully Carry On or a particularly lively night in Hi-De-Hi’s 
Hawaiian ballroom. I won’t be missing that. If you think you can stomach it, 
join me here next week at the same time.

I must go, my jet ski is waiting. Good bye.

So, and then there were nine. Did you predict the leavers? I certainly didn’t. 
I mean I predict Karthik’s departure every week but he just seemed unkillable 
as the weeks went on.

Back at the house, Alana and Dillon waltz back in to screams and shock as a 
lone voice calls out weakly, “Samuel? Samuel?” Samuel’s gone, friend. And he’s 
not coming back.

Oh the sailor’s hat is from NEXT week. That’s something to look forward to.

I fall for it every time, like a labrador being dummy-thrown a ball. How on 
EARTH is Samuel leaving for knocking a couple of quid off a snorkel? Or

Dillon’s a nice guy but we know what happens to those types on this show. Alan 
doesn’t want to hear anymore and the piano arpeggios of expectant doom rise on 
the soundtrack.

Oh the finger it moves and Alana is let off this time. So, Samuel or Dillon. 
It’s obviously Dillon.

Karrren tells Alana she’s too quiet and softens it with a bit of praise, but 
she’s basically using her enormous hair to dominate her. Alana cowers.

Samuel must, however, defend his record on independent price-setting first. 
Maybe Alan really doesn’t want a loose cannon. Or perhaps he’s just throwing 
shade at Samuel first before firing the other two into the sun.

Grainne and Courtney are sent back to the house and the other three are told 
to go outside and think about what they’ve done. Karthik is in the taxi of no 
hope, saying it should have been Sam-yew-elle. Funny pronunciation.

Karrren, Alan and Claud discuss who to kill/fire next. Or maybe just 
keel-haul? And back they come - Alana, Dillon and Samuel. It can’t be Samuel.

Dillon talks up his visual flair but can’t put his finger on where things went 
wrong oh wait, yes he can. It’s Karthik’s fault.

Alan makes some dreadful quip about the skipper skipping his duties and then 
goes all serious. I think he’s going to actually chop his head off he’s so 
angry.

He does! Karthik is fired! No bringing two team mates back, he’s gone. Who is 
next?

If it’s a straight fight between Karthik and Samuel, I’d bet the farm on Sam 
staying. Meanwhile, Alana is embarrassed at her £42 worth of sales and says 
it’s only for the lack of “two more fish”. Those two fish may have cost her the 
game.

Karthik calls it a “very horrible day in business” in an attempt to come up 
with something as iconic as the Queen’s annus horribilis.

Claud says the team should have “approached customers” during the day to ask 
them if they’d like to buy a jet ski. Yeah, cold-selling jet skis. That’ll 
work. Oh Claud.

Jessica’s arse is absolutely killing after rowing. Someone get her a drink.

Next week looks fully Carry On or a particularly lively night in Hi-De-Hi’s 
Hawaiian ballroom. I won’t be missing that. If you think you can stomach it, 
join me here next week at the same time.

I must go, my jet ski is waiting. Good bye.
 
So, and then there were nine. Did you predict the leavers? I certainly didn’t. 
I mean I predict Karthik’s departure every week but he just seemed unkillable 
as the weeks went on.
 
Back at the house, Alana and Dillon waltz back in to screams and shock as a 
lone voice calls out weakly, “Samuel? Samuel?” Samuel’s gone, friend. And he’s 
not coming back.

Oh the sailor’s hat is from NEXT week. That’s something to look forward to.
 
I fall for it every time, like a labrador being dummy-thrown a ball. How on 
EARTH is Samuel leaving for knocking a couple of quid off a snorkel? Or 
whatever it was.
 
Is it Dillon? No. It’s Samuel.
 
Dillon knows it’s Dillon. We know it’s Dillon.
 
Dillon’s a nice guy but we know what happens to those types on this show. Alan 
doesn’t want to hear anymore and the piano arpeggios of expectant doom rise on 
the soundtrack.

Oh the finger it moves and Alana is let off this time. So, Samuel or Dillon. 
It’s obviously Dillon.
 
Karrren tells Alana she’s too quiet and softens it with a bit of praise, but 
she’s basically using her enormous hair to dominate her. Alana cowers.
 
Samuel must, however, defend his record on independent price-setting first. 
Maybe Alan really doesn’t want a loose cannon. Or perhaps he’s just throwing 
shade at Samuel first before firing the other two into the sun.
 
Grainne and Courtney are sent back to the house and the other three are told 
to go outside and think about what they’ve done. Karthik is in the taxi of no 
hope, saying it should have been Sam-yew-elle. Funny pronunciation.

Karrren, Alan and Claud discuss who to kill/fire next. Or maybe just 
keel-haul? And back they come - Alana, Dillon and Samuel. It can’t be Samuel.
 
Grainne is asked to choose two colleagues to bring back into the boardroom 
instead. Zoinks!
 
Dillon talks up his visual flair but can’t put his finger on where things went 
wrong oh wait, yes he can. It’s Karthik’s fault.

Alan makes some dreadful quip about the skipper skipping his duties and then 
goes all serious. I think he’s going to actually chop his head off he’s so 
angry.

He does! Karthik is fired! No bringing two team mates back, he’s gone. Who is 
next?
 
If it’s a straight fight between Karthik and Samuel, I’d bet the farm on Sam 
staying. Meanwhile, Alana is embarrassed at her £42 worth of sales and says 
it’s only for the lack of “two more fish”. Those two fish may have cost her the 
game.
 
Karthik calls it a “very horrible day in business” in an attempt to come up 
with something as iconic as the Queen’s annus horribilis.

Claud says the team should have “approached customers” during the day to ask 
them if they’d like to buy a jet ski. Yeah, cold-selling jet skis. That’ll 
work. Oh Claud.
 
At the sad cafe, Courtney is furious to be drinking “shit coffee” as well he 
might. Samuel’s early blame-shifting is recalled efficiently from his rolodex 
memory while Karthik flails wildly, telling him he’s a snake in the grass. Hey, 
it worked for Trump. Just shout, It’s rigged. It’s rigged, until someone lets 
you win.
 
Fran thinks the curse of Nebula has now been broken, before getting into the 
boat and presumably watching it sink beneath the waves. We are informed that 
Jessica’s arse is absolutely killing after rowing. Someone get her a drink.
 
Fran’s team wins a trip to the Leander rowing club to meet James Cracknell and 
presumably try not to crack her entire face in twain with the sheer joy of not 
being a loser.
