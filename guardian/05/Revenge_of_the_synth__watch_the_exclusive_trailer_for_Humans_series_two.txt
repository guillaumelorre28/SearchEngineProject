It says something about our current uneasy relationship with technology that 
this autumn offers up not one but three deeply creepy sci-fi series. HBO’s
Westworld has already got its stetson on 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/02/westworld-westeros-anthony-hopkins-hbo>
 and is busy chilling people to the bone with its tale of a malfunctioning AI 
theme park, while Charlie Brooker’s angsty anthology seriesBlack Mirror makes 
its move to Netflix later this month

.

If that weren’t enough, powering up for a second series at the end of October 
is Channel 4’s deeply dystopic dramaHumans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/humans>. Series one proved massively 
popular with its depiction of a world where the difference between humankind 
and their ‘synth’ servants is increasingly hard to determine and where the 
robots are getting increasingly aware that their lot in life is not a fair one.

Now series two is upon us and if this exclusive first trailer is anything to 
go by we can expect more unsettling imagery, more pondering over what it means 
to be human and more sci-fi action, as the rift between man and machine 
deepens. The trailer’s final bit of dialogue, from rebel synth Niska sums up 
where we can expect things to go. “This won’t end the way you want it to.”
