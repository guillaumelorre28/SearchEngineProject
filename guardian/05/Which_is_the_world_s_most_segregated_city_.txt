“Reclaim your community,” declared the posters. “Hipsters beware.” Pinned 
around London’s East End last month, they announced Fuck Parade, an 
anti-gentrification demonstration that culminated inan attack on a café selling 
bowls of cereal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/27/shoreditch-cereal-cafe-targeted-by-anti-gentrification-protesters>
. Long the first port of call for cash-strapped new arrivals in the city – 
Irish, Jews, Bangladeshis and many others – the East End was changing, said 
Fuck Parade’s organisers. They explained that they were protesting against 
increasing economic segregation: the construction of “luxury flats that no one 
can afford” instead of “genuinely affordable housing”.


London certainly is a very inequitable city 
<http://www.londonspovertyprofile.org.uk/indicators/topics/inequality/>. The 
richest 10% of its residents own 60% of the city’s assets. The top 10th of 
London earners take home around 4.5 times as much as the bottom 10th.

However, according to new research, and unlike many European cities, between 
2001 and 2011, London did not actually become more economically segregated ... 
largely because the city was so divided to start with.

“In the central parts of London, housing is extremely expensive and 
segregation is already high,” says Maarten van Ham, professor of urban renewal 
at Delft University of Technology and the University of St Andrews. Van Ham 
co-authored thestudy <http://www.segregationeurope.eu/>, which measured a range 
of variables associated with segregation: income, occupational status, 
education and more.

Without inequality, there wouldn’t be any segregation by income

The research found that, in the decade from 2001, segregation increased in 11 
of 13 major European cities (the other exception, along with London, was 
Amsterdam.)

In Scandinavia, for example, the traditional Nordic model seems to be fraying 
at the edges. In Stockholm, social housing is being sold into the private 
sector; even in famously equal Oslo, rich and poor are increasingly living 
parallel lives in different parts of the city.

Across the Baltic Sea, Vilnius and Tallinn have gone from Soviet cities with 
limited private ownership of housing to hyper-capitalist ones in just 25 years.

Throughout Europe, inequality is on the rise. Our cities are looking and 
feeling very different, as middle-class professionals flock to central 
neighbourhoods while immigrants increasingly congregate together, often in 
suburban enclaves. “Without inequality, there wouldn’t be any segregation by 
income,” says Van Ham. “If inequality increases in a city, you expect 
segregation to rise, too.”

The researchers identified four main factors behind the rise in segregation in 
Europe’s cities: globalisation; economic restructuring; the withdrawal of the 
state; and the investment (or lack of) in social housing.

For example, the city where segregation increased the most among the 13 
studied was Madrid – not due to an influx of property speculators, but rather a 
lack of affordable housing, which, for example, forced young people to stay 
living with their parents. In Vienna, the number of professionals has doubled 
in the past decade, squeezing out poorer residents.

In 2005, riots broke out across the Parisian banlieues. The insurrection was, 
in part, a protest against inequality, and yet segregation has increased in the 
years since.

Over the past three decades, it has increased in most US cities 
<http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/08/01/the-rise-of-residential-segregation-by-income/>
, too. The most extreme economic examples areconcentrated in college towns 
<http://www.citylab.com/work/2015/02/americas-most-economically-segregated-cities/385709/>
 – in part because the vertiginous cost of American university education 
attracts only the wealthiest. But it affects larger cities, too: New York, 
Philadelphia and Chicago are segregated along economic lines and are getting 
worse.

North of the border, in Winnipeg, a “great divide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/21/winnipeg-election-indigenous-divide-aboriginal>
” has opened up between the 80,000-strong indigenous population and the rest of 
the city’s residents. Most of Winnipeg’s First Nations community live in the 
inner city and the North End, two of the poorest postcodes in Canada. On a 
whole host of indices, from access to housing to exposure to violent crime, 
aboriginals fare worse.

But for the starkest examples of segregation, we have to look beyond Europe 
and North America.In Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/03/mongolia-ulanbaatar-ger-yurt-tent-city>
, hundreds of thousands of erstwhile nomads live in felt-covered “ger” tents on 
scrubland on the outskirts of the city, while downtown, the nouveau riche shop 
in expensive designer stores. And in Johannesburg, walls – often topped with 
broken glass and surveillance cameras – separate the wealthy from the hoi 
polloi. The South African city, once strictly segregated along racial lines, is 
now divided by income.

Cities, of course, are not just divided by money. Belfast, too, has walls – in 
this case iron “peace walls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/29/belfast-berlin-wall-moment-permanent-peace-walls>
”, some almost 20ft high, built to separate nationalists and unionists. In the 
Indian state of Gujarat, scene of vicious anti-Muslim riots in 2002, many 
Hindus and Muslims live inseparate, sprawling ghettos 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-30204806>. Parts of the Saudi 
Arabian capital, Riyadh, are split along gender lines, with women-only shopping

.


Indices of dissimilarity – which measure the evenness of two groups (such as 
ethnic or occupational) in any given area – can be used to chart segregation. 
According to one study, Detroit is themost racially unequal metropolis in the US
 
<http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/03/24/10-of-the-most-segregated-cities-in-the-u-s/10/>
, with a dissimilarity score of almost 80: a largely black inner city, with 
whites living predominantly in the surrounding suburbs.

Racial segregation may not be inevitable in large multi-ethnic cities. In LA, 
segregation has actually decreased

And yet, racial segregation may not be inevitable in large multi-ethnic 
cities. In Los Angeles, for example, segregation has actually decreased, 
according tonew research 
<http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/10/13/in-los-angeles-an-increase-in-neighborhood-diversity-means-that-segregation-is-on-the-decline/#Author>
. In 2000, 40% of LA’s population lived in strongly segregated neighbourhoods; 
by 2010, it was one-third. The biggest fall has been in the number of 
heterogeneous white areas. “Diversity and heterogeneity is the new structure of 
urban society,” the authors conclude.

In Europe, however, cities are likely to become more divided as the impact of 
the 2008 financial crisis really starts to bite. “The crisis has probably 
caused inequality to rise in Europe,” says Van Ham. “But there is a serious 
time lag – five to 10 years – between rising inequality and when it affects 
cities.”

Compared with other cities around the world, however, Europe’s capitals are 
still relatively mixed. The oil-rich Angolan capital of Luanda has been, in 
some measures,the world’s most expensive city 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/8632811/Luanda-capital-of-Angola-retains-title-of-worlds-most-expensive-for-expats.html>
 for each of the last three years. The super-rich live in gated, high-rise 
apartments; hotel rooms cost upwards of £250 a night for the most rudimentary. 
Poorer residents, meanwhile, struggle to survive in makeshift housing, unable 
to afford the eye-watering prices for basic staples such as milk and tomatoes.
