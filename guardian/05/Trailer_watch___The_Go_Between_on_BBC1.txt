, BBC1’s next Sunday night literary adaptation is a version of LP Hartley’s 
1953 novel The Go-Between.

“The Go-Between follows Leo Colston, who, as an elderly man, pieces together 
his childhood memories after finding his diary from 1900, which he wrote when 
he was 13 years old. A nostalgic tale about lost innocence, The Go-Between 
paints beautiful pictures of British life, humanity and social hierarchy at the 
beginning of the 20th century.”
