European shares end higher

The promise of extra financial stimulus from the Japanese government set a 
positive tone at the start of the day, and that mostly continued into the 
close. Better than expected UK economic growth in the second quarter also 
helped lift the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 - the latter briefly regaining the level 
it was at before the Brexit vote. But European markets slipped back from their 
highs as Wall Street went into reverse after an early rise, with sentiment 
undermined by a sharper than expected rise in crude oil stocks. The final 
scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 26.40 points or 0.39% higher at 6750.43, its best 
level since 5 August 2015 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.7% to 10,319.55 
 * France’s Cac climbed 1.19% to 4446.96 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was 0.99% better at 16,863.01 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.18% at 8661.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 569.16 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 31 points 
or 0.17% ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s Reuters on the rise in US crude oil stocks:

Oil prices tumbled more than 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting a two-month low, 
after the U.S. government reported a surprise build in crude and gasoline 
inventories during the peak summer driving season.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude stockpiles rose 
1.7 million barrels, against analysts’ forecasts for a drawdown of 2.3 million 
barrels.

“A drop in refinery runs at the peak of summer driving season indicate 
refiners are dialing back amid faltering profit margins,” said Matt Smith, 
analyst at New York-based oil cargoes tracker Clipperdata.

Refinery crude runs fell 277,000 barrels per day last week as utilization 
rates fell 0.8 percentage point to 92.4 percent of capacity, EIA data showed.

2.29pm BST 14:29  <> 

Earlier in the US came some evidence of economic weakness, ahead of the 
Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

Orders for durable goods - long lasting items ranging from toasters to 
aircraft - fell 4% month on month in June, the biggest drop since August 2014. 
May’s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall.

Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:

The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on 
month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are 
one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the 
quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter 
of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor.

More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders 
series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence 
and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in 
June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though 
remained negative.

We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter 
of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement 
on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.

We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on 
quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths 
too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct.

This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked 
improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members 
argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking 
rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its 
momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments 
and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening.

FTSE 250 regains all post-Brexit vote losses

The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than 
expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut 
from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn.

The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best 
since 20 July 2015.

Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than 
the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result.

The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it 
reached on the day of the referendum.

Lunchtime summary: Growth beats forecasts, but....

A quick recap.

Fears that Britain’s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have 
eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80#block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80>
.

UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest 
jump in industrial output since 1999.

 That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain’s economy is 7.7% 
larger than before the 2008 crash.


Details:

 * Services: grew by 0.5%

 * Industrial production: grew by 2.1%

 * Manufacturing: grew by 1.8%

 * Construction: shrank by 0.4%
 Where the growth came from: Photograph: ONS 
Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared that the figures show Britain’s 
economic fundamentals are robust 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9#block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9>
, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty. He can also point to plans to 
invest more than £300m in London City Airport.


But many economists have warned that the economy is probably now shrinking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57987f7ae4b02d2223d824fe#block-57987f7ae4b02d2223d824fe>
.It could even fall into recession, if Britain gets a serious bout of Brexit 
blues.

There’s also concern that most of the growth occurred in Apri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57988bd0e4b02d2223d82530#block-57988bd0e4b02d2223d82530>
l, before dropping off in May. The report has little detail on how the economy 
fared in the immediate run-up to the June 23 referendum either.

Worryingly, UK retail sales have tumbled at the fastest rate since January 
2012 this month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57988b55e4b0e0542bbb2543#block-57988b55e4b0e0542bbb2543>
.

And Ireland’s central bank has cut its growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017, due 
to the impact caused by the EU referendum vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-579892bbe4b065cfc0a5bfe5#block-579892bbe4b065cfc0a5bfe5>

But City traders are in upbeat move, sending the FTSE up by 49 points to 6773 
-- a new 11-month high. They’re expecting a fresh bout of stimulus from the 
Bank of Japan soon, followed by a UK interest rate cut next week.

Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> knows full well that 
Britain’s economy is entering turbulent times:

He writes:

The Brexit result was unexpected and has, judging by the surveys since 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey>
, affected the outlook for both the services and manufacturing sectors. 
Construction was the one sector that was already struggling in the buildup to 
the vote and is likely to face an even tougher winter than the rest of the 
economy.

Growth is going to slow down markedly from now on. The length and depth of 
that slowdown will depend on how quickly businesses regain their equilibrium. 
The Bank of England knows that, which is why a big package of measures designed 
to boost confidence will be announced next week.

Bad news: UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest pace in over four years 
in July this month.

The latest survey, from the CBI, bolsters concerns that the economy is 
weakening fast - unravelling the solid growth in the last quarter.

Some 24% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in July compared with a 
year earlier, while 38% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -14%. 
That’s the weakest reading since January 2012.

The CBI says:

Within retail, sales by grocers, and furniture and carpets stores were the 
main drivers of the drop in overall volumes. But some sectors bucked the trend, 
with non-specialised department stores and retailers of footwear and leather 
goods reporting higher volumes.

Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> says it’s worrying news:

First retail survey solely covering the post-ref period and guess what? It's 
collapsed. CBI reported sales bal. at lowest level since Jan 12

Ireland slashes growth forecasts after Brexit vote

Lisa O'Carroll

Ireland’s Central Bank has downgraded its forecasts for GDP growth for 2016 
and 2017 citing the adverse affect of Brexit on the economy.

Britain is Ireland’s biggest export partner while Ireland is Britain’s fifth 
biggest trading partner with €1.5bn in transactions a week.

The Central Bank said it believed the Irish economy, which is one of the 
fastest growing in Europe, would continue to grow but that Brexit was negative 
for the economy.

 * It cut its projections for growth in 2016 by 0.2% to 4.9% GDP growth. 

 * It also slashed 0.6% off its 2017 growth forecasts, down to 3.6%.

It said it expected a prolonged period of uncertainty while the UK was 
negotiating its Brexit package which would damage investor confidence.


In a statement Ireland’s Central Bank chief economist, Gabriel Fagan, said 
while the economy’s reliance on the British export market had weakened over 
recent decades.

However...

“Some sectors, including agri-food, clothing, footwear and tourism continue to 
have a relatively high dependency on exports to the UK and, consequently, could 
be affected disproportionately”.

Tourism is expected to take a particular hit because of the weakened pound. 

Among Ireland’s top 10 exports to Britain are food and drink and packaged 
medicines while the UK’s exports to Britain including gas, cars and 
pharmaceuticals.


Edgar Morganrath, associate research professor at Dublin’s Economic and Social 
Research Institute has said that custom paperwork could add three to four per 
cent on costs for exporters to the UK, in line with additional costs of 
exporting to non-EU territories including US and Canada.


Here’s the full report

Britain’s growth since the crisis is less impressive once you adjust for the 
increase in population:

On a per-capita basis, the economy is only 1.3% bigger than in 2008, not the 
7.7% headline increase report today.

Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation shows how this is much worse 
than in previous recessions:
Matthew Whittaker (@MattWhittakerRF) 
Q2 2016 @ONS <https://twitter.com/ONS> data shows GDP per head 1.3% above Q407 
peak. Much lower than at the same point post-80 & 90 recessions

Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that Britain’s economy 
is entering a period of weak growth, despite the forecast-beating performance 
in the last quarter:

“The pick up in growth in the UK in the second quarter is consistent with 
other data - for employment, retail sales and yesterday’s CBI survey of 
manufacturers.

“However, we also know that the EU Referendum result has sent a shockwave 
through the business world and we should expect much slower growth this quarter 
- the main scenario in our latest PwC Economic Outlook suggests growth slowing 
to around 1.6% this year. 2017 is likely to see even more sluggish growth - our 
central view is for GDP to increase by just 0.6% next year.

Once upon a time, Britain’s chancellor would have celebrated today’s growth 
figures by donning a florescent jacket and building a wall.

But Philip Hammond <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> 
doesn’t shares George Osborne’s love of hard hats; so he’s decamped to London 
City Airport this morning.

He’s there to announce a £344m expansion programme for the airport, meaning 
more space for planes and an enlarged terminal to house extra passengers.

Today’s report shows that “dire predictions” that the economy would grind to a 
halt before the EU referendum were false, saysPeter Rosenstreich of Swissquote 
Bank.

In actuality, growth accelerated as business raced ahead of the uncertain vote 
(lead by industrial output). This unexpected read indicates that the UK economy 
was in stronger position ahead of the vote then originally forecasted.

But Rosenstreich also fears Britain could now fall into recession:

However, this preliminary estimate does not capture the post referendum 
fallout, which is likely to drive Q3 lower, possibly into recession. We remain 
bearish on the British pound as the UK economy will clearly go through a period 
of economic adjustment and likely BoE interest rate cuts.”

The promise of extra financial stimulus from the Japanese government set a 
positive tone at the start of the day, and that mostly continued into the 
close. Better than expected UK economic growth in the second quarter also 
helped lift the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 - the latter briefly regaining the level 
it was at before the Brexit vote. But European markets slipped back from their 
highs as Wall Street went into reverse after an early rise, with sentiment 
undermined by a sharper than expected rise in crude oil stocks. The final 
scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 26.40 points or 0.39% higher at 6750.43, its best 
level since 5 August 2015 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.7% to 10,319.55 
 * France’s Cac climbed 1.19% to 4446.96 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was 0.99% better at 16,863.01 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.18% at 8661.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 569.16 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 31 points 
or 0.17% ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Here’s Reuters on the rise in US crude oil stocks:

Oil prices tumbled more than 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting a two-month low, 
after the U.S. government reported a surprise build in crude and gasoline 
inventories during the peak summer driving season.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude stockpiles rose 
1.7 million barrels, against analysts’ forecasts for a drawdown of 2.3 million 
barrels.

“A drop in refinery runs at the peak of summer driving season indicate 
refiners are dialing back amid faltering profit margins,” said Matt Smith, 
analyst at New York-based oil cargoes tracker Clipperdata.

Refinery crude runs fell 277,000 barrels per day last week as utilization 
rates fell 0.8 percentage point to 92.4 percent of capacity, EIA data showed.
 
Oil prices are under pressure again after new figures showing a surprise 
increase in US crude stocks.

The Energy Information Administration said crude oil stocks rose by 1.67m 
barrels last week to 521.1m, rather than the 2m fall which had been expected.

Earlier in the US came some evidence of economic weakness, ahead of the 
Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

Orders for durable goods - long lasting items ranging from toasters to 
aircraft - fell 4% month on month in June, the biggest drop since August 2014. 
May’s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall.

Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:

The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on 
month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are 
one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the 
quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter 
of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor.

More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders 
series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence 
and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in 
June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though 
remained negative.

We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter 
of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement 
on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.

We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on 
quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths 
too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct.

This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked 
improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members 
argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking 
rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its 
momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments 
and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening.
 
The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than 
expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut 
from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn.

The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best 
since 20 July 2015.

Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than 
the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result.

The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it 
reached on the day of the referendum.
 
A quick recap.

Fears that Britain’s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have 
eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80#block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80>
.

UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest 
jump in industrial output since 1999.

 That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain’s economy is 7.7% 
larger than before the 2008 crash.


Details:

 * Services: grew by 0.5%

 * Industrial production: grew by 2.1%

 * Manufacturing: grew by 1.8%

 * Construction: shrank by 0.4%

economic fundamentals are robust

, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty. He can also point to plans to 
invest more than £300m in London City Airport.


But many economists have warned that the economy is probably now shrinking

.It could even fall into recession, if Britain gets a serious bout of Brexit 
blues.

There’s also concern that most of the growth occurred in Apri

l, before dropping off in May. The report has little detail on how the economy 
fared in the immediate run-up to the June 23 referendum either.

Worryingly, UK retail sales have tumbled at the fastest rate since January 
2012 this month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57988b55e4b0e0542bbb2543#block-57988b55e4b0e0542bbb2543>
.

And Ireland’s central bank has cut its growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017, due 
to the impact caused by the EU referendum vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-579892bbe4b065cfc0a5bfe5#block-579892bbe4b065cfc0a5bfe5>

But City traders are in upbeat move, sending the FTSE up by 49 points to 6773 
-- a new 11-month high. They’re expecting a fresh bout of stimulus from the 
Bank of Japan soon, followed by a UK interest rate cut next week.

The Brexit result was unexpected and has, judging by the surveys since 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey>
, affected the outlook for both the services and manufacturing sectors. 
Construction was the one sector that was already struggling in the buildup to 
the vote and is likely to face an even tougher winter than the rest of the 
economy.

Growth is going to slow down markedly from now on. The length and depth of 
that slowdown will depend on how quickly businesses regain their equilibrium. 
The Bank of England knows that, which is why a big package of measures designed 
to boost confidence will be announced next week.

Bad news: UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest pace in over four years 
in July this month.

The latest survey, from the CBI, bolsters concerns that the economy is 
weakening fast - unravelling the solid growth in the last quarter.

Some 24% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in July compared with a 
year earlier, while 38% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -14%. 
That’s the weakest reading since January 2012.

The CBI says:

Within retail, sales by grocers, and furniture and carpets stores were the 
main drivers of the drop in overall volumes. But some sectors bucked the trend, 
with non-specialised department stores and retailers of footwear and leather 
goods reporting higher volumes.

Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> says it’s worrying news:

collapsed. CBI reported sales bal. at lowest level since Jan 12

Ireland’s Central Bank has downgraded its forecasts for GDP growth for 2016 
and 2017 citing the adverse affect of Brexit on the economy.

Britain is Ireland’s biggest export partner while Ireland is Britain’s fifth 
biggest trading partner with €1.5bn in transactions a week.

The Central Bank said it believed the Irish economy, which is one of the 
fastest growing in Europe, would continue to grow but that Brexit was negative 
for the economy.

 * It cut its projections for growth in 2016 by 0.2% to 4.9% GDP growth. 

 * It also slashed 0.6% off its 2017 growth forecasts, down to 3.6%.

It said it expected a prolonged period of uncertainty while the UK was 
negotiating its Brexit package which would damage investor confidence.


In a statement Ireland’s Central Bank chief economist, Gabriel Fagan, said 
while the economy’s reliance on the British export market had weakened over 
recent decades.

However...

“Some sectors, including agri-food, clothing, footwear and tourism continue to 
have a relatively high dependency on exports to the UK and, consequently, could 
be affected disproportionately”.

Tourism is expected to take a particular hit because of the weakened pound. 

Among Ireland’s top 10 exports to Britain are food and drink and packaged 
medicines while the UK’s exports to Britain including gas, cars and 
pharmaceuticals.


Edgar Morganrath, associate research professor at Dublin’s Economic and Social 
Research Institute has said that custom paperwork could add three to four per 
cent on costs for exporters to the UK, in line with additional costs of 
exporting to non-EU territories including US and Canada.


Here’s the full report 
<http://www.centralbank.ie/publications/Pages/QB32016.aspx>
 
Britain’s growth since the crisis is less impressive once you adjust for the 
increase in population:

On a per-capita basis, the economy is only 1.3% bigger than in 2008, not the 
7.7% headline increase report today.

Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation shows how this is much worse 
than in previous recessions:

Andy Bruce of Reuters has highlighted how April provided the bulk of the 
growth in the last quarter:

If you’re just tuning in, here’s our news story on today’s growth figures:

UK economy grew by 0.6% before Brexit vote

Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that Britain’s economy 
is entering a period of weak growth, despite the forecast-beating performance 
in the last quarter:

“The pick up in growth in the UK in the second quarter is consistent with 
other data - for employment, retail sales and yesterday’s CBI survey of 
manufacturers.

“However, we also know that the EU Referendum result has sent a shockwave 
through the business world and we should expect much slower growth this quarter 
- the main scenario in our latest PwC Economic Outlook suggests growth slowing 
to around 1.6% this year. 2017 is likely to see even more sluggish growth - our 
central view is for GDP to increase by just 0.6% next year.
 
Once upon a time, Britain’s chancellor would have celebrated today’s growth 
figures by donning a florescent jacket and building a wall.

But Philip Hammond <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond> 
doesn’t shares George Osborne’s love of hard hats; so he’s decamped to London 
City Airport this morning.

Aviation Lord Ahmad (left) and Declan Collier CEO of London City Airport

He’s there to announce a £344m expansion programme for the airport, meaning 
more space for planes and an enlarged terminal to house extra passengers.
 
Today’s report shows that “dire predictions” that the economy would grind to a 
halt before the EU referendum were false, saysPeter Rosenstreich of Swissquote 
Bank.

In actuality, growth accelerated as business raced ahead of the uncertain vote 
(lead by industrial output). This unexpected read indicates that the UK economy 
was in stronger position ahead of the vote then originally forecasted.

But Rosenstreich also fears Britain could now fall into recession:

However, this preliminary estimate does not capture the post referendum 
fallout, which is likely to drive Q3 lower, possibly into recession. We remain 
bearish on the British pound as the UK economy will clearly go through a period 
of economic adjustment and likely BoE interest rate cuts.”
 
One decent quarter doesn’t mean Britain’s industrial sector has roared back,
