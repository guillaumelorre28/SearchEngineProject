The US Olympic swimmer Jimmy Feigen will pay $11,000 (£8,300) to a Brazilian 
charity to settle a dispute over what police called a fabricated story about 
him and his team-mates being robbed at gunpoint during the Rio Olympics.

The donation was announced by Feigen’s lawyer, Breno Melaragno Costa, after a 
four-hour meeting between the swimmer, a judge and officials from the 
prosecuting ministry in Rio,ABC News reported

.

Feigen and his team-mate Ryan Lochte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ryan-lochte> have been accused of lying 
about being stopped by gunmen posing as police in the early hours of Sunday 
while they were with two other US swimmers, Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger.

The US Olympic Committee 
<http://www.teamusa.org/Media/News/USOC/081816-Statement> apologised for the 
actions of the swimmers, all of whom have returned to the US except for Feigen.

Brazilian authorities have accused Feigen and Lochte of making up a story 
about a robbery in an attempt to cover up an act of vandalism.

After the donation is paid to the Brazilian charity, Reaction Institute, 
Feigen is expected to have his passport returned and will then be free to leave 
the country, said his lawyer.

The announcement follows a whirlwind day on Thursday in which Brazilian police 
presented strong evidence

CCTV footage casts doubt over Ryan Lochte’s account of Rio robbery

Bentz and Conger were pulled off a flight home the previous night as local 
authorities tried to unravel what actually happened, but a USOC statement 
released the next day appeared to agree with Rio police’s assertions that 
Lochte’s version of events were false.

“As we understand it, the four athletes (Bentz, Conger, Feigen and Ryan 
Lochte) left France House early in the morning of 14 August in a taxi headed to 
the Olympic village,” the USOC statement said.

“They stopped at a gas station to use the restroom, where one of the athletes 
committed an act of vandalism. An argument ensued between the athletes and two 
armed gas station security staff, who displayed their weapons, ordered the 
athletes from their vehicle and demanded the athletes provide a monetary 
payment. Once the security officials received money from the athletes, the 
athletes were allowed to leave.”

Police and the station’s owner said the Americans damaged an advertising sign, 
and that two women were with the men but stayed in a taxi that was parked 
behind their cab.

 What really happened to Ryan Lochte and friends on 14 August?We look back at 
the shifting narrative 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-video-robbery-what-happened-rio-olympics>
The USOC statement went on to apologise for the events: “The behaviour of 
these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA 
or the conduct of the vast majority of its members. We will further review the 
matter, and any potential consequences for the athletes, when we return to the 
United States.

“On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologise to our hosts 
in Rio and the people ofBrazil <https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil> for 
this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of 
excellence,” the statement concluded.

Police said earlier on Thursday that Bentz and Conger blamed Lochte for the 
original story, saying he was drunk and agitated. Police added that neither 
Bentz nor Conger had given a misleading statement after the Sunday incident, 
saying only Lochte and Feigen had done so. The USOC said Feigen has spoken to 
police and provided them with a revised statement.

Meanwhile, Lochte’s attorney, Jeff Ostrow, has insisted the story was not made 
up and told the New York Times the surveillance video corroborated the “primary 
elements” of Lochte’s version of events.

“There was a uniformed person with a gun who forced them to hand over their 
money,” Ostrow told the newspaper.

Bentz and Conger arrived in Miami from Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil> on Friday morning after being moved 
to business class and covering themselves to avoid media during an overnight 
flight, according to a Reuters witness.
