What to buy from Gap ... Lauren Cochrane

The nephew A roaring glow that glows in the dark? This T-shirt 
<http://www.gap.co.uk/browse/product.do?cid=1047039&vid=1&pid=000695030000> 
goes beyond a conversation-starter to something that is almost an actual toy. 
It will also make you seem like the best uncle or aunt ever – even if you run 
the risk of finding dark corners all Christmas Day to see that bear glow.

The teenage girl A beanie 
<http://www.gap.co.uk/browse/product.do?cid=1043110&vid=1&pid=000519730002> is 
understated and everyday, which means you get brownie points from teenagers who 
hate anything too try-hard. Add the proper luxury cashmere and there’s the 
implication that you consider her a grownup. Tick and tick.

The mother-in-law The key here is something that plays it safe while staying 
on the right side of chic. ABreton 
<http://www.gap.co.uk/browse/product.do?cid=1048542&vid=1&pid=000534439009> 
does all of that – it has that gold standard Coco Chanel association and 
features on the cover of British Vogue this month, too.

The unexpected guest Useful but also a bit meta – socks 
<http://www.gap.co.uk/browse/product.do?cid=1006201&vid=1&pid=000225102002> for 
Christmas? What a cliche! These are kind of like the next step up from a 
cracker present. And, as such, exactly right for someone you weren’t expecting 
an hour before.

The uncle In our experience, uncles like anything practical – the kind of 
thing that would sustain them and look smart for a long walk on a winter’s day. 
Thesegloves 
<http://www.gap.co.uk/browse/product.do?cid=60093&vid=1&pid=000721495002> fit 
the bill for both specifications and the moss green colour is just unusual 
enough in a wardrobe – we’d wager – of navy blue and charcoal grey.

What to buy from John Lewis ... Imogen Fox

The nephew Slippers 
<http://www.johnlewis.com/store/john-lewis-sean-dog-slippers-brown-cream/p2099655?navAction=jump>
 are key to the very DNA of the Christmas wardrobe. And these ones come with a 
blue tick of verification from the fashion desk.

The teenage girl Tough crowd, this one. But a bag is always useful for weekend 
cinema visit/sleepover/carrying their mum’s hand-me-down smartphone.This one  
<http://www.johnlewis.com/the-cambridge-satchel-company-mini-push-lock-satchel-bag/p2127513?colour=Pink>
is a bit of a classic. And it’s already on sale. Get in.

The mother-in-law Nothing says I have just the appropriate combination of 
fear/respect/fondness for you thancashmere 
<http://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-made-in-italy-cashmere-long-gloves/p1277406?colour=Light%20Blue>
. It’s the quality, but balance out the seriousness of cashmere with a softer 
colour that says: “I’m terrified of you but I’m sure you have a softer side 
too.”

The unexpected guest Looks posher than it is. Says: “We both know this is a 
thought-freeback-up gift 
<http://www.johnlewis.com/skandinavisk-skog-scented-candle/p2004080>, but it’s 
got all the right interior magazine overtones.”

What to buy from M&S ... Morwenna Ferrier

The teenage girl This might look like a fat-shaming, exercise-shaming, 
pigeonholing gift but that’s where you’re wrong. They can use it foryoga 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/yoga-exercise-mat/p/p22368033>, but they can 
also use it for Glastonbury, on the beach or when they’re having a sleepover.

The mother-in-law Little-known fact – every mother-in-law wants to look like 
Twiggy. Not only that but they like the idea of being on-trend. A poloneck, like
this <http://www.marksandspencer.com/cable-knit-funnel-neck-jumper/p/p22413396>
, is a good start, being one of the year’s biggest looks.

The uncle Little-known fact – every uncle wants to look like David Gandy. M&S 
knows this, which is why it has produced a line of quite nice stuff so you can 
participate in ‘Gandy cosplay’. Thesepyjama bottoms 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/supima-cotton-pyjama-bottoms/p/p22333697?intid=CP_DG%20Swim__LP_lego_3_img>
 are also quite nice for sleeping in.

The unexepected guest What to give the unexpected guest? An ice-breaker, such 
as this “cheese baker <http://www.marksandspencer.com/cheese-baker/p/p22414773>
”. Presumably something for baking cheese in, its success lies in its 
niche-ness. It also looks nice, is ceramic, dishwasher and microwave safe. 
Plenty to talk about.

What to buy from Debenhams ... Melanie Wilkinson

The nephew As a general rule, most kids hate wearing hats, but this checked 
trapper style 
<http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Navigate?langId=-1&storeId=10701&catalogId=10001&txt=trapper+hat>
 (which I kind of wish came in adult size) might just persuade him to keep one 
on.

The teenage girl She’ll think this bag 
<http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/prod_10701_10001_089010438145_-1>
 is quirky and cool, and you’re safe in the knowledge that she has enough room 
for all life’s necessities … tissues, a waterproof jacket etc.
