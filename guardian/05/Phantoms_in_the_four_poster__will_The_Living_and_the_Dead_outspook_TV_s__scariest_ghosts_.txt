At a time when news bulletins feel supernaturally strange, period dramas are 
expected to bring escapist pleasures to the schedules. But, although set in 
1894,The Living and the Dead <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03wv2rl>, 
starting in the slot before whatever frights are revealed in tonight’s 10pm BBC 
News, won’t provide much relief to viewers feeling haunted. The six-parter 
revives one of TV’s least-seen genres: the ghost story.


Writer Ashley Pharoah has raised spectres before. In Life on Mars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/apr/11/lifeonmarstheperfectfinal>
 andAshes to Ashes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/may/21/ashes-to-ashes-final-episode>
 (co-written with Matthew Graham), the cast was filled with the living dead, 
although this did not become clear for several series. While those shows 
brought ghost stories into the contemporary world, The Living and the Dead is 
in the tradition of classic English Victorian chillers, although taking 
advantage of knowing what came next historically.

Nathan Appleby is a psychologist who has been doing in London the sort of 
stuff that Dr Freud is pioneering in Vienna: diagnosing suppressed sexual 
desires beneath crinolines. When Nathan is called back to the family estate for 
the death of his mother, he decides to stay there and take over the large house 
and farm, even though the fields hold the fly-buzz of memories of his first 
wife and their young son, buried in the village churchyard.

Whether subconsciously or consciously, Nathan (Colin Morgan) has married a 
proto-feminist photographer, who lures him to the fourposter to shoot some 
experimental erotica. Sex and death are everywhere: if it’s not two bodies very 
much alive against a tree, it’s one body very dead on the soil.

The local vicar’s daughter is possibly possessed by demons and the farmhands 
are frightened by new machinery with a long pumping shaft, which Nathan, 
despite being a Freudian, correctly understands to represent the coming of the 
20th century, rather than anything else. Another set of ominous oblongs – 
recording cylinders – carry the voices of the dead, or possibly undead.

Tingling the spine while engaging the brain, The Living and the Dead is smart, 
scary and knowing. The scene in which the yokels light flaming torches to enact 
an annual ritual suggests both that they have seenThe Wicker Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/29/wicker-man-final-cut-review> and 
that they should be watched closely in future episodes.

Director Alice Troughton stylishly combines images obligatory to the form – 
flickering candle and gas light, wind-whipped wheat, faint faces behind glass 
or underwater – with others that surprise through their mystery or beauty. The 
strategy seems to be to offer enough frocks and maids for fans of period 
fiction with sufficient shocks for enthusiasts of the supernatural: a sort of 
Pride and Poltergeist or Downton Spooky.

Pharoah’s decision to locate the drama in 1894, though, feels like a 
deliberate homage to the writerMR James 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/01/collected-ghost-stories-mr-james-review>
, the grandfather of the English literary chiller, for whom the late-Victorian 
era was a key period of creativity and settings for stories. James adaptations 
dominate spooky television to such an extent that one of his tales,The Tractate 
Middoth <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1HCkAQj-WE> (which, like The Living 
and the Dead, prominently involves a clergyman), is both one of the earliest TV 
ghost stories – filmed for American TV in 1951, starring Leslie Nielsen – and 
one of the most recent: it was adapted and directed by Mark Gatiss for 
Christmas 2013 on BBC2.

Gatiss is an evangelist for the work of James and also for the screenwriter 
Nigel Kneale, whose clever and terrifying 1972 BBC playThe Stone Tape 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV5kqdOHIoo>, in which scientists working in a 
Victorian building are surprised by what their instruments pick up, was a 
latter-day homage to James.

Another James story, Oh, Whistle and I’ll Come To You, My Lad!, has appeared 
on British TV screens in three versions. The yarn, in which a holidaying don 
finds in a cemetery a whistle that can summon phantasms, was filmed asWhistle 
and I’ll Come To You <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYjtxHHjZ00> by Jonathan 
Miller in 1968 for the BBC. Though there were further versions in 1986 and2010 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2v10UPngVI&list=PLRiywIdis46h0YeX-z0aypOPiEayNACMj>
, Miller’s black-and-white dramatisation is the most enduring, establishing 
tropes – including an overgrown graveyard and menacingly unwelcoming country 
types – that have recurred in the genre, either as cliche or homage, up to and 
including The Living and the Dead.

Almost all the James adaptations have been shown at Christmas or Halloween, 
and these seasonal associations of the genre – The Living and the Dead might 
have been even better in winter than it is in summer – is one reason that 
haunted stories have been relatively infrequent on TV. The other is that, as 
you can only have so much ectoplasm close to the watershed, their content tends 
to limit them to late-night transmission.

The superstition that such tales were risky viewing was confirmed by BBC1’s 
experience withGhostwatch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfy9UHAIwgQ>, a 1992 
drama written by Stephen Volk. Although it was filmed, scripted fiction, the 
show posed as a live transmission from a possibly haunted house, with factual 
or entertainment presenters, including Michael Parkinson, appearing as 
themselves. The programme was implicated in worrying psychological effects on 
younger viewers (including the suicide of a vulnerable person), and the 
subsequent warnings from regulators left commissioners frightened of ghost 
stories.

As a result, ghosts and other apparitions have tended to be a presence within 
other formats. Toby Whithouse’s brilliant Being Human is a paranormal 
house-share drama, The Simpsons have made Halloween their own with the regular
Treehouse of Horror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/12/the-simpsons-halloween-episode-tracey-ullman-show>
 episodes, and Doctor Who, with the Jamesian Mark Gatiss among its creative 
team, has channelled MR James in phantasmal Victorian episodes.

But in The Living and the Dead, the openly declared TV ghost story is 
promisingly reborn at the witching hour of 9pm peak-time.

• The Living and the Dead <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03wv2rl> is on 
BBC1 at 9pm tonight.
