The Get Down (available 12 August)
Baz Luhrmann’s much-hyped and very possibly troubled disco-meets-rap show set 
in the broke-down Bronx of 1977 – a world of wildstyle graffiti, turntables and 
burning buildings. It centres around Zeke, a secret poet, and his unrequited 
love Mylene, a pastor’s daughter who’s desperate to be the next Donna Summer. 
The disco scenes are so high-tempo and hectic they’re almost hectoring, so it’s 
only in the Get Down – Grandmaster Flash’s secret hip-hop club – that the show 
really finds its feet … as does Zeke, who promptly becomes New York’s best new 
MC. He gains entry to this exclusive world thanks to Shaolin Fantastic, a 
notorious graffer-cum-dealer-cum-breakdancer whose red Puma trainers are the 
stuff of legend, whose motto seems to be “why walk when you could kung-fu kick” 
– and who has a sideline in pigeon-fancying. Only Baz Luhrmann …

Beat Bugs (available 3 August)
Five cartoon insects will introduce babies to the Fab Four in this new musical 
animation, with Beatles covers done by everyone from Sia to P!nk, James Corden 
and Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder. Perfect summer holiday fodder.

Wolf Hall (available 25 August)
If you missed out on last year’s Tudormania, catch up on the multi-Bafta 
winning Hilary Mantel adaptation starring the remarkable Mark Rylance as Thomas 
Cromwell.

 White-knuckle thriller … Sicario. Photograph: Allstar/LIONSGATE 
White-knuckle thriller about the war on drugs starring Emily Blunt as a young 
FBI agent who tackles the cartels.

Child’s Play (available now)
The black magic slasher movie that introduced Chucky to the world. 

Oranges and Sunshine (available 3 August)
Excellent, sombre drama directed by Jim Loach, son of Ken, about the postwar 
scandal of deporting children in care to Australia.

Project Nim (available 3 August)
A great, gripping documentary by James Marsh – who also made Man on Wire – 
about Professor Herb Terrace’s radical social experiment in the 70s: raising a 
chimp in a human family. The humans do not come out well.

Brooklyn (available 8 August)
Saoirse Ronan is terrific in Nick Hornby’s sensitive adaptation of Colm 
Tóibin’s sentimental novel.

Creed (available 8 August)
Sly Stallone’s Rocky Balboa becomes a trainer to a rising star of the boxing 
world, played by Michael B Jordan. It should be bad, but it’s actually a real, 
er, punchy number.

The Way We Were (available 17 August)
Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand weepie of “Your girl is lovely, Hubbel” 
fame, set against the backdrop of the Hollywood blacklist.
