Readers have so far raised nearly £200,000 for the Observer's Christmas 
appeal, guaranteeing a substantial financial boost for four charities working 
on innovative social projects inAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>.

With a week to go until the appeal closes, the total donated stands at 
£182,000 which will be divided betweenFarm Africa <http://www.farmafrica.org/>, 
Practical Action <http://practicalaction.org/>, Solar Aid 
<http://www.solar-aid.org/> and Worldreader <http://www.worldreader.org/>. More 
than £26,000 was raised in one day during theGuardian and Observer charity 
telethon just before Christmas.

All donations going to Solar Aid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/aid> or the Katine project run 
by Farm Africa to support a rural development project in Ethiopia will be match 
funded by the British government.

With a hoped-for final surge of donations by readers – supplemented with a 
Gift Aid top-up currently estimated at £30,000 – the final total could rise 
substantially. Nigel Harris, chief executive of Farm Africa, said: "We are 
extremely grateful to all the readers who have made such a generous 
contribution to help families across Africa lift themselves out of hunger and 
poverty and build a more secure future for them and their children.

"We would also like to thank the UK government for doubling readers' donations 
to Farm Africa's work so we can help even more people become economically 
self-reliant."
