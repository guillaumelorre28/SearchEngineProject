George Osborne’s pledge to offer cut-price Lloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> shares to the 
public next year appears to have attracted a new range of investors.

According to research by financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, one in eight of 
the 170,000 people who have registered for its email updates are first-time 
investors, while one in five had been involved in other flotations or 
privatisations in the 1980s and 90s,Hargreaves Lansdown

The firm’s senior analyst, Laith Khalaf, said investors were keen to buy 
shares to put in savings products such as ISAs but it was not yet clear if this 
would be possible.

The chancellor said earlier this month that around £2bn Lloyds shares

 –half the amount first signalled by David Cameron in April 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/19/conservatives-pledge-to-sell-public-discounted-shares-in-bailed-out-bank>
 – are to be sold directly to retail investors in a move expected to complete 
the return of Lloyds to the private sector. The bank was bailed out with £20bn 
of taxpayer funds in 2008 and 2009. 

“The public response to the Lloyds share offer is a welcome tonic to the 
rising level of unsecured borrowing, which is now at a five-year high,” said 
Khalaf.

The government has set up its own website 
<https://www.gov.uk/lloydsshares/location> to allow investors to register an 
interest. Within one week250,000 people had signed up
