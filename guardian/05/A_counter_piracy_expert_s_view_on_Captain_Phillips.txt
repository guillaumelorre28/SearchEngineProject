I've met a few Somali pirates: we arrested 35 when I was working in the Gulf 
of Aden <http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/5650/Gulf-of-Aden> from 2011 
to 2012. As a captain in the Royal Navy, I was in charge of an anti-piracy task 
group – and I saw the same excitability and lack of rationality that we see in 
the characters inthis film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/17/captain-phillips-review>. They're 
often caught between a rock and a hard place: just like in the movie, their 
bosses may well have told them not to bother coming back alive unless it's with 
a valuable ransom. There's a lot of machismo about the way they behave, a lot 
of peer pressure.

I remember the incident this film is based on: the hijacking of the Maersk 
Alabama <http://www.youtube.com/channel/HCbmmS4YPK_70>, an American cargo ship, 
in 2009. The US Navy took charge of freeing the hostages, but we were all 
watching closely. The director, Paul Greengrass, has no doubt taken a degree of 
artistic licence with the story, but it feels like a fair representation. I 
think it should be required viewing for anyone involved in combattingSomali 
piracy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/16/somali-pirates-kenya-jail-indian-ocean>
.

Apparently, it was filmed at sea, using real ships: we get a brilliant sense 
of what it was actually like for the crew to be so far away from land in such a 
situation. However, it's much more difficult for pirates to board a ship 
nowadays: the Alabama had no security team, which would be unusual today.

I now work for a maritime security firm, and our guards usually don't have to 
use their weapons: just being there is enough to keep the Somalis off. Unlike 
the Alabama, most ships now have "citadels", too: fortified areas in the ship's 
engine room. I orchestrated the rescue of theMV Montecristo 
<http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_79242.htm>, an Italian ship, from 
Somali pirates: the crew all managed to get inside the citadel before the 
pirates boarded.

The film is very timely: there is often a spike in piracy at this time of 
year, when the Indian Ocean is calm. We saw Somalis attempt to take a ship just 
a few days ago. The film is an important reminder that the issue of Somali 
piracy has been suppressed rather than eradicated. If ships start to drop their 
guard, the pirates will be back.
