Rodney on Rosie


What were you hoping for?
Blinding white light, choral songs, the wind blowing through her hair, Disney 
birds flying around.

First impressions?
A pleasant surprise. And she has a very warm smile.

What did you talk about?
Baking, travel, work and Pokémon gyms.

Any awkward moments?
I should have ordered a medium steak, as I was chewing for a long time. I hate 
fighting with food.

Good table manners?
She was a lady. Although I wasn’t really looking – I was too busy with my 
steak.

Best thing about Rosie?
She is very positive in what she says and does.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
They’re quite a young crowd.

Describe her in three words.
Positive, quirky, talkative.

What do you think she made of you?
A kind, considerate, awfully nice chap.

Did you go on somewhere?
She went to her home and I went to mine. So, nope!

And… did you kiss?
I went for the cheek and Rosie went for the lips, but it was nice.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
It was the best date ever. But it was my first date ever.

Marks out of 10?
Seven.

Would you meet again?
Why not? Rosie would be an interesting person to hang around with now and 
again.
