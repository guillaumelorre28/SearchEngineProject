A government scheme offering homebuyers in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> interest-free loans of up to £240,000 
has gone live, but critics say it will open “relatively few doors” for 
priced-out households.

Help to buy London is an extension of an existing scheme which offers loans 
for buyers of new-build properties, allowing them to purchase a home with a 
deposit of just 5%.

While outside the capital buyers can borrow up to 20% of a property’s cost, in 
London that has been doubled to 40%.

The extension, which was announced in the chancellor’s autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-unveils-his-bold-plan-to-tackle-housing-crisis>
, will be available to buyers of new properties in Greater London costing up to 
£600,000. As under the existing scheme, borrowers will need to qualify for a 
normal mortgage.

They will also have to show they can afford interest payments on the 
government loan when the five-year interest-free period ends.

The extension follows another year of rising house prices in London, with Land 
Registry figures showing a12.4% increase in 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/29/house-prices-rental-costs-continue-rise-ons-land-registry>
, which took the average cost of an existing home to £514,097.

The housing minister, Brandon Lewis, said: “Help to buy has now helped over 
130,000 people across the country achieve their aspiration of buying a new or 
bigger home.

“The scheme is helping people turn those dreams into a reality with a fraction 
of a deposit they would normally require, and from today the new London scheme 
will help even more people follow in their footsteps.”

However, Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, said 
the scheme was not as generous as it first looked.

A family with a £40,000 income could buy a property costing £240,000 with the 
scheme outside London and £327,250 in the capital, but in most London boroughs 
the average price of a property is much higher.

To achieve the £525,000 which would be needed for a comparable property, 
Stansfield said, the London household would need an income of £64,000 and a 
larger deposit.

“In terms of its direct impact on a buyer’s monthly outlays, Help to buy 
London appears to be a significantly more generous subsidy than the original 
equity loan scheme it supplements,” he said. “But in other important ways it is 
notably less generous. On balance, compared to the original scheme, we believe 
Help to buy London will open relatively few doors.”

Funding for the scheme comes from the £8.6bn budget set aside to extend the 
help-to-buy equity loan scheme from April 2016, when it was originally due to 
end, to March 2021.

By the end of September 2015 3,548 households had used an equity loan to buy 
properties in the capital, and the government has said more than 10,000 more 
could benefit from the new scheme.

Ten lenders, including Halifax, Lloyds and Nationwide building society, are 
offering mortgages under the scheme, and rates are low. At Nationwide buyers 
can take out a two-year loan tracking the base rate with a starting cost of 
1.64%, while a five-year fixed-rate mortgage is available at 2.64%.

Although the interest starts at 1.75%, lenders are checking that repayments 
can be met at up to 4%, meaning that someone borrowing the maximum £240,000 
would have to show they could afford to pay £800 a month on top of their 
mortgage and other outgoings.
