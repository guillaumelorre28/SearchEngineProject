Two British men linked to the Brussels bombing suspect Mohamed Abrini are due 
to be sentenced on Monday for terror offences.

During a secret rendezvous in a Birmingham park, Zakaria Boufassil and 
Mohammed Ali Ahmed supplied £3,000 to Abrini – dubbed “the man in the hat” 
after he was caught on CCTV at Brussels airport just before the bombing in 
March this year.

A jury of six men and six women at Kingston crown court in south-west London 
last weekfound Boufassil, 26, from Birmingham

, guilty of engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism.

Ahmed admitted the offence the previous month, while the Crown Prosecution 
Service offered no evidence against Boufassil’s sister, Soumaya.

Boufassil, 26, admitted during the trial that he met Abrini in the park, but 
denied it had anything to do with terrorism and its funding. He also denied 
sharing the intention of Ahmed, who he insisted took advantage of his naivety 
and never communicated his plans.

During the trial, the court heard that money was taken from an account held by 
Anouar Haddouchi, an associate of Ahmed who previously lived in Birmingham and 
had travelled to Syria to fight for Islamic State, into which overpayments of 
housing benefits totalling £5,413 had been paid between 21 December 2014 and 1 
November 2015.

Ahmed used a replacement debit card for the account to make 17 withdrawals 
between 30 May and 30 June 2015 – £3,000 of the cash was later handed to Abrini 
in Small Heath Park in Birmingham.

Abrini, 31, was arrested in Belgium on 22 March and accused of participating 
in terrorist acts related to his role in the Brussels suicide bombings.

The Belgian Moroccan is also wanted by French authorities for the 13 November 
2015 attacks in Paris in which 130 people were killed.
