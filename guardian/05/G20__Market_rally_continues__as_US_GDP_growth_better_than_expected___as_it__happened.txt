Another indicator that a US rate rise could come sooner than expected comes 
with a bigger than expected rise in consumer spending.

The Commerce Department said consumer spending climbed by 0.5% in February, 
compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Meanwhile there was also a 0.5% 
rise in income, the largest increase since June.

And the final release of the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey 
rose to 91.7, up from 90.7.

But Rob Carnell at ING Bank said it was still difficult to judge the current 
state of the US economy:

As we head into payrolls week next week, there is still a distinct lack of 
clarity about where the US economy is headed. And given the nature of the 
non-farm payrolls jobs release, we may not be much the wiser by next Friday, 
and in consequence, there is likely to still be considerable uncertainty about 
the direction the Fed will be taking. Markets dislike uncertainty.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back again on Monday.

After a brief revival, the pound is slipping back to seven year lows against 
the dollar, on a combination of the better than expected US GDP figures and 
continuing uncertainty over the UK referendum on whether to leave the European 
Union.

Sterling is now down at $1.3925, heading back towards the seven year low of 
$1.3878 it reached on Wednesday.

Hopes of co-ordinated global policy measures from the G20 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20> finance ministers meeting in Shanghai 
seem to be fading. Reuters reports:

China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> sought to restore confidence 
in its economy as financial leaders from G20 nations gathered in Shanghai on 
Friday, and Premier Li Keqiang urged greater global coordination and 
consideration of policy spillovers.

But Germany appeared to all but rule out coordinated stimulus to counter a 
deepening global chill, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said there was no 
need for a crisis response, as in 2009 when the Group of 20 (G20) major 
economies agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression.

While the health of the world’s second-largest economy, which hosts the G20 
presidency this year, is a key talking point around the two-day summit, the 
threat of the UK leaving the European Union and its political and economic 
implications have also surfaced as concerns among participants in the meeting.

“Macroeconomic policy coordination needs to be strengthened. The global 
economic and financial situation may have become more grim and complex. It is 
time for countries to stand together to tide over difficulties,” Li said in a 
video message at the opening of the meeting.

Several other policymakers have urged better coordination, but there was 
disagreement about what steps to take, making it unlikely that concrete action 
points will emerge from the meeting.

“Talking about further stimulus just distracts from the real tasks at hand,” 
Germany’s Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble said, rebuffing a 
recommendation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the G20 should 
start planning now for a coordinated stimulus programme.

“We, therefore, do not agree on a G20 fiscal stimulus package as some argue, 
in case outlook risks materialise.”
 Schäuble at the G20 Photograph: Pool/Getty Images 
Lew had a similar message, saying there was a great deal of economic 
uncertainty at present but no crisis.

“It would not be reasonable to expect a crisis response in an environment that 
is not a crisis,” he said told reporters.

Overhanging the summit of major economy finance ministers and central bankers 
are global concerns about China’s ability to manage its domestic markets, 
currency and commitment to wider restructuring reforms. Concerns about its 
slowing economy and confusion over its currency policy were among the factors 
which sowed turmoil in global markets in January.

The case for further policy stimulus amid rising debt levels and already 
extremely low interest rates was a hard sell among some other G20 members.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned cutting rates below zero carried 
serious risks, and blamed the recent global slump in shares and other assets on 
the failure of governments to make bold economics reforms.

Schaeuble said the debt-financed growth model had “reached its limits (and) is 
even causing new problems, raising debt, causing bubbles and excessive risk 
taking, zombifying the economy.”

And Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso shrugged off calls from some quarters 
for Tokyo to roll out fresh fiscal stimulus. Japan’s central bank stunned 
investors by adopting negative interest rates last month.

Dennis de Jong, managing directorat UFX.com, said:

A dreary Dow Jones is likely to be perked up by today’s better than expected 
US GDP figures, with annualised growth jumping up to the 1% mark.

Financial markets were expecting a slowdown in the world’s largest economy, so 
much so that conversations about a recession weren’t far away.

Yet, with unemployment remaining low and wages increasing at their fastest 
rate since 2009, growth is back on the agenda. Add to that cheap fuel prices 
and low mortgage rates, and it may only be a matter of time until disposable 
incomes are fully realised and growth continues to speed up.

The better than expected US GDP figures should at least calm fears the country 
is heading into a recession.

US GDP growth revised upwards

The US economy saw a slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter, but not as much 
as first thought.

In its second revision, the Commerce Department said GDP grew at an annual 
rate of 1%, compared to the initial forecast of 0.7%. Analysts had been 
expecting the figure to be revised down to 0.4%.

But this is still a slowdown on the 2% growth reported in the previous three 
months.

The revision came as businesses seemed less aggressive in their efforts to 
reduce inventory.

German inflation rate goes negative

More signs of weak inflation across the eurozone.

German’s harmonised consumer price index is up 0.4% month on month, but down 
0.2% year on year, compared to expectations of a flat figure. This is the 
lowest annual level since January 2015.

More for the ECB to think about, with German inflation set to go into negative 
territory.Reuters reports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-economy-inflation-idUSKCN0VZ1DK>:

German inflation turned negative in February for the first time in five 
months, preliminary state data indicated on Friday, giving proponents of 
further monetary policy easing more ammunition for a European Central Bank 
meeting next month.

Consumer prices fell below zero on the year in five German states, the data 
showed. In the most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation 
slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent in January.

The state readings will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1300 GMT 
(08:00 a.m. EST).

Capital Economics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> analyst 
Jessica Hinds said the state data suggested that pan-German EU-harmonized 
consumer price inflation (HICP) dropped to -0.1 percent from +0.4 percent in 
January.

The market rally is continuing, helped by renewed strength in the oil prices.

Brent crude is up 2% at $36.03 a barrel on hopes that a meeting between Saudia 
Arabia, Russia and Venezuela could tackle the low oil price. Analyst Connor 
Campbell at Spreadex said:

The global indices continued to strive for recent highs this Friday, their 
growth sustained by a $36 per barrel crossing surge from Brent Crude. However, 
if expectations of a miserly US fourth quarter GDP figure this afternoon are 
accurate the US open may end up slightly spoiling the end of week party.

Currently, at least, the Dow Jones is joining in with its galloping European 
peers, the futures promising a 110 point rise when the bell rings on Wall 
Street, something that would leave the index at its highest point since the 
first week of January. Yet the spectre of this afternoon’s latest fourth 
quarter GDP reading may temper investors’ enthusiasm, analysts forecasting a 
downward revision from an already awful annualised 0.7% to 0.4%.

 European confidence and inflation figures make a strong case for further 
stimulus measures from the European Central Bank at its March meeting, says 
Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight:

Certainly, the marked drop in overall business and consumer confidence across 
theEurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> to an 8-month low 
heightens concern about faltering growth.

However, price developments in the survey did offer a little bit of good news 
for the ECB. The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers’ 
inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they 
were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose 
slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened 
among manufacturers

In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in 
February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by 
early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to 
deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food 
prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February 
(the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw 
consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January.

There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation 
in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 
0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity 
prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round 
effects on wages and price setting.

We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to 
-0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly 
purchase of assets (perhaps by €20bn-€30bn from the current level of €60bn. 
There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its 
deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks’ profitability from another 
cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks’ deposits with the 
ECB above a certain level

Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands 
in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says:

Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber 
mood about theEurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> economy 
in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its 
long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the 
business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening 
sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence 
since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about 
the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks 
and a looming Brexit.

For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as 
orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this 
survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that 
expectations about future demand went down.

Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the 
downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and 
businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking 
the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on 
the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but 
consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming 
down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are 
benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone 
currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of 
downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent.

Another indicator that a US rate rise could come sooner than expected comes 
with a bigger than expected rise in consumer spending.

The Commerce Department said consumer spending climbed by 0.5% in February, 
compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Meanwhile there was also a 0.5% 
rise in income, the largest increase since June.

And the final release of the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey 
rose to 91.7, up from 90.7.

But Rob Carnell at ING Bank said it was still difficult to judge the current 
state of the US economy:

As we head into payrolls week next week, there is still a distinct lack of 
clarity about where the US economy is headed. And given the nature of the 
non-farm payrolls jobs release, we may not be much the wiser by next Friday, 
and in consequence, there is likely to still be considerable uncertainty about 
the direction the Fed will be taking. Markets dislike uncertainty.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back again on Monday.

 
After a brief revival, the pound is slipping back to seven year lows against 
the dollar, on a combination of the better than expected US GDP figures and 
continuing uncertainty over the UK referendum on whether to leave the European 
Union.

Sterling is now down at $1.3925, heading back towards the seven year low of 
$1.3878 it reached on Wednesday.
 
US markets have followed their European counterparts higher, boosted by rising 
oil prices and better than expected American GDP figures.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed around 90 points or 0.5% in early 
trading, while the S&P 500 is up 0.3% and Nasdaq 0.7% higher at the open.
 
Hopes of co-ordinated global policy measures from the G20 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20> finance ministers meeting in Shanghai 
seem to be fading. Reuters reports:

China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> sought to restore confidence 
in its economy as financial leaders from G20 nations gathered in Shanghai on 
Friday, and Premier Li Keqiang urged greater global coordination and 
consideration of policy spillovers.

But Germany appeared to all but rule out coordinated stimulus to counter a 
deepening global chill, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said there was no 
need for a crisis response, as in 2009 when the Group of 20 (G20) major 
economies agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression.

While the health of the world’s second-largest economy, which hosts the G20 
presidency this year, is a key talking point around the two-day summit, the 
threat of the UK leaving the European Union and its political and economic 
implications have also surfaced as concerns among participants in the meeting.

“Macroeconomic policy coordination needs to be strengthened. The global 
economic and financial situation may have become more grim and complex. It is 
time for countries to stand together to tide over difficulties,” Li said in a 
video message at the opening of the meeting.

Several other policymakers have urged better coordination, but there was 
disagreement about what steps to take, making it unlikely that concrete action 
points will emerge from the meeting.

“Talking about further stimulus just distracts from the real tasks at hand,” 
Germany’s Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble said, rebuffing a 
recommendation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the G20 should 
start planning now for a coordinated stimulus programme.

“We, therefore, do not agree on a G20 fiscal stimulus package as some argue, 
in case outlook risks materialise.”

Lew had a similar message, saying there was a great deal of economic 
uncertainty at present but no crisis.

“It would not be reasonable to expect a crisis response in an environment that 
is not a crisis,” he said told reporters.

Overhanging the summit of major economy finance ministers and central bankers 
are global concerns about China’s ability to manage its domestic markets, 
currency and commitment to wider restructuring reforms. Concerns about its 
slowing economy and confusion over its currency policy were among the factors 
which sowed turmoil in global markets in January.

The case for further policy stimulus amid rising debt levels and already 
extremely low interest rates was a hard sell among some other G20 members.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned cutting rates below zero carried 
serious risks, and blamed the recent global slump in shares and other assets on 
the failure of governments to make bold economics reforms.

Schaeuble said the debt-financed growth model had “reached its limits (and) is 
even causing new problems, raising debt, causing bubbles and excessive risk 
taking, zombifying the economy.”

And Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso shrugged off calls from some quarters 
for Tokyo to roll out fresh fiscal stimulus. Japan’s central bank stunned 
investors by adopting negative interest rates last month.
 
The dollar has strengthened following the US GDP data, with sterling now at 
$1.3960 having earlier regained the $1.4 level.
 
Dennis de Jong, managing directorat UFX.com, said:

A dreary Dow Jones is likely to be perked up by today’s better than expected 
US GDP figures, with annualised growth jumping up to the 1% mark.

Financial markets were expecting a slowdown in the world’s largest economy, so 
much so that conversations about a recession weren’t far away.

Yet, with unemployment remaining low and wages increasing at their fastest 
rate since 2009, growth is back on the agenda. Add to that cheap fuel prices 
and low mortgage rates, and it may only be a matter of time until disposable 
incomes are fully realised and growth continues to speed up.
 
The better than expected US GDP figures should at least calm fears the country 
is heading into a recession.

The US economy saw a slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter, but not as much 
as first thought.

In its second revision, the Commerce Department said GDP grew at an annual 
rate of 1%, compared to the initial forecast of 0.7%. Analysts had been 
expecting the figure to be revised down to 0.4%.

But this is still a slowdown on the 2% growth reported in the previous three 
months.

The revision came as businesses seemed less aggressive in their efforts to 
reduce inventory.

More signs of weak inflation across the eurozone.

German’s harmonised consumer price index is up 0.4% month on month, but down 
0.2% year on year, compared to expectations of a flat figure. This is the 
lowest annual level since January 2015.

More for the ECB to think about, with German inflation set to go into negative 
territory.Reuters reports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-economy-inflation-idUSKCN0VZ1DK>:

German inflation turned negative in February for the first time in five 
months, preliminary state data indicated on Friday, giving proponents of 
further monetary policy easing more ammunition for a European Central Bank 
meeting next month.

Consumer prices fell below zero on the year in five German states, the data 
showed. In the most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation 
slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent in January.

The state readings will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1300 GMT 
(08:00 a.m. EST).

Capital Economics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> analyst 
Jessica Hinds said the state data suggested that pan-German EU-harmonized 
consumer price inflation (HICP) dropped to -0.1 percent from +0.4 percent in 
January.
 
The market rally is continuing, helped by renewed strength in the oil prices.

Brent crude is up 2% at $36.03 a barrel on hopes that a meeting between Saudia 
Arabia, Russia and Venezuela could tackle the low oil price. Analyst Connor 
Campbell at Spreadex said:

The global indices continued to strive for recent highs this Friday, their 
growth sustained by a $36 per barrel crossing surge from Brent Crude. However, 
if expectations of a miserly US fourth quarter GDP figure this afternoon are 
accurate the US open may end up slightly spoiling the end of week party.

Currently, at least, the Dow Jones is joining in with its galloping European 
peers, the futures promising a 110 point rise when the bell rings on Wall 
Street, something that would leave the index at its highest point since the 
first week of January. Yet the spectre of this afternoon’s latest fourth 
quarter GDP reading may temper investors’ enthusiasm, analysts forecasting a 
downward revision from an already awful annualised 0.7% to 0.4%.
 
And here’s more for the ECB to think about:

<https://twitter.com/MxSba/status/703174678529994753>  
 European confidence and inflation figures make a strong case for further 
stimulus measures from the European Central Bank at its March meeting, says 
Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight:

Certainly, the marked drop in overall business and consumer confidence across 
theEurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> to an 8-month low 
heightens concern about faltering growth.

However, price developments in the survey did offer a little bit of good news 
for the ECB. The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers’ 
inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they 
were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose 
slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened 
among manufacturers

In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in 
February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by 
early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to 
deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food 
prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February 
(the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw 
consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January.

There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation 
in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 
0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity 
prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round 
effects on wages and price setting.

We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to 
-0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly 
purchase of assets (perhaps by €20bn-€30bn from the current level of €60bn. 
There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its 
deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks’ profitability from another 
cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks’ deposits with the 
ECB above a certain level
 
Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands 
in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says:

Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber 
mood about theEurozone <https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> economy 
in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its 
long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the 
business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening 
sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence 
since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about 
the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks 
and a looming Brexit.

For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as 
orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this 
survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that 
expectations about future demand went down.

Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the 
downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and 
businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking 
the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on 
the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but 
consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming 
down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are 
benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone 
currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of 
downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent.
