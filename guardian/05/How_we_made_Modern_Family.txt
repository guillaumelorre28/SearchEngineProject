We were playing around with a lot of ideas for sitcoms but they didn’t seem 
real. So we thought, how about what we talk about between ourselves – our kids 
and the idiotic things that happen in our households? Is there a way to do a 
family show – which is, in a way, the most trite subject on TV – that makes it 
a bit more real? That got us to the documentary-style idea. And we wanted the 
families to be united in some way, so we made them three parts of a whole.

Comedy <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy> had become this thing that 
was easily consumed, but ultimately not very nutritious. There was lots of 
snarkiness and cynicism but nothing uplifting, nothing good for the soul. No 
protein! We wanted our show to have some heart, which left us open to criticism 
that we were being sentimental. But we wanted moments of drama and emotion.

When it came to casting, I had worked with Ty Burrell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/01/ty-burrell-this-much-i-know>
, who plays Phil Dunphy, on a couple of things, and couldn’t understand how he 
had been floating around as long as he had without being on a hit show. 
Appealing, good-looking, so funny – it just doesn’t happen that often. We 
wanted him, but the network didn’t. But we shot a scene with him and to their 
credit they saw what he has and said: “We were wrong.”

It was similar with Sofía V <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sof%C3%ADa_Vergara>
ergara <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sof%C3%ADa_Vergara>, who plays Gloria. A 
beautiful woman who is funny and also kind of a natural clown? We were pretty 
much sold.

Rico Rodriguez <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2349726/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t7> 
(Manny) hadn’t done a lot of acting. At castings you usually see a procession 
of Hollywood kids with sparkly teeth and moms waiting in the wings mouthing 
their words along with them. But he didn’t have that at all. He was just a very 
bright, likable kid with a raw quality that seemed real. He’s learned as he’s 
gone on and got better and better, but there’s that core innocence and 
sweetness about him that we liked from day one.

The mockumentary format felt current, in an age when reality shows were – are 
– so popular. Plus I had just done an experimental low-budget pilot and shot it 
documentary-style and really fell in love with the form. From a production 
standpoint, it allows us to move so much faster. You get the spontaneity of 
being able to shoot both actors at the same time and not letting jokes get 
stale while you do coverage. Our hours are great; everybody’s happy.

When it came to constructing the family, there were so many points we could 
have made. We knew we wanted to have multiple families, to bounce back and 
forth between them and connect them. We talked about all sorts of different 
permutations. Three siblings? One single, for the dating stories? But I had 
worked onJust Shoot Me! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Shoot_Me!>, and 
Chris and I had both worked onFrasier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/apr/16/frasier-your-next-box-set>
, and we loved the idea of a father with adult kids. He could be starting over. 
Then we wanted cross-cultural aspects – the father’s new wife could be African 
American, Hispanic, Asian, for example.

I see a lot of pilots, and what people do is create characters that work for 
that initial episode, but once that story’s over they don’t know what to do 
because they haven’t clear conflicts or relationships. It took us about six 
weeks to figure out who everyone was, before we even looked at plot. Then our 
casting director Jeff Greenberg saw about 1,400 people for the 10 roles and we 
saw about 200-300 of them.

 Watch the trailer for Modern Family 
We had already cast Jesse Tyler Ferguson <http://www.jessetylerferguson.com/> 
as Mitch and were trying to find him a “mate”.Eric Stonestreet 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Stonestreet> (Cameron) was a surprise. He 
wasn’t who we were picturing. That happens a lot. His audition performance was 
very still, very precise. Nobody beat it. We kept coming back to him.

Chris and I were nervous about kids. At one point I said: “Argh – maybe we 
should make this an animated show!” But we started seeing them and were blown 
away by the quality of the choices we had. We struck gold.

There’s always a lot of excitement when you start shooting, but people are 
very nervous. There’s so much at stake and you don’t know – are we working on 
something that’s going to shoot for a few days or will this be the next 10 
years of our lives? I remember the last day of the pilot so well. We were in 
the backyard of Mitch and Cam’s house and I was watching the monitors and I 
turned to Chris and said, “You know, this is really good! I think we could have 
something here.”
