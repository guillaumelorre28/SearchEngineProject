It’s 10am in Los Angeles and Kathryn Hahn is sitting in her car, having just 
dropped her children off at school. Only recently did her young son and 
daughter cotton on to what their 41-year-old mother does for a living. “We were 
having dinner,” she tells me on the phone, “and my son said: ‘So you’re an 
actor, right?’ I was, like, ‘Yeah.’ He said: ‘Show me your act, then.’ ... Boy, 
he really put me on the spot. I tried to bust out some dinosaur noises for him; 
told a joke. I gotta say, it was not impressive. It fell flat.”

What she really needs, I suggest, is some Pixar voice work. “That would swing 
it. Though my kids did see me in that Disney movie,Tomorrowland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomorrowland>. They were very excited that 
Mummy got her head blown off and turned out to be a robot. It was much better 
than when they saw me onbillboards with some strange man 
<http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YsrxtAyhpKY/VSE3tb7rG7I/AAAAAAABpfU/6cemGbcAlVU/s1600/happyish-header.jpg>
. ‘Oh look, Mummy’s in bed with a man who isn’t Daddy and the whole of Los 
Angeles can see …’”

Suddenly she lets out a little gasp. “I’ve been parked here the whole time 
we’ve been speaking,” she says, “and now there are a couple of uniformed 
officers circling the car.” There’s a brief moment of silence while she keeps 
an eye on their movements. “I’m just wondering if I put enough money in the 
meter …” Another pause. “No, it’s fine. They’re gone. We’re all good.”

While it’s nice that she didn’t get into any trouble, the world has now been 
denied an entertaining and not-untypical Kathryn Hahn scene that might have 
been. Chances are the cops would have recognised her. Most likely from one of 
the raucous comedies to which she has added pep over the past decade. MaybeStep 
Brothers <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBVGs8YXoJc>, where she jumped John C 
Reilly’s bones at every opportunity. OrWe’re the Millers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/22/were-the-millers-review>, in 
which she played the chirpy matriarch in a motor home who cosies up toJennifer 
Aniston <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-aniston> and her fake 
family. OrWanderlust 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/01/wanderlust-review>, again with 
Aniston, where Hahn played an abrasive hippy. If the cops are telly fans, they 
might have caught her as the working mother whoemploys Jessa as a nanny in Girls
 <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/girls>, or as the fierce, dazzling 
campaign manager who tells Amy Poehler inParks and Recreation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation>: “You can trust 
me because I don’t care enough about you to lie.”

Failing all that, it would simply have been a blast to hear Hahn talk her way 
out of a parking ticket. In a short space of time, she has become one of those 
performers on whom audiences can depend to produce results out of all 
proportion to the size of her role. Her latest is as the wife of an unfaithful 
theatre director (Owen Wilson) in the lightweight farceShe’s Funny That Way 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/29/shes-funny-that-way-bogdanovich-is-back-but-the-laughs-arent-review>
. It’s her third film with her old chum Aniston (Hahngave a speech 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQlx9nLo9lc> when the Friends actor got her 
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame) and is directed by the Peter Bogdanovich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/29/peter-bogdanovich-venice-film-festival-shes-funny-like-that>
.

“I don’t think Peter likes the kind of improv-heavy, nasty comedy that there 
is so much of these days – and which I’m personally all for, I gotta tell you. 
There’s a buoyancy he brings to this movie that is amazing when you step back 
and look at what it’s about. I mean, my character’s husband has a weakness for 
prostitutes – come on!”

The best you could say about the film is that it would have been worse in the 
hands ofWoody Allen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen>. But Hahn is 
magnificent, her performance escalating from casual jauntiness to righteous 
mania as she confronts the scale of her husband’s infidelities. “I don’t know 
if you’re with me or not on this,” she says, “but, to me, it’s never that 
interesting when someone is reaching for the laugh. You have to have it rooted 
in truth otherwise it’s all just artifice. It doesn’t matter how crazy it gets, 
it still has to be recognisable.”

In her controlled hysteria there are echoes of the comic legend Madeline Kahn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/06/guardianobituaries2>, who played 
another wronged woman inBogdanovich’s 1972 screwball masterpiece What’s Up, Doc?
 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up,_Doc%3F_%281972_film%29>. At the 
comparison, Hahn releases a shriek loud enough to bring those cops scurrying 
back. “OK, I am gonna hang up now because this day cannot get any better! She 
was a doll. The idea that I could get anywhere close to that is just … She has 
inspired everything I’ve done. She is a genius.”

Some of us are starting to feel the same way about Hahn. It isn’t just that 
she can convey an entire life in one incredulous grimace or narrow-eyed smile. 
There is also her dexterity. As wild as she got in Step Brothers, flinging 
herself at the object of her affection in the men’s bathroom before peeing 
nonchalantly at a urinal, she never let the comedy obscure her character’s 
desperation (“I hate my life!” she wailed). Her dramatic work is just as 
impressive: she was Kate Winslet’s neighbour inRevolutionary Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/revolutionary-road>, and gave her most 
complex performance yet as a married mother drawn to a young female sex-worker 
inAfternoon Delight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/27/afternoon-delight-review-hahn-juno-temple-stripper>
 (written and directed by Jill Soloway, who also cast Hahn as atroubled rabbi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/31/jill-soloway-afternoon-delight> 
in her Amazon Primeseries Transparent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/26/jeffrey-tambor-transparent-interview>

“I don’t make any distinction between comedy and drama. My favourite summer of 
all was when I was shooting Revolutionary Road and Step Brothers back to back, 
or We’re the Millers and Afternoon Delight. I love comedy and feel like I fit 
into that world, but I also feel like I’m a visitor there sometimes. I never 
say I’m a natural improviser but, if I have that bulletproof shell of knowing 
the character inside out, then I can do it. On Step Brothers there were a lot 
of shitty takes we didn’t use, but it’s all part of the creativity.” One of her 
favourite films, she says, isJohn Cassavetes’s A Woman Under the Influence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/03/film-changed-life-cameron-mitchell>
. “It’s not comic, but there’s a fearlessness aboutGena Rowlands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/mar/02/culture.features3> that is 
unhinged. That approach is useful in comedy.”

Hahn has now left behind what she has called the “best-friend chapter” of her 
career (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/apr/18/artsfeatures5>, A Lot Like Love
 <https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jun/24/4>). “I think I was the 
best friend first, then therandy crazy lady 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/this-is-where-i-leave-you> [Step Brothers, 
This Is Where I Leave You]. Now I’m not sure what I am. Afternoon Delight was 
probably the first time I thought, ‘This is what I wanted someone to ask of 
me.’” That 2013 film helped awaken the industry to the extent of Hahn’s 
capabilities. The epiphany might have come even sooner if theUS TV version of 
Absolutely Fabulous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/absolutely-fabulous-prescient-ab-fab>
, in which she played Eddy opposite her Girls co-starZosia Mamet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/19/zosia-mamet-shoshanna-girls>
 as Saffy andKristen Johnston <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Johnston> 
as Patsy, had been greenlit.

“We did the pilot, but it was the worst timing: right in the middle of the 
financial crisis. No one wanted to hear about excess. But they were such 
despicable people that there was something very liberating about doing it. I 
love the comedy of unearned confidence: people wanting something so badly that 
they stop themselves getting it. Happiness always just out of reach.”

She addresses a similar subject in her latest TV series, Happyish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/24/happyish-steve-coogans-new-vehicle-has-some-growing-paynes>
. The pilot starred thelate Philip Seymour Hoffman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/03/philip-seymour-hoffman> as a 
dissatisfied advertising executive; it was retooled several years later for 
his’s replacement,Steve Coogan <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/coogan>. 
“It’s looking at how to be present and happy in your life,” Hahn explains. “How 
do you stop searching for happiness when it could be right in front of you? 
It’s something I’ve come across so many times. It’s about not always reaching 
for something else. There’s a certain point in your life when you’re like: ‘Oh, 
wow. Maybe I won’t win the Academy award. Now what?’”

She’s Funny That Way is released in the UK on 26 June.
