Chasing lightning in Venezuela

Between April and November, on any given night at Lake Maracaibo – a large 
brackish bay connected to the Gulf of Venezuela – lightning bolts, appearing 
200 to a minute, draw great cracks across the sky illuminating the night. The 
lightning here is so intense and frequent that it has justwon a place in The 
Guinness Book of World Records 
<http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/131126/catatumbo-lightning-smashes-guinness-record>
. You can travel here from Mérida, itself something of an adventure destination 
where thrillseekers will be able to experience the world's highest cable car 
when it opens later this year.

From the historic town, tourists go north through the Sierra La Culata 
national park to catch a speedboat to the lake-top fishing communities at the 
heart of nature's own plasma ball. This untouched land is remote enough to 
retain a wilderness feel, even without the lightning, and is home to jaguars, 
alligators, boa constrictors and monkeys, all of which retreat as the storms 
draw closer in the small hours. And when the lightning arrives – caused by 
heat, humidity and Andean winds, and accompanied by roaring thunder – it 
explodes in all directions burning jagged bolts into your retina. A unique 
Central American experience.

Town and country, Colombia

Colombia is an intriguing mixture of modern cities and remote wilderness, and 
on this trip you can experience both. It takes in the multicultural city of 
Bogotá, before heading north to the Caribbean coast and then plunging into the 
jungles of the Sierra Nevada mountains for a challenging five-day hike to the 
lost city of Teyuna, the last stage being a climb up 1,200 stone steps. From 
there it's on to the Amazon Rainforest, on the border with Peru and Brazil, and 
a camp sited on a tree-top platform from which you can kayak to see caiman, 
monkeys and sloth.
• The 15-day trip costs £1,685 including most meals and internal but not 
international flights. 020-3642 4246,sumak-travel.org

Sky train, Ecuador

Ecuador's Trans-Andean railway reopened last year after several years out of 
action. Although the famous Tren Crucero was created for trade purposes, it now 
operates at a leisurely speed for tourists wanting to see banana plantations, 
active volcanoes and plenty of wildlife on a four-day trip. With a maximum 
height of nearly 3,000 metres, getting back down again, via a nerve-inducing 
series of switchbacks (the aptly named Devil's Nose) is a memorable 
white-knuckle experience.
• The 10-day Back on Track trip, including four nights on board, departing 26 
June, costs £3,298 with Journey Latin America (020-3582 5502,

Trekking, Brazil

The Chapada Diamantina national park in the state of Bahia is a beautiful area 
of dramatic flat-topped mountains, waterfalls, sparkling blue pools and lush 
rainforest. In the 1840s diamond prospecters flocked here but now it is a 
protected area and very peaceful. The six-day trek goes deep into the park, 
passing waterfalls – plenty of swimming opportunities – and spectacular rock 
formations with homestay accommodation. The walk starts and finishes in the 
pretty colonial town of Lençóis, then you will visit Salavador and Rio for a 
couple of nights' recuperation.
• The 12-day trip departs 27 September and 17 January 2015 and costs from

and dramatic gorges.

Swim with Humpbacks, Dominican Republic

Every year thousands of humpback whales head to a limestone reef 70 miles 
north of the Dominican Republic for the breeding season. In this adventure, you 
sail to the Silver Bank in a liveaboard dive ship then, twice a day, move out 
on small boats to locate the whales. Once in the water you wait for them to 
approach, which they do, sometimes with their young. You will hear whale song 
and see them breech, fluke and nurse their babies – who themselves are often 
very curious about humans.
• A 10-day tour departs 14 March and costs from £4,295 including meals and 
flights. 017687 73966,naturetrek.co.uk

Sailing, Belize

Belize has the world's second largest offshore reef, a fabulous place to 
explore by boat. Take Doris along and the exploration becomes hugely exciting, 
and also extremely comfortable. She is a 50ft catamaran equipped with sea 
kayaks, fishing and snorkelling gear plus a well-stocked bar, and a chef. Head 
out to Goff's Caye, a palm-fringed tropical atoll then island hop to Tobacco 
Caye where, on the right night, there is magical bioluminescence. With luck 
you'll also spot giant rays, turtles and manatees.
• Hire Doris for $1,295 a day all-inclusive for a group of six.

Mountain trekking, Peru


One of the greatest adventure stories of recent years must be Joe Simpson's 
Touching the Void <http://touchingthevoid.com/> and this trip takes you around 
the 30km long cordillera of Peru's Huayhuash mountains where that epic story 
unfolded. Travelling with donkeys, you trek over several high passes and camp 
in emerald green meadows beside glacial lakes surrounded by snow-capped peaks. 
You need to be fit and strong but there are three days of acclimatisation 
before you go to just over 5,000 metres.
• 19 days from £2,795 with flights or £1,795 without. 0114 276 3322,
