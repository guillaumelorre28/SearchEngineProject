Barry Bennell, the former Crewe Alexandra youth-team coach, has been remanded 
in custody after appearing in court charged with sexual assaults against a boy 
in the 1980s. He is scheduled to appear at Chester crown court on 11 January.

Bennell did not enter a plea when he appeared by videolink at Crewe 
magistratesâ€™ court to face eight offences, including assault with intent to 
commit buggery, against a boy under the age of 15, from 1981 to 1985.

One of the offences is alleged to have taken place at a Butlins holiday camp, 
another in a car and another at an address in the Peak District.

Bennell, 62, looked frail and sat with his arms folded during the 14-minute 
appearance when he gave his last address as Milton Keynes. He has previously 
coached boys affiliated to Manchester City and also had past links with Stoke 
City as well as coaching a number of other junior sides in Cheshire, 
Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Greater Manchester and the United States.
