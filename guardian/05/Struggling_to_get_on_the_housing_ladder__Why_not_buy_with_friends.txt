For the single home buyer, the prospects for getting on the property ladder 
are not encouraging. The difficulty of saving for a deposit, coupled with a 
lack of appetite among lenders for high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages, means 
the number of singletons making purchases is dropping.

So it is little surprise that an increasing number of friends are coming 
together to buy. Figures from conveyancing firm My Home Move show the number of 
homes bought by “single” purchasers has fallen by an average of 4% over the 
past five years, equivalent to around 10,000 transactions a year.

The benefits of pooling resources are clear: My Home Move figures show a 
couple of first-time buyers can afford homes worth around £100,000 more than 
their single counterparts. Given the latest government figures show the annual 
rate of house price growth stood at 8.3% in July – bringing the average 
property value to £216,750 – this additional buying power can make a big 
difference. Separate new figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders put the 
average house price for a first-time buyer house at £156,500.

“What is clear is that annually house prices are still on the rise at levels 
well above wage inflation,” says Jeremy Duncombe of the Legal & General 
Mortgage Club. “This growing gap ultimately makes the housing market more 
unaffordable, and the prospect of homeownership much harder for buyers looking 
to take their first step.”

Saving for a deposit, and that aversion among banks towards high LTV 
mortgages, continues to be problematic. According to the latest AmTrust 
Moneyfacts LTV tracker, the number of available home loans for those with 5% 
deposits fell from 243 in July to 238 in August.

“More people are buying property with someone else because prices continue to 
rise in many parts of the country, and two salaries – or more – will get you 
much further than one,” says Adrian Anderson from broker Anderson Harris.

But while friends who share a night out together may see collaboration as 
their only way to tackle spiralling prices, there are pitfalls. “Buying a 
property becomes more complicated when you involve multiple parties, not only 
from a financial perspective, but also due to the increased potential for 
changes in circumstances,” says Brian Murphy from the Mortgage Advice Bureau. 
“Co-buyers need to go into joint ownership with their eyes wide open.”

Here are some of the issues that such buyers need to be wary of:

your eyes wide open

How to structure the purchase

Up to four people can be registered as legal co-owners of a property, but one 
of the most important considerations is how to structure the purchase. The most 
popular option is to be “tenants in common”. Unlike “joint tenants” you don’t 
have to own equal shares and the property doesn’t automatically go to the other 
owners if you die. You can also pass on your share of the property in your will.

Findings from My Home Move show a rise in the number of people buying as 
tenants in common, particularly those with unequal shares.

“Buyers purchasing as tenants in common are usually not married and as such 
have individual interest in safeguarding the investment they put into the 
property by listing who owns which share,” says Doug Crawford from My Home 
Move. “By choosing to buy a property in this way, it means two or more 
purchasers can pool their collective resources to afford the best home 
possible.”

If you are not putting in the same amount towards the deposit, mortgage and 
other expenses, it’s important to get everything documented in a formal 
declaration of trust. This ensures everyone is clear about how much each buyer 
is putting in, and should include contributions towards deposits, stamp duty 
and legal fees, as well as how much each person is paying each month in terms 
of the mortgage and other expenditure.

Trust and commitment

When entering into a joint agreement, it’s essential that all parties 
understand their commitment.

“As joint owners you are all responsible for the mortgage payments,” says 
David Gilman from the conveyancing arm of Blacks Solicitors. “This means if one 
person can’t pay their share one month, all the other owners are liable.”

If you are buying with a friend you have to be prepared to be upfront and 
honest about every aspect of your finances; you should also demand that 
everyone else does the same.

“All credit scores will be taken into account,” says Ansar Afsar from broker 
We KnowMortgages <https://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages>. “You’ll need to 
know whether the person you are buying with has any problems with their credit 
history which could affect your chances of getting a mortgage.”

When co-buying, you need to plan ahead and take legal advice on how to 
structure the purchase. “You might be the best of friends at the beginning,” 
says Mark Harris from broker SPF Private Clients. “But relationships do 
disintegrate, and it is far easier to manage a falling out if you have all the 
details of who contributed what to the property purchase in writing.”

Searching for a mortgage

While up to four people can purchase a property together, mortgage experts 
warn that the number of lenders who are able to consider multiple incomes is 
far more limited.

“A number may allow four purchasers, but some will only consider two primary 
incomes for affordability purposes,” says Murphy. “Other lenders are more 
pragmatic, and will consider three – and even four – but choice is considerably 
reduced.”

The get-out clause

To plan for someone selling their share, you should set out details of an exit 
plan in the declaration of trust.

“This should set out key details such as when the property can be sold and how 
any profit should be shared. For example, if one person has paid more for 
renovations, they may expect more of any sale proceeds,” says Gilman. This 
document may need to be updated regularly to reflect any changes in the 
co-owner circumstances.

Buyers should also think about what would happen if one of the group lost 
their job – or even died. Ensuring the correct protection cover is in place can 
give peace of mind to all parties that the financial commitment will be covered 
should the worst happen.

Happy together, while ready to move on

When Louise Hartley and Hanna Cevik bought a flat together earlier this year, 
they took several precautions at the outset to try and reduce the risk of 
problems cropping up when either of them decided to move on.

Friends for 13 years, once they found themselves ready to buy they decided to 
pool resources so they would not have to make too many compromises on location 
or space.

“We were both keen to stay as central as possible in London rather than having 
to move further out to zones three or four,” says Hartley. “By combining our 
savings and salaries we were able to buy a place that we liked.”

Hartley, a barrister, and Cevik, a marketing manager, bought a two-bed flat in 
Stoke Newington for £465,000 in February. Their combined savings gave them a 
deposit of 19%, enabling them to get a competitive 2.04% rate on their two-year 
fixed-rate mortgage with Nationwide, helping to keep down their monthly 
outgoings. One of the biggest issues they needed to address before buying was 
how best to structure the purchase.

“As Hanna was putting down a greater share of the deposit – as she had an 
inheritance – we decided to buy the property as ‘tenants in common with unequal 
shares’,” says Hartley. “We got this documented in a declaration of trust. This 
sets out how much each of us has put towards the deposit, and the share each of 
us owns – meaning we can each safeguard our investment. The declaration also 
details our liability under the mortgage and sets out who is due what 
percentage of the property at the point one of us exits the agreement, or the 
property is sold.

“We are loving living together at the moment, but at some point we will move 
in with partners. Neither of us wanted to wait to get on the property ladder, 
so by having all the details set down in writing we can enjoy owning a home now 
without having to worry about what will happen when we move on from sharing.”
