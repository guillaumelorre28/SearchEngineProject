Winning tip: Green Britain centre, Swaffham, Norfolk


Here’s a place where you can climb up inside probably the only modern windmill 
in the world open to the public, and look out from its viewing platform, 65 
metres up. You can watch the huge solar tracker following the sun across the 
sky, making clean energy. My family enjoyed finding out about the windmill 
blade that, according to some newspapers at the time, was struck by a UFO, and 
examining Greenbird, which is the fastest wind-powered vehicle on the planet. 
It’s a fabulous place where all ages can learn about renewable energy and 
eco-technology in a beautiful environment, wandering around organic orchards, 
gardens and wetlands. Our whole family loved it.

We stumbled upon this day out trying to find something cheap to do with two 
young children. My mum had mentioned Rivington Pike but I couldn’t see how it 
would keep the kids entertained. That morning we packed a picnic and headed up 
on what we thought would be just a quick walk up a hill, but even at the start 
of the journey there was so much to see and lots of adventure. There were 
different paths and hidden places covered by trees, time and the odd waterfall. 
We came across an abandoned zoo left for 90 years, aJapanese garden 
<http://www.visitnorthwest.com/sights/rivington-terraced-gardens/> and an 
abandoned house before reaching the summit. We’ve been back and found many more 
things such as ruins and caves. There always seem to be more paths and more to 
look at. Overall you could not ask for more from a free day out.

In a less-visited corner of the Brecon Beacons is a young adventurers’ 
playground, ideal for teenagers. There are caves to explore, waterfalls to 
traverse and gorges to scramble. Adventures Wales (based at Pontneddfechan, 
near Neath) does professionally led gorge scrambling trips. Participants will 
jump off waterfalls, slide down rapids and climb gorges - all while being 
safely supervised by an experienced guide. It really is a thrilling, fun day 
out for the whole family. Just be prepared to get wet! For younger children, 
the walk alone is enough to excite and amaze. The footpath passes right behind 
one waterfall, a wonderful experience.

A wonderful day out beckons here. The zoo has evolved over the past few years 
and we love it. Even grumpy husband who balks at theme parks becomes fascinated 
by the African plains zone. Small ones love the meerkats, teenagers are 
fascinated by the lions rescued from Romania and everyone adores the polar 
bears playing in their lake.

This 18th-century romantic masterpiece north of Shrewsbury is so much more 
than just a garden. It was created by the powerful Hill family, who purchased 
the grounds in Tudor times, with the aim of overwhelming their guests’ visual 
and spiritual senses. It was great to be able to bring our dog, too. The place 
appeals to all generations, with a magical walk through majestic woodlands and 
along precipitous cliff edges, discovering tunnels and ravines. The children 
loved being given torches to explore the tunnels and caves, whereas we adults 
loved the magnificent views. We did the longest walk, which took several hours, 
but included the white tower – a 30-metre high monument with a spiral staircase 
of 150 steps and a hermit’s lodge. There are short cuts for the weary walker on 
the way and plenty of picnic places. A brilliant day out.

Dartmouth Park has an amazing array of adventure playground equipment, some of 
which I’ve never seen anywhere else, and a splash pad for water play, while 
adjoining Sandwell Valley also has a great adventure playground and an aerial 
high ropes course next to it (from £8pp), plus cycle hire, a restored Victorian 
farm and a RSPB visitors’ centre. You can walk the mile to the park from West 
Bromwich bus station or tram stop through the new town centre, and to top it 
all off, the ice-creams from the van are half the price they are in Birmingham!

Amid the urban sprawl of the Thames Valley, there’s a surprising oasis of 
calm. This country park is a haven for wildlife and perfect for anyone who 
enjoys the outdoors and appreciates nature. There are 450 acres of parkland to 
explore, with lakeside walks, woodland, meadows, an adventure playground, 
picnic areas, bird hides, an award-winning cafe (the homemade cakes are 
delicious) and for the more adventurous, boating and Segway hire. So whether 
you’re a dog walker, a nature lover, a cyclist or a family on a day out, 
there’s something for all.

Cruise Loch Lomond and the RSPB offer a combined cruise and guided 
birdwatching tour along the banks of Loch Lomond. We joined the cruise in 
Tarbet, looking for osprey along the water and then the RSPB guide and 
volunteers took us on a guided walk through the reserve in Inversnaid on the 
opposite bank, near Rob Roy’s cave. The guides teach you to identify certain 
bird songs, and all about the flora and fauna - and just generally it’s a 
beautiful walk! There are hotels on both sides of the bank if you fancy some 
decent food, too.
• Adult £17, child £9, family £47, leaves Tarbet at 11.30am, next cruise 30
