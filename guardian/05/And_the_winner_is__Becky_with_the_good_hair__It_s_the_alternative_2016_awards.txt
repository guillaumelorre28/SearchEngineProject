BEST WHODUNNIT 
Becky with the good hair

Trapped, Marcella, The Missing: this year has been jam-packed with 
mind-boggling mysteries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-explainer>
. But, in a strange twist, the most compelling came not from the world of TV 
crime drama but audio-visual progressive R&B. When Beyoncé concluded her 
apparently Jay Z-baiting track Sorry with the lyric “he better call Becky with 
the good hair”, the hunt for its subject was on. Early suspects included Rita 
Ora and Taylor Swift, before it emerged that “Becky” was a generic term for a 
white woman and – according to the song’s co-writer Wynter Gordon – not a 
reference to any one person. And so the search continues…RA

BEST BLOCKBUSTER ACTION SCENE
Planet Earth II 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/19/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2016-no-1-planet-earth-ii>

Do one, Deadpool. See ya, Suicide Squad. Series two of the Beeb’s animal 
extravaganza bettered any big-budget Hollywood effort for spectacle. Thelizard 
v snakes heart-stopper <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv9hn4IGofM> has been 
rightly celebrated, but just as dramatic was the scene in which a gang of 
marauding wasps attempted to pick off the tadpole offspring of a tiny glass 
frog, only for Dad to deliver an almighty kung-fu kicking courtesy of his 
amazing elasticated leg. Kapow!GM

BEST PROPHECY 
Black Mirror’s San Junipero

After scaring even himself with his PM and the pig episode in 2011, the third 
series ofCharlie Brooker’s Black Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/black-mirror> was at times a bit 
pedestrian (certain scenarios being less dystopian, more already happening to 
teenagers and I’m A Celeb contestants on a fairly regular basis). But there was 
one instalment that was both hair-raisingly outlandish and hair-raisingly 
plausible. Centring on a young woman trying to get off with a glamorous lady in 
an 80s nightclub, it soon unravelled into a scenario that – without giving too 
much away – could well end up being the Pokémon Go generation’s equivalent of 
Brave New World. Haunting, but you know it’s going to happen.RA

THE RIHANNA FT DRAKE AWARD FOR WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK WORKRATE 
Louis Theroux

Perhaps spurred on by the creeping sensation that some of the fringe lunatics 
he’d interviewed over the years were suddenly becoming very mainstream, Louis

MICHAEL GOVE AWARD FOR BEST EXPERT 
Amy Adams in Arrival

“We’ve had enough of experts,” harrumphed apple-cheeked antichrist Gove a 
couple of weeks before the EU referendum. And, in the short term, he was right: 
Britain’s decision to “take back control” was a clear rejection of technocrats, 
elites and generally knowledgeable people. But then came Amy Adams’s cunning 
linguist insmart sci-fi movie Arriva 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/10/arrival-review-amy-adams-jeremy-renner-science-fiction>
l, who used her professional expertise to communicate with aliens and avert the 
total destruction of mankind. A timely reminder that, when it comes to the 
crunch, it’ll be the folk who know what they’re doing who’ll save us, not the 
bloke who looks like a Kinder Surprise toy.GM

BEST USAGE OF A MUM AT AN AWARDS CEREMONY 

Skepta

When the Mercury prize panel decided to recognise the grittiest of music

Skepta, we doubt that they’d foreseen that it would also spawn one of the best 
guest appearances of recent memory:Skepta’s mum

SPECIAL AWARD FOR SERVICES TO THE MIDLIFE CRISIS 
Divorce, Camping and Flowers

Enjoying a midlife crisis? Well, 2016 was the year that amplified it with 
all-too-familiar scenes of unsettled desperation on TV. You could almost smell 
the hate between Sarah Jessica Parker and Thomas Haden Church inDivorce. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/divorce-sarah-jessica-parker-sharon-horgan>
 Julia Davis and her lederhosen was the catalyst for a mass unravelling in 
Camping; while Flowers took that pesky feeling of unhappiness to even darker 
places. Uncomfortable to watch, but very funny.HV

MUSICIAN WE’RE MOST SURPRISED TO FIND STILL ALIVE AT THE END OF 2016 
Iggy Pop

Pity Chris Baker. Every time the Photoshop enthusiast posts his Sgt Pepper 
commemoration of 2016’s celebrity deaths, another music icon bites the dust. 
The Grim Reaper is, at least, democratic: there have been losses from prog 
(Emerson, Lake) to disco (Rod Temperton, David Mancuso); from superstars such 
as Prince and Bowie to cult heroes Sharon Jones and Leon Russell. Altogether 
more hearteningly, the new Rolling Stones album came with tales of Keef (72) 
partying to 7am; Giorgio Moroder (76) threw a summer NYC warehouse bash; while, 
shirtless on the red carpet at Cannes, a distinctly chipper Iggy Pop (69) 
noted: “I seem to have been able to regenerate from the various things I put 
into myself.”MH

“rewind”. Also when yourRadio 1 Live Lounge performance

BEST BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH 
Benedict Cumberbatch

From Hamlet to Sherlock, Benedict Cumberbatch continues to be ubiquitous. 
Magazine covers, chatshows, gifs, at the end of the supermarket checkout 
helping pack your big shop: you couldn’t get away from Cumbers in 2016. Even a 
controversial turn as supermodel All in mega-flop Zoolander 2 couldn’t slow him 
down. The best Cumberbatch though?Doctor Strange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/22/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-marvel-cinematic-universe>
, because anyone who can make the plotline “he’s a neurosurgeon, trained in 
mystical arts!” into an accessible blockbuster character is clearly a genius.IS

BEST ROBOT 
Maeve from Westworld

Not a bad year for robots: Robot Wars’s Sir Killalot was back smashing the 
WD40 out of rickety wrecks built by the lonely in their sheds, and Humans 
returned with a sexy, synthy wallop. But, realistically, 2016 can only belong 
to one android: Thandie Newton’s mechanical madamMaeve in HBO’s Westworld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/07/why-westworld-is-the-defining-show-of-2016>

soulless automaton to an emotionally wrecked, knife-toting Terminator of 
cowpoke badassery. She’ll be back.LH

THE WITCH HOUSE AWARD FOR WORST NEW MUSICAL GENRE 
Tropical house

From Rihanna’s Work <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL1UzIK-flA> to Justin 
Bieber’s Sorry <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRh_vgS2dFE> and Drake’s Views, 
dancehall influences were rife in 2016. But where the Jamaican genre should 
have been getting its dues, the internet crowned it “tropical house” instead.

THE AWARD FOR BEST BIG-BUDGET BOTTOM 
The Night Manager

Bums were big news in 2016. The Turner prize glorified a huge pair of 
buttocks, but even Anthea Hamilton’s cheeky entry couldn’t eclipse the bottom 
that captivated the nation this year. The moment when Tom Hiddleston’s Jonathan 
Pine bared his derriere in theBBC’s The Night Manager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/13/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2016-no-7-the-night-manager>
 was the moment that launched a million memes. What the show lacked in 
plausibility, it delivered in showy, take-your-trousers-off intrigue. Forget 
Emmy nominations, Hiddleston received the ultimate pop culture accolade: a 
stint as Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.HV

MOST UNLIKELY COMEBACK 
Craig David

Craig David had a No 1 album and won a Mobo this year. THIS YEAR. How did that 
even happen? Leigh Francis’s rubber-masked assassination of his credibility in 
the early 00s in Channel 4’s Bo’ Selecta felt so complete that there didn’t 
seem to be any way back for Southampton’s souliest son. So Craig became hench. 
Then: distressingly so. And then BOOM, here he is, in our lives once again, 
beating Sketpa to Mobos. Next year, incredibly, he headlines two nights at 
London’s O2. What sound does Craig David make when he bounces back? Boing.

THE ‘SHOW YOU’D LEAST LIKE TO WATCH WITH YOUR PARENTS’ AWARD 
Fleabag

Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s casual anal sex commentary on BBC3’s Fleabag 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/fleabag-a-hilarious-sitcom-about-terrible-people-and-broken-lives>
 was the most shocking, funny and real scene of the year. Talking about how 
much you loved the show, though, was even more uncomfortable than watching it – 
pub chat resulted in people around the table revealing way too much detail 
about the size of, well, y’know, and mumbling “yeah, so true to life” while 
trying to pretend they watched the whole episode and didn’t just go and sit in 
a bath with their arms around their knees after the first two minutes. Between 
this and Naked Attraction, 2016 was the year we realised that watching TV was 
no longer a family activity.IS

As well as setting a grisly new benchmark for gizzard-slitting ultraviolence, 
GoT’s Battle of the Bastards also brought home a record haul of Emmys. The most 
satisfying scene arguably took place after the supersized medieval havoc, 
though, with industrious sadist Ramsay Bolton finally getting his just deserts

hunting hounds). Who let the dogs out? Sansa, that’s who (who, who, who).GV

only Azealia Banks and Loretta Lynn, and until last week the president-elect’s 
inauguration lineup was risking looking as threadbare as Leave EU’s Bpop Live 
event. But then cameKanye and that photo op at Trump Tower 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/13/kanye-west-donald-trump-meeting-trump-tower>
. What, the world sighed, could these two minted serial attention-seekers 
possibly have in common?MH

MOST POINTLESS TANTRUM 
All those idiots who whinged about Ghostbusters

When the all-female Ghostbusters was announced in 2015, it was like Paul Feig 
had revealed a TV show called Puppy Murder: Live! And as the film’s release 
date got closer, and the cast dared to – gasp! – speak up for themselves, the 
internet went into meltdown. Women? Taking lead roles in films? Making jokes? 
Daring to have opinions? It was only after cast member Leslie Jones was 
subjected to a torrent of racist abuse andhad to leave Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/jul/21/leslie-joness-twitter-abuse-proves-relying-on-users-to-report-bullies-isnt-enough>
, and the film actually came out, that people realised that the movie was 
actually all right, Kate McKinnon was amazing and those childhood memories were 
… still intact. Is it possible that everyone overreacted just a tiny bit and it 
wasn’t the worst thing to happen this year?IS

BEST FORMATION DANCING 
Christine & The Queens

There are plenty of awards that French pop star Héloïse Letissier could have 
won this year: best style, best album, best take on gender fluidity, best 
Gallic rap bits, best backstory (her alter-ego Christine was reared by drag 
acts in Soho). But her dance routines – a fluid, body-popping mix of voguing, 
mime and Michael Jackson, alongside a troupe of backing breakers – were in a 
league of their own, whether performed to a rapt Glastonbury crowd oron Graham 
Norton <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2VKaH2sKtU>. Her rise has been 
unstoppable; long may this dancing queen reign.KH

UNLIKELY WOKE ICON OF THE YEAR 
Gary Lineker

What a year for Gary. Presenting Match Of The Day in his pants after Leicester 
won the league was actually one of the less weird things that happened to him. 
Because, in the absence of anything much from the Labour party, Gary – along 
with comrades James O’Brien and Charlotte Church – has accidentally become the 
unofficial opposition. He’s committed the ultimate sin in post-referendum 
Britain:taking a stand for decency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gary-lineker-hits-back-at-online-abuse-over-hideously-racist-coverage-refugees>
. As a result, this crisp-flogging Guevara wandered into the crosshairs of the 
Mail, the Sun, Ukip and the massed ranks of the UK trollocracy. Still, he’s not 
stopping. Fight the power, Gary.PH

MOST EXCRUCIATINGLY AWKWARD CELEBRITY DEATH MIX-UP Tiffany Pollard

This year, celebrity deaths came so thick and fast that the odd 
miscommunication was probably inevitable. However, the deeply odd and 
fist-bitingly uncomfortable David Bowie/David Gest misunderstanding that took 
place betweenTiffany Pollard and Angie Bowie on Celebrity Big Brother 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97pEKGNT0Xw> was an early sign that in 2016, 
if it could go wrong, it would.PH

THE BOB DYLAN AWARD FOR POP STAR POETRY 
Solange Knowles

In a year of pretentious pop star verse, the 1975’s Matt Healy revealed that 
his album title could have been even more excruciating if he’d used a different 
line from the same poem (“I love it when you sleep, for i swear i’ll protect 
her from the wheedling, redolent, saccharine nectar”, anyone?); Frank Ocean 
littered his Boys Don’t Cry zine with poetic musings (not as impressive as his 
carpentry); while in retrospect Kanye West’s childlike ode to McDonald’s in the 
same publication may have been a cry for help. But Solange went the full Pete 
Doherty. She released a“poetry book” <http://www.solangemusic.com/digitalbook/> 
consisting of lyrics from her excellent albumA Seat At The Table 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/12/best-albums-of-2016-no-5-a-seat-at-the-table-solange>
 – typeset in a such a maddeningly quirky way that it made EE Cummings look 
like an amateur.SR

The Clarkson Steak Implosion of 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/13/jeremy-clarkson-bbc-sued-racial-discrimination-top-gear-oisin-tymon>
 has resulted, rather brilliantly, in a sort of accidental best-case scenario 
coming to pass. It has killed Top Gear, it has killed the legitimacy of 
recycling programme ideas simply because you can get away with it, and it might 
even have killed the baffling currency of the Clarkson-May-Hammond triumvirate 
itself. By wandering off to indulge themselves pointlessly in theirAmazon black 
hole

They’ve become ignorable. So we’ll do that, shall we?PH

THE DREXL SPIVEY AWARD FOR DODGIEST DREADLOCK
Shia LaBeouf for American Honey

Sure, it’s hard to picture a more disturbing coiffure in 2016 than Trump’s 
yellowed bouffant. But trumping that – sorry! – the worst follicle offender 
this year was surelyShia LaBeouf’s lone manky rat’s tail 
<http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Shia_LaBeouf_rat_tail.jpg> in 
Andrea Arnold’s roadtrip youth movie American Honey. It whirled around the 
screen like a firework, threatening to burrow itself into love interest Star’s 
neck at any opportune moment. It sweatily flapped around like a dachshund’s ear 
in summer. It definitely smelt rank. Perhaps the most astounding aspect of 
LaBeouf’s natty braid, though, was how we absolutely fancied him in the film 
spite of it. Which must mean he is the greatest actor who ever lived or 
something.KH

THE ‘STOP BEING GOOD AT SO MUCH STUFF’ AWARD 
Riz Ahmed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/23/riz-ahmed-talks-rogue-one-and-jason-bourne>

The socially acceptable thing when someone is doing well is to be happy for 
them, even if, inside, you’re a broiling caldera of jealousy. Say things like 
“good for you” and “you deserve it”, stuff like that. So, Riz. You stormed 
Jason Bourne. Gripped the nation in The Night Of. Found time to be an actual 
rapper, all while coming across as a decent bloke who’s also in Star Wars? Well 
done, Riz. You deserve it. You bastard.LH

MOST GANGSTER FICTIONAL PRIEST
The Young Pope

Machiavelli in a cassock and flip-flops anyone? Jude Law’s Pope Lenny is an 
utterly terrifying creation. The fags and the Cherry Coke Zero are red 
herrings. This man is ice cold. Brave is the cardinal who steps to him. Foolish 
is the politician who seeks to curb his will to power. He doesn’t even seem to 
be afraid of nuns. He’s got Papal Infallibility and he’s working it to death. 
Father Dougal, he ain’t.PH

THE GRIZZLY MAN AWARD FOR APEX PREDATOR FAIL 
The Revenant bear

It’s only been a few weeks since that Aussie sucker-bopped a kangaroo for 
putting his dog in a headlock, so humanity’s still puffing its chest out, 
thinking it’s the hardest of all the animals. Wrong. The Revenant was a stark 
reminder of this, as Leo DiCaprio’s beautiful face was slapped clean off his 
body by an ornery grizzly in a dispute over a patch of woods. Though his 
character survived, the message was clear: don’t mess with nature. It has 
claws, and teeth, and a temper, and it will happily kill you to death.LH
