Jane Got a Gun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/31/jane-got-a-gun-review-big-nat-no-cattle-as-portman-western-fires-blanks>
 is set somewhere in New Mexico Territory in 1871.Natalie Portman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/natalie-portman>’s grievously wounded husband 
makes it back to their homestead and warns her there’s a posse of villains on 
his heels. The posse takes ages to get there, though, so she has time to park 
her small daughter with a neighbour, then go and ask her resentful ex-boyfriend 
(Joel Edgerton <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/joel-edgerton>) for help, 
and take shooting lessons in preparation for the showdown. Edgerton has never 
forgiven her for having ditched him while he was in the army, but since he 
lives about 10 minutes away, it’s a wonder that it’s only now, after seven 
years, that she lets him know what really went down while he was away. And it 
turns out to be a full complement of Awful Things That Can Happen to a Woman in 
the Wild West.

The western, like the old west itself, has never been a friendly place for the 
so-called fairer sex. While Hollywood was forging America’s origin myths in 
tales of gunslinging heroes imposing order on lawless chaos, womenfolk were 
usually shunted off to the sidelines. Their attitudes ranged from prim to 
spunky, but few would have scored high marks on the Bechdel test. Dee Brown, in
The Gentle Tamers: Women of the Old Wild West 
<http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530075.The_Gentle_Tamers>, assembled 
real-life accounts of actors, missionaries, barmaids, college graduates, 
pioneers and cross-dressers, any one of whose story would make a terrific basis 
for a movie (as, indeed, it did in Maggie Greenwald’s 1993 filmThe Ballad of 
Little Jo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflId5aJGN8>). But in the wild west 
of the movies, the woman’s role has invariably been reduced to that of madonna 
or whore.

 Taking a bullet for the hero: Marlene Dietrich with James Stewart in Destry 
Rides Again (1939). Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock 
On one hand there were virtuous wives and girlfriends like Henry Fonda’s love 
interest inMy Darling Clementine <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BTINCxmaOM> 
(1946), fragrant symbols of the domesticity awaiting survivors once the black 
hats had been defeated. On the other, they were saloon singers, which, inHays 
Code <http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/592022/> days, was code for 
prostitute; the nature of Claire Trevor’s occupation inStagecoach 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEuCMRRLts8> (1939) is never explicitly 
stated, but since she has been run out of town by the Law and Order League, 
it’s not hard to guess. Bad girls like My Darling Clementine’s Linda Darnell or 
Marlene Dietrich inDestry Rides Again 
<http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2cp8u5_destry-rides-again-1939-james-stewart-marlene-deitrich_shortfilms>
 (1939) would sometimes be allowed to redeem themselves by taking a bullet for 
the hero. Or the prostitute would find another kind of redemption as earth 
mother to the boys, like Claudia Cardinale inOnce Upon a Time In the West 
<http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2c770m_1968-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-henry-fonda-claudia-cardinale-jack-elam-charles-bronson-jason-roba_shortfilms>
 (1968). While the male characters are blasting holes in each other, 
Cardinale’s weapon is not a gun but sex. She’s so good at it that even Henry 
Fonda, who has no qualms about shooting a little kiddy in the head, is 
persuaded to let her live.

Jane Got a Gun review: big Nat, no cattle as Portman western fires blanks

So rare was it for women to pick up a gun that such an occurrence would be 
treated as an unexpected twist, as whenGrace Kelly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/grace-kelly> shucks off her Quakerhood to 
shoot the outlaw who has cornered her husband inHigh Noon  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/high-noon>(1952), or when William Holden gets 
plugged in the back inThe Wild Bunch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wild-bunch> (1969) by a nameless Mexican 
sex worker – who promptly gets called a bitch and gunned down for her trouble. 
Women with guns was the stuff of role reversal comedy, as inThe Paleface 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbRVX3LT_g4> (1948), where crackshot Calamity 
Jane (Jane Russell) goes undercover by marrying a dimwitted dentist (Bob Hope), 
or its sequelSon of Paleface <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HurGQ8ZnIy8> 
(1952), in which Russell plays a bandit who moonlights as a chanteuse.

 Breaking the mould: Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper in High Noon, 1952.

Calamity Jane, one of the Old West’s most celebrated female figures, has been 
played by a whole bevy of actresses, includingJean Arthur 
<http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2bds1d_1936-the-plainsman-gary-cooper-jean-arthur_shortfilms>
,Ellen Barkin <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114938/reference> and, most 
famously,Doris Day <https://www.theguardian.com/film/doris-day> in the 1953 
musical 
<http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1zagd1_calamity-jane-1953-full-movie_shortfilms>
, which sidelines the character’s boozing and fighting in favour of learning to 
be more feminine so she can devote herself to wholesome romance with Wild Bill 
Hickok. The real Calamity Jane’s life was so colourful it’s surely crying out 
for another movie, preferably one in which she is depicted more like Robin 
Weigert’s heavy-drinking, foulmouthed scout in the TV seriesDeadwood

Nor have films ever truly done justice to sharpshooter Annie Oakley, apart 
from one in which she played herself – Thomas Edison’sThe Little Sure Shot of 
the Wild West, an Exhibition of Rifle Shooting at Glass Balls etc 
<http://www.liquisearch.com/annie_oakley/the_little_sure_shot_of_the_wild_west> 
(1894). Oakley, who could shoot a cigar out of a man’s mouth, became a member 
of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show and once said: “I would like to see every 
woman know how to handle guns as naturally as they know how to handle babies.” 
Among the dozens of actresses who have played her wereBarbara Stanwyck 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026073/reference> and Geraldine Chaplin 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bill_and_the_Indians,_or_Sitting_Bull%27s_History_Lesson>
, but once again her most famous incarnation was in a musical,Annie Get Your Gun
 <https://www.google.co.uk/#q=annie+get+your+gun&tbm=vid> (1950), where she’s 
played by Betty Hutton, who took over when Judy Garland’s demons got the better 
of her.

 Gene Tierney as real-life gunslinger Belle Starr in the eponymous 1941 movie. 
Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock 
Belle Starr was another real-life female gunslinger who made it into the 
movies. She used to ride side-saddle in a black velvet riding habit with plumed 
hat and a pair of pistols, and hung out with the James-Younger gang before 
being shot in the back at the age of 41. On film, she has been played by Gene 
Tierney inBelle Starr 
<http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1z8jxx_belle-starr_shortfilms> (1941), which 
ditched any pretensions towards authenticity by having her fighting for the 
Southern cause (and marrying Sam Starr, in real life a Cherokee, but played, in 
an early instance of whitewashing, by Randolph Scott), Pamela Reed inThe Long 
Riders <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMwPIy4Ax4>(1980) and, most 
entertainingly if not very authentically, by Elsa Martinelli in Lina 
Wertmüller’sIl mio corpo per un poker 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ--rxVA9zs> (1968) AKA The Belle Starr Story, 
the only spaghetti western to have been directed by a woman.

 ‘May I feel your weapon?’ Barbara Stanwyck in Forty Guns, 1957. Photograph: 
Everett/Rex/Shutterstock 
Bona fide westerns in which female characters draw guns are still considered 
aberrations, albeit splendid ones such as Nicholas Ray’sJohnny Guitar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/88459/johnny-guitar> (1954), in which 
the bloke in the title plays second fiddle to Joan Crawford as imperious 
saloon-keeper Vienna, locked in a feud with vindictive rancher Mercedes 
McCambridge, even scarier here than as thevoice of Pazuzu in The Exorcist 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1kJYnLV1kE>. There’s a man involved, of 
course, but he’s no more than a pretext for the women’s rivalry, which packs 
Freudian subtext galore, starting, with the phallic symbolism of pistols. Or 
there’s landowner Barbara Stanwyck inForty Guns 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IPZoZ1vRR0>(1957), lording it over her 
all-male entourage until she takes an interest in the new marshal’s weapon and 
asks flirtatiously, “May I feel it?”

Stanwyck was something of a poster girl for tough female characters in the 
wild west, starring in the TV series The Big Valley as well as in a clutch of 
movie oaters, though inThe Furies <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-_lzFvL9oE> 
(1950), her weapon of choice is a pair of scissors. You were more likely to 
find female gunslingers in film noir (Peggy Cummins in 1950’sGun Crazy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78261/gun-crazy> is the ultimate 
sharpshooting femme fatale) than in westerns.

<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063970/reference> (1969), even if the film 
doesn’t balk at putting her in wet-shirt situations. Welch also packed 
firepower in the vulgar but energetic rape-revenge westernHannie Caulder

gunning for the villains who murdered her husband and gang-raped her, though

More recently, we’ve been treated to the sight of Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart 
Masterson,Andie MacDowell <https://www.theguardian.com/film/andie-macdowell> and
Drew Barrymore <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/drew-barrymore>, out of 
their element as girly prostitutes-turned-outlaws inBad Girls 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B28xW3dY0gg> (1994). More intriguing was 
Sharon Stone as “The Lady”, a mysterious Bronson-esque gunslinger in Sam 
Raimi’s spaghetti homageThe Quick and the Dead  
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114214/reference>(1995), though her thunder ended 
up being stolen byGene Hackman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gene-hackman>, 
firing on all cylinders as the bad guy. But I bet I’m not the only one who 
wouldn’t mind seeing a sequel toThe Salvation 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2720680/reference> (2014), starring Eva Green as a 
mute who lets her gun do the talking. Genre revisionism is always welcome, but 
the wild west and feminism don’t play well together, so it’s a shame Jane Got a 
Gun is more intent on tastefully ticking all the PC boxes than on serving up a 
ripping yarn. Let’s have more female gunslingers, by all means, but a touch 
more Hannie Caulder-type vulgarity wouldn’t go amiss now and again.
