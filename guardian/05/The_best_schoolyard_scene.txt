During their lunch break, high school students Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) and 
Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) discuss extra-curricular activities.

"I'm serious," exclaims aspiring model Angela. "He just pulled down his pants 
and yanked it out. Like 'Say hello to Mr Happy'". Jane looks nauseous.

"Gross." 

"It wasn't gross. It was kinda cool." 

"So, did you do it with him?" 

"Of course I did. He shoots for Elle on, like, a regular basis. It would have 
been so majorly stupid to turn him down."

"You are a total prostitute." 

"Hey, that's how things really are!" rages Angela. "You just don't know 
because you're this pampered little suburban chick."

"So are you!" Jane spits. " You've only been in Seventeen once! And you looked 
fat !"

Anglea pouts bitterly. 

"I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me." 

Suddenly, Jane's neighbour Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) appears in the distance. 

"Oh my God," Jane whispers, "that's the pervert who filmed me last night." 

"Him? No way, he's a total lunatic. We were in the same lunch shift in ninth 
grade. And he would always say the most random, weird things. And then one day 
he was just, like, gone. Connie Cardule told me his parents put him in a mental 
institution."

"Why? They can't put you away just for saying weird things." 

"You little slut! You've got a crush on him!"
