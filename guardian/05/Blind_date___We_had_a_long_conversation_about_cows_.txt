Jen on Jeremy 


What were you hoping for?
Someone who was a laugh.

First impressions?
That he bore a faint resemblance to Elijah Wood 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704/>.

What did you talk about?
My proximity to the Arsenal stadium, his course on how to cook Christmas 
dinner on a BBQ, and our respective niece and nephew. It was great to show 
someone pictures of my nephew, as my friends are running out of interest.

Any awkward moments?
I arrived first and when Jeremy arrived, he was seated at the table next to 
me. I started to think he wasn’t going to show.

Good table manners? 
Excellent.

Best thing about Jeremy?
He was easy to talk to and had lived in New Zealand, where I’m from.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
Yes, he would get along with some of the cricket-lovers.

Describe him in three words
Kind, funny, enthusiastic.

What do you think he made of you?
Confident and a bit scatty.

Did you go on somewhere?
Only to the station.

And… did you kiss?
No, a hug goodbye was it.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
We wouldn’t have had a long conversation about cows and how to round them up.

Marks out of 10?
6.5.

Would you meet again?
No.

What were you hoping for? 
To meet a fun, outgoing person.

First impressions? 
Delighted I hadn’t been stood up, then impressed.

What did you talk about?

Any awkward moments? 
We sat at separate tables for 10 minutes before realising.

Good table manners? 
Impeccable.

Best thing about Jen? 
She’s an easy-going Kiwi.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
Why not?

We’d have ordered the chocolate tart.
