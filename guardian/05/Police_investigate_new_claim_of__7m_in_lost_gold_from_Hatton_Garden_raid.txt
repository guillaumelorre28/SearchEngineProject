Scotland Yard is looking into a claim that the haul from Britain’s biggest 
burglary, the Hatton Garden raid, was 50% more than was previously thought 
after a woman said she had lost £7m of gold in the heist.

It was originally estimated that £14m of valuables, including gold, diamonds 
and sapphires, were taken from a vault in theLondon

over the 2015 Easter weekend. Two-thirds of haul remains unrecovered.

A woman has, however, come forward to claim that £7m worth of gold was also 
stolen from her safety deposit box during the raid, according to Sky News.

Six members of the gang, including the 77-year-old ringleader, Brian Reader

, were jailed for up to seven years for their part in the heist last year.

The woman, whom Sky did not identify, came forward after the end of the trial 
of the men at Woolwich crown court.


The Metropolitan police said in a statement: “In June 2016, police received an 
allegation of theft from a security box relating to the Hatton Garden burglary 
in April, 2015. The victim is alleging the loss of a substantial amount of 
property. The investigation is ongoing.”

Analysts have claimed that the amount stolen was likely to be more than the 
£14m estimated by the Met. After the raid, Scotland Yard said it had contacted 
all 72 people who held boxes in the vault, apart from one individual who had 
subsequently died.

If the report turns out to be genuine, those convicted could face an extension 
to their jail sentences.
