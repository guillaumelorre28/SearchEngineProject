Fears that the imminent arrival of Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in the White House could 
force hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants back into the shadows 
have already started to materialize, as young Hispanics are giving up hope of 
acquiring legal status just days after the presidential election.

Immigration lawyers are advising undocumented youths, known as “Dreamers”, to 
stop applying for temporary work permits under a program introduced byBarack 
Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> on the grounds that it 
could expose them to potential deportation once Trump is in power. The 
president-elect has plans to scrap the scheme, known as Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals (Daca), as one of his first acts in office.

The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) is now giving standard guidance 
<https://www.nilc.org/issues/daca/> to all Dreamers that “if you do not 
currently have Daca and are considering whether to apply for it for the first 
time, we recommend that you NOT do so at this time”.

The evidence that undocumented young people are already turning away from the 
legal status program is the first sign that Trump’s victory has begun to push 
people into forms of hiding. It is also the first sign that Obama’s legacy, 
built partly around his attempt to bring the Dreamers into the light, has 
rapidly started to unravel.

‘We learned to fight back’: Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video>
Obama has 
<http://thehill.com/latino/305957-obama-trump-should-think-long-and-hard-before-deporting-those-protected-by-daca>
 urged <> Trump to “think long and hard” before making any move to deport the 
Daca Dreamers. He said this week that the hundreds of thousands of young people 
protected by the program were “for all practical purposes American kids”.

Shiu-Ming Cheer, a senior staff attorney with the NILC, said the organization 
was determined to do everything it could to keep the Daca program alive but had 
been forced into the ignominious position of advising young people not to make 
any new applications. “It feels like the reverse of what we want to be doing, 
as we have spent years asking people to apply for legal status, and now we are 
asking them not to. That doesn’t feel good to us.”

Cheer added: “But at the moment there are so many fears that we prefer to be 
overly cautious rather than to see anybody put themselves at risk of 
deportation.”

The US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) says that there are 
currently 741,546 Dreamers on thelist of people 
<https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_performancedata_fy2016_qtr3.pdf>
 who have been granted an initial Daca status, having been brought to this 
country by their parents when they were young children. To take part in the 
scheme, they must be at least15 years old 
<https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca>
 and have been in the US since 2007, and once approved they are allowed openly 
to get a job and have a two-year guarantee that they will not be deported.

Dreamers have been applying under the scheme this year at about the rate of 
7,000 a month. That number is now expected to dwindle dramatically as fear 
about Trump’s plans spreads.

Anthony Galindo, 20, is one of the Dreamers who has now decided to pull back 
from asking for Daca status. A sociology student at the East Los Angeles 
College, he was brought to the US from Guatemala by his mother when he was only 
14 months old.

He had decided to put in for legal status under Daca before the election 
partly out of fear of a Trump presidency, and partly because without work 
permits his opportunities in employment and as a student were limited. But he 
scrapped the idea, having received legal advice that applying for the scheme 
could backfire on him and could leave him highly susceptible to deportation.

In the worst case scenario, people could be identified by the Daca application 
and picked up for deportation
Shiu-Ming Cheer, a senior immigration attorney 
“Trump has said that he will deport people who have criminal records. But 
being here ‘illegally’ in the US is already considered a crime,” Galindo said.

Obama introduced the Daca program in 2012, but did so as an executive order 
without the approval of Congress. That leaves the scheme vulnerable to the axe, 
as Trump has vowed to scrap all his predecessor’s executive orders within a 
matter of days of his inauguration on 20 January.

One of the great concerns about Daca is that anyone applying for it has to 
hand over personal data, including home addresses, details of schools attended, 
how long they have been in the country, and other telling information. Often 
the applications mark the first occasion that the person has ever had any 
contact with the federal government.

Daca applications are currently taking on average more than six months to 
process, meaning that anyone who puts in for it today is not likely to be 
successful before Trump takes up residency in the Oval Office. If he scraps the 
scheme, as expected, within his first 100 days, then there is also the 
possibility that the data that has been handed over will be used to round up 
individuals.

3 million ‘criminal’ immigrants to be deported, says Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/14/3-million-criminal-immigrants-deported-donald-trump-video>
“In the worst-case scenario, people could be identified by the Daca 
application they made and then the Department of Homeland Security could use 
their home addresses to go and pick them up for deportation,” Cheer said.

Greg Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers 
Association (AILA), said his organization was also concerned for people who 
have already applied to Daca or are considering doing it for the first time. 
“Since Donald Trump has stated that he will rescind the Daca initiative, 
anybody who has not been granted deferred action by 20 January may never get 
that granted.”

 of Daca have shown that the young participants make a large positive 
contribution to the economy. They tend to buy new cars and first homes, as well 
as securing better jobs through which they pay higher taxes and other revenue 
to state and federal coffers.

Galindo said that young Dreamers like him would have to organize and protest 
to be heard. “Daca happened because of the pressure of Dreamers, and now we’ll 
have to fight again to keep our hopes alive.”
