Nearly 24 hours after a Bastille Day celebration was transformed into a 
nightmare, “locals and visitors returned to the Promenade des Anglais to lay 
flowers for the dead and to wonder exactly how, and why, the unthinkable had 
come to pass,” my colleague Sam Jones reports from the city.

Throughout Friday, impromptu shrines had sprung up along the metal barriers 
that closed off the promenade. From one hung a tricolor with a black ribbon 
sewn on to the white central stripe. At another, a picture of Buddha watched 
over a dozen small candles. Someone had left a cigarette lighter and more 
nightlights on the ground so others could light candles and offer prayers.

Madame Bourmault, who lives two minutes from the promenade, came to one of the 
shrines with a bunch of flowers in her hand and tears in her eyes.

“I can’t sleep and I can’t breathe. It’s just horrible,” she said. 

“What else can you say?” She had been down by the firework display on Thursday 
night, and seen a sudden tide of people screaming and running away. “In a 
fraction of a second, the music stopped and there was a lot of screaming. 
Everyone was running and no one was helping.”

On Bormault’s mind was a question that many around the world are asking: how 
had the truck managed to get on to the promenade? “It’s normally closed to 
traffic,” she said. However, she did not blame the police. “I don’t know what 
else the police could have done, but I don’t understand how the truck got in.”

She added: “You can’t put a policeman behind everyone - and there area lot of 
crazy people in this world.”

Leila Pasini, an Italian tourist from Milan on holiday in Nice, had been on 
the promenade before the attack but had returned to the flat where she was 
staying to make sure her dog was OK.

“We left just before the truck came and then I looked out of the window and 
saw a river of people running and crying. It looked like the apocalypse but I 
didn’t know what was going on.”

Pasini said she had heard that the truck had been close to the promenade for a 
long time and that the driver had explained that he was delivering ice.

“I don’t know whether that’s true or not,” she said. “But if it is true, then 
that’s very serious. Why would a truck be there for so long?”

By nine o’clock last night, life on the Rue de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>, which runs close to the promenade, 
was slowly returning to normal. A few hundred yards from the scene of the 
atrocity, people walked their dogs and sat eating on restaurant terraces. Past 
them walked couples carrying flowers and clutching each other’s hands tightly.

Ita Murray and her friend Jackie Ellis, had arrived in Nice from London a few 
hours before the attack. They had intended to go and watch the fireworks but 
the day’s traveling had got the better of them and they chose to stay on their 
balcony.

“About 11, we saw all these youngsters running and screaming,” said Murray. 
“They were tearing around and we thought it was a prank.”

It wasn’t until nine on Friday morning, when they were awoken by phone calls 
from their anxious families, that they understood what all the shouting and 
running had been about. And that their fatigue had been a blessing.

“We were just too tired,” said Ellis. “Otherwise we would have been up
there because there’s always something going on.”

What we know

 * Eighty-four people, including 10 children, were killed on Thursday night 
when a 31-year-old French Tunisian attacked Bastille Day celebrations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/nice-attack-leaves-84-dead-and-france-in-shock>
 in Nice by speeding a truck for 2km (about 1 mile) along the crowded promenade.
 * Two hundred and two people were injured and 52 people remain in critical 
care, 25 on life support, French prosecutor François Molins said. Three or four 
children are in extremely critical condition, a doctor told the Guardian. The 
dead includetwo Americans, a Russian student

 anda motorcyclist  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/motorcycle-hero-tried-to-board-truck-used-in-bastille-day-attack>
who tried to board the truck to stop the driver. 
 * President François Hollande called the attack “terrorism of opportunity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/francois-hollande-faces-political-backlash-nice-attack>
” at a 4am address, and announced three days of mourning and an extended 
national emergency. He now faces political backlash over the country’s
struggling security services 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/why-does-france-keep-getting-attacked>
.

 * The attacker was named as Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/bastille-day-truck-driver-was-known-to-police-reports-say>
, a chauffeur and deliveryman who was born in Tunis but had lived in France for 
years. Three police officers exchanged fire with Lahouaiej-Bouhlel during his 
rampage, and found him dead in the passenger seat of the truck, Molins said.

 * Police found two automatic weapons, ammunition, a mobile phone and 
documents in the truck, the prosecutor said. They also found fake weapons in 
the vehicle and more documents at Lahouaiej-Bouhlel’s residence. 
 * Lahouaiej-Bouhlel had a history of threats, violence and petty theft, 
Molins said, dating from 2010 to 2016, and had been sentenced in March to 
six-months in prison for a road rage incident. 
 * But he was “totally unknown” to French counter-terrorism agencies, Molins 
said, and so far authorities have not found links to terror groups or evidence 
of radicalization. Prime minister Manuel Valls said that he “probably” had some 
a link to extremism, but admitted the investigation has no evidence at this 
point. 
 * Police have taken the gunman’s ex-wife in for questioning; 
Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was a father of three. Molins said they are also 
investigating whether he acted alone or had accomplices. 
 * No terror group has taken credit for the attack, though certain elements 
mirror recent attacks by the Islamic State (Isis) and its sympathizers. 
 * Embassies and French authorities have urged concerned relatives to call for 
information,as worried loved ones wait for news 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/baby-lost-in-france-truck-attack-chaos-tracked-down-via-facebook>
 amid horrifying witness accounts of the attack. 
 * Barack Obama called for unity around the world in the wake of the Nice 
attack, and rejected calls to target Muslims or minority groups. “We cannot let 
ourselves be divided by religion because that’s exactly what the terrorists 
want.,” he said. “We should never do their work for them.”

In Nice, the day ends with tension – an altercation and reported arrest at a 
vigil – and a surreal calm over the sea.

Buzzfeed’s Ryan Broderick reported that the crowd at a vigil in Nice angrily 
rallied to stop a man who disrupted the event.

Obama: nations must guard against bigotry

Obamas continues with his call to unity: “we cannot give in to fear or turn on 
each either.”

“We cannot let ourselves be divided by religion because that’s exactly what 
the terrorists want. We should never do their work for them.”

“We have to be vigilant to defend our security and our freedoms,” he 
continues. “And all of us, whatever nations we represent here, I think have to 
step back and reflect on what we’re doing to eliminate this kind of chronic 
violence.”

Obama then draws the violence in France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> to the recent shootings in the 
United States: five police officers killed in Dallas last Friday and two black 
men killed by police in the days before that shooting.

“It’s been a difficult several weeks here in the Untied States, but the divide 
that exists is not between races and ethnicities and religion. It is between 
people that recognize the common humanity of all people, and are willing to 
build institutions that promote that common humanity, and those who do not.

“Those who would suggest that somebody is less than them because of their 
tribe or their ethnicity or their color. And those impulses exist in all our 
countries. And those impulses, when we do not speak out against them and build 
strong institutions to protect them from those impulses, they can take over. 
They can be unleashed. …

“Even as we are relentless against terrorists, it’s also worthy for us to 
recognize that our nations have worked together for security and peace and 
human dignity around the world.”

The president concludes his remarks by hailing the work of diplomacy, and the 
common good created inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
and Latin America through it: “What a contrast to the death and nihilism that 
terrorists offer.”

Obama: calls to target Muslims are 'repugnant'

President Barack Obama is addressing the attack in Nice, saying Americans and 
their allies cannot do terrorists’ “work for them” by targeting people for race 
or religion.

He says he called president François Hollande to offer the US’s full support.

“I know I speak for all of us when I say that these individuals and these 
networks are an affront to all our humanity,” Obama says. He notes that the 
attack in Nice killed “people of all faiths, including Muslims”.

“We will not be deterred. We will not relent. We are going to keep taking out 
Isil,” he continues. “We are going to destroy this vile terrorist organization.”

“And in contrast to these terrorist who only know how to kill and destroy, 
we’re going to build this fight buy building, by never giving up on diplomacy, 
by working with partners around the world, including Muslim communities.”

He says that Islam is “a religion that teaches peace and justice and 
compassion”.

“We will continue to promote political opportunity and democracy so citizens 
have a say in their future,” he says.

”We will in this fight by staying true to our values, of pluralism and rule of 
law and diversity and freedoms, like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech 
and assembly, the very freedoms that the people of Nice were celebrating last 
night on Bastille Day.”

“On the wake of last night’s attack we’ve heard more suggestions that Muslims 
in America” be targeted for tests, exclusion and even expulsion, he says, 
alluding to the calls from Republican Donald Trump and his allies.

“The very suggestion is repugnant and an affront to everything that we stand 
for as Americans.” Obama says.

French PM: 'probable' but no confirmed terror link

French prime minister Manuel Valls has said that although he cannot confirm 
the attacker’s motives, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel “is a terrorist probably 
linked to radical Islam one way or another”.

Still, the prime minister told France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> 2 he had no doubt that the crime was 
terrorism. “It is a terrorist act and we shall see what the links there are 
with terrorist organizations.”

He added that the death toll will probably increase – at last count 52 people 
remained in critical care, including 25 people on life support. Authorities 
have so far counted 202 people injured in all.

Valls added a warning that more attacks could follow Lahouaiej-Bouhlel’s 
example, but that France would not be deterred:“I am convinced we will win the 
war against terrorism and radical Islam.”

Far more cautious was French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who told 
broadcaster TF1 that broadcaster TF1 was “not known to intelligence services 
for activities linked to radical Islam”.

Asked whether he could confirm the a link to jihadism, he said: “No”.

7.11pm BST 19:11  <> 

Neighbors of Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel have described the killer as a 
“frightening man” who kept to himself but showed no signs of radicalization, 
Reuters reports.

While a history of threats, violence and theft had caused him several run-ins 
with the law previously, Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Nice resident born in Tunisia, 
was not on a watch list of French intelligence services as a suspected militant.

He was convicted for the first time in March this year, French justice 
minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas said. “There was an altercation between him and 
another driver and he hurled a wooden pallet at the man,” Urvoas told reporters.

As it was his first conviction, Bouhlel was given a six-month suspended 
sentence and had to contact police once a week, which he did, Urvoas added. He 
had three children but lived separately from his wife who was taken into police 
custody on Friday, prosecutor Francois Molins said.

Tunisian security sources told Reuters Bouhlel had last visited M’saken four 
years ago. They also said they were not aware of Bouhlel holding radical or 
Islamist views, saying he had a French residence permit for the past 10 years 
without obtaining French nationality.

Neighbours in the residential neighbourhood in northern Nice where Bouhlel 
lived said he had a tense personality and did not mingle with others. “I would 
say he was someone who was pleasing to women,” said neighbour Hanan, standing 
in the lobby of the apartment building where Bouhlel lived. “But he was 
frightening. He didn’t have a frightening face, but ... a look. He would stare 
at the children a lot,” he added.

A former neighbour in Bouhlel’s hometown of M’saken, about 120km (75 miles) 
south of Tunis, told Reuters he had left forFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> in 2005, after getting married, and 
had worked as a driver there.

His home town of M’saken is about 10 km (six miles) outside the coastal city 
of Sousse, where a gunman killed 38 people, mostly British holidaymakers, on a 
beach a year ago.

Relatives and neighbours in Msaken said Bouhlel was sporty and had shown no 
sign of being radicalised, including when he last returned for the wedding of a 
sister four years ago.

Bouhlel’s brother Jabeur said he still doubted whether his sibling was the 
attacker. “Why would my brother do something like this?” he told Reuters, 
adding: “We’ve been calling him since yesterday evening but he’s not 
responding.”

Earnest says the US will give the “strongest support” to France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> and the investigation into the 
attack.

“There are significant capabilities that we have to support them and obviously 
we will assist them,” he says.

A reporter asks about whether recent terror attacks outside the Middle East 
have at all changed the White House’s thinking about its strategy in the region 
– secretary of state John Kerry called Syria the world’s greatest “incubator” 
for terror earlier this week.

Earnest says the calculus has not changed.

“The ultimate solution is not a military one. We can certainly apply 
significant military pressure and commit significant military resources,” he 
says, “but the root cause of all of this has been the failed political 
leadership of Bashar al-Assad.”

The attack is only going “to energize” international military campaigns 
against terrorism, he adds. Earnest again qualifies that very little is known 
about what motivated the killer in Nice.

“Whether or not this person had ties to Isil, the president is committed to 
making sure we do everything possible to protect the American people.”

Earnest stresses the dangers of “lone wolf” attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/12/florida-gunman-omar-mateen-fbi-lone-wolf>
, saying “the threat we are facing now is different from core al-Qaida”.

“The president has essentially declared that the US is ‘at war’ with terrorist 
organizations such as Isil.”

But Earnest stresses that the White House does not consider the US at odds 
with any religion or civilization. “We are not at war with Islam, we are at war 
with a terrorist organization that attacked us, that perverts Islam to try to 
win recruitment to its cause.”

He’s again asked about people who are radicalized online, as “it’s very 
difficult to interrupt, to disrupt, attacks that are plotted and acted by just 
one person.

“There’s a whole lot more that we need to learn about this incident,” he says.

Earnest: "We're mindful of the risk that is posed by a so-called lone wolf." 
Doesn't necessarily have links to a terrorist organisation.

The White House spokesman continues to argue that European nations must 
improve their intelligence sharing and security agencies – although French 
police have not yet found signs of radicalization in the Nice attack.

“Just to speak bluntly about this, the previous attacks in Paris in November, 
I think illustrated this vulnerability best,” Earnest says. “The plotters of 
the attack were in Belgium but the attack was inFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>.”

He says this “indicates the cross-border nature of this threat”.

Earnest then argues that it’s actually because the US and its allies are 
winning territory away from Isis in Syria and Iraq that terror attacks have 
increased outside the Middle East.

“There are some in the White House who are aware of the risks involved in the 
progress against Isil,” he says, using another name for Islamic State. “We know 
that there is some evolution in the direction that Isil is giving to potential 
recruits.”

“In some cases aren’t even directed by Isil but rather are radicalized by 
viewing their propaganda online.”


He admits: “I can’t speak to the Nice case” because it’s too soon to know what 
motivated the killer.
David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) 
Earnest: It's more of a significant threat now, according to some analysts, 
because of the progress that is being made.

White House: Europe must improve security

White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that Barack Obama has called François 
Hollande to “relay his condolences to the people ofFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> on behalf of the American people”.

He adds that “the United States and France have made important progress in 
enhancing our security relationship” in the last year.

He says the secretary of defense and the office of the director of national 
intelligence succeeded in working with the French to create a better 
“information-sharing relationship”.

The president’s top national security adviser, Lisa Monaco, traveled to France 
and also worked on a new security deal with her counterpart. Earnest does not 
get into specifics, saying simple that the arrangement will help identify 
threats and prevent attacks.

“There is certain expertise that the United States has,” he says, and the 
secretary of homeland security, Jeh Johnson, has shared some of those 
techniques with French counterparts.

“Information sharing among European countries needs to be enhanced,” he goes 
on, arguing that this will in turn improve US security.

A reporter asks him about whether Obama believes the US is at war with 
terrorism. Earnest says that the president has long said that terrorists 
declared war on the US with the attack of September 11 2001.

“We’ve been at war ever since,” Earnest says. “And we’ve made progress.” 

He says that the deaths of top al-Qaida leaders and the recent retreats of 
Isis are evidence that the US and western nations are succeeding against 
terrorism. Then he turns it to Congress, which has not yet passed a resolution 
– though not a declaration of war – that would sanction increased military 
action against Isis and other groups.

“This is the worst possible time for leaders or American leaders to suggest 
that Americans should start turning on each other. That’s exactly what the 
terrorists want us to do.”

David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) 
Earnest: "We're still waiting on Congress to pass a resolution to authorise 
the use of military force against Isil."

Hours after the attack, parents were still looking for their children at the 
hospital in Nice’s Promenade des Anglais on Friday afternoon, my colleague 
Angelique Chrisafis reports from the city.

The worst thing was the sheer number of children coming in, the nature of 
their injuries – serious head trauma and broken limbs – and the emotion felt by 
the children and their families,” said Frederic Sola, a paediatric orthopaedic 
surgeon who worked in the hospital emergency room through the night. “The 
children were physically very injured but also emotionally very hurt.”

Some relatives were in such shock they were unable to talk. “The psychologists 
have heard terrible things, there are awful stories that children are telling,” 
said Stéphanie Simpson, head of the hospital’s communications team.

She said 39 people hit in the attacks had been brought to the children’s 
emergency department. A total of 30 children were treated at the hospital after 
the attack – the youngest only a few months old and the oldest was 18. Two 
children died in the night after being admitted. Several children were still in 
intensive care on Friday.

The emotion on the Fondation Lenval emergency ward was heightened by the fact 
that the six-storey children’s hospital – with its vast airy atrium, kite 
mosaic, and teddy bear frescoes on a corridor wall – is located right on the 
promenade where the attack took place. The suspect, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, 
had passed the hospital as he set out to drive at high speed into the crowd of 
Bastille Day revellers.

“It happened so close to the hospital that the emotion is very strong,” said 
Simpson. She herself had been at the fireworks display with her 10-year-old son 
and had posted pictures on Facebook of him grinning in front of blue and red 
fireworks exploding in the sky 20 minutes before the attack.

She left 15 minutes before the truck struck because she had spotted a drop of 
rain falling on her phone while she was taking the photos, and felt it was 
getting a bit chilly. “There were so many families there – children and 
grandparents – and many of them had been picnicking on the beach,” she said.

Barack Obama has ordered the White House and all public buildings and military 
stations to fly the flag at half-staff in respect of the Nice victims, as 
people aroundFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> plan vigils in 
mourning of the dead.

The AP reports on those plans, and on families’ efforts to find survivors.

Different parts of France have planned vigils and rallies in mourning at the 
scores who lost their lives and defiance against the driver who took them.

Avignon mayor Cécile Helle is calling for a large rally Friday in front of the 
city hall, with other smaller gatherings and vigils planned the same day and 
over the weekend in towns such as Poitiers, Le Creusot and Pau.

With some people still searching for news of their loved ones after the Nice 
truck attack, a Facebook site called “SOS Nice” has begun to attract posts from 
people hoping to be reunited with missing family members.

The site was quickly filling up with photos, appeals and in some cases good 
news.

Nearly 24 hours after a Bastille Day celebration was transformed into a 
nightmare, “locals and visitors returned to the Promenade des Anglais to lay 
flowers for the dead and to wonder exactly how, and why, the unthinkable had 
come to pass,” my colleague Sam Jones reports from the city.

Throughout Friday, impromptu shrines had sprung up along the metal barriers 
that closed off the promenade. From one hung a tricolor with a black ribbon 
sewn on to the white central stripe. At another, a picture of Buddha watched 
over a dozen small candles. Someone had left a cigarette lighter and more 
nightlights on the ground so others could light candles and offer prayers.

Madame Bourmault, who lives two minutes from the promenade, came to one of the 
shrines with a bunch of flowers in her hand and tears in her eyes.

“I can’t sleep and I can’t breathe. It’s just horrible,” she said. 

“What else can you say?” She had been down by the firework display on Thursday 
night, and seen a sudden tide of people screaming and running away. “In a 
fraction of a second, the music stopped and there was a lot of screaming. 
Everyone was running and no one was helping.”

On Bormault’s mind was a question that many around the world are asking: how 
had the truck managed to get on to the promenade? “It’s normally closed to 
traffic,” she said. However, she did not blame the police. “I don’t know what 
else the police could have done, but I don’t understand how the truck got in.”

She added: “You can’t put a policeman behind everyone - and there area lot of 
crazy people in this world.”

Leila Pasini, an Italian tourist from Milan on holiday in Nice, had been on 
the promenade before the attack but had returned to the flat where she was 
staying to make sure her dog was OK.

“We left just before the truck came and then I looked out of the window and 
saw a river of people running and crying. It looked like the apocalypse but I 
didn’t know what was going on.”

Pasini said she had heard that the truck had been close to the promenade for a 
long time and that the driver had explained that he was delivering ice.

“I don’t know whether that’s true or not,” she said. “But if it is true, then 
that’s very serious. Why would a truck be there for so long?”

By nine o’clock last night, life on the Rue de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>, which runs close to the promenade, 
was slowly returning to normal. A few hundred yards from the scene of the 
atrocity, people walked their dogs and sat eating on restaurant terraces. Past 
them walked couples carrying flowers and clutching each other’s hands tightly.

Ita Murray and her friend Jackie Ellis, had arrived in Nice from London a few 
hours before the attack. They had intended to go and watch the fireworks but 
the day’s traveling had got the better of them and they chose to stay on their 
balcony.

“About 11, we saw all these youngsters running and screaming,” said Murray. 
“They were tearing around and we thought it was a prank.”

It wasn’t until nine on Friday morning, when they were awoken by phone calls 
from their anxious families, that they understood what all the shouting and 
running had been about. And that their fatigue had been a blessing.

“We were just too tired,” said Ellis. “Otherwise we would have been up
there because there’s always something going on.”

 * The attacker was named as Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/bastille-day-truck-driver-was-known-to-police-reports-say>
, a chauffeur and deliveryman who was born in Tunis but had lived in France for 
years. Three police officers exchanged fire with Lahouaiej-Bouhlel during his 
rampage, and found him dead in the passenger seat of the truck, Molins said.

 * Police found two automatic weapons, ammunition, a mobile phone and 
documents in the truck, the prosecutor said. They also found fake weapons in 
the vehicle and more documents at Lahouaiej-Bouhlel’s residence. 
 * Lahouaiej-Bouhlel had a history of threats, violence and petty theft, 
Molins said, dating from 2010 to 2016, and had been sentenced in March to 
six-months in prison for a road rage incident. 
 * But he was “totally unknown” to French counter-terrorism agencies, Molins 
said, and so far authorities have not found links to terror groups or evidence 
of radicalization. Prime minister Manuel Valls said that he “probably” had some 
a link to extremism, but admitted the investigation has no evidence at this 
point. 
 * Police have taken the gunman’s ex-wife in for questioning; 
Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was a father of three. Molins said they are also 
investigating whether he acted alone or had accomplices. 
 * No terror group has taken credit for the attack, though certain elements 
mirror recent attacks by the Islamic State (Isis) and its sympathizers.

In Nice, the day ends with tension – an altercation and reported arrest at a 
vigil – and a surreal calm over the sea.

Buzzfeed’s Ryan Broderick reported that the crowd at a vigil in Nice angrily 
rallied to stop a man who disrupted the event.

Authorities have identified the nationalities of more victims, though not all 
of their names, as officials continue to contact families around the world.


French authorities and families have identified four victims. Parisian Timothe 
Fournier, 27, died after pushing his pregnant wife out of the truck’ path, his 
cousin Anais told AFP. “He was a great guy,” she said, “a young dreamer but 
someone who was always there for his wife and his future child.”

Also killed were 28-year-old economics teacher Michael Pellegrini, 60-year-old 
athletics club president Robert Marchand, and 45-year-old police commissioner 
Emmanuel Grout, 45, who was off duty and watching the fireworks, according to 
local media.

Two Americans were killed, and family identified them as Sean Copeland, 51, 
and his 11-year-old son Brodie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/nice-victims-brodie-sean-copeland-texas>
. They were with their family in Nice on vacation from Lakeway, Texas.

A student from the University of California, Berkeley, remains missing, the 
school has said in a statement. Three other students were wounded.

The missing student is 20-year-old Nicolas Leslie, one of 85 students on a 
two-week trip to study abroad inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. The university said that two 
other students had broken legs and a third had a broken foot.

Two Swiss citizens, a woman and a child, were killed, according to the foreign 
ministry in Geneva. The mayor of the town of Agno named the woman as Linda 
Casanova Siccardi, a 54-year-old customs agent, who was traveling with her 
husband.

A German teacher and two of her students from Berlin’s Paula-Fuerst School 
were killed, according to the city’s mayor.

Three Tunisians were killed, including Olfa Bent Souayah, the mother of a 
four-year-old boy who remains missing, according to the country’s foreign 
ministry. Officials there also said that two men, Bilal Labaoui and mechanic 
Abdelkader Toukabri, were killed.

Two Algerian children and a 70-year-old woman were killed, according to a 
foreign ministry spokesperson, and a 60-year-old Moroccan named Fatima Charrihi 
was killed, according to her son Hamza. He told local media that she was a 
devout Muslim who practiced “real Islam, not that of the terrorists”.

One Russian student, 21-year-old Victoria Savchenko, was killed, according to 
the foreign ministry in Moscow. Savchenko was on vacatino with a friend, who 
was injured but not in serious condition. A Ukrainian national was also killed, 
according to foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin.

Obamas continues with his call to unity: “we cannot give in to fear or turn on 
each either.”

“We cannot let ourselves be divided by religion because that’s exactly what 
the terrorists want. We should never do their work for them.”

“We have to be vigilant to defend our security and our freedoms,” he 
continues. “And all of us, whatever nations we represent here, I think have to 
step back and reflect on what we’re doing to eliminate this kind of chronic 
violence.”

Obama then draws the violence in France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> to the recent shootings in the 
United States: five police officers killed in Dallas last Friday and two black 
men killed by police in the days before that shooting.

“It’s been a difficult several weeks here in the Untied States, but the divide 
that exists is not between races and ethnicities and religion. It is between 
people that recognize the common humanity of all people, and are willing to 
build institutions that promote that common humanity, and those who do not.

“Those who would suggest that somebody is less than them because of their 
tribe or their ethnicity or their color. And those impulses exist in all our 
countries. And those impulses, when we do not speak out against them and build 
strong institutions to protect them from those impulses, they can take over. 
They can be unleashed. …

“Even as we are relentless against terrorists, it’s also worthy for us to 
recognize that our nations have worked together for security and peace and 
human dignity around the world.”

The president concludes his remarks by hailing the work of diplomacy, and the 
common good created inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
and Latin America through it: “What a contrast to the death and nihilism that 
terrorists offer.”
 
President Barack Obama is addressing the attack in Nice, saying Americans and 
their allies cannot do terrorists’ “work for them” by targeting people for race 
or religion.

He says he called president François Hollande to offer the US’s full support.

“I know I speak for all of us when I say that these individuals and these 
networks are an affront to all our humanity,” Obama says. He notes that the 
attack in Nice killed “people of all faiths, including Muslims”.

“We will not be deterred. We will not relent. We are going to keep taking out 
Isil,” he continues. “We are going to destroy this vile terrorist organization.”

“And in contrast to these terrorist who only know how to kill and destroy, 
we’re going to build this fight buy building, by never giving up on diplomacy, 
by working with partners around the world, including Muslim communities.”

He says that Islam is “a religion that teaches peace and justice and 
compassion”.

“We will continue to promote political opportunity and democracy so citizens 
have a say in their future,” he says.

”We will in this fight by staying true to our values, of pluralism and rule of 
law and diversity and freedoms, like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech 
and assembly, the very freedoms that the people of Nice were celebrating last 
night on Bastille Day.”

“On the wake of last night’s attack we’ve heard more suggestions that Muslims 
in America” be targeted for tests, exclusion and even expulsion, he says, 
alluding to the calls from Republican Donald Trump and his allies.

“The very suggestion is repugnant and an affront to everything that we stand 
for as Americans.” Obama says.
 
French prime minister Manuel Valls has said that although he cannot confirm 
the attacker’s motives, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel “is a terrorist probably 
linked to radical Islam one way or another”.
 Valls. Photograph: Nicolas Kovarik/IP3/Getty Images 
Still, the prime minister told France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> 2 he had no doubt that the crime was 
terrorism. “It is a terrorist act and we shall see what the links there are 
with terrorist organizations.”

He added that the death toll will probably increase – at last count 52 people 
remained in critical care, including 25 people on life support. Authorities 
have so far counted 202 people injured in all.

Valls added a warning that more attacks could follow Lahouaiej-Bouhlel’s 
example, but that France would not be deterred:“I am convinced we will win the 
war against terrorism and radical Islam.”

Far more cautious was French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who told 
broadcaster TF1 that broadcaster TF1 was “not known to intelligence services 
for activities linked to radical Islam”.

Asked whether he could confirm the a link to jihadism, he said: “No”. 
 
Neighbors of Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel have described the killer as a 
“frightening man” who kept to himself but showed no signs of radicalization, 
Reuters reports.

While a history of threats, violence and theft had caused him several run-ins 
with the law previously, Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Nice resident born in Tunisia, 
was not on a watch list of French intelligence services as a suspected militant.

He was convicted for the first time in March this year, French justice 
minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas said. “There was an altercation between him and 
another driver and he hurled a wooden pallet at the man,” Urvoas told reporters.

As it was his first conviction, Bouhlel was given a six-month suspended 
sentence and had to contact police once a week, which he did, Urvoas added. He 
had three children but lived separately from his wife who was taken into police 
custody on Friday, prosecutor Francois Molins said.

Tunisian security sources told Reuters Bouhlel had last visited M’saken four 
years ago. They also said they were not aware of Bouhlel holding radical or 
Islamist views, saying he had a French residence permit for the past 10 years 
without obtaining French nationality.

Neighbours in the residential neighbourhood in northern Nice where Bouhlel 
lived said he had a tense personality and did not mingle with others. “I would 
say he was someone who was pleasing to women,” said neighbour Hanan, standing 
in the lobby of the apartment building where Bouhlel lived. “But he was 
frightening. He didn’t have a frightening face, but ... a look. He would stare 
at the children a lot,” he added.

A former neighbour in Bouhlel’s hometown of M’saken, about 120km (75 miles) 
south of Tunis, told Reuters he had left forFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> in 2005, after getting married, and 
had worked as a driver there.

His home town of M’saken is about 10 km (six miles) outside the coastal city 
of Sousse, where a gunman killed 38 people, mostly British holidaymakers, on a 
beach a year ago.

Relatives and neighbours in Msaken said Bouhlel was sporty and had shown no 
sign of being radicalised, including when he last returned for the wedding of a 
sister four years ago.

Bouhlel’s brother Jabeur said he still doubted whether his sibling was the 
attacker. “Why would my brother do something like this?” he told Reuters, 
adding: “We’ve been calling him since yesterday evening but he’s not 
responding.”
 
Earnest says the US will give the “strongest support” to France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> and the investigation into the 
attack.

“There are significant capabilities that we have to support them and obviously 
we will assist them,” he says.

A reporter asks about whether recent terror attacks outside the Middle East 
have at all changed the White House’s thinking about its strategy in the region 
– secretary of state John Kerry called Syria the world’s greatest “incubator” 
for terror earlier this week.

Earnest says the calculus has not changed.

“The ultimate solution is not a military one. We can certainly apply 
significant military pressure and commit significant military resources,” he 
says, “but the root cause of all of this has been the failed political 
leadership of Bashar al-Assad.”

The attack is only going “to energize” international military campaigns 
against terrorism, he adds. Earnest again qualifies that very little is known 
about what motivated the killer in Nice.

“Whether or not this person had ties to Isil, the president is committed to 
making sure we do everything possible to protect the American people.”
 
Earnest stresses the dangers of “lone wolf” attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/12/florida-gunman-omar-mateen-fbi-lone-wolf>
, saying “the threat we are facing now is different from core al-Qaida”.

A reporter asks again about whether Barack Obama believes the US is at war. 
“The president has essentially declared that the US is ‘at war’ with terrorist 
organizations such as Isil.”

But Earnest stresses that the White House does not consider the US at odds 
with any religion or civilization. “We are not at war with Islam, we are at war 
with a terrorist organization that attacked us, that perverts Islam to try to 
win recruitment to its cause.”

He’s again asked about people who are radicalized online, as “it’s very 
difficult to interrupt, to disrupt, attacks that are plotted and acted by just 
one person.

“There’s a whole lot more that we need to learn about this incident,” he says.
David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) 
Earnest: "We're mindful of the risk that is posed by a so-called lone wolf." 
Doesn't necessarily have links to a terrorist organisation.

<https://twitter.com/SmithInAmerica/status/754011010411921409>  
The White House spokesman continues to argue that European nations must 
improve their intelligence sharing and security agencies – although French 
police have not yet found signs of radicalization in the Nice attack.

“Just to speak bluntly about this, the previous attacks in Paris in November, 
I think illustrated this vulnerability best,” Earnest says. “The plotters of 
the attack were in Belgium but the attack was inFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>.”

He says this “indicates the cross-border nature of this threat”.

Earnest then argues that it’s actually because the US and its allies are 
winning territory away from Isis in Syria and Iraq that terror attacks have 
increased outside the Middle East.

“There are some in the White House who are aware of the risks involved in the 
progress against Isil,” he says, using another name for Islamic State. “We know 
that there is some evolution in the direction that Isil is giving to potential 
recruits.”

“In some cases aren’t even directed by Isil but rather are radicalized by 
viewing their propaganda online.”


He admits: “I can’t speak to the Nice case” because it’s too soon to know what 
motivated the killer.
David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) 
Earnest: It's more of a significant threat now, according to some analysts, 
because of the progress that is being made.

<https://twitter.com/SmithInAmerica/status/754009010223849472>  
White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that Barack Obama has called François 
Hollande to “relay his condolences to the people ofFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> on behalf of the American people”.

He adds that “the United States and France have made important progress in 
enhancing our security relationship” in the last year.

He says the secretary of defense and the office of the director of national 
intelligence succeeded in working with the French to create a better 
“information-sharing relationship”.

The president’s top national security adviser, Lisa Monaco, traveled to France 
and also worked on a new security deal with her counterpart. Earnest does not 
get into specifics, saying simple that the arrangement will help identify 
threats and prevent attacks.

“There is certain expertise that the United States has,” he says, and the 
secretary of homeland security, Jeh Johnson, has shared some of those 
techniques with French counterparts.

“Information sharing among European countries needs to be enhanced,” he goes 
on, arguing that this will in turn improve US security.

A reporter asks him about whether Obama believes the US is at war with 
terrorism. Earnest says that the president has long said that terrorists 
declared war on the US with the attack of September 11 2001.

“We’ve been at war ever since,” Earnest says. “And we’ve made progress.” 

He says that the deaths of top al-Qaida leaders and the recent retreats of 
Isis are evidence that the US and western nations are succeeding against 
terrorism. Then he turns it to Congress, which has not yet passed a resolution 
– though not a declaration of war – that would sanction increased military 
action against Isis and other groups.

“This is the worst possible time for leaders or American leaders to suggest 
that Americans should start turning on each other. That’s exactly what the 
terrorists want us to do.”

David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) 
Earnest: "We're still waiting on Congress to pass a resolution to authorise 
the use of military force against Isil."

Hours after the attack, parents were still looking for their children at the 
hospital in Nice’s Promenade des Anglais on Friday afternoon, my colleague 
Angelique Chrisafis reports from the city.

The worst thing was the sheer number of children coming in, the nature of 
their injuries – serious head trauma and broken limbs – and the emotion felt by 
the children and their families,” said Frederic Sola, a paediatric orthopaedic 
surgeon who worked in the hospital emergency room through the night. “The 
children were physically very injured but also emotionally very hurt.”

Some relatives were in such shock they were unable to talk. “The psychologists 
have heard terrible things, there are awful stories that children are telling,” 
said Stéphanie Simpson, head of the hospital’s communications team.

She said 39 people hit in the attacks had been brought to the children’s 
emergency department. A total of 30 children were treated at the hospital after 
the attack – the youngest only a few months old and the oldest was 18. Two 
children died in the night after being admitted. Several children were still in 
intensive care on Friday.

The emotion on the Fondation Lenval emergency ward was heightened by the fact 
that the six-storey children’s hospital – with its vast airy atrium, kite 
mosaic, and teddy bear frescoes on a corridor wall – is located right on the 
promenade where the attack took place. The suspect, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, 
had passed the hospital as he set out to drive at high speed into the crowd of 
Bastille Day revellers.

“It happened so close to the hospital that the emotion is very strong,” said 
Simpson. She herself had been at the fireworks display with her 10-year-old son 
and had posted pictures on Facebook of him grinning in front of blue and red 
fireworks exploding in the sky 20 minutes before the attack.

She left 15 minutes before the truck struck because she had spotted a drop of 
rain falling on her phone while she was taking the photos, and felt it was 
getting a bit chilly. “There were so many families there – children and 
grandparents – and many of them had been picnicking on the beach,” she said.

Barack Obama has ordered the White House and all public buildings and military 
stations to fly the flag at half-staff in respect of the Nice victims, as 
people aroundFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> plan vigils in 
mourning of the dead.

The AP reports on those plans, and on families’ efforts to find survivors.

Different parts of France have planned vigils and rallies in mourning at the 
scores who lost their lives and defiance against the driver who took them.

Avignon mayor Cécile Helle is calling for a large rally Friday in front of the 
city hall, with other smaller gatherings and vigils planned the same day and 
over the weekend in towns such as Poitiers, Le Creusot and Pau.

With some people still searching for news of their loved ones after the Nice 
truck attack, a Facebook site called “SOS Nice” has begun to attract posts from 
people hoping to be reunited with missing family members.

The site was quickly filling up with photos, appeals and in some cases good
