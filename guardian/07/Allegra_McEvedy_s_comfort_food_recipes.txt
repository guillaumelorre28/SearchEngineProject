Farro and lentil soup <http://gu.com/p/34z2y>

I first encountered this soup in the medieval walled city of Lucca in Tuscany. 
It was a total revelation; the creamiest lentil soup I'd ever tasted. Farro is 
an ancient grain from the same family as spelt, so wheat-free folk will love 
this.

Clams açorda <http://gu.com/p/34z3c>

There are many variations on the açorda theme in Portugal, but this was the 
most memorable for me – we were sitting on the balcony of a cliff-top 
restaurant in Madeira, our heads in the clouds and the sparkling blue sea down 
below.

Cuban chicken with moros y cristianos

Cuba is not a country famed for its culinary heritage, but I had this in a 
paladar – a family-run restaurant, as opposed to a state-run restaurant – 
and its simple flavours delivered a direct hit to the tastebuds.

Salad scheherazade <http://gu.com/p/34z43>

I ate a salad like this in Tangier after a particularly stormy crossing from 
Spain (I was trying to put some distance between me and a rather tumultuous 
affair). I'll always remember the soothing effect it had on both my churning 
stomach and my battered heart.
