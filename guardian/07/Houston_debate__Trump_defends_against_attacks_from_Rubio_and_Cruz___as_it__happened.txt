Summary

The tenth Republican debate of the 2016 race for the White House is in the 
can. Here’s what happened:

 * Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz threw as many punches as they could at 
frontrunner Donald Trump, who was standing between them. He dismissed them, 
argued with them, insulted them and generally gave as good as he got. 
 * Rubio got under Trump’s skin, by demanding that he describe his plan for 
health insurance reform beyond creating a national market. Trump said “You’ll 
have competition. It’ll be beautiful” but could not say more. 
 * Pressed by a moderator to describe his health plan in any depth, Trump 
fumed, “No! There’s nothing to add. What is to add? What is to add?” 
 * “Now he’s repeating himself!” said

 Rubio, lampooning Trump’s rhetorical default mode: “Everyone’s dumb. He’s 
gonna make America great again, we’re gonna win win win, and the lines around 
the states” will go away. 
 * Cruz joined in the attack on Trump, saying that while he, Cruz, was 
fighting immigration reform in Congress, “Where was Donald? He was firing 
Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice.” 
 * Trump called Cruz a “basketcase” and a “liar” and he called Rubio a “choke 
artist.” Trumpbart News (@Trumpbart)

 * Rubio dumped his opposition research file on Trump, saying he hired foreign 
workers ahead of Americans, defrauded students at a university bearing his 
name, made his ties and suits in Mexico and China and drove companies to 
bankruptcy. 
 * Trump said he couldn’t release his tax returns because he was being audited 
and his lawyers wouldn’t let him release them. 
 * Trump dismissed polls that showed him performing miserably among Hispanic 
voters. “I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years I have 
employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They’re incredible people.” 
 * Ohio governor John Kasich made repeated calls for greater seriousness of 
purpose as Dr Ben Carson called for greater time for himself to speak. 
 * Trump entered the debate with very strong polling numbers in upcoming Super 
Tuesday states, and if anything happened onstage tonight capable of eroding the 
kinds of purported leads you see below – we didn’t recognize it. Joshua Green

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> is on TV claiming to 
be the only one who has beentaking on Donald Trump. Save Jeb Bush:

The only one else in the field who was willing to take on Donald was Jeb Bush. 
I was glad to welcome Marco to the debate for the first time.

Cruz also says “Marco and I are friends” but his voice kind of rises 
uncomfortably as he says it.

Usually we attempt a rather extensive roundup of reactions on social media to 
what happened on the debate stage. But tonight this is the first one we came 
across and we’re left wondering what there is to add.

Trump on rivals: 'they're desperate'

Cuomo continues to ask Trump what it was like to be ganged up on by the 
senators.

“I knew it was going to happen. I just enjoyed it. ...I really anticipated it.”

Trump on senators Cruz and Rubio:

“They’re desperate, I mean what are they going to do, they’re losing by 
massive amounts.”

Then Trump hilariously cuts Cuomo off:

It was a good test, it was really a good test, I really liked it and I enjoyed 
it. And now I go down and speak to people other than you.”

Trump: "I think it's going to be over fairly quickly'

CNN’s Chris Cuomo is interviewing Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. Cuomo asks Trump about being 
attacked from both sides, by Cruz and Rubio.

Trump says “I thought it was exciting and I thought it was great. I’ve dealt 
with the toughest people in the world in my lifetime. I’ve dealt with much 
tougher... I think it’s really a good test.

“The problem with Marco, he’s a choke artist, he chokes... he kept repeating 
himself. ... One thing I learned from sports, I was a very good athlete, when 
you’re a choker you’re always a choker.

“You know Marco, I’m 20 points up on him...

“I think it’s going to be over fairly quickly, and I don’t think there’s going 
to be a [contested] convention.”

Closing statements

Carson: What kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Several years 
ago a movie was made about these hands... [holds out hands] I’m asking you 
tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal inspire and revive America.

Kasich: I poll strongly against Clinton. Executive experience matters. Notice 
that I have the foreign policy experience, a lot of years, not just a few 
years. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again.

Rubio: This campaign has come a long way. The votes are starting to count. The 
time for games are over. It’s time to narrow it down and I’m asking you to get 
behind me. Let’s end the silliness and looniness.

Cruz: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several 
dealmakers on this stage but I’m the only one who has stood up to Washington 
deals. Planned Parenthood bad, Iranian deal bad, religious liberty good, 
Obamacare bad, IRS bad, border good, jobs good.

Trump: Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They’re all talk and no 
action. Look at this country. I will get it done. Politicians will never ever 
get it done and we will make America great again.

Trump sounded a little tired, or hoarse, there. 

They’re done. Five days till Super Tuesday.

James Pethokoukis

The answers about Apple are quite disappointing, finds James Pethokoukis. 
Isn’t this the party of small government?

In the Apple encryption question, all the Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> are ignoring what a 
tremendous bit of government over-reach this is.

The GOP is supposed to be the small government party, and at least the 
candidates should raise an eyebrow when government is ignoring a company’s 
claims that a federal order would trash its products and marketplace position.

Tech advances will almost inevitably lead to an age of ubiquitous encryption. 
The common-sense answer here is the one that Apple boss Tim Cook and some in 
Congress are proposing: scrap the government’s court order and instead form a 
government commission of experts to provide recommendations that balance 
corporate interests, privacy, and national security.

Also not a great moment for the GOP trying to make inroads into Silicon Valley.

Kasich is the only one who sounds reasonable, and knows something about policy.

Presumably this disqualifies him from winning the nomination.

Rubio; but it's not a real estate deal, Donald, Israel is not a real estate 
deal!

Not sure the Palestinians would agree 100% with that, Marco, not that you give

The NRA. People with mental health problems who want to own guns. People that

Trump is asked, in effect, why not build a wall on the Canadian border too – 
couldn’t Isis fighters enter the United States from Canada?

“You’re talking about a border that’s many many many times longer,” Trump 
says. And we have less problem with that border, not counting “the tremendous 
amount of drugs that are coming in.”

The tenth Republican debate of the 2016 race for the White House is in the 
can. Here’s what happened:

 * Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz threw as many punches as they could at 
frontrunner Donald Trump, who was standing between them. He dismissed them, 
argued with them, insulted them and generally gave as good as he got. 
 * Rubio got under Trump’s skin, by demanding that he describe his plan for 
health insurance reform beyond creating a national market. Trump said “You’ll 
have competition. It’ll be beautiful” but could not say more. 
 * Pressed by a moderator to describe his health plan in any depth, Trump 
fumed, “No! There’s nothing to add. What is to add? What is to add?” 
 * “Now he’s repeating himself!” said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/feb/25/republican-debate-trump-cruz-rubio-live-houston-super-tuesday?page=with:block-56cfb96ae4b0bd5a0524cb02#block-56cfb96ae4b0bd5a0524cb02>
 Rubio, lampooning Trump’s rhetorical default mode: “Everyone’s dumb. He’s 
gonna make America great again, we’re gonna win win win, and the lines around 
the states” will go away. 
 * Cruz joined in the attack on Trump, saying that while he, Cruz, was 
fighting immigration reform in Congress, “Where was Donald? He was firing 
Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice.” 
 * Trump called Cruz a “basketcase” and a “liar” and he called Rubio a “choke 
artist.” Trumpbart News (@Trumpbart)

<https://twitter.com/Trumpbart/status/703036127859470337> 
 * Rubio dumped his opposition research file on Trump, saying he hired foreign 
workers ahead of Americans, defrauded students at a university bearing his 
name, made his ties and suits in Mexico and China and drove companies to 
bankruptcy. 
 * Trump said he couldn’t release his tax returns because he was being audited 
and his lawyers wouldn’t let him release them. 
 * Trump dismissed polls that showed him performing miserably among Hispanic 
voters. “I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years I have 
employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They’re incredible people.” 
 * Ohio governor John Kasich made repeated calls for greater seriousness of 
purpose as Dr Ben Carson called for greater time for himself to speak. 
 * Trump entered the debate with very strong polling numbers in upcoming Super 
Tuesday states, and if anything happened onstage tonight capable of eroding the 
kinds of purported leads you see below – we didn’t recognize it. Joshua Green

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> is on TV claiming to 
be the only one who has beentaking on Donald Trump. Save Jeb Bush:

The only one else in the field who was willing to take on Donald was Jeb Bush. 
I was glad to welcome Marco to the debate for the first time.

Cruz also says “Marco and I are friends” but his voice kind of rises 
uncomfortably as he says it.
 
Usually we attempt a rather extensive roundup of reactions on social media to 
what happened on the debate stage. But tonight this is the first one we came 
across and we’re left wondering what there is to add.

Cuomo continues to ask Trump what it was like to be ganged up on by the 
senators.

“I knew it was going to happen. I just enjoyed it. ...I really anticipated it.”

Trump on senators Cruz and Rubio:

“They’re desperate, I mean what are they going to do, they’re losing by 
massive amounts.”

Then Trump hilariously cuts Cuomo off:

It was a good test, it was really a good test, I really liked it and I enjoyed 
it. And now I go down and speak to people other than you.”

CNN’s Chris Cuomo is interviewing Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. Cuomo asks Trump about being 
attacked from both sides, by Cruz and Rubio.

Trump says “I thought it was exciting and I thought it was great. I’ve dealt 
with the toughest people in the world in my lifetime. I’ve dealt with much 
tougher... I think it’s really a good test.

“The problem with Marco, he’s a choke artist, he chokes... he kept repeating 
himself. ... One thing I learned from sports, I was a very good athlete, when 
you’re a choker you’re always a choker.

“You know Marco, I’m 20 points up on him...

“I think it’s going to be over fairly quickly, and I don’t think there’s going 
to be a [contested] convention.”
 
Carson: What kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Several years 
ago a movie was made about these hands... [holds out hands] I’m asking you 
tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal inspire and revive America.

Kasich: I poll strongly against Clinton. Executive experience matters. Notice 
that I have the foreign policy experience, a lot of years, not just a few 
years. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again.

Rubio: This campaign has come a long way. The votes are starting to count. The 
time for games are over. It’s time to narrow it down and I’m asking you to get 
behind me. Let’s end the silliness and looniness.

Cruz: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several 
dealmakers on this stage but I’m the only one who has stood up to Washington 
deals. Planned Parenthood bad, Iranian deal bad, religious liberty good, 
Obamacare bad, IRS bad, border good, jobs good.

Trump: Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They’re all talk and no 
action. Look at this country. I will get it done. Politicians will never ever 
get it done and we will make America great again.

Trump sounded a little tired, or hoarse, there. 

They’re done. Five days till Super Tuesday. 
 
The answers about Apple are quite disappointing, finds James Pethokoukis. 
Isn’t this the party of small government?

In the Apple encryption question, all the Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> are ignoring what a 
tremendous bit of government over-reach this is.

The GOP is supposed to be the small government party, and at least the 
candidates should raise an eyebrow when government is ignoring a company’s 
claims that a federal order would trash its products and marketplace position.

Tech advances will almost inevitably lead to an age of ubiquitous encryption. 
The common-sense answer here is the one that Apple boss Tim Cook and some in 
Congress are proposing: scrap the government’s court order and instead form a 
government commission of experts to provide recommendations that balance 
corporate interests, privacy, and national security.

Also not a great moment for the GOP trying to make inroads into Silicon Valley.

Kasich is the only one who sounds reasonable, and knows something about policy.

Presumably this disqualifies him from winning the nomination.
