Stumps Day Three: Pakistan 70-2 (Azhar 41, Younis 0)

Sam Perry

And so ends day three of this first day-night fixture in Brisbane. Most of the 
day panned out as expected; Pakistan spent some time fighting and improved 
their score from paltry to mediocre. From there Australia scored quickly – 
moving at a clip of over 5 an over to set Pakistan 489 to win. There were 
however a few sub plots to note from the Australian’s innings – Steve Smith was 
at his belligerent best, racing to 63 from 70 deliveries via a number of shots 
that would have looked more at home in a video game than real life test 
cricket. They were brilliant to see. Usman Khawaja too consolidated his second 
innings credentials with 74, and Pete Handscomb bumped his average up with a 
quick 35 not out from 26 balls. Pakistan merely waited for the declaration.

Conversation will however centre on Nic Maddinson’s position, after 
Australia’s number six was dismissed cheaply yet again in the pursuit of quick 
runs. Should this particular failure count for less given the scant opportunity 
he had to impress? I’m guessing that he’ll benefit from his sides dominance and 
be afforded another opportunity.

For Pakistan, they’ll be encouraged by improved resilience in their second 
dig. It was the first time they’ve demonstrated an ability to both defend and 
counter the Australians, and despite the loss of two wickets, they should take 
some confidence from their batting display, finishing at 70-2. Azhar played 
with particular application, and he’ll be joined by the old war horse in Younis 
Khan tomorrow, when hostilities resume and Australia seeks to go one-nil up in 
the series. Although their second innings attack can look at times benign, 
Australia have given themselves so much time to dismiss Pakistan that we can 
safely say this is a matter of when, not if.

Until then, thanks for keeping me company tonight. As obscure as it was, I 
particularly enjoyed the conversation about fieldsmen forward of square. We’ll 
be back tomorrow to bring you the description – we look forward to you joining 
us then.

Cheers,

Sam

33rd over: Pakistan 70-2 (Azhar 41, Younis 0)

It’s Bird to deliver the last over, and Azhar manages it pretty easily. So 
much so that he puts a little exclamation point on proceedings with a fine 
drive down the ground to conclude the day. Warne to Basit Ali this was not.

Pakistan finish the day at 70-2, a far sight better than their performance 
with the bat for the large part of yesterday. Australia now have two days to 
take 8 wickets. They looked a little benign this evening, and will hope to 
threaten more tomorrow.

A day’s wrap to follow.

31st over: Pakistan 67-2 (Azhar 38, Younis 0)

Hazlewood to Khan. No run. A maiden. Really. Enough said.

In this, the penultimate over before the close of play - it would be remiss of 
me not to offer my own entry into the conversation aboutgreatest forward of 
square fieldsman of all time. A disclaimer, I haven’t the breadth of cricket 
experience many of you, dear listeners, have. But this guy saved an enormous 
amount of runs inside the circle. He was the best ground fieldsman I have ever 
seen.

30th over: Pakistan 67-2 (Azhar 38, Younis 0)

Lyon is surprisingly out of the attack, replaced by Bird. It’s a curious 
change, as Lyon was looking pretty likely and had an increasingly raucous Gabba 
crowd behind him. Quite often Smith reverts to pace in moments of attack. It 
seems to take quite a lot for Smith to fully trust in Lyon, but not much for 
him to be discarded. Bird bowls a deliberately full line and is hit thrice to 
the boundary with glorious off and cover drives.

29th over: Pakistan 55-2 (Azhar 26, Younis 0)

Younis is feeling for the ball outside off stump a little here, a ploy that is 
asking Hazlewood to a bowl straighter one to strike the pad. He misses a couple 
before Hazlewood fires one in at middle stump that has Younis quickly jamming 
his bat down on it. Hazlewood was pushing 140km there. It’s full-on survival 
mode. That’s not to be confused withSurvivor mode; the mode adopted by former 
Queensland first class player Lee Carseldine recently during his stint on
Australian Survivor.

Repeated cries of ‘Nice Garry!’ and ‘Yes Garry!’ and ‘Like the look of that

‘subconscious’ when deciding upon their bowling lines. Azhar handles the over 
pretty comfortably.

27th over: Pakistan 54-2 (Azhar 25, Younis 0)

It’s getting precarious for Pakistan. You sense this twenty-odd minute period 
will be as testing as any for both Azhar and especially Khan, who’s just 
arrived (at the crease, not his career). His movements are impressively 
exaggerated as he negotiates Hazlewood’s heavy ball.

27th over: Pakistan 54-2 (Azhar 25, Younis 0)

The 39-year-old Younis arrives to the wicket and promptly adopts a different 
strategy to Lyon, coming well forward and smothering with bat well in front of 
pad. He sees out Lyon’s over.

22 minutes of play remain.

Wicket! Babar c Smith b Lyon 14 (Pakistan 54-2)

Lyon gets his man. He’d been probing some dangerous foot marks outside off 
stump, creating the two-minds necessary to induce the false stroke. Babar 
lunged forward and the ball caught his outside edge, landing in Smith’s hands 
for a regulation snare.

As the umpires contemplate a ball change, the players take a quick drink. 
Here’s a perspective on day-night cricket from Kandukuru, who’s emailed in:

“I was a sceptic, chiefly because there’s nothing in sport so tragic as a 
ground decked up with lights, but with only the proverbial two men and a dog 
watching. A bit like being all dressed up and nowhere to go.
But the crowds have come, and I’m a convert now. At dusk, both the Adelaide 
Oval and the ‘Gabba have looked spectacular on TV. The exaggerated swing under 
lights seems to add an extra dimension to the play, like the Fremantle doctor 
does to post-tea sessions at the WACA. It adds to one of cricket’s unique 
strengths, the outsized influence of both the overhead and underfoot 
conditions. Changing conditions also leave room for tactical innovations 
(Faf-style early declarations, for example) for enterprising/funky captains, as 
they come to grips to night Tests.
A bit more personally, Australian day-night Tests start at 8:30am here in 
India, rather than at an ungodly hour at dawn. So today, Saturday, I’ve been 
able to watch the whole day, while also lazily reading a book on my couch. I 
suspect English viewership of Australian Ashes Tests would go up for the same 
reason.”

26th over: Pakistan 54-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 14)

Smith takes out his third slip, moving him to mid wicket. This allows 
Hazlewood to straighten his line and attack the stumps. It results, as an 
attacking line usually does, in a few well-struck drives, but Azhar cannot beat 
the prowling Warner on a few occasions.

It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway - it’s a maiden.

25th over: Pakistan 54-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 14)

Lyon starting to make things happen as his field closes in. Smith appoints a 
leg slip to counter Azhar and Babar’s increasing reliance on a back foot policy 
to the Australian off spinner. Following the unsuccessful review, Lyon almost

Not out. To describe further, Lyon delivered one that spun sharply as Babar 
moved back and across attempting to flick the delivery fine. Wade was adamant, 
nobody else was. The technology revealed what they probably knew.

Review! Wade appeals with the sort of ferocity he was picked for, though his 
colleagues don’t seem so confident. Smith asks for it reluctantly. Stand by.

24th over: Pakistan 50-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 10)

Aside from an elegant straight drive from Azhar to commence the over, the 
miserly Hazlewood just does what he does. Perhaps the Australians have not 
found themselves in such control of a match in times of late, but a general 
sense of impatience pervades the ground and the commentary. It only takes one 
mistake or one ball to misbehave.

23rd over: Pakistan 47-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 7)

Conversation continues here about the relatively defensive fields to Lyon. The 
doyen of all, Warne, cannot understand why there are so many boundary-riders 
when they’ve got so many runs on the board. I share his confusion. A couple of 
singles milked, and nothing much else.

22nd over: Pakistan 44-1 (Azhar 24, Babar 5)

Josh Hazlewood returns for the Australians, hitting his stride immediately. 
The crowd allows itself a brief roar as their man, Garry, makes a fine save at 
point to prevent a couple of runs.

Speaking of wonderful ground fielding, here’s another brilliant homage to 
Derek Randall, from Robert:

“Dear Sam,

I’m old enough to have just caught the end of Derek Randall’s career when I 
was a nipper. Never saw him at mid-off but caught plenty of his ludicrously 
brilliant feats at cover. He was a game-changer (proven in the way every great 
fielder in the game immediately started copying his MO). It helped that he 
loved every minute of it, just for its physical pleasure, its mere joy and 
didn’t see much difference between a breathtaking catch and a startling 
prevention of a single run. His fluid grace and completely unexpected 
athleticism felt like an evolutionary leap. His running pick-up, 180 swivel and 
return throw in one single inimitable movement has never been bettered. And all 
while looking like a particularly amiable tramp. Top lad.”

Cheers Robert. My Dad talks about Derek Randall a bunch. Clearly I need to 
feast on some more highlights.

21st over: Pakistan 44-1 (Azhar 24, Babar 5)

Azhar and Babar are happy to play Lyon from the back foot here, picking up a 
two and a couple of singles for their efforts. Smith has a few fieldsmen out on 
the boundary for Lyon, slightly perplexing given the match situation. Perhaps 
he’s allowing Lyon the chance to settle in to his spell.

20th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Azhar 21, Babar 2)

Starc starts with a half volley outside off stump. Ali’s crisp off drive is 
athletically saved by Warner, who’s made his presence felt in the field this 
innings. Later on Starc shortens up his opponent with one that climbs to Ali’s 
grille before the splice of his bat intervenes.

Speaking of superior forward of square fielding, here’s some more Derek 
Randall love:

19th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Azhar 19, Babar 2)

It’s time for Garry, and the crowd will tell you. He’s immediately extracting 
significant purchase from the wicket, which will encourage the Australians 
immensely. His flat deliveries seem to be eliciting greater spin - and it’s not 
slow turn, either. Handscomb awaits under the lid.

18th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Azhar 18, Babar 1)

Starc continues here, as does the lull the game has entered. Australia 
understandably are patiently awaiting a mistake and a nick, Pakistan are simply 
surviving. Another maiden ensues.

An excellent contribution from Kandukuru Nagarjun on the ‘forward of square’ 
fielding conversation.

“How about Clive Lloyd, nicknamed SuperCat by Arlott because of the way he 
prowled the covers? Or Viv Richards, who ran a million people out in the ‘75 
World Cup final from cover point and elsewhere in the outfield?

From that West Indies vintage, Roger Harper, sometimes described as the 
greatest all-round fieldsman ever? Or little Gus Logie, who pulled off many 
blinders in such positions?”

Brilliant offering Kandukuru, enough for me to want to stress that my entry is 
by no means meant to be understood as the best one!

17th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Azhar 18, Babar 1)

Bird is hovering around the late-120s mark, wobbling the ball on his requisite 
tight line. A good single to Ali stands out amongst other dot balls.

Earlier in the over a near mix-up has Warner shying at the stumps, and 
reverting to type by missing (possibly harsh there). He gives it a fair old 
heave though, it’d take some stopping.

Finally a taker on the ‘best forward of square fieldsman of all time’ vote. 
Zvon @LLBoban on Twitter writes: “I nominated Derek Randall but mistakenly sent 
it to Russell Jackson who will be confused when he wakes up and checks twitter.”

Cheers Zvon, here’s a pic of the great man. 


That’s drinks. Pakistan would be reasonably happy to finish at one down there, 
I’d say.

16th over: Pakistan 33-1 (Azhar 17, Babar 1)

Wahey! Babar gets one through the off side and Pakistan have a run. After a 
few overs of nothingness, a restlessness has settled over the crowd. Starc 
inserts a leg-slip for Ali - I’d love to see that come into play...not so much 
for a fended catch, but for a full-blooded flick to fly to the fieldsman. That 
would come at greater velocity than an edge, I’d wager.

15th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

It’s fairly ‘village’, as they say, to audibly count the dot-balls but 21 have 
now passed as Bird delivers another maiden. The over is notable for a moment 
where Bird’s towel falls out of his pants in his delivery stride. Ali is 
momentarily distracted and offers a limp waft of his bat to the ball before 
motioning the distraction to Bird. I don’t think Bird cared. In fact I think 
Bird may have lipped him for his troubles. Come on Aussie, I guess.

14th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

Back-to-back maidens for the Australians. Channel 9 has picked up an anomaly 
in Starc’s run-up. Whereas he normally lands his front foot right at the tip of 
the bowling crease, he is a fair way behind it here. The upshot? Slightly 
decreased pace and rhythm - probably enough to make his offerings fractionally 
easier for the Pakistan batsmen.

No takers on the greatest cover / mid-off fieldsmen of all time, I take it? An 
obscure question, I know.

13th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

Azhar moves back into a pretty defensive posture - no doubt in response to the 
loss of a wicket. Bird is happy to probe that fourth stump line. The over ends 
in a draw - a relatively untroubled maiden.

There’s something about Renshaw, isn’t there? It’s hard to escape the thought 
that he’s enjoyed a pretty charmed commencement to his Test career. He rode 
criticism of his slow-scoring against South Africa, but aside from that has 
looked pretty comfortable at this level. Being able to take excellentgrabs at 
first slip no doubt increases his gravitas too.

12th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

Starc, previously lacking penetration, gets Australia away in this innings 
with one that Sami probably should have left. Further replays confirm that the 
ball was of pretty good length, and that Sami didn’t appear committed to the 
stroke in the way the ball necessitated.

In other news Renshaw, who took the catch, has a pretty infectious smile, 
doesn’t he?

Wicket! Sami c Renshaw b Starc 15 (Pakistan 31-1)

Starc is reintroduced into the attack and strikes almost immediately with a 
fullish ball that Sami attempts to drive. He succeeds only in gaining a healthy 
edge which flies at face height to Renshaw, who takes the catch comfortably, 
crouched, fingers up, before falling slowly to the turf. Australia are away.

11th over: Pakistan 31-0 (Azhar 16, Sami 15)

Bird’s starting to make the ball talk, and it hits the pad of Azhar whose long 
stride saves him. It’s a stride that is heading a little further towards cover 
than is normal - he’ll probably need to straighten it. Bird finishes the over 
with one that swings away. This over has comfortably seen more swing than any 
other. Are the lights starting to take effect, is Bird bowling most skillfully, 
or both?

Meanwhile here is one of Queensland’s finest sons:

10th over: Pakistan 31-0 (Azhar 16, Sami 15)

Hazlewood takes a points decision over Sami this over, eliciting a couple of 
inside edges and indecision from the Pakistan opener. He accrues another 
probing maiden to his name.

Phil Withall’s emailed in: “Evening Sam.

I understand the appeal of day/night cricket for broadcasters and cricket 
administrators, the crowds at the Gabba have been very impressive, but I’m not 
a fan. The difference in batting conditions are much more severe than is the 
norm.

I know people say test cricket needs to be innovative to attract media
coverage, sponsorship and the like but for me it creates a hybrid game. The 
only Day-Knight I’m interested in lives in Fountain Lakes and has a friend that 
nearly married Shane Warne.”

It’s a great discussion Phil, on both counts. I think there’s something to be 
said for guaranteed variety to Test match conditions. What do others think?

9th over: Pakistan 31-0 (Azhar 16, Sami 15)

My ears pricked up listening to Waqar Younis describe the state of cricket in 
Pakistan, sadly caught up in political machinations with implications far more 
sobering than what we’re used to hearing about on Channel 9. Fair play to them 
for encouraging the discussion. Younis is explaining the sadness of cricket 
being banned in his home country, particularly given the number of new and 
refurbished stadiums standing empty at the moment.

It’s at that point that Azhar drives Bird down the ground handsomely, taking 
Pakistan to 31 without loss.

8th over: Pakistan 26-0 (Azhar 12, Sami 14)

Hazlewood continues and manages to shape one past Azhar, notable as much for 
the rareness of such an occurrence this innings as anything else. The over 
passes without event, and one imagines Steve Smith may have expected a little 
more from his opening bowling ‘cartel’ (as Malcolm Knox coined them) this 
evening.

Separately, following Rowan’s backhanded compliment to the Handscomb-Maddinson 
middle order (backhand to Maddinson, compliment to Handscomb), Sarah writes: 
“Handscomb looks grand. 2nd turn at bat = on fire. At least we haven’t wrecked 
him, unlike Jennings: cracking debut. Crap since.”

Agree about Handscomb. Has looked like he belongs at the level immediately. 
Jennings, to be fair to him, scored a hundred on debut in India! That’s worth 
at least a few more tests I would have thought.

7th over: Pakistan 26-0 (Azhar 12, Sami 14)

Jack Bird’s into the attack (the name has nice assonance to it) which reflects 
Pakistan’s assured start. Starc wasn’t terrible, but it was surprising that he 
was unable to elicit any of the prodigious swing or pace that we’ve become 
accustomed to. Bird gets a couple to leave the batsmen late, but they’re 
disinterest in playing renders the deliveries pretty harmless.

6th over: Pakistan 23-0 (Azhar 9, Sami 14)

A maiden to Hazlewood momentarily restores the status-quo. I guess that’s what 
he does. Sami looked pretty solid in defence nevertheless.

Rowan writes: “I for one am loving Australia’s new middle order.

If you combine the batting averages of Hanscomb and Maddinson, they’re 0.77 
behind one Donald George Bradman! Not bad at all.”

Very droll, Rowan! I’ve always loved knowledge of statistics to two decimal 
points.

5th over: Pakistan 23-0 (Azhar 9, Sami 14)

Another boundary to Sami behind point makes this a pretty decent start for 
Pakistan. The left-hander then punches Hazlewood through extra cover but it’s 
quickly run down by Warner, whose anticipation probably saves one. When we talk 
about great fielders we often focus on those catching behind the wicket, or 
those effecting run-outs from backward point. But who are the best fielders in 
front of the wicket? I have one that comes to mind immediately...any other 
views out there?

4th over: Pakistan 17-0 (Azhar 8, Sami 9)

The familiar hum of a Mexican Wave filters through the TV as Hazlewood 
continues his commitment to the metronome. An assortment of balls on a 4th and 
5th stump line are comfortably left by Sami, who then evades a pretty 
misdirected bouncer to finish the over. It’s always hard to detect just how 
off-target those bouncers are on TV - Sami’s nonchalant body language gave it 
away.

3rd over: Pakistan 16-0 (Azhar 7, Sami 9)

All 16 runs have come from Starc’s bowling, which to this point has been 
without much swing and sideways movement. Azhar leans nicely on one through the 
offside and picks up three, before the left-handed Sami spoons one up that 
falls safely between point and cover.

2nd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Azhar 0, Sami 6)


Comparisons in cricket are always fraught. The latest, most bothersome one is 
that of Renshaw and Hayden. I’ll make an exception for Josh Hazlewood though, 
who is increasingly McGrath-esque in his routine excellence in accuracy. He 
starts with a probing maiden.

Meanwhile Sarah writes in on Twitter: “Hey Sam. Watching from London. Loving 
it. PS. Even the pommy husband is enjoying this game far more than#INDvENG 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/INDvENG?src=hash> -- fine by me!” 

Thanks for writing in Sarah. England are 424-7 in India, and although down in 
the series, I’m sure a number of Australians would bite your hand off for a 
score like that.

1st over: Pakistan 6-0 (Azhar 0, Sami 6)

Decibel levels at the Gabba have noticeably risen as Starc commences the 
innings. Three slips and a short leg explain the situation. Sami hangs his bat 
out at one which races through the ever-vacant fourth slip region for four, and 
whips a straighter one down to fine leg. The whip looked good too. Good carry 
for Starc, who’s immediately bowling 140+km/hr.

Australia has declared at 202/5, a lead of 489

Word is in, Australia has declared. No doubt kit is being strewn about the 
Pakistan dressing room as we speak while the Australians giddily back-slap each 
other.

That leaves the equation as follows: Pakistan will require 490 runs to win in 
seven sessions. For Pakistan’s sake, let’s all check the Brisbane weather 
forecast now.

G'day

Sam Perry

Greetings all and a happy day three dinner break to you, wherever you are 
around the world.

We arrive at the final session with Australia in total control of the fixture. 
A classic flurry of quick second innings runs – complete with bold stroke play 
and wild dismissals – has stretched Australia’s lead to an unassailable 489. At 
the time of writing, we are not officially wise to whether they’ve opted to 
declare or not. To be fair, it would be strange if Smith were to instruct of 
his decision at the start of dinner. That sort of stuff is best left to the 
last minute, thus leaving the Pakistan dressing room in total two-minded 
mystery as to what Australia will do. Then, when Smith advises of the 
declaration, presumably the Pakistan openers would find themselves frantically 
tossing gear around, deeply surprised by the Australian’s cunning. 
Alternatively, they’ve probably already started padding up.

While Australia remains in control, a couple of interesting subplots have 
emerged. In the pursuit of quick runs, Maddinson failed again. His place in the 
side is probably worth discussing ahead of Boxing Day, simply because he has 
failed three times with the bat.

‘But he was batting in night, pink-ball conditions!’ you say. That’s true, and 
it will be interesting to see what weight that’s given as the selectors convene 
ahead of the post-Christmas Test. What do you think?

On the same topic, but more broadly – is there something to be said for the 
stark difference in the batting conditions both sides have operated in? Is it 
manifestly unfair, or do you enjoy the added complexity? Not so long ago 
cricket suffered from a dearth of testing conditions – a night Test match 
almost guarantees variety every day. After near-decades of flat tracks, I’m 
inclined to think it’s a good thing. Whatever the case, these are strange new 
times in Test cricket.

I’ll fire up the regular comment upon the start of the third session. Would 
love to hear from you in both old and new forms. Email me at
sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk <mailto:sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk> 
or tweet me at @sjjperry – I’ll be monitoring both, desperate for connection.

Desperation aside, I’m hoping for a bit of Pakistan resistance here, but it’s 
hard to see where it’s coming from.

Dinner on day three - Australia lead by 489 runs

39th over: Australia 201-5 (Handscomb 35, Wade 1)

And that is dinner. Handscomb belted one of the more forceful singles you’ll 
see out to the deep on the off side, Wade got off the mark with a single, and 
there was not much else happening. So with that, Australia go to dinner with a 
489-run lead and will surely look to have a bowl in the evening. Taking you 
through that will be Sam Perry. Thanks for your company in the first two 
sessions.

38th over: Australia 199-5 (Handscomb 33, Wade 0)

Wade gets bat on a scorcher from Wahab to end the over and we’ll probably have 
just one more before the dinner break. That lovely man Sam Perry will be 
dropping by soon after to take you through the rest of the evening. Australia’s 
lead is now 486.

Robert McLiam Wilson has also dropped by. “Given your boyish love of all 
things Pakistani cricket, how are you feeling today, young Rusty? Is their 
first innings a crushing disappointment or is it mitigated by an Aussie side 
showing a bit of divil? Are you in a no-win or no-lose emotional/sporting 
predicament? Back in the day, this was how I used to feel when Peter Beardsley 
played for England. All victories were his and yet it was never not fun to see 
them lose.”

Answer: I’m a bit flat about it to be honest. Pakistan flogging Australia at 
the Gabba would have been the high water mark of cricket comedy.

More Bob: “On another point, how do you think Mark Ramprakash feels to see 
Khawaja so thoroughly stealing hisshoulda-been career?”

I was actually hugely worried Khawaja would be our Ramps. Thank goodness it 
hasn’t come to pass.

WICKET! Maddinson c Azhar b Wahab 4 (Australia 199-5)

Maddinson departs! Oh dear, another cheap dismissal for the youngster but he 
was doing the right thing here, crashing a bouncer towards the fence at fine 
leg, where he’s caught. A ball earlier he hammered a boundary over Wahab’s head 
but his eventful innings is done after three deliveries. You can’t really cane 
him for that one, though people inevitably will.

37th over: Australia 188-4 (Handscomb 26, Maddinson 0)

Maddinson gets a wide one from Rahat first up and goes after it but doesn’t 
make contact. He’ll have about eight minutes to bat here. Not ideal.

Reader Phil Withall can come over to mine and fix the front garden if he 
likes. “The relentless wittering of ‘the local commentators’ drove me into the 
garden,” he says. “I trimmed hedges and mowed the grass in 30 degrees heat 
hoping that by the time I’d finished they would have stopped looking for a 
myriad ways to explain why they hadn’t/couldn’t/will declare. Yet they still 
seem to be able to discover new ways of doing it. I might have to go and dig a 
hole just for the hell of it.”

Now that you’ve said it Phil, how can I resist this one?

WICKET! Khawaja c Misbah b Rahat 73 (Australia 188-4)

Khawaja departs! What a shame. He played a beautiful knock here but departs 
looking for quick runs when he rocks back to Rahat and doesn’t quite get a 
handle on a heave towards cow corner, so Misbah holds a smart catch with a 
small dive. Nic Maddinson will bat after all!

36th over: Australia 184-3 (Khawaja 73, Handscomb 23)

Isn’t it funny: if out-of-sorts Nic Maddinson was in now you’d be nervous for 
him but Peter Handscomb is having a ball, clubbing one past gully with a superb 
square drive to pick up four and continue the spree. Khawaja goes one better 
when he uses Wahab’s pace to shovel the ball over the vacant cordon and pick up 
four. A single ends the over and hopes remain high that with some dash, he 
could get to a hundred before dinner. That is 15 minutes away.

Australia edge closer to big victory against stubborn Pakistan
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/17/australia-gabba-pakistan-test-day-night> 
And so ends day three of this first day-night fixture in Brisbane. Most of the 
day panned out as expected; Pakistan spent some time fighting and improved 
their score from paltry to mediocre. From there Australia scored quickly – 
moving at a clip of over 5 an over to set Pakistan 489 to win. There were 
however a few sub plots to note from the Australian’s innings – Steve Smith was 
at his belligerent best, racing to 63 from 70 deliveries via a number of shots 
that would have looked more at home in a video game than real life test 
cricket. They were brilliant to see. Usman Khawaja too consolidated his second 
innings credentials with 74, and Pete Handscomb bumped his average up with a 
quick 35 not out from 26 balls. Pakistan merely waited for the declaration.

Conversation will however centre on Nic Maddinson’s position, after 
Australia’s number six was dismissed cheaply yet again in the pursuit of quick 
runs. Should this particular failure count for less given the scant opportunity 
he had to impress? I’m guessing that he’ll benefit from his sides dominance and 
be afforded another opportunity.

For Pakistan, they’ll be encouraged by improved resilience in their second 
dig. It was the first time they’ve demonstrated an ability to both defend and 
counter the Australians, and despite the loss of two wickets, they should take 
some confidence from their batting display, finishing at 70-2. Azhar played 
with particular application, and he’ll be joined by the old war horse in Younis 
Khan tomorrow, when hostilities resume and Australia seeks to go one-nil up in 
the series. Although their second innings attack can look at times benign, 
Australia have given themselves so much time to dismiss Pakistan that we can 
safely say this is a matter of when, not if.

Until then, thanks for keeping me company tonight. As obscure as it was, I 
particularly enjoyed the conversation about fieldsmen forward of square. We’ll 
be back tomorrow to bring you the description – we look forward to you joining 
us then.

Cheers,

Sam
 
33rd over: Pakistan 70-2 (Azhar 41, Younis 0)

It’s Bird to deliver the last over, and Azhar manages it pretty easily. So 
much so that he puts a little exclamation point on proceedings with a fine 
drive down the ground to conclude the day. Warne to Basit Ali this was not.

Pakistan finish the day at 70-2, a far sight better than their performance 
with the bat for the large part of yesterday. Australia now have two days to 
take 8 wickets. They looked a little benign this evening, and will hope to 
threaten more tomorrow.

A day’s wrap to follow.
 
31st over: Pakistan 67-2 (Azhar 38, Younis 0)

Hazlewood to Khan. No run. A maiden. Really. Enough said.

In this, the penultimate over before the close of play - it would be remiss of 
me not to offer my own entry into the conversation aboutgreatest forward of 
square fieldsman of all time. A disclaimer, I haven’t the breadth of cricket 
experience many of you, dear listeners, have. But this guy saved an enormous 
amount of runs inside the circle. He was the best ground fieldsman I have ever 
seen.

30th over: Pakistan 67-2 (Azhar 38, Younis 0)

Lyon is surprisingly out of the attack, replaced by Bird. It’s a curious 
change, as Lyon was looking pretty likely and had an increasingly raucous Gabba 
crowd behind him. Quite often Smith reverts to pace in moments of attack. It 
seems to take quite a lot for Smith to fully trust in Lyon, but not much for 
him to be discarded. Bird bowls a deliberately full line and is hit thrice to 
the boundary with glorious off and cover drives.
 
29th over: Pakistan 55-2 (Azhar 26, Younis 0)

Younis is feeling for the ball outside off stump a little here, a ploy that is 
asking Hazlewood to a bowl straighter one to strike the pad. He misses a couple 
before Hazlewood fires one in at middle stump that has Younis quickly jamming 
his bat down on it. Hazlewood was pushing 140km there. It’s full-on survival 
mode. That’s not to be confused withSurvivor mode; the mode adopted by former 
Queensland first class player Lee Carseldine recently during his stint on
Australian Survivor.
 
28th over: Pakistan 55-2 (Azhar 26, Younis 0)

Repeated cries of ‘Nice Garry!’ and ‘Yes Garry!’ and ‘Like the look of that 
Garry!’ permeate my ears as Michael Clarke opines on the work of a spinner’s 
‘subconscious’ when deciding upon their bowling lines. Azhar handles the over 
pretty comfortably.

27th over: Pakistan 54-2 (Azhar 25, Younis 0)

It’s getting precarious for Pakistan. You sense this twenty-odd minute period 
will be as testing as any for both Azhar and especially Khan, who’s just 
arrived (at the crease, not his career). His movements are impressively 
exaggerated as he negotiates Hazlewood’s heavy ball.

27th over: Pakistan 54-2 (Azhar 25, Younis 0)

The 39-year-old Younis arrives to the wicket and promptly adopts a different 
strategy to Lyon, coming well forward and smothering with bat well in front of 
pad. He sees out Lyon’s over.

22 minutes of play remain.
 
Lyon gets his man. He’d been probing some dangerous foot marks outside off 
stump, creating the two-minds necessary to induce the false stroke. Babar 
lunged forward and the ball caught his outside edge, landing in Smith’s hands 
for a regulation snare.

As the umpires contemplate a ball change, the players take a quick drink. 
Here’s a perspective on day-night cricket from Kandukuru, who’s emailed in:

“I was a sceptic, chiefly because there’s nothing in sport so tragic as a 
ground decked up with lights, but with only the proverbial two men and a dog 
watching. A bit like being all dressed up and nowhere to go.
But the crowds have come, and I’m a convert now. At dusk, both the Adelaide 
Oval and the ‘Gabba have looked spectacular on TV. The exaggerated swing under 
lights seems to add an extra dimension to the play, like the Fremantle doctor 
does to post-tea sessions at the WACA. It adds to one of cricket’s unique 
strengths, the outsized influence of both the overhead and underfoot 
conditions. Changing conditions also leave room for tactical innovations 
(Faf-style early declarations, for example) for enterprising/funky captains, as 
they come to grips to night Tests.
A bit more personally, Australian day-night Tests start at 8:30am here in 
India, rather than at an ungodly hour at dawn. So today, Saturday, I’ve been 
able to watch the whole day, while also lazily reading a book on my couch. I 
suspect English viewership of Australian Ashes Tests would go up for the same 
reason.”
 
26th over: Pakistan 54-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 14)

Smith takes out his third slip, moving him to mid wicket. This allows 
Hazlewood to straighten his line and attack the stumps. It results, as an 
attacking line usually does, in a few well-struck drives, but Azhar cannot beat 
the prowling Warner on a few occasions.

It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway - it’s a maiden.
 
25th over: Pakistan 54-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 14)

Lyon starting to make things happen as his field closes in. Smith appoints a 
leg slip to counter Azhar and Babar’s increasing reliance on a back foot policy 
to the Australian off spinner. Following the unsuccessful review, Lyon almost 
gets one through Babar and offers a half-shout.
 
Not out. To describe further, Lyon delivered one that spun sharply as Babar 
moved back and across attempting to flick the delivery fine. Wade was adamant, 
nobody else was. The technology revealed what they probably knew.
 
Review! Wade appeals with the sort of ferocity he was picked for, though his 
colleagues don’t seem so confident. Smith asks for it reluctantly. Stand by.
 
24th over: Pakistan 50-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 10)

Aside from an elegant straight drive from Azhar to commence the over, the 
miserly Hazlewood just does what he does. Perhaps the Australians have not 
found themselves in such control of a match in times of late, but a general 
sense of impatience pervades the ground and the commentary. It only takes one 
mistake or one ball to misbehave.
 
23rd over: Pakistan 47-1 (Azhar 25, Babar 7)

Conversation continues here about the relatively defensive fields to Lyon. The 
doyen of all, Warne, cannot understand why there are so many boundary-riders 
when they’ve got so many runs on the board. I share his confusion. A couple of 
singles milked, and nothing much else.
 
22nd over: Pakistan 44-1 (Azhar 24, Babar 5)

Josh Hazlewood returns for the Australians, hitting his stride immediately. 
The crowd allows itself a brief roar as their man, Garry, makes a fine save at 
point to prevent a couple of runs.

Speaking of wonderful ground fielding, here’s another brilliant homage to 
Derek Randall, from Robert:

“Dear Sam,

I’m old enough to have just caught the end of Derek Randall’s career when I 
was a nipper. Never saw him at mid-off but caught plenty of his ludicrously 
brilliant feats at cover. He was a game-changer (proven in the way every great 
fielder in the game immediately started copying his MO). It helped that he 
loved every minute of it, just for its physical pleasure, its mere joy and 
didn’t see much difference between a breathtaking catch and a startling 
prevention of a single run. His fluid grace and completely unexpected 
athleticism felt like an evolutionary leap. His running pick-up, 180 swivel and 
return throw in one single inimitable movement has never been bettered. And all 
while looking like a particularly amiable tramp. Top lad.”

Cheers Robert. My Dad talks about Derek Randall a bunch. Clearly I need to 
feast on some more highlights.
 
21st over: Pakistan 44-1 (Azhar 24, Babar 5)

Azhar and Babar are happy to play Lyon from the back foot here, picking up a 
two and a couple of singles for their efforts. Smith has a few fieldsmen out on 
the boundary for Lyon, slightly perplexing given the match situation. Perhaps 
he’s allowing Lyon the chance to settle in to his spell.
 
20th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Azhar 21, Babar 2)

Starc starts with a half volley outside off stump. Ali’s crisp off drive is 
athletically saved by Warner, who’s made his presence felt in the field this 
innings. Later on Starc shortens up his opponent with one that climbs to Ali’s 
grille before the splice of his bat intervenes.

Speaking of superior forward of square fielding, here’s some more Derek 
Randall love:
 Derek Randall  
19th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Azhar 19, Babar 2)

It’s time for Garry, and the crowd will tell you. He’s immediately extracting 
significant purchase from the wicket, which will encourage the Australians 
immensely. His flat deliveries seem to be eliciting greater spin - and it’s not 
slow turn, either. Handscomb awaits under the lid.
 
18th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Azhar 18, Babar 1)

Starc continues here, as does the lull the game has entered. Australia 
understandably are patiently awaiting a mistake and a nick, Pakistan are simply 
surviving. Another maiden ensues.

An excellent contribution from Kandukuru Nagarjun on the ‘forward of square’ 
fielding conversation.

“How about Clive Lloyd, nicknamed SuperCat by Arlott because of the way he 
prowled the covers? Or Viv Richards, who ran a million people out in the ‘75 
World Cup final from cover point and elsewhere in the outfield?

From that West Indies vintage, Roger Harper, sometimes described as the 
greatest all-round fieldsman ever? Or little Gus Logie, who pulled off many 
blinders in such positions?”

Brilliant offering Kandukuru, enough for me to want to stress that my entry is 
by no means meant to be understood as the best one!
 
17th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Azhar 18, Babar 1)

Bird is hovering around the late-120s mark, wobbling the ball on his requisite 
tight line. A good single to Ali stands out amongst other dot balls.

Earlier in the over a near mix-up has Warner shying at the stumps, and 
reverting to type by missing (possibly harsh there). He gives it a fair old 
heave though, it’d take some stopping.

Finally a taker on the ‘best forward of square fieldsman of all time’ vote. 
Zvon @LLBoban on Twitter writes: “I nominated Derek Randall but mistakenly sent 
it to Russell Jackson who will be confused when he wakes up and checks twitter.”

Cheers Zvon, here’s a pic of the great man. 


That’s drinks. Pakistan would be reasonably happy to finish at one down there, 
I’d say.

16th over: Pakistan 33-1 (Azhar 17, Babar 1)

Wahey! Babar gets one through the off side and Pakistan have a run. After a 
few overs of nothingness, a restlessness has settled over the crowd. Starc 
inserts a leg-slip for Ali - I’d love to see that come into play...not so much 
for a fended catch, but for a full-blooded flick to fly to the fieldsman. That 
would come at greater velocity than an edge, I’d wager.
 
15th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

It’s fairly ‘village’, as they say, to audibly count the dot-balls but 21 have 
now passed as Bird delivers another maiden. The over is notable for a moment 
where Bird’s towel falls out of his pants in his delivery stride. Ali is 
momentarily distracted and offers a limp waft of his bat to the ball before 
motioning the distraction to Bird. I don’t think Bird cared. In fact I think 
Bird may have lipped him for his troubles. Come on Aussie, I guess.
 
14th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

Back-to-back maidens for the Australians. Channel 9 has picked up an anomaly 
in Starc’s run-up. Whereas he normally lands his front foot right at the tip of 
the bowling crease, he is a fair way behind it here. The upshot? Slightly 
decreased pace and rhythm - probably enough to make his offerings fractionally 
easier for the Pakistan batsmen.

No takers on the greatest cover / mid-off fieldsmen of all time, I take it? An 
obscure question, I know.

13th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

Azhar moves back into a pretty defensive posture - no doubt in response to the 
loss of a wicket. Bird is happy to probe that fourth stump line. The over ends 
in a draw - a relatively untroubled maiden.

There’s something about Renshaw, isn’t there? It’s hard to escape the thought 
that he’s enjoyed a pretty charmed commencement to his Test career. He rode 
criticism of his slow-scoring against South Africa, but aside from that has 
looked pretty comfortable at this level. Being able to take excellentgrabs at 
first slip no doubt increases his gravitas too.
 
12th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Azhar 16, Babar 0)

Starc, previously lacking penetration, gets Australia away in this innings 
with one that Sami probably should have left. Further replays confirm that the 
ball was of pretty good length, and that Sami didn’t appear committed to the 
stroke in the way the ball necessitated.

In other news Renshaw, who took the catch, has a pretty infectious smile, 
doesn’t he?

 
Starc is reintroduced into the attack and strikes almost immediately with a 
fullish ball that Sami attempts to drive. He succeeds only in gaining a healthy 
edge which flies at face height to Renshaw, who takes the catch comfortably, 
crouched, fingers up, before falling slowly to the turf. Australia are away.

11th over: Pakistan 31-0 (Azhar 16, Sami 15)

Bird’s starting to make the ball talk, and it hits the pad of Azhar whose long 
stride saves him. It’s a stride that is heading a little further towards cover 
than is normal - he’ll probably need to straighten it. Bird finishes the over 
with one that swings away. This over has comfortably seen more swing than any 
other. Are the lights starting to take effect, is Bird bowling most skillfully, 
or both?

Meanwhile here is one of Queensland’s finest sons:

10th over: Pakistan 31-0 (Azhar 16, Sami 15)

Hazlewood takes a points decision over Sami this over, eliciting a couple of 
inside edges and indecision from the Pakistan opener. He accrues another 
probing maiden to his name.

Phil Withall’s emailed in: “Evening Sam.

I understand the appeal of day/night cricket for broadcasters and cricket 
administrators, the crowds at the Gabba have been very impressive, but I’m not 
a fan. The difference in batting conditions are much more severe than is the 
norm.

I know people say test cricket needs to be innovative to attract media
coverage, sponsorship and the like but for me it creates a hybrid game. The 
only Day-Knight I’m interested in lives in Fountain Lakes and has a friend that 
nearly married Shane Warne.”

It’s a great discussion Phil, on both counts. I think there’s something to be 
said for guaranteed variety to Test match conditions. What do others think?
 
9th over: Pakistan 31-0 (Azhar 16, Sami 15)

My ears pricked up listening to Waqar Younis describe the state of cricket in 
Pakistan, sadly caught up in political machinations with implications far more 
sobering than what we’re used to hearing about on Channel 9. Fair play to them 
for encouraging the discussion. Younis is explaining the sadness of cricket 
being banned in his home country, particularly given the number of new and 
refurbished stadiums standing empty at the moment.

It’s at that point that Azhar drives Bird down the ground handsomely, taking 
Pakistan to 31 without loss.

 
8th over: Pakistan 26-0 (Azhar 12, Sami 14)

Hazlewood continues and manages to shape one past Azhar, notable as much for 
the rareness of such an occurrence this innings as anything else. The over 
passes without event, and one imagines Steve Smith may have expected a little 
more from his opening bowling ‘cartel’ (as Malcolm Knox coined them) this 
evening.

Separately, following Rowan’s backhanded compliment to the Handscomb-Maddinson 
middle order (backhand to Maddinson, compliment to Handscomb), Sarah writes: 
“Handscomb looks grand. 2nd turn at bat = on fire. At least we haven’t wrecked 
him, unlike Jennings: cracking debut. Crap since.”

Agree about Handscomb. Has looked like he belongs at the level immediately. 
Jennings, to be fair to him, scored a hundred on debut in India! That’s worth 
at least a few more tests I would have thought.
 
7th over: Pakistan 26-0 (Azhar 12, Sami 14)

Jack Bird’s into the attack (the name has nice assonance to it) which reflects 
Pakistan’s assured start. Starc wasn’t terrible, but it was surprising that he 
was unable to elicit any of the prodigious swing or pace that we’ve become 
accustomed to. Bird gets a couple to leave the batsmen late, but they’re 
disinterest in playing renders the deliveries pretty harmless.
 
6th over: Pakistan 23-0 (Azhar 9, Sami 14)

A maiden to Hazlewood momentarily restores the status-quo. I guess that’s what 
he does. Sami looked pretty solid in defence nevertheless.

Rowan writes: “I for one am loving Australia’s new middle order.

If you combine the batting averages of Hanscomb and Maddinson, they’re 0.77 
behind one Donald George Bradman! Not bad at all.”

Very droll, Rowan! I’ve always loved knowledge of statistics to two decimal 
points.

 
5th over: Pakistan 23-0 (Azhar 9, Sami 14)

Another boundary to Sami behind point makes this a pretty decent start for 
Pakistan. The left-hander then punches Hazlewood through extra cover but it’s 
quickly run down by Warner, whose anticipation probably saves one. When we talk 
about great fielders we often focus on those catching behind the wicket, or 
those effecting run-outs from backward point. But who are the best fielders in 
front of the wicket? I have one that comes to mind immediately...any other 
views out there?

Hyde/Getty Images  
4th over: Pakistan 17-0 (Azhar 8, Sami 9)

The familiar hum of a Mexican Wave filters through the TV as Hazlewood 
continues his commitment to the metronome. An assortment of balls on a 4th and 
5th stump line are comfortably left by Sami, who then evades a pretty 
misdirected bouncer to finish the over. It’s always hard to detect just how 
off-target those bouncers are on TV - Sami’s nonchalant body language gave it 
away.
 
3rd over: Pakistan 16-0 (Azhar 7, Sami 9)

All 16 runs have come from Starc’s bowling, which to this point has been 
without much swing and sideways movement. Azhar leans nicely on one through the 
offside and picks up three, before the left-handed Sami spoons one up that 
falls safely between point and cover.
 
2nd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Azhar 0, Sami 6)


Comparisons in cricket are always fraught. The latest, most bothersome one is 
that of Renshaw and Hayden. I’ll make an exception for Josh Hazlewood though, 
who is increasingly McGrath-esque in his routine excellence in accuracy. He 
starts with a probing maiden.

Meanwhile Sarah writes in on Twitter: “Hey Sam. Watching from London. Loving 
it. PS. Even the pommy husband is enjoying this game far more than#INDvENG 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/INDvENG?src=hash> -- fine by me!” 

Thanks for writing in Sarah. England are 424-7 in India, and although down in 
the series, I’m sure a number of Australians would bite your hand off for a 
score like that.
 
1st over: Pakistan 6-0 (Azhar 0, Sami 6)

Decibel levels at the Gabba have noticeably risen as Starc commences the 
innings. Three slips and a short leg explain the situation. Sami hangs his bat 
out at one which races through the ever-vacant fourth slip region for four, and 
whips a straighter one down to fine leg. The whip looked good too. Good carry 
for Starc, who’s immediately bowling 140+km/hr.

Word is in, Australia has declared. No doubt kit is being strewn about the 
Pakistan dressing room as we speak while the Australians giddily back-slap each 
other.

That leaves the equation as follows: Pakistan will require 490 runs to win in 
seven sessions. For Pakistan’s sake, let’s all check the Brisbane weather 
forecast now.
 
Greetings all and a happy day three dinner break to you, wherever you are 
around the world.

We arrive at the final session with Australia in total control of the fixture. 
A classic flurry of quick second innings runs – complete with bold stroke play 
and wild dismissals – has stretched Australia’s lead to an unassailable 489. At 
the time of writing, we are not officially wise to whether they’ve opted to 
declare or not. To be fair, it would be strange if Smith were to instruct of 
his decision at the start of dinner. That sort of stuff is best left to the 
last minute, thus leaving the Pakistan dressing room in total two-minded 
mystery as to what Australia will do. Then, when Smith advises of the 
declaration, presumably the Pakistan openers would find themselves frantically 
tossing gear around, deeply surprised by the Australian’s cunning. 
Alternatively, they’ve probably already started padding up.

While Australia remains in control, a couple of interesting subplots have 
emerged. In the pursuit of quick runs, Maddinson failed again. His place in the 
side is probably worth discussing ahead of Boxing Day, simply because he has 
failed three times with the bat.

‘But he was batting in night, pink-ball conditions!’ you say. That’s true, and 
it will be interesting to see what weight that’s given as the selectors convene 
ahead of the post-Christmas Test. What do you think?

On the same topic, but more broadly – is there something to be said for the 
stark difference in the batting conditions both sides have operated in? Is it 
manifestly unfair, or do you enjoy the added complexity? Not so long ago 
cricket suffered from a dearth of testing conditions – a night Test match 
almost guarantees variety every day. After near-decades of flat tracks, I’m 
inclined to think it’s a good thing. Whatever the case, these are strange new 
times in Test cricket.

I’ll fire up the regular comment upon the start of the third session. Would 
love to hear from you in both old and new forms. Email me at
sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk <mailto:sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk> 
or tweet me at @sjjperry – I’ll be monitoring both, desperate for connection.

Desperation aside, I’m hoping for a bit of Pakistan resistance here, but it’s 
hard to see where it’s coming from.
 
39th over: Australia 201-5 (Handscomb 35, Wade 1)

And that is dinner. Handscomb belted one of the more forceful singles you’ll 
see out to the deep on the off side, Wade got off the mark with a single, and 
there was not much else happening. So with that, Australia go to dinner with a 
489-run lead and will surely look to have a bowl in the evening. Taking you 
through that will be Sam Perry. Thanks for your company in the first two 
sessions.
 
38th over: Australia 199-5 (Handscomb 33, Wade 0)

Wade gets bat on a scorcher from Wahab to end the over and we’ll probably have 
just one more before the dinner break. That lovely man Sam Perry will be 
dropping by soon after to take you through the rest of the evening. Australia’s 
lead is now 486.

Robert McLiam Wilson has also dropped by. “Given your boyish love of all 
things Pakistani cricket, how are you feeling today, young Rusty? Is their 
first innings a crushing disappointment or is it mitigated by an Aussie side 
showing a bit of divil? Are you in a no-win or no-lose emotional/sporting 
predicament? Back in the day, this was how I used to feel when Peter Beardsley 
played for England. All victories were his and yet it was never not fun to see 
them lose.”

Answer: I’m a bit flat about it to be honest. Pakistan flogging Australia at 
the Gabba would have been the high water mark of cricket comedy.

More Bob: “On another point, how do you think Mark Ramprakash feels to see 
Khawaja so thoroughly stealing hisshoulda-been career?”

I was actually hugely worried Khawaja would be our Ramps. Thank goodness it 
hasn’t come to pass.
 
Maddinson departs! Oh dear, another cheap dismissal for the youngster but he 
was doing the right thing here, crashing a bouncer towards the fence at fine 
leg, where he’s caught. A ball earlier he hammered a boundary over Wahab’s head 
but his eventful innings is done after three deliveries. You can’t really cane 
him for that one, though people inevitably will.
 
37th over: Australia 188-4 (Handscomb 26, Maddinson 0)

Maddinson gets a wide one from Rahat first up and goes after it but doesn’t 
make contact. He’ll have about eight minutes to bat here. Not ideal.

Reader Phil Withall can come over to mine and fix the front garden if he 
likes. “The relentless wittering of ‘the local commentators’ drove me into the 
garden,” he says. “I trimmed hedges and mowed the grass in 30 degrees heat 
hoping that by the time I’d finished they would have stopped looking for a 
myriad ways to explain why they hadn’t/couldn’t/will declare. Yet they still 
seem to be able to discover new ways of doing it. I might have to go and dig a 
hole just for the hell of it.”

Now that you’ve said it Phil, how can I resist this one?
 The Castle: Dale dug a hole  
Khawaja departs! What a shame. He played a beautiful knock here but departs 
looking for quick runs when he rocks back to Rahat and doesn’t quite get a 
handle on a heave towards cow corner, so Misbah holds a smart catch with a 
small dive. Nic Maddinson will bat after all!
 
36th over: Australia 184-3 (Khawaja 73, Handscomb 23)

Isn’t it funny: if out-of-sorts Nic Maddinson was in now you’d be nervous for 
him but Peter Handscomb is having a ball, clubbing one past gully with a superb 
square drive to pick up four and continue the spree. Khawaja goes one better 
when he uses Wahab’s pace to shovel the ball over the vacant cordon and pick up 
four. A single ends the over and hopes remain high that with some dash, he 
could get to a hundred before dinner. That is 15 minutes away.
