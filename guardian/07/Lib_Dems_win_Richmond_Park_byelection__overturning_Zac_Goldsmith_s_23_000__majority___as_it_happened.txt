Summary

 * The Liberal Democrats have produced a stunning byelection victory to unseat 
Zac Goldsmith in Richmond Park, overturning a 23,000 majority to remove the 
former Conservative MP in a vote that became a de facto plebiscite on the 
government’s referendum plans. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/02/lib-dems-unseat-zac-goldsmith-in-richmond-park-byelection>
The swing to the Lib Dems was 21.5 points, putting this on a par with some of 
the party’s best ever byelection results (although Goldsmith was standing as an 
independent, so technically it was not a proper Conservative to Lib Dem swing.) 
Labour’s candidate came a distant third, losing his deposit. 
 * Sarah Olney, the winning Lib Dem candidate, said the result would create a 
“shockwave” and send a clear message to the government that people do not want 
a hard Brexit, or to leave the single market.(See 2.52pm.)

 * The Conservatives have dismissed the result, insisting that it will not 
change government policy towards Brexit or Heathrow. (See 2.34pm.)

That’s all from me for tonight. 

I’ll be back tomorrow - well, later today - with a new blog with reaction and 
analysis.

Sarah Olney's victory speech

Here is an extract from Sarah Olney’s victory speech.

A year and a half ago I was not involved in politics, I was not a member of a 
political party, I had never been involved in a political campaign, I had never 
thought about being a politician. But I knew I was a liberal. I believed in 
openness, tolerance, compassion, working with our neigbours around the world.

When I saw what happened at the general election last year I felt I had ot get 
involved.

I think a lot of people in this community had the same feeling after the 
referendum. Richmond Park is full of people like me who felt something was 
going wrong, that the politics of anger and division were on the rise, that the 
liberal tolerant values we took for granted were under threat. We perceived the 
Ukip vision of Britain in the ascendancy, intolerant, backward-looking, 
divisive, just as we see it in America and across Europe.

Well, today we have said no. We will defend the Britain we love. We will stand 
up for the open, tolerant, united Britain we believe in. The people of Richmond 
Park and North Kingston have sent a shockwave through this Conservative Brexit 
government and our message is clear: we do not want a hard Brexit, we do not 
want to be pulled out of the single market and we will not let intolerance, 
division and fear win.

Conservative party says Richmond Park result will not affect Brexit or Heathrow

The Conservative party was not standing in the byelection, but it is the first 
party to sent out a formal comment about the result. This is from a party 
spokesman.

Commiserations to Zac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> on his defeat. Zac has 
been a strong and principled champion for the residents of Richmond Park and 
North Kingston over the past six years as their member of parliament, and a 
popular figure in the Conservative party. We are sorry that he is no longer in 
the House of Commons.

This result doesn’t change anything. The government remains committed to 
leaving the European Union and triggering article 50 by the end of March next 
year. In addition, we will continue to take decisive action in the national 
interest to secure the UK’s place the world - supporting a third runway at 
Heathrow to secure jobs and business opportunities for the next decade and 
beyond.

Christian Wolmar says many people in this constituency wanted to vote Labour 
but lend Sarah Olney their vote. He tells Olney not to ignore them, and not to 
become Tory-lite.

He says he is glad that people voted against Brexit.

And this was also a vote against Zac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith>, and his “ghastly” mayoral 
campaign, he says.

He says Labour remains the party of hope. It will defend the disadvantaged in 
society. It understands how you build community, he says.

He thanks his team, and says it was a privilege to be a candidate here.

Zac Goldsmith says he held this byelection to keep a promise. He says he will 
miss not being MPs here. He loves this community, he says. He wishes Sarah 
Olney well and hopes she will serve the community.

Sarah Olney's speech

Sarah Olney is speaking now.

She thanks the candidates, and tell Zac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> that she will continue his 
fight against Heathrow expansion.

She thanks her campaign staff, and her family and friends. 

And she thanks party members, who helped.

And she thanks the Greens, More United and Women’s Equality party, who also 
helped.

A year ago she was not in politics, she says. But she knew she was a liberal.

She says a lot of people in Richmond Park felt the same after the EU 
referendum. They felt their values were under threat. Today they have said no. 
They will defend the Britain they love. She says the people of Richmond Park 
have sent a shockwave through Britain. They do not want a hard Brexit. They do 
not want to be pulled out of the single market. And they do not want to let 
fear win.

Zac Goldsmith has just arrived. He did not say anything as he came in, despite 
Sky’s Jon Craig - in best Gobby tradition  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30388914>- shouting at him: “What did 
you lose? Was it because of Brexit?”

The Lib Dems have called it but team Zac are not conceding yet, at least to 
me. “The Lib Dems probably would say that, wouldn’t they?” said one aide. 
“We’re not saying it’s over.”

To me they looked very glum. And the Lib Dems say they’re sure of victory. 
Official declaration soon, they say.

 * The Liberal Democrats have produced a stunning byelection victory to unseat 
Zac Goldsmith in Richmond Park, overturning a 23,000 majority to remove the 
former Conservative MP in a vote that became a de facto plebiscite on the 
government’s referendum plans. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/02/lib-dems-unseat-zac-goldsmith-in-richmond-park-byelection>
The swing to the Lib Dems was 21.5 points, putting this on a par with some of 
the party’s best ever byelection results (although Goldsmith was standing as an 
independent, so technically it was not a proper Conservative to Lib Dem swing.) 
Labour’s candidate came a distant third, losing his deposit. 
 * Sarah Olney, the winning Lib Dem candidate, said the result would create a 
“shockwave” and send a clear message to the government that people do not want 
a hard Brexit, or to leave the single market.(See 2.52pm.)

 * The Conservatives have dismissed the result, insisting that it will not 
change government policy towards Brexit or Heathrow. (See 2.34pm.)

That’s all from me for tonight. 

I’ll be back tomorrow - well, later today - with a new blog with reaction and 
analysis.
 
Here is an extract from Sarah Olney’s victory speech.

A year and a half ago I was not involved in politics, I was not a member of a 
political party, I had never been involved in a political campaign, I had never 
thought about being a politician. But I knew I was a liberal. I believed in 
openness, tolerance, compassion, working with our neigbours around the world.

When I saw what happened at the general election last year I felt I had ot get 
involved.

I think a lot of people in this community had the same feeling after the 
referendum. Richmond Park is full of people like me who felt something was 
going wrong, that the politics of anger and division were on the rise, that the 
liberal tolerant values we took for granted were under threat. We perceived the 
Ukip vision of Britain in the ascendancy, intolerant, backward-looking, 
divisive, just as we see it in America and across Europe.

Well, today we have said no. We will defend the Britain we love. We will stand 
up for the open, tolerant, united Britain we believe in. The people of Richmond 
Park and North Kingston have sent a shockwave through this Conservative Brexit 
government and our message is clear: we do not want a hard Brexit, we do not 
want to be pulled out of the single market and we will not let intolerance, 
division and fear win.

The Conservative party was not standing in the byelection, but it is the first 
party to sent out a formal comment about the result. This is from a party 
spokesman.

Commiserations to Zac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> on his defeat. Zac has 
been a strong and principled champion for the residents of Richmond Park and 
North Kingston over the past six years as their member of parliament, and a 
popular figure in the Conservative party. We are sorry that he is no longer in 
the House of Commons.

This result doesn’t change anything. The government remains committed to 
leaving the European Union and triggering article 50 by the end of March next 
year. In addition, we will continue to take decisive action in the national 
interest to secure the UK’s place the world - supporting a third runway at 
Heathrow to secure jobs and business opportunities for the next decade and 
beyond.
 
And here the results in full from the Press Association.

Sarah Olney (LD) 20,510 (49.68%, +30.41%) 

Zac Goldsmith <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> (Ind) 
18,638 (45.15%)

Christian Wolmar (Lab) 1,515 (3.67%, -8.68%) 

Howling Laud Hope (Loony) 184 (0.45%) 

Fiona Syms (Ind) 173 (0.42%) 

Dominic Stockford (CPA) 164 (0.40%) 

Maharaja Jammu and Kashmir (Love) 67 (0.16%) 

David Powell (ND) 32 (0.08%) 

LD maj 1,872 (4.53%) 

Electorate 77,243; Turnout 41,283 (53.45%, -23.01%) 
 
Here the key results again. When they were being read out we could not hear 
the full figure for Sarah Olney because her supporters started cheering as soon 
as they heard “twenty thousand, five hundred ...”

Zac Goldsmith: 18,638


Sarah Olney: 20,510

Christian Wolmar: 1,515
 
Christian Wolmar says many people in this constituency wanted to vote Labour 
but lend Sarah Olney their vote. He tells Olney not to ignore them, and not to 
become Tory-lite.

He says he is glad that people voted against Brexit.

And this was also a vote against Zac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith>, and his “ghastly” mayoral 
campaign, he says.

He says Labour remains the party of hope. It will defend the disadvantaged in 
society. It understands how you build community, he says.

He thanks his team, and says it was a privilege to be a candidate here.
 
Zac Goldsmith says he held this byelection to keep a promise. He says he will 
miss not being MPs here. He loves this community, he says. He wishes Sarah 
Olney well and hopes she will serve the community.
 
Sarah Olney is speaking now.

She thanks the candidates, and tell Zac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> that she will continue his 
fight against Heathrow expansion.

She thanks her campaign staff, and her family and friends. 

And she thanks party members, who helped.

And she thanks the Greens, More United and Women’s Equality party, who also 
helped.

A year ago she was not in politics, she says. But she knew she was a liberal.

She says a lot of people in Richmond Park felt the same after the EU 
referendum. They felt their values were under threat. Today they have said no. 
They will defend the Britain they love. She says the people of Richmond Park 
have sent a shockwave through Britain. They do not want a hard Brexit. They do 
not want to be pulled out of the single market. And they do not want to let 
fear win.
 
We are now getting the results.

Zac Goldsmith: 18,638

Sarah Olney: 20,510

Christian Wolmar: 1,515
 
The candidates have been called up to the front to be told the results. That 
means we should get the public declaration any minute now.
 
Zac Goldsmith has just arrived. He did not say anything as he came in, despite 
Sky’s Jon Craig - in best Gobby tradition  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30388914>- shouting at him: “What did 
you lose? Was it because of Brexit?”
