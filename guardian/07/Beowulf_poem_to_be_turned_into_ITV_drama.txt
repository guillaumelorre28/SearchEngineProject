The epic poem Beowulf is to be made into a 13-part drama by ITV.

Described as a western set in the dark ages of Britain’s mythic past, the 
series will use locations in County Durham and Northumbria to represent the 
poem’s Scandinavian setting, and will deliver “epic fights, thrilling chases, 
raids, celebrations and battles”, following the eponymous hero’s battles with a 
monster and a dragon, adds to a burgeoning fantasy roster that includes Jekyll 
and Hyde and a Frankenstein series starring Sean Bean.

One of its co-creators, ITV’s creative director of drama, Tim Haines, has 
credits including the BBC documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs, which made 
extensive use of CGI special effects to recreate prehistoric landscapes and 
animals, and the fantasy drama Primeval.

Haines will work with Katie Newman, with whom he collaborated on Primeval, and 
writer James Dormer, whose credits include Wallander and Strike Back.

The critical and ratings success of Game of Thrones has prompted renewed 
interest in the fantasy drama genre from broadcasters. ITV is also making a 
10-part action adventure series, Jekyll and Hyde, written by the actor and 
comedian Charlie Higson. Set in 1930s London, the protagonist will be the 
grandson of the original doctor from Robert Louis Stevenson’s 19th-century tale.

Bean, who starred in the first series of Game of Thrones, will take the lead 
in the Frankenstein Chronicles, playing a police inspector in Regency London 
who stumbles across a corpse assembled from various bodies.
