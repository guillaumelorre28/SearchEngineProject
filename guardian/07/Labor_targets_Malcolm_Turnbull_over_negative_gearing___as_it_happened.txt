Good night and good luck

Well it is time to pull up the draw bridge for this parliamentary week. Thank 
you very much for your company through the madness – you’ve been magnificent.

Let’s wrap Thursday.

 * Today was defence white paper day. The government has committed to an 
$29.9bn increase in defence spending over the next decade, with most of the 
increased spend backend loaded after the forward estimates.

 * The government says the increase is required because Australia faces 
significant complexity in the strategic outlook – with threats ranging from 
increased competition between China and America for influence in the region, to 
terrorism, to cyber attacks, to climate change.

 * Labor continued to pursue the government over its various missteps this 
week about tax. In question time today, the prime minister refused to rule out 
retrospective changes to negative gearing, suggesting the government is still 
mulling its options on clawing back concessions, despite this week’s political 
attack on Labor’s policy. 
There was more, but that’s your main course.

Have a lovely weekend, and I’ll be back with all the madness of parliament 
next week.

A Senate committee has recommended criminalising the unauthorised sharing of 
intimate images, a practice known colloquially as revenge porn. In a report, it 
said that law enforcement should be able to prosecute individuals who take 
images without consent and the owners of websites that publish them. The 
Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions noted that existing legislation 
does not adequately address the problem, which is increasingly being used as a 
form of domestic violence. Government MPs on the committee broadly accepted the 
recommendations of the report, but said it was premature, noting that Coag is 
also looking at the issue.

As we begin to wind down for the afternoon, I need to pay a short but 
heartfelt tribute to my colleagueDaniel Hurst, who leaves our bureau today for 
a stint overseas. Regular readers of Guardian Australia don’t need me to tell 
them what a great journalist Daniel is, they know that through the quality of 
his work. What’s less obvious perhaps is Daniel has been absolutely central to 
our Canberra operation since he arrived in late 2013. He works like a slave, 
he’s a team player par excellence, he’s got a mind like a steel trap, he makes 
a million daily contributions to this blog, most acknowledged, but some 
completely unacknowledged. Daniel’s lightning fast contributions mostly serve 
to make me look much sharper than I am. I knowGabrielle Chan will feel exactly 
the same way, and will want me to make this a joint tribute, withMagic Mikearoo 
of course. Readers who love this blog and tune in regularly will also, I 
suspect, be quite happy to join in this salutation as well. So, Daniel, thank 
you. I don’t know what we’ll do without you, but we wish you only the best for 
the adventure ahead. Politics Live will miss you, and I will miss you.

Ah yes, here we go. In June last year, after a story was published by The 
Australian suggesting Australia was contemplating freedom of navigation 
exercises in the South China Sea, here is what the then defence minister’s 
office said.

A spokeswoman for the defence minister Kevin Andrews:

It is well known by all countries in the region that Australia has been 
patrolling the South China Sea from the air for over 30 years as part of 
Operation Gateway. We’ve been doing it on an ongoing basis since 1980 and will 
continue to in the future as part of Australia’s enduring contribution to the 
preservation of regional security and stability in South East Asia. The 
Australian government has not had formal talks with the United States on 
‘Freedom of Navigation’ missions in the South China Sea. Minister Andrews has 
met with Secretary Carter twice and the expansion of current operations or new 
missions in the South China Sea was not discussed. A safe region means a more 
safe and secure Australia and we will continue to a have a role in that regard.

(Yes, I know things have moved since then, but still worth pointing this out.)

Go early. Go hard. Kevin Andrews on the South China Sea.

Geopolitics, like nature, abhors a vacuum.

This burst of profundity is from the former defence minister Kevin Andrews, 
who has just be interviewed on Sky News. Andrews point this afternoon was 
essentially a criticism of the US – he basically said a failure of US 
leadership in the region has led to China becoming more aggressive in the South 
China Sea.

Andrews now thinks Australia should be conducting freedom of navigation 
exercises within the 12 mile radius. I don’t recall him suggesting this while 
he was the defence minister, in fact I have a vague memory of him hosing down a 
story which suggested the government was contemplating that as a course of 
action, but you know about vacuums, and how nature abhors them.

Now we are through that session, Zac has a question.
Zac Spitzer (@zackster) 
@murpharoo <https://twitter.com/murpharoo> can you explain to me what Turnbull 
is trying to say about the ALP policy?#qt 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/qt?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/zackster/status/702709265631346689> February 25, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/zackster/status/702709265631346689> 
Let’s step through this bit by bit.

Here’s Labor’s policy.

 * Labor will limit negative gearing to new housing from 1 July 2017. All 
investments made before this date will not be affected by this change and will 
be fully grandfathered. This will mean that taxpayers will continue to be able 
to deduct net rental losses against their wage income, providing the losses 
come from newly constructed housing.From 1 July 2017 losses from new 
investments in shares and existing properties can still be used to offset 
investment income tax liabilities. These losses can also continue to be carried 
forward to offset the final capital gain on the investment.

Turnbull’s point today was the structure of the policy means wealthy investors 
will be comparatively less stung than more modest investors. The prime minister 
was arguing that big investors, people with share portfolios as well as 
property, would be able still to offset higher net rental losses against their 
investment income under Labor’s policy. Where a more modest investor, someone 
with one investment property and no shares, would not be able to claim losses.

I’ll give you one of his answers.

Malcolm Turnbull:

What his policy is very clear about is that net rental losses can be offset 
against investment income. And the only people with very large – very large 
levels of investment income are obviously wealthier Australians.

So the consequence would be, as I said earlier, that a person with, say, an 
income of $90,000 under Labor’s plan would not be able to claim a net rental 
loss of $10,000, but somebody on a much higher income with, say $50,000 of 
income from dividends or interest on bonds, investment income, would be able to 
offset a much higher net rental loss against that.

Now, it’s up to the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> to explain why that is 
good policy, or why that is equitable. But on the face of it, Mr Speaker, I 
think most Australians would see that –would perceive that as being extremely 
discriminatory and benefitting disadvantaging the hundreds of thousands of 
people on middle incomes who are deducting net rental losses, disadvantaging 
them while leaving the deduction available to those on very high investment 
incomes.

I hope that helps to clarify the line of argument (which is different to his 
line of argument earlier in the week.)

The former defence minister Kevin Andrews is out stirring the pot. I need to 
keep pushing forward.

Over in the Senate, the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, has 
distanced himself from hisCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> colleague, Dennis 
Jensen’s comments relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people. As 
readers may recall, Jensen told parliament Indigenous people wanting to pursue 
a “noble savage” lifestyle choice should not expect government support. Labor 
asked Scullion in Senate question time if that view was shared by the minister. 
In short: no. “In this place those kinds of comments are usually referred to as 
unhelpful. And no, I do not support his comments in any way,” the minister said.

Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull

Q: In question time today the prime minister said and I quote: “Labor’s policy 
is so inequitable” ... but on Monday the prime minister described Labor’s 
negative gearing reforms as: “Soak the rich, politics of envy policy”. Prime 
minister, who is right? Monday Malcolm or Thursday Malcolm?

Malcolm Turnbull says you are the one with the contradictory policy, Bill.

Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull.

Q: Prime minister, there are Australians who have invested under current 
taxation laws with regard to negative gearing. Labor’s negative gearing reforms 
have guaranteed no retrospectivity. These investors want to know, so I ask 
again, will the prime minister now rule out his government making any 
retrospective changes to negative gearing?

Malcolm Turnbull

The government I lead will consider the economic challenges we face, the tax 
reforms required and do so in a way that will avoid administering the massive 
shock that theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> is proposing.

(So that’s two goes. Nothing ruled out.)

Well it is time to pull up the draw bridge for this parliamentary week. Thank 
you very much for your company through the madness – you’ve been magnificent.

Let’s wrap Thursday.

 * Today was defence white paper day. The government has committed to an 
$29.9bn increase in defence spending over the next decade, with most of the 
increased spend backend loaded after the forward estimates.

 * The government says the increase is required because Australia faces 
significant complexity in the strategic outlook – with threats ranging from 
increased competition between China and America for influence in the region, to 
terrorism, to cyber attacks, to climate change.

 * Labor continued to pursue the government over its various missteps this 
week about tax. In question time today, the prime minister refused to rule out 
retrospective changes to negative gearing, suggesting the government is still 
mulling its options on clawing back concessions, despite this week’s political 
attack on Labor’s policy. 
There was more, but that’s your main course.

Have a lovely weekend, and I’ll be back with all the madness of parliament 
next week.
 
A Senate committee has recommended criminalising the unauthorised sharing of 
intimate images, a practice known colloquially as revenge porn. In a report, it 
said that law enforcement should be able to prosecute individuals who take 
images without consent and the owners of websites that publish them. The 
Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions noted that existing legislation 
does not adequately address the problem, which is increasingly being used as a 
form of domestic violence. Government MPs on the committee broadly accepted the 
recommendations of the report, but said it was premature, noting that Coag is 
also looking at the issue.

As we begin to wind down for the afternoon, I need to pay a short but 
heartfelt tribute to my colleagueDaniel Hurst, who leaves our bureau today for 
a stint overseas. Regular readers of Guardian Australia don’t need me to tell 
them what a great journalist Daniel is, they know that through the quality of 
his work. What’s less obvious perhaps is Daniel has been absolutely central to 
our Canberra operation since he arrived in late 2013. He works like a slave, 
he’s a team player par excellence, he’s got a mind like a steel trap, he makes 
a million daily contributions to this blog, most acknowledged, but some 
completely unacknowledged. Daniel’s lightning fast contributions mostly serve 
to make me look much sharper than I am. I knowGabrielle Chan will feel exactly 
the same way, and will want me to make this a joint tribute, withMagic Mikearoo 
of course. Readers who love this blog and tune in regularly will also, I 
suspect, be quite happy to join in this salutation as well. So, Daniel, thank 
you. I don’t know what we’ll do without you, but we wish you only the best for 
the adventure ahead. Politics Live will miss you, and I will miss you.

Ah yes, here we go. In June last year, after a story was published by The 
Australian suggesting Australia was contemplating freedom of navigation 
exercises in the South China Sea, here is what the then defence minister’s 
office said.

A spokeswoman for the defence minister Kevin Andrews:

It is well known by all countries in the region that Australia has been 
patrolling the South China Sea from the air for over 30 years as part of 
Operation Gateway. We’ve been doing it on an ongoing basis since 1980 and will 
continue to in the future as part of Australia’s enduring contribution to the 
preservation of regional security and stability in South East Asia. The 
Australian government has not had formal talks with the United States on 
‘Freedom of Navigation’ missions in the South China Sea. Minister Andrews has 
met with Secretary Carter twice and the expansion of current operations or new 
missions in the South China Sea was not discussed. A safe region means a more 
safe and secure Australia and we will continue to a have a role in that regard.

(Yes, I know things have moved since then, but still worth pointing this out.) 

 
Geopolitics, like nature, abhors a vacuum.

This burst of profundity is from the former defence minister Kevin Andrews, 
who has just be interviewed on Sky News. Andrews point this afternoon was 
essentially a criticism of the US – he basically said a failure of US 
leadership in the region has led to China becoming more aggressive in the South 
China Sea.

Andrews now thinks Australia should be conducting freedom of navigation 
exercises within the 12 mile radius. I don’t recall him suggesting this while 
he was the defence minister, in fact I have a vague memory of him hosing down a 
story which suggested the government was contemplating that as a course of 
action, but you know about vacuums, and how nature abhors them.
 
Now we are through that session, Zac has a question.
Zac Spitzer (@zackster) 
@murpharoo <https://twitter.com/murpharoo> can you explain to me what Turnbull 
is trying to say about the ALP policy?#qt 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/qt?src=hash>

<https://twitter.com/zackster/status/702709265631346689> 
Let’s step through this bit by bit.

Here’s Labor’s policy.

 * Labor will limit negative gearing to new housing from 1 July 2017. All 
investments made before this date will not be affected by this change and will 
be fully grandfathered. This will mean that taxpayers will continue to be able 
to deduct net rental losses against their wage income, providing the losses 
come from newly constructed housing.From 1 July 2017 losses from new 
investments in shares and existing properties can still be used to offset 
investment income tax liabilities. These losses can also continue to be carried 
forward to offset the final capital gain on the investment.

Turnbull’s point today was the structure of the policy means wealthy investors 
will be comparatively less stung than more modest investors. The prime minister 
was arguing that big investors, people with share portfolios as well as 
property, would be able still to offset higher net rental losses against their 
investment income under Labor’s policy. Where a more modest investor, someone 
with one investment property and no shares, would not be able to claim losses.

I’ll give you one of his answers.

Malcolm Turnbull:

What his policy is very clear about is that net rental losses can be offset 
against investment income. And the only people with very large – very large 
levels of investment income are obviously wealthier Australians.

So the consequence would be, as I said earlier, that a person with, say, an 
income of $90,000 under Labor’s plan would not be able to claim a net rental 
loss of $10,000, but somebody on a much higher income with, say $50,000 of 
income from dividends or interest on bonds, investment income, would be able to 
offset a much higher net rental loss against that.

Now, it’s up to the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> to explain why that is 
good policy, or why that is equitable. But on the face of it, Mr Speaker, I 
think most Australians would see that –would perceive that as being extremely 
discriminatory and benefitting disadvantaging the hundreds of thousands of 
people on middle incomes who are deducting net rental losses, disadvantaging 
them while leaving the deduction available to those on very high investment 
incomes.

I hope that helps to clarify the line of argument (which is different to his 
line of argument earlier in the week.)

The former defence minister Kevin Andrews is out stirring the pot. I need to 
keep pushing forward.
 
Further questions have been placed on the notice paper. Let me scope out the 
landscape and come back shortly.
 
Over in the Senate, the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, has 
distanced himself from hisCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> colleague, Dennis 
Jensen’s comments relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people. As 
readers may recall, Jensen told parliament Indigenous people wanting to pursue 
a “noble savage” lifestyle choice should not expect government support. Labor 
asked Scullion in Senate question time if that view was shared by the minister. 
In short: no. “In this place those kinds of comments are usually referred to as 
unhelpful. And no, I do not support his comments in any way,” the minister said.
 
Faces of question time, part two.
