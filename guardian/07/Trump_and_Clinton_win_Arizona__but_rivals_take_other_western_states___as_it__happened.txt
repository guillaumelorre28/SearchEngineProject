What we learned in Arizona, Utah and Idaho

Sam Levin

The results are in for Arizona, Utah and Idaho after a long night of elections 
in the west. Frontrunners Donald Trump andHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> won key victories in the 
Arizona primary, bringing them both closer to the general election fight. But 
challengers Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders scored notable caucus wins in Utah, and 
the Vermont senator also nabbed a victory in the Idaho Democratic caucus (the 
GOP caucus, which happened at an earlier date, went to Cruz).

Here’s what we learned:

 * Mormons don’t like Trump as the huge loss in Utah and earlier loss in Idaho 
both clearly demonstrate. 
 * Utah could go blue for the first time in 50 years in part because the 
Mormons who backed Ted Cruz may choose Clinton over Trump in November. 
 * Despite his frontrunner status, Trump faces a long uphill battle to acquire 
the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. 
 * Sanders needs big upsets in the Democratic caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and 
Washington this month to make a notable dent in Clinton’s lead. 
 * Ohio governor John Kasich’s decision to remain in the race remains a 
problem for Cruz as the “anyone-but-Trump” GOP crowd continues to divide their 
money and support between the two. 
 * Trump thinks it’s a good tactic to attack Cruz’s wife, threatening on 
Twitter to “spill the beans” on her - yet another insult previously unthinkable 
in a presidential race. 
 * Cruz thinks that the US should secure and patrol Muslim neighborhoods to 
fight terrorism and Trump agrees it’s a good proposal (Kasich does not). 
 * Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio is toying with the possibility of 
a role in a Trump administration.

After remaining largely silent on their tough losses in Arizona, Bernie Sanders
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> and Ted Cruz are 
celebrating their late-night wins in Utah – and in Idaho for the Vermont 
senator.

Sanders said in a statement:

I am enormously grateful to the people of Utah and Idaho for the tremendous 
voter turnouts that gave us victories with extremely large margins. The 
impressive numbers of young people and working-class people who participated in 
the process are exactly what the political revolution is all about. These 
decisive victories inIdaho <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> and Utah 
give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming 
contests.

And Cruz used the Utah <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah> victory as a 
fundraising opportunity:
Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) 
Thank you Utah! Help us #CruzToVictory

Ted Cruz beats Donald Trump in Utah

Sam Levin

Ted Cruz won a much-needed victory against Donald Trump in the Utah caucus, the
AP reports <https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/712527597591216128>.

After an expected loss against the real estate billionaire in the high-stakes 
Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> primary, the Utah win for 
Cruz offers the Texas Senator a victory that can help keep his campaign alive 
as the GOP race inches closer to a contested convention.

There’s little doubt that the powerful Mormon vote in Utah played a big role 
in securing a win for Cruz here – in large part because many religious voters 
have expresseddistaste for Trump’s vulgar style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/21/utah-mormon-voters-anti-donald-trump-republican-caucuses>
 and bombastic statements on immigration.

The win for Cruz also signals big problems for Trump in the general election 
if he ultimately wins the nomination. Recent polls have shown that Utahns 
dislike Trump to such a great degree that the state could actually go blue in 
November – something that hasn’t happened in half a century. Both Bernie 
Sanders and Hillary Clinton would beat Trump in the general election, according 
toone poll 
<http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865650513/Poll-Utah-would-vote-for-a-Democrat-for-president-over-Trump.html>
.

Pundits say it could be very tough for a Republican presidential candidate to 
win the White House without the previously reliable red state ofUtah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah>.

At a Salt Lake City caucus site on Tuesday, Perri Flory, a 60-year-old retired 
police officer, criticized Mormons for backing Cruz, but said she was confident 
that Trump, her favorite candidate, would not be blocked from the nomination. 
Flory said she was thrilled to finally have a candidate speaking the truth on 
immigration: “Everyone who comes here should become a US citizen, and if you 
break the law, you need to pay for it.”

She added: “The Mormon state is not going to stop Trump.”

Bernie Sanders wins Idaho

Jason Wilson

Bernie Sanders has won a resounding victory 
<https://twitter.com/AP/status/712526024496513027> in Idaho tonight, as voters 
attended the Democrats’ open caucuses in record numbers.
The Associated Press (@AP) 
BREAKING: Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic caucuses in Idaho. @AP 
<https://twitter.com/AP> race call at 2:26 a.m. EDT. #Election2016 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Election2016?src=hash> #APracecall 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/APracecall?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/AP/status/712526024496513027> March 23, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/AP/status/712526024496513027> 
Sanders could claim most of the 23 Democratic delegates at stake. The win 
maintains his relative success in caucus states and those with large white 
majorities.

From the podium at the Boise Centre, Idaho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> Democrats claimed that it had been 
the biggest primary in US history, eclipsing even the landmark turnout in 2008 
for current president Barack Obama.

The biggest crowds were in Ada County, centered on the capital, Boise, where 
9,115 ballots were cast in the first round – 80% of them going Sanders’s way. 
There’s little doubt that Sanders himself was responsible for bringing 
Democrats out in large numbers. In the long queues waiting to enter the caucus 
venues, there were many first time voters, and many young people who had been 
energised by the Sanders campaign.

A young supporter, Jeff, attending his first caucus, said Sanders’ “integrity, 
his passions, his motivations make you want to get involved in the process.”

Others were motivated by their fear of the Republican alternatives.

The Idaho <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> caucuses are finally 
winding down after a night of extraordinary turnout, according to Democratic 
leaders. Jason Wilson reports:

In Boise, people are starting to drift out of the caucus venue, having been 
told that if they don’t want to change their vote, it will remain as cast. 
Volunteers are still counting ballots, and no announcements have been made.

The large turnout has led to inevitable delays - in getting in, and getting 
ballots counted.

Some caucus-goers have been in queues and waiting in the venue for six hours 
or more. Not everyone can afford that on a Tuesday night.

Alissa Taysum, for one, had to wheel her toddler home in a stroller. But she 
wasn’t disappointed to leave before she knew the result.

“I’m actually really excited that this many people showed up, it’s exciting.” 
She was satisfied that her vote forBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> would stick.

One voter, Lisa, said she had to support the candidate with the most 
experience:Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
.

“I used to live inside the Beltway. My husband used to work inside the 
Beltway. She understands the big picture. I don’t think he does in the same 
way. She could come into office and be effective immediately, on day one.”

The Ted Cruz campaign is trying to remain optimistic in the face of what is 
shaping up to be a tough loss againstDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in Arizona. Here’s Jeff Roe, 
Cruz campaign manager:
Jeff Roe (@jeffroe) 
At the risk of going full Rove here, stay tuned to AZ. We will lose but not 
anywhere close to current margin and watch election day vote %.

<https://twitter.com/jeffroe/status/712488624999141377> 
So far, Cruz appears to be far behind Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/22/arizona-idaho-utah-election-results-primaries-caucuses-live>
, though he may have some good news coming out of Utah shortly.

Late Tuesday evening, Cruz did receive the endorsement of the Club for Growth

Jeb Lund

As we wait for the Idaho <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> and Utah 
results to come in,Jeb Lund is fascinated by the ways talking heads kill dead 
time


Here’s the fun thing about watching the 24-hour news analysts when they don’t 
have a result: you get to watch the same anxiety over major decisions that we 
go through for days get played out in high speed.

What did we know before the polls closed? Trump wins Arizona, Cruz wins 
everything else, Clinton winsArizona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona>, the others are a tossup. Probably
. But the more time there is to fill, the more second-guessing we can go 
through.


So we go through Trump’s negatives. Or we talk about the size of Sanders’ 
rallies and how eventually the word on him will get out to voters, despite the 
negative, chiding verbal gatekeeping of the mainstream media.

Bernie Sanders rallies

Meanwhile, appearing at a rally in San Diego, Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> did not immediately 
mention the tough loss in Arizona, instead focusing on his expected wins in 
Utah and Idaho.
“We have now won ten primaries and caucuses,” a hoarse-sounding Sanders told 
supporters. “And unless I’m mistaken we’re going to win a couple more tonight.”

Here’s a snapshot of the crowd:

Hillary Clinton takes the stage

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, in 
Washington, is taking swings at Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in her victory speech 
following a win in the Arizona primary:

“The last thing we need, my friends, are leaders who incite more fear. In the 
face of terror, America doesn’t panic. We don’t build walls or turn our backs 
on our allies. We can’t throw out everything we know about what works and what 
doesn’t and start torturing people. WhatDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Ted Cruz and others are 
suggesting is not only wrong, it’s dangerous. It will not keep us safe. This is 
a time for America to lead, not cower, and we will lead...

We have to dismantle the global terror pipeline. We have to strengthen our 
defenses here at home and we need to work closely with our allies ... This 
election really matters.


We need to keep working together. We need to make a point that we’re going 
into the future with confidence and optimism.”

I am the most ready of everybody running to take that job.”

Jeb Lund

Jeb Lund reacts to the Hillary Clinton’s win and asks what else Democrats can 
expect tonight


The big question of the night was the Arizona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> primary, where Sanders dropped 
$1.3m compared to Clinton’s $600,000, to try to combat her seemingly default 
advantage among minority voters.


That question has now been answered. So what about the rest of the night?


Bernie Sanders was leading Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in Utah according to the 
last poll, although those polls have flipped in the past. He could also be 
leading in Idaho. Those states could go either way without it being a surprise, 
in part because nobody seems to want to waste a lot of money on polling there.


Meanwhile, as was the case with the Republican contest, the road to the DNC 
seems certain. Hillary Clinton’s legacy and the Democratic Party machine’s 
support and the mainstream media’s reflexive dismissal ofBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> still makes her the 
prohibitive favorite, and the question is how he plans to use his public 
acclaim and apportioned delegates to influence the future of the Democratic 
Party.

What the wins in Arizona mean for Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump and 
their challengers hoping to gain traction in the race:

The Grand Canyon State is the largest purely winner-takes-all state left in 
the Republican calendar and is an important stepping stone, in particular, for 
Trump, who despite his frontrunner status faces a long, drawn-out slog to 
acquire the 1,237 delegates needed to become the GOP nominee.

The effort to block Trump from securing the Republican ticket rests on 
preventing him from meeting that necessary delegate threshold, a move that 
would force the billionaire to make the case for his presidencyin a contested 
convention 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/republican-party-contested-convention-trump-cruz-rubio-delegates>
 where party elites, many of whom who are hostile to his candidacy, could hold 
sway.

Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> is less significant in 
the Democratic race, in which delegates are apportioned proportionately, and in 
which there are another seven states with larger tallies of delegates available 
before the party convention.

Trump and Clinton inch closer to nomination with wins in Arizona

Trump wins Arizona

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> beat Ted Cruz 
in the Arizona primary, the Associated Press has just reported:

It’s a tough loss for Cruz, though not a surprising one, and the win further 
cements Trump’s frontrunner status in the Republican race.

Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> has 58 Republican

Sam Levin reports on the GOP voters in Utah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah> who really despise Donald Trump:

Brad Hansen, a 50-year-old Salt Lake City accountant, stood before a precinct 
of several dozen Republicans, expressing an anti-Trump sentiment that seems 
common among conservative Utahns here.

“We oughta build a wall around Trump and make him pay for it,” he said, adding 
that he didn’t know too much aboutJohn Kasich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich>, but that it seemed like the 
Ohio governor was the only reasonable choice.

<https://twitter.com/SamTLevin/status/712470298713391104> 
Hansen told the Guardian: “I want to be represented by someone that is civil 
and human. When Trump gets cornered, he gets angry. He’s never been a real 
businessman. He’s never been anything he purports to be.”

“I really think he started to run as a joke, and it morphed into something big 
and now he wants to see how long he can play the Americans ... He hasn’t come 
up with any ideas.”

He said he needs to do more research on Kasich’s policies, but that he 
couldn’t imagine voting for anyone else at this point.

Donald Trump’s Twitter threat to “spill the beans” on the wife of Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> came just minutes before polls 
closed in Arizona and a few hours ahead of results from Utah.

The tweet, which threatened Cruz and his wife over a Facebook ad run by an 
anti-Trump Super Pac unrelated to the Texas senator, came as expectations were 
growing that Trump might underperform and as his response to the terrorist 
attacks in Brussels has drawn major criticism.

The ad, targeted only to female members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter Day Saints inUtah <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah>, featured a 
nude picture of a Trump’s now-wife, Melania Trump, from a photoshoot for GQ in 
2000. The frontrunner’s wife is lying on her front, so the image does not show 
her fully naked.

The ad had a caption suggesting voters back Cruz lest Trump become the next 
first lady. “Meet Melania Trump. Your Next First Lady,” it said. “Or, You Could 
Support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.”

(Editors decided to remove a version of the ad from this blog, but the image 
is widely available on the internet, andcan be viewed here 
<http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/anti-trump-group-runs-facebook-ads-seeking-to-rally-mormon-v#.cvKO00lOWk>
.)

Trump claimed the ad, targeted only in Utah where anti-Trump forces are hoping 
that Ted Cruz reach the 50% threshold needed for him to win all the state’s 
delegates, was a personal attack from Texas senator.

Cruz quickly took to Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/712464268621385728> to respond, writing: 
“Pic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you’re more 
of a coward than I thought. #classless?

From Trump’s perspective, the spat also serves a distraction from what may be 
a less than stellar night for Trump. While the Republican frontrunner is 
expected to win Arizona’s primary, it may be, by far, less than expected. One 
of the major reasons that Trump is expected to win is that Arizona’s loose 
early voting laws meant that a majority of the electorate voted before Tuesday 
and many anti-Trump voters cast their ballots for Marco Rubio before he dropped 
out. However, Cruz held campaign events in the state on Sunday and may be able 
to trim the margin.

Trump has also suffered from an off-key response to the massive terrorist 
attacks in Brussels on Tuesday. They came just one day after the Republican 
frontrunner called for the US to play a significantly smaller role in Nato, 
which is headquartered in Brussels and also flip-flopped yet again on sending 
ground troops to fight Isis. In response to the attack, Trump reaffirmed his 
support for torture and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States 
while standing by his skepticism of Nato.

The results are in for Arizona, Utah and Idaho after a long night of elections 
in the west. Frontrunners Donald Trump andHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> won key victories in the 
Arizona primary, bringing them both closer to the general election fight. But 
challengers Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders scored notable caucus wins in Utah, and 
the Vermont senator also nabbed a victory in the Idaho Democratic caucus (the 
GOP caucus, which happened at an earlier date, went to Cruz).

Here’s what we learned:

 * Mormons don’t like Trump as the huge loss in Utah and earlier loss in Idaho 
both clearly demonstrate. 
 * Utah could go blue for the first time in 50 years in part because the 
Mormons who backed Ted Cruz may choose Clinton over Trump in November. 
 * Despite his frontrunner status, Trump faces a long uphill battle to acquire 
the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. 
 * Sanders needs big upsets in the Democratic caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and 
Washington this month to make a notable dent in Clinton’s lead. 
 * Ohio governor John Kasich’s decision to remain in the race remains a 
problem for Cruz as the “anyone-but-Trump” GOP crowd continues to divide their 
money and support between the two. 
 * Trump thinks it’s a good tactic to attack Cruz’s wife, threatening on 
Twitter to “spill the beans” on her - yet another insult previously unthinkable 
in a presidential race. 
 * Cruz thinks that the US should secure and patrol Muslim neighborhoods to 
fight terrorism and Trump agrees it’s a good proposal (Kasich does not). 
 * Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio is toying with the possibility of 
a role in a Trump administration.  
After remaining largely silent on their tough losses in Arizona, Bernie Sanders
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> and Ted Cruz are 
celebrating their late-night wins in Utah – and in Idaho for the Vermont 
senator.

Sanders said in a statement:

I am enormously grateful to the people of Utah and Idaho for the tremendous 
voter turnouts that gave us victories with extremely large margins. The 
impressive numbers of young people and working-class people who participated in 
the process are exactly what the political revolution is all about. These 
decisive victories inIdaho <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> and Utah 
give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming 
contests.

And Cruz used the Utah <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah> victory as a 
fundraising opportunity:
Ted Cruz (@tedcruz)

The AP also reports that Ted Cruz is on track to win 50% of the vote in Utah, 
which would earn him all 40 delegates in the state – a significant blow to
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as the two head

After an expected loss against the real estate billionaire in the high-stakes 
Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> primary, the Utah win for 
Cruz offers the Texas Senator a victory that can help keep his campaign alive 
as the GOP race inches closer to a contested convention.

There’s little doubt that the powerful Mormon vote in Utah played a big role 
in securing a win for Cruz here – in large part because many religious voters 
have expresseddistaste for Trump’s vulgar style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/21/utah-mormon-voters-anti-donald-trump-republican-caucuses>
 and bombastic statements on immigration.

The win for Cruz also signals big problems for Trump in the general election 
if he ultimately wins the nomination. Recent polls have shown that Utahns 
dislike Trump to such a great degree that the state could actually go blue in 
November – something that hasn’t happened in half a century. Both Bernie 
Sanders and Hillary Clinton would beat Trump in the general election, according 
toone poll 
<http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865650513/Poll-Utah-would-vote-for-a-Democrat-for-president-over-Trump.html>
.

Pundits say it could be very tough for a Republican presidential candidate to 
win the White House without the previously reliable red state ofUtah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah>.

At a Salt Lake City caucus site on Tuesday, Perri Flory, a 60-year-old retired 
police officer, criticized Mormons for backing Cruz, but said she was confident 
that Trump, her favorite candidate, would not be blocked from the nomination. 
Flory said she was thrilled to finally have a candidate speaking the truth on 
immigration: “Everyone who comes here should become a US citizen, and if you 
break the law, you need to pay for it.”

She added: “The Mormon state is not going to stop Trump.”
 
Bernie Sanders has won a resounding victory 
<https://twitter.com/AP/status/712526024496513027> in Idaho tonight, as voters 
attended the Democrats’ open caucuses in record numbers.

<https://twitter.com/AP/status/712526024496513027> 
Sanders could claim most of the 23 Democratic delegates at stake. The win 
maintains his relative success in caucus states and those with large white 
majorities.

From the podium at the Boise Centre, Idaho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> Democrats claimed that it had been 
the biggest primary in US history, eclipsing even the landmark turnout in 2008 
for current president Barack Obama.

The biggest crowds were in Ada County, centered on the capital, Boise, where 
9,115 ballots were cast in the first round – 80% of them going Sanders’s way. 
There’s little doubt that Sanders himself was responsible for bringing 
Democrats out in large numbers. In the long queues waiting to enter the caucus 
venues, there were many first time voters, and many young people who had been 
energised by the Sanders campaign.

A young supporter, Jeff, attending his first caucus, said Sanders’ “integrity, 
his passions, his motivations make you want to get involved in the process.”

Others were motivated by their fear of the Republican alternatives.

The victory provided a nice boost to Sanders who suffered yet another loss to 
Clinton inArizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> earlier in the 
night.

Results in the Democratic caucus in Idaho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> – where Sanders could secure 
another win – are still pending. Earlier, Sanders told a large crowd in San 
Diego, “Unless I’m mistaken we’re going to win a couple more tonight.”
 
The Idaho <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> caucuses are finally 
winding down after a night of extraordinary turnout, according to Democratic 
leaders. Jason Wilson reports:

In Boise, people are starting to drift out of the caucus venue, having been 
told that if they don’t want to change their vote, it will remain as cast. 
Volunteers are still counting ballots, and no announcements have been made.

The large turnout has led to inevitable delays - in getting in, and getting 
ballots counted.

Some caucus-goers have been in queues and waiting in the venue for six hours 
or more. Not everyone can afford that on a Tuesday night.

Alissa Taysum, for one, had to wheel her toddler home in a stroller. But she 
wasn’t disappointed to leave before she knew the result.

“I’m actually really excited that this many people showed up, it’s exciting.” 
She was satisfied that her vote forBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> would stick.

One voter, Lisa, said she had to support the candidate with the most 
experience:Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
.

“I used to live inside the Beltway. My husband used to work inside the 
Beltway. She understands the big picture. I don’t think he does in the same 
way. She could come into office and be effective immediately, on day one.”

, though he may have some good news coming out of Utah shortly.

As we wait for the Idaho <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> and Utah 
results to come in,Jeb Lund is fascinated by the ways talking heads kill dead 
time


Here’s the fun thing about watching the 24-hour news analysts when they don’t 
have a result: you get to watch the same anxiety over major decisions that we 
go through for days get played out in high speed.

What did we know before the polls closed? Trump wins Arizona, Cruz wins 
everything else, Clinton winsArizona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona>, the others are a tossup. Probably
. But the more time there is to fill, the more second-guessing we can go 
through.


So we go through Trump’s negatives. Or we talk about the size of Sanders’ 
rallies and how eventually the word on him will get out to voters, despite the 
negative, chiding verbal gatekeeping of the mainstream media.

 
Meanwhile, appearing at a rally in San Diego, Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> did not immediately 
mention the tough loss in Arizona, instead focusing on his expected wins in 
Utah and Idaho.
“We have now won ten primaries and caucuses,” a hoarse-sounding Sanders told 
supporters. “And unless I’m mistaken we’re going to win a couple more tonight.”

Here’s a snapshot of the crowd:

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, in 
Washington, is taking swings at Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in her victory speech 
following a win in the Arizona primary:

“The last thing we need, my friends, are leaders who incite more fear. In the 
face of terror, America doesn’t panic. We don’t build walls or turn our backs 
on our allies. We can’t throw out everything we know about what works and what 
doesn’t and start torturing people. WhatDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Ted Cruz and others are 
suggesting is not only wrong, it’s dangerous. It will not keep us safe. This is 
a time for America to lead, not cower, and we will lead...

We have to dismantle the global terror pipeline. We have to strengthen our 
defenses here at home and we need to work closely with our allies ... This 
election really matters.


We need to keep working together. We need to make a point that we’re going 
into the future with confidence and optimism.”

I am the most ready of everybody running to take that job.” 
 
Jeb Lund reacts to the Hillary Clinton’s win and asks what else Democrats can 
expect tonight


The big question of the night was the Arizona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> primary, where Sanders dropped 
$1.3m compared to Clinton’s $600,000, to try to combat her seemingly default 
advantage among minority voters.


That question has now been answered. So what about the rest of the night?


Bernie Sanders was leading Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in Utah according to the 
last poll, although those polls have flipped in the past. He could also be 
leading in Idaho. Those states could go either way without it being a surprise, 
in part because nobody seems to want to waste a lot of money on polling there.


Meanwhile, as was the case with the Republican contest, the road to the DNC 
seems certain. Hillary Clinton’s legacy and the Democratic Party machine’s 
support and the mainstream media’s reflexive dismissal ofBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> still makes her the 
prohibitive favorite, and the question is how he plans to use his public 
acclaim and apportioned delegates to influence the future of the Democratic 
Party.
 
What the wins in Arizona mean for Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump and 
their challengers hoping to gain traction in the race:

The Grand Canyon State is the largest purely winner-takes-all state left in 
the Republican calendar and is an important stepping stone, in particular, for 
Trump, who despite his frontrunner status faces a long, drawn-out slog to 
acquire the 1,237 delegates needed to become the GOP nominee.

The effort to block Trump from securing the Republican ticket rests on 
preventing him from meeting that necessary delegate threshold, a move that 
would force the billionaire to make the case for his presidencyin a contested 
convention 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/republican-party-contested-convention-trump-cruz-rubio-delegates>
 where party elites, many of whom who are hostile to his candidacy, could hold 
sway.

Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> is less significant in 
the Democratic race, in which delegates are apportioned proportionately, and in 
which there are another seven states with larger tallies of delegates available 
before the party convention.

Utah andIdaho <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/idaho> all the more critical 
for Sanders.

It’s a tough loss for Cruz, though not a surprising one, and the win further 
cements Trump’s frontrunner status in the Republican race.

Arizona <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona> has 58 Republican 
delegates.
 
Sam Levin reports on the GOP voters in Utah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah> who really despise Donald Trump:

Brad Hansen, a 50-year-old Salt Lake City accountant, stood before a precinct 
of several dozen Republicans, expressing an anti-Trump sentiment that seems 
common among conservative Utahns here.

“We oughta build a wall around Trump and make him pay for it,” he said, adding 
that he didn’t know too much aboutJohn Kasich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich>, but that it seemed like the 
Ohio governor was the only reasonable choice.

Hansen told the Guardian: “I want to be represented by someone that is civil 
and human. When Trump gets cornered, he gets angry. He’s never been a real 
businessman. He’s never been anything he purports to be.”

“I really think he started to run as a joke, and it morphed into something big 
and now he wants to see how long he can play the Americans ... He hasn’t come 
up with any ideas.”

He said he needs to do more research on Kasich’s policies, but that he 
couldn’t imagine voting for anyone else at this point.

Donald Trump’s Twitter threat to “spill the beans” on the wife of Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> came just minutes before polls 
closed in Arizona and a few hours ahead of results from Utah.

The tweet, which threatened Cruz and his wife over a Facebook ad run by an 
anti-Trump Super Pac unrelated to the Texas senator, came as expectations were 
growing that Trump might underperform and as his response to the terrorist 
attacks in Brussels has drawn major criticism.

The ad, targeted only to female members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter Day Saints inUtah <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah>, featured a 
nude picture of a Trump’s now-wife, Melania Trump, from a photoshoot for GQ in 
2000. The frontrunner’s wife is lying on her front, so the image does not show 
her fully naked.

The ad had a caption suggesting voters back Cruz lest Trump become the next 
first lady. “Meet Melania Trump. Your Next First Lady,” it said. “Or, You Could 
Support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.”

(Editors decided to remove a version of the ad from this blog, but the image 
is widely available on the internet, andcan be viewed here 
<http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/anti-trump-group-runs-facebook-ads-seeking-to-rally-mormon-v#.cvKO00lOWk>
.)

Trump claimed the ad, targeted only in Utah where anti-Trump forces are hoping 
that Ted Cruz reach the 50% threshold needed for him to win all the state’s 
delegates, was a personal attack from Texas senator.

Cruz quickly took to Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/712464268621385728> to respond, writing: 
“Pic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you’re more 
of a coward than I thought. #classless?

From Trump’s perspective, the spat also serves a distraction from what may be 
a less than stellar night for Trump. While the Republican frontrunner is 
expected to win Arizona’s primary, it may be, by far, less than expected. One 
of the major reasons that Trump is expected to win is that Arizona’s loose 
early voting laws meant that a majority of the electorate voted before Tuesday 
and many anti-Trump voters cast their ballots for Marco Rubio before he dropped 
out. However, Cruz held campaign events in the state on Sunday and may be able 
to trim the margin.

Trump has also suffered from an off-key response to the massive terrorist 
attacks in Brussels on Tuesday. They came just one day after the Republican 
frontrunner called for the US to play a significantly smaller role in Nato, 
which is headquartered in Brussels and also flip-flopped yet again on sending 
ground troops to fight Isis. In response to the attack, Trump reaffirmed his 
support for torture and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States 
while standing by his skepticism of Nato.
