With pop culture crushing hard on all things 80s, it was only a matter of time 
before MTV came up. Music Television launched in August 1981, with the logo 
transferred on to the flag on the moon. The implication? The age of the video 
had began. The channel went on to air classics likeThriller 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA> and Like a Prayer 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79fzeNUqQbQ>, before the internet happened and 
arguably killed the video stars, or at least wounded them. That logo is now 
iconic of a golden age of music videos and other awesome things like House of 
Style. If, now, the channel is all Geordie Shore gossip and animal listicles, 
the 25th anniversary provides an excellent excuse to look back to its 80s 
roots. EnterMarc Jacobs <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/marc-jacobs>, a 
designer who knows how to turn an 80s pop reference into clothes you want now, 
now, now. This sweatshirt – with the MTV logo rendered with the kind of 
patterns usually reserved for bedding in 1983 – is a case in point. It’s poppy, 
bright, and slots into a world where shows likeStranger Things 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/29/stylewatch-barb-from-stranger-things>
, Halt and Catch Fire andDeutschland 83 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/04/fashion-in-deutschland-83>
 are on repeat. Stick with these, and avoid Geordie Shore, and your MTV 
references will be the right ones for fashion in 2016.
