This may make painful reading after the excesses of Christmas but we are, on 
average, 3st heavier than we were in the 1960s – and not because we're eating 
more or exercising less. The most-read story on the business site last year 
showed how the food industry has super-sized the global population and turned 
us into sugar addicts.

2. $21tn: hoard hidden from taxman by global elite

Public anger over tax avoidance was one of the key themes of 2012 and Observer 
business editor Heather Stewart's story on the huge riches amassed by a global 
super-rich elite really struck a chord. Exploiting gaps in cross-border tax 
rules, they managed to hide an extraordinary £13 trillion ($21tn) of wealth 
offshore – as much as American and Japanese GDPs put together, according to 
research commissioned by the campaign group Tax Justice Network.

3. It's payback time: don't expect sympathy – Lagarde to Greeks

In May, IMF chief Christine Lagarde chose an interview with the Guardian's 
Decca Aitkenhead to rachet up the pressure on crisis-hit Greece, declaring she 
had more sympathy for children deprived of decent schooling in sub-Saharan 
Africa than for many of those facing poverty in Athens. Using some of the 
bluntest language yet seen in the crisis, Lagarde insisted it was payback time 
for Greece. The story sparked a fierce debate among readers, generating more 
than 3,200 comments.

4. GM profits slip 41% as European struggles take their toll

Dominic Rushe's story on plunging profits at General Motors was our fourth 
most popular story last year. The 41% drop in the second quarter underlined the 
knock-on effect of the European crisis on the US economy, which at that point 
was still doing pretty well.

5. Cost of Greek exit from euro put at $1tn

There are 12 noughts in a trillion and in May that was the truly scary 
estimate of the cost to the EU of Greece making a disorderly exit from the 
currency. The British government was said to be making urgent preparations to 
cope with the fallout of a possible Greek exit from the single currency, after 
the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, warned Europe was 
"tearing itself apart". Reports from Athens, meanwhile, said massive sums of 
money were being spirited out of the country.

6. Krugman: 'I'm sick of being Cassandra. I'd like to win for once'

In an interview with Decca Aitkenhead, the American Nobel prize-winning 
economist Paul Krugman outlined his strategy to end the financial crisis – 
ditch austerity, kickstart the economy with ambitious government spending, and 
bring down the deficit when we're back above water again. Most important of 
all, do it now. That was in June. The undisputed Cassandra of academia, Krugman 
joked: "I'm kind of sick of being Cassandra. I'd like to actually win for once, 
instead of being vindicated by the disaster coming – as predicted."

7. Bob Diamond resigns from Barclays – live

Shortly after 7.30am on Tuesday 3 July, Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond 
resigned. His abrupt departure, just six days after the bank was fined £59.5m 
for attempting to manipulate the Libor rate, send shockwaves through the City. 
Our eurocrisis expert Graeme Wearden leapt into action with a live blog 
rounding up all the political and City reaction, as well as the hastily 
arranged Barclays press conference. Diamond blamed the 'external pressure' that 
had build up on Barclays, as MPs called for his resignation and the government 
announced an inquiry into the affair. His departure was followed within hours 
by that of Jerry del Missier, one of Diamond's key allies.

8. Wealth doesn't trickle down – it just floods offshore

A second entry in the Top 10 for Heather Stewart and the $21tn in assets 
estimated to have been lost to global tax havens. This more detailed article 
based on research for the Tax Justice Network campaign group constructs an 
alarming picture of capital flooding out of countries across the world and 
disappearing into cracks in the financial system, with the world's super-rich 
siphoning off at least $21tn, and possibly as much as $32tn, from their home 
countries to hide abroad.

9. Eurozone crisis live: Markets slide as Greek euro exit looms

Graeme Wearden tirelessly charted the twists and turns of the eurozone crisis 
in his daily blog – and 14 May was one of the darkest days of 2012, when Greece 
looked odds-on to quit the eurozone. Shares slid and the euro tumbled after a 
Greek general election which failed to deliver a clear winner. Amid the 
political paralysis, rumours swept the City that Greece was close to running 
out of money. A June default looked a real risk.

10. Dare nine men defy the siren call of Christine Lagarde?

Preview pieces on whether the Bank of England will extend its quantitative 
easing programme don't generally provide excitement, but perhaps it was the 
vision of Christine Lagarde as a siren that did the trick. Whatever the reason, 
Simon Goodley's piece on the June MPC meeting was our 10th most-read story of 
the year. The IMF chief had earlier urged the UK to make further interest rate 
cuts and create more electronic money. "Surely the Bank's nonet of middle-aged 
men wouldn't consider frustrating the French temptress?" Goodley asked. They 
did.
