stands in front of the camera, waiting for instruction. Tall and long-legged, 
she is wearing a tight pink leotard, with her hair scraped back from her face 
and a flick of gold liner framing her eyes. “Try this,” says rehearsal director
Angela Towler <http://www.rambert.org.uk/about-us/people/rehearsal-director/>, 
circling the air with her finger. Sojourna nods and tips forward, 
cantilever-like, on one leg. Three dancers surround her in a semicircle. Her 
fingers touch the floor and she stops, bent like an upended swan. The dancers 
whisper approvingly, “Yes, Kym” and she holds her pose. That’s the money shot.

It’s a warm day and eight dancers are spinning, leaping and falling in this 
season’s block-colour athleisure (or underwear: the boundaries are blurred). 
There is the constant sound of limbs cracking on the floor. Some move with 
balletic grace; others make more staccato, contemporary movements. Disparate in 
terms of technique and background, and with 20 years between them – Towler is 
42, Sojourna 23 – they are all part ofthe Rambert dance company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rambertdancecompany>, which this year turns 
90.

A contemporary outfit with a ballet core, Rambert tours almost year round, 
with a big outreach programme and a school that has taught famous performers 
fromAudrey Hepburn <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/audrey-hepburn> to 
Vanessa Redgrave <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/vanessa-redgrave>, as 
well as choreographers such asFrederick Ashton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/frederickashton> and Christopher Bruce 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bruce>. Its peer, English National 
Ballet <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/english-national-ballet> (ENB), is 
five years its junior, though any rivalry between the two companies is 
manufactured, Rambert’s artistic directorMark Baldwin 
<http://www.rambert.org.uk/about-us/people/mark-baldwin-artistic-director/> 
tells me. “I am good friends withTamara [Rojo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tamara-rojo>, ENB’s artistic director].” But 
when I ask whether Rojo’s introduction of more contemporary work treads on 
Rambert toes, he is diplomatic. “Each to their own, of course, although I will 
say you need 90 years’ experience to do what we do. Still, it’s good – the 
more, the merrier.”

The first thing you notice at a Rambert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rambert> performance is the sheer range of 
dancers: black, white, short, tall, muscular, lean; all shapes, all sizes. It 
figures: what works in samba, body-wise, might not work in ballet, and 
Rambert’s dancers are chosen for their different strengths. I sit in on a 
morning rehearsal in their giant modernist studio on London’s South Bank. They 
are focusing on barre work and it’s clear that, even at this stage in their 
careers, some find ballet easier than others. The aim is to harness this 
diversity – of technique, but also, importantly, of race. “We are 41% diverse,” 
Baldwin explains, “but that figure often goes unnoticed.” He hopes to better 
the ratio to 50% by the time he leaves.

Rambert dancers such as Dane Hurst 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/08/dancing-out-of-poverty-in-south-africa>
 are not yet stars such asCarlos Acosta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/acosta> or Misty Copeland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/30/misty-copeland-success-ballet-right-direction>
, but Baldwin predicts he will be. Hurst grew up in South Africa under 
apartheid. His grandmother made costumes for the local dance school, and he 
learned ballet from a teacher who ignored segregation to teach in Gelvandale, a 
designated “coloured” area. “Ballet was an elitist thing,” Hurst, now 32, tells 
me. “Kids from my background couldn’t afford to do it properly. It’s only 
recently that people of different colour, shape and background have been able 
to pursue this sort of career.” With financial help, he came to Rambert at 18, 
as an apprentice, and lived “like a student – very happily”. (Rambert is one of 
the few companies that pays its apprentices.) Baldwin resurrected the 
100-year-old Afternoon Of A Faun, scored byDebussy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/claude-debussy>, especially for Hurst, who 
went on to winmale dancer of the year in 2014

Rambert has 22 performers <http://www.rambert.org.uk/about-us/people/dancers/> 
– 20 core, two apprentices – and operates a flat structure in the sense that 
there are no stars: newcomers can lead, with veterans in the chorus, and then 
switch back again.Daniel Davidson 
<http://www.rambert.org.uk/about-us/people/dancers/daniel-davidson/>, 31, is 
lean, sharp-eyed and one of the company’s oldest performers. He, too, benefited 
from grants and scholarships, moving from ballet class in his local church to
Scottish Ballet <https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/> and eventually to Rambert. 
His mother had three jobs, and he worked nights in a bar while dancing in the 
day. “The industry is hard, especially for men,” he says, “but equality has 
improved modern dance.”

doing street dance before joiningThe X Factor

What do the dancers make of the clothes they are modelling, which are skimpy 
and slinky? “This is the sort of thing I rehearse in,” Francis says. “I like to 
be able to move, to feel casual. I sweat a bit, too, so you have to be careful 
with what colour you wear.” Another dancer in American Apparel looks in the 
mirror and adjusts her outfit: “I feel like a sluttySimone Biles

The Rambert day is nine hours, divided into chunks: 90 minutes of class, a 
15-minute break, class, lunch, class, break and class for a final hour, then 
out by 6pm. The physical toll is inevitable. Towler recently had a hip 
replacement – “shallow sockets,” she smiles, pointing to her hips. She used to 
dance in the company, but is now a rehearsal director. “I just never wanted to 
leave. This place, it’s like a family: everyone looks out for each other. It’s 
not competitive.”

Sojourna is one of Rambert’s newest members. She attended the school from the 
age of eight (around five graduates join every season) and seems almost 
Pollyanna-ish when she talks about dance: “I am never happier than when I’m 
dancing.” But she also has a life: “I drink, red wine, maybe too much. I live 
with two drag queens and we sometimes put on performances together.” She eats 
Haribo by the bag and cooks a decent bolognese.

The Rambert company dates back to 1914, when Polish-born Marie Rambert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2013/may/23/long-forgotten-rambert-modern-dance-in-pictures>
 arrived in London fleeing the war. She began choreographing and teaching just 
a couple of years later, and in 1926 her dancers started performing as an 
official company. Its first proper show was a groundbreaking moment – foreign 
art being performed on English soil - and Rambert became a star in her own 
right, dancing in the 1948 filmThe Red Shoes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/08/my-favourite-film-red-shoes>
 and teaching Hepburn, who lived with her for a period.

Over the years, each new artistic director has nudged things in a different 
stylistic direction, which has sometimes been divisive. Baldwin, the current 
incumbent, has a conceptual, radical style, and describes his creative process 
as “looking into a hole and grabbing whichever thing comes first”. He is drawn 
to unlikely collaborators: in the 1980s, he worked with fashion designers
Katharine Hamnett <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/katharine-hamnett> and 
John Galliano <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/john-galliano>; more 
recently there has beenAnish Kapoor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kapoor> and Radiohead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead> drummer Philip Selway. These 
collaborations bring in new audiences and revenue; in just over a decade, 
Baldwin has raised £19.5m, helping save the company and open theRIBA 
award-winning HQ 
<http://www.rambert.org.uk/explore/news-and-blog/news/ramberts-new-home-wins-riba-national-award-2014/>
 it now calls home. Baldwin cites his work with Selway (“a very cool guy”) and 
the painterGerhard Richter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gerhard-richter> on a forthcoming 
anniversary performance,Rambert Event 
<http://www.rambert.org.uk/performances/rambert-event/> (a restaging of Merce 
Cunningham <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mercecunningham>’s legendary 
Events), as one of his proudest moments.
