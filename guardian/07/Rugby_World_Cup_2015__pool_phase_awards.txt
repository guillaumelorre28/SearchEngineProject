It is a sure sign of a fiercely contested category – and an outstanding 
tournament – when Australia’s David Pocock and Fiji’s Leone Nakarawa have to 
settle for a mere podium place. Nothing though has eclipsedJapan’s win over 
South Africa in Brighton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report>
 for shock value, and no one contributed more to that sensational result than 
Ayumu Goromaru. The full-back did not even make his country’s squad four years 
ago but has been a rock for the Brave Blossoms, scoring 24 of his side’s 34 
points against the Springboks, including a wonderfully-worked try in the right 
corner. Now 29 years old, he made his international debut a decade ago but is 
finally fulfilling his huge potential under Eddie Jones’s stewardship. His 
goal-kicking is coolness personified and, as South Africa discovered, he shows 
equal assurance with ball in hand. On top of everything else, his last-gasp 
cover tackle on Scotland’s Tommy Seymour at Kingsholm ranks among the defensive 
highlights of the tournament so far. This will be remembered as the year the 
so-called tier two nations cast off their underdog status; Goromaru,along with 
his team-mates Michael Leitch and Fumiaki Tanaka 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/21/japan-rugby-world-cup-south-africa-scotland>
, has been at the heart of this oval-shaped cultural revolution.RK

Nagusa with a basketball pass. Nagusa ran diagonally, leaving tacklers in his

Japan had beaten South Africa in Brighton and now faced Scotland in Gloucester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2015/sep/23/scotland-v-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-in-pictures>
. The team, traditionally the lightest and shortest at the World Cup, were 
given all of four days’ rest between these games against two of the heaviest 
and tallest. They surprised Scotland, however, at an early lineout, drove, 
scored and briefly held the lead. From then on, Scotland dominated, stopping 
Japan where South Africa had let them through and hurting them with concerted 
drives. As half-time approached, it was clear the game would soon be up. Japan 
had every reason to save themselves for games they could win against Samoa and 
the USA. Scotland, on the stroke of the interval, created an overlap and their 
wing, Tommy Seymour headed for the corner. Then came the second act of 
defiance. Ayumu Goromaru had excelled in attack against South Africa, scoring 
one of the tries of the tournament. Now the full-back made the tackle of his 
life, hitting Seymour at full speed and at full stretch and putting him out of 
play. Japan would lose and they would not make the last eight, but this has 
been their World Cup.EB

 ‘Watch it!’ Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters 
This has to be referee Nigel Owens’ withering put-down of Scotland’s Stuart 
Hogg, who had attempted to win a penalty by diving during his side’sPool B 
defeat to South Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/04/south-africa-scotland-rugby-world-cup>
. Given that Scotland were playing the Springboks at St James’ Park, home to 
Newcastle United, Owens ticked off Hogg and suggested his antics would be 
better suited to when Premier League football returned to the stadium. Hogg, 
looking sheepish, had no answer. Owens said: “There was nothing wrong with it 
[the tackle]. If you want to dive like that again, come back here in two weeks 
and play, not today. Watch it.”JR

Tom Jenkins for the Guardian 
Those who were there on that balmy, barmy September day at the Brighton 
Community Centre when Japan defeated South Africa could barely hear themselves 
think when Karne Hesketh dived over to clinch that impossible 34-32 triumph. 
But they weren’t the only senses that were wildly scrambled on a day where 
Japan, who could be backed at 439-1 during the game, caused not only the 
greatest upset in rugby history but arguably in sporting history too. I missed 
that game, but from a personal perspective, the first rugby union match at the 
new Wembley –between New Zealand and Argentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/20/new-zealand-argentina-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report>
 – also had a lively old atmosphere. It’s not often you hear a Wembley crowd 
cheering the Argentinian national anthem. And for large periods of the game the 
majority of the 89,019 crowdwere firmly behind the Pumas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/sep/20/argentina-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-wembley-crowd-rich>
 too. Altogether now: “Y ya lo ve / y ya lo ve / El que no salta / es un 
ingles!” – “Now you see, now you see! He who doesn’t jump is an Englishman!”SI

what might euphemistically be called an aggressive physicality to
his work. That’s what made it particularly delicious when he decided
to take a more subtle approach against France

Canadian, one of the few players in the World Cup who can decode their

their discussions, sticking his head into their huddle as if he was
just another team-mate. He was getting away with it too – until the TV
cameras captured a French arm reaching out from off-screen and 
enthusiastically plucking him away.EJ

Easiest category of the lot. Does anything even need to be written here? When 
a sporting competitor of any kind is given odds before the off of 349-1, or 
when a rugby team is awarded a handicap of 43 points, it is not just the 
bookies’ way of saying there is absolutely no prospect of the underdog 
prevailing here, it is the very fabric of the known universe’s. Japan’s win 
over South Africa was the biggest surprise of this World Cup. And of this 
sport, this planet, this particular stretch of the space-time continuum. We 
will never see its like again in our lifetime. It was a privilege to witness.MAy

 The Weever fish, described as a toxic terror and a pain, literally, for 
Japan’s Akihito Yamada. Photograph: Blue Reef Aquarium/PA 
Where to start? We’ve had a proposal at Wembley, an enraged South African 
sports minister 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/22/south-africa-risk-bunch-of-losers-sport-minister-fikile-mbalula>
, bizarre tales of England coaches-cum-horse whisperers and uplifting messages 
of support from victorious coaches to the vanquished. But how can we look 
beyond the greatest shock in the sport’s history? With an army of supporters 
Japan were already popular in Brighton but after defeating the Springboks were 
instantly VIPs at their hotel, given a guard of honour by the staff. On the 
subject of hotels,Wales’s ghost story is curious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/05/wales-ghosts-hotel-australia-rugby-world-cup>
 but back to the Brave Blossoms and it was equally uplifting to hear of South 
Africa supporters also giving their Japanese counterparts a guard of honour at 
the train station. But in Akihito Yamada we have a winner. Surviving a 
Springboks onslaught is one thing but Yamada went swimming off the south coast 
to celebrate Japan’s victory, was promptly stung by a weever fish and missed 
the subsequent clash with Scotland. “I’m never going in the ocean again,” he 
lamented.GM

Bundling three of world’s top 10 teams into one group because you made the 
draw three years before was a bad mistake, but the bigger lesson to take away 
from the last three weeks is thatthe better the lower-ranked teams play, the 
more enjoyable the tournament is

. World Rugby has done some good work supporting development in the tier two 
nations, investing £50m in the last three years to help pay for coaches and 
other support staff. But when the tournament starts, the odds still seem to be 
stacked in favour of the tier one sides. That’s reflected in some of the 
refereeing, the disparity in the severity of the bans given to players, and the 
scheduling of short turnarounds between matches against top teams. Lurking in 
the background, too, the open secret that some European club sides are signing 
Pacific Islanders up to contracts which stipulate that they have to quit 
playing international rugby. The playing field isn’t level yet. It needs to be.
