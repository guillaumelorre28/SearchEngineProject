Six months ago Australians watched in horror as footage of teenagers being 
teargassed in their cells, beaten and thrown around, or hooded and strapped to 
a mechanical chair, were broadcast for the first time.


The content of the scenes had been in the public arena 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/29/the-blame-game-can-the-nt-government-claim-a-cover-up-over-youth-detention>
 before the video was televised. They had formed part of more than onereport

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/22/young-indigenous-imprisonment-in-nt-you-wouldnt-believe-it-in-a-modern-day-society>
 in youth justice. But the confronting images – in particular those of 
17-year-old Dylan Voller in a restraint chair – were enough to finally prompt 
action anda royal commission into the Northern Territory’s juvenile detention 
system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/royal-commission-into-northern-territory-juvenile-detention>
 was announced the next morning by the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.

The broadcast

Incidents broadcast by Four Corners this year stretched back to 2010 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/01/timeline-events-northern-territory-juvenile-detention-system>
, but the most high profile in recent years has been the 2014 teargassing of 
six high-risk teenage detainees.

By mid August the six boys had spent up to 17 days in the isolated cells of 
the behavioural management unit at the old Don Dale detention centre.

Given no information about when they would get out, tensions escalated. One 
boy damaged his cell, broke through a tough, wire-mesh screen, and opened his 
door. As he caused damage to the exterior room, superiors feared he would 
access another area staffed by just one female employee. Assembled guards joked 
about letting him climb through a window so they could“pulverise the little 
fucker”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/18/six-teenagers-hooded-and-transferred-to-darwin-adult-prison-report-reveals>

They then teargassed the block 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/03/nt-childrens-commissioner-looks-into-use-of-tear-gas-at-youth-prison>
, and those still inside cells, including boys taking no part in the 
disturbance, were subject to gas for up to eight minutes.

Dylan Voller told the commission he thought he was going to die. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/12/dylan-voller-says-he-felt-defenceless-panicked-restraint-chair-don-dale-northern-territory>

“I didn’t think we were going to be teargassed, because you’re not allowed 
teargas in Don Dale,” he said.

Taken outside, handcuffed and shirtless, the boys were laid on the ground and 
hosed off and then transferred to the adult prison in handcuffs and spithoods, 
one unlawfully as he was just 14.

A shaky start

The royal commission had false starts. Former chief justice, Brian Ross 
Martin, was appointed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/former-chief-justice-named-as-head-of-northern-territory-juvenile-detention-inquiry>
 in the chief role, and then stood himself down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/01/nt-juvenile-detention-brian-martin-stands-down-as-royal-commissioner>
 in the face of widespread backlash.Mick Gooda and Margaret White stepped in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/01/mick-gooda-and-margaret-white-to-lead-royal-commission-into-nt-juvenile-detention>
, but Gooda was immediately criticised over a tweet calling for the NT 
government to be sacked.

When the terms of reference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/former-chief-justice-named-as-head-of-northern-territory-juvenile-detention-inquiry>
 were released the commission had expanded to include child protection butnot 
to examine other states 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/09/two-tier-nt-detention-royal-commission-could-be-australia-wide-say-greens>

, and Victoria.

The bare fact that there has been so much said and so much written over such a 
long time is suggestive of a persistent failure that should not be allowed to 
endure
Peter Callaghan SC 
The then NT chief minister, Adam Giles, vacillated between support for the 
inquiry he’d called for and offered to half-fund, and a tough-on-crime election 
play.

But Giles’ government was thrown out in a landslide election and the new one 
was left to deal with the costs and implementation of both the inquiry and the 
fixes to the system that were required immediately.

In a new era of professed transparency, damning reviews of the system 
begrudgingly saw the light of day.

The commission has so far spoken to more than 1,000 people from across 30 
communities, received about 700 calls and emails and 180 submissions. Visiting 
remote Indigenous communities across the NT, commissioners continued to hear 
new allegations of abuse.


Gooda and White have toured numerous facilities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/08/royal-commission-tours-don-dale-this-is-where-that-young-fella-was-held>
 including the former Don Dale, where White broke down at the site of the 
teargassing, and the current Don Dale, where delegates walked away from an 
“at-risk” cell shaking their heads at its brutal environment.

An ‘inquiry mentality’

After just two public hearings, there have already been delays and widespread 
complaints about insufficient preparation time.

Disorganisation within the commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/fears-northen-territory-juvenile-detention-inquiry-rushed-and-inadequate>
 has sparkedcontroversy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/07/juvenile-detention-royal-commission-defends-resourcing-and-ability-to-achieve-justice-reforms>
, complaints, and evena local media mutiny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/09/jaws-drop-at-abc-as-michelle-guthrie-defends-radio-national-cuts>
.

The second public hearing was delayed over concerns about vulnerable 
witnesses. In the end just one – Voller – gave evidence publicly, and another 
in private before it adjourned early.

Under “broad instructions” from the NT government, the solicitor general’s 
office tried but failed tohave witnesses scratched 
<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.theguardian.com_australia-2Dnews_2016_dec_08_nt-2Droyal-2Dcommission-2Dclaims-2Dof-2Dchaos-2Das-2Dgovernment-2Dtries-2Dand-2Dfails-2Dto-2Dcut-2Dwitness-2Dlist&d=DQMFaQ&c=ptMoEJ5oTofwe4L9tBtGCQ&r=ZRm2XwhewrM1EFKhCSrxP4D5f1w9AeAz1-lbHjtao38&m=EI0DY442tODjmjUBgdDTHzzihz5VgcdXPox2dXWxVSc&s=qux39CKcG7PnpX-5OJFtSIx0kLjO7-UfPz7kL1S-GZg&e=>

. The government distanced itself from the perception they were seeking to 
silence accusers but did not seek to tighten their instructions.


The majority of witnesses so far gave evidence they’ve given before. The 
cynicism around this repetition was addressed on day one of the first hearing, 
as the commission set about reviewing more than 50 already existing relevant 
reports.

Counsel assisting the commission Peter Callaghan SC questioned whether 
Australia had an “inquiry mentality”.

“The bare fact that there has been so much said and so much written over such 
a long time is suggestive of a persistent failure that should not be allowed to 
endure,” Callaghan said.

The former NT ombudsman Carolyn Ann Richards told of the children and families 
department falsely writing off  
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/child-abuse-reports-written-off-as-unsubstantiated-with-no-investigation-nt-royal-commission-hears>

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/child-abuse-reports-written-off-as-unsubstantiated-with-no-investigation-nt-royal-commission-hears>

The national children’s commissioner, Megan Mitchell, spoke of the 
normalisation of the use of force 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/11/northern-territory-juvenile-detention-royal-commission-hearing-begins-in-darwin-live?page=with:block-57fc4e7ce4b0a043a4c24435#block-57fc4e7ce4b0a043a4c24435>
 within juvenile detention and the impact of unratified international law.

 among Indigenous children and the likely underestimated overrepresentation 
among the detention population.

Dylan Voller

Throughout this turbulent time of moral catch-up and investigation, 
19-year-old Voller remained in prison.

First sentenced to a period of detention when he was just 11, Voller has been 
in and out of custodial facilities ever since. He last had mainstream schooling 
at the age of 10.

Now an adult, he is serving out the remainder of a three-year sentence for 
aggravated robbery in the Darwin jail.

On Monday, he addressed the royal commission, sharing new anecdotes of alleged 
barbarity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/12/dylan-voller-says-nt-detainees-were-denied-toilet-access-and-forced-to-pay-guards>
 – including the denial of food, water, and toilet access – and going over his 
eight-year story.

He has been been incarcerated 10 times for terms of between four days and 
almost three years, including for violent acts. Concerns were expressed this 
week that he was being painted as a martyr as his contested testimony was 
reported.

At age 11 Voller was strip-searched for the first time by two male youth 
justice officers.

At 13 he was grabbed by the neck and thrown into his cell twice, stripped of 
his clothes during one incident, punched by a guard, and thrown in an isolation 
cell.

At 15 he spent 90 days of a 210-day sentence in isolation, including the 24 
immediately preceding his release.

<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/01/timeline-events-northern-territory-juvenile-detention-system>
Counsel assisting the commission asked Voller how being locked away from the 
world prepared him for returning to normal life outside.

“It didn’t,” he replied.

Within months Voller committed his most recent violent crimes. His mother, 
disgusted, called the cops on him. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/dylan-voller-fears-reprisals-if-he-gives-royal-commission-evidence-from-prison-mother>

At 17, while serving that sentence, he was teargassed. Months later his head 
was covered with a spithood and he was strapped to a restraint chair by his 
wrists, ankles, and neck, for one hour and 50 minutes.

Few of the actions taken by guards and others – strip searches, abuse, 
isolation, restraint, teargassing – occurred for no reason. Several incidents 
were in response to threats of self-harm. However all are under examination for 
their appropriateness and the internal context which rendered them acceptable.

As a case study, Voller reflects many, if not all the issues at the heart of 
the inquiry, including how much the child protection and justice systems 
steered him down his path of criminality and incarceration.

Russell Goldflam, principal legal officer for Alice Springs legal aid centre, 
told the commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/14/decision-on-whether-to-extend-nt-royal-commission-expected-within-hours>
 there was a “clear correlation” between a child being placed in foster care 
and then committing offences.

Voller first went into care at the age of 10, after his mother Joanne, a 
member of the Stolen Generations, sought assistance with his challenging 
behaviour.

But instead of a rehabilitative environment which worked with Voller’s 
behavioural issues, Voller’s longtime caseworker, Antoinette Carroll said it 
was clear from early on that he was to be treated punitively and without 
understanding.

“What became apparent was that his care workers were somewhat helpless in 
dealing with his complex issues,” said Carroll, who is also the youth justice 
advocacy project coordinator of the Central Australian Aboriginal Justice 
agency.

“The department seemed unwilling to resource the appropriate therapeutic 
approaches to disengage him from at risk behaviours.”


Carroll told the hearing Voller was not a violent boy before he was sent to 
detention 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/13/dylan-voller-wasnt-violent-before-he-was-mistreated-in-detention-caseworker-says>
, and she believed its violent “learning environment” contributed to his 
increased criminal behaviour.


Voller, who allegedly spat at guards and medical staff hundreds of times over 
the years according to NT authorities, conceded it was a “disgusting” habit but 
one he developed as a defence mechanism against guards’ treatment of him.

According to testimony, over the years Voller has been denied parole, denied 
access to a rehab program in Alice Springs in lieu of custody, has been granted 
bail, but never offered diversion.

Carroll told the commission he was “set up to fail” by a system which never 
had the will or the resources to work with his challenging behaviour and 
rehabilitate him.

Stop the cycle

Voller joined lawyers, advocates, human rights groups, and current and former 
prisoners incalling for a change to the system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/12/dylan-voller-says-he-felt-defenceless-panicked-restraint-chair-don-dale-northern-territory>
 to stop the cycle of incarceration.

Whether that change comes from this royal commission is a key question.

The inquiry has seen false starts and poor decisions, appointments and 
resignations, trip-ups and corrections, but has completed two public hearings 
and on Friday receiveda four-month extension to deal with the scale of 
investigation required 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/16/northern-territory-juvenile-detention-royal-commission-given-four-month-extension>
.

Few believe they don’t need it. The commission has now adjourned for the year, 
but the words of Callaghan about the dangers of Australia’s inquiry mentality 
loom large.

There is a lot riding on this commission to be the one that sees action 
replace investigation.
