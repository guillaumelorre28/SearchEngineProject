BBC Radio 6 Music <https://www.theguardian.com/media/6music> will air Blue Jam 
and On the Hour satirist Chris Morris’s first new radio sketch for 15 years on 
Sunday.

The eight-minute 46-second sketch, written by and featuring Morris, Richard 
Ayoade and Noel Fielding,will be broadcast during Mary Anne Hobbs’ Sunday 
morning 6 Music show <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04tm3qb>.

Morris said: “This is a work in progress cut from a project that was stored in 
a vat, but still seems to be breathing or at least emitting gas.

“The series is set in a care home and records a number of vexatious encounters 
between a new resident, Victor, and his long-suffering care manager.”

His last radio work was the dark, “ambient comedy” Blue Jam, broadcast on Radio
 <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> 1 in an early morning slot between 
1997 and 1999. Channel 4 broadcast a TV version, Jam.

Morris is also best known for co-creating with Armando Iannucci and starring 
in the Radio 4 broadcast news satire On the Hour and its BBC2 spin-off, The Day 
Today, which featured a stellar comedy line-up including Steve Coogan, Rebecca 
Front, Doon Mackichan, Patrick Marber and David Schneider.

He created and featured in another satirical news format, the controversial 
Brass Eye, for Channel 4.
