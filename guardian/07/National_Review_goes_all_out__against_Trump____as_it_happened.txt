Jeb Lund has a coda to his day-long series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jan/22/us-election-2016-campaign-live-coverage-donald-trump-sarah-palin-bernie-sanders#block-56a2587be4b05f5c24ca5021>
 on National Review’s multi-pronged attack on billionaire frontrunner Donald 
Trump:

There are so many other blog posts in The National Review’s “Against Trump” 
extravaganza, and they are all, like perfect snowflakes made from Flint river 
water whipped up by a freezing wind, toxic to your brain.

They deserve to be decontaminated and scorned, but unfortunately, we lack the 
time and space. It is Friday, and we all deserve peace. Besides, this is a 
family newspaper, and so many of the words Herr Buckley’s flunkies’ desperate 
gallimaufry richly deserve are unprintable here.

But this is exhausting, a plundering of the human spirit, a slow paddle 
against a ceaseless undertow.

Instead, in this time of trial, I turn to the words of a man who had some 
crazy ideas. You might have heard of him. A man who said some things nobody 
wanted to hear, who wasn’t always understood by everybody and who a lot of 
people, by acclaim, wanted hauled off and strung up by the authorities:

We close today with a man so serially buffoonish, incorrect and savagely 
stupid that, if you were on fire and he handed you a bucket of water, you might 
pause to make sure it wasn’t gasoline.

Bill Kristol, inheritor of his father’s movement, an outlet kept afloat by the 
largesse of plutocrats because its contents are dedicated to venerating and 
excusing them while excoriating their critics, asks, “Hasn’t Donald Trump been 
a votary merely of wealth rather than of freedom?”

He quotes Leo Strauss, champion of the noble lie, before asking, “Isn’t Donald 
Trump the very epitome of vulgarity?” In anyone else’s mouth, this would be a 
valid question, perhaps even a damning one. But if the human body contains 10 
pints of blood, William Kristol could slip-n-slide from Mosul to Baghdad on a 
torrent of either the 1,000,000 or the 10,000,000 pints of it his ennobling 
ambitions loosed from countless families onto Iraq’s sands.

Bill’s commitment to framing his thinking like a TV movie of first-year law 
school appears yet again in his concluding paragraph, in which the man who 
brought you Sarah Palin asks: “Isn’t Trumpism a two-bit Caesarism of a kind 
that American conservatives have always disdained?”

Mission accomplished. Bring ‘em on. We’re gonna smoke ‘em outta their caves. 

You hack, you prevaricator, you bloodstained wretch, you engineer of misery. 
How dare you. The only right you have to criticize another human still drawing 
breath for engaging in two-bit Caesarism atop an empire of fraud is the same 
one Krusty the Clown has for apoplexy at another entertainer doing a crank 
phone call routine: “If this is anyone other than Steve Allen, you’re stealing 
my bit.”

It’s time to spend some a few minutes again with one of my very old friends, 
Thomas Sowell. Or, as I like to call him, “Hitler-Reference Urkel 
<http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/576_576_/sowell_1.jpg>.”

In a country with more than 300 million people, it is remarkable how obsessed 
the media have become with just one - Donald Trump.

Hahaha, it is funny. This is one of Sowell’s many tics, where he takes 
something eminently explicable about which he feels peevish and magnifies it 
into a mystifying new social aberration that can only prove the world has gone 
mad. It’s an affectedly homespun voice that is meant to contrast the author’s 
clear-eyed humility with the fantastical manias of the modern world. This is 
how an academic with enough initials after his name to stencil all the crypts 
in a Balkan cemetery comes to feign surprise at the fact that a media figure 
for the last three decades who once helmed a hit reality show and has his own 
chain of branded hotels is the subject of media “obsession” just becausehe is 
one of two people leading the polls for the most powerful job in the world.

No national leader ever aroused more fervent emotions than Adolf Hitler did in 
the 1930s. Watch some old newsreels of German crowds delirious with joy at the 
sight of him. The only things at all comparable in more recent times were the 
ecstatic crowds that greeted Barack Obama when he burst upon the political 
scene in 2008.

Therrrrrre we are. There’s that Hitler-reference endorphin hit. Daddy had to 
read two whole paragraphs before getting his medicine.

Elections, however, have far more lasting and far more serious—or even 
grim—consequences than emotional venting. The actual track record of crowd 
pleasers, whether Juan Perón in Argentina, Obama in America, or Hitler in 
Germany, is very sobering, if not painfully depressing.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Mark Helprin just established that Donald Trump is 
Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jan/22/us-election-2016-campaign-live-coverage-donald-trump-sarah-palin-bernie-sanders#block-56a295d6e4b0f4b9efc8ce2a>
, who is Eva Person, who is also Mussolini and a tapeworm and Allah and Britney 
Spears. Are these guys even on the same page?

After the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, we are entering an era when 
people alive at this moment may live to see a day when American cities are left 
in radioactive ruins.

This is what’s great about Thomas Sowell. Most writers would be satisfied with 
just the Hitler reference. They’d drop Adolf in there, maybe go “BOOOOSH!” with 
a co-worker and, you know, bump fists and blow it up, but this man is 
committed. There is no contemptibly implausible nightmare scenario that Thomas 
Sowell can’t shoehorn into any topic next to another contemptibly implausible 
nightmare scenario. After all, a world where Barack Obama is basically Hitler 
is just as plausible a world in which a nation with no nuclear weapons could 
become an existential threat to a nation of about 320m people virtually 
overnight.

A shoot-from-the-hip, bombastic showoff is the last thing we need or can 
afford.

Thomas Sowell is a recurring guest on The O’Reilly Factor. Also, Donald Trump 
is probably Hitler, which means that America will have back-to-back Hitlers for 
the first time since Hitler and Clone Hitler. Q.E.D. Thomas Sowell just flexed 
and removed his sweater vest to reveal another sweater vest underneath. It’s 
sweater vests all the way down.

It takes Mark Helprin all of 40 words to get to his first simile, which likens 
Barack Obama to Mussolini, and Donald Trump to Barack Obama, in that his 
Mussolininess is more Mussoliniful than even Obama’s. Then, in the next 
sentence, Trump is a caudillo, “surpassing even our own Evita,” who could be 
Barack Obama as well, although that might distract from his Mussoliniing.

From there, we’re onto the neologism “politichiens.” I can only imagine the 
author pushing emphatically back from a massive rolltop desk, taking the 
antique meerschaum pipe in hand, and blowing bubbles out of it, each borne 
aloft on hot, damply satisfied breath, before bursting near the ceiling, a 
satisfyingpop of another mot juste released. Aha indeed! “You see, it sounds 
like politician, but in French it meansdogs,” he says, to the empty room. A 
father or a grandfather stares sternly from a picture frame, trapped in this 
pose for eternity and wondering if, at one point, he stood too long with his 
crotch near a microwave or X-ray machine.

After that, we have Trump’s “raging megalomania, matched only by Obama’s.” 
Ahaha. OK. Perhaps the reason why nobody not paid to contribute to conservative 
media has been able to detect the raging megalomania is because “the president 
sometimes tries to conceal [it] beneath a laughably transparent gossamer of 
false modesty.”Laughable! Laughable, I tell you.The room is still empty.

Trump, “like a tapeworm,” has “invaded the schismatically weakened body of the 
Republican party.” But, in his Mussolini-Evita-Tapewormness, he is “like Allah 
in Islamic theology.” We should be cautioned against worshipping this false 
divinity, for the man handling the nuclear codes is not “a stolid military 
officer but Britney Spears or Ozzy Osbourne.”

Indeed, was it not Evita Mussolini who once said, “Oops, we’re going off the 
rails on a crazy train again”? Historians tell us he was a tapeworm when he 
said this.
That is why Donald Trump is bad.

New Iowa poll shows – polling haywire

The Des Moines register contemplates a wee difference in two recent Iowa polls 
of the Democratic nomination race:
Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) 
CNN/ORC: Sanders, 51% Clinton 43%. Loras: Clinton 59%, Sanders 30%. In 
@jaselzer <https://twitter.com/jaselzer> we trust. She'll call the balls and 
strikes in Iowa.
 <https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/690625567364808704> January 22, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/690625567364808704> 
Is Sanders up by 8? Or is Clinton up by 29 
<http://loras.edu/About-Loras/News-Events/News/2016/Clinton-Maintains-Lead,-New-Loras-College-Poll-Fin.aspx>
?
Harry Enten (@ForecasterEnten) 
Between CNN and Loras, Clinton gained 35+ points. What momentum!... Or the 
polls are all over the place.
 <https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/690616276167823360> January 22, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/690616276167823360> 
@jaselzer would be Ann Selzer, the mind behind the Register’s state polling 
who alone identified Barack Obama on the path to victory in the state in 2008 
and Rick Santorum coming on strong in 2012.

The latest Selzer Iowa poll 
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/14/iowa-poll-clinton-slides-leads-sanders-2-points/78738770/>
, from 14 January, hadClinton up by 2 in Iowa, 42-40 over Sanders – but Clinton 
had slid from 46 points in the prior poll.

Stay tuned.

Returning to the state where her rival Bernie Sanders holds a formidable lead, 
Hillary Clinton continued to push the electability argumentat the start of a 
one-day swing through New Hampshire on Friday.
Addressing a crowd of roughly 500 at an opera house in Rochester, Clinton 
framed the election as one in which the stakes “are really high.”
“They’re high because we have to make a fundamental decision: Are we going to 
try and build on the progress we have made under President Obama or are we 
going to tear it apart and start from scratch?” she said. 


Introducing Clinton at the event was the popular home state senator Jeanne 
Shaheen, who has worked closely with Sanders in the Senate but similarly cast 
the choice before Democrats as one of pragmatism versus idealism.
“I don’t just want rhetoric in this campaign. I want actions,” Shaheen said. 
“I want to support a candidate who’s going to get something done.”
Clinton and her allies have drawn an increasing contrast with Sanders not 
simply on who is better positioned to be the standard bearer of the Democratic 
Party – but who stands a superior chance of setting foot in the White House. A 
day earlier in Iowa, Clinton launched one of her most direct critiques of the 
Vermont senator to date as someone who, despite having the right principles, 
was not rooted in reality.
“I am not interested in ideas that sound good on paper but will never make it 
in the real world,” Clinton said during a stop in Indianola. “I care about 
making a real difference in your life and that gets to the choice you have to 
make in this caucus.”
 I’ll show you pragmatism. Photograph: Brynn Anderson/AP 
Although she did not mention Sanders by name in New Hampshire, the state that 
neighbors his home, Clinton again bore the image of a doer and not just a 
talker.
“I know how hard it is to get through a recalcitrant obstructionist Congress,” 
she said.
It was Clinton’s first stop of the day, before an enthusiastic crowd that 
frequently cheered – and even whistled – throughout her remarks and subsequent 
Q&A. The former secretary of state was scheduled to appear at a dinner to mark 
the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade and a second town hall later in the evening.

Ahhh, a palate cleanser. Over at the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/22/the-story-behind-the-national-reviews-big-anti-donald-trump-issue/?postshare=311453487154838&tid=ss_tw>
, Callum Borchers interviews National Review editor Rich Lowry, who is God’s 
answer to the question, “What would the sentence ‘Dad, I lost my retainer’ look 
like if it was a person?”

This is the first exchange:

FIX: How long ago did you start this project? It must have been quite the 
undertaking.

LOWRY:It was a month in the making.

The last monument to futility that took this long to erect was the bridge on 
the river Kwai, and at least thatworked before someone dynamited it. Seriously, 
amonth? Every single one of these essays could have been farted out on an 
iPhone in between savaging benedicts at a mimosa-fueled brunch, and it would be 
more insulting if they weren’t.

These essays aren’t just short, they’re short on everything. Ideas, 
information, humor, something that makes the written word feel like it’s 
capable of creating inspiration or joy. For a bunch of conservatives, the faint 
stench of actual work hovers nowhere near any of these entries. There are at 
best a few decent installments in here. Apart from not noticing thatevery GOP 
candidate since 1968 has sounded like George Wallace, Ben “No, I really wrote 
this piece myself this time” Domenech is not bad. David Boaz’s entry is 
tolerable. Everything else is a hilarious failure.

Besides wealthy men who probably share the same pro-business, authoritarian 
anti-regulatory mindset and culture-war indifference of Donald Trump, who reads 
the National Review? Who is going to be persuaded by this aside from think tank 
homunculi who want to continue cashing checks from the conservative noise 
machine? Who, among the populist, anti-establishment Trump fans will reconsider 
their support after seeing this sclerotic, enfeebled attempt to push over an 
ivory back scratcher in protest? Who would read this out of anything but spite? 
A terminal tubercular patient at a hospice could open a window andtalk out of 
it like Eddie Redmayne <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcgOSKcYDg> and reach

Jeb Lund has a coda to his day-long series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jan/22/us-election-2016-campaign-live-coverage-donald-trump-sarah-palin-bernie-sanders#block-56a2587be4b05f5c24ca5021>
 on National Review’s multi-pronged attack on billionaire frontrunner Donald 
Trump:

There are so many other blog posts in The National Review’s “Against Trump” 
extravaganza, and they are all, like perfect snowflakes made from Flint river 
water whipped up by a freezing wind, toxic to your brain.

They deserve to be decontaminated and scorned, but unfortunately, we lack the 
time and space. It is Friday, and we all deserve peace. Besides, this is a 
family newspaper, and so many of the words Herr Buckley’s flunkies’ desperate 
gallimaufry richly deserve are unprintable here.

But this is exhausting, a plundering of the human spirit, a slow paddle 
against a ceaseless undertow.

Instead, in this time of trial, I turn to the words of a man who had some 
crazy ideas. You might have heard of him. A man who said some things nobody 
wanted to hear, who wasn’t always understood by everybody and who a lot of 
people, by acclaim, wanted hauled off and strung up by the authorities:

Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) 
I want to die.

<https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/242303672569188354>  
We close today with a man so serially buffoonish, incorrect and savagely 
stupid that, if you were on fire and he handed you a bucket of water, you might 
pause to make sure it wasn’t gasoline.

Bill Kristol, inheritor of his father’s movement, an outlet kept afloat by the 
largesse of plutocrats because its contents are dedicated to venerating and 
excusing them while excoriating their critics, asks, “Hasn’t Donald Trump been 
a votary merely of wealth rather than of freedom?”

He quotes Leo Strauss, champion of the noble lie, before asking, “Isn’t Donald 
Trump the very epitome of vulgarity?” In anyone else’s mouth, this would be a 
valid question, perhaps even a damning one. But if the human body contains 10 
pints of blood, William Kristol could slip-n-slide from Mosul to Baghdad on a 
torrent of either the 1,000,000 or the 10,000,000 pints of it his ennobling 
ambitions loosed from countless families onto Iraq’s sands.

Bill’s commitment to framing his thinking like a TV movie of first-year law 
school appears yet again in his concluding paragraph, in which the man who 
brought you Sarah Palin asks: “Isn’t Trumpism a two-bit Caesarism of a kind 
that American conservatives have always disdained?”

Mission accomplished. Bring ‘em on. We’re gonna smoke ‘em outta their caves. 

You hack, you prevaricator, you bloodstained wretch, you engineer of misery. 
How dare you. The only right you have to criticize another human still drawing 
breath for engaging in two-bit Caesarism atop an empire of fraud is the same 
one Krusty the Clown has for apoplexy at another entertainer doing a crank 
phone call routine: “If this is anyone other than Steve Allen, you’re stealing 
my bit.”
 
It’s time to spend some a few minutes again with one of my very old friends, 
Thomas Sowell. Or, as I like to call him, “Hitler-Reference Urkel 
<http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/576_576_/sowell_1.jpg>.”

In a country with more than 300 million people, it is remarkable how obsessed 
the media have become with just one - Donald Trump.

Hahaha, it is funny. This is one of Sowell’s many tics, where he takes 
something eminently explicable about which he feels peevish and magnifies it 
into a mystifying new social aberration that can only prove the world has gone 
mad. It’s an affectedly homespun voice that is meant to contrast the author’s 
clear-eyed humility with the fantastical manias of the modern world. This is 
how an academic with enough initials after his name to stencil all the crypts 
in a Balkan cemetery comes to feign surprise at the fact that a media figure 
for the last three decades who once helmed a hit reality show and has his own 
chain of branded hotels is the subject of media “obsession” just becausehe is 
one of two people leading the polls for the most powerful job in the world.

No national leader ever aroused more fervent emotions than Adolf Hitler did in 
the 1930s. Watch some old newsreels of German crowds delirious with joy at the 
sight of him. The only things at all comparable in more recent times were the 
ecstatic crowds that greeted Barack Obama when he burst upon the political 
scene in 2008.

Therrrrrre we are. There’s that Hitler-reference endorphin hit. Daddy had to 
read two whole paragraphs before getting his medicine.

Elections, however, have far more lasting and far more serious—or even 
grim—consequences than emotional venting. The actual track record of crowd 
pleasers, whether Juan Perón in Argentina, Obama in America, or Hitler in 
Germany, is very sobering, if not painfully depressing.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Mark Helprin just established that Donald Trump is 
Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jan/22/us-election-2016-campaign-live-coverage-donald-trump-sarah-palin-bernie-sanders#block-56a295d6e4b0f4b9efc8ce2a>
, who is Eva Person, who is also Mussolini and a tapeworm and Allah and Britney 
Spears. Are these guys even on the same page?

After the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, we are entering an era when 
people alive at this moment may live to see a day when American cities are left 
in radioactive ruins.

This is what’s great about Thomas Sowell. Most writers would be satisfied with 
just the Hitler reference. They’d drop Adolf in there, maybe go “BOOOOSH!” with 
a co-worker and, you know, bump fists and blow it up, but this man is 
committed. There is no contemptibly implausible nightmare scenario that Thomas 
Sowell can’t shoehorn into any topic next to another contemptibly implausible 
nightmare scenario. After all, a world where Barack Obama is basically Hitler 
is just as plausible a world in which a nation with no nuclear weapons could 
become an existential threat to a nation of about 320m people virtually 
overnight.

A shoot-from-the-hip, bombastic showoff is the last thing we need or can 
afford.

Thomas Sowell is a recurring guest on The O’Reilly Factor. Also, Donald Trump 
is probably Hitler, which means that America will have back-to-back Hitlers for 
the first time since Hitler and Clone Hitler. Q.E.D. Thomas Sowell just flexed 
and removed his sweater vest to reveal another sweater vest underneath. It’s 
sweater vests all the way down.

It takes Mark Helprin all of 40 words to get to his first simile, which likens 
Barack Obama to Mussolini, and Donald Trump to Barack Obama, in that his 
Mussolininess is more Mussoliniful than even Obama’s. Then, in the next 
sentence, Trump is a caudillo, “surpassing even our own Evita,” who could be 
Barack Obama as well, although that might distract from his Mussoliniing.

From there, we’re onto the neologism “politichiens.” I can only imagine the 
author pushing emphatically back from a massive rolltop desk, taking the 
antique meerschaum pipe in hand, and blowing bubbles out of it, each borne 
aloft on hot, damply satisfied breath, before bursting near the ceiling, a 
satisfyingpop of another mot juste released. Aha indeed! “You see, it sounds 
like politician, but in French it meansdogs,” he says, to the empty room. A 
father or a grandfather stares sternly from a picture frame, trapped in this 
pose for eternity and wondering if, at one point, he stood too long with his 
crotch near a microwave or X-ray machine.

After that, we have Trump’s “raging megalomania, matched only by Obama’s.” 
Ahaha. OK. Perhaps the reason why nobody not paid to contribute to conservative 
media has been able to detect the raging megalomania is because “the president 
sometimes tries to conceal [it] beneath a laughably transparent gossamer of 
false modesty.”Laughable! Laughable, I tell you.The room is still empty.

Trump, “like a tapeworm,” has “invaded the schismatically weakened body of the 
Republican party.” But, in his Mussolini-Evita-Tapewormness, he is “like Allah 
in Islamic theology.” We should be cautioned against worshipping this false 
divinity, for the man handling the nuclear codes is not “a stolid military 
officer but Britney Spears or Ozzy Osbourne.”

Indeed, was it not Evita Mussolini who once said, “Oops, we’re going off the 
rails on a crazy train again”? Historians tell us he was a tapeworm when he 
said this.
That is why Donald Trump is bad.
 
Trump contains multitudes. Apparently including Chingy, the platinum-selling 
naughties rapper from St. Louis.

The Des Moines register contemplates a wee difference in two recent Iowa polls 
of the Democratic nomination race:
Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) 
CNN/ORC: Sanders, 51% Clinton 43%. Loras: Clinton 59%, Sanders 30%. In 
@jaselzer <https://twitter.com/jaselzer> we trust. She'll call the balls and 
strikes in Iowa.

Between CNN and Loras, Clinton gained 35+ points. What momentum!... Or the 
polls are all over the place.

@jaselzer would be Ann Selzer, the mind behind the Register’s state polling 
who alone identified Barack Obama on the path to victory in the state in 2008 
and Rick Santorum coming on strong in 2012.

The latest Selzer Iowa poll 
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/14/iowa-poll-clinton-slides-leads-sanders-2-points/78738770/>
, from 14 January, hadClinton up by 2 in Iowa, 42-40 over Sanders – but Clinton 
had slid from 46 points in the prior poll.

Stay tuned.

Returning to the state where her rival Bernie Sanders holds a formidable lead, 
Hillary Clinton continued to push the electability argumentat the start of a 
one-day swing through New Hampshire on Friday.
Addressing a crowd of roughly 500 at an opera house in Rochester, Clinton 
framed the election as one in which the stakes “are really high.”
“They’re high because we have to make a fundamental decision: Are we going to 
try and build on the progress we have made under President Obama or are we 
going to tear it apart and start from scratch?” she said. 


Introducing Clinton at the event was the popular home state senator Jeanne 
Shaheen, who has worked closely with Sanders in the Senate but similarly cast 
the choice before Democrats as one of pragmatism versus idealism.
“I don’t just want rhetoric in this campaign. I want actions,” Shaheen said. 
“I want to support a candidate who’s going to get something done.”
Clinton and her allies have drawn an increasing contrast with Sanders not 
simply on who is better positioned to be the standard bearer of the Democratic 
Party – but who stands a superior chance of setting foot in the White House. A 
day earlier in Iowa, Clinton launched one of her most direct critiques of the 
Vermont senator to date as someone who, despite having the right principles, 
was not rooted in reality.
“I am not interested in ideas that sound good on paper but will never make it 
in the real world,” Clinton said during a stop in Indianola. “I care about 
making a real difference in your life and that gets to the choice you have to 
make in this caucus.”
 I’ll show you pragmatism. Photograph: Brynn Anderson/AP 
Although she did not mention Sanders by name in New Hampshire, the state that 
neighbors his home, Clinton again bore the image of a doer and not just a 
talker.
“I know how hard it is to get through a recalcitrant obstructionist Congress,” 
she said.
It was Clinton’s first stop of the day, before an enthusiastic crowd that 
frequently cheered – and even whistled – throughout her remarks and subsequent 
Q&A. The former secretary of state was scheduled to appear at a dinner to mark 
the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade and a second town hall later in the evening.
 
Ahhh, a palate cleanser. Over at the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/22/the-story-behind-the-national-reviews-big-anti-donald-trump-issue/?postshare=311453487154838&tid=ss_tw>
, Callum Borchers interviews National Review editor Rich Lowry, who is God’s 
answer to the question, “What would the sentence ‘Dad, I lost my retainer’ look 
like if it was a person?”

This is the first exchange:

FIX: How long ago did you start this project? It must have been quite the 
undertaking.

LOWRY:It was a month in the making.

The last monument to futility that took this long to erect was the bridge on 
the river Kwai, and at least thatworked before someone dynamited it. Seriously, 
amonth? Every single one of these essays could have been farted out on an 
iPhone in between savaging benedicts at a mimosa-fueled brunch, and it would be 
more insulting if they weren’t.

These essays aren’t just short, they’re short on everything. Ideas, 
information, humor, something that makes the written word feel like it’s 
capable of creating inspiration or joy. For a bunch of conservatives, the faint 
stench of actual work hovers nowhere near any of these entries. There are at 
best a few decent installments in here. Apart from not noticing thatevery GOP 
candidate since 1968 has sounded like George Wallace, Ben “No, I really wrote 
this piece myself this time” Domenech is not bad. David Boaz’s entry is 
tolerable. Everything else is a hilarious failure.

Besides wealthy men who probably share the same pro-business, authoritarian 
anti-regulatory mindset and culture-war indifference of Donald Trump, who reads 
the National Review? Who is going to be persuaded by this aside from think tank 
homunculi who want to continue cashing checks from the conservative noise 
machine? Who, among the populist, anti-establishment Trump fans will reconsider 
their support after seeing this sclerotic, enfeebled attempt to push over an 
ivory back scratcher in protest? Who would read this out of anything but spite? 
A terminal tubercular patient at a hospice could open a window andtalk out of 
it like Eddie Redmayne <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcgOSKcYDg> and reach 
more people.
