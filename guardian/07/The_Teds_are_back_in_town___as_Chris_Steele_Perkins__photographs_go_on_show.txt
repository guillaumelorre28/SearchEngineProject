In the early 1950s, when photographer Chris Steele-Perkins 
<http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/> was growing up in Burnham-on-Sea, a 
seaside resort in Somerset, teddy boys were the only other outsiders. “I was 
born in Burma – so, there weren’t many people who looked like me. Teds were 
hanging on the street corners, posturing, standing out. Perhaps that’s why I 
was drawn to them.”

Steele-Perkins travelled to Afghanistan, embedding himself with the Taliban 
four times, and spent time in Northern Ireland in the early 1980s, but his 1979 
bookThe Teds <http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/books/the-teds.html> became one 
of the most-referenced fashion anthologies in Britain.

These photographs are now being exhibited in the UK for the first time in 
nearly 40 years in London 
<http://www.bjp-online.com/2016/08/chris-steele-perkins-teds-gets-new-release-for-first-time-in-40-years/>
 but their success stand as testament to the Britishness of this subculture. In 
these sharp monochrome images, you see dark regional pubs, street corners, 
faces and cigarettes – all signifiers of the teds’ social life, their slang, 
and esoteric lifestyle.

The teddy appeal was twofold. Aesthetically, it rejected the 1950s post-war 
blandness while also focusing on particular pieces previously unattainable to 
the wearers because of the class system. There was the drape jacket, with 
collar, cuff and pocket detail; slim, tapered trousers, withchukka boots 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukka_boot> or brogues; and a hairstyle defined 
by a heavily greased quiff at the front, and a “duck’s arse 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck%27s_ass>” at the back. 

It was meticulous and elegant and, like the Teds themselves, had a certain 
glamour attached to it, “even if it was violent,” says Steele-Perkins. “The 
whole mythology, the extravagant way they styled themselves, and lived their 
lives. People wanted to be part of it. And looking aesthetically, if it goes 
back to the dandyism inspired by that Edwardian style [hence ted] of dress, it 
was also about class.” Or rather a rejection of it; the drape jacket became 
symbolic of a pan-class aspirationalism: “Dandys wore it, but the butcher boy 
wanted to, and could, wear it too.”

Steele-Perkins spent his childhood observing teds, and a large chunk of his 
early career documenting what would become the next generation of this 
subculture between 1975 and 1977. He doesn’t know why this second-wave came 
along, but says the media were pivotal in their rise: “Back in the 1950s, you 
would read this stuff in the newspaper and, well, my dad thought it sounded 
awful.” In June 1955, theSunday Dispatch 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Dispatch> headline ran “War on teddy 
boys: menace in the streets of Britain’s cities is being cleaned up at last”. 
“But the point is,” says Steele-Perkins, “they were in the papers.”

The exhibition comes 60 years after 1956, a watershed year for the teds. This 
was the year the Bill Haley film Rock Around the Clock was released,which 
sparked riots at London’s Elephant and Castle Trocadero 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2012/sep/16/teddy-boys-riot-1956-archive>. 
Seats were knifed, bottles and fireworks were thrown at the police, four shop 
windows were smashed. The protest spread nationally, leading to the film being 
banned in Belfast.

Thanks to coverage in newspapers and on TV, teds were one of the first 
subcultures to be documented both as they were evolving and also on a national 
scale. Naturally, this gave them a weight that other youth tribes would not 
get, until the punks came along. Which is not to do a disservice to the mods or 
rockers, explains Steele-Perkins, but rather to show how important the teds 
were to British subcultures reacting to the environment, culture and politics 
provided by society. “In many ways, they came along because they were postwar 
teenagers, and teenagers were, I suppose, a postwar invention.” As he adds: 
“Teenagers often need some sort of community.”

Steele-Perkins was far from a ted himself – “I had a beard and long hair at 
the time” – but hung around long enough for them to start to talk to him, trust 
him and let them photograph them. The main issue was not the photography, 
rather it was capturing them with candour: “They were getting dressed up 
because they wanted to be seen. So the struggle was getting them to not pose, 
to get something more real.” The trick, he says, was patience: “If you spent 
long enough, they got too tired to pose.”


A new edition of  <http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/books/the-teds.html>The 
Teds by Chris Steele-Perkins <http://www.dewilewis.com/products/the-teds> is 
published by Dewi Lewis. The exhibition runs atthe Magnum Print Room 
<https://www.magnumphotos.com/events/event/teds-exhibition-chris-steele-perkins/>
, 63 Gee Street, London EC1V 3RS until 28 October. 


 * This article was amended on 11 October 2016. An earlier version said 
Steele-Perkins documented the second generation of the teds subculture between 
1966 and 1967; those dates have been corrected to 1975 and 1977. We also said 
it had been 40 years since the 1956 watershed year for the teds; that has been 
corrected to 60 years.
