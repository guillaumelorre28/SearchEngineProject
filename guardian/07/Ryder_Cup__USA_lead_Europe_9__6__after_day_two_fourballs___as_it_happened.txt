So Europe, having suffered that nightmare session on Friday morning, battled 
their way back to parity ... only for the USA to tear away again. It’s almost 
as though they were teasing the visitors. But after some stunning play from 
Phil Mickelson, JB Holmes, Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar, a nightmare yip by Phil 
Mickelson, and a genuinely stellar display by the outstanding Patrick Reed, the 
USA take a three-shot lead going into tomorrow’s singles. They just need to win 
five of the 12 rubbers to get their hands on theRyder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> for the first time since 2008. 
Whatever happens tomorrow, it’s going to be memorable. Wherever your loyalties 
lie, you’ll make sure to join us, won’t you? Singles start just after 11am 
local time, 5pm in the UK. See you tomorrow!

United States of America 9½-6½ Europe

It just looks like delaying the inevitable. Neither Stenson nor Rose go close 
with their tee shots, while that man Patrick Reed caresses his over the flag to 
12 feet. Spieth, who hasn’t really needed to do much today, dumps his tee shot 
in the water. So it’s down to Reed. And Reed is more than enough for Europe. 
Stenson’s birdie effort from 25 feet, snaking down the green, is tremendous, 
but it somehow stays out on the left lip. Reed can’t convert his ninth birdie 
of the afternoon, but that’s a 2&1 win and one of the great individualRyder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> performances. Patrick Reed, ladies 
and gentlemen!

But rather incredibly, there’s still life in the final match! Patrick Reed has 
a 15-foot putt for his eagle; Henrik Stenson is just off the green in two. The 
crowd chant Patrick Reed’s name, over and again. He waves his hands in the air. 
And so Stenson trundles in a downhill chip from the fringe! It spooks Reed, who 
leaves his putt high on the right, and the match move on to 17! Europe are 
desperate for anything they can get now. A half-point here would be so precious 
for Europe. But we’re still in pipe-dream territory, for the US pair are still 
two up with two to play, for all the drama that’s just unfolded.

Every half point counts, and now it’s fairly clear that Willett and Westwood 
desperately need something going up 18.They might get it, too, with Moore 
sending his ball through the back of the green, then chunking the chip coming 
back. Holmes makes his par. But Westwood, who really does owe Europe and his 
captain for the pick, knocks his second to three feet. Willett is within 12 
feet, too. Two chances for a birdie and a precious half point, then! Willett 
lets his putt race by the hole. So it’s down to Westwood. Can he make the short 
putt and halve the match?

United States of America 7½-6½ Europe

It’s Garcia versus Mickelson on 17. They’re both six feet from the flag, 
facing birdie putts. Garcia makes his, which forces Mickelson to make his if he 
wants to close out the match here. And it was always going in the middle! 
That’s a 2&1 victory, and the home side takes the overall lead again!

This is a simply amazing response to letting that lead slip by Patrick Reed! 
After what happened this morning, the young man would have been forgiven for 
crumbling. But he’s just carded back-to-back birdies to take this match away 
from Europe! He’s made seven birdies today! The performance of the week, 
without question. He’s an amazing player. Compare and contrast the dismal 
efforts of Willett and Westwood on 17; with one man in the water and another 20 
feet from the flag, they both bogeyed to hand the hole, and perhaps the match, 
to their opponents. The USA are putting the pedal to the metal, and as things 
stand they’ll go into tomorrow’s singles in a very dominant position. It’s no 
more than they deserve for this comprehensive afternoon display.

There’s already drama going on at 17, of course. Holmes got wet, while Moore 
found the back of the green, tickling a 20-footer to within one turn of 
dropping for a sensational birdie. But it’s just par. Willett has a chip from 
the side of the green to win the hole; he duffs it, leaving his ball ten feet 
short, and he can’t make the putt. Which leaves Westwood with a downhill 
five-footer to halve the hole. He pushes it predictably to the right, and the 
USA are up in all three remaining rubbers! Even more so, now Reed has just 
birdied 15 to move the States dormie three in that match!

Sergio very nearly rakes in a 40-footer for eagle on 16. It doesn’t drop, 
which means Kuchar has a birdie putt to close out the match. But his 20-footer 
doesn’t go in, Europe win the hole, and everyone moves on to 17.

Sheer brilliance from JB Holmes and Patrick Reed back there. They’re letting 
nothing slip, with the Europeans trying their damnedest to turn the scoreboard 
blue. Europe will be feeling a little concerned; as things stand, the home 
heroes will be taking a two-point lead into tomorrow’s singles, a format in 
which, historically, they get the upper hand more often than not.

Westwood bashes his ball out of sand at 16 to four feet; Holmes bashes his to 
two. Then Willett has a long look at his eagle, but doesn’t really hit it. He 
knocks in the four footer he leaves himself, though, and with Holmes’ putt 
conceded, that’s the hole halved in birdie! Meanwhile neither Rose nor Stenson 
can make their birdies on 14, but Reed can! Theyhave arrested the downward 
momentum this time, and how they celebrate with relief! This is justwonderful 
to-and-fro match play. “Following Sky’s interview just now with Rory and 
Pieters, I think we may be on the brink of the latest major sporting scandal,” 
reports George Wright. “Europe have selected a brilliant golfing robot. Asked 
the obligatory question about how he was finding his first thrilling Ryder a 
Cup experience, the look on Rory’s face when Pieters deadpanned a ‘fine thank 
you’ was absolutely priceless!” There’s nothing quite like seeing a TV 
interviewer’s question treated with cool, calm disdain; Louis van Gaal looking 
poor old Geoff Shreeves up and down, all that.

So this has suddenly got very interesting indeed. A birdie for Phil Mickelson 
on 15, his team’s third in three holes. Martin Kaymer slides in a right-to-left 
12-footer to halve the hole, but the Americans are dormie three now. Up on the 
par-five 16th, Willett is on the green in two, while Westwood and Holmes are in 
the sand to the right of the green having played the same number of shots. 
Moore, blessed with less power, is lucky not to find the water; his ball 
nestles in the thick stuff guarding the front of it. And back on 14, Reed goes 
closest with his approach; ten feet to Rose and Stenson’s 25. A couple of these 
matches could go any way. TheRyder Cup

You’ll notice that Reed and Spieth are now only just the one hole up. That’s 
because Justin Rose’s putter has suddenly got a little warmer, and he’s turned 
in a right-to-left breaker from 30 feet on the par-three 13th for birdie. Reed 
needs to chip in, and he chunks his effort. Reed and Spieth wouldn’t be human 
if they didn’t start to think about what happened to them this morning, when 
they shipped a four-hole lead. Their three-hole afternoon advantage has been 
whittled down to one. Can they respond and repel the comeback this time?

United States of America 6½-6½ Europe

Koepka sends a fine tee shot at the par-three 17th sailing pin high, 15 feet 
to the left of the flag. Pieters is perhaps half the distance inside him. 
Koepka’s birdie putt thinks about dropping into the right-hand side of the cup, 
but it slips by the hole. Pieters calmly rolls his birdie putt in, and suddenly 
European nerves are settled! It’s a 3&1 win, and what a rookieRyder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> performance this is from 
24-year-old Thomas Pieters! And after their nightmare start this week, Europe 
have hauled the USA back to parity, even if it’s only for a while!

Westwood’s second at 15 spins back off the front of the green. He’s got a slow 
uphill birdie putt, with a big right-to-left break. He gets the line, but 
doesn’t hit it. Willett lands his in the centre of the green, nearly spins it 
into the cup, but falls off the front too. He fails to hit his putt as well. 
Moore therefore has a chance from ten feet - and it horseshoes out! A let-off 
for Europe there. Moore holds his head in his hands.

Kaymer responds to Mickelson’s attack at 14 with a fine approach of his own; 
he’s maybe a foot or so inside the American hero.Mickelson rattles in his 
birdie putt; Kaymer, out of sorts on the greens, lets his slither by. The US 
are three up and coasting in that game. Henrik Stenson finally makes a putt, 
his birdie effort on 12 pegging Reed and Spieth back to two up. But most of the 
tumult is on 16, where Pieters pars from the fringe, while Koepka takes two 
careful putts from distance for a birdie that further reduces Europe’s lead in 
that opening game! The nerves are clanging now!

Lee Westwood sends his second at 14 to five feet. A wonderful approach, but he

second pin high to three feet. The third match looked too close to call ten 
minutes ago; now the USA are preparing to press their Footjoy firmly on 
European throats!

Matt Kuchar sinks the putt of the week on 13! A 60-foot rake with a big 
right-to-left turn right at the end, and it drops in the hole! Kuchar and 
Mickelson shake and shimmy their shoulders in the sexxxxx style, while Sergio 
is caught in the foreground shaking his head sadly. What a magnificent monster 
putt! Sergio tries to do something similar, but lightning isn’t striking twice. 
And another huge blow for Europe up on 16, as Rory finds his ball, in the 
middle of the fairway, with half of the mud in Minnesota on top of it. The 
result is grimly predictable for Europe, as his 4-iron goes helicoptering into 
the lake on the left. The crowd gowild. It’s down to Pieters versus Koepka; the 
latter on the par-five green in two, the former closer to the flag, but just 
off it in the first cut for three.

“Hey! Rose! You’re in the way!” There’s some eejit shouting through the 
silence as Henrik Stenson prepares to strike a putt on 11. Rose is almost 
hopping about with rage as he spins round to face the crowd with dagger eyes. 
But to be fair, Reed doesn’t look very pleased either, as he angrily 
gesticulates an unambiguous SHUT IT to his own supporters. Stenson misses his 
ten-footer; Reed, similarly put off, pushes his eight-foot chance to snatch the 
hole right of the cup. Well done, sir!

Koepka and Johnson aren’t giving this up yet! Pieters isn’t too far away from 
his putt to win the match, but doesn’t give the huge right-to-left break quite 
enough. Dustin knocks in his birdie putt, and Europe are now just three up with 
three to play!

Pieters finds the front of the green at 15, so he’ll at least get a putt from 
20 feet for the match. Unless Koepka or Johnson do a Patrick Reed from back 
down the hole, of course. Koepka, from under a tree on the left, somehow fires 
his ball low, under branches and over water, onto the green, 30 feet from the 
flag. That insurance policy allows Dustin to attack, and he wedges to ten feet. 
A chance to extend the match. Meanwhile from the front of 12, Sergio curls a 
40-foot right-to-left birdie putt through the shadows and into the cup! Only 
Mickelson can stop him winning the hole as a result, and he nearly rakes in a 
35-footer of his own, but not quite. All those missed tiddlers, and then that! 
He has the good grace to wear a slightly disbelieving expression before 
breaking into a grin. And on 13, Willett can’t make his birdie putt, but Holmes 
certainly can; a brilliant two, and the second match is all square yet again!

McIlroy flays his drive at 15 out of bounds down the left. A punter living in 
a nearby house snaffles himself a lovely souvenir. More importantly in the 
overall picture, Lee Westwood pulls his tee shot at 13 into the drink. That 
leaves Willett on his own at the par three, in a match Europe can’t really 
afford to let slip. The Masters champ lands his ball pin high, but 20 feet 
away; JB Holmes sends his over the flag, and he’s in serious birdie range.

A birdie effort for Sergio on 11. It’s a fine putt from 25 feet, but it 
suddenly kinks to the left at the very last turn, and the US remain two holes 
up. Sergio spins and smiles an anguished smile. Meanwhile better news for 
Europe on 14, where Rory cracks a 383-yard drive down the track. A 383-yard 
drive! He’s in prime position to make a birdie that’ll win the hole, but his 
team-mate Pieters gets there first, and he doesn’t even need to putt out. 
Europe are dormie four in the opening rubber!

Stenson and Rose seem incapable of making headway into Reed and Spieth’s lead; 
there’s no spark. But they’re trying. Rose attempts to chip in from the side of 
10, having gone pin high but slightly right of the green, but his bump and run 
stays out to the right. Stenson has a look at a fairly straight 35-foot uphill 
putt, but it’s always high on the right. They both seriously overcook their 
efforts, too. Reed and Spieth have done nothing on the hole, but Stenson needs 
all his mettle to knock in a four-foot par saver to salvage a half. Something 
will have to happen there soon, or that match is a write-off for Europe, 
Patrick Reed’s brilliant four-hole spurt having blown them away.

Koepka is closest off the tee on the par-three 13th. A wonderful tee shot 
straight at the flag, ten feet shy. Pieters is perhaps another six feet behind 
him, and rattles in his birdie putt. That’s big if it stems the bleeding, 
stopping the loss of a third consecutive hole; it’s absolutely huge if Koepka 
pushes his putt to the right, and Europe go three up again. Rory again with the 
COME ONs. His vocal cords must look like a butcher’s window display.

Some pantomime amid the theatre. Holmes knocks in a 15-foot birdie putt on 11. 
It suddenly puts the pressure on Willett, who is half the distance inside him. 
He steps away from the shot when the breeze gets up, a move which encourages 
all manner of whistles, coos and boos from the home support. That Peter wants a 
clip round the lug. But you don’t win the Masters unless you’re made of the 
right stuff, and Willett holds himself together to knock his ball straight into 
the cup. Europe holding onto that lead by their fingernails.

A fine second into 9 by Rose, over the flag, stopping 12 feet past. He’ll have 
that for birdie after Spieth duffs a chip and Reed can’t chip in from off the 
left. But it’s got a huge right-to-left break, and he doesn’t give it enough. 
Rose’s putter has been stone cold all week. An opportunity for Europe missed, 
and the US take a three-hole lead to the turn. Micklelson rakes in a snaky 
30-footer across 10, and the US move two clear in that match. And Dustin does 
indeed seal the deal on 12, and suddenly Europe are looking a bit shaky this 
afternoon. The next couple of hours are so crucial; the hosts have the edge 
right now.

Dustin Johnson turns up the heat in the first game! He clips his approach to 
six feet, a magnificent shot. Rory, from the middle of the fairway, hits a hot 
one through the green. The USA are in a very strong position on that hole, and 
should Dustin seal the deal to make it two in a row, European nerves will start 
jangling like a mid-80s music-magazine cover mount.

Rose’s par effort at 8 is pretty lame, really. A waft that drifts off in quite 
violent fashion to the right, a spectacular detour given the short distance to 
the hole. A complete misread, with a push thrown in. Reed pops in his birdie 
putt, and that’s four holes in a row for the USA in the final match! Reed mimes 
a bit of weightlifting, and screams a COME OOOONNNNN. He isbuzzing. The crowd 
respond with quite a bit of volume of their own. Meanwhile there’s a dramatic 
turnaround on the 11th green, where McIlroy bumps a slightly fortunate wedge 
off a ridge by a bunker to five feet, then watches as Dustin gets up and down 
from a tricky lie in sand, before missing his short one. That’s a hole back for 
the USA. Maybe the comeback is on after all. Lee Westwood rakes a birdie putt 
across 10 and into the hole to regain the lead for Europe in match two, Danny 
Willett no longer required to knock in the four-footer he’d left himself with a 
fine approach. And there should be scoreboard movement in all four matches, but 
Garcia misses another eminently makeable putt, this time from eight feet on 9, 
and the US remain one shot in the lead there. This is some afternoon’s golf!

Patrick Reed is blistering hot at the moment! One quiet but powerful swish of 
his club, and a tee shot at 8 lands in the no-nonsense style, three feet from 
the flag! Jordan Spieth’s follow up, pin high to 12 feet, looks positively 
average in this crazy context. Reed issuch a fun player to watch. Though he was 
arguably even better at Gleneagles, when he was taking on the entire away crowd 
all on his own - and winning. Rose fires his tee shot to eight feet; with 
Stenson nowhere close, stopping the force of nature that is Reed will be down 
to Rose.

It’s three holes in a row for Reed and Spieth! The latter had driven into the 
water at 7, so it was up to his partner, and Reed didn’t disappoint. He knocked 
his second close, and was never missing the putt. JB Holmes, meanwhile, ripped 
a huge drive down 9, wedged to a couple of feet, and tapped in for a birdie 
that brings the second match level again. The US team were looking a little 
bedraggled a while back; now they’re beginning to slowly turn the scoreboard 
around!

McIlroy clips a fine wedge into 10, setting himself up with a birdie chance 
from ten feet.But he’ll have to make it, because Koepka has eased a delightful 
one to 18 inches. That’s conceded. It deserves to win the hole, really, but it 
doesn’t, because McIlroy rolls his putt straight into the cup, and lets rip a 
blood-curdling COME OOOOOOOONNNNN then a couple more COME ONs which qualify as 
restrained by comparison but certainly wouldn’t be acceptable in a library. 
That’s denied Koepka and Johnson the sniff of a comeback. Or at least put it on 
hold. Back on 8, Kaymer - who has contributed next to nothing so far this week 
- fires his tee shot straight at the flag. He’s got an uphill eight footer to 
win the hole, but he pushes it out right. That’s dismal. He’s been as poor a 
captain’s pick as Pieters has been fine.

Sergio clips a wedge from 50 yards to 12 inches at 7. Even he’s not missing 
that; it’s conceded, and that halves Mickelson and Kuchar’s lead; the USA are 
just one up. That’s the least he could do after those missed tiddlers. Imagine 
how many majors Sergio would have won if he never had to use his putter! 
Meanwhile Koepka can’t deny McIlroy at 9; Rory taps in for a brilliant birdie 
and Europe are four up at the turn in that match.

Patrick Reed will see Rory’s stunner, and upgrade it to stupendous! From the 
middle of the 6th fairway, Reed lands his wedge 15 feet past the pin. The ball 
bites, jumps up and down a couple of times, spins backwards, and makes its 
sweet old way into the cup! An eagle from the fairway! What a way to win a 
hole! Which, incidentally, it’s the 100th Reed and Spieth have played together 
in this competition! Two holes in a row, and these young geniuses have shaken 
off their mid-day torpor, all right!

A stunner from Rory McIlroy on 9. He’s banged a drive down the middle of the 
fairway, then launched a short iron straight at the flag. “Be good.” It is 
good. It lands three feet shy of the cup, and bites. Not quite dead, but close. 
Brooks Koepka, on in regulation but 25 feet away, will need to do something 
nice with his putter, you’d imagine. (Dustin and Pieters have been faffing 
about.)

Yes, Sergio’s head is addled. He pitches to four feet on the par-five 6th, and 
has that to win the hole. But he misses another short one, high on the left, a 
pull. Europe remain two down in that match, and Sergio wears a drained, haunted 
expression. That’s three terrible yips today. He needs to put those behind him. 
He’s not very good at putting things behind him, though, is he. Po’ Sergio. Po’ 
Sergio’s a-cold. Meanwhile a crazy moment for Danny Willett down 7. He’s in the 
rough down the right, and his second takes a flyer. It’s off into the drink, 
but hits something hard in the hazard betwixt hole and water, launches miles 
into the air, and somehow spins back into the rough by the left of the green. 
Turns out, though, that he needn’t have used up a precious scrap of outrageous 
luck. Holmes and Moore had got wet earlier anyway, and on the green his partner 
Westwood rattles home a birdie putt from 40 feet. The hole’s Europe’s. Westwood 
walks off the green ten feet tall. Willett is merely chuckling.

Nobody goes particularly close with their tee shots in the opening match at 
the par-three 8th.Pieters is faced with a 50-foot uphill putt; for a minute he 
thinks he’s drained it, and moves his putter north to celebrate it, but is 
forced to pretend to scratch the back of his head pretty darn quick. Dustin has 
a look from similar distance, then misses his par putt. Koepka races his 
25-footer across the green and five past the hole. He can’t make the one coming 
back. That gives Pieters a chance to clean up for par and the hole. Europe are 
three up. But the glamour pairing have pulled themselves out of their tailspin 
in the last match; a birdie for Patrick Reed on 5 brings that match all level. 
And maybe Reed and Spieth are finally out of a funk that started maybe three 
hours ago, and cost the USA a point this afternoon? Meanwhile Moore, Holmes, 
Willett and Westwood have been put on the clock. And the time pressure has 
forced both of the Americans to wing their tee shots into the water at 7.

It’s still all square in the second match. Ryan Moore, who proved his 
match-play moxie last weekend by pushing Rory McIlroy all the way at the Tour 
Championship, pops in for birdie at 6; Lee Westwood, who missed a couple of 
daft ones from Sergio Range yesterday, matches his score by making a 
knee-knocking five-footer. The atmosphere at Hazeltine is beginning to bubble 
up nicely, with a few drinks having been taken, and the crowds slipping into 
Boisterous Mode. Magnificent fun. All part of theRyder Cup

Pieters three-putts from close range. That’s a terrible mess. But no matter! 
From the back of the green, McIlroy - who had got his partner to finish up 
first - rolls his birdie putt into the cup from 25 feet! Johnson and Koepka 
would have been hopeful of a win; now they need to make one of their putts for 
a half. Dustin sees his from 15 feet slide by, but Koepka makes no mistake, 
slotting his straight into the cup, a brilliant pressure putt. For the second 
hole in a row, Europe have denied their opponents after watching them go 
closest with their wedge. Better news for the States on 5; Garcia is in fact 
just off the back of the green, and he chips close for his birdie. But Kuchar 
gets up and down from a tight spot to the left, holing out from 20 feet, and 
that’s a half that’ll feel like a win in the wake of their drives!

Pieters is a confident young chap. On 7, Koepka wedges brilliantly to ten 
feet. So Pieters asks him to walk up to the green and mark his ball before he 
has a go himself. He fancies going close. Which, in fairness, he does, though 
not as close as Koepka. McIlroy and Johnson are on the green in regulation too, 
but neither are too close to the flag. Meanwhile back on the driveable par-four 
5th, Mickelson flays his tee shot miles right, Kuchar way to the left. That 
opens the door a wee bit for Sergio, who finds it easier to get the ball on a 
green from 352 yards than he does into a cup from 24 inches. Europe need a 
momentum shifter in the third match; could this be a chance?

Oh Sergio! He missed a tiddler on 11 earlier today, and now he’s yipped a 
godawful putt to the right of the hole at 4 from little more than two feet. 
That’s abysmal, and Europe will hope that doesn’t mangle his head this 
afternoon, because his playing partner Martin Kaymer has appeared woefully out 
of form this week.

Four feet for Pieters, but it’s already a big putt in the context of the match.
 If he somehow denies Dustin, after the big man’s majestic wedge, it’ll give 
Europe a boost. And of course keep them two holes clear. And in it goes. The 
hole halved. No fuss, no emotion. He quietly bends down to pick up Dustin’s 
marker and tosses it gently towards his opponent, calm as you like. A picture 
of insouciance.

A stunning wedge into the monster par-five 6th by Dustin, who sends his ball 
screeching to a stop right by the flag. It’s not conceded, but in effect it’s a 
gimme. Rory responds by thinning an awful chip of his own straight through the 
green. It’s all down to Pieters, who wedges to five feet. Under normal 
circumstances, that would look exceptional; but Dustin’s just donethat.

Moore can’t make his ten footer at 4. That leaves Willett with a chance to 
make the first mark in match two, but his putt from eight feet is always 
staying high on the left. Back on 3, Mickelson finds himself down a large slope 
to the left of the green. He chips up and sends his ball rolling serenely 
across 50 feet of dancefloor before stopping dead at the hole. Birdie. Sergio 
still has a chance to halve the hole, and 99 times out of 100 his 12-footer 
would drop. But it navigates the entire circumference of the cup at a comically 
slow speed, and resolutely refuses to drop! You’ll not see that too often, and 
instead of looking gutted, Sergio bursts into genuine laughter. That was very 
odd. Sergio unlucky, but Mickelson’s chip up was so good, it deserved reward. 
The US go one up.

The standard of golf right now is off the scale, especially when you consider 
the pressure everyone’s operating under.Do they put beta blockers in the water 
in Minnesota? Spieth finds the middle of the 2nd, pin high, 12 feet from the 
flag, and rolls the putt straight into the cup for birdie. But Stenson’s 
matched him shot for shot there, and rolls in his eight-footer to halve the 
hole. Meanwhile Willett and Moore have peppered the flag at the par-three 4th; 
birdie chances coming up.

Pieters drives the green at the short par-four 5th. First up, McIlroy gets up 
and down from the fringe to make birdie, and give his partner a free run at the 
putt for eagle. It’s a gentle left-to-right slider from 20 feet, and it’s 
always heading for the hole. The American pair don’t even get chance to putt 
for their birdies! Europe off to a flyer in the opening match.

It’s been some start to the second match. Willett looked to have won the 
second hole with a wonder chip-in from down the bank, but Holmes denied him 
with a fine birdie putt. Now the boot’s on the other foot at 3, as Holmes gets 
up and down from a bunker for birdie, only to see Willett trundle in a 
12-footer to halve the hole. They’re all square; both JB and the Masters 
champion look in the mood right now!

Thanks to Gregg there. A couple of daft putts on 4, here. First Pieters hits 
his six-foot birdie effort way too hard, negating the break. Then Koepka prods 
with great uncertainty at a three-footer, and the tiddler horseshoes out. 
Chances spurned; Europe remain a hole up. On 2, Garcia knocks his second close; 
that’s a certain birdie. But Kuchar drains a 30-footer first, and Sergio can 
only secure a half. Then in the final match, Stenson’s birdie from long range 
spooks both Reed and Spieth, who both miss from inside 15 feet; are they still 
reeling from their awful collapse this morning?

The final fourballs match is under way with four fine drives and absolutely no 
wobbles off the tee. It’s a high calibre matchup between Reed and Spieth and 
Rose and Stenson, whose dodgy knee was rested this morning. Oh, and speaking of 
being rested, Scott Murray is back. So I will hand back to the main man. Enjoy 
the golf!

Up on the 1st green, Sergio punches the air as Kaymer makes sure he doesn’t 
have to putt by halving the hole for him. He showed fantastic powers of 
recovery there having landed his tee shot in the sand. Meanwhile, Holmes holes 
a monster birdie putt to deny Willett and Europe a point on the 2nd. Oh this 
afternoon is going to be good all right. While, ahead of them on the 3rd, it’s 
birdies all round to leave Europe 1Up in that one.

Well, Willett has just gone and silenced the boo-boys in emphatic style! 
Having missed the green with his second shot on the 2nd, he has a chip over a 
little hillock and down on to the putting surface. He takes a little look at it 
and shows feather-fingered touch with a little dink, sending the ball on its 
merry way, where it bounces once and rolls up to the cup before dropping in to 
wild cheers! He clenches his fist and punches the air, displaying a wonderful 
smile. What a moment for the Masters champion! Is it enough to win the hole? 
We’ll see.

Did I say McIlroy might not have a disastrous lie? It’s bloody brilliant. His 
drive has carried almost 380 yards and landed just in front of a path on some 
flattened rough. He clatters his long-iron through a gap between some trees and 
lands it about 30 yards short of the green, almost carrying it over a little 
bunker. He’ll be very happy with that outcome. Koepka followed McIlroy to a 
similar location but his second shot is sliced way out to the right. Meanwhile, 
back on the 2nd Westwood has dug his second shot out of the sand and found the 
green. While, on the 1st Kuchar an García have gone pin-hunting. Kuchar landing 
his second a few feet from the pin, García just a little further away. The hole 
could be halved on a pair of birdies. Fine strokes, both.

Just moments after putting Europe 1up in the first match, the adrenaline gets 
to McIlroy and his drive on the monstrous 3rd goes whistling past the 
spectators on the left, hopping up off a stone path and dropping out of sight.
Mind you, the terrain out there is very likely well trodden. So his lie might 
not be disastrous. Back on the 1st. Mickelson and Kuchar get their match under 
way against Garcia and Kaymer. Garcia’s been in fine fist-pumping form so far 
in this tournament. Of the four drives only Kaymer’s is iffy, taking a course 
out right and skidding into a huge bunker. He may well have to rely on his 
Spanish playing partner to half this hole. Mickelson has the best line into the 
pin.

On the 2nd, Pieters misses the green and gives himself a difficult chip from 
the lush semi-rough. His stroke lacks belief, though, and the balls catches the 
whispy stuff and slows down on the way to the flag. McIlroy’s approach finds 
the front of the 2nd green and it will be down to him to try to win this hole. 
He has a 20-footer uphill with a little left to right break on it. He gives it 
some juice, the line looks good … because it is good. Plop! In it goes. A 
birdie! Dustin Johnson to answer. He can’t. Europe 1up in the first match. Back 
on the 1st Willett finds the green with a wonderfully improvised iron off the 
semi-rough while stood in the bunker. Westwood, plays a regulation approach 
into the green as do Holmes and Moore. But Westwood’s putting is awry and it’s 
up to Willett to halve teh hole after two fine efforts with his putter.

Koepka/D Johnson v McIlroy/Pieters 1UP (2)

close  
So Europe, having suffered that nightmare session on Friday morning, battled 
their way back to parity ... only for the USA to tear away again. It’s almost 
as though they were teasing the visitors. But after some stunning play from 
Phil Mickelson, JB Holmes, Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar, a nightmare yip by Phil 
Mickelson, and a genuinely stellar display by the outstanding Patrick Reed, the 
USA take a three-shot lead going into tomorrow’s singles. They just need to win 
five of the 12 rubbers to get their hands on theRyder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> for the first time since 2008. 
Whatever happens tomorrow, it’s going to be memorable. Wherever your loyalties 
lie, you’ll make sure to join us, won’t you? Singles start just after 11am 
local time, 5pm in the UK. See you tomorrow!

It just looks like delaying the inevitable. Neither Stenson nor Rose go close 
with their tee shots, while that man Patrick Reed caresses his over the flag to 
12 feet. Spieth, who hasn’t really needed to do much today, dumps his tee shot 
in the water. So it’s down to Reed. And Reed is more than enough for Europe. 
Stenson’s birdie effort from 25 feet, snaking down the green, is tremendous, 
but it somehow stays out on the left lip. Reed can’t convert his ninth birdie 
of the afternoon, but that’s a 2&1 win and one of the great individualRyder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> performances. Patrick Reed, ladies 
and gentlemen!

2&1 Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (F)
 
But rather incredibly, there’s still life in the final match! Patrick Reed has 
a 15-foot putt for his eagle; Henrik Stenson is just off the green in two. The 
crowd chant Patrick Reed’s name, over and again. He waves his hands in the air. 
And so Stenson trundles in a downhill chip from the fringe! It spooks Reed, who 
leaves his putt high on the right, and the match move on to 17! Europe are 
desperate for anything they can get now. A half-point here would be so precious 
for Europe. But we’re still in pipe-dream territory, for the US pair are still 
two up with two to play, for all the drama that’s just unfolded.

2UP Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (16)
 
Nope! Shades of Craig Stadler at the Belfry in 1985! What an appalling yip! 
And an unwelcome place inRyder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> 
history for Lee Westwood. The USA win the final match by one hole, and the 
victory came gift-wrapped by Westwood. Willett provided the finger as he tied 
the bow.

1UP Holmes/Moore v Willett/Westwood (F)
3UP Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (15)
 
Every half point counts, and now it’s fairly clear that Willett and Westwood 
desperately need something going up 18.They might get it, too, with Moore 
sending his ball through the back of the green, then chunking the chip coming 
back. Holmes makes his par. But Westwood, who really does owe Europe and his 
captain for the pick, knocks his second to three feet. Willett is within 12 
feet, too. Two chances for a birdie and a precious half point, then! Willett 
lets his putt race by the hole. So it’s down to Westwood. Can he make the short 
putt and halve the match?
 
It’s Garcia versus Mickelson on 17. They’re both six feet from the flag, 
facing birdie putts. Garcia makes his, which forces Mickelson to make his if he 
wants to close out the match here. And it was always going in the middle! 
That’s a 2&1 victory, and the home side takes the overall lead again!

1UP Holmes/Moore v Willett/Westwood (17)
2&1 Mickelson/Kuchar v Kaymer/Garcia (F)
3UP Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (15)
 
This is a simply amazing response to letting that lead slip by Patrick Reed! 
After what happened this morning, the young man would have been forgiven for 
crumbling. But he’s just carded back-to-back birdies to take this match away 
from Europe! He’s made seven birdies today! The performance of the week, 
without question. He’s an amazing player. Compare and contrast the dismal 
efforts of Willett and Westwood on 17; with one man in the water and another 20 
feet from the flag, they both bogeyed to hand the hole, and perhaps the match, 
to their opponents. The USA are putting the pedal to the metal, and as things 
stand they’ll go into tomorrow’s singles in a very dominant position. It’s no 
more than they deserve for this comprehensive afternoon display.

1UP Holmes/Moore v Willett/Westwood (17)
2UP Mickelson/Kuchar v Kaymer/Garcia (16)
3UP Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (15)
 
There’s already drama going on at 17, of course. Holmes got wet, while Moore 
found the back of the green, tickling a 20-footer to within one turn of 
dropping for a sensational birdie. But it’s just par. Willett has a chip from 
the side of the green to win the hole; he duffs it, leaving his ball ten feet 
short, and he can’t make the putt. Which leaves Westwood with a downhill 
five-footer to halve the hole. He pushes it predictably to the right, and the 
USA are up in all three remaining rubbers! Even more so, now Reed has just 
birdied 15 to move the States dormie three in that match!

1UP Holmes/Moore v Willett/Westwood (17)
2UP Mickelson/Kuchar v Kaymer/Garcia (16)
3UP Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (15)
 
Sergio very nearly rakes in a 40-footer for eagle on 16. It doesn’t drop, 
which means Kuchar has a birdie putt to close out the match. But his 20-footer 
doesn’t go in, Europe win the hole, and everyone moves on to 17.

Holmes/Moore A/S Willett/Westwood (16)
2UP Mickelson/Kuchar v Kaymer/Garcia (16)
2UP Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (14)
 
Sheer brilliance from JB Holmes and Patrick Reed back there. They’re letting 
nothing slip, with the Europeans trying their damnedest to turn the scoreboard 
blue. Europe will be feeling a little concerned; as things stand, the home 
heroes will be taking a two-point lead into tomorrow’s singles, a format in 
which, historically, they get the upper hand more often than not.
 
Westwood bashes his ball out of sand at 16 to four feet; Holmes bashes his to 
two. Then Willett has a long look at his eagle, but doesn’t really hit it. He 
knocks in the four footer he leaves himself, though, and with Holmes’ putt 
conceded, that’s the hole halved in birdie! Meanwhile neither Rose nor Stenson 
can make their birdies on 14, but Reed can! Theyhave arrested the downward 
momentum this time, and how they celebrate with relief! This is justwonderful 
to-and-fro match play. “Following Sky’s interview just now with Rory and 
Pieters, I think we may be on the brink of the latest major sporting scandal,” 
reports George Wright. “Europe have selected a brilliant golfing robot. Asked 
the obligatory question about how he was finding his first thrilling Ryder a 
Cup experience, the look on Rory’s face when Pieters deadpanned a ‘fine thank 
you’ was absolutely priceless!” There’s nothing quite like seeing a TV 
interviewer’s question treated with cool, calm disdain; Louis van Gaal looking 
poor old Geoff Shreeves up and down, all that.

So this has suddenly got very interesting indeed. A birdie for Phil Mickelson 
on 15, his team’s third in three holes. Martin Kaymer slides in a right-to-left 
12-footer to halve the hole, but the Americans are dormie three now. Up on the 
par-five 16th, Willett is on the green in two, while Westwood and Holmes are in 
the sand to the right of the green having played the same number of shots. 
Moore, blessed with less power, is lucky not to find the water; his ball 
nestles in the thick stuff guarding the front of it. And back on 14, Reed goes 
closest with his approach; ten feet to Rose and Stenson’s 25. A couple of these 
matches could go any way. TheRyder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup>, ladies and gentlemen!

3UP Mickelson/Kuchar v Kaymer/Garcia (15)
1UP Reed/Spieth v Rose/Stenson (13)
 
You’ll notice that Reed and Spieth are now only just the one hole up. That’s 
because Justin Rose’s putter has suddenly got a little warmer, and he’s turned 
in a right-to-left breaker from 30 feet on the par-three 13th for birdie. Reed 
needs to chip in, and he chunks his effort. Reed and Spieth wouldn’t be human 
if they didn’t start to think about what happened to them this morning, when 
they shipped a four-hole lead. Their three-hole afternoon advantage has been 
whittled down to one. Can they respond and repel the comeback this time?

 
Koepka sends a fine tee shot at the par-three 17th sailing pin high, 15 feet 
to the left of the flag. Pieters is perhaps half the distance inside him. 
Koepka’s birdie putt thinks about dropping into the right-hand side of the cup, 
but it slips by the hole. Pieters calmly rolls his birdie putt in, and suddenly 
European nerves are settled! It’s a 3&1 win, and what a rookieRyder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> performance this is from 
24-year-old Thomas Pieters! And after their nightmare start this week, Europe 
have hauled the USA back to parity, even if it’s only for a while!

Westwood’s second at 15 spins back off the front of the green. He’s got a slow 
uphill birdie putt, with a big right-to-left break. He gets the line, but 
doesn’t hit it. Willett lands his in the centre of the green, nearly spins it 
into the cup, but falls off the front too. He fails to hit his putt as well. 
Moore therefore has a chance from ten feet - and it horseshoes out! A let-off 
for Europe there. Moore holds his head in his hands.

Kaymer responds to Mickelson’s attack at 14 with a fine approach of his own; 
he’s maybe a foot or so inside the American hero.Mickelson rattles in his 
birdie putt; Kaymer, out of sorts on the greens, lets his slither by. The US 
are three up and coasting in that game. Henrik Stenson finally makes a putt, 
his birdie effort on 12 pegging Reed and Spieth back to two up. But most of the 
tumult is on 16, where Pieters pars from the fringe, while Koepka takes two 
careful putts from distance for a birdie that further reduces Europe’s lead in 
that opening game! The nerves are clanging now!

Lee Westwood sends his second at 14 to five feet. A wonderful approach, but he 
pulls the short putt he’s left himself, and the chance to grab a crucial lead 
for Europe flies by. As they vacate the green, Mickelson sends a spectacular 
second pin high to three feet. The third match looked too close to call ten 
minutes ago; now the USA are preparing to press their Footjoy firmly on 
European throats!

Matt Kuchar sinks the putt of the week on 13! A 60-foot rake with a big 
right-to-left turn right at the end, and it drops in the hole! Kuchar and 
Mickelson shake and shimmy their shoulders in the sexxxxx style, while Sergio 
is caught in the foreground shaking his head sadly. What a magnificent monster 
putt! Sergio tries to do something similar, but lightning isn’t striking twice. 
And another huge blow for Europe up on 16, as Rory finds his ball, in the 
middle of the fairway, with half of the mud in Minnesota on top of it. The 
result is grimly predictable for Europe, as his 4-iron goes helicoptering into 
the lake on the left. The crowd gowild. It’s down to Pieters versus Koepka; the 
latter on the par-five green in two, the former closer to the flag, but just 
off it in the first cut for three.

“Hey! Rose! You’re in the way!” There’s some eejit shouting through the 
silence as Henrik Stenson prepares to strike a putt on 11. Rose is almost 
hopping about with rage as he spins round to face the crowd with dagger eyes. 
But to be fair, Reed doesn’t look very pleased either, as he angrily 
gesticulates an unambiguous SHUT IT to his own supporters. Stenson misses his 
ten-footer; Reed, similarly put off, pushes his eight-foot chance to snatch the 
hole right of the cup. Well done, sir!

Koepka and Johnson aren’t giving this up yet! Pieters isn’t too far away from 
his putt to win the match, but doesn’t give the huge right-to-left break quite 
enough. Dustin knocks in his birdie putt, and Europe are now just three up with 
three to play!

Pieters finds the front of the green at 15, so he’ll at least get a putt from 
20 feet for the match. Unless Koepka or Johnson do a Patrick Reed from back 
down the hole, of course. Koepka, from under a tree on the left, somehow fires 
his ball low, under branches and over water, onto the green, 30 feet from the 
flag. That insurance policy allows Dustin to attack, and he wedges to ten feet. 
A chance to extend the match. Meanwhile from the front of 12, Sergio curls a 
40-foot right-to-left birdie putt through the shadows and into the cup! Only 
Mickelson can stop him winning the hole as a result, and he nearly rakes in a 
35-footer of his own, but not quite. All those missed tiddlers, and then that! 
He has the good grace to wear a slightly disbelieving expression before 
breaking into a grin. And on 13, Willett can’t make his birdie putt, but Holmes 
certainly can; a brilliant two, and the second match is all square yet again!

McIlroy flays his drive at 15 out of bounds down the left. A punter living in 
a nearby house snaffles himself a lovely souvenir. More importantly in the 
overall picture, Lee Westwood pulls his tee shot at 13 into the drink. That 
leaves Willett on his own at the par three, in a match Europe can’t really 
afford to let slip. The Masters champ lands his ball pin high, but 20 feet 
away; JB Holmes sends his over the flag, and he’s in serious birdie range.
 
A birdie effort for Sergio on 11. It’s a fine putt from 25 feet, but it 
suddenly kinks to the left at the very last turn, and the US remain two holes 
up. Sergio spins and smiles an anguished smile. Meanwhile better news for 
Europe on 14, where Rory cracks a 383-yard drive down the track. A 383-yard 
drive! He’s in prime position to make a birdie that’ll win the hole, but his 
team-mate Pieters gets there first, and he doesn’t even need to putt out. 
Europe are dormie four in the opening rubber!

Stenson and Rose seem incapable of making headway into Reed and Spieth’s lead; 
there’s no spark. But they’re trying. Rose attempts to chip in from the side of 
10, having gone pin high but slightly right of the green, but his bump and run 
stays out to the right. Stenson has a look at a fairly straight 35-foot uphill 
putt, but it’s always high on the right. They both seriously overcook their 
efforts, too. Reed and Spieth have done nothing on the hole, but Stenson needs 
all his mettle to knock in a four-foot par saver to salvage a half. Something 
will have to happen there soon, or that match is a write-off for Europe, 
Patrick Reed’s brilliant four-hole spurt having blown them away.

Koepka is closest off the tee on the par-three 13th. A wonderful tee shot 
straight at the flag, ten feet shy. Pieters is perhaps another six feet behind 
him, and rattles in his birdie putt. That’s big if it stems the bleeding, 
stopping the loss of a third consecutive hole; it’s absolutely huge if Koepka 
pushes his putt to the right, and Europe go three up again. Rory again with the 
COME ONs. His vocal cords must look like a butcher’s window display.

Some pantomime amid the theatre. Holmes knocks in a 15-foot birdie putt on 11. 
It suddenly puts the pressure on Willett, who is half the distance inside him. 
He steps away from the shot when the breeze gets up, a move which encourages 
all manner of whistles, coos and boos from the home support. That Peter wants a 
clip round the lug. But you don’t win the Masters unless you’re made of the 
right stuff, and Willett holds himself together to knock his ball straight into 
the cup. Europe holding onto that lead by their fingernails.

A fine second into 9 by Rose, over the flag, stopping 12 feet past. He’ll have 
that for birdie after Spieth duffs a chip and Reed can’t chip in from off the 
left. But it’s got a huge right-to-left break, and he doesn’t give it enough. 
Rose’s putter has been stone cold all week. An opportunity for Europe missed, 
and the US take a three-hole lead to the turn. Micklelson rakes in a snaky 
30-footer across 10, and the US move two clear in that match. And Dustin does 
indeed seal the deal on 12, and suddenly Europe are looking a bit shaky this 
afternoon. The next couple of hours are so crucial; the hosts have the edge 
right now.

Dustin Johnson turns up the heat in the first game! He clips his approach to 
six feet, a magnificent shot. Rory, from the middle of the fairway, hits a hot 
one through the green. The USA are in a very strong position on that hole, and 
should Dustin seal the deal to make it two in a row, European nerves will start 
jangling like a mid-80s music-magazine cover mount.

Rose’s par effort at 8 is pretty lame, really. A waft that drifts off in quite 
violent fashion to the right, a spectacular detour given the short distance to 
the hole. A complete misread, with a push thrown in. Reed pops in his birdie 
putt, and that’s four holes in a row for the USA in the final match! Reed mimes 
a bit of weightlifting, and screams a COME OOOONNNNN. He isbuzzing. The crowd 
respond with quite a bit of volume of their own. Meanwhile there’s a dramatic 
turnaround on the 11th green, where McIlroy bumps a slightly fortunate wedge 
off a ridge by a bunker to five feet, then watches as Dustin gets up and down 
from a tricky lie in sand, before missing his short one. That’s a hole back for 
the USA. Maybe the comeback is on after all. Lee Westwood rakes a birdie putt 
across 10 and into the hole to regain the lead for Europe in match two, Danny 
Willett no longer required to knock in the four-footer he’d left himself with a 
fine approach. And there should be scoreboard movement in all four matches, but 
Garcia misses another eminently makeable putt, this time from eight feet on 9, 
and the US remain one shot in the lead there. This is some afternoon’s golf!

Patrick Reed is blistering hot at the moment! One quiet but powerful swish of 
his club, and a tee shot at 8 lands in the no-nonsense style, three feet from 
the flag! Jordan Spieth’s follow up, pin high to 12 feet, looks positively 
average in this crazy context. Reed issuch a fun player to watch. Though he was 
arguably even better at Gleneagles, when he was taking on the entire away crowd 
all on his own - and winning. Rose fires his tee shot to eight feet; with 
Stenson nowhere close, stopping the force of nature that is Reed will be down 
to Rose.

It’s three holes in a row for Reed and Spieth! The latter had driven into the 
water at 7, so it was up to his partner, and Reed didn’t disappoint. He knocked 
his second close, and was never missing the putt. JB Holmes, meanwhile, ripped 
a huge drive down 9, wedged to a couple of feet, and tapped in for a birdie 
that brings the second match level again. The US team were looking a little 
bedraggled a while back; now they’re beginning to slowly turn the scoreboard 
around!

McIlroy clips a fine wedge into 10, setting himself up with a birdie chance 
from ten feet.But he’ll have to make it, because Koepka has eased a delightful 
one to 18 inches. That’s conceded. It deserves to win the hole, really, but it 
doesn’t, because McIlroy rolls his putt straight into the cup, and lets rip a 
blood-curdling COME OOOOOOOONNNNN then a couple more COME ONs which qualify as 
restrained by comparison but certainly wouldn’t be acceptable in a library. 
That’s denied Koepka and Johnson the sniff of a comeback. Or at least put it on 
hold. Back on 8, Kaymer - who has contributed next to nothing so far this week 
- fires his tee shot straight at the flag. He’s got an uphill eight footer to 
win the hole, but he pushes it out right. That’s dismal. He’s been as poor a 
captain’s pick as Pieters has been fine.

Sergio clips a wedge from 50 yards to 12 inches at 7. Even he’s not missing 
that; it’s conceded, and that halves Mickelson and Kuchar’s lead; the USA are 
just one up. That’s the least he could do after those missed tiddlers. Imagine 
how many majors Sergio would have won if he never had to use his putter! 
Meanwhile Koepka can’t deny McIlroy at 9; Rory taps in for a brilliant birdie 
and Europe are four up at the turn in that match.

Patrick Reed will see Rory’s stunner, and upgrade it to stupendous! From the 
middle of the 6th fairway, Reed lands his wedge 15 feet past the pin. The ball 
bites, jumps up and down a couple of times, spins backwards, and makes its 
sweet old way into the cup! An eagle from the fairway! What a way to win a 
hole! Which, incidentally, it’s the 100th Reed and Spieth have played together 
in this competition! Two holes in a row, and these young geniuses have shaken 
off their mid-day torpor, all right!

A stunner from Rory McIlroy on 9. He’s banged a drive down the middle of the 
fairway, then launched a short iron straight at the flag. “Be good.” It is 
good. It lands three feet shy of the cup, and bites. Not quite dead, but close. 
Brooks Koepka, on in regulation but 25 feet away, will need to do something 
nice with his putter, you’d imagine. (Dustin and Pieters have been faffing 
about.)

Yes, Sergio’s head is addled. He pitches to four feet on the par-five 6th, and 
has that to win the hole. But he misses another short one, high on the left, a 
pull. Europe remain two down in that match, and Sergio wears a drained, haunted 
expression. That’s three terrible yips today. He needs to put those behind him. 
He’s not very good at putting things behind him, though, is he. Po’ Sergio. Po’ 
Sergio’s a-cold. Meanwhile a crazy moment for Danny Willett down 7. He’s in the 
rough down the right, and his second takes a flyer. It’s off into the drink, 
but hits something hard in the hazard betwixt hole and water, launches miles 
into the air, and somehow spins back into the rough by the left of the green. 
Turns out, though, that he needn’t have used up a precious scrap of outrageous 
luck. Holmes and Moore had got wet earlier anyway, and on the green his partner 
Westwood rattles home a birdie putt from 40 feet. The hole’s Europe’s. Westwood 
walks off the green ten feet tall. Willett is merely chuckling.

Nobody goes particularly close with their tee shots in the opening match at 
the par-three 8th.Pieters is faced with a 50-foot uphill putt; for a minute he 
thinks he’s drained it, and moves his putter north to celebrate it, but is 
forced to pretend to scratch the back of his head pretty darn quick. Dustin has 
a look from similar distance, then misses his par putt. Koepka races his 
25-footer across the green and five past the hole. He can’t make the one coming 
back. That gives Pieters a chance to clean up for par and the hole. Europe are 
three up. But the glamour pairing have pulled themselves out of their tailspin 
in the last match; a birdie for Patrick Reed on 5 brings that match all level. 
And maybe Reed and Spieth are finally out of a funk that started maybe three 
hours ago, and cost the USA a point this afternoon? Meanwhile Moore, Holmes, 
Willett and Westwood have been put on the clock. And the time pressure has 
forced both of the Americans to wing their tee shots into the water at 7.

It’s still all square in the second match. Ryan Moore, who proved his 
match-play moxie last weekend by pushing Rory McIlroy all the way at the Tour 
Championship, pops in for birdie at 6; Lee Westwood, who missed a couple of 
daft ones from Sergio Range yesterday, matches his score by making a 
knee-knocking five-footer. The atmosphere at Hazeltine is beginning to bubble 
up nicely, with a few drinks having been taken, and the crowds slipping into 
Boisterous Mode. Magnificent fun. All part of theRyder Cup

Pieters three-putts from close range. That’s a terrible mess. But no matter! 
From the back of the green, McIlroy - who had got his partner to finish up 
first - rolls his birdie putt into the cup from 25 feet! Johnson and Koepka 
would have been hopeful of a win; now they need to make one of their putts for 
a half. Dustin sees his from 15 feet slide by, but Koepka makes no mistake, 
slotting his straight into the cup, a brilliant pressure putt. For the second 
hole in a row, Europe have denied their opponents after watching them go 
closest with their wedge. Better news for the States on 5; Garcia is in fact 
just off the back of the green, and he chips close for his birdie. But Kuchar 
gets up and down from a tight spot to the left, holing out from 20 feet, and 
that’s a half that’ll feel like a win in the wake of their drives!

Pieters is a confident young chap. On 7, Koepka wedges brilliantly to ten 
feet. So Pieters asks him to walk up to the green and mark his ball before he 
has a go himself. He fancies going close. Which, in fairness, he does, though 
not as close as Koepka. McIlroy and Johnson are on the green in regulation too, 
but neither are too close to the flag. Meanwhile back on the driveable par-four 
5th, Mickelson flays his tee shot miles right, Kuchar way to the left. That 
opens the door a wee bit for Sergio, who finds it easier to get the ball on a 
green from 352 yards than he does into a cup from 24 inches. Europe need a 
momentum shifter in the third match; could this be a chance?

Oh Sergio! He missed a tiddler on 11 earlier today, and now he’s yipped a 
godawful putt to the right of the hole at 4 from little more than two feet. 
That’s abysmal, and Europe will hope that doesn’t mangle his head this 
afternoon, because his playing partner Martin Kaymer has appeared woefully out 
of form this week.

Four feet for Pieters, but it’s already a big putt in the context of the match.
 If he somehow denies Dustin, after the big man’s majestic wedge, it’ll give 
Europe a boost. And of course keep them two holes clear. And in it goes. The 
hole halved. No fuss, no emotion. He quietly bends down to pick up Dustin’s 
marker and tosses it gently towards his opponent, calm as you like. A picture 
of insouciance.

A stunning wedge into the monster par-five 6th by Dustin, who sends his ball 
screeching to a stop right by the flag. It’s not conceded, but in effect it’s a 
gimme. Rory responds by thinning an awful chip of his own straight through the 
green. It’s all down to Pieters, who wedges to five feet. Under normal 
circumstances, that would look exceptional; but Dustin’s just donethat.

Moore can’t make his ten footer at 4. That leaves Willett with a chance to 
make the first mark in match two, but his putt from eight feet is always 
staying high on the left. Back on 3, Mickelson finds himself down a large slope 
to the left of the green. He chips up and sends his ball rolling serenely 
across 50 feet of dancefloor before stopping dead at the hole. Birdie. Sergio 
still has a chance to halve the hole, and 99 times out of 100 his 12-footer 
would drop. But it navigates the entire circumference of the cup at a comically 
slow speed, and resolutely refuses to drop! You’ll not see that too often, and 
instead of looking gutted, Sergio bursts into genuine laughter. That was very 
odd. Sergio unlucky, but Mickelson’s chip up was so good, it deserved reward. 
The US go one up.

The standard of golf right now is off the scale, especially when you consider 
the pressure everyone’s operating under.Do they put beta blockers in the water 
in Minnesota? Spieth finds the middle of the 2nd, pin high, 12 feet from the 
flag, and rolls the putt straight into the cup for birdie. But Stenson’s 
matched him shot for shot there, and rolls in his eight-footer to halve the 
hole. Meanwhile Willett and Moore have peppered the flag at the par-three 4th; 
birdie chances coming up.

Pieters drives the green at the short par-four 5th. First up, McIlroy gets up 
and down from the fringe to make birdie, and give his partner a free run at the 
putt for eagle. It’s a gentle left-to-right slider from 20 feet, and it’s 
always heading for the hole. The American pair don’t even get chance to putt 
for their birdies! Europe off to a flyer in the opening match.

It’s been some start to the second match. Willett looked to have won the 
second hole with a wonder chip-in from down the bank, but Holmes denied him 
with a fine birdie putt. Now the boot’s on the other foot at 3, as Holmes gets 
up and down from a bunker for birdie, only to see Willett trundle in a 
12-footer to halve the hole. They’re all square; both JB and the Masters 
champion look in the mood right now!

Thanks to Gregg there. A couple of daft putts on 4, here. First Pieters hits 
his six-foot birdie effort way too hard, negating the break. Then Koepka prods 
with great uncertainty at a three-footer, and the tiddler horseshoes out. 
Chances spurned; Europe remain a hole up. On 2, Garcia knocks his second close; 
that’s a certain birdie. But Kuchar drains a 30-footer first, and Sergio can 
only secure a half. Then in the final match, Stenson’s birdie from long range 
spooks both Reed and Spieth, who both miss from inside 15 feet; are they still 
reeling from their awful collapse this morning?

The final fourballs match is under way with four fine drives and absolutely no 
wobbles off the tee. It’s a high calibre matchup between Reed and Spieth and 
Rose and Stenson, whose dodgy knee was rested this morning. Oh, and speaking of 
being rested, Scott Murray is back. So I will hand back to the main man. Enjoy 
the golf!
 
Up on the 1st green, Sergio punches the air as Kaymer makes sure he doesn’t 
have to putt by halving the hole for him. He showed fantastic powers of 
recovery there having landed his tee shot in the sand. Meanwhile, Holmes holes 
a monster birdie putt to deny Willett and Europe a point on the 2nd. Oh this 
afternoon is going to be good all right. While, ahead of them on the 3rd, it’s 
birdies all round to leave Europe 1Up in that one.

Well, Willett has just gone and silenced the boo-boys in emphatic style! 
Having missed the green with his second shot on the 2nd, he has a chip over a 
little hillock and down on to the putting surface. He takes a little look at it 
and shows feather-fingered touch with a little dink, sending the ball on its 
merry way, where it bounces once and rolls up to the cup before dropping in to 
wild cheers! He clenches his fist and punches the air, displaying a wonderful 
smile. What a moment for the Masters champion! Is it enough to win the hole? 
We’ll see.
 
Did I say McIlroy might not have a disastrous lie? It’s bloody brilliant. His 
drive has carried almost 380 yards and landed just in front of a path on some 
flattened rough. He clatters his long-iron through a gap between some trees and 
lands it about 30 yards short of the green, almost carrying it over a little 
bunker. He’ll be very happy with that outcome. Koepka followed McIlroy to a 
similar location but his second shot is sliced way out to the right. Meanwhile, 
back on the 2nd Westwood has dug his second shot out of the sand and found the 
green. While, on the 1st Kuchar an García have gone pin-hunting. Kuchar landing 
his second a few feet from the pin, García just a little further away. The hole 
could be halved on a pair of birdies. Fine strokes, both.
 
Just moments after putting Europe 1up in the first match, the adrenaline gets 
to McIlroy and his drive on the monstrous 3rd goes whistling past the 
spectators on the left, hopping up off a stone path and dropping out of sight.
Mind you, the terrain out there is very likely well trodden. So his lie might 
not be disastrous. Back on the 1st. Mickelson and Kuchar get their match under 
way against Garcia and Kaymer. Garcia’s been in fine fist-pumping form so far 
in this tournament. Of the four drives only Kaymer’s is iffy, taking a course 
out right and skidding into a huge bunker. He may well have to rely on his 
Spanish playing partner to half this hole. Mickelson has the best line into the 
pin.
 
On the 2nd, Pieters misses the green and gives himself a difficult chip from 
the lush semi-rough. His stroke lacks belief, though, and the balls catches the 
whispy stuff and slows down on the way to the flag. McIlroy’s approach finds 
the front of the 2nd green and it will be down to him to try to win this hole. 
He has a 20-footer uphill with a little left to right break on it. He gives it 
some juice, the line looks good … because it is good. Plop! In it goes. A 
birdie! Dustin Johnson to answer. He can’t. Europe 1up in the first match. Back 
on the 1st Willett finds the green with a wonderfully improvised iron off the 
semi-rough while stood in the bunker. Westwood, plays a regulation approach 
into the green as do Holmes and Moore. But Westwood’s putting is awry and it’s 
up to Willett to halve teh hole after two fine efforts with his putter.
