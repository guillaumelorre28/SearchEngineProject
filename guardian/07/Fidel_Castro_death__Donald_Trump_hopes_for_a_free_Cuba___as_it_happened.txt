We’re wrapping up our live coverage of global reaction to the death of Fidel 
Castro <https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro>. Here’s a summary of 
the main points.

 * The Cuban government has now declared nine days of national mourning and 
announcedCastro’s ashes would be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-5839641de4b0e0ad2d75d409#block-5839641de4b0e0ad2d75d409>
 in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December.

 * US president Barack Obama extended a hand of friendship to the Cuban people 
and said “history will record and judge the enormous impact” of Castro.

 * US president-elect Donald Trump described Castro as a “brutal dictator who 
oppressed his own people for nearly six decades” and hoped his passing would 
lead to freedom for Cubans. 
 * Tributes have been paid by Latin American leaders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-58394052e4b0da4920d6c59c#block-58394052e4b0da4920d6c59c>
 including Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro; Mexican president, Enrique 
Peña Nieto; and Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa. 
 * Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised Castro as the “symbol of an 
era”, and the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev alsohailed him for 
“strengthening” his island nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-583955abe4b0da4920d6c5f7#block-583955abe4b0da4920d6c5f7>
. 
 * The Nelson Mandela Foundation <https://www.nelsonmandela.org/> sent its 
condolences 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-58394e50e4b0da4920d6c5d3#block-58394e50e4b0da4920d6c5d3>
 to the people and government of Cuba, and South African President Jacob Zuma

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-583963dde4b0da4920d6c637#block-583963dde4b0da4920d6c637>
 and support in the struggle to overthrow apartheid. 
 * But celebrations broke out in Little Havana, the Miami neighbourhood home 
to many Cubans in exile in the US.

 * And Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, said 
Castro was a “tyrant and thug” and hailed his death as an opportunity to “work 
for a Cuba that is free, democratic, and prosperous”.

United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has extended his condolences to 
the Cuban people.

“At this time of national mourning, I offer the support of the United Nations 
to work alongside the people of the island,” he said in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, 
where he is attending theGlobal Sustainable Transport Conference 
<https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/Global-Sustainable-Transport-Conference-2016>
.


Under former president Castro, Cuba made advances in the fields of education 
literacy and health. I hope thatCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> 
will continue to advance on a path of reform and greater prosperity.

He left a major imprint on his country and on global politics. His 
revolutionary ideals left few indifferent. He was a strong voice for social 
justice in global discussions at the UN General Assembly and international and 
regional forums.”

October, 2000. Photograph: Aaron Harris/AP 
Fidel Castro <https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro> had a close 
connection to Canada, particularly with former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, 
for whose 2000 funeral he served as an honorary pallbearer,writes Christopher 
Guly in Ottawa. Trudeau was the first Western leader to visit Cuba in January 
1976.

Trudeau’s son and the current Canadian PM, Justin, was in Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> earlier this month but did not meet 
with Castro. Justin Trudeau issued a statement today in which he expressed 
“deep sorrow” of learning of the death of the former Cuban president.

Fidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served his people for almost 
half a century. A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr Castro made 
significant improvements to the education and healthcare of his island nation. 
While a controversial figure, both Mr Castro’s supporters and detractors 
recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a 
deep and lasting affection forel Comandante.

I know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity 
to meet Fidel when my father passed away. It was also a real honour to meet his 
three sons and his brother, president Raúl Castro, during my recent visit to 
Cuba. On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to 
the family, friends and many, many supporters of Mr Castro. We join the people 
of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader.”

Not to be left behind, yet another senior Republican has offered his two 
cents’ worth on Castro’s passing.

House speaker Paul Ryan said much work remained to secure freedom for the 
Cuban people, adding:

Now that Fidel Castro <https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro> is 
dead, the cruelty and oppression of his regime should die with him. Today let 
us reflect on the memory and sacrifices of all those who have suffered under

Ted Cruz, the Texan senator (and another failed Republican presidential 
contender), has also issued a statement on Castro:

Fidel Castro’s death cannot bring back his thousands of victims, nor can it 
bring comfort to their families. Today we remember them and honor the brave 
souls who fought the lonely fight against the brutal Communist dictatorship he 
imposed onCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba>.”

Trump hopes for a 'free Cuba'

US president-elect, Donald Trump, has issued a statement about the death of 
Fidel Castro:

Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own 
people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, 
theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human 
rights.

While Cuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> remains a totalitarian 
island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for 
too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live 
in the freedom they so richly deserve.

Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro> cannot be erased, our 
administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin 
their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans 
who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 
2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon 
seeing a free Cuba.

Amnesty calls Castro 'progressive but deeply flawed'

Amnesty International has called Castro a “progressive but deeply flawed 
leader”. The organisation said Castro’s achievements in improving access to 
public services for millions of Cubans were tempered by a systemic repression 
of basic freedoms during his time in power. ItsAmericas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas> director, Erika Guevara-Rosa, said 
in a statement:

Access to public services such as health and education for Cubans were 
substantially improved by the Cuban revolution and for this, his leadership 
must be applauded. However, despite these achievements in areas of social 
policy, Fidel Castro’s 49-year reign was characterised by a ruthless 
suppression of freedom of expression.

The state of freedom of expression in Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba>, where activists continue to face 
arrest and harassment for speaking out against the government, is Fidel 
Castro’s darkest legacy.

Fidel Castro’s legacy is a tale of two worlds. The question now is what human 
rights will look like in a future Cuba. The lives of many depend on it.

Marco Rubio, the Florida senator whose parents were Cuban immigrants, tells 
Fox News he hopes that the Obama administration sends “no one” to Castro’s 
funeral.

In a statement, he said:

“The dictator has died, but the dictatorship has not. The future of Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> ultimately remains in the hands of the 
Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must 
stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for 
freedom and basic human rights.”

Earlier this year Rubio sought to become the Republican presidential 
candidate, but lost out to Donald Trump in the party’s primaries.

US Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary, has 
said that history will remember Castro as an “evil, murderous dictator”.

“Fidel Castro seized power promising to bring freedom and prosperity to Cuba, 
but his communist regime turned it into an impoverished island prison,” Rubio, 
who is Cuban-American,said in a statement 
<http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Press-Releases&id=0359801C-15B2-42AA-9660-159B73DE9BDF>
.

“Over six decades, millions of Cubans were forced to flee their own country, 
and those accused of opposing the regime were routinely jailed and even killed.”

We’re wrapping up our live coverage of global reaction to the death of Fidel 
Castro <https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro>. Here’s a summary of 
the main points.

 * The Cuban government has now declared nine days of national mourning and 
announcedCastro’s ashes would be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-5839641de4b0e0ad2d75d409#block-5839641de4b0e0ad2d75d409>
 in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December.

 * US president Barack Obama extended a hand of friendship to the Cuban people 
and said “history will record and judge the enormous impact” of Castro.

 * US president-elect Donald Trump described Castro as a “brutal dictator who 
oppressed his own people for nearly six decades” and hoped his passing would 
lead to freedom for Cubans. 
 * Tributes have been paid by Latin American leaders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-58394052e4b0da4920d6c59c#block-58394052e4b0da4920d6c59c>
 including Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro; Mexican president, Enrique 
Peña Nieto; and Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa. 
 * Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised Castro as the “symbol of an 
era”, and the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev alsohailed him for 
“strengthening” his island nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-583955abe4b0da4920d6c5f7#block-583955abe4b0da4920d6c5f7>
. 
 * The Nelson Mandela Foundation <https://www.nelsonmandela.org/> sent its 
condolences 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-58394e50e4b0da4920d6c5d3#block-58394e50e4b0da4920d6c5d3>
 to the people and government of Cuba, and South African President Jacob Zuma
thanked Castro for his help 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-cuban-leader-live-updates?page=with:block-583963dde4b0da4920d6c637#block-583963dde4b0da4920d6c637>
 and support in the struggle to overthrow apartheid. 
 * But celebrations broke out in Little Havana, the Miami neighbourhood home 
to many Cubans in exile in the US.

 * And Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, said 
Castro was a “tyrant and thug” and hailed his death as an opportunity to “work 
for a Cuba that is free, democratic, and prosperous”.

He left a major imprint on his country and on global politics. His

1976.

Trudeau’s son and the current Canadian PM, Justin, was in Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> earlier this month but did not meet 
with Castro. Justin Trudeau issued a statement today in which he expressed 
“deep sorrow” of learning of the death of the former Cuban president.

Fidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served his people for almost 
half a century. A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr Castro made 
significant improvements to the education and healthcare of his island nation. 
While a controversial figure, both Mr Castro’s supporters and detractors 
recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a 
deep and lasting affection forel Comandante.

I know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity 
to meet Fidel when my father passed away. It was also a real honour to meet his 
three sons and his brother, president Raúl Castro, during my recent visit to 
Cuba. On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to 
the family, friends and many, many supporters of Mr Castro. We join the people 
of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader.”

Not to be left behind, yet another senior Republican has offered his two 
cents’ worth on Castro’s passing.

House speaker Paul Ryan said much work remained to secure freedom for the 
Cuban people, adding:

Now that Fidel Castro <https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro> is

US president-elect, Donald Trump, has issued a statement about the death of 
Fidel Castro:

Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own 
people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, 
theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human 
rights.

While Cuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> remains a totalitarian 
island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for 
too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live 
in the freedom they so richly deserve.

Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/fidel-castro> cannot be erased, our 
administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin 
their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans 
who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 
2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon 
seeing a free Cuba.
 
Amnesty International has called Castro a “progressive but deeply flawed 
leader”. The organisation said Castro’s achievements in improving access to 
public services for millions of Cubans were tempered by a systemic repression 
of basic freedoms during his time in power. ItsAmericas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas> director, Erika Guevara-Rosa, said 
in a statement:

Access to public services such as health and education for Cubans were 
substantially improved by the Cuban revolution and for this, his leadership 
must be applauded. However, despite these achievements in areas of social 
policy, Fidel Castro’s 49-year reign was characterised by a ruthless 
suppression of freedom of expression.

The state of freedom of expression in Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba>, where activists continue to face 
arrest and harassment for speaking out against the government, is Fidel 
Castro’s darkest legacy.

Fidel Castro’s legacy is a tale of two worlds. The question now is what human 
rights will look like in a future Cuba. The lives of many depend on it.
