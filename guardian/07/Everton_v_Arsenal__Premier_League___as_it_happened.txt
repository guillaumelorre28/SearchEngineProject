Post-match thoughts

Ronald Koeman got the response he wanted from his players. Well, not 
immediately but he did after 30 minutes of the first half when his Everton 
players started to do everything he wanted them to. His midfield were sharp in 
the tackle, his forwards were motivated and had movement and his defence was 
resolute in the face of huge pressure late in that game. The one downside to 
that fine victory is that Jagielka is now suspended for the Merseyside derby. 
As forArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, they struggled a 
bit phjysically. Coquelin and Xhaka didn’t boss midfield as McCarthy and Gueye 
stamped their authority on the game and therefore the supply lines to Ozil and 
Sanchez were not as good as they could have been. That said, they could, and 
probably should, have scored in the final minute of stoppage time as they 
hammed on the door. That would have made me look good for my prediction too. A 
good night for the blues then, Everton and Chelsea. Thanks for your emails. 
Goodnight.

And one final email: “I thought modern football was spinning out of financial 
control,” writes Peter Oh. “Based on your readers’ scorching missives, it’s 
nothing compared to what has happened to modern firefighting.”

90+4 min: Somehow Everton don’t concede as Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> ping about four shots at goal 
that culminate in Baines clearing off the line, Lukaku racing clear and setting 
Barkley up, badly, when he could have scored. The reason? Cech was still 
galloping back. What a finish to a frantic, wonderful game …

88 min: What a din at Goodison. The fans almost fall silent though as Sanchez 
drifts a ball in towards Giroud’s head but it’s inches away and Stekelenburg 
clasps the ball gratefully.

Goal! Everton 2-1 Arsenal (Williams 86)

What a moment for Williams. Barkley plays a brilliant ball into the box, 
Williams steams in and fires a header low into the net. Goodison erupts. It’s 
his first goal for the club. What a goal. How important that could be for 
Everton’s season.

82 min: Gueye turns beautifully to send his marker the wrong way and then 
plays a delicious little one-two before trying to feed the ball through to 
Lukaku, only to see his pass dink off anArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defender and roll through to 
Cech. That was fleet-footed brilliance by the Everton midfielder.

80 min: Lukaku holds the ball up well and finds Coleman, on the gallop, on the 
right. He throws a few shapes before drifting in a left-footed cross that is 
cleared comfortably. The pace has dipped just a little. Not by much though.

78 min: What a show of faith in Dominic Calvert Lewin this is by Koeman. The 
19-year-old, signed from Sheffield United for £1.5m, makes his debut. He 
replaces Enner Valencia, who gets a rousing round of applause for his hard work 
tonight.A teenager coming on against Arsenal with the score 1-1?

at an awkward height for Iwobi, though, who can’t get his body under control as 
he prods a shot just wide.

73 min: Everton have their juices up. Lukaku wallops a shot at Monreal. Then 
Barkley whips in a wonderful ball that hits Koscielny and stops dead a couple 
of feet from the goal-line. Lukaku tries to get to it but as he gets his body 
in front of Koscielny, Iwobi pokes the ball away. Coleman plays a fine ball in 
moments later that is oh so close to finding its way through to Lukaku. This is 
much better fromEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>

69 min: Sometimes there is no finer sight in football than a big man running 
really, really fast. Lukaku was that glorious sight just then, knocking the 
ball past Gabriel and racing after it in thrilling style only to slice his shot 
into the side-netting.

67 min: Mirallas replaces Lennon, who has had a quiet second half. “On TV they 
just showed Chris Waddle announcing the game,” writes JR in Illinois. “The 
headset he is wearing is gigantic. He is almost literally all just ... 
headphones.” Maybe he is hard of hearing and needs massive cans JR. He’s no

64 min: Sanchez is released into the box, where he poses a rare old threat. He 
shimmies to the byline and drills a cross in that Williams blocks. Then Monreal 
picks up the rebound and fizzes a cross over … everyone.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> come back again. Everton are on 
the ropes … but they survive. There is a cracking pace to this game.

63 min: Valencia, who has got himself into good positions all night, whips a 
low cross in towards Lukaku only to see it bounce off Koscielny and into Cech’s 
arms. That could, very easily, have been an own goal had the ricochet been a 
bit crueler.

62 min: The game is swinging back in Everton’s favour. They’re playing with 
vim and vigour once more. Here’s Ali Robertson: “I had an uncle that was an 
underemployed fireman for 50 years at, I guess, around 35k a year. He only had 
to put out one fire, that took him about 3 hours. Was he paid almost £10,000 
per hour? Charles Antaki thinks so.”

60 min: Barkley finds space behind Coquelin and fizzes a left-footed shot just 
wide from 20 yards. Then Coquelin’s studs find Gueye’s shin and theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> midfielder would appear to be 
lucky to avoid a yellow card. He’s had a few nibbles tonight.

57 min: Some brave goalkeeping by Stekelenburg stops Ozil from nipping in to 
get a free shot on goal. Bellerin had slipped the German in on goal but the
Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> keeper rushed out and 
took a whack off Baines as he gathered the ball. I think his baubles took the 
brunt of Baines’s studs. Ooyah! Some deep breaths later and he’s up and at it 
again.
 Mesut Ozil jumps over the colliding Maarten Stekelenburg and Leighton Baines.

53 min: Suddenly Arsenal are bringing the gegen … pressing Everton into a 
corner and forcing Coleman into a hurried clearance.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> come back, Oxlade-Chamberlain 
slipping Sanchez in down the left wing. The Chilean pulls the ball back to Ozil 
who, completely unmarked, uncharacteristically curls the ball over from 12 
yards when the net was gaping and Ozil was well positioned. Well, it happens.

Everton are holding them back. But there is a feeling that if there is too much 
more of this ball-hogging fromArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, they will find a way through.

49 min: A warning sign for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>. Sanchez, Walcott and Ozil play 
three of the simplest one-touch passes you will ever see and create a crossing 
opportunity for Sanchez. One that Walcott can’t take, as he heads over. How 
Giroud would have loved that.

the favour. But Baines stops Bellerin in his tracks andEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> clear. And now Charles Antaki 
brings the maths: “Erm, here goes: £400,000 a week, say for one game, played 
over 90 minutes, £400,000 / 90 …. (wrestles with pen and paper, gives up, uses 
trusty computer calculator, though not confidently)… yes, £4,400 a minute. Ah 
no, that’s with rounding.. £4,444! My final offer.”

Right, well Everton looked a completely different team when Koeman flared his 
nostrils and his team responded and pressed Arsenal. That said, they will need 
to create a great deal of chances to win this game as they feel Arsenal might 
only need three to score one or two goals. Everton made need 10. Keep your eye 
on tempers spiralling out of control in this second half too. McCarthy needs to 
keep his lid under control. Everton can’t afford a sending off. And how is this 
newArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> spine? Can it 
withstand a furious second half in the stormy north-west? A place that has done 
for previous title challenges? We’ll see.

Half-time: Everton 1-1 Arsenal

That was great. And my prediction of 2-2 is still alive.

half could carry on. They look affronted as the half-time whistle goes. Then 
there is a load of pushing and shoving between the two teams as they try to get 
down the tunnel. This has been highly entertaining.

Goal! Everton 1-1 Arsenal (Coleman 44)

And there’s that missing quality. Gueye finds Baines out on the left. He sends 
Walcott for a copy of the Echo with a little swivel of the hips, and then whips 
in a beautiful ball with his right foot for Coleman to glance into the far 
corner. A deserved equaliser.Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> had already found their mojo, 
they just needed that moment of quality.

42 min: There’s a pulsating tempo in this game now. Barkley shows lovely feet 
to skip inside Bellerin and then wallops a crossfield pass over to Lukaku. He 
controls the ball and then slows play down unnecessarily. The result is a cross 
into the box that is cleared by Koscielny. Then McCarthy clatters into Coquelin 
and is booked for his trouble.

Williams atones for error as Everton come from behind to sink Arsenal
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/13/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report> 
Ronald Koeman got the response he wanted from his players. Well, not 
immediately but he did after 30 minutes of the first half when his Everton 
players started to do everything he wanted them to. His midfield were sharp in 
the tackle, his forwards were motivated and had movement and his defence was 
resolute in the face of huge pressure late in that game. The one downside to 
that fine victory is that Jagielka is now suspended for the Merseyside derby. 
As forArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, they struggled a 
bit phjysically. Coquelin and Xhaka didn’t boss midfield as McCarthy and Gueye 
stamped their authority on the game and therefore the supply lines to Ozil and 
Sanchez were not as good as they could have been. That said, they could, and 
probably should, have scored in the final minute of stoppage time as they 
hammed on the door. That would have made me look good for my prediction too. A 
good night for the blues then, Everton and Chelsea. Thanks for your emails. 
Goodnight.

And one final email: “I thought modern football was spinning out of financial 
control,” writes Peter Oh. “Based on your readers’ scorching missives, it’s 
nothing compared to what has happened to modern firefighting.”

Take a deep breath. It’s over. 
 
90+4 min: Somehow Everton don’t concede as Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> ping about four shots at goal 
that culminate in Baines clearing off the line, Lukaku racing clear and setting 
Barkley up, badly, when he could have scored. The reason? Cech was still 
galloping back. What a finish to a frantic, wonderful game …

90+3 min: The corner is cleared and Jagielka is sent off for a second yellow 
card as he pulls back Perez.

90+2 min: Xhaka floats a ball towards Monreal at the back post. Coleman leaps 
and heads clear for a corner. Cech’s up for this one.
 
90 min: There’ll be four minutes added time. Barkley clatters a shot at Cech 
when all he had to do was square the ball to Mirallas for a tap-in.Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> win a corner and take it short 
in the hope they can waste time. They do keep possession. Can they see this out?
 
89 min: McCarthy is replaced by Funes Mori. He’s won the midfield battle with 
Xhaka. His furious tackling at the end of the first half helped swing this game 
the way ofEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> too.
 
88 min: What a din at Goodison. The fans almost fall silent though as Sanchez 
drifts a ball in towards Giroud’s head but it’s inches away and Stekelenburg 
clasps the ball gratefully.
 
87 min: Arsenal’s marking was poor there but Williams and Everton won’t give a 
flying one. Maybe he was Xhaka’s man. Maybe he wasn’t. Could Koeman salvage 
another season with a win againstArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>.
 
What a moment for Williams. Barkley plays a brilliant ball into the box, 
Williams steams in and fires a header low into the net. Goodison erupts. It’s 
his first goal for the club. What a goal. How important that could be for 
Everton’s season.

84 min: Lukaku is fouled by Koscielny (they’ve had a fine battle tonight). 
Baines whips the free-kick into the box where a header is pinged down into an
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> player. Moments later 
Jagielka forces a fine stop from Cech. Corner …
 
82 min: Gueye turns beautifully to send his marker the wrong way and then 
plays a delicious little one-two before trying to feed the ball through to 
Lukaku, only to see his pass dink off anArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> defender and roll through to 
Cech. That was fleet-footed brilliance by the Everton midfielder.
 
80 min: Lukaku holds the ball up well and finds Coleman, on the gallop, on the 
right. He throws a few shapes before drifting in a left-footed cross that is 
cleared comfortably. The pace has dipped just a little. Not by much though.
 
78 min: What a show of faith in Dominic Calvert Lewin this is by Koeman. The 
19-year-old, signed from Sheffield United for £1.5m, makes his debut. He 
replaces Enner Valencia, who gets a rousing round of applause for his hard work 
tonight.A teenager coming on against Arsenal with the score 1-1? 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4YjqZqyvsY> Hmmm. 
 
77 min: Allen Matthew Turner writes: “In response to Ali Robertson, if your 
uncle was making £35,000 a year, only put out one fire in 50 years and it took 
him three hours then he was actually making £583,333.33 per hour. Also, he 
wasn’t a fireman.”
 
75 min: Sanchez gets free in the inside-left channel again. His ball inside is 
at an awkward height for Iwobi, though, who can’t get his body under control as 
he prods a shot just wide.

73 min: Everton have their juices up. Lukaku wallops a shot at Monreal. Then 
Barkley whips in a wonderful ball that hits Koscielny and stops dead a couple 
of feet from the goal-line. Lukaku tries to get to it but as he gets his body 
in front of Koscielny, Iwobi pokes the ball away. Coleman plays a fine ball in 
moments later that is oh so close to finding its way through to Lukaku. This is 
much better fromEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>
 
70 min: Oxlade Chamberlain is off and Iwobi is on for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. And Walcott too. He’s replaced 
by Giroud.
 
69 min: Sometimes there is no finer sight in football than a big man running 
really, really fast. Lukaku was that glorious sight just then, knocking the 
ball past Gabriel and racing after it in thrilling style only to slice his shot 
into the side-netting.
 
67 min: Mirallas replaces Lennon, who has had a quiet second half. “On TV they 
just showed Chris Waddle announcing the game,” writes JR in Illinois. “The 
headset he is wearing is gigantic. He is almost literally all just ... 
headphones.” Maybe he is hard of hearing and needs massive cans JR. He’s no 
spring chicken these days.
 
64 min: Sanchez is released into the box, where he poses a rare old threat. He 
shimmies to the byline and drills a cross in that Williams blocks. Then Monreal 
picks up the rebound and fizzes a cross over … everyone.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> come back again. Everton are on 
the ropes … but they survive. There is a cracking pace to this game.
 
63 min: Valencia, who has got himself into good positions all night, whips a 
low cross in towards Lukaku only to see it bounce off Koscielny and into Cech’s 
arms. That could, very easily, have been an own goal had the ricochet been a 
bit crueler.
 
62 min: The game is swinging back in Everton’s favour. They’re playing with 
vim and vigour once more. Here’s Ali Robertson: “I had an uncle that was an 
underemployed fireman for 50 years at, I guess, around 35k a year. He only had 
to put out one fire, that took him about 3 hours. Was he paid almost £10,000 
per hour? Charles Antaki thinks so.”
 
60 min: Barkley finds space behind Coquelin and fizzes a left-footed shot just 
wide from 20 yards. Then Coquelin’s studs find Gueye’s shin and theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> midfielder would appear to be 
lucky to avoid a yellow card. He’s had a few nibbles tonight.
 
57 min: Some brave goalkeeping by Stekelenburg stops Ozil from nipping in to 
get a free shot on goal. Bellerin had slipped the German in on goal but the
Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> keeper rushed out and 
took a whack off Baines as he gathered the ball. I think his baubles took the 
brunt of Baines’s studs. Ooyah! Some deep breaths later and he’s up and at it 
again.

55 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> break and 
Baines is tripped by Coquelin 20 yards from goal. Barkley stands over it … but 
his curled effort on goal is blocked by the wall.

53 min: Suddenly Arsenal are bringing the gegen … pressing Everton into a 
corner and forcing Coleman into a hurried clearance.Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> come back, Oxlade-Chamberlain 
slipping Sanchez in down the left wing. The Chilean pulls the ball back to Ozil 
who, completely unmarked, uncharacteristically curls the ball over from 12 
yards when the net was gaping and Ozil was well positioned. Well, it happens.
 
52 min: Giroud and Iwobi are warming up for Arsenal. Here’s a lovely interview 
with theArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> youngster.

room’

50 min: Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink. Arsenal are dominating possession but 
Everton are holding them back. But there is a feeling that if there is too much 
more of this ball-hogging fromArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, they will find a way through.
 
49 min: A warning sign for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>. Sanchez, Walcott and Ozil play 
three of the simplest one-touch passes you will ever see and create a crossing 
opportunity for Sanchez. One that Walcott can’t take, as he heads over. How 
Giroud would have loved that.
 
47 min: Bellerin dinks a lovely little ball forwards to Coquelin, who returns 
the favour. But Baines stops Bellerin in his tracks andEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> clear. And now Charles Antaki 
brings the maths: “Erm, here goes: £400,000 a week, say for one game, played 
over 90 minutes, £400,000 / 90 …. (wrestles with pen and paper, gives up, uses 
trusty computer calculator, though not confidently)… yes, £4,400 a minute. Ah 
no, that’s with rounding.. £4,444! My final offer.”
 
45 min: Peep! And off we go again. Lukaku, not a man known for his pressing, 
puts Cech under pressure and forces him to wallop the ball clear. That’s a sign 
thatEverton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> will begin where 
they left off.
 
Right, well Everton looked a completely different team when Koeman flared his 
nostrils and his team responded and pressed Arsenal. That said, they will need 
to create a great deal of chances to win this game as they feel Arsenal might 
only need three to score one or two goals. Everton made need 10. Keep your eye 
on tempers spiralling out of control in this second half too. McCarthy needs to 
keep his lid under control. Everton can’t afford a sending off. And how is this 
newArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> spine? Can it 
withstand a furious second half in the stormy north-west? A place that has done 
for previous title challenges? We’ll see.
 
An email: “Can we have the maths of Charles Antaki regarding Sanchez?” demands 
Yoann Lechenault. “Because I think he didn’t switch off just his moral 
scruples.”
 
That was great. And my prediction of 2-2 is still alive. 
 
45 min: Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> must wish the 
half could carry on. They look affronted as the half-time whistle goes. Then 
there is a load of pushing and shoving between the two teams as they try to get 
down the tunnel. This has been highly entertaining.

And there’s that missing quality. Gueye finds Baines out on the left. He sends 
Walcott for a copy of the Echo with a little swivel of the hips, and then whips 
in a beautiful ball with his right foot for Coleman to glance into the far 
corner. A deserved equaliser.Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> had already found their mojo, 
they just needed that moment of quality.

42 min: There’s a pulsating tempo in this game now. Barkley shows lovely feet 
to skip inside Bellerin and then wallops a crossfield pass over to Lukaku. He 
controls the ball and then slows play down unnecessarily. The result is a cross 
into the box that is cleared by Koscielny. Then McCarthy clatters into Coquelin 
and is booked for his trouble.
