It’s coming. The date is less than a fortnight away. 20 January is a day for 
the history books – the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United 
States. How to mark it? A day in bed with a bottle of tequila and some 
seriously depressing country music sounds about right – and in a sense that is 
what some of America’s most admired artistsare proposing 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/arts/design/artists-and-critics-call-for-culture-strike-on-inauguration-day.html?_r=1>
.

I am not saying Cindy Sherman, Julie Mehretu, Richard Serra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/serra>, Joan Jonas and 130-odd other 
US art giants will be getting drunk under the duvet, but they don’t propose to 
do any work that day. They also urge museums and other cultural institutions to 
lock up and go home for the day, all of it a “J20 art strike” in protest 
against “the normalisation of Trumpism”.

Emotionally, I completely sympathise. Why leave it at one day? A four-year 
strike in which we all simply give up everything – wherever we happen to be on 
the planet – for the duration of Trump’s term as president would feel entirely 
justified. The accession of this manifestly unqualified man to the most 
powerful office in the world, with one finger on the nuclear button while he 
types out tweets with another, makes everything seem futile.

Yet an art strike is just about the least effective idea for resisting Trump 
that I have heard. The American left is in for a long, wretched period of 
irrelevance if this is its idea of striking back. I admire some of these artists
greatly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/13/richard-serra-review-nj-2-gagosian-britannia-street-london>
, but the notion that museums will help anything by closing their doors, or 
students will scare middle America into its senses by cutting art classes, 
tastes not of real hard-fought politics but shallow radical posturing by some 
very well-heeled and comfortable members of a cultural elite. These eminent 
artists come across as people who are used to being listened to without having 
to try. Worse, there is something nostalgic about the petition, as of this were 
the 1960s all over again. Some hope.

Such a protest can only help the participants feel good about themselves. It 
is at best a way of saying “not in my name”, and cannot conceivably do anything 
to curb Trump or ensure his electoral defeat next time around. Let’s face it: 
art and serious culture are completely marginal to American life. Trump’s 
victory proves that. Closing museums is not likely to have any impact on those 
who support him. With all due respect, they might be affected a lot more if 
reality television shows went on strike.

Meryl Streep attacks Donald Trump in Golden Globes speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/jan/09/meryl-streep-donald-trump-golden-globes-defends-journalism-video>
From their safe citadel of artworld fame, these venerated creators appear to 
be inviting museum curators and art teachers to take risks with their 
livelihoods. An art strike at this time could be a personal risk for individual 
members of staff . It could be unnecessarily provocative for institutions 
themselves to declare themselves as political enemies of the new 
administration. That’s not to say people should never take such risks when it 
is the right thing to do, just that it is a little bit arrogant to ask this of 
others when you yourself risk nothing – and anyone familiar with incomes in the 
upper reaches of the art world knows the likes of Sherman and Serra really do 
risk nothing by taking a day off.

The cultural world is right to be horrified by Trump, but what can it really 
do right now? Nothing. Meryl Streep’s comments at the Golden Globeswere eloquent
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/08/meryl-streep-golden-globes-speech-donald-trump>
 – and she rightly put herself on the line, instead of others – yet nearly as 
pointless as an art strike.

There is something inadequate in the way the liberal world characterises 
Trump. A woman-hating racist representing the US would be bad enough, but there 
are much more unprecedented and seriously frightening aspects to the man: his 
volatility, open dishonesty and signs that he has no respect for or 
understanding of democracy itself, not to mention his strange relationship with 
that authoritarian enemy of western freedoms, Vladimir Putin.

The real reason art strikes and fine words at the Golden Globes are futile is 
that they cannot do justice to the danger the world is in. Liberals, this is 
not an opportunity for radical grandstanding. History has chosen our generation 
to be tested. Save your strength – you will need it.
