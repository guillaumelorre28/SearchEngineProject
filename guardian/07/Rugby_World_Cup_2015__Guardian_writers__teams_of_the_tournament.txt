New Zealand supply more than half the XV even without Ben Smith, Julian Savea, 
Kieran Read and Jerome Kaino. That is tough on Smith but Japan’s technical 
excellence had to be acknowledged. It is tough, too, on Australia’s inside 
centre Matt Giteau. Both Leone Nakarawa and Taulupe Faletau would help make a 
top-quality bench.Have your say on our readers’ poll

Juan Imhoff switches wing because Santiago Cordero had a stinker in 
Argentina’s semi-final against Australia. Ben Smith just pips Ayumu Goromaru 
and Gareth Davies just squeezes in at scrum-half – or else there wouldn’t have 
been a European player in the team.

A braver man might have gone for Tonga’s Telusa Veainu or Canada’s DTH van der 
Merwe for Santiago Cordero, if only to reflect the role of second-tier nations 
in making a top-notch seven weeks.

A strong All Blacks and Wallabies bias, but how could there not be? Over the 
course of the tournament they were the two best teams. But Argentina and Japan, 
who also lit up the tournament, demand representation too.

There are two ways of doing this – pick the best team, which would basically 
be New Zealand with a few others, or a team that tells the story of the 
tournament. This team tries to do the latter.

Would have been a different team after the pool stage, but New Zealand timed 
their run perfectly. No Six Nations players but Mark Bennett, Greig Laidlaw, 
Robbie Henshaw, Sean O’Brien, Anthony Watson, Gareth Davies, Sam Warburton and 
Louis Picamoles all left an imprint on the tournament.
