Rory McIlroy will take on Patrick Reed in an intriguing first singles match 
after the Europe captain, Darren Clarke, opted to put his best players out 
first on Sunday. Clarke had little option after seeing his side lose three of 
the second day’s fourball matches at Hazeltine to trail by three points heading 
into the 12 singles.

But the holders could at least take encouragement from having overturned a 
four-point deficit at Medinah in 2012 as they sought to secure an unprecedented 
fourth straight victory.

McIlroy – who called for a fan to be ejected after suffering verbal abuse – 
was in superb form on Saturday in securing a third straight win alongside the 
rookie Thomas Pieters. However, Reed arguably played even better with six 
birdies and an eagle in the final fourballs match alongside Jordan Spieth.

Open champion Henrik Stenson will go out second against Spieth, with wildcard 
Pieters taking on JB Holmes in match three. Rafa Cabrera Bello and Spain’s 
Sergio García face Jimmy Walker and Phil Mickelson respectively, with rookies 
Andy Sullivan, Chris Wood, Danny Willett and Matt Fitzpatrick filling four of 
the last five matches.

Fitzpatrick is in the last match against two-time major winner Zach Johnson, 
but Europe faced an uphill task to get the contest that far.
