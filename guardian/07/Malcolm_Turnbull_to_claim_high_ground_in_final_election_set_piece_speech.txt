After a bitter and often negative eight-week campaign Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> will try to 
consolidate his election pitch and return to the claim that he’s a leader above 
partisan politics in a final set piece speech on Thursday.

According to speech notes, Turnbull will tell the National Press Club about 
the sentiment he has “picked up from my visits to so many electorates right 
across the country.”

“I believe they want our parliament to offload the ideology, to end the 
juvenile theatrics and gotcha moments, to drop the personality politics. They 
want our focus to be on issues that matter to them – and an end to division for 
division’s sake,” he will say. “Australians want the government they elect to 
get on with the job of ensuring we have a strong economy.”

The “different style of leadership” message is similar to the one Turnbull 
used when he challenged Tony Abbott.

Coalition spends up big in its marginal seats and small in Labor electorates

“We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and 
opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities,” he 
said last September when he launched his leadership bid. “A style of leadership 
that respects the people’s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and 
then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case 
for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of 
the Australian people.”

But Turnbull’s popularity plummeted from initial net satisfaction ratings of 
38% to well into negative territory, as voters expressed disappointment at his 
failure to change many Abbott-era policies.

And, like Labor, the Coalition has run several negative messages and attack 
ads during the election, including overLabor’s asylum policy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/26/malcolm-turnbull-warns-marginal-seat-voters-against-supporting-independents>
 and making the claim that a Labor government reliant on votes from Greens and 
Independents would be “chaotic” and that the Labor party had been “infiltrated” 
by Greens activists.

Turnbull is ending the campaign quietly confident and ahead in the polls and 
with a blitz of radio interviews targeting marginal seats. He has been 
campaigning in the final days in New South Wales and western Sydney and with 
the traditional National Press Club speech.

The Coalition has stuck to its jobs and growth message throughout the 
campaign, based on the $48bn in company tax cuts announced in its May budget. 
There have been big few spending announcements and few major hiccups, although 
in the final week Turnbull has been forced to address uncertainties around his 
policy on marriage equality – with legal change vehemently opposed by many
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> conservatives.

Turnbull confirmed Coalition MPs would have a free vote in the parliament, 
even if the Australian people carried the marriage equality plebiscite. But 
several MPs said they would vote in accord with the plebiscite results in their 
electorate, rather than the national vote, and both the treasurer, Scott 
Morrison, and the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, said only that they 
would “respect” the result. They would not say they would vote for marriage 
equality.

Turnbull insisted that if the plebiscite passed, the parliament would change 
the law.

“Few things in politics are certain but one thing that I would say is an 
absolute certainty is that if the plebiscite is passed or carried by the 
Australian people, same-sex marriage will be legislated for by the Australian 
parliament,” he said.

Bill Shorten is ending his campaign in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.
