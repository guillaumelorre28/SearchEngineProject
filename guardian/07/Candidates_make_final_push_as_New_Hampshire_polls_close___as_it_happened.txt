Lee Glendinning

Who are you voting for?

Alison Croughwell, 28, from Salem, a farmer and student

Voted for: Bernie Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>

“I voted for Bernie - I think he’d do a wonderful job. It’s nice to know he 
has been a leader but he’s also a person like us - he’s not on the same 
pedestal as other candidates are.”

Do we need a revolution? “Yes, I think we have forgotten where we came from 
and Bernie reminds us of that. I think people my age can relate to Bernie. It’s 
the first time at my school where I have heard a lot of kids talking about 
wanting to vote, and that made me excited.”

Jennifer McKenzie, 61, of Salem 

“I voted for Hillary, I was undecided coming in but I thought she was probably 
the best candidate. I was really torn as there are not many promising 
candidates. But I think with the knowledge that she has Hillary can really do 
something. I was choosing between Hillary and Sanders but I wanted a woman. 
It’s time for a woman.”
 Jennifer McKenzie. Photograph: Lee Glendinning for the Guardian 
Tom Parsons, 68, a retired veteran from Salem 

“I voted for Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, I 
think he’ll bring the country back in the right direction and he’s pro-veteran. 
I like three or four more of the current Republican field but I decided on 
Trump after the first debate. We’ve had eight years of a lousy leader and we 
really need a shake-up.”

Jonathan Freedland

Who are you voting for?

Gail Schuman, a 68-year-old widow from Manchester, New Hampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire>

Voted for: Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> (decided “after the last 
debate”)

“I don’t think she and Bernie are as far apart as they pretend to be. Too bad 
they’re not running together, as running mates ... I don’t think they [younger 
voters] grasp the importance of experience. And she has so much experience.”
 Gail Schuman. Photograph: Jonathan Freedland for the Guardian 
Curtis Page, a 44-year-old engineer from Manchester

Voted for: Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
(decided “a long time ago”)

Does America need a revolution? Yes. “I want no established politicians. I 
want a complete outsider. I like what he says about immigration.”

It’s interesting how many of these voters react positively to the idea America 
needs a “revolution” – whether they support Sanders, Clinton, Trump, Cruz ...

Perhaps Sanders’s use of that word - much-derided by TV pundits when he first 
sprang it on them - was not such a big risk after all.

Matt Sullivan

Who are you voting for?

Jim DiCarlo, a teacher from Exeter

Voted for: Bernie Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>

Decided: “about a week ago”

Excited about a President Sanders on a scale of one to 10: 7

Excited about a President Clinton: 7 

Does American need a revolution? “No, I think it’s more that I like Hillary 
less than I like Senator Sanders. There’s something about her I just don’t 
like. I know I ought to, but you don’t always get the whole story from her. 
Sure, I worry that Bernie can’t get elected against one of the Republicans in 
November, but I’ll vote for anybody that isn’t one of them. I wish there was a 
third choice.”
 Jim DiCarlo Photograph: Matt Sullivan for the Guardian 
Kathleen, 52, from Exeter

Voted for: Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>. She 
decided late yesterday

Excited about Cruz, on a scale 1-10: 7

Rest of field: “crazy”

Does American need a revolution? “I did vote for him for a revolution, yes. I 
believe in his views and he showed this week that they’re consistent.”

Who are you voting for?

Carol Brewitt, of Exeter, was “very ticked off” because a registration snafu 
had prevented her from casting a vote for her preferred candidate - “Hillary, 
of course.”

“I love to travel, I love the world,” she said. “[Clinton is] very 
professional and she’ll keep the country right in the eyes of the world ... 
She’s a substantial woman with a brain and she can handle all of that.”

Diane Wright, 72, of Exeter decided to support Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> when she walked into the 
polling station at the Tuck Learning Campus gym in Exeter. “I love Hillary and 
I always wanted a woman president,” Wright said. “But I don’t really trust her. 
She reminds me too much of Bill.”

Wright took an online questionnaire to match her views to the best candidate, 
and Sanders came out on top. “He seems to care about the people,” Wright said.

Bonnie Maney, a senior citizen of Exeter, said she had switched from Clinton 
to Sanders two weeks ago, when her daughter, who is in her early 30s, finally 
convinced her.

“Every time I turned around, [my daughter] had another argument” for Sanders, 
Maney said. “She doesn’t know if she can even afford a house.” Maney said she 
was impressed when she saw Clinton speak last November, but her daughter 
“pretty much talked me out of it”.

Richard Pang, also of Exeter, voted for Jeb Bush. He gave Trump a mark of zero 
out of 10. “He talks a lot of nonsense.” Pang had supported Marco Rubio until 
the last debate, on Saturday, when he thought Rubio stumbled - and Bush 
effectively attacked Trump. “He really drew the blood ofDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>,” Pang said of Bush.

Who are you voting for?

Chris Comfort, 50, from Rochester, voted for Trump this morning. 

“I really believe he can make America great again,” said Comfort, a retired 
pharmacist. “I really believe he’s not owned by anyone and that’s a big thing 
in politics today.”

Comfort said he also liked Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>.

“He is like Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in 
the fact that he’s a man of principle. He doesn’t waver,” he said. “Mr Sanders 
has always been for what he believes in and I respect that.”


Comfort was relaxing in Mel Flanagan’s Irish pub and restaurant. I was in 
there eating a beef stew.


“If you want to see the value of a man look at his children,” Comfort said of 
Trump. Comfort is quite taken with Ivanka Trump in particular. He described her 
as “the American Diana”, referring to the deceased ex-wife of Prince Charles. 
“She’s a class act.”

Jeb Lund

Here’s what we know at this point, writes Jeb Lund: nothing. Here’s what 
everyone else knows: nothing.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> needs to 
win among people to win New Hampshire, but if Bernie Sanders does better among 
people he will prevail, especially considering his lead among people. This 
could really shape our understanding of how Clinton or Sanders do amongst 
people.

Trump leads the Republican pack, but his voters still might not be real 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-media-stop-freaking-out-about-donald-trumps-polls/>
, which could be a problem for him, because that could mean that fewer people 
will vote for him than another person. That other person? He could be Ted Cruz, 
Marco Rubio, John Kasich or Jeb Bush. It’s neck and neck between what could 
happen and another thing that could happen.

Not knowing anything isn’t going to stop 24-hour news from packing the day 
with the on-air nutritive equivalent of packing peanuts. MSNBC is, by far, the 
least intolerable of the big three cable networks, and even watching it for a 
few hours is enough to send you to an animal shelter full of rabies in a 
hamburger suit.

John Heilemann and Mark Halperin are there to ad lib the sequel to their 
seminal book, Double Change: Game Down. You could turn the TV off and simulate 
the process of listening to them by saying: “When it’s warm out, you don’t need 
to wear a sweater,” then shoving a $5 bill down a whirring garbage disposal. If 
Michael Bloomberg decides to run for president, his campaign should be dragged 
into the street and shot merely for the fact that he pays this pair six 
figures, at a minimum. Rich people know how to fix things!

Helming this cruise off the edge of the world are chair-warmer Mika Brzezinski 
andsometime legal representative of an abortion-doctor murderer Joe Scarborough 
<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/report-before-congressional-run-scarborough-represented-killer-of-abortion-doctor>
, potentially the most luminous mind to ever talk loudly on the streets of 
Mossy Head, Florida. That he was never locked in a Port-O-Let at the Boggy 
Bayou Mullet Festival and dragged into a barren stretch of scrub oak in 1994 
tarnishes Okaloosa County’s legacy of being a place of good folk.

For depth, they’re periodically throwing it to Mike Barnicle, whose every good 
line should send you to Google just to make sure Mike Royko didn’t say it 
first. This is programming that makes you yearn for aJublia ad 
<http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7uh9/jublia-fight-it-dont-hide-it> just to see a more 
human toenail fungus.

Periodically leavening the broadcast are appearances by campaign strategists. 
Their candidates are doing very well! Their candidates’ opponents are going to 
be in trouble, especially if they don’t do well among people, unlike the 
candidates who are polling well among people. This outcome is going to surprise 
you, unless it doesn’t, which you shouldn’t have counted out, unless you should 
have expected it.

This klatsch of well-fed vampires is being filmed in front of a restaurant of 
New Hampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire> residents, in 
case you were wondering where the real meat is. If you held a mirror up to it, 
the only people you’d see would be diners sitting behind a stack of empty, 
well-lit chairs.

In the wake of the last Republican presidential debate, Marco Rubio has found 
himself combating an emerging narrative that he is too scripted - if not 
incapable of straying from talking points. But the Florida senator on Tuesday 
showed a more personal side when approached by aNew Hampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire> voter plagued by a family 
history of cancer.

It was meant to be a simple drive-by for Rubio, who visited multiple polling 
centers here as New Hampshire residents cast their votes for the 
first-in-the-nation primary. Standing outside a middle school, Rubio seamlessly 
worked his way through a group of volunteers and voters lined up on the 
sidewalk - shaking their hands and posing for pictures.

It was there that Stephanie Tsepas, a registered independent of Derry, awaited 
an opportunity to press the senator on cancer research.

Tsepas had met Rubio just a few nights earlier at a rally he held in the same 
school, but he was ushered away at the time without being able to offer her a 
response in full

Reintroducing herself, Tsepas spoke of how her husband had been diagnosed with 
colon cancer as a teenager and now her 12-year-old son was found to have a 
precursor of the same disease.

Rubio, to her surprise, remembered their previous encounter and this time 
engaged in a detailed - and deeply personal - conversation about cancer and its 
toll on society.

“My dad had lung cancer,” Rubio said. “He was 84. He smoked his whole life. It 
took him pretty quickly.”

There were also two aunts who died of pancreatic cancer, he added, and the 
diagnosis of his nephew with leukemia.

“He’s done well from it, but it’s tough,” Rubio said of his nephew, now 9 
years old. “Every year it’s something different. It’s not just cancer, it’s all 
the stuff that comes with it. It’s the infections, it’s the chemo, and it’s 
tough to see in a little boy.”

The tale of Rubio’s father is a staple on the campaign trail - the senator has 
long captivated crowds with the inspirational tale of his immigrant parents, 
who worked as a bartender and a maid to leave their children better off. But he 
has seldom opened up about his father’s passing just two months before Rubio 
was elected to the US Senate in 2010.

Rubio also discussed with Tsepas his support for more federal funding toward 
cancer research. Citing the initiative Barack Obama announced in last month’s 
State of the Union, to be led by vice president Joe Biden, who lost his son 
Beau to cancer last year, Rubio said he would favor boosting investment in 
developing and expanding targeted cancer therapies.

He also showed interest in the specific problems Tsepas was facing, ranging 
from where her son would be treated to whether a procedure to remove the boy’s 
colon as a preventive measure would be covered by their insurance.

“I’m sorry for what you’re facing,” Rubio said, placing his arm on her 
shoulder as he wrapped up the conversation.

Tsepas said she walked away more impressed than she had been before. When 
attending Rubio’s rally on Friday, she said, “I felt like I was in one of his 
commercials.”

“But today, I loved the honesty. It was definitely more personal for him,” 
Tsepas added.

Although heading into the polls still undecided, she ultimately chose not to 
vote for Rubio moments later. It was not that the senator wasn’t personable, 
she said, adding that it was a tough decision.

In the end, Tsepas simply concluded she was seeking a candidate with more 
experience.

“I just don’t think now is his time,” she said. “Maybe in four years.”

Age: 74

Party: Republican

Profession: Retired

From: Exeter, New Hampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire>

Voting for: Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>

Made up his mind: This morning.

Support for Trump, 1-10: 10

“I like Trump’s positions. I was going to vote for Carson on principles, and 
because he’s more intellectual than Trump, but really I would vote for any of 
the Republican field except Bush. I’m a solid conservative, and I really like 
Trump.”

“There doesn’t need to be a revolution in poltics, but there needs to be a 
revolution in Washington DC and for the distribution of power to come back to 
the states.”

pedestal as other candidates are.”

Do we need a revolution? “Yes, I think we have forgotten where we came from 
and Bernie reminds us of that. I think people my age can relate to Bernie. It’s 
the first time at my school where I have heard a lot of kids talking about 
wanting to vote, and that made me excited.”

“I voted for Hillary, I was undecided coming in but I thought she was probably 
the best candidate. I was really torn as there are not many promising 
candidates. But I think with the knowledge that she has Hillary can really do 
something. I was choosing between Hillary and Sanders but I wanted a woman. 
It’s time for a woman.”

Tom Parsons, 68, a retired veteran from Salem 

“I voted for Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, I 
think he’ll bring the country back in the right direction and he’s pro-veteran. 
I like three or four more of the current Republican field but I decided on 
Trump after the first debate. We’ve had eight years of a lousy leader and we 
really need a shake-up.”

Who are you voting for?

Gail Schuman, a 68-year-old widow from Manchester, New Hampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire>

Voted for: Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> (decided “after the last 
debate”)

“I don’t think she and Bernie are as far apart as they pretend to be. Too bad 
they’re not running together, as running mates ... I don’t think they [younger 
voters] grasp the importance of experience. And she has so much experience.”

Curtis Page, a 44-year-old engineer from Manchester

Voted for: Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
(decided “a long time ago”)

Does America need a revolution? Yes. “I want no established politicians. I 
want a complete outsider. I like what he says about immigration.”

It’s interesting how many of these voters react positively to the idea America 
needs a “revolution” – whether they support Sanders, Clinton, Trump, Cruz ...

Perhaps Sanders’s use of that word - much-derided by TV pundits when he first 
sprang it on them - was not such a big risk after all.

Jim DiCarlo, a teacher from Exeter

Voted for: Bernie Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>

Decided: “about a week ago”

Excited about a President Sanders on a scale of one to 10: 7

Excited about a President Clinton: 7 

Does American need a revolution? “No, I think it’s more that I like Hillary 
less than I like Senator Sanders. There’s something about her I just don’t 
like. I know I ought to, but you don’t always get the whole story from her. 
Sure, I worry that Bernie can’t get elected against one of the Republicans in 
November, but I’ll vote for anybody that isn’t one of them. I wish there was a 
third choice.”

Kathleen, 52, from Exeter

Voted for: Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>. She 
decided late yesterday

Excited about Cruz, on a scale 1-10: 7

Rest of field: “crazy”

Does American need a revolution? “I did vote for him for a revolution, yes. I 
believe in his views and he showed this week that they’re consistent.”

Carol Brewitt, of Exeter, was “very ticked off” because a registration snafu 
had prevented her from casting a vote for her preferred candidate - “Hillary, 
of course.”

“I love to travel, I love the world,” she said. “[Clinton is] very 
professional and she’ll keep the country right in the eyes of the world ... 
She’s a substantial woman with a brain and she can handle all of that.”

Diane Wright, 72, of Exeter decided to support Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> when she walked into the 
polling station at the Tuck Learning Campus gym in Exeter. “I love Hillary and 
I always wanted a woman president,” Wright said. “But I don’t really trust her. 
She reminds me too much of Bill.”

Wright took an online questionnaire to match her views to the best candidate, 
and Sanders came out on top. “He seems to care about the people,” Wright said.

Bonnie Maney, a senior citizen of Exeter, said she had switched from Clinton 
to Sanders two weeks ago, when her daughter, who is in her early 30s, finally 
convinced her.

“Every time I turned around, [my daughter] had another argument” for Sanders, 
Maney said. “She doesn’t know if she can even afford a house.” Maney said she 
was impressed when she saw Clinton speak last November, but her daughter 
“pretty much talked me out of it”.

Richard Pang, also of Exeter, voted for Jeb Bush. He gave Trump a mark of zero 
out of 10. “He talks a lot of nonsense.” Pang had supported Marco Rubio until 
the last debate, on Saturday, when he thought Rubio stumbled - and Bush 
effectively attacked Trump. “He really drew the blood ofDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>,” Pang said of Bush.

Who are you voting for?

Chris Comfort, 50, from Rochester, voted for Trump this morning. 

“I really believe he can make America great again,” said Comfort, a retired 
pharmacist. “I really believe he’s not owned by anyone and that’s a big thing 
in politics today.”

Comfort said he also liked Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>.

“He is like Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in 
the fact that he’s a man of principle. He doesn’t waver,” he said. “Mr Sanders 
has always been for what he believes in and I respect that.”


Comfort was relaxing in Mel Flanagan’s Irish pub and restaurant. I was in 
there eating a beef stew.


“If you want to see the value of a man look at his children,” Comfort said of 
Trump. Comfort is quite taken with Ivanka Trump in particular. He described her 
as “the American Diana”, referring to the deceased ex-wife of Prince Charles. 
“She’s a class act.”

Here’s what we know at this point, writes Jeb Lund: nothing. Here’s what 
everyone else knows: nothing.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> needs to 
win among people to win New Hampshire, but if Bernie Sanders does better among 
people he will prevail, especially considering his lead among people. This 
could really shape our understanding of how Clinton or Sanders do amongst 
people.

Trump leads the Republican pack, but his voters still might not be real 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-media-stop-freaking-out-about-donald-trumps-polls/>
, which could be a problem for him, because that could mean that fewer people 
will vote for him than another person. That other person? He could be Ted Cruz, 
Marco Rubio, John Kasich or Jeb Bush. It’s neck and neck between what could 
happen and another thing that could happen.

Not knowing anything isn’t going to stop 24-hour news from packing the day 
with the on-air nutritive equivalent of packing peanuts. MSNBC is, by far, the 
least intolerable of the big three cable networks, and even watching it for a 
few hours is enough to send you to an animal shelter full of rabies in a 
hamburger suit.

John Heilemann and Mark Halperin are there to ad lib the sequel to their 
seminal book, Double Change: Game Down. You could turn the TV off and simulate 
the process of listening to them by saying: “When it’s warm out, you don’t need 
to wear a sweater,” then shoving a $5 bill down a whirring garbage disposal. If 
Michael Bloomberg decides to run for president, his campaign should be dragged 
into the street and shot merely for the fact that he pays this pair six 
figures, at a minimum. Rich people know how to fix things!

Helming this cruise off the edge of the world are chair-warmer Mika Brzezinski 
andsometime legal representative of an abortion-doctor murderer Joe Scarborough 
<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/report-before-congressional-run-scarborough-represented-killer-of-abortion-doctor>
, potentially the most luminous mind to ever talk loudly on the streets of 
Mossy Head, Florida. That he was never locked in a Port-O-Let at the Boggy 
Bayou Mullet Festival and dragged into a barren stretch of scrub oak in 1994 
tarnishes Okaloosa County’s legacy of being a place of good folk.

For depth, they’re periodically throwing it to Mike Barnicle, whose every good 
line should send you to Google just to make sure Mike Royko didn’t say it 
first. This is programming that makes you yearn for aJublia ad 
<http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7uh9/jublia-fight-it-dont-hide-it> just to see a more 
human toenail fungus.

Periodically leavening the broadcast are appearances by campaign strategists. 
Their candidates are doing very well! Their candidates’ opponents are going to 
be in trouble, especially if they don’t do well among people, unlike the 
candidates who are polling well among people. This outcome is going to surprise 
you, unless it doesn’t, which you shouldn’t have counted out, unless you should 
have expected it.

This klatsch of well-fed vampires is being filmed in front of a restaurant of 
New Hampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire> residents, in 
case you were wondering where the real meat is. If you held a mirror up to it, 
the only people you’d see would be diners sitting behind a stack of empty, 
well-lit chairs.

The Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui> files 
from Derry, New Hampshire, where Marco Rubio is attempting to contain the 
damage of a disastrous debate performance:

In the wake of the last Republican presidential debate, Marco Rubio has found 
himself combating an emerging narrative that he is too scripted - if not 
incapable of straying from talking points. But the Florida senator on Tuesday 
showed a more personal side when approached by aNew Hampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire> voter plagued by a family 
history of cancer.

It was meant to be a simple drive-by for Rubio, who visited multiple polling 
centers here as New Hampshire residents cast their votes for the 
first-in-the-nation primary. Standing outside a middle school, Rubio seamlessly 
worked his way through a group of volunteers and voters lined up on the 
sidewalk - shaking their hands and posing for pictures.

It was there that Stephanie Tsepas, a registered independent of Derry, awaited 
an opportunity to press the senator on cancer research.

Tsepas had met Rubio just a few nights earlier at a rally he held in the same 
school, but he was ushered away at the time without being able to offer her a 
response in full

Reintroducing herself, Tsepas spoke of how her husband had been diagnosed with 
colon cancer as a teenager and now her 12-year-old son was found to have a 
precursor of the same disease.

Rubio, to her surprise, remembered their previous encounter and this time 
engaged in a detailed - and deeply personal - conversation about cancer and its 
toll on society.

“My dad had lung cancer,” Rubio said. “He was 84. He smoked his whole life. It 
took him pretty quickly.”

There were also two aunts who died of pancreatic cancer, he added, and the 
diagnosis of his nephew with leukemia.

“He’s done well from it, but it’s tough,” Rubio said of his nephew, now 9 
years old. “Every year it’s something different. It’s not just cancer, it’s all 
the stuff that comes with it. It’s the infections, it’s the chemo, and it’s 
tough to see in a little boy.”

The tale of Rubio’s father is a staple on the campaign trail - the senator has 
long captivated crowds with the inspirational tale of his immigrant parents, 
who worked as a bartender and a maid to leave their children better off. But he 
has seldom opened up about his father’s passing just two months before Rubio 
was elected to the US Senate in 2010.

Rubio also discussed with Tsepas his support for more federal funding toward 
cancer research. Citing the initiative Barack Obama announced in last month’s 
State of the Union, to be led by vice president Joe Biden, who lost his son 
Beau to cancer last year, Rubio said he would favor boosting investment in 
developing and expanding targeted cancer therapies.

He also showed interest in the specific problems Tsepas was facing, ranging 
from where her son would be treated to whether a procedure to remove the boy’s 
colon as a preventive measure would be covered by their insurance.

“I’m sorry for what you’re facing,” Rubio said, placing his arm on her 
shoulder as he wrapped up the conversation.

Tsepas said she walked away more impressed than she had been before. When 
attending Rubio’s rally on Friday, she said, “I felt like I was in one of his 
commercials.”

“But today, I loved the honesty. It was definitely more personal for him,” 
Tsepas added.

Although heading into the polls still undecided, she ultimately chose not to 
vote for Rubio moments later. It was not that the senator wasn’t personable, 
she said, adding that it was a tough decision.

In the end, Tsepas simply concluded she was seeking a candidate with more 
experience.

“I just don’t think now is his time,” she said. “Maybe in four years.”

Made up his mind: This morning.

Support for Trump, 1-10: 10

“I like Trump’s positions. I was going to vote for Carson on principles, and 
because he’s more intellectual than Trump, but really I would vote for any of 
the Republican field except Bush. I’m a solid conservative, and I really like 
Trump.”

“There doesn’t need to be a revolution in poltics, but there needs to be a 
revolution in Washington DC and for the distribution of power to come back to 
the states.”
