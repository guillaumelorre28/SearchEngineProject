The 40-year-old finished the tournament in some style, returning a seven-under 
round of 65. The Open champion had raced to the turn in 31 and added further 
birdies at the 13th and 14th while his nearest rival,Danny Willett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/danny-willett>, who began the week 299,675 
points behind, signed for a closing 70 to finish one-under par.

“It has been a great year, the best year of my career,” said Stenson, speaking 
to Sky Sports. “I always thought it was going to be difficult top 2013 but I 
think I have done that. It’s been a great year and it’s great to finish in this 
way.”

Matt Fitzpatrick of Sheffield won the DP World Tour Championship after 
starting the day a shot behind France’s Victor Dubuisson, but moved to the top 
of a crowded leaderboard with three birdies in his first seven holes at Jumeirah
Golf <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf> Estates. He defeated Tyrrell 
Hatton by a shot after his five-under 67 took him to 17-under par.

Stenson’s rivals for the money-list title going into the season-ending event 
were a compatriot, Alex Noren, England’s Willett and Northern Ireland’sRory 
McIlroy <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy>.

McIlroy, the world No2, had visions of defending his title after four birdies 
and an eagle from the fifth took him out in 30, but the four-time major winner 
bogeyed the 11th and finished with a seven-under 65 for a share of ninth place 
with Stenson, Tommy Fleetwood and Jorge Campillo.
