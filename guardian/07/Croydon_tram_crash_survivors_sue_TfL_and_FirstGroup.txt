Survivors of the Croydon tram crash are suing Transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London (TfL) and First Group for 
compensation for injuries and trauma.

Seven people were killed and 51 injured when a speeding tram derailed on a 
bend in south London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/09/croydon-tram-crash-kills-at-least-seven-and-injures-more-than-50>
 in November.

Several passengers who survived the crash have instructed injury lawyers Irwin 
Mitchell to help them investigate who was responsible and demand payouts to 
help them cope with their injuries.

According to an interim report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch 
(RAIB), the tram, operated by FirstGroup on behalf of TfL, was travelling at
more than three times the 12mph (20km/h) speed limit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/16/croydon-tram-three-times-speed-limit-when-it-derailed-raib-report>
 when it came off the tracks on a sharp bend after a tunnel before Sandilands 
station. It landed on its side and travelled 25 metres (82ft) before coming to 
a stop.

The driver was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and is on bail.


One of the passengers taking legal action, Matthew Hewish, 25, sustained hip 
and ankle injuries, and was taken to Croydon hospital. He was off work for 
three weeks while being cared for at home.

“I can’t remember much from the crash,” he said. “I must have been knocked out 
or passed out, but when I came to, I remember scrambling for my phone and using 
the light to try to see.

“People died that day and while I, and others like me, know how lucky we are 
to have survived, we have the same questions as the families of those who died. 
We want to know what happened. We want to know what could have been done, if 
anything, to stop it, and most importantly, we need to stop it ever happening 
again.”

The RAIB investigation ruled out defects in the track or a brake malfunction. 
TfL <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/tfl> has introduced extra safety signage 
regarding speed restrictions before the bend, on the RAIB’s recommendation.

Irwin Mitchell has previously represented people injured in train crashes at 
Hatfield, Ladbroke Grove and Selby.

A TfL spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with everyone affected by the 
tram derailment. We continue to do all we can to offer support, including 
providing counselling and advising those affected to seek independent legal 
advice.

“Claims are being handled quickly and a number of interim payments have 
already been made. We completely understand the call for answers on what 
happened and what lessons should be learned and continue to assist with the 
investigations.”
