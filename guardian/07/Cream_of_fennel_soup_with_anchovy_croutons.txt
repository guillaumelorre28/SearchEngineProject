This soup draws on classic French soup-making methods. It comes out smooth and 
soft and is delicious cold in summer. At this time of year, serve it hot with 
these zingy little croutons. A winning starter or light supper.

Serves 4-6

1 tsp fennel seeds, lightly toasted
1 white onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, chopped
50g butter
2 sticks of celery, chopped small
1 leek, trimmed and chopped small
2 bulbs of fennel, chopped small
1.2 litres light chicken stock
150ml double cream
For the croutons
3 slices sourdough bread, left out for an hour to go slightly hard
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
6 anchovy fillets, chopped small


1 Gently toast the fennel seeds in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes, 
then crush them with the side of a knife and give them a quick chop.2 In a 
heavy-based saucepan, sweat the onion and garlic in the butter with the ground 
seeds for 5 minutes, then add the celery, leek and fennel. Season and stir.3 
Cover the pan and cook over a low heat for 20–25 minutes, stirring from time to 
time to prevent coloration.4 Add the stock, bring to the boil, give it a good 
skim and simmer for a further 15 minutes.5 For the croutons, remove the crusts 
and cut the bread into 2cm cubes.6 Heat the oil in a wide frying pan and add 
the anchovy pieces, using the back of a spoon to encourage them to melt in the 
hot oil. Now add and gently fry the croutons, moving them around constantly 
until they are approaching a nice, even golden brown – less than 5 minutes 
total cooking time.7 Use a slotted spoon to drain them briefly on kitchen roll 
and season with pepper.8 Meanwhile finish the soup by pouring it into the 
blender and whizzing until smooth. Stir in the cream and season.9 Serve in 
hot bowls with a scattering of croutons on top.
