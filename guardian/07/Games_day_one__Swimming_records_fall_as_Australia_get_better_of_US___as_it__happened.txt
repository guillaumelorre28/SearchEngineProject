That’s about all from Australia – as the United Kingdom awakes it only seems 
fair to hand over to Nick Ames, in London, continuing the 24/7 cycle of 
Olympics coverage: all the time, all the sports, forever.

To recap on the medals that have been awarded so far:

There have been twelve gold medals handed out (four in swimming, two for judo 
and shooting, one each for cycling, archery, fencing and weightlifting), with 
thirty-eight of any hue finding beaming new owners.

But before you crow or fret about your country’s relative performance, ponder 
this – there will be 2,102 medals awarded before these games are concluded. 
Yikes.

And for those among you whose outlook is more regional, the official Rio 
Olympics site even has a breakdown by continent. Asia has won 47% of the medals 
thus far, ahead of Europe (24%) and the Americas (21%). Don’t hold you breath 
for Antarctica.

That final beach volleyball game has now finished, with the US duo Kerri 
Walsh-Jennings and April Ross making short work of Australian pair Nicole Laird 
and Mariafe Artache del Solar, winning in two sets, 21-14, 21-13.

Walsh-Jennings and Ross were opponents in the London 2012 gold medal match, 
but have now combined their powers at Rio. With that pedigree, and in this kind 
of form you would argue they’re probably one of the favourites. Watch this 
space.

Hungary are eighth in the all-time Summer Olympics medal count and while 
Katinka Hosszu’s record-breaking 400m individual medley swimmay have set 
tongues wagging 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/hannah-miley-max-litchfield-adam-peaty-swimming-rio-2016>
, it wasn’t the only gold the European nation picked up on day one.

Emese Szasz stunned two-time world champion, Italian Rossella Fiamingo, in the 
women’s epee after trailing at one stage by four points, marking what my 
colleagues inform me was a day of big surprises at the fencing-drome.

Incidentally, Szasz is one of the more satisfying last names to type. Go on, 
try that one at home.

Some impressive upsets over in the field hockey, with 5th ranked USA defeating 
gold medal contenders and world no2 Argentina, 2-1. That was the same score 
elsewhere as 7th ranked Great Britain upset the highly fancied and world no3 
Australian side, with Lily Owsley and Alexandra Danson grabbing the goals.

In the mens, Argentina played out a thrilling 3-3 draw with the Netherlands, 
while favourites Australia edged antipodean rivals New Zealand 2-1.


But it was Belgium with arguably the shock result of the day, putting Great 
Britain to the sword, 4-1, while India survived a scare from Ireland, and Spain 
and Germany were comfortable winners.

And if you missed the latest at the football, a remarkable result to close the 
day’s play in the women’s competition.

Five-times world player of the year Marta may have carried the Olympic flag 
for Brazil, but she’s also continued to carry the hopes of the host nation, 
with a brace during her side’s emphatic demolition of Sweden, 5-1.

No slouches, the Scandinavians, they’re ranked 6th in the world – two above 
Brazil – but that might very well change after this result.

Brazil, USA and Canada are the teams to have confirmed their passage to the 
knockout rounds at this stage.

And from the boards to the beach, China have beaten Switzerland in the women’s 
beach volleyball, two sets to one, after earlier wins to the Netherlands, 
Brazil, Spain and Australia.

Good coastline nations, those.

In the men’s, Spain have overcome a first set hammering to best Austria, 
joining Poland, the Netherlands, USA, Brazil and Italy as today’s winners.

I’ve not trod the beaches from Swinoujscie to Gdansk – can anyone confirm 
there is sand and not pebbles there? Unless perhaps that’s what gives the 
Polish their edge. Rugged business.

There is of course one last game happening in the beach volleyball where the 
US duo Kerri Walsh-Jennings and April Ross currently lead Australian pair, 
Nicole Laird and the excellently named Mariafe Artache del Solar, 1-love.

Some results in the basketball, Serbia have accounted comfortably for 
Venezuela in the men’s Group A match 86-62, joining Australia and USA as first 
round winners.

In the women’s Group A, Japan have edged Belarus 77-73, to join France and 
Australia in the winner’s circle. An upset there? I’d hazard perhaps, yes.

Hello Stockholm, this is Australia calling, and what a time to pick up the 
liveblog.

Two golds in quick succession in the pool, courtesy Mack Horton and the 
women’s 4x100m freestyle relay team, has catapulted Australia to the head of 
the medal tally – drink it in, fellow antipodeans, it may not remain like that.

And as the beaming smiles of sisters Cate and Bronte Campbell, alongside 
team-mates Emma McKeon and Brittany Elmslie smile down upon us from the dais, 
there was also another salvo in the ongoing Mack Horton-Sun Yang war of words.

Now this is an interesting wrinkle. Australia’s Mack Horton beat Sun Yang to 
win the 400m freestyle, and, as AP reports, what happened after the race was 
even more dramatic.

Horton grabbed the lead for good on the next-to-last lap and held off the 
hard-charging Sun, the defending Olympic champion. But the bad blood between 
the two was on display for all to see as Horton celebrated after the race 
without even acknowledging the runner-up.

In fact, they climbed out of the pool side by side without so much as a 
passing glance.

After the prelims of the men’s 400 freestyle, Horton was asked about a 
reported incident between the two at the practice pool earlier in the week. The 
Aussie said Sun “splashed me to say hello, and I didn’t respond because I don’t 
have time for drug cheats.”

Sun served a three-month suspension for using a banned stimulant in 2014.

a swim from the Hungarian.

Shimizu (1), Katinka Hosszu (4), Mireia Belmonte Garcia (5) and Emily Overholt

That’s about all from Australia – as the United Kingdom awakes it only seems 
fair to hand over to Nick Ames, in London, continuing the 24/7 cycle of 
Olympics coverage: all the time, all the sports, forever.

You can follow all the action from day two, here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/07/rio-olympics-2016-day-two-games-live>
.
 
To recap on the medals that have been awarded so far:

There have been twelve gold medals handed out (four in swimming, two for judo 
and shooting, one each for cycling, archery, fencing and weightlifting), with 
thirty-eight of any hue finding beaming new owners.

But before you crow or fret about your country’s relative performance, ponder 
this – there will be 2,102 medals awarded before these games are concluded. 
Yikes.

And for those among you whose outlook is more regional, the official Rio 
Olympics site even has a breakdown by continent. Asia has won 47% of the medals 
thus far, ahead of Europe (24%) and the Americas (21%). Don’t hold you breath 
for Antarctica.

 
That final beach volleyball game has now finished, with the US duo Kerri 
Walsh-Jennings and April Ross making short work of Australian pair Nicole Laird 
and Mariafe Artache del Solar, winning in two sets, 21-14, 21-13.

Walsh-Jennings and Ross were opponents in the London 2012 gold medal match, 
but have now combined their powers at Rio. With that pedigree, and in this kind 
of form you would argue they’re probably one of the favourites. Watch this 
space.
 
Hungary are eighth in the all-time Summer Olympics medal count and while 
Katinka Hosszu’s record-breaking 400m individual medley swimmay have set 
tongues wagging 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/hannah-miley-max-litchfield-adam-peaty-swimming-rio-2016>
, it wasn’t the only gold the European nation picked up on day one.

Emese Szasz stunned two-time world champion, Italian Rossella Fiamingo, in the 
women’s epee after trailing at one stage by four points, marking what my 
colleagues inform me was a day of big surprises at the fencing-drome.

Mohammad Jamali/Getty Images 
Incidentally, Szasz is one of the more satisfying last names to type. Go on, 
try that one at home.
 
Some impressive upsets over in the field hockey, with 5th ranked USA defeating 
gold medal contenders and world no2 Argentina, 2-1. That was the same score 
elsewhere as 7th ranked Great Britain upset the highly fancied and world no3 
Australian side, with Lily Owsley and Alexandra Danson grabbing the goals.

In the mens, Argentina played out a thrilling 3-3 draw with the Netherlands, 
while favourites Australia edged antipodean rivals New Zealand 2-1.


But it was Belgium with arguably the shock result of the day, putting Great 
Britain to the sword, 4-1, while India survived a scare from Ireland, and Spain 
and Germany were comfortable winners.
 
An interesting development over at the official Team USA twitter account, 
where silver appears to have risen in the precious metal stakes.

Amid one of the bleakest years for human migration the Refugee Olympic Team 
has already buoyed the hearts of many around the world.

You’ve no doubt already seen the sparkling smile of Yusra Mardini, but as 
Robert Kitson reports poolside, her remarkable swimming story just continues.

And if you missed the latest at the football, a remarkable result to close the 
day’s play in the women’s competition.

Five-times world player of the year Marta may have carried the Olympic flag 
for Brazil, but she’s also continued to carry the hopes of the host nation, 
with a brace during her side’s emphatic demolition of Sweden, 5-1.

No slouches, the Scandinavians, they’re ranked 6th in the world – two above 
Brazil – but that might very well change after this result.

Brazil, USA and Canada are the teams to have confirmed their passage to the 
knockout rounds at this stage.
 
And from the boards to the beach, China have beaten Switzerland in the women’s 
beach volleyball, two sets to one, after earlier wins to the Netherlands, 
Brazil, Spain and Australia.

Good coastline nations, those.

In the men’s, Spain have overcome a first set hammering to best Austria, 
joining Poland, the Netherlands, USA, Brazil and Italy as today’s winners.

I’ve not trod the beaches from Swinoujscie to Gdansk – can anyone confirm 
there is sand and not pebbles there? Unless perhaps that’s what gives the 
Polish their edge. Rugged business.

qualifying match. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images 
There is of course one last game happening in the beach volleyball where the 
US duo Kerri Walsh-Jennings and April Ross currently lead Australian pair, 
Nicole Laird and the excellently named Mariafe Artache del Solar, 1-love.
 
Some results in the basketball, Serbia have accounted comfortably for 
Venezuela in the men’s Group A match 86-62, joining Australia and USA as first 
round winners.

In the women’s Group A, Japan have edged Belarus 77-73, to join France and 
Australia in the winner’s circle. An upset there? I’d hazard perhaps, yes.
 
Hello Stockholm, this is Australia calling, and what a time to pick up the 
liveblog.

Two golds in quick succession in the pool, courtesy Mack Horton and the 
women’s 4x100m freestyle relay team, has catapulted Australia to the head of 
the medal tally – drink it in, fellow antipodeans, it may not remain like that.

And as the beaming smiles of sisters Cate and Bronte Campbell, alongside 
team-mates Emma McKeon and Brittany Elmslie smile down upon us from the dais, 
there was also another salvo in the ongoing Mack Horton-Sun Yang war of words.

Away from the pool, something for the hosts to cheer: in the women’s soccer, 
Brazil have just scored a fifth against Sweden. Jogo bonito!
 
So that’s it for the swimming this evening. Gold medals for Japan, Hungary, 
and Australia (twice). Three silvers for USA, and new world records in the 400m 
women’s IM and the 4x100m women’s freestyle relay.
 
Hugs all around, and two fabulous swims from Bronte and Cate Campbell. Another 
swimming gold for Australia!

their new World Record in winning the women’s 4x100m Freestyle Relay after Cate 
Campbell powered home on the final leg. Photograph: Bernd Thissen/EPA  
Brilliant from Cate Campbell, and a new world record! USA second, and Canada 
third!
 
Great leg by Bronte Campbell, and Australia lead at 300m by 0.42. Campbell v 
Ledecky for the anchor leg!
 
USA still ahead at 200m, by 0.61sec from Australia, and Sweden third.
 
After 100m, it’s USA, just, from Australia and Canada.
 
This should be wild. And we’re off!
 
Now time for the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay final. Australia are 
favorites, but USA and the Netherlands have eyes on medals.
 
Peaty posted 57.62 – not enough to lower his record, but still the second 
fastest time in history. What a swimmer Peaty is!
 
Adam Peaty wins, Codey Miller of USA in second, and van der Burgh in third. No 
new world record for Peaty this time, but he looked dominant.
 
And now Peaty goes in the second semi: he’s in lane four. Cameron van der 
Burgh of South Africa in six is another on to watch.
 
In the first semi, it’s Koseki of Japan, Cordes of USA and Gomes of Brazil, 
1,2,3 – all slower than they were in the heats. Jake Packard of Australia was 
fourth, and Ross Murdoch of Britain faded to finish sixth.
 
Adam Peaty is back in the pool after setting a new world record earlier in the 
day. It’s the semi-finals of the men’s 100m breaststroke, and Peaty goes in the 
second semi.
 
Now this is an interesting wrinkle. Australia’s Mack Horton beat Sun Yang to 
win the 400m freestyle, and, as AP reports, what happened after the race was 
even more dramatic.

Horton grabbed the lead for good on the next-to-last lap and held off the 
hard-charging Sun, the defending Olympic champion. But the bad blood between 
the two was on display for all to see as Horton celebrated after the race 
without even acknowledging the runner-up.

In fact, they climbed out of the pool side by side without so much as a 
passing glance.

After the prelims of the men’s 400 freestyle, Horton was asked about a 
reported incident between the two at the practice pool earlier in the week. The 
Aussie said Sun “splashed me to say hello, and I didn’t respond because I don’t 
have time for drug cheats.”

Sun served a three-month suspension for using a banned stimulant in 2014.
 
That’s Hosszu’s first ever Olympic medal. She won in 4:26.36 – DiRado was 
second in 4:31.15.
 
That was incredible. Hosszu broke the world record by two seconds! Hannah 
Miley was just beaten out by Belmonte for that bronze medal.
 
DiRado silver, and Belmonte of Spain bronze!
 
Hosszu is going to smash the world record – she’s almost five seconds clear! 
DiRado is second, and Hannah Miley in third!
 
Good backstroke leg from DiRado, but Hosszu is almost three second clear! What 
a swim from the Hungarian.
 
And they’re away. After 100m, Hosszu is quite a way clear, with Shimizu in 
second and Belmonte in third.
 
DiRado goes in three. Britain’s Aimee Wilmott and Hannah Miley are in two and 
six respectively, and Elizabeth Beisel of USA will swim in seven. Sakiko 
Shimizu (1), Katinka Hosszu (4), Mireia Belmonte Garcia (5) and Emily Overholt 
(8) complete the set. Hosszu will be one for DiRado to watch.
