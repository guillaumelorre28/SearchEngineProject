Super Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> is over – 
notwithstanding a lot of delegate math left to be done and that tardy Alaska 
caucuses result (with 22.2% reporting, Donald Trump leads Ted Cruz 
35.9%-33.1%). Here’s what we learned:

 * Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee ... yet. 
 * Nevertheless, it was a big night for the New York billionaire, and for 
Hillary Clinton.They won seven states each, picked up armloads of delegates and 
advanced their respective claims on their parties’ presidential nominations. 
 * It’s not over yet – on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders’s four state 
victories keep the race alive, and on the Republican side Ted Cruz’s big win in 
Texas and second win in Oklahoma do the same. 
 * Florida senator Marco Rubio had a tough night. He won only one state - 
Minnesota – and fell short of the 20% minimum needed to earn delegates in 
Texas, Alabama and Vermont. He appeared to fall 100+ delegates behind Cruz. 
 * Rubio vowed to fight on, telling supporters the race was in its early stages
and he would start to clean up later this month.

 * Our comprehensive results page is here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-results-live-state-by-state>
. (This isn’t something we learned tonight but this seems like a good place to 
mention it.)

 * Clinton profited from giant 
<https://twitter.com/CarrieNBCNews/status/704864053601169408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
 60- to 80-point margins among African American voters across the South. 
 * What about Ben Carson and John Kasich? Kasich came in second in Vermont. 
Carson was in contention nowhere. Kasich called on Rubio to drop out and Carson 
said: “I will remain.” 
 * The races could resolve dramatically in the next two weeks. Nine states 
host contests between now and 15 March, when the contests suddenly become 
winner-take-all and crucial states vote including Florida, Ohio and North 
Carolina. 
 * As for color, there was a strange Trump 
victory-rally-slash-press-conference that ran interminably.What made it strange 
was New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who endorsed Trump last Friday, 
introduced Trump and then stood behind him the whole time. But the look on 
Christie’s face was one of doom.The internet noticed

Julia O'Malley

Just after the polls closed in Alaska, Sam Moore, 31, arrived at the Lofts 
hotel in Anchorage where a small group of Republicans were gathering to watch 
results come in. He was holding aMarco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> sign.

“It’s a marathon not a sprint, I think he still has a chance,” he said. “We 
can’t let Trump win the nomination.”

In the bar, Cary Taylor, 47, and friends watched national news reporting big 
wins for Trump. Alaska’s poll results were still hours away, but many expected 
a similar result.

Taylor supports Trump, he said, because he feels he can “bring back common 
sense to American government.” He feels good about Trump’s progress.

“What I’m seeing in America is someone who, love ‘em or hate ‘em, at least has 
actually performed in the market, has actually proven himself.”

The results so far 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-results-live-state-by-state?CMP=ons_b-supertuesday_c-us_g-1>
 (10% in) show Trump ahead in Alaska with 34.2% of the vote.

Mona Chalabi

The big takeaway from tonight? A presidential race between Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump looks 
even more likely,writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi:

That’s because both candidates finished Super Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> by making big gains in 
their delegate count numbers. Final delegate numbers are still being calculated 
but at the time of writing, Clinton added 436 delegates to her running total 
(putting her at 527 delegates compared to Bernie Sanders’ 325) and Trump gained 
an extra 186 delegates (giving him a total of 268 so far compared to Cruz’s 
142).

Even though delegates are what really matters (and those are often dependent 
on vote share) the simple fact of coming first can matter too. Just askBernie 
Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> - the Senator won 
in four states even though some expectations had him winning only Vermont, his 
home state. Although he still has an uphill struggle to get the 2,382 delegates 
needed to become the Democratic nominee, Sanders might now be perceived as more 
of a viable candidate among voters.

The race goes on.

Rubio appears to have fallen short in key 20% cutoff states...
Rick Klein (@rickklein) 
Rubio said earlier he would get a "major number of delegates in virtually 
every state." But TX: 0. VT: 0. AL: 0. Still counting, but...

While Cruz appears to have sewn up Texas

Sanders beat Clinton in Oklahoma – where the former secretary state defeated 
Barack Obama in the 2008 primary.

She’s getting worse at Oklahoma, it appears:

Trump's lead: about 21% of delegates he needs

How’s the overall delegate haul this evening shaking out? Cook Political 
report seesTrump with at least 262 total, of the 1,237 needed to win the 
nomination, and the AP sees Trump with at least 257.

Cook sees a big gap opening between Cruz and Rubio...
Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) 
My back of the envelope delegate projections: Trump 262, Cruz 215, Rubio 93.

<https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/704893002813149190> 
While the Associated Press counts a significant haul for Trump this Super 
Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> and a lesser haul 
for Cruz:

With results still coming in, Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday 
delegates, while Cruz picked up at least 52. Overall, Trump led with 257 
delegates, Cruz 106, Rubio 67. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican 
nomination for president.

On the Democratic side, Clinton was assured of winning at least 441 of the 865 
delegates at stake on Super Tuesday. Sanders was sure to get at least 262. 
Including superdelegates, Clinton had at least 989 delegates. Sanders had at 
least 349. It takes 2,383 Democratic delegates to win.

Clinton has won at least 10 states since the nomination contests began, with 
Sanders victorious in at least five.

Among Democrats, Trump has won at least nine states, with three for Cruz and 
one for Rubio.

On Super Tuesday 2008, McCain won a large percentage of the vote and a far 
greater share of delegates. Just FYI.

My take on Bernie's night. MA loss feels like Iowa and Nevada: a missed 
opportunity to make the revolution real instead of just interesting.

Carson: 'I will remain'

Carson, whom voters in most states have just resoundingly counted out, has 
released a statement to supporters saying: “I am not moved or discouraged when 
the political class count me out”:

As long we continue to receive their support, and the Lord keeps opening 
doors, I will remain in this presidential race. The stakes are too high to 
willingly hand our country over once again to the pundits and the political 
class. I truly believe in America and the potential to return to the values on 
which this country was founded.

Rubio denied statewide delegates in Alabama

Ouch. Of Alabama’s 50 delegates, 26 are statewide and 21 are awarded per 
congressional district (the remaining three are free-floating).

Florida senator Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> 
may still clear the 20% threshold within a congressional district to access 
some delegates in Alabama. But he’s fallen short of 20% statewide:

Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Alabama is 100% in and Rubio is only at 18.5%. He gets no statewide delegates

GA: 23.8% (88% in)

VT: 19.0% (92%)
AL: 18.2% (82%)

Trump wins Vermont

Make that seven states for Trump, with only Alaska outstanding. If Trump wins 
Alaska, the win tally for the evening would be Trump 8, Cruz 2 and Rubio 1.

Alaska polls to close

Alaska hosted Republican caucuses tonight and has 28 delegates to offer with a 
13% threshold to qualify for delegates.

We’ll see if we get a quick call right at midnight ET.

Newt Gingrich agrees (and no surprise here?) with the blog

: Trump’s news conference struck a notable – and favorable, from where we sit – 
contrast with the run-of-the-mill rah-rah rallies of the other candidates 
tonight:
Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) 
Trump's decision to hold a serious press conference instead of a campaign 
speech was masterful and a great contrast to Cruz and Rubio.

As CNN called the Minnesota caucuses for Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> at 10.30pm local time, the 
right-side room of The Local in downtown Minneapolis erupted in cheers and 
chants of “Bernie! Bernie!”, as staff, supporters and volunteers raised their 
arms and clinked their glasses.

Phil Khalar-Gibson, who spent the weekend criss-crossing Minneapolis educating 
people about the caucus process and handing out Sanders literature arrived 
exuberantly just moments before the call. “My precinct was crazy!” he shouted, 
pulling out sheets of numbers showing overwhelming caucus tallies in Sanders’ 
favor.

Ryan Flanders, who campaigned and caucused for Obama in 2008 and voted for 
Green party candidate Jill Stein in 2012, said his personal circumstances 
hadn’t allowed him to volunteer for Sanders despite his excitement, but that he 
showed up early at his caucus to help sign potential caucus goers in. “I want 
them to be able to have their voices heard”, he said.

And, if the results are any indication, many new caucus-goers’ voices were 
definitely heard.

First-time caucus goer and life-long Minnesota resident Simon Hardy said: 
“This is probably the first candidate I’ve really felt inspired by.”

His friend, Andrew Henley - who also caucused for the first time tonight - 
said he turned out for Sanders because “I saw a glimmer of what could be 
possible for my great-grandchildren, and felt a responsibility to participate 
beyond my personal motivation.”

Hardy plans to vote Democratic no matter who wins the party’s primaries: “The 
thought of a Führer Trump terrifies me,” he said.

Jeb Lund

Weird times at the official Arkansas Republican Party party at the Embassy 
Suites on — and this is really gilding the lily — Financial Services Drive in 
west Little Rock.

This has been a great night for the Arkansas Republican Party. Voter 
participation in the state has broken roughly 60-40 in their favor, marking 
easily the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans have voted in 
greater numbers than Democrats in these contests.

But the official state GOP party is the only party in town not run by 
Democrats. The Clinton people are whooping it up in the same way that a 
Division 5A high school whoops it up after beating a Division 1A team by 72 
points at the homecoming game. The Sanders people are at a local brewery near 
the riverwalk. They deserve it. But as for the Republicans, no one — not Cruz, 
not Rubio, not Trump — had an actual official office here, the party planning, 
as does so many things with conservatism, devolves to the state.

The state GOP party isn’t in danger of going off the rails. It is glued to the 
rails. It is welded and nail-gunned to the rails.

Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson speaks, then finishes to a scatter of 
applause. For people having a historic night, there are no whoops, whistles or 
even a vaguely Stone Cold Steve Austin-esque HELL YEAH. If you weren’t paying 
attention to his speech, you might not have noticed it ended. There is a 
faintly funereal sense to his appearance. The governor has lost something close 
to him, and it is political capital.

Hutchinson broke from state party tradition and endorsed Rubio before the 
primary, and several state party leaders followed him. Perhaps that decision 
owed more to the primary being held unusually early, but all anyone will read 
into the act is another breached barricade in the stop Trump movement.

The screens with Fox News at the rear of the Embassy Suites restaurant — and 
the variegated Fox, CNN, MSNBC feeds on the screens on the right side — all 
show the same thing.Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is walking away with the 
party, and as soon as the results come in from here, it’s going to turn out he 
walked away with Arkansas too.

Rubio vs. 20%

Five states tonight deny delegates to any candidate who does not get at least 
20% of the vote.Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> 
has hung right at the 20% mark in all five. Ending up just below the mark could 
make Rubio’s night significantly worse, in terms of picking up delegates (which 
is all that matters).

He’s looking good in Georgia. In Alabama and in Texas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas>, the big delegate prize – not so 
much. Here’s how Rubio stands currently in the five states in question:

Alabama: 18.3% with 79.3% reporting.

Georgia: 23.8% with 87.9% reporting.

Bernie Sanders scored a critical Super Tuesday victory against Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in Colorado, sparking 
celebrations across the liberal city of Denver as the Vermont senator struggled 
with significant losses in other states across the country.

Emily Rosa, a 23-year-old Denver voter - carrying a sign that read “Bernie: 
Championing LGBT rights before it was cool” - said it was exciting to see a 
female presidential candidate winning throughout the US, but noted that 
Sanders’ momentum felt more historic to her.

“It’s really awesome that a woman is doing so well, but at the same time, what 
Sanders is doing is really this grassroots movement,” said Rosa, an art 
director at a design firm. “He’s getting so many people out in the younger 
generation and that’s so cool.”

She added: “He’s showing that a politician can get this far without all that 
campaign money, and that message is really important and a historic one ... I 
feel like I’m contributing to something bigger than myself.”

Rosa was one of many pro-Sanders voters who crowded into a middle school 
cafeteria in Denver at a caucus that appeared to attract fewer Clinton 
supporters and dragged on for hours as organizers slowly signed in a bottleneck 
of registered Democrats.

Some elderly voters sat on the floor of the school cafeteria and gym, 
complaining that there were not enough chairs for those who needed them.

Colorado was a key battleground for Sanders after he failed to gain traction 
in South Carolina last month and lost other important southern states onSuper 
Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday>. Colorado has a 
large bloc of independent voters who are unaffiliated with either political 
party, and the Sanders campaign has worked on the ground to register new 
Democrats.

Super Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> is over – 
notwithstanding a lot of delegate math left to be done and that tardy Alaska 
caucuses result (with 22.2% reporting, Donald Trump leads Ted Cruz 
35.9%-33.1%). Here’s what we learned:

 * Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee ... yet. 
 * Nevertheless, it was a big night for the New York billionaire, and for 
Hillary Clinton.They won seven states each, picked up armloads of delegates and 
advanced their respective claims on their parties’ presidential nominations. 
 * It’s not over yet – on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders’s four state 
victories keep the race alive, and on the Republican side Ted Cruz’s big win in 
Texas and second win in Oklahoma do the same. 
 * Florida senator Marco Rubio had a tough night. He won only one state - 
Minnesota – and fell short of the 20% minimum needed to earn delegates in 
Texas, Alabama and Vermont. He appeared to fall 100+ delegates behind Cruz. 
 * Rubio vowed to fight on, telling supporters the race was in its early stages
and he would start to clean up later this month.

 * Our comprehensive results page is here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-results-live-state-by-state>
. (This isn’t something we learned tonight but this seems like a good place to 
mention it.)

 * Clinton profited from giant 
<https://twitter.com/CarrieNBCNews/status/704864053601169408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
 60- to 80-point margins among African American voters across the South. 
 * What about Ben Carson and John Kasich? Kasich came in second in Vermont. 
Carson was in contention nowhere. Kasich called on Rubio to drop out and Carson 
said: “I will remain.” 
 * The races could resolve dramatically in the next two weeks. Nine states 
host contests between now and 15 March, when the contests suddenly become 
winner-take-all and crucial states vote including Florida, Ohio and North 
Carolina. 
 * As for color, there was a strange Trump 
victory-rally-slash-press-conference that ran interminably.What made it strange 
was New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who endorsed Trump last Friday, 
introduced Trump and then stood behind him the whole time. But the look on 
Christie’s face was one of doom.The internet noticed

Just after the polls closed in Alaska, Sam Moore, 31, arrived at the Lofts 
hotel in Anchorage where a small group of Republicans were gathering to watch 
results come in. He was holding aMarco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> sign.

“It’s a marathon not a sprint, I think he still has a chance,” he said. “We 
can’t let Trump win the nomination.”

In the bar, Cary Taylor, 47, and friends watched national news reporting big 
wins for Trump. Alaska’s poll results were still hours away, but many expected 
a similar result.

Taylor supports Trump, he said, because he feels he can “bring back common 
sense to American government.” He feels good about Trump’s progress.

“What I’m seeing in America is someone who, love ‘em or hate ‘em, at least has 
actually performed in the market, has actually proven himself.”

The results so far 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-results-live-state-by-state?CMP=ons_b-supertuesday_c-us_g-1>
 (10% in) show Trump ahead in Alaska with 34.2% of the vote.
 
The big takeaway from tonight? A presidential race between Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump looks 
even more likely,writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi:

That’s because both candidates finished Super Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> by making big gains in 
their delegate count numbers. Final delegate numbers are still being calculated 
but at the time of writing, Clinton added 436 delegates to her running total 
(putting her at 527 delegates compared to Bernie Sanders’ 325) and Trump gained 
an extra 186 delegates (giving him a total of 268 so far compared to Cruz’s 
142).

Even though delegates are what really matters (and those are often dependent 
on vote share) the simple fact of coming first can matter too. Just askBernie 
Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> - the Senator won 
in four states even though some expectations had him winning only Vermont, his 
home state. Although he still has an uphill struggle to get the 2,382 delegates 
needed to become the Democratic nominee, Sanders might now be perceived as more 
of a viable candidate among voters.

The race goes on.
 
Rubio appears to have fallen short in key 20% cutoff states...
Rick Klein (@rickklein) 
Rubio said earlier he would get a "major number of delegates in virtually 
every state." But TX: 0. VT: 0. AL: 0. Still counting, but...

How’s the overall delegate haul this evening shaking out? Cook Political 
report seesTrump with at least 262 total, of the 1,237 needed to win the 
nomination, and the AP sees Trump with at least 257.

While the Associated Press counts a significant haul for Trump this Super 
Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> and a lesser haul 
for Cruz:

With results still coming in, Trump had won at least 139 Super Tuesday 
delegates, while Cruz picked up at least 52. Overall, Trump led with 257 
delegates, Cruz 106, Rubio 67. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican 
nomination for president.

On the Democratic side, Clinton was assured of winning at least 441 of the 865 
delegates at stake on Super Tuesday. Sanders was sure to get at least 262. 
Including superdelegates, Clinton had at least 989 delegates. Sanders had at 
least 349. It takes 2,383 Democratic delegates to win.

Clinton has won at least 10 states since the nomination contests began, with 
Sanders victorious in at least five.

Among Democrats, Trump has won at least nine states, with three for Cruz and 
one for Rubio.

As long we continue to receive their support, and the Lord keeps opening 
doors, I will remain in this presidential race. The stakes are too high to 
willingly hand our country over once again to the pundits and the political 
class. I truly believe in America and the potential to return to the values on

Ouch. Of Alabama’s 50 delegates, 26 are statewide and 21 are awarded per 
congressional district (the remaining three are free-floating).

Florida senator Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> 
may still clear the 20% threshold within a congressional district to access 
some delegates in Alabama. But he’s fallen short of 20% statewide:

As CNN called the Minnesota caucuses for Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> at 10.30pm local time, the 
right-side room of The Local in downtown Minneapolis erupted in cheers and 
chants of “Bernie! Bernie!”, as staff, supporters and volunteers raised their 
arms and clinked their glasses.

Phil Khalar-Gibson, who spent the weekend criss-crossing Minneapolis educating 
people about the caucus process and handing out Sanders literature arrived 
exuberantly just moments before the call. “My precinct was crazy!” he shouted, 
pulling out sheets of numbers showing overwhelming caucus tallies in Sanders’ 
favor.

Ryan Flanders, who campaigned and caucused for Obama in 2008 and voted for 
Green party candidate Jill Stein in 2012, said his personal circumstances 
hadn’t allowed him to volunteer for Sanders despite his excitement, but that he 
showed up early at his caucus to help sign potential caucus goers in. “I want 
them to be able to have their voices heard”, he said.

And, if the results are any indication, many new caucus-goers’ voices were 
definitely heard.

First-time caucus goer and life-long Minnesota resident Simon Hardy said: 
“This is probably the first candidate I’ve really felt inspired by.”

His friend, Andrew Henley - who also caucused for the first time tonight - 
said he turned out for Sanders because “I saw a glimmer of what could be 
possible for my great-grandchildren, and felt a responsibility to participate 
beyond my personal motivation.”

Hardy plans to vote Democratic no matter who wins the party’s primaries: “The 
thought of a Führer Trump terrifies me,” he said.
 
Weird times at the official Arkansas Republican Party party at the Embassy 
Suites on — and this is really gilding the lily — Financial Services Drive in 
west Little Rock.

This has been a great night for the Arkansas Republican Party. Voter 
participation in the state has broken roughly 60-40 in their favor, marking 
easily the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans have voted in 
greater numbers than Democrats in these contests.

But the official state GOP party is the only party in town not run by 
Democrats. The Clinton people are whooping it up in the same way that a 
Division 5A high school whoops it up after beating a Division 1A team by 72 
points at the homecoming game. The Sanders people are at a local brewery near 
the riverwalk. They deserve it. But as for the Republicans, no one — not Cruz, 
not Rubio, not Trump — had an actual official office here, the party planning, 
as does so many things with conservatism, devolves to the state.

The state GOP party isn’t in danger of going off the rails. It is glued to the 
rails. It is welded and nail-gunned to the rails.

Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson speaks, then finishes to a scatter of 
applause. For people having a historic night, there are no whoops, whistles or 
even a vaguely Stone Cold Steve Austin-esque HELL YEAH. If you weren’t paying 
attention to his speech, you might not have noticed it ended. There is a 
faintly funereal sense to his appearance. The governor has lost something close 
to him, and it is political capital.

Hutchinson broke from state party tradition and endorsed Rubio before the 
primary, and several state party leaders followed him. Perhaps that decision 
owed more to the primary being held unusually early, but all anyone will read 
into the act is another breached barricade in the stop Trump movement.

The screens with Fox News at the rear of the Embassy Suites restaurant — and 
the variegated Fox, CNN, MSNBC feeds on the screens on the right side — all 
show the same thing.Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is walking away with the 
party, and as soon as the results come in from here, it’s going to turn out he 
walked away with Arkansas too.

 
Five states tonight deny delegates to any candidate who does not get at least 
20% of the vote.Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> 
has hung right at the 20% mark in all five. Ending up just below the mark could 
make Rubio’s night significantly worse, in terms of picking up delegates (which 
is all that matters).

He’s looking good in Georgia. In Alabama and in Texas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas>, the big delegate prize – not so 
much. Here’s how Rubio stands currently in the five states in question:

Alabama: 18.3% with 79.3% reporting.

Georgia: 23.8% with 87.9% reporting.

Tennessee: 20.8% with 95.1% reporting.

Texas: 17.3% with 52.2% reporting.

Vermont: 19.4% with 82.9% reporting.
 
Bernie Sanders scored a critical Super Tuesday victory against Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in Colorado, sparking 
celebrations across the liberal city of Denver as the Vermont senator struggled 
with significant losses in other states across the country.

Emily Rosa, a 23-year-old Denver voter - carrying a sign that read “Bernie: 
Championing LGBT rights before it was cool” - said it was exciting to see a 
female presidential candidate winning throughout the US, but noted that 
Sanders’ momentum felt more historic to her.

“It’s really awesome that a woman is doing so well, but at the same time, what 
Sanders is doing is really this grassroots movement,” said Rosa, an art 
director at a design firm. “He’s getting so many people out in the younger 
generation and that’s so cool.”

She added: “He’s showing that a politician can get this far without all that 
campaign money, and that message is really important and a historic one ... I 
feel like I’m contributing to something bigger than myself.”

Rosa was one of many pro-Sanders voters who crowded into a middle school 
cafeteria in Denver at a caucus that appeared to attract fewer Clinton 
supporters and dragged on for hours as organizers slowly signed in a bottleneck 
of registered Democrats.

Some elderly voters sat on the floor of the school cafeteria and gym, 
complaining that there were not enough chairs for those who needed them.

Colorado was a key battleground for Sanders after he failed to gain traction 
in South Carolina last month and lost other important southern states onSuper 
Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday>. Colorado has a 
large bloc of independent voters who are unaffiliated with either political 
party, and the Sanders campaign has worked on the ground to register new 
Democrats.
