Rei Kawakubo

will become only the second living designer to have an exhibition at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, in May 2017. Following Yves 
Saint Laurent in 1983, Kawakubo is arguably as influential. The designer, who 
founded her label Comme des Garçons in her native Japan in 1969 and began 
showing her collections in Paris in 1981, has been the figurehead of all that 
is strange, conceptual and artistic in fashion since then.

The Costume Institute’s curator-in-charge, Andrew Bolton, says: “By inviting 
us to rethink fashion as a site of constant creation, recreation and hybridity, 
she has defined the aesthetics of our time.” The ultimate compliment comes from 
fellow designers; Karl Lagerfeld, Nicolas Ghesquère andMarc Jacobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/04/marc-jacobs-i-have-the-word-shameless-tattooed-on-my-chest>
 are fans, and Jacobs wears Kawakubo-designed skirts. The film directorJohn 
Waters 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/04/john-waters-on-his-rei-kawakubo-obsession.html>
 dedicated an entire chapter of his 2010 book Role Models to Kawakubo, calling 
her a “genius fashion dictator. She specialises in clothes that are torn, 
crooked, permanently wrinkled, ill-fitting and expensive … Ms Kawakubo is my 
god.”

The May exhibition at the Costume Institute provides the theme of the annual 
Met Gala, the celebrity-packed event chaired by American Vogue’s Anna Wintour. 
With this year’s Manus x Machina exhibition dedicated to technology, this made

. Zayn Malik wore a much-memed robot arm, while Kim Kardashian had a dress that 
owed something to C-3PO, and Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom had matching 
Tamagochis pinned to their clothes.

A red carpet dressed in Comme des Garçons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/commes-des-gar-ons> will be a different 
story. Notable collections include the brand’s all-black Paris debut. Dubbed 
“Hiroshima chic” by some critics, it contrasted wildly with the OTT glamour 
emerging in the 80s. This was followed by the Dress Meets Body, Body Meets 
Dress collection in 1997, where dresses came with extra “lumps and bumps” 
beyond those on the body of their wearer, and an autumn/winter 2012 collection, 
where clothes were designed to look two-dimensional. All were in some way in 
opposition to the state of fashion, with the 2012 collection a comment on how 
fast fashion has given a throwaway feel to the wider industry. The exhibition 
promises 120 designs all on mannequins at eye level, displayed without glass.

While her designs are esoteric, Kawakubo – with her husband Adrian Joffe, who 
acts as president of the Comme des Garçons group – has made an empire over 
40-plus years in fashion. There are perfumes, T-shirts and shirts under the 
Comme des Garçons umbrella. This results in an annual turnover of around £204m, 
flagships in New York London and Tokyo, and the huge Dover Street Market store 
in Haymarket in London, which sells all of the Comme des Garçons lines plus 
brands ranging from Céline to Palace. Kawakubo is also shrewd: working with 
alum Junya Watanabe to set up his own line, and helping fashion’s current 
bright young thing,Gosha Rubchinskiy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/12/russian-fashion-gosha-rubchinskiy-post-soviet-designer-menswear>
, by operating his business. With Comme des Garçons backing, Rubchinskiy’s 
label has grown 350% over the past year. Arguably, Kawakubo’s success is cold, 
hard proof that creativity and commercialism can co-exist in fashion. This 
exhibition pays tribute to that achievement.
