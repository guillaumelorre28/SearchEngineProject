Adam Scott <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-scott> is coming. And his 
rivals at the Australian PGA Championship know it.

Scott produced what he proclaimed to be his best round of the Australian 
summer on Friday, posting a second consecutive four-under-par 68 to be tied for 
third with Ryan Fox at eight-under, just four shots off leader Andrew Dodt.

And it couldn’t have come at a better time for the 36-year-old after he 
endured disappointing World Cup ofGolf <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf> 
and Australian Open campaigns.

“I played really well today – the best I’ve played in a couple of weeks,” 
Scott said.

“My striking was crisp. It was strong.

“I started driving the ball properly and it carried onto the rest of my game 
as well.”

And it had the potential to be even better.

Scott went close to an ace on the par-three 16th and had several birdie 
opportunities during his round only for his fickle putting to fail him on the 
Royal Pines greens.

Not that he was concerned by it.

“The greens were very slow this afternoon,” he said.

“It’s very difficult to make putts on call when it’s not a true roll.”

Scott’s 68 on Friday was bettered only by leader Dodt, who hasn’t had a 
professional win since February 2015.

And the world No515 is all too aware that the No7 ranked player is his biggest 
challenger.

“It’s nice to be in front of him after two rounds but unfortunately that 
doesn’t count for anything,” Dodt said of Scott.

“You’ve got to be in front after four rounds.

“I’m sure he’ll attack over the weekend and play really well so I’ve got to do 
the same.”
