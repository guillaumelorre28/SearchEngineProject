Mo Farah <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mo-farah> revealed his desire to 
compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after becoming the first man to win three 
consecutive Great North Runs. Farah ended his remarkable season with a 
convincing victory in the Newcastle to South Shields half-marathon with a time 
of 1hr 0min 04sec. He raised his hand down the home stretch to mimic an Alan 
Shearer goal celebration.

Farah was pushed for much of the race by the American Dathan Ritzenhein but 
kicked on down the slope with one mile to go, having learned the same tactic 
from Kenenisa Bekele when losing out to the Ethiopian in 2013. He finished 
eight seconds ahead of Ritzenhein.

The 33-year-old, who defended his 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic titles

 in Rio last month, is expected to retire from track racing after next year’s 
world championships in London and turn his attention to the marathon.

“I think it would be incredible if I can go for another Olympics,” Farah said. 
“But in athletics we don’t take anything for granted. I’ve got to look after my 
body and get through each year as it comes rather than plan ahead.

“Half-marathons are tough. I find the track a lot easier. I only feel the pain 
in the last lap or two laps there. It’s a different pain. I don’t know if I 
need to shorten my stride. If you compare how I run to how marathoners run it’s 
a bit different. I just need to learn about it a study about it more.

“Dathan made it very hard, I had to hang on for my dear life. It was amazing 
to have so many people cheering for me. Down the hill, I remember in this race 
against Bekele and Haile Gebrselassie, when Bekele just went boom and opened up 
a gap I couldn’t close. So I tried to do the same to Dathan, make a gap and 
then hold it.”

Ritzenhein said: “When he took off down the downhill there was no catching 
him. Within 10-15 metres he was gone. I felt I would break my leg if I went any 
faster. I have no doubt in 2020 he will be contending for the marathon.”

While Farah was ending an impressive year in fine style, his wife, Tania, was 
competing in the mass participation event along with 57,000 others.

Asked about his celebration as he approached the finish, Farah said: “For 
Shearer, Alan Shearer, he’s a legend. I wanted to give something back to the 
crowd. They love Shearer here. The crowd come right out in front of you.”

In the women’s race, the Olympic 5,000m champion Vivian Cheruiyot made her 
half-marathon debut and clocked 1:07.54 to win by a second from Priscah Jeptoo, 
also of Kenya.

Cheruiyot said: “I’m so happy because it’s my birthday. I was nervous, when I 
was on the line at the start I thought: ‘Am I going to finish?’ You never know 
what is going to happen but it was so good. I am very happy. Priscah is a 
strong lady, I was fighting all the way.”

Farah also praised Claire Lomas, who finished the race at 10am on Sunday after 
starting it on Wednesday morning. Lomas, from Leicestershire, was paralysed 
from the chest down in a riding accident in 2007 and Farah described her as an 
inspiration.

He said: “It’s pretty amazing. What she went through and then to finish the 
Great North Run. I want to congratulate her, this is what the Great North Run 
needs. To have the courage to be able to compete is amazing.”

Lomas said: “It’s such a relief. There were times this week when I didn’t 
think I would make it.”
