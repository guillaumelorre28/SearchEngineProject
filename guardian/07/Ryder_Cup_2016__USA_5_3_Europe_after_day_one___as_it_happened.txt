The last word to Rory McIlroy. “I lost myself around the middle there. 
Thankfully I’ve redeemed myself. Thomas has been incredible all day. He’s a 
stud!” Back here tomorrow lunchtime for day two, then? After the incredible 
rollercoaster ride we’ve all been on today? Of course we’ll all be back here! 
Look forward to seeing you then, and sweet dreams, whichever side of the 
Atlantic your heart resides.

United States of America 5-3 Europe

Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch. The gallery giving their man all the support they can 
muster. Pieters wedges his third to 15 feet, though he’s not the main 
consideration right now. Kuchar’s got a racy downhill 35-footer for his eagle. 
He dribbles it rather majestically to a couple of feet, making sure of his 
birdie and throwing the gauntlet down to McIlroy. If Rory makes his eagle putt, 
he wins the match for Europe. Pieters tries to knock in his birdie putt for 
insurance, but that’s just a par. So here we go, then, a slippery downhill one 
for the point. And it’s never going anywhere but in! Rory was snoozing for much 
of that back nine, but look how he came to life: an eagle to seal a 3&2 
victory! He pointedly takes a theatrical bow to all four corners of Hazeltine, 
then shouts EFFING COME ON, or something like it, before chest bumping his 
partner with some feeling. Pieters being the best part of a foot taller than 
McIlroy, he nearly knocks Europe’s star turn over, and looks back sheepishly to 
check he hasn’t done exactly that. Don’t worry, Thomas, it’s fine. Everyone’s 
fine. Europe have dug themselves out of a massive hole here, and you’ve been a 
big part of it this afternoon. Rory McIlroy, though!

Kuchar finds the front apron of the par-five 16th in two. With Pieters having 
driven behind a tree on the right, taking his medicine and chipping out, the 
pressure’s really on Rory. And so, from 225 yards, he skelps a gorgeous long 
iron pin high to 15 feet for eagle! So in turn, the pressure has now been 
shuttled onto Dustin, and he buckles, pulling his approach into the drink front 
left. He blames a mud ball, but the match-play moxie of McIlroy was surely to 
blame for that aberration. All of a sudden, Matt Kuchar has it all to do.

United States of America 5-2 Europe

A couple of heavy-handed chips from the side of 16 by Moore and Holmes. And 
all of a sudden, the second match will be all over unless Moore can make it a 
hat-trick of improbable rakes with the flat stick. This is from the apron, 18 
feet from the flag. He can’t make it, the ball drifting away to the right, all 
those heroics for naught. A deserved win for Europe, though, with Cabrera Bello 
particularly impressive on debut. He strutted onto the course with purpose, and 
instantly looked like he belonged. What an attitude! It was an attitude Europe 
desperately required, too. He’s done his bit. Over to Rory and Thomas Pieters 
to ensure it wasn’t wasted energy.

This could turn into a bit of a nerve-nipper. Because back on 15, McIlroy, 
Pieters, Kuchar and Johnson all find the dancefloor in regulation. The 
Americans are closer, though. McIlroy can’t steer a downhill left-to-right 
15-foot curler home. He’ll have to make do with par, which leaves it all down 
to Pieters. Again. And he’s not able to make his ten-footer, the ball sliding 
off to the right, a lack of pace the problem. Kuchar has a chance to knock in a 
birdie putt from a similar position, but leaves his up on the left! So it’s 
down to Dustin from three feet. And he only just squeaks it in, a very nervous 
dribbler that catches the left edge of the cup. But it still counts, doesn’t 
it. And now Dustin and Kuch can legitimately consider the completion of an 
astonishing comeback!

If Europe fail to close out both of these matches, they may as well turn it in 
and go home.It’d be the ultimate sickener: dragging themselves back into 
contention after a nightmare start, only to let it slip with some loose stuff 
towards the end of the day. McIlroy appears to have been shaken from his 
lethargy, and has blistered one hell of a drive down the track at 15. Sergio 
meanwhile dices with the water front left of the green at 16, but his approach 
just makes it over. With Moore in the rough to the right of the green, and 
Holmes forced to chip out from behind a tree, Europe are in pole position here. 
But they’ve been in pole position on the last two holes, only for Moore to do 
something wild. Let’s see how this pans out, then.

Holmes and Moore both miss the fairway at 16. The Spanish duo both find it. 
Advantage Europe, though it’ll be the American who are still flying. Ryan 
Moore, though! Meanwhile Pieters can’t get up and down from the side of 14, and 
he won’t be rescuing McIlroy this time. The senior man needs to step up here; 
Pieters has already been let down by Westwood, and the last two holes simply 
haven’t been good enough by McIlroy in terms of support during these 
high-pressure circumstances.

They’ll expect to close it. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they will! Rory’s 
lost his concentration a wee bit, and his drive at 14 is flown up against the 
out-of-bounds fence down the left. The onus is on Pieters again, and he’s just 
flown his second down into thick cabbage down the side of the green. Meanwhile 
what about Ryan Moore? How about this! He really is nuclear resistant. Rory 
McIlroy had to throw several kitchen sinks plus assorted shaker-style cupboards 
at him to win the Tour Championship last week. Now on 15, Cabrera Bello has hit 
his second pin high to ten feet. Moore is just off the back, but he rakes in a 
huge left-to-right 40-foot curler for birdie! His second huge putt in a row, 
and the Americans, who looked dead and buried, aren’t out of this yet!

United States of America 5-1 Europe

It’s long been coming: Snedeker and Koepka wrap up their easy, easy 5&4 
victory over a very limp Kaymer and Willett pairing. The rookie Koepka was 
impressive; Snedeker was simply brilliant with four hole-winning birdies this 
afternoon. The USA take a four-point lead again, though Europe will expect to 
close that gap pretty soon.

Kuchar isn’t close at all. He’s normally so fine at lagging up from distance, 
but bundles his monster effort a good ten feet past the hole. Dustin’s up next, 
and he dribbles a fine downhill 40-footer across the green, three feet past the 
cup. Pieters is last up, and he’s half the distance inside Dustin, along a 
similar line. There’s a left-to-right break, and he reads it perfectly! In it 
drops, albeit at quite the rattle! McIlroy, the four-time major winner with 
three Ryder Cups already under his belt, dumped his ball in the water - and the 
rookie wins the hole anyway! Rory lets rip a big COME ON! because the young 
ice-cool Belgian sure as hell isn’t going to. Pieters has been brilliant this 
afternoon. A bronze centime for the thoughts of on-course general Lee Westwood 
right now.

Snedeker and Koepka are dormie five over Kaymer and Willett. Kaymer missed a 
left-to-right curler to win 13, before Snedeker tucked away a missable 
six-footer to halve the hole. Meanwhile the second match isn’t quite over yet! 
Moore drains a 35-footer across 14 for his birdie, Garcia can’t knock in his 
own 20-footer, and suddenly the American deficit is cut to three. They 
couldn’t, could they? Well, maybe, because there’s a sense that a tide is 
gently turning: McIlroy’s tee shot at 13 is wet. It’s the rookie Pieters versus 
Dustin and Kuch, though the European is closest to the pin. Europe would run 
like the clappers with the half, if you offered it them right now.

Moore and Garcia halve the 13th in par. Snedeker and Kaymer share the spoils 
from 12 in par. Then coming behind, two chances for Europe to win at 12; 
Pieters sees his 15-footer teeter on the edge of the cup but refuse to fall, 
then McIlroy lets Johnson and Kuchar off the hook.

United States of America 4-1 Europe

Reed’s putt looks straight, and he hits it straight, but it slips across to 
the left. No birdie. That leaves the Europeans with two chances to make their 
own birdie and win the match. Stenson first: his 18-footer is never dropping. 
Can Rose make it? Yes he can! The hole snaffles a briskly hit ball, it’s a 
birdie, and a fine 5&4 win. Henrik Stenson was particularly impressive there. 
And so nine hours and a couple of minutes after the big tee off, Europe have 
their first point on the board!

Spieth and Reed are playing very loosely now. Spieth’s drive down the right of 
14 sits on the edge of a bunker. He’s got to stand in the trap to play his 
second, and a flyer through the green is the result. Reed is in sand down the 
other side, though he settles himself to whistle his second pin high, leaving a 
20-footer for his birdie. Stenson and Rose are in the middle of the fairway. 
Stenson’s approach is a bit average from where he is, but Rose clips his to ten 
feet. Reed really needs to make that putt. Meanwhile could there be a chink of 
light for America in the final match? Dustin Johnson nips his third to a couple 
of feet, and after an interminable period of faffing around, as the other three 
try to make long putts to ease/apply pressure, the big man taps in for his 
birdie. That’s one of the four holes clawed back, and after scrambling a 
precious half on the previous hole, the Big Man has woken from his slumber, and 
possibly planted a seed or two of doubt in European minds!

Stenson knocks in his birdie putt to turn up the pressure on Spieth. This 
really is a must for the US pair. But he leaves it on the left lip. That’s a 
dismal effort. This morning’s pace-setting heroes are in a lot of trouble now. 
On 12, Garcia gently steers in a tricky downhill eight-footer to save his par 
and halve the hole.

Rose whips his tee shot at the par-three 13th onto the hill guarding a bunker 
at the front left. It bounces off the knoll and springs pin high, eight feet 
away. That’s a fine tee shot, spiced with a little fortune. Stenson however is 
half the distance inside, landing his ball softly to the left of the cup. Then 
Spieth nearly holes in one, though his ball rolls six feet past! And finally 
Reed, who has gotten a bit loose over the last couple of holes, plonks his in 
the bunker. What a crucial shoot-out this is going to be! Meanwhile back on 11, 
Snedeker’s big hitting earns the US yet another hole in the third match. Kaymer 
has contributed absolutely nothing this afternoon; Willett, one huge rake 
across the 9th the outlier, next to nothing. The rookie Pieters is the only 
European captain’s pick to justify his selection so far.

Reed has avoided the water on 12 after sending his ball clattering through the 
trees.He sends his third pin high, leaving a 15-footer for par. Rose finds the 
front apron in two, then duffs his pitch, Martin Kaymer style. The crowd very 
much enjoyed that. He’s not making his long par putt. With Spieth having got 
wet, this is now between Stenson - who sent his second into the heart of the 
green, 20 feet from the flag - and Reed. Stenson up first: he lags it up for 
his par. Reed needs to make his for a grand, and frankly improbable, escape. 
It’s not dropping. Europe are three ahead with six to play. Meanwhile Holmes 
and Moore halve the par-five 11th in birdie four. And McIlroy - remember him, 
in all this bedlam? - wedges from 100 yards to a couple of feet. Brilliant. But 
though he’ll tap in for his birdie, he’ll not win the hole: Dustin rolls in a 
20-footer to deny him. What a crucial putt, keeping the States in with a shout.

On 10, another birdie for Snedeker, popping one in from 12 feet; he restores 
Team USA’s lead in that match to four holes. Danny Willett’s monster on the 
previous hole an exercise in futility. On 11, Holmes, Moore, Garcia and Cabrera 
Bello take turns to pepper the flag. And up on 12, Spieth and Reed both flay 
wild Mickelsonesque drives into the woods down the right. Spieth is in sand, 
snookered by a tree, and he hoicks his second into the water. He was being 
heckled by one of his own fans before taking that shot; he had to step out of 
his stance a couple of times, then tell everyone to pipe down. A few cold 
drinks taken, perhaps. Reed meanwhile plays bagatelle with the trees he’s 
behind. Nobody knows where that one went yet. And these boys have been put on 
the clock again! A lot of high jinks down this hole. Rose and Stenson are in 
the centre of the fairway, incidentally. But where’s the fun in that?

Sheer brilliance from Jordan Spieth! He’s just off the front of the long 
par-five 11th in two huge strokes, and then bumps a chip across the big green 
to four feet. That was such a delightful touch, and it puts the Europeans under 
a bit of pressure. Rose, in a tuft of rough front left, replies with an equally 
wonderful pitch to a similar distance! Spieth is up first, and he makes his 
birdie. Pressure on Rose. Stenson, on a similar line but miles outside, goes 
first. He misses, but Rose goes to school on it and knocks in his birdie. A 
half, and Europe remain two up. Back on 9, Dustin has a 20-foot chance to grab 
back a hole, but doesn’t give his effort enough juice. McIlroy and Pieters 
reach the turn four holes to the good. An out-of-sorts Matt Kuchar stays behind 
to tidy up a putt of no consequence, in order to try to relocate some touch, as 
he’s entitled to do. He misses from three feet.

Garcia’s in a spot of bother off the tee at 10, behind a tree down the left. 
He simply takes out his wedge and whips his ball over his woody foe, landing it 
softly on the green, eight feet from the pin. Moore sets up a birdie effort of 
his own from 12 feet, and guides the left-to-right curler into the cup, never 
missing. It puts awful pressure on Sergio, but he gently prods it along a 
similar line and into the hole. He cups his ear in the panto style, eliciting a 
few comedic boos from the gallery. A huge smile plays across his face. Europe 
remain four up, though Moore will be happy enough with the way that panned out 
too. Meanwhile Willett drains a monster on 9! It scampered into the hole like a 
mouse with a big chunk of cheese, having made a 50-foot skitter across the 
green. It spooks Koepka, who had guided a lovely second pin high to eight feet. 
He doesn’t give it enough, and it dies off to the left. The Americans are now 
only three up as they reach the turn.Only three up!

Pieters looks ice cool. Emotionless. He didn’t celebrate wildly when he made 
any of his three birdies so far this afternoon; he doesn’t flinch when a chance 
slips by on 8. Kuchar has a birdie opportunity of his own from ten feet, but 
can’t make Pieters pay for his miss. He and Big Dustin remain four down. Three 
of these matches are heading for blowouts. But have the levels of tension been 
reduced in any meaningful way? Nope! That’s because the Ryder Cup is theRyder 
Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup>, and anything could happen yet.

Scrub that about Stenson: he’s kissed his ball off the top of the fluffy sand 
down the left of 10 to eight feet. That’s sensational from where he was! 
Especially as Spieth, from the middle of the fairway, can only send his ball 
into the heart of the green, 25 feet from the hole. Rose clips his to ten feet. 
Reed is out of it. Spieth’s putt never looks like dropping, so the Europeans 
have two birdie chances to win the hole. But they can’t make either of them. 
That’s let Spieth and Reed off the hook; a missed opportunity for Europe. 
Elsewhere, Koepka tidies up on 8 to move America four holes up in the third 
match, while Sergio chips in from the rough surrounding 9 to put Europe in a 
similarly strong position in the second!

Brooks Koepka is enjoying some debut. Three up in his game through the first 
seven holes, he’s just caressed his tee shot at the par-three 8th to a couple 
of feet. This match could run away from Europe quite soon. But on the flip 
side, at 7, here’s another birdie for Pieters, who is getting into thisRyder Cup
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> business now he’s no longer 
carrying the dead weight of Westwood. Up on 10, a big break for Justin Rose, 
whose drive looks to be heading left, takes a massive bounce off a hillock, and 
kicks back onto the fairway, scampering miles down the hill. He’ll have a wedge 
coming in, as will Jordan Spieth. Those two might be on their own, as Stenson 
has driven into sand, while Reed is away on a nature ramble down the left.

Moore has a 20-foot curler from right to left on the par-three 8th. Both 
Europeans having missed the green with their tee shots, this is for the hole. 
It’s an inch away from dropping. He squats on his haunches in despair. They 
remain three holes adrift. Snedeker and Willett halve the 7th in par. Spieth 
and Stenson both miss makeable 12-footers on 9; that hole’s halved in 
widespread frustration. Meanwhile here’s Simon McMahon, suggesting fans of 
Europe shouldn’t get ahead of themselves regarding this afternoon’s slight 
upturn in fortune. “Two points for Europe tonight will at least guarantee that 
the match cannot be decided before Sunday’s singles. Small steps, eh?”

Back in the final match of the afternoon, McIlroy splashes out from a bunker 
at the par-five 6th. His ball lands eight feet from the flag, and he rolls the 
putt straight into the cup. That’s three holes on the bounce for the Europeans, 
who would snatch your hand off if you offered to turn these in-progress matches 
into results. The next couple of hours are going to be oh-so-crucial. I’m 
already struggling for fingernails and we’re only two-thirds of the way through 
the opening day! It’s hard being a sports fan, huh.

A couple of pleasant surprises here, one for each team. Snedeker drains a 
biggie on 6 to put Kaymer and Willett, who can’t get anything going at all, in 
a spot of bother; the USA are three up in that match. But on 7, Cabrera Bello 
continues to enjoy himself immensely; he takes his drop, finds the green in 
three, and drains a 20-footer for par. That puts pressure on Moore’s birdie 
putt, and Europe somehow escape with a half!

Reed is one inch away from rolling in a 25-footer from the apron! Such a 
brilliant putt, so unfortunate for the USA pair. It’s down to Spieth, then; 
he’s got a 35-foot right-to-left downhill putt across the green. If this goes 
in, expect the huge, 20-deep gallery lining the hole to go wild. And it nearly 
does, but the big breaker stops just short. Both lads so close to snatching the 
hole from Stenson; a joule here or there, and Europe would have suffered a 
sickener. But Stenson gets his reward for nearly holing in one.

Henrik Stenson is the width of his Titleist away from a hole in one! A beauty 
at 8, which lands a couple of feet in front of the hole, takes a little 
soft-shoe shuffle, and nearly gently drops into the cup. That’s a gimme, so one 
of Spieth or Reed will have to birdie if they’re not to fall two holes behind. 
Neither go close. Just a sense that the young American duo are getting a tad 
frustrated, which is understandable given their brilliant fast start was 
checked by some gritty European play. Still, one big putt to make birdie here, 
and the momentum may well shift again.

Yes, there’s an awful long way to go all right! McIlroy birdies 5 to move 
Europe two holes clear of the big-name Dustin/Kuchar pairing, but on 7, Sergio 
finds water down the right with his tee shot, while Cabrera-Bello gets wet on 
the other side of the hole! Farcical scenes, and you would think that second 
match will be tightening up pretty soon.

A brilliant birdie for Cabrera Bello on 6! He’s taken to this Ryder Cup 
malarkey all right. Europe are three up in the second match. Up on 7, the 
glacial opening match continues, er, apace. Reed tickles his birdie putt down 
the green, and watches in horror as it shaves the lip. Then Spieth’s effort 
from the apron lips out. That allows Stenson to tuck his birdie putt away, and 
even though his partner thinned one into the drink, Europe have won the hole. 
And they’re now up in three matches. This is exactly what the visitors need to 
get back into thisRyder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup>, but 
my oh my, there’s an awful long way to go this afternoon - an afternoon that 
could go an awful long way to deciding the narrative of this competition.

A six-footer on 5 for Willett to win the hole. He gives the putt too much 
juice, and it lips out, allowing Snedeker to knock in from a very similar 
distance for the half. Meanwhile the opening match is just coming up 7. At this 
rate, they’ll take nearly six hours if they play all 18 holes. That is beyond 
ridiculous, no wonder these lads were on the clock this morning. You’d think 
they’ll be on it again soon if they don’t pick their legs up. But it’s not as 
though they’re not supplying us with wonderful entertainment. Spieth and Reed 
both wedge their second shots to 15, maybe 18 feet. Rose then thins his 
straight through the green and into the lake. Finally Stenson, now on his own, 
screeches his approach to six feet. Anything could happen here.

Spieth shanks his approach to 6! Off it whistles, straight towards the gallery 
on the right. You don’t see that too often in the pro game, less so from a 
stellar talent like two-time major-winning Jordan. But in fourballs, it’s all 
about making sure you have your partner’s back, and Reed wedges pin high to set 
himself up with a birdie chance from eight feet. The European duo are in a 
little bit of bother, but from the fringe, Stenson rattles in a fairly straight 
20-footer for his birdie, and suddenly the pressure’s on Reed instead! But this 
brilliant young man isn’t the sort to buckle, and he eases in his birdie to 
ensure the hole is halved. He had Spieth’s back all right there. Rose, 
meanwhile, will be slapping Stenson’s. Great match play. Meanwhile on 4, 
Pieters - who didn’t do half as much wrong this morning as Lee Westwood - rolls 
in a 20-footer across 4 to give Europe the lead in that final match!

Now it’s Dustin Johnson’s turn to set himself up with an eagle effort on 3. 
He’s a turn away from making his 30-foot effort, but birdie will have to do. 
It’s not enough to win the hole, though, as Rory gets up and down from a deep 
bunker at the front of the green for birdie of his own. Another good up and 
down from sand, by Danny Willett at 4, from a tricky downhill lie and without 
much green to play with, saves a half for Europe. They’re hanging on by their 
fingernails there. Meanwhile Sergio wedges his second at 5 stone dead, a shot 
worthy of winning any hole. Moore can’t get up and down from a bank to the 
left, and the Spaniards are two up.

Moore can’t make his birdie from the back of 4. Sergio should pop his away, a 
gentle left-to-right slider from six feet, but he leaves it out on the left. 
That’s very poor, and a chance to put a little pressure on an inexperienced US 
duo goes by. Two big booms by Brooks Koepka on the long par-five 3rd sets up an 
eagle effort. He can’t quite make it, but the birdie is enough to win the hole 
anyway. Meanwhile on 5, Stenson owes Rose one; he sends a misjudged second shot 
straight over the green, leaving Rose to battle Spieth and Reed alone. Spieth 
knocks in a ten-footer for birdie, but Rose makes one of similar distance to 
momentarily silence a very happy gallery, and walks off wearing one of the 
rarely spotted European Smiles. This is some very entertaining golf.

Another chance for the USA to level things up in the second match; another 
chance spurned.This time it’s Holmes who misses a very makeable putt, from five 
feet at 3, and the Spanish duo of Garcia and Cabrera Bello remain in the lead. 
Sergio turns the screw by creaming his tee shot at the following hole pin high, 
to six feet. Moore skelps his 12 feet past the flag, keeping things 
competitive. Speaking of which, the hosts battle back in the final match of the 
afternoon, Rory missing an uphill 12-footer for his birdie, bellowing an 
unambiguous “FUCK!”, and watching in horror as Dustin drains a much snakier one 
across the green for bird. They’re level again. This is magnificent fun, and if 
nothing else, it’s clear that Europe haven’t given up the ghost quite yet.

To the par-three 4th, where Reed sends his tee shot sailing into sand on the 
left, and the other three leave themselves monster putts across the ridge 
running through the green. Only Stenson can get his second stroke anywhere 
close, lagging up from 40 feet close enough for his putt to be conceded. Can 
either Reed or Spieth save the day for the States? Reed, on the downslope in 
the sand and shortsided, could only splash out to 25 feet. He’s close to 
teasing in his left-to-right breaker, but it stays out on the high side. 
Spieth’s slippery downhill 10-footer, the result of a misjudged monster putt, 
slips by the right, having looked for all the world that it would drop. They’re 
all square; Rose and Stenson have done marvellous things in negating the young 
American duo’s fast start.

On the opening hole, McIlroy lands his approach ten feet past the flag, but 
generates such a preposterous amount of backspin, his ball nearly falls off the 
front of a very large green. Pieters wedges to 15 feet, keeping Europe in the 
mix for the hole. He’s left with an uphill putt; Kuchar has one of similar 
distance coming down the green. Kuchar’s up first, but can’t make it, and sends 
his putt nine feet past. McIlroy lags up, Pieters sees a brave birdie effort 
horseshoe out, then finally Kuchar misses his par putt. With Dustin out of 
contention as a result of that errant drive - though he nearly redeemed himself 
by sinking a long par saver - Europe win that in par. Meanwhile up on 2, 
Snedeker sends his second to four feet, and that match is all square again.

Another birdie putt for Cabrera Bello, who sent his approach at 2 over the 
flag to 12 feet.But he gives it way too much out to the right. That gives Moore 
a chance to win the hole from eight feet, but he lets his birdie effort dribble 
apologetically away to the right, and Europe remain one up. Up on 3, Reed makes 
the USA’s third birdie in three holes, but they’re only one up for their 
efforts, because Rose splashes from the sand to a couple of feet and tidies up 
for a birdie of his own. This is relentless!

The last word to Rory McIlroy. “I lost myself around the middle there. 
Thankfully I’ve redeemed myself. Thomas has been incredible all day. He’s a 
stud!” Back here tomorrow lunchtime for day two, then? After the incredible 
rollercoaster ride we’ve all been on today? Of course we’ll all be back here! 
Look forward to seeing you then, and sweet dreams, whichever side of the 
Atlantic your heart resides.

Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch. The gallery giving their man all the support they can 
muster. Pieters wedges his third to 15 feet, though he’s not the main 
consideration right now. Kuchar’s got a racy downhill 35-footer for his eagle. 
He dribbles it rather majestically to a couple of feet, making sure of his 
birdie and throwing the gauntlet down to McIlroy. If Rory makes his eagle putt, 
he wins the match for Europe. Pieters tries to knock in his birdie putt for 
insurance, but that’s just a par. So here we go, then, a slippery downhill one 
for the point. And it’s never going anywhere but in! Rory was snoozing for much 
of that back nine, but look how he came to life: an eagle to seal a 3&2 
victory! He pointedly takes a theatrical bow to all four corners of Hazeltine, 
then shouts EFFING COME ON, or something like it, before chest bumping his 
partner with some feeling. Pieters being the best part of a foot taller than 
McIlroy, he nearly knocks Europe’s star turn over, and looks back sheepishly to 
check he hasn’t done exactly that. Don’t worry, Thomas, it’s fine. Everyone’s 
fine. Europe have dug themselves out of a massive hole here, and you’ve been a 
big part of it this afternoon. Rory McIlroy, though!

D Johnson/Kuchar v McIlroy/Pieters 3&2 (F)
 
Kuchar finds the front apron of the par-five 16th in two. With Pieters having 
driven behind a tree on the right, taking his medicine and chipping out, the 
pressure’s really on Rory. And so, from 225 yards, he skelps a gorgeous long 
iron pin high to 15 feet for eagle! So in turn, the pressure has now been 
shuttled onto Dustin, and he buckles, pulling his approach into the drink front 
left. He blames a mud ball, but the match-play moxie of McIlroy was surely to 
blame for that aberration. All of a sudden, Matt Kuchar has it all to do.

A couple of heavy-handed chips from the side of 16 by Moore and Holmes. And 
all of a sudden, the second match will be all over unless Moore can make it a 
hat-trick of improbable rakes with the flat stick. This is from the apron, 18 
feet from the flag. He can’t make it, the ball drifting away to the right, all 
those heroics for naught. A deserved win for Europe, though, with Cabrera Bello 
particularly impressive on debut. He strutted onto the course with purpose, and 
instantly looked like he belonged. What an attitude! It was an attitude Europe 
desperately required, too. He’s done his bit. Over to Rory and Thomas Pieters 
to ensure it wasn’t wasted energy.

This could turn into a bit of a nerve-nipper. Because back on 15, McIlroy, 
Pieters, Kuchar and Johnson all find the dancefloor in regulation. The 
Americans are closer, though. McIlroy can’t steer a downhill left-to-right 
15-foot curler home. He’ll have to make do with par, which leaves it all down 
to Pieters. Again. And he’s not able to make his ten-footer, the ball sliding 
off to the right, a lack of pace the problem. Kuchar has a chance to knock in a 
birdie putt from a similar position, but leaves his up on the left! So it’s 
down to Dustin from three feet. And he only just squeaks it in, a very nervous 
dribbler that catches the left edge of the cup. But it still counts, doesn’t 
it. And now Dustin and Kuch can legitimately consider the completion of an 
astonishing comeback!

If Europe fail to close out both of these matches, they may as well turn it in 
and go home.It’d be the ultimate sickener: dragging themselves back into 
contention after a nightmare start, only to let it slip with some loose stuff 
towards the end of the day. McIlroy appears to have been shaken from his 
lethargy, and has blistered one hell of a drive down the track at 15. Sergio 
meanwhile dices with the water front left of the green at 16, but his approach 
just makes it over. With Moore in the rough to the right of the green, and 
Holmes forced to chip out from behind a tree, Europe are in pole position here. 
But they’ve been in pole position on the last two holes, only for Moore to do 
something wild. Let’s see how this pans out, then.


Holmes/Moore v Garcia/Cabrera Bello 2UP (15)
D Johnson/Kuchar v McIlroy/Pieters 3UP (14)
 
Holmes and Moore both miss the fairway at 16. The Spanish duo both find it. 
Advantage Europe, though it’ll be the American who are still flying. Ryan 
Moore, though! Meanwhile Pieters can’t get up and down from the side of 14, and 
he won’t be rescuing McIlroy this time. The senior man needs to step up here; 
Pieters has already been let down by Westwood, and the last two holes simply 
haven’t been good enough by McIlroy in terms of support during these 
high-pressure circumstances.

Holmes/Moore v Garcia/Cabrera Bello 2UP (15)
D Johnson/Kuchar v McIlroy/Pieters 3UP (14)
 
They’ll expect to close it. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they will! Rory’s 
lost his concentration a wee bit, and his drive at 14 is flown up against the 
out-of-bounds fence down the left. The onus is on Pieters again, and he’s just 
flown his second down into thick cabbage down the side of the green. Meanwhile 
what about Ryan Moore? How about this! He really is nuclear resistant. Rory 
McIlroy had to throw several kitchen sinks plus assorted shaker-style cupboards 
at him to win the Tour Championship last week. Now on 15, Cabrera Bello has hit 
his second pin high to ten feet. Moore is just off the back, but he rakes in a 
huge left-to-right 40-foot curler for birdie! His second huge putt in a row, 
and the Americans, who looked dead and buried, aren’t out of this yet!

It’s long been coming: Snedeker and Koepka wrap up their easy, easy 5&4 
victory over a very limp Kaymer and Willett pairing. The rookie Koepka was 
impressive; Snedeker was simply brilliant with four hole-winning birdies this 
afternoon. The USA take a four-point lead again, though Europe will expect to 
close that gap pretty soon.

Kuchar isn’t close at all. He’s normally so fine at lagging up from distance, 
but bundles his monster effort a good ten feet past the hole. Dustin’s up next, 
and he dribbles a fine downhill 40-footer across the green, three feet past the 
cup. Pieters is last up, and he’s half the distance inside Dustin, along a 
similar line. There’s a left-to-right break, and he reads it perfectly! In it 
drops, albeit at quite the rattle! McIlroy, the four-time major winner with 
three Ryder Cups already under his belt, dumped his ball in the water - and the 
rookie wins the hole anyway! Rory lets rip a big COME ON! because the young 
ice-cool Belgian sure as hell isn’t going to. Pieters has been brilliant this 
afternoon. A bronze centime for the thoughts of on-course general Lee Westwood 
right now.

Snedeker and Koepka are dormie five over Kaymer and Willett. Kaymer missed a 
left-to-right curler to win 13, before Snedeker tucked away a missable 
six-footer to halve the hole. Meanwhile the second match isn’t quite over yet! 
Moore drains a 35-footer across 14 for his birdie, Garcia can’t knock in his 
own 20-footer, and suddenly the American deficit is cut to three. They 
couldn’t, could they? Well, maybe, because there’s a sense that a tide is 
gently turning: McIlroy’s tee shot at 13 is wet. It’s the rookie Pieters versus 
Dustin and Kuch, though the European is closest to the pin. Europe would run 
like the clappers with the half, if you offered it them right now.

Moore and Garcia halve the 13th in par. Snedeker and Kaymer share the spoils 
from 12 in par. Then coming behind, two chances for Europe to win at 12; 
Pieters sees his 15-footer teeter on the edge of the cup but refuse to fall, 
then McIlroy lets Johnson and Kuchar off the hook.

Reed’s putt looks straight, and he hits it straight, but it slips across to 
the left. No birdie. That leaves the Europeans with two chances to make their 
own birdie and win the match. Stenson first: his 18-footer is never dropping. 
Can Rose make it? Yes he can! The hole snaffles a briskly hit ball, it’s a 
birdie, and a fine 5&4 win. Henrik Stenson was particularly impressive there. 
And so nine hours and a couple of minutes after the big tee off, Europe have 
their first point on the board!
 
Spieth and Reed are playing very loosely now. Spieth’s drive down the right of 
14 sits on the edge of a bunker. He’s got to stand in the trap to play his 
second, and a flyer through the green is the result. Reed is in sand down the 
other side, though he settles himself to whistle his second pin high, leaving a 
20-footer for his birdie. Stenson and Rose are in the middle of the fairway. 
Stenson’s approach is a bit average from where he is, but Rose clips his to ten 
feet. Reed really needs to make that putt. Meanwhile could there be a chink of 
light for America in the final match? Dustin Johnson nips his third to a couple 
of feet, and after an interminable period of faffing around, as the other three 
try to make long putts to ease/apply pressure, the big man taps in for his 
birdie. That’s one of the four holes clawed back, and after scrambling a 
precious half on the previous hole, the Big Man has woken from his slumber, and 
possibly planted a seed or two of doubt in European minds!

Stenson knocks in his birdie putt to turn up the pressure on Spieth. This 
really is a must for the US pair. But he leaves it on the left lip. That’s a 
dismal effort. This morning’s pace-setting heroes are in a lot of trouble now. 
On 12, Garcia gently steers in a tricky downhill eight-footer to save his par 
and halve the hole.

Rose whips his tee shot at the par-three 13th onto the hill guarding a bunker 
at the front left. It bounces off the knoll and springs pin high, eight feet 
away. That’s a fine tee shot, spiced with a little fortune. Stenson however is 
half the distance inside, landing his ball softly to the left of the cup. Then 
Spieth nearly holes in one, though his ball rolls six feet past! And finally 
Reed, who has gotten a bit loose over the last couple of holes, plonks his in 
the bunker. What a crucial shoot-out this is going to be! Meanwhile back on 11, 
Snedeker’s big hitting earns the US yet another hole in the third match. Kaymer 
has contributed absolutely nothing this afternoon; Willett, one huge rake 
across the 9th the outlier, next to nothing. The rookie Pieters is the only 
European captain’s pick to justify his selection so far.

Reed has avoided the water on 12 after sending his ball clattering through the 
trees.He sends his third pin high, leaving a 15-footer for par. Rose finds the 
front apron in two, then duffs his pitch, Martin Kaymer style. The crowd very 
much enjoyed that. He’s not making his long par putt. With Spieth having got 
wet, this is now between Stenson - who sent his second into the heart of the 
green, 20 feet from the flag - and Reed. Stenson up first: he lags it up for 
his par. Reed needs to make his for a grand, and frankly improbable, escape. 
It’s not dropping. Europe are three ahead with six to play. Meanwhile Holmes 
and Moore halve the par-five 11th in birdie four. And McIlroy - remember him, 
in all this bedlam? - wedges from 100 yards to a couple of feet. Brilliant. But 
though he’ll tap in for his birdie, he’ll not win the hole: Dustin rolls in a 
20-footer to deny him. What a crucial putt, keeping the States in with a shout.

On 10, another birdie for Snedeker, popping one in from 12 feet; he restores 
Team USA’s lead in that match to four holes. Danny Willett’s monster on the 
previous hole an exercise in futility. On 11, Holmes, Moore, Garcia and Cabrera 
Bello take turns to pepper the flag. And up on 12, Spieth and Reed both flay 
wild Mickelsonesque drives into the woods down the right. Spieth is in sand, 
snookered by a tree, and he hoicks his second into the water. He was being 
heckled by one of his own fans before taking that shot; he had to step out of 
his stance a couple of times, then tell everyone to pipe down. A few cold 
drinks taken, perhaps. Reed meanwhile plays bagatelle with the trees he’s 
behind. Nobody knows where that one went yet. And these boys have been put on 
the clock again! A lot of high jinks down this hole. Rose and Stenson are in 
the centre of the fairway, incidentally. But where’s the fun in that?

Sheer brilliance from Jordan Spieth! He’s just off the front of the long 
par-five 11th in two huge strokes, and then bumps a chip across the big green 
to four feet. That was such a delightful touch, and it puts the Europeans under 
a bit of pressure. Rose, in a tuft of rough front left, replies with an equally 
wonderful pitch to a similar distance! Spieth is up first, and he makes his 
birdie. Pressure on Rose. Stenson, on a similar line but miles outside, goes 
first. He misses, but Rose goes to school on it and knocks in his birdie. A 
half, and Europe remain two up. Back on 9, Dustin has a 20-foot chance to grab 
back a hole, but doesn’t give his effort enough juice. McIlroy and Pieters 
reach the turn four holes to the good. An out-of-sorts Matt Kuchar stays behind 
to tidy up a putt of no consequence, in order to try to relocate some touch, as 
he’s entitled to do. He misses from three feet.

Garcia’s in a spot of bother off the tee at 10, behind a tree down the left. 
He simply takes out his wedge and whips his ball over his woody foe, landing it 
softly on the green, eight feet from the pin. Moore sets up a birdie effort of 
his own from 12 feet, and guides the left-to-right curler into the cup, never 
missing. It puts awful pressure on Sergio, but he gently prods it along a 
similar line and into the hole. He cups his ear in the panto style, eliciting a 
few comedic boos from the gallery. A huge smile plays across his face. Europe 
remain four up, though Moore will be happy enough with the way that panned out 
too. Meanwhile Willett drains a monster on 9! It scampered into the hole like a 
mouse with a big chunk of cheese, having made a 50-foot skitter across the 
green. It spooks Koepka, who had guided a lovely second pin high to eight feet. 
He doesn’t give it enough, and it dies off to the left. The Americans are now 
only three up as they reach the turn.Only three up!

Pieters looks ice cool. Emotionless. He didn’t celebrate wildly when he made 
any of his three birdies so far this afternoon; he doesn’t flinch when a chance 
slips by on 8. Kuchar has a birdie opportunity of his own from ten feet, but 
can’t make Pieters pay for his miss. He and Big Dustin remain four down. Three 
of these matches are heading for blowouts. But have the levels of tension been 
reduced in any meaningful way? Nope! That’s because the Ryder Cup is theRyder 
Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup>, and anything could happen yet.

Scrub that about Stenson: he’s kissed his ball off the top of the fluffy sand 
down the left of 10 to eight feet. That’s sensational from where he was! 
Especially as Spieth, from the middle of the fairway, can only send his ball 
into the heart of the green, 25 feet from the hole. Rose clips his to ten feet. 
Reed is out of it. Spieth’s putt never looks like dropping, so the Europeans 
have two birdie chances to win the hole. But they can’t make either of them. 
That’s let Spieth and Reed off the hook; a missed opportunity for Europe. 
Elsewhere, Koepka tidies up on 8 to move America four holes up in the third 
match, while Sergio chips in from the rough surrounding 9 to put Europe in a 
similarly strong position in the second!

Brooks Koepka is enjoying some debut. Three up in his game through the first 
seven holes, he’s just caressed his tee shot at the par-three 8th to a couple 
of feet. This match could run away from Europe quite soon. But on the flip 
side, at 7, here’s another birdie for Pieters, who is getting into thisRyder Cup
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> business now he’s no longer 
carrying the dead weight of Westwood. Up on 10, a big break for Justin Rose, 
whose drive looks to be heading left, takes a massive bounce off a hillock, and 
kicks back onto the fairway, scampering miles down the hill. He’ll have a wedge 
coming in, as will Jordan Spieth. Those two might be on their own, as Stenson 
has driven into sand, while Reed is away on a nature ramble down the left.

Moore has a 20-foot curler from right to left on the par-three 8th. Both 
Europeans having missed the green with their tee shots, this is for the hole. 
It’s an inch away from dropping. He squats on his haunches in despair. They 
remain three holes adrift. Snedeker and Willett halve the 7th in par. Spieth 
and Stenson both miss makeable 12-footers on 9; that hole’s halved in 
widespread frustration. Meanwhile here’s Simon McMahon, suggesting fans of 
Europe shouldn’t get ahead of themselves regarding this afternoon’s slight 
upturn in fortune. “Two points for Europe tonight will at least guarantee that 
the match cannot be decided before Sunday’s singles. Small steps, eh?”

Back in the final match of the afternoon, McIlroy splashes out from a bunker 
at the par-five 6th. His ball lands eight feet from the flag, and he rolls the 
putt straight into the cup. That’s three holes on the bounce for the Europeans, 
who would snatch your hand off if you offered to turn these in-progress matches 
into results. The next couple of hours are going to be oh-so-crucial. I’m 
already struggling for fingernails and we’re only two-thirds of the way through 
the opening day! It’s hard being a sports fan, huh.

A couple of pleasant surprises here, one for each team. Snedeker drains a 
biggie on 6 to put Kaymer and Willett, who can’t get anything going at all, in 
a spot of bother; the USA are three up in that match. But on 7, Cabrera Bello 
continues to enjoy himself immensely; he takes his drop, finds the green in 
three, and drains a 20-footer for par. That puts pressure on Moore’s birdie 
putt, and Europe somehow escape with a half!

Reed is one inch away from rolling in a 25-footer from the apron! Such a 
brilliant putt, so unfortunate for the USA pair. It’s down to Spieth, then; 
he’s got a 35-foot right-to-left downhill putt across the green. If this goes 
in, expect the huge, 20-deep gallery lining the hole to go wild. And it nearly 
does, but the big breaker stops just short. Both lads so close to snatching the 
hole from Stenson; a joule here or there, and Europe would have suffered a 
sickener. But Stenson gets his reward for nearly holing in one.
 
Henrik Stenson is the width of his Titleist away from a hole in one! A beauty 
at 8, which lands a couple of feet in front of the hole, takes a little 
soft-shoe shuffle, and nearly gently drops into the cup. That’s a gimme, so one 
of Spieth or Reed will have to birdie if they’re not to fall two holes behind. 
Neither go close. Just a sense that the young American duo are getting a tad 
frustrated, which is understandable given their brilliant fast start was 
checked by some gritty European play. Still, one big putt to make birdie here, 
and the momentum may well shift again.
 
Yes, there’s an awful long way to go all right! McIlroy birdies 5 to move 
Europe two holes clear of the big-name Dustin/Kuchar pairing, but on 7, Sergio 
finds water down the right with his tee shot, while Cabrera-Bello gets wet on 
the other side of the hole! Farcical scenes, and you would think that second 
match will be tightening up pretty soon.

A brilliant birdie for Cabrera Bello on 6! He’s taken to this Ryder Cup 
malarkey all right. Europe are three up in the second match. Up on 7, the 
glacial opening match continues, er, apace. Reed tickles his birdie putt down 
the green, and watches in horror as it shaves the lip. Then Spieth’s effort 
from the apron lips out. That allows Stenson to tuck his birdie putt away, and 
even though his partner thinned one into the drink, Europe have won the hole. 
And they’re now up in three matches. This is exactly what the visitors need to 
get back into thisRyder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup>, but 
my oh my, there’s an awful long way to go this afternoon - an afternoon that 
could go an awful long way to deciding the narrative of this competition.

A six-footer on 5 for Willett to win the hole. He gives the putt too much 
juice, and it lips out, allowing Snedeker to knock in from a very similar 
distance for the half. Meanwhile the opening match is just coming up 7. At this 
rate, they’ll take nearly six hours if they play all 18 holes. That is beyond 
ridiculous, no wonder these lads were on the clock this morning. You’d think 
they’ll be on it again soon if they don’t pick their legs up. But it’s not as 
though they’re not supplying us with wonderful entertainment. Spieth and Reed 
both wedge their second shots to 15, maybe 18 feet. Rose then thins his 
straight through the green and into the lake. Finally Stenson, now on his own, 
screeches his approach to six feet. Anything could happen here.
 
Spieth shanks his approach to 6! Off it whistles, straight towards the gallery 
on the right. You don’t see that too often in the pro game, less so from a 
stellar talent like two-time major-winning Jordan. But in fourballs, it’s all 
about making sure you have your partner’s back, and Reed wedges pin high to set 
himself up with a birdie chance from eight feet. The European duo are in a 
little bit of bother, but from the fringe, Stenson rattles in a fairly straight 
20-footer for his birdie, and suddenly the pressure’s on Reed instead! But this 
brilliant young man isn’t the sort to buckle, and he eases in his birdie to 
ensure the hole is halved. He had Spieth’s back all right there. Rose, 
meanwhile, will be slapping Stenson’s. Great match play. Meanwhile on 4, 
Pieters - who didn’t do half as much wrong this morning as Lee Westwood - rolls 
in a 20-footer across 4 to give Europe the lead in that final match!

Now it’s Dustin Johnson’s turn to set himself up with an eagle effort on 3. 
He’s a turn away from making his 30-foot effort, but birdie will have to do. 
It’s not enough to win the hole, though, as Rory gets up and down from a deep 
bunker at the front of the green for birdie of his own. Another good up and 
down from sand, by Danny Willett at 4, from a tricky downhill lie and without 
much green to play with, saves a half for Europe. They’re hanging on by their 
fingernails there. Meanwhile Sergio wedges his second at 5 stone dead, a shot 
worthy of winning any hole. Moore can’t get up and down from a bank to the 
left, and the Spaniards are two up.

Moore can’t make his birdie from the back of 4. Sergio should pop his away, a 
gentle left-to-right slider from six feet, but he leaves it out on the left. 
That’s very poor, and a chance to put a little pressure on an inexperienced US 
duo goes by. Two big booms by Brooks Koepka on the long par-five 3rd sets up an 
eagle effort. He can’t quite make it, but the birdie is enough to win the hole 
anyway. Meanwhile on 5, Stenson owes Rose one; he sends a misjudged second shot 
straight over the green, leaving Rose to battle Spieth and Reed alone. Spieth 
knocks in a ten-footer for birdie, but Rose makes one of similar distance to 
momentarily silence a very happy gallery, and walks off wearing one of the 
rarely spotted European Smiles. This is some very entertaining golf.

Another chance for the USA to level things up in the second match; another 
chance spurned.This time it’s Holmes who misses a very makeable putt, from five 
feet at 3, and the Spanish duo of Garcia and Cabrera Bello remain in the lead. 
Sergio turns the screw by creaming his tee shot at the following hole pin high, 
to six feet. Moore skelps his 12 feet past the flag, keeping things 
competitive. Speaking of which, the hosts battle back in the final match of the 
afternoon, Rory missing an uphill 12-footer for his birdie, bellowing an 
unambiguous “FUCK!”, and watching in horror as Dustin drains a much snakier one 
across the green for bird. They’re level again. This is magnificent fun, and if 
nothing else, it’s clear that Europe haven’t given up the ghost quite yet.

To the par-three 4th, where Reed sends his tee shot sailing into sand on the 
left, and the other three leave themselves monster putts across the ridge 
running through the green. Only Stenson can get his second stroke anywhere 
close, lagging up from 40 feet close enough for his putt to be conceded. Can 
either Reed or Spieth save the day for the States? Reed, on the downslope in 
the sand and shortsided, could only splash out to 25 feet. He’s close to 
teasing in his left-to-right breaker, but it stays out on the high side. 
Spieth’s slippery downhill 10-footer, the result of a misjudged monster putt, 
slips by the right, having looked for all the world that it would drop. They’re 
all square; Rose and Stenson have done marvellous things in negating the young 
American duo’s fast start.

On the opening hole, McIlroy lands his approach ten feet past the flag, but 
generates such a preposterous amount of backspin, his ball nearly falls off the 
front of a very large green. Pieters wedges to 15 feet, keeping Europe in the 
mix for the hole. He’s left with an uphill putt; Kuchar has one of similar 
distance coming down the green. Kuchar’s up first, but can’t make it, and sends 
his putt nine feet past. McIlroy lags up, Pieters sees a brave birdie effort 
horseshoe out, then finally Kuchar misses his par putt. With Dustin out of 
contention as a result of that errant drive - though he nearly redeemed himself 
by sinking a long par saver - Europe win that in par. Meanwhile up on 2, 
Snedeker sends his second to four feet, and that match is all square again.

Another birdie putt for Cabrera Bello, who sent his approach at 2 over the 
flag to 12 feet.But he gives it way too much out to the right. That gives Moore 
a chance to win the hole from eight feet, but he lets his birdie effort dribble 
apologetically away to the right, and Europe remain one up. Up on 3, Reed makes 
the USA’s third birdie in three holes, but they’re only one up for their 
efforts, because Rose splashes from the sand to a couple of feet and tidies up 
for a birdie of his own. This is relentless!
