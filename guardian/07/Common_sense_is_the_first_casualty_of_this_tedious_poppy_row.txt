So the ridiculous Poppygate saga has come to a conclusion. Of sorts. The 
English and Scottish football associations have declared they will bravely defy 
Fifa andtheir players will wear black armbands with poppies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/02/england-players-to-defy-fifa-ruling-and-wear-poppies-in-armistice-day-match>
 printed on them when they meet on Armistice Day. As they should, if they wish.

But has the gulf between the silliness of the debate and the seriousness of 
the cause ever been quite so wide?

If the whole point of Remembrance Day is one of quiet individual 
contemplation, the act of choosing to pay tribute to unimaginable horror and 
sacrifice in an understatedly personal way, then this unseemly episode seemed 
the opposite. Lurid tabloid outrage? Check. Cynical political point scoring? 
That too.

A nagging feeling that the contrast between the manufactured controversy and 
the act of remembrance threatens to undermine the entire point? Yes.

When England <https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> drew with Sweden 
in a forgettable 1-1 draw in a friendly at Old Trafford in 2001, on the day 
before Armistice Day, there were no armbands and no poppies. Nor was there any 
outrage.

Similarly the last time England played on 11 November itself – a tremendous 
4-1 victory against Yugoslavia in Belgrade in 1987 with goals from Peter 
Beardsley, John Barnes, Bryan Robson and Tony Adams – none of the players 
sported armbands or poppies.

This is a very modern phenomenon. On the one hand a morally bankrupt, 
scandal-hit Fifa lecturing its members over a non-issue.

On the other an FA that has portentously taken to the barricades amid an 
outpouring of social-media outrage and tabloid pressure.

It had basically assumed the precedent set in 2011 – the last time we had this 
row – would hold and that England’s players would be allowed to wear armbands 
with printed poppies, only to find that Fifa’s new hierarchy had apparently
decided on another interpretation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/02/theresa-may-attacks-fifa-over-utterly-outrageous-poppy-ban-remembrance-day>
.

World football’s discredited governing body adopted its usual haughty tone, 
right down to the warning over political interference that is uses as a big 
stick when appropriate but tends to be hastily dropped when it comes to Russia 
or China.

And yet the intervention of the prime minister, Theresa May, earlier in the 
day also left a sour taste. Spying a PR open goal, she told parliament that 
Fifa’s stance was “utterly outrageous” and ordered it to get its own house in 
order before lecturing others.

Fifa’s poppy ban criticised by Theresa May

That stance would have more credence if her predecessor had not bowed and 
scraped to Fifa, calling the BBC “unpatriotic” in the process forbroadcasting a 
critical documentary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/29/panorama-fifa-world-cup-bribes>
, in an effort to secure the 2018 World Cup.

By a coincidence of the calendar Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura, the 
secretary-general, and other Fifa officials were in London night before 
meetings of the International FA boards that set the game’s global laws – the 
very rules Fifa says the English and Scottish FAs will be breaking when they 
sport their poppy armbands.

As usual common sense has been the first casualty of this tedious row. If both 
teams agree and two home nations happen to be playing on Armistice Day then it 
is hard to see who would be offended by them wearing armbands with poppies on.

For all that there is justifiable concern about the increasing militarisation 
of the trappings that often surround international sport, if England happen to 
be playingScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland> on Armistice 
Day there seems little wrong with marking it.

Surely the bar should be that both teams agree. The FA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa> does not believe that the poppy is a 
political symbol, nor that it is worn to mark a specific single historical 
event, nor even to commemorate the dead of a particular country. Yet it would 
also be equally appropriate to mark the occasion with a minute’s silence.

To be fair to the FA it reasonably assumed it would be able to follow the 2011 
precedent and quietly wrote to Fifa several weeks ago to inform it of those 
intentions, long before the current tabloid storm and Fifa’s obstinate 
resistance.

The subsequent waste of energy and frothing fulmination does not reflect 
particularly well on any of those involved and it is hard not to conclude that 
silent contemplation should have remained the default state.
