Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have 
finally completed the signing of John Stones from Everton, paying an initial 
£47.5m to make the 22-year-old the second most expensive defender in history 
after David Luiz.

The conclusion to a transfer saga that has been running all summer was, in 
effect, leaked by Uefa on Tuesday morning when itpublished the squad City had 
submitted for next week’s Champions League qualifying round game

The Everton centre-half’s name was not only on the list; he had even been 
given 24 as a shirt number.Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> appeared to have been caught on 
the hop, as by that time Stones was already in Manchester and City were able to 
confirm the signing a couple of hours later.

The England international, who was wanted by José Mourinho at Chelsea this 
time last year,has signed a six-year deal

 and, though Everton put up a fight to keep him last summer, they have long 
been resigned to the inevitable and can at least console themselves with an 
enormous profit on a player David Moyes signed from Barnsley three years ago 
for a fee in the region of £3m.

A sell-on clause means that Barnsley will get between £7m and £9m from 
the deal.

Everton initially said they wanted £50m for the player, the sum PSG paid 
Chelsea for David Luiz in 2014, and succeeded in getting very close to their 
valuation. They are now expected to complete the signing of Ashley Williams 
from Swansea and are also pursuing an interest in Sunderland’s Lamine Koné.

Everton are also hoping to add Yannick Bolasie to their squad from Crystal 
Palace. A deal has been agreed in principle for the wideman although Everton 
will not meet Palace’s £30m valuation. If Palace accept an Everton offer of 
£25m, a deal could be in place by the weekend, subject to the player passing a 
medical.

 and, in terms of high-profile signings with immediate first-team prospects, 
the first defender. “I am absolutely delighted to sign for City and now the 
deal is done I’m looking forward to the next stage in my career,” he said.

“I’ve obviously seen what’s going on at the Etihad. It’s an ambitious club 
with a great manager so I can’t wait to get stuck in and help them achieve 
their goals.

“I know it will be tough getting a place in this team, but I’m determined to 
become the best player I can be and help us to success. I had a wonderful time 
at Everton and I wish them and their fans all the best but now I’ll give my all 
for City.”

 John Stones speaks after move to Manchester City 
Pep Guardiola said he was pleased to complete the deal, having been keen to 
sign a ball-playing centre-back.

“We want to help John show his quality with us and improve on what he has 
already achieved,” the City manager said. “I like the way he plays the game and 
I’m looking forward to welcoming him into the squad.”

Swansea sources say a fee of around £11m has been agreed with Everton for 
Williams, who has passed a medical.
