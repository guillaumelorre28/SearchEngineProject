Clown


Nothing about this Halloween is going to plan. First, one of the most popular 
costumes is basically an ageing My Chemical Romance fan (Suicide Squad’s Harley 
Quinn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/03/super-stylewatch-harley-quinn-enchantress-and-wonder-woman>
) and an online troll (the guy from V for Vendetta slash Jack White inGet 
Behind Me Satan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Behind_Me_Satan>-era White 
Stripes). Second, the innocent tradition of dressing up like a clown has taken 
a turn for theJohn Carpenter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/musicblog/2015/feb/02/john-carpenter-im-just-this-old-school-person>
 thanks to the recentcreepy clown phenomenon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/creepy-clown-sightings-craze-speads-britain>
. Forget Ronald McDonald and Michael Jackson in full makeup and a strange wig – 
now there’s a sinister side to the proceedings. Who would have thunk it?

Eleven


In a babydoll dress, a platinum-blond wig and a bleeding nose, you’re 
basically Courtney Love in all herMiss World 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS1Ckczz0LQ>-era glory. Add some knee-high 
socks, a blue jacket and some waffles, though, and you will turn into Eleven 
fromStranger Things 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/15/stranger-things-review-a-shot-of-80s-nostalgia-right-to-your-heart-winona-ryder>
, 2016’s television breakout star (soz,Blac Chyna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/12/rob-chyna-saddest-show-tv-kardashians>
). The Eleven costume is also much better than tedious Halloween stalwarts: 
sexy witch, sexy cat, sexy mermaid. Just make sure that the Victoriana dress 
isn’t too steampunk or you will come off as a sexy Eleven, and that’s just 
wrong.

Prince


There are many eras of Prince 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/22/prince-how-his-androgynous-style-influenced-fashion>
 to choose from.Dirty Mind <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Mind> era 
(trench coat and bikini briefs) and theUnder the Cherry Moon <http:> era (John 
Waters moustache and caballero hat) are just two of the most beloved, but the 
most Halloweened will be hisPurple Rain look 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/02/prince-purple-rain-shirt-auction>
: purple trench, a ruffle shirt and lots of chest hair. The science is inexact, 
though, and there’s a danger you will look as if you’re participating in a 
Fraggle Rock cosplay if you don’t proceed with tonal and stylistic caution.

Rattata


If Pokémon Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/jul/14/pokemon-go-style-from-guccis-seadra-to-vetements-pikachu-catch-em-all>
 is about catching ’em all, it is especially about catching the rarities – 
Pikachu, Squirtle, Gyarados. But, for Halloween, it’s all about the route-one 
lol, so best to go for the commonRattata 
<http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/rattata> (3.5kg in weight, 0.3m in height, 
fact fans). The purple, fanged rodent is everywhere in the game, mirroring the 
rat-infested urban environment where most of its players reside. By going as a 
Rattata at Halloween, you’re making a statement about how we live now, and 
nodding to the real-lifepizza rat <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU> 
that became a YouTube star. Sidenote: this is a purple option that provides an 
alternative to Prince.

Beyoncé in Hold Up <https://youtu.be/PeonBmeFR8o?t=1m51s>


Sure, paid-up members of the Bey Hive might go for the fur coat and sports bra 
ofDon’t Hurt Yourself <https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1SxUdcZPuTU/hqdefault.jpg> or the 
classic Knowles work with leotard and boots forSorry 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxsmWxxouIM> (accessorised with the most 
decorated tennis player of all time,Serena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams>). But the first track on 
Lemonade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/02/beyonce-has-embraced-fashion-and-its-made-her-more-relatable>
, Hold Up, is the one that has the most real-person-appropriate outfit to ape 
for Halloween. Find yourself a mustard-yellow, frilly, floor-length dress, some 
platforms and a baseball bat and you’re golden. Arrive in a monster truck for 
bonus points.

Donald Trump


Ah, Donald. While the US elections 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016> will still be eight 
days away on Halloween, this news-cycle-worthy costume choice is sure to be 
popular. And, political allegiances aside, it is an easy choice for a 
straight-from-the-office situation. Add a wispy blonde wig and a red tie to 
your suit for instant recognition from anyone who has even glanced at the news 
over the past few weeks. Appropriate facial expressions will help your Trump 
trump the other Trumps at the party. Keep your mouth pursed at all times, as if 
ready to let rip with an ill-advised statement any minute.
