The Stories of MR James
Olivia Laing

A large portion of my childhood was spent in the car, driving between my 
parents’ houses. To enliven these journeys, my father bought a sizeable 
collection of story tapes. As a consequence, my sister and I knowThree Men in a 
Boat and The Wind in the Willows almost by heart. But the one we listened to 
most often didn’t involve benign picnics by the Thames.The Stories of MR James, 
read by Michael Hordern, was about a different kind of England: misty, haunted, 
malevolent.

James was a medievalist and provost of King’s College, Cambridge. His stories 
are populated by dons and curates, people who potter into country churches and 
take tea in their rooms after games of golf. After acquiring an object – a bone 
whistle, perhaps, or a painting that has caught their fancy at a county auction 
– they become subject to disquieting phenomena: small, unpleasant disturbances 
in the fabric of reality.

To this day, I still find it hard to read “Casting the Runes”, in which Mr 
Edward Dunning, engaged in research at the British Museum, is cursed by Mr 
Karswell, a petulant occultist from Warwickshire. The haunting proceeds 
incrementally, delicately, deliciously, building towards a night of horror. The 
lights go out in Mr Dunning’s house. When he slips his hand under the pillow to 
check the time, he encounters not his own familiar watch, but “a mouth, with 
teeth, and with hair about it, and, he declares, not the mouth of a human 
being”.

It’s this tenebrous quality, this paralysing vagueness, that makes James’s 
stories so lingeringly disturbing. He understood that the half-glimpsed thing 
is far more frightening than anything encountered in full light. The writhing 
sheets in “Oh, Whistle, and I’ll Come to You, My Lad”; the moving figure that 
emerges from a print of a country house in “The Mezzotint”: these slippery, 
malevolent objects have the capacity to unnerve me still.

Listening to the tape while driving at dusk through Hampshire, 
Buckinghamshire, the marsh country of Essex, it was easy to feel that James had 
found a way to tap the strangeness of the English countryside, with its 
crumbling houses, its blighted ash trees and deserted beaches. Even now, in a 
different millennium, that odd, uncanny power still abides, both in the land 
and in the stories that came out of it.

Crowhaven Farm
Michel Faber


The earliest thing that scared the bejesus out of me was intended to put Jesus 
into me. It was a Christian motivational film screened at my local church in 
Boronia, Australia, circa 1969. I must’ve been about nine and let me tell you, 
nine-year-old boys are not hot on allegory. In this movie, Jesus Christ was a 
clown. A Ronald McDonald-style clown, in a carnival. Clowns and carnivals are 
creepy as hell for a start, but the concept of this film (its title, unlike its 
imagery, did not get branded on my brain) was that the clown was compelled to 
take on the suffering of everyone else in the circus. So, in the act where the 
magician saws the lady in half, Pierrot Jesus takes her place, whereupon his 
mute paroxysms of pain indicate that he’s getting cut for real. In another 
scene, he’s in a barrel, contorted with agony as somebody thrusts a sword 
through slits in the wood. I’ve blanked out the rest, but I have an inkling 
that the climax involved a fatal fall from the trapeze. Jeez! The things we 
inflict on innocent children …

I’m not actually that easy to scare. Horror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/horror> movies in which monsters pursue 
hyperventilating victims to rip out their entrails don’t faze me. I rate the 
special effects on a scale of 1 to 10, assigning 8½ to commendably exuberant 
eruptions of innards. But there’s one horror movie which has haunted me for 
more than four decades:Crowhaven Farm. I’m just one of a worldwide coterie of 
people who were enduringly spooked by this obscure made-for-TV flick when they 
chanced upon it in the early 1970s. Meeting a fellowCrowhaven Farm survivor is 
a deeply affirming experience. So it got you, too?

By modern standards, the film is tame. No eyeballs are punctured, no skulls 
explode. An unhappily married couple move to an isolated farm in Massachusetts. 
The plot unfolds in a succession of low-key, unsettling events. The neighbours 
are friendly and welcoming and (of course) have been waiting for this couple 
since the 1600s. By the time the wife is out in a field, pinioned under a large 
wooden plank while her Puritan neighbours pile rocks on top, the awareness 
dawns that you will never get over how creeped out you are at this moment.

 Three Oncologists by Ken Currie Photograph: Scottish National Portrait Gallery 
Three Oncologists by Ken Currie
Kathleen Jamie

In traditional Scotland, Halloween 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/halloween> or Samhain was the Celtic 
festival when this world and the otherworld were at their closest; the boundary 
between could be crossed. A sinister time. It was possible to foretell the 
future. The dead could walk.

It seems to me that Ken Currie’s eerie and brilliant portrait Three Oncologists
 occupies this very Celtic space. It’s an official portrait, commissioned in 
2002 by the National Galleries of Scotland. The three men depicted (it would 
have to be three, like the weird sisters) are Professor RJ Steele, Professor 
Sir Alfred Cuschieri and Professor Sir David P Lane, all then of the department 
of surgery and molecular oncology at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee.

It’s a portrait, but far from flattering. Nowhere are the pomp and curly wigs 
of earlier portraits of surgeons and physicians. Currie’s painting reaches back 
into another cultural tradition. The three men are lit with a ghoulish inner 
light; they seem to be haunting the threshold between life and death. They are 
shown poised to move through a curtain, which is the black cloth of the 
theatre, the operating theatre, the veil between worlds. This curtain appears 
also to radiate from the figures, like an aura or ectoplasm. Like mediums, they 
can move back and forth into that place which is for most of us, an otherworld.

Furthermore, they hold their tools or means: Steele raises his gloved and 
bloodstained hands, Cuschieri holds a surgeon’s implement, Lane carries a 
paper. Whose sentence is written there?

Currie's three men are lit with a ghoulish inner light; they seem to be 
haunting the threshold between life and death
Kathleen Jamie 
Though it was painted in 2002, I believe the chill of this work lingers from 
the 19th century, when the medical colleges procured bodies to dissect without 
asking enough questions, when that demand was satisfied by body-snatching and 
even murder, as in those committed in Edinburgh by Burke and Hare. The surgery 
and science that saves us today is built on these misdeeds – Currie’s painting 
seems to acknowledge that horror. The medics themselves are pallid, 
corpse-like, but human, all look hunched, raddled, interrupted in their task. 
Are they slightly guilty? Is what they are doing transgressive? “Spooky” is not 
the word; there is a greater fear here, that of the unseen patient.

As we grow more able to say the word “cancer” out loud and more of us survive 
it, thanks in no small part to our surgeons and physicians, this painting will 
become a historical record of an emotional state, as well as honouring three 
esteemed medics. But it will still send a shiver down the spine.

The Simpsons Halloween special
Mark Lawson

Now as fixed a part of the schedules as the Queen’s Christmas broadcast, 
television’s most sustained and impressive Halloween project is theTreehouse of 
Horror series of annual episodes of The Simpsons, which reached its 26th 
instalment this month. Fittingly, these shows are both a treat (the only 
individual episode each season that viewers can anticipate) and a trick, 
incorporating narrative or graphic experiments and occurring outside the 
regular storyline.

For me, the most memorable remains the first Treehouse from 1990, in which 
Lisa reads “The Raven” as a rather inappropriate bedtime story, with the 
yellow-faced family becoming caught up in the action of Edgar Allan Poe’s 
horror monologue. The sequence shows to perfection the series’ multi-layering 
of references.

Although the series posts semi-jokey warnings about these stories being 
unsuitable for younger viewers, the terror factor is limited by the time slot 
and genre. In the same way,Doctor Who – for which a traditional viewing 
position has been behind the sofa – is frightening mainly because its target 
audience has a low nightmare threshold.

Among television shows intended to make adults jump, I have a fondness for 
Rainy Day Women, an intelligently unsettling 1984 BBC Play for Today by David 
Pirie, in which hysteria develops in an English village fearing a German 
invasion in 1940. The BBC’sGhostwatch, a Stephen Volk play taking the form of a 
purportedly live broadcast from a haunted house, was so effectively terrifying 
that it has never been repeated in Britain, although it is available on DVD for 
brave home entertainers, as isThe Stone Tape, another BBC play in which 
research scientists regret basing their facility in a Victorian building with a 
history. It was one of the finest achievements of Nigel Kneale, the greatest 
writer of small-screen frighteners, to whom a modern admirer, Mark Gatiss, paid 
tribute in the 2013 BBC production ofThe Tractate Middoth, a truly spooky 
contemporary ghost story.

 Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491 
Mozart’s C Minor Piano Concerto K491
Tom Service

Of course Mussorgsky’s Night on the Bare Mountain is self-consciously spooky 
with its evocation of a witches’ sabbath and its cauldron of dissonances, as 
are the final couple of movements of Berlioz’sSymphonie Fantastique, when the 
hero dreams of his own execution and another lot of witches consign him to a 
hallucinogenic oblivion. And then there are the modernist masterpieces that 
Stanley Kubrick turned into a definitive soundtrack of spookiness inThe Shining 
and2001: pieces by Penderecki, Ligeti and Bartók that are now the sonic 
embodiments of deep-space eeriness and elevator doors deluged by blood.

All of the above might seem scary, but they’re frightening in the way that 
Halloween costumes are superficially frightening. True musical terror, those 
chills that come from a cold sweat that’s created by the drama of the work 
itself, is a different matter. And that’s why the final movement of Mozart’sC 
Minor Piano Concerto K491is a piece that makes my blood run cold. It’s a set of 
variations on a tenebrous theme – what terrors could that possibly hold? Well: 
this winding, chromatic melody has ice in its veins, in the way it snakes and 
sighs around itself, in the implacable way that it shuts out any possibility of 
a major-key resolution. The transformation of minor-key despair to major-key 
happiness was a stock-in-trade of late 18th-century musical convention, so that 
you could make sure that your listeners left laughing after visiting a place of 
emotional darkness. Mozart himself did just that in the D minor piano concerto 
that he wrote a year before this one, when minor-key torment becomes D major 
glory in its final bars.

But that’s not what happens here. Mozart’s variations create a kaleidoscope of 
musical and expressive darkness, and they have a suffocating cumulative power. 
The composer gives us an ironic sense of hope with a vision of startling 
major-key brightness in one of the variations – only to rip it away again. The 
piece ends with a triple-time dance to the abyss, in music that has always 
sounded to me like the fulfilment of a bleak prophecy, a curse from which there 
is no escape. It’s frightening in a way that speaks to your soul as much as to 
your senses, and as such, it’s properly, profoundly scary.

The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman
Joanna Briscoe

This 6,000-word story captures the substance of nightmares. An inspired 
bookseller, knowing my own dark and twisted imagination, strongly urged me to 
read it, and it instantly gripped and chilled me.

In the lightest of tones, a female narrator describes how she has been 
prescribed a rest cure for her “slight hysterical tendency” by her physician 
husband. He has rented an empty ancestral hall for the summer, where he insists 
that he and his wife sleep in an old nursery complete with bars on the windows 
and torn wallpaper. Forbidden to write for fear of over-stimulation, the 
narrator has little to do but watch the effects of the sun on the disquieting 
paper lining the room. She also writes.

As her tale becomes darker, much of the creepiness lies in that very buoyancy 
of tone, all exclamation marks and echoes of her husband’s supposedly caring 
instructions: “He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without 
special direction.” The claustrophobia thickens as she sees a sub-pattern begin 
to grow, trapping a woman’s figure in the paper. The wallpaper’s “colour is 
repellent, almost revolting: a smouldering unclean yellow, strangely faded by 
the slow-turning sunlight”. Its patterns go “waddling up and down in isolated 
columns of fatuity … a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.”

Published in 1892, “The Yellow Wallpaper” was astonishingly ahead of its time 
in sentiment and language, its phrases – “great slanting waves of optic horror” 
– often enjoyably modern in sound. It is open to so very many interpretations, 
and its refusal to provide an answer enhances its unsettling effect on the 
mind. Is the narrator insane? Is this a valid response to “kind” incarceration? 
Is Gilman writing of postnatal depression, or offering a comment on women’s 
general or medical oppression? Is it a tale of the paranormal? As one critic 
once put it: “It may be a ghost story. Worse yet, it may not.”

Like the patterns themselves, the meaning slips, blooms, plunges into 
uncertainty, looping and doubling back, the territory shifting until the story 
becomes almost sickeningly haunting.

 Clowning around … Reece Shearsmith in Psychoville Photograph: BBC 
Clowns
Robert Douglas-Fairhurst

I enjoy watching comedians clowning around, from Buster Keaton, deadpan under 
his pancake, to Ricky Gervais inThe Office, fingering his tie like someone 
auditioning for the lead in a new Laurel and Hardy film. But a real clown 
always sends a shiver down my spine. That white mask of a face. That painted-on 
rictus of a smile. My queasiness is mild compared to sufferers of 
“coulrophobia”, the pathological fear of clowns, but they still spook me. It’s 
hard to explain why. I certainly can’t remember any traumatic encounters with 
balloon animals as a child, and I’m not a big fan of horror stories like 
Stephen King’sIt, in which a group of children are hunted down by a 
sewer-dwelling monster in the form of a clown with a puff of blood-red hair.


A clown always sends a shiver down my spine, with that white mask of a face, 
that painted-on rictus of a smile
Robert Douglas-Fairhurst 
So why do they seem so alien and uncanny? Maybe it’s because they behave so 
oddly, like someone who has been given an instruction manual on how to be a 
human being but abandoned it halfway through. Maybe it’s the way they move, 
with that weird mixture of clumsiness and grace, creating a world where 
choreography meets chaos. Or maybe it’s just their unnerving silence, as they 
walk around with planks of wood and custard pies, giving the impression that, 
however chirpy they seem on the outside, much darker thoughts are bubbling away 
under the surface.

A couple of years ago, the BBC comedy drama Psychoville featured Reece 
Shearsmith as Mr Jelly, an embittered clown with a metal hook for a hand, whose 
red nose acted like a warning beacon to anyone foolish enough to mistake him 
for his great rival Mr Jolly. The world of books is full of equally menacing 
clowns. One of the stories in Dickens’sThe Pickwick Papers features a haggard 
alcoholic performer, whose “glassy eyes” contrast horribly with the “thick 
white paint with which the face was besmeared”. The narrator gives him a few 
shillings, and as he turns away hears “the roar of laughter which followed his 
first tumble on the stage”. A few days later he is dead. It’s a strange little 
story, and one that resonates far beyond the obvious warning about the dangers 
of drink. Looked at from another angle, it’s as if this sad figure has worked 
out what a clown is really for. He is a capering death’s head.

 Trailer for 13 Tzameti 
13 Tzameti
Anthony Quinn

I’ve only seen this film once, nearly 10 years ago, but I recall its 
insinuating mood of dread as if it were yesterday. The Georgian-born French 
director Géla Babluani’s low-budget debut sidles along for much of its length, 
then plunges us abruptly into a scenario that’s about as close to a waking 
nightmare as cinema gets. A young immigrant labourer steals the identity of his 
late employer and travels to Paris on a mysterious assignation, trailed by 
unnamed pursuers. It’s difficult to say what the young man thinks he’s getting 
into – there seems to be drugs and cash involved – but he ends up in a place he 
could never have imagined. It involves a contest in which strangers gamble on 
the outcome and yet it’s filmed in a matter-of-fact way that catches you 
off-guard. That’s part of its fascination: to have things that are unimaginable 
suddenly stare you coldly in the face, as black and real as a gun barrel. Shot 
in monochrome, the film nods to Jean-Pierre Melville’s fatalistic gangster 
noirs and to Kafka’s dreamlike fables of dislocation; maybe a pinch of Patricia 
Highsmith lingers too. But in the event13 outruns its influences. I can’t 
exactly remember how it ends, and it hardly matters – what survives in the 
memory is that horrific sense of entrapment, of knowing that your fate has come 
to meet you. I’ve never experienced anything quite like it, and I’m not sure 
I’d want to again.

The Listeners by Walter de la Mare
Helen Dunmore


A moonlit clearing in a dark forest; a deserted house; a traveller who comes 
to knock at the door and calls out “Is there anybody there?” The setting is 
eerie enough, but slowly a deeper and more disturbing strangeness settles. A 
bird flies up out of the turret and the sills are fringed with leaves. It is a 
long time since this was a place of human habitation, and yet the house seems 
to hold its breath as the traveller strikes upon the door. The sound does not 
echo into emptiness. The air is “stirred and shaken” by the knocking and the 
cry of the man who seeks entry, but no one responds. There is “only a host of 
phantom listeners” there. They possess the house. They have never left it, even 
though green things tangle at the windows and birds build their nests in empty 
rooms. Like the house, they wait and listen and do not answer “that voice from 
the world of men”.


At around the 15th line, gooseflesh rises on my arms. It always happens: it 
makes no difference that I know what’s coming, or that I’ve read the poem 
dozens of times. The presence of the listeners is so palpable that figures 
begin to take shape in the imagination. They are there, and not there. They are 
summoned up, but they will not answer.

Throughout the poem it is the traveller who acts and speaks, but the listeners 
who lie at the heart of the mystery. There are no stanza breaks: it is all one 
poem, wrapping itself around the reader like an incantation. Read it on 
Halloween, and see what comes.

The Listeners by Walter de la Mare
‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller, 
 Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses 
 Of the forest’s ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret, 
 Above the Traveller’s head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time; 
 ‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller; 
 No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes, 
 Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners 
 That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight 
 To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair, 
 That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken 
 By the lonely Traveller’s call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness, 
 Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf, 
 ’Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even 
 Louder, and lifted his head:—
‘Tell them I came, and no one answered, 
 That I kept my word,’ he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners, 
 Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house 
 From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup, 
 And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward, 
 When the plunging hoofs were gone.
