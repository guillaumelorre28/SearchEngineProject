The Zapata quote, which is often attributed to Che Guevara and was co-opted by 
Charlie Hebdo’s editor Charb before his death at the hands of terrorists 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11333250/Id-rather-die-standing-than-live-on-my-knees-Charlie-Hebdo-told-in-quotes.html>
, translates as: “I’d rather die standing than live on my knees.” It was 
tweeted by Ayer just over an hour after the first reviews for Suicide Squad 
were published. Ayer qualified his use of the quote in a second tweet.

Zapata quote is my way of saying I love the movie and believe in it. Made it 
for the fans. Best experience of my life. ❤️

Suicide Squad, which is released on Friday, has been called “ugly and boring” 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/suicide-squad-review>, “comic book 
pornography 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/02/suicide-squad-review-crushingly-puerile-comic-book-pornography/>
” and “a puzzlingly confused undertaking 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/suicide-squad-film-review-915825>” by 
critics. The poor critical response follows the bad reviews accrued by Warner 
Brothers’ last big superhero film,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice

The Telegraph’s Robbie Collin, who had issues with Suicide Squad’s treatment 
of its female characters, called it “crushingly puerile” in histwo-star review 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/02/suicide-squad-review-crushingly-puerile-comic-book-pornography/>
. Writing for the Hollywood Reporter Todd McCarthy questioned the choice of 
Ayer as director, saying he lacked the “darkly subversive cartoon style” needed 
to keep the film entertaining, while Richard Lawson,writing for Variety 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/suicide-squad-review>, said it was 
“ultimately too shoddy and forgettable to even register as revolting”. Lawson 
also highlighted the objectification of Margot Robbie’s character, Harley 
Quinn. Robbie is Vanity Fair’s cover star this month. The interview with her, 
in which writer Rich Cohen called the actor “sexy and composed even while 
naked, but only in character”, was slammed for its sexist portrayal of the 
actor and called “really weird” by Robbie.

Among the few critics coming to the squads’ rescue is the Guardian’s Peter 
Bradshaw, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/02/suicide-squad-review-dc-comics-will-smith-margot-robbie-jared-leto>
 who gave Ayer’s film three stars and praised the performances of Robbie and 
co-star Viola Davis. He’s been joined by a gang of 5,000 fans who have signed a 
Change.org petition to shut down Rotten Tomatoes. The petition, which is 
reacting to Suicide Squad’s 35% RT score, argues that the entertainment site 
deserves to be taken offline, because it “always give the DC extended-universe 
movies unjust bad reviews”. Rotten Tomatoes is a review aggregator that groups 
critic’s verdicts from other websites into an cumulative score.
