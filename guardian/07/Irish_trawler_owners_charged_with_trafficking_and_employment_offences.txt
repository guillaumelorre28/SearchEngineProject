Two Cork-based trawler owners were charged with offences under the Irish 
Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 
<http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/29/enacted/en/html> and Employment 
Permits Act <http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/16/enacted/en/html> at 
Cork district court on Wednesday.

Leonard Hyde, 62, of Crosshaven, County Cork and Pat O’Mahony, 50, of Kinsale, 
County Cork, were accused of trafficking and illegally employing Filipino 
fisherman Demie Omol.


The two men were charged with knowingly facilitating his entry in to Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> on 23 March 2015 while knowing, or 
having reasonable cause to believe, that he was an illegal immigrant. They were 
additionally charged with employing a non-Irish national in the state without 
the legally required work permit.

No pleas were entered at this initial stage, as is the practice in Ireland.

Hyde and O’Mahony, owners of the fishing vessel the Labardie Fisher, were 
remanded on bail and told by the judge, John King, to reappear before the court 
on 9 November.
