Mickelson smacks the sand, blasting his ball out and screeching it to a halt, 
four feet from the flag. What moxie that took, given a flyer would have sent it 
through the green and O/B at the back. Stenson’s is a little less tricky, and 
he can ease a little chip to three feet, no fuss. Mickelson taps in for his 
par, and that’s a brilliant 70 under these pressurised circumstances. Stenson 
then rolls his home for an even more impressive 68. The pair embrace warmly at 
the end of a stunning day of to-and-fro golf. It’s going to be some duel 
tomorrow! You’ll not want to miss a shot. See you tomorrow, for what could be a 
classic. A repeat of 1977 at Turnberry? Yes please!

Mickelson’s up first. He whip-cracks his long iron towards the front of the 
green, but it’s short and bounces off to the left as it lands, and finds the 
bunker front left. Lefty blows up, bollocking the snappers behind him, one of 
whom clicked a little too early. “That’s so shitty. I can’t believe that. I get 
you have to cover it, but why do you have to interfere with it?” He isfuming. 
Stenson connects a little better, getting his distance right, but his shot’s 
away to the left of the green. It’s not in a terrible spot, but not perfect. 
Mickelson gathers himself to smile again as he responds to the wild reception 
afforded to both players by the Troon faithful as they walk to the green. 
Imagine the tension, the atmosphere, this time tomorrow!

A couple of fine drives down the last. Stenson on the fairway down the right, 
Mickelson just a step or two off the same side in the semi-rough. Up on the 
green, Bradley nearly goes out of bounds at the back, but his ball stops just 
short of the clubhouse. He chips up to five feet, but his fragile confidence 
isn’t quite repaired yet. He misses the putt, and it’s a bogey that sets the 
seal on a disappointing 76. But Bradley hasn’t been anywhere near the business 
end of a major since the 2014 US Open, so one step at a time. He should still 
take heart from they way this week is going. He ends the day at -2. His partner 
Soren Kjeldsen meanwhile knocks in a 20-footer to save his par. That’s an 
equally deflating 75, and he’s -3.

Mickelson’s in the thick stuff, and he thins his chip a little, the ball 
flying 12 feet past the hole. Par’s an uphill struggle now. Stenson meanwhile 
might actually be 20 feet away, but what’s five feet between friends? He rolls 
it straight towards the cup, and it always looks like dropping! What a putt! 
What a time to drain one like that! And for the second time in four holes, it’s 
a two-shot swing in favour of Stenson, because Mickelson’s attempt to save par 
is always staying out on the left! Wow! The drama isrelentless!

This is simply wonderful entertainment, a joyous slugfest, mano-a-mano 
brilliance. And it’s not even the end of Saturday yet! Phil pushes his tee shot 
at 17 into rather thick awfulness to the left of the green, while Stenson finds 
the heart, Keegan Country, and he’ll get a good look at birdie from 15 feet! 
Every single shot already feels vital. Excited about tomorrow? Over-excited?
Ludicrously over-excited? Yep! Us too!

Stenson splashes out to six feet, a fine shot from the deep pot. But Mickelson 
turns up the pressure by curling in his right-to-left birdie putt, though he 
needed every bit of the cup as it toyed with lipping out. Stenson’s six-foot 
par putt suddenly looks twice the distance. But he knocks it in, nervelessly 
so. Mickelson takes a one-stroke lead at -12, though. Up on 17, Keegan Bradley 
hits a lovely tee shot pin high, and very nearly rolls in the 25-foot birdie 
chance. Par for Kjeldsen, too. And on 18, the defending champ Zach Johnson 
bogeys, and that’s a poor third-day 75. He’s -1, and won’t become the first man 
to retain the title since Padraig Harrington in 2008.

-12: Mickelson (16)

Stenson lashes his second out of the thick rough, taking his medicine and just 
advancing his ball up the fairway. No heroics. Mickelson, on the prime track, 
whips a long iron further up the hole. Mickelson has a 50 or 60 yard advantage 
coming into the green. Stenson first, then, and he pulls one into the bunker 
guarding the front left of the green. Then Lefty sends a wedge bouncing 
straight at the flag, stopping ten feet short. Yep, advantage Mickelson. 
Stenson will need a good up and down here.

A pair of hard-fought pars by Mickelson and Stenson at 15. Phew, that was a 
grind. Suddenly a sense of how important every single stroke is, given they’re 
five clear of Bill Haas, who has just wrapped up on 18 with par for a 69: he’s 
-6. It’s taken on the dynamic of a match-play grapple. A Nicklaus/Watson-style 
duel tomorrow? Yes please! Stenson pulls his drive at 16 into thick rough down 
the left, while Mickelson finds the fairway. Up ahead, Bradley pars while 
Kjeldsen slides one in from the fringe on the right to make a desperately 
needed birdie; they’re both -3.

-11: Mickelson (15), Stenson (15)
-6: Haas (F)
-5: Beef (F)

Andrew Johnston is so close to stroking in his birdie putt. He sends it 
serenely sailing across the 18th, but it stops a turn short. That’s a 70, and 
he’s -5 for the 2016 Open, only his second appearance in this famous old 
tournament. “Beeeeeeeeeeef!” The crowd love the man. He’s a star in the making 
all right. And he’s enjoying every minute. Smiles! Enjoyment! Fun! Hopefully 
Sergio, who went round with him in 73 and is -2 overall, has been taking notes. 
I miss fun-loving, risk-taking, swashbuckling Sergio. Can we have him back, 
please?

A staunch two putts from the back of 17, and Bill Haas has saved his par. He 
remains at -6. Keegan Bradley begins to go backwards again. Bogeys at 14 and 
15, and he slips down to -3. Andrew Johnston meanwhile creams his second into 
18 pin high, leaving himself a 15-foot look across the green for birdie. He 
walks up the last to a tumultuous reception, the sort of thing that by rights 
should only happen on Sunday afternoon, and to the prospective champion. Rich 
cries of “Beeeeeeeeeeeeeef!” pouring down from the grandstand like rich gravy.

There are many reasons Phil Mickelson is so popular. Here’s just one: he stops 
off on his way to the 14th tee to hand his birdie ball to a young lad, whose 
face cracks into disbelieving glee. It’s not much, but it means everything. 
Stenson bounces back from the blow at 13 by landing his tee shot six feet away, 
then rolling in the birdie putt. He’s not won a major yet, but that’s a 
champion’s response. Mickelson, who had found the centre of the green and 
lagged up, should tap in for his par, but hits the tiddler too hard and it lips 
out on the right. Mickelson spooked Stenson on the last; now the boot’s on the 
other foot. That’s another reason Lefty is so popular: he’s not perfect, a 
flawed hero.

A birdie putt sunk by Mickelson from the front of 13! That’s a spectacular 
25-footer that’s rattled Stenson, who misses a much simpler effort from 15 
feet. Mickelson leads by two! Haas curls one in from 15 feet on the par-five 
16th to reclaim sole ownership of third spot, though Beef might not mind too 
much, having hit his tee shot at 17 in front of a bunker front right, lobbed to 
ten feet, and drained the par saver! He’s holding on at -5. But another bogey 
for Kjeldsen, who has fallen to bits since missing that short par putt on the 
Postage Stamp. Bogeys at 13 and 14 have swatted him down the leaderboard as low 
as -2. “Sergio is so creative!” trills Simon Farnaby. “It’s amazing how he 
invents new ways to[email redacted by Family Website Editor] everything up!”

Haas, from the grassy knoll to the left of 15, chips to 12 feet. That’s a fine 
shot from where he was, having taken the amount of shots he had. He guides home 
the right-to-left drifter, limiting the damage to a bogey. He moves back to -5 
though. Johnston sends his ball into filthy bother down the right of 16, but 
punches into the middle of the green and two putts later is saving his par. 
He’s still -5, and has a share of third. Problem is, there’s a long way between 
third and the top two. There’s a new clubhouse leader, incidentally, JB Holmes 
having just signed for a 69 that was looking much better until those bogeys at 
14 and 15.

Mickelson’s genius knows no bounds. He sends what at first sight appears to be 
a woefully overhit chip to the back of the green. But his ball’s on that length 
of string, isn’t it. It spins back from 30 feet to five, and he tucks away the 
putt. What an absurd par! Just unbelievable! And it’s his ninth in a row! Phil 
Mickelson-Faldo. Stenson gets up and down for his par, and he’ll be wondering 
what Mickelson has to do to drop a shot.

And in its own way, this is equally brilliant by Phil Mickelson. He hooks a 
piss-poor tee shot straight at a gorse bush down the left of 12. The ball 
should be snaffled up by nature, but one branch, acting as bouncer, refuses 
entry. His ball’s right up against the tough bush. He’s hardly got any room for 
backswing, but he brings his club up and down like an axe murderer, and punches 
an astonishing effort 100 yards up the hole! That took nerves of steel as well 
as talent. What a player Mickelson is! And it kind of spooks Stenson who, from 
the middle of the fairway, leaves his second short of the green.

I had to mention Bill Haas’s run of pars, didn’t I. He drives into a bunker on 
15, chips out, then sends his third into an appalling thicket on the left of 
the hole. He’ll be in a bit of bother there. Meanwhile up on 14, Finau tries to 
revive his slim chances by raking in a 60-foot monster right across the green 
for birdie. He’s unlikely to be winning from -3, but that’s a special putt 
worthy of a mention.

Trouble for Sergio and Beef down 15. Sergio takes two to get out of the 
fairway bunker he’s driven into; Beef sends his second, a wood, into a pot 
bunker front left of the green. Sergio arrows his fourth straight at the flag, 
but 40 feet short. Two putts, and that’s a double. He’s back to +2, and 2016 
isn’t his year either. Gah! But never mind! Another folk hero is still in it! 
Calmness itself, Johnston lobs high out of the bunker to ten feet, then knocks 
in the par saver! He stays at -5. Meanwhile there’s a 25-foot birdie putt for 
Haas across the par-three 14th. He leaves it well short, but rolls in a very 
missable second putt, and that’s a Faldo-Strickeresque five pars since the turn.

Mickelson steers his second at 11 down the left of the hole, but leaves 
himself short and snookered by a bunker.He lobs off a tight lie to 12 feet, and 
knocks a very tricky putt straight into the hole. He’ll have been fearing the 
worst the second his ball left the face of his driver; he’s got away with a 
stunning par there. Stenson meanwhile whistles his second from the fairway to 
the left of the green, and wedges his third up to a couple of feet. Another 
great par, though Stenson’s was a lot freer of fuss.

A huge break for Mickelson, who hits his drive at 11 towards the gorse bushes 
on the left.If the ball reaches, as it should, it’ll be lost. But the contact 
is so poor that it lands short of the trouble in the semi-rough. That could 
have been a game changer. Stenson has his heart in his mouth too, as his drive 
toys with the heather down the right. But his ball takes a kind bounce to the 
left and ends up on the fairway. Meanwhile up the hole it’s all beginning to go 
south for Kjeldsen, who follows double with a bogey, missing a disgraceful 
tiddler; he’s -4. His playing partner Bradley toughs out a par to remain at -5.

Beef dumps his tee shot at 14 into the bunker front right. His escape isn’t 
too great, and he’s left with a 20-footer for his par. He can’t make it. Back 
to -5. Sergio meanwhile creams a beaut to three feet, and taps in the birdie 
putt. He’s -4 again, and clinging onto hope by his fingernails. Meanwhile back 
on 10, a huge moment for Henrik Stenson, who leaves his second well short of 
the green, chunks the chip, and is left with a 40-footer for his par. And he 
sends a laser-guided missile straight into the cup! What a putt! That was so 
nearly a very miserable bogey for the Swede, but he escapes with par. No drama 
for Mickelson as he makes his, but that’ll feel like a small win for Stenson.

Beef, up a bank to the side of 13, sends a chip scampering straight into the 
cup for a birdie!He waves his club around in the air while laughing and 
grinning. He appears to be having fun. Fun, in professional sport? Whatever 
next? He’s in third place at the Open! He’s sharing it with Bill Haas, who has 
three straight pars since the turn, but not Keegan Bradley, whose short par 
putt at 10 flies off to the right and never comes back. Meanwhile a round of 73 
for Rory McIlroy, who unlike the broadly smiling Andrew Johnston, unencumbered 
by the weight of his own expectation, doesn’t look as though he’s enjoying his 
golf right now at all. (See also Sergio, who cards his third birdie in four 
holes at 13 as Beef is waving his arms around in delight. Where did fun-loving 
Sergio and Rory go?)

-11: Mickelson (9)
-10: Stenson (9)

Kjeldsen is in trouble down 10. He drove into filth down the right, then went 
hell for leather with his second. The ball flew out at a right angle, towards 
some similar nonsense on the other side of the hole. He can only hack out to 
the front-left fringe, and he’s got a long two putts for his bogey. He can’t 
get up and down, and the double drops him back to -5. Back up on the tee, 
Mickelson and Stenson, now well clear of the field, find the centre of the 
fairway.

A birdie putt from the fringe at the back of 9 for Stenson. It’s not a bad 
effort, but it takes a little bobble and, like Frank Costanza, stops short. He 
reaches the turn in 35, -10 overall. Mickelson’s birdie putt from just off the 
front is a little tentative, though these greens are getting slower and slower. 
He taps home from a couple of feet to turn in 35 too, a shot ahead of the Swede.

Beef fires a lovely second into 12, leaving himself an uphill birdie putt from 
20 feet. He’s not far away from it, but par will have to do. His playing 
partner Sergio bogeys, however: it’s his second in two holes, after shedding 
one at 10, and he’s back where he started the day at -4.

Stenson can’t get both feet in the bunker, or his club behind the ball. So 
he’s got to play out sideways. He finds the front fringe, and knocks his long 
par saver to a couple of feet. A bogey. Mickelson has a look at birdie. He very 
nearly rolls in his 15-footer from the fringe, but it’s a snaky line and it 
kinks off to the left at the death. A par. Kjeldsen reaches the turn in 
level-par 36 after two careful putts from the centre of 9. Meanwhile after 
going so long without a bogey, it’s two on the bounce for JB Holmes, who misses 
a short putt at 15. He’s back to -4.

-11: Mickelson (8)
-10: Stenson (8)
-7: Kjeldsen (9)
-6: Haas (11), Bradley (9)
-5: Garcia (11), Johnston (11)
-4: Holmes (15)

Stenson and Mickelson both lag up well to save their pars. They’ll move to the 
Postage Stamp in good heart. Mickelson’s tee shot lands to the right of the 
flag front-right, and threatens to spin back into the bunker. It’s all a big 
tease: it stays out. Stenson however comes up short and his ball dribbles into 
the sand. That’s on the downslope and he might not have a great stance. God 
speed, Henrik. News meanwhile of Charl Schwartzel, who is experiencing quite a 
rollercoaster round after his magical 66 yesterday: double bogey at 2, followed 
by birdies at 4, 6 and 8. Now he’s bogeyed 10 to end up back where he started, 
at -4.

Mickelson drives into more trouble, down the right of 7. His second takes a 
bit of a flyer, and ends up at the back of a large green, a good way from the 
flag. Stenson finds the bunker to the right of the fairway, and can only find 
the front fringe with his splash out. Once again, pars are not a given here. Up 
on 8, both Bradley and Kjeldsen are unfortunate to see good tee shots end up in 
the front bunker, Haas-Finau style. Bradley gets up and down well to save his 
par; he’s -6, having responded to those bogeys at 1 and 4 with birdie at 6. 
Kjeldsen lips out, though, and drops back to -7. Still no par since 2. Holmes 
meanwhile drops his first shot of the day at 14: he’s -5.

Tony Finau’s round is unravelling at double-quick speed. Having driven into 
thick rough down the right of 7, he double bogeys. For a second it looks as 
though he’s grabbed the shots back at 8 with a hole in one, but his 
backspinning ball, which for a second looks like ending up in the hole, finds 
the bunker instead. He takes two to get out, and that’s another bogey. All of a 
sudden, he’s down to -3. Haas meanwhile misses a par tiddler on 9, though he’s 
reached the turn in 34. But it’s back-to-back birdies for Kjeldsen, at 7. No 
par since 2 for the Dane. He’s in third spot, with clear distance either side 
of him.

-11: Stenson (6), Mickelson (6)
-8: Kjeldsen (7)
-6: Holmes (13), Haas (9), Bradley (7)

Trouble for the leading pair on 6. Out of position with their tee shots, 
Stenson and Mickelson send dismal second strokes into the thickest rubbish down 
the left of the hole. Neither looks to have any chance of reaching the green; 
there’s a chance shots could be shed here. But both make it to the fringe with 
almighty lashes, the former to the right, the latter quite a bit nearer at the 
back. Mickelson isn’t too far from draining an improbable birdie putt. Par. But 
Stenson leaves his long birdie putt six feet short, and prods a very uncertain 
par effort wide right. He drops back in a tie for the lead at -11.

It’s Dustin Johnson Meltdown Time! 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8MDNFaGfT4> Having made his way up the 
leaderboard to -5, he’s crashing back down it after getting into shrub-related 
nonsense off the 11th tee. A triple bogey, the result of an unplayable lie, and 
he’s out of it at -2. Meanwhile Beef rattles one in from the fringe to the back 
of 9, and he’s reached the turn in 34! The crowd are enjoying his presence. 
He’s -6. So from Beef to Mince, with Simon McMahon: “Ah, mince. The great 
Dundee delicacy. Forget Desperate Dan’s cow pie, give me a plate of mince with 
Oor Wullie anytime. If I ever won the Masters, mince and tatties would be 
served at the Champions Dinner. With mince rolls for pudding. Mince McMahon has 
a certain ring to it, no?”

So this appears to be trouble for poor Bill Haas at the Postage Stamp. The 
flag is front right, and he lands his ball a few feet in front of it. But the 
ball screeches into reverse, then spins off to the right and into the bunker. 
The camber certainly wasn’t his friend there. He’s not got much space to work 
with. But he splashes out delicately, his ball landing on the small strip of 
green between sand and flag, then trundling into the hole! That’s delightful! 
Much deserved after a very unfortunate tee shot. Meanwhile back on 7, 
Kjeldsen’s up-and-down round continues with his second bounce-back birdie in 
four holes, thanks to a 15-footer from the back of the green. The pair are both 
back up to -7, four shy of Mickelson in second.

Back-to-back birdies for Sergio Garcia! He clips his tee shot at the Postage 
Stamp to six feet, his ball flying over the flag and biting immediately. It 
threatened to spin back super close, but no matter: he guides in the 
right-to-left curler for his birdie. Beef plays a similarly excellent tee shot, 
but somehow his putt lipped out. “Aw man!” he shouts with a frustrated smile, 
playing to the gallery. Finau is up and down from a bunker for birdie at 6, his 
second in three holes. He’s -6. And back on 5, Stenson is half the distance 
inside Mickelson at the par-three. Mickelson makes a long two-putt par, while 
Stenson doesn’t hit his birdie putt. He’s a turn short, and another chance to 
put two shots’ worth of distance between himself and Mickelson is gone.

Mickelson can’t make his birdie putt on 4 - in fact, he was a couple of feet 
outside Stenson - and so is somewhat relieved when his rival hits a very meek 
eagle putt. It’s never going in, and while he’ll never complain at birdie, 
that’s a chance to put some serious scoreboard pressure on Mickelson passed up. 
Sergio, who has been quiet for a while, makes a birdie on 7 and moves up to -5. 
A birdie for Beef at 7 too; bully for him. Dustin gets up and down from the 
bank to the side of 10 to scramble a precious par: he’s still -5. And another 
three-putt bogey for Kjeldsen, this time at 5. He’s back to -6.

-12: Stenson (4)
-11: Mickelson (4)
-6: Holmes (11), Haas (6), Kjeldsen (5)
-5: D Johnson (10), Garcia (7), Johnston (7), Finau (5), Bradley (5)

Steve Stricker pars the last, and he’s signed for a 68. He’s the early 
clubhouse leader. Martin Kaymer birdies 9, his third in four holes. After 
bogeys at 2 and 3, that’s a fine turnaround. He’s back to -4, and not out of 
this yet, despite his travails yesterday afternoon and early in this round. 
Bill Haas meanwhile gets up and down from a greenside bunker at 6 for his third 
birdie of the day, a fine response to that rush of blood on the previous green. 
He’s back to -6.

Mickelson drives into thick filth down the right of 4, and opts to take his 
medicine and chip out. He sends his wedge into the heart of the green, where 
he’ll have a 12-foot birdie putt. Stenson meanwhile crashes his drive straight 
down the middle, then whistles his second pin high to 20 feet. He’ll have a 
good look at eagle!

Soren Kjeldsen bounces straight back to -7 with birdie at 4. His playing 
partner Keegan Bradley cards his second bogey of the day, deciding not to go 
for the flag from one of the greenside bunkers, the steep face spooking him 
out. He looks fidgety and nervous today. He’s slipped down the leaderboard to 
-5. Meanwhile disaster for Zach Johnson on the par-three 5th. He puts his ball 
in a bunker front right, and hits the face coming out, leaving himself a long 
putt from the fringe for par. He lags up, then misses a tiddler, and that’s a 
costly double that drops him to -4.

Dustin Johnson looks to be in trouble down the right of 9, in thick rubbish, 
but powers his chip up the hole and onto the green to six feet. It’s as though 
that long grass wasn’t even there. A second birdie in three holes, and he’s 
reached the turn in 33. He’s -5, and quickly becoming a factor. Haas meanwhile 
nearly drains a long birdie putt across the par-three 5th - then horseshoes the 
tiddler he leaves himself for par! Dreadfully careless, and he’s back to -5.

JB Holmes birdies 9 to reach the turn in 32. The big-hitting American has done 
this without picking up a shot on either of the par-fives! He’s got a share of 
third. Open debutant Tony Finau meanwhile birdies 4 to move into the top ten. 
But there’s a bit of a gap that’s developed at the top now. Mickelson flops 
high over a bunker from the fairway to six feet, and makes his birdie. Stenson 
is an inch or two from chipping in from the bunker for eagle, a shot he had 
meticulously lined up. Birdie too. Is this Open about to turn into a two-man 
shootout?

-11: Mickelson (3), Stenson (3)
-6: Holmes (9), Haas (4), Z Johnson (3), Bradley (3), Kjeldsen (3)
-5: Cabrera-Bello (7), Finau (4)

A three-putt bogey for Soren Kjeldsen on 3. He’s back to -6. Meanwhile the 
dependable Steve Stricker is going along very nicely indeed. He reached the 
turn in 34, then went on another long run of pars, before breaking it up with a 
birdie at 16. He’s -3, and will be cursing the wind-affected quadruple bogey on 
15 yesterday that ruined an otherwise perfect card of pars. News meanwhile of 
Rafael Cabrera-Bello, who has added to his birdie at 3 with another at 7. He’s 
right in the mix at -5.

Is Rory out of this? The head would say yes, but if he manages to pull a few 
rabbits out of the hat over the back nine, you never know. He pushes his second 
to 10 down the swale to the right of the green, but he putts up the bank to six 
feet, and knocks in the par saver. That’s good work with the flat stick - at 
last! - and perhaps the scramble on a difficult hole will give him succour? 
We’ll see, we’ll see. Back on 3, Stenson and Mickelson get out the big Berthas. 
Stenson nearly drives the green, but his ball topples in the bunker front 
right. Mickelson is a little shorter and will have a short chip in. And up on 
4, another birdie for Bill Haas, who moves within four of the lead at -6.

The US Open champ Dustin Johnson isn’t out of this yet. He’s been distinctly 
average all week, by his own high standards: 71 and 69 for his first two 
rounds. But he’s making a quiet move up the leaderboard this afternoon. A 
birdie at 4, and now he’s driven the green at 7. He doesn’t hit his 20-foot 
eagle putt, which is a terrible shame because it was very gettable, but in goes 
the birdie putt, and he’s -4 for the tournament suddenly. He’s just six off the 
lead, as Stenson gets up and down from the back of 2 for his par, while 
Mickelson prods at his short birdie effort with great timidity. Six behind is 
nothing. Mickelson himself won from six behind on the final day at Muirfield.

Reed can’t save his par on 8, but he limited the damage from a very tricky 
position in the Coffin. He’s back to -4. As is Sergio, who can’t get up and 
down from the sand at 5, leaving himself far too long a par putt. That’s grimly 
predictable after a birdie that could have been an eagle. Meanwhile on 2, 
Mickelson plays it safe from the tee with another iron, then smacks his second 
into the flag, the ball bouncing to the left and landing 12 feet from the pin 
as the gallery oohs, aahs, gasps and yelps. He’s a showman all right, and goes 
bounding up the fairway with his mouth open in his trademark eager-puppy style. 
Stenson’s second is just off the back left, but it’s puttable.

Reed has dunked his tee shot into the Coffin bunker at the Postage Stamp. He 
can only play out backwards, but does so delicately. He’s on the fringe at the 
front of the green, likely to be dropping one, but at least with a look at 
saving par from 25 feet. Also in trouble, Sergio, who drives into a bunker down 
4, chips out, then whips a long iron into more sand front left of the green. 
He’ll have an up and down to save his par on a hole that’s been playing easy 
this week. Meanwhile a fairly nondescript par for Mickelson on the opening 
hole, but Stenson chips on to the front of the green, then rolls uphill and 
into the cup from 15 feet to join the US veteran in the lead!

-10: Stenson (1), Mickelson (1)
-7: Kjeldsen (1)
-6: Z Johnson (2), Bradley (2)

Zach Johnson could easily have dropped a stroke on the opening hole. Now he’s 
draining a 35-footer all the way up 2 to move to -6. By way of contrast, up on 
9, McIlroy finds the heart of the green in two, but once again underhits a 
birdie putt. He reaches the turn in one-over 37, not what he was after at all. 
He’s -1, and he’ll not be winning this Open putting like he does. He needs to 
have a serious think about this, because he gets himself into so many good 
positions, yet converts relatively few of them into tangible reward.

A fourth birdie on the spin for Reed, this time at 7! It’s a powerful charge 
by the enigmatic young man. Several of the chasing pack are making their move, 
though there’s an exception proving the rule: Keegan Bradley, having found sand 
at 1, is immediately going backwards. It’ll be interesting to see how the 
leaders react. And on the 1st tee, it’s the final pairing. Henrik Stenson 
cracks one down the middle of the fairway, and Phil Mickelson follows. 
Gauntlet’s down!

Zach Johnson seriously underhits his first putt on 1, but guides in a missable 
left-to-right six-footer for his par.That’s a decent outcome having played the 
hole quite poorly. A few players should take note of his determined scrambling 
skills. Sergio meanwhile drives the green at 3. He’s got a 25-foot eagle putt, 
and fails to hit it. But he knocks in the four-footer that remains, and he 
moves up the leaderboard to -5. Here’s Hubert O’Hearn: “As odd a nickname as 
Beef is, on further thought what other main course would ever do? I can’t 
imagine anyone really being flattered with the name Pork or Lamb, Chicken would 
start a bar fight, and heaven knows that’s to be done with a vegetarian. ‘On 
the tee, Tofu Johnson.’ No, that just wouldn’t do. Beef it is.” Chops would 
work. T-Bone, obviously, as suggested by George Costanza. Burger, at a push. 
Though we can probably strike Mince off the list.

Mickelson smacks the sand, blasting his ball out and screeching it to a halt, 
four feet from the flag. What moxie that took, given a flyer would have sent it 
through the green and O/B at the back. Stenson’s is a little less tricky, and 
he can ease a little chip to three feet, no fuss. Mickelson taps in for his 
par, and that’s a brilliant 70 under these pressurised circumstances. Stenson 
then rolls his home for an even more impressive 68. The pair embrace warmly at 
the end of a stunning day of to-and-fro golf. It’s going to be some duel 
tomorrow! You’ll not want to miss a shot. See you tomorrow, for what could be a 
classic. A repeat of 1977 at Turnberry? Yes please!

Mickelson’s up first. He whip-cracks his long iron towards the front of the 
green, but it’s short and bounces off to the left as it lands, and finds the 
bunker front left. Lefty blows up, bollocking the snappers behind him, one of 
whom clicked a little too early. “That’s so shitty. I can’t believe that. I get 
you have to cover it, but why do you have to interfere with it?” He isfuming. 
Stenson connects a little better, getting his distance right, but his shot’s 
away to the left of the green. It’s not in a terrible spot, but not perfect. 
Mickelson gathers himself to smile again as he responds to the wild reception 
afforded to both players by the Troon faithful as they walk to the green. 
Imagine the tension, the atmosphere, this time tomorrow!
 
A couple of fine drives down the last. Stenson on the fairway down the right, 
Mickelson just a step or two off the same side in the semi-rough. Up on the 
green, Bradley nearly goes out of bounds at the back, but his ball stops just 
short of the clubhouse. He chips up to five feet, but his fragile confidence 
isn’t quite repaired yet. He misses the putt, and it’s a bogey that sets the 
seal on a disappointing 76. But Bradley hasn’t been anywhere near the business 
end of a major since the 2014 US Open, so one step at a time. He should still 
take heart from they way this week is going. He ends the day at -2. His partner 
Soren Kjeldsen meanwhile knocks in a 20-footer to save his par. That’s an 
equally deflating 75, and he’s -3.
 
Mickelson’s in the thick stuff, and he thins his chip a little, the ball 
flying 12 feet past the hole. Par’s an uphill struggle now. Stenson meanwhile 
might actually be 20 feet away, but what’s five feet between friends? He rolls 
it straight towards the cup, and it always looks like dropping! What a putt! 
What a time to drain one like that! And for the second time in four holes, it’s 
a two-shot swing in favour of Stenson, because Mickelson’s attempt to save par 
is always staying out on the left! Wow! The drama isrelentless!

-12: Stenson (17)
-11: Mickelson (17)

This is simply wonderful entertainment, a joyous slugfest, mano-a-mano 
brilliance. And it’s not even the end of Saturday yet! Phil pushes his tee shot 
at 17 into rather thick awfulness to the left of the green, while Stenson finds 
the heart, Keegan Country, and he’ll get a good look at birdie from 15 feet! 
Every single shot already feels vital. Excited about tomorrow? Over-excited?
Ludicrously over-excited? Yep! Us too!
 
Stenson splashes out to six feet, a fine shot from the deep pot. But Mickelson 
turns up the pressure by curling in his right-to-left birdie putt, though he 
needed every bit of the cup as it toyed with lipping out. Stenson’s six-foot 
par putt suddenly looks twice the distance. But he knocks it in, nervelessly 
so. Mickelson takes a one-stroke lead at -12, though. Up on 17, Keegan Bradley 
hits a lovely tee shot pin high, and very nearly rolls in the 25-foot birdie 
chance. Par for Kjeldsen, too. And on 18, the defending champ Zach Johnson 
bogeys, and that’s a poor third-day 75. He’s -1, and won’t become the first man 
to retain the title since Padraig Harrington in 2008.

-12: Mickelson (16)
-11: Stenson (16)
-6: Haas (F)
 
Stenson lashes his second out of the thick rough, taking his medicine and just 
advancing his ball up the fairway. No heroics. Mickelson, on the prime track, 
whips a long iron further up the hole. Mickelson has a 50 or 60 yard advantage 
coming into the green. Stenson first, then, and he pulls one into the bunker 
guarding the front left of the green. Then Lefty sends a wedge bouncing 
straight at the flag, stopping ten feet short. Yep, advantage Mickelson. 
Stenson will need a good up and down here.
 
A pair of hard-fought pars by Mickelson and Stenson at 15. Phew, that was a 
grind. Suddenly a sense of how important every single stroke is, given they’re 
five clear of Bill Haas, who has just wrapped up on 18 with par for a 69: he’s 
-6. It’s taken on the dynamic of a match-play grapple. A Nicklaus/Watson-style 
duel tomorrow? Yes please! Stenson pulls his drive at 16 into thick rough down 
the left, while Mickelson finds the fairway. Up ahead, Bradley pars while 
Kjeldsen slides one in from the fringe on the right to make a desperately 
needed birdie; they’re both -3.

Andrew Johnston is so close to stroking in his birdie putt. He sends it 
serenely sailing across the 18th, but it stops a turn short. That’s a 70, and 
he’s -5 for the 2016 Open, only his second appearance in this famous old 
tournament. “Beeeeeeeeeeef!” The crowd love the man. He’s a star in the making 
all right. And he’s enjoying every minute. Smiles! Enjoyment! Fun! Hopefully 
Sergio, who went round with him in 73 and is -2 overall, has been taking notes. 
I miss fun-loving, risk-taking, swashbuckling Sergio. Can we have him back, 
please?

A staunch two putts from the back of 17, and Bill Haas has saved his par. He 
remains at -6. Keegan Bradley begins to go backwards again. Bogeys at 14 and 
15, and he slips down to -3. Andrew Johnston meanwhile creams his second into 
18 pin high, leaving himself a 15-foot look across the green for birdie. He 
walks up the last to a tumultuous reception, the sort of thing that by rights 
should only happen on Sunday afternoon, and to the prospective champion. Rich 
cries of “Beeeeeeeeeeeeeef!” pouring down from the grandstand like rich gravy.
 
There are many reasons Phil Mickelson is so popular. Here’s just one: he stops 
off on his way to the 14th tee to hand his birdie ball to a young lad, whose 
face cracks into disbelieving glee. It’s not much, but it means everything. 
Stenson bounces back from the blow at 13 by landing his tee shot six feet away, 
then rolling in the birdie putt. He’s not won a major yet, but that’s a 
champion’s response. Mickelson, who had found the centre of the green and 
lagged up, should tap in for his par, but hits the tiddler too hard and it lips 
out on the right. Mickelson spooked Stenson on the last; now the boot’s on the 
other foot. That’s another reason Lefty is so popular: he’s not perfect, a 
flawed hero.

-11: Mickelson (14), Stenson (14)
-6: Haas (17)
-5: Beef (17)
 
A birdie putt sunk by Mickelson from the front of 13! That’s a spectacular 
25-footer that’s rattled Stenson, who misses a much simpler effort from 15 
feet. Mickelson leads by two! Haas curls one in from 15 feet on the par-five 
16th to reclaim sole ownership of third spot, though Beef might not mind too 
much, having hit his tee shot at 17 in front of a bunker front right, lobbed to 
ten feet, and drained the par saver! He’s holding on at -5. But another bogey 
for Kjeldsen, who has fallen to bits since missing that short par putt on the 
Postage Stamp. Bogeys at 13 and 14 have swatted him down the leaderboard as low 
as -2. “Sergio is so creative!” trills Simon Farnaby. “It’s amazing how he 
invents new ways to[email redacted by Family Website Editor] everything up!”

Haas, from the grassy knoll to the left of 15, chips to 12 feet. That’s a fine 
shot from where he was, having taken the amount of shots he had. He guides home 
the right-to-left drifter, limiting the damage to a bogey. He moves back to -5 
though. Johnston sends his ball into filthy bother down the right of 16, but 
punches into the middle of the green and two putts later is saving his par. 
He’s still -5, and has a share of third. Problem is, there’s a long way between 
third and the top two. There’s a new clubhouse leader, incidentally, JB Holmes 
having just signed for a 69 that was looking much better until those bogeys at 
14 and 15.

Mickelson’s genius knows no bounds. He sends what at first sight appears to be 
a woefully overhit chip to the back of the green. But his ball’s on that length 
of string, isn’t it. It spins back from 30 feet to five, and he tucks away the 
putt. What an absurd par! Just unbelievable! And it’s his ninth in a row! Phil 
Mickelson-Faldo. Stenson gets up and down for his par, and he’ll be wondering 
what Mickelson has to do to drop a shot.
 
And in its own way, this is equally brilliant by Phil Mickelson. He hooks a 
piss-poor tee shot straight at a gorse bush down the left of 12. The ball 
should be snaffled up by nature, but one branch, acting as bouncer, refuses 
entry. His ball’s right up against the tough bush. He’s hardly got any room for 
backswing, but he brings his club up and down like an axe murderer, and punches 
an astonishing effort 100 yards up the hole! That took nerves of steel as well 
as talent. What a player Mickelson is! And it kind of spooks Stenson who, from 
the middle of the fairway, leaves his second short of the green.
 
I had to mention Bill Haas’s run of pars, didn’t I. He drives into a bunker on 
15, chips out, then sends his third into an appalling thicket on the left of 
the hole. He’ll be in a bit of bother there. Meanwhile up on 14, Finau tries to 
revive his slim chances by raking in a 60-foot monster right across the green 
for birdie. He’s unlikely to be winning from -3, but that’s a special putt 
worthy of a mention.
 
Trouble for Sergio and Beef down 15. Sergio takes two to get out of the 
fairway bunker he’s driven into; Beef sends his second, a wood, into a pot 
bunker front left of the green. Sergio arrows his fourth straight at the flag, 
but 40 feet short. Two putts, and that’s a double. He’s back to +2, and 2016 
isn’t his year either. Gah! But never mind! Another folk hero is still in it! 
Calmness itself, Johnston lobs high out of the bunker to ten feet, then knocks 
in the par saver! He stays at -5. Meanwhile there’s a 25-foot birdie putt for 
Haas across the par-three 14th. He leaves it well short, but rolls in a very 
missable second putt, and that’s a Faldo-Strickeresque five pars since the turn.

Mickelson steers his second at 11 down the left of the hole, but leaves 
himself short and snookered by a bunker.He lobs off a tight lie to 12 feet, and 
knocks a very tricky putt straight into the hole. He’ll have been fearing the 
worst the second his ball left the face of his driver; he’s got away with a 
stunning par there. Stenson meanwhile whistles his second from the fairway to 
the left of the green, and wedges his third up to a couple of feet. Another 
great par, though Stenson’s was a lot freer of fuss.
 
A huge break for Mickelson, who hits his drive at 11 towards the gorse bushes 
on the left.If the ball reaches, as it should, it’ll be lost. But the contact 
is so poor that it lands short of the trouble in the semi-rough. That could 
have been a game changer. Stenson has his heart in his mouth too, as his drive 
toys with the heather down the right. But his ball takes a kind bounce to the 
left and ends up on the fairway. Meanwhile up the hole it’s all beginning to go 
south for Kjeldsen, who follows double with a bogey, missing a disgraceful 
tiddler; he’s -4. His playing partner Bradley toughs out a par to remain at -5.
 
Beef dumps his tee shot at 14 into the bunker front right. His escape isn’t 
too great, and he’s left with a 20-footer for his par. He can’t make it. Back 
to -5. Sergio meanwhile creams a beaut to three feet, and taps in the birdie 
putt. He’s -4 again, and clinging onto hope by his fingernails. Meanwhile back 
on 10, a huge moment for Henrik Stenson, who leaves his second well short of 
the green, chunks the chip, and is left with a 40-footer for his par. And he 
sends a laser-guided missile straight into the cup! What a putt! That was so 
nearly a very miserable bogey for the Swede, but he escapes with par. No drama 
for Mickelson as he makes his, but that’ll feel like a small win for Stenson.
 
Beef, up a bank to the side of 13, sends a chip scampering straight into the 
cup for a birdie!He waves his club around in the air while laughing and 
grinning. He appears to be having fun. Fun, in professional sport? Whatever 
next? He’s in third place at the Open! He’s sharing it with Bill Haas, who has 
three straight pars since the turn, but not Keegan Bradley, whose short par 
putt at 10 flies off to the right and never comes back. Meanwhile a round of 73 
for Rory McIlroy, who unlike the broadly smiling Andrew Johnston, unencumbered 
by the weight of his own expectation, doesn’t look as though he’s enjoying his 
golf right now at all. (See also Sergio, who cards his third birdie in four 
holes at 13 as Beef is waving his arms around in delight. Where did fun-loving 
Sergio and Rory go?)

Kjeldsen is in trouble down 10. He drove into filth down the right, then went 
hell for leather with his second. The ball flew out at a right angle, towards 
some similar nonsense on the other side of the hole. He can only hack out to 
the front-left fringe, and he’s got a long two putts for his bogey. He can’t 
get up and down, and the double drops him back to -5. Back up on the tee, 
Mickelson and Stenson, now well clear of the field, find the centre of the 
fairway.
 
A birdie putt from the fringe at the back of 9 for Stenson. It’s not a bad 
effort, but it takes a little bobble and, like Frank Costanza, stops short. He 
reaches the turn in 35, -10 overall. Mickelson’s birdie putt from just off the 
front is a little tentative, though these greens are getting slower and slower. 
He taps home from a couple of feet to turn in 35 too, a shot ahead of the Swede.

 
Beef fires a lovely second into 12, leaving himself an uphill birdie putt from 
20 feet. He’s not far away from it, but par will have to do. His playing 
partner Sergio bogeys, however: it’s his second in two holes, after shedding 
one at 10, and he’s back where he started the day at -4.
 
Stenson can’t get both feet in the bunker, or his club behind the ball. So 
he’s got to play out sideways. He finds the front fringe, and knocks his long 
par saver to a couple of feet. A bogey. Mickelson has a look at birdie. He very 
nearly rolls in his 15-footer from the fringe, but it’s a snaky line and it 
kinks off to the left at the death. A par. Kjeldsen reaches the turn in 
level-par 36 after two careful putts from the centre of 9. Meanwhile after 
going so long without a bogey, it’s two on the bounce for JB Holmes, who misses 
a short putt at 15. He’s back to -4.

Stenson and Mickelson both lag up well to save their pars. They’ll move to the 
Postage Stamp in good heart. Mickelson’s tee shot lands to the right of the 
flag front-right, and threatens to spin back into the bunker. It’s all a big 
tease: it stays out. Stenson however comes up short and his ball dribbles into 
the sand. That’s on the downslope and he might not have a great stance. God 
speed, Henrik. News meanwhile of Charl Schwartzel, who is experiencing quite a 
rollercoaster round after his magical 66 yesterday: double bogey at 2, followed 
by birdies at 4, 6 and 8. Now he’s bogeyed 10 to end up back where he started, 
at -4.
 
Mickelson drives into more trouble, down the right of 7. His second takes a 
bit of a flyer, and ends up at the back of a large green, a good way from the 
flag. Stenson finds the bunker to the right of the fairway, and can only find 
the front fringe with his splash out. Once again, pars are not a given here. Up 
on 8, both Bradley and Kjeldsen are unfortunate to see good tee shots end up in 
the front bunker, Haas-Finau style. Bradley gets up and down well to save his 
par; he’s -6, having responded to those bogeys at 1 and 4 with birdie at 6. 
Kjeldsen lips out, though, and drops back to -7. Still no par since 2. Holmes 
meanwhile drops his first shot of the day at 14: he’s -5.
 
Tony Finau’s round is unravelling at double-quick speed. Having driven into 
thick rough down the right of 7, he double bogeys. For a second it looks as 
though he’s grabbed the shots back at 8 with a hole in one, but his 
backspinning ball, which for a second looks like ending up in the hole, finds 
the bunker instead. He takes two to get out, and that’s another bogey. All of a 
sudden, he’s down to -3. Haas meanwhile misses a par tiddler on 9, though he’s 
reached the turn in 34. But it’s back-to-back birdies for Kjeldsen, at 7. No 
par since 2 for the Dane. He’s in third spot, with clear distance either side 
of him.

-11: Stenson (6), Mickelson (6)

Trouble for the leading pair on 6. Out of position with their tee shots, 
Stenson and Mickelson send dismal second strokes into the thickest rubbish down 
the left of the hole. Neither looks to have any chance of reaching the green; 
there’s a chance shots could be shed here. But both make it to the fringe with 
almighty lashes, the former to the right, the latter quite a bit nearer at the 
back. Mickelson isn’t too far from draining an improbable birdie putt. Par. But 
Stenson leaves his long birdie putt six feet short, and prods a very uncertain 
par effort wide right. He drops back in a tie for the lead at -11.
 
It’s Dustin Johnson Meltdown Time! 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8MDNFaGfT4> Having made his way up the 
leaderboard to -5, he’s crashing back down it after getting into shrub-related 
nonsense off the 11th tee. A triple bogey, the result of an unplayable lie, and 
he’s out of it at -2. Meanwhile Beef rattles one in from the fringe to the back 
of 9, and he’s reached the turn in 34! The crowd are enjoying his presence. 
He’s -6. So from Beef to Mince, with Simon McMahon: “Ah, mince. The great 
Dundee delicacy. Forget Desperate Dan’s cow pie, give me a plate of mince with 
Oor Wullie anytime. If I ever won the Masters, mince and tatties would be 
served at the Champions Dinner. With mince rolls for pudding. Mince McMahon has 
a certain ring to it, no?”

So this appears to be trouble for poor Bill Haas at the Postage Stamp. The 
flag is front right, and he lands his ball a few feet in front of it. But the 
ball screeches into reverse, then spins off to the right and into the bunker. 
The camber certainly wasn’t his friend there. He’s not got much space to work 
with. But he splashes out delicately, his ball landing on the small strip of 
green between sand and flag, then trundling into the hole! That’s delightful! 
Much deserved after a very unfortunate tee shot. Meanwhile back on 7, 
Kjeldsen’s up-and-down round continues with his second bounce-back birdie in 
four holes, thanks to a 15-footer from the back of the green. The pair are both 
back up to -7, four shy of Mickelson in second.
 
Back-to-back birdies for Sergio Garcia! He clips his tee shot at the Postage 
Stamp to six feet, his ball flying over the flag and biting immediately. It 
threatened to spin back super close, but no matter: he guides in the 
right-to-left curler for his birdie. Beef plays a similarly excellent tee shot, 
but somehow his putt lipped out. “Aw man!” he shouts with a frustrated smile, 
playing to the gallery. Finau is up and down from a bunker for birdie at 6, his 
second in three holes. He’s -6. And back on 5, Stenson is half the distance 
inside Mickelson at the par-three. Mickelson makes a long two-putt par, while 
Stenson doesn’t hit his birdie putt. He’s a turn short, and another chance to 
put two shots’ worth of distance between himself and Mickelson is gone.

Mickelson can’t make his birdie putt on 4 - in fact, he was a couple of feet 
outside Stenson - and so is somewhat relieved when his rival hits a very meek 
eagle putt. It’s never going in, and while he’ll never complain at birdie, 
that’s a chance to put some serious scoreboard pressure on Mickelson passed up. 
Sergio, who has been quiet for a while, makes a birdie on 7 and moves up to -5. 
A birdie for Beef at 7 too; bully for him. Dustin gets up and down from the 
bank to the side of 10 to scramble a precious par: he’s still -5. And another 
three-putt bogey for Kjeldsen, this time at 5. He’s back to -6.

Steve Stricker pars the last, and he’s signed for a 68. He’s the early 
clubhouse leader. Martin Kaymer birdies 9, his third in four holes. After 
bogeys at 2 and 3, that’s a fine turnaround. He’s back to -4, and not out of 
this yet, despite his travails yesterday afternoon and early in this round. 
Bill Haas meanwhile gets up and down from a greenside bunker at 6 for his third 
birdie of the day, a fine response to that rush of blood on the previous green. 
He’s back to -6.
 
Mickelson drives into thick filth down the right of 4, and opts to take his 
medicine and chip out. He sends his wedge into the heart of the green, where 
he’ll have a 12-foot birdie putt. Stenson meanwhile crashes his drive straight 
down the middle, then whistles his second pin high to 20 feet. He’ll have a 
good look at eagle!
 
Soren Kjeldsen bounces straight back to -7 with birdie at 4. His playing 
partner Keegan Bradley cards his second bogey of the day, deciding not to go 
for the flag from one of the greenside bunkers, the steep face spooking him 
out. He looks fidgety and nervous today. He’s slipped down the leaderboard to 
-5. Meanwhile disaster for Zach Johnson on the par-three 5th. He puts his ball 
in a bunker front right, and hits the face coming out, leaving himself a long 
putt from the fringe for par. He lags up, then misses a tiddler, and that’s a 
costly double that drops him to -4.
 
Dustin Johnson looks to be in trouble down the right of 9, in thick rubbish, 
but powers his chip up the hole and onto the green to six feet. It’s as though 
that long grass wasn’t even there. A second birdie in three holes, and he’s 
reached the turn in 33. He’s -5, and quickly becoming a factor. Haas meanwhile 
nearly drains a long birdie putt across the par-three 5th - then horseshoes the 
tiddler he leaves himself for par! Dreadfully careless, and he’s back to -5.
 
JB Holmes birdies 9 to reach the turn in 32. The big-hitting American has done 
this without picking up a shot on either of the par-fives! He’s got a share of 
third. Open debutant Tony Finau meanwhile birdies 4 to move into the top ten. 
But there’s a bit of a gap that’s developed at the top now. Mickelson flops 
high over a bunker from the fairway to six feet, and makes his birdie. Stenson 
is an inch or two from chipping in from the bunker for eagle, a shot he had 
meticulously lined up. Birdie too. Is this Open about to turn into a two-man 
shootout?

A three-putt bogey for Soren Kjeldsen on 3. He’s back to -6. Meanwhile the 
dependable Steve Stricker is going along very nicely indeed. He reached the 
turn in 34, then went on another long run of pars, before breaking it up with a 
birdie at 16. He’s -3, and will be cursing the wind-affected quadruple bogey on 
15 yesterday that ruined an otherwise perfect card of pars. News meanwhile of 
Rafael Cabrera-Bello, who has added to his birdie at 3 with another at 7. He’s 
right in the mix at -5.
 
Is Rory out of this? The head would say yes, but if he manages to pull a few 
rabbits out of the hat over the back nine, you never know. He pushes his second 
to 10 down the swale to the right of the green, but he putts up the bank to six 
feet, and knocks in the par saver. That’s good work with the flat stick - at 
last! - and perhaps the scramble on a difficult hole will give him succour? 
We’ll see, we’ll see. Back on 3, Stenson and Mickelson get out the big Berthas. 
Stenson nearly drives the green, but his ball topples in the bunker front 
right. Mickelson is a little shorter and will have a short chip in. And up on 
4, another birdie for Bill Haas, who moves within four of the lead at -6.
 
The US Open champ Dustin Johnson isn’t out of this yet. He’s been distinctly 
average all week, by his own high standards: 71 and 69 for his first two 
rounds. But he’s making a quiet move up the leaderboard this afternoon. A 
birdie at 4, and now he’s driven the green at 7. He doesn’t hit his 20-foot 
eagle putt, which is a terrible shame because it was very gettable, but in goes 
the birdie putt, and he’s -4 for the tournament suddenly. He’s just six off the 
lead, as Stenson gets up and down from the back of 2 for his par, while 
Mickelson prods at his short birdie effort with great timidity. Six behind is 
nothing. Mickelson himself won from six behind on the final day at Muirfield.
 
Reed can’t save his par on 8, but he limited the damage from a very tricky 
position in the Coffin. He’s back to -4. As is Sergio, who can’t get up and 
down from the sand at 5, leaving himself far too long a par putt. That’s grimly 
predictable after a birdie that could have been an eagle. Meanwhile on 2, 
Mickelson plays it safe from the tee with another iron, then smacks his second 
into the flag, the ball bouncing to the left and landing 12 feet from the pin 
as the gallery oohs, aahs, gasps and yelps. He’s a showman all right, and goes 
bounding up the fairway with his mouth open in his trademark eager-puppy style. 
Stenson’s second is just off the back left, but it’s puttable.
 
Reed has dunked his tee shot into the Coffin bunker at the Postage Stamp. He 
can only play out backwards, but does so delicately. He’s on the fringe at the 
front of the green, likely to be dropping one, but at least with a look at 
saving par from 25 feet. Also in trouble, Sergio, who drives into a bunker down 
4, chips out, then whips a long iron into more sand front left of the green. 
He’ll have an up and down to save his par on a hole that’s been playing easy 
this week. Meanwhile a fairly nondescript par for Mickelson on the opening 
hole, but Stenson chips on to the front of the green, then rolls uphill and 
into the cup from 15 feet to join the US veteran in the lead!

-10: Stenson (1), Mickelson (1)

Zach Johnson could easily have dropped a stroke on the opening hole. Now he’s 
draining a 35-footer all the way up 2 to move to -6. By way of contrast, up on 
9, McIlroy finds the heart of the green in two, but once again underhits a 
birdie putt. He reaches the turn in one-over 37, not what he was after at all. 
He’s -1, and he’ll not be winning this Open putting like he does. He needs to 
have a serious think about this, because he gets himself into so many good 
positions, yet converts relatively few of them into tangible reward.
 
A fourth birdie on the spin for Reed, this time at 7! It’s a powerful charge 
by the enigmatic young man. Several of the chasing pack are making their move, 
though there’s an exception proving the rule: Keegan Bradley, having found sand 
at 1, is immediately going backwards. It’ll be interesting to see how the 
leaders react. And on the 1st tee, it’s the final pairing. Henrik Stenson 
cracks one down the middle of the fairway, and Phil Mickelson follows. 
Gauntlet’s down!

Zach Johnson seriously underhits his first putt on 1, but guides in a missable 
left-to-right six-footer for his par.That’s a decent outcome having played the 
hole quite poorly. A few players should take note of his determined scrambling 
skills. Sergio meanwhile drives the green at 3. He’s got a 25-foot eagle putt, 
and fails to hit it. But he knocks in the four-footer that remains, and he 
moves up the leaderboard to -5. Here’s Hubert O’Hearn: “As odd a nickname as 
Beef is, on further thought what other main course would ever do? I can’t 
imagine anyone really being flattered with the name Pork or Lamb, Chicken would 
start a bar fight, and heaven knows that’s to be done with a vegetarian. ‘On 
the tee, Tofu Johnson.’ No, that just wouldn’t do. Beef it is.” Chops would 
work. T-Bone, obviously, as suggested by George Costanza. Burger, at a push. 
Though we can probably strike Mince off the list.
