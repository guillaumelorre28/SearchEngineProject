What a day for the pontiff! Here’s the key points from the first day of his 
tour, spent in Havana:

 * In an “intimate and familial” encounter, Pope Francis and former Cuban 
president Fidel Castro spoke about the environment and exchanged gifts. Pope 
Francis gave Castro books on spirituality by priests; Castro gave the pope a 
book of his own insights on spirituality. Well done, El Jefe. 
 * At a papal megamass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/pope-francis-cuba-mass-message-beyond-the-faithful>
 attended by thousands in Havana’s Revolution Square, the pope encouraged 
Cubans to serve one another, noting that service is never “servile” or 
ideological, “for we do not serve ideas, we serve people”. His homily was free 
of political messages but was nonetheless a strong statement. The liturgical 
music, a variation on Cuba’s Danzón, also a made a strong statement.

 * Prominent activists told the Guardian at least 31 protesters were arrested 
in a “repressive and aggressive” move to stop them attending the mass. This 
included members of a women’s group that campaigns for prisoner releases. 
 * On the prospect of peace in Colombia between rebels and the government, 
Pope Francis said we do not have the right toanother failure of reconciliation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/pope-colombia-farc-peace-process-failure-not-an-option>
. 
 * Cuban president Raúl Castro appears to have given Pope Francis the gift of 
a giant crucifix made out of oars. 
 * Francis went “Pope Unplugged” for the afternoon, discarding his prepared 
speeches (to the chagrin of journalists and editors everywhere). He instead 
spoke from the heart on poverty, disability, and faith to clergy and young 
people. 
Thanks for tuning in! The blog will be running all week as the pope continues 
his tour throughCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> and the US.

It was not as easy as you might expect to find Catholics among the crowd 
waiting for the pope this evening. But there was not shortage of excitements 
and optimism about seeing a pontiff who has played a major role in improving 
relations betweenCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> and the United 
States.

Many students here want to emigrate to their wealthier neighbour as soon as 
they graduate. Others hope that closer ties will help their own country become 
a more desirable place to live.

“I’m not Catholic, but I respect the pope. He’s an important man for the world 
and he has done a lot of good for Cuba,” said 21-year-old Xavier Alexander 
Rodríguez, a students of computer science.

“Young people in Cuba want change. The closer ties with the US are a great 
step towards that. I wish that we can walk like brothers with the US.”


Vivian Rodríguez (no relation), a 23-year-old lecturer in psychology at the 
University of Havana, said international support and a positive message were 
important for people like her who want to stay in Cuba.

“Cubans are very excited by the arrival of the pope. We’re grateful for the 
help he has given us in relations with other countries,” she said. “It’s always 
good to know that there is backing for unity in Cuba and closer ties with the 
United States. That helps people make personal decisions (about whether to stay 
or go).”

Another update from my colleague Angela Bruno: 

During a brief visit to the Palace of the Revolution earlier this evening, 
Pope Francis was shown what appeared to be official gifts marking his visit, 
including a 6.5 foot crucifix of oarscrafted by the Cuban artist known as Kcho 
<http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-pope-francis-meeting-raul-castro-havana-33901956>
, nee Alexis Leyva.

In March, Kcho <http://www.kchoestudio.com/> made international news when he 
turned his art studio intoCuba’s first free public Wi-Fi hotspot 
<http://mashable.com/2015/03/16/cuba-free-wifi/#Zt71sat03Pk3>, hoping to 
encourage Cubans to familiarize themselves with the Internet. It was a costly 
cause for the artist, who is reported to have close ties to the government. The 
going rate for one month of Internet service in Cuba is a whopping $900.

Pope Francis gives 'unplugged' homily on poverty and disability
 Pope Francis discarded his prepared homily and spoke off-the-cuff to the 
gathered priests and religious. Photograph: EWTN/Screenshot 
Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> put his prepared 
homily aside and gave an extraordinary “unplugged” address on poverty, mercy, 
disability and service to Cuba’s priests, religious brothers and sisters and 
seminarians, during a Vespers service at Havana Cathedral.

“We always try to curtail poverty, as it were,” the pope said. “That’s a 
reasonable thing, but I’m talking about the heart.”

“Richness impoverishes you; it takes away from us the best we have. It makes 
us poor in the only richness which is worthy: trust in God.”

“Our holy mother church is poor. God wishes it to poor, as he wishes our holy 
mother Mary to be poor. Love poverty as a mother.”

The crowd smiled and some wiped away tears as the pontiff spoke. Cameras also 
caught some looks of consternation as the congregation grappled with Francis’s 
words, especially when he (jokingly) drilled in on the struggles of some 
religious and priests.

Nuns got it first: “May God spare us grey nuns, those who are always lamenting 
things! Saint Theresa used to say that to her nuns. Woe to that nun!”

Some nuns in the crowd (mainly the young ones) laughed. Others weren’t so 
amused.

Religious life as a consecrated brother or sister is, the pope said, about 
“burning” your life for the ones the world despises, the “disposable material” 
of humanity.

As an example, he mentioned those “who with new analytical methods, if it is 
discovered they have a degenerative sickness, the world wants to send them back 
before they are born”.

“Sometimes [a young religious sister] doesn’t know how good it is to see the 
smile of someone who is paralysed,” the pope said, smiling.

“The tenderness and mercy of God is like someone who is paralysed getting 
saliva all over your face. Or when a person with a disability gets angry and 
hits you!”

Priests were next: “Please to the priests,” the holy father said, “do not grow 
tired of forgiving.”

“Do not hide in fears or rigidities. Be like this nun [Sister Ponce, who spoke 
earlier in the service about her ministry], and those who are here. They are 
not angry when they find the sick person filthy; they just clean him. When the 
penitent comes to you, don’t feel bad. Don’t be neurotic. Jesus embraced them. 
Jesus loved them.”

“No corporation can be made, no money can be made from the least ones. In that 
place Jesus shines brightly,” the pope said.

The pope says he will give his printed homily to one of the cardinals to 
distribute and is going to speak off the cuff. This regular journalist quietly

The chanted psalms are sung beautifully by a choir. The pope is saving his

Just a little church fact you might find interesting: the Catholic church’s 
communal prayer is the same around the world each day. I heard the same 
readings at mass this morning in New York as the pope heard in Havana, and in 
every other parish in the world.

In a sense, it’s like the church prays for you. That’s especially true of 
what’s called the Divine Office, the daily schedule of prayer, because few lay 
people perform it.Here’s the relevant bit for this particular service 
<http://divineoffice.org/ord-w25-sun-ep2/?title=Sep+20%2C+Evening+Prayer+II+for+Sunday+in+the+25th+week+of+Ordinary+Time&date=20150920#sthash.4wVahsEB.dpbs>

A Daughter of Charity, Sr Yaileny Ponce, speaks to the pope. She is is pouring 
her heart out about her ministry with the severely disabled. “I have to discern 
in a shout or a cry or a scream: Joy? Or pain?”

“[It’s] beautiful because there, in his weakest children, God lives and shows 
himself.”

“It is worth giving your life to serve these people because in them you find 
the kingdom of God.”

The congregation applauds her, and the pope begins the formal liturgical 
element of the service.

The Archbishop of Havana, Jaime Lucas Ortega, prays for renewal in the church. 
This feels like more of an internally-focused service for the church itself.

is Ordinary Time. Not an environmental message.#PapalGoofs

What a day for the pontiff! Here’s the key points from the first day of his 
tour, spent in Havana:

 * In an “intimate and familial” encounter, Pope Francis and former Cuban 
president Fidel Castro spoke about the environment and exchanged gifts. Pope 
Francis gave Castro books on spirituality by priests; Castro gave the pope a 
book of his own insights on spirituality. Well done, El Jefe. 
 * At a papal megamass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/pope-francis-cuba-mass-message-beyond-the-faithful>
 attended by thousands in Havana’s Revolution Square, the pope encouraged 
Cubans to serve one another, noting that service is never “servile” or 
ideological, “for we do not serve ideas, we serve people”. His homily was free 
of political messages but was nonetheless a strong statement. The liturgical 
music, a variation on Cuba’s Danzón, also a made a strong statement.

 * Prominent activists told the Guardian at least 31 protesters were arrested 
in a “repressive and aggressive” move to stop them attending the mass. This 
included members of a women’s group that campaigns for prisoner releases. 
 * On the prospect of peace in Colombia between rebels and the government, 
Pope Francis said we do not have the right toanother failure of reconciliation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/pope-colombia-farc-peace-process-failure-not-an-option>
. 
 * Cuban president Raúl Castro appears to have given Pope Francis the gift of 
a giant crucifix made out of oars. 
 * Francis went “Pope Unplugged” for the afternoon, discarding his prepared 
speeches (to the chagrin of journalists and editors everywhere). He instead 
spoke from the heart on poverty, disability, and faith to clergy and young 
people. 
Thanks for tuning in! The blog will be running all week as the pope continues 
his tour throughCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> and the US.
 
It was not as easy as you might expect to find Catholics among the crowd 
waiting for the pope this evening. But there was not shortage of excitements 
and optimism about seeing a pontiff who has played a major role in improving 
relations betweenCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> and the United 
States.

Many students here want to emigrate to their wealthier neighbour as soon as 
they graduate. Others hope that closer ties will help their own country become 
a more desirable place to live.

“I’m not Catholic, but I respect the pope. He’s an important man for the world 
and he has done a lot of good for Cuba,” said 21-year-old Xavier Alexander 
Rodríguez, a students of computer science.

“Young people in Cuba want change. The closer ties with the US are a great 
step towards that. I wish that we can walk like brothers with the US.”


Vivian Rodríguez (no relation), a 23-year-old lecturer in psychology at the 
University of Havana, said international support and a positive message were 
important for people like her who want to stay in Cuba.

“Cubans are very excited by the arrival of the pope. We’re grateful for the 
help he has given us in relations with other countries,” she said. “It’s always 
good to know that there is backing for unity in Cuba and closer ties with the 
United States. That helps people make personal decisions (about whether to stay 
or go).”
 
Another update from my colleague Angela Bruno: 

During a brief visit to the Palace of the Revolution earlier this evening, 
Pope Francis was shown what appeared to be official gifts marking his visit, 
including a 6.5 foot crucifix of oarscrafted by the Cuban artist known as Kcho 
<http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-pope-francis-meeting-raul-castro-havana-33901956>
, nee Alexis Leyva.

In March, Kcho <http://www.kchoestudio.com/> made international news when he 
turned his art studio intoCuba’s first free public Wi-Fi hotspot 
<http://mashable.com/2015/03/16/cuba-free-wifi/#Zt71sat03Pk3>, hoping to 
encourage Cubans to familiarize themselves with the Internet. It was a costly 
cause for the artist, who is reported to have close ties to the government. The 
going rate for one month of Internet service in Cuba is a whopping $900.

gathered priests and religious. Photograph: EWTN/Screenshot 
Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> put his prepared 
homily aside and gave an extraordinary “unplugged” address on poverty, mercy, 
disability and service to Cuba’s priests, religious brothers and sisters and 
seminarians, during a Vespers service at Havana Cathedral.

“We always try to curtail poverty, as it were,” the pope said. “That’s a 
reasonable thing, but I’m talking about the heart.”

“Richness impoverishes you; it takes away from us the best we have. It makes 
us poor in the only richness which is worthy: trust in God.”

“Our holy mother church is poor. God wishes it to poor, as he wishes our holy 
mother Mary to be poor. Love poverty as a mother.”

The crowd smiled and some wiped away tears as the pontiff spoke. Cameras also 
caught some looks of consternation as the congregation grappled with Francis’s 
words, especially when he (jokingly) drilled in on the struggles of some 
religious and priests.

Nuns got it first: “May God spare us grey nuns, those who are always lamenting 
things! Saint Theresa used to say that to her nuns. Woe to that nun!”

Some nuns in the crowd (mainly the young ones) laughed. Others weren’t so 
amused.

Religious life as a consecrated brother or sister is, the pope said, about 
“burning” your life for the ones the world despises, the “disposable material” 
of humanity.

As an example, he mentioned those “who with new analytical methods, if it is 
discovered they have a degenerative sickness, the world wants to send them back 
before they are born”.

“Sometimes [a young religious sister] doesn’t know how good it is to see the 
smile of someone who is paralysed,” the pope said, smiling.

“The tenderness and mercy of God is like someone who is paralysed getting 
saliva all over your face. Or when a person with a disability gets angry and 
hits you!”

Priests were next: “Please to the priests,” the holy father said, “do not grow 
tired of forgiving.”

“Do not hide in fears or rigidities. Be like this nun [Sister Ponce, who spoke 
earlier in the service about her ministry], and those who are here. They are 
not angry when they find the sick person filthy; they just clean him. When the 
penitent comes to you, don’t feel bad. Don’t be neurotic. Jesus embraced them. 
Jesus loved them.”

“No corporation can be made, no money can be made from the least ones. In that 
place Jesus shines brightly,” the pope said.
 
The pope says he will give his printed homily to one of the cardinals to 
distribute and is going to speak off the cuff. This regular journalist quietly 
screams. Thanks, Frank.
 
The chanted psalms are sung beautifully by a choir. The pope is saving his 
voice, by the look of it.

Just a little church fact you might find interesting: the Catholic church’s 
communal prayer is the same around the world each day. I heard the same 
readings at mass this morning in New York as the pope heard in Havana, and in 
every other parish in the world.

In a sense, it’s like the church prays for you. That’s especially true of 
what’s called the Divine Office, the daily schedule of prayer, because few lay 
people perform it.Here’s the relevant bit for this particular service 
<http://divineoffice.org/ord-w25-sun-ep2/?title=Sep+20%2C+Evening+Prayer+II+for+Sunday+in+the+25th+week+of+Ordinary+Time&date=20150920#sthash.4wVahsEB.dpbs>
.
 
A Daughter of Charity, Sr Yaileny Ponce, speaks to the pope. She is is pouring 
her heart out about her ministry with the severely disabled. “I have to discern 
in a shout or a cry or a scream: Joy? Or pain?”

“[It’s] beautiful because there, in his weakest children, God lives and shows 
himself.”

“It is worth giving your life to serve these people because in them you find 
the kingdom of God.”

The congregation applauds her, and the pope begins the formal liturgical 
element of the service.

This feels like more of an internally-focused service for the church itself.
