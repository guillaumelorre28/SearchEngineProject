Newcastle battler James Nitties has emerged from the golfing wilderness to 
snare the Australian Open halfway lead at Royal Sydney. Nitties produced a 
spectacular homeward-nine 29 in a seven-under-par 65 to burst from the pack 
with the day’s equal-low round on Friday.

The Dallas-based 34-year-old is nine under for the championship and one stroke 
ahead of New Zealander Ryan Fox, who recorded a second 68. US-based Lismore 
product Rhein Gibson had enjoyed the clubhouse lead all afternoon until Fox 
birdied the last hole, then Nitties leapfrogged the son of All Blacks legend 
Grant Fox with his own finishing flurry.

Adam Scott is lurking ominously three shots back in a five-way share of fourth 
place after carding a seven-birdie, one-eagle 65 in the perfect morning scoring 
conditions to match Nitties’ fine round.

The former world No1 has company on six under with first-round co-leader 
Curtis Luck, the steely 20-year-old amateur who recovered from four dropped 
shots mid-round to shoot a respectable 71.

In-form veteran Rod Pampling (67), big-hitting Todd Sinnott (68) and exciting 
20-year-old Lucas Herbert (71) are also at six under. Two-time major champion 
Jordan Spieth is well poised a further shot back after a round of 70 undermined 
by a double bogey on the par-four 15th hole.
