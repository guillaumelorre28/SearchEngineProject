A group of MPs has urged Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> to put in place a regional 
immigration policy after Brexit under which some parts of Britain would be able 
to clamp down on the numbers of foreign workers while others could maintain an 
open-door policy.

The all-party group on social integration said “regional immigration quotas” 
would help boost the public debate, instil confidence in the system and 
significantly improve relations between new arrivals to the UK and longer 
established, local communities.

In a report following an inquiry they said that not enough had been done to 
acknowledge the impact of rapid migration on many communities. But they also 
warned that the target to reduce migration to the tens of thousands had 
“unnecessarily stoked public anxiety” and given the impression that the 
government was not in control over immigration.

Instead they called for a comprehensive integration strategy from the 
government and for a requirement that immigrants speak English or are enrolled 
onto compulsory courses. The MPs claimed that the ability to converse in the 
local language was a “prerequisite for meaningful engagement with most British 
people”.

Chuka Umunna <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/chuka-umunna>, the Labour 
MP who chairs the group, said: “It’s clear that immigration has impacted on 
different communities in different ways and the pace of change has alarmed 
many. The government has a duty to address the lack of integration of 
immigrants if it is to address this. Failing to do so has left a vacuum for 
extremists and peddlers of hate to exploit.
“We now need a meaningful integration programme which works for all parts of 
the UK and an immigration policy which allows all to celebrate and look beyond 
our differences.”

He called for a “middle way between the laissez-faire multiculturalism 
favoured by successive British governments and the assimilationist politics of 
the French Burkini ban”.

On a regional system, the report said: “Promoting the geographic dispersal of 
immigrants has been shown by numerous academic studies to lead to higher levels 
of integration.

“In contrast, ‘one size fits all’ immigration systems tend to lead to lopsided 
patterns of chain migration, wherein new immigrants are attracted to areas with 
high immigrant concentrations.”

The MPs argued that the fact that foreign workers tended to be attracted to 
areas with large migrant populations was preventing some areas from benefiting 
from the economic advantages of immigration.

They cited evidence from local authorities in Scotland who fear the economic 
damage of a migration clampdown given the country’s key demographic challenge 
of a declining and ageing population.

But the politicians also warned that “chain migration” – with groups 
populating particular areas – reduced the imperative for people to improve 
their English skills and build up knowledge of local cultural practices.

Instead it risked them creating “exclusive social networks and alternative 
labour markets, which in turn alienates host communities and entrenches social 
segregation”.

The MPs acknowledged the different demands in parts of the country, with 
London mayor Sadiq Khan suggesting – like the Scottish government – a special 
rule for the capital to allow companies to attract skilled workers.

Meanwhile, political representatives in many areas including the east of 
England have wanted to see action after a rapid increase in numbers.

The interim study, which follows a review by Dame Louise Casey into 
integration, claims that language is key.

“As was acknowledged by the Casey review, speaking English is the key to full 
participation in our society and economy, and is a prerequisite for meaningful 
engagement with most British people,” it said, urging the government markedly 
increase funding for Esol (English for speakers of other languages) classes.

Evidence taken by the group with regards to the government’s immigration 
target was that by repeatedly missing the ambition, ministers had simply 
undermined confidence in the whole system.

Jon Yates, a director of The Challenge – a charity that aims to boost 
integration, said: “Since 2004, we have seen the largest single wave of 
immigration that Britain has ever experienced. We have seen limited proactive 
government policies to support this kind of extraordinary, rapid social change, 
which has transformed many communities across the UK and left them feeling 
insecure and increasingly divided.”

Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, stressed the need for action 
on teaching English.

“This is the second influential report in as many months to stress that 
accessing English language classes is an essential aspect of effective 
integration,” he said.

“But funding for English classes has been cut by more than half since 2009. 
Refugees are determined to learn English to enable them to contribute to their 
new communities through work, volunteering and socialising with their 
neighbours. They feel deeply frustrated by the lack of classes available.”

A government spokesman said: “Our country has long been home to lots of 
different cultures and communities, but all of us have to be part of one 
society – British society. That is why we are rolling out a £20m fund for 
English language provision and have also made £140m available through the 
Controlling Migration Fund to local authorities to manage impacts on 
communities caused by issues such as poor English language skills.

“However, we must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it 
difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services.”
