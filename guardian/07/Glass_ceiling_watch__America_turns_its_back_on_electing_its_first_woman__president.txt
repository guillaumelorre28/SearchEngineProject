Glass ceiling status: Intact

It’s all over bar the final counting: Donald Trump is the 45th president of 
the United States, after mounting one of the most unprecedented and divisive 
campaigns in the 240 year history of America.

Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> concludes one of the most 
bitter political contest the country has ever experienced – one marked by a 
deep mistrust of both candidates, two visions for America separated by a vast 
gulf, and resurgent strains of racism, sexism and Islamophobia.


This is the divided country that faces Trump as he steps into the presidency. 
Clinton is still, perhaps, projected to win the popular vote.

But with Republicans retaining control of the Senate and the House, Trump is 
well-positioned to act upon the promises that were the focal point of his 
campaign. A crackdown on immigration into the United States. A wall that spans 
the entirety of the US border with Mexico. A focus on white working-class 
regions of the country, conservative nominees to the supreme court, and a 
protectionist trade stance. And a combative position on the world stage, 
including a belligerent relationship with many longtime foreign allies.

On that note, we are closing the Glass Ceiling Watch blog.

We won’t see Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> tonight.

Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, has just told supporters gathered at the 
Javits Center to go home and get some sleep:

I know you’ve been here a long time. We’re still counting votes, and every 
vote should count.

Several states are still close to call, so we’re not going to have anything 
more to say tonight.

Everyone should head home. You should get some sleep. We’ll have more to say 
tomorrow.

We are so proud of you, and we are so proud of her. She has done amazing 
things and she’s not done yet.

So, no concession speech. But no party either.

Over at FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone has an early breakdown 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2016-election-results-coverage/?#livepress-update-22093501>
 of how white people voted based on their gender and their education. Of note:

College-educated white women voted for Clinton 51 percent to 45 percent, but 
non-college-educated white women voted for Trump 62 percent to 34 percent. That 
difference is nothing but stark and something we saw inklings of in October, 
whenI wrote about 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-many-gop-women-party-loyalty-trumps-personal-affront/>
 how many Republican women were willing to overlook Trump’s history of sexual 
harassment allegations and derogatory comments about women. Partisanship is a 
hell of a drug.

Kamala Harris has been named the winner of the Senate race in California. She 
will be the fourth woman of color to serve in the US Senate, joining Illinois’
Tammy Duckworth, who won her race earlier tonight. 


Until tonight, only two women of color had ever been elected to the US Senate: 
Carol Moseley Braun, from Illinois, and Mazie Hirono, who still serves the 
state of Hawaii as Senator today.

‘I want to ask Nate Silver why his methodology is so flawed’

I started the evening at an election watch party where the mood was jubilant; 
people were celebrating; Clinton was definitely going to win. A couple of hours 
later, things have swung steadily in Trump’s direction. I’m at a different 
watch party, atthe Wing, <https://www.the-wing.com/> an upscale women’s member 
club in Manhattan; it’s starting to feel less like a party and more like group 
therapy. Many of the well dressed women here seem to be in the process of 
biting their nails off.

“I don’t think I can eat or drink anything,” says one woman, flustered, 
standing in front of a slick bar covered in pizza slices and bottles of wine. 
“I’m too nervous.”

“I want to ask Nate Silver, whose website I’ve been checking religiously, why 
his methodology is so flawed,” Audrey Gelman, co-founder of The Wing tells me. 
There’s a collective sense of incredulity, almost anger, that the polls were so 
wrong.

Gelman says she’s “frightened” by the prospect of a Trump presidency, 
particularly considering the disturbing “levels of vitriol and misogyny in this 
campaign.” Still, she says, she’s comforted by the fact that she’s in this 
space, “surrounded by hundreds of women.”

If Hillary loses will it set women’s rights back? I ask Lauren Kassan, 
co-founder of the Wing. Kassan doesn’t think so; “women are going to come 
together more than ever and it’s why [women-only] spaces like this are even 
more important.”

The Virginia call comes in and, shortly after, it’s announced that Clinton is 
still projected to win. A big cheer goes up. You can practically feel the 
tension break. The volume in the room goes up. People start eating the pizza 
again. No one is getting too comfortable though. It’s very clear that if 
tonight ends in a victory for Hillary it’s going to have been a lot closer than 
anyone predicted.

It’s all over bar the final counting: Donald Trump is the 45th president of 
the United States, after mounting one of the most unprecedented and divisive 
campaigns in the 240 year history of America.

Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> concludes one of the most 
bitter political contest the country has ever experienced – one marked by a 
deep mistrust of both candidates, two visions for America separated by a vast 
gulf, and resurgent strains of racism, sexism and Islamophobia.


This is the divided country that faces Trump as he steps into the presidency. 
Clinton is still, perhaps, projected to win the popular vote.

But with Republicans retaining control of the Senate and the House, Trump is 
well-positioned to act upon the promises that were the focal point of his 
campaign. A crackdown on immigration into the United States. A wall that spans 
the entirety of the US border with Mexico. A focus on white working-class 
regions of the country, conservative nominees to the supreme court, and a 
protectionist trade stance. And a combative position on the world stage, 
including a belligerent relationship with many longtime foreign allies.

On that note, we are closing the Glass Ceiling Watch blog.

election for Donald Trump.

The counting isn’t finished but the Clinton path to victory has all but 
disappeared.

We won’t see Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> tonight.

Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, has just told supporters gathered at the 
Javits Center to go home and get some sleep:

I know you’ve been here a long time. We’re still counting votes, and every 
vote should count.

Several states are still close to call, so we’re not going to have anything 
more to say tonight.

Everyone should head home. You should get some sleep. We’ll have more to say 
tomorrow.

We are so proud of you, and we are so proud of her. She has done amazing 
things and she’s not done yet.

So, no concession speech. But no party either.
 
Kamala Harris – who earlier won her own election to become the first black 
politician ever to represent California in the Senate – is not giving up:

Over at FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone has an early breakdown 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2016-election-results-coverage/?#livepress-update-22093501>
 of how white people voted based on their gender and their education. Of note:

College-educated white women voted for Clinton 51 percent to 45 percent, but 
non-college-educated white women voted for Trump 62 percent to 34 percent. That 
difference is nothing but stark and something we saw inklings of in October, 
whenI wrote about 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-many-gop-women-party-loyalty-trumps-personal-affront/>
 how many Republican women were willing to overlook Trump’s history of sexual 
harassment allegations and derogatory comments about women. Partisanship is a 
hell of a drug.

Kamala Harris has been named the winner of the Senate race in California. She 
will be the fourth woman of color to serve in the US Senate, joining Illinois’
Tammy Duckworth, who won her race earlier tonight. 


Until tonight, only two women of color had ever been elected to the US Senate: 
Carol Moseley Braun, from Illinois, and Mazie Hirono, who still serves the 
state of Hawaii as Senator today.
 
‘I want to ask Nate Silver why his methodology is so flawed’

I started the evening at an election watch party where the mood was jubilant; 
people were celebrating; Clinton was definitely going to win. A couple of hours 
later, things have swung steadily in Trump’s direction. I’m at a different 
watch party, atthe Wing, <https://www.the-wing.com/> an upscale women’s member 
club in Manhattan; it’s starting to feel less like a party and more like group 
therapy. Many of the well dressed women here seem to be in the process of 
biting their nails off.

“I don’t think I can eat or drink anything,” says one woman, flustered, 
standing in front of a slick bar covered in pizza slices and bottles of wine. 
“I’m too nervous.”

“I want to ask Nate Silver, whose website I’ve been checking religiously, why 
his methodology is so flawed,” Audrey Gelman, co-founder of The Wing tells me. 
There’s a collective sense of incredulity, almost anger, that the polls were so 
wrong.

Gelman says she’s “frightened” by the prospect of a Trump presidency, 
particularly considering the disturbing “levels of vitriol and misogyny in this 
campaign.” Still, she says, she’s comforted by the fact that she’s in this 
space, “surrounded by hundreds of women.”
 Inside The Wing Photograph: The Guardian 
If Hillary loses will it set women’s rights back? I ask Lauren Kassan, 
co-founder of the Wing. Kassan doesn’t think so; “women are going to come 
together more than ever and it’s why [women-only] spaces like this are even 
more important.”

The Virginia call comes in and, shortly after, it’s announced that Clinton is 
still projected to win. A big cheer goes up. You can practically feel the 
tension break. The volume in the room goes up. People start eating the pizza 
again. No one is getting too comfortable though. It’s very clear that if 
tonight ends in a victory for Hillary it’s going to have been a lot closer than 
anyone predicted.
