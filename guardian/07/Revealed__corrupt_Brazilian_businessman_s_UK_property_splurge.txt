A Brazilian businessman who has admitted laundering millions of dollars in 
bribes went on a 12-month property spending spree in London and Leeds, a 
Guardian investigation has found.

Expedito Machado – the son of a former senator implicated in the massive 
corruption scandal at Petrobras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/brazil-government-crisis-briefing-dilma-rousseff-lula-petrobas>
 – spent £21m on UK real estate in 2014 and 2015, buying office buildings in 
the City and Fleet Street, an apartment in Mayfair and a canal-side plot in the 
docklands area of Leeds.

The case potentially ties London property to one of the world’s biggest fraud 
investigations, called Operation Carwash.

The investigation has already uncovered an estimated $2bn of funds diverted to 
Brazilian politicians and their allies. The kickbacks came from contractors 
bidding for work with the country’s state-owned oil and gas giant Petroleo 
Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras.

 Expedito Machado Neto. 
At the heart of the inquiry is Expedito’s father, Sérgio Machado, who turned 
whistleblower after he left Petrobras’s distribution arm, Transpetro, in 2014.

Machado had been accused of operating a long-running bribery scheme and his 
evidence to prosecutors, which includes secret tape recordings, has already 
brought down three ministers. His accusations nowrisk implicating the interim 
president, Michel Temer <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-36545331>
, who took over following the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in May.

Witness statements 
<http://www.valor.com.br/sites/default/files/infograficos/pdf/machado1_15062016.pdf>
 by Machado and his sons, who began cooperating with prosecutors in May after 
negotiating plea-bargains, set out in forensic detail how bank accounts in 
Switzerland and Andorra, British Virgin Islands shell companies and secretive 
trusts were used to collect bribes.


The Guardian can now reveal how Expedito Machado used another set of offshore 
structures 
<https://www.google.gr/search?q=machado2_15062016.pdf&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=vX6YV5alMsmOgAbwyZIo>
to move cash into the UK.


The findings raise questions about whether the money used to buy the 
properties came from kickbacks. Expedito’s witness statement suggests this was 
the case. His lawyers point out that none of the UK properties are included in 
a list of assets of supposed illegal origin which are being returned to the 
Brazilian government. They say the buildings were acquired after Expedito sold 
one of his businesses.


Lists of offshore companies owned by the family were leaked to the press along 
with their witness statements in June. Checks against the Land Registry show
four BVI entities 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/07/27/Machado2_(Pages_348-349).pdf> set up by 
Expedito Machado currently hold property in England.

The 31-year-old entrepreneur and finance worker moved to London in 2012. 
Starting in October 2014, he spent £6m on a freehold in the former docklands 
area of Leeds.

Three more investments followed – using offshore vehicles linked to multiple 
bank accounts at Santander:

 * In April 2015, GTD Properties Limited paid £7.2m for the freehold on an 
office building in Great Winchester Street. In the heart of the City of London, 
it is currently leased by a bank.

 * In June 2015, CDP Properties Limited, owned by The Noronha Trust, bought 
the leasehold to a flat on Lowndes Square in Mayfair for £1.8m.

 * In October 2015, PDB Properties Limited, belonging to The Boldro Trust, 
paid £6.2m for freehold land at Bell Yard, just off Fleet Street. The address 
is home to a legal chambers, 9-12 Bell Yard, which specialises in fraud cases. 
 A spokesperson for Santander said the bank could not discuss client 
information for confidential reasons.

Expedito Machado’s companies are understood to collect thousands of pounds a 
year in rent from their commercial tenants. There is no suggestion these 
leaseholders were aware of the identity of the beneficial owners or the source 
of the offshore companies’ funds.

The money trail

Close to his father and keen to follow him into politics, Expedito began 
acting as a go-between in 2007, helping collect kickbacks from contractors. His 
witness statement says his father, after taking up his post at Transpetro when 
he lost his Senate seat in 2003, was “pressured to obtain illegal funds by 
politicians who had supported him”.


The majority of the funds was handed over to the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party (PMDB), which nominated Machado to the Transpetro post. But some of the 
money was set aside to fund his future campaign to become a state governor. It 
was “his dream”, according to his son.

Over the following five years, the family collected 72m reals (£16.7m) in 
payments to an account held by HSBC in Zurich. Opened in 2007, the account was 
controlled by a trust set up by the bank, Expedito claimed.


The cash was transferred from HSBC to another Swiss bank, Julius Baer, in 
2013. There, it was held in investment funds.

The following year, Expedito decided to move the proceeds into property. “At 
the end of 2014, he decided to start making investments in real estate in 
Europe and was advised by lawyers that the best tax structure would be via a 
trust,” Expedito’s witness statement claims.


The senator’s son had already moved to London following the sale of an 
education business he had founded inBrazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil>.

“With the conclusion of the sale in 2012,” his statement claims, he “changed 
his residence to London to find a solution to the bribery money that had been 
deposited in Switzerland.”

“The idea of keeping the resources in a trust was … to have full flexibility 
in inclusion of new beneficiaries indicated by my father; That our father, even 
could be included as one of the beneficiaries.”


The money allegedly came from six firms, named in the witness statement, 
specialising in construction, shipping and engineering. At the time, Machado Sr 
was overseeing the modernisation of Transpetro’s fleet of ships, a programme 
that cost billions of reals.

Expedito arranged to meet executives from the contractors at cafes, offices 
and restaurants in São Paulo and other locations. It was at these encounters 
that arrangements for the illegal transfers were agreed. In one case, he 
claimed he travelled to Paris to see a Greek shipping owner at the opulent 
Hôtel de Crillon, where he allegedly handed over the details of the family’s 
Swiss account at HSBC.

In another instance, a construction company is alleged to have made a 9m real 
payment using a shell entity called Desarrollo Lanzarote SA, and bank accounts 
in the tax haven of Andorra.


Expedito said he had been assured by his father that the payments would not 
influence the choice of contractor, and would be taken from their profit 
margins. The system “would maintain good management” at Transpetro, which 
operates a large shipping fleet, terminals and thousands of kilometers of gas 
pipelines. “I understand this today to be incompatible,” Expedito’s statement 
conceded, “but at the time I did not think that way.”


Clouded by politics

Although Expedito has confessed to laundering money obtained illegally by his 
father, his lawyers emphasise that their client has been charged with no crime.


“It is noteworthy that as part of the agreement signed with Brazil’s attorney 
general and ratified by the supreme court, Mr Expedito Machado is not 
accountable for any criminal activities and no charges will be filed against 
him by the Brazilian federal prosecutors,” said his lawyer, Flavia Lotfi.

She declined to say whether money from kickbacks was used for Expedito’s UK 
investments. She noted the property was acquired after Expedito Machado had 
sold his businesses in 2012 for 44m reals (then worth about £16m).

 “All assets that had supposed illegal origins have already been identified 
and are being returned to the Brazilian government, in a total amount of 
75,000,000.00 [reals],” she added.


“Therefore, all of Expedito Machado’s remaining assets were recognised as 
legal property by the Brazilian authorities, being even accepted by the 
prosecution and the judge as collateral for the payments he must make due to 
the plea-bargain.”

Prosecutors, however, were noncommittal. The office of the attorney general 
said it had been necessary to work in haste and so the recovery of funds 
depended on the declared assets of plea-bargain collaborators. “It is necessary 
to check whether these assets have been declared in the United Kingdom,” they 
said in a statement to the Guardian. “In any case, any inconsistency that is 
found will be analysed.”

British law currently allows landlords to hold property via shell companies 
without having to declare their real identity to the authorities. Before 
resigning as prime minister, David Cameron promised to combat corruption by 
ending anonymity for landlords, but draft legislation has yet to be published.

In Brazil, the issue is clouded by politics and legal controversy because much 
of the testimony has been secured through plea-bargains. The South American 
country is relatively new to this tool to secure witness statements, but it has 
been adopted with gusto by the prosecutors involved in Operation Carwash, which 
is arguably the most politically explosive investigation in Brazil’s history.

Prosecutors have been accused by defendants, including former president Luiz 
Inácio Lula da Silva and legal counsel for the chief executive of the Odebrecht 
conglomerate, of ethically dubious tactics, such as holding suspects in jail 
for long periods of time, targeting their families and offering generous deals 
in return for blowing the whistle on high-profile suspects. Prosecutors say 
their methods are necessary to ensure justice is done against powerful figures 
in business and politics.


Few plea-bargainers have had as much of an impact as Machado Sr, who secretly 
taped conversations that led to the downfall of three ministers and could yet 
result in the fall of other senior politicians. Associates say he cooperated 
with the investigation in return for a generous deal for his sons.

• This article was amended on 2 August 2016. An earlier version said that the 
majority of the funds was handed over to elected members of the centre-right 
Brazilian Social Democrat party (PSDB). The bulk of the money went, in fact, to 
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB).
