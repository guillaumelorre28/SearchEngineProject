Danielle Moodie-Mills: Her struggle mirrors many of ours

When First Lady Michelle Obama addressed the graduates of Tuskegee University 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/09/remarks-first-lady-tuskegee-university-commencement-address>
 she did so with a level of realness we’ve come to expect from Flotus, but we 
also received a glimpse of her very real struggle – which mirrors that of many 
African Americans.

The jabs that have been taken at her femininity and personality are similar to 
the kinds that black women have been dealing with for eons. Our bodies 
literally poked and prodded – never measuring up to the European standard of 
beauty. Our demeanor questioned as being “sassy”, “angry”, “hostile” etc.

In her speech the first lady gave us insight into how being ridiculed, 
stereotyped, overlooked and verbally abused by right wing conservatives can 
take its toll – not just on her and the first family, but on all black 
Americans who have been wrongly judged and labeled as “thugs”, “troublemakers”, 
“rioters” and worse, for daring to challenge a system that was created to 
ensure our silence and submission.

We have yet to reach the mountain-top and the arc hasn’t reached the promise 
land of justice – but her sheer presence, grit and fortitude as first lady of 
the United States reminds us just how far we’ve come and yet her treatment as a 
black woman shows us just how much further we need to go.

Hannah Giorgis: This honesty is refreshing but it’s not enough

To be a black woman of stature in America is to have slow-climbed to power on 
a tightrope of resilience and circumstance, never free to forget the valley of 
stereotypes below.

The first lady named a number of racialized, gender epithets she received on 
her path toward the White House, as well as during her time there. Among the 
vitriol she’s heard were phrases almost numbingly familiar to black women in 
America: accusations of being “loud” and “angry,” being derisively referred to 
as the “baby mama” of the man to whom she is married, and having her hair 
caricatured. The speech marks a departure from her more watery (if also 
pleasant)previous public addresses 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/17/remarks-first-lady-bowie-state-university-commencement-ceremony>
 by publicly – and personally – acknowledging the stinging reality of black 
women’s uniquely perilous journey.

At first listen, I found myself almost embarrassed to feel refreshed at the 
prospect of hearing the first lady speak candidly about her painful experiences 
with a social ill that enacts wide-ranging, multi-faceted, fatal harm against 
people who look like her in the country her husband runs (and well beyond its 
borders). It is 2015; to simply ask forhonesty from public figures as black 
people lie dying in the streets 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/magazine/our-demand-is-simple-stop-killing-us.html?_r=2>
 feels like a paltry, retrograde request.

And yet, juxtaposed with Barack Obama’s track record of patronizing, 
pathologizing speeches to Black America 
<http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/how-the-obama-administration-talks-to-black-america/276015/>
 – most notably, a2013 speech at Morehouse College 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2013/05/20/president-obamas-graduation-speech-at-morehouse-college/>
 in which he told an audience of blackgraduating students that they no longer 
had “time for excuses” – Michelle Obama’s statements are indeed a breath of 
fresh air. But when our communities are suffocating, even that isn’t enough.

Rebecca Carroll: She knows the stereotypes all too well

As someone with a similar racial background to President Barack Obama – 
biracial born but black identifying, raised by white parent(s), racial 
authenticity under frequent scrutiny – I recognized immediately at the start of 
their public lives his pull to someone so entirely assured of her blackness. 
From the fist bump to the chiseled arms to a seminal speech to the 2015 
graduating class of Tuskegee,Michelle Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama> has not, does not and will 
not waver in her sense of self, humor and intellect as a black woman.

Her black womanhood predates the now all too commonly employed stereotype in 
mainstream media of the “strong, loud, emasculating black woman” – she was 
holding it down at the intersection of black and female long before folks 
decided to turn it against her, and black women all over America. She is strong 
enough to say now and feel then, in reference to her first magazine cover 
depicting her as a black militant with an afro and a machine gun: “If I’m being 
honest, it knocked me back a bit.” Loud enough to focus on her “own truth” and 
approach her family life at the White House in “creative and unconventional 
ways.”

I question the perception of Michelle Obama as an emasculating black woman in 
a largely matriarchal culture. There are many deeply rooted complexities within 
the dynamic between black women and black men – while we stand out here in the 
street marching for Trayvon, Walter, Michael, Tamir, and Freddie, emasculating 
our men isn’t at the forefront.


Michelle Obama stood in front of that graduating class and hit point by point 
– race, class, hope, intersectional identity, education – with humor and grace, 
and full-on repped the beauty of a self-realized black woman Zora Neale 
Hurston-style: “I love myself when I am laughing … and then again when I’m 
looking mean and impressive.”

Pam Spaulding : We have all experienced these slights

 Pam Spaulding Photograph: Guardian 
It was cathartic to see the first lady focus on the “little indignities” as 
well as the coarse, violent struggles we see in Ferguson and Baltimore. Every 
black woman has experienced belittling, damned-for-your-color treatment like 
being followed in stores by clerks assuming you will shoplift or being mistaken 
as “the help.”


In New York City, a friend and I used to conduct experiments about what it was 
like to “hail a cab while black”. We watched cab after cab pass us by. When her 
husband, who is white, went to hail one, well glory be, the cab stopped on a 
dime.

Often I would hold a business call with a vendor and later see the shock and 
astonishment register on their face that I meet them and they realize I 
am...black. What, was I not speaking in “urban dialect?” The number of 
assumptions people make about me are frustrating in their consistency: from the 
boldness of people wishing to touch my hair, to asking me if I’m biracial and 
inquiring after my taste in music (what, a woman of color can like ... 
Journey?). When it isn’t offensive it borders on the comical. I have learned to 
let the small stuff slide and prefer to educate with kindness rather than 
defensiveness. But I understand how for others, these indignities can get the 
hackles up.

Michelle Obama’s remarks are remarkable only in that these discussions rarely 
happen in public. It is essential that we address the horrors of blatant racism 
that results in death, incarceration and socioeconomic despair. But let’s 
remember the smaller things that profoundly affect quality of life in ways 
white America doesn’t see and often doesn’t deign to understand.

I’ve been rooting for Michelle Obama since 2008. There’s a bone deep honesty 
that she speaks with that keeps me grounded less I get caught up in sweeping 
narratives of what kind of America we think we are. She speaks the truth of 
these “little indignities” that I know too well.

I remember that 2008 New Yorker cover and I knew that the images were 
perpetuating a very specific stereotype and anti blackness by one deliberate 
representational change … the afro. Michelle Obama doesn’t have an afro, so why 
do that?

While it read small or harmless to a non black person, that change meant to 
communicate nasty biases about black women, and in doing so, sought to diminish 
and silence her and by proxy, all black women. I’ve had white people respond 
fearful and hostile because of my hair. I’ve had to temper my voice in meetings 
for fear I be understood as a stereotype, rather than a confident professional.

Michelle Obama’s hindsight so crystallizes points we constantly note about 
anti blackness and racism in America. I’ve been the only black woman in a room, 
party, meeting, dinner where I’ve had to negotiate my presence and footing with 
people projecting retrograde impressions and biases. “You’re so articulate” is 
never a compliment when uttered with such wide eye astonishment by white men 
and women. I hear and see and know that you’ve already underestimated me and my 
nappy hair.

It is a joy to watch black femininity negotiated in this space; Michelle Obama 
is representationally significant in that complexity of being a black woman 
with power in the 21st century.
