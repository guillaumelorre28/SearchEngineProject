It really is the political story of 2016. Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> waiting for the 
emphatic political validation that never quite arrives.


In the winter, the prime minister’s great gambit was to clear out the Senate 
and race to a double-dissolution election, which would deliver him the 
validation he required to be the prime minister he aspired to be.

Turnbull failed to clear out the Senate, and scraped back into office by a 
whisker.

In the final sitting week of 2016, all the choreography in the parliamentary 
precinct had been building up to Wednesday as Validation Day.

Wednesday would be the day Turnbull would finally declare victory over 2016, 
the year that kept threatening to smite him.

The V-Day plan was as follows.

Senate rejects backpacker tax deal in surprise defeat for Turnbull government

Turnbull would declare the government had successfully legislated the 
Australian Building and Construction Commission, which would of course justify 
that long winter election the prime minister had called, and very nearly lost. 
All could be finally well, because it had ended well.

The great symbolic victory was supposed to be sufficiently momentous to screen 
out inconvenient truths, such asthe fact the ABCC is now a quantifiably 
different proposition than the one that entered the parliament in 2013

 – and it comes with a bunch of undertakings attached to it that the government 
would never have proposed in a pink fit if it didn’t need this legislation 
passed for political reasons.

But despite having been generous enough to give away some of the dinner party 
cutlery, the kitchen sink, and some nice soft furnishings to secure the 
necessary legislation, the Senate wasn’t quite finished with the prime minister.

Freewheeling place that it is, the Senate delivered a rebuff.

Just moments after the ABCC landed, the backpacker tax entered the upper house 
for a second time set at 15%.It came out at 10.5% in a vote the government 
never saw coming.

The poor finance minister, Mathias Cormann, a disciplined political machine if 
there ever was one, was so discombobulated that he declared Labor would wear 
the backpacker tax like a “rose of crowns”.

Separately to the Senate’s Argentinian tango, a damaging leak emerged

 from Fairfax Media about internal deliberations within the government on new 
categories of visas. Who would know the motive of the leaker, but could it be 
that someone isn’t entirely happy with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton?

Because there wasn’t quite enough clutter in the landscape, a protest erupted 
in question time at 2pm, sufficiently robust to bring the parliament to a 
screaming halt.

The manager of government business, Christopher Pyne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/christopher-pyne>, smelled a rat, 
or perhaps a useful opportunity to pile diversion on diversion.

Pyne declared the protest the most serious incident at the parliament “since 
the riots organised by the ACTU in 1996”. He demanded the rapid identification 
of “the miscreants” who may have signed the disruptors into the building.

Turnbull, for his part, pressed on with V-Day, chiding anyone with the 
temerity to point out it had become something of a hot mess.

Coalition's secret visa plan 'risks increasing violent extremism'

The validation day media conference, having been scheduled, was duly staged, 
and the victory was insufficiently acknowledged by the pitiless hacks with 
their notebooks, prompting a brief waft of prime ministerial regret, laced with 
the tiniest tinge of irony – or was it self-reproach?

“I regret it as a fact, some of you are being perhaps a little less 
optimistic, less filled with a spirit of innovation and agility that is so 
fundamental to our success in the 21st century,” Turnbull told the assembled 
knockers after being on the receiving end of questions not entirely to his 
liking.

It remained, Turnbull insisted, a good day, everything being relative. The 
ABCC was through the parliament. “I believe what we have produced here is going 
to make a fundamental change for the better in the construction sector, in our 
whole economy, this is a fundamental economic reform.

“It is a great day for Australian families, for Australian jobs, and for the 
economic growth on which all of our aspirations depend.”

The prime minister has developed a habit of smiling into the adversity that 
now hurls itself in his direction thick and fast – a fixed smile through 
mid-air turbulence that never quite creeps to the eyes.
