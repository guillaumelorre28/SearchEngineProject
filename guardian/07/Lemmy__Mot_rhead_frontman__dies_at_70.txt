The band announced on their Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/OfficialMotorhead> that Lemmy learned of the disease 
on 26 December, and was at home when he died.

Lemmy <https://www.theguardian.com/music/lemmy>, born Ian Fraser Kilmister, 
formed Motörhead in 1975 and was its only constant member, as singer and 
bassist. The band released 23 studio albums and are best known for their 1980 
single Ace of Spades.

The band requested fans “play Lemmy’s music LOUD. Have a drink or few. Share 
stories. Celebrate the LIFE this lovely, wonderful man celebrated so vibrantly 
himself.

“There is no easy way to say this … our mighty, noble friend Lemmy passed away 
today after a short battle with an extremely aggressive cancer. He had learned 
of the disease on 26 December, and was at home, sitting in front of his 
favourite video game from The Rainbow which had recently made it’s way down the 
street, with his family.

“We cannot begin to express our shock and sadness; there aren’t words.

“We will say more in the coming days, but for now, please … play Motörhead 
loud, play Hawkwind loud, play Lemmy’s music LOUD. Have a drink or few.

“Share stories.

“Celebrate the LIFE this lovely, wonderful man celebrated so vibrantly himself.

“HE WOULD WANT EXACTLY THAT.”

The band signed off: “Ian ‘Lemmy’ Kilmister

“1945 -2015

“Born to lose, lived to win.”

Tributes poured in for the heavy metal giant, with Ozzy Osbourne tweeting: 
“Lost one of my best friends, Lemmy, today. He will be sadly missed. He was a 
warrior and a legend. I will see you on the other side.”

Former Motörhead drummer Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor died aged 61 in November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/former-motorhead-drummer-phil-taylor-dies-aged-61>
. “Fast” Eddie Clarke, who becomes the last surviving member of the band’s most 
famous lineup, wrote on Facebook: “I have just been told that Lemmy has passed 
away in LA. Like Phil, he was like a brother to me. I am devastated. We did so 
much together, the three of us.

“The world seems a really empty place right now. I am having trouble finding 
the words … He will live on in our hearts. RIP Lemmy!”

Lemmy’s public struggles with illness intensified in recent years. The singer 
underwent surgery to have an implantable defibrillator placed in his chest in 
2013, and has cancelled shows in recent years due to exhaustion and a haematoma.

The band had been scheduled to tour the UK and France in early 2016.

Lemmy was born in Burslem, Staffordshire, on Christmas Eve in 1945. His 
musical career began in the early 1960s and he was, for a time,a roadie for 
Jimi Hendrix 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motorheads-lemmy-kilmister-on-life-as-jimi-hendrixs-roadie-20100325>
. He played in several rock bands, including the Rockin’ Vickers, Sam Gopal and 
Hawkwind, before founding Motörhead (originally named Bastard).

Lemmy: ‘Apparently I am still indestructible’

He wrote in his autobiography, White Line Fever, that he had been fired from 
Hawkwind for “doing the wrong drugs”.

Motörhead’s loud, fast style was a pioneering force in heavy metal. Lemmy’s 
vocal growl and aggressive bass playing has been emulated by countless other 
bands, but the singer joked that he largely learned on the job,telling 
<http://www.spin.com/2012/10/lemmy-motorhead-life-metallica-interview/> Spin in 
2012 that “the volume’s loud so nobody really notices that much”.

The band’s highest-rating record was the live album No Sleep ’Til Hammersmith, 
which peaked at number one on the UK album charts – a testament to the band’s 
crushing onstage performances.

Other highlights from Motörhead’s extensive discography include their second 
and third albums, Overkill and Bomber, both recorded in 1979, and several 
high-rating singles in the early 1980s. The Ace of Spades album reached number 
four in the UK charts, and the single number 15.

Lemmy from Motörhead is dead: and the internet pays tribute

The band’s early years are credited with laying the ground for thrash and 
speed metal, but Lemmy consistently refused to categorise their music as either 
punk or metal, often playing to audiences of both genres.

Despite the band’s success, Lemmy said in interviews over the years that he 
had made more money from writing Osbourne’s 1991 hit Mama I’m Coming Home than 
from the entire Motörhead catalogue.

He told the Guardian earlier this year: “I didn’t really want to be in the 
lifestyle without the music. And I didn’t want to be in the music without the 
lifestyle.”


Among those to pay tribute to Lemmy after his death was announced were 
Megadeth founder Dave Mustaine, Gene Simmons, the Kiss frontman, and Motley 
Crue’s Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx, and rapper Ice T.

Bernie Marsden of Whitesnake tweeted: “Spent many a evening chatting with him, 
especially about Hendrix! A great man. RIP x.”

James Kottak of the Scorpions said Lemmy was “a true friend … the real deal … 
RIP you will rock & roll forever”.

Geezer Butler, founding bassist of Black Sabbath, said: “Very sad to hear of 
Lemmy’s passing. We’ve lost a true, true legend. RIP.”

British music journalist Mark Beech tweeted that Lemmy had told him: “I will 
be killed by death. I might be killed by too much booze, women or music, but 
it’s not a bad way to die.”
