The Red Shoes 
London and Plymouth

Matthew Bourne’s latest production promises to be more Powell and Pressburger 
than Hans Christian Andersen. Love, power and the obsessional vocation of dance 
are rich themes for Bourne, although the film’s original cast of Moira Shearer, 
Leonid Massine et al will be a hard act to follow.

Hansel and Gretel
Edinburgh, Glasgow, and touring

Christopher Hampson’s 2013 ballet has become a nice addition to the Christmas 
repertory. It plays safe with the more gruesome elements of the tale (there are 
no delinquent parents here) and it pretties up the action with sparkly 
divertissements. But the story races along with wit and invention, and the 
witch is a properly frightening, cannibalistic crone worthy of Roald Dahl.
From 8-31 December, Edinburgh Festival Theatre. Tour continues at Glasgow

Will Tuckett’s Nutcracker
Canary Wharf, London

This isn’t quite the world’s first immersive ballet, as its publicity claims 
(Dutch National Ballet and the National Ballet of Canada got there first), but 
Tuckett’s fertile imagination is likely to make it an outstanding one. Staged 
in a custom-built venue, the production invites its audience to become 
participants, walking through the action and even talking to the performers in 
ballet’s foremost Christmas fantasy. The excellent Adam Cooper takes the role 
of Drosselmeyer, the magician in charge of proceedings.

Traditional Nutcrackers
Nationwide

For those who prefer to experience their Christmas Nutcracker from the safety 
of the auditorium, there are tried and trusted productions to choose from. The 
Royal Ballet’s is the most opulently traditional; Birmingham Royal Ballet’s has 
a slightly more adult storyline and better conjuring tricks, while English 
National Ballet’s has the most blizzardy of all the snow scenes. All 
productions, of course, come with the Tchaikovsky score that has made the 
ballet such an enduring Christmas classic.
From 23 November-12 January, Royal Opera House <http://www.roh.org.uk>, 
London. From 25 November-13 December,Birmingham Hippodrome

The Wolf and Peter 
Birmingham, Newcastle and Bray

As its title suggests, this clever production takes the viewpoint of the wolf 
in retelling the familiar story and turns the villainous beast into a comic, 
breakdancing character with attitude. Pianist Conor Linehan plays his own music 
live on the stage, and David Bolger’s choreography promises a funny, 
imaginative, but also moving experience for children aged six and upwards.
