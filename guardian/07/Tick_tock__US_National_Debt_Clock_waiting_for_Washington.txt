Talks on raising the debt ceiling may have stalled in Washington, but the 
famous National Debt Clock on Time Square is poised like a coiled spring. Now 
all it needs is for the politicians to get their act together.

The clock is managed by New York real estate developer Durst Oganization Inc., 
which first installed an electronic screen displaying the debt in 1989 in the 
hope that the glare of public attention might force Washington to cut the 
deficit, then a mere $2.7tn (Â£1.64tn).

The clock, on autopilot but evaluated weekly by human beings, is well-prepared 
for many scenarios, Durst spokesman Jordan Barowitztold the Wall Street 
Journal's Mary Pilon

.

In 2008, an extra digit had to be added to the clock

 when US debt broke through $10tn for the first time, with the space for the $ 
sign elbowed out to make way. A $ sign was added manually

"If the debt keeps rising, so will the clock. And it's not difficult for us to 
stop the clock if we need to," Barowitz said.

Now at $14tn-plus, the clock can also tick down, Barowitz said. But it can't 
be bought - "The debt itself would have to go down," Barowitz said. "We're not 
actually responsible for making those decisions."
