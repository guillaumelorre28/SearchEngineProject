Thanks for joining us on the Guardian's papal liveblog

Adam Brereton

And that brings a week of live coverage of Pope Francis’s Cuba-US tour to a 
close. It has been such a privilege to bring you rolling coverage of this 
historic tour.

From Havana to Philadelphia <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia>
, the pope has preached a pastor’s message of forgiveness and mercy. He 
encouraged Catholics above all to open their hearts to immigrants, whose 
culture, the pontiff said, was a gift that would renew the US.

He often spoke off-the-cuff and made it a priority to meet schoolchildren and 
people living with a disability. He went to the margins, spending time in a 
prison and in underprivileged neighborhoods of New York City. The pontiff was 
bored only during the official events and soaring liturgies, renewing himself 
by coming into contact with ordinary Cubans and Americans.

In all, it was an atypical tour for a world leader. The first fruits of 
Francis’s pilgrimage – aside from the possibility of rapprochement in Cuba and 
Colombia – will likely happen out of the public eye, in the quiet interior 
lives of those individuals who saw him speak, and the families and communities 
he toured.

On a personal note, thanks to Guardian US for their hospitality and to my 
colleagues around the world whose contributions to the liveblog were so 
special. And to you, our readers! I hope you’ve been as inspired by this trip 
as I have.

exhausted, but smiling. The doors close. Now home.

Pope Francis concludes US tour, leaves behind strong statements on 
immigration, climate, family

Adam Brereton

Pope Francis has departed the US, concluding a tour of three cities – New 
York, Washington DC andPhiladelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia> – defined by soaring 
statements on immigration, climate change, mercy and the importance of families.

The pontiff boarded the chartered Alitalia jet known as Shepherd One at 7.30pm 
and waved goodbye from the window after a dramatic final day which brought 
Philadelphia to a standstill.

His tour marked several firsts for the papacy: Francis was the first pope to 
address a joint sitting of US Congress. He also proclaimed Junipero Serra, a 
controversial 18th Spaniard who conducted missionary work in California, a 
saint in the first canonization to occur on US soil.

US President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and UN Secretary-General 
Ban Ki Moon received the pontiff warmly during his official duties. Speaker 
John Boehner, moved to tears during the pope’s address to congress, resigned 
soon afterwards.

Francis was received with adulation among ordinary Americans, who gathered to 
cheer in several popemobile-led parades. The Hispanic community, prisoners, 
undocumented workers and other marginalized groups were given special attention 
by the pontiff, as were children and Americans with disabilities.

Tight security was an annoyance for both the pope and his fans, preventing 
many from attending events for which they had tickets.

Protests also attended the pope’s engagements: arrests were made over women’s 
ordination in Washington DC and many Native Americans were outraged that Serra, 
described as a brutal colonizer, was made a saint.


Much-anticipated statements on climate change and immigration were 
well-received by Democrats; Republican Catholics were left in the cold as 
Francis neglected to give explicit approval to their traditional pro-life 
causes.

The pope met victims of child abuse in Philadelphia and pledged to bring 
clerics who committed abuse to justice.

The tour concluded with a mass for an estimated crowd of between 800,000 and 
one million people on Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

The congregation at the pope’s final mass didn’t seem to reach the one million 
figure organizers had hoped:

In the wash-up, I’d expect there would be harsh words for those responsible 
for thousands of Catholics with tickets being denied entry. Overzealous 
security has been a hallmark of this US tour just as much as Pope Francis’s 
requests that crowds pray for him:

outside security for Papal Mass No jumbotrons. We can't see/hear anything.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> turns as he is 
about to be hustled out the door by his posse and goes back into people’s pope 
mode. He kisses and blesses children, shakes hands, smiles and talks through 
his translator. At every point during this tour when he’s been listless, a few

Pope Francis's farewell: do not let your enthusiasm run dry, evil never has 
the last word
 Pope Francis shakes hands with an inmate as he meets with prisoners at 
Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia, 27 September 2015. 
Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters 
My days with you have been brief. But they have been days of great grace for 
me and, I pray, for you too. Please know that as I prepare to leave, I do so 
with a heart full of gratitude and hope. I am grateful to all of you and to the 
many others who worked so hard to make my visit possible and to prepare for the 
World Meeting of Families. In a particular way I thank Archbishop Chaput and 
the Archdiocese ofPhiladelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia>, the civil authorities, the 
organizers, and all the many volunteers and benefactors who assisted in ways 
large and small.

I also thank the families who shared their witness during the meeting. It is 
not so easy to speak openly of one’s life journey! But their honesty and 
humility before the Lord and each of us showed the beauty of family life in all 
its richness and diversity. I pray that our days of prayer and reflection on 
the importance of the family for a healthy society will inspire families to 
continue to strive for holiness and to see the Church as their constant 
companion, whatever the challenges they may face. At the end of my visit, I 
would also like to thank all those who prepared for my stay in the Archdioceses 
of Washington and New York.

It was particularly moving for me to canonize Saint Junípero Serra, who 
reminds us all of our call to be missionary disciples, and I was also very 
moved to stand with my brothers and sisters of other religions at Ground Zero, 
that place which speaks so powerfully of the mystery of evil. Yet we know with 
certainty that evil never has the last word, and that, in God’s merciful plan, 
love and peace triumph over all. Mr Vice-President, I ask you to renew my 
gratitude to President Obama and to the Members of Congress, together with the 
assurance of my prayers for the American people.

This land has been blessed with tremendous gifts and opportunities. I pray 
that you may all be good and generous stewards of the human and material 
resources entrusted to you. I thank the Lord that I was able to witness the 
faith of God’s people in this country, as manifested in our moments of prayer 
together and evidenced in so many works of charity.

Jesus says in the Scriptures: “Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of 
the least of these my brethren, you did it to me”. Your care for me and your 
generous welcome are a sign of your love for Jesus and your faithfulness to 
him. So too is your care for the poor, the sick, the homeless and the 
immigrant, your defense of life at every stage, and your concern for family 
life. In all of this, you recognize that Jesus is in your midst and that your 
care for one another is care for Jesus himself.

As I leave, I ask all of you, especially the volunteers and benefactors who 
assisted with the World Meeting of Families: do not let your enthusiasm for 
Jesus, his Church, our families, and the broader family of society run dry. May 
our days together bear fruit that will last, generosity and care for others 
that will endure! Just as we have received so much from God – gifts freely 
given us, and not of our own making – so let us freely give to others in return.

Dear friends, I embrace all of you in the Lord and I entrust you to the 
maternal care of Mary Immaculate, Patroness of the United States. I will pray 
for you and your families, and I ask you, please, to pray for me. May God bless 
you all. God bless America!

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> takes the papal 
Fiat to his final appointment, a meeting with around 500 organizers, volunteers 
and benefactors of the World Meeting of Families. They’ll be eager to see him; 
they were unable to attend the mass because they were assembled at the airport 
to farewell the pope before he departs.

The pope will give a short address. Vice President Joe Biden will farewell 
Francis from the US.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> still has one 
more engagement before he leaves the US. He’ll speak soon to organisers and 
volunteers of the World Meeting of Families.

In the meantime, here’s some of the many cartoons from the pope’s US tour.

AP is reporting 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:e900c02564194d77bcb6c06bf38b76c3> 
that the heavy security in Philadelphia killed off trade for local businesses 
on what should have been a busy weekend:

With sales down more than 50 percent, Robek’s, a juice and smoothie shop, 
decided to close early Sunday.

Manager Dave Deener blamed the intense security, including concrete barriers 
and a vehicle checkpoint near the entrance. National Guard troops and a police 
officer sat on folding chairs nearby.

“It’s awful. Everybody got scared off because of the security detail,” he said.

Center City hotel rooms went unfilled, and tables could be had at some of the 
city’s trendiest restaurants. On normally bustling South Street, bars, 
restaurants, sneaker stores and smoke shops — usually filled on weekends with 
city residents, suburban gawkers and tourists — were empty.

And that brings a week of live coverage of Pope Francis’s Cuba-US tour to a 
close. It has been such a privilege to bring you rolling coverage of this 
historic tour.

From Havana to Philadelphia <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia>
, the pope has preached a pastor’s message of forgiveness and mercy. He 
encouraged Catholics above all to open their hearts to immigrants, whose 
culture, the pontiff said, was a gift that would renew the US.

He often spoke off-the-cuff and made it a priority to meet schoolchildren and 
people living with a disability. He went to the margins, spending time in a 
prison and in underprivileged neighborhoods of New York City. The pontiff was 
bored only during the official events and soaring liturgies, renewing himself 
by coming into contact with ordinary Cubans and Americans.

In all, it was an atypical tour for a world leader. The first fruits of 
Francis’s pilgrimage – aside from the possibility of rapprochement in Cuba and 
Colombia – will likely happen out of the public eye, in the quiet interior 
lives of those individuals who saw him speak, and the families and communities 
he toured.

On a personal note, thanks to Guardian US for their hospitality and to my 
colleagues around the world whose contributions to the liveblog were so 
special. And to you, our readers! I hope you’ve been as inspired by this trip 
as I have.

Pope Francis has departed the US, concluding a tour of three cities – New 
York, Washington DC andPhiladelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia> – defined by soaring 
statements on immigration, climate change, mercy and the importance of families.

The pontiff boarded the chartered Alitalia jet known as Shepherd One at 7.30pm 
and waved goodbye from the window after a dramatic final day which brought 
Philadelphia to a standstill.

His tour marked several firsts for the papacy: Francis was the first pope to 
address a joint sitting of US Congress. He also proclaimed Junipero Serra, a 
controversial 18th Spaniard who conducted missionary work in California, a 
saint in the first canonization to occur on US soil.

US President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and UN Secretary-General 
Ban Ki Moon received the pontiff warmly during his official duties. Speaker 
John Boehner, moved to tears during the pope’s address to congress, resigned 
soon afterwards.

Francis was received with adulation among ordinary Americans, who gathered to 
cheer in several popemobile-led parades. The Hispanic community, prisoners, 
undocumented workers and other marginalized groups were given special attention 
by the pontiff, as were children and Americans with disabilities.

Tight security was an annoyance for both the pope and his fans, preventing 
many from attending events for which they had tickets.

Protests also attended the pope’s engagements: arrests were made over women’s 
ordination in Washington DC and many Native Americans were outraged that Serra, 
described as a brutal colonizer, was made a saint.


Much-anticipated statements on climate change and immigration were 
well-received by Democrats; Republican Catholics were left in the cold as 
Francis neglected to give explicit approval to their traditional pro-life 
causes.

The pope met victims of child abuse in Philadelphia and pledged to bring 
clerics who committed abuse to justice.

The tour concluded with a mass for an estimated crowd of between 800,000 and 
one million people on Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

In the wash-up, I’d expect there would be harsh words for those responsible 
for thousands of Catholics with tickets being denied entry. Overzealous 
security has been a hallmark of this US tour just as much as Pope Francis’s 
requests that crowds pray for him:

short moments with the people recharges his batteries.

My days with you have been brief. But they have been days of great grace for 
me and, I pray, for you too. Please know that as I prepare to leave, I do so 
with a heart full of gratitude and hope. I am grateful to all of you and to the 
many others who worked so hard to make my visit possible and to prepare for the 
World Meeting of Families. In a particular way I thank Archbishop Chaput and 
the Archdiocese ofPhiladelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia>, the civil authorities, the 
organizers, and all the many volunteers and benefactors who assisted in ways 
large and small.

I also thank the families who shared their witness during the meeting. It is 
not so easy to speak openly of one’s life journey! But their honesty and 
humility before the Lord and each of us showed the beauty of family life in all 
its richness and diversity. I pray that our days of prayer and reflection on 
the importance of the family for a healthy society will inspire families to 
continue to strive for holiness and to see the Church as their constant 
companion, whatever the challenges they may face. At the end of my visit, I 
would also like to thank all those who prepared for my stay in the Archdioceses 
of Washington and New York.

It was particularly moving for me to canonize Saint Junípero Serra, who 
reminds us all of our call to be missionary disciples, and I was also very 
moved to stand with my brothers and sisters of other religions at Ground Zero, 
that place which speaks so powerfully of the mystery of evil. Yet we know with 
certainty that evil never has the last word, and that, in God’s merciful plan, 
love and peace triumph over all. Mr Vice-President, I ask you to renew my 
gratitude to President Obama and to the Members of Congress, together with the 
assurance of my prayers for the American people.

This land has been blessed with tremendous gifts and opportunities. I pray 
that you may all be good and generous stewards of the human and material 
resources entrusted to you. I thank the Lord that I was able to witness the 
faith of God’s people in this country, as manifested in our moments of prayer 
together and evidenced in so many works of charity.

Jesus says in the Scriptures: “Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of 
the least of these my brethren, you did it to me”. Your care for me and your 
generous welcome are a sign of your love for Jesus and your faithfulness to 
him. So too is your care for the poor, the sick, the homeless and the 
immigrant, your defense of life at every stage, and your concern for family 
life. In all of this, you recognize that Jesus is in your midst and that your 
care for one another is care for Jesus himself.

As I leave, I ask all of you, especially the volunteers and benefactors who 
assisted with the World Meeting of Families: do not let your enthusiasm for 
Jesus, his Church, our families, and the broader family of society run dry. May 
our days together bear fruit that will last, generosity and care for others 
that will endure! Just as we have received so much from God – gifts freely 
given us, and not of our own making – so let us freely give to others in return.

Dear friends, I embrace all of you in the Lord and I entrust you to the 
maternal care of Mary Immaculate, Patroness of the United States. I will pray 
for you and your families, and I ask you, please, to pray for me. May God bless 
you all. God bless America!

and benefactors of the World Meeting of Families. They’ll be eager to see him; 
they were unable to attend the mass because they were assembled at the airport 
to farewell the pope before he departs.

The pope will give a short address. Vice President Joe Biden will farewell 
Francis from the US.

This is such a poignant cartoon, re: Pope Francis and right-wing "principles."

AP is reporting 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:e900c02564194d77bcb6c06bf38b76c3> 
that the heavy security in Philadelphia killed off trade for local businesses 
on what should have been a busy weekend:

With sales down more than 50 percent, Robek’s, a juice and smoothie shop, 
decided to close early Sunday.

Manager Dave Deener blamed the intense security, including concrete barriers 
and a vehicle checkpoint near the entrance. National Guard troops and a police 
officer sat on folding chairs nearby.

“It’s awful. Everybody got scared off because of the security detail,” he said.

Center City hotel rooms went unfilled, and tables could be had at some of the 
city’s trendiest restaurants. On normally bustling South Street, bars, 
restaurants, sneaker stores and smoke shops — usually filled on weekends with 
city residents, suburban gawkers and tourists — were empty.
