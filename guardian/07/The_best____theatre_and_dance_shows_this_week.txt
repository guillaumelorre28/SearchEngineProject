Five of the best… theatre shows this week

1 Dead Funny
Terry Johnson’s 1994 comedy about the members of the Dead Funny Society, an 
appreciation club devoted to the all-time greats of British comedy, is by turns 
both monstrously funny and painfully sad. The play takes place in the living 
room of Eleanor and Richard, a couple whose marriage has long been sterile, and 
where a meeting has been called following the death of Benny Hill. The mixture 
of farce and brutal emotional exposure is hard to navigate but Johnson and a 
cast that includes Katherine Parkinson ensure that this is in no danger of 
being a custard pie.
Vaudeville Theatre, WC2, to 4 Feb

2 Amadeus
Michael Longhurst’s revival of Peter Shaffer’s 1979 hit is all opulence and 
unabashed vulgarity. Adam Gillen is the prodigiously talented but charmless 
Mozart whose arrival threatens the pre-eminence of court composer Salieri (a 
compelling Lucian Msamati). The latter knows that his studious, painstaking 
compositions could easily be eclipsed by those of the young whippersnapper.
National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, Mon to 18 Mar

3 An Inspector Calls
Stephen Daldry’s reinvention of JB Priestley’s rep staple first lit up the 
National Theatre in 1992. In it, the mysterious inspector’s arrival disrupts 
the Birlings’ dinner party and implicates them all in the suicide of a young 
woman. Like Priestley himself, Daldry plays games with time, alighting on the 
fact that the play was written in 1945 but set in 1912 and intended as a 
message to the future.
Playhouse Theatre, WC2, to 4 Feb

4 What I Learned From Johnny Bevan
Luke Wright’s clever monologue was first seen in Edinburgh in 2015, but this 
affecting coming-of-age tale remains pertinent, particularly in the light of 
current Labour party woes. It charts the relationship of sheltered middle-class 
Nick who falls under the spell of charismatic Johnny Bevan at university, a 
young man confident that the socialist revolution is imminent. It’s a story of 
friendship and how easily ideals get lost along the way.
Colstock Hall, Colstock, Sat; Lakeside Arts Centre, Nottingham, Wed; Stamford 
Arts Centre, Thu; touring to 16 Dec

5 Cinderella: A Fairytale
Sally Cookson’s delightful take on Cinderella was first seen in Bristol in 
2011, and its success both there and in London, where it was nominated for an 
Olivier award, provided a rocket boost to Cookson’s career. Deservedly so: this 
is a wonderful ensemble show, and one that is genuinely enchanting.
Tobacco Factory, Bristol, Fri to 15 Jan
