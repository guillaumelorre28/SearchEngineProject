Lauren Gambino

Once again, Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
stole the show without actually appearing on the show.

During Fox News’ two-hour voter summit on Wednesday night, the four Republican 
hopefuls working frantically to keep pace with Trump took turns pitching 
themselves as the best alternative to the billionaire frontrunner.

Texas senator Ted Cruz positioned himself as the best general election 
candidate, citing polling that showed he would beat former secretary of state
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> should 
she capture the Democratic nomination.

“Donald consistently loses to Hillary. I consistently beat Hillary,” Cruz told 
Fox News’ Megyn Kelly during the live interview in Houston.

“And so the question right now is how do we prevent nominating a candidate who 
loses the general election – or, for that matter, if Donald wins the general 
election, who the heck knows what he’d do as president?”

The final question of the night, asked by a student at the University of 
Texas, focuses on economic policy. “How, specifically, you would explain to 
college students how conservative economic policies are much better for their 
futures?”

Socialism is “a utopian dream”, Carson says.

On the issue of releasing his taxes, Carson says:

I’d be happy to! I have nothing to hide.

“I did a one-hour foreign policy town hall,” Ben Carson says of his foreign 
policy knowledge. “I just say, to any reporter who asks me that, I say, ask me 
a foreign policy question.”

“I can go into great depth about Islam, where it came from...”

Megyn Kelly interrupts, asking Carson the difference between Sunni and Shia 
Islam.

“One is much more fundamental, and one is much more secular,” Carson says, 
inaccurately. “The Sunnis are much more fundamental, the Shias are much more 
secular.”
Scott Bixby (@scottbix) 
Ben Carson just described Iran as "much more Sunni" as evidence of his foreign 
policy knowledge.

Ben Carson tells an African American voter - and director of black outreach 
for the Texas Republican party - that to secure African American voters, he 
won’t change his message.

“I don’t change my message because I’m in front of one group or another 
group,” Carson says, to applause. “Our faith and our families are the two 
strong pillars that got us through slavery and Jim Crow and segregation and 
racism.”

“Seventy-three percent of African American babies are born out of wedlock... 
that’s very problematic,” Carson says. Breaking the cycle of poverty, he says, 
is the most important way to help fight that statistic.

A voter asks about the social liberalism of young voters, and whether they can 
fit in the Republican Party.

“There should be room for them,” Ben Carson says. “Young people need to 
recognize that... we’re looking at people who are gonna be looking for ways to 
ameliorate that financial deterioration.”

“That’s hogwash,” Ben Carson says of Barack Obama living a black experience. 
“I said that his experience in growing up is vastly different from most African 
Americans, and I don’t know who could deny that.”

“It’s basically the media doing what they always do - they take a simple 
statement that I make... and on and on they go with their just ridiculous 
analysis, which is only for one purpose, and that’s to ridicule me,” Carson 
says.

Quoting a piece from National Review in which being a Christian candidate 
means being “humble and self-aware enough to admit when your vanity is hurting 
the country.”

“My thoughts are that the political establishments, the pundits, like to think 
that they are in control, and truly, we the people should be in control,” 
Carson says. “I believe that there is still a possibility that we can break the 
spell that they have over the people.”

“Why do I stay here? It’s sort of like losing a child,” Carson says, before 
somewhat bafflingly comparing this campaign to a marionette. “We’re gonna 
continue to go down the same road, and we’re not gonna support that.”

Ben Carson joins Megyn Kelly's voter summer

In reality, as opposed to via satellite! The way Fox News marketed this thing, 
every candidate exceptDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> was going to be in-studio for 
a question-intensive grilling by the voting public. It’s turning out to be 
15-minute Skype sessions featuring three or four questions from locals and one 
or two follow-ups from host Megyn Kelly.

“Everybody wants to call the game after the first inning - I think we have a 
ways to go yet,” Ben Carson says.

“Gitmo is not just a prison for radical terrorists - it’s an important naval 
facility, and we’re keeping it,”Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> says of closing the 
Guantanamo Bay facility wherein terrorism suspects have been kept for years 
without charge. “If we capture any of these terrorists alive, they are going to 
Guantanamo.”


“I never talk about interrogation techniques, because it gives the terrorists 
the opportunity to train to evade them,” Rubio says, when Kelly asks him about 
so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. “You can’t always use the exact 
same tactics [as a trial].”

A voter asks: “Do you think the rhetoric of this campaign season - 
particularly the anti-Muslim rhetoric - has increased” Islamophobia?

“No one should be discriminated against in American for their religion or 
their faith,” Rubio says.

On whether this campaign’s rhetoric has increased Islamophobia, Rubio hedges. 
“When you’re president of the united states, you have an enormous megaphone... 
we should not be pitting and dividing Americans against each other.”

We’re winding up the live blog for today – console yourself with Lauren Gambino
’s report from the Fox News voter summit and the knowledge that we’ll be back 
tomorrow with more. Thanks for reading:

Ted Cruz: 'Who knows what the heck Donald Trump would do as president?'
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/ted-cruz-who-knows-heck-president-donald-trump-fox-news-voter-summit> 
Once again, Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
stole the show without actually appearing on the show.

During Fox News’ two-hour voter summit on Wednesday night, the four Republican 
hopefuls working frantically to keep pace with Trump took turns pitching 
themselves as the best alternative to the billionaire frontrunner.

Texas senator Ted Cruz positioned himself as the best general election 
candidate, citing polling that showed he would beat former secretary of state
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> should 
she capture the Democratic nomination.

“Donald consistently loses to Hillary. I consistently beat Hillary,” Cruz told 
Fox News’ Megyn Kelly during the live interview in Houston.

“And so the question right now is how do we prevent nominating a candidate who 
loses the general election – or, for that matter, if Donald wins the general 
election, who the heck knows what he’d do as president?”
 
The final question of the night, asked by a student at the University of 
Texas, focuses on economic policy. “How, specifically, you would explain to 
college students how conservative economic policies are much better for their 
futures?”

Socialism is “a utopian dream”, Carson says.

On the issue of releasing his taxes, Carson says:

I’d be happy to! I have nothing to hide.
 
“I did a one-hour foreign policy town hall,” Ben Carson says of his foreign 
policy knowledge. “I just say, to any reporter who asks me that, I say, ask me 
a foreign policy question.”

“I can go into great depth about Islam, where it came from...”

Megyn Kelly interrupts, asking Carson the difference between Sunni and Shia 
Islam.

“One is much more fundamental, and one is much more secular,” Carson says, 
inaccurately. “The Sunnis are much more fundamental, the Shias are much more 
secular.”
Scott Bixby (@scottbix) 
Ben Carson just described Iran as "much more Sunni" as evidence of his foreign 
policy knowledge.

Ben Carson tells an African American voter - and director of black outreach 
for the Texas Republican party - that to secure African American voters, he 
won’t change his message.

“I don’t change my message because I’m in front of one group or another 
group,” Carson says, to applause. “Our faith and our families are the two 
strong pillars that got us through slavery and Jim Crow and segregation and 
racism.”

“Seventy-three percent of African American babies are born out of wedlock... 
that’s very problematic,” Carson says. Breaking the cycle of poverty, he says, 
is the most important way to help fight that statistic.
 
A voter asks about the social liberalism of young voters, and whether they can 
fit in the Republican Party.

“There should be room for them,” Ben Carson says. “Young people need to 
recognize that... we’re looking at people who are gonna be looking for ways to 
ameliorate that financial deterioration.”
 
“That’s hogwash,” Ben Carson says of Barack Obama living a black experience. 
“I said that his experience in growing up is vastly different from most African 
Americans, and I don’t know who could deny that.”

“It’s basically the media doing what they always do - they take a simple 
statement that I make... and on and on they go with their just ridiculous 
analysis, which is only for one purpose, and that’s to ridicule me,” Carson 
says.
 
Quoting a piece from National Review in which being a Christian candidate 
means being “humble and self-aware enough to admit when your vanity is hurting 
the country.”

“My thoughts are that the political establishments, the pundits, like to think 
that they are in control, and truly, we the people should be in control,” 
Carson says. “I believe that there is still a possibility that we can break the 
spell that they have over the people.”

“Why do I stay here? It’s sort of like losing a child,” Carson says, before 
somewhat bafflingly comparing this campaign to a marionette. “We’re gonna 
continue to go down the same road, and we’re not gonna support that.”
 
In reality, as opposed to via satellite! The way Fox News marketed this thing, 
every candidate exceptDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> was going to be in-studio for 
a question-intensive grilling by the voting public. It’s turning out to be 
15-minute Skype sessions featuring three or four questions from locals and one 
or two follow-ups from host Megyn Kelly.

“Everybody wants to call the game after the first inning - I think we have a 
ways to go yet,” Ben Carson says.
 
The final question, again, on tax returns.

“We were planning today, tomorrow, in the next few days,” Rubio says. “I’ll 
release ‘em - they’re not very complicated... they’re not very exotic.”
 
“Gitmo is not just a prison for radical terrorists - it’s an important naval 
facility, and we’re keeping it,”Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> says of closing the 
Guantanamo Bay facility wherein terrorism suspects have been kept for years 
without charge. “If we capture any of these terrorists alive, they are going to 
Guantanamo.”


“I never talk about interrogation techniques, because it gives the terrorists 
the opportunity to train to evade them,” Rubio says, when Kelly asks him about 
so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. “You can’t always use the exact 
same tactics [as a trial].”
 
A voter asks: “Do you think the rhetoric of this campaign season - 
particularly the anti-Muslim rhetoric - has increased” Islamophobia?

“No one should be discriminated against in American for their religion or 
their faith,” Rubio says.

On whether this campaign’s rhetoric has increased Islamophobia, Rubio hedges. 
“When you’re president of the united states, you have an enormous megaphone... 
we should not be pitting and dividing Americans against each other.”

Sara, a science professor, asks about stem-cell research: “What are your 
posititons on stem-cell research?”

“I don’t view it as that kind of choice,” Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> says. “What I don’t support 
is anything leading to the creation of an industry in which embryos are being

being harvested.”
