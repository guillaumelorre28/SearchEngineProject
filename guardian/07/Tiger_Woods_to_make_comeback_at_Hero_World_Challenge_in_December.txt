Tiger Woods <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tigerwoods> is scheduled to 
make his long-awaited comeback to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge 
in the Bahamas next month.

Woods has not played since August 2015, and three weeks ago pulled out of the 
Safeway Open, claiming “my game is vulnerable and it’s not where it needs to 
be.” But in a press release on Tuesday, Woods, who has plummeted to No831 in 
the world rankings, said he would be back to play on 1 December.

“I am excited to make my return at the Hero World Challenge at Albany and play 
in this terrific tournament,” Woods said in the statement.

Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose and Jordan Spieth are also included in the 
18-player field, but world No1 Jason Day, who withdrew from his last two 
tournaments because of a back injury, is missing, and so is Rory McIlroy.

The tournament, which is operated by Woods’s charitable foundation, includes 
the defending champion, the reigning major winners, two tournament exemptions 
and the top players available from the world rankings on 26 September. Woods 
and Zach Johnson are this year’s exemptions.

“This is our 18th year, and every year we put together a top field that 
showcases the best golfers from the previous season,” Woods said. “Albany is an 
outstanding setting, and I can’t thank Hero MotoCorp enough for their support 
of the tournament and my foundation.”

Woods, who was ranked No1 in the world for a record 683 weeks, is four major 
championship victories short of Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18. Last month Woods 
told Charlie Rose that he was still chasing more major championship wins.

“Do you believe you’ll get 18 majors?” Rose asked. “To be honest with you, 
no,” Woods replied. “You don’t? You’ve accepted that?” Rose asked. “I’ve 
accepted I’m going to get more,” Woods responded.
