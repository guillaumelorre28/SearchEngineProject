It was the year Cadbury’s caused outrage among chocolate lovers by changing 
the recipe for its beloved Creme Egg, and fizzy drinks giant Coca-Cola was 
tricked into tweeting out large chunks of Hitler’s Mein Kampf.


But 2015 was mainly about Greece: Greece’s debt crisis, Greece’s referendum, 
Greece’s bailout, Greece’s election, Greece’s second election. At one point it 
really seemed that the battered country, which has been through so much, would 
finally crash out of the eurozone.

Of our 10 most popular stories during the year, seven were about Greece. Our 
coverage was dominated by our live business blog, in whichGraeme Wearden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemewearden> tirelessly documented the 
extraordinary events as they happened. Five of the blogs had more than 1m page 
views; two had more than 2m.


Based on the number of page views, here’s the full list of the 10 most popular 
stories from Guardian business in 2015.

1. Greece bailout deal agreed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live>

In a marathon Brussels summit lasting more than 16 hours - the longest in EU 
history - an agreement was finally reached that would lead to a third bailout 
forGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> and keep the country in 
the eurozone.

It was also a marathon Guardian live blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live>
, running for more than 26 hours, as we detailed the nail biting progress of 
the talks and prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s eventual agreement to a further 
swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms. (12-13 July)

 2. Greece rejects troika proposals

the nation’s creditors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/05/greeces-eurozone-future-in-the-balance-as-referendum-gets-under-way--eu-euro-bailout-live>

It was a sensational result, with the No campaign securing 61.31% of the vote. 
In a television address, Tsipras said the outcome showed that democracy could 
not be blackmailed.

Just a week later, however, he would be forced to accept bailout terms even 
more onerous that those the nation had so dramatically rejected. (6 July)

ina dire day for global markets on 29 August

5. Greece misses IMF payment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras>

Greece failed to make a €1.5bn payment to the International Monetary Fund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras>
, leaving it alone, insolvent and almost bankrupt after five years of €240bn 
(£170bn) in European bailouts dried up. It was the first advanced economy ever 
to fall in arrears to the IMF.

The long-running debt debacle left Greece without a financial lifeline after 
years of wrenching austerity, and represented a historic blow to a Europe 
committed to the irreversibility of its 16-year-old single currency. (1 July)

6. End of an era for Cadbury Creme Eggs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/12/shellshock-cadbury-comes-clean-on-creme-egg-chocolate-change>

Monday 12 January was a bad day for chocolate lovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/12/shellshock-cadbury-comes-clean-on-creme-egg-chocolate-change>
, as it was revealed that the shell of Cadbury Creme Eggs would no longer be 
made from Cadbury’s Dairy Milk chocolate but from “standard cocoa mix 
chocolate”.

7. Stock markets slide as Greek banks close 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-stock-markets-slide-capital-controls-banks-closed-live>

Amid shockwaves from the closure of Greek banks and the imposition of capital 
controls,stock markets tumbled around the world 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-stock-markets-slide-capital-controls-banks-closed-live>
.


On the eve of the expiry of Greece’s second bailout, Tsipras used a TV address 
to ask the shell-shocked Greek public to back his resistance to a new round of 
tough tax increases and spending cuts demanded by the troika.

Europe’s big guns lined up one after another to tell the Greeks unequivocally 
that voting No in Sunday’s referendum would mean saying goodbye to the euro. (
30 June)

8. Greek cash withdrawals restricted  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-emergency-liquidity-referendum-bailout-live>

Another dramatic Sunday, in which Tsipras announced the imposition of capital 
controls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-emergency-liquidity-referendum-bailout-live>
, meaning banks would not reopen after the weekend. Greeks were limited to 
taking out just €60 a day at cash machines.

The move came after the European central bank froze the emergency support 
offered to the Greek banking sector - two days after the Greek prime minister 
shocked Europe by calling a referendum. (29 June)


 9. Joseph Stiglitz votes Oxi  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum>

Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz captured the imagination with his column on how 
he would vote in the Greek referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum>
.

Neither alternative – approval or rejection of the troika’s terms – would be 
easy, he said, and both carried huge risks.


“But a yes vote would mean depression almost without end ... By contrast, a no 
vote would at least open the possibility that Greece, with its strong 
democratic tradition, might grasp its destiny in its own hands.” (29 June)

10. Greece’s third bailout agreed  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/15/greek-crisis-mps-bailout-imf-debt-relief-alexis-tsipras-live>

The Greek parliament took a crucial step towards a third bailout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/15/greek-crisis-mps-bailout-imf-debt-relief-alexis-tsipras-live>
 by approving the economic measures required by its lenders, even though the 
prime minister himself admitted many of the “harsh” measures would hurt the 
Greek economy. (16 July)
