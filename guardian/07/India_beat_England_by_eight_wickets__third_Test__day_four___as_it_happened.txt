So India go 2-0 up with two to play. England were behind in the game from the 
first morning, when they were reduced to 87 for four, and never recovered.

20th over: India 100-2 (Kohli 6, Parthiv 63) Parthiv biffs four more into the 
leg side off Rashid and tries to finish things off with another couple of big 
hits but can only pick out fielders. Two from the last means they’re nearly 
there, though. Three more needed.

19th over: India 93-2 (Kohli 4, Parthiv 58) Batty, who surely won’t be in the 
side in Mumbai, continues. Indeed there are plenty of selection issues for 
England to ponder over the next nine days. The batsmen milk a few singles and 
need just 10 more.

WICKET! Pujara c Root b Rashid 25 (India 88-2)

Pujara top-edges a sweep to square leg, which brings a micro-second of 
disappointed silence from the home fans in the stands before they realise that 
mean Virat Kohli will be coming out to the middle. The sight of India’s No3 
trudging off accompanied by wild cheering is a strange one.

17th over: India 88-1 (Pujara 25, Parthiv 57) Pujara times Batty all along the 
ground to cow corner for four, a glorious shot. A single from the last means he 
keeps the strike.

14th over: India 76-1 (Pujara 19, Parthiv 51) Rashid returns and Parthiv edges 
over Stokes at slip, with the all-rounder chasing all the way to the boundary, 
diving in an attempt to make the save and careering into the advertising 
hoardings, all in an attempt to save one run. Parthiv clubs the next over the 
top for six and chops for a single that takes him to 50 (off 39 balls), his 
first Test half-century since April 2004.

13th over: India 63-1 (Pujara 18, Parthiv 39) Stokes looks to bounce Parthiv, 
who IPLs the ball over Bairstow’s head with a neat uppercut. Just 40 more 
required now and you get the distinct sense now of a batting team really 
enjoying themselves and a fielding really not.

12th over: India 57-1 (Pujara 17, Parthiv 35) Moeen continues and Parthiv is 
uncharacteristically subdued. For a while. The last ball is a miserable 
dragged-down half-tracker and Parthiv carts him away to midwicket to bring up 
the 50 partnership (off just 62 deliveries).

10th over: India 48-1 (Pujara 15, Parthiv 29) Parthiv clips Moeen confidently 
through midwicket for four, taking him to 28 from 22 balls. Again there’s 
nothing from Moeen to unduly disturb the batsmen.

9th over: India 41-1 (Pujara 14, Parthiv 24) Parthiv has a wild slash as 
Stokes strays a little wide but connects only with Mohali air. No shortage of 
effort from the bowler.

8th over: India 41-1 (Pujara 14, Parthiv 23) Moeen Ali becomes the fifth 
England bowler to enter the fray. He beats Pujara’s outside edge with one that 
goes straight on but it’s an otherwise quiet start.

7th over: India 40-1 (Pujara 14, Parthiv 22) Ben Stokes gets the ball in his 
hand after tea and immediately thwacks Parthiv on the pad. Umpire Erasmus 
shakes his head but it looks very close. England review and the replays reveal 
a tiny nick off the inside edge. Parthiv celebrates the reprieve with a chop to 
third man for four. Seven runs off the over.

Rob Heath has a question for the Statsguru-literate: “Is this, by any chance, 
the highest aggregate of runs in a Test in which no player scored a 100?”

TEA: India 33-1

So India need just 70 more runs for a 2-0 series lead. Optimism for England 
comes from Robert Lewis: “As the Spanish have it: ‘si dos, pues tres? – ‘if 
two, why not three)‘ – or something very like it …”

6th over: India 33-1 (Pujara 13, Parthiv 16) Adil Rashid comes in for a twirl 
before tea. Pujara clubs a half-volley through the covers for four and a googly 
beats everything, trundling through for four byes. And that’s tea.

5th over: India 24-1 (Pujara 9, Parthiv 15) Anderson – 2-2-0-0 – continues and 
after three more dots, Pujara finally makes a dent in his figures with 
back-to-back boundaries crunched through point. Anderson responds with a short 
ball that Pujara just about manages to fend away.

4th over: India 16-1 (Pujara 1, Parthiv 15) Woakes comes round the wicket to 
Parthiv, who is giving every impression of wanting to get on with this. Indeed 
he’s able to shovel four through midwicket despite a short ball barely getting 
above knee height. And from the last he crashes a cut through backward point 
for four more.

“Following Lee Smith’s earlier comment about epic collapses not happening 
twice in the same day, he seems to have missedPakistan’s more than admirable 
effort in New Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/29/new-zealand-pull-off-last-gasp-test-win-over-pakistan-to-secure-series>
,” writes Phil Withall. “Three times in a day might be pushing it though.”

3rd over: India 8-1 (Pujara 1, Parthiv 7) Anderson sends down a cracking, 
lifting delivery that has Pujara dancing up on his toes and desperately fending 
outside off. England appeal and, once turned down, go upstairs for a review. 
It’s very close to the gloves … but close only counts with horseshoes and hand 
grenades, Gorilla.

“I think a word of appreciation should go to Western Australia who have 
performed the most Lankyesque of Lanks Ups,” writes Lee Smith. “Chasing 335 
they have evaporated from 222-4 to 235 all out in the space of nine overs. Of 
course that can’t happen twice in one day, India will have this sown up in 15 
overs.”

WICKET! Vijay c Root b Woakes 0 (England 7-1)

England have the start they needed. Vijay is straightened up by a delivery 
short of a length and sends a regulation edge high to Joe Root at second slip.

1st over: India 0-0 (Vijay 0, Parthiv 0) Anderson finds some significant 
lateral movement, with Vijay shouldering arms outside off and relieved to see 
the ball bounce an inch over off stump. A maiden to start the innings.

“Odd how much time is spent speculating over whether a side could reach 430 in 
a 4th innings to win, something that’s never happened once in almost a century 
and a half of Test cricket,” writes Ian Forth. “And yet getting a side out for 
under 100 last dig, something that happens quite frequently, prompts almost no 
such speculation.”

England 236 all out

Hameed ends up stranded on 59, with his effort and Root’s 78 earlier the only 
hefty contributions to England’s total. India need just 103 runs to win the 
match and take a 2-0 lead in the series.

WICKET! Anderson run out 5

Ashwin continues and Hameed again launches him over the top – this time the 
ball drops short of the midwicket boundary. But as the batsmen scamper back for 
a second, Jadeja’s throw from the deep is superb, Ashwin is lightning in 
shifting the ball back onto the stumps and Anderson is caught an inch short.

90th over: England 235-9 (Hameed 58, Anderson 5) Shami returns, and Hameed 
cleverly guides a wide one down to third man for four then clips into the leg 
side for a couple. His first 128 deliveries yielded 23 runs, the next 24 balls 
have brought 34. And he’s taken the England lead into three figures to boot.

89th over: England 228-9 (Hameed 51, Anderson 5) A huge six from Hameed to 
bring up his 50, slog-swept with real authority over midwicket. He follows it 
up with a rock-solid forward defensive. He takes a single off the next to give 
Anderson two balls to survive … and he does so, just. The last delivery from 
Ashwin ripped past the outside edge.

88th over: England 221-9 (Hameed 44, Anderson 5) Jadeja replaces Shami and 
Hameed is again on the offensive, slog-sweeping for four more then shovelling 
into the leg side for two. And again he takes a single off the last to keep the 
strike. This has been a really impressive effort from the youngster.

87th over: England 214-9 (Hameed 37, Anderson 5) Hello all. Ravi Ashwin 
returns and Hameed immediately thick-edges away for four down to third man then 
carts him over midwicket for four more. The effort of that slog-sweep has 
clearly caused him some discomfort on his injured finger but not enough to 
prevent him from taking a single off the penultimate ball of the over. Anderson 
survives the solitary delivery by playing and missing outside off.

86th over: England 205-9 (Hameed 28, Anderson 5) Shami is banging down some 
beauties. His first ball to Hameed moves fractionally away from the batsman and 
passes just wide of the bat, and not far from off stump either, an absolute 
cracker. The next is hooked for four, and then there’s that review, and 
Anderson survives a run-out near-thing as Hameed tries to retain the strike 
from the last ball. The drama!

Right, that’s it from me. Stick around on site for Vic Marks’ report and Ali 
Martin’s thoughts but from me, cheerio!
 
So India go 2-0 up with two to play. England were behind in the game from the 
first morning, when they were reduced to 87 for four, and never recovered.

Parthiv goes over the top of extra-cover for the four runs that take them to a 
comprehensive victory.
 
20th over: India 100-2 (Kohli 6, Parthiv 63) Parthiv biffs four more into the 
leg side off Rashid and tries to finish things off with another couple of big 
hits but can only pick out fielders. Two from the last means they’re nearly 
there, though. Three more needed.
 
19th over: India 93-2 (Kohli 4, Parthiv 58) Batty, who surely won’t be in the 
side in Mumbai, continues. Indeed there are plenty of selection issues for 
England to ponder over the next nine days. The batsmen milk a few singles and 
need just 10 more.
 
18th over: India 89-2 (Kohli 1, Parthiv 57) The India captain gets off the 
mark with a single.
 
Pujara top-edges a sweep to square leg, which brings a micro-second of 
disappointed silence from the home fans in the stands before they realise that 
mean Virat Kohli will be coming out to the middle. The sight of India’s No3 
trudging off accompanied by wild cheering is a strange one.
 
17th over: India 88-1 (Pujara 25, Parthiv 57) Pujara times Batty all along the 
ground to cow corner for four, a glorious shot. A single from the last means he 
keeps the strike.
 
16th over: India 83-1 (Pujara 20, Parthiv 57) Rashid continues but this is one 
of those occasions when no bowler really wants the ball in their hands. Two 
singles from the over.
 
15th over: India 81-1 (Pujara 19, Parthiv 56) Gareth Batty gets a bowl. 
Parthiv cuts for four. India need 22 more to win.
 
14th over: India 76-1 (Pujara 19, Parthiv 51) Rashid returns and Parthiv edges 
over Stokes at slip, with the all-rounder chasing all the way to the boundary, 
diving in an attempt to make the save and careering into the advertising 
hoardings, all in an attempt to save one run. Parthiv clubs the next over the 
top for six and chops for a single that takes him to 50 (off 39 balls), his 
first Test half-century since April 2004.
 
13th over: India 63-1 (Pujara 18, Parthiv 39) Stokes looks to bounce Parthiv, 
who IPLs the ball over Bairstow’s head with a neat uppercut. Just 40 more 
required now and you get the distinct sense now of a batting team really 
enjoying themselves and a fielding really not.
 
12th over: India 57-1 (Pujara 17, Parthiv 35) Moeen continues and Parthiv is 
uncharacteristically subdued. For a while. The last ball is a miserable 
dragged-down half-tracker and Parthiv carts him away to midwicket to bring up 
the 50 partnership (off just 62 deliveries).
 
11th over: India 51-1 (Pujara 16, Parthiv 30) Pujara brings up the India 50 
with a single bunted into the leg side.

10th over: India 48-1 (Pujara 15, Parthiv 29) Parthiv clips Moeen confidently 
through midwicket for four, taking him to 28 from 22 balls. Again there’s 
nothing from Moeen to unduly disturb the batsmen.

@John_Ashdown <https://twitter.com/John_Ashdown> If I've used Statsguru 
correctly, this should answer the question at 08:57:https://t.co/lV7mcKD8q1 
<https://t.co/lV7mcKD8q1>

So no.

9th over: India 41-1 (Pujara 14, Parthiv 24) Parthiv has a wild slash as 
Stokes strays a little wide but connects only with Mohali air. No shortage of 
effort from the bowler.
 
8th over: India 41-1 (Pujara 14, Parthiv 23) Moeen Ali becomes the fifth 
England bowler to enter the fray. He beats Pujara’s outside edge with one that 
goes straight on but it’s an otherwise quiet start.
 
7th over: India 40-1 (Pujara 14, Parthiv 22) Ben Stokes gets the ball in his 
hand after tea and immediately thwacks Parthiv on the pad. Umpire Erasmus 
shakes his head but it looks very close. England review and the replays reveal 
a tiny nick off the inside edge. Parthiv celebrates the reprieve with a chop to 
third man for four. Seven runs off the over.
 
And here’s the Spanish-literate Oliver Thorpe: “11 years since my last OBO 
contribution. The actual phrase is: ‘No hay dos sin tres’ – all good things 
come in threes. So my next input will be in 2027. Saludos from Madrid.”
 
Rob Heath has a question for the Statsguru-literate: “Is this, by any chance, 
the highest aggregate of runs in a Test in which no player scored a 100?”
 
So India need just 70 more runs for a 2-0 series lead. Optimism for England 
comes from Robert Lewis: “As the Spanish have it: ‘si dos, pues tres? – ‘if 
two, why not three)‘ – or something very like it …”
 
6th over: India 33-1 (Pujara 13, Parthiv 16) Adil Rashid comes in for a twirl 
before tea. Pujara clubs a half-volley through the covers for four and a googly 
beats everything, trundling through for four byes. And that’s tea.
 
5th over: India 24-1 (Pujara 9, Parthiv 15) Anderson – 2-2-0-0 – continues and 
after three more dots, Pujara finally makes a dent in his figures with 
back-to-back boundaries crunched through point. Anderson responds with a short 
ball that Pujara just about manages to fend away.
 
4th over: India 16-1 (Pujara 1, Parthiv 15) Woakes comes round the wicket to 
Parthiv, who is giving every impression of wanting to get on with this. Indeed 
he’s able to shovel four through midwicket despite a short ball barely getting 
above knee height. And from the last he crashes a cut through backward point 
for four more.

“Following Lee Smith’s earlier comment about epic collapses not happening 
twice in the same day, he seems to have missedPakistan’s more than admirable 
effort in New Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/29/new-zealand-pull-off-last-gasp-test-win-over-pakistan-to-secure-series>
,” writes Phil Withall. “Three times in a day might be pushing it though.”
 
3rd over: India 8-1 (Pujara 1, Parthiv 7) Anderson sends down a cracking, 
lifting delivery that has Pujara dancing up on his toes and desperately fending 
outside off. England appeal and, once turned down, go upstairs for a review. 
It’s very close to the gloves … but close only counts with horseshoes and hand 
grenades, Gorilla.

“I think a word of appreciation should go to Western Australia who have 
performed the most Lankyesque of Lanks Ups,” writes Lee Smith. “Chasing 335 
they have evaporated from 222-4 to 235 all out in the space of nine overs. Of 
course that can’t happen twice in one day, India will have this sown up in 15 
overs.”
 
2nd over: India 8-1 (Pujara 1, Parthiv 7) Parthiv had begun the over slashing 
through extra-cover for four then punching down the ground for three. Pujara 
gets off the mark with a single.
 
England have the start they needed. Vijay is straightened up by a delivery 
short of a length and sends a regulation edge high to Joe Root at second slip.
 
1st over: India 0-0 (Vijay 0, Parthiv 0) Anderson finds some significant 
lateral movement, with Vijay shouldering arms outside off and relieved to see 
the ball bounce an inch over off stump. A maiden to start the innings.

“Odd how much time is spent speculating over whether a side could reach 430 in 
a 4th innings to win, something that’s never happened once in almost a century 
and a half of Test cricket,” writes Ian Forth. “And yet getting a side out for 
under 100 last dig, something that happens quite frequently, prompts almost no 
such speculation.”
 
India have around 30 minutes to negotiate until tea, and should wrap this up 
comfortably in the evening session. Unless something rather exceptional happens 
…

One for the optimists, England have bowled out India in India for 100 or fewer 
twice before: Chennai 77 (83 all out) Mumbai 06 (100 all out)
 <https://twitter.com/Cricket_Ali/status/803510622348398593> November 29, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Cricket_Ali/status/803510622348398593>  
Hameed ends up stranded on 59, with his effort and Root’s 78 earlier the only 
hefty contributions to England’s total. India need just 103 runs to win the 
match and take a 2-0 lead in the series.
 
Ashwin continues and Hameed again launches him over the top – this time the 
ball drops short of the midwicket boundary. But as the batsmen scamper back for 
a second, Jadeja’s throw from the deep is superb, Ashwin is lightning in 
shifting the ball back onto the stumps and Anderson is caught an inch short.
 
90th over: England 235-9 (Hameed 58, Anderson 5) Shami returns, and Hameed 
cleverly guides a wide one down to third man for four then clips into the leg 
side for a couple. His first 128 deliveries yielded 23 runs, the next 24 balls 
have brought 34. And he’s taken the England lead into three figures to boot.
 
89th over: England 228-9 (Hameed 51, Anderson 5) A huge six from Hameed to 
bring up his 50, slog-swept with real authority over midwicket. He follows it 
up with a rock-solid forward defensive. He takes a single off the next to give 
Anderson two balls to survive … and he does so, just. The last delivery from 
Ashwin ripped past the outside edge.
 
88th over: England 221-9 (Hameed 44, Anderson 5) Jadeja replaces Shami and 
Hameed is again on the offensive, slog-sweeping for four more then shovelling 
into the leg side for two. And again he takes a single off the last to keep the 
strike. This has been a really impressive effort from the youngster.
 
87th over: England 214-9 (Hameed 37, Anderson 5) Hello all. Ravi Ashwin 
returns and Hameed immediately thick-edges away for four down to third man then 
carts him over midwicket for four more. The effort of that slog-sweep has 
clearly caused him some discomfort on his injured finger but not enough to 
prevent him from taking a single off the penultimate ball of the over. Anderson 
survives the solitary delivery by playing and missing outside off.
 
The players take drinks, and I’ll hand over to John Ashdown, who’ll see you 
through to the close of play. It’s been a thrill. Bye!
 
86th over: England 205-9 (Hameed 28, Anderson 5) Shami is banging down some 
beauties. His first ball to Hameed moves fractionally away from the batsman and 
passes just wide of the bat, and not far from off stump either, an absolute 
cracker. The next is hooked for four, and then there’s that review, and 
Anderson survives a run-out near-thing as Hameed tries to retain the strike 
from the last ball. The drama!
 
No, they’re not. Not even nearly.
