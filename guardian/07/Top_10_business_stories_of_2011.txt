The eurozone debt crisis dominated the business year in 2011, with the huge 
appetite among readers for every twist and turn of the unfolding crisis 
reflected in the popularity of our daily live blogs.

These accounted for five of our top 10 most-read stories last year, with 
business reporterGraeme Wearden providing minute-by-minute accounts of some of 
the most extraordinary and most chaotic days ever witnessed in the eurozone, 
from the Greek referendum that never was, to the 'will he, won't he?' 
resignation of Silvio Berlusconi.

Larry Elliott's grim warning that "the system is ready to blow" struck a real 
chord. Writing in the wake of the August riots, our economics editor warned 
that only a new way of managing the global economy could prevent more mayhem in 
the markets and on the streets. It's well worth another read as we head towards 
what will undoubtedly be another tumultous year.

In the meantime, 'Happy New Year' from all here at the guardian.co.uk business 
team.

1. European debt crisis spiralling out of control

 Business top 10 - 1 
The first week in November was a particularly grim time in the eurozone, as 
the sovereign crisis entered an alarming new phase.

The governments in Athens and Rome were in chaos and there was panic on world 
markets as Germany and France were reported to have begun preliminary talks on 
a breakup of the eurozone.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel's one-word summary of the situation - 
"unpleasant" - must qualify as one of the biggest understatements of the year.

2. Decline and fall of the American Empire

 Business top 10 - 2 
In June, economics editor Larry Elliott turned his attention to America, 
likening the world's most powerful economy to "Rome in 200AD or Britain on the 
eve of the first world war: an empire at the zenith of its power but with 
cracks beginning to show".

If the US is to avoid the same decline and fall as those empires, it must, 
Elliott wrote, "rediscover the qualities that originally made it great. That 
will not be easy."

3. Greek referendum cancelled amid chaos

 Top 10 business - new 3 
In one of the most remarkable days of the crisis to date, there was open 
warfare in the Greek cabinet as prime minister George Papandreou - facing a 
confidence vote the following evening - abandoned his controversial plans for a 
referendum on the Greek debt deal.

His hand was forced by finance minister Evangelos Venizelos, who said in an 
early-morning speech that the nation's eurozone membership was too important to 
risk.

As G20 leaders in Cannes pledged to prevent the breakup of the eurozone, the 
European Central Bank surprised the markets by cutting interest rates to 1.25%.

4. We've been warned: the system is ready to blow 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/aug/14/larry-elliott-global-financial-system>
 Business top 10 - 4 
In the wake of the August riots, Elliott outlined a grim future for a nation 
that has, for two centuries, been governed by the simple concept that tomorrow 
will be better than today.

"Black August has given us a glimpse of a dystopia, one in which the financial 
markets buckle and the cities burn. Like Scrooge, we have been shown what might 
be to come unless we change our ways."

But a crisis four decades in the making won't be solved overnight: "This is a 
system in deep trouble – it is waiting to blow."

5. Eurozone goes it alone with new treaty that excludes Britain 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/09/eurozone-countries-treaty-exclude-britain>
 Business top 10 - 5 
In December, Britain faced isolation in Europe after David Cameron vetoed a 
revision of the Lisbon treaty, prompting a majority of EU members to agree to 
draw up their own deal outside the architecture of the union.

It was, said chief political correspondent Nicholas Watt, one of the most 
significant developments in Britain's 38-year membership of the EU, as the 
prime minister vowed he would not allow a "treaty within a treaty" that would 
undermine the UK's position in the single market.

6. Wall Street shares slump as S&P downgrades US debt outlook

The full enormity of the European debt crisis finally hit home across the 
Atlantic, as Standard & Poor's fuelled fears of the contagion spreading with a 
strong warning about America's failure to tackle its budget deficit.

The ratings agency cut its long-term outlook for the world's most powerful 
economy from stable to negative for first time since Pearl Harbor was attacked 
70 years ago, sending shares falling heavily on Wall Street. The move was seen 
as a "shot across the bows" of bickering politicians in Washington.

7. Greek unity government talks end without agreement 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2011/nov/09/greece-prime-minister-italy-berlusconi-resigns>
 Business top 10 - 7 
The pressure was ratcheted up amid a real fear that the eurozone could 
collapse completely. Nerves were frayed further on reports that Germany and 
France were engaged in preliminary talks on the creation of a two-speed 
eurozone, with Merkel's party examining ways for countries to leave the union.

Italian bond yields surged to an alarming 7.5% and stock markets plunged 
around the world.

Greece was locked in political limbo - Papandreou told the nation he would 
step aside to allow a unity government to take over, but talks at the 
presidential palace over the composition of the new administration swiftly 
collapsed.

8. Berlusconi to resign after austerity budget passed 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2011/nov/08/berlusconi-debt-greece>
 Top 10 business - 8 
No more "bunga bunga" for Berlusconi as the Italian prime minister agreed to 
resign once the country's parliament approved an austerity budget for 2012.

The move came after Berlusconi lost his parliamentary majority with just 308 
MPs supporting him in a vote on last year's public finances - eight shy of an 
absolute majority. Italian borrowing costs hit new highs.

Ever the showman, Berlusconi swiftly updated his Facebook page with a TV clip 
of his resignation plans.

Back in Blighty, chancellor George Osborne urged Europe to resist a Robin Hood 
tax, telling MPs it would be bad for pensioners - a claim rebuffed by 
campaigners.

9. Greek referendum throws markets into turmoil 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2011/nov/01/european-debt-crisis-greece-referendum>
 Top 10 business - 9 
A day of high drama as Greek PM Papandreou clung to power amid growing outrage 
in the eurozone over his extraordinary plan to hold a public vote on the debt 
deal.

Several Greek military officials were given their marching orders, which 
served to heighten the feeling that the country was on the brink of disaster.

Evangelos Venizelos - then Papandreou's deputy as well as finance minister - 
checked into a clinic with (some said very well-timed) stomach pains.

10. Berlusconi denies resignation plans as Greek talks continue 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2011/nov/07/greece-coalition-government-george-papandreou-crisis>
 Business top 10 - 10 
Berlusconi lived to fight another day as the nation's borrowing costs 
continued their relentless climb towards the 7% disaster zone.

In Greece, talks continued over the formation of a "unity" government and 
European finance ministers gathered to discuss the crisis.

In what was not seen as a particularly helpful comment, Cameron urged Europe 
to deliver on its promises. "Sort yourself out and then we will help."

George Soros, meanwhile, warned that Europe faces a lost decade.

Just for a change of pace, as the entire top 10 stories are on the debt 
crisis, there's a special mention for last year's 11th most-read article …

11. Burger King boss Bernardo Hees insults British women and food 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/mar/13/burger-king-boss-insults-britain>
 Business top 10 - 11 
The global boss of the fast food empire Burger King was forced to apologise 
after he told a group of American students that British women were unattractive 
and that English food was "terrible".

Speaking to an audience in Chicago, chief executive Bernardo Hees recalled his 
days studying for an MBA at the University of Warwick, recalling that there 
were few distractions to put him off his studies.

"The food is terrible and the women are not very attractive," said Hees, who 
quickly switched to flattery to charm his audience in Chicago. "Here in 
Chicago, the food is good and you are known for your good-looking women."
