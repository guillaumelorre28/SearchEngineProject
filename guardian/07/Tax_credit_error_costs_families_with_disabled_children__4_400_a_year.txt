Thousands of families with disabled children have lost out on up to £4,400 a 
year in tax credits after an administrative blunder by the authorities.

The error in processing their claims meant an estimated 28,000 families whose 
children qualified for disability living allowance (DLA) during 2011-14 missed 
out on an additional tax credit premium of between £60 and £84 a week.

The government revealed in the autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/23/how-will-autumn-statement-affect-you>
 this week that it had set aside £360m over six years to ensure these families 
receive child disability tax credits in future. However, the payments will be 
backdated only to April, meaning individual families may have lost out on 
entitlements totalling up to £20,000 over the past five years.

The non-payment of the tax credit premiums appears to have been a result of 
the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) failing to inform HMRC about 
families’ eligibility for the award over a three-year period.

The charity Contact a Family <http://www.cafamily.org.uk/> called for a 
compensation fund to be set up to help the families, saying it was not their 
fault that they lost out on what collectively amounted to tens of millions of 
pounds in entitlements.

“One thing is certain: this isn’t the fault of families. When you tick a box 
on a government form indicating you are in receipt of tax credits you 
reasonably expect it’s there for a reason – and there’s a process in place that 
allows government departments to share this information,” said the charity’s 
head of policy and public affairs, Una Summerson.


Families who are responsible for a disabled child or young person are eligible 
for a higher rate of child tax credit if the child is in receipt of a 
disability benefit such as disability living allowance (DLA) or personal 
independence payment (Pip).


Although it is technically the responsibility of the claimant to inform HMRC 
directly that they receive DLA or Pip for their child, in practice the tax 
authorities have endeavoured to update the claim automatically using 
information supplied by the DWP.

When a family applies to the DWP for a disability benefit on behalf of their 
child, the form asks whether they are in receipt of tax credits. If they state 
that they are, and the application is approved, the DWP would normally pass the 
information directly to HMRC.

HMRC regards the data-share as an “extra safeguard” to ensure that the extra 
child disability amounts are paid even when claimants have not directly 
notified them they were in receipt of the benefit.

However, between 2011-2014 a processing error described officially as “a gap 
in the data feed between DWP and HMRC” meant awards were not automatically 
updated.

Despite the large sums of money involved, the tax credits correction was 
referred to without explanation in the main Treasuryautumn statement report 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-statement-2016-documents>, 
with only sketchy details of the error buried in asupporting document  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/571402/Policy_Costings_AS_2016_web_final.pdf.>
on policy costings.

Robin Williamson, technical director of the pressure group Low Incomes Tax 
Reform Group <http://www.litrg.org.uk/>, said: “The amounts payable for 
disabled and severely disabled children within child tax credit are significant 
and it is concerning that such a large number of people have missed out on 
claiming these payments potentially for a number of years.


“It is important that HMRC work closely with DWP to ensure that the data feed 
works in future so this situation does not happen again.

“Although the claimant has a legal obligation to report changes to their 
circumstances, we often encounter claimants who quite reasonably assume that 
this kind of information is shared within and between government departments. 
This is certainly happening more frequently and means there is a confusing 
landscape for claimants and a mismatch between the legal framework and the 
operational practice,” he said.

Summerson said: “We are pleased with the announcement that, for these 
families, their awards will be amended and the extra amount paid from April 
2016. This is something we’ve been campaigning on.”

The error occurred during a period of intense upheaval at the DWP when the 
then work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, was pushing through over 
30 separate reforms including universal credit while at the same time cutting 
the department’s administrative budget by 18% and reducing staffing by nearly a 
quarter.

A National Audit Office report, published in 2015, was critical of some 
aspects of the DWP’s handling of what the department described as the “most 
fundamental change to the social security system in 60 years”. The report noted 
that: “Recent reforms have stretched the department’s ability to manage 
programmes”.
