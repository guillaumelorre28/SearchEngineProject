Australia will have the first Indigenous woman elected to the lower house of 
the federal parliament, with Linda Burney claiming victory in the marginal seat 
ofBarton <http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/barton.htm>.

Burney, the former deputy leader of the New South Wales Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>, called her election 
in the southern Sydney seat on Saturday night.

The Wiradjuri woman resigned from the NSW parliament in March and announced 
she was running for the federal seat of Barton. The seat was a marginal Liberal 
one but after redistribution became a notionally marginal Labor seat.

Burney claimed victory after 7pm on Saturday.

“Wonderful, wonderful,” Burney told Sky News.

“Barton has created history tonight in Australia by electing the first 
indigenous woman to the House of Representatives.”

She thanked her supporters and said the support in the community had been 
“astounding”.

“There was some ugliness earlier in the day at the booths and [everything and] 
the kitchen sink has been thrown in the last couple of days,” she said.

A record number of Indigenous candidates stood in this year’s federal election 
for various parties with eight women and five men running for parliament.

Burney used her last speech in the NSW parliament to criticise the 
“paternalistic” approach to Aboriginal affairs

Burney ran against Liberal MP Nickolas Varvaris.
