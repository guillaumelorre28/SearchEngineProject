There are 423 days until the 2012 London Olympics, but the games are set to 
give a much-needed boost to Britain's flagging economy in the current quarter, 
according to ING's James Knightley.

Applications for the 6.6m tickets available closed last month and the money is 
now leaving the accounts of successful applicants, although they still don't 
know who they are.

This will amount to Â£400m of sales which, like advance concert tickets, will 
be treated as consumption in the current quarter, rather than in the period the 
Olympics actually takes place. Add in overseas sales and we could see an 
Olympic bounce in UK 2Q11 GDP of around 0.2% of GDP, Knightley reckons.

The sales won't be included in the retail sales report - if they were, they 
might have boosted the May figure to something around +2% month-on-month.

There's a sting, of course. The third quarter is likely to suffer as the 
successful applicants grapple with their credit card bills, which will leave 
less money to spend on other goods and services.
