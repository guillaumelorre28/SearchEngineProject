1 Das Rheingold 

Mark Elder and the Hallé are certainly taking their time over their Ring 
cycle. After Götterdämmerung in 2009 and Die Walküre two years later, they now 
go back to the beginning with Rheingold. Iain Paterson is Wotan this time, with 
Samuel Youn as Alberich.

2 Richard Rodney Bennett

The latest of the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s Total Immersion days focuses on the 
music of the wonderfully versatile composer and pianist. There are programmes 
of chamber music and lighter works, before Rumon Gamba conducts the BBCSO in a 
suite from Bennett’s score for the movie Lady Caroline Lamb, as well as the 
Third Symphony and Spells, his settings of Kathleen Raine poems.

3 Andersen-Liederkreis

The final day of this year’s Huddersfield contemporary music festival brings 
yet more premieres. Particularly notable is the first British performance for 
Michael Finnissy’s reimagining of the song cycle using words by Hans Christian 
Andersen brought to life by Mark Knoop and Juliet Fraser. The texts are drawn 
from Andersen’s tales, poems and travel writings; they seem, the composer says, 
“disturbingly cruel and emotionally evasive”.

4 Alice’s Adventures Under Ground

Lewis Carroll promises to be the perfect match for Gerald Barry’s surreal 
imagination, and just six days after the world premiere in Los Angeles, Barry’s 
opera gets its first performance in Europe. Thomas Adès conducts the Britten 
Sinfonia for the concert performance, with the irrepressible Barbara Hannigan 
as Alice.
