Patrick Reed survived a couple of late bogeys to clinch a one-stroke victory 
at The Barclays on Sunday. He recorded a closing 70 to finish on nine-under 275 
at Bethpage Black in Farmingdale on New York’s Long Island.

His fellow American Sean O’Hair (66) and the Argentinian Emiliano Grillo (69) 
were joint second on eight under.

With his fifth victory on the PGA Tour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/pga-tour>, Reed secured a spot on the United 
States team for next month’s Ryder Cup. It was his first victory since the 
start of 2015 at Kapalua. He also vaulted to the top of the FedEx Cup points 
list after the first of the four play-off events.

Reed was delighted with his win but acknowledged his game needed work after he 
recorded bogeys at the 16th and 18th holes.

“I have worked pretty hard with my coach for the past couple of weeks,” the 
26-year-old said in a greenside interview. “The game shows I’m moving in the 
right direction but there are some things I need to work on. As the pressure 
started building I started going back to my old pattern, hit some shots left.”

However, it was a day to forget for Rickie Fowler, who had led going into the 
final round. He was still poised to earn one of the eight automatic spots on 
the Ryder Cup team until a meltdown over the last four holes. The final spot in 
the American team will now go to Zach Johnson.
