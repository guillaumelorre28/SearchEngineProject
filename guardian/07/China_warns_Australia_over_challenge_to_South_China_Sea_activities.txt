Bishop was due to raise the issue with the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, 
on Wednesday as part of annual talks between the two countries.


Telegraphing her approach during a visit to Tokyo before travelling to 
Beijing, Bishop said Australia accepted the Philippines’ right to pursue its 
claims in the permanent court of arbitration – a position hotly disputed byChina

“I note that President Xi [Jinping] said in Washington that China did not 
intend to militarise the islands and therefore I will be seeking further 
details from China as to what it proposes to do with the reclamation and 
construction work that it has undertaken,” she told the Japan National Press 
Club on Tuesday.

“China has said in the past that these would be ‘public goods’. Well, I wish 
to know how other countries can access these ‘public goods’.”

Bishop said Australia welcomed China’s economic rise but it “should act in a 
way that contributes to regional and global stability”.


The Philippines <https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines>, Taiwan, 
Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei have competing claims in the region. While not 
formally taking a position on the various claims, Bishop said Australia 
maintained an “unshakeable” commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight 
and believed the disputes should be resolved peacefully “without coercion or 
intimidation”.

China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said Australia “should not 
selectively evade” the facts, which included that the Philippines had launched 
its “unilateral” arbitration case contrary to international law and the 
previous consensus between the countries.

Hong said China’s island and reef construction activities were mainly to 
improve its maritime search and rescue capacities, but also included a military 
dimension.

“Deploying necessary national defence facilities on its own territory is 
China’s exercise of self-preservation and defence, a right granted by 
international law to sovereign states,” he said during hisregular press 
conference on Tuesday

.

“The Australian side should adopt an objective and unbiased attitude and 
refrain from doing anything that undermines regional peace and stability.”

The tensions came ahead of the annual foreign and strategic dialogue, 
co-chaired by the foreign ministers. While in China, Bishop was also due to 
meet Australian business figures and promote a student exchange program known 
as the New Colombo Plan.

Australia faces a delicate balancing act responding to the rise of China, 
which is its biggest trading partner, and continuing its long-standing alliance 
with the US.

Beijing rebuked the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/china-admonishes-malcolm-turnbull-on-south-china-sea-comments>
 after he said China was “pushing the envelope” in the South China Sea. Late 
last year, Turnbull said he and Barack Obama were “very much of the same mind” 
on regional issues.

Nonetheless, Australia signed a free trade agreement with China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/labor-and-coalition-reach-agreement-on-china-australia-free-trade-deal>
, which attracted some criticism from trade unions but came into force in 
December.
