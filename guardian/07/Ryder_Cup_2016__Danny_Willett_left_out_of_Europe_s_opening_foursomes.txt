furore overhis brother’s anti-American comments

 hit home.

The Masters champion had looked poised to partner Lee Westwood in the morning 
foursomes as the pair practised together on Thursday, with the European 
captain, Darren Clarke, sending his likely pairings out together.

However, after seeing Willett struggling with his game – including an errant 
shot on the 2nd which hit a spectator on the head – in a nine-hole match 
against Sergio García and Martin Kaymer, Clarke took the decision to pair the 
rookie Thomas Pieters with Westwood instead.

The Open champion, Henrik Stenson, and the Olympic gold medallist, Justin Rose,
who won all three matches together at Gleneagles in 2014

chosen to contest the opening match against Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed, who 
also went unbeaten in Scotland.
