You should be able to see all the full-time scores above. Millwall, Derby and 
Wolves have all ousted Premier League opposition, while Lincoln and Sutton 
continue to fly the non-league flag by taking league sides to replays. 
Elsewhere there has been a bit of a non-league cull, with Eastleigh, Barrow and 
Stourbridge all losing.
 The Lincoln players applaud their supporters after drawing at Portman Road.

You should be able to see all the full-time scores above. Millwall, Derby and
