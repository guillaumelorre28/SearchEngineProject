Russell Brand <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/russell-brand> has 
threatened to take legal action over the Sun’s front page splash alleging he 
was a “hypocrite” because of his housing arrangements.

The comedian pays rent for his London home to a firm registered in the British 
Virgin Islands, often referred to as a tax haven, according to Wednesday’s Sun.

Brand, who has previously called for a revolution and has appeared at 
anti-capitalist demonstrations, responded to allegations in a story on the 
front page of the paper by saying on Twitter that he intended to sue.

In a tweet directed at the accounts of the Sun and its owner Rupert Murdoch, 
he wrote:“Hey … I’m gonna sue you and give the money to NewEraEstate and JFT96.”

Earlier this week Brand joined hundreds of residents and supporters of the New 
Era estate in Hoxton

, east London, in a protest prompted by fears that its owner, the US investment 
firm Westbrook, is about to hike in rents.

JFT96 stands for Justice For The 96 in reference to the number of football 
supporters who died in the Hillsborough stadium disaster.

A spokesperson for the Sun said: “We are aware of Mr Brand’s comments, but we 
have not had any contact from him yet.”

Earlier this week, Brand lost his cool with a journalist in Downing Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/02/russell-brand-volatile-person-rent-journalist-snide>
 when he was asked how much he pays to rent his east London home.

The celebrity activist became agitated when the Channel 4 News reporter Paraic 
O’Brien challenged him

 during a protest over the cost of housing.

Brand pointed his finger in the journalist’s face and called him “a snide”.

O’Brien suggested that the housing problem was being exacerbated by the 
super-rich buying property in the capital.

 Russell Brand discusses his ‘snide’ comment in his Trews YouTube show 
Brand later discussed the interview on his YouTube news channel, likening it 
to a “quarrel at a jumble sale”. The comic and actor said: “I shouldn’t be 
allowed on television. I’m so easily wound up. What does it matter to me, what 
have I got to lose, just from this one bloke?

“But I’m a volatile person.

“When you talk to a journalist I sort of think it’s a combination of boring 
and really annoying, and my personality type is not well suited to that kind of 
environment.”

During the interview, Brand told the reporter: “I’m not interested in talking 
to you about my rent, mate. I’m here to support a very important campaign.”

When asked about the value of his home, he said: “It’s rented. We don’t know 
the value. You would have to talk to my landlord.

“Blessedly, I can afford my rent and I’m prepared to stand up for people that 
can’t.”

Cutting the interview short, he added: “Snides like you, mate, undermine [the 
campaign]. You’re a snide. All right, let’s do one.”

O’Brien wrote on Twitter: “Is it my job to test tension between private 
circumstances and publicly held views of celebrities? Yes.”
