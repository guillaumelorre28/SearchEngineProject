 once he has held talks with the club’s chairman, Steve Parish.

“Just here to complete talks and talk to Steve. If everything goes all right 
it should be OK,” he told Sky Sports News.

Asked whether he would be in charge in time for the match against Watford on 
Boxing Day, Allardyce said: “We’ll wait and see. It’s early days. Been a bit of 
a rush.”

Parish was at the club’s Beckenham training ground on Friday afternoon and the 
assistant manager Keith Millen hosted the media conference.

On its conclusion, the assembled media were immediately asked to vacate the 
room which included the branded signage in front of which any new manager would 
pose for club photographs.

“I’ve been told to prepare the team,” Millen said.

Millen is not aware of the progress of the appointment of Pardew’s successor, 
but believes Allardyce has pedigree. “I’ve not been party to that,” Millen 
said. “It’s obviously not confirmed, because I wouldn’t be here if it was. If 
it is Sam, we’re getting an experienced manager coming in.

“He did a great job at Sunderland keeping them up. He’d certainly be able to 
sort the players out.”
