Aftershock or new earthquake?

Today’s quake was an aftershock of the 2011 magnitude 9 earthquake, the Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> Meteorological Agency has said. But 
what is the difference?

Here’s a handy explainer from the Southern California Earthquake Center 
<https://www.reference.com/science/difference-between-earthquake-aftershock-4ed5d3f63204076d>
:

 Seismologists label an earthquake as an aftershock using two guidelines.

First, the earthquake must occur within an ‘aftershock zone’, which is usually 
defined as the region within one fault-rupture length of the mainshock rupture 
surface or the area defined by seismologists based on previous aftershock 
activity.

Second, it must happen within this zone before the seismicity rate in the area 
returns to its pre-mainshock level.

An earthquake that meets these two specific criteria is considered an 
aftershock.

Stock markets have rebounded after an early wobble, Agence France-Presse 
reports:

Asian markets rose Tuesday with energy stocks tracking a surge in oil prices, 
while Tokyo recovered an early sell-off caused by a huge earthquake off Japan’s 
northeast coast.

The yen strengthened against the dollar after the quake as investors sought 
out safe haven assets but gave up most of the gains as it emerged there was no 
major damage.


The dollar fell to as low as 110.27 yen before bouncing back to sit at 110.70 
yen, with expectations it will extend gains on bets for higher US interest 
rates under Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan’s Nikkei rebounded to end the morning slightly up and at its highest 
mark since January.

Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> has downgraded tsunami 
warnings issued after a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit off the country’s east 
coast, as the risk of major damage appeared to pass.

The quake, which struck east of Fukushima prefecture at about 6am on Tuesday, 
prompted urgent warnings for people to leave low-lying areas in Fukushima and 
Miyagi prefectures as a series of tsunami waves hit the shore.

The warnings allowed for the possibility of waves of up to 3m (10 feet) along 
the country’s north-east Pacific coast, but the highest recorded wave, of 1.4m 
(4.6 feet), was observed at Sendai port shortly after 8am.

The tsunami warnings in Fukushima and Miyagi were downgraded to the less 
severe status of advisories nearly four hours after the initial quake, although 
people were still urged to stay away from coastal areas. Similar tsunami 
advisories also remained in place in Iwate and Ibaraki prefectures.

There were no reports of severe injuries from the quake, which struck at a 
depth of 30km (18.6 miles), according to theJapan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> Meteorological Agency. The same 
region was hit by a series of weaker quakes in the following few hours.

While immediate fears around the quake and tsunami appear to have calmed, many 
people inJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> have been shocked by 
the morning’s events, Agence France-Presse reports:

Residents along the coast were badly shaken.

“It was huge and lasted so long,” Akemi Anzai, from the city of Minamisoma 
which lies north of the Fukushima plant, said of the quake.

“The tsunami siren warning can be heard from the coastline,” she told AFP. 
“The ground is still shaking. I’m so scared. But my concern is rather the 
situation at the nuclear plant.”

Some evacuees took to Twitter to express their fears.

“I’m at a cultural centre where I evacuated during the previous disaster [in 
2011],” one person tweeted in Japanese. “This reminds me of that.”

Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, has spoken about the earthquake from 
Buenos Aires, which he is visiting after attending the Apec summit in Peru:

A strong earthquake was observed off the coast of Fukushima a short while ago 
and the tsunami alerts were issued.

From my side, to the nation, we asked that proper and accurate information 
over the tsunami and the evacuation should be issued, and also to grasp and 
understand the condition of the damage as quickly as possible, and also to take 
proper emergency measures.

I called the chief cabinet secretary directly.

I would like to join hands closely with the local governments … and do our 
best to take appropriate emergency measures.

(Thanks to NHK for the translation.)

Paul Somerville, chief geoscientist with risk frontiers at Australia’s 
Macquarie University, says:

This earthquake was a normal faulting earthquake that occurred at a shallow 
depth within the plate that overlies the Tohoku subduction zone, which generated
the 2011 Mw 9.0 event 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-questions-answers>
.

It indicates east-west extension within the overriding plate, presumably due 
to the relaxation of horizontal stress that built up before the 2001 event. It 
occurred about 30km offshore of Fukushima.

It is very unlikely that this earthquake will have a large impact on Japan

Tsunami waves were filmed surging up the Sunaoshi river in Tagajo city after a 
quake of magnitude 7.4 shook Japan’s eastern coast, prompting evacuation 
warnings:
Japan earthquake: tsunami waves surge up river

Today’s quake was an aftershock of the 2011 magnitude 9 earthquake, the Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> Meteorological Agency has said. But 
what is the difference?

Here’s a handy explainer from the Southern California Earthquake Center 
<https://www.reference.com/science/difference-between-earthquake-aftershock-4ed5d3f63204076d>
:

 Seismologists label an earthquake as an aftershock using two guidelines.

First, the earthquake must occur within an ‘aftershock zone’, which is usually 
defined as the region within one fault-rupture length of the mainshock rupture 
surface or the area defined by seismologists based on previous aftershock 
activity.

Second, it must happen within this zone before the seismicity rate in the area 
returns to its pre-mainshock level.

An earthquake that meets these two specific criteria is considered an 
aftershock.
 
Pointing out that Tuesday’s quake was an aftershock of the 2011 earthquake, the
Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> Meteorological Agency also 
warned that another large quake could be expected within the next few days.

People in Japan have been warned to “remain cautious” for the next week.

The magnitude 7.4 quake was the largest earthquake in the region since the 
magnitude 9 quake in 2011 and some of its immediate aftershocks.
 
The Japan Meteorological Agency has said that Tuesday’s earthquake was an 
aftershock of the enormous,magnitude 9 quake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-questions-answers>
 in 2011, which killed more than 15,000 people and sent the Fukushima Daiichi 
nuclear power plant into meltdown.
 
New Zealand also experienced an earthquake on Tuesday, just over a week after 
a 7.8 magnitude quake rocked the South Island.

Tuesday’s was a magnitude 5.6 quake, which hit off the coast about 200km (120 
miles) northeast of Wellington, the capital, at around 1.20pm local time (00.20 
GMT).

There were no reports of injuries or serious damage, and no tsunami warning 
was issued.
 
There have been no reports of deaths or serious injuries caused by the 
earthquake, with Japanese media reporting around six people have suffered minor 
injuries.
 
All tsunami warnings have now been cancelled for Japan’s Pacific coast.

The Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> Meteorological Agency has 
confirmed:

Tsunami advisories have been lifted for the following coastal regions of 
Japan: Iwate prefecture, Miyagi prefecture, Fukushima prefecture, Ibaraki 
prefecture.

Slight sea-level changes may be observed in coastal regions, but no tsunami 
damage is expected.


Pay attention when fishing, swimming or engaging in other marine activities, 
as there may still be slight sea-level changes.
No major tsunami warnings, tsunami warnings or advisories are currently in 
effect.

Stock markets have rebounded after an early wobble, Agence France-Presse 
reports:

Asian markets rose Tuesday with energy stocks tracking a surge in oil prices, 
while Tokyo recovered an early sell-off caused by a huge earthquake off Japan’s 
northeast coast.

The yen strengthened against the dollar after the quake as investors sought 
out safe haven assets but gave up most of the gains as it emerged there was no 
major damage.


The dollar fell to as low as 110.27 yen before bouncing back to sit at 110.70 
yen, with expectations it will extend gains on bets for higher US interest 
rates under Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan’s Nikkei rebounded to end the morning slightly up and at its highest 
mark since January.

Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> has downgraded tsunami 
warnings issued after a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit off the country’s east 
coast, as the risk of major damage appeared to pass.

The quake, which struck east of Fukushima prefecture at about 6am on Tuesday, 
prompted urgent warnings for people to leave low-lying areas in Fukushima and 
Miyagi prefectures as a series of tsunami waves hit the shore.

The warnings allowed for the possibility of waves of up to 3m (10 feet) along 
the country’s north-east Pacific coast, but the highest recorded wave, of 1.4m 
(4.6 feet), was observed at Sendai port shortly after 8am.

The tsunami warnings in Fukushima and Miyagi were downgraded to the less 
severe status of advisories nearly four hours after the initial quake, although 
people were still urged to stay away from coastal areas. Similar tsunami 
advisories also remained in place in Iwate and Ibaraki prefectures.

There were no reports of severe injuries from the quake, which struck at a 
depth of 30km (18.6 miles), according to theJapan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> Meteorological Agency. The same 
region was hit by a series of weaker quakes in the following few hours.

While immediate fears around the quake and tsunami appear to have calmed, many 
people inJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> have been shocked by 
the morning’s events, Agence France-Presse reports:

Residents along the coast were badly shaken.

“It was huge and lasted so long,” Akemi Anzai, from the city of Minamisoma 
which lies north of the Fukushima plant, said of the quake.

“The tsunami siren warning can be heard from the coastline,” she told AFP. 
“The ground is still shaking. I’m so scared. But my concern is rather the 
situation at the nuclear plant.”

Some evacuees took to Twitter to express their fears.

“I’m at a cultural centre where I evacuated during the previous disaster [in 
2011],” one person tweeted in Japanese. “This reminds me of that.”
 
Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, has spoken about the earthquake from 
Buenos Aires, which he is visiting after attending the Apec summit in Peru:

A strong earthquake was observed off the coast of Fukushima a short while ago 
and the tsunami alerts were issued.

From my side, to the nation, we asked that proper and accurate information 
over the tsunami and the evacuation should be issued, and also to grasp and 
understand the condition of the damage as quickly as possible, and also to take 
proper emergency measures.

I called the chief cabinet secretary directly.

I would like to join hands closely with the local governments … and do our 
best to take appropriate emergency measures.

Paul Somerville, chief geoscientist with risk frontiers at Australia’s 
Macquarie University, says:

This earthquake was a normal faulting earthquake that occurred at a shallow 
depth within the plate that overlies the Tohoku subduction zone, which generated
the 2011 Mw 9.0 event 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-questions-answers>
.

It indicates east-west extension within the overriding plate, presumably due 
to the relaxation of horizontal stress that built up before the 2001 event. It 
occurred about 30km offshore of Fukushima.

It is very unlikely that this earthquake will have a large impact on Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan>.
 
Transport has been affected by the quake and subsequent alerts.


Sendai port and Suma port have been affected by tsunami waves, although the 
warning has now been downgraded to an advisory.

Flights to and from Sendai airport have been delayed or cancelled.
