Bye!

Now, I’m sorry to love and leave you but my services are required elsewhere, 
off campus, at an event about political reform.

So let’s sum up Tuesday.

So much chunky Magic Mike goodness I’ve not had time to share today. Shocker.

Must do better tomorrow.

Now, today:

 * The prime minister faced two censure motions after he was accused of 
misleading the House yesterday in an answer about the government’s intentions 
on capital gains tax. Not all that pleasant.

 * The government has launched something like a review into a safe schools 
program that aims to keep LGBTI kids safe in the playground by educating fellow 
students about diversity. This is happening because conservatives, led by South 
AustralianCory Bernardi, think this program is about the rainbow agenda. I’m 
not sure what that is, but it sounds, on the face of it, harmless.

 * Crossbenchers remain angsty about the government’s plans to overhaul Senate 
voting procedures, and Labor has resolved to vote against them on the basis the 
change will lead to a “purge” of the micro-parties. 
There was more, but that’s your main course.

See you in the morning.

When Scott met Ben and things got testy

While I’ve been trying to think the treasurer Scott Morrison has been booted 
around the 2GB yard by broadcasterBen Fordham. Most of the discussion was about 
foreign investment, and it was reasonably willing, but Fordham could not resist 
a bit of needling at the end. Fordham wondered whether or not Morrison had been 
hiding from his stablemate,Ray Hadley.

Scott Morrison, on that proposition.

That’s crap, Ben, and I think it’s a bit cheap.

Morrison said no reasonable reading of his distinguished record of making 
himself available to Ray would bear out an analysis that he washiding, under 
his desk, or anywhere else.

Fordham urged the treasurer not to get sensitive. He was just a jobbing 
journo, asking the questions.

Morrison:

You are insinuating and I don’t appreciate it.

Fordham persisted in the needle. The treasurer, he noted, was a little glass 
jawed about my very mild criticism.

No mate, Morrison said, in the way where you say mate but you mean something 
other than mate.

(If you are wondering what this is about, Morrison skipped his regular 
appearance on Hadley yesterday morning. Ray was unhappy.)

Not drowning ..

Canberra this afternoon, Tuesday 23rd February 2016. Photograph: Mike Bowers 
for the Guardian 
Let’s take this quickie analysis step by step.

The first thing that needs to be said is the tempo of the parliament and 
political discourse has accelerated notably this week. The major parties have 
locked into election formation, which means we’ve moved beyond sparring, beyond 
practice punching, we are now firmly in go for the knock out territory. Why? 
Because both sides know we could be in a campaign the day after the budget 
lands. AsBill Shorten told caucus colleagues earlier today, we all have to dig 
a little deeper.

Presumably that’s why the prime minister has diverted from his ‘smile and take 
it gently’ approach that characterised the opening phase of his political 
leadership. He’s moved into lobbing tabloid soundbites. Scary Labor will drive 
down the value of the family home, because you know scary Labor. Shorten too is 
sharpening (by his still periodically woolly standards) his characterisations 
of Turnbull – arrogant, the agent of the investor class, sell-out,Tony Abbott 
in disguise. What you are watching right now is like the process of sending a 
file to someone online: it needs to be compressed before it can be dispatched 
successfully to the recipient.

Labor’s policies on negative gearing and capital gains tax are politically 
risky. The practical consequences of restricting a concession to one segment of 
the housing market are not currently known. If Labor has commissioned modelling 
attempting to scope out the consequences, this material is not currently in the 
public domain. There is also a risk associated with telegraphing your 
intentions before implementing them: that you create a bubble of speculative 
activity. So the bottom line here? I think there are legitimate questions to 
ask about the practical implications of the policy. Perhaps there are better 
ways to wind back concessions that many experts believe distort Australia’s 
housing market. Bring that conversation on. We’d all benefit from it.

But Turnbull has pedalled past obvious lines of calm and sensible 
interrogation to alleged full scale house snatching by the alternative party of 
government. Some of the overstatements hurled in question time today were, 
truly extraordinary. Take this one: “Every single home owner in every single 
electorate represented in this House will be poorer if the Labor Party is 
elected to government.” Really? Like,really, prime minister?

We expect the Liberal and National parties to stand up for the aspirational 
investor class in Australia – this posture isn’t a shock – but the vehemence of 
the beat down, and the hyperbole associated with it works against one ofMalcolm 
Turnbull’s core principles when he took the Liberal leadership: to respect the 
intelligence of voters, to cease and desist from cheap political slogans, not 
rush pre-emptively in half panic to rule policy things out that, by rights, 
should be considered.

He’s (in part at least) pitching to the conservatives in his own ranks in an 
effort to keep the government stable, but what Turnbull actually needs to do – 
whatTony Abbott couldn’t do – is pitch to the sensible centre in Australian 
politics <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics>. And 
the fact of the matter is Turnbull has both the credibility with the public and 
the political capital to win the next election by being a grown up, by 
expanding the discourse, not by contracting the discussion into the same mind 
numbing nonsense Australians have already seen and don’t much care for.

Fact is, right now at least – all things in this joint liable to change 
without notice – the party offering the politically risky policy has the prime 
minister exactly where it wants him: running against type, mouthing a half 
baked script, jumping at shadows, over-egging, and tripping up on the great 
rush through.

Labor’s Tony Burke, seconding the motion.

I thought they had changed prime ministers! I thought we were told that there 
was going to be a new respect for the intelligence of theAustralian people!

I thought people had a sense that the new prime minister would change the 
culture of the Liberal party, we were told that he would change the Liberal 
party but, no, the Liberal party has changed him, from the moment he got that 
job.

A brief diversion into live cattle before back to Labor’s secret plan to drive 
down the price of your home. Labor’s negative gearing policywill cut the value 
of your home.

Malcolm Turnbull:

It will mean you can’t afford to borrow money from your home to give money to 
your kids so they can buy a place. It mean you can’t afford to go on a holiday 
when you want to start a business, and you go to the bank and you want to 
borrow some money to start a business, the bank will say: “Well, you better get 
a valuation.” And you will discover that your home has been reduced in value 
and it will be entirely the consequence of a deliberate, calculated act by a 
Labor government.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Mr Speaker, all of – every single one of those Australians after 1st July 
2017, if the honourable member becomes prime minister, will not be able to 
claim a net interest loss on investment made in existing property.

Now, their cunning plan, Mr Speaker, their cunning plan is to say that they 
can only invest in new property.

Now, we all know that the reason that housing is less affordable than it ought 
to be, particularly again, I have say, in my own area of Sydney, is because of 
lack of supply.

They are going to cut the value of your home.

Mr Speaker, that is Labor’s policy. They want to make housing more affordable 
by making your house worth less.

The prime minister is defending himself in this censure debate. Turnbull says 
negative gearing is an activity undertaken by nurses and teachers – not 
surgeons and finance managers. He’s face first in the stats right now.

Mere mortals don't understand the extent of the Wentworth genius ..

Shorten, continuing.

Now, I feel a little bit of a pang for poor old Member for Warringah (Tony 
Abbott). He got undermined byMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> for making 
captain’s calls, but as soon as Mr Turnbull is up there, the captain’s call!

We know what this leader of the government said. He said there would be no 
changes to capital gains tax whatsoever. So today we ask him to back in his 
words and there are really three options the PM could have picked: tell the 
truth or indeed tell us what was happening with capital gains tax or he could 
have just said: “Everyone else is wrong.”

We are lucky enough to have an infallible prime minister in this country, we 
are very lucky to know that we are led by the smartest man in Australia, 
self-declared – that even when he gets it wrong, he is still right, us mere 
mortals just don’t understand the extent of Wentworth genius.

This is the second censure order of the day against the prime minister for 
misleading the House.

Bill Shorten:

Either this prime minister is dishonest or he is incompetent, he cannot be 
both. The prime minister needs to rule out increasing capital gains tax on the 
superannuation accounts of millions of people.

What is it about this prime minister that makes him so out of touch that he 
will defend to the last drop of Liberal blood, reducing the 50% capital gains 
discount to 25%, when it comes to defending the capital gains tax discount of 
millions of Australians and their superannuation - well, he is out of town for 
that.

The prime minister is so arrogant that he thinks he can say unsay words and 
make them miraculously disappear, but the problem for him is this: every 
journalist in the press gallery heard exactly what he said, every newspaper in 
Australia showed that he was ruling out tackling capital gains tax, and what 
does he do?

Now, I’m sorry to love and leave you but my services are required elsewhere, 
off campus, at an event about political reform.

So let’s sum up Tuesday.

Must do better tomorrow.

Now, today:

 * The prime minister faced two censure motions after he was accused of 
misleading the House yesterday in an answer about the government’s intentions 
on capital gains tax. Not all that pleasant.

 * The government has launched something like a review into a safe schools 
program that aims to keep LGBTI kids safe in the playground by educating fellow 
students about diversity. This is happening because conservatives, led by South 
AustralianCory Bernardi, think this program is about the rainbow agenda. I’m 
not sure what that is, but it sounds, on the face of it, harmless.

 * Crossbenchers remain angsty about the government’s plans to overhaul Senate 
voting procedures, and Labor has resolved to vote against them on the basis the 
change will lead to a “purge” of the micro-parties. 
There was more, but that’s your main course.

See you in the morning.
 
While I’ve been trying to think the treasurer Scott Morrison has been booted 
around the 2GB yard by broadcasterBen Fordham. Most of the discussion was about 
foreign investment, and it was reasonably willing, but Fordham could not resist 
a bit of needling at the end. Fordham wondered whether or not Morrison had been 
hiding from his stablemate,Ray Hadley.

Scott Morrison, on that proposition.

That’s crap, Ben, and I think it’s a bit cheap.

Morrison said no reasonable reading of his distinguished record of making 
himself available to Ray would bear out an analysis that he washiding, under 
his desk, or anywhere else.

Fordham urged the treasurer not to get sensitive. He was just a jobbing 
journo, asking the questions.

Morrison:

You are insinuating and I don’t appreciate it.

Fordham persisted in the needle. The treasurer, he noted, was a little glass 
jawed about my very mild criticism.

No mate, Morrison said, in the way where you say mate but you mean something 
other than mate.

(If you are wondering what this is about, Morrison skipped his regular 
appearance on Hadley yesterday morning. Ray was unhappy.)

Let’s take this quickie analysis step by step.

The first thing that needs to be said is the tempo of the parliament and 
political discourse has accelerated notably this week. The major parties have 
locked into election formation, which means we’ve moved beyond sparring, beyond 
practice punching, we are now firmly in go for the knock out territory. Why? 
Because both sides know we could be in a campaign the day after the budget 
lands. AsBill Shorten told caucus colleagues earlier today, we all have to dig 
a little deeper.

Presumably that’s why the prime minister has diverted from his ‘smile and take 
it gently’ approach that characterised the opening phase of his political 
leadership. He’s moved into lobbing tabloid soundbites. Scary Labor will drive 
down the value of the family home, because you know scary Labor. Shorten too is 
sharpening (by his still periodically woolly standards) his characterisations 
of Turnbull – arrogant, the agent of the investor class, sell-out,Tony Abbott 
in disguise. What you are watching right now is like the process of sending a 
file to someone online: it needs to be compressed before it can be dispatched 
successfully to the recipient.

Labor’s policies on negative gearing and capital gains tax are politically 
risky. The practical consequences of restricting a concession to one segment of 
the housing market are not currently known. If Labor has commissioned modelling 
attempting to scope out the consequences, this material is not currently in the 
public domain. There is also a risk associated with telegraphing your 
intentions before implementing them: that you create a bubble of speculative 
activity. So the bottom line here? I think there are legitimate questions to 
ask about the practical implications of the policy. Perhaps there are better 
ways to wind back concessions that many experts believe distort Australia’s 
housing market. Bring that conversation on. We’d all benefit from it.

But Turnbull has pedalled past obvious lines of calm and sensible 
interrogation to alleged full scale house snatching by the alternative party of 
government. Some of the overstatements hurled in question time today were, 
truly extraordinary. Take this one: “Every single home owner in every single 
electorate represented in this House will be poorer if the Labor Party is 
elected to government.” Really? Like,really, prime minister?

We expect the Liberal and National parties to stand up for the aspirational 
investor class in Australia – this posture isn’t a shock – but the vehemence of 
the beat down, and the hyperbole associated with it works against one ofMalcolm 
Turnbull’s core principles when he took the Liberal leadership: to respect the 
intelligence of voters, to cease and desist from cheap political slogans, not 
rush pre-emptively in half panic to rule policy things out that, by rights, 
should be considered.

He’s (in part at least) pitching to the conservatives in his own ranks in an 
effort to keep the government stable, but what Turnbull actually needs to do – 
whatTony Abbott couldn’t do – is pitch to the sensible centre in Australian 
politics <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics>. And 
the fact of the matter is Turnbull has both the credibility with the public and 
the political capital to win the next election by being a grown up, by 
expanding the discourse, not by contracting the discussion into the same mind 
numbing nonsense Australians have already seen and don’t much care for.

Fact is, right now at least – all things in this joint liable to change 
without notice – the party offering the politically risky policy has the prime 
minister exactly where it wants him: running against type, mouthing a half 
baked script, jumping at shadows, over-egging, and tripping up on the great 
rush through.

 
Further questions have been placed on the notice paper. I’ll be back with some 
thoughts on that session shortly.

Labor’s Tony Burke, seconding the motion.

I thought they had changed prime ministers! I thought we were told that there 
was going to be a new respect for the intelligence of theAustralian people!

I thought people had a sense that the new prime minister would change the 
culture of the Liberal party, we were told that he would change the Liberal 
party but, no, the Liberal party has changed him, from the moment he got that 
job.
 
A brief diversion into live cattle before back to Labor’s secret plan to drive 
down the price of your home. Labor’s negative gearing policywill cut the value 
of your home.

Malcolm Turnbull:

It will mean you can’t afford to borrow money from your home to give money to 
your kids so they can buy a place. It mean you can’t afford to go on a holiday 
when you want to start a business, and you go to the bank and you want to 
borrow some money to start a business, the bank will say: “Well, you better get 
a valuation.” And you will discover that your home has been reduced in value 
and it will be entirely the consequence of a deliberate, calculated act by a 
Labor government.
 
Malcolm Turnbull:

Mr Speaker, all of – every single one of those Australians after 1st July 
2017, if the honourable member becomes prime minister, will not be able to 
claim a net interest loss on investment made in existing property.

Now, their cunning plan, Mr Speaker, their cunning plan is to say that they 
can only invest in new property.

Now, we all know that the reason that housing is less affordable than it ought 
to be, particularly again, I have say, in my own area of Sydney, is because of 
lack of supply.

They are going to cut the value of your home.

Mr Speaker, that is Labor’s policy. They want to make housing more affordable 
by making your house worth less.
 
The prime minister is defending himself in this censure debate. Turnbull says 
negative gearing is an activity undertaken by nurses and teachers – not 
surgeons and finance managers. He’s face first in the stats right now.
 
Shorten:

This fellow here ... he thinks the Australian dream is the ability to 
negatively gear your seventh house.
 
Shorten, continuing.

Now, I feel a little bit of a pang for poor old Member for Warringah (Tony 
Abbott). He got undermined byMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> for making 
captain’s calls, but as soon as Mr Turnbull is up there, the captain’s call!

We know what this leader of the government said. He said there would be no 
changes to capital gains tax whatsoever. So today we ask him to back in his 
words and there are really three options the PM could have picked: tell the 
truth or indeed tell us what was happening with capital gains tax or he could 
have just said: “Everyone else is wrong.”

We are lucky enough to have an infallible prime minister in this country, we 
are very lucky to know that we are led by the smartest man in Australia, 
self-declared – that even when he gets it wrong, he is still right, us mere 
mortals just don’t understand the extent of Wentworth genius.
 
This is the second censure order of the day against the prime minister for 
misleading the House.

Bill Shorten:

Either this prime minister is dishonest or he is incompetent, he cannot be 
both. The prime minister needs to rule out increasing capital gains tax on the 
superannuation accounts of millions of people.

What is it about this prime minister that makes him so out of touch that he 
will defend to the last drop of Liberal blood, reducing the 50% capital gains 
discount to 25%, when it comes to defending the capital gains tax discount of 
millions of Australians and their superannuation - well, he is out of town for 
that.

The prime minister is so arrogant that he thinks he can say unsay words and 
make them miraculously disappear, but the problem for him is this: every 
journalist in the press gallery heard exactly what he said, every newspaper in 
Australia showed that he was ruling out tackling capital gains tax, and what 
does he do?

No, they are all wrong.
 
Rightio, here comes the suspension of the standing orders.
 
Turnbull is persisting with his argument that he was taken out of context 
yesterday on CGT.

It is perfectly obvious that - perfectly clear that I was talking about 
Labor’s proposal to increase capital gains tax on individuals, and it was 
perfectly obvious that that’s what the Member for McMahon (Chris Bowen) was 
talking about.
