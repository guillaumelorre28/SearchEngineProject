Wearing a colour-blocked Amanda Wakeley jacket as you deliver your first 
speech as prime minister is not a style statement. Style statements are for 
those who think a printed silk scarf is, you know, a bit “jazzy”. In context, 
last Wednesday’s airing of neon yellow and black tailoring was the action of a 
leader who unashamedly enjoys fashion.Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has a subscription to Vogue 
and the keys to number 10 Downing Street and, unlike any of the post’s previous 
incumbents, she does not see a conflict in that fact.

This is the woman who famously told Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs 
<http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/11/24/theresa-may-vogue-desert-island-discs-subscription>
 that a lifetime subscription to the glossy fashion magazine would be her one 
luxury item if she were a castaway. Whether you care about clothes or not, you 
know that May does, and her interest in fashion has not gone unnoticed. Almost 
as many column inches have been spent discussing thenavy Roland Mouret Bitzer 
dress

 she wore to the Conservative conference last October as they have to last 
week’s analysis of the speech she made at that event. Social media has been 
jumping with chat about what exactly it is we admire about May’s wardrobe (Is 
it her neckline? Her fearlessness? Wait, is liking a Tory wardrobe even 
allowed?).

Reliably, the tabloids have taken this to the extreme. The Sun’s front page 
splashed a picture of May’s signature leopard-print shoes standing on the heads 
of various male Tory politicians with the headline: “Heel, Boys. 
<https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/752616479032545281/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
” Itwould be shoes, wouldn’t it? And May’s kitten heels are now forever 
cemented in Westminster folklore as the natural descendants ofMargaret 
Thatcher’s pussy-bow blouses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/03/no-style-icon-but-an-image-maker-why-margaret-thatcher-was-the-wrong-fit-for-the-va>
. International newspapers were unable to resist, either, with the Russian 
government’s paper falling into the sexist preoccupation of ranking female 
leaders’ wardrobes against each other. May’s look is apparently “more 
attractive than the featureless jackets of Angela Merkel”.

However, to rate Theresa May’s style isn’t just patronising and sexist, but it 
entirely misses the point.As she told the Women in the World summit 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11921823/Theresa-May-Women-in-the-World-Women-can-be-clever-and-like-clothes.html>
 in October last year: “One of the challenges for women in the workplace is to 
be ourselves, and I say you can be clever and like clothes. You can have a 
career and like clothes.” (She didn’t add that you can be clever and like 
football. Unsurprisingly, male leaders have never felt the need to spell that 
out.)

Arguably, May is a political leader who actively likes fashion, as opposed to 
reluctantly trying to manage the semantics of it. Other female leaders have a 
pragmatic and often difficult relationship with fashion.Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> ricochets between 
diffusing fashion critique by wearing a uniform of what Tina Brown nonetheless 
derided as “Sgt Pepper trousers suits 
<https://www.the-newshub.com/us-politics/can-you-believe-tina-brown-said-hillarys-wardrobe-puts-off-voters>
”, to embracing thousand-dollar Armani pieces. Meanwhile,Angela Merkel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel> has hammered the Pantone 
jacket approach into not-worth-commenting-upon irrelevance. May, by all 
evidence, uses fashion to please herself, and her love of clothes allows her to 
dress boldly. Wearingover-the-knee patent boots 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11447119/Theresa-May-wears-thigh-high-boots-to-greet-Queen-and-Mexican-President.html>
 to meet Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto, as she did last year, is not the 
action of a woman who subscribes to the “dress to negate analysis” chatter.

What is telling about May’s penchant for fashion is why we care so much – and 
more so why we criticise it so readily. Would we condemn a similarly frivolous 
preoccupation in a male leader? It will be interesting to see whether May is 
allowed to continue to freely enjoy clothes or whether her advisors will judge 
her fashion to be too loud – was it an advisor who thought May’s necklace was 
too showy and suggested she remove it on the day she announced her prime 
ministerial bid, or was it just annoying her? Let’s hope the latter. Because, 
for many of us, watching May enjoying her own clothes will be a precious form 
of light relief in the coming months.
