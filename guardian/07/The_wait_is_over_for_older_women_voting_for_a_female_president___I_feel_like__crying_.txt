The sun hadn’t yet risen over the Salomé Ureña de Henríquez school in Inwood, 
at the northernmost tip of Manhattan, when Carol Jenkins joined a line of about 
20 people waiting for the polls to open.

Jenkins, 72, a pioneering African American broadcast journalist in the 1970s 
and the founding president of the Women’s Media Center, said her morning had 
started off special. “I woke up this morning feeling my mother here, like, 
‘Let’s do this!’”

She was there, for the second time in her life, to cast a ballot for a 
presidential candidate she’d never expected to have the opportunity to vote 
for: first, it was for an African American in 2008; now it wasfor a woman

Glass ceiling watch: will America elect its first woman president?

“It is the same sense of a wild revolution,” she said.

Jenkins was not alone in feeling these emotions – female voters, young and 
old, from all over the country spoke of how important it was to finally be able 
to vote for a woman in a presidential election.


For older voters in particular, there was a sense of the journey it had taken 
to get here.

“Voting is a privilege,” Esther Diamond said in her apartment in Queens, New 
York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york>, on Tuesday. “People have 
died for it. You can’t throw away an opportunity to be listened to.”

Diamond knows what that feels like. She was born in January 1920, months 
before the final state ratified the 19th amendment, granting women across the 
US the right to vote. Now, the 96-year-old, who immigrated to America from 
Russia as a child, has had the chance tovote for a woman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/path-election-day-hillary-clinton-video>
.

“I’ve hoped for a long time that this day would come.” 

Diamond is just one of many women born before the 19th amendment was ratified 
who have been profiled on the websiteiwaited96years.com 
<http://iwaited96years.com/>. In a lifetime they’ve gone from being 
disenfranchised because of their sex to casting a vote for, potentially, the 
first female president of the United States.

That momentous change was underscored by the hundreds of women who waited in 
line to affix their “I Voted” stickers to leading suffragist Susan B Anthony’s 
grave in Rochester, New York. It’s an election day tradition that has been 
given new meaning this year.

Anthony, who died 14 years before the ratification of the 19th amendment, was 
a prominent force in the women’s suffrage movement and was once arrested and 
fined for voting illegally.

Similar tributes formed for prominent suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 
Carrie Chapman Catt, Mary Garrett Hay and Alva Belmont, according to theNew 
York Times 
<http://similar%20tributes%20formed%20for%20prominent%20suffragists%20elizabeth%20cady%20stanton%2C%20carrie%20chapman%20catt%2C%20mary%20garrett%20hay%20and%20alva%20belmont./>
.

The second-floor gymnasium in which the polls were located at Salomé Ureña 
didn’t feel like the site of a revolution: it smelled like the gyms of American 
childhoods.


But it didn’t put a damper on Jenkins’ enthusiasm: “Just the fact of casting a 
vote for a woman president, whether she wins or not, is so extraordinary. You 
can tell I’m a little excited.”

After filling in her scanning ballot in a privacy booth, she raised both arms 
in the air as she walked out the door. “We did it! We did it! Part of history, 
here, now!”

Further south in Manhattan, congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, 70, pulled up to 
the drop-off zone at the 92nd Street Y in the midst of the daycare drop-off 
hour, and emerged from the car wearing a chic red pantsuit. “I never thought 
I’d have the opportunity to vote for a woman president,” she said, grinning. 
“It took a long time to get to this point.”

Maloney, who was first elected to the New York City council in 1982 (and was 
the first woman to give birth while in office) and then elected to her House 
seat in 1992, added: “When I went to Congress, there were very few women there, 
so I always felt like I had to represent all women as well as my constituents.”

She emerged from the polling place 20 minutes later, still smiling. “I got 
chills for the first time in my life,” she said. “For someone who spent her 
whole life hearing that she can’t so something because I’m a woman, it was 
really special.”

“It’s been a long struggle to get where we are,” she added. “I feel like 
crying, it’s so incredible.”

Another 20 blocks south, Trudy L Mason, the 74-year-old vice-chair of the New 
York state Democratic committee, was wearing her special-edition pantsuit-print
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> T-shirt 
and a variety of Clinton buttons. “I wore the T-shirt in case they make me take 
the buttons off. They can’t make me take my shirt off,” she said with a laugh, 
as she walked three blocks to her polling place of 30 years.

The line, when she arrived, was halfway down the block. “This looks like a 
Hillary crowd,” she crowed. “And I’m thrilled.”

Mason, a longtime Democratic activist and politician from the area, has known 
Clinton since they both worked on the Carter campaign in 1976; she and Maloney 
were both on Clinton’s 1995 trip to Beijing for the the United Nations Fourth 
World Conference on Women, during which the then first lady declared: “Women’s 
rights are human rights.”

 Trudy Mason: ‘Watching Hillary vote this morning I got tears in my eyes.’

“I am not an emotional person,” Mason said, unconvincingly, “but watching 
Hillary vote this morning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-record-early-voting-turnout>
 [on television] I got tears in my eyes.”

Those tears appeared, again, as she left the polling place having cast her own 
ballot for the first-ever female candidate for president. “How do I feel?” she 
asked. “This is a woman, she’s from New York, she was my senator and she’s my 
friend. Now she’s going to be president. Look at me, I’m tearing up.”

“I really didn’t realize how much this would affect me,” she added. 

Diamond thinks the final result will be close. But whether Clinton wins or 
not, “she’s opened the door for future women to think about running and that’s 
important. I’m sure there will be others, maybe not in my lifetime. You just 
need one person to try the water. Maybe my great granddaughter will be 
president.”
