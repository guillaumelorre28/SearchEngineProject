Close of play: Australia 288-3 (Smith 110, Handscomb 64)

A pretty good day’s cricket in Brisbane, I thought…

Despite an otherwise unremarkable scoreline, it was a momentous day for 
cricket in Australia. Day-night cricket reached the Sunshine State for the 
first time, and brought with it an unprecedented level of conjecture over what 
the traditionally-humid city would serve up.

People often speak lazily about what it means to produce a ‘good wicket’, or 
what it means to have ‘good conditions’. Too often in this country we equate a 
hard, white wicket with ‘a good one’. Equally opposite, we’re quick to bemoan 
green-seamers then render free scoring impossible. This is before we even 
consider the commercial implications of fast-finishing tests. The latter issue 
was surely the biggest, if not most private, concern ofCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Australia ahead of today. What 
transpired, however, was a wicket and set of conditions that could truly be 
considered good – because it offered something to everyone.

It was, in the end, an excellent day for Australia – underscored by an innings 
of maturity by young buck Matt Renshaw. The knock had all the hallmarks of a 
fairytale: a toothy grin, a home ground and friends present. His departure 
wasn’t in keeping with the assuredness of his innings, but he will be buoyed by 
the result anyway. Eyebrows remained raised over Peter Handscomb’s methods, but 
perhaps without the same vigour as in Adelaide. His undefeated 64 included 
impressive periods of both attack and defence – a sure sign of his ability to 
adapt to a game’s scenario.

The day, of course, belonged to Australia’s captain. He did fly under the 
radar for most of his innings though, as Australian viewers continued to 
contemplate the wares of its new batsmen. By the time he reached his hundred, 
early reflections revealed an innings of both patience and style. He had some 
luck too.

Pakistan on the other hand can count themselves pretty unluck. Both Yasir and 
Amir threatened all day, and Yasir’s bowling partnership with Wahab after 
dinner could easily have turned the game. Sadly, Amir’s injury put paid to 
their bowling plans, and it allowed Australia enough time to re-seize the 
initiative and move the game away their opponents.

As tomorrow looms, eyes will be on Handscomb as Australia looks to solidify 
its batting group. Nic Maddinson will get his chance, and provided both current 
batsmen don’t perform remarkably, Maddinson should be able to bat in daylight. 
It could get difficult for Pakistan, but then again this is Australia, who have 
shown a capability to be five out-all out.

Join us tomorrow as we follow the action.

90th over: Australia 288-3 (Smith 110, Handscomb 64)

Yasir concludes the day with a smile. It’s uneventful as Smith takes a single 
off the back foot and Handscomb finishes the job. A little wrap to follow..

Finally, I was desperate to give the final word to Tristan Brumby-Rendell, who 
finally found the picture of Miandad I was after. Alas, image rights preclude 
me from posting it (and possibly my luddite-ness here). Suffice to say, Javed 
Miandad hearts New York.

89th over: Australia 287-3 (Smith 109, Handscomb 64)

More runs down the ground for both batsmen as the earlier parked bus now 
offers a sharp counter attacking threat. This is Bayern Munich 2013-esque as 
Smith and Handscomb suddenly look at ease again.

Enthralling as it’s been, I’ve remained at least equally interested in the 
matter of Miandad and the ‘I heart NY’ cap. A few developments:

88th over: Australia 280-3 (Smith 106, Handscomb 60)

Of the array of strokes offered by both Smith and Handscomb this session, 
their driving down the ground has been particularly majestic. Here Handscomb 
collects three early in Rahat’s over, before a hard cut finds his top edge - 
sailing over first slip for four. Pakistan have really given everything to even 
the honours this session, and may be forgiven for feeling a little luckless. As 
the day winds down, the scoreboard will show a dominant Australian performance. 
It hasn’t always been so.

Smith reaches his ton!

87th over: Australia 274-3 (Smith 106, Handscomb 54)

The tension breaks as Smith drives Amir down the ground for four to bring up 
his hundred. It’s been an innings of all gears, probably most impressive for 
his evident maturity through the nineties. Given the rate of his scoring 
leading up to that point, he could have been forgiven for expecting to maintain 
that for the remainder of the day. But resolute defence and that catchcry of 
his - resilience - saw him to the milestone. Of course, Amir finally catches 
his edge, only for the ball to run for four through that perenially vacant 
fourth slip region.

86th over: Australia 266-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 54)

Australia has officially parked the bus here, as Handscomb’s back foot defence 
repels Rahat. He offers no stroke to a few tempters outside off-stump - a 
different policy to that of 30 minutes ago. Efforts to contrive singles also 
appear to be off the table, and it very much appears as though Australia’s aims 
are now two-fold: ensure the captain gets his ton, and that no wickets are 
lost. It will be Amir to Smith to start the next over.

84th over: Australia 266-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 54)

Handscomb certainly knows where his off-stump is, as another couple of 
scorching Amir deliveries sear past his pegs. It’s hard to know where he’ll 
score from at the moment. Whatever the case, this is an excellent spell of 
bowling from Amir, who elicits an edge off the second last ball of his over 
that falls short of third slip. It brings Smith on strike for the last ball of 
the over...there is no run.

Cameras pan to the Australian dressing room, where both Nic Maddinson and 
Nathan Lyon have the pads on. Five overs remain.

83rd over: Australia 265-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 53)

Whereas the conversation earlier was of ease, rhythm, and ‘picking-off’ runs, 
we’re now contemplating balls thattalk, angles across, and - that greatest of 
all reveals - Steve Smith facials. Rahat has joined Amir’s act. The boy from 
Sydney’s South almost beats mid-off to bring up his ton, but an outstanding, 
sprawling dive prevents him. Of course it does. This is getting a little 
difficult. Smith remains on 98.

82nd over: Australia 265-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 53)

Amir keeps it exceptionally tight as Smith increasingly wanders across his 
stumps in search for on-side runs. One ball lifts remarkably to beat the 
Australian captain’s outside edge yet again, as the tempo of the contest turns. 
Smith eventually succeeds in finding a run on the on-side. Handscomb executes 
an exceptionally tight leave to see out the over. Amir is bowling very well.

81st over: Australia 264-3 (Smith 97, Handscomb 53)

It’s Rahat from the other end, can he elicit the same movement as his 
colleague? On first evidence the answer is yes, but somehow it lacks the 
electricity of Amir’s. Still, Pakistan are a far better prospect in this 
scenario. Conversation continues about Smith’s edge. I said that ‘snicko’ had 
revealed it - I meant ‘hotspot’. No one appealed, what can you do? Handscomb 
sees through the over, leaving Smith on the brink of another ton at the other 
end. He’ll have to get past Amir under lights to achieve it. Stand by...

80th over: Australia 264-3 (Smith 97, Handscomb 53)

Amir returns with the new ball, which is incredible considering his position 
just over an hour ago. He takes the new pink ball - not quite in the 
titillating scenario we’d hoped earlier - but he achieves swing nonetheless. 
Provided Amir can stay fit, my bet is that the quality of this contest will 
ramp up a notch. Amir beats Smith with his first ball to him, and the crowd is 
‘oohing’ and ‘ahhing’ again. Did he hit it!?? Snicko is saying yes! Incredibly, 
no appeal! Smith survives and remains on 97. That was eventful. Welcome back 
Amir!

79th over: Australia 263-3 (Smith 97, Handscomb 52)

Both batsmen’s dominance is underlined by two things: easy runs and Ian Healy 
remarking on the ‘yoga like flexibility’ of a photographers sitting style. 
Facing the deteriorating threat of Yasir, Smith moves to 97.

That’s 80 overs, the new ball is now due..

78th over: Australia 259-3 (Smith 93, Handscomb 52)

I failed to mention earlier that Smith and Handscomb’s partnership has now 
exceeded 100. This session has truly turned on Amir’s departure. Ali returns to 
the attack and, despite looking dangerous at different stages today, looks more 
part-time than frontline as both Australians continue to pick off runs.

Handscomb reaches fifty

77th over: Australia 255-3 (Smith 90, Handscomb 51)


Peter Handscomb hits his second fifty in as many matches via a glide for four 
and copybook drive for three off the bowling of Riaz. It’s a promising 
beginning for the man who ply’s his trade at St Kilda, Victoria and now his 
country. I’m sure a number of cricket fans could get used to the image of the 
long-sleeved batting assassin who bats with the certitude of his own method.

76th over: Australia 248-3 (Smith 90, Handscomb 44)

Yasir’s questions seem to be diminishing in ‘oomph’ as Smith and Handscomb 
work him for a couple of singles each. Handscomb has quietly worked his way to 
another decent score; no doubt he’ll be eyeing more.

On Smith though, and speaking of grade cricket, there appears to be growing 
fascination with his connection to kit. He reportedly has more pairs of gloves 
than anyone can imagine. Some might say ‘he can do what he wants’. Others might 
offer Tim Rogers’ famous question though... ‘How much is enough?’

75th over: Australia 245-3 (Smith 89, Handscomb 42)

In brilliant news, Amir is apparently back on the field and Ian Chappell 
offers him sage advice from the commentary box to ‘never slide’. Meanwhile 
Smith stays good to the grade cricket adage that the best time tocash-in is in 
the last hour. He strikes two boundaries and it’s starting to look pretty 
ominous for Pakistan.

Just quickly, earlier I asked for photo evidence of Javed Miandad scoring a 
double-ton against Australia in an ‘I heart NY cap’. James Payten kindly 
tweeted the below in. Not full photographic evidence, but close. Anyone good

74th over: Australia 237-3 (Smith 81, Handscomb 42)

It’s difficult to think of a batsman who so rhythmically builds his score as 
does Steve Smith. Amidst a compelling battle with Yasir, he still manages to 
strike his own stylish blows. This over he whips one through mid-wicket for 
four (dancing down the pitch, of course), and laces one through cover for 
another two. Yasir is still bowling with spin and drift.

I have an entirely unrelated photoshop request to follow..

73rd over: Australia 230-3 (Smith 74, Handscomb 42)

Australia has now added 42 in the post-dinner session, and appear to be 
through the tough spell of the Wahab-Yasir axis. Rahat’s overs feel a little 
subdued in comparison, as Smith manages a single from his over.

72nd over: Australia 229-3 (Smith 73, Handscomb 42)

Yasir comes around the wicket to Handscomb, presumably in an attempt to ask a 
new question, as it were. The Victorian can consider that a small win, 
particularly as Yasir stays over the wicket to Smith. It’s a wonderful battle 
between all as both batsmen insist upon using their feet at every available 
opportunity. Meanwhile, a tough image to process below.
 Pakistan’s Mohammad Amir reacts after injuring his knee while fielding.

71st over: Australia 225-3 (Smith 72, Handscomb 39)

Rahat is reintroduced, probably where Amir would have bowled. It’s hard to 
overstate the impact of the 23-year-old’s injury. Rahat had only completed his 
post-dinner spell some 25 minutes ago and now returns looking fractionally 
lethargic. Smith and Handscomb each pick up singles as the fire somewhat 
dissipates from the contest. Yasir is a threat in his own right, though.

70th over: Australia 222-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 37)

Yasir curiously inserts a silly mid-off when bowling to Smith, perhaps 
detecting a fallibility when defending on the off-side. Despite Amir’s 
departure, Yasir’s danger remains. He gets one to bounce to conclude the over, 
and Smith does that jolty hand gesture immediately afterward to confirm it. 
Sort of looks like interpretive dance.

69th over: Australia 221-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 36) 

For posterity it should be added that Amir’s attempt to stop Handscomb’s shot 
was fruitless; the Australian picked up a boundary. The implications of Amir’s 
departure are huge. It probably takes the sting out of the pressure Pakistan 
were building, though the impact will probably be a little more long term. 
Wahab completes the over without incident.

Amir update: assisted by team-mates and in the presence of both team’s 
Doctors, Amir is assisted from the field. Play is understandably held up. He 
rises to his feet and alights the medicab. Any notion of him returning tonight, 
or for the match, seems unlikely. What a huge shame.

Oh no. In attempting to field a Handscomb pull, Amir digs his knee into the 
turf and goes down. His team surround him and for the moment, he’s staying 
down...

68th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

A beautiful over from Yasir, mixing pace, flight, spin and drift. Whereas 
Australia were rocketing along a few overs ago, a few maidens render the 
Wahab-Yasir axis on top for now. Is it the lights? Maybe. Just feels like 
excellent bowling. Sort of feel for Nic Maddison. Any danger of a bat in 
daylight?

67th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

You feel this is an important period in the match. Both Yasir and now Wahab 
are adopting attacking lines and lengths as the lights take effect. Handscomb, 
normally so assured on the back foot, worryingly shows all three stumps in 
attempting to defend Wahab’s thunderbolts. You’d never accuse a Test batsman of 
backing away, but it looks something close to it. Whether Wahab is full or 
short, Handscomb seems late. Nevertheless, he survives. This contest is 
starting to boil.

66th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

Yasir almost sneaks under Smith’s attempted pull shot from the crease, and 
catches Smith’s outside edge on the next delivery, which falls just short of 
Younis Khan at first slip. Wahab and Yasir taking on Smith and Handscomb is 
pretty good viewing here. Thankfully for Yasir, he’s bowling to two right 
handers which removes the bizarre consideration of that ugly leg-side line he 
adopted earlier in the day. He starts with a maiden and points-decision.

65th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

A number of runs have emerged from the early balls of Pakistan overs. Smith is 
all over a slightly overpitched Riaz delivery, hammering him through cover for 
four. Riaz’scomeback delivery (there must always be a comeback) sees Smith 
attempt to leave in typical windscreen-wiper fashion, only for the ball to 
catch the bottom of the bat. Smith then repeats the first shot for another 
boundary. Wahab is bending his back a little here and he’s making things 
happen, but most of it is going for Australia. Smith is all-of-a-sudden 71. 
Wahab’s attacking length shows that his team are just beginning to gamble for a 
breakthrough.

64th over: Australia 206-3 (Smith 62, Handscomb 31)

The faint echo of a Mexican Wave countdown greets the start of Ali’s over. 
Warne, commentating, cracks-wise about what a great bloke Ian Gould is, ‘one of 
the best on the Umpire’s circuit’. Actually think an ‘umpire’s circuit’ might 
be surprisingly good. Smith and Handscomb pick up one each as their partnership 
moves past fifty.

64th over: Australia 204-3 (Smith 61, Handscomb 30)

Rahat’s off, Riaz is on. The menacing quick err’s with a wide, though a 
similar follow-up delivery reveals his desire to find some swing. Such are the 
risks of aggressive bowling. It appears there is none - for him, at least. He 
comes around the wicket, a left-arm trajectory that almost feels owned by 
Mitchell Johnson - especially at this ground. Wouldn’t mind seeing similar 
menace, too. It’s an otherwise dry over.

63rd over: Australia 203-3 (Smith 61, Handscomb 30)

Ali continues and Handscomb is immediately dancing down the wicket to him. 
Twice he fails to beat mid-on, but on the third occasion he’s able to flay a 
wider ball behind point for four. This Australian start smells awfully like a 
Lehmann command to‘push the game forward’. It’s working. Still thinking about 
Miandad in the ‘I heart NY’ hat, too.

62nd over: Australia 199-3 (Smith 61, Handscomb 26)

Zero evidence so-far of night-time, pink ball, Gabba demons as the runs flow 
from both Smith and Handscomb’s blade. A couple of drives are notable less for 
style and more for how ordinary the bowling is. Twice already Australia has 
threatened to take the game away from Pakistan, and twice Pakistan has 
responded. You rarely get three chances to do so in an innings of Test cricket. 
I have nothing to back that up with, mind.

61st over: Australia 192-3 (Smith 57, Handscomb 23)

Azhar Ali, who caused more than a few problems at the back-end of the middle 
session, rolls in from the other end. Smith takes three with a hard back-cut 
that’s followed by a reasonably comical attempt to rope the ball in at the 
boundary. Handscomb skips down the deck to pick up one for himself.

60th over: Australia 188-3 (Smith 54, Handscomb 2)

It’s Rahat to commence evening proceedings and, speaking of rock ‘n roll, 
Handscomb responds to his first ball by cutting him hard behind point for four. 
He defends the rest of the over from the depths of his crease before a thick 
edge brings him two more. The shadows are lengthening but it still looks pretty 
light. Who will it be from the other end?

I’ve no idea whether Russell pushed out his Guardian piece from this morning, 
but if you’re up for a poignant cultural lens on Australia-Pakistan cricket, 
his piece is well worth a read.

Some Aus-Pakistan history in the lead-up to the first Test.

Sam Perry

Morning, afternoon, evening everyone – a pleasure to be here on this luminous 
occasion – literally – our first encounter of Test cricket on a Brisbane night. 
It’s Australia’s second day-night test of the summer, and my second shot at 
this OBO caper. For both, there’s a stark reality that sits underneath: we 
don’t know what will happen.

At face value, Australia should head into the session with a scoreboard 
advantage. Two wickets lost in the first, only one in the second. But given the 
uncertainty of what the pink ball may harvest tonight (still feels weird to 
write ‘tonight’), one more would probably have left matters even. Will Sarfraz 
Ahmed rue dropping Smith in that last over before the dinner break?

What comes next has arguably been the main talking point leading into this 
Test – a green Gabba wicket, a muggy Brisbane night, a pink ball, floodlights, 
an unsettled Australian middle order, and Amir. While the evidence so far today 
doesn’t point to major swing, it’s night time and it’s hot and the ball is a 
different colour…even the most fervent Australian hopes, deep down, for 
something wild. We’ll see.

In the meantime, I’ll be ticking the blog over throughout the break and we’ll 
rejoin play when the players return. If you want to get in touch – I’m at

Dinner on day one - Steve Smith is dropped by Sarfraz Ahmed!

59th over: Australia 181-3 (Smith 53, Handscomb 15)

Oh dear. The part-timer has somehow forced a false stroke from Steve Smith but 
the thin edge that results thuds into Sarfraz’s gloves and straight back out 
again onto the turf. Smith can’t believe his luck. Sarfraz is shattered. What a 
way to end the session. That wicket might have tilted it Pakistan’s way but the 
Aussie skipper survives and will press on after the 40-minute dinner break. Sam 
Perry will be the man taking you through the final session. Thanks for your 
company!

58th over: Australia 180-3 (Smith 53, Handscomb 15)

A maiden from Rahat! Handscomb really is counting down the deliveries until 
dinner. Peter Salmon is overcome by all the other distractions. “So a Test 
match in the middle, and an Olympic swimmer in the pool on the boundary. Can we 
not get a game of footy happening at fine leg, and some 400 heats going around 
the outside? Go the whole phys ed class atmosphere, where someone rings a bell 
every fifteen minutes and everyone rotates round to the next sport? God I hated 
phys ed.”

Speaking of distractions...

Peter Handscomb is probably being polite.

56th over: Australia 176-3 (Smith 52, Handscomb 12)

Rahat hasn’t covered himself in glory today but gets his chance for atonement 
with a couple of overs before the dinner break. He steams in, rocks into his 
action, and...gets belted through cover for four. Over-pitched. Again. That 
takes Steve Smith to his half-century from 93 deliveries and he’ll be loving 
himself a bit of Rahat. Ian Chappell, meanwhile, is worried that Yasir is being 
over-bowled. I’m more concerned that he’s not wearing any SPF 40+. He’s looking 
like boiled beetroot at the moment.
 Australian captain Steve Smith has reached 50 on day one at the Gabba.

55th over: Australia 173-3 (Smith 49, Handscomb 12)

STOP THE PRESSES: PETER HANDSCOMB HAS SCORED A RUN! Not only that, but it’s 
four as he gets down the pitch and cracks a straight drive past the bowler, who 
really should have stopped it. Then there’s a single. Calm down, Pete. By the 
end of the over he’s finding runs everywhere and Rahat is stopping balls with 
his feet in the outfield. That’s more like it.

54th over: Australia 165-3 (Smith 48, Handscomb 5)

Reader David Kalucy thinks Ian Chappell was onto something. “Poor Renshaw, I 
hope it wasn’t the nerves provoked by the grass in his shoe,” he says. “After 
the last few Tests we’re down to jinxes, and that new normal is just about 
waking up and reading the paper. Eternal hope for the baggy green.” Amir 
continues his miserly, probing efforts and sends down another maiden.

Peter Handscomb is really bogged down at the moment – five runs from 37 
deliveries and the pressure is mounting with every dot. Yasir Shah produces 
another maiden and ends it grinning maniacally, like a child frying an bull ant 
with a magnifying glass.

52nd over: Australia 165-3 (Smith 48, Handscomb 5)

Shane Warne is calling the Hobart debacle Steve Smith’s “lightbulb moment” 
now, which seems a little premature, though change has been as good as a 
holiday with this Australian side. Smith faces up to Amir now, which is 
probably for the best. He comfortably negotiates a maiden.

Meanwhile, Olympic champion swimmer Stephanie Rice is flying the flag for 
local sports heroes over on the pool deck. But of course.

51st over: Australia 165-3 (Smith 48, Handscomb 5)

Yasir Shah offers up a rare bad ball here and Steve Smith cashes in, slapping 
a full toss to the fence before picking up a single. Peter Handscomb is 
generally a very good player of spin but Yasir is causing him the odd problem 
here and the Pakistani is literally licking his lips.

As all that happens OBO favourite Robert McLiam Wilson arrives. “Musing this 
morning, as I so often do, upon the eccentricity and euphony of cricket 
mathematics, I was struck anew by the fell difference between 151 for 2 and 151 
for 3,” he writes.

“One is all sunny uplands near harvest time, the other all lightless skies and 
distant rumbles of menace. 47 for 1 is something the same (and 218 for 4). What 
is it about some rather festive scores that they become so depressing with the 
loss of a single wicket? I speak as someone who once went in to bat at 33 for 
9.”

I once went in to bat at 13-4 and was still standing there as the last wicket 
fell at 31. You’re right though: just looking at “151-3” makes me a bit 
anxious. It’s a score that says you’re about to be karmically punished for not 
visiting your Nan enough.

Our report from day one:

Smith century puts Australia in charge of first Test against Pakistan
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/15/smith-century-puts-australia-in-charge-of-first-test-against-pakistan> 
A pretty good day’s cricket in Brisbane, I thought…

Despite an otherwise unremarkable scoreline, it was a momentous day for 
cricket in Australia. Day-night cricket reached the Sunshine State for the 
first time, and brought with it an unprecedented level of conjecture over what 
the traditionally-humid city would serve up.

People often speak lazily about what it means to produce a ‘good wicket’, or 
what it means to have ‘good conditions’. Too often in this country we equate a 
hard, white wicket with ‘a good one’. Equally opposite, we’re quick to bemoan 
green-seamers then render free scoring impossible. This is before we even 
consider the commercial implications of fast-finishing tests. The latter issue 
was surely the biggest, if not most private, concern ofCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Australia ahead of today. What 
transpired, however, was a wicket and set of conditions that could truly be 
considered good – because it offered something to everyone.

It was, in the end, an excellent day for Australia – underscored by an innings 
of maturity by young buck Matt Renshaw. The knock had all the hallmarks of a 
fairytale: a toothy grin, a home ground and friends present. His departure 
wasn’t in keeping with the assuredness of his innings, but he will be buoyed by 
the result anyway. Eyebrows remained raised over Peter Handscomb’s methods, but 
perhaps without the same vigour as in Adelaide. His undefeated 64 included 
impressive periods of both attack and defence – a sure sign of his ability to 
adapt to a game’s scenario.

The day, of course, belonged to Australia’s captain. He did fly under the 
radar for most of his innings though, as Australian viewers continued to 
contemplate the wares of its new batsmen. By the time he reached his hundred, 
early reflections revealed an innings of both patience and style. He had some 
luck too.

Pakistan on the other hand can count themselves pretty unluck. Both Yasir and 
Amir threatened all day, and Yasir’s bowling partnership with Wahab after 
dinner could easily have turned the game. Sadly, Amir’s injury put paid to 
their bowling plans, and it allowed Australia enough time to re-seize the 
initiative and move the game away their opponents.

As tomorrow looms, eyes will be on Handscomb as Australia looks to solidify 
its batting group. Nic Maddinson will get his chance, and provided both current 
batsmen don’t perform remarkably, Maddinson should be able to bat in daylight. 
It could get difficult for Pakistan, but then again this is Australia, who have 
shown a capability to be five out-all out.

Join us tomorrow as we follow the action.

Sam
 
90th over: Australia 288-3 (Smith 110, Handscomb 64)

Yasir concludes the day with a smile. It’s uneventful as Smith takes a single 
off the back foot and Handscomb finishes the job. A little wrap to follow..

Finally, I was desperate to give the final word to Tristan Brumby-Rendell, who 
finally found the picture of Miandad I was after. Alas, image rights preclude 
me from posting it (and possibly my luddite-ness here). Suffice to say, Javed 
Miandad hearts New York.
 
89th over: Australia 287-3 (Smith 109, Handscomb 64)

More runs down the ground for both batsmen as the earlier parked bus now 
offers a sharp counter attacking threat. This is Bayern Munich 2013-esque as 
Smith and Handscomb suddenly look at ease again.

Enthralling as it’s been, I’ve remained at least equally interested in the 
matter of Miandad and the ‘I heart NY’ cap. A few developments:

<https://twitter.com/paytenj/status/809329858069151745>  
88th over: Australia 280-3 (Smith 106, Handscomb 60)

Of the array of strokes offered by both Smith and Handscomb this session, 
their driving down the ground has been particularly majestic. Here Handscomb 
collects three early in Rahat’s over, before a hard cut finds his top edge - 
sailing over first slip for four. Pakistan have really given everything to even 
the honours this session, and may be forgiven for feeling a little luckless. As 
the day winds down, the scoreboard will show a dominant Australian performance. 
It hasn’t always been so.
 
87th over: Australia 274-3 (Smith 106, Handscomb 54)

The tension breaks as Smith drives Amir down the ground for four to bring up 
his hundred. It’s been an innings of all gears, probably most impressive for 
his evident maturity through the nineties. Given the rate of his scoring 
leading up to that point, he could have been forgiven for expecting to maintain 
that for the remainder of the day. But resolute defence and that catchcry of 
his - resilience - saw him to the milestone. Of course, Amir finally catches 
his edge, only for the ball to run for four through that perenially vacant 
fourth slip region.
 
86th over: Australia 266-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 54)

Australia has officially parked the bus here, as Handscomb’s back foot defence 
repels Rahat. He offers no stroke to a few tempters outside off-stump - a 
different policy to that of 30 minutes ago. Efforts to contrive singles also 
appear to be off the table, and it very much appears as though Australia’s aims 
are now two-fold: ensure the captain gets his ton, and that no wickets are 
lost. It will be Amir to Smith to start the next over.
 
84th over: Australia 266-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 54)

Handscomb certainly knows where his off-stump is, as another couple of 
scorching Amir deliveries sear past his pegs. It’s hard to know where he’ll 
score from at the moment. Whatever the case, this is an excellent spell of 
bowling from Amir, who elicits an edge off the second last ball of his over 
that falls short of third slip. It brings Smith on strike for the last ball of 
the over...there is no run.

Cameras pan to the Australian dressing room, where both Nic Maddinson and 
Nathan Lyon have the pads on. Five overs remain.
 
83rd over: Australia 265-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 53)

Whereas the conversation earlier was of ease, rhythm, and ‘picking-off’ runs, 
we’re now contemplating balls thattalk, angles across, and - that greatest of 
all reveals - Steve Smith facials. Rahat has joined Amir’s act. The boy from 
Sydney’s South almost beats mid-off to bring up his ton, but an outstanding, 
sprawling dive prevents him. Of course it does. This is getting a little 
difficult. Smith remains on 98.
 
82nd over: Australia 265-3 (Smith 98, Handscomb 53)

Amir keeps it exceptionally tight as Smith increasingly wanders across his 
stumps in search for on-side runs. One ball lifts remarkably to beat the 
Australian captain’s outside edge yet again, as the tempo of the contest turns. 
Smith eventually succeeds in finding a run on the on-side. Handscomb executes 
an exceptionally tight leave to see out the over. Amir is bowling very well.
 
81st over: Australia 264-3 (Smith 97, Handscomb 53)

It’s Rahat from the other end, can he elicit the same movement as his 
colleague? On first evidence the answer is yes, but somehow it lacks the 
electricity of Amir’s. Still, Pakistan are a far better prospect in this 
scenario. Conversation continues about Smith’s edge. I said that ‘snicko’ had 
revealed it - I meant ‘hotspot’. No one appealed, what can you do? Handscomb 
sees through the over, leaving Smith on the brink of another ton at the other 
end. He’ll have to get past Amir under lights to achieve it. Stand by...
 
80th over: Australia 264-3 (Smith 97, Handscomb 53)

Amir returns with the new ball, which is incredible considering his position 
just over an hour ago. He takes the new pink ball - not quite in the 
titillating scenario we’d hoped earlier - but he achieves swing nonetheless. 
Provided Amir can stay fit, my bet is that the quality of this contest will 
ramp up a notch. Amir beats Smith with his first ball to him, and the crowd is 
‘oohing’ and ‘ahhing’ again. Did he hit it!?? Snicko is saying yes! Incredibly, 
no appeal! Smith survives and remains on 97. That was eventful. Welcome back 
Amir!
 
79th over: Australia 263-3 (Smith 97, Handscomb 52)

Both batsmen’s dominance is underlined by two things: easy runs and Ian Healy 
remarking on the ‘yoga like flexibility’ of a photographers sitting style. 
Facing the deteriorating threat of Yasir, Smith moves to 97.

That’s 80 overs, the new ball is now due..

 
78th over: Australia 259-3 (Smith 93, Handscomb 52)

I failed to mention earlier that Smith and Handscomb’s partnership has now 
exceeded 100. This session has truly turned on Amir’s departure. Ali returns to 
the attack and, despite looking dangerous at different stages today, looks more 
part-time than frontline as both Australians continue to pick off runs.
 
77th over: Australia 255-3 (Smith 90, Handscomb 51)


Peter Handscomb hits his second fifty in as many matches via a glide for four 
and copybook drive for three off the bowling of Riaz. It’s a promising 
beginning for the man who ply’s his trade at St Kilda, Victoria and now his 
country. I’m sure a number of cricket fans could get used to the image of the 
long-sleeved batting assassin who bats with the certitude of his own method.
 
76th over: Australia 248-3 (Smith 90, Handscomb 44)

Yasir’s questions seem to be diminishing in ‘oomph’ as Smith and Handscomb 
work him for a couple of singles each. Handscomb has quietly worked his way to 
another decent score; no doubt he’ll be eyeing more.

On Smith though, and speaking of grade cricket, there appears to be growing 
fascination with his connection to kit. He reportedly has more pairs of gloves 
than anyone can imagine. Some might say ‘he can do what he wants’. Others might 
offer Tim Rogers’ famous question though... ‘How much is enough?’
 
75th over: Australia 245-3 (Smith 89, Handscomb 42)

In brilliant news, Amir is apparently back on the field and Ian Chappell 
offers him sage advice from the commentary box to ‘never slide’. Meanwhile 
Smith stays good to the grade cricket adage that the best time tocash-in is in 
the last hour. He strikes two boundaries and it’s starting to look pretty 
ominous for Pakistan.
 
Just quickly, earlier I asked for photo evidence of Javed Miandad scoring a 
double-ton against Australia in an ‘I heart NY cap’. James Payten kindly 
tweeted the below in. Not full photographic evidence, but close. Anyone good 
(or bad) at photoshop?

That would appear to be drinks...
 
74th over: Australia 237-3 (Smith 81, Handscomb 42)

It’s difficult to think of a batsman who so rhythmically builds his score as 
does Steve Smith. Amidst a compelling battle with Yasir, he still manages to 
strike his own stylish blows. This over he whips one through mid-wicket for 
four (dancing down the pitch, of course), and laces one through cover for 
another two. Yasir is still bowling with spin and drift.

I have an entirely unrelated photoshop request to follow.. 

 
73rd over: Australia 230-3 (Smith 74, Handscomb 42)

Australia has now added 42 in the post-dinner session, and appear to be 
through the tough spell of the Wahab-Yasir axis. Rahat’s overs feel a little 
subdued in comparison, as Smith manages a single from his over.
 
72nd over: Australia 229-3 (Smith 73, Handscomb 42)

Yasir comes around the wicket to Handscomb, presumably in an attempt to ask a 
new question, as it were. The Victorian can consider that a small win, 
particularly as Yasir stays over the wicket to Smith. It’s a wonderful battle 
between all as both batsmen insist upon using their feet at every available 
opportunity. Meanwhile, a tough image to process below.
 Pakistan’s Mohammad Amir reacts after injuring his knee while fielding. 
Photograph: Tertius Pickard/AP  
71st over: Australia 225-3 (Smith 72, Handscomb 39)

Rahat is reintroduced, probably where Amir would have bowled. It’s hard to 
overstate the impact of the 23-year-old’s injury. Rahat had only completed his 
post-dinner spell some 25 minutes ago and now returns looking fractionally 
lethargic. Smith and Handscomb each pick up singles as the fire somewhat 
dissipates from the contest. Yasir is a threat in his own right, though.
 
70th over: Australia 222-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 37)

Yasir curiously inserts a silly mid-off when bowling to Smith, perhaps 
detecting a fallibility when defending on the off-side. Despite Amir’s 
departure, Yasir’s danger remains. He gets one to bounce to conclude the over, 
and Smith does that jolty hand gesture immediately afterward to confirm it. 
Sort of looks like interpretive dance.
 
69th over: Australia 221-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 36) 

For posterity it should be added that Amir’s attempt to stop Handscomb’s shot 
was fruitless; the Australian picked up a boundary. The implications of Amir’s 
departure are huge. It probably takes the sting out of the pressure Pakistan 
were building, though the impact will probably be a little more long term. 
Wahab completes the over without incident.
 
Amir update: assisted by team-mates and in the presence of both team’s 
Doctors, Amir is assisted from the field. Play is understandably held up. He 
rises to his feet and alights the medicab. Any notion of him returning tonight, 
or for the match, seems unlikely. What a huge shame.
 
69th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

Oh no. In attempting to field a Handscomb pull, Amir digs his knee into the 
turf and goes down. His team surround him and for the moment, he’s staying 
down...
 
68th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

A beautiful over from Yasir, mixing pace, flight, spin and drift. Whereas 
Australia were rocketing along a few overs ago, a few maidens render the 
Wahab-Yasir axis on top for now. Is it the lights? Maybe. Just feels like 
excellent bowling. Sort of feel for Nic Maddison. Any danger of a bat in 
daylight?
 
67th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

You feel this is an important period in the match. Both Yasir and now Wahab 
are adopting attacking lines and lengths as the lights take effect. Handscomb, 
normally so assured on the back foot, worryingly shows all three stumps in 
attempting to defend Wahab’s thunderbolts. You’d never accuse a Test batsman of 
backing away, but it looks something close to it. Whether Wahab is full or 
short, Handscomb seems late. Nevertheless, he survives. This contest is 
starting to boil.
 
66th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

Yasir almost sneaks under Smith’s attempted pull shot from the crease, and 
catches Smith’s outside edge on the next delivery, which falls just short of 
Younis Khan at first slip. Wahab and Yasir taking on Smith and Handscomb is 
pretty good viewing here. Thankfully for Yasir, he’s bowling to two right 
handers which removes the bizarre consideration of that ugly leg-side line he 
adopted earlier in the day. He starts with a maiden and points-decision.
 
It’s Yasir Shah from the other end now...
 
65th over: Australia 216-3 (Smith 71, Handscomb 31)

A number of runs have emerged from the early balls of Pakistan overs. Smith is 
all over a slightly overpitched Riaz delivery, hammering him through cover for 
four. Riaz’scomeback delivery (there must always be a comeback) sees Smith 
attempt to leave in typical windscreen-wiper fashion, only for the ball to 
catch the bottom of the bat. Smith then repeats the first shot for another 
boundary. Wahab is bending his back a little here and he’s making things 
happen, but most of it is going for Australia. Smith is all-of-a-sudden 71. 
Wahab’s attacking length shows that his team are just beginning to gamble for a 
breakthrough.
 
64th over: Australia 206-3 (Smith 62, Handscomb 31)

The faint echo of a Mexican Wave countdown greets the start of Ali’s over. 
Warne, commentating, cracks-wise about what a great bloke Ian Gould is, ‘one of 
the best on the Umpire’s circuit’. Actually think an ‘umpire’s circuit’ might 
be surprisingly good. Smith and Handscomb pick up one each as their partnership 
moves past fifty.
 
64th over: Australia 204-3 (Smith 61, Handscomb 30)

Rahat’s off, Riaz is on. The menacing quick err’s with a wide, though a 
similar follow-up delivery reveals his desire to find some swing. Such are the 
risks of aggressive bowling. It appears there is none - for him, at least. He 
comes around the wicket, a left-arm trajectory that almost feels owned by 
Mitchell Johnson - especially at this ground. Wouldn’t mind seeing similar 
menace, too. It’s an otherwise dry over.
 
63rd over: Australia 203-3 (Smith 61, Handscomb 30)

Ali continues and Handscomb is immediately dancing down the wicket to him. 
Twice he fails to beat mid-on, but on the third occasion he’s able to flay a 
wider ball behind point for four. This Australian start smells awfully like a 
Lehmann command to‘push the game forward’. It’s working. Still thinking about 
Miandad in the ‘I heart NY’ hat, too.
 
62nd over: Australia 199-3 (Smith 61, Handscomb 26)

Zero evidence so-far of night-time, pink ball, Gabba demons as the runs flow 
from both Smith and Handscomb’s blade. A couple of drives are notable less for 
style and more for how ordinary the bowling is. Twice already Australia has 
threatened to take the game away from Pakistan, and twice Pakistan has 
responded. You rarely get three chances to do so in an innings of Test cricket. 
I have nothing to back that up with, mind.
 
61st over: Australia 192-3 (Smith 57, Handscomb 23)

Azhar Ali, who caused more than a few problems at the back-end of the middle 
session, rolls in from the other end. Smith takes three with a hard back-cut 
that’s followed by a reasonably comical attempt to rope the ball in at the 
boundary. Handscomb skips down the deck to pick up one for himself.
 
60th over: Australia 188-3 (Smith 54, Handscomb 2)

It’s Rahat to commence evening proceedings and, speaking of rock ‘n roll, 
Handscomb responds to his first ball by cutting him hard behind point for four. 
He defends the rest of the over from the depths of his crease before a thick 
edge brings him two more. The shadows are lengthening but it still looks pretty 
light. Who will it be from the other end?
 
On Russell’s piece below, if anyone, anyone, has an image of Javed Miandad 
batting against wearing an ‘I heart NY’ hat - I would be eternally grateful. 
Could anything be more rock ‘n roll in cricket?
 
I’ve no idea whether Russell pushed out his Guardian piece from this morning, 
but if you’re up for a poignant cultural lens on Australia-Pakistan cricket, 
his piece is well worth a read.

<https://twitter.com/rustyjacko/status/809188408987820032>  
Morning, afternoon, evening everyone – a pleasure to be here on this luminous 
occasion – literally – our first encounter of Test cricket on a Brisbane night. 
It’s Australia’s second day-night test of the summer, and my second shot at 
this OBO caper. For both, there’s a stark reality that sits underneath: we 
don’t know what will happen.

At face value, Australia should head into the session with a scoreboard 
advantage. Two wickets lost in the first, only one in the second. But given the 
uncertainty of what the pink ball may harvest tonight (still feels weird to 
write ‘tonight’), one more would probably have left matters even. Will Sarfraz 
Ahmed rue dropping Smith in that last over before the dinner break?

What comes next has arguably been the main talking point leading into this 
Test – a green Gabba wicket, a muggy Brisbane night, a pink ball, floodlights, 
an unsettled Australian middle order, and Amir. While the evidence so far today 
doesn’t point to major swing, it’s night time and it’s hot and the ball is a 
different colour…even the most fervent Australian hopes, deep down, for 
something wild. We’ll see.

In the meantime, I’ll be ticking the blog over throughout the break and we’ll 
rejoin play when the players return. If you want to get in touch – I’m at

Oh dear. The part-timer has somehow forced a false stroke from Steve Smith but 
the thin edge that results thuds into Sarfraz’s gloves and straight back out 
again onto the turf. Smith can’t believe his luck. Sarfraz is shattered. What a 
way to end the session. That wicket might have tilted it Pakistan’s way but the 
Aussie skipper survives and will press on after the 40-minute dinner break. Sam 
Perry will be the man taking you through the final session. Thanks for your 
company!
 
58th over: Australia 180-3 (Smith 53, Handscomb 15)

A maiden from Rahat! Handscomb really is counting down the deliveries until 
dinner. Peter Salmon is overcome by all the other distractions. “So a Test 
match in the middle, and an Olympic swimmer in the pool on the boundary. Can we 
not get a game of footy happening at fine leg, and some 400 heats going around 
the outside? Go the whole phys ed class atmosphere, where someone rings a bell 
every fifteen minutes and everyone rotates round to the next sport? God I hated 
phys ed.”

Yasir finally gets a rest and Azhar Ali returns with his leggie, as per the 
closing stages of the first session. It’s not as bad as his over earlier, but 
Peter Handscomb is probably being polite.

56th over: Australia 176-3 (Smith 52, Handscomb 12)

Rahat hasn’t covered himself in glory today but gets his chance for atonement 
with a couple of overs before the dinner break. He steams in, rocks into his 
action, and...gets belted through cover for four. Over-pitched. Again. That 
takes Steve Smith to his half-century from 93 deliveries and he’ll be loving 
himself a bit of Rahat. Ian Chappell, meanwhile, is worried that Yasir is being 
over-bowled. I’m more concerned that he’s not wearing any SPF 40+. He’s looking 
like boiled beetroot at the moment.

STOP THE PRESSES: PETER HANDSCOMB HAS SCORED A RUN! Not only that, but it’s 
four as he gets down the pitch and cracks a straight drive past the bowler, who 
really should have stopped it. Then there’s a single. Calm down, Pete. By the 
end of the over he’s finding runs everywhere and Rahat is stopping balls with 
his feet in the outfield. That’s more like it.

Reader David Kalucy thinks Ian Chappell was onto something. “Poor Renshaw, I 
hope it wasn’t the nerves provoked by the grass in his shoe,” he says. “After 
the last few Tests we’re down to jinxes, and that new normal is just about 
waking up and reading the paper. Eternal hope for the baggy green.” Amir 
continues his miserly, probing efforts and sends down another maiden.

Peter Handscomb is really bogged down at the moment – five runs from 37 
deliveries and the pressure is mounting with every dot. Yasir Shah produces 
another maiden and ends it grinning maniacally, like a child frying an bull ant 
with a magnifying glass.

Shane Warne is calling the Hobart debacle Steve Smith’s “lightbulb moment” 
now, which seems a little premature, though change has been as good as a 
holiday with this Australian side. Smith faces up to Amir now, which is 
probably for the best. He comfortably negotiates a maiden.

Meanwhile, Olympic champion swimmer Stephanie Rice is flying the flag for 
local sports heroes over on the pool deck. But of course.

Yasir Shah offers up a rare bad ball here and Steve Smith cashes in, slapping 
a full toss to the fence before picking up a single. Peter Handscomb is 
generally a very good player of spin but Yasir is causing him the odd problem 
here and the Pakistani is literally licking his lips.

As all that happens OBO favourite Robert McLiam Wilson arrives. “Musing this 
morning, as I so often do, upon the eccentricity and euphony of cricket 
mathematics, I was struck anew by the fell difference between 151 for 2 and 151 
for 3,” he writes.

“One is all sunny uplands near harvest time, the other all lightless skies and 
distant rumbles of menace. 47 for 1 is something the same (and 218 for 4). What 
is it about some rather festive scores that they become so depressing with the 
loss of a single wicket? I speak as someone who once went in to bat at 33 for 
9.”

I once went in to bat at 13-4 and was still standing there as the last wicket 
fell at 31. You’re right though: just looking at “151-3” makes me a bit 
anxious. It’s a score that says you’re about to be karmically punished for not 
visiting your Nan enough.
