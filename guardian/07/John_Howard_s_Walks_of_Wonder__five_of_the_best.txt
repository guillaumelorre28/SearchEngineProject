Long-serving former prime minister John Howard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/john-howard> was perhaps best known 
for his walks. That, and WorkChoices. But definitely the walks. In fact, he 
said so himself recently: “I’m associated with walks.”

Howard’s name is so synonymous with tracksuited rambling that Questacon, the 
ACT-based interactive science museum, asked permission to name one of its 
“Walks of Wonder” after the former PM.

“Every institution, building and path reveals amazing science right under your 
nose,” Questacon wrote of the new walking track, which follows Howard’s prime 
ministerial route around the parliamentary triangle.

“Why does lichen grow on only one side of a tree? Does sound always echo? How 
old is the ground we walk on? Find the answer to these and more on the Walk of 
Wonder.”

But although lichen growing on trees recalls the style and also appearance of 
our former leader, it’s not the only highlight of his long term in office. To 
commemorate his other achievements, here are five more John Howard Walks of 
Wonder you could take.

Reconciliation Perambulation
Reconciliation 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/howard/kirribili/> 
Begin at Kirribilli House, Sydney. Take a short stroll up the hill to the 
stairs at the northern end of the Harbour Bridge. Equivocate for a moment about 
whether you should join in a massive popular protest for Indigenous rights, 
then head to the pub for a schooner of practical reconciliation before walking 
home.

Along the Waterfront
Waterfront

Start at the Melbourne Club. Enjoy the picturesque southern capital as you 
head to the Port of Melbourne via Crown Casino and the waterfront. This one is 
fantastic for dog owners (and trainers) but doesn’t really suit more organised 
groups. Recommended dress: balaclava and military fatigues.

The Brough Stuff
The Intervention 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/howard/central-aus/> 
Take a lot of water for this Walk of Wonder, which begins at former Indigenous 
Affairs Minister Mal Brough’s electorate office on the Sunshine coast. Take a 
short stroll to Mutitjulu, the Central Australian Indigenous community where 
the intervention began. Catch your breath before heading toOombulgurri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/27/the-trauma-of-oombulgurris-demolition-will-be-repeated-across-western-australia>
, the first remote community to be evicted. When you arrive you’ll have plenty 
of time to ponder your achievements.

Operation Iraqi Fitness
Iraq <https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/howard/iraq/> 
Not for the faint hearted! Celebrate the SAS’s first successful mission in 
Iraq at Al Asad Airbase, before heading to Fallujah, the site of a 2004 battle
planned and executed 
<https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2009/01-02/a-solider-s-view-of-the-iraq-war/> 
by Australian Major General Jim Molan. You’ll be tired by the time you make it 
to Baghdad, so kickback and relax at the former Australian Wheat Board offices.

You’ve Bennelong Way, Baby!
Canberra <https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/howard/canberra/> 
This Walk of Wonder is best begun on your ear outside parliament house in 
Canberra, Take a long stroll up the Princes Highway to the ABC offices at 
Ultimo, enjoy the bias, and then it’s a quick skip over to Bennelong, where 
you’ll be surprised at how much has changed since your last visit.
