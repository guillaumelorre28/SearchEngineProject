Jeff Lewis makes a plea for an updated version of Cathy Come Home (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/27/wanted-a-cathy-come-home-for-the-21st-century>
, 28 September). Ken Loach’s new film I, Daniel Blake describes the present 
iniquities that exist for those drawn into the benefits and housing support 
system in England. It is as poignant and concerning as Cathy Come Home, and 
should be viewed by all our politicians.

, 4 October). Fair enough. But why should anyone take a Church of England 
priest seriously when the head of his church (the Queen) and her deputy (the 
archbishop of Canterbury) live in palaces?

• The six English players that made up half of the European Ryder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> team contributed just one point to 
its overall tally of 11. Is this another example of the Brexit strategy, one 
more shameful attempt to sabotage the European ideal?

• Masterful omission by the Guardian of the last word(s) of John Crace’s Tory 
conference sketch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/vampire-of-the-spirit-philip-hammond-takes-dullness-to-a-whole-new-level>
: “She was followed on to the stage by Liam Fox, whom the Tories considered to 
be an….” Please do not inform us of his intended finale, as imagination can 
fill the gap very adequately.
