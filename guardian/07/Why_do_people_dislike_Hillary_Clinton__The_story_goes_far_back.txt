There is – and perhaps there always will be – a dedicated group of people who 
don’t knowHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
personally, but nonetheless hate her.

Whether they are truly a “vast rightwing conspiracy 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/22/hillary-was-right-your-interactive-guide-to-the-vast-right-wing-conspiracy.html>
” (as Clinton called them in 1998) or just many in number and conservative in 
outlook, there’s no arguing that they exist or that they continue to try to 
influence public opinion on the Democratic nominee.


But even if people consider themselves savvy enough to reject the strangest 
conspiracy theories 
<http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/hillary-clinton-conspiracy-theories>
 (sample claims include that she is a mass-murderer, a closeted lesbian faking 
her 40-year marriage, a member of the Illuminati and/or an agent of the devil 
himself), there seems little doubt that an undercurrent of hostility spanning 
decades has had an impact upon how she is viewed.

Why Hillary Clinton matters to mothers and daughters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/03/mothers-daughters-hillary-clinton-video>
Clinton’s unfavorability rating may not be as low as Donald Trump’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/trump-clinton-unpopularity-2016-election-prediction-winner>
, but in an election year which has frequently degenerated into name-calling, 
she has attracted invective from both the left and the right. Polls have 
frequently cited the public view that she is not trusted, while Trump has 
rallied his supporters with the “Crooked Hillary” epithet.

Her links to Wall Street, her missing emails and her supposed responsibility 
for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi 
consulate are the ostensible reasons for some deeply personal attacks in 2016. 
But the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper.

Craig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a 
conservative political consultant, said that, when Hillary Clinton arrived in 
Washington DC as first lady, “she came from Little Rock with a reputation 
already established” as “such a militant feminist, difficult to deal with”.

He noted that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill 
Clinton was first elected governor, because shekept her maiden name 
<http://www.aol.com/article/2015/05/15/hillary-clinton-explains-why-she-didnt-take-bills-name-in-unea/21183743/>
.“Here she comes, the feminist from Wellesley and Yale,” Shirley explained of 
the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time, “down to Little Rock and brings 
her attitudes with her”.

There’s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on 
a lot of people

So by the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during Bill 
Clinton’s presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already 
had an idea of who they understood Hillary Clinton to be – a potential 
liability to her husband’s political career whose feminism and ambition were a 
bit unseemly.


And, as she noted in her first autobiography 
<https://www.amazon.com/Living-History-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/144237554X>, 
she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative. First, 
there was her much-maligned “I’m not sitting here some little woman standing by 
my man like Tammy Wynette”comment 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/flowers012792.htm>
 in response to a reporter’s assertion that she and her husband had “some sort 
of understanding and arrangement” about his infidelity.

Then, her out-of-context “I suppose I could have stayed home and baked 
cookies” comment 
<https://books.google.com/books?id=67DB9krBq2oC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=those+of+us+who+tried+to+have+a+career,+tried+to+have+an+independent+life&source=bl&ots=D46zu8jSWg&sig=mEPWT7vdxG_7Gi_Cgfww4jPblHE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivrsvY05PMAhWIHT4KHVIYC4cQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=those%20of%20us%20who%20tried%20to%20have%20a%20career%2C%20tried%20to%20have%20an%20independent%20life&f=false>
, which came in response to attacks, which the Clintons denied, by 
now-California governor Jerry Brown that she had only been a successful lawyer 
because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should 
have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady.

And then, of course, came the scandals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-scandals>
 in which she was involved: Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she’d 
invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment 
illegally; and Travelgate, in which she – contrary to the then-normal practice 
of leaving the business of the White House to the president’s staff – was said 
to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally 
was popular with the mostly-male White House press corps whose travel he 
arranged.

The key question raised about Whitewater and Travelgate was not whether 
Clinton had done anything actually wrong, but whether she had used illegal 
means to try to keep the media from finding out. The Starr investigation, which 
eventually resulted in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, found that she had not, but 
by that time her reputation was established as someone unfriendly to the media 
who also maybe did not do the right thing.

This business of people ‘not liking’ her is shaped ... by what we think people 
in authority ought to look like
Elaine Kamarck, Brookings Institution fellow 
Shirley conceded that “the press pounded on her” first in Arkansas and then in 
Washington, but did not believe that affected her relationship with the media, 
or that it was a driving factor in people’s attitudes towards her. “There’s 
something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of 
people,” he said. “People don’t like to be talked down to, and she has a 
terrible habit of talking down to people, with that smirk.”

However, Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who 
served in Bill Clinton’s administration, said she did not think that people’s 
dislike of Hillary Clinton is her own fault. “This business of people ‘not 
liking’ her is shaped by expectations, by television, by what we think people 
in authority ought to look like, and not who she actually is,” she said.


“She is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians,” 
she said. But while it is rare that people will compare a male politician they 
do not like to their fathers Kamarck noted that Clinton “reminds people of 
their mothers, or the schoolteacher they didn’t like.” (References to a “
nagging wife 
<http://mediamatters.org/research/2008/01/04/fox-news-graphic-rudov-clintons-nagging-voice-i/142056>
” and “bitchy wife <https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/780594882104598528>” 
are also common.)

“I think there’s some misogyny in that,” said Kamarck, noting that it’s 
exceedingly common for men who don’t hew to conventional standards of 
attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are 
more likely to be granted that visibility when they are younger and if they 
meet traditional beauty standards.

“We will overcome this but, right now, the world is accustomed to saying old 
men are fine, they’re strong, they’re wise,” she added. “Old women, we’re not 
so sure.”
