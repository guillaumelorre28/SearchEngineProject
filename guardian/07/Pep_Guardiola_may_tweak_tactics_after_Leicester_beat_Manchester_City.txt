Pep Guardiola admitted that he needs to tweak his approach to the Premier 
League but denied that there was any need for a major change afterwatching his

.

The visitors were 2-0 down after five minutes at the King Power and then 
conceded two more goals before striking back with a couple of their own late 
on. Their defending was weak throughout, as they failed to combat the speed, 
power and directness of Leicester, whose long passes and counterattacking 
flummoxed the away side.

However Guardiola absolved his players of any blame, even John Stones, whose 
slack backpass allowed Jamie Vardy to complete a hat-trick, the player’s first 
since he scored three for Fleetwood Town in a Conference game in 2012 against 
Ebbsfleet.

“I’m not disappointed with my players,” Guardiola said. “I know my players, I 
know how they train, they work hard to make things perfect. We knew [Leicester] 
would be focusedafter losing 5-0 [in the Champions League]

 and here they believed really well, the long balls, the second balls. We don’t 
control now, maybe for my mistake.

“I have to improve to solve that, it’s true,” he continued before maintaining 
that his approach is generally bearing fruit. “I want to play the football that 
I feel. Because it’s simple like that to concede few goals and try to score 
more. The basics of the way we play this season – except a few times – was 
quite good.

“So I cannot say today that we played bad, that we didn’t play with the 
intention to create. But of course we conceded a lot of goals. I try to control 
games – here I cannot do that, I have to analyse why.”

That, he stressed, did not mean he would contemplate radical change. “Of 
course I will be the same. Of course there are some special things in the 
Premier League but the pitch is the same and it’s 11 v 11. I have to control 
the little differences between the other leagues but the idea I think is good.”

Claudio Ranieri was not about to get carried away with his team’s victory. 
They had started the match one point above the relegation zone and the manager 
stopped short of declaring this a turning point. “This is just a little step 
because we now we have to think about the next match. We will be able to tell 
in two or three months whether it’s a turning point, now it’s too early. For 
this reason I want to wait for the next two matches, ” he said.

Ranieri said a post-Porto inquest following their midweek defeat helped to 
inspire the reigning champions. “We spoke a lot about everything but this time 
the words go in the right direction, not only mine. The players contributed,” 
Ranieri said.

“We must be upset with our performance [in Porto] because it wasn’t good 
enough and the fans are always behind us. It’s important to say: ‘We are here.’

“It’s important the players feel better, with more confidence because we can 
do this.”
