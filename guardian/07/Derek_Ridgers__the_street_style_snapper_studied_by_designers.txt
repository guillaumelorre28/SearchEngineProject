If you google subcultural style, a Derek Ridgers picture will be close to the 
top of the image search results. The 66-year-old has been taking pictures for 
more than 40 years, with mods, punks, skinheads and ravers all subject to his 
gaze. It’s over the last 10 that his name has been dropped by a new generation 
– largely thanks to books of his photographs from the 70s and 80s.78/87

 Flanagan, Kings Road 1983 Photograph: Derek Ridgers 
Ridgers started taking pictures in his early 20s on nights out and at gigs 
when working as an art director at an advertising agency, and a camera brand 
became his client. “My boss told me to start taking pictures using their 
camera,” he remembers. “I was pretending to be a photographer at first so I 
could get closer to the band. I had Thomas fromBlow-Up  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xz1utzILj4>as a model, girls on tap and a 
convertible Rolls-Royce. Neither happened. I already had a family by that 
point.” Ridgers regrets not starting earlier. “I missed a lot of potential 
pictures,” he says. “I started going to gigs when I was 16 and was right at the 
front when I saw Hendrix. I could have operated his pedals for him.”

 Babs, Soho 1987 Photograph: Derek Ridgers 
Instead, although Ridgers went on to work for the NME, it’s his images of the 
non-famous – the crowds at clubs like Billy’s and Taboo in the 70s and 80s, 
rather than the stars – that have stood the test of time, partly because they 
crackle with life and energy. There’s skinhead girls in feather haircuts and 
denim jackets, men at the Blitz in wigs and makeup, a punk with a peroxide 
crewcut holding a plastic cup in one hand, the other arm around a mate. It’s 
thanks to pictures like these that the word punk conjures up images of spiked 
hair and ripped jeans. They’re proto-street-style images, namechecked by 
designers and studied by young people out for a new look beyond the realms of 
Instagram.

 Acid Daze 1987 Photograph: Derek Ridgers 
Ridgers is reluctant to see them as totally reliable documents of style at any 
time, however. “If I was to go to a club I might take pictures of five people 
and the other 100 came straight from the office,” he says. “I have 1,000 
pictures from the 80s but that’s not even a minute of reality is it?” As 
minutes go, though, it’s one we’ll be poring over for a while yet.
