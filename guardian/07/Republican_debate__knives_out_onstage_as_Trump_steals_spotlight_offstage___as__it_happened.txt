Tom McCarthy

The seventh Republican presidential debate - and the first without the 
presence ofDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, who 
decided to hold an event of his own elsewhere in Des Moines, Iowa – is in the 
can. Here’s what we learned:

 * The knives were out for Texas senator Ted Cruz, who is polling second behind
 Trump in Iowa. Florida senator Marco Rubio said Cruz’s campaign was built on a 
“lie” of shifting positions for votes. 
 * It was a substantive debate. Body cameras for police, Libya, Iran, Kim 
Davis, mental illness, Bridgegate, immigration, Isis, Obamacare, veterans’ 
affairs, Bill Clinton’s affairs – it was all in there. 
 * Speaking of shifting positions, the moderators strived to pin Cruz and 
Rubio down on immigration, using video medleys of their most blatant calls for 
a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants to prove that they had in 
the past supported a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. The pair 
waffled. 
 * The absent Trump came under early attack. “I’m a maniac, and everyone on 
this stage is stupid, fat and ugly,” said Cruz. “And Ben, you’re a terrible 
surgeon. And now that we’ve got the Donald Trump portion out of the way ... ” 
 * For multiple candidates it was their peppiest outing yet. Former Florida 
governorJeb Bush was notably animated, accusing Rubio of having “cut and run” 
on immigration. Retired neurosurgeonBen Carson produced the memorable line: 
“Putin is a one-horse country: oil and energy.”

 * The crowd seemed against Cruz, booing him when he tried to wrest more time 
from the moderators. 
 * The candidates, especially New Jersey governor Chris Christie, attacked 
Clinton. Rubio said that “Hillary does not want to run against me, but I cannot 
wait to run against her.” 
 * Kentucky senator Rand Paul took a stand against government surveillance. 
“The bulk collection of your phone data ... did not stop one terrorist attack,” 
he said. 
 * A dutiful John Kasich explained how his experience as Ohio governor would 
help him deal with everything from the Flint, Michigan, water crisis to health 
care reform to the challenge of cyber warfare. 
That’s all from us tonight. Thanks for reading.

Trump event: coda

Scott Bixby

Perhaps the most shocking element of the “Donald J Trump Special Event to 
Benefit Veterans Organizations” wasits utter failure to shock.

In a vacuum, the idea of the party’s frontrunner ditching the final primary 
debate four days ahead of theIowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> 
caucuses is completely insane - a massive departure from the rules of political 
gravity. Had you told any political reporter six months ago that said 
frontrunner would then host a concurrent event three miles away, with the vague 
goal of raising money for unnamed veterans’ organizations, featuring 
appearances by the two lowest-ranked members of the field of candidates, you 
would’ve been laughed out of the room.

But - and someday we’ll get tired of saying this, we swear - Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is different. Just when you 
think he’s reached new heights (or new lows), Trump goes farther, harder, 
rougher, lower than you ever thought he would.

Which is why, counterintuitively, his “special event” didn’t seem all that 
special. Trump’s months-long feud with Fox News and Megyn Kelly built up 
expectations that no political rally could live up to. Even the appearance of 
viral YouTube stars, multiple presidential candidates, his famous daughter, a 
billionaire and his trophy wife, and an honest-to-goodness war hero failed to 
raise our pulse. Even Trump’s infamous crowds seemed subdued - as protesters 
interrupted the proceedings with chants of “we love veterans, Trump loves war”, 
it took Trump’s acolytes nearly a minute to muster the energy for chants of 
“Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!”

The billionaire frontrunner may be a victim of his own outlandishness. After 
calling for a 2,000-mile wall, a ban on Muslim immigrants and for the 
deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, what new policy could 
surprise us? After taunting a disabled reporter, chalking Kelly’s aggressive 
questioning up to menstruation and labeling John McCain a fake war hero, who 
else could he possibly insult? Short of calling for a preemptive nuclear strike 
on Iran or a sequel to the Mexican-American War, it’s hard to imagine what else 
Trump might be able to shock us with.

If his “special event” was any indication, the world’s greatest showman may 
finally be running out of tricks.

Richard Wolffe

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> dodges his ethanol 
subsidies challenge by asserting again that ethanol will take over the world 
just as soon as he can stop subsidies for oil. He says all subsidies should go 
- for ethanol and oil. It’s a curious argument. Corn would not be grown in Iowa 
without government subsidies. If you remove those subsidies, there won’t be any 
ethanol to compete with oil.

Cruz likes to say that Representative Steve King stands with him so he can’t 
be all bad on ethanol. The first half of that sentence is true: King is with 
Cruz. But whenever Cruz starts talking about ethanol subsidies, King looks like 
he’d rather be somewhere else. The smile disappears and he looks shiftily 
across theIowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> crowds.

I’m fact-checking Ben Carson’s claim that “Putin is a one-horse country”. I 
don’t know about horse men but I can tell you that as a country, Russia has an 
abundance of horses.

In fact, Russia has one of the highest horse populations in the world 
according to data fromthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations <http://faostat.fao.org/site/573/default.aspx#ancor>. In 2012, Russia 
produced and/or slaughtered 279,882 horses (just behind the US’s 280,863). 
China tops the list by a long way though: 1,608,404 horses.

Closing statements

Tom McCarthy

Paul: I’m an eye surgeon. I’m a senator. It’s amazing. I’m worried about the 
debt. I’m the one true fiscal conservative. [Big wild ridiculous college 
cheering]

Kasich: We look at each other and say why can’t we solve problems. Well I’ve 
got news. We can. We need to stay positive. Set the tune as conservatives but 
invite other people in to be part of that orchestra. Work together.

Christie: 9/11. My wife trapped in her building for 6 hours. Terrorism is 
scary. We need a president who knows what it means to face the possibility of 
loss. No one will keep this country safer than I will.

Bush: We need a conservative leader. I’ve a proven record. I have a plan. 
Restore the military. Keep us safe. Defeat Hillary Clinton. I ask for your 
support. I will make you proud.

Carson: Thanks Iowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>. Recites the 
preamble to the Constitution. Folks it’s not too late. Enough said.

Rubio: America’s light is shining on the world but Obama dimmed it. Caucus for 
me. America’s light will shine again.

Cruz: 93 hours. The media noise will soon be over. It’s time for Iowa to 
decide. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the Constitution and 
repeal Obamacare. Pray on it. Caucus for us.

Curtain.

Vladimir Putin may be a one-horse country, in Ben Carson’s estimation

Ben Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> told the audience 
in Iowa that Putin is a one-horse country. It’s not clear what the former brain 
surgeon meant by that. But it is clear that Vladimir Putin sure does like 
horses.

In fact, the “interests” section <http://eng.putin.kremlin.ru/interests#top> 
of his personal website has a whole section devoted to horse riding. He enjoys 
hand-feeding horses as well as riding them around. Full, sweet, quote:

Vladimir Putin feels confident in the saddle so horseback riding for him is a 
chance to rest. On August 3, 2009 Putin took a one-day break and spent it in 
Tuva. At one of the stops he met with a local shepherd, who invited him to his 
home, and they went there on horseback.

During his working visit to the Republic of Khakassia, Putin travelled to the 
foothills of Karatash, near Abakan. There, he hand-fed local horses and drank a 
cup of tea, cooked over a campfire, and then went riding.

Obviously there is this, too:
 Putin, on a horse. Photograph: RIA Novosti/Reuters

Cruz is asked about the six-term governor of Iowa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>, Terry Branstad, opposing his 
candidacy, particularly over Cruz’s opposition to ethanol.

“I don’t believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers, and 
there should be no mandates, or no subsidies whatsoever,” Cruz says.


He says he does not oppose ethanol: He would phase out the ethanol mandate 
over five years but in the context of no mandates for anyone.

Cruz points out that Iowa Rep. Steve King, local boy made good, supports his 
candidacy.

environment in the country. “It’s important for us to be careful about the 
language we use. Disparaging women. Disparaging Hispanics. That’s not a sign of 
strength. Making fun of disabled people?”

The seventh Republican presidential debate - and the first without the 
presence ofDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, who 
decided to hold an event of his own elsewhere in Des Moines, Iowa – is in the 
can. Here’s what we learned:

 * The knives were out for Texas senator Ted Cruz, who is polling second behind
 Trump in Iowa. Florida senator Marco Rubio said Cruz’s campaign was built on a 
“lie” of shifting positions for votes. 
 * It was a substantive debate. Body cameras for police, Libya, Iran, Kim 
Davis, mental illness, Bridgegate, immigration, Isis, Obamacare, veterans’ 
affairs, Bill Clinton’s affairs – it was all in there. 
 * Speaking of shifting positions, the moderators strived to pin Cruz and 
Rubio down on immigration, using video medleys of their most blatant calls for 
a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants to prove that they had in 
the past supported a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. The pair 
waffled. 
 * The absent Trump came under early attack. “I’m a maniac, and everyone on 
this stage is stupid, fat and ugly,” said Cruz. “And Ben, you’re a terrible 
surgeon. And now that we’ve got the Donald Trump portion out of the way ... ” 
 * For multiple candidates it was their peppiest outing yet. Former Florida 
governorJeb Bush was notably animated, accusing Rubio of having “cut and run” 
on immigration. Retired neurosurgeonBen Carson produced the memorable line: 
“Putin is a one-horse country: oil and energy.”

 * The crowd seemed against Cruz, booing him when he tried to wrest more time 
from the moderators. 
 * The candidates, especially New Jersey governor Chris Christie, attacked 
Clinton. Rubio said that “Hillary does not want to run against me, but I cannot 
wait to run against her.” 
 * Kentucky senator Rand Paul took a stand against government surveillance. 
“The bulk collection of your phone data ... did not stop one terrorist attack,” 
he said. 
 * A dutiful John Kasich explained how his experience as Ohio governor would 
help him deal with everything from the Flint, Michigan, water crisis to health 
care reform to the challenge of cyber warfare. 
That’s all from us tonight. Thanks for reading.
 
Perhaps the most shocking element of the “Donald J Trump Special Event to 
Benefit Veterans Organizations” wasits utter failure to shock.

In a vacuum, the idea of the party’s frontrunner ditching the final primary 
debate four days ahead of theIowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> 
caucuses is completely insane - a massive departure from the rules of political 
gravity. Had you told any political reporter six months ago that said 
frontrunner would then host a concurrent event three miles away, with the vague 
goal of raising money for unnamed veterans’ organizations, featuring 
appearances by the two lowest-ranked members of the field of candidates, you 
would’ve been laughed out of the room.

But - and someday we’ll get tired of saying this, we swear - Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is different. Just when you 
think he’s reached new heights (or new lows), Trump goes farther, harder, 
rougher, lower than you ever thought he would.

Which is why, counterintuitively, his “special event” didn’t seem all that 
special. Trump’s months-long feud with Fox News and Megyn Kelly built up 
expectations that no political rally could live up to. Even the appearance of 
viral YouTube stars, multiple presidential candidates, his famous daughter, a 
billionaire and his trophy wife, and an honest-to-goodness war hero failed to 
raise our pulse. Even Trump’s infamous crowds seemed subdued - as protesters 
interrupted the proceedings with chants of “we love veterans, Trump loves war”, 
it took Trump’s acolytes nearly a minute to muster the energy for chants of 
“Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!”

The billionaire frontrunner may be a victim of his own outlandishness. After 
calling for a 2,000-mile wall, a ban on Muslim immigrants and for the 
deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, what new policy could 
surprise us? After taunting a disabled reporter, chalking Kelly’s aggressive 
questioning up to menstruation and labeling John McCain a fake war hero, who 
else could he possibly insult? Short of calling for a preemptive nuclear strike 
on Iran or a sequel to the Mexican-American War, it’s hard to imagine what else 
Trump might be able to shock us with.

If his “special event” was any indication, the world’s greatest showman may 
finally be running out of tricks.

 
Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> dodges his ethanol 
subsidies challenge by asserting again that ethanol will take over the world 
just as soon as he can stop subsidies for oil. He says all subsidies should go 
- for ethanol and oil. It’s a curious argument. Corn would not be grown in Iowa 
without government subsidies. If you remove those subsidies, there won’t be any 
ethanol to compete with oil.

Cruz likes to say that Representative Steve King stands with him so he can’t 
be all bad on ethanol. The first half of that sentence is true: King is with 
Cruz. But whenever Cruz starts talking about ethanol subsidies, King looks like 
he’d rather be somewhere else. The smile disappears and he looks shiftily 
across theIowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> crowds.

 
Video – Donald Trump: Fox begged me to rejoin Republican debate
 
I’m fact-checking Ben Carson’s claim that “Putin is a one-horse country”. I 
don’t know about horse men but I can tell you that as a country, Russia has an 
abundance of horses.

In fact, Russia has one of the highest horse populations in the world 
according to data fromthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations <http://faostat.fao.org/site/573/default.aspx#ancor>. In 2012, Russia 
produced and/or slaughtered 279,882 horses (just behind the US’s 280,863). 
China tops the list by a long way though: 1,608,404 horses.

 
Paul: I’m an eye surgeon. I’m a senator. It’s amazing. I’m worried about the 
debt. I’m the one true fiscal conservative. [Big wild ridiculous college 
cheering]

Kasich: We look at each other and say why can’t we solve problems. Well I’ve 
got news. We can. We need to stay positive. Set the tune as conservatives but 
invite other people in to be part of that orchestra. Work together.

Christie: 9/11. My wife trapped in her building for 6 hours. Terrorism is 
scary. We need a president who knows what it means to face the possibility of 
loss. No one will keep this country safer than I will.

Bush: We need a conservative leader. I’ve a proven record. I have a plan. 
Restore the military. Keep us safe. Defeat Hillary Clinton. I ask for your 
support. I will make you proud.

Carson: Thanks Iowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>. Recites the 
preamble to the Constitution. Folks it’s not too late. Enough said.

Rubio: America’s light is shining on the world but Obama dimmed it. Caucus for 
me. America’s light will shine again.

Cruz: 93 hours. The media noise will soon be over. It’s time for Iowa to 
decide. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the Constitution and 
repeal Obamacare. Pray on it. Caucus for us.

Curtain. 
 
Vladimir Putin may be a one-horse country, in Ben Carson’s estimation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jan/28/fox-news-republican-debate-des-moines-iowa-donald-trump-megyn-kelly-live?page=with:block-56aae107e4b0ae753c39dcb0#block-56aae107e4b0ae753c39dcb0>
. But is he a one-man guy?
 
Final commercial break – prefatory to closing statements. One last chance to 
weigh in on who’s winning! Let us have it in the comments.
 
Ben Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> told the audience 
in Iowa that Putin is a one-horse country. It’s not clear what the former brain 
surgeon meant by that. But it is clear that Vladimir Putin sure does like 
horses.

In fact, the “interests” section <http://eng.putin.kremlin.ru/interests#top> 
of his personal website has a whole section devoted to horse riding. He enjoys 
hand-feeding horses as well as riding them around. Full, sweet, quote:

Vladimir Putin feels confident in the saddle so horseback riding for him is a 
chance to rest. On August 3, 2009 Putin took a one-day break and spent it in 
Tuva. At one of the stops he met with a local shepherd, who invited him to his 
home, and they went there on horseback.

During his working visit to the Republic of Khakassia, Putin travelled to the 
foothills of Karatash, near Abakan. There, he hand-fed local horses and drank a 
cup of tea, cooked over a campfire, and then went riding.

Obviously there is this, too:

Cruz is asked about the six-term governor of Iowa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>, Terry Branstad, opposing his 
candidacy, particularly over Cruz’s opposition to ethanol.

“I don’t believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers, and 
there should be no mandates, or no subsidies whatsoever,” Cruz says.


He says he does not oppose ethanol: He would phase out the ethanol mandate 
over five years but in the context of no mandates for anyone.

Cruz points out that Iowa Rep. Steve King, local boy made good, supports his 
candidacy.
 
Bush goes back to Trump. He says Trump’s call for a Muslim ban creates a toxic 
environment in the country. “It’s important for us to be careful about the 
language we use. Disparaging women. Disparaging Hispanics. That’s not a sign of 
strength. Making fun of disabled people?”
