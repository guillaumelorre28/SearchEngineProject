Junipero Serra sainted, pope speaks on climate change and celebrates response 
to abuse

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> didn’t take a 
break on his first day in the US. Here’s the day’s events:

 * The pope invoked Martin Luther king in a call for urgent action 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/pope-francis-climate-change-white-house-speech>
 on climate change.Speaking on the White House lawn with President Barack Obama 
before some 15,000 people, Francis told Obama he found it “encouraging that you 
are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution”. 
 * Five-year-old Sophie Cruz broke through security to deliver a message 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/pope-francis-sophie-cruz-letter-immigration>
 on immigration reform to the pope during his Washington DC parade. Cruz’s 
parents are undocumented migrants from Mexico. 
 * In his address to the US bishops, the pope commended 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/pope-francis-us-catholic-church-sex-abuse-scandal-bishops>
 them for “courage” shown over the child sexual abuse crisis.“Nor have you been 
afraid to divest whatever is unessential in order to regain the authority and 
trust which is demanded of ministers of Christ,” he added. 
 * Pope Francis canonized Junipero Serra, a Spanish missionary, the first 
canonization performed on US soil. Native American groups protested at the site 
of Serra’s burial, Carmel Mission. The mass of canonization was performed in 
Spanish at Washington DC’s Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate 
Conception. 
 * Protesters in favor of women’s ordination were arrested in Washington DC. 
Thanks very much for joining us on the Guardian’s PopeBlog. Tomorrow Pope 
Francis will address a joint session of Congress – it should be another busy 
day for the 78-year-old pontiff. See you then.

And another observation from papal biographer Austen Ivereigh, who has been 
the best commentator on Twitter during the tour:
Austen Ivereigh (@austeni) 
Pope places Rosary on statue of Virgin — and touches the statue. His sciatica 
looks bad. He needs prayers of San Junípero.

After communion, Cardinal Wuerl stands to address the pope. He calls the 
pastoral visit a “blessing for all of us”.

Wuerl reflects on the multicultural characteristics of the church and on 
Junipero Serra, who, he says, “offers us an example of the tireless effort to 
share the gospel, as we seek today to enrich our culture with the love of God 
and love of neighbor”.

“We also try to care for our common home, the good earth. All of us at this 
mass profess our faith and strive to live it in service and love. We take 
seriously your call in Laudato Si’ to face the challenges of our day ...”

An interesting note on translations from papal biographer Austen Ivereigh:
Austen Ivereigh (@austeni) 
A jarring note. Pope at Serra Mass using the Spanish 2nd pers plural forms 
(tomad .. bebed) rather than Latin-American (tomen.. beban).

This part of the mass will take a while – if you’re not into liturgy, now’s a 
good time to take the dog for a run around the block or something. Take your 
phone with you though, in case there’s more live updates.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> didn’t take a 
break on his first day in the US. Here’s the day’s events:

 * The pope invoked Martin Luther king in a call for urgent action 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/pope-francis-climate-change-white-house-speech>
 on climate change.Speaking on the White House lawn with President Barack Obama 
before some 15,000 people, Francis told Obama he found it “encouraging that you 
are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution”. 
 * Five-year-old Sophie Cruz broke through security to deliver a message 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/pope-francis-sophie-cruz-letter-immigration>
 on immigration reform to the pope during his Washington DC parade. Cruz’s 
parents are undocumented migrants from Mexico. 
 * In his address to the US bishops, the pope commended 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/pope-francis-us-catholic-church-sex-abuse-scandal-bishops>
 them for “courage” shown over the child sexual abuse crisis.“Nor have you been 
afraid to divest whatever is unessential in order to regain the authority and 
trust which is demanded of ministers of Christ,” he added. 
 * Pope Francis canonized Junipero Serra, a Spanish missionary, the first 
canonization performed on US soil. Native American groups protested at the site 
of Serra’s burial, Carmel Mission. The mass of canonization was performed in 
Spanish at Washington DC’s Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate 
Conception. 
 * Protesters in favor of women’s ordination were arrested in Washington DC. 
Thanks very much for joining us on the Guardian’s PopeBlog. Tomorrow Pope 
Francis will address a joint session of Congress – it should be another busy 
day for the 78-year-old pontiff. See you then.
 
And the mass has ended. The pope and his entourage depart.

And another observation from papal biographer Austen Ivereigh, who has been 
the best commentator on Twitter during the tour:
Austen Ivereigh (@austeni) 
Pope places Rosary on statue of Virgin — and touches the statue. His sciatica 
looks bad. He needs prayers of San Junípero.

Applause, shouts of Viva! and a standing ovation led by Vice-President Joe 
Biden.

After communion, Cardinal Wuerl stands to address the pope. He calls the 
pastoral visit a “blessing for all of us”.

Wuerl reflects on the multicultural characteristics of the church and on 
Junipero Serra, who, he says, “offers us an example of the tireless effort to 
share the gospel, as we seek today to enrich our culture with the love of God 
and love of neighbor”.

“We also try to care for our common home, the good earth. All of us at this 
mass profess our faith and strive to live it in service and love. We take 
seriously your call in Laudato Si’ to face the challenges of our day ...”
 
Holy communion is still being distributed. The mammoth congregation means it 
is taking a very long time.

An interesting note on translations from papal biographer Austen Ivereigh:
Austen Ivereigh (@austeni) 
A jarring note. Pope at Serra Mass using the Spanish 2nd pers plural forms 
(tomad .. bebed) rather than Latin-American (tomen.. beban).
