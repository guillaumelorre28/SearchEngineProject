Jericho was described by the judges as a brilliant myth buster for his 
forensic examinations of political and economic issues. A former public servant 
who wrote the celebrated blog Grogs Gamut, he has been writing for Guardian 
Australia since 2013.

The Gold Walkley was won by photojournalist Andrew Quilty, who has based 
himself in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, since 2013. In his speech he said when 
he worked for Fairfax before going freelance he always felt like a second-class 
citizen, and subordinate to the journalists, a role he realised was 
self-imposed.


He said he found it “deeply humbling” to be recognised not just for his 
photography but also his journalism. Quilty is the first photojournalist to win 
the award.

He paid tribute in his speech to the Guardian contributor Sune Engel 
Rasmussen, whosework on Afghanistan

 he illustrated this year.

Country. Giving part of his winning speech in the Wiradjuri language, Grant 
said: “I was raised on the stories of my mother, a bush poet who told tales of 
living on the margins”

 The Australian’s crime reporter Dan Box won two awards for his acclaimed

<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/23/australias-serial-dan-box-on-the-making-of-true-podcast-bowraville>
