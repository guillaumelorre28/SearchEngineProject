Seven has dropped its legal action in the federal court after Nine agreed to 
stop promoting Today as Australia’s No 1 breakfast show.


Seven had filed a misleading or deceptive conduct claim against Nine

 after Nine said its Today show had “triumphed in the 2016 ratings year to 
regain the crown as Australia’s favourite breakfast program”.


But last minute negotiations between the network lawyers on Thursday night led 
to the case being settled out of court.


“We are pleased Seven has seen fit to drop the case against the Today show,” 
Nine said in a statement on Friday morning. “We congratulate our Today show 
team on winning the most weeks across the five capital cities for 2016. We know 
they will power on for the rest of this year and into 2017.”

Sources told Guardian Australia that Nine agreed to drop all publicity, social 
media and on-air promotions that claimed Today was Australia’s No 1 breakfast 
program, the No 1 breakfast show in the country and Australia’s most watched 
breakfast program.


But that agreement didn’t stop Today co-host Lisa Wilkinson tweeting: “Channel 
7 drops its court case & now concedes Today Show has won the official OZTAM 
breakfast show ratings for 2016”. She then clarified her statement, saying 
Today cannot be beaten.

be beaten in 2016 b/fast weeks won across 5 cap cities.#OZTAM

The Nine news executive Mark Calvert reassured the Today crew that they were 
still No 1.


“You produce the greatest breakfast show on TV,” he said in an internal email 
on Thursday night. “No doubt.


“You’ve all seen the reports about our so-called rivals disputing our 
position. Tomorrow, they will spend money, and take up court time, arguing that 
we are ‘not number 1’.


“They are doing this because you have them rattled. They’re behaving like the 
narky kid who gets beaten in a kick-about on the oval ... so he takes his ball 
home. They’re Donald Trump, only accepting the result if he wins. They’re bad 
losers. They’ve forgotten that breakfast television is fun.


“And we’ll continue to celebrate, because as a wise man once said: “Winners 
have parties. Losers hire barristers.”

 The argument was over who had bragging rights to be the No 1 show after Nine 
claimed it had won the year because it won 21 of the 35 weeks of official 
ratings in the metropolitan ratings.

But Seven said Sunrise was still Australia’s No 1 breakfast show because it 
had the highest ratings across city and regional centres. Nine had used ratings 
from only the five mainland cities.


Seven news director Craig McPherson said: “We’re pleased Nine has now admitted 
Sunrise is Australia’s No 1 and most-watched breakfast show. The truth was 
always going to prevail over premature elation.”
