So we’ve just all witnessed something very, very special indeed. Hearty 
congratulations to Henrik Stenson, who shot a final-round 63 of such grace 
under pressure that it defies belief. And commiserations to Phil Mickelson: 
somebody had to lose, but he’s just played his part in one of golf’s greatest 
championships, a duel for the ages, and he’ll appreciate that once the sting 
subsides. Here’s how they ended up ...

-20: Stenson
-17: Mickelson
-6: Holmes
-5: Stricker
-4: McIlroy, Hatton, Garcia
-3: Beef
-2: D Johnson, Kjeldsen, Haas
-1: Southgate, Sullivan, Grillo, Woodland, Z Johnson, Reed

... here’s the final-day report ...

Henrik Stenson holds off Phil Mickelson for brilliant triumph at the Open

time. See you for the PGA at Baltusrol!

Henrik Stenson speaks: “Wow. This will take a little while to sink in. I’m 
still trying to find my bearings here. I want to thank Phil for a fantastic 
battle. We played some great golf. I’m delighted to come out on top, but thank 
you very much! I lost a dear friend to cancer earlier this week, and I feel 
he’s been with me all week. Mike, this one is for you.” He kisses the trophy, 
exchanging emotional glances with his wife. That’s a sweet moment. Stenson 
looks - and sounds - stunned, quite frankly. Punch drunk, perhaps, after a 
scrap for the ages. He deserves to taste a few restorative drops of something 
nice from that famous old Claret Jug tonight! Phil might need something quite 
strong too.

While the R&A faff about with their pre-presentation chit-chat, a little admin.
 JB Holmes and Steve Stricker parred the last, so the former ends up in third 
ahead of the latter. Meanwhile Beef ended down at -3, while Bill Haas finally 
has his top-ten finish in a major, finishing joint ninth at -2. But never mind 
that, for the R&A are ready now. Here comes the gold medal winner and the 
champion golfer of the year: Henrik Stenson!

There’s no question about it. We’ve just witnessed one of the greatest Open 
Championship battles of all time. Maybe the best? Better than the famous Duel 
in the Sun at Turnberry? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Maybe we shouldn’t care. On its 
own terms, that was one of the greatest sporting scraps you’re ever likely to 
see. WhatPhil Mickelson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson> did 
there in defeat was extraordinary: a 65, four birdies and an eagle. But what 
Henrik Stenson achieved was out of this world: ten birdies - ten birdies! - and 
two bogeys on his way to a record-equalling 63. Under all that pressure! What a 
pair of heroes. Though only one can claim the prize. Stenson, the deserving 
victor, will lift the famous Claret Jug in a minute.

HENRIK STENSON IS THE 2016 OPEN CHAMPION! He sends a 20-foot right-to-left 
slider towards the hole. In keeping with the drama of the day, the ball stops 
on the edge of the cup, thinks about staying out, then drops in. A birdie, and 
by the end of this historic tussle, he’s shot a major-record-equalling 63! He 
punches the air and wanders around for a second, not sure what to do. Then he 
embraces Mickelson, who for a minute looks utterly drained of emotion. A 
thousand-yard stare. Stenson places a caring, sympathetic hand on his shoulder 
and leaves him to his thoughts. But a few seconds later, a rejuvenated 
Mickelson’s coming back at his victor. He places the warmest of congratulatory 
arms around him, and the pair wander off the green wearing wide smiles. 
Unavoidable echoes of Watson and Nicklaus all those years ago!

Spare a thought for poor Phil Mickelson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson>. One of the greatest players 
in the world has done next to nothing wrong. He lags up his long putt to 18 
inches, and taps in for par. He’s just shot 65 on the final day of a major 
championship, and isn’t going to win. That’s heartbreaking for him. But when 
the disappointment fades, he’ll be so very, very proud of his contribution to 
one of golf’s greatest ever days!

Mickelson tells his caddy that he’d rather go for it and fail, rather than 
play safe and die wondering. He fires a long iron straight at the flag, but not 
for the first time today, comes up short. It’s on the green, but he’s left with 
a long putt. Stenson then whips his iron into the heart of the dancefloor. It’s 
surely over! He’s two putts away from prevailing in the greatest Open scrap 
since Watson and Nicklaus went at it down the coast in 1977! And the crowd 
react accordingly as the two battered but brave heroes make their way up the 
last. This really is something else. Stenson looks stony faced, but only 
because he’s clearly battling to keep his emotions in check. He’s very close to 
winning one of the greatest Opens ever!

If Stenson is nervous, he doesn’t betray it as he lashes his iron straight 
down the 18th fairway. A wonderful shot. Unruffled. But like Greg Norman in the 
play-off back in 1989, adrenalin, plus a hard bounce, sends his ball towards 
the bunker down the right! Unlike Norman, the ball stops one step short of 
dropping in! Stenson’s heart was in his mouth there. That’s nearly 330 yards 
away! Eh? Mickelson meanwhile finds the middle of the fairway. Stenson’s tee 
shot, though. Dearie me!

And Stenson’s birdie effort looks like dropping, but just like Mickelson’s 
eagle effort on the last, fades a microsecond before it’s supposed to disappear 
from view! It slides to the left, and he can only par too. He’s still got a 
two-shot lead going up the last, but it looked done and dusted a couple of 
putts ago. Now there’s still a glimmer of hope for Mickelson, albeit a very 
distant one. Stenson will be understandably nervous, having surely thought he’d 
done everything required.

-19: Stenson (17)

Mickelson bumps his chip up towards the green, but the bank takes the sting 
out of his shot.The ball only just makes it onto the putting surface, and he’s 
left with a 15-footer for par. He takes hold of his putter to do business, in 
the hope of salvaging something from this situation, but the look in his eye 
betrays his true feelings: this could be over very soon. But he rolls in the 
par saver. He’s going to make Stenson work for this!

The 17th tee, and the shot of Stenson’s life. If he gets this close, he’ll 
surely close out this Championship! And that’s exactly what he does! A 220-yard 
iron guided by laser towards the flag! He’s seven feet from the flag! And it 
could be the blow that knocks out Mickelson. He sends his tee shot down the 
bank to the left. If ever he needs a miracle chip, it’s here. Thing is, he’s 
done little wrong. Stenson has been simply relentless, all day. All week. He’ll 
be a richly deserved champion if he can close this out!

Yes he can! It’s rolled with resolve into the centre of the cup! Three birdies 
in a row for Henrik Stenson, and he’s made his move to win this Open 
Championship! Meanwhile over on 17, Stricker fluffs a chip from the side of the 
green, that’s a double bogey, and third place belongs to his partner JB Holmes 
again!

And he so nearly makes it! It’s trundling in, up the green from right to left, 
but somehow dies to the left at the very last and balances on the lip. Just 
like the putt for his 62: how on earth did that stay out, inexplicably going 
sideways when it was surely destined to drop?! But that’s a birdie that’ll move 
him to -17. He’s back to within a shot of Stenson. Can the big man restore his 
two-shot lead by making this pressure four footer?

Stenson’s got a very wispy lie. He’s got to be very careful not to move his 
ball. He doesn’t have to negotiate the bunker, though, which makes things a lot 
easier. And showcasing nerves made of steel, and supported by steel, he clips a 
chip onto the fringe and sends his ball scampering up to four feet! That looked 
almost impossible from where he was! The pressure’s back on Mickelson, who 
might now feel the need to make his eagle putt!

This isn’t over yet! Mickelson fires an arrow-straight iron onto the front of 
16. He’s giving nothing up. Stenson pulls out his 3-wood, looking to guide one 
in left to right. He sets it out there, but it isn’t coming back, and lands in 
some thick rough to the side of the green. That’ll be a poser. Wow. Mickelson 
applied the pressure with that stunning second, and Stenson buckled a little 
there, playing second in conditions not totally unlike classic matchplay. Did I 
say wow? Wow. This is an Open battle for the ages.

Stenson and Mickelson clip irons down the par-five 16th from the tee box. Up 
on 18, Sergio nearly rolls a Stensonesque biggie across the green for a 
valedictory birdie, but it’s a par, a 69, and a share of the clubhouse lead at 
-4 with McIlroy and Hatton. Holmes meanwhile took two putts for birdie on 16, 
but he’s still a shot shy of third place, because Stricker picked up a stroke 
on the hole too and moves to -7.

Stenson moves two shots clear!

Stenson drains a monster from the fringe on the right of 15! It’s one of those 
that’s always heading in, on an inexorable 50-feet journey. Up a small bank, 
oscillating along a line on the right lip, and perfectly paced, the last drop 
of energy toppling the ball into the cup! He allows himself a little fist pump, 
because he knows that could be the moment that won the Open! Mickelson bravely 
gives his birdie effort a good rattle, but it stays out on the right and 
suddenly the Swede has a two-shot gap!

Keegan Bradley and Charl Schwartzel, who both harboured hopes at the halfway 
stage, end the week with a pair of 73s. They’re level par for their tournament. 
That’s something for the previously out-of-form Bradley to build on; and 
Schwartzel will have enjoyed playing with his new clubs for the most part. But 
never mind that, because back on 15...

Stenson’s second into 15 topples off the side of the green, front right. 
That’s a fair distance from the flag, out on the other side. The door slightly 
ajar for Mickelson, then: from 200 yards, he arrows his iron straight at the 
flag, but it’s 25 feet short. But he’s got a small advantage here. Meanwhile up 
on 16, Holmes looks to repair the damage caused on 15 by pearling a fairway 
wood into the heart of the par-five green. He’ll have a look at eagle, pin 
high, 20 feet away.

Stenson has the honour now, and bombs a 3-wood down the track at 15. Mickelson 
follows him down there with the big stick. It’s impossible to take your eyes 
off this, it’s an Open duel for the ages. Meanwhile JB Holmes ends up with a 
double-bogey six at 15, which drops him down to -5. His playing partner Steve 
Stricker, with his 12th par of the day, is now third at -6. “After what 
happened on Thursday, it would be pretty hard for Phil to take if he lost by a 
shot,” suggests Simon McMahon, referring to the moment Lefty came the width of 
a dimple away from an epochal 62. Not sure how his tee shot at the Postage 
Stamp stayed out on Friday, either. But this is the way of golf, and this is 
where we are.

Mickelson’s birdie attempt never looks like going in, but does end up next to 
the hole, and he taps in for his par.Stenson then has a fairly straight putt to 
take the lead at a crucial moment. It’s a very gentle right-to-left slider, and 
he judges it to perfection! The Swede hits the front four holes from home. Four 
holes to his maiden major!

-17: Stenson (14)
-16: Mickelson (14)

Our heroes reach the par-three 14th. Mickelson fades it in, pin high, 25 feet 
to the right. Stenson, by the look in his eyes, worries that he’s hit his tee 
shot off the back left, but it stops safely enough, and in fact isn’t too bad 
at all, 15 feet behind the pin. Maybe a little closer. Meanwhile up on 15, it’s 
beginning to go badly wrong for poor JB Holmes. In third place. he wings his 
drive out of bounds on the right, then slices his fourth shot into deep trouble 
down the same side. Not sure if that’s O/B too, but it’s close. Either way, his 
tournament is in danger of falling apart here.

Stenson lags a 30-footer up to 18 inches or so, a fine feel with nerves 
jangling like a mid-80s cutie band. Par. Mickelson then very nearly steers his 
gentle left-to-right slider into the cup from 20 feet, but it somehow stays out 
on the left, and they’re still neck and neck at -16. This is something else. Up 
on 16, a birdie for Sergio that takes him into the pack at -4. “Really hoping 
these two keep it up to the final hole,” says Stephen Cooper. “It would be a 
distinct anticlimax if one of them has a disaster before we get there. I’d not 
say no to a play-off!”

-16: Mickelson (13), Stenson (13)

Mickelson and Stenson are falling behind the pace a little, which is surely 
understandable in the circumstances.It’s all about this final group. They 
haven’t been put on the clock, but the referee has had a little word. All a bit 
unnecessary. But compared to the utter balls the USGA made of both the men’s 
and women’s US Opens, it’s not much to worry about. The pair blooter drivers 
down 13 - a rare sighting of Stenson’s big Bertha - and subsequently find the 
green in regulation. Stenson’s approach has leaked off to the right a little, 
though, and he’ll have the longer putt. Meanwhile up on 18, Tyrrell Hatton - a 
top 25 finish at last year’s PGA and a second place in the Scottish Open last 
week - is a couple of rolls away from a birdie. But par will do. That’s a 68, 
and he’s tied for the clubhouse lead right now with four-time major-winning 
Rory McIlroy at -4. He’s one for the future all right.

Stenson is putting first. Once again he doesn’t hit the birdie putt. Just the 
par. And he’s given Mickelson a read. Having gone to school on Stenson’s putt, 
the 2013 champion and five-time major winner rolls his gentle left-to-right 
saver into the cup, and that’s acomplete steal. He was all over the shop! 
Stenson was as calm as you like, but both of them walk off with pars. That’s 
golf! Elsewhere, Beef has bogeyed 10 and 12 to drift to -4, Stricker has rolled 
a 25-footer across 14 for his third birdie of the day - no dropped shots yet - 
and he’s -6. And the US Open champion Dustin Johnson signs for a final round of 
70: he ends the tournament in decent shape at -2.

-16: Mickelson (12), Stenson (12)
-7: Holmes (14)
-6: Stricker (14)
-4: McIlroy (F), Hatton (17), Beef (13)

Mickelson’s got a better lie than he possibly deserves. Not that he’s in a 
good spot: while his rival’s comfortably on the green, he’s got the best part 
of 70 yards to the flag, playing blind over the hillock. He whips his ball into 
the middle of the green in the easy style. Still 15 feet from the hole, but 
with a chance of saving an unlikely par. Meanwhile up on 17, Hatton pings his 
tee shot straight at the flag, eight feet short, but he pulls the very makeable 
birdie putt. He stays at -4.

Could the momentum be shifting again? Mickelson sends his tee shot into the 
filth down the left of 12, then lets the grass grip the hosel and turn his club 
to send the second shot onto anextremely grassy knoll to the right. Stenson 
meanwhile hits two calm irons down the middle to find the green in regulation. 
Meanwhile away from the drama, the defending champion Zach Johnson signs his 
name to a final-day 71. A very fine defence of his title; even if he ended up 
falling way short, at -1, he was in contention for much of this week. He’s a 
brilliant links player. And he’ll always have St Andrews.

Beef misses a four-footer for par on 12. He’s three over through the last five 
holes, back at -4, and could do with a momentum shifter. His compatriot Tyrrell 
Hatton is heading the other way: that birdie at 12 has now been followed by 
another at 16, a long rake across the par five, and he’s -4 too, albeit with a 
much more cheery demeanour right now. Steve Stricker continues to go well: 
three pars since the turn, and he’s -5 overall through 12. And Bill Haas’s 
journey south continues: bogeys at 5, 6, 8 and now 11, and he’s slipped all the 
way to -2.

Stenson doesn’t give his long birdie putt any sort of clack at all. It’s 
always going to end up short, and stops four feet shy of the cup. That’ll be a 
jittery one for his par. Mickelson opts to putt up from the bottom of the bank, 
and a misread sends the ball a couple of feet to the right of the hole. He’s 
close enough to have the option to finish up, and with his matchplay hat on, 
grabs the opportunity with both hands. He makes his par, and there’s suddenly a 
little pressure on this Stenson putt. He doesn’t quite hit it, a timid prod 
slipping a little bit to the left. It thinks about dropping in, but horseshoes 
out instead. Two very shaky putts from Stenson, who has yet to win a major and 
might soon start thinking about that very fact. We’re all square again, as 
these heroes trade blow after blow!

-16: Mickelson (11), Stenson (11)
-7: Holmes (12)

Stenson thinks long and hard about his second shot, hampered slightly by 
overhanging gorse bushes ahead. That’s more a sightline problem than anything 
else. He fires his iron straight at the green, though it only gets on the 
front. He’ll have a long birdie putt from 35 feet. Mickelson lands his second 
right by the flag, but it bounces on and topples down the back of the green. 
That’s extremely unfortunate. It should be an easy enough up and down, but 
there goes a birdie chance. Though rule nothing out, the way this round has 
been going. Meanwhile Sergio sends his second through the green at 13, and 
can’t scramble his par. His second bogey on the back nine, after dropping one 
at 10, and he’s slipping backwards at -2.

Stenson finds the semi-rough to the left of the fairway. That’ll be fine. 
Mickelson whistles his straight down the middle. The hardest shot of the round, 
gone, without disaster. Up ahead, Holmes gets up and down from the front of the 
12th green to scramble a fine par: he stays at -7, in third place, just the 
nine strokes off second place.

My mistake, turns out Mickelson was a step inside Stenson. The Swede takes 
advantage by arrowing his putt straight into the back of the hole, his sixth 
birdie today! He’s now two ahead at the top, so Mickelson really, really,really 
needs to make his birdie putt. And in it goes! This is amazing golf, one of the 
rounds of the ages. So far, the pair have delivered nine birdies and one eagle 
between them in ten holes. Nine birdies! One eagle! Ten holes! This is
preposterous. Railway hole next, mind. That could put the cat among the pigeons.

-17: Stenson (10)
-16: Mickelson (10)

Mickelson and Stenson make their way to the 10th tee, where the business end 
of the tournament begins.Mickelson hands his ball to a lad no more than six 
years old; the lad’s smile, all disbelieving excitement, could power Ayrshire 
for a few months. What a folk hero Lefty is. It’s the small things. He sends 
his tee shot into the semi-rough, but no matter - he fires his second straight 
at the flag! It’s 12 feet behind the hole. What a shot from that position! At 
which point Stenson begins to look a bit twitchy, coming out of the shot a 
couple of times when the breeze changes direction, before finally committing - 
and landing his ball a couple of fee inside Mickelson’s! This round is turning 
pugilistic, it’s a remarkable exchange of high-quality haymakers. What glorious 
nonsense!

So we’ve just all witnessed something very, very special indeed. Hearty 
congratulations to Henrik Stenson, who shot a final-round 63 of such grace 
under pressure that it defies belief. And commiserations to Phil Mickelson: 
somebody had to lose, but he’s just played his part in one of golf’s greatest 
championships, a duel for the ages, and he’ll appreciate that once the sting 
subsides. Here’s how they ended up ...

-20: Stenson
-17: Mickelson
-6: Holmes
-5: Stricker
-4: McIlroy, Hatton, Garcia
-3: Beef
-2: D Johnson, Kjeldsen, Haas
-1: Southgate, Sullivan, Grillo, Woodland, Z Johnson, Reed

... here’s the final-day report ...

Henrik Stenson holds off Phil Mickelson for brilliant triumph at the Open

... and hopefully you’ll be in the mood to do it all again in a fortnight’s 
time. See you for the PGA at Baltusrol!

Henrik Stenson speaks: “Wow. This will take a little while to sink in. I’m 
still trying to find my bearings here. I want to thank Phil for a fantastic 
battle. We played some great golf. I’m delighted to come out on top, but thank 
you very much! I lost a dear friend to cancer earlier this week, and I feel 
he’s been with me all week. Mike, this one is for you.” He kisses the trophy, 
exchanging emotional glances with his wife. That’s a sweet moment. Stenson 
looks - and sounds - stunned, quite frankly. Punch drunk, perhaps, after a 
scrap for the ages. He deserves to taste a few restorative drops of something 
nice from that famous old Claret Jug tonight! Phil might need something quite 
strong too.
 
While the R&A faff about with their pre-presentation chit-chat, a little admin.
 JB Holmes and Steve Stricker parred the last, so the former ends up in third 
ahead of the latter. Meanwhile Beef ended down at -3, while Bill Haas finally 
has his top-ten finish in a major, finishing joint ninth at -2. But never mind 
that, for the R&A are ready now. Here comes the gold medal winner and the 
champion golfer of the year: Henrik Stenson!
 
There’s no question about it. We’ve just witnessed one of the greatest Open 
Championship battles of all time. Maybe the best? Better than the famous Duel 
in the Sun at Turnberry? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Maybe we shouldn’t care. On its 
own terms, that was one of the greatest sporting scraps you’re ever likely to 
see. WhatPhil Mickelson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson> did 
there in defeat was extraordinary: a 65, four birdies and an eagle. But what 
Henrik Stenson achieved was out of this world: ten birdies - ten birdies! - and 
two bogeys on his way to a record-equalling 63. Under all that pressure! What a 
pair of heroes. Though only one can claim the prize. Stenson, the deserving 
victor, will lift the famous Claret Jug in a minute.
 
Golf, eh? Bloody hell.
 
HENRIK STENSON IS THE 2016 OPEN CHAMPION! He sends a 20-foot right-to-left 
slider towards the hole. In keeping with the drama of the day, the ball stops 
on the edge of the cup, thinks about staying out, then drops in. A birdie, and 
by the end of this historic tussle, he’s shot a major-record-equalling 63! He 
punches the air and wanders around for a second, not sure what to do. Then he 
embraces Mickelson, who for a minute looks utterly drained of emotion. A 
thousand-yard stare. Stenson places a caring, sympathetic hand on his shoulder 
and leaves him to his thoughts. But a few seconds later, a rejuvenated 
Mickelson’s coming back at his victor. He places the warmest of congratulatory 
arms around him, and the pair wander off the green wearing wide smiles. 
Unavoidable echoes of Watson and Nicklaus all those years ago!

Spare a thought for poor Phil Mickelson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson>. One of the greatest players 
in the world has done next to nothing wrong. He lags up his long putt to 18 
inches, and taps in for par. He’s just shot 65 on the final day of a major 
championship, and isn’t going to win. That’s heartbreaking for him. But when 
the disappointment fades, he’ll be so very, very proud of his contribution to 
one of golf’s greatest ever days!
 
Mickelson tells his caddy that he’d rather go for it and fail, rather than 
play safe and die wondering. He fires a long iron straight at the flag, but not 
for the first time today, comes up short. It’s on the green, but he’s left with 
a long putt. Stenson then whips his iron into the heart of the dancefloor. It’s 
surely over! He’s two putts away from prevailing in the greatest Open scrap 
since Watson and Nicklaus went at it down the coast in 1977! And the crowd 
react accordingly as the two battered but brave heroes make their way up the 
last. This really is something else. Stenson looks stony faced, but only 
because he’s clearly battling to keep his emotions in check. He’s very close to 
winning one of the greatest Opens ever!
 
If Stenson is nervous, he doesn’t betray it as he lashes his iron straight 
down the 18th fairway. A wonderful shot. Unruffled. But like Greg Norman in the 
play-off back in 1989, adrenalin, plus a hard bounce, sends his ball towards 
the bunker down the right! Unlike Norman, the ball stops one step short of 
dropping in! Stenson’s heart was in his mouth there. That’s nearly 330 yards 
away! Eh? Mickelson meanwhile finds the middle of the fairway. Stenson’s tee 
shot, though. Dearie me!
 
And Stenson’s birdie effort looks like dropping, but just like Mickelson’s 
eagle effort on the last, fades a microsecond before it’s supposed to disappear 
from view! It slides to the left, and he can only par too. He’s still got a 
two-shot lead going up the last, but it looked done and dusted a couple of 
putts ago. Now there’s still a glimmer of hope for Mickelson, albeit a very 
distant one. Stenson will be understandably nervous, having surely thought he’d 
done everything required.

-19: Stenson (17)
-17: Mickelson (17)
 
Mickelson bumps his chip up towards the green, but the bank takes the sting 
out of his shot.The ball only just makes it onto the putting surface, and he’s 
left with a 15-footer for par. He takes hold of his putter to do business, in 
the hope of salvaging something from this situation, but the look in his eye 
betrays his true feelings: this could be over very soon. But he rolls in the 
par saver. He’s going to make Stenson work for this!
 
The 17th tee, and the shot of Stenson’s life. If he gets this close, he’ll 
surely close out this Championship! And that’s exactly what he does! A 220-yard 
iron guided by laser towards the flag! He’s seven feet from the flag! And it 
could be the blow that knocks out Mickelson. He sends his tee shot down the 
bank to the left. If ever he needs a miracle chip, it’s here. Thing is, he’s 
done little wrong. Stenson has been simply relentless, all day. All week. He’ll 
be a richly deserved champion if he can close this out!
 
Yes he can! It’s rolled with resolve into the centre of the cup! Three birdies 
in a row for Henrik Stenson, and he’s made his move to win this Open 
Championship! Meanwhile over on 17, Stricker fluffs a chip from the side of the 
green, that’s a double bogey, and third place belongs to his partner JB Holmes 
again!

-19: Stenson (16)
-17: Mickelson (16)
-6: Holmes (17)
-5: Stricker (17)
 
And he so nearly makes it! It’s trundling in, up the green from right to left, 
but somehow dies to the left at the very last and balances on the lip. Just 
like the putt for his 62: how on earth did that stay out, inexplicably going 
sideways when it was surely destined to drop?! But that’s a birdie that’ll move 
him to -17. He’s back to within a shot of Stenson. Can the big man restore his 
two-shot lead by making this pressure four footer?

Stenson’s got a very wispy lie. He’s got to be very careful not to move his 
ball. He doesn’t have to negotiate the bunker, though, which makes things a lot 
easier. And showcasing nerves made of steel, and supported by steel, he clips a 
chip onto the fringe and sends his ball scampering up to four feet! That looked 
almost impossible from where he was! The pressure’s back on Mickelson, who 
might now feel the need to make his eagle putt!
 
This isn’t over yet! Mickelson fires an arrow-straight iron onto the front of 
16. He’s giving nothing up. Stenson pulls out his 3-wood, looking to guide one 
in left to right. He sets it out there, but it isn’t coming back, and lands in 
some thick rough to the side of the green. That’ll be a poser. Wow. Mickelson 
applied the pressure with that stunning second, and Stenson buckled a little 
there, playing second in conditions not totally unlike classic matchplay. Did I 
say wow? Wow. This is an Open battle for the ages.
 
Stenson and Mickelson clip irons down the par-five 16th from the tee box. Up 
on 18, Sergio nearly rolls a Stensonesque biggie across the green for a 
valedictory birdie, but it’s a par, a 69, and a share of the clubhouse lead at 
-4 with McIlroy and Hatton. Holmes meanwhile took two putts for birdie on 16, 
but he’s still a shot shy of third place, because Stricker picked up a stroke 
on the hole too and moves to -7.
 
Stenson drains a monster from the fringe on the right of 15! It’s one of those 
that’s always heading in, on an inexorable 50-feet journey. Up a small bank, 
oscillating along a line on the right lip, and perfectly paced, the last drop 
of energy toppling the ball into the cup! He allows himself a little fist pump, 
because he knows that could be the moment that won the Open! Mickelson bravely 
gives his birdie effort a good rattle, but it stays out on the right and 
suddenly the Swede has a two-shot gap!

Keegan Bradley and Charl Schwartzel, who both harboured hopes at the halfway 
stage, end the week with a pair of 73s. They’re level par for their tournament. 
That’s something for the previously out-of-form Bradley to build on; and 
Schwartzel will have enjoyed playing with his new clubs for the most part. But 
never mind that, because back on 15...
 
Stenson’s second into 15 topples off the side of the green, front right. 
That’s a fair distance from the flag, out on the other side. The door slightly 
ajar for Mickelson, then: from 200 yards, he arrows his iron straight at the 
flag, but it’s 25 feet short. But he’s got a small advantage here. Meanwhile up 
on 16, Holmes looks to repair the damage caused on 15 by pearling a fairway 
wood into the heart of the par-five green. He’ll have a look at eagle, pin 
high, 20 feet away.

 
Stenson has the honour now, and bombs a 3-wood down the track at 15. Mickelson 
follows him down there with the big stick. It’s impossible to take your eyes 
off this, it’s an Open duel for the ages. Meanwhile JB Holmes ends up with a 
double-bogey six at 15, which drops him down to -5. His playing partner Steve 
Stricker, with his 12th par of the day, is now third at -6. “After what 
happened on Thursday, it would be pretty hard for Phil to take if he lost by a 
shot,” suggests Simon McMahon, referring to the moment Lefty came the width of 
a dimple away from an epochal 62. Not sure how his tee shot at the Postage 
Stamp stayed out on Friday, either. But this is the way of golf, and this is 
where we are.
 
Mickelson’s birdie attempt never looks like going in, but does end up next to 
the hole, and he taps in for his par.Stenson then has a fairly straight putt to 
take the lead at a crucial moment. It’s a very gentle right-to-left slider, and 
he judges it to perfection! The Swede hits the front four holes from home. Four 
holes to his maiden major!

-17: Stenson (14)
-16: Mickelson (14)
 
Our heroes reach the par-three 14th. Mickelson fades it in, pin high, 25 feet 
to the right. Stenson, by the look in his eyes, worries that he’s hit his tee 
shot off the back left, but it stops safely enough, and in fact isn’t too bad 
at all, 15 feet behind the pin. Maybe a little closer. Meanwhile up on 15, it’s 
beginning to go badly wrong for poor JB Holmes. In third place. he wings his 
drive out of bounds on the right, then slices his fourth shot into deep trouble 
down the same side. Not sure if that’s O/B too, but it’s close. Either way, his 
tournament is in danger of falling apart here.
 
Stenson lags a 30-footer up to 18 inches or so, a fine feel with nerves 
jangling like a mid-80s cutie band. Par. Mickelson then very nearly steers his 
gentle left-to-right slider into the cup from 20 feet, but it somehow stays out 
on the left, and they’re still neck and neck at -16. This is something else. Up 
on 16, a birdie for Sergio that takes him into the pack at -4. “Really hoping 
these two keep it up to the final hole,” says Stephen Cooper. “It would be a 
distinct anticlimax if one of them has a disaster before we get there. I’d not 
say no to a play-off!”

-16: Mickelson (13), Stenson (13)
-7: Holmes (14)
-6: Stricker (14)
-4: McIlroy (F), Hatton (F), Garcia (16), Beef (14)
 
Mickelson and Stenson are falling behind the pace a little, which is surely 
understandable in the circumstances.It’s all about this final group. They 
haven’t been put on the clock, but the referee has had a little word. All a bit 
unnecessary. But compared to the utter balls the USGA made of both the men’s 
and women’s US Opens, it’s not much to worry about. The pair blooter drivers 
down 13 - a rare sighting of Stenson’s big Bertha - and subsequently find the 
green in regulation. Stenson’s approach has leaked off to the right a little, 
though, and he’ll have the longer putt. Meanwhile up on 18, Tyrrell Hatton - a 
top 25 finish at last year’s PGA and a second place in the Scottish Open last 
week - is a couple of rolls away from a birdie. But par will do. That’s a 68, 
and he’s tied for the clubhouse lead right now with four-time major-winning 
Rory McIlroy at -4. He’s one for the future all right.
 
Stenson is putting first. Once again he doesn’t hit the birdie putt. Just the 
par. And he’s given Mickelson a read. Having gone to school on Stenson’s putt, 
the 2013 champion and five-time major winner rolls his gentle left-to-right 
saver into the cup, and that’s acomplete steal. He was all over the shop! 
Stenson was as calm as you like, but both of them walk off with pars. That’s 
golf! Elsewhere, Beef has bogeyed 10 and 12 to drift to -4, Stricker has rolled 
a 25-footer across 14 for his third birdie of the day - no dropped shots yet - 
and he’s -6. And the US Open champion Dustin Johnson signs for a final round of 
70: he ends the tournament in decent shape at -2.

Mickelson’s got a better lie than he possibly deserves. Not that he’s in a 
good spot: while his rival’s comfortably on the green, he’s got the best part 
of 70 yards to the flag, playing blind over the hillock. He whips his ball into 
the middle of the green in the easy style. Still 15 feet from the hole, but 
with a chance of saving an unlikely par. Meanwhile up on 17, Hatton pings his 
tee shot straight at the flag, eight feet short, but he pulls the very makeable 
birdie putt. He stays at -4.

Could the momentum be shifting again? Mickelson sends his tee shot into the 
filth down the left of 12, then lets the grass grip the hosel and turn his club 
to send the second shot onto anextremely grassy knoll to the right. Stenson 
meanwhile hits two calm irons down the middle to find the green in regulation. 
Meanwhile away from the drama, the defending champion Zach Johnson signs his 
name to a final-day 71. A very fine defence of his title; even if he ended up 
falling way short, at -1, he was in contention for much of this week. He’s a 
brilliant links player. And he’ll always have St Andrews.
 
Beef misses a four-footer for par on 12. He’s three over through the last five 
holes, back at -4, and could do with a momentum shifter. His compatriot Tyrrell 
Hatton is heading the other way: that birdie at 12 has now been followed by 
another at 16, a long rake across the par five, and he’s -4 too, albeit with a 
much more cheery demeanour right now. Steve Stricker continues to go well: 
three pars since the turn, and he’s -5 overall through 12. And Bill Haas’s 
journey south continues: bogeys at 5, 6, 8 and now 11, and he’s slipped all the 
way to -2.
 
Stenson doesn’t give his long birdie putt any sort of clack at all. It’s 
always going to end up short, and stops four feet shy of the cup. That’ll be a 
jittery one for his par. Mickelson opts to putt up from the bottom of the bank, 
and a misread sends the ball a couple of feet to the right of the hole. He’s 
close enough to have the option to finish up, and with his matchplay hat on, 
grabs the opportunity with both hands. He makes his par, and there’s suddenly a 
little pressure on this Stenson putt. He doesn’t quite hit it, a timid prod 
slipping a little bit to the left. It thinks about dropping in, but horseshoes 
out instead. Two very shaky putts from Stenson, who has yet to win a major and 
might soon start thinking about that very fact. We’re all square again, as 
these heroes trade blow after blow!

Stenson thinks long and hard about his second shot, hampered slightly by 
overhanging gorse bushes ahead. That’s more a sightline problem than anything 
else. He fires his iron straight at the green, though it only gets on the 
front. He’ll have a long birdie putt from 35 feet. Mickelson lands his second 
right by the flag, but it bounces on and topples down the back of the green. 
That’s extremely unfortunate. It should be an easy enough up and down, but 
there goes a birdie chance. Though rule nothing out, the way this round has 
been going. Meanwhile Sergio sends his second through the green at 13, and 
can’t scramble his par. His second bogey on the back nine, after dropping one 
at 10, and he’s slipping backwards at -2.
 
Stenson finds the semi-rough to the left of the fairway. That’ll be fine. 
Mickelson whistles his straight down the middle. The hardest shot of the round, 
gone, without disaster. Up ahead, Holmes gets up and down from the front of the 
12th green to scramble a fine par: he stays at -7, in third place, just the 
nine strokes off second place.

My mistake, turns out Mickelson was a step inside Stenson. The Swede takes 
advantage by arrowing his putt straight into the back of the hole, his sixth 
birdie today! He’s now two ahead at the top, so Mickelson really, really,really 
needs to make his birdie putt. And in it goes! This is amazing golf, one of the 
rounds of the ages. So far, the pair have delivered nine birdies and one eagle 
between them in ten holes. Nine birdies! One eagle! Ten holes! This is
preposterous. Railway hole next, mind. That could put the cat among the pigeons.

Mickelson and Stenson make their way to the 10th tee, where the business end 
of the tournament begins.Mickelson hands his ball to a lad no more than six 
years old; the lad’s smile, all disbelieving excitement, could power Ayrshire 
for a few months. What a folk hero Lefty is. It’s the small things. He sends 
his tee shot into the semi-rough, but no matter - he fires his second straight 
at the flag! It’s 12 feet behind the hole. What a shot from that position! At 
which point Stenson begins to look a bit twitchy, coming out of the shot a 
couple of times when the breeze changes direction, before finally committing - 
and landing his ball a couple of fee inside Mickelson’s! This round is turning 
pugilistic, it’s a remarkable exchange of high-quality haymakers. What glorious 
nonsense!
