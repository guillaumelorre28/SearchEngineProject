Suicide Squad <https://www.theguardian.com/film/suicide-squad>, David Ayer’s 
take on the DC Comics antiheroes, experienced a 67% drop in box office during 
its second week of release, following poor reviews.

The failure to sustain business past its opening weekend mirrors that of 
Warner Brothers’ last superhero film:Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2> – which was also mauled by 
critics – saw a 69% drop in business in its second week.

Ayer’s film nevertheless remains at the top of the US chart thanks to a 
$222.9m (£172.6m) take to date. Second place goes to a new entry:Sausage Party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/10/sausage-party-review-seth-rogen>, 
the R-rated animated comedy about foodstuffs facing their use-by date, which 
got off to a sizzling start with $33.6m. The film stars Seth Rogen as a 
frankfurter who finds out that food gets eaten.

Disney’s latest live-action outing, Pete’s Dragon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/petes-dragon>, was in third place with $21.5m 
in its opening weekend. David Lowery’s remake of the 1977 children’s film, 
about an orphan who befriends a goofy mythical beast, has scored highly with 
critics and is predicted to do well as the school holidays continue.

The week’s other new release, the Meryl Streep comedy-drama Florence Foster 
Jenkins <https://www.theguardian.com/film/florence-foster-jenkins>, charted at 
No 8. Stephen Frears’s film, based on the real-life story of the tone-deaf 
opera singer, took $6.6m.
