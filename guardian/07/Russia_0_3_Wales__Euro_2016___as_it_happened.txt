Here’s Chris Coleman: “The performance was even sweeter than the points. This 
group of players are on the way to more success, this is just part of the 
journey. We respect everyone but there’s nothing to fear. When we play like 
that, why should we have any fear?”

And looking ahead, it takes Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> 
out of France’s path in the (potential) quarter-finals. And places England 
there instead.

Well, well, well. The third-placed team from either Group A, C or D await Wales
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> in the last 16: it’s still pretty 
unclear but Albania, Northern Ireland and Czech Republic look the most likely 
in my book. England will take on the runners up in Group F: Iceland, Portugal, 
Austria or Hungary.

smartly ignores the ball, which allows the charging Bale to pick up and poke 
his third goal of the tournament beyond Akinfeev.

central defence. This time he really should play the pass, though, and his 
failure to do so means the attack breaks down.

Right, that’s it from me. Stick around on site for all the reports and 
reaction. Cheerio!
 
Here’s Chris Coleman: “The performance was even sweeter than the points. This 
group of players are on the way to more success, this is just part of the 
journey. We respect everyone but there’s nothing to fear. When we play like 
that, why should we have any fear?”

And looking ahead, it takes Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> 
out of France’s path in the (potential) quarter-finals. And places England 
there instead.
 
Well, well, well. The third-placed team from either Group A, C or D await Wales
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> in the last 16: it’s still pretty 
unclear but Albania, Northern Ireland and Czech Republic look the most likely 
in my book. England will take on the runners up in Group F: Iceland, Portugal, 
Austria or Hungary.
 
That’s it full-time: England 0-0 Slovakia. WALES TOP THE GROUP!!
 
They’re deep into five minutes of added time in Saint-Etienne. It’s still 0-0.
 
Peep! PEEP!!! PEEEEEP!!! They’ve done it. What a moment for Wales! What a 
performance.

90+3 min: And cue images of more tearful Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> fans. They’ve got every right to 
have a tear in their eye this time, though.
 
90+2 min: Dzyuba scoops the ball over the bar once more as the ball drops 
loose from a corner.
 
90 min: Two minutes of added time stand between Wales and the last 16 of Euro 
2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016>.
 
89 min: If – and it’s a big if, as England-Slovakia hasn’t finished – Wales 
top the group the third-placed team from either A, C or D – soAlbania, Northern 
Ireland (possibly) or Czech Rep (possibly) – await in the last 16. And I’d back 
thisWales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> side against any of that 
trio.
 
88 min: This really has been a superb performance from Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> – at turns thrilling and 
professional. “What’s the Welsh for tika taka?” wonders Ian Morgan.
 
86 min: “Whilst I agree with Chris Drew, can I add this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/07/warrington-paul-wood-testicle-grand-final>
 to the list of sporting moments that bring a tear to the eye,” requests Andy 
Gordon.
 
85 min: Dzyuba slides in and scoops an effort over the bar from six yards. 
 
84 min: “If Treorchy have to sing anything on this week of Mametz it has to be 
this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5O8m2oEqpE>,” writes Kerry Davies.
 
83 min: Bale’s night is done. He goes off to a standing ovation. And he’s 
replaced by Simon Church.

82 min: Pass, pass, pass, go Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales>
. Ole, ole, ole, go their fans.
 
80 min: This game, having bounced around like a toddler fuelled by a Haribo 
overdose for 70-odd minutes, has now curled up in a corner and gone to sleep. 
The Russian team can’t wait to get out of Toulouse.
 
79 min: … Ignashevich absolutely leathers it. Into the Welsh fans behind the 
goal.
 
77 min: Chester clumsily whacks into Kokorin 30 yards from the Wales goal. 
Dangerous free-kick forRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/russia> …
 
75 min: Joe Ledley goes down with what looks like a touch of cramp. 
Suspiciously conveniently, it’s on the far side of the field and his number has 
just been raised by the fourth official. He goes off, on comes Andy King.
 
74 min: The spice that was creeping into the game has dissipated with that 
third goal. Hence the firstWales <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> 
change: Joe Allen gets a deserved rest – he’s been superb tonight. On comes 
David Edwards.
 
73 min: “Two things that bring tears to my eyes,” writes Chris Drew. “Firstly, 
Wales qualifying out of the group. Secondly,this 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FFaxOv3nnU>.”
 
72 min: Ramsey picks Mamaev’s pocket in midfield. Mamaev pulls him back … but 
doesn’t show a second yellow for some reason.
 
71 min: And still, as it stands, Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wales> top the group.

70 min: Smolov off, Samedov on for Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/russia>.
 
69 min: “At what point can Wales be confident enough to give Bale some time 
off?” wrotes Adam Hirst late in the first half. Now would be the point I think. 
Though I doubt he’d want to come off given the state of theRussia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/russia> defence.
 
And that should be that. Bale gets the goal his performance has thoroughly 
deserved. Ramsey pokes the ball beyond theRussia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/russia> defence, the offside Vokes 
smartly ignores the ball, which allows the charging Bale to pick up and poke 
his third goal of the tournament beyond Akinfeev.

67 min: A little hint of frustration has crept into the Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/russia> side now, which is no surprise.
 
66 min: … which is nodded across goal by Vokes and evades Ledley by a yard or 
two.
 
64 min: Mamaev deliberately looks to check Allen as he scurries back to make a 
challenge. He’s booked. And Bale has another set-piece …
 
63 min: Glushakov hits a first-time effort from distance but drills the ball 
into the ground and sends it bobbling wide.
 
61 min: Bale again looks to shimmy past a terrified and backpeddling Russian 
central defence. This time he really should play the pass, though, and his 
failure to do so means the attack breaks down.
