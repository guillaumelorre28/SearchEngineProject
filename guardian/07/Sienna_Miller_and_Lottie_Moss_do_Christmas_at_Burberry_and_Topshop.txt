November is underway and that can mean only one thing: Christmas consumerism 
is in full swing. While theJohn Lewis Christmas advert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/06/john-lewis-christmas-advert-age-uk>
, the klaxon that the season has officially begun, is expected to air on 
Friday, take heart,Topshop <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/topshop> and 
Burberry are starting the seasonal ad onslaught in style.

Both brands released their Christmas campaigns on Tuesday, targeting different 
audiences. Burberry doesn’t do things by halves, Christmas is worth blowing the 
budget to make customers to do the same. Its Christmas campaign,the Tale of 
Thomas Burberry <https://uk.burberry.com/festive-film/>, is a short film to 
mark 160 years of the brand, starring Dominic West, Sienna Miller, Lily James 
and directed by Asif Kapadia, the man behind Amy. It manages to amp up the 
brand’s heritage, making the story of the founder Thomas Burberry look as if 
it’s worthy of a feature film.

Watching this feels less like an advert and more like a popcorn-and-coke 
trailer. It has romance, with Sienna Miller as Burberry’s wife, drama with West 
as Sir Ernest Shackleton, the explorer, and first world war soldiers in trench 
coats, plus– spoiler alert – a flirtation with aviator Betty Dawson, a 
fictionalised version of the real-life Betty Kirby Green. It leaves you wanting 
to watch the non-existent full-length version – and buy a classictrench coat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/hands-behind-the-heritage-inside-the-burberry-factory>
. As expected from a shrewd brand that pioneered streaming runway shows and the 
see now buy now model, you can “shop the film” online.

Topshop has stuck to stills but its campaign speaks directly to their younger 
consumer, supplying squad party dresses to slay those of any rivals. The ad 
features not one but nine models, going for the multi-model trend also seen in 
ads forNet-A-Porter 
<http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/net-a-porters-multimodel-fall-campaign-10499113/>
, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton. In a Christmas context, this is less about a 
brand not being able to make up its mind on one woman to represent it for a 
season, and more about bringing the party – and the party clothes.

This group of diverse, smiling girls look as if they would be great to head 
out with, don’t they? Your gang includes sister-of-Kate Lottie Moss, catwalk 
favourites Damaris Goddrie and Marjan Jonkman, andVictoria Secret’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/11/victorias-secret-show-2015-six-things-we-learned>
 model Stella Maxwell. Our favourite is Londone Myers, mainly because she was a 
postmortem assistant before becoming a model. They wear everything from a 
velvet suit (Jonkman), camisole and skirt (Moss), jeans and bomber (Myers) and 
sequin dress (Maxwell), all outfits perfect for wrapping up under the tree or 
solving a Christmas party wardrobe crisis. Either way, this is an image 
designed to get the tills ringing. Job done.

With Christmas a key money-spinner, these campaigns don’t just serve to 
acclimatise you to the tinsel-and-fairylights season. They’re the final push to 
get you spending– both to play it safe, and add a bit of razzledazzle. It’s a 
combination that is perfect forChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, a time of year that is as 
much about cosy comfort as it is about glamour.
