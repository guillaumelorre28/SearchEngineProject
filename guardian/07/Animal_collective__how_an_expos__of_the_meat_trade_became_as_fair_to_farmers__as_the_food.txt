The Animal Condition kicks off in full-blown leftist activist mode: a group of 
four then 20-something friends – Michael Dahlstrom, Ande Cunningham, Sarah-Jane 
McAllan and Augusta Miller – stumble across videos online of abattoirs and are 
incensed by what they see.

The four Nida graduates thus resolve to make an undercover documentary 
exposing the wicked ways of the Australian meat trade. They secure a small 
amount of funding from an animal welfare organisation and hook up with hardcore 
activists who, in a cloak-and-dagger-like way, sneak them on to paddocks and 
into battery hen factories under the cover of darkness.

The biggest surprise wasn’t what they found on farms in the dead of night but 
the response they got when they approached authorities in broad daylight. 
According to Dahlstrom, the now 36-year-old director, the industry had a 
reputation for not talking to film-makers; that applied especially, one 
assumes, to inexperienced hotheads who were literally jumping the fence.

So they tried a different tack: “After realising we were only getting one side 
of the story we went in with honesty and said we’d been hanging out with 
activists,” he says. “The first ones we spoke to were Australian Pork Ltd. They 
took us by surprise and allowed us to go into their farms. A lot of times just 
with the farmer, not any PR people or media spokespeople. They often gave us 
unfettered access.”

Impressed by this transparency – surely a reminder of Lyndon B Johnson’s old 
saying about tents and pissing <http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/pissing> – the 
group resolved to keep an open mind.

Like each of the four, Miller, 30, served as a writer, producer and on-screen 
investigator: “Some of us were meat eaters, some of us were vegetarians,” she 
says. “We had a wide perspective of ideas about food and the right way – or the 
wrong way – to consume food. But we were open to those ideas changing.”

The result is a deeply engrossing documentary with a refreshingly honest and 
self-reflexive approach, engendering a real sense that the audience’s journey 
is one shared by the film-makers. Shot over the course of just under four 
years, Dahlstrom and his team watched as treatment of cattle became a hot 
topic, thanks in part to stories broadcast onFour Corners  <>and 60 Minutes 
<http://www.animalsaustralia.org/features/60-minutes-the-hidden-truth.php>.


“By the end of the film we were hearing things from all sides. From activists, 
scientists, ethicists, farmers, industry and government,” he says. “As we 
started to find ourselves at the heart of a key issue for Australia – live 
export and animal welfare – we found that people suddenly wanted to talk to us.”

Key on-screen talent is varied, including the leader of Katter’s Australian 
party, Bob Katter, the Greens senator Lee Rhiannon, the then agriculture 
minister, Joe Ludwig, a number of industry representatives and animal welfare 
advocates Peter Singer and Lyn White.

What the team also found, according to Miller, was that a great deal more was 
being asked of farmers in an area few had expertise in: media management.

“For a lot of these men and women, who have long histories in agriculture, 
they haven’t necessarily had to discuss their farming practices with the 
public,” she says. “They’ve had to learn very quickly how to talk about what 
they do in a quote/unquote ‘palatable’ manner.

“It’s something that, for many people in the industry, goes back generations, 
so you’re dealing with something that is very personal to them. I could see the 
struggle they were having with suddenly having to metaphorically and literally 
open the doors.”

Perhaps it is ironic that a film sensitive to issues facing farmers begins 
with the creators sneaking on to their land. The issue of secretly recorded 
footage is a topical one, with the government introducing bans in recent years 
on filming in detention centres (as the recent documentaryChasing Asylum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/29/chasing-asylum-first-look-review-asylum-seeker-documentary-is-vital-and-gut-wrenching>
 reminded us) and Barnaby Joyce coming down hard againstanimal rights activists

<http://www.theland.com.au/story/3380094/joyce-still-backs-anti-trespass-laws>. 

“Were it not for Animals <https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals> Australia 
and their undercover footage in places like Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, 
Malaysia, Jordan and Pakistan, we wouldn’t know what is going on with 
Australian animals being sent overseas,” Miller says.

“It produces a lot of anger, both from industry and from the public. But until 
there’s transparency within animal husbandry and agribusiness, I think 
undercover footage is a necessary part of this conversation.”

Perhaps it also a reminder that undercover footage is not necessarily a 
synonym for “lopsided” or “unfair”. One of the subjects that drew the most 
sympathy from Dahlstrom is the same kind of person you might assume, if you 
only watched the film’s jumping-the-fence opening act, that the team would want 
taken out of business.

When the director met Malcolm Gett, one of the pioneers of animal 
intensification in Australia in the 1970s, the farmer had spent hundreds of 
thousand of dollars installing new sow stalls. These are small cages where 
breeding sows can only take one step forward and one step back, and can’t turn 
around.

While The Animal Condition was being shot, Dahlstrom says, “the governing 
body, Australian Pork Limited, came to an agreement where they were going to 
phase out sow stalls. This farmer ended up going bankrupt as a result. He was 
struggling at the beginning of the shoot but thought he’d pull through. By the 
time we were in post, he’d lost his farm.

“You’ve really got to look big picture with these things. If you go out and 
want to see change, it’s not just about wanting to see the change happen 
overnight.

“If you were someone who wanted to see an end to, say, battery hen farming, 
you need to see through that transition. In order for it to be effective, you 
have to have a plan so the hit on people’s livelihood doesn’t crush them.”
