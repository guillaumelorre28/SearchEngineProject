wife reminded me of her favourite forced kit change: a referee supposedly 
stopped the game to make a mascot change his shorts,” emailed TJ Gerlach last 
week

Villa, Boro or Chelsea?). I can’t find any record online. Any idea when and 
where this occurred?”

On 19 March 2005 relegation-threatened Norwich City travelled north to the 
Reebok Stadium and a meeting with Sam Allardyce’s Bolton Wanderers. Allardyce’s 
side were flying high while the Canaries were on their way to relegation, but 
the match was a notable one for the Wanderers mascot, Lofty the Lion.The Bolton 
News takes up the tale 
<http://m.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/5790007.Norwich_players_give_Lofty_s_strip_the_red_card/?ref=arc>
:

“The visiting Norwich players complained that Lofty was affecting their 
concentration, claiming he looked exactly the same as the Wanderers players. 
The Bolton mascot was cheering on the Whites from the side of the Reebok pitch 
during the game as he has done at every home match for years.

“But the Norwich players had a problem with him wearing the same white shorts 
and socks as the home players, saying that it made him indistinguishable from 
Sam Allardyce’s men. You would have thought the enormous lion’s head and giant 
mane would have given them a clue.

“Lofty was banished to an invisible corner of the stadium before returning to 
cheer on the Whites for the rest of the game – after a change of shorts and 
socks.”

It didn’t do Norwich much good. Stelios Giannakopoulos scored the only goal of 
the game in a 1-0 win for Wanderers.

Everyday is like Zibo Sunday

“We all know about Sheffield Wednesday and, to a lesser extent, Abergavenny 
Thursdays,” wrote George McSorley last week. “There is also a team in China 
called Zibo Sunday. Has there been a team for every day of the week?”

Let’s begin with an explanation of the little-known Abergavenny Thursdays. “In 
Wales, Abergavenny Thursdays represent the tip of a substantial iceberg of 
clubs named after Thursday at the turn of the 1900s,” writes Craig Owen Jones. 
“Many Welsh towns had half-day closing on a Thursday, a circumstance that led 
to the formation of countless clubs. In north Wales alone there was a Rhyl 
Thursdays, a Denbigh Thursdays, and a Prestatyn Thursdays (or Thursday, 
depending on which source you read); my grandfather kept goal for the latter. 
In the south, a Thursday League was even formed in 1909; it was still in 
existence in 1914, and included clubs such as Merthyr Thursdays and Dowlais 
Thursdays.


Similarly Sheffield Wednesday were the offshoot of The Wednesday Cricket Club, 
so named because Wednesday was the day off of the local tradesmen who formed 
the club. Zibo Sunday’s roots are rather less clear, though they do appear to 
have existed and taken part in China’s cup competition.Briefly. At some point

But what of the rest of the week? Monday FC, based in the small Danish town of 
Vipperod (population: 2,267), arerecognised by the Danish FA 
<http://www.dbusjaelland.dk/turneringer_og_resultater/resultatsoegning/position.aspx?poolid=232720>
, though they don’t compete at a particularly high level. “Remember that it 
costs a case of beer, if you have signed up for [a match] and do not show up,”
says their website <http://mondayfc.dk/doodle.html>.


Bristol’s Cutters Friday FC <https://twitter.com/cuttersfriday> currently sit 
bottom of the Division One East of the Somerset County League 
<http://full-time.thefa.com/ProcessPublicSelect.do;jsessionid=D4B0D783EBD690D07BAC38B883194ABA?psSelectedSeason=688408260&psSelectedDivision=674805541&psSelectedCompetition=0&psSelectedLeague=3894227>
, having lost four of their five matches so far this season.

All of which leaves Tuesday and Saturday for which we can do little better 
than point to Shepherds Tuesday FC – “Sunday League’s staunchest advocates of 
wing-backs <https://twitter.com/shepstuesdayfc>” – and the AS Nancy ultras 
group FC Saturday <http://saturday-fc.fr/>.

Unbeaten at home, unimpressive away


“The Daily Express is predicting the outcome of the league every week,” wrote 
Alex Potter last week.“This week, its prediction is that Leicester will finish 
the season unbeaten at home but will only get a point away all season. It made 
me laugh a little and then wonder: has anything like that ever happened before?”


Why is Nigeria the world's toughest league in which to get an away win? | Paul 
Doyle

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/29/nigeria-toughest-league-win-away>
In short, yes. For the longer version, here’s Liam McGuigan: “You can begin by 
looking atthe Guardian’s own article on the Nigerian Premier League from 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/29/nigeria-toughest-league-win-away>
.


“Nobody picked up just one point away from home, but two clubs went better 
than that - Kaduna United losing all 19 away matches while having 17 wins and 
two draws at home, and Gombe United also managing 18 wins and a draw at home 
opposite 19 away defeats.”


“The overall trend of home invincibility and away vulnerability is not new in 
the NPL, where travelling teams face perilous challenges relating to violent 
crowds, questionable refereeing and, indeed, travel itself,” writes Paul Doyle 
in that very piece. “Arriving just before kick-off after long road trips, often 
on hazardous surfaces, is far from ideal preparation for players. And they do 
not always arrive. Last season two matches were postponed when first Sunshine 
Stars and then Wikki Tourists were robbed on their way to games. Mostly, of 
course, teams do make it to grounds – and that is when they must contend with 
fans and referees.”

Of recent note in Europe, Sevilla had an impressively skewed home/away record 
in Spain last season, with a P19 W14 D1 L4 record at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán 
and a P19 W0 D9 L10 record away from home.

Leaving it late


“Newcastle’s comeback against Norwich last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/newcastle-united-norwich-city-championship-match-report>
 – has a team ever come back to win after scoring their equaliser as late as 
the 95th minute?” asked Rob Smyth last week. “I know there have been two in 
injury-time before but I’ve never seen that.”

Dwight Gayle’s equaliser for Newcastle four minutes and 50 seconds into injury 
time remains, narrowly, the latest leveller we’ve found for a team that has 
gone on to win, but there are several other late revivals of note.

“On 23 November 2002 I was at Field Mill (my preferred game having been 
postponed) to see Mansfield Town take on Bristol City,” writes Justin Horton. 
“The hosts, 4-2 up late on, still led 4-3 going into the fifth minute of injury 
time when a City goal – to my recollection, four minutes and 33 seconds into 
time added on – silenced the home crowd. There was still time enough for City’s
Christian Roberts to grab a winner in the 96th minute 
<http://www.stagsnet.net/match/reports/viewreport.php?matchid=25)>.”


In a similar vein in January this year Barrow led Tranmere 3-1 going into 
injury-time only to contrive to lose 4-3. Lois Maynard brought Rovers back into 
it in the 90th minute, Jeff Hughes made it 3-3 in the 92nd andJake Kirby 
grabbed the winner in the 95th <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35212032>.


“Arsenal took the lead in the 98th minute of their game against Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/17/arsenal-liverpool-live> in 
April 2011 only to concede an equaliser in the 102nd minute,” notes James 
Byrne. “Has anyone ever taken the lead later than the 98th minute and still 
failed to win (excluding matches that have gone to extra-time)?”

“After Di Canio and Holloway departed relegation-threatened clubs relatively 
early in the season, it seems as if the first action for clubs threatened by 
the drop is to change the manager,”wrote Matt Cooke in 2013. “In the Premier 
League era how many clubs have been relegated without resorting to changing 
their manager at any point during the season?”

There’s nothing the Knowledge enjoys more than an in-depth trawl through the 
dusty annals of football history but on this occasion readers Pete Tomlin and 
Colin Owens have done all the leg work. Thanks to both.

Here’s the full list of relegated teams who did not change manager during the 
season:

1992-93: Crystal Palace (Steve Coppell), Middlesbrough (Lennie Lawrence), 
Nottingham Forest (Brian Clough),
1993-94: Sheffield United (Dave Bassett), Oldham Athletic (Joe Royle), Swindon 
Town (John Gorman),
1994-95: Crystal Palace (Alan Smith)
1995-96: Manchester City (Alan Ball), QPR (Ray Wilkins),
1996-97: Sunderland (Peter Reid), Middlesbrough (Bryan Robson),
1997-98: Bolton Wanderers (Colin Todd), Barnsley (Danny Wilson),
1998-99: Charlton Athletic (Alan Curbishley),
1999-00: Watford (Graham Taylor)
2000-01: Manchester City (Joe Royle), Coventry City (Gordon Strachan),
2001-02: Ipswich Town (George Burley),

“The only connection between ghosts and football that I can think of is the 
Stanley Holloway monologue ‘With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm’,” begins 
Robin Clarke. “It contains this verse:

The sentries think that it’s a football,
That she carries in.
And when they’ve had a few they shout,
‘Is Ars’nal going to win?’
They think it’s Alec James,
Instead of poor old Ann Boleyn,
With her head tucked underneath her arm

“Yet there must be enough football-related ghost stories to fill an 
encyclopaedia. I would like to hear them. Ghosts provided a useful social 
function. Centuries before police forces and investigative journalists ghost 
stories were one means of keeping local miscarriages of justice in the public 
eye. I suspect that certain countries are well-stocked with football-related 
ghosts.”

“I was studying David Speedie’s Wiki page because I was supposed to be 
working, and it seems to suggest that he played for four teams during the 
1992-93 season – Southampton. Birmingham, West Brom and West Ham,” reports Adam 
Webster. “I think four teams in one season is a lot, but is it a record?”

“I wonder if what I witnessed at Sixfields last weekend is some sort of 
record,” wonders Nathan Spencer. “With the score between Northampton and 
Bristol Rovers 2-2 in the 89th minute, and with Northampton defender Gabriel 
Zakuani already on a booking, the ref went off injured and was replaced by one 
of his assistants. By my reckoning the replacement ref booked Zakuani again and 
sent him off within 10 seconds of starting his short stint on the whistle. Is 
this the fastest red card involving a substituted referee?”

“Just a short one from me,” claims Paul Moroz. “We’re all comfortable with 
‘hitting the woodwork’, but when was the last time goal frames were actually 
made from wood? As an addendum, presumably wooden posts and crossbars were 
flat-fronted, plank arrangements, as opposed to their modern-day cylindrical 
cousins? Did the change of shape require a change of legislation? Yours 
curiously.”
