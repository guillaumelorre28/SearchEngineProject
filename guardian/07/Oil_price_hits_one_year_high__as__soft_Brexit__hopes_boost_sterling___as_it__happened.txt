Right, that’s all for today. A quick recap.

December has got off to a lively start in the financial markets, with big 
moves in the commodity and foreign exchange arenas.

Traders have driven the oil price sharply higher for the second day running. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/01/oil-price-brent-crude-opec-cut-eurozone-italy-business-live?page=with:block-5840328be4b015a427f765ef#block-5840328be4b015a427f765ef>
 Brent crude has hit its highest level since October 2015, jumping by almost 5% 
to $54.31 per barrel.

Despite questions over compliance, yesterday’s Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> deal is being seen as a real 
game-changer that could push prices higher - meaning fresh inflationary 
pressures and higher prices at the petrol pumps.

The pound has also romped higher today, after Brexit minister David Davis 
offered the tantalising prospect of the UK paying to access the EU single market
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/01/oil-price-brent-crude-opec-cut-eurozone-italy-business-live?page=with:block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5#block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5>
.

The comments, made in parliament, fuelled hopes that Britain might avoid a 
‘hard Brexit’. Sterling hit two-month highs, before dipping a little -- and is 
currently up 0.5% at $1.257.

Government bonds have also sold off today, driving up the yield on benchmark 
US debt. UK borrowing costs also rose, with the yield on 10-year gilts up from 
1.5% to 1.51%.

Over on Wall Street, machine and equipment firm Caterpillar briefly suspended 
its shares today so it could warn that analysts profit expectations are ‘too 
optimistic’.

Caterpillar cited various headwinds, such as Brexit uncertainty, Europe’s slow 
recovery and volatility in the oil price. It also warned that any 
infrastructure programme from Donald Trump probably wouldn’t help its earnings 
in 2017.

This is the key slide from its presentation to analysts:

Caterpillar’s share price has been rising for weeks, on speculation that 
Trump’s plans to upgrade America’s highways, airports and schools will mean 
more demand for its diggers and trucks.

But Wall Street isn’t too worried by today’s warning; Caterpillar’s shares 
have resumed trading, up 0.25% on the day.

BP signs off on Mad Dog 2 oil project

Now this is interesting....oil giant BP has signed off on a $9bn project to 
expand its Mad Dog oil field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

The decision follows extensive work bringing the cost of the project down (at 
one stage, it was going to cost $20bn). And it shows that oil firms are 
prepared to invest in new projects, if they think the oil price makes it 
worthwhile.

BP chief executive Bob Dudley says:

“This announcement shows that big deepwater projects can still be economic in 
a low price environment in the US if they are designed in a smart and 
cost-effective way.

“It also demonstrates the resilience of our strategy which is focused on 
building on incumbent positions in the world’s most prolific hydrocarbon basins 
while relentlessly focusing on value over volume.”

Central Bank news! Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank of Mexico, has resigned.

Carstens, one of the world’s most experienced central bankers, has been 
appointed to run the Bank of International Settlements (BIS is basically the 
central bankers’ central bank).

He will leave the Bank of Mexico in July 2017, and start at BIS three months 
later.

Carstens deserves a change of job, having been battling to handle the impact 
of Donald Trump’s pronouncements on the Mexican Peso.

Bloomberg’s Michael McDonough says the news adds extra uncertainty, with 
Mexico already expected to hike interest rates next month:
Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) 
Carstens departure adds some uncertainty, but Banxico's policy outlook doesn't 
change. They will likely follow the Fed with a hike in Dec.

<https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/804351541784301568> 
The top rung of central banking is a little like Formula 1 -- with a small 
number of candidates moving between a limited number of seats.

So Carstens’ appointment may have a knock-on effect on the European Central 
Bank; board member Benoît Cœuré could possible have got the BIS job, but is now 
free for other challenges...

Carstens' move also means #ECB <https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECB?src=hash>'s

Brent crude hits 2016 high

Boom! The Brent crude oil price has just hit its highest level of the year.

A barrel of Brent for February delivery just changed hands at $53.79, which is 
the most expensive since October 2015.

Opec’s surprise supply cut is forcing traders to rapidly reassess their 
expectations.

Jane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management, calls it 
a ‘knee jerk’ reaction to yesterday’s deal:


“Whilst at present the news is good for the markets, it is much more difficult 
to say how this will play out in the longer term.

We’re currently experiencing a knee-jerk reaction, unsurprising since this is 
the biggest co-ordinated action in eight years. It is likely that this will run 
on for a little while longer but how the markets price in the unexpected oil 
inflation is something we are yet to see.”

Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, has 
criticised the idea that Britain might make payments to the EU after leaving 
the bloc.

He was responding to David Davis’s suggestion that the UK would consider the 
idea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/01/oil-price-brent-crude-opec-cut-eurozone-italy-business-live?page=with:block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5#block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5>
.

PA has the story:

Prominent Brexit-backer Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Davis had given a 
“convoluted” answer and may have been talking about “bridging arrangements” to 
phase out UK contributions to the EU.

The former cabinet minister insisted there was no way of reaching a deal to 
pay the EU for access to the single market.

He told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One:

“My sense is that I don’t think that he was absolutely answering the question 
that was posed to him.

“What he’s talking about here is how do you get a deal that allows British and 
Europeans to access each others’ markets without the necessity of tariff 
barriers or artificial barriers against service etc.

“I don’t think there’s any way in which you can reach a deal whereby you say 
‘I’ll pay some money in and therefore you allow us access’, because you might 
as well have tariff barriers at that point.”

Other Brexit supporters have also expressed disquiet about this idea in the 
past; but it all depends on the kind of Brexit deal that Theresa May goes for.

Today’s pound rally follows the currency’s best month since 2009.

Sterling gained 6% against the euro in November, 1,5% against the US dollar, 
and almost 15% against the Japanese yen.

It may show that the markets are becoming less worried about the UK, following 
more solid economic data since June’s Brexit vote.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says:

Momentum is particularly strong against the yen and its recent performance has 
been staggering, GBPJPY is up more than 14% since the start of November!

Political risks around Brexit are receding, as political risks elsewhere start 
to bite. The cost to insure UK sovereign debt has fallen sharply since spiking 
back in June.

Good economic news from America: its factory sector is growing at its fastest 
pace since the Brexit vote.

The ISM manufacturing index has jumped to 53.2 in November, from 51.9 in 
October, which is the fastest rate since June. Firm said they were benefitting 
from strong domestic demand.

A rival survey, from Markit, was also just released. It’s even more 
encouraging, showing activity rising at a 13-month high.

Brent crude price hits new highs

Oil is surging even higher, as commodity traders continue to react to the Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> supply cut deal hammered out 
yesterday.

Brent crude is now up 3% at $53.44 per barrel, a near two-month high, and a 
really substantial surge from $46/barrel before the Opec meeting.

Opec’s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day looks like a real 
game-changer.

The group’s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, is telling Bloomberg TV 
right now that it was a “historic landmark”

Sam Wahab, director of oil and gas research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, 
believes the price could keep rising:


“Yesterday’s agreement has truly changed the landscape for oil over the coming 
years, putting a floor of $50 a barrel under oil prices.

“Prior to this agreement, the environment of sub $50 oil was likely to 
persist, but this move sufficiently addresses the supply/demand dynamics, with 
some 3.5% of supply being cut from January.

“It means 2017 will likely see prices around the $55-$60 a barrel mark, and we 
may yet see further jumps in prices as soon as next week if the non-OPEC 
members also agree a production cut at their meeting on Friday 9th December.

Right, that’s all for today. A quick recap.

December has got off to a lively start in the financial markets, with big 
moves in the commodity and foreign exchange arenas.

Traders have driven the oil price sharply higher for the second day running. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/01/oil-price-brent-crude-opec-cut-eurozone-italy-business-live?page=with:block-5840328be4b015a427f765ef#block-5840328be4b015a427f765ef>
 Brent crude has hit its highest level since October 2015, jumping by almost 5% 
to $54.31 per barrel.

Despite questions over compliance, yesterday’s Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> deal is being seen as a real 
game-changer that could push prices higher - meaning fresh inflationary 
pressures and higher prices at the petrol pumps.

The pound has also romped higher today, after Brexit minister David Davis 
offered the tantalising prospect of the UK paying to access the EU single market
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/01/oil-price-brent-crude-opec-cut-eurozone-italy-business-live?page=with:block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5#block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5>
.

The comments, made in parliament, fuelled hopes that Britain might avoid a 
‘hard Brexit’. Sterling hit two-month highs, before dipping a little -- and is 
currently up 0.5% at $1.257.

Government bonds have also sold off today, driving up the yield on benchmark 
US debt. UK borrowing costs also rose, with the yield on 10-year gilts up from 
1.5% to 1.51%.

Over on Wall Street, machine and equipment firm Caterpillar briefly suspended 
its shares today so it could warn that analysts profit expectations are ‘too 
optimistic’.

Caterpillar cited various headwinds, such as Brexit uncertainty, Europe’s slow 
recovery and volatility in the oil price. It also warned that any 
infrastructure programme from Donald Trump probably wouldn’t help its earnings 
in 2017.

This is the key slide from its presentation to analysts:

Caterpillar’s share price has been rising for weeks, on speculation that 
Trump’s plans to upgrade America’s highways, airports and schools will mean 
more demand for its diggers and trucks.

But Wall Street isn’t too worried by today’s warning; Caterpillar’s shares 
have resumed trading, up 0.25% on the day.

Now this is interesting....oil giant BP has signed off on a $9bn project to 
expand its Mad Dog oil field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

The decision follows extensive work bringing the cost of the project down (at 
one stage, it was going to cost $20bn). And it shows that oil firms are 
prepared to invest in new projects, if they think the oil price makes it 
worthwhile.

BP chief executive Bob Dudley says:

“This announcement shows that big deepwater projects can still be economic in 
a low price environment in the US if they are designed in a smart and 
cost-effective way.

“It also demonstrates the resilience of our strategy which is focused on 
building on incumbent positions in the world’s most prolific hydrocarbon basins 
while relentlessly focusing on value over volume.”

Central Bank news! Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank of Mexico, has resigned.

Carstens, one of the world’s most experienced central bankers, has been 
appointed to run the Bank of International Settlements (BIS is basically the 
central bankers’ central bank).

He will leave the Bank of Mexico in July 2017, and start at BIS three months 
later.

Carstens deserves a change of job, having been battling to handle the impact 
of Donald Trump’s pronouncements on the Mexican Peso.

Bloomberg’s Michael McDonough says the news adds extra uncertainty, with 
Mexico already expected to hike interest rates next month:
Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) 
Carstens departure adds some uncertainty, but Banxico's policy outlook doesn't 
change. They will likely follow the Fed with a hike in Dec.

The top rung of central banking is a little like Formula 1 -- with a small 
number of candidates moving between a limited number of seats.

So Carstens’ appointment may have a knock-on effect on the European Central 
Bank; board member Benoît Cœuré could possible have got the BIS job, but is now 
free for other challenges...

Opec’s surprise supply cut is forcing traders to rapidly reassess their 
expectations.

Jane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management, calls it 
a ‘knee jerk’ reaction to yesterday’s deal:


“Whilst at present the news is good for the markets, it is much more difficult 
to say how this will play out in the longer term.

We’re currently experiencing a knee-jerk reaction, unsurprising since this is 
the biggest co-ordinated action in eight years. It is likely that this will run 
on for a little while longer but how the markets price in the unexpected oil 
inflation is something we are yet to see.”
 
Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, has 
criticised the idea that Britain might make payments to the EU after leaving 
the bloc.

He was responding to David Davis’s suggestion that the UK would consider the 
idea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/01/oil-price-brent-crude-opec-cut-eurozone-italy-business-live?page=with:block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5#block-58401216e4b056d3d56ac2a5>
.

PA has the story:

Prominent Brexit-backer Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Davis had given a 
“convoluted” answer and may have been talking about “bridging arrangements” to 
phase out UK contributions to the EU.

The former cabinet minister insisted there was no way of reaching a deal to 
pay the EU for access to the single market.

He told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One:

“My sense is that I don’t think that he was absolutely answering the question 
that was posed to him.

“What he’s talking about here is how do you get a deal that allows British and 
Europeans to access each others’ markets without the necessity of tariff 
barriers or artificial barriers against service etc.

“I don’t think there’s any way in which you can reach a deal whereby you say 
‘I’ll pay some money in and therefore you allow us access’, because you might 
as well have tariff barriers at that point.”

Other Brexit supporters have also expressed disquiet about this idea in the 
past; but it all depends on the kind of Brexit deal that Theresa May goes for.
 
Today’s pound rally follows the currency’s best month since 2009.

Sterling gained 6% against the euro in November, 1,5% against the US dollar, 
and almost 15% against the Japanese yen.

It may show that the markets are becoming less worried about the UK, following 
more solid economic data since June’s Brexit vote.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says:

Momentum is particularly strong against the yen and its recent performance has 
been staggering, GBPJPY is up more than 14% since the start of November!

Political risks around Brexit are receding, as political risks elsewhere start 
to bite. The cost to insure UK sovereign debt has fallen sharply since spiking 
back in June.
 
Good economic news from America: its factory sector is growing at its fastest 
pace since the Brexit vote.

The ISM manufacturing index has jumped to 53.2 in November, from 51.9 in 
October, which is the fastest rate since June. Firm said they were benefitting 
from strong domestic demand.

A rival survey, from Markit, was also just released. It’s even more 
encouraging, showing activity rising at a 13-month high.

Opec’s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day looks like a real 
game-changer.

The group’s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, is telling Bloomberg TV 
right now that it was a “historic landmark”

Sam Wahab, director of oil and gas research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, 
believes the price could keep rising:


“Yesterday’s agreement has truly changed the landscape for oil over the coming 
years, putting a floor of $50 a barrel under oil prices.

“Prior to this agreement, the environment of sub $50 oil was likely to 
persist, but this move sufficiently addresses the supply/demand dynamics, with 
some 3.5% of supply being cut from January.

“It means 2017 will likely see prices around the $55-$60 a barrel mark, and we 
may yet see further jumps in prices as soon as next week if the non-OPEC 
members also agree a production cut at their meeting on Friday 9th December.
 
Today’s rally has pushed the pound to nearly a three-month high against the

That means it’s just 8% below its pre-referendum levels (having been down 15%
