The government will consider passing a law to force the Football Association 
to reform if it has not reorganised its council and board by April, the sports 
minister Tracey Crouch said on Tuesday. The FA, and other governing bodies, 
have been set that deadline for compliance witha new code of standards 
<https://www.sportengland.org/about-us/governance/a-code-for-sports-governance/>
 which require their boards to be more independent and diverse.

Crouch’s appearance at the culture, media and sport select committee came 
after the chairman, Damian Collins, revealed that a draft backbench bill is 
being prepared to reform the FA. That followed a letter to Collins from three 
former FA chairmen and two former directors who said they learned from 
experience thatthe governing body cannot reform itself

The former FA officials argued that English football is dominated by the 
“financial juggernaut” of thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> and that the FA is 
incapable of addressing that imbalance because it has too many vested interests 
on its board and a rule-making council of “elderly white men” who “block even 
the most minor of changes”.

Pressed by Collins about whether she would support legislation, Crouch said 
she believes the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, is taking reform seriously and she 
wants to give the FA time, but conceded: “If they don’t, there is always the 
potential for legislation in this area.”

Pressed further on the possibility, Crouch said: “I certainly don’t rule it 
out. I think [the FA] will want to take this opportunity not to get to a point 
where legislation is required.”

Crouch, a junior minister who like previous sports ministers has no place in 
the cabinet, did not give any detail about the realistic chances of time being 
made for legislation, any level of government support for it or how it could 
happen. She said that as the FA is not the only governing body which is failing 
to comply with the new standards for sports governance, introduced in October, 
any law would have to include these other sports.

The FA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa> is on notice that it will 
lose £30m public funding for grassroots football via Sport England and not 
receive support for any future World Cup bid if a reformed board and council 
are not delivered, Crouch told the select committee. The code for sports 
governance requires the boards of governing bodies to have 25% independent 
directors, aim for “gender parity and greater diversity”, and be “the ultimate 
decision-making body and exercise all of the powers of the organisation”.

In football, the FA council 
<http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/who-we-are/the-fa-council>, 
comprising more than 100 mostly elderly representatives of amateur county FAs 
and leagues, still has significant rule-making and blocking powers, while the 
current board of 12 has four members from the professional game, four from the 
amateur and only two independent directors, of whom only one, Heather Rabbatts, 
is a woman. Crouch said other governing bodies also failing to comply include 
the sports of athletics, rugby union, equestrianism and yachting.

Collins argued that the deterrent of losing £30m is insignificant to the FA, 
which has just signed a six-year overseas TV deal reportedly worth $1bn. On 
Tuesday the governing body announceda new Nike kit deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/13/football-association-clinches-400-million-nike-kit-deal-england-football-team>
 for the England teams that could be worth more than £400m. Crouch replied that 
she believed the loss of public money is an incentive and that the FA should be 
given time to reform.

The sports minister also said that the £100m announced by the Premier League 
as its investment for grassroots football annually, the equivalent of 3.75% of 
the Premier League’s new £8bn TV deals, is a good settlement, and that the 
league should not be tied to a percentage.

In the wake of Friday’s McLaren report into doping, which claimed that 
Russian-backed doping had corrupted London 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/09/more-than-1000-russian-athletes-benefitted-from-state-sponsored-doping>
, Crouch also announced a review into UK Anti-Doping in the new year but made 
it clear that it was chiefly because it had not faced one since it was set up 
in 2009.
