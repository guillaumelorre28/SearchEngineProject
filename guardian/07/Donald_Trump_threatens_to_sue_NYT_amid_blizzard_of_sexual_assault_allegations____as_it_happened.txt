A new poll for Bloomberg Politics has given Hillary Clinton a nine point lead 
in the critical state of Pennsylvania 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-13/pennsylvania-poll>. The 
margin is even bigger in the Philadelphia suburbs, where more than 80% of 
voters say they are bothered by the 2005 video of the Republican nominee 
bragging about groping women.

Clinton has 51 percent to Trump’s 42 percent in a two-way race statewide, with 
her margin swelling to 28 percentage points in four suburban counties that were 
once reliably Republican, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted 
Friday through Tuesday after the video’s release.

Clinton’s suburban advantage is 18 points larger than President Barack Obama’s 
winning margin there in 2012, meaning that to match Clinton’s strength in those 
counties and in urban areas, Trump would have to dramatically improve on his 
11-point lead in the rest of the state. Losing Pennsylvania’s 20 Electoral 
College votes would sharply curtail his paths to the White House.

Summary

Claire Phipps

On an extraordinary day even by 2016 standards, a raft of allegations emerged 
about Trump’s behaviour towards women and young girls.

 * Two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, told the New York Times that 
Trump groped or kissed them without consent 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html>.

 * Another woman, Mindy McGillivray, claimed 
<http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/palm-beach-post-exclusive-local-woman-says-trump-groped-her/w5ii48gwdJY9htsLl88GcP/>
 she was groped by the Republican nominee at a Trump foundation event at his 
Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida.

 * Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for People magazine, who said Trump forced 
himself on her <http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/>
 shortly before she was due to interview him and his wife in 2005.

 * Two Miss USA contestants claimed Trump deliberately walked in on them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
 when they were naked in a dressing room. Five Miss Teen USA contestants also
told Buzzfeed 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room>
 he had entered their dressing room while the young women – aged between 15 and 
19 – were getting changed. 
 * A recording emerged in which Trump appears to sexualise a young girl, with 
a video recording him saying of the child 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/trump-makes-inappropriate-remarks-about-10-year-old-girl-video>
: “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?” 
In separate recordings that emerged in the past week, Trump himself told 
Howard Stern in 2005 that he did in fact go backstage when contestants were 
undressing:

Well, I’ll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I’ll go backstage and 
everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are 
anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and 
therefore I’m inspecting it ... I sort of get away with things like that.

But on the specific allegations of inappropriate touching made on Wednesday, 
the Trump campaign has issued a number of denials:

 * Trump’s lawyer has written to New York Times editor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678#block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678>
 Dean Baquet to demand his organisation take down the article in which two 
women claim they were groped and kissed without their consent. 
 * The letter said 
<https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps/status/786423070248415232> the article was 
“reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel” and demanded “a full and immediate 
retraction and apology”. 
 * In response to claims by People magazine reporter 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> Natasha 
Stoynoff, the campaign said: “This never happened. There is no merit or 
veracity to this fabricated story.” 
 * Trump himself has not commented. His last tweet 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/786340623804751872> was eight hours 
ago, exhorting supporters to join him for a rally in Ohio.  Donald Trump at a

Elsewhere

 * Trump again insisted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57febc80e4b05d915e42455d#block-57febc80e4b05d915e42455d>
 that Hillary Clinton “has to go to jail” over the deletion of 33,000 emails 
from her private server. 
 * Hillary for America chair John Podesta said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57feb3f9e4b05d915e42453e#block-57feb3f9e4b05d915e42453e>
 the FBI believes the hacking of his personal email account – which was then
published by WikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57fe6e73e4b01d9dd2c90474#block-57fe6e73e4b01d9dd2c90474>
 – was committed by Russian state intelligence. 
 * Trump says Isis will take over the US if Clinton wins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-florida-rally-isis-hillary-clinton>
. 
 * And, speaking to supporters, in Lakeland, Florida, Trump pondered the 
possibility of losing the election:

If I lose, I will consider it the biggest waste of time, energy and money that 
I have ever done in my entire life.

The latest Trump tape to be retrieved from the archives was unearthed by CBS 
news 
<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-unearthed-footage-trump-says-of-10-year-old-i-am-going-to-be-dating-her-in-10-years/>
, which found a 1992 video of the businessman making inappropriate comments 
about a young girl:

 In an Entertainment Tonight Christmas feature in 1992, Trump looked at a 
group of young girls and said he would be dating one of them in 10 years. At 
the time, Trump would have been 46 years old.


The video, released Wednesday evening, was shot at Trump Tower.


In the clip, Trump asks one of the girls if she’s “going up the escalator”. 
When the girl replies, “yeah”, Trump turns to the camera and says: “I am going 
to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?”

A reminder: on the specific allegations of inappropriate touching made on 
Wednesday, the Trump campaign has issued a number of denials.

Trump’s lawyer has written to New York Times editor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678#block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678>
 Dean Baquet to demand his organisation take down an article in which two women 
claim they were groped and kissed without their consent by the Republican 
nominee.

The letter said <https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps/status/786423070248415232> 
the article was “reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel” and demanded “a 
full and immediate retraction and apology”.

In response to claims by People magazine reporter 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> Natasha 
Stoynoff that Trump forced his tongue down her throat ahead of an interview, 
the campaign said: “This never happened. There is no merit or veracity to this 
fabricated story.”

Trump himself has not commented. His last tweet was seven hours ago, exhorting 
supporters to join him for a rally in Ohio:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
I will be in Cincinnati, Ohio tomorrow night at 7:30pm- join me!

US enters Yemen war

Spencer Ackerman

Retaliating for days of attacks on a navy warship, the United States has 
launched its first strike on Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, becoming an 
active combatant in a brutal war led by Washington’s allySaudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia>.


The Pentagon announced late on Wednesday that it struck and destroyed three 
radar sites controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi movement in Yemen. The 
sites were described as being involved in two missile attacks over the past 
four days on the destroyer USS Mason, operating out of the Bab al-Mandeb 
waterway betweenYemen <https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen> and east Africa.

There was no immediate word on any casualties from the US attack on the radar 
sites, which the Pentagon noted came with the direct authorization of President 
Barack Obama.

Buzzfeed has now reported 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing>
 the claims of five Miss Teen USA contestants who said Trump entered their 
dressing room while they were changing. But, Buzzfeedalso reports 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/dinograndoni/trump-supporters-unfazed-by-story-of-him-walking-in-on-teen>
, that revelation doesn’t seem to have fazed Trump supporters:

 “Frankly, I think that was years ago. It didn’t kill anybody,” said Gay Light 
of Oxford, Florida.

Trump himself told Howard Stern in 2005 that he did in fact go backstage when 
contestants were undressing:

Well, I’ll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I’ll go backstage and 
everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are 
anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and 
therefore I’m inspecting it ... I sort of get away with things like that.

Katrina Pierson, spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, has told CNN that the 
women who have come forward with claims about the nominee simply want “15 
minutes of fame”.

Pierson also disputed the account given to the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html> by 
Jessica Leeds, who claimed Trump had moved an armrest between their seats and 
grabbed her without her consent during a flight to New York more than 30 years 
ago:

The first-class seats have fixed armrests so what I can tell you about her 
story, if she was groped on a plane, it wasn’t byDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and it certainly wasn’t in 
first class.

(I’m not able right now to fact-check the moveability of first-class armrests 
in the early 1980s, but I’m sure someone will.)

Edit: here’s Pierson reeling off her knowledge of early 1980s aircraft:

By the early hours of Thursday (US time) the list of new allegations against 
Trump included:

 * Two Miss USA contestants who claimed Trump deliberately walked in on them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
 when they were naked in a dressing room. Five Miss Teen USA contestants also
told Buzzfeed 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room>
 he had entered their dressing room while the young women – aged between 15 and 
19 – were getting changed. 
 * Two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, who allege Trump groped or 
kissed them without consent 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html> – one 
in the first-class seat of an aircraft.

 * A claim by another woman 
<http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/palm-beach-post-exclusive-local-woman-says-trump-groped-her/w5ii48gwdJY9htsLl88GcP/>
, Mindy McGillivray, that she was groped at a Trump event at his Mar-A-Lago 
estate in Florida.

 * An account by Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for People magazine, who says 
Trump forced himself on her 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> shortly 
before she was due to interview him and his wife in 2005.

 * An incident in which Trump appears to sexualise a young girl 
<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-unearthed-footage-trump-says-of-10-year-old-i-am-going-to-be-dating-her-in-10-years/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=29868172>
, with video recording him saying of the child: “I am going to be dating her in 
10 years. Can you believe it?”

So Trump has not (yet) filed suit against the New York Times. But here’s the 
letter sent by his lawyers to the New York Times, demanding the newspaper take 
down the article detailing how two women allege they were groped by the 
Republican nominee, and calling for “a full and immediate retraction and 
apology”.

• This liveblog was amended on 13 October 2016. Previous posts made unverified 
claims regarding a young girl’s age about whom Trump had made inappropriate 
comments.
 
A new poll for Bloomberg Politics has given Hillary Clinton a nine point lead 
in the critical state of Pennsylvania 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-13/pennsylvania-poll>. The 
margin is even bigger in the Philadelphia suburbs, where more than 80% of 
voters say they are bothered by the 2005 video of the Republican nominee 
bragging about groping women.

Clinton has 51 percent to Trump’s 42 percent in a two-way race statewide, with 
her margin swelling to 28 percentage points in four suburban counties that were 
once reliably Republican, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted 
Friday through Tuesday after the video’s release.

Clinton’s suburban advantage is 18 points larger than President Barack Obama’s 
winning margin there in 2012, meaning that to match Clinton’s strength in those 
counties and in urban areas, Trump would have to dramatically improve on his 
11-point lead in the rest of the state. Losing Pennsylvania’s 20 Electoral 
College votes would sharply curtail his paths to the White House.
 
Here’s video of Donald Trump making his clearest demand yet for Hillary Clinton
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> to be jailed over her 
mishandling of classified information as secretary of state.

Speaking at a rally in Florida on Wednesday, the Republican presidential 
candidate says: “She has to go to jail.”
Trump again calls for Clinton to be jailed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jailed-florida-video> 
On an extraordinary day even by 2016 standards, a raft of allegations emerged 
about Trump’s behaviour towards women and young girls.

 * Two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, told the New York Times that 
Trump groped or kissed them without consent 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html>.

 * Another woman, Mindy McGillivray, claimed 
<http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/palm-beach-post-exclusive-local-woman-says-trump-groped-her/w5ii48gwdJY9htsLl88GcP/>
 she was groped by the Republican nominee at a Trump foundation event at his 
Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida.

 * Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for People magazine, who said Trump forced 
himself on her <http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/>
 shortly before she was due to interview him and his wife in 2005.

 * Two Miss USA contestants claimed Trump deliberately walked in on them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
 when they were naked in a dressing room. Five Miss Teen USA contestants also
told Buzzfeed 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room>
 he had entered their dressing room while the young women – aged between 15 and 
19 – were getting changed. 
 * A recording emerged in which Trump appears to sexualise a young girl, with 
a video recording him saying of the child 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/trump-makes-inappropriate-remarks-about-10-year-old-girl-video>
: “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?” 
In separate recordings that emerged in the past week, Trump himself told 
Howard Stern in 2005 that he did in fact go backstage when contestants were 
undressing:

Well, I’ll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I’ll go backstage and 
everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are 
anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and 
therefore I’m inspecting it ... I sort of get away with things like that.

But on the specific allegations of inappropriate touching made on Wednesday, 
the Trump campaign has issued a number of denials:

 * Trump’s lawyer has written to New York Times editor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678#block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678>
 Dean Baquet to demand his organisation take down the article in which two 
women claim they were groped and kissed without their consent. 
 * The letter said 
<https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps/status/786423070248415232> the article was 
“reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel” and demanded “a full and immediate 
retraction and apology”. 
 * In response to claims by People magazine reporter 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> Natasha 
Stoynoff, the campaign said: “This never happened. There is no merit or 
veracity to this fabricated story.” 
 * Trump himself has not commented. His last tweet 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/786340623804751872> was eight hours 
ago, exhorting supporters to join him for a rally in Ohio.  Donald Trump at a 
campaign rally in Lakeland, Florida, on Wednesday. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty

Elsewhere

 * Trump again insisted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57febc80e4b05d915e42455d#block-57febc80e4b05d915e42455d>
 that Hillary Clinton “has to go to jail” over the deletion of 33,000 emails 
from her private server. 
 * Hillary for America chair John Podesta said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57feb3f9e4b05d915e42453e#block-57feb3f9e4b05d915e42453e>
 the FBI believes the hacking of his personal email account – which was then
published by WikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57fe6e73e4b01d9dd2c90474#block-57fe6e73e4b01d9dd2c90474>
 – was committed by Russian state intelligence. 
 * Trump says Isis will take over the US if Clinton wins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-florida-rally-isis-hillary-clinton>
. 
 * And, speaking to supporters, in Lakeland, Florida, Trump pondered the 
possibility of losing the election:

If I lose, I will consider it the biggest waste of time, energy and money that 
I have ever done in my entire life.
 
The latest Trump tape to be retrieved from the archives was unearthed by CBS 
news 
<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-unearthed-footage-trump-says-of-10-year-old-i-am-going-to-be-dating-her-in-10-years/>
, which found a 1992 video of the businessman making inappropriate comments 
about a young girl:

 In an Entertainment Tonight Christmas feature in 1992, Trump looked at a 
group of young girls and said he would be dating one of them in 10 years. At 
the time, Trump would have been 46 years old.


The video, released Wednesday evening, was shot at Trump Tower.


In the clip, Trump asks one of the girls if she’s “going up the escalator”. 
When the girl replies, “yeah”, Trump turns to the camera and says: “I am going 
to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?”

Trump’s lawyer has written to New York Times editor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election-live?page=with:block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678#block-57ff0d6ce4b05d915e424678>
 Dean Baquet to demand his organisation take down an article in which two women 
claim they were groped and kissed without their consent by the Republican 
nominee.

The letter said <https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps/status/786423070248415232> 
the article was “reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel” and demanded “a 
full and immediate retraction and apology”.

In response to claims by People magazine reporter 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> Natasha 
Stoynoff that Trump forced his tongue down her throat ahead of an interview, 
the campaign said: “This never happened. There is no merit or veracity to this 
fabricated story.”

Trump himself has not commented. His last tweet was seven hours ago, exhorting 
supporters to join him for a rally in Ohio:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
I will be in Cincinnati, Ohio tomorrow night at 7:30pm- join me!

However, a 3am tweet storm from Trump is not unknown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/donald-trump-alicia-machado-clinton-twitter-unhinged>
; it’s currently 2am on the US east coast.
 
Retaliating for days of attacks on a navy warship, the United States has 
launched its first strike on Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, becoming an 
active combatant in a brutal war led by Washington’s allySaudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia>.


The Pentagon announced late on Wednesday that it struck and destroyed three 
radar sites controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi movement in Yemen. The 
sites were described as being involved in two missile attacks over the past 
four days on the destroyer USS Mason, operating out of the Bab al-Mandeb 
waterway betweenYemen <https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen> and east Africa.

There was no immediate word on any casualties from the US attack on the radar 
sites, which the Pentagon noted came with the direct authorization of President 
Barack Obama.

Buzzfeed has now reported 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing>
 the claims of five Miss Teen USA contestants who said Trump entered their 
dressing room while they were changing. But, Buzzfeedalso reports 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/dinograndoni/trump-supporters-unfazed-by-story-of-him-walking-in-on-teen>
, that revelation doesn’t seem to have fazed Trump supporters:

 “Frankly, I think that was years ago. It didn’t kill anybody,” said Gay Light 
of Oxford, Florida.

Trump himself told Howard Stern in 2005 that he did in fact go backstage when 
contestants were undressing:

Well, I’ll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I’ll go backstage and 
everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are 
anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and 
therefore I’m inspecting it ... I sort of get away with things like that.
 
Katrina Pierson, spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, has told CNN that the 
women who have come forward with claims about the nominee simply want “15 
minutes of fame”.

Pierson also disputed the account given to the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html> by 
Jessica Leeds, who claimed Trump had moved an armrest between their seats and 
grabbed her without her consent during a flight to New York more than 30 years 
ago:

The first-class seats have fixed armrests so what I can tell you about her 
story, if she was groped on a plane, it wasn’t byDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and it certainly wasn’t in 
first class.

(I’m not able right now to fact-check the moveability of first-class armrests 
in the early 1980s, but I’m sure someone will.)

Edit: here’s Pierson reeling off her knowledge of early 1980s aircraft:

By the early hours of Thursday (US time) the list of new allegations against 
Trump included:

 * Two Miss USA contestants who claimed Trump deliberately walked in on them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
 when they were naked in a dressing room. Five Miss Teen USA contestants also
told Buzzfeed 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room>
 he had entered their dressing room while the young women – aged between 15 and 
19 – were getting changed. 
 * Two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, who allege Trump groped or 
kissed them without consent 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html> – one 
in the first-class seat of an aircraft.

 * A claim by another woman 
<http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/palm-beach-post-exclusive-local-woman-says-trump-groped-her/w5ii48gwdJY9htsLl88GcP/>
, Mindy McGillivray, that she was groped at a Trump event at his Mar-A-Lago 
estate in Florida.

 * An account by Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for People magazine, who says 
Trump forced himself on her 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> shortly 
before she was due to interview him and his wife in 2005.

 * An incident in which Trump appears to sexualise a young girl 
<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-unearthed-footage-trump-says-of-10-year-old-i-am-going-to-be-dating-her-in-10-years/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=29868172>
, with video recording him saying of the child: “I am going to be dating her in 
10 years. Can you believe it?”

So Trump has not (yet) filed suit against the New York Times. But here’s the 
letter sent by his lawyers to the New York Times, demanding the newspaper take 
down the article detailing how two women allege they were groped by the 
Republican nominee, and calling for “a full and immediate retraction and 
apology”.
