Søren Kjeldsen and Thorbjørn Olesen combined to win a first golf World Cup for 
Denmark with a four-shot triumph at Kingston Heath. The pair started the day 
four shots clear of Americans Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker and were able to 
hang tough on Sunday as several other teams challenged hard.

Their lead was trimmed to a single shot early on the back nine, but the Danes 
were more than equal to the challenge with six birdies on the back nine, 
including one on the final hole courtesy of a clutch putt from Olesen. Kjeldsen 
and Olesen closed with a six-under 66 in the best-ball format on Sunday for a 
four-round total of 268.

Fowler and Walker tied for second with China’s Wu Ashun and Li Haotong and 
Frenchmen Victor Dubuisson and Romain Langasque at 272. Australians Marc 
Leishman and Adam Scott saved their best for last, shooting a 65 on Sunday to 
finish in a tie for ninth at 11 under.

“Even daring to dream we’d birdie the whole back nine it wasn’t going to be 
enough,” said Scott, who had paired with Jason Day to win the previous edition 
of the World Cup at Royal Melbourne in 2013. “We needed a faster start.”

All 28 two-man teams shot two under or better on the final day, with the best 
round of 10-under 62 coming from world No9 Alex Noren and fellow Swede David 
Lingmerth. It lifted Sweden to outright fifth on 15-under 273, a shot ahead of 
Italians Francesco Molinari and Matteo Manassero and Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama 
and Ryo Ishikawa.

Kjeldsen and Olesen broke the event wide open with a scintillating 12-under 60 
in the other round of best-ball competition on Friday and were never headed in 
the closing two days. The Danes’ only shaky moment on Sunday came when they 
both bogeyed the par-five eighth hole.
