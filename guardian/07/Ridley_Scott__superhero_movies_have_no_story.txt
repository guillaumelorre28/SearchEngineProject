, Scott, 79, said the genre is “not my kind of thing”.


He said he has turned down several offers. “I can’t believe in the thin, 
gossamer tightrope of the non-reality of the situation of the superhero,” he 
said.


Scott conceded that Blade Runner – the 1982 sci-fi starring Harrison Ford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/harrisonford> – is not wholly dissimilar to 
today’s superhero films, but that it boasted elements that they lack.

“Blade Runner really is a comic strip when you think about it,” he said. “It’s 
a dark story told in an unreal world. You could almost put Batman or Superman 
in that world, that atmosphere, except I’d have a fucking good story, as 
opposed to no story!”


Scott added: “Cinema mainly is pretty bad.”

A sequel to Blade Runner, directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Ryan 
Gosling,is scheduled for release this year

. Scott is currently putting the finishing touches to Alien: Covenant, a 
follow-up to 2013’s Prometheus and a prequel to 1979’s Alien.
