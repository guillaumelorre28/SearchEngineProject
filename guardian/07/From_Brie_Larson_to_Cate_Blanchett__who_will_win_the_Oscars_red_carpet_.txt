Brie Larson

Larson is a really strong contender for the fashion win, mainly because, as 
her stylist Cristina Ehrlichsaid recently 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cristina-ehrlich-brie-larsons-red-860338>
, “Brie has just been such a gift because we’re kind of creating her 
sensibility.” Which means she has neither settled on a look yet, nor has the 
golden handcuffs of a fashion contract.

Hence why, recently, she has fluctuated between a Calvin Klein champagne flute 
of a dress at theGolden Globes 
<http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/73rd-annual-golden-globe-awards-pictured-actress-brie-larson-arrives-picture-id504390276>
 and a sky-blue Versace couture with hiking straps at the Screen Actors Guild 
<http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/brie-larson-attends-the-22nd-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards-at-the-picture-id507612162>
 awards. Her lack of wardrobe baggage means she could go fashion rogue and win. 
Choosing a Saint Laurent gown with some 70s spirit could ricochet her look from 
champagne flute to dirty Martini.

It’s practically a done deal that Vikander will wear Louis Vuitton. The 
Swedish actor was the face of the French fashion house’sspring 2015 campaign 
<http://uk.louisvuitton.com/eng-gb/articles/series-3-the-fall-2015-campaign-with-alicia-vikander>
 and since then has worn designer Nicolas Ghesquière’s gowns to the Baftas, the 
Globes and the SAGs. Luckily for Vikander, Ghesquière is neither pedestrian nor 
predictable in his approach to the red carpet. Having not yet seen next 
season’s Vuitton collection, it’s hard to second guess, but the Vuitton look 
riffs on a futuristic Tron aesthetic, so technical details, acerbic cuts and 
metallics are all likely. If the actor does go off message, then the sighting 
of her stylistVictoria Sekrier <http://www.victoriasekrier.com/> at the Preen 
show at London fashion week could hint she is going for the 
Victorian-gothic-meets-1980s-Tatler vibe.

Mara is an anomaly on the red carpet in that she has a highly developed sense 
of style, one which supersedes the occasion: she doesn’t look like a woman on 
the red carpet, she looks likeRooney Mara on the red carpet 
<http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/actress-rooney-mara-attends-the-weinstein-company-and-netflix-golden-picture-id504439044>
. She has ownership of romantic gothic monochrome ruffles and favours labels 
such as Givenchy, Valentino and McQueen. There is a bit of an Anne Boleyn mood 
within fashion at the moment (just don’t), which could play well for her. 
Failing that, Mara could pull off the Alexander McQueen sequined unicorn dress 
with deadpan authority in a way that few actors could.

2016 catwalk. Composite: EPA/WireImage 
At the Golden Globes, Blanchett delivered a masterclass in left-field cool. On 
most people, pink fringing would be My Little Pony laughable, but Blanchett can 
inject gravitas into off-beat fashion. Givenchy works well for her, but she 
also suits the high-necked governess gowns that are filling the catwalks at the 
moment. Stylist Elizabeth Stewart recently had the actorin British designer 
Erdem 
<https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/39/8a/3a/398a3a5926092f830911578ec84d3416.jpg>
 at a lower voltage Hollywood party – could this have been a trial run for a 
bit of 1930s high-necked lace and flounce by Erdem for the Academy awards? 
Failing that, the actor could be in line to model the as-yet unseen work of the 
much-lauded designer Demna Gvasalia for Balenciaga. Is she does that, she wins 
the unofficial fashion Oscar outright.

spring/summer 2016 catwalk. Composite: Reuters/Rex/Shutterstock 
Recently the actor hasn’t displayed any particular sartorial loyalty to one 
brand. Star Wars premieres were understandably characterised by harder metallic 
wardrobe choices that chimed with the film. Before that, Nyong’o showed a 
preference for block colour on the red carpet; the blue Prada Oscar dress and 
the red Ralph Lauren caped affair were highpoints. But what next? Earlier this 
year, Nyong’o publicly praised her stylist Micaela Erlanger for making fashion 
less daunting. A quiet snoop on Erlanger’sInstagram 
<https://www.instagram.com/micaelaerlanger/?hl=en> account shows a Schiaparelli 
accessory box. Is this a clue? Could Lupita be blazing back into Technicolor 
with a hot-pink pleated Schiaparelli couture number?

Next year, the actor will be free from (what is widely reported to be) a 
three-year, $15m contract with Christian Dior that dictates sheexclusively wears
 
<http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/495658208-actress-jennifer-lawrence-wearing-a-dior-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=X7WJLa88Cweo9HktRLaNXvNBr%2BCbnf8WXMPpmins8Gl5%2FVsc3KJ5qltjFQxD1RHcWaa4Cvw8zbMRIiRuO40l0g%3D%3D>
 the label on the red carpet. Until then, it’s a done deal that she will wear 
Dior. The deal has worked well for her in the past, largely due to the fact 
that the brand’s designer, Raf Simons, has the technical ability to make a 
bandeau neckline look like a minimalist statement rather than socialite snore. 
But, since Simons’s departure four months ago, the label has been without a 
creative director. However, the in-house team are no slouches and Lawrence 
could choose a simple black dress with wonky neckline and pockets from the 
label’s recent couture show and earn points for effortless cool.

She owns the red carpet and, quite frankly, she can do as she pleases. Recent 
awards outings haven’t suggested where she’s at sartorially this year. Navy 
sequins by Tom Ford at the Globes;lime Givenchy 
<http://media.vogue.com/r/c_1,h_4000,w_3280/2015/01/25/Julianne-Moore-sag-awards-red-carpet-2015.jpg>
 at the SAGs; and Armani with a cape for a chilly night at the Baftas. All they 
have in common is a fundamental fabulousness. Moore could slay the red carpet 
field if she strayed from her preferred sharp lines and took on high fashion’s 
most extravagant challenge: the Alessandro Michele for Gucci rainbow-tiered 
1970s gown.
