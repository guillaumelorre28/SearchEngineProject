 * Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> has told 
Donald Trump to “stop whining” as Republicans continued to disown Trump’s 
claims that the US election is “rigged.” “If you start whining before the 
game’s even over, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job, because 
they are a lot of things that don’t go your way,” added Obama, who called for a 
“peaceful transfer of power.”

 * In three crucial states – Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio – the contest 
between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump remains incredibly close, according to 
polling datareleased 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/battleground-polls-2016-elections/> by 
CNN/ORC today. The Clinton campaign seems to be well aware that they have work 
to do if they want to secure these three states, which together areworth

 * Donald Trump’s “election protection” effort will be run by Mike Roman, a 
Republican operative best known forpromoting a video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neGbKHyGuHU&feature=pyv&ad=3265020430&kw=black%20panther>
 of apparent voter intimidation by the New Black Panthers outside a polling 
place in 2008. Roman is to oversee poll-watching efforts as Trump undertakes an 
unprecedented effort by a major party nominee by calling into question the 
legitimacy of the popular vote weeks before election day. The Republican nominee
has insisted, without evidence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-rejects-election-result-before-the-votes-have-been-counted>
, that dead people and undocumented immigrants are voting in the United States.

 * Michael Moore <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michaelmoore> has announced 
the surprise release of a Donald Trump documentary. The Oscar-winning 
film-maker will bring Michael Moore in Trumpland to the big screen with an 
initial New York screening where tickets will be free. The film will then be 
officially released on 19 October. The official description reads as follows: 
“See the film Ohio Republicans tried to shut down. Oscar-winner Michael Moore 
dives right into hostile territory with his daring and hilarious one-man show, 
deep in the heart of TrumpLand in the weeks before the 2016 election.”

proud of Trump’s campaign, Christie said it wasn’t his campaign: 
It’s not my campaign... I’m proud of everything I’ve said. And that’s all I

WikiLeaks, stating it believed he was using it to interfere in the US 
presidential election. The move followed a raft of leaked emails published by
WikiLeaks <https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks>, including some from 
the Democratic National Committee (DNC) released just before the party’s 
convention in July, and more recently a cache of emails from the account of 
Hillary Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta.

Miami Herald, calling Marco Rubio 'a disappointment,' endorses opponent

The largest newspaper in Florida has endorsed Democratic congressman Patrick 
Murphy in his run against Marco Rubio for one of the state’s seats in the US 
Senate, calling Rubio “a disappointment” whose work in the Senate has been 
overshadowed by “issues of sincerity and character” relating to his endorsement 
of Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

“Mr. Trump’s candidacy is a test of character, and Sen. Rubio is failing that 
test,”the Miami Herald’s editorial board wrote 
<http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article109081832.html>. “He 
endorsed Mr. Trump, whom he called a con man during the campaign. And still at 
this late date, he continues to stand by that endorsement, even as the 
Republican candidate stumbles from gaffe to insult to outrage.”

The editorial board also dismissed as cynical Rubio’s citation of the Pulse 
nightclub shooting in Orlando that left 49 people dead as the reason for his 
reentry into the race, noting that Rubio “has a disastrous record as far as 
LGBT issues are concerned, opposing marriage equality and adoption by gay 
parents, and voting against giving LGBT Americans workplace protections.”

Student newspapers at both candidates' alma maters endorse Hillary Clinton

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was launched into 
political activism after she gave a fiery speech during her graduation from 
Wellesley College. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has often cited 
his attendance at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school, as 
evidence of his intelligence.

Fond as the candidates’ memories of their college days may be, however, the 
student newspapers at both schools only have eyes for one of them: Clinton.

Wellesley College. Photograph: Wellesley College Archives/Reuters 
In a rare joint editorial 
<http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/10/wellesley-penn-endorse-hillary-clinton-over-donald-trump>
 published by The Daily Pennsylvanian and the Wellesley News, the opinion 
boards at both college newspapers released an endorsement of Clinton’s 
candidacy, leaning heavily on the Latin mottos of the respective schools.

“Though Clinton embodies her alma mater’s institutional values, Trump does 
not,” the boards concluded. “It is clear that Trump has failed to dignify the 
morals of his institution. Penn’s motto, ‘Leges sine moribus vanae,’ translates 
as ‘Laws without morals [are] useless.’ In evaluatingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> through this context, the 
Opinion Board cannot say that his actions attest to his morals: He does not 
embody the spirit of the school.”

While admitting that “we cannot expect every alumni to personify the values of 
their undergraduate institutions,” the opinion boards conclude that “each 
student, alumni and faculty member is then responsible to critique that 
representation.”

“While the Wellesley News has endorsed its alumna, Hillary Clinton, The Daily 
Pennsylvanian Opinion Board can not stand behind Donald Trump as a candidate.”

Democratic consultant resigns after 'Project Veritas' footage release

The Democratic consultant who has been accused of hiring activists to incite 
violence at Donald Trump’s campaign rallies has announced that he is “stepping 
back” from aiding the Democratic Party,according to CNN 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/project-veritas-action-robert-creamer-donald-trump-rallies/>
.

Robert Creamer announced the move after conservative activist James O’Keefe 
released an edited video in which Creamer was purportedly seen discussing ways 
of disrupting Trump’s rallies with activists aiming to incite violence.

“I am unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing 
Hilary Clinton, and defeatingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in the upcoming election,” 
Creamer said. “As a result I have indicated to the Democratic National 
Committee that I am stepping back from my responsibilities working with the 
campaign.”

Creamer, the husband of Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, denied the 
allegations made in O’Keefe’s video. “Contrary to the outrageous claims of the 
notorious right wing blogger James O’Keefe, we have always adhered to the 
highest standards of transparency and legality in our work for the DNC.”

A self-styled “entrapment journalist,” 
<http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/making-sense-of-news/123188/what-james-okeefe-knows-about-media-and-you-should-know-too/>
 O’Keefe has been accused of selectively editing video footage in the past. In 
March 2013, O’Keefeagreed to pay $100,000 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/08/james-o-keefe-settlement-acorn> 
to settle a lawsuit with a former employee of a social welfare agency who 
accused him of misrepresentation.

Regardless, Creamer said in the statement, he regrets what he characterized as 
“unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations” that took place.

“We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that 
were captured on hidden cameras of a regional contractor for our firm, and he 
is no longer working with us,” Creamer said. “While none of the schemes 
described in the conversations every took place, these conversations do not at 
all reflect the values of Democracy Partners.”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has said he 
would use the US presidency to impose term limits on members of Congress as 
part of a drive to “drain the swamp” of Washington corruption.

Currently, House members can serve an unlimited number of two-year terms, 
while senators can serve an unlimited number of six-year terms. The Republican 
candidate told cheering supporters in Grand Junction,Colorado 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado>, that he would push for a 
constitutional amendment.

“Six years for members of the House and 12 years for members of the Senate,” 
Trump said at the rally in an airplane hangar. “Collusion must and will come to 
an end. It’s time to sweep the corruption out of Washington.”

Trump on Monday issued a five-point plan for “ethics reform” 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-details-ethics-reform-p> in 
government to underline his status as an outsider taking on the political 
establishment, which he claims Hillary Clinton personifies.

The celebrity billionaire’s pledge came as he warmed up for Wednesday’s third 
and final presidential debate with Clinton in Las Vegas, needing a convincing 
performance to change a race that seems to be inexorably slipping away.

Trump also spoke in racially charged terms as he defiantly reiterated his 
warning about potential voting fraud. He urged his supporters to “watch” cities 
with big African American populations on election day to prevent a “rigged” 
election.

“They even want to rig the election at the polling booths,” Trump said. “Take 
a look at St Louis. Take a look at Philadelphia. Take a look at Chicago. Look. 
Look. If nothing else, people are gonna be watching on November 8. Watch St 
Louis. Watch Philadelphia. Watch Chicago.”

The remarks came hours after Barack Obama, himself an African American from 
Chicago,scolded Trump for making the groundless claims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/trump-rigged-election-obama-warning-america-divided>
 that subvert traditions of American democracy, insisting that he had no 
evidence.

Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice told CNN this evening 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/rice-trump-2006-comments/index.html> 
that she “can’t wait until November 9!” after news broke that Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump called her a “bitch” in a 2006 speech.

“Condoleezza Rice, she’s a lovely woman, but I think she’s a bitch,” Trump 
said at the time, according to a story in the New York Daily News from 2006, 
initiallyresurfaced by Deadspin 
<http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/remember-when-donald-trump-called-condoleezza-rice-a-bi-1787927813>
. “She goes around to other countries and other nations, negotiates with their 
leaders, comes back and nothing ever happens.”

Asked to respond to the comments, Rice said: “Exactly. Can’t wait until 
November 9!”

Rice disavowed Trump’s presidential run after video was released showing him 
brag about sexually assaulting women in a 2005 conversation with an 
entertainment journalist.

Trump Super Pac chair: Trump needs 'a miracle' to win the election

The head of the largest pro-Donald Trump Super Pac told a radio host today 
that the Republican presidential nominee needs “a miracle comeback” to win the 
upcoming presidential election, a departure from the triumphant confidence 
exuded by the candidate himself on the campaign trail in recent weeks.

“If somehow Trump pulls a miracle comeback here, which would take a miracle at 
this point, then obviously it’s his party, he can do what he wants with it,” Ed 
Rollins, the chair of Great America Pac, told Laura Ingraham on her radio show. 
“If not, I think we begin from ground zero and with lots of different factions 
and lots of different candidates.”

Ecuador confirms it cut internet access for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange

Nicky Woolf

Ecuador has confirmed 
<https://twitter.com/MFAEcuador/status/788511494296272896> that it cut off 
internet access to Julian Assange, the founder of the whistleblowing site 
WikiLeaks, stating it believed he was using it to interfere in the US 
presidential election.


The move followed a raft of leaked emails published by WikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks>, including some from the 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) released just before the party’s convention 
in July, and more recently a cache of emails from the account of Hillary 
Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta.

Assange’s internet access was cut off on Monday morning. It was not 
immediately clear who was responsible, though a tweet from the site’s official 
account claimed it had been “intentionally severed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/17/ecuador-julian-assange-internet-access-wikileaks>
” by a “state party”.

It is not known who perpetrated the hacks that brought the emails to 
WikiLeaks. Assange’s organization styles itself a whistleblowing outfit and 
claims not to do or encourage any hacking itself.


Yet cybersecurity experts have linked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/russian-dnc-hack-donald-trump-files-us-election>
 the hack of the DNC emails to hackers linked to the Russian government, 
leading many – including Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook –to allege 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/politics/robby-mook-russia-dnc-emails-trump/> 
that Russia is using both hackers and Assange as tools to help rig the 
presidential election in favour of Donald Trump.
WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) 
Julian Assange's internet link has been intentionally severed by a state 
party. We have activated the appropriate contingency plans.

A clip from The Howard Stern Show, obtained by the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/14/new-clips-show-trump-talking-about-sex-rating-womens-bodies-reminiscing-about-infidelity-on-howard-stern-show/>
, shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump relaying a story from his 
seldom-discussed affair with Marla Maples (later Trump) during his first 
marriage to Ivana Trump, the mother of his three eldest children:

“This is a story I’ve never told about that mountain, because it was sort of a 
horrible thing,” Trump said in the tape, about a fight between Maples and Ivana 
on a ski slope during the waning days of his first marriage.

“I’m standing there putting on my skis, and I’m with one or the other, I 
didn’t know who,” Trump said, referring to one of the two women. “And the other 
one comes over, and they start screaming at each other. ‘I love him! I love 
him! Don’t you understand! I love!’ And they’re both screaming that I love 
them.”

“And this big fat bald guy is standing next to me,” Trump continues. “Guy 
weighs like 325 pounds, and I’m standing there mortified. Everybody’s looking, 
like a thousand people watching these two women screaming at each other, and 
this big fat guy is looking at me and he said, ‘Mr. Trump, that’s not the worst 
thing that could happen. I have never had a thing like that happen in my life.’ 
And I see this guy and I think, ‘You know, maybe this could be worse.’”

Debate notifications: reactions and fact-checks straight to your phone

During the final presidential debate on Wednesday, 19 October, the Guardian 
Mobile Innovation Lab <https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab>, 
along with the Guardian US Opinion and News desks will send experimental web 
notifications with real-time reactions and live fact-checks from the Guardian 
US newsroom.
 Tomorrow! Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images 
To sign up: Open this page <https://www.gdnmobilelab.com/third-debate/> in a 
Chrome browser from an Android phone (Samsung included) and tap to subscribe.

What you should know about our notifications:

 * They’re currently only available on Chrome on Android devices. 
 * They’re meant for mobile but will also work on desktop Chrome browsers, too.

 * They supplement the news alerts sent from the Guardian’s Android and iOS 
apps. 
More about tonight’s experiment:

 * The notifications are supposed to make it easy for you to keep listening to 
what the candidates and moderators are saying during the debate, while 
providing easy and convenient access to analysis, fact-checks and reactions 
from our experts on your phone throughout the night. 
 * We’ll send three alerts. Each will auto-update on your lockscreen with the 
following: 
 * Reactions from Guardian opinion editor David Shariatmadari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidshariatmadari> and commentatorKate 
Aronoff <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-aronoff>. We’ll send their 
quick takes about the candidates’ policy statements, their debating styles, and 
who’s winning and who’s losing. 
 * Fact-check alerts for each of the two candidates, by Guardian reporter Alan 
Yuhas <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alan-yuhas>. The notifications will 
be color coded to indicate the degree of accuracy of the candidates’ statements.
 * This project is the latest installment in ongoing experimentation with 
notifications, part of theMobile Lab’s mission 
<https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab> to learn more about 
mobile storytelling. After the experiment, we’ll send out a survey soliciting 
feedback on the experience.

How do you one-up bringing Bill Clinton’s accusers to the second presidential

Malik Obama, the president’s half-brother, reportedly

 stopped supporting the Democratic Party - a moot point since he’s not a US 
citizen and cannot vote, as it happens - when Obama (the president) came out in 
support of same-sex marriage rights.

Donald Trump calls for three-term limit on House of Representatives, two-term 
limit on Senate

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has outlined his proposed 
term limits for members of Congress, telling a crowd of supporters in Grand 
Junction, Colorado, that under the constitutional amendment he envisions, 
members of the House of Representatives will be limited to serving six years, 
or three terms, while members of the Senate will be limited to serving twelve 
years, or two terms.

“Six years for members of the House and twelve years for members of the 
Senate,” Trump told the cheering crowd. “Collusion must and will come to an 
end. It’s time to sweep the corruption out of Washington.”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> continued, 
pledging a ban on former lawmakers becoming lobbyists for five years, telling 
his supporters in Colorado that he wants to “drain the damn swamp” in the 
nation’s capital.

“Her international donors control her every single move,” Trump said, of 
Hillary Clinton’s “rigged” campaign. “If we let the Clinton cartel run this 
government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its 
independence. It’s true.”

“When it comes to Washington, DC, it is time to drain the damn swamp.”

Speaking in Grand Junction, Colorado, Republican presidential nominee Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> urged his supporters to 
“watch” cities with large African-American populations on election day to 
prevent a “rigged” election.

“They even want to rig the election at the polling booths,” Trump said. “Take 
a look at St. Louis. Take a look at Philadelphia. Take a look at Chicago.”

“Look. Look. If nothing else, people are gonna be watching on November 8. 
Watch St. Louis. Watch Philadelphia. Watch Chicago.”

 * Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> has told 
Donald Trump to “stop whining” as Republicans continued to disown Trump’s 
claims that the US election is “rigged.” “If you start whining before the 
game’s even over, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job, because 
they are a lot of things that don’t go your way,” added Obama, who called for a 
“peaceful transfer of power.”

between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump remains incredibly close, according to 
polling datareleased 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/battleground-polls-2016-elections/> by 
CNN/ORC today. The Clinton campaign seems to be well aware that they have work

Republican operative best known forpromoting a video

 of apparent voter intimidation by the New Black Panthers outside a polling 
place in 2008. Roman is to oversee poll-watching efforts as Trump undertakes an 
unprecedented effort by a major party nominee by calling into question the 
legitimacy of the popular vote weeks before election day. The Republican nominee
has insisted, without evidence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-rejects-election-result-before-the-votes-have-been-counted>
, that dead people and undocumented immigrants are voting in the United States.

 * Michael Moore <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michaelmoore> has announced 
the surprise release of a Donald Trump documentary. The Oscar-winning 
film-maker will bring Michael Moore in Trumpland to the big screen with an 
initial New York screening where tickets will be free. The film will then be 
officially released on 19 October. The official description reads as follows: 
“See the film Ohio Republicans tried to shut down. Oscar-winner Michael Moore 
dives right into hostile territory with his daring and hilarious one-man show, 
deep in the heart of TrumpLand in the weeks before the 2016 election.”

The largest newspaper in Florida has endorsed Democratic congressman Patrick 
Murphy in his run against Marco Rubio for one of the state’s seats in the US 
Senate, calling Rubio “a disappointment” whose work in the Senate has been 
overshadowed by “issues of sincerity and character” relating to his endorsement 
of Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

“Mr. Trump’s candidacy is a test of character, and Sen. Rubio is failing that 
test,”the Miami Herald’s editorial board wrote 
<http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article109081832.html>. “He 
endorsed Mr. Trump, whom he called a con man during the campaign. And still at 
this late date, he continues to stand by that endorsement, even as the 
Republican candidate stumbles from gaffe to insult to outrage.”

The editorial board also dismissed as cynical Rubio’s citation of the Pulse 
nightclub shooting in Orlando that left 49 people dead as the reason for his 
reentry into the race, noting that Rubio “has a disastrous record as far as 
LGBT issues are concerned, opposing marriage equality and adoption by gay 
parents, and voting against giving LGBT Americans workplace protections.”
 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was launched into 
political activism after she gave a fiery speech during her graduation from 
Wellesley College. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has often cited 
his attendance at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school, as 
evidence of his intelligence.

Fond as the candidates’ memories of their college days may be, however, the 
student newspapers at both schools only have eyes for one of them: Clinton.

Wellesley College. Photograph: Wellesley College Archives/Reuters 
In a rare joint editorial 
<http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/10/wellesley-penn-endorse-hillary-clinton-over-donald-trump>
 published by The Daily Pennsylvanian and the Wellesley News, the opinion 
boards at both college newspapers released an endorsement of Clinton’s 
candidacy, leaning heavily on the Latin mottos of the respective schools.

“Though Clinton embodies her alma mater’s institutional values, Trump does 
not,” the boards concluded. “It is clear that Trump has failed to dignify the 
morals of his institution. Penn’s motto, ‘Leges sine moribus vanae,’ translates 
as ‘Laws without morals [are] useless.’ In evaluatingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> through this context, the 
Opinion Board cannot say that his actions attest to his morals: He does not 
embody the spirit of the school.”

While admitting that “we cannot expect every alumni to personify the values of 
their undergraduate institutions,” the opinion boards conclude that “each 
student, alumni and faculty member is then responsible to critique that 
representation.”

“While the Wellesley News has endorsed its alumna, Hillary Clinton, The Daily 
Pennsylvanian Opinion Board can not stand behind Donald Trump as a candidate.”
 
The Democratic consultant who has been accused of hiring activists to incite 
violence at Donald Trump’s campaign rallies has announced that he is “stepping 
back” from aiding the Democratic Party,according to CNN 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/project-veritas-action-robert-creamer-donald-trump-rallies/>
.

Robert Creamer announced the move after conservative activist James O’Keefe 
released an edited video in which Creamer was purportedly seen discussing ways 
of disrupting Trump’s rallies with activists aiming to incite violence.

“I am unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing 
Hilary Clinton, and defeatingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in the upcoming election,” 
Creamer said. “As a result I have indicated to the Democratic National 
Committee that I am stepping back from my responsibilities working with the 
campaign.”

Creamer, the husband of Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, denied the 
allegations made in O’Keefe’s video. “Contrary to the outrageous claims of the 
notorious right wing blogger James O’Keefe, we have always adhered to the 
highest standards of transparency and legality in our work for the DNC.”

A self-styled “entrapment journalist,” 
<http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/making-sense-of-news/123188/what-james-okeefe-knows-about-media-and-you-should-know-too/>
 O’Keefe has been accused of selectively editing video footage in the past. In 
March 2013, O’Keefeagreed to pay $100,000 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/08/james-o-keefe-settlement-acorn> 
to settle a lawsuit with a former employee of a social welfare agency who 
accused him of misrepresentation.

Regardless, Creamer said in the statement, he regrets what he characterized as 
“unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations” that took place.

“We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that 
were captured on hidden cameras of a regional contractor for our firm, and he 
is no longer working with us,” Creamer said. “While none of the schemes 
described in the conversations every took place, these conversations do not at 
all reflect the values of Democracy Partners.”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has said he 
would use the US presidency to impose term limits on members of Congress as 
part of a drive to “drain the swamp” of Washington corruption.

Currently, House members can serve an unlimited number of two-year terms, 
while senators can serve an unlimited number of six-year terms. The Republican 
candidate told cheering supporters in Grand Junction,Colorado 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado>, that he would push for a 
constitutional amendment.

“Six years for members of the House and 12 years for members of the Senate,” 
Trump said at the rally in an airplane hangar. “Collusion must and will come to 
an end. It’s time to sweep the corruption out of Washington.”

Trump on Monday issued a five-point plan for “ethics reform” 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-details-ethics-reform-p> in 
government to underline his status as an outsider taking on the political 
establishment, which he claims Hillary Clinton personifies.

The celebrity billionaire’s pledge came as he warmed up for Wednesday’s third 
and final presidential debate with Clinton in Las Vegas, needing a convincing 
performance to change a race that seems to be inexorably slipping away.

Trump also spoke in racially charged terms as he defiantly reiterated his 
warning about potential voting fraud. He urged his supporters to “watch” cities 
with big African American populations on election day to prevent a “rigged” 
election.

“They even want to rig the election at the polling booths,” Trump said. “Take 
a look at St Louis. Take a look at Philadelphia. Take a look at Chicago. Look. 
Look. If nothing else, people are gonna be watching on November 8. Watch St 
Louis. Watch Philadelphia. Watch Chicago.”

The remarks came hours after Barack Obama, himself an African American from 
Chicago,scolded Trump for making the groundless claims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/trump-rigged-election-obama-warning-america-divided>
 that subvert traditions of American democracy, insisting that he had no 
evidence.

Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice told CNN this evening 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/rice-trump-2006-comments/index.html> 
that she “can’t wait until November 9!” after news broke that Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump called her a “bitch” in a 2006 speech.

“Condoleezza Rice, she’s a lovely woman, but I think she’s a bitch,” Trump 
said at the time, according to a story in the New York Daily News from 2006, 
initiallyresurfaced by Deadspin 
<http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/remember-when-donald-trump-called-condoleezza-rice-a-bi-1787927813>
. “She goes around to other countries and other nations, negotiates with their 
leaders, comes back and nothing ever happens.”

Asked to respond to the comments, Rice said: “Exactly. Can’t wait until 
November 9!”

Rice disavowed Trump’s presidential run after video was released showing him 
brag about sexually assaulting women in a 2005 conversation with an 
entertainment journalist.
 
The head of the largest pro-Donald Trump Super Pac told a radio host today 
that the Republican presidential nominee needs “a miracle comeback” to win the 
upcoming presidential election, a departure from the triumphant confidence 
exuded by the candidate himself on the campaign trail in recent weeks.

“If somehow Trump pulls a miracle comeback here, which would take a miracle at 
this point, then obviously it’s his party, he can do what he wants with it,” Ed 
Rollins, the chair of Great America Pac, told Laura Ingraham on her radio show. 
“If not, I think we begin from ground zero and with lots of different factions 
and lots of different candidates.”

 
Ecuador has confirmed 
<https://twitter.com/MFAEcuador/status/788511494296272896> that it cut off 
internet access to Julian Assange, the founder of the whistleblowing site 
WikiLeaks, stating it believed he was using it to interfere in the US 
presidential election.


The move followed a raft of leaked emails published by WikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks>, including some from the 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) released just before the party’s convention 
in July, and more recently a cache of emails from the account of Hillary 
Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta.

Assange’s internet access was cut off on Monday morning. It was not 
immediately clear who was responsible, though a tweet from the site’s official 
account claimed it had been “intentionally severed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/17/ecuador-julian-assange-internet-access-wikileaks>
” by a “state party”.

It is not known who perpetrated the hacks that brought the emails to 
WikiLeaks. Assange’s organization styles itself a whistleblowing outfit and 
claims not to do or encourage any hacking itself.


Yet cybersecurity experts have linked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/russian-dnc-hack-donald-trump-files-us-election>
 the hack of the DNC emails to hackers linked to the Russian government, 
leading many – including Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook –to allege 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/politics/robby-mook-russia-dnc-emails-trump/> 
that Russia is using both hackers and Assange as tools to help rig the 
presidential election in favour of Donald Trump.

, shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump relaying a story from his 
seldom-discussed affair with Marla Maples (later Trump) during his first 
marriage to Ivana Trump, the mother of his three eldest children:

“This is a story I’ve never told about that mountain, because it was sort of a 
horrible thing,” Trump said in the tape, about a fight between Maples and Ivana 
on a ski slope during the waning days of his first marriage.

“I’m standing there putting on my skis, and I’m with one or the other, I 
didn’t know who,” Trump said, referring to one of the two women. “And the other 
one comes over, and they start screaming at each other. ‘I love him! I love 
him! Don’t you understand! I love!’ And they’re both screaming that I love 
them.”

“And this big fat bald guy is standing next to me,” Trump continues. “Guy 
weighs like 325 pounds, and I’m standing there mortified. Everybody’s looking, 
like a thousand people watching these two women screaming at each other, and 
this big fat guy is looking at me and he said, ‘Mr. Trump, that’s not the worst 
thing that could happen. I have never had a thing like that happen in my life.’ 
And I see this guy and I think, ‘You know, maybe this could be worse.’”

apps. 
More about tonight’s experiment:

 * The notifications are supposed to make it easy for you to keep listening to 
what the candidates and moderators are saying during the debate, while 
providing easy and convenient access to analysis, fact-checks and reactions 
from our experts on your phone throughout the night. 
 * We’ll send three alerts. Each will auto-update on your lockscreen with the 
following: 
 * Reactions from Guardian opinion editor David Shariatmadari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidshariatmadari> and commentatorKate 
Aronoff <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-aronoff>. We’ll send their 
quick takes about the candidates’ policy statements, their debating styles, and 
who’s winning and who’s losing. 
 * Fact-check alerts for each of the two candidates, by Guardian reporter Alan 
Yuhas <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alan-yuhas>. The notifications will 
be color coded to indicate the degree of accuracy of the candidates’ statements.
 * This project is the latest installment in ongoing experimentation with 
notifications, part of theMobile Lab’s mission 
<https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab> to learn more about 
mobile storytelling. After the experiment, we’ll send out a survey soliciting 
feedback on the experience.

How do you one-up bringing Bill Clinton’s accusers to the second presidential 
debate? By bringing President Barack Obama’s Kenyan half-brother to the third 
presidential debate.

Malik Obama, the president’s half-brother, reportedly 
<http://nypost.com/2016/07/24/why-obamas-half-brother-says-hell-be-voting-for-donald-trump/>
 stopped supporting the Democratic Party - a moot point since he’s not a US 
citizen and cannot vote, as it happens - when Obama (the president) came out in 
support of same-sex marriage rights.
 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has outlined his proposed 
term limits for members of Congress, telling a crowd of supporters in Grand 
Junction, Colorado, that under the constitutional amendment he envisions, 
members of the House of Representatives will be limited to serving six years, 
or three terms, while members of the Senate will be limited to serving twelve 
years, or two terms.

“Six years for members of the House and twelve years for members of the 
Senate,” Trump told the cheering crowd. “Collusion must and will come to an 
end. It’s time to sweep the corruption out of Washington.”
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> continued, 
pledging a ban on former lawmakers becoming lobbyists for five years, telling 
his supporters in Colorado that he wants to “drain the damn swamp” in the 
nation’s capital.

“Her international donors control her every single move,” Trump said, of 
Hillary Clinton’s “rigged” campaign. “If we let the Clinton cartel run this 
government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its 
independence. It’s true.”

“When it comes to Washington, DC, it is time to drain the damn swamp.”
 
Speaking in Grand Junction, Colorado, Republican presidential nominee Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> urged his supporters to 
“watch” cities with large African-American populations on election day to 
prevent a “rigged” election.

“They even want to rig the election at the polling booths,” Trump said. “Take 
a look at St. Louis. Take a look at Philadelphia. Take a look at Chicago.”

“Look. Look. If nothing else, people are gonna be watching on November 8. 
Watch St. Louis. Watch Philadelphia. Watch Chicago.”
