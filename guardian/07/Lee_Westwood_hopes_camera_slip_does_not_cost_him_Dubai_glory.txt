Should Lee Westwood’s bid to claim the DP World Tour Championship

 fall short by a stroke, there is no doubt about where the Englishman’s 
analysis will focus.

When playing a relatively simple shot from the fairway of the 18th hole during 
round two, Westwood was tied for the lead. Cue the interventions of an errant 
camera shutter, which proved sufficient to distract the 43-year-old during his 
backswing. Westwood duly found a water hazard, made a bogey six and trails the 
halfway leaders by one.

“Somebody clicked a camera on the right-hand side and that put me off,” 
Westwood said after signing for his 70 and aggregate of nine under. “It 
happens. You just have to regroup. What else are you going to do?” The answer, 
of course, would be to rant and rave, which is not Westwood’s style.

Francesco Molinari and Sergio García 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sergio-garcia> are the men at the head of 
proceedings. Both made second rounds of 67, including identical nines of 33 and 
34.

“I guess I’m a little bit fresher than the guys that have been playing the 
last three or four weeks,” García said on his return from a competitive break.

“I’m excited about the weekend. It’s good to be out there with a chance in the 
last tournament of the year. I just want to make sure that I keep playing the 
same way I’ve played these first two days and see where that takes us.”

Molinari is seeking a double celebration after his brother, Edoardo, earned a 
full‑time place back on the European Tour via qualifying school on Thursday.

Given course specialism, it would be unwise to discount Rory McIlroy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy> despite a position of eight 
shots from the lead. The Northern Irishman bounced back from a round of 75 on 
Thursday with a 68. “I just mentally was very flat during that first round,” 
McIlroy said.

“I’d say I was in holiday mode. I hadn’t quite switched on to what I needed to 
do. It was just a bad day. I sort of turned it around today and hopefully I can 
improve again over the weekend.

“I’ve shot some really good scores here in the past. If I can emulate that and 
shoot a couple of really good ones over the weekend, I’d be happy enough going 
into the break.”

The wider battle, for the European Tour’s order-of-merit crown, remains 
closely fought.Henrik Stenson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/henrik-stenson>
, the leader, is tied with second-placed Danny Willett at three under par with 
36 holes to play.

Stenson had an interesting Friday, hitting a spectator with an errant iron 
shot having earlier watched a marshal pick up his ball when it was clearly 
still in play. “I don’t know why anyone that enters a golf tournament is 
picking up a golf ball inside the ropes,” Stenson said.

“That seems a bit weird to me. But it happens, unfortunately. I had to call 
for a ruling, then we estimated where it was supposed to be and dropped it 
there and on we go.

“Unfortunately I hit a lady and she went down. But I had some reports later in 
the round that she was doing OK. Of course, you get shocked when you get hit 
like that and it’s painful. I’m just making sure that we’re going to get her 
details so I can send her something nice.”
