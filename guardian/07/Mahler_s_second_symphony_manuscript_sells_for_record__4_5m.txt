It was the ideal Christmas gift for someone with several million spare pounds 
and a love of Mahler: the complete manuscript of the composer’s second symphony 
– known as the Resurrection – was up for auction at Sotheby’s in London on 
Tuesday morning.

The buyer had to part with a record price for a music manuscript, paying 
£4,546,250 for the 232-page document. Sotheby’s said it was “the most 
significant musical manuscript ever to have been offered at auction”, noting 
that the only comparable symphonic manuscripts to have been sold at auction 
were those of nine Mozart symphonies (which sold for £2.5m at Sotheby’s in 
1987) and Schumann’s second symphony (£1.5m in 1994).

“No complete symphony by Mahler, written in the composer’s own hand, has ever 
been offered at auction, and probably none will be offered again,” said Simon 
Maguire, Sotheby’s senior specialist in books and manuscripts.

The Mahler manuscript is unaltered since it was first set down by the 
composer, including his own deletions, alterations and annotations.

The manuscript was sold by the estate of Gilbert Kaplan, an American economist 
and businessman, who became obsessed with the Resurrection symphony after 
seeing it performed at Carnegie Hall in New York in 1965, and it became a dream 
for him to conduct the piece.

Kaplan began learning conducting in 1981, and went on to conduct the symphony 
in more than 100 performances. He conducted two recordings of the work, with 
the London Symphony Orchestra in 1987 and the Vienna Philharmonic in 2002. He 
also established the Kaplan foundation, dedicated to Mahler scholarship and 
promoting the composer’s work.

David Finlayson, a trombonist who took part in the New York Philharmonic’s 
2008 performance of the work under Kaplan,took a dim view of the amateur 
conductor 
<http://davidfinlayson.typepad.com/fin_notes/2008/12/some-words-about-gilbert-kaplan.html>
. “As a conductor, he can best be described as a very poor beater of time who 
far too often is unable to keep the ensemble together and allows most tempo 
transitions to fall where they may,” he wrote.

“His direction lacks few indications of dynamic control or balance and there 
is absolutely no attempt to give phrases any requisite shape. In rehearsal, he 
admitted to our orchestra that he is not capable of keeping a steady tempo and 
that he would have to depend on us for any stability in that department. 
Considering his Everest-sized ego, this admission must have caused him great 
consternation upon reflection … Mr Kaplan and his assault on conducting leave 
many musicians angry, bewildered and befuddled.”

Others, however, defended Kaplan. The writer Norman Lebrecht 
<http://slippedisc.com/2008/12/the_player_who_forgot_his_plac/>, who attended 
the performance, wrote: “Having watched him master the work over almost 25 
years, I am convinced – and so are many musicians – that no one alive has such 
detailed knowledge of the score … There were rhythms in the second and third 
movements that he delivered more idiomatically and true to score than I have 
heard from most professionals. The performance as a whole achieved its intended 
catharsis – and if the New York Philharmonic think they can do that without a 
conductor, as the trombonist suggests, well, let’s see them try.”
