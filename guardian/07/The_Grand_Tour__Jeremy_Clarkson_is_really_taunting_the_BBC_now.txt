Jeremy Clarkson <https://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremyclarkson> sported a 
large scab on the side of his nose in this week’s episode of The Grand Tour. It 
was never explained whether it was the result of a stunt or a supper order gone 
wrong. But, of the three episodes in Clarkson’s comeback released so far, this 
one seemed most intent on giving the BBC a bloody nose.

One of the freedoms Clarkson and his producer Andy Wilman have in their new 
travelling home – this week, they pitched their studio tent in Whitby – is that 
episodes can vary in length: the third was 62 minutes, up from 57 in the second 
but significantly down from the 71 of theironline debut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/18/the-grand-tour-review-jeremy-clarkson-james-may-richard-hammond-leave-the-bbc-in-their-dust>
.

But the latest episode would struggle to fill even a half-hour slot on the 
BBC, once it had been shown to the Head of Editorial Compliance. Challenged by 
Hammond and May for using the word “prick-teaser” about BMW, Clarkson perkily 
offers “cock-teaser” as a substitute. The description of part of a dashboard 
resembling “a lady part” would surely have been deleted at his old address. 
Much scrutiny, too, would be given to the trio’s expensive watches seen 
prominently on steering wheels. (“Episodes contain product placement,” warns 
the Amazon Prime website.)

This instalment also contained a gag that seemed openly aimed at the failure 
of the BBC’s replacement Top Gear. During a sequence filmed in Italy, Hammond 
was obsessed with doing “doughnuts”, dirtily circling a car in a Florence 
square and later doing ovals in a speedboat in Venice lagoon while Clarkson and 
May look on, horrified, from a gondola.

One of the first of many crises that engulfed the post-Clarkson Top Gear was 
accusations of “disrespect” after Matt LeBlanc drove spheres of burnt rubber 
into a road close to the Cenotaph in London. The decision byChris Evans to 
publicly disassociate himself from the sequence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/chris-evans-top-gear-cenotaph-bbc-matt-leblanc>
 seemed to create tensions between the two, a perception that helped to crash 
the franchise.

At first sight, the wheelie stunts in The Grand Tour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-grand-tour> look like a bid to 
culturally out-vandalise LeBlanc. Hammond seems to be scorching the stone 
directly outside the Uffizi gallery, and surging through Venetian waters that 
are a UNESCO World Heritage site. Careful viewing, though, suggests that 
skilful filming and editing have been used to confuse viewers about what they 
are really seeing.

One of the difficulties the Clarkson-Wilman Top Gear faced at the BBC was that 
– following a series of scandals on other shows about editorial deceits – all 
programmes were held to factual standards that had previously been applied to 
news and documentary. This hampered Clarkson, Hammond and May, who had always 
employed elements of misleading, teasing and even fiction.

On The Grand Tour, the team is again allowed to be playful with form and 
facts, in the way Top Gear once was. If Amazon Originals even has a Head of 
Editorial Compliance, they seem to be no more bothered than most viewers about 
whether Hammond and May really are destroying Clarkson’s house with bulldozers 
(a pay-off from a bet in show one), or that a scene in which the other two are 
trying to strand Hammond at a hotel is clearly scripted.

So much does The Grand Tour stray into drama that the presenters’ Italian job 
was based on the premise of Clarkson (whose career is built on being a man of 
the people) being a culture vulture whose desire for opera and art in Tuscany 
is thwarted by Hammond’s vulgar tastes. But Clarko’s sophistication didn’t 
prevent himaccidentally going to see an opera that he believed to be called Car 
Men, and therefore up his street.

Such creative licence still leaves space for proper motoring journalism: they 
mock the Rolls-Royce brochure that describes the removal of its convertible’s 
roof as a “silent ballet”, and Clarkson suggests that the boasted extra 
head-room in a VW SV makes it “like a Golf but for people who have stovepipe 
hats.” Few factual shows pay such attention to language.

Regardless of how many new online shoppers The Grand Tour may have attracted 
to top up Amazon’s tax-lite profits 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/28/the-grand-tour-viewing-figures-are-a-mystery-to-us-say-shows-stars>
, this is a television event. Many will flinch as Clarkson progressively tests 
his claim in programme one that “this is on the internet – I can’t be sacked.” 
But The Grand Tour is inventive, expensive, authoritative programme-making that 
is luxuriating in fresh editorial freedom.

If something needs to be looked at in future, it’s the structure. It seemed 
odd this week that the base location of Whitby was used almost entirely as a 
movie theatre for the Italian job. Stranger still was no mention of the fact 
that Whitby is a key location in Bram Stoker’s Dracula – possibly because the 
main character reacts even more violently than Clarkson once did when struck by 
hunger.
