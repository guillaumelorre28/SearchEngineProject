Pantone, the Nate Silver of colour, has revealed its predicted shade for 2017. 
Given our inability to foresee how2016 would pan out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/22/donald-trump-wont-win-republican-presidential-nomination>
, making any prediction about 2017 feels dangerously dicey, even if it is only 
about a colour. Still, seeing as last year’s shade was in fact two –rose quartz 
and baby blue

 – which could have alluded to the division and confusion thrown up by the 
seismic events of the past 12 months, maybe we should take note.

Pantone puts its prediction down to the “hope we collectively yearn for amid a 
complex social and political landscape”, but fashion has long claimed greenery 
as its idea. Balenciaga put it on the catwalk, on Lotta Volkova, forSS17 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-ready-to-wear/balenciaga/slideshow/collection#20>
. Oscar de la Renta looked to the colour for its most recent collection, as did 
US Vogue, prophetically styling Ruth Negga in a greenery-printed Alexander Wang 
shirt in front of an off-greenery backdrop for the January cover. Curiously, 
Katy Perry, Kylie Jenner and Lena Dunham all recently dyed their hair this 
shade, too, and lest we forget, Skoda showed a bright green car at their 2017 
launch. In the same vein then, 2017 could see canals having a crap time (it’s 
not far off duck-weed-green) and sushi have a second wind – greenery is akin to 
the colour wasabi. Ditto Nando’s (greenery is the colour of macho peas) andEvil 
Kermit

, already frontrunner for meme of 2016. It’s also worth noting what happens to 
Waitrose and Matcha tea (middle classes, this could be your time to shine) and 
The Weeknd, who has a greenery light cast on his face in the video for Starboy.

After a decade of going off-piste – see marsala and a shade of yellow marketed 
alongside the Despicable Me franchise – greenery is natural in comparison. It 
was among the colours adopted by the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 
60s and 70s. If it is about hope and the environment and peace, then it is 
little more than an open goal in marketing. But –but – if those things do come 
to pass, if things do get better, remember what Pantone said, rather than 
Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.
