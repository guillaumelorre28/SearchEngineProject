By threatening the government with legal action over a new Heathrow runway (
Report

, 11 October), Theresa May’s local council will be at odds with most MPs and 
many of its own residents and businesses. Windsor and Maidenhead council claims 
it was elected on a mandate to oppose expansion, but local taxpayers have not 
given the council permission to hand over tens of thousands to expensive 
lawyers. Many would prefer their hard-earned cash to be spent on creating local 
jobs, not preventing them.

• Denigrating the role of the British prime minister to that of clothes horse 
for high fashion is not just sexist (Personal political broadcast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/10/theresa-mays-wardrobe-decoding-her-brand-management>
, G2, 11 October); such focus on female appearance is a needless distraction 
from the increasingly damaging rightwing policies of the Tory government.

• Is it just me who thinks the looks and mannerisms of our prime minister are 
reminiscent of that great character actressMargaret Rutherford

• Clint Backhouse claims that golf clubs are a likely home for “locker room 
banter” of a particular type (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/alpha-male-trump-could-herald-republican-split>
, 12 October). I am a member of two golf clubs and my experience does not 
reflect his suggestion. A typical attempt at banter would be to ridicule me for 
being a Guardian reader.

• What’s all this fuss about Shami Chakrabarti sending her son to private 
school (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/09/shami-chakrabarti-grammar-schools-segragation-theresa-may-11-plus>
, 10 October)? Surely as the ex-chairperson of Liberty, she’s free to do what 
she likes.

• I wholeheartedly agree with Bruce Kent (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/michael-fallons-cadets-should-learn-when-to-disobey-orders>
, 12 October) on Michael Fallon’s plan for 150 more school cadet corps. But has 
Mr Fallon ever watched Lindsay Anderson’s If?
