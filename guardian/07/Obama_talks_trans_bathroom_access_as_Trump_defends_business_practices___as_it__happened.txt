Today in Campaign 2016

Here are the highlights from today in campaign news:


 * Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump a “fraud” who would “scam America like 
he scammed all those people at Trump University,” the Republican’s defunct 
for-profit business school that is the subject of a federal lawsuit. The 
Democratic frontrunner, who was in New Jersey campaigning ahead of the state’s 
7 June primary, trained her fire on Trump the day after a court ordered the 
release of testimony in the university case. “This election will determine what 
direction this country heads in and there could not be a more stark and 
important difference because every day we learn more and more about Donald 
Trump,” Clinton said at a rally in Rutgers University. 
 * Some of the harshest critics of Trump University have been revealed to be 
former employees of the now-defunct university majority-owned by the 
presumptive Republican presidential nominee.In sworn testimony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/trump-university-staff-testimony-fraudulent-scheme>
, three former staff members have described the real estate school as “a 
facade, a total lie” and a “fraudulent scheme” that “preyed upon the elderly 
and uneducated to separate them from their money.” 
 * A new poll of a hypothetical general-election matchup between Trump and 
Clinton aligns roughly with recent polling awarding a slight edge to the former 
secretary of state, while exposing a stark gender gap that could represent the 
most forbidding obstacle standing between Trump and the presidency. Women 
preferred Clinton to Trump 54-30in the poll 
<https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2352>
, conducted by Quinnipiac University from 24 to 30 May. Men went for Trump to a 
slightly lesser degree, 51-35. With women expected to make up as much as 54% of 
the electorate in November, Trump’s challenge is to display either a greater 
lead on Clinton among men – or to correct his numbers with women. Women both 
constitute more than half the US voting population and aremore likely to vote 
<http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/genderdiff.pdf> than 
men. 
 * The presumptive Republican nominee has announced he is to visit the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-announces-uk-visit-turnberry-golf-resort-britain>
 on the day after the country votes on whether to remain in the EU. Trump’s 
announcement throws up the question of whetherDavid Cameron will meet him, as 
the visit comes the day the result of the EU referendum is declared –a vote 
some polls suggest the prime minister faces losing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/uk-voters-leaning-towards-brexit-guardian-poll-reveals>
.

 * Barack Obama made his most aggressive foray yet into the battle to succeed 
him, warning that Trump - although he wouldn’t say his name - would serve the 
interests of his fellow billionaires and heighten the risk of another financial 
crisis. “The one thing I can promise you is if we turn against each other based 
on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of okey-doke just 
because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative, then we’re not going to 
build on the progress that we’ve started,” he said to applause and cheers from 
2,000 people in a brightly lit gymnasium. “If we get cynical and just vote our 
fears, or if we don’t vote at all, we won’t build on the progress that we’ve 
started.”

 * Clinton raised more than $40 million for her campaign and the Democratic 
National Committee in May, according to her campaign. Clinton raised roughly 
$27 million for her personal campaign, starting the summer with more than $42 
million on hand, and more than $13.5 million for the Democratic National 
Committee and downballot races through the Hillary Victory Fund. Facebook

#BillionaireShade.

Microsoft co-founder, philanthropist and current world’s wealthiest person 
Bill Gates said today that presumptive Republican presidential nomineeDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> “hasn’t been known” for 
his charity work.

Speaking at an event hosted by ReCode, Gates declared that Trump “hasn’t been 
known for his philanthropy... He’s been known for other things.”

The line was prompted by a question regarding whether the candidate, who 
claims that his personal fortune exceeds $10 billion, had been approached to 
sign Gates’ “Giving Pledge,” a campaign to encourage the world’s wealthiest 
people donate the majority of their estates to charitable causes, whether 
during their lifetimes or upon their death. Famous signatories of the pledge 
include financier Warren Buffett, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, financial 
information titan and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Facebook 
co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.

Ruth Guerra, the Republican National Committee’s head of Hispanic media 
relations, is resigning from her position,according to the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/us/politics/rnc-trump-ruth-guerra.html?referer=>
, spurring speculation that lingering discomfort with presumptive Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump continues in the upper echelons of the 
party’s establishment.

The Times reports that Guerra, whose job was to tailor the party’s message for 
Latino voters, is joining the American Action Network, a super-Pac that aims to 
elect conservative members of Congress.

Quoting two RNC aides, the Times reports that Guerra, who is of Mexican 
descent, was “uncomfortable” working to elect Trump, whose platform has 
included draconian immigration policy since his announcement speech last summer.

Update: The RNC has already named a new director of Hispanic communications, 
Helen Aguirre Ferré. Describing Aguirre Ferré as “a seasoned journalist” in a 
press release, the RNC avoids naming the party’s presumptive nominee.

“I’m excited to welcome Helen Aguirre Ferré as our new Director of Hispanic 
Communications,” said party chair Reince Priebus. “Helen will be an integral 
part of our Party’s ongoing commitment to build relationships and communicate 
our message directly with Hispanic voters.”

Gerald Sparks, a union member, asks Barack Obama about the “tens of thousands” 
of Syrian refugees that the administration is letting into the country, and 
asks, in part, “How can you guarantee that there’s none that can be 
radicalized?”

Obama begins his answer by refuting Sparks’ numbers. “We don’t have tens of 
thousands of Syrian refugees,” Obama says. “”We’re trying to admit several 
thousand so far - I think, we’ve been able to admit about 2,500. In contrast, 
Canada has taken in 25,000, and we’re a much bigger country than them. Germany 
has taken in half a million.”

“We have some obligation to help, just like we’d expect people to help if 
Americans were in trouble,” Obama continues. “We’re not spending a lot of money 
on bringing in and housing refugees. And this is what I mean about making sure 
that when we’re deciding elections... we’re looking at the facts.”

“It’s not close to the kinds of numbers you’re talking about,” Obama says 
bluntly. Additionally, he continues, “refugees are actually must admitted on a 
much stricter standard than your average tourist.”

“It’s like a month-long process. But if you are somebody from France, you 
don’t even need a visa - you just hop on a plane, and you’re here in the United 
States.” Obama points out that even if that tourist were on a terror watch list,
Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> in Congress have 
blocked him or her from being barred from purchasing a firearm.

“That’s a much bigger danger than the Syrian refugees,” he concludes.

Barack Obama: Trans bathroom access about 'kindness, that's all'

President Barack Obama, asked about the rising visibility of the issue of 
bathroom access for transgender students in American public schools, pushes 
back against the notion that his administration is focusing on the issue of 
high school bathrooms over “more pressing” issues.

“Somehow people think I made it an issue,” Obama says. “I didn’t make it an 
issue. There are a lot of things that are more pressing!”

But, he says, “You have transgender kids in schools, and they get bullied, and 
they get ostracized, and it’s tough for ‘em. And we’re of a generation where 
that stuff was all out of sight and out of mind, and so people suffered 
silently. But now, they’re out in the open. And the question then is, schools 
are then asking us, the Department of Education, is, how should we deal with 
this?”

“And my answer is that we should deal with this issue the same way we’d want 
it dealt with if it was our child,” Obama says. “And that is to try to create 
an environment of some dignity and kindness for these kids, and that’s sort of 
the bottom line. I have to just say what’s in my heart, but I also have to look 
at what’s the law. And my best interpretation of what our laws and our 
obligations are is that we should try to accommodate these kids so they’re not 
in a vulnerable situation.”

“I’m not the one who’s making a big issue of it,” Obama says, but as 
president, it’s his duty to ensure that “these kids are not excluded and 
ostracized.”

“Look, I have profound respect for everybody’s religious beliefs on this, but 
if you’re in a public school, children are to be treated with kindness. That’s 
all.”

“My reading of scripture tells me that that Golden Rule is pretty high up 
there in terms of my Christian belief,” Obama concludes. “As president of the 
United States, those are are the values that I think are important.”

“You don’t choose the issues all the time - issues come to you. And then you 
have to make your judgement about what you think is right.”

Next question comes from Vanessa Corredera, a professor of English, who asks 
the president to address student-loan debt.

“How do you continue to address this issue in your final months in office?” 
Corredera asks, in particular the humanities, “which are often under attack.”

“I have been emphasizing STEM education,” Obama says, “not because I think the 
humanities are unimportant, but because we generally have not bene producing as 
many engineers and as many scientists… as compared to China, for example. And 
we send a lot of people into banking, and folks like me who become lawyers,” 
Obama says, the US needs to push Americans to study STEM education “if we’re 
gonna remain the most innovative economy in the world.”

“The broader issues of financing education,” Obama says, is government 
spending. “The reason that college is so much more expensive for this 
generation than for my generation has to do with government spending.”

“They kept tuition really really low. What happened around the 80s 90s, state 
leg said they gotta build more prisons,” Obama says. “They started cutting 
higher ed budgets, and they made up for it with higher tuition.”

In the first question from an audience member, local Bill Kircher, a 
“fifth-generation fruit and vegetable grower,” asks about increasing regulation.

“At what point are we over regulated, if not now?” Kircher asks.

Theatre in Elkhart, Indiana. Photograph: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP 
“My administration’s policy has been to encourage family farming, rather than 
big agribusiness,” Obama says. “We want you to succeed. The problem generally 
has been family farms getting bought up by larger agricultural operations. It’s 
been you guys not always getting good prices for the products that you put 
together.”

“I don’t doubt that some” regulations put a burden on you, Obama continues. 
“Previously, you didn’t think that you were able to provide health insurance 
for your employees - the problem is that if they’re not getting health 
insurance thorough you, they’re relying on taxpayers like everybody else to 
bear those costs.”

“There have been a bunch of regulations that have been put in place in the 
past… that are outdated,” Obama admits, but “making sure we’ve got clean air 
and clean water… that is part of our overall obligation.”

Host Gwen Ifill asks President Barack Obama about his thoughts on his 
potential successor’s slogan: “Make America Great Again.”

“What do you think it means when you hear the words, ‘Let’s make America great 
again?’ ” Ifill asks.

“I think America’s pretty great,” Obama protests. “America is the strongest 
country on earth, its economy is the most durable on earth. We are a country 
that has incredible diversity, people are striving, working hard, creating 
businesses - we’ve got the best universities in the world, the best scientists.”

“We’ve got some challenges,” Obama admits, “but overall, not only are we 
recovered from the crisis, that we had but we’re well-positioned to do 
extraordinarily well going forward as long as we make some good decisions.”

“When we’ve gone through a tough time,” Obama says, “then you feel nervous. 
People lost homes, people lost savings, people were worried about whether or 
not they could make ends meet. Even though we’ve recovered, people feel that 
the ground under their feet isn’t quite as solid.”

Under those circumstances, Obama says, voters are likely to get “tempted” by a 
candidate who comes along primising “some simple answer.” Obama doesn’t name
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> explicity, 
telling Ifill that “he does a pretty good job mentioning his own name,” to 
chuckles from the audience.

Barack Obama hosts town hall in Elkhart, Indiana

After making an aggressive foray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/barack-obama-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-indiana-speech>
 into the battle to succeed him at a speech in this small Indiana town earlier 
today, President Barack Obama is holding a town hall discussion with the 
residents of Elkhart, Indiana, hosted by PBS NewsHour co-anchor Gwen Ifill.

Elkhart, the first town Obama visited after winning the White House in 2008, 
has been the site of five presidential visits since, a poster child of the 
economic recovery that Obama says he has stewarded in America’s small towns. 
We’ll be livblogging the proceedings - watch it live here:

Barack Obama today made his most aggressive foray yet into the battle to 
succeed him, warning thatDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> would serve the interests of 
his fellow billionaires and heighten the risk of another financial crisis.
 Barack Obama Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images 
Returning to Elkhart, Indiana, the first city he visited as president, Obama 
defended his economic record over the past seven years against not only 
Republicans but “talking heads” who theorise that outsiders Trump andBernie 
Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> have thrived 
because of bad trade deals that hollowed out communities.

The president stood at a podium jacketless, with his sleeves rolled up, 
apparently relishing a return to election campaign mode even though he is not 
on the ballot. He did not mention Trump orHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> by name but displayed how 
he is likely to be a formidable weapon for his fellow Democrat during the 
general election.

“The one thing I can promise you is if we turn against each other based on 
divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of okey doke just because 
it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative, then we’re not going to build on 
the progress that we’ve started,” he said to applause and cheers from 2,000 
people in a brightly lit gymnasium. “If we get cynical and just vote our fears, 
or if we don’t vote at all, we won’t build on the progress that we’ve started.”

He has not yet made a horse his running mate, but Donald Trump can be compared 
to one of the most notorious of all Roman emperors, Caligula, according to
best-selling historian Tom Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/28/tom-holland-interview-caligula-vampires-coping-with-death-threats>
.

Holland told the Hay festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/guardian-hay-festival> there were 
fascinating parallels between the actions and success of Trump and what was 
going on in Rome 2,000 years ago.

Caligula has gone down in history as one of the maddest and baddest of all 
Roman emperors, a name synonymous with the worst excesses of absolute power.

But there was more to the story of Caligula, Holland said. He is not quite the 
psychopath of popular imagination and we can see similarities between what is 
happening now and then.

What is known for sure about Caligula, Holland said, is that he had a great 
love of spectacle and dressing up; and he enjoyed hurting and humiliating 
people.

The young Caligula spent six years on the island of Capri, where he often 
directed and appeared in spectacular pornographic tableaux for his great uncle, 
the emperor Tiberius – a man it was said, who enjoyed having swimming boys 
nibble at his private parts.

Here are the highlights from today in campaign news:


 * Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump a “fraud” who would “scam America like 
he scammed all those people at Trump University,” the Republican’s defunct 
for-profit business school that is the subject of a federal lawsuit. The 
Democratic frontrunner, who was in New Jersey campaigning ahead of the state’s 
7 June primary, trained her fire on Trump the day after a court ordered the 
release of testimony in the university case. “This election will determine what 
direction this country heads in and there could not be a more stark and 
important difference because every day we learn more and more about Donald 
Trump,” Clinton said at a rally in Rutgers University. 
 * Some of the harshest critics of Trump University have been revealed to be 
former employees of the now-defunct university majority-owned by the 
presumptive Republican presidential nominee.In sworn testimony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/trump-university-staff-testimony-fraudulent-scheme>
, three former staff members have described the real estate school as “a 
facade, a total lie” and a “fraudulent scheme” that “preyed upon the elderly 
and uneducated to separate them from their money.” 
 * A new poll of a hypothetical general-election matchup between Trump and 
Clinton aligns roughly with recent polling awarding a slight edge to the former 
secretary of state, while exposing a stark gender gap that could represent the 
most forbidding obstacle standing between Trump and the presidency. Women 
preferred Clinton to Trump 54-30in the poll 
<https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2352>
, conducted by Quinnipiac University from 24 to 30 May. Men went for Trump to a 
slightly lesser degree, 51-35. With women expected to make up as much as 54% of 
the electorate in November, Trump’s challenge is to display either a greater 
lead on Clinton among men – or to correct his numbers with women. Women both 
constitute more than half the US voting population and aremore likely to vote 
<http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/genderdiff.pdf> than 
men. 
 * The presumptive Republican nominee has announced he is to visit the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-announces-uk-visit-turnberry-golf-resort-britain>
 on the day after the country votes on whether to remain in the EU. Trump’s 
announcement throws up the question of whetherDavid Cameron will meet him, as 
the visit comes the day the result of the EU referendum is declared –a vote 
some polls suggest the prime minister faces losing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/uk-voters-leaning-towards-brexit-guardian-poll-reveals>
.

 * Barack Obama made his most aggressive foray yet into the battle to succeed 
him, warning that Trump - although he wouldn’t say his name - would serve the 
interests of his fellow billionaires and heighten the risk of another financial 
crisis. “The one thing I can promise you is if we turn against each other based 
on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of okey-doke just 
because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative, then we’re not going to 
build on the progress that we’ve started,” he said to applause and cheers from 
2,000 people in a brightly lit gymnasium. “If we get cynical and just vote our 
fears, or if we don’t vote at all, we won’t build on the progress that we’ve 
started.”

 * Clinton raised more than $40 million for her campaign and the Democratic 
National Committee in May, according to her campaign. Clinton raised roughly 
$27 million for her personal campaign, starting the summer with more than $42 
million on hand, and more than $13.5 million for the Democratic National 
Committee and downballot races through the Hillary Victory Fund.

Microsoft co-founder, philanthropist and current world’s wealthiest person 
Bill Gates said today that presumptive Republican presidential nomineeDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> “hasn’t been known” for 
his charity work.

Speaking at an event hosted by ReCode, Gates declared that Trump “hasn’t been 
known for his philanthropy... He’s been known for other things.”

The line was prompted by a question regarding whether the candidate, who 
claims that his personal fortune exceeds $10 billion, had been approached to 
sign Gates’ “Giving Pledge,” a campaign to encourage the world’s wealthiest 
people donate the majority of their estates to charitable causes, whether 
during their lifetimes or upon their death. Famous signatories of the pledge 
include financier Warren Buffett, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, financial 
information titan and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Facebook 
co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.
 
Ruth Guerra, the Republican National Committee’s head of Hispanic media 
relations, is resigning from her position,according to the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/us/politics/rnc-trump-ruth-guerra.html?referer=>
, spurring speculation that lingering discomfort with presumptive Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump continues in the upper echelons of the 
party’s establishment.

The Times reports that Guerra, whose job was to tailor the party’s message for 
Latino voters, is joining the American Action Network, a super-Pac that aims to 
elect conservative members of Congress.

Quoting two RNC aides, the Times reports that Guerra, who is of Mexican 
descent, was “uncomfortable” working to elect Trump, whose platform has 
included draconian immigration policy since his announcement speech last summer.

Update: The RNC has already named a new director of Hispanic communications, 
Helen Aguirre Ferré. Describing Aguirre Ferré as “a seasoned journalist” in a 
press release, the RNC avoids naming the party’s presumptive nominee.

“I’m excited to welcome Helen Aguirre Ferré as our new Director of Hispanic 
Communications,” said party chair Reince Priebus. “Helen will be an integral 
part of our Party’s ongoing commitment to build relationships and communicate 
our message directly with Hispanic voters.”
 
Gerald Sparks, a union member, asks Barack Obama about the “tens of thousands” 
of Syrian refugees that the administration is letting into the country, and 
asks, in part, “How can you guarantee that there’s none that can be 
radicalized?”

Obama begins his answer by refuting Sparks’ numbers. “We don’t have tens of 
thousands of Syrian refugees,” Obama says. “”We’re trying to admit several 
thousand so far - I think, we’ve been able to admit about 2,500. In contrast, 
Canada has taken in 25,000, and we’re a much bigger country than them. Germany 
has taken in half a million.”

“We have some obligation to help, just like we’d expect people to help if 
Americans were in trouble,” Obama continues. “We’re not spending a lot of money 
on bringing in and housing refugees. And this is what I mean about making sure 
that when we’re deciding elections... we’re looking at the facts.”

“It’s not close to the kinds of numbers you’re talking about,” Obama says 
bluntly. Additionally, he continues, “refugees are actually must admitted on a 
much stricter standard than your average tourist.”

“It’s like a month-long process. But if you are somebody from France, you 
don’t even need a visa - you just hop on a plane, and you’re here in the United 
States.” Obama points out that even if that tourist were on a terror watch list,
Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> in Congress have 
blocked him or her from being barred from purchasing a firearm.

“That’s a much bigger danger than the Syrian refugees,” he concludes.
 
President Barack Obama, asked about the rising visibility of the issue of 
bathroom access for transgender students in American public schools, pushes 
back against the notion that his administration is focusing on the issue of 
high school bathrooms over “more pressing” issues.

“Somehow people think I made it an issue,” Obama says. “I didn’t make it an 
issue. There are a lot of things that are more pressing!”

But, he says, “You have transgender kids in schools, and they get bullied, and 
they get ostracized, and it’s tough for ‘em. And we’re of a generation where 
that stuff was all out of sight and out of mind, and so people suffered 
silently. But now, they’re out in the open. And the question then is, schools 
are then asking us, the Department of Education, is, how should we deal with 
this?”

“And my answer is that we should deal with this issue the same way we’d want 
it dealt with if it was our child,” Obama says. “And that is to try to create 
an environment of some dignity and kindness for these kids, and that’s sort of 
the bottom line. I have to just say what’s in my heart, but I also have to look 
at what’s the law. And my best interpretation of what our laws and our 
obligations are is that we should try to accommodate these kids so they’re not 
in a vulnerable situation.”

“I’m not the one who’s making a big issue of it,” Obama says, but as 
president, it’s his duty to ensure that “these kids are not excluded and 
ostracized.”

“Look, I have profound respect for everybody’s religious beliefs on this, but 
if you’re in a public school, children are to be treated with kindness. That’s 
all.”

“My reading of scripture tells me that that Golden Rule is pretty high up 
there in terms of my Christian belief,” Obama concludes. “As president of the 
United States, those are are the values that I think are important.”

“You don’t choose the issues all the time - issues come to you. And then you 
have to make your judgement about what you think is right.”
 
Next question comes from Vanessa Corredera, a professor of English, who asks 
the president to address student-loan debt.

“How do you continue to address this issue in your final months in office?” 
Corredera asks, in particular the humanities, “which are often under attack.”

“I have been emphasizing STEM education,” Obama says, “not because I think the 
humanities are unimportant, but because we generally have not bene producing as 
many engineers and as many scientists… as compared to China, for example. And 
we send a lot of people into banking, and folks like me who become lawyers,” 
Obama says, the US needs to push Americans to study STEM education “if we’re 
gonna remain the most innovative economy in the world.”

“The broader issues of financing education,” Obama says, is government 
spending. “The reason that college is so much more expensive for this 
generation than for my generation has to do with government spending.”

“They kept tuition really really low. What happened around the 80s 90s, state 
leg said they gotta build more prisons,” Obama says. “They started cutting 
higher ed budgets, and they made up for it with higher tuition.”
 
In the first question from an audience member, local Bill Kircher, a 
“fifth-generation fruit and vegetable grower,” asks about increasing regulation.

“At what point are we over regulated, if not now?” Kircher asks.

Theatre in Elkhart, Indiana. Photograph: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP 
“My administration’s policy has been to encourage family farming, rather than 
big agribusiness,” Obama says. “We want you to succeed. The problem generally 
has been family farms getting bought up by larger agricultural operations. It’s 
been you guys not always getting good prices for the products that you put 
together.”

“I don’t doubt that some” regulations put a burden on you, Obama continues. 
“Previously, you didn’t think that you were able to provide health insurance 
for your employees - the problem is that if they’re not getting health 
insurance thorough you, they’re relying on taxpayers like everybody else to 
bear those costs.”

“There have been a bunch of regulations that have been put in place in the 
past… that are outdated,” Obama admits, but “making sure we’ve got clean air 
and clean water… that is part of our overall obligation.”
 
Host Gwen Ifill asks President Barack Obama about his thoughts on his 
potential successor’s slogan: “Make America Great Again.”

“What do you think it means when you hear the words, ‘Let’s make America great 
again?’ ” Ifill asks.

in filming a town hall meeting for PBS Newshour. Photograph: Brendan

“I think America’s pretty great,” Obama protests. “America is the strongest 
country on earth, its economy is the most durable on earth. We are a country 
that has incredible diversity, people are striving, working hard, creating 
businesses - we’ve got the best universities in the world, the best scientists.”

“We’ve got some challenges,” Obama admits, “but overall, not only are we 
recovered from the crisis, that we had but we’re well-positioned to do 
extraordinarily well going forward as long as we make some good decisions.”

“When we’ve gone through a tough time,” Obama says, “then you feel nervous. 
People lost homes, people lost savings, people were worried about whether or 
not they could make ends meet. Even though we’ve recovered, people feel that 
the ground under their feet isn’t quite as solid.”

Under those circumstances, Obama says, voters are likely to get “tempted” by a 
candidate who comes along primising “some simple answer.” Obama doesn’t name
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> explicity, 
telling Ifill that “he does a pretty good job mentioning his own name,” to 
chuckles from the audience.
 
After making an aggressive foray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/barack-obama-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-indiana-speech>
 into the battle to succeed him at a speech in this small Indiana town earlier 
today, President Barack Obama is holding a town hall discussion with the 
residents of Elkhart, Indiana, hosted by PBS NewsHour co-anchor Gwen Ifill.

Elkhart, the first town Obama visited after winning the White House in 2008, 
has been the site of five presidential visits since, a poster child of the 
economic recovery that Obama says he has stewarded in America’s small towns. 
We’ll be livblogging the proceedings - watch it live here:

Returning to Elkhart, Indiana, the first city he visited as president, Obama 
defended his economic record over the past seven years against not only 
Republicans but “talking heads” who theorise that outsiders Trump andBernie 
Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> have thrived 
because of bad trade deals that hollowed out communities.

The president stood at a podium jacketless, with his sleeves rolled up, 
apparently relishing a return to election campaign mode even though he is not 
on the ballot. He did not mention Trump orHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> by name but displayed how 
he is likely to be a formidable weapon for his fellow Democrat during the 
general election.

“The one thing I can promise you is if we turn against each other based on 
divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of okey doke just because 
it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative, then we’re not going to build on 
the progress that we’ve started,” he said to applause and cheers from 2,000 
people in a brightly lit gymnasium. “If we get cynical and just vote our fears, 
or if we don’t vote at all, we won’t build on the progress that we’ve started.”
