Michelle Obama has relied on Sarah Hurwitz for every speech she has given 
since her husband won the nomination in 2008, up to her eloquent riposte to 
Donald Trump at July’s Democratic National Convention, in which she talked 
about raising her two young daughters in a“house built by slaves” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-democratic-convention-video>
 and her repudiation in October of the Trump campaign’s misogyny – speeches 
that electrified the election.

Michelle Obama’s DNC speech: ‘I wake up every morning in a house built by 
slaves’

“What never fails to move and inspire me is her unshakable sense of right and 
wrong,” speechwriter Hurwitz says of her boss. “She has such a strong moral 
core and such a clear set of values, and she’s expressed that in pretty much 
every speech she’s given.”

Full speech: Michelle Obama’s powerful rebuke against Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-full-speech-trump-video>
For eight years, Hurwitz, a Harvard law graduate from Massachusetts, and 
Michelle Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama> have traded 
drafts and honed a singular voice that broke through the bigotry of 2016. “I 
start by talking with her, and she’ll lay out the points she wants to make. We 
work together during the editing process until it’s precisely what she wants to 
say,” she says.

Hurwitz has written speeches for every 21st-century Democratic presidential 
nominee. She started her career in 1998 as an intern for then-vice president Al 
Gore. She worked on John Kerry’s failed 2004 presidential campaign, and then in 
2007, Hurwitz started the election cycle as the chief speechwriter for Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign. Hurwitz was behind Clinton’s famous 2008 concession speech, 
where she thanked her supporters for putting “18m cracks” in the “highest, 
hardest glass ceiling”.

Days later, she was courted by the Obama administration. Despite a bitter 
primary, Hurwitz said the Obamas were incredibly welcoming and gracious.

“After I wrote my first speech for him, then-Senator Obama called to welcome 
me to the campaign. And a week or so after that, I was sitting with Mrs Obama 
and she was telling me what she wanted to say in her Democratic National 
Convention speech.”

Compare Melania Trump’s speech with Michelle Obama’s 2008 address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/19/compare-melania-trumps-speech-with-michelle-obamas-2008-address-video>
Several lines from that speech were re-used by Melania Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump> at the 2016 Republican 
National Convention. Hurwitz will not discuss the incident, and Obama has 
addressed it only once, briefly, on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show. “That 
was tough,” she said with a sly smile.

As the Obama era draws to a close, Hurwitz is reminded of her late 
grandmother. “She was a proud Roosevelt Democrat, and as a young woman, she 
dreamed of going to law school and having a career in politics – but women 
didn’t really have those kinds of opportunities back then,” she says.

“It never ceases to amaze me that just two generations later, I have walked 
through the Northwest Gate of the White House every day for the past eight 
years to get to work.”
