Today in 2016

 * Donald Trump did not deny that he has not paid federal taxes for as many as 
18 years, and insisted that a $916m loss in 1995 was actually evidence that he 
is an incredible comeback story. He also said the 1990s, a decade of growth, 
low unemployment and stability, rivaled the Great Depression for despair and 
desolation. He saw dystopia at an earlier rally too, describing: “race riots on 
our streets on a monthly basis. Somebody said don’t call them race riots, but 
that’s what they are.” 
 * Hillary Clinton said that her opponent “represents the same rigged system 
that he claims he’s going to change, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/clinton-trump-taxes-rigged-system>
” and painted him as a business failure. ““How anyone can lose a dollar, let 
alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is beyond me.” A round of new 
polls showed Clinton ahead of Trump in several swing states off of the first 
presidential debate last week. Nationally, a CNN poll had her up 47% to 42% 
over Trump, and a CBS poll had her up 45% to 41%. 
 * Several veterans groups turned against Trump over an ambiguous remark he 
made about PTSD. Incontext 
<https://twitter.com/LeoShane/status/782977949012152320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>: 
“They see maybe what people in this room have seen many times over, and you’re 
strong and can handle it, but a lot of people can’t handle it. And they see 
horror stories, they see events that you’d see in a movie and you wouldn’t 
believe it. We need mental health help, and medical. It’s one of the things 
that’s least addressed, and it’s one of the things I hear the most about when I 
go around and talk to veterans. So we’re going to have a very robust level of 
performance having to do with mental health.” 
 * And Tim Kaine and Mike Pence prepared to face off in Tuesday’s one and only 
vice-presidential debate of the election. On Monday, Pence was slapped down by 
the seventh circuit court of appeals, whichrejected his attempt to deny aid to 
Syrian refugees

Trump closes out the rally by saying he will lower taxes, restore law and 
order, and “appoint justices of the supreme court who will uphold and defend 
the constitution of the United States”.

“We are going to rebuild America, we are going to unite America again,” he 
says. “Imagine what we can accomplish as one people, under one God, saluting 
one American flag.”

He claps to himself, slightly off time to the simplistic rock beat playing out 
him out, and wanders slowly off stage.

“It’s these hardworking immigrants who are hurt the most by open borders,” 
Trump continues. The US does not have open borders, and Barack Obama has 
deported more than 2.5 million people since he took office.

“Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime and massive drugs,” 
Trump says, baselessly, sincecrime statistics

He moves along to terrorism, and the San Bernardino terrorist attacker 
Tashfeen Malik, who came to the US on a fiancee visa. “They should’ve checked 
her Facebook page and they never would’ve let her into our country,” he says, 
falsely, since Malik never posted publicly in support of jihad but rather in 
private messages.

“Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.” The

American citizen born in Queens, New York, as wasDonald Trump

“This is a state with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history,” 
Trump says. “You are all Americans, and great Americans.”

A few months ago, Trump refused to admit a federal judge born in Indiana was 
American,insisting that judge Gonzalo Curiel is “Mexican” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican>
 because his parents were born in Mexico. For five years, Trumprefused to admit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton>
 that Hawaii-born Barack Obama was American.

Trump says that all Americans enjoy the same civil rights, then segues into a 
discussion of violence in cities, saying that Clinton “attacks” the police. He 
then rattles down a laundry list of conservative issues, citing his support for 
“school choice” and repealing Obama’s signature healthcare act. He then says 
Clinton supports trade deals like “Bill Clinton’s Nafta”, referring to the 
trade dealnegotiated and signed by George HW Bush  
<https://www.c-span.org/video/?33000-1/north-american-free-trade-agreement-signing>
and then signed again 
<http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/bill-clinton/videos/clinton-signs-nafta>

The businessman now says that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is only in itself for 
herself and her donors, but that he’s here for the American people.

“We have a very tough situation right now. For me impossible is just a 
starting point. From the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I 
created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of 
thousands of jobs.”

The worth of Trump’s company is unclear, since he refuses to release his tax 
returns and the company is privately held. It’s similarly unclear how many jobs 
he’s created, though CNNestimates about 34,000

Trump also allegedly stiffed hundreds of small businesses 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/>
 for their contract work on his projects.

He claims that “Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official, 
breaking the law and putting government offices for sale.”

Hillary Clinton was investigated for criminal wrongdoing in the use of her 
private email server as secretary of state, but the FBI recommended no charges 
and did not find evidence of deliberate malfeasance or criminal negligence. She 
has never been investigated or charged with selling public offices.

“We’re a divided nation and each week it seems we’re getting more and more 
divided, with race riots on the streets on a weekly, monthly basis.”

Trump is apparently referring to protests against police violence, which are 
not happening on a weekly or monthly basis but after police shootings or the 
release of videos.

Trump: 1990s were worse than the 1930s

Trump defends his tax practices at length. He says it was his responsibility 
to find ways to not pay taxes, essentially, for the sake of his business and 
family.

“I was able to sue the tax laws of this country and my skills as a 
businessperson to dig out,” he says. “I did a great job.”

He then blames the 1990s for his $916m losses documented in the tax return, 
whose contents he does not deny are accurate. But he still calls it “an alleged 
filing from the 1990s, a long time ago, at the end of one of the most brutal 
economic downturns in our country’s history.”

“The conditions facing real estate developers in the 1990s,” he says, were 
“far worse that the great recession of 2008, which was nothing compared to the 
early 1990s”.

“Some people in some respects it was almost the equivalent of 1929, the 
disaster.”

No reasonable person would compare the global chaos and economic desolation of 
the 1929 stock market crash, much less the subsequent depression of the 1930s, 
to the stability and economic growth 
<https://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_viewpoints_l-t_growth_lessons/> of 
the 1990s.

“The reason I never felt endangered,” he says, was because he knew the tax 
code, financial system “and I knew how to fight”.

Trump’s millionaire father also continuously supported his son 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-father-helped-gop-candidate-with-numerous-loans-1474656573>
. In a 2007 deposition, Trumpadmitted to having borrowed from his father’s estat

Trump is now expounding on how many rows of crowd the media is going to show 
later on TV.

“My people don’t get it, my people don’t. They don’t get it my people. But if 
they would span the crowd,” he says. “We went to Pueblo today, we had a 
tremendous crowd.”

The fire marshal, he says, “was fantastic”. “I said, ‘How can you have a fire 
it’s a concrete floor!’”

“I made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan, and this is big 
stuff, the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and the largest regulatory 
reform in American history.”

“We’re bringing it way down to 12.5% for middle income, and to 0% for people 
who aren’t doing so well.” Trump’s tax plan would save the wealthiest Americans 
millions of dollars 
<http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016>
, and only marginally benefit lower earners who make up the vast majority of 
the country.

“The personal taxes, the corporate taxes. Trillions of companies are outside 
are country, because the taxes are so much,” he continues. “Just about the 
highest in the world, our taxes.”

This is not true. 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/>
 The US ranks 31st for tax revenue, 17th for corporate tax revenue, and 19th 
for tax revenue per capita among the world’s industrialized nations., according 
to the OECD.

“And with all those taxes, the roads are bad, everything is bad.”

Trump did not pay federal income taxes in 1995, and has not denied that he 
paid no tax for the following 18 years.

Trump is now bemoaning the absence of “a general MacArthur”, alluding to the 
second world war era general who was eventuallyfired by president Harry Truman 
for his efforts to expand the Korean war into a deeper conflict with China, 
<http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/history/redacted-testimony-fully-explains-why-general-macarthur-was-fired-180960622/>
 which the joint chiefs of staff opposed.

“In the old days we used to read, it’s called, the element of surprise,” Trump 
says. He says it’s foolish for the US and its Iraqi allies to announce that 
they plan to retake Mosul – giving notice to civilians. “We don’t have surprise 
anymore.”

“Remember, a few weeks ago, $400m in cash,” he goes on, alluding to money 
given to Iran aspart of a $1.7bn Hague-mediated settlement for a failed arms 
deal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-payment-of-1-7-billion-to-iran-raises-questions-of-ransom-1453421778>
, which dates back to 1979, in cash because of the bars on transactions between 
US banks and Tehran. “Nut then that turned out to be wrong, it was $1.7bn in 
cash. In cash!”

Trump then says he’s really grateful for the National Rifle Association’s 
endorsement. He says that Hillary Clinton is responsible for a “campaign of 
distraction” by special interests and hedge fund managers. He does not specify 
these interests beyond the hedge fund managers, the wealthiest of whom would 
disproportionately benefit from Trump’s tax proposals, according toan analysis 
by the conservative Tax Foundation 
<http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016>
.

“All that stands between you and the country you want are Hillary Clinton’s 
special interests.” He tells people to mail in their ballots and get out the 
vote.

“I wish those cameras would, hey would you do me a favor fellas and span the 
room.” The camera spans. “Pretty amazing. Place is packed. New record!” he 
shouts,in the manner of Steve Holt!

. He hugs a very enthusiastic young man wearing a “Make America Great Again” 
hat.

“John Elway is a winner, so congratulations,” Trump praises the Denver 
Broncos. Back in 1983, John Elway rejected an offer from Trump to join his 
doomed attempt to get into football. Elway is now general manager of the 
Broncos, and in the hall of fame.

Donald Trump’s friends and reluctant Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> are out across the country 
talking about him.

In New Hampshire, senator Kelly Ayotte is in a close race for re-election 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/22/sen-kelly-ayotte-is-stuck-between-donald-trump-and-a-hard-place/>
 against Democratic governor Maggie Hassan, and tonight she’s facing questions 
about her promise to vote for Trump.

"Wld you tell children to be like Trump?" Ayotte: "There are many role models 
we have. I believe he can serve as President, so absolutely."

And in Loveland, Colorado, retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn is talking 
aboutHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, who 
he says has been “caught in lie after lie after lie”.

Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> made a cameo in federal court 
today, as the loser in a court battle over Syrian refugees who have been 
screened to settle in the US.

The seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless “nightmare 
speculation” and compared the governor’s attempt to block refugees to an 
attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 
174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.

“The governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these 
persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to 
infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No 
evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare 
speculation,” Judge Richard Posner wrote in theopinion 
<http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0>
.

“[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or 
that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United 
States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian 
refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the 
United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, 
implementation of the governor’s policy would simply increase the risk of 
terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.”

Like Trump, Pence has taken the draconian position that the US should stop 
taking refugees from Syria because vetting processes are inadequate, in their 
eyes. A refugee who wants to come to the US must pass through interviews, 
background and medical checks by the Department of Homeland Security, US 
security agencies, immigration services and the UN, and the process takes 18 
months to two years.

Posner wrote that Pence’s idea of exclusion by nationality is: “the equivalent 
of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to 
settle in Indiana not because they’re black but because he’s afraid of them, 
and since race is therefore not his motive he isn’t discriminating. But that of 
course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is 
discrimination on the basis of nationality.”

Prepare for the clash of veeps

Adam Gabbatt

Like the Gulf stream, or a young Republican who doesn’t wear beige chinos, we 
knowMike Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> and Tim Kaine 
exist – we just don’t really see them.

With the media focused on Donald Trump’s near daily 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-interview-bill-hillary-clinton.html>
indiscretions 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/trump-overnight-media-tweets/>, and 
Hillary Clinton’svarious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/hillary-clinton-twitter-national-service-scholarships-trump>
responses 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-clinton-affairs-joel-benenson-229046>
 to those indiscretions, both the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential 
nominees have been forced into the shadows.


But no more. Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate will be Kaine and Pence’s 
first chance to show us all what we’ve been missing. Here’s why it will 
definitely be exciting …

Finding out which is which

Both vice-presidential candidates are middle-aged white men. Both have 
single-syllable first and last names and five-letter last names. Both have grey 
hair. Both of them werelargely 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/poll-mike-pence-trump-vp-pick-225553> 
unknown 
<https://morningconsult.com/2016/07/22/tim-kaine-vice-president-pick-hillary-clinton/>
 to the public before they were chosen as running mates.

Tuesday night is an opportunity for Americans to play spot-the-difference. 
Kaine and Pence will introduce themselves at the beginning of the debate – 
clearing up, once and for all, which one is Kaine and which one is Pence.

 * Donald Trump did not deny that he has not paid federal taxes for as many as 
18 years, and insisted that a $916m loss in 1995 was actually evidence that he 
is an incredible comeback story. He also said the 1990s, a decade of growth, 
low unemployment and stability, rivaled the Great Depression for despair and 
desolation. He saw dystopia at an earlier rally too, describing: “race riots on 
our streets on a monthly basis. Somebody said don’t call them race riots, but 
that’s what they are.” 
 * Hillary Clinton said that her opponent “represents the same rigged system 
that he claims he’s going to change, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/clinton-trump-taxes-rigged-system>
” and painted him as a business failure. ““How anyone can lose a dollar, let 
alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is beyond me.” A round of new 
polls showed Clinton ahead of Trump in several swing states off of the first 
presidential debate last week. Nationally, a CNN poll had her up 47% to 42% 
over Trump, and a CBS poll had her up 45% to 41%. 
 * Several veterans groups turned against Trump over an ambiguous remark he 
made about PTSD. Incontext 
<https://twitter.com/LeoShane/status/782977949012152320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>: 
“They see maybe what people in this room have seen many times over, and you’re 
strong and can handle it, but a lot of people can’t handle it. And they see 
horror stories, they see events that you’d see in a movie and you wouldn’t 
believe it. We need mental health help, and medical. It’s one of the things 
that’s least addressed, and it’s one of the things I hear the most about when I 
go around and talk to veterans. So we’re going to have a very robust level of 
performance having to do with mental health.” 
 * And Tim Kaine and Mike Pence prepared to face off in Tuesday’s one and only 
vice-presidential debate of the election. On Monday, Pence was slapped down by

Trump closes out the rally by saying he will lower taxes, restore law and 
order, and “appoint justices of the supreme court who will uphold and defend 
the constitution of the United States”.

“We are going to rebuild America, we are going to unite America again,” he 
says. “Imagine what we can accomplish as one people, under one God, saluting 
one American flag.”

He claps to himself, slightly off time to the simplistic rock beat playing out 
him out, and wanders slowly off stage.
 
“It’s these hardworking immigrants who are hurt the most by open borders,” 
Trump continues. The US does not have open borders, and Barack Obama has 
deported more than 2.5 million people since he took office.

“Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime and massive drugs,” 
Trump says, baselessly, sincecrime statistics

between noncitizens and crime.

He moves along to terrorism, and the San Bernardino terrorist attacker 
Tashfeen Malik, who came to the US on a fiancee visa. “They should’ve checked 
her Facebook page and they never would’ve let her into our country,” he says, 
falsely, since Malik never posted publicly in support of jihad but rather in 
private messages.

“Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.” The 
gunman in the Orlando attack, the worst mass shooting in US history, was an 
American citizen born in Queens, New York, as wasDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.
 
“The investigation of Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was rigged,” Trump says, 
impugning the ethics and professional conduct of the FBI, whose director was 
deputy attorney general of George W Bush.

“We’ve become a banana republic,” Trump says, moving on to polls. “We’re up in 
Florida. We’re up in a lot of places.”

“This is a state with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history,” 
Trump says. “You are all Americans, and great Americans.”

A few months ago, Trump refused to admit a federal judge born in Indiana was 
American,insisting that judge Gonzalo Curiel is “Mexican” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican>
 because his parents were born in Mexico. For five years, Trumprefused to admit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton>
 that Hawaii-born Barack Obama was American.

Trump says that all Americans enjoy the same civil rights, then segues into a 
discussion of violence in cities, saying that Clinton “attacks” the police. He 
then rattles down a laundry list of conservative issues, citing his support for 
“school choice” and repealing Obama’s signature healthcare act. He then says 
Clinton supports trade deals like “Bill Clinton’s Nafta”, referring to the 
trade dealnegotiated and signed by George HW Bush  
<https://www.c-span.org/video/?33000-1/north-american-free-trade-agreement-signing>
and then signed again 
<http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/bill-clinton/videos/clinton-signs-nafta>
 by Clinton.
 
The businessman now says that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is only in itself for 
herself and her donors, but that he’s here for the American people.

“We have a very tough situation right now. For me impossible is just a 
starting point. From the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I 
created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of 
thousands of jobs.”

The worth of Trump’s company is unclear, since he refuses to release his tax 
returns and the company is privately held. It’s similarly unclear how many jobs 
he’s created, though CNNestimates about 34,000 
<http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/03/news/economy/donald-trump-jobs-created/>. 
Trump also allegedly stiffed hundreds of small businesses 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/>
 for their contract work on his projects.

He claims that “Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official, 
breaking the law and putting government offices for sale.”

Hillary Clinton was investigated for criminal wrongdoing in the use of her 
private email server as secretary of state, but the FBI recommended no charges 
and did not find evidence of deliberate malfeasance or criminal negligence. She 
has never been investigated or charged with selling public offices.

“We’re a divided nation and each week it seems we’re getting more and more 
divided, with race riots on the streets on a weekly, monthly basis.”

Trump is apparently referring to protests against police violence, which are 
not happening on a weekly or monthly basis but after police shootings or the 
release of videos.
 
Trump defends his tax practices at length. He says it was his responsibility 
to find ways to not pay taxes, essentially, for the sake of his business and 
family.

“I was able to sue the tax laws of this country and my skills as a 
businessperson to dig out,” he says. “I did a great job.”

He then blames the 1990s for his $916m losses documented in the tax return, 
whose contents he does not deny are accurate. But he still calls it “an alleged 
filing from the 1990s, a long time ago, at the end of one of the most brutal 
economic downturns in our country’s history.”

“The conditions facing real estate developers in the 1990s,” he says, were 
“far worse that the great recession of 2008, which was nothing compared to the 
early 1990s”.

“Some people in some respects it was almost the equivalent of 1929, the 
disaster.”

No reasonable person would compare the global chaos and economic desolation of 
the 1929 stock market crash, much less the subsequent depression of the 1930s, 
to the stability and economic growth 
<https://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_viewpoints_l-t_growth_lessons/> of 
the 1990s.

“The reason I never felt endangered,” he says, was because he knew the tax 
code, financial system “and I knew how to fight”.

Trump’s millionaire father also continuously supported his son 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-father-helped-gop-candidate-with-numerous-loans-1474656573>
. In a 2007 deposition, Trumpadmitted to having borrowed from his father’s estat
 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/03/trumps-false-claim-he-built-his-empire-with-a-small-loan-from-his-father/>
e in the 1990s: ‘I think it was like in the $9m range.”
 
Trump is now expounding on how many rows of crowd the media is going to show 
later on TV.

“My people don’t get it, my people don’t. They don’t get it my people. But if 
they would span the crowd,” he says. “We went to Pueblo today, we had a 
tremendous crowd.”

The fire marshal, he says, “was fantastic”. “I said, ‘How can you have a fire 
it’s a concrete floor!’”

“I made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan, and this is big 
stuff, the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and the largest regulatory 
reform in American history.”

“We’re bringing it way down to 12.5% for middle income, and to 0% for people 
who aren’t doing so well.” Trump’s tax plan would save the wealthiest Americans 
millions of dollars 
<http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016>
, and only marginally benefit lower earners who make up the vast majority of 
the country.

“The personal taxes, the corporate taxes. Trillions of companies are outside 
are country, because the taxes are so much,” he continues. “Just about the 
highest in the world, our taxes.”

This is not true. 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/>
 The US ranks 31st for tax revenue, 17th for corporate tax revenue, and 19th 
for tax revenue per capita among the world’s industrialized nations., according 
to the OECD.

“And with all those taxes, the roads are bad, everything is bad.”

Trump did not pay federal income taxes in 1995, and has not denied that he 
paid no tax for the following 18 years.

Trump is now bemoaning the absence of “a general MacArthur”, alluding to the 
second world war era general who was eventuallyfired by president Harry Truman 
for his efforts to expand the Korean war into a deeper conflict with China, 
<http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/history/redacted-testimony-fully-explains-why-general-macarthur-was-fired-180960622/>
 which the joint chiefs of staff opposed.

“In the old days we used to read, it’s called, the element of surprise,” Trump 
says. He says it’s foolish for the US and its Iraqi allies to announce that 
they plan to retake Mosul – giving notice to civilians. “We don’t have surprise 
anymore.”

“Remember, a few weeks ago, $400m in cash,” he goes on, alluding to money 
given to Iran aspart of a $1.7bn Hague-mediated settlement for a failed arms 
deal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-payment-of-1-7-billion-to-iran-raises-questions-of-ransom-1453421778>
, which dates back to 1979, in cash because of the bars on transactions between 
US banks and Tehran. “Nut then that turned out to be wrong, it was $1.7bn in 
cash. In cash!”

Trump then says he’s really grateful for the National Rifle Association’s 
endorsement. He says that Hillary Clinton is responsible for a “campaign of 
distraction” by special interests and hedge fund managers. He does not specify 
these interests beyond the hedge fund managers, the wealthiest of whom would 
disproportionately benefit from Trump’s tax proposals, according toan analysis 
by the conservative Tax Foundation 
<http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016>
.

“All that stands between you and the country you want are Hillary Clinton’s 
special interests.” He tells people to mail in their ballots and get out the 
vote.

“I wish those cameras would, hey would you do me a favor fellas and span the 
room.” The camera spans. “Pretty amazing. Place is packed. New record!” he 
shouts,in the manner of Steve Holt!

. He hugs a very enthusiastic young man wearing a “Make America Great Again” 
hat.

“John Elway is a winner, so congratulations,” Trump praises the Denver 
Broncos. Back in 1983, John Elway rejected an offer from Trump to join his 
doomed attempt to get into football. Elway is now general manager of the 
Broncos, and in the hall of fame.

Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> made a cameo in federal court 
today, as the loser in a court battle over Syrian refugees who have been 
screened to settle in the US.

The seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless “nightmare 
speculation” and compared the governor’s attempt to block refugees to an 
attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 
174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.
 Pence Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP 
“The governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these 
persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to 
infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No 
evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare 
speculation,” Judge Richard Posner wrote in theopinion 
<http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0>
.

“[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or 
that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United 
States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian 
refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the 
United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, 
implementation of the governor’s policy would simply increase the risk of 
terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.”

Like Trump, Pence has taken the draconian position that the US should stop 
taking refugees from Syria because vetting processes are inadequate, in their 
eyes. A refugee who wants to come to the US must pass through interviews, 
background and medical checks by the Department of Homeland Security, US 
security agencies, immigration services and the UN, and the process takes 18 
months to two years.

Posner wrote that Pence’s idea of exclusion by nationality is: “the equivalent 
of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to 
settle in Indiana not because they’re black but because he’s afraid of them, 
and since race is therefore not his motive he isn’t discriminating. But that of 
course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is 
discrimination on the basis of nationality.”

knowMike Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> and Tim Kaine 
exist – we just don’t really see them.

With the media focused on Donald Trump’s near daily

 to those indiscretions, both the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential 
nominees have been forced into the shadows.


But no more. Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate will be Kaine and Pence’s 
first chance to show us all what we’ve been missing. Here’s why it will
