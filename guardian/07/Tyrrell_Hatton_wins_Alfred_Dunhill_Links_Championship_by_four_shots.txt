Tyrrell Hatton cruised to his first European Tour title with a commanding 
victory in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday.

Hatton, who equalled the course record at St Andrews with a flawless 62 on 
Saturday, shot a closing 66 to finish 23 under par, matching the tournament 
record set by David Howell and Peter Uihlein in 2013.

Ross Fisher, his playing partner, and Richard Sterne of South Africa shared 
second place on 19 under, with Sweden’s Joakim Lagergren two shots further back 
in fourth and Scotland’s Marc Warren fifth on 16 under.

“It feels amazing,” said Hatton, who will climb from 53rd in the world 
rankings to a new career-high inside the top 35. “I’ve wanted this moment since 
I was a six-year-old walking around Wentworth [watching the BMW PGA 
Championship], so it’s incredible.”

Hatton, who will celebrate his 25th birthday on Friday, took a three-shot lead 
into the final round and was never in danger of being caught after firing a 
hat-trick of birdies from the 3rd and picking up another on the 9th.

Sterne and Fisher reduced their deficit to four shots thanks to birdies on the 
11th and 10th respectively but Sterne then saw his birdie putt from four feet 
on the 12th catch the edge of the hole and spin out.

Hatton had no such problem on the same hole and, although Sterne did birdie 
the par-five 14th, Hatton did likewise to tighten his grip on the title and the 
first prize of £612,000.

Another birdie on the 15th left Hatton six shots clear and, although he shot 
his only bogey of the weekend after finding the Road Hole bunker on the 17th, 
the former Challenge Tour graduate had done enough to secure a seemingly 
nerveless win.

“It didn’t feel that way inside,” Hatton said. “I was pretty nervous all day. 
I started to feel a little bit more comfortable down 14, 15 and was just so 
happy I got over the line.

Jack Nicklaus: Arnold Palmer was the king of golf

“I had a new putter in the bag this week and it worked really well. I’m just 
so happy. It’s the British Masters next week and I’m looking forward to that. 
We’ll have a good evening tonight and hopefully I can have a good end to the 
year as well.”

Sterne carded a flawless closing 66 but was never able to get closer than four 
shots behind the Englishman in the group ahead.

“I played nicely,” said Sterne, who holed a 50-yard pitch on the 17th for his 
final birdie of the day. “I tried my best to put some pressure on Tyrrell but 
he got off to a good start and kept it going, which is good. It’s a big win and 
it’s going to be a special win for him here at the Old Course.

“I was 72nd on the Order of Merit, so I needed this to get into the last few 
events. Those events are something we aspire to get into and this should take 
care of that.”

Warren began the week 125th on the Race to Dubai with only the top 110 
retaining their playing privileges at the end of the season.

“I’m very happy, to say the least,” he said. “Obviously I knew coming in today 
was an important day for me in terms of the season and to go out and play like 
that, 67, bogey-free, was relatively stress-free as much as it could be.

“This is a tournament I’ve always had on my schedule. I was fortunate. One 
year I couldn’t get in and got an invite and got a top-five finish and got my 
card back that year. It’s a place I knew I could do it, have a good finish and 
in very similar circumstances.”

The Masters champion, Danny Willett,

 who missed the cut in the tournament proper, won the pro-am event with his 
caddie, Jonathan Smart, after Smart birdied the pair’s final hole to finish a 
shot ahead of Adrian Meronk and Johan Eliasch.
