“You are going to become the champions of the Central African Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/central-african-republic>. Hang on! The 
journey is about to begin.”

The four boys and two girls listening to Eric Mamboue’s pep talk in Bangui, 
the capital of a country condemned to decades of conflict by geography, 
misgovernance and malice, might be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed, 
but they do actually cherish big hopes and dreams, and know that staying in 
school is the first step to achieving them.

In a country brought to its knees by three years of inter-ethnic and religious 
violence, where communities still live apart, and where any loud metallic noise 
makes people jump and wonder if the killing has started again, these children 
know that education is not just a way out for them: it could also save their 
country.

'The Central African Republic must be built from scratch'

“Without education, the problems will never end,” says Jean*, an eloquent 
17-year-old who wears a beaded purse embroidered with Bible verses around his 
neck.

“The wise share their knowledge. People who are not wise try to destroy 
things. If we are not educated, things will go badly. If we are educated, the 
leaders of the future will be able to defend the country.”

The children are all taking part in VoiceMore, a pilot project run by War Child
 <https://www.warchild.org.uk/what-we-do> to train young people to speak out 
about their rights. Mamboue is War Child’s country director in Central African 
Republic, and these children recently completed a six-day training course.

They all have firsthand knowledge of what it means to have your right to 
education snatched away.

In 2013, when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels pushed into this green city 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/24/central-african-republic-president-flees>
 set on the wide Oubangui river, they ousted the president and committed 
atrocities against Christians, triggering the formation of mainly Christian and 
animist anti-balaka (machete) militias, who took bloody revenge on Muslim 
communities.

The Seleka ousted then president François Bozizé, and installed their own man, 
Michel Djotodia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/01/central-african-republic-leader-government>
. He was forced outin 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/catherine-samba-panza-sworn-in-central-african-republic>
, ceding power to a transitional government. Now a new president – 
Faustin-Archange Touadéra –has been elected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/12/central-african-republic-car-pray-presidential-elections-bring-peace-at-last>
, most of the Seleka have retreated to the north, and, in theory, the former 
French colony is entering a post-conflict stage.

But for the hundreds of thousands of children who missed out on school for 
months, even years, much damage is already done.

“The conflict affected our education. Our levels slipped. That could affect 
the future of our country when it is us who are the leaders of society,” says 
Dieudonne*, 15.

His friends giggle nervously at this audacious vision of the future – they are 
just teenagers, despite what they have seen.

“In our family, we lost two, three people from gunfire,” says 16-year-old 
Rose*. “We couldn’t even go to the funeral, couldn’t get to the cemetery. If 
you didn’t have money, you couldn’t move through the streets. They would even 
take your clothes.”

Free these children from the desire for vengeance, the spirit of hate and the 
desire for war
Marius Mobia 
The rebels stole or burned schoolbooks, ripped out electricity wires, and 
smashed the photocopier at Jean’s school. Across the country, schools were used 
as bases by militia on all sides.

“My school stayed open but there were anti-balaka who came and hassled us and 
we couldn’t come every day. Now, I know how important education is. It is the 
cornerstone of man’s success,” Jean says.

After the Seleka lost control, there was a period of relative calm in Bangui, 
but in September,violence exploded again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/central-african-republic-violent-sectarian-clashes-erupt-in-bangui>
 after a Muslim man was killed. And though many cite thePope’s visit in November
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/30/pope-francis-mosque-central-african-republic>
 as a significant step towards peace, there is a palpable tension everywhere.

Today, Jean and his friends are back in class, but one-third of school-age 
children in CAR are not, and one-quarter of schools are still shut 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-education-idUSKCN0XV1ZI>.


Marius Mobia, from Enfants sans Frontières 
<https://www.warchild.org.uk/what-we-do/central-african-republic>, which 
partners War Child to run after-school clubs on child rights, says education is 
key to overcoming the divisions caused by the conflict. Since 2013,many Muslims 
have fled CAR 
<http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/FINAL_Humanitarian%20Bulletin%20%2310_0.pdf>
, or live in about a dozen enclaves in the west.

“If my child goes to school, tomorrow he will replace me … If my child does 
not go to school, it means I don’t want the country to flourish. [Education] is 
a cornerstone, it is inescapable in life,” says Mobia, who has four children.

“We ask the international community to help us build schools, child-friendly 
spaces and centres where we can give psychological support to free these 
children from the desire for vengeance, the spirit of hate and the desire for 
war.”

30 million children have lost their homes – they must not lose their education

At a state school in another part of Bangui, director Benjamin Regakouzou says 
many children have become aggressive, while some teachers have been on strike 
since January because they have not been paid.


“Every day, there are fights,” he says, going to the corner of his office to 
take down a metre-long wooden gun made by one of the students from what looks 
like the arm of a chair and a long stick.

“He put it at the back of the class like this,” says Regakouzou, placing the 
gun, butt down, against the wall. “The teacher saw it and brought it to me. 
That’s the effect of the crisis.”

Beside the M’Poko airport, where about 20,000 displaced people live 
<http://www.irinnews.org/report/100862/tough-conditions-car-displaced-airport-camp>
 in shoulder-high shelters cobbled together from corrugated iron, tarpaulins or 
wood, the UN children’s agency,Unicef, and local partner Remod 
<http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/english/media_8070.html> have opened a temporary 
learning space, known as anEtape (stage), for more than 6,000 children.


Chancelin Ouilibona, the director, lives in the camp, as do all the teachers 
at the school – a series of tented rooms where older children sit on wooden 
benches and younger ones on mats. Ouilibona’s family have been living here 
since Seleka rebels destroyed their home in 2013, stealing the roof, the doors, 
everything.

“The children are traumatised,” Ouilibona says. “We teach them about peace and 
social cohesion … These children must not think Muslims are our enemies and we 
theirs … They must know Muslims are their brothers.”

Because there is no electricity in the camp, many children study under the 
bright lights at the nearby base of a Rwandan contingent of the UN peacekeeping 
force, known asMinusca <http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusca/>, 
which has around 12,000 troops here.

About an hour’s flight north of Bangui in the Bossangoa district, at a school 
near the Ouham river where hippos snort loudly as they surface, Sore*, 13, says 
she wants to be matron when she grows up.

“If I don’t go to school I am not a citizen. I am just a toto [silly in 
Sango]. If I go to school, I will work and become someone tomorrow,” she says.

Crepin Namdenganana, who runs War Child’s projects in this area, has a message 
for the international community as it meets inIstanbul for a summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/05/medecins-sans-frontieres-world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-fig-leaf-pulls-out>
 meant to reset the humanitarian system and enable it to cope protracted 
crises, like the one in CAR.


 “If I could appeal to the humanitarian family, I would say focus on education 
… In the third millennium, a person without education, or a person who is 
illiterate, is like a dead person because they won’t be aware, and they won’t 
understand what is around them.”

Jean says education is not only critical for reconciliation now, but can also 
prevent conflicts.

“If there had been good education in the Central African Republic, we would 
not have descended into this crisis … Education is really poor. Many people 
don’t know why they live, and it is easy to manipulate them,” he says.

And he imbues this mature pragmatism with a shot of the boundless hope of 
teenagers.

“To stop this, and make sure there are no more rebellions, we have to fix 
[ethnic] racism, the religious problem and corruption. These things will not 
help our country, but liberty, dignity and fraternity will.”
