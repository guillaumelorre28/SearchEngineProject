Dwayne Johnson has topped Forbes magazine’s list of the highest paid male 
actors, earning $64.5m (£48.8m) in the last year –nearly $20m more than his 
female counterpart, Jennifer Lawrence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/23/jennifer-lawrence-tops-forbes-list-of-highest-paid-female-actors-with-46m>
.


The former wrestler, also known as the Rock, more than doubled his earnings 
from the previous year thanks to lucrative roles in the Fast and Furious 
franchise and the disaster movie San Andreas. Second in 2014, he bumped Iron 
Man star Robert Downey Jr, who hadtopped the list for three years running 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/04/robert-downey-jr-best-paid-actor-forbes-jackie-chan-amitabh-bachchan>
, from the top spot.

Forbes’s annual best-paid actors lists, which are divided between men and 
women, have again highlighted the huge pay gap between genders. Lawrence’s 
earnings are only 72% of Johnson’s, slightly lower than the pay disparity 
between white men and women in the US who earn an average wage.

Eighteen male actors took home over $20m, compared with only four female 
stars. Among them was Jackie Chan, who came second to Johnson with a pay packet 
of $61m. Matt Damon, paid $55m over the last year for starring in hits such as 
The Martian and Jason Bourne, Tom Cruise ($53m) and Johnny Depp ($48m) rounded 
out the male top five.

Lawrence is the world’s sixth highest paid actor. She earned $46m over the 
last year, putting her above male stars such as Ben Affleck ($43m) and Vin 
Diesel ($35m). The Hunger Games star,who wrote last year of about the injustice 
of being paid less than “lucky people with dicks” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/13/jennifer-lawrence-hollywood-gender-pay-gap>
 after the Sony hacks revealed she was paid less than her male American Hustle 
co-stars, is one of the few women paid anywhere near as much as the leading 
men. Second on the female list is Ghostbusters star Melissa McCarthy ($33m), 
who would place eighth on the male top 10. The lowest paid man on the male list 
of 20 (Harrison Ford – $15m) earned $5m more than the lowest paid woman of the 
female list of 10 (Indian star Deepika Padukone – $10m).

The lists also suggest older women are discriminated against when it comes to 
pay. Of the top male earners, 95% are over 40, compared to half of the women. 
Ford, at 74, is the oldest actor on both lists. The ages of the female stars 
are not listed on the Forbes press release, but Lawrence, 26, is the youngest.

Earlier this year Johnson, whose family struggled to pay rent when he was a 
teenager 
<http://fortune.com/2014/10/30/dwayne-johnson-best-advice-entertainment-star/>, 
reacted to the news that he wasthe highest paid actor on Forbes’s Celebrity 100 
list <http://www.forbes.com/celebrities/#34189d124d32> by taking to Instagram 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BHzZW_WDHIA/?hl=en>, writing that his pay packet 
was “an anchoring reminder to continue to work even harder”. Lawrence, the 
daughter of a construction worker and a children’s camp manager, doesn’t have a 
social media presence and has not made a statement about her pay.

Forbes publishes the figures in a week when a new study by the Institute for 
Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies> (IFS) found 
that women in the UKare on average earning 18% less than men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/23/gender-pay-gap-average-18-per-cent-less-uk-women>
 in similar jobs. Despite dealing with some of the world’s best-paid artists, 
the issues they raise are relevant to everyone, said Sam Smethers, the chief 
executive of the women’s rights charity The Fawcett Society.

“This isn’t just a story about women at the top, it’s about women in every 
sector, at every level,” she said. “It reminds us all that it’s a structural 
problem we’re dealing with. It can happen to anyone. It can certainly happen to 
some of the biggest stars in the business. It helps to draw attention to the 
issue and that will keep the pressure on.

“The thing we have to remember though is that there are millions of women who 
are earning average salaries or less and will think, ‘What has this got to do 
with me?’ It’s important that we think about how to keep the focus on those 
women, although we want all women to be fairly paid.”

The lists, which show the actors’ earnings pre-tax and before the deduction of 
management fees, were produced by Forbes using data from Nielsen, Box Office 
Mojo and IMDb and interviews with agents, managers and lawyers. They are 
published at a time when female stars are becoming less hesitant in publicly 
criticising the entertainment industry for unfair pay. In May, House of Cards 
star Robin Wright told an audience at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York 
that she hadthreatened bosses at Netflix with going public 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/robin-wright-fight-equal-pay-house-of-cards>
 unless she was paid the same as her male co-star, Kevin Spacey. In the same 
month, Mad Max: Fury Road star Charlie Theron, number six on this year’s list,
spoke about her experience 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/charlize-theron-unequal-pay> of 
campaigning for the same pay as her co-star The Huntsman: Winter’s War, Chris 
Hemsworth.

Male stars are typically less likely to be asked about the pay disparity and 
comment on the issue less frequenly. Among the few is Tom Hiddleston, who in 
October last yeartold the Guardian that equal pay for women in film should be 
“signed, sealed, delivered”

Melissa McCarthy’s pay wouldn’t place her in the male top 10 but it would 
actually see her in the eighth position. This has been corrected.
