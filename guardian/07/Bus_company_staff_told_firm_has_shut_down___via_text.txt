More than 300 workers at a bus company in north Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> have been made redundant – by text 
message.

GHA Coaches, one of the UK’s largest independent operators, told staff via 
their mobile phones on Wednesday that the company “will cease trading tonight”.

The company promised to pay all outstanding wages but is now in the hands of 
the administrators, Grant Thornton. Jason Bell, one of the administrators, said 
it would “explore all options in terms of bringing any part of the business 
back to life”.

Keith Ottley, a 55 year old former GHA employee from Wrexham, told the Daily 
Post in North Wales 
<http://www.dailypost.co.uk/business/business-news/gha-coaches-shocking-text-told-11612952>
: “It’s terrible. I’ve been here 25 years and for someone to call you last 
night from outside the depot to say the company has gone bust, it’s not nice.”

This is the second bus company to close in Wales with Pembrokeshire-based 
Silcox collapsing last month with 40 job losses. Wrexham, Flintshire and other 
local councils have been putting on some replacement school and other buses. 
But the BBC reported that only four of 28 public bus services formerly provided 
by GHA were currently in operation.

GHA controlled around 230 vehicles but had struggled to make money and was 
faced with a winding up order from the HMRC over unpaid taxes. The company’s 
phone line was not being answered and directors were unavailable for comment.

Susan Elan Jones, MP for Clwyd South, told the Post that many of her 
constituents have been left stranded as result of the company’s failure: “While 
our local councils are acting to provide alternatives, I offer my full support 
to the affected employees at such a difficult, uncertain time.”

A Welsh government spokesman said it was aware of the GHA problem and the risk 
to jobs. It was working with local authorities to minimise disruption for 
passengers in the area, it said.
