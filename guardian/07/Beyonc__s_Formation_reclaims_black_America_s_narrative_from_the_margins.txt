On Saturday night, I sent a group text to several friends as we were on our 
way to meet for drinks. It consisted solely of a screen capture from Beyoncé’s 
new video for Formation and the words: “We must discuss this shit.”

Everyone knew exactly what I was talking about.

My best friend’s answer: “Did Beyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> just make a statement about the 
black feminine body defeating the police state?”

Formation. Photograph: YouTube 
Formation is both provocation and pleasure; inherently political and a deeply 
personal look at the black and queer bodies who have most often borne the brunt 
of our politics. All shapes and shades of black bodies are signaled here and 
move – dare we say “forward”? – in formation. Even the song’s title is 
subversive, winking at how we have constructed our identities from that which 
we were even allowed to call our own.

Formation isn’t Beyoncé’s first foray into the political but, in her latest 
collaboration with director Melinda Matouskas (who hasdirected eight of 
Beyoncé’s videos since 2007 
<http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/complete-guide-to-beyonces-formation.html>), 
Beyonce’s narrative and aesthetic comes in sharp relief. The video articulates 
multiple identities of southern blackness, while social critiques of the 
nation’s crimes against its darker skinned citizens acts as ballast.

Bookended by the flooding of the city of New Orleans after 2005’s Hurricane 
Katrina – and by which the city’s black residents were disproportionately 
affected – and a black child in a hoodie dancing opposite a police line and a 
quick cut to graffiti words “stop shooting us”, Beyoncé morphs into several 
archetypical southern black women.

The potency of Formation doesn’t come from its overt politics: it comes from 
the juxtaposition of lyric with the images, which organically present black 
humanity in ways we’ve haven’t seen frequently represented in popular art or 
culture.

There is in it a litany of blackness, of what we love, of our diverse selves, 
of our intersections – class, sexuality and gender – woven so neatly in the 
visual that the lyrics and music seem secondary, but are intrinsic to 
communicating this celebration of southern fried blackness. Even Beyoncé 
retells her own history and by extension, marries the contradictions of black 
identity in her declaration: “My daddy Alabama, Mama Louisiana. You mix that 
Negro with that Creole make a Texas bama” – an insult that, perhaps, only 
Beyoncé was ever capable of reclaiming.

Beyoncé’s use of “slay” is an additional embrace of the language of the black 
queer community and, in its repetition, it’s an incantation that can slay 
haters, slay patriarchy, to slay white supremacy.

Photograph: YouTube 
Formation is a protest and celebration, concerned with and in love with the 
very particular paradox of the black American identity and experience. The 
images, which are deeply layered and particular to a black Southern vernacular 
and aesthetic, beg to be catalogued: Creole and Black American, Mardi Gras 
Indian, crawfish, Black cowboys, wig shops, socks and slippers, corsets and 
parasols, parades, high school basketball, step team moves, bounce queens Big 
Freedia and Messy Mya, cotillions, “twirl on dem haters”, braids, “bama”, black 
spirituality (church and hoodoo, maybe even a nod to Mami Wata), black mama 
side eyes, drawls, Blue Ivy black girl magic fierceness.

 south; it’s my granny, grandaddy, auntie, uncle, cousin south. It is us, it’s 
for us, and it’s not concerned if white people understand.

I can’t help, while watching and re-watching Formation, being reminded of this 
Nina Simoneinterview 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99V0mMNf5fo&feature=youtu.be>, in which she 
defines her role as an artist aligned with activism and black cultural 
aesthetics.

I think what you are trying to ask is why am I so insistent in giving out to 
them that blackness that black power that black … pushing them to identify with 
black culture. I think that’s what you’re asking … my job is to somehow make 
them curious enough or persuade them by hook or crook to get more aware of 
themselves and where they came from and what they are into and what is already 
there and just to bring it out. This is what compels me to compel them.

In this spirit, Formation compels its viewers to acknowledge the beautiful 
complexity of history, culture and customs, with levity and passion. It compels 
us to reclaim the black American narrative from its margin and make it center.

These representations of black life are critical renderings of the range of 
our humanity, and they seem so unique here – as they did in Kendrick Lamar’s
offering <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY>last year – because we 
are so underrepresented in our beauty and diversity in television and film. 
(One notable exception is the documentary The B.E.A.T., from which Beyoncé and 
director Matouskas sourced some of their New Orleans footagewith permission of 
the Sundance Channel 
<https://www.thefader.com/2016/02/07/beyonce-formation-video-documentary-footage-credit>
, whichowns the rights 
<http://www.lovebscott.com/news/beyonce-director-malina-matsoukas-accused-of-stealing-footage-used-in-formation-video-but-they-didnt>
. They later thanked the directors publicly and noted that they were credited 
appropriately for the footage.)

But the politics were not an afterthought for Beyoncé: the date of the release 
of this work can’t be ignored, given that February is Black History Month in 
the US. Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans have already begun. More to the 
point, last Friday would have been the 21st birthday of Trayvon Martin, killed 
by George Zimmerman in 2012 in a shooting widely attributed to racism; Sunday 
would have been the 29th birthday of Sandra Bland, whose alleged suicide in 
prison in 2015 after a brutal and poorly justified arrest captured on camera 
led to unsuccessful calls for further investigation into her death.

Both were considered formative moments for the women and gay men who have been 
at the forefront of Black Lives Matter and, more broadly, the movement for 
black lives.

Formation as a work of popular art is clever in its acknowledgment of the 
labor of black women as soldiers and leaders in social justice movements, even 
though popular culture has been more interested in the role of men and of male 
performing artists – likeUsher <http://chains.tidal.com/>, Kendrick Lamar, 
Common, Pharell, J Cole, and John Legend,Run The Jewels 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJJyKlRxyvA> – in the wider conversation and 
activism around the crisis of police violence and black community.

But the image of black women synchronizing their bodies in dance juxtaposed 
with the lyric, “You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation” 
is signifier for many of black women who have felt ignored and marginalized in 
their own movement. Beyoncé’s almost exclusive use of black women and black 
queer bodies in Formation underscores the gender inequity of the visibility of 
black lives lost to violence (and the movement dedicated to eradicating it), in 
which the pain and death to which black women and black queer and transgender 
people are subjected, become invisible and subordinate to black cisgender men 
and the white gaze.

Formation exists in a canon of black protest art and may now formally align 
Beyoncé with other black artists who have supported and boosted social justice 
movements by black Americans. (Tidal, the music service owned by Beyoncé’s 
husband Jay Z that currently has the exclusive sales rights to Formation,
announced a $1.5m donation to Black Lives Matter and related charities 
<http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6867174/tidal-donating-15-million-black-lives-matter-social-nonprofit-groups>
 on Friday.)

Beyoncé’s work shows that revolution can be beautiful; protest and celebration 
are not contradictions when imagining a black future that isn’t overrun by 
images of black pain and death. In the video’s concluding sequence, the black 
child in a hoodie “gets light <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDb4FJr10xo>”; 
his dance is a challenge to, but still in dialogue with, a police line in 
formation. His dance concludes as he raises his hands up in surrender; the 
police line raises their hands up in response. (Should the message be unclear, 
a quick cut to a graffiti wall with the words “stop shooting us”.)

And then, tantamount to a sacrifice, Beyoncé, using the weight of her own 
body, sinks a police patrol car into the flood waters to birth a new future.
Women <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> and children can bring 
that future to pass, it says; maybe, it’s saying, only women and children can.
