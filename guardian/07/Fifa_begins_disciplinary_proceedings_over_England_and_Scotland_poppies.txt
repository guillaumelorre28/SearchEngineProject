Fifa has commenced disciplinary proceedings against England and Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland> for wearing armbands featuring 
poppies on Armistice Day.

The issue sparked a national debate when Fifa indicated that wearing the 
symbol would be in contravention of its rules relating to the display of 
political symbols. The English and Scottish FAs said they planned to wear the 
armbands regardless for theWorld Cup qualifier at Wembley last Friday, which 
England won 3-0

.

“We think they’re interpreting the rules wrongly. This is a law-of-the-game 
issue, not a Fifa competition issue,” said the FA chief executiveMartin Glenn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/martin-glenn> last week in the wake of 
the game.

“So, I’m very confident that our legal position’s right, our moral position’s 
certainly right, and – you know what – there are bigger things in the game for
Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> to worry about,” Glenn said.

“We’ll contest it strongly because we believe – we’ve had QC opinion on this – 
our case is absolutely rock solid.”

Fifa had said it was waiting to see whether its match commissioner reported 
the matter to its disciplinary panel. On Thursday, a spokesman confirmed that a 
disciplinary procedure had been opened.

“We can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened on this 
matter,” said the spokesman. “Please understand we cannot comment further at 
this stage nor speculate on any outcome or provide an estimated timeline.”

Theoretically, Fifa could dock points from both teams but a fine is considered 
by far the more likely outcome if any sanction is applied. The FA had 
previously received permission to wear armbands with poppies on for a friendly 
against Spain in 2011, but the entire leadership of Fifa has changed since then 
in the wake of awide-ranging corruption scandal

. Wales opted against wearing the poppy symbol in their World Cup qualifier 
against Serbia on Saturday, saying that they could not take the risk of a 
sanction.

Fifa had also earlier opened proceedings against the Republic of Ireland for 
wearing shirts marking 100 years since the Easter Rising

 for a friendly against Switzerland in March.
