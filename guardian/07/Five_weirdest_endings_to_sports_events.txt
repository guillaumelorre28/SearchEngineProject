Games Three and Four of the 2013 World Series ended in strange, to say the 
least, circumstances. The St Louis Cardinalswon Game Three with an incredibly 
rare obstruction call 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/27/obstruction-call-cardinals-world-series-game-three-red-sox>
, whilethe Boston Red Sox won Game Four with a walk-off pickoff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/28/boston-red-sox-tie-world-series-st-louis-cardinals>
, not such a rare play, but unique in World Series game-ending circumstances.

This prompted us to consider the strangest ends to sporting events:

Devon Loch, Grand National 1956

The Queen Mother's horse Devon Loch was well fancied to win the 1956 Grand 
National and with just a few lengths to go looked a clear winner when suddenly 
and inexplicably the horse jumped, landed on its stomach and was overtaken by 
E.S.B. Devon Loch's rider was Dick Francis, who went on to become a famed 
thriller and crime writer.

The Play, California Golden Bears vs Stanford Cardinal, 1982

With four seconds remaining, Stanford had taken a 20-19 lead but then a 
kick-off return featuring five lateral passes earned the Golden Bears a 
controversial, game-winning touchdown. Not least because the Stanford Band was 
already on the field celebrating the victory. The incident became known as The 
Play.

Cella Renda vs Paul Samuels, 2009

Middleweights Cella Renda and Paul Samuels were in the second round of their 
bout when both connected with left hooks. Both hit the canvas. It wasn't quite 
the end though, as both beat the count. The referee stopped the fight in the 
next round, giving victory to the 36-year-old Samuel.

Alex Bogomolov vs Bradley Klahn, 2013

Alex Bogomolov was trailing American Bradley Klahn 2-1 in the third and final 
set at the Nielsen USTA ProTennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> 
Championship, Winnetka, when he just decided to stop playing. Had there been a 
call of "out" from the stands? Was that enough reason to give up?
