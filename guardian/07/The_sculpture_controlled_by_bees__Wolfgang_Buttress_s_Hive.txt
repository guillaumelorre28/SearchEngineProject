“My approach to a sculpture seeks to frame nature so one can experience it 
more intimately,” says British artist Wolfgang Buttress, whose 17-metre high
Hive installation 
<http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/explore/attractions/hive> opens at the 
Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, in London on Saturday. “I want visitors to feel 
enveloped, wrapped-up and involved in the experience, rather than adopting the 
position of an external observer.”

Its 170,000 pieces of aluminium, suspended from the ground, appear as a 
twisting swarm of bees from afar, but as you come closer it becomes a hive-like 
structure of latticework whose low humming sound and hundreds of flickering LED 
lights draws you in to a multi-sensory instillation. The intensity of sound and 
light is controlled by the vibrations of honeybees in an actual hive at Kew 
that is connected to the sculpture.

Honeybees communicate primarily with each other through vibrations. By biting 
a wooden stick connected to a conductor, visitors to the Hive can get a sense 
of four types of vibrational messages through the bones in their head. These 
include the tooting and quacking signals that virgin queen bees make when they 
challenge each other in a display of strength to determine who will be the 
queen of the hive; begging, when a bee requests food from another another; and 
the waggle dance which communicates the location of a good food source.

No-one outside of a research laboratory will have had the opportunity to 
experience these bee messages which form part of pioneering work into honeybee 
communication being conducted by Martin Bencsik, a reader in physics at 
Nottingham Trent University.

Buttress, from Nottingham, originally conceived the Hive as the centrepiece of 
the UK Pavilion at the2015 Milan Expo  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/the-uk-pavilion-at-milan-expo-2015>
after researching the well-publicised decline of bees and stumbling across 
Bencsik’s research. It integrates architecture, art and design with science and 
the environment.

A one-acre wild flower meadow planted with 34 native species, including 
clovers and cornflowers, and a few later flowering cultivated varieties 
surrounds the Hive at Kew, along with 65 metres of native hedging.

When in bloom, the idea is that the buzzing of wild bees, of which 50 species 
have been identified at Kew feeding on the flowers, will greet the visitor as 
they walk along a path to the upper level of The Hive where an oculus connects 
the structure with the sky and the elements (unlike the dark, dry cavity where 
honeybees live).

Created and built by engineers Simmonds Studio, architectural practice BDP and 
York-based Stage One, the £6m Hive won the gold-medal for best pavilion at the 
Milan Expo, whose theme was feeding the planet.

With bees pollinating 70 of the most important crops that we eat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/why-are-bees-important>, 
including most fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, as they collect the nectar 
and pollen from the crops’ flowers, Buttress says he wanted to highlightthe 
significance of pollinators to our existence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/decline-of-bees-poses-potential-risks-to-major-crops-says-un>
. “Bees are highly sensitive creatures and can be seen as sentinels for the 
health of the planet,” he says.

Kew’s director, Richard Deverell, said the Hive is a “great way to tell the 
story about the relationship between plants and insects”. For that reason, he 
says the botanical gardens are the perfect new home for a structure that allows 
us: “to explore the urgent issues we face in relation to pollinators, their 
intimate relationships with plants and their vital role in helping us feed a 
rapidly growing population”.

Kew receives 45% of its funding from the UK government, which was against an 
EU ban in 2013 on neonicitinoid pesticides shown to be harmful to bees. The UK 
alsogranted a temporary lifting of the ban in 2015

Deverell says he hopes the Hive - the first UK Pavilion to be reused and 
brought back to Britain after an Expo - will attract a different audience to 
Kew, which had1.6m visitors last year, making it the 15th most visited 
attraction in the UK <http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423>. Kew has spent 
two year’s worth of its events and festival budget on the structure, which is 
hosting talks, tours and trails throughout its 18 months in residence.

 The thoughtful Buttress says he wants the Hive to reconnect people with 
nature. “I opened a bee hive for the first time two years ago and it gave me a 
different outlook on life and how humans are connected to nature. We are in 
danger of losing that vitally important connection, especially in cities.”

The Hive’s meditative soundtrack of a 40,000-strong honeybee colony, along 
with instruments and the human voice, created by members of the band 
Spiritualized, has beennamed as one of the Guardian’s best albums of 2016 so far
