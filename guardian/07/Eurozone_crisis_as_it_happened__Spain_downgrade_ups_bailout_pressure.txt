European markets close higher after US jobless figures

Investors have paid more attention to better than expected US weekly jobs 
claims that the Standard & Poor's downgrade of Spain and the continuing 
uncertainty about a possible bailout request from the country.

So European markets have ended higher, albeit after three days of decline.

•The FTSE 100 is up 53.04 points at 5829.75, up 0.92%

• Germany's Dax is 1.06% better

• France's Cac has climbed 1.42%

• Spain's Ibex is up 0.87%

• Italy's FTSE MIB has finished 1.26% higher

Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 40 points at the 
moment.

And on that note, it's time to end the blog for another day. Thanks for all 
your comments and we'll be back tomorrow.

Look to Switzerland, Europe, says Black Swan author

What is the solution to the eurozone crisis? It should become more like 
Switzerland. That's according to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the Black 
Swan. Hesays

:

The most stable country in the history of mankind, and probably the most 
boring, by the way, is Switzerland. It's not even a city-state environment; 
it's a municipal state. Most decisions are made at the local level, which 
allows for distributed errors that don't adversely affect the wider system. 
Meanwhile, people want a united Europe, more alignment, and look at the 
problems. The solution is right in the middle of Europe -- Switzerland. It's 
not united! It doesn't have a Brussels! It doesn't need one.

From below the line <http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/4757045>:

in addition to sending flowers, we could do the following:

The regulars here will well and fondly remember many of Barz' postings. We 
would like to collect the most poignant, typical, telling postings, send them 
to the family (they have said that they would like to collect texts from his 
friends and read them at the funeral).

Some of his own texts dug up and selected by his friends would be a fine 
addition;"this is what you said and that's why we liked you so much and are so 
sorry that you're gone". That's what we are going to do.

The method to use would be the following:
You can access all of barz' postings through this link 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user-comments/barz>. The date-line in the 
postings are direct links to those postings.
Could you please select and collect the postings with their respective links 
and either post them here or mail them to barz@qdh.nl.
As there are 171 pages, we should divide the task. Anybody preparing to start 
this workplease post here the pages you are going to browse through!

As a start I'll reserve pages 1 to 11 for me.

Bank of Greece governor received €3.4m payoff from former employer

Here's something which is likely to irk Greeks struggling to cope with the 
austerity drive. FromReuters 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-greece-bog-provopoulos-idUSBRE89A0OD20121011>

The governor of the Bank of Greece was given a severance payment of €3.4m when 
he left his former employer, a major bank that he now regulates, documents seen 
by Reuters show.

George Provopoulos was awarded the sum when he stepped down as vice-chairman 
of Piraeus Bank to become governor of Greece's central bank and a member of the 
board of the European Central Bank in 2008. The scale of the pay-off, 
previously unknown to most Greeks, is likely to prove controversial, amounting 
to nearly €2.8m ($3.6 million) after tax.

Could Germany fall into recession?

There is a "great danger" it could if the eurozone crisis does not ease, 
according to Germany's top economic institutes.

At the same time they hit out at the ECB's plan to buy bonds of the weaker 
eurozone states - step forward Spain for one - saying it could stoke inflation. 
Reutersreported 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-germany-institutes-idUSBRE89A0PS20121011>
:

Concerns about the ECB program are broadly based in Germany 
<http://www.reuters.com/places/germany>, where fears about rising prices have 
been rooted in the national psyche since hyperinflation in the 1920s, which 
some argue helped bring the Nazis to power less than 10 years later.

Der Spiegel magazine cashed in on this unease, carrying an image of a melting 
euro coin on its front page accompanied by the headline: "Warning, inflation! 
The creeping expropriation of Germans' wealth."

Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's Bundesbank, was the only member of the 
ECB's Governing Council to vote against a program he considers tantamount to 
financing governments by printing banknotes.

The institutes said it broke the taboo of financing states and increased the 
danger of inflation in the medium term.

"The ECB's decision could shake the main pillar of the currency union, namely 
the goal of price stability," they said in their twice-yearly analysis.

The institutes, whose analysis influences government forecasts, also said they 
expected subdued economic growth.

They halved their growth expectations for next year to 1.0 percent and cut 
their forecast for this year by 0.1 percentage points to 0.8 percent.

But those forecasts assumed the euro zone's crisis would ease and investors 
regain confidence, and there was "a great danger that Germany will fall into a 
recession," they said.

Stock markets continue to gain ground after US jobless claims

Stock markets are increasing their gains despite what you would have thought 
would be the negative news of S&P's Spanish downgrade.

It appears to be the better than expected US weekly jobless claims 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2012/oct/11/spain-downgrade-s-and-p-bailout?commentpage=5#block-5076bd3dc0e361310bc6cc2d>
 which are encouraging investors to turn positive, even though some seem to 
believe the figures are too good to be true.

Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently nearly 75 points 
higher, the FTSE 100 is up 1.1%, Germany's Dax is 1.3% better and France's Cac 
has climbed 1.5%. Even Spain's Ibex is up 1.15% and Italy's FTSE MIB has added 
1.3%. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads said:

Fiinally some good news for equity markets and a reversal in the recent trend 
which had been building gradually to the extent that it almost felt like we 
would never see a rally again!

Today it was the weekly initial jobless claims from across the pond that was 
the main catalyst for the gains. It is yet another piece of evidence that the 
US economy may not be in such bad shape after all and European markets welcomed 
the data, reversing most of the losses accumulated in the past few days.

Often markets will move in the direction you least expect and today is a 
classic example of that. Spain’s credit rating downgrade has only served to 
fuel speculation that the government will request a bailout soon, which allowed 
the yield on their 10 year bond to retreat and this will always lend a hand to 
the bulls. The rally does come with a word of warning however as volumes were 
woefully thin, so we would have to see this move to the upside go further to be 
confident that all the sellers have been shaken out.

EC president warns not to mix eurozone budget idea with existing talks

EC president Herman Van Rompuy said the idea of a separate eurozone budget - 
in addition to the existing EU-wide one - was one worth looking at.

Speaking at the Friends of Europe conference, he also seemed to fire a shot 
across the bows of UK prime minister David Cameron. Cameron is in favour of a 
eurozone budget, but those who see it as a longer term project are concerned he 
will drag it into forthcoming negotiations over the existing budget, due to 
start in November. Van Rompuysaid in his speech <http://t.co/2ADQxzHU>:

I want to clear out any confusion: this [eurozone budget idea] must not to be 
mixed up with the European Union's multiannual budget. Since we decide on the 
Multiannual Financial Framework in November, it is important that we don't 
start mixing that discussion up with this embryonic idea of a fiscal capacity.

Today's report is encouraging as it marks a solid improvement in the labour 
market. However, we wouldn't see it as a sign of a sustainable upward trend in 
job creation.

We remain cautious on the development of the labour market. First of all, 
claims have been very volatile in the past couple of months and we cannot rule 
out next week's figures will correct the sharp decline seen today. In addition, 
we need to bear in mind that the US economy remains well below potential. As 
such, a rapid improvement in the labour market can be ruled out near term.

City regulator calls for eurozone to stop backsliding

European leaders have to stop backsliding on recapitalising banks and on 
setting up a banking union, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority 
has said.

Ahead of a speech tonight at the Mansion House Adair Turner, one of those 
vying to succeed Sir Mervyn King as Bank of England governor, has said the 
eurozone needs to forge stronger ties to prevent disintegration.

In an interview 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/exclusive-fsas-turner-calls-on-europes-leaders-to-save-single-currency-8206939.html>
 with the London Evening Standard, he called for the introduction of eurobonds 
and mutualised bank deposit insurance - both measures opposed by Germany. He 
said:

We have a very strong national interest in them either resolving a successful 
eurozone or breaking up in a smooth rather than chaotic fashion and if they are 
going to make it successful they need to go very strongly towards greater 
integration, mutual deposit insurance, banking supervision and some category of 
joint eurobonds. Without such measures the eurozone will not survive with its 
current membership.

Inflation falls in Ireland as Paddy Power unveils further jobs

Falling inflation and job creation have provided some good news for the Irish 
economy. Henry McDonald writes:

Irish bookmaker chain Paddy Power has created 600 new jobs in Dublin which 
will be filled by the end of 2015.

The jobs boost to the Irish capital on the same day as news that inflation 
fell to 1.6% in Ireland last month.

Paddy Power's expansion will be focused on e-commerce, social media and 
on-line aspects of the business although their new target market will be in the 
international betting market.

The announcement will bring total employment by Paddy Power to 2,783 in the 
Republic. The bookmaker, which has hired 189 people as part of its expansion 
programme since April.

Coming just 24 hours after the Kerry food group announced a further 800 jobs, 
the new on-line posts at Paddy Power demonstrate that Ireland still has an 
energetic export sector.

Domestic demand however remains in the doldrums and despite today's Central 
Statistics Office report of falling inflation, pressure on consumers is likely 
to intensify with a rise in mortgage costs and further tax increases in this 
December's austerity budget.

More signs of disagreement between IMF and Germany

Earlier there were some signs of disagreement between the IMF and Germany over 
the way forward for the debt crisis.

The IMF, meeting in Tokyo at the moment, backed the idea of giving Greece and 
Spain more time to reduce their budget deficits. But Germany immediately dug 
its heels in, saying any backtracking would send out the wrong signals. German 
finance ninister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters:

The IMF has time and again said that high public debt poses a problem. So when 
there is a certain medium-term goal, it doesn't build confidence when one 
starts by going in a different direction.

When you want to climb a big mountain and you start climbing down then the 
mountain will get even higher.

11.15am BST 

Here's a take on this morning’s Italian bond auction from Nicholas Spiro of 
Spiro Sovereign Strategy:

Markets are taking S&P’s two-notch downgrade of Spain in their stride and 
continue to perceive the eurozone’s problems as mostly country-specific, thus 
helping Italy differentiate itself from Spain to a greater extent than was the 
case during earlier bouts of risk aversion. However sentiment towards Italy 
remains fragile. The result of today’s auction of 3-year paper, with a slight 
uptick in the yield, shows that the ECB-driven resilience of the country’s debt 
market is being put to the test. The good news is that demand was a tad 
stronger, helping the Treasury hit the top end of its target for the bond.

Right now, Italy’s bond market is passing one of its most important tests 
since the crisis struck in July 2011: mounting uncertainty about another 
eurozone country - this time Spain - is not being reflected in yields on 
Italian paper. This is entirely due to the “Draghi effect”. The 
yet-to-be-launched OMT programme has sharply reduced the “reversibility 
premium” in Spanish and Italian bond yields, thereby significantly diminishing 
the effects of contagion. The key factor behind the rise in Italian yields over 
the past year or so has, for the time being at least, been practically 
eliminated.

The key question going forward is whether Italy’s debt market will come under 
increased strain because of growing uncertainty about Spain. There’s a 
significant risk that Madrid is not going to apply for a bond-buying programme 
any time soon. It appears that the markets will have to force Spain’s hand 
which is not something that Italy’s debt managers are keen to see happen.

10.46am BST 

Spain's banking bailout bill may rise further

While all eyes are on Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and the timing of 
his expected bailout request, problems at the country’s banks mean the separate 
bill for bailing out Spanish banks may rise further. Giles Tremlett in Madrid 
writes:

The government said it expected to ask for €40bn of the €100bn on offer from 
euro zone partners for banks, but that depended on two mergers going through. 
One of those involved Ibercaja, which has now pulled out. The result? Part of 
the €6bn that consultants Oliver Wyman said could be saved by mergers and by 
various tax manoeuvres will disappear.

Ratings agency Fitch, meanwhile, has warned that Novacaixagalicia (NCG), a 
nationalised savings banks, may still have to be wound up.

“Because of the bank’s problems and high recapitalisation needs, there is 
heightened risk that an orderly resolution could take place,” it says. “This 
could include a recapitalisation plan for NCG’s future sale, but also 
alternative scenarios that, even if customer depositors are fully compensated 
as the agency would expect, could still qualify as some form of default or 
‘restricted default’ .”

Fitch still thinks it more likely that Spain’s FROB bank restructuring fund 
will continue to support NCG, but the risk of liquidation is obviously there.

Italian yields rise in latest bond auction

The Spanish downgrade by S&P has helped push up Italy's yields in its latest 
three-year bond auction.

The country sold its targeted amount of €3.75bn but the yield rose from 2.75% 
a month ago to 2.86%. Still, it has now covered 80% of its borrowing needs for 
this year. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy was not too concerned:

The higher yields simply reflect the recent volatility in EMU periphery's

just one level above junk. As yet, however, 10 yr yields are still below 6% and 
well under the summers’ peak near 7.56%. There is a widely held perception in 
the market that yields will have to rise in order the frog-march the Spanish 
government into requesting a bailout.

The fact that this view is so widely held is a problem because it means that 
investors are less likely to display the lemming like behaviour required to 
force yields higher. In turn this means that assistance for Spain could be 
delayed further and Europe’s economic woes may have longer to fester.

From an economic point of view the sooner the bail-out happens the better 
since Spain could get on with the business of trying to repair its stricken 
finances. From a political point on view, however, a bail-out request would be 
humiliating for Rajoy’s government to the extent that perhaps he cannot request 
aid until he is forced to by market tensions. 

For Northern European governments also a bail-out request for Spain would be 
an easier sell to respective electorates if it had to be done to alleviate 
market tension. The only problem is that too many people are aware of this 
pattern.

Investors will be asking themselves whether it is wise to sell Spanish bonds 
now if in a matter of weeks the ECB’s OMT scheme will be triggered and yields 
will come crashing down. The result is the current stalemate situation where 
the OMT cannot yet be triggered because there is no request from Spain, but 
where the Spanish government cannot make the request because market pressure is 
not adequate.

Greek unemployment hits new record in July

Air raid sirens went off this morning in Greece in a test run by the public 
order ministry - as if people weren't nervous enough.

Meanwhile Greek unemployment has reached a new record in July, rising for the 
35th month in a row. It has now hit 25.1% from June's 24.8%, itself revised 
upwards.

Financial Stability Board to look at oil and gold benchmarks

Over at the IMF in Tokyo, the Financial Stability Board 
<http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/about/overview.htm> has said that in 
the wake of the Libor scandal, it is looking into the way other benchmarks are 
set - including oil and gold.

The news came as Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney gave an overview of the 
FSB's work (he is the chairman). Our economics correspondent Phillip Inman 
writes:

The FSB says it is getting to grips with fashioning a new global financial 
system that works better than the one before the crash, but the only result it 
can really trumpet is that the world's systemically important banks are safe. 
Apparently it has verified that they all have enough capital to withstand 
another shock without tapping taxpayers.

That said, he admitted many banks are in a parlous state, repeating a warning 
given by IMF bossChristine Lagarde 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/christine-lagarde> that some regulators fear 
the banks in their jurisdiction are still in a bad way and probably not much 
better than before the financial crash of 2008. Mostly, they are talking about 
banks in the eurozone.

Carney said the board was monitoring the shadow banking sector, which many 
analysts believe made the financial sector unstable ahead of the crash.

He said the board was also assessing a raft of financial benchmarks used in 
trading following the Libor scandal (Libor was used to set benchmark interest 
rates for commodities and swaps trading as well as domestic mortgages). Svein 
Andresen, secretary general of the FSB said later that other benchmarks 
included the price setting mechanisms for oil and gold.

There have long been speculation that these markets are fixed by a small 
number of banks that effectively control trading by setting benchmark prices.

Carney refused to say whether he applied to be Bank of England governor, 
despite being widely tipped for the job.

More on Greece where further snags to any agreement appear to be emerging,

The government and the troika are reportedly arguing over a €555m dividend due 
to be paid to Greece by its banks by the end of the year. This is the payout on 
preference shares the state owns after a 2008 capital reconstruction.

But the troika believe paying the dividend means more money will be needed in 
a future recapitalisation of the banks, and the payout should be stopped.

Of course, not paying it leaves the government even shorter of cash itself.

Full story here at the online version of Greek newspaper Kathimerini.

Talks restart between Greek government and troika inspectors

Over in Greece, talks have resumed between the coalition government and EU, 
ECB and IMF officials representing the country’s troika of creditors. Our 
correspondent Helena Smith writes:

Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras says he wants to conclude 
negotiations by the upcoming EU summit on October 18. “We will hold talks every 
day until then,” said one of his aides.

But efforts to finally seal the draconian €13.5bn package of budget cuts -- 
the price of a €31.5bn aid installment – are likely to be bumpy. Last night, as 
the talks resumed after a two-day pause for this week’s euro group meeting, 
Greek officials were forced to admit a new budget “black hole” thanks to 
industrial action by tax collectors that has caused revenues to drop by around 
€500m this year.

Athens is also under intense pressure to fulfill 89 “prior actions” – policy 
steps that German chancellor Angela Merkel has made clear would need to be 
implemented – before the summit.

Spanish bond yields rise after S&P downgrade

It's no surprise that Spanish bond yields have moved higher in the wake of 
Standard & Poor's downgrading the country's credit rating to BBB minus with a 
negative outlook. 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2012/oct/11/spain-downgrade-s-and-p-bailout#block-50766d0358f91d7bbadac2e5>

Spain's 10-year yields have risen by 10 basis points to 5.928% as traders 
reported selling by investors whose portfolios are linked to rating levels. 
This level is well below July's high of 7.8% but the move puts Spain's 
government in a tricky spot. It had been stressing it did not need a bailout 
while its yields were falling. Now the strain looks like it's back on.

Italy too is under pressure, with its yields up nearly 5 basis points to 5.156%

There's a more mixed reaction among stock markets.

Spain's Ibex is down nearly 1% and Italy's FTSE MIB has fallen 0.65%

But the FTSE 100 is up 0.25%, Germany's Dax has risen 0.15% and France's Cac 
has climbed 0.1%.

Friends Reunited

The Friends of Europe <http://www.friendsofeurope.org/>, or or Les Amis de 
l’Europe, looks like an interesting organisation - but I do wonder if numbers 
will be down on last year?

They will be holding roundtable discussions on a number of thorny topics 
today, and the programme includes:

“Europe’s place in a globalised world: keeping up with the new kids on the 
block” plus a “high-level brainstorming” on options for closer economic, 
monetary and political union and global economy.

This evening there is a dinner with Italian prime minister Mario Monti as 
guest of honour.

And with that, I'm passing the baton on to my colleague Nick Fletcher.

“Junked if you do, junked if you don’t,” said Gary Jenkins of Swordfish 
Research. That’s one of the many dilemmas facing the Spanish government, he 
said, noting that S&P’s comment that the government's “hesitation” in 
requesting a bailout is “potentially raising the risks to Spain’s rating”.

However, Moody’s has stated that any request for a bailout would result in a 
junk rating “so it would appear that when it comes to the rating Spain is a bit 
between a rock and a hard place".

If we take the agencies at their word we can expect Spain to be at best a 
crossover credit going into next year; indeed let us go further and assume for 
a moment that they try and avoid a bailout. That would mean that they would 
need to raise over €200bn in 2013 from the market as a BB+ / Baa3 credit. Not 
easy to raise that kind of money with that kind of rating when the economic 
data is likely to come in worse than government forecasts. So a bailout request 
is still the most likely outcome.

Reaction to S&P’s Spanish downgrade

S&P said the downgrade “reflects our view of mounting risks to Spain’s public 
finances, due to rising economic and political pressures. In our view, the 
capacity of Spain’s political institutions (both domestic and multilateral) to 
deal with the severe challenges posed by the current economic and financial 
crisis is declining”.

The move brought S&P into line with Moody’s, which downgraded Spain in June 
and has the country on review for a further downgrade to junk status.

On the foreign exchanges the euro suffered an early slide of 0.5% to $1.2825 
in response, a larger fall than might have been expected given that S&P has 
merely moved into line with Moody’s.

Some early reaction to the Spanish downgrade from Stan Shamu, market 
strategist at IG Markets:

Analysts are starting to feel the Spain downgrade is a positive for markets as 
it might result in a spike in Spanish yields and force Spain’s hand to request 
a bailout. This seems to be what market participants want to see as it would 
activate the OMT* programme.

bonds of the region’s troubled nations

S&P downgrade raises pressure on Spain

Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live> and global 
economy.

Spain will be in focus this morning after ratings agency S&P downgraded the 
country’s credit rating 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/11/downgrade-madrid-bailout> to 
BBB-minus - one notch above junk status - with a “negative outlook.” This ups 
the pressure on prime minster Mariano Rajoy and his government to accept rescue 
funds from Brussels and will certainly give them plenty to talk about at their 
cabinet meeting in a couple of hours’ time.

In Tokyo the International Monetary Fund’s Christine Lagarde has called on 
governments to co-operate to heal the fractured global economy or risk a 
further slowdown in economic growth.

In a speech to the IMF’s annual meeting in Tokyo, she warned that only with 
greater co-operation and courage could governments hope to prevent a repeat of 
the financial crisis.Here’s the full story 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/11/act-bravely-economy-christine-lagarde>
 from economics correspondent Phillip Inman.

Meanwhile the backlash against BAE Systems continues after the collapse of the 
€35bn (£28bn) mega-merger with Airbus maker EADS. German ChancellorAngela 
Merkel is getting quite a bit of the blame 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/10/angela-merkel-bae-eads-merger> 
and we’ll have a roundup of the coverage later.

BAE pushed out a trading statement at 7am 
<http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201210110700044338O>, saying it 
was trading in line with expectations but noting that it faces uncertainty in 
the key US market.
 
 “Uncertainty as to how US federal deficit reduction will be implemented, 
including possible sequestration measures, continues to cloud the outlook for 
the US government defence budget. Some limited trading disruption is likely in 
the last quarter of the 2012 calendar year as the US government operates under 
a Continuing Resolution from 1 October 2012.”

There’s been some encouraging news on the European corporate front this 
morning - the supermarkets group Carrefour has beaten analysts’ expectations 
and says it’s doing well in its home market of France. The world’s 
second-largest retailer, Carrefour is benefitting from strong sales growth in 
Asia and Latin America, particularly Brazil. Sales have slowed in southern 
Europe, which is hardly a surprise, and trading there remains a challenge, the 
group said.
