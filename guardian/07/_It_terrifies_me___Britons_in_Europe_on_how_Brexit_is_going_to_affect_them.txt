British citizens who have chosen to work or spend their retirement years 
elsewhere inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> fear their 
pensions, healthcare and right to remain will disappear post-Brexit.

 “We were not even allowed to vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/25/eu-referendum-voting-rights-not-extended-all-uk-citizens-abroad>
 in the referendum that could turn our lives upside down,” said Denise Hope, a 
retired translator living in Italy. “I feel very bitter about it, as do other 
expats.”

Hope is one of 1.2 million Britons living elsewhere in the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/brexit-britons-abroad-rights-european-union-referendum>
 whose lives have been thrown into disarray by the prospect of Brexit. Rights 
to property and to own a business are protected under international law, but 
automatic reciprocal rights to pensions, education grants and healthcare are 
not.

EU citizens in Britain post Brexit vote: ‘I feel betrayed, not at home, sad’

Up to 20 groups have now sprung up across Europe to campaign for those rights 
to be protected. Some individuals have considered changing nationality but, as 
Jane Golding, a British lawyer living in Germany, said, that too could have 
unforeseen consequences.

Countries such as Spain do not recognise dual nationality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/leave-vote-prompts-rush-dual-nationality-eu-passports>
, so if any of the 300,000 British people registered in the country opt to swap 
their passports will they deny themselves the future right to return to Britain?

Others worry about the value of the state pension, guaranteed under EU law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/10/prices-property-pensions-30-eu-referendum-questions-answered>
, but not post-Brexit, such as Sue Wilson, a leader of the Bremain in Spain 
campaign.

The estimated 450,000 retirees drawing a British state pension from elsewhere 
in the EU have already seen a drop in their income because of the collapse of 
sterling and fear that it could fall further when the UK withdraws.

Under EU law, the pension, is effectively index-linked, said Golding, who is 
campaigning to ensure the rights of UK citizens in the EU andEU citizens in the 
UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/01/eu-citizens-in-britain-post-brexit-vote-feel-betrayed-not-at-home-sad>
. Unless a replacement guarantee is in place when Britain quits the EU, this 
could be frozen, she said, adding: “These rights need to be settled before the
triggering of article 50 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/14/brexit-plan-will-not-be-published-until-february-says-davis>
.”

Healthcare is another thorny issue with different systems across the 
continent. Campaigners have complained that the government barely grasps the 
issue. Expat Citizens Rights in EU (ECREU), a pan-European group, wrote to the 
House of Lords EU justice committee to tell them the government appeared to 
confuse health arrangements for tourists with healthcare for Britons living 
abroad.

Under EU law, UK pensioners are entitled to receive healthcare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu>
 as though they were nationals of that state.

“Without that health support, it may well be the case that great numbers of 
citizens aged over 65, would need to return to the UK. Many could not afford to 
make that return and would become isolated, poor, and even destitute,” said 
ECREU in its submission.

Britons in Ireland are also affected, despite earlier assumptions that they 
would be protected under joint Anglo-Irish laws giving nationals from both 
countries more rights than EU citizens in each other’s countries, including the 
right to vote in general elections.

It emerged in a House of Lords report earlier this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/12/lords-brexit-reports-northern-ireland-uk-irish-relations>
 that while Britain could guarantee the rights of Irish people settled in the 
UK, Ireland will not have the power to reciprocate without the agreement of 
other EU members.

The Department for Exiting the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> declined to say if it was looking at any 
solutions or any potential models to resolve the uncertainty.

“We are determined to deliver the best possible outcome both for people living 
in the UK and for UK nationals living in EU countries, and that is why we are 
preparing for a smooth and orderly exit from the EU and an arrangement that 
works in the mutual interest of both sides,” said a spokeswoman.

 Jo Chipchase thinks Brexit will be a big step backwards for UK 
I was born in Newcastle and have owned a house near Granada for the last 10 
years. My kids, who are nine and 10, are attending a Spanish school, where they 
are doing well both educationally and socially and I worry about the impact on 
their future. They were born EU citizens, I always thought we would be EU 
citizens, and I loathe the idea of that being stripped away.

We don’t qualify for citizenship yet because in Spain you have to be here for 
10 years and my biggest fear is that we would be forced to leave. I don’t want 
to leave because I don’t like the idea of living in England.My family are 
staunch leavers and this has caused a lot of friction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/27/brexit-family-rifts-parents-referendum-conflict-betrayal>
.

My eldest son is a promising goalkeeper on a local football team and they are 
both bilingual. They have settled lives here. Imagine if we had to unwillingly 
start again in the UK, with all those leave voters literally on our doorstep 
telling us to “suck it up” and how “unpatriotic” we are because we lived in 
Spain. Would my boys be picked upon, because they speak fluent Spanish to each 
other? I feel that anything is possible, the way “Brexit Britain” is heading 
with diminishing levels of tolerance and respect towards others. From the 
outside looking in, it is a big step backwards for society.


I don’t think the Spanish will march us off to the nearest port or that they 
will want us to leave because the British are contributing to the economy, 
whether they are retired here or running businesses. But no one knows and when 
you have teenage children it’s terribly worrying.

 Tim Moss fears negotiations will get nasty 
I applied for British-German nationality shortly after the referendum. How do 
I feel about it? I feel terrible. If you had asked me a year ago if I was going 
toapply for German nationality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/give-britons-fast-track-citizenship-says-germanys-green-party>
 I would have laughed in your face. It is not something I ever thought I would 
have to do, but we don’t know how it’s going to play out. It may be fine, but 
I’m not going to rely on that. So on a personal level this is my backup.

What I am very sad about is what this means for future generations of 
academics and researchers, who want to come from Britain to Germany or from 
Germany to Britain. German research institutions are very afraid of Britain 
leaving theEuropean Research Council 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jun/15/excellent-science-in-the-uk-is-at-risk-if-it-votes-for-brexit>
. Britain punches above its weight academically and to get a grant from the ERC 
is the top accolade you can get.

On a more personal level, I have concerns about the uncertainty around 
property and pensions. But the great concern is that we are considered pawns in 
the game. Theresa May has the power to grant these rights straight away and 
eliminate it from the negotiations, which are undoubtedly going to get nasty as 
time goes on.

 Malcolm Perry fears he won’t be able to afford healthcare 
We took the jump after my husband, James, was made redundant. I’m originally 
from Kent and worked for 20 years in learning disability and gave up my job to 
start a new tourism business here in Spain.

Just as our life was getting better, this has happened and it has taken the 
wind from our sails.

We are totally immersed in a small community here, we have a small mortgage 
and if we had to leave, we could never get on to the property ladder again in 
Kent. It would be very difficult to go back into a job for me as I’d have a 
four-year gap in professional development.


We pay social security, our taxes and regional taxes here and have access to 
the healthcare system. We are also paying into the pension system here. When 
Britain leaves the EU we will be in a catch-22 situation. Could we afford 
private healthcare? What will happen to our pension? We don’t know what the 
Spanish government is going to do.

It sounds silly but we also worry what would happen to our dogs? They 
currently haveEuropean pet passports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/28/eu.world>. Would they work in the 
UK? If we do have to return would they be able to come with us?

My big fear is the European Union I’ve grown up in will no longer be there and 
generations of British citizens will miss out.

The discussion about EU citizens being “bargaining chips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/17/nicola-sturgeon-brexit-referendum-eu-nationals-not-bargaining-chips>
” is taking place in the UK vacuum but nowhere else, as far as I can see and 
hear from the French and German press. Theresa May should simply take the moral 
high ground and say she is going to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the 
UK.

Instead of this, British politicians seem to be trying to create a mythical 
European bogeyman who is refusing Britons these rights in Europe. Frankly, from 
my experience and that of other British people here, this is absolutely not the 
case. We feel welcome.

I have held senior positions in a major American global company in Germany, 
Italy, France, the UK, the US and Belgium and am married to a French woman. I 
speak the languages of all the countries in which I have worked and lived. The 
EU and its principles have been a big and positive part of my working life and 
have provided me with freedom of movement, healthcare, and my children’s 
education.

UK's EU workers react to Brexit: 'Britain is a poorer, crueller country'

Our European neighbours have always welcomed us and made us feel at home. I do 
not feel that Brexit will be a problem for me in Germany. There is a tremendous 
openness and welcome for us here.


I have state pensions from every country I have worked in except the UK 
organised by the German social security for me. This would never have happened 
without Europe and the EU. This is one of the EU positives that British 
politicians never tell you about.

For me financial security is not an issue. I am financially better off being 
in Europe, particularly with thedrop in the value of sterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling>, and luckily am not relying on 
a British state pension.

However given the troubled world we currently live in, with its uncertainties 
and political instability, I see Brexit as a hostile act towards the UK’s 
closest friends. As Europeans ourselves we cannot simply turn our backs on our 
fellow Europeans.
I have applied to become a French citizen as a result of Brexit as a matter of 
principle. I feel that someone has stolen my country from me and that this 
tolerant and open country that I know and love has simply lost its way. This is 
not a European problem, it is a British one.

 Kathryn Dobson’s children were educated in French schools 
“We left the UK 14 and a half years ago because my husband and I were both 
facing redundancy. I was offered a post in Geneva and we came to France and 
worked with Procter & Gamble in Switzerland. We had three children aged five, 
three, and under one, and after three years we decided to stay in France and 
try something completely different.

With three children in French schools and having worked in an international 
situation, I saw how beneficial it was having two languages. So my strong 
motivation for staying in France was so my children could be bilingual and 
culturally flexible because we are all EU citizens.

I felt severe shock on 24 June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron>
, as if part of my identity was being forcibly removed. I am nearly 50 and grew 
up in the EU. My family took full advantage of the EU, yet overnight we have 
risked those rights being taken away from us.

On social media, I see people in the UK calling families like us traitors, but 
we came here because there wasn’t work for us in the UK. Our children are now 
19, 17 and 15. My middle daughter has just started university in Rotterdam and 
has received a Dutch grant because she is an EU citizen.

When she applied for her course, we had no idea Brexit would happen. She is 
doing a degree in business studies and forming bonds with 500 other 
international students and many go on to do a masters, but this is now at risk.

We can apply for French citizenship but it takes two years and may not come 
through in time. I also worry that our 15-year-old will not now have the same 
options as her older sister and that they cannot get the life choices as we had 
including as a result offreedom of movement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/freedom-of-movement-eu-uk-brexit-negotiations-theresa-may>
. Brexit is not a personal economic issue for me, it’s about our children – and 
not just mine, but all children and generations to come.

The other big issue for pensioners is whether the state pension will be frozen.

 Denise Hope lives with her 80-year-old husband 
My husband and I have been in Italy since 1998 with a four-year break in 
Germany from 2009. We all feel in a horrible limbo since the referendum. It has 
meant people like us are facing great financial and legal uncertainty. It is 
almost like being an asylum seeker waiting to be told if they can stay.

One solution that we would be content with would be the offer of an 
exceptional accelerated and automatic right to Italian citizenship for British 
expats who already live in Italy. We would have no problem giving up UK 
citizenship if this was a condition.

For pensioners the main issue is the access to health cover, since this 
depends on the reciprocal agreements and, above all, it depends not so much on 
the EU, as on the UK, and specifically on its being prepared to go on paying 
the annual contributions – about €2,800 (£2,350) in the case of Italy – per 
pensioner after Brexit. There is also the issue of the EU health card and 
continued freedom to travel at no notice within the EU without any bureaucracy 
or special insurance. The card is issued by the UK, although we live in Italy, 
and it would be very awkward if it was withdrawn, especially for people living 
in border areas. Within theSchengen area 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/is-the-schengen-dream-of-europe-without-borders-becoming-a-thing-of-the-past>
, it feels not much more than crossing from England to Wales.

I have to say I trust the UK government less than that of Italy. I can just 
see them deciding to make a saving on our health cover and leaving us high and 
dry. They ought to bear in mind, however, that if we had to return to 
Brexitland we would be a substantial extra burden on the NHS.

The problem is that we do not count, politically. The Italians have MPs to 
represent their expats with their own overseas constituencies. After 15 years 
we lose our right to vote in the UK and become subjects not citizens. We were 
not even allowed to vote in a referendum that could turn our lives upside down. 
I feel very bitter about it, as do other expats. When we contact UK MPs, we 
usually just get an automatic message saying they can only respond to people 
living in their constituencies.

The other big issue for pensioners is whether the state pension will be 
frozen. For those, like us, with additional occupational pensions it is not so 
crucial, but there are many expat pensioners whose only pension is this. The 
fall in the value of the pound and the expected much bigger fall when Brexit 
actually takes place only compound the problem.

My Spanish friends are shocked and mystified by the Brexit decision – and 
offended – and are happy I am fighting it.
 Sue Wilson believes multiculturalism is to be admired 
My Brexit fears centre on the loss of the freedoms I have enjoyed, 
specifically the freedom of movement and the benefits that come with being a 
member of the European Union. I am very fearful of the attitude of the British 
government and ofthe change in nature of British society 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/01/national-anti-hate-campaign-to-launch-after-spike-in-incidents-betterthanthat->
, which has become an intolerant and inward-looking one.

In Spain, multiculturalism is to be admired, not abhorred. We are welcomed by 
the local communities, we haven’t suffered any racism or ill-treatment. It 
would be fair to say that the Spanish are shocked and mystified by the Brexit 
decision – and offended. They actually take it very personally that we wish to 
leave a union that they value so highly and my Spanish friends are very happy 
that I am fighting it.

On a personal level, worries include those over the future of our pensions. 
You can draw a British pension anywhere in the world, but within the EU it is 
linked to inflation or the cost of living. Will this now be frozen for 
pensioners?

Pensioners, especially those on low incomes, are already suffering because of 
the exchange rate changes since the referendum and are having to live on less.

Denouncing my Britishness would not be the end of the world.

 Paul Reynolds is concerned about a lack of security post-Brexit 
I have lived in Ireland for 20 years and my three children, aged 14, 11 and 7, 
are all Irish. After Brexit you begin to think about the little things that 
will affect them, like having to queue in different queues in the airport when 
going or coming back from holidays.

Then there’s also the financial side – it’s not quite like being a British 
pensioner in Spain but there is just a lack of security about the future. There 
is also the question of education, whether they can be educated in Britain. 
Does that remain an option? Nobody is telling us anything, and there is a lack 
of information.

It would be easy to get an Irish passport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/huge-rise-in-britons-applying-for-irish-citizenship-after-brexit-vote>
 and we’ll definitely do it. You can hold on to your principles for so long. 
Denouncing my Britishness would not be the end of the world. It helps that I 
don’t feel as British post-Brexit.

Gemma Middleton, 43, film producer, Valencia

I hate that my children in Spain will not have the freedoms to work and travel 
in Europe that I had.

 Gemma Middleton fears her children’s opportunities will be limited 
We’ve lived here in Spain for seven years with my two children, 19 and 14. 
they were both born in the UK and none of us are eligible for Spanish 
citizenship because you have to have been here 10 years. The Spanish don’t 
offer dual nationality, so the worry is whether we will be able to stay 
post-Brexit.

It terrifies me that my children will not be getting the same opportunities I 
have had. When I was 19 Ibackpacked around Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/05/eu-plan-to-counter-brexit-give-teenagers-free-interrail-tickets>
 with no complications. I worked in bars, did au pair work along the way and 
I’ve always considered myself European. I hate the fact that my children can’t 
have that now through no fault of their own.

It’s a narrowing of choice and will probably mean having to apply for work 
visas every time they want to work in Europe. I can’t bear to think they just 
can’t hop on a train and travel. That’s not something our generation had to 
even think of and that’s just been snatched from them.

All their friends are Spanish and my youngest is more or less Spanish now. 
There’s very little English about him. He’d be quite prepared to give up his 
British citizenship, but the older one, he would find it harder.

I wouldn’t hesitate in renouncing my Britishness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/02/will-self-brexit-fallout-european-referendum-patriotism>
, it doesn’t bother me in the slightest. My family voted to leave: my parents, 
my sisters, my brother-in-law, my cousins, everyone. Some of my family were due 
to come here in October but we cancelled. It would have been world war three.
