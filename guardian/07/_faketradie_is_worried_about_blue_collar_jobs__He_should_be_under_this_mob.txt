Sigmund Freud offers the best explanation for the reaction recorded to the new 
Liberal party election TV ad <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I0wae57nJ0> that 
first aired on Sunday night. Familiarity, Freud posed, is disconcerting when we 
see it an unfamiliar way. The man on the television wearing a high-vis vest 
certainly looked a bit familiar, with his powertools, bench and humble mug, as 
well as willingness to spout an unasked for political opinion – in his case, 
that Labor leader Bill Shorten had declared “war on everything”, and, as such, 
he says: “So, I reckon we should just see it through and stick with the current 
mob for a while.”

Unemployment figures suit Turnbull, but not those seeking full-time work |

Certainly, there are no shortage of conservatives in the labouring classes, 
and as confounding as the phenomenon of the working class Tory may be to the 
champions of social progress, more than one socialist has been forced to accept 
that they exist.

Yet a confluence of elements in this simple, single-speaker ad were so 
dissociative from real-life, blue-collar conservatives that social media dubbed 
the star of the ad #faketradie.

 The Liberal party advertisement starring the #faketradie. 
Even when advertising guru Dee Madigan insisted there was no way that a real 
actor could be so awkward with his lines, a rapidly agglomerating crowd of 
unbelievers pointed out the man’s watch and bracelet were a saw-operation 
“catch risk”, that his bench was too far from the demarcated worksite to be 
considered safe, and that ceramic cups were implausible in that workplace. They 
identified packing creases in his trousers, unsafe short sleeves and lack of 
safety goggles – even his “too clean” hands. Myself, I could not recall even 
the most avowed working class Tory ever expressing a deferent, defensive love 
of their bank.

The context of the election has established that the Liberals are not averse 
to making appeals to the crucial working-class votes with no small amount of 
fakery –invoking manufactured truckie crises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/this-election-will-be-fought-on-class-lines-not-good-news-for-turnbull>
, opportunistic photoshoots with hardly impartial firefighter volunteers and 
the cringeworthy“poor Malcolm” videos 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WchxcTc3V2o> with much attention to ornament.

At this stage of a long campaign, it’s difficult to determine whether the 
“fake tradie” ad is a campaign misstep, a tight and clever small-target appeal 
to a narrow demographic or anotherdead cat thrown on the table 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/any-election-involving-crosby-textor-will-include-dead-cats-and-weve-just-been-thrown-one>
.

In the case of the latter, the feline feast is an understandable attempt to 
distract from one of the great literal ironies of the campaign; weeks ago, I 
responded to Turnbull’s promise of “jobs and growth” with the question“what 
kind of jobs?” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/11/good-slogan-malcolm-turnbull-but-growth-in-what-kind-of-jobs>
. Weeks later, he is still saying it, I am still asking, the government is 
presiding over acollapse in the growth of full-time jobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jun/20/unemployment-figures-suit-turnbull-but-not-those-seeking-full-time-work>
 and hiding them under part-time work figures and the elephant in the room of 
the accelerating decline of Australian manufacturing has not gone away.

Because it’s not been lost on the Australian working class and the communities 
in which they live that the old Australian promise of blue-collar jobs that 
would earn someone born without wealth enough to “get ahead” is one failing to 
be fulfilled.

While the tradie on the telly pursues a property portfolio, the ability for 
his likely cousins in traditional manufacturing areas to do so has been falling 
since the global financial crisis in 2008. Under the Liberals, the decline has 
accelerated – even without counting the imminent demise of manufacturing jobs 
in the car industry.

Since the Liberal-National Coalition government was elected in September 2013, 
employment in manufacturing has shed 50,000 jobs. Only the week before last, 
another workforce of62 maintenance workers were laid off  
<https://www.facebook.com/TheAMWU/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1393765233970861>
at Carlton & United Breweries Melbourne. This, despite the Liberals’ stated 
election pledge of 2013 that they’d create “a million good jobs in five years”. 
Oh, yeah? Tell that to the real tradies now on a picket line at CUB. Or just 
about anyone in South Australia.

The mythology that it’s fine to shed jobs in manufacturing because it’s an 
“old” industry, unworthy of resurgence in an “innovative” modern economy like 
Australia’s was exploded in recent comprehensiveresearch by the Australia 
Institute <http://www.tai.org.au/content/manufacturing-still-matters>.

The researchers make the point that not only is manufacturing the greatest 
driver of research innovation in the economy, but manufactured goods account 
for over two-thirds of the world’s trade in merchandise. This is why many 
industrial countries are expanding their manufacturing output – both to boost 
the boon to communities from the provision of good, well-paid and stable local 
jobs, and also to increase their export output with manufactured goods.

While the Coalition insists on its superior “economic management” by its 
policy flattery of the mining and resources sectors, Australians imported 
$246bn in manufactured goods last year, but exported only $100bn of them. This 
trade deficit of near $150bn grew by 40% between 2011 and 2015 and it far 
overwhelms the revenue returned to Australia by exports of resources.

As the Australia Institute warns, extracting and selling an ever-greater 
quantity of non-renewable resources is not enough to pay for the “growing 
flood” of manufacturing goods coming into Australia because we want to buy 
things that our own country is not making. This is afundamental economic 
instability 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/yanis-varoufakis-australias-negative-gearing-is-scandalous>
 that will not and cannot provide the foundations for growth unless it is 
addressed – and it needs to be addressed soon, because as of today, Malcolm 
Turnbull’s “innovative” Australia has smallest share of manufacturing as a 
percentage of total employment of any OECD country. We are being outproduced by 
Luxembourg.

And anyone clinging to the neoliberal fairytale that high union wages make 
Australian manufacturing uncompetitive need only compare Australian output to 
that of our high-wage, high-union-density cousins in Japan, Korea, Germany and 
the Netherlands – all of whom continue to expand their manufacturing production 
with the direct policy intervention of government.

These, however, are not the interventions that Turnbull is promising, waving 
instead at his $50bn tax cut to big business as the ultimate deferral of 
responsibility for job creation to someone else, somewhere else, than at the 
behest of a government that’s elected to, you know, make decisions about what 
the future looks like and to lead people to it.

Whether Turnbull’s tradie is real, fake, a confection of the internet or one 
of a political campaign trying to hide in plain sight, someone needs to tell 
him that if he’s worried about blue-collar jobs, the last thing he should 
consider is voting for more non-solutions from this mob.
