Gene Wilder-One of the truly great talents of our time. He blessed every film 
we did with his magic & he blessed me with his friendship.

 to the cast. She said he was “quiet, gently funny and patient”. Actor Elijah 
Wood quoted a line from the Willy Wonka film (itself taken from a poem byArthur 
O’Shaughnessy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_O%27Shaughnessy>) when he 
paid tribute.

Rain Pryor, daughter of Wilder’s frequent co-star Richard Pryor, said her 
father, who died in 2005, thought Wilder “a good man and a genius”. Pryor and 
Wilder, whose friendship was occasionally tested by Pryor’s drug abuse, offered 
a unique on-screen chemistry, she said.

“Mr Wilder was the older: ‘I’m here. I’m doing my work and we have a great 
chemistry. And then I’m going to go have my sober life,’”Rain told The 
Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gene-wilder-remembered-richard-pryor-924046>
. “He was a normal dude compared to my dad in that sense. But in terms of his 
kindness and generosity and to watch the two of them together, there’s not a 
magic that’s been like that in a long time”.

Finally, director Edgar Wright noted Wilder’s skill at making being quiet 
funny and called for a moment of silence.

A moment of silence for the master of the comedic pause.
