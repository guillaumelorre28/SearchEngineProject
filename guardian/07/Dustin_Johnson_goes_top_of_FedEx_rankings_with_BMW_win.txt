Dustin Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dustin-johnson> survived an 
early wobble to win the BMW Championship at Crooked Stick and move top of the 
FedEx Cup standings with one event to go.

The US Open champion

 won by three shots in Indiana, having initially extended his advantage to four 
at the opening hole only to bogey the next two to find himself in a tie with 
the in-form Englishman Paul Casey.

However, the world No2 then reeled off five birdies in his next nine holes to 
pull clear of his challengers and, although a bogey at the par-three 13th cut 
his advantage to three, he won comfortably after a five-under-par final round 
of 67 to close 23 under.

Victory puts him in pole position heading into The Tour Championship in 
Atlanta on 22 September, the week before the Ryder Cup, in which Johnson will 
be one of Davis Love III’s key players.

Casey finished second, also after a round of 67 which included four birdies 
and, at the par-five 15, an eagle – but that was matched by Johnson to cancel 
out the benefit. The American Roberto Castro finished third a further three 
stokes back.

The defending champion and world No1, Jason Day, withdrew mid-round 
complaining of a back problem while Rickie Fowler – now relying on a captain’s 
pick on Monday to make the USA team for Hazeltine – Sergio García and Henrik 
Stenson all dropped out of the top 30 and will miss the final event of thePGA 
Tour <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/pga-tour> at East Lake.
