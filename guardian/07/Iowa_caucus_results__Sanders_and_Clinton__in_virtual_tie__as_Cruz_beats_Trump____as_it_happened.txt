The Iowa result doesn’t mean that Hillary Clinton won’t win the nomination, 
but she is too reliant on older “creaky-kneed” voters, writesJohn Cassidy in 
the New Yorker 
<http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-just-changed-the-democratic-party>
.

Although she seems likely to lose again in New Hampshire next week, she 
remains a strong over-all favorite: on betting sites, even today, to win twenty 
dollars on Hillary emerging as the Democratic candidate, you would have to bet 
a hundred dollars. But for Clinton to unite her party and galvanize it for what 
could be a tough fight in the fall, she needs to find some way to appeal to the 
young, who have fastened onto Sanders’s anti-establishment message.

The age gap between Clinton supporters and Sanders supporters was huge. 
According to theentrance polls 
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/01/us/elections/iowa-democrat-poll.html>
, which wrongly predicted a Clinton victory, Sanders got eighty-six per cent of 
the Democratic vote in the seventeen-to-twenty-four age group, eighty-one per 
cent in the twenty-five-to-twenty-nine group, and sixty-five per cent in the 
thirty-to-thirty-nine age group. Clinton, by contrast, was largely reliant on 
the middle-aged and the elderly. Among forty-something voters, she won by five 
percentage points. Among the over-fifties, she won by more than twenty per cent.

The virtual tie in Iowa represents “a jolting psychological blow to the 
Clinton campaign” 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/us/politics/democratic-race-iowa-clinton-campaign.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0>
, according to Amy Chozick in the New York Times:

She writes that it left “volunteers, donors and aides confused throughout the 
night, and then crestfallen.”

They had hoped that the former secretary of state would garner a decisive 
victory here and put to rest any doubts about her strength as a candidate.

Instead, they now head to New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders is heavily favored 
in the polls, and brace themselves for another loss before they reach more 
hospitable states like Nevada and South Carolina ...

The question the Clinton campaign confronts is whether the first two states 
are simply demographically unfriendly to Mrs. Clinton, as many analysts 
believe, or whether her lack of connection so far inIowa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> and New Hampshire indicates a deeper 
shakiness underlying her candidacy.

Gary Younge’s picks out three similarities between the the Democratic and 
RepublicanIowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> results:

First, they are an undeniable and unequivocal rebuke to the party 
establishments. Cruz, an ideologically driven pious Texas senator, whose 
grandstanding in the senate has irritated his colleagues, is far more loathed 
by the Republican leaders than Trump. Add the 52% they got between them to the 
9% who backed Ben Carson – the brain surgeon who claimed pyramids were for 
grain storage and called Vladimir Putin a“one-horse country” 
<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/carson-putin-is-a-country> – and you 
have almost two-thirds of Iowans rejecting anything close to a consensus 
candidate who could unite the party.

Clinton had name recognition, money, a former president-husband, a previous 
presidential run and virtually the entire party machine on her side. This was 
supposed to be a coronation in which Sanders was cast as the jester: if there 
was a female equivalent of regicide, this would be it.

Second, the insurgent wings of both parties are redefining the contours of 
American politics. In 1999, after the release of his film Bulworth, Iasked 
Warren Beatty <https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jan/23/1> if he was a 
socialist. He wouldn’t go near it. “Ideology seems to be so unfashionable,” he 
said. “So why not take advantage of it and not name oneself with a term that 
has become particularly problematic.” Apoll earlier this month showed that 43% 
of Iowa Democrats defined themselves as socialists 
<http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/rgsikEKtNf30>. We have no idea what to 
compare that with because it’s simply not a question anyone would have asked 
before Sanders came on the scene.

Among Republicans Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a young, telegenic candidate 
whose unexpectedly strong third place showing will make him the establishment 
favourite, has been cast as a moderate. That’s true if you compare him to Trump 
and Cruz, although judged by that yardstick Ronald Reagan and George W Bush 
would be moderates, too. But Rubio, an anti-abortionist and foreign policy 
hawk, was the Tea Party choice for Mitt Romney’s running mate  
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/jeb-bush-mitt-romney-vp_n_1703918.html>
just four years ago.

Third, we are now set for two long races stretching well into spring. The 
Republican race is fairly evenly split three ways between Trump, Cruz and 
Rubio; now that Sanders has proved himself viable some will now take a second 
look.The polls have not served us well thus far 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/02/iowa-caucus-polls-what-went-wrong-and-what-happens-next>
, but they predict that bothSanders 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html>
 andTrump  
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_republican_presidential_primary-3350.html>
will win New Hampshire next week, resetting the dial and recalibrating 
expectations. It is unlikely that either party will have settled on a nominee 
by Super Tuesday.

Summing up he adds: 

Last night’s results lay bare the scale and depth of the realignment that has 
been taking place within the country for almost a generation: a polarisation of 
left and right that has made elections more volatile, politics more gridlocked 
and discourse more shrill. A socialist is in the running for the Democratic 
nomination;Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> could 
be president. If these are the things we are saying in February, imagine what 
we might be saying come the Democratic and Republican conventions in July.

Surprise results from Iowa caucus force us to rethink our expectations – again

“We just got in from Iowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>, where we 
astounded the world. And now in New Hampshire we’re going to astound the world 
again” Sanders told supporters at an impromptu early morning rally. Dan Roberts 
filmed the moment on his phone.

Sanders calls for release of raw vote count

Dan Roberts

Dan Roberts, who was on that Sanders plane to New Hampshire, has more on his 
call for the Democratic party to release a raw vote count inIowa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>.

Speaking to reporters on a chartered plane flying directly from Des Moines to 
their next showdown in New Hampshire, the leftwing senator said his shock 
performance in theIowa caucus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/01/iowa-caucus-results-live-county-by-county-interactive-map>
 was a signal that the American people were hungry for more radical change than 
that offered by establishment candidates.

“Tonight is a wonderful start to the national campaign,” he said in a packed 
gangway on the late night flight heading east to beat an incoming snowstorm. 
“Tonight shows the American people that this is a campaign that can win.”

Sanders threw little light on an unfolding controversy over certain Iowa 
precincts that did not have enough Democratic party volunteers to report 
delegate totals for each candidate, but called on officials to take the unusual 
step of revealing underlying voter totals too.

“I honestly don’t know what happened. I know there are some precincts that 
have still not reported. I can only hope and expect that the count will be 
honest,” he said.

“I have no idea, did we win the popular vote? I don’t know, but as much 
information as possible should be made available.”

Sanders’ campaign director, Jeff Weaver, told reporters he did not “anticipate 
we are going to contest” specific results but hoped there would be an 
investigation into what happened.

With the Democratic result almost too close to call, Sanders has not ruled out 
putting in a challenge.

The race was so tight that several precincts were forced to decide whether 
Clinton or Sanders got the winning votes - and one more delegate - by a coin 
toss, following the state Democratic Party’s advice.

After flying into New Hampshire, Sanders told MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt that he 
didn’t know whether his campaign would contest the result.

The Iowa result doesn’t mean that Hillary Clinton won’t win the nomination, 
but she is too reliant on older “creaky-kneed” voters, writesJohn Cassidy in 
the New Yorker 
<http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-just-changed-the-democratic-party>
.

Although she seems likely to lose again in New Hampshire next week, she 
remains a strong over-all favorite: on betting sites, even today, to win twenty 
dollars on Hillary emerging as the Democratic candidate, you would have to bet 
a hundred dollars. But for Clinton to unite her party and galvanize it for what 
could be a tough fight in the fall, she needs to find some way to appeal to the 
young, who have fastened onto Sanders’s anti-establishment message.

The age gap between Clinton supporters and Sanders supporters was huge. 
According to theentrance polls 
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/01/us/elections/iowa-democrat-poll.html>
, which wrongly predicted a Clinton victory, Sanders got eighty-six per cent of 
the Democratic vote in the seventeen-to-twenty-four age group, eighty-one per 
cent in the twenty-five-to-twenty-nine group, and sixty-five per cent in the 
thirty-to-thirty-nine age group. Clinton, by contrast, was largely reliant on 
the middle-aged and the elderly. Among forty-something voters, she won by five 
percentage points. Among the over-fifties, she won by more than twenty per cent.

The virtual tie in Iowa represents “a jolting psychological blow to the 
Clinton campaign” 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/us/politics/democratic-race-iowa-clinton-campaign.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0>
, according to Amy Chozick in the New York Times:

She writes that it left “volunteers, donors and aides confused throughout the 
night, and then crestfallen.”

They had hoped that the former secretary of state would garner a decisive 
victory here and put to rest any doubts about her strength as a candidate.

Instead, they now head to New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders is heavily favored 
in the polls, and brace themselves for another loss before they reach more 
hospitable states like Nevada and South Carolina ...

The question the Clinton campaign confronts is whether the first two states 
are simply demographically unfriendly to Mrs. Clinton, as many analysts 
believe, or whether her lack of connection so far inIowa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> and New Hampshire indicates a deeper 
shakiness underlying her candidacy.

Gary Younge’s picks out three similarities between the the Democratic and 
RepublicanIowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa> results:

First, they are an undeniable and unequivocal rebuke to the party 
establishments. Cruz, an ideologically driven pious Texas senator, whose 
grandstanding in the senate has irritated his colleagues, is far more loathed 
by the Republican leaders than Trump. Add the 52% they got between them to the 
9% who backed Ben Carson – the brain surgeon who claimed pyramids were for 
grain storage and called Vladimir Putin a“one-horse country” 
<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/carson-putin-is-a-country> – and you 
have almost two-thirds of Iowans rejecting anything close to a consensus 
candidate who could unite the party.

Clinton had name recognition, money, a former president-husband, a previous 
presidential run and virtually the entire party machine on her side. This was 
supposed to be a coronation in which Sanders was cast as the jester: if there 
was a female equivalent of regicide, this would be it.

Second, the insurgent wings of both parties are redefining the contours of 
American politics. In 1999, after the release of his film Bulworth, Iasked 
Warren Beatty <https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jan/23/1> if he was a 
socialist. He wouldn’t go near it. “Ideology seems to be so unfashionable,” he 
said. “So why not take advantage of it and not name oneself with a term that 
has become particularly problematic.” Apoll earlier this month showed that 43% 
of Iowa Democrats defined themselves as socialists 
<http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/rgsikEKtNf30>. We have no idea what to 
compare that with because it’s simply not a question anyone would have asked 
before Sanders came on the scene.

Among Republicans Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a young, telegenic candidate 
whose unexpectedly strong third place showing will make him the establishment 
favourite, has been cast as a moderate. That’s true if you compare him to Trump 
and Cruz, although judged by that yardstick Ronald Reagan and George W Bush 
would be moderates, too. But Rubio, an anti-abortionist and foreign policy 
hawk, was the Tea Party choice for Mitt Romney’s running mate  
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/jeb-bush-mitt-romney-vp_n_1703918.html>
just four years ago.

Third, we are now set for two long races stretching well into spring. The 
Republican race is fairly evenly split three ways between Trump, Cruz and 
Rubio; now that Sanders has proved himself viable some will now take a second 
look.The polls have not served us well thus far 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/02/iowa-caucus-polls-what-went-wrong-and-what-happens-next>
, but they predict that bothSanders 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html>
 andTrump  
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_republican_presidential_primary-3350.html>
will win New Hampshire next week, resetting the dial and recalibrating 
expectations. It is unlikely that either party will have settled on a nominee 
by Super Tuesday.

Summing up he adds: 

Last night’s results lay bare the scale and depth of the realignment that has 
been taking place within the country for almost a generation: a polarisation of 
left and right that has made elections more volatile, politics more gridlocked 
and discourse more shrill. A socialist is in the running for the Democratic 
nomination;Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> could 
be president. If these are the things we are saying in February, imagine what 
we might be saying come the Democratic and Republican conventions in July.

Heads of tails? Here’s footage of a coin toss used to decide the tight 
Democratic caucus inIowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>.
 
“We just got in from Iowa <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>, where we 
astounded the world. And now in New Hampshire we’re going to astound the world 
again” Sanders told supporters at an impromptu early morning rally. Dan Roberts 
filmed the moment on his phone.
 
Sanders is talking to supporters in New Hampshire who have been waiting to 
welcome him in a freezing parking lot for the last three hours, Dan Roberts 
reports.
 Bernie Sanders supporters in New Hampshire  
Dan Roberts, who was on that Sanders plane to New Hampshire, has more on his 
call for the Democratic party to release a raw vote count inIowa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>.

Speaking to reporters on a chartered plane flying directly from Des Moines to 
their next showdown in New Hampshire, the leftwing senator said his shock 
performance in theIowa caucus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/01/iowa-caucus-results-live-county-by-county-interactive-map>
 was a signal that the American people were hungry for more radical change than 
that offered by establishment candidates.

“Tonight is a wonderful start to the national campaign,” he said in a packed 
gangway on the late night flight heading east to beat an incoming snowstorm. 
“Tonight shows the American people that this is a campaign that can win.”

Sanders threw little light on an unfolding controversy over certain Iowa 
precincts that did not have enough Democratic party volunteers to report 
delegate totals for each candidate, but called on officials to take the unusual 
step of revealing underlying voter totals too.

“I honestly don’t know what happened. I know there are some precincts that 
have still not reported. I can only hope and expect that the count will be 
honest,” he said.

“I have no idea, did we win the popular vote? I don’t know, but as much 
information as possible should be made available.”

Sanders’ campaign director, Jeff Weaver, told reporters he did not “anticipate 
we are going to contest” specific results but hoped there would be an 
investigation into what happened.
