Chapecoense football team crashed inColombia

killing 71 players, journalists and crew members.


Six of the 77 people on the plane – three footballers, two crew and a 
journalist – survived the disaster. One footballer who was pulled alive from 
the plane’s wreckage died later in hospital.

military personnel searched the crash site. He said the plane had been split in 
two with only the nose and wings recognisable, and the tail end completely 
destroyed.

Colombian officials said the charter flight started its journey in São Paulo, 
Brazil <https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil>, on Monday afternoon and 
stopped over in Bolivia before heading for the Colombian city of Medellín, 
where the team had been due to play in the final of the Copa Sudamericana.


The plane, a British Aerospace 146 short-haul aircraft, was carrying 
footballers, club staff and journalists to the match against Atlético Nacional 
in Colombia’s second-largest city.

A statement from José María Córdova airport in Medellín said the plane had 
declared an emergency at 10pm local time on Monday because of electrical 
failures. Around 15 minutes later, it crashed in a wooded, mountainous area 
outside Medellín, where heavy rain, fog and darkness hampered rescue efforts.

“At the moment we know that the disaster happened in Cerro Gordo in the 
municipality of La Unión and that there were 72 passengers and nine crew on 
board, including the football team Chapecoense Real. There are reported to be 
six survivors,” the statement read. Officials originally believed there were 81 
people on the plane, but the toll was lowered after it was confirmed that four 
people on the passenger list had failed to board the plane in Bolivia.

Later on Monday, Colombia’s civil aeronautics agency announced that it had 
found the plane’s two flight recorders “in perfect condition.”

Colombia’s civil aviation authority named the six survivors in a statement 
posted on Facebook on Tuesday. It said two crew members – Ximena Suárez, a 
flight attendant, and Erwin Tumiri, a flight technician – had been taken to the 
Clínica Somer hospital in Rionegro.

Three players – Alan Luciano Ruschel, Jakson Ragnar Follmann and H élio 
Hermito Zampier – were also said to be in hospital, along with the journalist, 
Rafael Valmorbida. Two of the six are said to be seriously injured. The player 
who was rescued but later died of his injuries was named as goalkeeper Marcos 
Danilo Padilha.


Amanda Ruschel, who is married to Alan Ruschel, the first player to be taken 
to hospital, posted a photo of him on Instagram alongside the message: “Thank 
God Alan is in the hospital, stable. We are praying for all of those who were 
not yet rescued and offer our support to all their relatives. This is a 
complicated, difficult situation. Only God himself can give us strength. Thank 
you God.”

Nivaldo, a 42-year-old Brazilian goalkeeper who has been at the club since 
2006 but did not travel to Colombia, told website UOL Esporte he had been woken 
at 5am on Tuesday by a phone call from a worried friend who wanted to know if 
he was on the flight. He said he had tried to call his team-mates and other 
club staff who were on the plane, but nobody answered.

“Everybody is praying that the worst hasn’t happened,” he told the website. 
“I’m bracing for the worst. I don’t want to, I can’t believe it, but you have 
to be strong.”

The victims included the team’s manager, Luiz Carlos Saroli, known as Caio 
Júnior; his son, Matheus Saroli, had been scheduled to take the flight, but was 
unable to depart because he had left his passport at home. “We need strength 
and I ask that you give us a little privacy, especially my mother,” he wrote on 
Facebook.

The Brazilian president, Michel Temer, declared a period of national mourning 
and offered his condolences to the friends and families of those on the plane 
in a series of tweets. “I express my solidarity at this sad time when dozens of 
Brazilian families have been affected by tragedy,” he wrote.

“We are offering every form of help and assistance that we can to the 
families. The air force and foreign ministry have been put to work. The 
government will do everything possible to relieve the pain of these friends and 
families of Brazilian sport and journalism.”

His Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, also tweeted his condolences, 
saying: “Solidarity with the families of the victims and Brazil.”

As tributes flooded in from clubs, players and fans around the world, Brazil 
announced that all football matches would be postponed for a week. Some 
footballers and clubs changed their social media profile pictures to a black 
version of Chapecoense’s green badge, and many included the hashtag#ForçaChape 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/For%C3%A7aChape?src=hash> – or Strength Chape – 
after the club’s nickname.


Atlético Nacional, the Colombian team Chapecoense were travelling to play, 
called for the Copa Sudamericana to be given to the Brazilian side to honour 
“their great loss and in posthumous tribute to the victims of the fatal 
accident that has left our sport in mourning”. It added: “As far as we’re 
concerned, Chapecoense will forever be the champions of the 2016 Copa 
Sudamericana.”


Raimundo Colombo, the governor of Santa Catarina state – where the team is 
based in the city of Chapecó – said Chapecoense were not only representing the 
city and state, but were also making history as the first club from the region 
to reach the final of an international competition.


He said he was in a state of shock and expressed his solidarity with the 
families of the players, club officials and journalists who formed the 
delegation “at what is a time of great pain for the sporting community in Santa 
Catarina and in Brazil”.

Chapecoense fans gathered outside the club’s stadium to mourn the dead, 
console one another and offer their prayers. Theclub posted a video 
<https://www.facebook.com/TimeChapecoense/> on Facebook of the team in good 
spirits shortly before takeoff.

Nivaldo, who was not part of the squad for the game, said Chapecó, a small 
city of about 200,000 residents, had come to a virtual standstill as locals 
came to terms with the news. “The situation is very sad here,” he said. “The 
city has stopped. It’s a moment of suffering. It’s a huge loss for Brazilian 
football – a team that was at its peak.”

Some fans left messages under the video. “I am from Rio de Janeiro and I am 
praying for you. May God and Our Lady send their angels to take care of you 
all,” one wrote.


Diário Catarinense, a newspaper covering Santa Catarina, said there was 
confusion and anguish among those linked to the club in Chapecó. Cissa Soletti, 
who works for the team’s marketing department, told the newspaper it was 
instructing staff to gather at the club’s HQ. The mayor of Chapecó, Luciano 
Buligon, who was due to fly to Colombia for the match, said he knew nothing 
beyond the fact that there were some survivors.

British inspectors are flying out to the crash site as part of the 
investigation, in line with international protocols. A spokesman for the UK’s 
Air Accidents Investigation Branch said: “As the state of manufacture of the 
aircraft, theAAIB is sending a team of inspectors to Colombia to assist with 
the investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/british-investigators-fly-to-colombia-to-help-examine-plane-crash>
 of the aircraft accident at Medellín.”


Chapecoense play in Brazil’s premier division, Série A. The club was founded 
in 1973 and first won promotion to the top flight in 2014.

The Copa Sudamericana is South America’s second-tier club competition, one 
rung below the Copa Libertadores, the centrepiece of the continent’s football 
calendar. The winner of the Copa Sudamericana gains automatic entry into next 
season’s Copa Libertadores.

The final, like each round of the tournament, is a two-legged tie, consisting 
of a home match and an away fixture. Atlético Nacional were due to visit Brazil 
for the return leg on 7 December.
