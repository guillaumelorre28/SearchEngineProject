For the outgoing sex discrimination commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, 
becoming an officer of the order of Australia (AO) for her service is “a real 
thrill and a great honour” as well as a surprise.

“I didn’t expect it,” she says. “In the work I do, there are people 
contributing in many different ways, together with others. But it is an honour.”

“There are many incredibly meritorious people aside from me who never have an 
opportunity to be recognised with an award,” she adds.

“A lot of the work that we do lives in the shadows. There’s a silence that 
often surrounds it – but sometimes that silence is at the request of people 
working with victims of family violence and discrimination.”

Broderick singled out the 2015 Australian of the year, Rosie Batty, for her 
work on domestic violence.

“Rosie Batty – someone with such a persuasive and influential voice – has 
really showed us this year that when we take these issues out of the shadows so 
much change can happen,” she says.

Broderick, who encouraged Australians to nominate more women for honours in 
2016, believes the nation has experienced a real shift on gender equality, “the 
pointy end of which is violence against women”.

“We’ve started to say: ‘That’s not who we are, that’s not part of the values 
we have here in Australia’.”

 Asked about recent high-profile scandals involving harassment, Broderick 
says: “I expect we’ll continue to see more public scrutiny [in 2016], that 
people will call out sexism whenever they see it, that there’ll be greater 
education around respectful relationship.”

Change is coming, Broderick says, “from the classroom to the boardroom”.
