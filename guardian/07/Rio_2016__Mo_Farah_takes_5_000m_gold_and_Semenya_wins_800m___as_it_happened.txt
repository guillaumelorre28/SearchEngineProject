So, a remarkable day’s action. Mo Farah, Neymar, Caster Semenya. Surprises 
from Centrowitz, 37-year-old Ruth Beitia in the high jump – need we go on?

Well, yes, in the best spirit of Samuel Beckett, we must go on; we’ll go on.

This brings a close to day 15 from Rio but the live action continues here:

Speaking of London 1908, not only did Great Britain wipe the floor in the 
tug-of-war, but it’s also the last time that the United States won gold in the 
men’s 1500m.

An update on China and Great Britain’s respective chances in the men’s 
marathon tomorrow – both countries have three competitors in action, but within 
a field of 155 runners in all.

Should GB hold on to second spot overall it will be the best finishing 
position at an Olympics since the London Games. No, not 2012 – London 1908. 
What a remarkable achievement that would be.

There’s quite a thought-provoking editorial in the Observer about this very 
topic too – with a plea to ensure top-end success feeds back into grassroots 
participation:

The battle for second place in the overall medal table will play out on 
Sunday, with Britain and China no doubt nervously checking their prospects for 
the final day of action.

Team GB is guaranteed one more medal: whether that’s gold or silver depends on 
Joe Joyce’s ability to fend off France’s Tony Yoka inthe men’s 
super-heavyweight boxing final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/great-britain-joe-joyce-rio-final>
.

I’m not sure either nation holds out especially high hopes for the men’s 
marathon, and both are absent from the crucial rhythmic gymnastics team 
all-around final. China does have Yeerlanbieke Katai in the wrestling 65kg 
heats.

And both have an entrant in the men’s cross-country mountain biking. Could 
this be the clincher? Let’s say it’s … unlikely.

If you missed it, Caster Semenya was in imposing form as she comfortably won 
the women’s 800m final to claim gold in a personal best time.

That won’t unfortunately be the end of it, with the South African runner 
seemingly set to face further scrutiny from the IAAF and its President, 
Sebastian Coe.

The jury appears to still be out on whether Felix was hard done by in the 
individual 400m after stumble-tumble-dive-gate, but surely this achievement 
will put a smile back on the Olympic champion’s face.

And if you missed the day’s big story from the men’s football (no it wasn’t 
Germany losing a penalty shoot out, although that is a minor miracle in and of 
itself) – Brazil have won their first ever Olympic gold in the sport – adding 
to their five World Cups.

Throughout the tournament so much expectation lay on the shoulders of star 
striker Neymar Jnr, so perhaps no surprises when it was the Barcelona forward 
who stepped forward to calmly stroke home the winning penalty.

Some fabulous scenes from the Maracanã, captured here for your viewing 
pleasure.

search away (ie “David Luiz crying”) from feeling cheerful again.

With that final gold medal of the night in women’s volleyball factored in, it

Can China reel in Great Britain on the final day (in wrestling? rhythmic 
gymnastics?) – or will GB’s super heavyweight hero Joe Joyce have the final say?

Our man on the ground in Beijing, Tom Phillips, had some interesting things to 
say on the ‘demise’ of China at these Olympics. That assessment may yet prove 
premature:

broken, re-broken, recommenced the non-cessation of silence (please help me)

And forget Conor McGregor and the UFC, at the real wrestling it’s been a 
strong day for Turkey, who’ve continued their solid Olympics in the discipline.

In the men’s freestyle 125kg division Taha Akgul proved too strong for Iran’s 
Komeil Ghasemi, winning their gold medal bout 3-1.
 Proud as punch – the parents of Taha Akgul embrace the new gold medallist.

Also a silver for Turkey’s Selim Yasar who went down to Russia’s Abdulrashid 
Sadulaev in the men’s freestyle 86kg category.

Incidentally, something that may have escaped your notice during the Games 
(but certainly just piqued mine) – in the women’s freestyle wrestling it’s been 
almost a clean sweep for Japan, who have taken home four gold and one silver 
across the six weight division.

Fun fact: 33% of Japan’s entire gold yield at Rio has come from women’s 
wrestling.

If you missed it amid the excitement of the athletics track, there’s been some 
special momentsat the taekwondo.

Having already delivered first-ever gold medals for Ivory Coast and Jordan, 
taekwondo has now helped Niger’s Abdoulrazak Alfaga claim his nation’s 
first-ever silver medal, and companion to its only ever Olympic medal, a bronze 
in boxing from Munich 1972.

Alfaga’s opponent, Radik Isaev, emerged victorious in the men’s +80kg 
division, winning the gold for Azerbaijan. With China’s Shuyin Zheng also 
grabbing gold at Carioca Arena 3 in the women’s +67kg category.

So that draws to a close the action from day 15. Still plenty to be resolved 
before the shutters are pulled down in Rio and the media caravans wend on their 
merry way.

There’s wrestling, volleyball, handball, a smidgen of gymnastics and mountain 
biking, boxing, basketball and the men’s marathon still to come; and naturally, 
all the pomp and pageantry of the closing ceremony.

They came fourth in their group, only just sneaking through after three loses, 
but they’ve send home the world’s best ranked team and hosts, Brazil – they’ve 
seen off the Netherlands – and now they’ve beaten Serbia!

Congratulations, China – women’s volleyball gold medallists.

Tears of consternation and celebration in both quarters, but when the dust 
settles some of these distraught Serbian players will remember, they’ve won 
Olympic silver.

A massive spike from one of the Chinese players and we have a woman down! A 
fierce smack to the chops, and some concern among the Serbian players.

A huge miss here – Serbia have pushed their serve wide, and suddenly it’s 
China 24-23 and just one point away from Olympic gold.

It’s an absolute nail-biter – China were looking like being just a few points 
away from gold, but Serbia have locked this up at 20-20. Can they go on and 
force it to a 5th set?!

It won’t be the final gold of this evening’s session, that honour goes to 
either China or Serbia who are currently locked in a cracker of battle inthe 
women’s volleyball gold medal match.

We’re in the fourth set presently, where China leads 18-16, having won two 
sets to one. Massive contingent inside the Ginásio do Maracanãzinho to support 
the Chinese. Although they did knock out the hosts Brazil in the 
quarter-finals, so I imagine they won’t have too many neutrals cheering them on.

Both the finalists from London 2012 – Brazil and the United States – stormed 
through their groups, but fell short when facing these two sides. The Americans 
did however win bronze earlier today, so some consolation there for world 
number two ranked side.

Hi all, Richard Parkin in the chair, starting the Australian leg of this 
never-ending Guardian Olympics relay.

And pretty good timing on that Chelimo reinstatement – the medallists from the 
men’s 5000m are just mounting the dais now. The American appears to be taking 
it all in in reasonably quiet fashion, but I bet he’s proud as punch on the 
inside.

Cheeky stuff from Mo Farah here, with the sleight of hand of a seasoned 
magician he’s conjured his 10,000m gold out of his pocket and is marking this 
special moment with dual golden orbs. And why not?

Paul Chelimo reinstated to silver in 5000m

Looks like there have been movements on the track (or off the track but you 
know what I mean). This from AP:

American runner Paul Chelimo has been reinstated and will get his Olympic 
silver medal in the men’s 5,000-meter race after all.

Chelimo finished second in Saturday night but was later disqualified for a 
lane infringement. A short time later, track and field’s governing body said 
Chelimo did not break any rules and would get his medal.

Mohammed Ahmed of Canada also was reinstated to finish fourth.

The decision means Bernard Lagat of the U.S. has been bumped from the bronze 
medal back to fifth place. He had been moved up after the initial 
disqualifications.

Mo Farah won the race to complete his second straight Olympic long-distance 
double.

Some more on the end of the 5000m (and the disqualifications). This from AP:

The governing body for track and field says Paul Chelimo, who originally 
finished second in the men’s 5,000-meter race, was disqualified for a lane 
infringement.

The IAAF says Mohammed Ahmed of Canada and Muktar Edris of Ethiopia also were 
disqualified for the same reason.

The decision to disqualify the trio allowed Bernard Lagat of the United States 
to take bronze in the race behind winner Mo Farah and second-place Hagos 
Gebrhiwet.

3.07am BST 03:07  <> 

Swimming’s very own Walter Mitty, Ryan Lochte, has spoken to NBC about his 
night out on the town. Of course, he did that earlier in the week but this time 
his story is a little closer to the truth. If you are one of the 12 poeple in 
the weorld who doesn’t know the story - and it really is astory - Lochte said 
he was robbed on a night out in Rio. Only it turns out he engaged in some petty 
vandalism and had to pay security guards for the damage, which is slightly 
different. “I’m taking full responsibility for it, because I over-exaggerated 
the story,” Lochte told NBC on Saturday. “If I had never done that, we wouldn’t 
be in this mess.”

We’ll have the full story up soon.

The US top the medals table from track and field, as they did in the swimming 
(but where were they in the modern pentathlon, eh?) with 13 golds. Jamaica are 
second with six golds.

USA win the men's 4x400m relay

Botswana won’t let the US go, they’re still chasing LaShawn Merritt as we hit 
the turn but Merritt will win it. Botswana fade badly (boo) and Jamaica finish 
second with the Bahamas comes third.

The men’s 4x400m now. And in the lead after the first lap are ... Botswana? I 
LIKE THAT. I like it so much I write it in caps by accident. Ah, the US are now 
in first after two laps. That is less CAPS worthy.

USA win women's 4x400m gold, Jamaica second, GB third

Going into the final lap it’s USA leading Jamaica by 0.5secs and after that... 
everyone else waaay back. Felix will take USA’s anchor leg with all her 
experience - and she pulls away. That’s her sixth Olympic gold (with some help 
from her team). Jamaica second, GB third.

 Mo Farah: “I can’t believe it...” Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian 
Farah speaks: “I can’t believe it, after the 10k I was so tired. I can’t 
believe I did it. It’s every athlete’s dream. It’s been incredible, I just want 
to go home and see my beautiful kids .”

On the race: “When I hit the front I wasn’t going to let anyone get past me.”

On his motivation: “I hate losing, even at computer games .... I’ve missed 
time with my kids, I wanted to make that time count”

Drama in the javelin, where the leader Julius Yego injured himself on his 
fourth attempt and will have to sit and watch the rest of the competition. It 
gets worse: Thomas Rohler of Germany then throws a huge effort to take the 
lead. Yego looks on, devastated.

Brendan Foster on the BBC has just called Farah “Britain’s greatest ever 
sportsmen”. Foster was a 5000m and 10000m runner himself so he may be a little 
biased but he has a good case.

Farah goes to the British fans in the crowd, draped in the Union Jack. Looking 
at the final lap a few of his rivals collided in the pack behind him, but even 
then he ran a 52.8sec final lap. After running 4600m before that. How many 
people can run 400m in 52.8sec full stop?

Mo Farah wins 5000m!
 Mo Farah takes the men’s 5,000m gold. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian
Bernard Lagat, maybe the only man who can rival Farah for speed moves into a 
good position to strike. It is USA’s Chelimo who will challenge Farah in the 
final straight though but he can’t beat the champion. No one can beat the 
champion! Farah coasts home, serene. And it’s perhaps the easiest of his four 
Olympics golds.

Farah is joined by fellow Brit Andrew Butchart and Uganda’s Cheptegei with 1km 
to go. Still no push from anyone else though.

Once again, Farah’s opponents seem to be helping him out by slowing the pace - 
few of the other guys in the race can compete with his finishing speed so it’s 
in their interest to try and stretch it out. But he’s plodding along at the 
front setting the pace that suits him at the moment.

And we’re off in the men’s 5,000m final. It’s Farah’s to lose, but he stands 
on the brink of history: only Lasse Viren has won the 5,000m and the 10,000m in 
the same Games, and then returned to repeat it at the next one.

Matt Centrowitz is talking to NBC: “It’s unreal right now.” His dad, also 
called Matt, competed for USA in the 5,000 at Montreal 76, and was going crazy 
as he watched his son come down the home straight. “Like father, like son,” 
says Centrowitz Jr, who’s also got that motto tattooed on his chest.

So, a remarkable day’s action. Mo Farah, Neymar, Caster Semenya. Surprises 
from Centrowitz, 37-year-old Ruth Beitia in the high jump – need we go on?

Well, yes, in the best spirit of Samuel Beckett, we must go on; we’ll go on.

This brings a close to day 15 from Rio but the live action continues here:

Speaking of London 1908, not only did Great Britain wipe the floor in the 
tug-of-war, but it’s also the last time that the United States won gold in the 
men’s 1500m.

That is, until now:

An update on China and Great Britain’s respective chances in the men’s 
marathon tomorrow – both countries have three competitors in action, but within 
a field of 155 runners in all.

Should GB hold on to second spot overall it will be the best finishing 
position at an Olympics since the London Games. No, not 2012 – London 1908. 
What a remarkable achievement that would be.

There’s quite a thought-provoking editorial in the Observer about this very 
topic too – with a plea to ensure top-end success feeds back into grassroots 
participation:

The battle for second place in the overall medal table will play out on 
Sunday, with Britain and China no doubt nervously checking their prospects for 
the final day of action.

Team GB is guaranteed one more medal: whether that’s gold or silver depends on 
Joe Joyce’s ability to fend off France’s Tony Yoka inthe men’s 
super-heavyweight boxing final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/great-britain-joe-joyce-rio-final>
.

I’m not sure either nation holds out especially high hopes for the men’s 
marathon, and both are absent from the crucial rhythmic gymnastics team 
all-around final. China does have Yeerlanbieke Katai in the wrestling 65kg 
heats.

And both have an entrant in the men’s cross-country mountain biking. Could 
this be the clincher? Let’s say it’s … unlikely.
 
If you missed it, Caster Semenya was in imposing form as she comfortably won 
the women’s 800m final to claim gold in a personal best time.

That won’t unfortunately be the end of it, with the South African runner 
seemingly set to face further scrutiny from the IAAF and its President, 
Sebastian Coe.

Andy Bull was there in the stadium and is across the latest in this complex 
case:

A lovely report from Owen Gibson from the Olympic Stadium on Allyson Felix, 
the remarkable American sprint-star who claimed hersixth gold medal anchoring 
home the women’s 4x400m relay.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/glittering-allyson-felix-signs-off-from-rio-with-another-golden-moment>
The jury appears to still be out on whether Felix was hard done by in the 
individual 400m after stumble-tumble-dive-gate, but surely this achievement 
will put a smile back on the Olympic champion’s face.
 
And if you missed the day’s big story from the men’s football (no it wasn’t 
Germany losing a penalty shoot out, although that is a minor miracle in and of 
itself) – Brazil have won their first ever Olympic gold in the sport – adding 
to their five World Cups.

Throughout the tournament so much expectation lay on the shoulders of star 
striker Neymar Jnr, so perhaps no surprises when it was the Barcelona forward 
who stepped forward to calmly stroke home the winning penalty.

Some fabulous scenes from the Maracanã, captured here for your viewing 
pleasure.

search away (ie “David Luiz crying”) from feeling cheerful again.
 
With that final gold medal of the night in women’s volleyball factored in, it 
has suddenly become an intriguing battle for second spot on the overall medal

Can China reel in Great Britain on the final day (in wrestling? rhythmic 
gymnastics?) – or will GB’s super heavyweight hero Joe Joyce have the final say?

Our man on the ground in Beijing, Tom Phillips, had some interesting things to 
say on the ‘demise’ of China at these Olympics. That assessment may yet prove 
premature:

In case you hadn’t heard enough from and/or about Ryan Lochte – he’s just 
broken, re-broken, recommenced the non-cessation of silence (please help me) 
overthat incident, in a TV interview critics are acclaiming as ‘tearful’ – with 
the American apologising for intoxication, immaturity and stupidity (among 
other lesser evils).

And forget Conor McGregor and the UFC, at the real wrestling it’s been a 
strong day for Turkey, who’ve continued their solid Olympics in the discipline.

In the men’s freestyle 125kg division Taha Akgul proved too strong for Iran’s 
Komeil Ghasemi, winning their gold medal bout 3-1.
 Proud as punch – the parents of Taha Akgul embrace the new gold medallist.

Also a silver for Turkey’s Selim Yasar who went down to Russia’s Abdulrashid 
Sadulaev in the men’s freestyle 86kg category.

Incidentally, something that may have escaped your notice during the Games 
(but certainly just piqued mine) – in the women’s freestyle wrestling it’s been 
almost a clean sweep for Japan, who have taken home four gold and one silver 
across the six weight division.

Fun fact: 33% of Japan’s entire gold yield at Rio has come from women’s 
wrestling.
 
If you missed it amid the excitement of the athletics track, there’s been some 
special momentsat the taekwondo.

Having already delivered first-ever gold medals for Ivory Coast and Jordan, 
taekwondo has now helped Niger’s Abdoulrazak Alfaga claim his nation’s 
first-ever silver medal, and companion to its only ever Olympic medal, a bronze 
in boxing from Munich 1972.

Alfaga’s opponent, Radik Isaev, emerged victorious in the men’s +80kg 
division, winning the gold for Azerbaijan. With China’s Shuyin Zheng also 
grabbing gold at Carioca Arena 3 in the women’s +67kg category.
 
So that draws to a close the action from day 15. Still plenty to be resolved 
before the shutters are pulled down in Rio and the media caravans wend on their 
merry way.

There’s wrestling, volleyball, handball, a smidgen of gymnastics and mountain 
biking, boxing, basketball and the men’s marathon still to come; and naturally, 
all the pomp and pageantry of the closing ceremony.
 
They came fourth in their group, only just sneaking through after three loses, 
but they’ve send home the world’s best ranked team and hosts, Brazil – they’ve 
seen off the Netherlands – and now they’ve beaten Serbia!

Congratulations, China – women’s volleyball gold medallists.

Tears of consternation and celebration in both quarters, but when the dust 
settles some of these distraught Serbian players will remember, they’ve won 
Olympic silver.
 
A massive spike from one of the Chinese players and we have a woman down! A 
fierce smack to the chops, and some concern among the Serbian players.

A huge miss here – Serbia have pushed their serve wide, and suddenly it’s 
China 24-23 and just one point away from Olympic gold.
 
It’s an absolute nail-biter – China were looking like being just a few points 
away from gold, but Serbia have locked this up at 20-20. Can they go on and 
force it to a 5th set?!
 
It won’t be the final gold of this evening’s session, that honour goes to 
either China or Serbia who are currently locked in a cracker of battle inthe 
women’s volleyball gold medal match.

We’re in the fourth set presently, where China leads 18-16, having won two 
sets to one. Massive contingent inside the Ginásio do Maracanãzinho to support 
the Chinese. Although they did knock out the hosts Brazil in the 
quarter-finals, so I imagine they won’t have too many neutrals cheering them on.

Both the finalists from London 2012 – Brazil and the United States – stormed 
through their groups, but fell short when facing these two sides. The Americans 
did however win bronze earlier today, so some consolation there for world 
number two ranked side.
 
Hi all, Richard Parkin in the chair, starting the Australian leg of this 
never-ending Guardian Olympics relay.

And pretty good timing on that Chelimo reinstatement – the medallists from the 
men’s 5000m are just mounting the dais now. The American appears to be taking 
it all in in reasonably quiet fashion, but I bet he’s proud as punch on the 
inside.

Cheeky stuff from Mo Farah here, with the sleight of hand of a seasoned 
magician he’s conjured his 10,000m gold out of his pocket and is marking this 
special moment with dual golden orbs. And why not?

Looks like there have been movements on the track (or off the track but you 
know what I mean). This from AP:

American runner Paul Chelimo has been reinstated and will get his Olympic 
silver medal in the men’s 5,000-meter race after all.

Chelimo finished second in Saturday night but was later disqualified for a 
lane infringement. A short time later, track and field’s governing body said 
Chelimo did not break any rules and would get his medal.

Mohammed Ahmed of Canada also was reinstated to finish fourth.

The decision means Bernard Lagat of the U.S. has been bumped from the bronze 
medal back to fifth place. He had been moved up after the initial 
disqualifications.

Mo Farah won the race to complete his second straight Olympic long-distance 
double.
 
Some more on the end of the 5000m (and the disqualifications). This from AP:

The governing body for track and field says Paul Chelimo, who originally 
finished second in the men’s 5,000-meter race, was disqualified for a lane 
infringement.

The IAAF says Mohammed Ahmed of Canada and Muktar Edris of Ethiopia also were 
disqualified for the same reason.

The decision to disqualify the trio allowed Bernard Lagat of the United States 
to take bronze in the race behind winner Mo Farah and second-place Hagos 
Gebrhiwet.
 
Swimming’s very own Walter Mitty, Ryan Lochte, has spoken to NBC about his 
night out on the town. Of course, he did that earlier in the week but this time 
his story is a little closer to the truth. If you are one of the 12 poeple in 
the weorld who doesn’t know the story - and it really is astory - Lochte said 
he was robbed on a night out in Rio. Only it turns out he engaged in some petty 
vandalism and had to pay security guards for the damage, which is slightly 
different. “I’m taking full responsibility for it, because I over-exaggerated 
the story,” Lochte told NBC on Saturday. “If I had never done that, we wouldn’t 
be in this mess.”

We’ll have the full story up soon. 
 
Samuel L Jackson has this to say about Mo Farah’s victory. Short but sweet:

The US top the medals table from track and field, as they did in the swimming 
(but where were they in the modern pentathlon, eh?) with 13 golds. Jamaica are 
second with six golds.

Botswana won’t let the US go, they’re still chasing LaShawn Merritt as we hit 
the turn but Merritt will win it. Botswana fade badly (boo) and Jamaica finish 
second with the Bahamas comes third.
 
The men’s 4x400m now. And in the lead after the first lap are ... Botswana? I 
LIKE THAT. I like it so much I write it in caps by accident. Ah, the US are now 
in first after two laps. That is less CAPS worthy.
 
Allyson Felix is now the most decorated Olympic female track athlete of all 
time with that gold.

Going into the final lap it’s USA leading Jamaica by 0.5secs and after that... 
everyone else waaay back. Felix will take USA’s anchor leg with all her 
experience - and she pulls away. That’s her sixth Olympic gold (with some help 
from her team). Jamaica second, GB third.

And now we have the women’s 4x400m. USA and Jamaica will be favourites 
here.They are 1-2 after the first lap.
 
A few disqualifications in the 5000m, USSA’s Chelimo loses his silver after 
some pushing in the pack.

Kershorn Walcott, the defending Olympic champions has his last throw but he 
will have to settle for bronze. And Thomas Rohler of Germany takes his title.
 
With Farah’s win, Team GB now has 65 medals, equalling the record haul of 
London 2012 - and with another guaranteed silver or gold to come from Joe 
Joyce’s super-heavyweight boxing final on Sunday.
  Mo Farah: “I can’t believe it...” Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian 
Farah speaks: “I can’t believe it, after the 10k I was so tired. I can’t 
believe I did it. It’s every athlete’s dream. It’s been incredible, I just want 
to go home and see my beautiful kids .”

On the race: “When I hit the front I wasn’t going to let anyone get past me.”

On his motivation: “I hate losing, even at computer games .... I’ve missed 
time with my kids, I wanted to make that time count”
 
Drama in the javelin, where the leader Julius Yego injured himself on his 
fourth attempt and will have to sit and watch the rest of the competition. It 
gets worse: Thomas Rohler of Germany then throws a huge effort to take the 
lead. Yego looks on, devastated.

Beitia is 37 and it’s her first ever Olympic medal. Worth the wait, I’d say. 
 
Brendan Foster on the BBC has just called Farah “Britain’s greatest ever 
sportsmen”. Foster was a 5000m and 10000m runner himself so he may be a little 
biased but he has a good case.
 
Farah goes to the British fans in the crowd, draped in the Union Jack. Looking 
at the final lap a few of his rivals collided in the pack behind him, but even 
then he ran a 52.8sec final lap. After running 4600m before that. How many 
people can run 400m in 52.8sec full stop?
 
For the record USA’s Chelimo was silver and Ethiopia’s Gebremeskel third.

Bernard Lagat, maybe the only man who can rival Farah for speed moves into a 
good position to strike. It is USA’s Chelimo who will challenge Farah in the 
final straight though but he can’t beat the champion. No one can beat the 
champion! Farah coasts home, serene. And it’s perhaps the easiest of his four 
Olympics golds.
 
Two laps to go Farah still leads. And we’re into the final lap. 
 
Farah is joined by fellow Brit Andrew Butchart and Uganda’s Cheptegei with 1km 
to go. Still no push from anyone else though.
 
Once again, Farah’s opponents seem to be helping him out by slowing the pace - 
few of the other guys in the race can compete with his finishing speed so it’s 
in their interest to try and stretch it out. But he’s plodding along at the 
front setting the pace that suits him at the moment.
 
And now over to Tom Lutz. Thanks for reading!
 
Paul Chelimo of USA also running strongly in third after the first kilometre. 
The pace is 2:37.40 – that’s pretty quick.
 
The two Ethiopians, Gebremeskel and Gebrhiwet, have gone to the front early. 
Farah back in about ninth place after 800m.
 
And we’re off in the men’s 5,000m final. It’s Farah’s to lose, but he stands 
on the brink of history: only Lasse Viren has won the 5,000m and the 10,000m in 
the same Games, and then returned to repeat it at the next one.
 
Yego still leads in the javelin. Thomas Röhler is second with 87.40m, and 
Walcott third. We’re through three rounds.
 
Next up we’ve got Britain’s Mo Farah competing in the men’s 5,000m final. He’s 
aiming to do the “double double” – gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m at successive 
Olympics.
 
Matt Centrowitz is talking to NBC: “It’s unreal right now.” His dad, also 
called Matt, competed for USA in the 5,000 at Montreal 76, and was going crazy 
as he watched his son come down the home straight. “Like father, like son,” 
says Centrowitz Jr, who’s also got that motto tattooed on his chest.
 
Britain’s Lynsey Sharp ran a PB of 1:57.69 to finish sixth, incidentally. 
Fifth-placed Jozwik of Poland also ran a lifetime best, as did Wambui.
 
Semenya passed Niyonsaba with 200m to go, and no one could catch her. Wambui 
of Kenya passed Canada’s Melissa Bishop in the final stages to make it an 
African 1-2-3.

Semenya wins gold! Niyonsaba second, Wambui third! 1min 55.28sec the time – 
outside world record pace, but good enough!

At the bell, it’s Semenya with Niyonsaba of Burundi.
 
And we’re off! Semenya leading through 200m. 
 
Now it’s Caster Semenya in the women’s 800m final. Can we expecting a world 
record from the classy South African? From the inside, it’s Grace of USA, 
Poland’s Jozwik, Semenya, Wambui, Niyonsaba, Bishop, Sharp, Arzamasova.
 
The high jump bar is going to 1.97m with 12 women still alive – Beitia of 
Spain, Lowe of USA and Trost of Italy are perfect so far.
 
Meanwhile, Julius Yego, the world champion, has moved into the lead in the 
javelin with a throw of 88.24m in the first round – that’s a season’s best for 
the Kenyan.
 
Mel Sheppard was the man who won the 1500m at London 1908. Matt Centrowitz 
joins an exclusive club.
