 to end the country’s 10-month spell without a government.

 that have engulfed his party.

Thousands of people took to the streets around congress in the run-up to the 
vote to protest against Rajoy and the corruption allegations and spending cuts 
that marked his first term in office.

“It’s going to be the same government, or similar, [as in] the past four 
years, which was disastrous forSpain <https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain>
,” Carmen López, a retired computer technician told Agence France-Presse.


Although the Spanish Socialist party (PSOE) decided to abstain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/spains-socialists-lift-veto-to-allow-conservatives-to-rule-as-minority>
 in the vote to end the impasse and allow Rajoy’s return to power, it has vowed 
to fight his minority government every step of the way.

The socialists told Rajoy on Saturday that they had abstained for the good of 
the country and not to “back your odious reforms nor to pardon the grave 
corruption” within the PP.

“From today you are no longer acting [prime minister],” said the PSOE 
spokesman Antonio Hernando. “You now do not have the absolute majority that 
you’ve been feigning all year. You’re now in a clear minority and under the 
close watch of everyone in this congress.”

Despite the rhetoric, however, the socialists remain divided and in the hands 
of a caretaker leadership sincePedro Sánchez was ousted earlier this month  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/pedro-sanchez-resigns-as-leader-of-spains-socialist-party>
over his refusal to allow the party to abstain.

And while he may lack a majority, Rajoy has the power to threaten fresh 
elections in which the PSOE would lose ground to the anti-austerity Unidos 
Podemos coalition, which has itssights set on leapfrogging the socialists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/podemos-under-pressure-spain-political-deadlock-continues>
 to become the pre-eminent force of the Spanish left.

Although Rajoy has plenty on his plate – not least getting next year’s budget 
agreed, tackling the deficit and fixing the pension system – he has several 
tools at his disposal.

“I think what Rajoy is going to try to do is some pork-barrelling and 
horsetrading with the Basque and the Canary Islands parties to try to get over 
the line and pass the budget,” said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the 
political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence.

“If that doesn’t work, it’s going to be complicated because the socialist 
party will be under pressure to abstain to facilitate the adoption of the 
budget. Rajoy has a very powerful tool in this regard, which is early 
elections.”

Similarly pressing is the Catalan question: the region’s pro-independence 
government ispushing ahead with plans to form a sovereign state next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hundreds-of-thousands-of-catalans-stage-independence-protests>
 despite fierce opposition from Madrid.

Antón Losada, a professor of political science at the University of Santiago 
de Compostela and the author of a book about Rajoy, predicted the current 
political climate would see the PP leader relying on the skills he acquired 
during his time in José María Aznar’s government in the late 1990s.

“He turned out to be one of Aznar’s most reasonable, most receptive 
ministers,” Losada said. “He was a bit of a firefighter for the Aznar 
government – a good negotiator and a guy who could do deals. We won’t see a new 
Rajoy, we’ll see the Rajoy we knew before he became the PP leader.”


Rajoy’s reputation for sitting back and letting others make the political 
weather belied the manoeuvrings of a skilled tactician, he said. Far from doing 
nothing after inconclusive elections in June and December, Rajoy had simply 
been following a plan.

“Rajoy came to two conclusions after December’s election: first that that 
they’d never let him govern on the results, so there was no point going for an 
investiture, and second that his opponents were so deeply locked in rivalry 
that they wouldn’t be able to reach an agreement to offer an alternative,” he 
said.

“It was simply a matter of time – and that explains his strategy. He did what 
he had to do: bide his time and withstand the pressure.”

Barroso agreed: “If Rajoy is remembered for something in terms of political 
strategy, it will be this wait-and-see strategy. He had the best cards and he’s 
stuck to them and it’s basically worked very well for him.”
