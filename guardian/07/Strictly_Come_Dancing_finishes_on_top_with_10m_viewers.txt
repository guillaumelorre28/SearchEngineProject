BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing> final averaged 
more than 10 million viewers on Saturday night for Caroline Flack’s victory, 
putting the seal on another year of ratings dominance over ITV rival The X 
Factor.

However, Strictly was about 1 million down on last year’s final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/23/strictly-come0dancing-final-bbc1-abbey-clancey>
 and the lowest for any climax to the long-running celebrity talent show since 
2009.

The main edition of the Strictly final averaged 10.6 million viewers and a 
46.4% share from 6.30pm; with the results show averaging 10.2 million and 42.8% 
from 8.50pm.

The X Factor final averaged just over 9 million viewers the previous weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/15/the-x-factor-viewing-figures-ben-haenow>
.

Last year’s Strictly final averaged 11.5 million and 48.1% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/23/strictly-come0dancing-final-bbc1-abbey-clancey>
 for the main show and just under 11.5 million and 45.8% for the results 
edition.

Saturday’s climax to the show’s 12th series was the lowest-rating final since 
BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> presenter Chris Hollins won in 
2009. Hollins’ win averaged 10.1 million viewers for the main show, and 10.3 
million for the results.

The Strictly final is still in with a shout of beating the top-rating edition 
of the 2014 series so far when consolidated figures – including seven-day catch 
viewing on Sky+ and other digital recording devices – are published.

Strictly’s top-rating show so far this year is the 15 November edition, which 
averaged 10.3 million on live overnights, rising to 11.5 million for 
consolidated viewing.

However, Strictly looks unlikely to improve on its seventh spot in the top 10 
rating UK shows of 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/17/the-great-british-bake-off-tv-ratings-2014>
, with an I’m a Celebrity outing from 16 November in sixth place, on 12 million 
viewers.

The other main channels were effectively taking a pre-Christmas breather on 
Saturday night, with repeats all round – including ITV’s Harry Potter and the 
Half-Blood Prince (7pm: 3.2 million/13.9%), Channel 4’s Four Christmases 
(9.30pm: 0.9 million/4.6%) and Channel 5’s Scrooge (7.55pm: 800,000/3.3%).
