It seems that, unlike most of us, TV execs haven’t heard of proverbs or irony. 
The adage “too many cooks” has passed them by and cooking shows on TV have been 
allowed to multiply beyond all reason. Eventually, even the weather forecast 
will be a close-up of a glistening pan-fried quail with a sugar-frosted 
thermometer up its bum.

Whatever happy, wholesome broth my TV experience used to be is now a bland, 
barely viscous puddle that’s totally oversaturated with people chasing their 
food dreams – and I’m starting to feel a little bit sick.

Last week I hoped the net number of chefs on my flatscreen cooking window 
would decrease. MasterChef – the least offensive of its species – finished, its 
victor (Billie McKay)decided by a devilishly tricky Heston Blumenthal pressure 
test that involved55 steps 
<http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/masterchef/recipes/botrytis-cinerea> and a 
wormhole in space-time through which you had to send ingredients back to your 
earlier self.

It seemed an arbitrarily technical ending; like having a series of the X 
Factor where the grand finale requires the contestants to masterTuvan throat

The Hotplate: Channel 7 takes Nine to court over 'rip off' of My Kitchen Rules

Why, oh why then, with a bit of scheduling space freed up for non-culinary 
purposes, would the sofa gods blight us all by tossing two more cooking shows 
into the mix? Worse still, they’re rehashes of existing horrors. “If you 
enjoyed your steak for main, you’ll love this beef crumble, followed by beef 
and crackers.”

The Hotplate 
<http://www.9jumpin.com.au/show/the-hotplate/episodes/season-1/episode-3/rocksalt/>
 kicked off on Nine on Tuesday, a show no doubt created to answer the question, 
“What would My Kitchen Rules’ Pete and Manu look like if they were hollowed out 
and two other presenters wore their skins?” Look carefully and in between 
courses you can actually see judge Scott Pickett readjusting his Manu flesh 
outfit. It’s not just the hosts and their mannerisms: the entire show appears 
to be the MKR format grafted onto a different channel. Little surprise then that
Seven is suing Nine

in what’s likely to be the most depressing legal battle of our time.

In fact they should turn that into a reality series, Networks Got No Talent. A 
row of TV execs would pitch their near-identical shows to a panel of judges, 
who then decide who’s guilty of ripping the others off. First prize is the 
right to boast that at least your aggravatingly naff reality TV idea wasn’t 
stolen.

The point is, just avoid copying MKR. Not for fear of legal repercussions, but 
because MKR is awful and you’ve effectively just doubled the amount of a bad 
thing.

To complicate things further, Seven has also sought to replace MKR with a 
vague copy on its own channel .Restaurant Revolution 
<https://au.tv.yahoo.com/plus7/restaurant-revolution/-/watch/29142026/restaurant-revolution-thu-30-jul-season-1-episode-4/>
 lives up to the first half of its name, but as to the second? Well, it all 
feels eerily familiar. If The Hotplate is doing a Hannibal Lecter by wearing 
another show’s face, then with its stitched together elements of Shark Tank, 
The Block, and MKR, Restaurant Revolution is definitely Leatherface.

Ultimately, the end result of the networks carving each other’s (and their 
own) shows up out of a psychopathic dedication to unoriginality is that if 
you’re allergic to reality cooking shows, currently your television is best 
avoided altogether.
