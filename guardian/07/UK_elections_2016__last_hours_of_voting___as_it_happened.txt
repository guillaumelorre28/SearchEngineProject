We’re on the downward slide to polls closing - just 30 minutes to go. And 
remember, if you’re still waiting in line to vote when the clock strikes 10, 
you still get to cast a ballot.

One of the first things to be established very early on as the ballot boxes 
are opened in Northern Ireland on Friday morning will be turnout. Back in 1998, 
just months after the historic Good Friday Agreement, there was huge enthusiasm 
for the restoration of devolution to the post-Troubles traumatised region.

The first election turnout to a revived cross-community assembly since 1974 
was huge – 70% of the electorate voted. Yet the trend after the post-Good 
Friday Agreement peace deal reflected diminishing faith in the political 
process. In 2003, the next devolved assembly elections turnout was still a 
respectable 63%.
 Voters enter at a polling station in Sydenham, east Belfast, earlier today.

Four years later turnout fell to 62%. However, in the last Stormont assembly 
election battle only 54% voted. The dip in voter participation reflected a 
growing disillusionment with the political arrangement held up as a shining 
example of peace process politics around the world. Turnout tomorrow therefore 
will in itself be a story – particularly if it was to fall below 50%.

 The polling station at Southgate West community centre in Crawley. 
The sun is setting in Southgate ward in Crawley, where three council seats are 
up for re-election. Here is one of two seats lost byLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> in 2015, when the party’s 
majority was cut to just one councillor.

Voters at the polling station at Southgate West community centre say they have 
been bombarded with leaflets through their letterbox. “Especially the Tories,” 
says Surinder Sagoo, 51, who came to the polling station with her two 
daughters. “But I didn’t realise it was so close here.”

Sagoo says it is national issues, such as the NHS and the junior doctors’ 
strike, that affected the way she chose to vote. “I voted for the lesser of two 
evils here I think,” she said. “One local issue is the hospital and the closure 
of the A&E department. Now we have to travel a long way to get to a hospital. 
That’s something which would affect which party I choose.”

The family always vote together: “Voting is really important, if you don’t use 
it, then you can’t say you don’t like something.”


Her daughter Meenisha, 26, said her parents had instilled in her that sense of 
responsibility: “We’ve always voted since we were first able to; they’d never 
force me to vote, but I always would.”

Aside from Cannock Chase, some other potentially key Midlands councils to 
watch tonight include:
• Walsall: A minority Tory administration holds control, but Labour hopes of 
success here face competition also from Ukip, which is contesting 13 of the 
seats today.
• Solihull: Another of a number of West Midlands metropolitan councils where 
up to a third of its seats are up for grabs. Tory controlled, the official 
opposition comes from theGreen party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/green-party>.
• Nuneaton and Bedworth: An area where all three MPs are Tory, but the council 
is Labour controlled. The latter need to demonstrate that they are still the 
dominant force at a local level.

How many families are there like this up and down the UK? I’ve been chatting 
to a couple ahead of casting their votes in the Midlands district council area 
of Cannock Chase – something of a bellwether.

Clive and Cheryl Aanansen are divided on Europe as well as domestic politics. 
He’s a trade unionist and supporter of one party, she is a staunch backer of 
another and a voter who still can’t forgiveLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> for, as she put it, “spending all 
the money and leaving this mess behind”.

Yet they were united on what they regarded as the most burning issue in their 
local ward: dog fouling. “It’s about people just having respect for one 
another,” said Cheryl, as her husband nodded. Another thing we both feel very 
strongly about is the antisocial behaviour. It’s a nice area, but some young 
people really don’t behave sometimes.”

National issues were factors in how they voted – though somewhat distant ones. 
As for Clive’s view of the Labour leadership, he added: “To be honest I don’t 
really like Jeremy Corbyn, and while I might think about swaying towards the 
Tories I’ll probably stick with Labour.”

Both also believe that it is in areas like their own that Labour needs to be 
performing strongly if the party hopes to have any chance of success in the 
next national election.

The calm before the (#Bellwether

the opening scenes of 28 Days Laterhttps://t.co/qykQEpjawK

While the roads leading up to their polling station was a leafy one, for 
example, with new Mercedes and BMWs sitting behind gated gardens, Cannock’s 
broader bellwether status is underlined by other mixed demographics, which 
include pockets of urban deprivation, traditional Labour strongholds with their 
roots in coal mining, as well as affluent Staffordshire villages.

At a Westminster level, Cannock Chase is a semi-marginal Tory seat, having 
been a surprise gain for theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> in 2010. Previously it was 
a safe Labour seat during the 1997, 2001 and 2005 contests.

Increasingly, the area has also emerged as an affluent commuter area for the 
West Midlands area to its south. Is the Labour party’s message getting through 
to those voters?

The sun’s been shining all day in the north-east coastal town of Hartlepool, a 
key target for Nigel Farage’s Ukip as Iexplained earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/05/uk-national-and-local-elections-polling-day-live-updates?page=with:block-572b324ae4b0d509448a63c3#block-572b324ae4b0d509448a63c3>
. With three hours left to vote, the Ukippers are in confident mood. Jonathan 
Arnott, the party’s regional MEP, has tweeted:
Jonathan Arnott MEP (@JonathanArnott) 
Great organisation in our target wards here in Hartlepool. All looking good; 
fingers crossed for a great election night!

<https://twitter.com/JonathanArnott/status/728161095781785601> 
Has Labour’s ship sailed in Hartlepool? Is HMS Ukip steaming in to harbour? Is 
Captain Farage making waves? Who knows, but what’s certain is that political 
metaphors should be avoided at all costs.

We’re on the downward slide to polls closing - just 30 minutes to go. And 
remember, if you’re still waiting in line to vote when the clock strikes 10, 
you still get to cast a ballot.
 
One of the first things to be established very early on as the ballot boxes 
are opened in Northern Ireland on Friday morning will be turnout. Back in 1998, 
just months after the historic Good Friday Agreement, there was huge enthusiasm 
for the restoration of devolution to the post-Troubles traumatised region.

The first election turnout to a revived cross-community assembly since 1974 
was huge – 70% of the electorate voted. Yet the trend after the post-Good 
Friday Agreement peace deal reflected diminishing faith in the political 
process. In 2003, the next devolved assembly elections turnout was still a 
respectable 63%.

Four years later turnout fell to 62%. However, in the last Stormont assembly 
election battle only 54% voted. The dip in voter participation reflected a 
growing disillusionment with the political arrangement held up as a shining 
example of peace process politics around the world. Turnout tomorrow therefore 
will in itself be a story – particularly if it was to fall below 50%.

Chuka Umunna, former business secretary and Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP for Streatham, is still out 
and about in south London campaigning for every last vote.
  The polling station at Southgate West community centre in Crawley. 
The sun is setting in Southgate ward in Crawley, where three council seats are 
up for re-election. Here is one of two seats lost byLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> in 2015, when the party’s 
majority was cut to just one councillor.

Voters at the polling station at Southgate West community centre say they have 
been bombarded with leaflets through their letterbox. “Especially the Tories,” 
says Surinder Sagoo, 51, who came to the polling station with her two 
daughters. “But I didn’t realise it was so close here.”

Sagoo says it is national issues, such as the NHS and the junior doctors’ 
strike, that affected the way she chose to vote. “I voted for the lesser of two 
evils here I think,” she said. “One local issue is the hospital and the closure 
of the A&E department. Now we have to travel a long way to get to a hospital. 
That’s something which would affect which party I choose.”

The family always vote together: “Voting is really important, if you don’t use 
it, then you can’t say you don’t like something.”


Her daughter Meenisha, 26, said her parents had instilled in her that sense of 
responsibility: “We’ve always voted since we were first able to; they’d never 
force me to vote, but I always would.”

 
Aside from Cannock Chase, some other potentially key Midlands councils to 
watch tonight include:
• Walsall: A minority Tory administration holds control, but Labour hopes of 
success here face competition also from Ukip, which is contesting 13 of the 
seats today.
• Solihull: Another of a number of West Midlands metropolitan councils where 
up to a third of its seats are up for grabs. Tory controlled, the official 
opposition comes from theGreen party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/green-party>.
• Nuneaton and Bedworth: An area where all three MPs are Tory, but the council 
is Labour controlled. The latter need to demonstrate that they are still the 
dominant force at a local level.
  LSE Democratic Dashboard 
As we head into the final two hours of polling, the LSE’s Democratic Dashboard 
<http://democraticdashboard.com/> might prove useful. It offers interactive 
details on all the elections being held today, who is standing - and when a 
result it expected.

How many families are there like this up and down the UK? I’ve been chatting 
to a couple ahead of casting their votes in the Midlands district council area 
of Cannock Chase – something of a bellwether.

Clive and Cheryl Aanansen are divided on Europe as well as domestic politics. 
He’s a trade unionist and supporter of one party, she is a staunch backer of 
another and a voter who still can’t forgiveLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> for, as she put it, “spending all 
the money and leaving this mess behind”.

Yet they were united on what they regarded as the most burning issue in their 
local ward: dog fouling. “It’s about people just having respect for one 
another,” said Cheryl, as her husband nodded. Another thing we both feel very 
strongly about is the antisocial behaviour. It’s a nice area, but some young 
people really don’t behave sometimes.”

National issues were factors in how they voted – though somewhat distant ones. 
As for Clive’s view of the Labour leadership, he added: “To be honest I don’t 
really like Jeremy Corbyn, and while I might think about swaying towards the 
Tories I’ll probably stick with Labour.”

Both also believe that it is in areas like their own that Labour needs to be 
performing strongly if the party hopes to have any chance of success in the 
next national election.

The calm before the (#Bellwether 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bellwether?src=hash> ) storm? Touch in Cannock of 
the opening scenes of 28 Days Laterhttps://t.co/qykQEpjawK

While the roads leading up to their polling station was a leafy one, for 
example, with new Mercedes and BMWs sitting behind gated gardens, Cannock’s 
broader bellwether status is underlined by other mixed demographics, which 
include pockets of urban deprivation, traditional Labour strongholds with their 
roots in coal mining, as well as affluent Staffordshire villages.

At a Westminster level, Cannock Chase is a semi-marginal Tory seat, having 
been a surprise gain for theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> in 2010. Previously it was 
a safe Labour seat during the 1997, 2001 and 2005 contests.

Increasingly, the area has also emerged as an affluent commuter area for the 
West Midlands area to its south. Is the Labour party’s message getting through 
to those voters?
 
The sun’s been shining all day in the north-east coastal town of Hartlepool, a 
key target for Nigel Farage’s Ukip as Iexplained earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/05/uk-national-and-local-elections-polling-day-live-updates?page=with:block-572b324ae4b0d509448a63c3#block-572b324ae4b0d509448a63c3>
. With three hours left to vote, the Ukippers are in confident mood. Jonathan 
Arnott, the party’s regional MEP, has tweeted:
Jonathan Arnott MEP (@JonathanArnott) 
Great organisation in our target wards here in Hartlepool. All looking good; 
fingers crossed for a great election night!
 <https://twitter.com/JonathanArnott/status/728161095781785601> May 5, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JonathanArnott/status/728161095781785601> 
Has Labour’s ship sailed in Hartlepool? Is HMS Ukip steaming in to harbour? Is 
Captain Farage making waves? Who knows, but what’s certain is that political 
metaphors should be avoided at all costs.
