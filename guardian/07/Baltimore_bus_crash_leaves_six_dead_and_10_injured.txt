At least six people died and 10 were injured in a school bus crash in Baltimore
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/baltimore> on Tuesday morning.

Baltimore police said the school bus struck a car

cemetery before it crashed into the side of a commuter bus.

The school bus driver died, and the only other person on the bus, an aide, 
survived, Baltimore police spokesman TJ Smith said, adding that there were no 
children aboard the school bus.

The school bus crashed into the driver’s side of a Maryland

bus, which was decimated.

Smith said the scene of the crash was “horrific”, and the worst he had seen in 
his career. “It literally looks like a bomb exploded in the bus, and it’s 
catastrophic damage,” Smith said.

At a press conference a couple hours after the 7am crash, Baltimore’s fire 
chief, Niles Ford, said firefighters were still searching the inside of the MTA 
bus for victims.

The school bus was on its way to pick up a student in south-west Baltimore 
before it drove into oncoming traffic and hit the commuter bus.

Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash. 

“Obviously, folks who are on a bus this time of the morning are working folks, 
and they’re on their way to make a living,” said the Baltimore police 
commissioner, Kevin Davis. “They’re on their way to their jobs, and they’re on 
their way to support their families, so our hearts and prayers go out to them, 
to their families, to their co-workers as well.”
