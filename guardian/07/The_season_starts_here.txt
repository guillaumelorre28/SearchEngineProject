Sate your appetite for the return of English football on the eve of the new 
season with our comprehensive club-by-club Premier League guide. From champions 
Manchester City to new arrivals Reading, Southampton and West Ham, each of the 
20 teams is analysed by our team of football writers. Will Manchester United be 
able to grab back the top-flight title from their upstart neighbours? What 
chances for the seven new managers taking charge of new teams going into the 
campaign? And who will survive the drop â€“ or suffer the chop? We also have 
added previews on the Championship, League One and League Two as the English 
league kicks off this coming Saturday.
