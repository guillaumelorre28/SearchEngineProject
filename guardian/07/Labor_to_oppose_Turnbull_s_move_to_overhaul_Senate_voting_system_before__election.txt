Labor will oppose the Coalition’s proposed changes to the Senate voting system 
as the government moves to rush them throughwith the support of the Greens and 
Senator Nick Xenophon

, before an election between July and September.

Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> 
formally announced the changes on Monday, declaring they were in the interests 
of voters because they would end the secretive preference deals that have 
allowed backroom operators to “game” the system.

Labor was deeply divided on the reforms, with Labor senators, including the 
Senate leader, Penny Wong, and deputy leader, Stephen Conroy, saying they would 
entrench aCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> 
advantage in the upper house, but the shadow special minister of state, Gary 
Gray, strongly arguing they were “the right thing to do” in the interests of 
democracy.

It is understood the shadow cabinet decided on Monday night to recommend to 
the caucus that Labor oppose the moves.

 The bill has been referred to the joint standing committee on electoral 
matters with a reporting deadline of 2 March, paving the way for a debate and 
decision in the Senate before parliament rises for the pre-budget break.

Senate voting reform stirs up hornet's nest between likely winners and losers

The moves – seen as an attempt to curb the influence of micro-parties – 
immediately triggered ire from numerous Senate crossbenchers who have been 
crucial to the fate of contentious legislation.

Ricky Muir <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ricky-muir>, the 
Australian Motoring Enthusiast party senator who was elected with just 0.51% of 
Victorian primary votes at the 2013 election, accused the prime minister of a 
“power grab” and said he would “return the favour in the chamber”.

The Victorian independent senator John Madigan denounced what he saw as 
“political trickery of the highest order”.

The Liberal Democratic party senator for New South Wales, David Leyonhjelm, 
said the government’s “dirty little deal with the Greens and Nick Xenophon” 
would leave the Senate dominated by the Coalition, Labor, the Greens and 
Xenophon.

Electoral analysts have said the changes are likely to advantage Coalition’s 
electoral prospects in Senate elections 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/19/senate-voting-reform-stirs-up-hornets-nest-between-likely-winners-and-losers>
 and disadvantage micro-parties, but Turnbull declined to directly address that 
point at a media conference in Canberra on Monday.


“The only person that will benefit from these is the voter, because the voter 
will determine where their preferences go, so it’s up to the voter,” the prime 
minister said.

The changes will abolish group voting tickets, the party-submitted mechanism 
for determining how preferences flow for the 97% of people who just vote one 
for their preferred choice “above the line”, and introduce optional 
preferential voting.

Senate ballot papers will say that people can vote above the line by numbering 
at least six of the boxes in the order of their choice.

Turnbull said if a person numbered only one square above the line, or marked 
fewer than six preferences, the vote would still be counted. This was an 
attempt to allay concerns that the changes would lead to an increase in 
“informal” voting and disenfranchise some voters, who have been told for years 
that they can just vote one on Senate ballots.

The vote would simply be “exhausted” – or not distributed to another party – 
at the point at which no more preferences were marked.

People would still have the alternative of voting “below the line”, with 
people having to mark the order of their preferences for all candidates 
standing for election to the Senate in that state. Until now, this has been an 
onerous process that sometimes involves selecting more than 100 candidates.


But the legislation would also “reduce the number of informal votes by 
increasing the number of allowable ‘mistakes’ from three to five, as long as 
90% of the ballot paper below the line is filled in correctly”.


The changes flow from a May 2014 report by the joint standing committee on 
electoral matters 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Electoral_Matters/2013_General_Election/Interim_Report>
, which found preferences were being “harvested in a whirlpool of exchanges” in 
a distortion of the will of voters.

The government has stopped short of one of the committee’s recommendations to 
increase the number of members a party must have to register, citing a lack of 
parliamentary support for that measure.

But the legislation will prevent individuals holding relevant official 
positions in multiple parties.

Turnbull said changes were an “important reform” to safeguard democracy. He 
said until now, people were unaware of where their Senate preferences would 
flow unless they looked up the group voting tickets on the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC) website.

“The system has been taken advantage of; there is no doubt about that,” he 
said.

“The last Senate election was widely criticised. Australians were astonished 
to see people elected to the Senate whose primary votes were a fraction in the 
case of one senator from Victoria, about half of 1% of the vote … I think 
Australians were shocked by some of the results of the election.

“The operation of any electoral system, any voting system, should be to 
clearly and transparently translate the wish of the voter into a parliamentary 
result. The current system for voting in the Senate is anything but 
transparent.”

The special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, said political parties were 
trading votes away in secret without reflecting the true intention of the 
voter. He said the Senate would debate the legislation from 2 March onwards 
“for as long as it takes”.

The AEC, which is planning an education campaign, has said it needs at least 
three months between the passage of the legislation and an election to 
implement them.

Turnbull said he was “working on the assumption that the election will be held 
at the normal time, which is August/September/October”, signalling a cool 
disposition towards thepossibility of a double-dissolution election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/21/barnaby-joyce-says-inoperable-senate-may-trigger-double-dissolution-election>
, which could not be held after July.

Labor, which has been deeply divided about the changes and their implications 
for the makeup of the Senate, was examining the legislation on Monday.

Labor’s shadow special minister of state, Gary Gray, who served on the 
committee that recommended changes, called for reform “to accurately translate 
the wishes of voters into winners and losers in the parliament”.

But the party’s Senate leadership, Penny Wong and Stephen Conroy, have 
vehemently oppose the changes. Conroy has warned that a Coalition government 
would either gain an absolute majority or be able to pass legislation through 
the Senate with only Xenophon’s vote or votes.

The leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/richard-di-natale>, said the system 
was “broken” and the arguments about a particular party gaining an advantage 
were “nonsense”.

“We have a system where the back-room preference dealers are determining the 
outcomes of elections, rather than voters,” Di Natale said.

“The point here is that this is a reform that should be done because it’s good 
for democracy.”

Di Natale offered a pointed message to Labor as it considered its stance. “If 
you are worried about losing control of the upper house or the lower house then 
do your job better,” he said.

“If anything is to advantage the Coalition it will be the performance of the 
modern-dayLabor party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>.”

The Greens senator Lee Rhiannon said the party would look at closely at the 
bill’s detail “to ensure that it does live up to the high standards” needed for 
electoral reform.

Xenophon said the changes would end the “lottery” of Senate voting. He said 
his group had come close to achieving the quota for two Senate seats in South 
Australia at the last election, but his running mate fell short because Labor 
gave preferences to Family First.

“If you are required to vote 1-6 above the line, that will give minor parties, 
micro-parties and independents a fighting chance,” Xenophon said.

With the support of the Greens and Xenophon, the government will not require 
backing from the other crossbench senators or Labor to pass the legislation. 
But the move threatens to alienate crossbenchers when it comes to any other 
contentious legislation put to the Senate before the next election.

Is Govt restructuring Senate so they don't have to deal with pesky Crossbench 
pursuits such as long-overdue national anti-corruption agency?

The Palmer United party senator Dio Wang said the changes were about shoring 
up the major parties and the Greens, not about greater transparency. He said 
changes of this magnitude should require bipartisan support.
