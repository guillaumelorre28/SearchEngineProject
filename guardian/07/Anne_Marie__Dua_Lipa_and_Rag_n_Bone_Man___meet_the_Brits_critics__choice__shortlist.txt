Last year, it seemed the spell had broken. The Brits critics choice award was 
given to Jack Garratt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/27/jack-garratt-wins-brits-critics-choice-award-adele-sam-smith>
 and – for once – the award’s winner did not end the year bestriding pop like a 
mightycolossus <http://nfs.sparknotes.com/juliuscaesar/page_18.html>, smiting 
competitors from his path with global smash after global smash. It was a far 
cry fromJames Bay (2015)

 and Adele (2008).

This year, the Brits’ organisers must have hoped the “panel of music industry 
experts and tastemakers” – no Guardian Music staffers in there – would choose 
someone a bit more likely to become the face of British pop over the coming 
year. So who are the three contenders for what the Brits are very keen should 
be referred to as the “specially designed Zaha Hadid award, one of the final 
commissions of her incredible career”?

Anne-Marie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/07/spotlight-on-anne-marie-rudimental-karate>

Age: 25
From: Essex
Her background: She was a West End child actor, appearing in Les Misérables 
when she was six and alongside a young Jessie J in Whistle Down the Wind when 
she was 12. She’s also an international karate champion. Really. Musically, she 
made her mark as a featured singer with the likes of Magnetic Man, Gorgon City, 
Clean Bandit andRudimental 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/03/rudimentals-playlist-tourist-j-hus-anne-marie-and-more>
. This week, she was named the third biggest breakout artist globally on 
Spotify. Though we’re not exactly sure what that means.
Sounds like: A husky-voiced pop-dance featured artist making her way into a 
solo career, via husky-voiced pop-dance. Which is what she is.
Release: There is no album on the schedules, but she is a “priority act” at 
Atlantic Records. Her most recent release was as a featured artist onClean 
Bandit’s Rockabye <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=papuvlVeZg8>, while her 
biggest solo single so far, Alarm, reached No 16 in the UK.
What she says: “I actually can’t believe I am nominated for this amazing award 
[specially designed by Zaha Hadid, one of the final commissions of her 
incredible career]. This is so sick. To everyone who voted for me I am so 
grateful and humbled, here’s to 2017!”

Dua Lipa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/nov/09/the-playlist-new-bands-with-the-prettiots-dua-lipa-and-mind-enterprises>

Age: 21
From: London
Her background: If you only listen to one former model of Kosovar Albanian 
extraction this year, make it Dua Lipa. She’s been on the tip lists for a year 
or so now, and her second single, Be the One, went platinum in Australia, and 
she was on the BBC Sound of 2016 longlist last year, meaning this is her second 
bite at the career-boosting award cherry.
Sounds like: Hugely refined modern pop that is, dare we say, a little lacking 
in character. AsHarriet Gibsone said of her in June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/26/new-order-james-blake-and-more-reviewed-saturdays-music-at-glastonbury-2016>
: “This slick, slightly soulless operation is probably the most polished, 
proficient pop Glastonbury will witness all weekend.”
Release: Her most recent single is as the featured artist on Sean Paul’s No Lie
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Cky5s5E94>. Her debut album, Dua Lipa, will 
be released on Warner Bros on 10 February.
What she says: “I couldn’t believe it when I got the news. So honoured and 
grateful to be nominated for the critics’ choice award [specially designed by 
Zaha Hadid, one of the final commissions of her incredible career]. This is the 
highlight of my year. I’ve said so many times that I’ve hit a lot of milestones 
this year, from performing at Glastonbury, to doing my own European tour, never 
doing the same thing two days in a row and going to places I’ve never been 
before. Truly living my dream, this is the icing on the cake. A huge dream of 
mine! Thank you for all the love and support from the bottom of my heart, this 
means the world to me! Thank you.”

Rag’n’Bone Man

Age: 31
From: Uckfield, East Sussex
His background: Here’s a curious one. The critics’ choice award is meant to be 
for new acts tipped for success, and – with the best will in the world – 
Rag’n’Bone Man is hardly a new artist.Rory Graham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/01/little-punk-jazz-shoegaze-the-new-blues>
 released his first EP in 2012, several years after starting out, and his 
Wolves EP – which featured Vince Staples and Kate Tempest among others – came 
out on Sony more than two years ago (it’s also long enough to count as an 
album).
Sounds like: He’s certainly the most intriguing of the three artists here – a 
big, tattooed fella from a little English village, who, when he opens his 
mouth, sounds like a long-forgotten blues singer. He sings over samples from 
old blues and soul records – the whole thing is like some odd intersection of 
UK hip-hop and the classic soul revival. It’s something both kids and the “real 
music” lot can get behind.
Release: His debut album is released by Sony on 10 February. 
What he says: “It’s bonkers that I’ve been nominated for critics’ choice. 
Absolutely bonkers, I’ve been grafting, I built a strong fanbase over the years 
with help from good people that put their faith in me. And now this! I’m very 
grateful.”
