It’s swarming season. Across southern England the warm weather and abundance 
of flowering plants and trees (food for bees) make the ideal conditions for 
colonies of honeybees to propagate. The queen bee flies out from her hive with 
around half her workers in search of a new home, leaving behind a host of queen 
cells – one of which will emerge as the new queen to begin a new colony in the 
hive.

As more of us are keeping honeybees in towns and cities, this natural process 
witnessed 3,000 years ago by the first beekeepers in ancient Egypt and Greece 
and every spring since, appears to be causing alarm in our high streets.

Earlier this week, it was reported 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/11600059/Middle-class-urban-beekeepers-blamed-for-town-centre-swarms.html>
 that a swarm of bees almost covered a parked car in Marlborough, and on the 
same morning police in Chichester put up a cordon to protect the public from 
bees that had settled on a branch in the middle of the town. In Salisbury, 
railings outside an Italian restaurant were the chosen resting point for a 
swarm, while in Maidstone it was another parked car.

Membership of the British Beekeeping Association (BBKA) more than doubled to 
23,000 between 2009 and 2015 
<http://www.bbka.org.uk/news_and_events/press_office/facts__figures> – many of 
whom are keeping hives in towns and cities. In greater London alone, there are 
an estimated 5,000 beekeepers. The reasons for this explosion in the number of 
urban apiaristsis well-documented 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/07/urban-beekeeping>, from 
Londoners like myself trying to reconnect with nature and enjoying delicious 
locally-made honey, to city allotment holders boosting their crops and urban 
environmentalists attempting to save the bees.

So are we responsible for these town centre swarms? The answer is yes, if 
we’ve not been vigilant for telltale signs that the bees are preparing to swarm.

From the beginning of April – or even earlier during a mild spring – 
beekeepers ought to be looking for clues during weekly inspections of their 
hive and taking steps to manage unwanted swarms by splitting the colony. If 
they’ve learned their craft well – on numerous courses run by beekeeping 
associations and organisations - unwanted swarms would be a rarer occurrence.

The problem lies with novice beekeepers who aren’t cut out for their new 
hobby. You can’t just stick a hive at the bottom of the garden or on the roof 
and collect the honey at the end of the summer. You have to ask yourself, do 
you really have time in your busy schedule to check your bees at the same time 
each week? A day late and they could be off. And could you forgo Easter and May 
half-term holidays?

Even once you’ve learned the basics of good husbandry, novices would do well 
to have a bit of hand-holding from an experienced mentor in the second season 
when the bees will be strong enough to swarm.

That’s not to say that new urban beekeepers are less skilled, or irresponsible 
than their rural counterparts, just that in a built-up area a swarm of bees has 
more chance of coming to the attention of people than in a field, and of 
causing disruption if a high street has to be closed for a hour while the swarm 
collector is called. You can find the swarm collector nearest to you onthe 
BBKA’s website <http://www.bbka.org.uk/help/find_a_swarm_coordinator.php>. 

But we shouldn’t forget that swarms are a magnificent act of nature and a far 
cry from their ‘killer’ depiction in 1970s disaster movies.Bees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bees> stock up on three day’s worth of 
honey (their energy drink or fuel) before leaving the hive on their perilous 
journey to find a new home, so when they alight on a town-centre car or 
railings for a pit stop, they are pretty full-up and soporific. Left alone they 
are harmless.

I wish everyone had the same attitude to urban swarms as Tim Baker, head 
teacher at Charlton Manor junior school 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/gallery/2011/aug/30/beekeeping-in-schools>
 in south London. When a swarm collected on a wall by the entrance to the 
school a few years ago, he was struck by the stark contrast in the reaction of 
staff and pupils. The adults were terrified, while the children were 
fascinated. He took it upon himself there and then to introduce bees into the 
school. “I wanted our pupils to grow up understanding and respecting bees 
rather than fearing them,” he explains.

Perhaps if we’d all had a head teacher like Baker, there wouldn’t be all this 
fuss over swarms of bees. It would just be part of urban living. A small price 
to pay for the pollination of our city allotments, parks and gardens and the 
production of delicious urban honey.
