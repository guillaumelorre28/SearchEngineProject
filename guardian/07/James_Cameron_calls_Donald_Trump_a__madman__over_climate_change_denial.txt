James Cameron has called Donald Trump a “madman” and criticised the Republican 
presidential candidate over his denial of climate change, according to the
Associated Press

.

The Avatar director, speaking ahead of the premiere of his new documentary 
short, Not Reality TV, at the Democratic national convention, said that Trump’s 
assertion that he would tear up theParis climate agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement> and his 
repeated dismissal of the science behind climate change was “incredibly 
reckless and dangerous”.

The film features well-known figures including Jack Black, Don Cheadle and the 
Pope, who is shown describing a planet teetering on the brink of “suicide”. 
Hillary Clinton makes a late cameo, but the starring role is saved for Trump 
himself, who is shown at various rallies ridiculing the idea of climate change. 
“We need some global warming,” he says at one point. “It’s freezing!”

In a statement, Cameron said: “We made this film to show the reality of 
climate change – how it’s directly affecting millions of people each day. As 
I’ve said before, to save our planet we need to mobilise like we did during the 
second world war – the threat to our country and children is that severe.”

“As an American, I am also deeply concerned about my family’s future, about 
our shared future as a nation,” said Weaver in her introduction to the 
documentary. “That future is at risk.”
