Fellow thwarted Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney applauded Jeb 
Bush’s campaign in a note on Facebook after Bush announced that he was 
suspending his campaign for the party’s nomination:
Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) 
.@JebBush <https://twitter.com/JebBush> followed his family's pattern of 
putting country above himself. I am proud to call him a friend.

The full text of Romney’s note:

Today, Jeb Bush followed his family’s pattern of putting country above 
himself. His campaign has been about answers to real problems and about 
policies to strengthen our country. It has been a campaign conducted in the 
finest tradition of dignity and integrity andJeb Bush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush> gave it his all: he can have no 
regrets. I am proud to call him a friend.

What we learned from a big Saturday in South Carolina and Nevada

Scott Bixby

Three time zones apart, the eight presidential candidates from two parties 
vied for the hearts, minds and votes ofSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> and Nevada. And if 
Saturday night’s results were any indication, many Americans are starting to 
really see the 2016 campaign as an opportunity for revolution. (Oh, and then 
there were seven.)

As watch parties and victory parties and “so long and thanks for all the fish 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_dUmDBfp6k>” parties rage from Las Vegas to a 
placeDonald Trump likes called Spartanburg, here are a few quick takeaways from 
the third round of a gauntlet toward the White House:

Bush family values only get you so far

Nearly every Republican presidential candidate applauded the campaign run by 
Jeb Bush, who dropped out after a bitterly disappointing fourth-place finish in 
South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/jeb-bush-suspends-presidential-campaign-south-carolina-primary-donald-trump>
, a state that helped make the Bush dynasty.

 * Ted Cruz called him “a man who ran a campaign based on ideas, based on 
policy, based on substance – a man who didn’t go to the gutter and engage in 
insults and attacks”. (He was pretty much talking about Trump.) 
 * “He’s the greatest governor in the history of Florida, and I believe and I 
pray that his service to our country has not ended,” saidMarco Rubio, Bush’s 
one-time protégé who vanquished the mentor and wasracing for second-place. 
And yet! Despite his principled stand against Trump – Bush was, for a stretch, 
the only candidate willing to take on the New York billionaire – the voters 
wouldn’t, or couldn’t, embrace him. The success of Cruz’s campaign tactics in 
Iowa and, to a point, in South Carolina only underscore the reality thata 
willingness to play hard and even dirty is the most effective weapon in a 
campaign like this.

Clinton has slowed the Bern – for now

A few months ago, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was expecting to take the 
Nevada caucuses in a walk. But she was backed into a corner of flesh-gripping 
and selfie-taking in the waning hours before the horse-trading began.

A loss on Saturday would have represented an existential crisis for Clinton, 
but a single-digit win in a diverse, working-class state likeNevada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nevada> is hardly the victory the former 
secretary of state was hoping for.

South Carolina and the so-called “Super Tuesday” states of the deep south 
promise to be more hospitable ground for Clinton. But it’s going to take the 
kind of footwork that usually stops after the New Hampshire primaries. Verdict:
we shall see 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/20/bernie-sanders-nevada-clinton-momentum-victory>
.

The Republican ‘establishment’ still doesn’t have a candidate

Bush was frequently criticized for selfishly using his Smaug cave’s worth of 
campaign cash to wage a one-man war against Marco Rubio, who many in the 
Republican establishment see as the party’s best chance at winning the White 
House in the general election.

Should Bush drop out, the criticism went, Rubio’s road to the nomination would 
be cleared for mainstream Republican support. But even with Bush gone, Ohio 
governorJohn Kasich <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> remains 
in the race, galvanized by his surprise second-place finish in the New 
Hampshire primaries and ready for a long-haul primary campaign until his home 
state votes on March 15.

Even if every one of Bush’s supporters had voted for Rubio in South Carolina, 
the Florida senator still would have come in second to Trump. Rubio needs every 
“establishment” vote the polity has to offer, and Kasich has no intention of 
giving them up without a fight. Meanwhile, Trump’s delegate count will continue 
to climb...

Donald Trump has cleared a path to the nomination 

Yes, you read that right 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/donald-trump-wins-south-carolina-primary-results-election-2016>
. With the notable exception of the 2012 primary campaign,every candidate who 
has won two of the first three contests has secured the Republican nomination. 

Trump captured a guaranteed 29 delegates from Saturday’s win in South 
Carolina, and the likelihood is that he’ll win the vast majority of the state’s 
remaining 21 district-based delegates, too.

Trump is now on the verge of having more than twice as many delegates as his 
nearest Republican rival. Cruz and Rubio may decry “the pundits” who have 
called the race for Trump, but mathematics don’t lie.

You say you want a revolution?

Two months ago, Clinton’s lead in Nevada appeared nearly insurmountable. Six 
months ago,the notion that the billionaire Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> could actually win two 
primaries would have gotten you locked in a padded room.

And yet! Here we are. Dissatisfaction with the political status quo is no 
longer easily dismissed as the capricious anger of the perennially 
dissatisfied; it’s the motivating force behind the two most ascendent political 
campaigns on the national stage.

(Oh, and Expect Ben Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> to 
drop out after the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday – earlier, if he has to go home 
for a fresh change of clothes.)

That’s it from Columbia, South Carolina. Tune in tomorrow, the next day, and 
every day after that as the Guardian documents the minute-by-minute happenings 
in the most dramatic presidential primary campaign in living memory.

It’s the final countdown...

Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush announced the end of his campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/jeb-bush-suspends-presidential-campaign-south-carolina-primary-donald-trump>
 in South Carolina, following aweaker than expected performance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/20/nevada-south-carolina-live-results-primary-caucuses>
 in the state primary.

An emotional Bush told the gathered audience that he was proud of the campaign 
he has run, but that “the people of Iowa, and New Hampshire, andSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> have spoken, and I really 
respect their decision.”

It was impossibly sad to watch Ted Cruz supporters watch Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> lose the state where he was 
supposed to claim the mantle of lawyers, guns and God – or at least finish 
second – and ended up admitting he remained “in a position to win this race”.

Fox News was blaring at the start (“Cruz’s to lose”) and then blaring a little 
less (“This is domination for Trump”) and then when the news came –“Cruz could 
come in third” – they just cut the audio altogether. Up came the country music, 
full-blast.

A Cruz spokesperson raced to clarify that Fox News had asked the campaign to 
change the audio for when they cut to this room here at the state fairgrounds 
in Columbia.

But here’s what a quiet, third-place “party” looks like when it’s not on TV:


And then they cut to the room on Fox, cued the crowd and – hey, where’s the 
country music now?

Fox was still half-blaring by the time a half-empty room was less half-empty: 
“If he can’t winSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina>, where is he going to win?”


Bob Woodward, a 56-year-old member of the South Carolina Pastor’s Alliance 
here in Richland County, was barking back.

Trump was doing his wall thing, asking his victory crowd who was going to 
build The Wall.Mexico, is what he makes the crowd say. To which Woodward yelled 
at one of the two extra-large screens in a ballroom: “And how you gonna make 
’em do it?”

“I think that Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
is the biggest farce in this election,” said the pastor, sitting down on a 
disappointing night.“He’s just a cheerleader’s cheerleader.”

But there was not much cheering in Columbia. They were messaging that it was a 
“two-man race” for the simple fact that Cruz had actually won a state – and 
that he was from Texas, which comes up big on Super Tuesday in 10 day’s time.

“There’s 50 states in this great nation,” the congressman Jeff Duncan said 
introducing Mister Third Place.

“Fifty-seven!” shouted a woman in the back, citing the Texas secessionist 
movement.

On Fox, Trump was talking about “Making America great again.” At the 
fairgrounds, a woman who had travelled from New Jersey, wearing a red, white 
and blue varsity jacket with the word CRUZ across the back, was talking about 
going home:“I think it’s a sad night for America,” she said.

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, carrying his daughter 
on stage and looking despondent or at least a little tired, told supporters he 
and Marco Rubio had so far “effectively tied for second place”.

“Only one strong conservative is in a position to win this race,” he said at 
the state fairgrounds in Columbia, proclaiming himself as a general-election 
option againstHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> who, as opposed to Rubio, 
had already won a state in the primary campaign.

“We are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. That’s why Donald 
relentlessly attacks us and ignores the other candidates.”

The Texas senator’s campaign ran up against an anti-establishment blockade 
from Trump, broke down in the evangelical north of the state that he was 
supposed to maintain and failed to surge with a message about the Supreme Court 
beyond a stray last-minute poll. Nonetheless, he said his campaign had left 
“the Washington cartel in full terror” of an uprising that he might still lead.

“As president, I will rebuild our military,” Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> says, “stand unequivocally with 
the nation of Israel, and utterly destroy Isis.”

“Together, we will secure the borders and keep America safe,” he continues. 
“And I give you my solemn word that every justice I appoint to the supreme 
court will be a principled constitutionalist who will be faithful and will 
vigilantly protect the rights of our children and grandchildren.”

“When I look at our young daughters,” Cruz says, “I know that I will fight 
with every breath in my body to ensure that they enjoy the same fundamental 
liberties that all of us have been blessed to inherit.”

“We will not go quietly into the night and give up on a brighter America.”

“If you don’t believe that Donald Trump is the best candidate to run against 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in 
November, if you believe we need a strong contrast with the Democrats, then we 
welcome you aboard our team,” Ted Cruz says.

“We welcome you to be part of the over 200,000 volunteers and over 980,000 
contributions - join us at TedCruz.org.”

The crowd begins another “Ted! Ted! Ted!” chant, this one longer and louder 
than the first.

“First Iowa, then New Hampshire, now South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina>. We don’t know the exact 
results right now - right now we are tied for second place. But each time we 
defy expectations, and defy the pundits,” Cruz says, spawning a spontaneous 
outburts of “Ted! Ted! Ted!” chants.

“The screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington cartel 
in full terror that the conservative grassroots found a voice!” Cruz cheers, 
before leading a moment of silence for the late supreme court justice Antonin 
Scalia, who he describes as a “ferocious defender of the constitution and the 
bill of rights.”

“As Ronald Reagan was to the presidency, so, too, was justice Scalia to the

From Jeb Bush’s watch party/wake in South Carolina:

Shell Suber, 49, told the Guardian that his feelings were “hard to put into 
words”.

“You work really hard to convince people he’s the best candidate,” he said. 
“But you have to get enough people to understand and believe it.”

Suber, from Columbia, described this as “an odd year” for Republican politics. 
“There’s so many candidates. And then there’s a celebrity candidate who has 
made it so difficult for the rest of us to get our message out and make our 
case.”

Suber said he did not see what else Bush could have done.

“A lot of people will say he should have attacked Trump sooner but none of 
those people thought he would be a serious candidates back in June or July.”

Fellow thwarted Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney applauded Jeb 
Bush’s campaign in a note on Facebook after Bush announced that he was 
suspending his campaign for the party’s nomination:
Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) 
.@JebBush <https://twitter.com/JebBush> followed his family's pattern of 
putting country above himself. I am proud to call him a friend.

<https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/701229693224230912> 
The full text of Romney’s note:

Today, Jeb Bush followed his family’s pattern of putting country above 
himself. His campaign has been about answers to real problems and about 
policies to strengthen our country. It has been a campaign conducted in the 
finest tradition of dignity and integrity andJeb Bush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush> gave it his all: he can have no 
regrets. I am proud to call him a friend.
 
Three time zones apart, the eight presidential candidates from two parties 
vied for the hearts, minds and votes ofSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> and Nevada. And if 
Saturday night’s results were any indication, many Americans are starting to 
really see the 2016 campaign as an opportunity for revolution. (Oh, and then 
there were seven.)

As watch parties and victory parties and “so long and thanks for all the fish 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_dUmDBfp6k>” parties rage from Las Vegas to a 
placeDonald Trump likes called Spartanburg, here are a few quick takeaways from 
the third round of a gauntlet toward the White House:

Bush family values only get you so far

Nearly every Republican presidential candidate applauded the campaign run by 
Jeb Bush, who dropped out after a bitterly disappointing fourth-place finish in 
South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/jeb-bush-suspends-presidential-campaign-south-carolina-primary-donald-trump>
, a state that helped make the Bush dynasty.

 * Ted Cruz called him “a man who ran a campaign based on ideas, based on 
policy, based on substance – a man who didn’t go to the gutter and engage in 
insults and attacks”. (He was pretty much talking about Trump.) 
 * “He’s the greatest governor in the history of Florida, and I believe and I 
pray that his service to our country has not ended,” saidMarco Rubio, Bush’s 
one-time protégé who vanquished the mentor and wasracing for second-place. 
And yet! Despite his principled stand against Trump – Bush was, for a stretch, 
the only candidate willing to take on the New York billionaire – the voters 
wouldn’t, or couldn’t, embrace him. The success of Cruz’s campaign tactics in 
Iowa and, to a point, in South Carolina only underscore the reality thata 
willingness to play hard and even dirty is the most effective weapon in a 
campaign like this.

Clinton has slowed the Bern – for now

A few months ago, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was expecting to take the 
Nevada caucuses in a walk. But she was backed into a corner of flesh-gripping 
and selfie-taking in the waning hours before the horse-trading began.

A loss on Saturday would have represented an existential crisis for Clinton, 
but a single-digit win in a diverse, working-class state likeNevada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nevada> is hardly the victory the former 
secretary of state was hoping for.

South Carolina and the so-called “Super Tuesday” states of the deep south 
promise to be more hospitable ground for Clinton. But it’s going to take the 
kind of footwork that usually stops after the New Hampshire primaries. Verdict:
we shall see 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/20/bernie-sanders-nevada-clinton-momentum-victory>
.

The Republican ‘establishment’ still doesn’t have a candidate

Bush was frequently criticized for selfishly using his Smaug cave’s worth of 
campaign cash to wage a one-man war against Marco Rubio, who many in the 
Republican establishment see as the party’s best chance at winning the White 
House in the general election.

Should Bush drop out, the criticism went, Rubio’s road to the nomination would 
be cleared for mainstream Republican support. But even with Bush gone, Ohio 
governorJohn Kasich <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> remains 
in the race, galvanized by his surprise second-place finish in the New 
Hampshire primaries and ready for a long-haul primary campaign until his home 
state votes on March 15.

Even if every one of Bush’s supporters had voted for Rubio in South Carolina, 
the Florida senator still would have come in second to Trump. Rubio needs every 
“establishment” vote the polity has to offer, and Kasich has no intention of 
giving them up without a fight. Meanwhile, Trump’s delegate count will continue 
to climb...

Donald Trump has cleared a path to the nomination 

Yes, you read that right 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/donald-trump-wins-south-carolina-primary-results-election-2016>
. With the notable exception of the 2012 primary campaign,every candidate who 
has won two of the first three contests has secured the Republican nomination. 

Trump captured a guaranteed 29 delegates from Saturday’s win in South 
Carolina, and the likelihood is that he’ll win the vast majority of the state’s 
remaining 21 district-based delegates, too.

Trump is now on the verge of having more than twice as many delegates as his 
nearest Republican rival. Cruz and Rubio may decry “the pundits” who have 
called the race for Trump, but mathematics don’t lie.

You say you want a revolution?

Two months ago, Clinton’s lead in Nevada appeared nearly insurmountable. Six 
months ago,the notion that the billionaire Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> could actually win two 
primaries would have gotten you locked in a padded room.

And yet! Here we are. Dissatisfaction with the political status quo is no 
longer easily dismissed as the capricious anger of the perennially 
dissatisfied; it’s the motivating force behind the two most ascendent political 
campaigns on the national stage.

(Oh, and Expect Ben Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> to 
drop out after the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday – earlier, if he has to go home 
for a fresh change of clothes.)

That’s it from Columbia, South Carolina. Tune in tomorrow, the next day, and 
every day after that as the Guardian documents the minute-by-minute happenings 
in the most dramatic presidential primary campaign in living memory.

It’s the final countdown...
 &lt;/figure&gt;  
How many days until Christmas?

Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush announced the end of his campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/jeb-bush-suspends-presidential-campaign-south-carolina-primary-donald-trump>
 in South Carolina, following aweaker than expected performance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/20/nevada-south-carolina-live-results-primary-caucuses>
 in the state primary.

An emotional Bush told the gathered audience that he was proud of the campaign 
he has run, but that “the people of Iowa, and New Hampshire, andSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> have spoken, and I really 
respect their decision.”
 
It was impossibly sad to watch Ted Cruz supporters watch Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> lose the state where he was 
supposed to claim the mantle of lawyers, guns and God – or at least finish 
second – and ended up admitting he remained “in a position to win this race”.

Fox News was blaring at the start (“Cruz’s to lose”) and then blaring a little 
less (“This is domination for Trump”) and then when the news came –“Cruz could 
come in third” – they just cut the audio altogether. Up came the country music, 
full-blast.

A Cruz spokesperson raced to clarify that Fox News had asked the campaign to 
change the audio for when they cut to this room here at the state fairgrounds 
in Columbia.

But here’s what a quiet, third-place “party” looks like when it’s not on TV:


And then they cut to the room on Fox, cued the crowd and – hey, where’s the 
country music now?

Fox was still half-blaring by the time a half-empty room was less half-empty: 
“If he can’t winSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina>, where is he going to win?”


Bob Woodward, a 56-year-old member of the South Carolina Pastor’s Alliance 
here in Richland County, was barking back.

Trump was doing his wall thing, asking his victory crowd who was going to 
build The Wall.Mexico, is what he makes the crowd say. To which Woodward yelled 
at one of the two extra-large screens in a ballroom: “And how you gonna make 
’em do it?”

“I think that Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
is the biggest farce in this election,” said the pastor, sitting down on a 
disappointing night.“He’s just a cheerleader’s cheerleader.”

But there was not much cheering in Columbia. They were messaging that it was a 
“two-man race” for the simple fact that Cruz had actually won a state – and 
that he was from Texas, which comes up big on Super Tuesday in 10 day’s time.

“There’s 50 states in this great nation,” the congressman Jeff Duncan said 
introducing Mister Third Place.

“Fifty-seven!” shouted a woman in the back, citing the Texas secessionist 
movement.

On Fox, Trump was talking about “Making America great again.” At the 
fairgrounds, a woman who had travelled from New Jersey, wearing a red, white 
and blue varsity jacket with the word CRUZ across the back, was talking about 
going home:“I think it’s a sad night for America,” she said.
 
Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, carrying his daughter 
on stage and looking despondent or at least a little tired, told supporters he 
and Marco Rubio had so far “effectively tied for second place”.

“Only one strong conservative is in a position to win this race,” he said at 
the state fairgrounds in Columbia, proclaiming himself as a general-election 
option againstHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> who, as opposed to Rubio, 
had already won a state in the primary campaign.

“We are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. That’s why Donald 
relentlessly attacks us and ignores the other candidates.”

The Texas senator’s campaign ran up against an anti-establishment blockade 
from Trump, broke down in the evangelical north of the state that he was 
supposed to maintain and failed to surge with a message about the Supreme Court 
beyond a stray last-minute poll. Nonetheless, he said his campaign had left 
“the Washington cartel in full terror” of an uprising that he might still lead.

 
“As president, I will rebuild our military,” Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> says, “stand unequivocally with 
the nation of Israel, and utterly destroy Isis.”

“Together, we will secure the borders and keep America safe,” he continues. 
“And I give you my solemn word that every justice I appoint to the supreme 
court will be a principled constitutionalist who will be faithful and will 
vigilantly protect the rights of our children and grandchildren.”

“When I look at our young daughters,” Cruz says, “I know that I will fight 
with every breath in my body to ensure that they enjoy the same fundamental 
liberties that all of us have been blessed to inherit.”

“We will not go quietly into the night and give up on a brighter America.”
 
“If you don’t believe that Donald Trump is the best candidate to run against 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in 
November, if you believe we need a strong contrast with the Democrats, then we 
welcome you aboard our team,” Ted Cruz says.

“We welcome you to be part of the over 200,000 volunteers and over 980,000 
contributions - join us at TedCruz.org.”

The crowd begins another “Ted! Ted! Ted!” chant, this one longer and louder 
than the first.
 
South Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> has given 
us another remarkable result!

– Senator Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, on his 
possible third-place finish.
 
“This election will be a referendum on the supreme court - and let me tell 
you, I cannot wait to stand on that debate stage withHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, or Bernie Sanders, or 
whatever other socialist they nominate and make the case against their radical 
interpretation of the constitution!” Cruz says.

The line falls, oddly, flat.
 
“First Iowa, then New Hampshire, now South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina>. We don’t know the exact 
results right now - right now we are tied for second place. But each time we 
defy expectations, and defy the pundits,” Cruz says, spawning a spontaneous 
outburts of “Ted! Ted! Ted!” chants.

“The screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington cartel 
in full terror that the conservative grassroots found a voice!” Cruz cheers, 
before leading a moment of silence for the late supreme court justice Antonin 
Scalia, who he describes as a “ferocious defender of the constitution and the 
bill of rights.”

“As Ronald Reagan was to the presidency, so, too, was justice Scalia to the 
supreme court,” Cruz says, reiterating a common line from his stump speech.
 
Ted Cruz lauds newly minted dropout Jeb Bush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush>, to polite applause from the 
assembled, as “a man who ran a campaign based on ideas, based on policy, based 
on substance, a man who didn’t go to the gutter and engage in insults and 
attacks.”

“Governor Bush brought honor and dignity to this campaign.”
 
The second-to-last presidential candidate to speak following the South 
Carolina Republican primaries, Texas senator Ted Cruz began his speech at the 
Cruz campaign’s watch party in Columbia with to the strains ofWhere The Stars 
And Stripes And Eagle Fly <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzV32-KBxyU> and 
huge applause from his supporters.

“You continue to defy the pundits and to produce extraordinary results,” Cruz 
began.
 
From Jeb Bush’s watch party/wake in South Carolina:

Shell Suber, 49, told the Guardian that his feelings were “hard to put into 
words”.

“You work really hard to convince people he’s the best candidate,” he said. 
“But you have to get enough people to understand and believe it.”

Suber, from Columbia, described this as “an odd year” for Republican politics. 
“There’s so many candidates. And then there’s a celebrity candidate who has 
made it so difficult for the rest of us to get our message out and make our 
case.”

Suber said he did not see what else Bush could have done.

“A lot of people will say he should have attacked Trump sooner but none of 
those people thought he would be a serious candidates back in June or July.”
