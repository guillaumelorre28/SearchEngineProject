Donors and governments must continue to fund the fight against malaria in 
Nigeria, where, despite impressive progress in reducing the number of deaths,
about 100,000 people <http://www.who.int/countries/nga/en/> still die from the 
disease every year, says the head of theMalaria Consortium 
<http://www.malariaconsortium.org/>’s Nigeria office.

Dr Kolawole Maxwell said the battle against the mosquito-borne disease had 
also helped strengthen the public health system in one of the countries worst 
hit by malaria, but a potential fall in funding constitutes a serious risk, 
particularly aslower oil prices hit government revenues

.

“We are looking inwards to see what we can do to ensure that we continue to 
get the attention of governments and donors to keep the funding going,” said 
Maxwell, who was in London forWorld Malaria Day 
<http://www.who.int/campaigns/malaria-day/2016/en/>.

“Nigeria is basically an economy that is based on oil. More than before, we 
are now being forced to start looking inwards and looking at what can we 
integrate and making sure we have efficiencies,” he said, noting that donor 
funds are still needed to switch from controlling outbreaks to elimination 
programmes.

On Monday, the World Health Organisation <http://www.who.int/en/> released a 
report on malaria 
<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/who-htm-gmp-2016.3_eng.pdf> 
(pdf), Eliminating Malaria, calling for a global commitment toremove malaria 
from at least 35 new countries 
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/wha-20-may-2015/en/> by 2030 
– a goal it described as “ambitious but achievable”.

Last year, for the first time, Europe had no indigenous cases of malaria, down 
from 90,000 cases in 1995. Eight other countries reported zero cases in 2014: 
Argentina, Costa Rica, Iraq, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Sri Lanka and the United 
Arab Emirates.

“Our report shines a spotlight on countries that are well on their way to 
eliminating malaria,” said Dr Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO global malaria 
programme.

“WHO commends these countries while also highlighting the urgent need for 
greater investment in settings with high rates of malaria transmission, 
particularly inAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>. Saving lives 
must be our first priority.”


The WHO said a 60% global decline in deaths came through insecticide-treated 
bednets, indoor residual spraying, rapid diagnostic testing and 
artemisinin-based combination therapies. But it noted thatmosquito resistance 
to insecticides 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/25/insecticide-resistant-mosquitoes-biting-back-malaria-death-rates>
 used in nets and spraying is growing, as is parasite resistance to a component 
in a powerful antimalarial medicine.

Last year, 214 million cases 
<http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/> of malaria were reported in 
95 countries, and more than 400,000 people died of malaria. Nigeria and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo still accountfor 35% of deaths 
<http://www.worldmalariaday.org/about/key-facts>.

“New technologies must go hand in hand with strong political and financial 
commitment,” Alonso said. Funding needs to increase from $2.5bn (£1.73bn) today 
to an estimated $8.7bn (£6bn) each year by 2030, according to the WHO.


Maxwell said Nigeria had made impressive progress under an eight-year, UK 
aid-fundedsupport to national malaria programme 
<http://www.malariaconsortium.org/sunmap/news/eight-year-programme-contributes-to-significant-malaria-decrease-in-nigeria>
. Integrating this programme into existing health systems had been critical.

“When we started, around 60% of people who came to the outpatients department 
of any hospital were complaining of fever …Malaria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/malaria> places a huge burden on the 
health systems. It would have been so easy when we started to say, ‘OK, since 
this is huge, and there are resources, let’s just work on malaria.’

“We could have set off doing practical systems and activities, which might 
have brought down malaria but at the end of the day might have destroyed the 
heath system,” he said.

Instead, the team looked at the capacity of the health system and the people 
involved, and decided accordingly which tools and systems were needed, and how 
to integrate the campaign with the broader health system, including through 
data reporting and drug supply.

The effects of strengthening the health system were evident in the way Nigeria 
reacted quickly to the Ebola 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/nigeria-ebola-crackdown-example-to-world>
 threat, Maxwell said, and work against other diseases includingpolio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/24/nigeria-one-year-without-polio-eradication-africa>
 andLassa fever 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/lassa-fever-has-killed-more-than-100-in-nigeria-latest-figures-show>
 has also benefited.

Maxwell said it was important to engage communities, because although 
incidence of malaria was declining, individual cases tended to be more acute as
herd immunity <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/> was 
falling.

“We don’t want a situation where the community thinks it is not malaria that 
is killing people but something else,” he said.

The private sector also needed to define its role in the battle, he said. 

“I’m talking about people making profits from health products, like nets and 
drugs. We can now engage with a population that is middle class, that have some 
resources, and [the private sector] can start asking them what would be their 
preferences in some of these commodities, and increase and expand the market.”
