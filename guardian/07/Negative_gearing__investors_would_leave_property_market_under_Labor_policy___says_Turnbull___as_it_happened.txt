Nighty night

Big day. That’s enough for now. Thank you muchly for your company on what has 
been a mildly crazy day.

Let’s wrap Wednesday. There were two main issues.

 * Today, the government’s tax woes got worse rather than better. The prime 
minister and the assistant treasurer had competing versions about what Labor’s 
negative gearing policy would mean for home owners, and their efforts to marry 
their contradictory statements looked less than convincing.Malcolm Turnbull 
also stumbled in the House by declaring Labor’sTony Burke owned investment 
properties when he didn’t.

 * Labor’s divisions over Senate voting reform were on public display. The 
shadow special minister of state,Gary Gray, stood up in parliament and argued 
the opposition’s position on the issue stank, but because he was a good soldier 
he would support it. The government clapped its hands happily. But late in the 
day, the government had to amend its own package to deal with some technical 
problems. Small car crash, only minor cuts and abrasions.

Have a great evening. See you in the morning.

Sorry for the brief break in transmission – someone I needed to see. While 
I’ve been off air it’s become clear the government has fumbled the Senate 
voting reform bill. The government has this evening had to producea page of 
amendments 
<http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/amend/r5626_amend_07911711-e5f3-4076-a060-a98d0b5af50f/upload_pdf/JP106.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf>
 addressing a couple of technical things, such as ensuring there is counting on 
election night of Senate votes. This was an issue that the ABC’s election 
analyst,Antony Green, identified as a problem with the package a couple of days 
ago.

The innovation minister, Christopher Pyne, has just done his regular radio 
spot on 2GB with the opposition spokesman on infrastructure,Anthony Albanese. 
Pyne has reported he’s observing FebFast but assures “he’s through the cranky 
stage. The first week was hell.” Albanese then lined up a birthday drink for 
next week. “It’s my birthday!”

After the pleasantries, it was straight to WWE. A couple of throw-downs about 
Gary Gray telling parliament today that he thought Labor’s position on Senate 
voting reform stank but he was going to observe it anyway. Then to negative 
gearing and CGT.

Pyne says once house prices go down courtesy of Labor’s policy on negative 
gearing the banks will move in to claim the houses of people when what they owe 
on their mortgage exceeds the value of the asset. Not content with that, he 
observes that Labor hasswallowed a pig.

Anthony Albanese:

Who knows what that analogy means?

Pyne says pigs are notoriously indigestible. That’s what it means. Albanese 
says the government has nothing to say on housing affordability. Pyne says 
neither does Labor. Albanese ended by advising him tostick to the pig analogies.

The day hasn’t allowed me much slack to get into the various feelpinions of 
conservatives about the safe schools program (the one the government is 
reviewing because said conservatives believe it amounts to rainbow ideology).

The LNP senator Barry O’Sullivan told his chamber before question time that 
material associated with the program had kids perusing options about their 
gender and sexuality like they were reading a Chinese menu.

Then they go on to provide some 13 options, none of them as an option are 
heterosexuality ... Here we have a program with young people in this very 
vulnerable state, being educated that here are your options. You can go and 
shop down like a Chinese menu – you can pick any one of the following that you 
like, it’s OK. It’s all perfectly normal.

(I’m indebted to my colleague Shalailah Medhora for these quotes.)

On over-egging and repositioning

A few ideas to throw into the mix this afternoon.

The government’s resort to the scare campaign on negative gearing and capital 
gains tax is, at one level, politics 101. It’s conventional wisdom. If your 
opponent offers you an easy target, you go for the bullseye. And as bad as 
things look for the government this week, we need to remember Labor’s policy 
carries distinct political risks. This is a tough sell to the investor class of 
Australia. The government has made a calculation to go with politics 101, and 
Turnbull today was escalating, not retreating.

But when you go politics 101, you really do need to have your lines straight. 
Right now, Turnbull andKelly O’Dwyer are both sticking by their respective 
assessments that Labor’s policy will force housing values both up and down. 
Turnbull says down, everywhere. Housing-ageddon. O’Dwyer says prices down for 
existing homes and up for new property.

We really do need one story here, and preferably backed by evidence of some 
kind, because the escalation in the language is bordering on pantomime.

And today’s great inspiration to start name checking parliamentarians in 
possession of investment properties as if they’ve got some ulterior motive – 
what on earth was that about? Just think about that one for five seconds. If 
Labor is moving to close access to a tax concession for a certain class of 
property, that suggests it is prepared to limit its options for future tax 
effective investing. Isn’t the government the one arguing that the tax 
concession should remain in place, not the opposition? Don’t you, by random act 
of name checking, then invite some gratuitous analysis of your own motives?

Apart from the clutter and the overstatement and the own goals, the government 
has another problem. Right now Labor is setting the terms of the debate. We are 
talking about Labor’s policy as if Labor was odds-on favourite to win the next 
election. By banging on about your opponent’s agenda day in and day out, you 
elevate their status.

All this week Turnbull has been acting like an opposition leader, not a prime 
minister. The fear campaign is last legs stuff: circling the wagons, saving the 
furniture. The government should be setting the policy agenda. Instead it’s 
responding constantly on the terms of its opponents, and in so doing, 
highlighting the fact its own tax policy is a complete vacuum.

And going for broke creates a couple of practical complications down the track 
for Turnbull. The government is making it ever more difficult to do something – 
anything really – on negative gearing and capital gains tax itself.

Both of these things should be looked at if the prime minister meant what he 
said about having a genuine policy debate. Every day, it’s limiting its own 
agency.

The other risk associated with the Great Big Scare is if it doesn’t bite, if 
your match doesn’t hit dry tinder out there in voter land, then how on earth do 
you reposition? What does the prime minister say by why of explanation?

Oh, yes, all that stuff I said about Labor’s policy, that was all just huff 
and blow. I didn’t mean any of it. Don’t take any notice of me, I’m just the 
prime minister.

Big day. That’s enough for now. Thank you muchly for your company on what has 
been a mildly crazy day.

Let’s wrap Wednesday. There were two main issues.

 * Today, the government’s tax woes got worse rather than better. The prime 
minister and the assistant treasurer had competing versions about what Labor’s 
negative gearing policy would mean for home owners, and their efforts to marry 
their contradictory statements looked less than convincing.Malcolm Turnbull 
also stumbled in the House by declaring Labor’sTony Burke owned investment 
properties when he didn’t.

 * Labor’s divisions over Senate voting reform were on public display. The 
shadow special minister of state,Gary Gray, stood up in parliament and argued 
the opposition’s position on the issue stank, but because he was a good soldier 
he would support it. The government clapped its hands happily. But late in the 
day, the government had to amend its own package to deal with some technical 
problems. Small car crash, only minor cuts and abrasions.

Have a great evening. See you in the morning.
 
Sorry for the brief break in transmission – someone I needed to see. While 
I’ve been off air it’s become clear the government has fumbled the Senate 
voting reform bill. The government has this evening had to producea page of 
amendments 
<http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/amend/r5626_amend_07911711-e5f3-4076-a060-a98d0b5af50f/upload_pdf/JP106.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf>
 addressing a couple of technical things, such as ensuring there is counting on 
election night of Senate votes. This was an issue that the ABC’s election 
analyst,Antony Green, identified as a problem with the package a couple of days 
ago.
 
Bless Matthew Davey.

The manager of government business, Christopher Pyne, cannot believe the 
hypocrisy of theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>. You are going to 
oppose this bill, Pyne says. You’ve made up your mind. Let’s get on with it.
 
In the House, the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, is going postal 
about the government’s efforts to push its Senate voting reform package through 
the House of Representatives.
 
The innovation minister, Christopher Pyne, has just done his regular radio 
spot on 2GB with the opposition spokesman on infrastructure,Anthony Albanese. 
Pyne has reported he’s observing FebFast but assures “he’s through the cranky 
stage. The first week was hell.” Albanese then lined up a birthday drink for 
next week. “It’s my birthday!”

After the pleasantries, it was straight to WWE. A couple of throw-downs about 
Gary Gray telling parliament today that he thought Labor’s position on Senate 
voting reform stank but he was going to observe it anyway. Then to negative 
gearing and CGT.

Pyne says once house prices go down courtesy of Labor’s policy on negative 
gearing the banks will move in to claim the houses of people when what they owe 
on their mortgage exceeds the value of the asset. Not content with that, he 
observes that Labor hasswallowed a pig.

Anthony Albanese:

Who knows what that analogy means?

Pyne says pigs are notoriously indigestible. That’s what it means. Albanese 
says the government has nothing to say on housing affordability. Pyne says 
neither does Labor. Albanese ended by advising him tostick to the pig analogies.

By the way, Donald Trump has just won the caucus in Nevada.
 
The day hasn’t allowed me much slack to get into the various feelpinions of 
conservatives about the safe schools program (the one the government is 
reviewing because said conservatives believe it amounts to rainbow ideology).

The LNP senator Barry O’Sullivan told his chamber before question time that 
material associated with the program had kids perusing options about their 
gender and sexuality like they were reading a Chinese menu.

Then they go on to provide some 13 options, none of them as an option are 
heterosexuality ... Here we have a program with young people in this very 
vulnerable state, being educated that here are your options. You can go and 
shop down like a Chinese menu – you can pick any one of the following that you 
like, it’s OK. It’s all perfectly normal.

A few ideas to throw into the mix this afternoon.

The government’s resort to the scare campaign on negative gearing and capital 
gains tax is, at one level, politics 101. It’s conventional wisdom. If your 
opponent offers you an easy target, you go for the bullseye. And as bad as 
things look for the government this week, we need to remember Labor’s policy 
carries distinct political risks. This is a tough sell to the investor class of 
Australia. The government has made a calculation to go with politics 101, and 
Turnbull today was escalating, not retreating.

But when you go politics 101, you really do need to have your lines straight. 
Right now, Turnbull andKelly O’Dwyer are both sticking by their respective 
assessments that Labor’s policy will force housing values both up and down. 
Turnbull says down, everywhere. Housing-ageddon. O’Dwyer says prices down for 
existing homes and up for new property.

We really do need one story here, and preferably backed by evidence of some 
kind, because the escalation in the language is bordering on pantomime.

And today’s great inspiration to start name checking parliamentarians in 
possession of investment properties as if they’ve got some ulterior motive – 
what on earth was that about? Just think about that one for five seconds. If 
Labor is moving to close access to a tax concession for a certain class of 
property, that suggests it is prepared to limit its options for future tax 
effective investing. Isn’t the government the one arguing that the tax 
concession should remain in place, not the opposition? Don’t you, by random act 
of name checking, then invite some gratuitous analysis of your own motives?

Apart from the clutter and the overstatement and the own goals, the government 
has another problem. Right now Labor is setting the terms of the debate. We are 
talking about Labor’s policy as if Labor was odds-on favourite to win the next 
election. By banging on about your opponent’s agenda day in and day out, you 
elevate their status.

All this week Turnbull has been acting like an opposition leader, not a prime 
minister. The fear campaign is last legs stuff: circling the wagons, saving the 
furniture. The government should be setting the policy agenda. Instead it’s 
responding constantly on the terms of its opponents, and in so doing, 
highlighting the fact its own tax policy is a complete vacuum.

And going for broke creates a couple of practical complications down the track 
for Turnbull. The government is making it ever more difficult to do something – 
anything really – on negative gearing and capital gains tax itself.

Both of these things should be looked at if the prime minister meant what he 
said about having a genuine policy debate. Every day, it’s limiting its own 
agency.

The other risk associated with the Great Big Scare is if it doesn’t bite, if 
your match doesn’t hit dry tinder out there in voter land, then how on earth do 
you reposition? What does the prime minister say by why of explanation?

Oh, yes, all that stuff I said about Labor’s policy, that was all just huff 
and blow. I didn’t mean any of it. Don’t take any notice of me, I’m just the 
prime minister.
