Press secretary Josh Earnest indicated that he shared the view of US 
intelligence officials,reported by NBC News, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/vladimir-putin-personally-involved-in-us-hack-report-claims>
 that Putin hada direct role 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/vladimir-putin-personally-involved-in-us-hack-report-claims>
 in hacking during the presidential election.

He also argued that Trump knew Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> was engaged in malicious 
cyber-attacks that boosted him and damaged his rival, Hillary Clinton.

But asked directly if the White House believes that Russia successfully rigged 
the US presidential election,Earnest told reporters 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-316>
 “there are a variety of potential explanations” for Trump’s surprise win. It 
was a question for political analysts, he said, not intelligence analysts.

Although there is no evidence that Russians hacked voting machines on election 
day, intelligence officials have claimed Russians were behind the raid on 
Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta’s emails, which were published by 
WikiLeaks and featured regularly in media coverage of the race.

Earnest pointed White House reporters to a unanimous statement 
<https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement>
 from all 17 intelligence agencies, issued in October, that found “only 
Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities”.

The press secretary said that in his personal view, that sentence was “not 
intended to be subtle”, adding that it was “pretty obvious that they were 
referring to the senior-most government official in Russia”.

Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser for strategic 
communications, agreed in an interview on MSNBC.

“I don’t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence 
without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,” he said.

The Kremlin rejected the claim of Putin’s involvement, spokesman Dmitry Peskov 
dismissing it as “amusing rubbish that has no basis in fact”, in a conference 
call with reporters.

Despite outward cordiality between Obama and Trump, the issue is straining 
relations between their teams.Trump himself weighed in on Thursday, using 
Twitter to ask: <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/809403760099422208> 
“If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so 
long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?”

Earnest, who normally swerves past Trump’s tweets, noted that the intelligence 
community had in fact issued its statement on 7 October, a month before polling 
day.

“It was obvious to everyone who was paying attention,” he said, “including the 
gentleman whose thumbs authored that tweet, that the impact of that malicious 
activity benefited the Trump campaign and hurt the Clinton campaign.

“That is, after all, why the president-elect called on Russia to hack 
Secretary Clinton’s email.

“That is presumably why the coverage of the hack-and-leak operation that 
Russia carried out was focused on emails from the Democratic party and Clinton 
campaign staffers and not the Republican party and Trump campaign staffers.”


He added: “That is why, in the day leading up to election day, the Republican 
nominee himself was encouraging people to check out WikiLeaks. He thought it 
would help his campaign.

“And he knew that when people went to WikiLeaks, they weren’t going to find 
damaging information about [his allies] Steve Bannon or Reince Priebus or the 
RNC [Republican National Committee].”

Donald Trump to Russia: hack and publish Hillary Clinton's 'missing' emails

At his last press conference, in July, Trump effectively asked a foreign power 
to carry out cyber-espionage,entreating Russia to find Clinton’s 30,000 
“missing” emails 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack>
, from the private server she used while secretary of state.

His aides have since claimed he was joking, but Earnest said pointedly on 
Thursday: “I don’t think anybody at the White House thinks it’s funny that an 
adversary of the United States engaged in malicious cyber activity to 
destabilise our democracy.

“That’s not a joke.”

Later on Thursday, Trump launched a brazen attack on Earnest at a 
post-election rally <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_L2H9_IInE> in Hershey, 
Pennsylvania, branding him “foolish” and speculating, without evidence, that he 
might be “taking orders from someone else”.

At the rally, Trump moved to stop the boisterous crowd booing when he 
mentioned Obama’s name, waving his hand and saying, “No, no, no!”


But then, seemingly as a fresh thought occurred to him, he digressed: 
“Although this foolish guy, Josh Earnest, I don’t know if he’s talking to 
President Obama. You know, having the right press secretary’s so important 
because he is so bad, the way he delivers a message.

“He can deliver a positive message and it sounds bad. He could say, ‘Ladies 
and gentlemen, today we have totally defeated Isis,’ and it wouldn’t sound 
good, OK, all right? I have a feeling they won’t be saying it but we will be 
saying it.”

The crowd cheered. The Republican nominee added: “The president’s very 
positive but he’s not positive and I mean, maybe he’s getting his orders from 
somebody else. Does that make sense? Could that be possible?”

Although Obama and Trump have been studiously polite about each other, their 
lieutenants seem to be taking the gloves off. Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, who 
is said to have turned down the job of press secretary, described Earnest’s 
criticism as “breathtaking”.She told Fox News: 
<http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/310521-conway-takes-shot-at-earnest-i-guess-hes-auditioning-to-be-a-political>
 “I guess he’s auditioning to be a political pundit after his job is over soon. 
That is incredibly disappointing to hear from the podium of the White House 
press secretary.”

But David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Obama, said it was “highly 
unlikely” Earnest was acting without the president’s approval. “A press 
secretary doesn’t go out and make statements like that on an unauthorised 
basis,” he told CNN.
