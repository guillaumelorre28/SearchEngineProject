deal in which she took a cut of the $653.4m box office ofThe Hunger Games:

rise in her income. McCarthy, who was the third highest-paid female actor last

 in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Aniston, a regular in the Top 5, has seen her earnings 
increase by 27.3% in the last year.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/05/sandra-bullock-forbes-list-gravity-highest-paid-women>
, is a notable absentee this time around, as is Angelina Jolie, who wasthe 
highest-paid female actor of 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/30/angelina-jolie-forbes-list-highest-earning>
.

The list, based on information from Nielsen, Box Office Mojo and IMDb, and 
interviews with entertainment agents, managers and lawyers, has a minimum 
cutoff of $10m, meaning Kristen Wiig, Renée Zellweger and Cate Blanchett all 
narrowly missed earning a place.

Lawrence’s 2015 income is just over half that of her male counterpart, Robert 
Downey Jr. The Forbes list has traditionally reignited the debate about the 
gender pay gap in Hollywood, with Lawrence expressing anger at the disparity 
between male and female stars’ payin an essay last October

. Forbes’s highest-paid actor list for 2016 is expected to be published soon.
