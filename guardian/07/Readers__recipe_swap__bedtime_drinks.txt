It's fair to say I've never been as ruined by a tasting as this one: with the 
twin soothers of spice and booze coming up in many of your fragrant offerings, 
by midday, nothing could part me from my duvet. Dairy, too, was a frequent 
ingredient – and quite right too, as few drinks really are more soothing than a 
cup of warm milk – though I particularly enjoyed the twist veggischmooze put on 
it by using almond milk instead.

But in the end it was a dairy-free, booze-free one that was my winner: a 
simple mulled apple juice that, with the addition of a few camomile flowers, is 
just what I want for a more gentle slip-slide into the land of nod.

The winning recipe: Mulled apple juice with camomile

Mulled apple juice is basically all the spices of mulled wine added to apple 
juice instead. It keeps nicely in the fridge and then at bedtime you simply 
stick it in the microwave.

Serves 1
300ml fresh apple juice
1 bay leaf
2 cloves
Half a cinnamon stick/good pinch of ground
A good slice of fresh ginger
1 tsp freshly grated/a few pinches of ground nutmeg (to taste)
1 tsp camomile flowers/1 camomile teabag

1 Warm the apple juice over a low heat with the herbs and spices and a 
scraping of nutmeg for a few minutes until the ingredients infuse.

2 Drop in the camomile flowers (or a camomile teabag) and keep at a steeping 
temperature – no bubbles, just gentle steaming.

3 After 3-4 minutes, strain the liquid into a cup.

Mexican hot chocolate
 Spicy and nice: thejameskitchen's Mexican dark hot chocolate drink.

Try this steaming, orangey hot chocolate with a dollop of lightly whipped 
cream and some grated Mexican chocolate (Mayordomo or Ibarra for example). Or 
if you have none of these handy, just mix dark chocolate withpiloncillo 
(unrefined cane sugar) or dark brown sugar and cinnamon. For a bit of spice, 
you can even add chilli. And then stir it all up with a cinnamon stick.

 To serve (optional) 
Fresh cream, lightly whipped

Negus
 Rachel Kelly's "negus" – much-maligned by Byron. Photograph: 
MarmadukeScarlet/GuardianWitness 
Lord Byron described negus as "a wishy-washy compromise between wine and 
water". Probably he had a closer relationship with booze than I do, butclearly 
he didn't know what he was talking about. Nourishing, warming and wholesome, 
negus was just the thing to settle down for the night before the invention of 
central heating, with its lemon or Seville orange and spices, with port, sherry 
or brandy.
I am baffled by Mrs Beeton's recipe –it's a lot boozier than mine, and she 
suggests it would be suitable for a children's party!

About 2 tsp sugar, to taste
A shot of brandy (optional)
A few scrapings of nutmeg, for the top

1 Gently warm the port in a saucepan. Add the orange or lemon slices, together 
with the boiling water, sugar (to taste) and the brandy, if using.

2 Ensure the liquid is warmed through. Serve topped with grated nutmeg.

English chai

I should probably say straight up that I hate tea and always have done. But 
aged about 15, I was working in a local newsagents on a Saturday morning when 
the old Irish couple that ran it retired and sold out to a fantastic Gujarati 
family. They introduced me to chai – Indian spiced tea. At the time I thought 
it was horrid sweet stuff, with a funny taste and smell. But I came to love it 
and appreciate the subtle spicing – and years later it's still my bedtime drink 
of choice.

300ml milk

Warm, creamy caramel milk may be served as it is, or you can fortify it with 
some whiskey, brandy or even a splash of rum for a dreamy bedtime drink.
