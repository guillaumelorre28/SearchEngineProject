Nigel Slater’s carrot cake with a frosting of mascarpone and orange 

You could measure my life in health-food shops. It is to them I turn for the 
bulk of my store-cupboard shopping, from parchment-coloured figs and organic 
almonds to sea salt and cubes of fresh yeast. Their shelves are a constant 
source of inspiration and reassurance. It is also where I first came across 
organic vegetables, long before the supermarkets saw them as a money-spinner or 
the organic box schemes would turn up at your door. It was these pine-clad 
shops, with their lingering scent of patchouli, that introduced me to the joys 
of the organic swede.

To this day I wouldn’t go anywhere else for my lentils and beans, though I can 
live without the crystals and self-help manuals. These is something endlessly 
reassuring about their rows of cellophane-encased dates and haricot beans, 
their dried nuggets of cranberry and jars of organic peanut butter. And where 
else can you get a joss stick when you need one?

Health-food shops rarely used to be without a carrot cake on the salad 
counter, usually next to the blackcurrant cheesecake and the deep wholemeal 
quiche. Good they were, too, with thick cream-cheese icing and shot through 
with walnuts. I never scorned them the way others did, finding much pleasure in 
the deep, soggy layers of cake and frosting. This was first published in the
Observer many years ago, and rarely does a week go by without an email asking 
for a copy to replace one that has fallen apart or stuck to the bottom of a 
pan. Few things make a cook happier than someone asking for one of your recipes.

Enough for 8-10
eggs 3
self-raising flour 250g
bicarbonate of soda ½ tsp
baking powder 1 tsp
ground cinnamon 1 tsp
salt a pinch
sunflower oil 200ml
light muscovado sugar 250g
carrots 150g
lemon juice of ½
walnuts 150g

For the frosting
mascarpone cheese 250g
Philadelphia cream cheese 200g
unrefined icing sugar 150g
orange grated zest of 1 medium
walnut halves a handful

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Lightly butter two 22cm cake tins, then line 
each with a disc of baking parchment.

Separate the eggs. Sift together the flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking 
powder, cinnamon and salt. Beat the oil and sugar in a food mixer until well 
creamed, then introduce the egg yolks one by one. Grate the carrots into the 
mixture, then add the lemon juice. Roughly chop the walnuts and add them too.

Fold the flour into the mixture with the machine on slow. Beat the egg whites 
till light and stiff, then fold tenderly into the mixture using a large metal 
spoon (a wooden one will knock the air out).

Divide the mixture between the two cake tins, smooth the top gently and bake 
for 40-45 minutes. Test with a skewer for doneness. The cakes should be moist 
but not sticky.

Remove from the oven and leave to settle for a good 10 minutes before turning 
the cakes out of their tins on to a wire cooling rack.

To make the frosting, put the mascarpone, Philadelphia cheese and icing sugar 
into an electric mixer and beat till smooth and creamy. It should have no 
lumps. Mix in the orange zest.

When the cake is cool, sandwich the halves together with about a third of the 
frosting. Use the rest to cover the top and sides of the cake. I don’t think 
you need be too painstaking; a rough finish will look more appropriate here. 
Cover the top with walnut halves.

Emma Clark’s Glenegedale House banana bread

I have made this banana bread at least twice a week for three and half years 
for the guests in our guesthouse. The scent fills the house and wakes up the 
senses before you are even properly awake. This recipe was my grandmother’s and 
I have adapted it slightly. I usually use butter for all my baking as my theory 
is always use the best produce and you will get the best results. However, this 
is the only recipe in which I use margarine, simply because it works so well. 
The recipe handed down to me says not to beat the bananas and to leave them in 
chunks – I don’t. I believe it works better when beaten and smooth.

Makes 6 good slices when hot, or 8 slices when cold
caster sugar 170g
margarine 113g
self-raising flour 170g
ripe bananas 2 small
free-range eggs 2 large
salt a good pinch

Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. First, blend together the caster sugar 
and the margarine, using a stand mixer or handheld whisk, until fluffy. Then 
add all the other ingredients making sure to scrape all the butter and sugar 
from the side of the bowl. Whizz all together for a minute or until it is a 
smooth batter. Line a 2kg loaf tin with a baking parchment liner, pour in the 
batter and bake on the top shelf for 45-55 minutes. It is done when a skewer 
comes out clean. Let it cool in the tin for five minutes. Slice and serve hot 
or cold.

 Hazelnut and raspberry friands. Photograph: Jean Cazals for the Observer 
Claire Ptak’s hazelnut and raspberry friands

Friands are little French almond cakes, which we love at the Violet Bakery 
because they are moist and tasty and also so easy to make. In this version, I 
substituted hazelnuts for some of the almonds because I had a few left over 
that I wanted to use up. I really like the way these turned out, because the 
hazelnut has a lovely light flavour. The nutty base lends itself to a variety 
of seasonal fruit toppings. Here I’ve used raspberries, but you could use any 
berries you like or slices of peaches, nectarines, plums, figs, or whatever.


Makes 12-16 friands
butter 115g, melted, plus more for greasing the moulds
plain flour 90g
baking powder ¾ tsp
ground almonds 50g
ground hazelnuts 80g
icing sugar 190g
egg whites 5, slightly whisked
vanilla extract 2 tsp
fresh raspberries 200g (about 40-50)
slivered hazelnuts 50g
icing sugar for dusting

Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Butter 12-16 friand moulds or cupcake 
tins.

Weigh out all the ingredients (except the raspberries and slivered hazelnuts) 
into the bowl of a food processor and blitz until foamy (about 1 minute).

Spoon the mixture into the moulds, filling them to about three-quarters full, 
then top each mould with 2-3 raspberries and sprinkle with the slivered 
hazelnuts.

Bake for about 15-20 minutes, until the tops of the cakes are springy to the 
touch. Leave the cakes to cool slightly in their moulds, then remove and dust 
them with icing sugar. They will keep well in an airtight container for a few 
days.

 Pistachio cake. Photograph: Jean Cazals for the Observer 
Jeremy Lee’s pistachio cake

Serves 8
For the apricots
apricots 12, plump
water 500ml
white wine 250ml
caster sugar 250g
vanilla pods 2
bay leaf 1
black peppercorns 10
lemon 4 strips of peel, and juice

For the cake
unsalted butter 250g, softened to room temperature
caster sugar 250g
whole almonds 100g, blanched and peeled
pistachios 150g, shelled
eggs 4 large
plain flour 40g
baking powder 1 level tsp
lemon 1

Place all the apricot ingredients except the apricots in a wide heavy bottomed 
pan. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Carefully lay the apricots in 
the liquid and return to a boil. Cover with a disc of greaseproof paper, remove 
from the heat and leave to cool for several hours or overnight.


Butter and line a deep 28-32cm round cake tin then heat an oven to 180C/gas 
mark 4.

Beat the butter and the sugar together until pale and fluffed. Grind the nuts 
in a food processor until quite fine but not powdered.

Crack the eggs into a jug and mix them well with a fork. Add this to the 
butter and sugar in small parts and whisk until a smooth batter is achieved. 
Sift the flour and baking powder into the batter, then gently fold in the 
almonds and pistachios. Juice the lemon and add this to the cake batter. Pour 
into the prepared cake tin.

Bake for 45-55 minutes until golden brown. To check if it is cooked through, 
the age-old skewer test is best. Insert a skewer in the middle of the cake: if 
clean when withdrawn it is done, if not, return to the oven for another 5-10 
minutes.

When the cake is cooked, gently spoon a few ladlefuls of the apricot syrup on 
to it. Place the cake on a handsome plate. Spoon the apricots and some syrup 
into a pretty bowl. Some cream is most welcome.

 Tres leches Photograph: Jean Cazals for the Observer 
Oswaldo Oliva’s tres leches

Super easy to make and extra delicious, tres leches is a sponge soaked in 
three dairy products (milk, condensed milk and evaporated milk), which became 
popular in Mexico and Latin America after the New York Condensed Milk Company 
was founded in 1857. The key to “the perfect cake” is controlling the amount of 
liquid the cake absorbs. It should be moist and oozy, but still able to hold 
its shape when sliced. In this recipe, I add a boozy note to the mix that can 
be replaced with your drink of choice.


Serves 10-12
For the cake
fine sponge flour 350g
baking powder 1 tsp
caster sugar 400g
salt 1½ tsp
eggs 2
vegetable or grapeseed oil 240ml
whole milk 240ml
vanilla extract 2 tsp

For the tres leches soak
milk 250ml
evaporated milk 170ml
condensed milk 170ml
vodka 2 tbsp
vanilla extract 2 tsp

To finish
double cream 500ml
caster sugar 75g
strawberries 250g

Heat the oven to 170C/gas mark 3. Butter and line a 23cm round tin with butter 
or non-stick cooking spray. Dust the sides of the cake tin with flour, tapping 
out any excess.


To make the cake, sift the flour and baking powder twice.

In a separate bowl, whisk the sugar, salt and eggs together until pale. Whisk 
in the oil. If using a mixer, use the whisk attachment on medium speed until 
you get a homogenous liquid.

Sift the dry ingredients into the liquid mix. Do it slowly and one large 
spoonful at a time. Mix well but only until the ingredients are combined. 
Overmixing will result in a tougher cake. Finally, whisk in the milk and 
vanilla extract.

Pour the batter in the floured cake tin and bake on the centre of the heated 
oven for 55-65 minutes. Prick with a toothpick to make sure that the batter is 
cooked (the toothpick should come out clean) and remove from the oven. Allow 
the cake to cool completely on the counter or a wire rack before removing from 
the tin.

To make the tres leches mix, combine the milks in a saucepan and set over a 
low heat, stirring constantly so that the condensed milk does not burn on the 
bottom. Remove from the heat and add the vodka and vanilla extract. Mix well 
and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Pour over the sponge to soak. Allow this to 
cool in the fridge for 30 minutes.

For the cream, combine the cream and sugar in the bowl of a mixer and whip 
until soft peaks are formed. Top the soaked cake with the whipped cream and 
strawberries.

Traditionally, tres leches is eaten as a sandwich cake. For this, cut the cake 
in half horizontally (after the cake has cooled and before soaking the sponge). 
Soak the cakes with the milk mixture and refrigerate (as above). Use half of 
the cream to sandwich the soaked cakes together and top with the remaining 
cream and the strawberries.
