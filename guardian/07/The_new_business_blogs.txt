From today, readers of guardian.co.uk are able to tap in to live comment and 
analysis from three of the City's leading commentators – economics editor Larry 
Elliott, financial editor Nils Pratley and city editor Jill Treanor.

We've launched new business blogs to widen our coverage of the increasingly 
fast-moving worlds of business, finance and economics. They join Nick 
Fletcher's widely-read Market Forces Live blog, giving readers comprehensive, 
up-to-the-minute coverage of the global financial markets.

The Guardian's economics team, led by economics editor Larry Elliott 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/larryelliott>, will provide rapid analysis 
of newly released economic data, together with longer pieces addressing issues 
ranging from the vast problems currently facing the global economy to public 
sector pensions and youth unemployment.

Larry has crunched the latest dismal PMI data for the manufacturing sector 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2011/oct/03/economics-manufacturingdata>
, and concluded that the mood is currently so negative that even the rare bit 
of good news is now ignored.

Nils Pratley, financial editor <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nilspratley>
, will deliver his considered opinions on markets, boardroom winners and 
losers, business values and much more.

Writing in the pithy style of his former Viewpoint column, Nils has kicked off 
his new blog witha critical look at Tesco's Big Price Drop 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2011/oct/03/tesco-price-cuts>
. Why, he wonders, does the Pratley household's weekly shop now cost £2.09more 
than it did before the the much-publicised price campaign?

Our news-driven business blog – incorporating the hugely popular live coverage 
of the current eurozone crisis and other big financial stories - is led by City 
editor Jill Treanor and will include news, instant views and gossip from across 
the corporate sector.

This morning Jill has been poring over the minutes from the Financial Policy 
Committee 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2011/oct/03/financial-policy-committee-bankofenglandgovernor>
, the new guardian of financial stability. The minutes provide a few more clues 
to the types of "levers" it would like to pull when markets are overheating - 
such as limiting the size of mortgages. She has also looked at the latestcareer 
moves from corporate jack-of-all-trades Andy Duncan 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/blog/2011/oct/03/andy-duncan-media-cars-lottery>
.

the stock market moves and gossip inNick Fletcher's Market Forces Live
