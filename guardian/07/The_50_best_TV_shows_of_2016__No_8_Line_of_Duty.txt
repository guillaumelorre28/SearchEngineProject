The third series of Jed Mercurio’s police corruption drama began with a chase, 
an execution, a coverup and a brilliant new character, Sergeant Danny Waldron 
(Daniel Mays), who looked as if he might become the new DI Lindsay Denton until 
he, too, was shot dead. And it ended with two extraordinarily intense 
interrogations – of DS Steve Arnott and DS “Dot” Cottan by their AC-12 
colleagues Superintendent Ted Hastings and DC Kate Fleming – followed by 
another big shootout.

And in between? Deep rot and corruption, revenge, torture and decapitation, 
hanging, further coverups, abuse, the unexpected but welcome return of the old 
Lindsay Denton (peerless Keeley Hawes), her later demise, and then her bloodied 
ghost appearing to Cottan. It was a story with so many subplots, false leads 
and dead ends that it kept you awake at night. Nothing was quite as it seemed. 
And yet it was so brilliantly thought out that it made sense internally, in the 
context of the previous two seasons, and – most importantly – in the context of 
the real world in which it exists.

It turned out that Waldron was sexually abused as a boy at a care home. There 
were chilling echoes ofNorth Wales 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales_child_abuse_scandal> and Jersey 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-28423082>. There were nods to 
Jimmy Savile, withering digs at Operation Yewtree. And though, it being Line of 
Duty, the abuse was only part of a deeper conspiracy, this connection to 
real-life news events made it terrifyingly plausible and all the more powerful.

Line of Duty <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/line-of-duty> is 
believable in all the procedure and office politics, too, even though the real 
police, unsurprisingly, didn’t cooperate (Mercurio relies on tips-offs and 
blogs). And in all its characters and performances. Is there a more convincing 
copper on television than Adrian Dunbar’s Ted Hastings? Or a better rogue than 
Craig Parkinson’s Cottan, AKA the Caddy? Dodgy to the core, but so human and 
vulnerable, it was sometimes hard not to sympathise. And this was Vicky 
McClure’s DC Fleming’s time, too, time to emerge from the shadows of her AC-12 
colleagues and kick some serious ass.

Was the “Urgent exit required!” finale – the break-out, guns blazing, glass 
smashing, a speeding Range Rover, Kate riding shotgun on a delivery truck, a 
hit and run, then a miracle shot – all a bit much? Maybe, but after the 
butt-clenching tension of those interrogations (surely the most gripping, 
involving television of the year; I actually felt like I was being grilled), it 
was acceptable to go out with a bang.

There’s another series to come next year. There’ll be no Caddy or Denton, but 
Fleming, Arnott and Hastings remain. It’s hard to see how Mercurio can top this 
one, or go any bigger and bolder, which is what he’s done up to now. But I 
can’t wait to find out. Bring it on.
