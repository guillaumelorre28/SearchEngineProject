The first question of TV drama departments, when presented with a new idea, is 
what kind of story it is (the correct answer is usually crime or costume). But 
a new ITV prime-time three-parter challenges categorisation.
Him is written by Paula Milne, whose previous credits include soap (Angels), 
political drama (The Politician’s Husband) and period (The Virgin Queen), but 
this one fits into no obvious box. The network describes Him as “domestic 
horror”, but it could also be called marital-supernatural, or science-friction.

The 17-year-old hero suffers both a common social situation – divorced parents 
who have started second families – and a rare one: telekinetic powers, allowing 
him to take out his anger towards his mum, dad and step-family by menacing them 
with flying or exploding objects.

A one-line pitch might have been “Stephen King meets Joanna Trollope”, but 
Milne says she thought in terms of character rather than genre: “I think being 
an adolescent male is a very hard thing; I wanted to write about that anger and 
confusion. There’s a story about Randy Newman, who had two boys followed by a 
girl. He was asked about the difference, and he said: ‘Well, if we’d had the 
girl first, we’d have thought the boys were retarded’. I’ve always loved that.”

Challenging the modern doctrine that there is no real difference between sons 
and daughters, Milne also questions the view (often promoted after a marriage 
break-up) that shared access can be accomplished without too much damage to the 
children or guilt for the adults. When someone asks the boy in the drama, “how 
are things at home?” he replies: “Which one?”

The twice-divorced Milne says: “Him is based on one of my sons. He knows, and 
is fine with it. I do feel guilt about the second divorce because I think I was 
very unforgiving. I also think I had cause. But with the children, it was awful 
watching them going through the upset and unhappiness, especially with the boys 
not being able to talk about it. ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Fine’. So I have drawn on 
that.”


Although not directly a horror story, Him shares with genre classics, 
including Rosemary’s Baby and The Omen, a sense of the sinister possibilities 
of fertility. The boy has one baby step-sibling and his step-mother has another 
two on the way. Milne, a twin (sister of the documentary-maker Claudia Milne) 
who herself has twins, says: “I wanted to write about the fear of being 
replaced or duplicated. It’s a very primal thing for children.”

For Milne, the anger-induced superpower of her protagonist, a sort of 
televisual grandson of The Incredible Hulk, is “a metaphor for the anger in 
adolescent boys, their struggle to control it.”

Even so, she wanted the boy’s gift to be as plausible as an unproven 
phenomenon can be. Whether writing about NHS nurses in Angels or Elizabeth I in 
The Virgin Queen, Milne always researches heavily. “With Him, I had a 
researcher check out telekinesis for me. It was very important to talk to 
people who take it seriously – paranormal researchers and so on – regardless of 
whether we believed in it.”

The spectrum of British TV dramatists ranges from those most devoted to 
dialogue (Alan Bennett, Sally Wainwright) to others (Dennis Potter, Russell T 
Davies) more driven by cinematic image-making. Milne, though neat with speech, 
acknowledges: “I absolutely think in pictures. I started as an artist, and I 
still do the slightly wanky thing of getting a huge sheet of art paper and 
drawing key scenes as I see them.”

A frequent tension for screenwriters is that directors don’t like being told 
what to show, so Milne, over four decades at the keyboard, has developed 
tactics for collaboration: “Writing the scene descriptions is a great art. You 
have to put down just so much that you get the scene as you saw it, but not be 
so prescriptive the director feels creatively frustrated and ignores everything 
you’ve written.”

A recent change Milne has made to her scripts is always to specify when 
someone is non-white. She accepts the argument of diversity champions such as
Lenny Henry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/30/lenny-henry-tv-industry-diversity>
 that decisions can’t be left to casting directors and must be made by writers. 
“I always write it into the script now. Although, actually, I was early to 
that: I did it on Angels.”

On her medical soap, multiracial casting was easier because a diverse 
workforce was, even in the 1970s, the reality of the NHS. What Milne likes 
about Him is that race is never a plot-point or ever mentioned in dialogue.

As part of an earlier wave of equalisation in the industry, Milne, having 
resigned as a BBC script editor (“because I couldn’t bring myself to give 
respect to bosses who hadn’t earned it”), created Angels and was determined not 
to be the only woman on the writing team: “At the time, there only really were 
two women writers in TV – Julia Jones and Fay Weldon – and neither was going to 
be doing my nursing soap. I literally couldn’t find women TV writers, so I 
brought them in from theatre and radio. I had a deal with the producer that, 
for every one of his “old lag” men we hired, I got a young woman. As the series 
went on, eventually it was more than half women.”

Milne’s writing apprenticeship was on Coronation Street, where she represented 
a different minority: “On that, I wasn’t the only woman but I was the only 
Southerner, which was arguably more isolating. I was in the pub near the studio 
with Harry Kershaw, who’d written it forever, and I said I was worried. He 
replied: ‘Well, let’s do the ‘innit’ or ‘intit’ test.’ I said: ‘what do you 
mean.’ And he said: ‘The weather is good today – innit or intit?’ I had a 50% 
chance of getting it right, so I said ‘intit?’ And he said: ‘You’ll be fine’.”


On the soap, writers were required to provide a cliffhanger or tantalising 
line going into the commercial break, and a pick-up coming out of it. When 
writing for commercial channels, Milne still structures her scripts around 
ad-breaks, but the rhythms of TV are changing, with ever more drama being 
binge-watched. So will screenwriters become less reliant on cliffhangers and 
recaps?

“That’s an interesting question,” she says. “I haven’t really thought about 
it. But yes, I’ve just written a series that doesn’t use recaps. So, yes, I was 
much more conscious that people might be watching three or four hours in one 
go.”

As well as changes in viewing patterns, the sort of drama that she has mainly 
written – shows to be watched weekly on terrestrial television – is, she 
accepts, demographically threatened too: “The ages of the audiences are 
terrifying. 60s on BBC1, 70s on BBC2. Those viewers need serving, but the 
problem is that the under-35s simply aren’t watching terrestrial TV. When I did 
The Virgin Queen, they were convinced young viewers would watch because one of 
the actors had been in a series the young watched. I argued that it didn’t work 
like that … and it didn’t. Even my own kids were saying: ‘Mum you’re not still 
writing that bloody costume thing, are you?’ I supported the idea of BBC3 going 
online only, because at least it meant younger people watch it.”

Him starts on ITV at 9pm on 18 October.
