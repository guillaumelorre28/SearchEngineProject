our top 10 most read stories.


Consumer issues featured heavily, from air rage over reclining seats to Black 
Friday and Boxing Day bargains. And our special investigation into the tiny 
state that rubber-stamped tax evasion of an industrial scale also made it into 
the top 10.

The vision of a windowless plane that would still would allow passengers to 
see what’s going on outside, as well as checking their email and surfing the 
net, really captured readers’ imagination.

In a glimpse of what the next generation of commercial aircraft might look 
like, windows would be replaced by full-length screens allowing constant views 
of the world outside. Passengers would be able to switch the view on and off 
according to their preference, identify prominent sights by tapping the screen 
or even just surf the internet.

Shoppers were out in force at the end of November, as more and more British

festive spending splurge. There were scuffles, police were called and shoppers 
bough things they didn’t really want or need.

Sometimes designers fail to see the big picture when dreaming up logos or 
product packaging. But, once you see the design fail, especially the risque 
ones, it’s pretty obvious really.

The extent to which so much global wealth has become corralled by a virtual 
handful of the so-called “global elite” was exposed in a new report fromOxfam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/oxfam>.

The world’s wealthiest people aren’t known for travelling by bus, but the 85 
who control as much wealth as the poorest half of the population could squeeze 
onto a single doubledecker.

The scale of Britain’s growing inequality was laid bare in another Oxfam 
report, A Tale of Two Britains: Inequality in the UK 
<http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/a-tale-of-two-britains-inequality-in-the-uk-314152>
, which showed that the country’s five richest families now own more wealth 
than the poorest 20% of the population. Oxfam said the poorest 20% in the UK 
had wealth totalling £28.1bn – an average of £2,230 each. That was equivalent 
to the five top UK entries on the Forbes rich list, who were worth £28.2bn in 
total.

The Knee Defender, a controversial $21.95 device that prevents the seat in 
front from reclining, caused a fight among passengers on United Airlines flight 
1462, forcing the plan to divert so the two passengers could be removed. The 
male passenger, seated in a middle seat of row 12, used the device to stop the 
woman in front of him reclining while he was on his laptop.

secret wires that allow government agencies to listen to all conversations on 
its networks, saying they are widely used in some of the 29 countries in which 
it operates in Europe and beyond. It broke its silence on in order to push back 
against the increasingly widespread use of phone and broadband networks to spy 
on citizens.

An unprecedented international investigation into tax deals struck with 
Luxembourg <https://www.theguardian.com/world/luxembourg> uncovered the

corporations.


A cache of almost 28,000 pages of leaked tax agreements, returns and other 
sensitive papers relating to over 1,000 businesses painted a damning picture of 
an EU state which is quietly rubber-stamping tax avoidance on an industrial 
scale.
