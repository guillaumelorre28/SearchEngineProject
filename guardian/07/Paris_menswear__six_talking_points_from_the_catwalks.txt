Russian vibes in Paris

All hail Gosha Rubchinskiy, the Moscow-dwelling designer who, via the free 
platform of Instagram, has built up a following of younger men acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. His aesthetic – Soviet Union 
influences (the bright yellow in his collection, he told us, is the yellow from 
the imperial Russian flag) meets 1980s sportswear and skateboarder style - is 
spreading fast.

His friend, Denma Gvasalia who hails from Georgia, heads up the left-field 
Vetements label and has just taken over the reigns at Balenciaga. Another 
Russian friend, Lotta Volkova Adam, is the stylist for both brands. Backstage 
at Louis Vuitton,British designer Kim Jones noted the excitement around this 
group

Paris went a bit theatrical

By which we mean the theatre was the venue of choice for many designers. Gosha 
Rubchinskiy showed his collection at Theatre des Bouffes du Nord on the day the 
current production rested. Designer Rei Kawakubo, one of fashion’s low key 
powerbrokers who has invested in Rubchinskiy’s label but who rarely ventures 
from the Comme des Garcons environs, sat front row.

Meanwhile Dries Van Noten delighted a bunch of routinely jaded menswear 
journalists and buyers by seating them in the wings of the actual stage of the 
opulant Palais Garnier, home of theParis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris> Opera. At the end of the show the 
models lined up to take a bow together. You would think that this “cast bow” 
idea had happened before at one of the zillions of preceding shows. Maybe it 
had, but for most, this was an upbeat first.

XXXL

Fashion is so over skinny fit. The new size to flaunt is what Starbucks call 
the “Venti”. Way too big. At Loewe, giant leather rucksacks hand painted with 
wild mushrooms, designed with effortless intelligence by Jonathan Anderson, 
dominated the fashion industry’s consciousness. The designer explained that 
scale was very much on his mind with this collection.

At industry favourite Raf Simons, giant cricket jumpers were designed to drown 
the models. Judging by the reaction to his show, this XXXL silhouette will 
filter down into real men’s wardrobes faster than you might think. What’s so 
weird about big and baggy?

Haircuts have moved beyond the David Beckham

Blue hair at Gosha, long shower hair at Lanvin, slicked hair at Louis Vuitton, 
plaits at Yohji Yamamoto – finally hair is moving beyond the David Beckham 
repertoire. Most challenging were the black bowl cuts at influential brand 
Junya Watanabe. The question is: are men ready to take on the Inspiral Carpets 
Clint Boon cut again? Hmm.

Soundtracks are becoming a Thing

This season designers decreed that a bass-heavy soundtrack was not enough. Two 
catwalks featured conductors – at Kenzo one coaxed a choir on the catwalk to 
provide the live soundtrack to what the designers said was a celebration of 
music fans. Meanwhile Balmain’s catwalk featured harps, cellos et al, which 
made the upbeat collection of Mr Darcy meets Michael Jackson costumes seem even 
more silly ... in a good way.

At Raf Simons, the soundtrack began with a voiceover of composer Angelo 
Badalamenti talking about his collaboration with David Lynch on Twin Peaks. 
Yohji Yamamoto continued the theme, using chunks of dialogue and music from the 
film Stand By Me. Elsewhere, Joy Division, the Smiths and, predictably, David 
Bowie all mucked in to provide the music for other, less dramatic shows.

Hedi Slimane is missing. Nothing to do with persistent rumours that he will 
soon vacate the role of creative director at Saint Laurent 
<http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2016/01/05/hedi-slimane-left-saint-laurent-rumours-denied>
. He’s abandoned his usual slot at the end of the menswear shows in Paris to do 
his own thing next month in LA, where he is based. With one of the big gurus 
yet to show his hand, it feels as if menswear for winter 2016 is still a little 
tbc.
