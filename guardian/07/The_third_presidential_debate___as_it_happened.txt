The third and final presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle is in the 
can. Here’s what happened:

 * Donald Trump said he might not accept the election result. “I will look at 
it at the time,” Trump said. “I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in 
suspense.” 
 * “That’s horrifying,” Hillary Clinton replied. “It just shows, you’re not up 
to doing the job. He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy, and I 
for one am appalled.” 
 * At least three Republican senators, among many alarmed voices, immediately 
objected to the Trump line, with Arizona’s Jeff Flakecalling the remarks 
<https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/788930879615737856> “beyond the pale”. 
 * The debate was surprisingly policy-oriented, with the candidates staking 
out contrasting positions on abortion, gun laws, Russia and much more. Trump 
allowed that his supreme court would likely overturn Roe v Wade. 
 * Trump rejected questions about women who have accused him of sexual 
assault, branding them fame-seekers and Clinton campaign plants and saying “I 
don’t know those people”. Jill Harth (@jillharth) 
@lucia_graves <https://twitter.com/lucia_graves> @guardian 
<https://twitter.com/guardian> Trump lied and lied again. He says he doesn't 
know any of the women. Well, he definitely knew me. I told the truth

<https://twitter.com/jillharth/status/788922038719287301> 
 * Clinton had a ready response, saying “every time Donald is pushed” – about 
women, a disabled reporter, the Khan family, John McCain, a federal judge – he 
denies responsibility and refuses apology. 
 * “Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,” Clinton said. “I don’t 
think there’s a woman out there who doesn’t know what that feels like.” 
 * Trump interrupted a Clinton answer about social security by muttering, 
“Such a nasty woman.”His favorite interruption was “wrong.” “Wrong.”

 * Clinton turned a question about her emails released by Wikileaks into a 
challenge to Trump to condemn Russian hacking. He did, provisionally.She called 
Trump Putin’s “puppet”. 
 * Trump said the only reason Iraq was going into Mosul was because Clinton 
was running for president: “She wanted to look tough.” Clinton said he was 
trapped in conspiratorial thinking. 
 * Trump warned about “bad hombre” immigrants: Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Trump: "We have some bad hombres here and we are going to get 'em out"

For the first time, the madness of Trump's ideas rather than the madness of 
his manner are taking centre stage at tonight's debate.

In a brief but jarringly vicious aside towards the end of the debate, Trump 
leaned in to the microphone to call Clinton a “nasty woman”, slightly 
undermining his earlier assertion that “nobody has more respect for women than 
me” (a moment which,according to pollster Frank Luntz 
<https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/788923620949045248>, did worse with his 
live focus group than any other in the debate for Trump).

The response from Twitter was swift and merciless.

Palin: accept election results 'if they're legit'

Here now is Sarah Palin, in the spin room, looking a bit cornered but firing 
away. She’s asked about accepting the results of the election. “If they’re 
legit results then of course they’ll be accepted,” she says.

Sessions: contesting an election gratuitously 'would be wrong'

This from Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s most stalwart backer in the 
senate, who we can’t remember ever having disagreed significantly with the 
candidate to this point:
Rick Klein (@rickklein) 
Jeff Sessions in spin room: "It would be wrong for a candidate to contest an 
election for light and transient reasons."

Trump, enemy of democracy:
1) My opponent shouldn't be allowed to run
2) If I lose, I may dispute outcome
3) If I win, she will go to jail.

Fact check: healthcare, vets and 'inner cities'

Alan Yuhas

Trump: “Next week [the healthcare premiums] are going to go up 100%”

Trump and Clinton both accept the reality that healthcare premiums have 
increased since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, but Trump appears to be 
exaggerating wildly. On average, premiums haverisen 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/>
 by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in 
the nine years before Obama,Politifact found 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/>
 earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data fromvarious states 
<http://acasignups.net/> and providers 
<https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D>

 jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according 
to ananalysis 
<http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/>
 by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Trump: “We take care of illegal immigrants … better than we take care of our 
vets”

This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, 
veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, 
social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do 
not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends 
more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has drawn a $113bn price tag 
from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration>
. He also inflated that number.

The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, 
combining an estimateon prison costs 
<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke>
 and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US 
without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of 
$69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 
education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access 
to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while 
migrants do not.

Trump: “Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store, 
you have no education, no jobs”

Trump’s repeated claim that “African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-lies-this-week-taxes-bankruptcy>
” defies most of American history, from antebellum slavery through the Jim Crow 
decades, great depression and segregation. Even if Trump is only referring the 
past half century, he is still wrong by most metrics.

Data on employment, education and health show empirical evidence for the 
persistent reality 
<http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/>
 ofdiscrimination 
<http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/>
 against black Americans, but also show major gains in the last few decades. In 
2015, black people earned just 75% as much as whites in median hourly earnings, 
whether full- or part-time,according to a Pew Research 
<http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/>
 analysis. The black unemployment rate inAugust 2016 was 8.1% 
<http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm>, compared with 4.4% for white 
people, but still lower than formost of the last 40 years. 
<http://www.macrotrends.net/2524/black-unemployment-rate-history-chart> Black 
life expectancy has increased from the mid-30s around 1900 to the mid-70s in 
2016,according to the CDC 
<http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db244.htm>. Education rates have 
similarly increased in the last 40 years,according to the census 
<http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/historical/fig8.jpg>.

The third and final presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle is in the 
can. Here’s what happened:

 * Donald Trump said he might not accept the election result. “I will look at 
it at the time,” Trump said. “I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in 
suspense.” 
 * “That’s horrifying,” Hillary Clinton replied. “It just shows, you’re not up 
to doing the job. He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy, and I 
for one am appalled.” 
 * At least three Republican senators, among many alarmed voices, immediately 
objected to the Trump line, with Arizona’s Jeff Flakecalling the remarks 
<https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/788930879615737856> “beyond the pale”. 
 * The debate was surprisingly policy-oriented, with the candidates staking 
out contrasting positions on abortion, gun laws, Russia and much more. Trump 
allowed that his supreme court would likely overturn Roe v Wade. 
 * Trump rejected questions about women who have accused him of sexual 
assault, branding them fame-seekers and Clinton campaign plants and saying “I 
don’t know those people”. Jill Harth (@jillharth) 
@lucia_graves <https://twitter.com/lucia_graves> @guardian 
<https://twitter.com/guardian> Trump lied and lied again. He says he doesn't 
know any of the women. Well, he definitely knew me. I told the truth

<https://twitter.com/jillharth/status/788922038719287301> 
 * Clinton had a ready response, saying “every time Donald is pushed” – about 
women, a disabled reporter, the Khan family, John McCain, a federal judge – he 
denies responsibility and refuses apology. 
 * “Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,” Clinton said. “I don’t 
think there’s a woman out there who doesn’t know what that feels like.” 
 * Trump interrupted a Clinton answer about social security by muttering, 
“Such a nasty woman.”His favorite interruption was “wrong.” “Wrong.”

 * Clinton turned a question about her emails released by Wikileaks into a 
challenge to Trump to condemn Russian hacking. He did, provisionally.She called 
Trump Putin’s “puppet”. 
 * Trump said the only reason Iraq was going into Mosul was because Clinton 
was running for president: “She wanted to look tough.” Clinton said he was 
trapped in conspiratorial thinking. 
 * Trump warned about “bad hombre” immigrants: Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs)

his manner are taking centre stage at tonight's debate.

<https://twitter.com/RobertsDan/status/788912001405841408>  
In a brief but jarringly vicious aside towards the end of the debate, Trump 
leaned in to the microphone to call Clinton a “nasty woman”, slightly 
undermining his earlier assertion that “nobody has more respect for women than 
me” (a moment which,according to pollster Frank Luntz 
<https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/788923620949045248>, did worse with his 
live focus group than any other in the debate for Trump).

The response from Twitter was swift and merciless.

2) If I lose, I may dispute outcome
3) If I win, she will go to jail.

Two Republican senators have condemned Trump’s refusal to say he will accept

Trump: “Next week [the healthcare premiums] are going to go up 100%”

Trump and Clinton both accept the reality that healthcare premiums have 
increased since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, but Trump appears to be 
exaggerating wildly. On average, premiums haverisen 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/>
 by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in 
the nine years before Obama,Politifact found 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/>
 earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data fromvarious states 
<http://acasignups.net/> and providers 
<https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D>

 jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according 
to ananalysis

 by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Trump: “We take care of illegal immigrants … better than we take care of our 
vets”

This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, 
veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, 
social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do 
not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends 
more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has drawn a $113bn price tag 
from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration>
. He also inflated that number.

The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, 
combining an estimateon prison costs 
<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke>
 and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US 
without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of 
$69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 
education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access 
to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while 
migrants do not.

Trump: “Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store, 
you have no education, no jobs”

Trump’s repeated claim that “African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-lies-this-week-taxes-bankruptcy>
” defies most of American history, from antebellum slavery through the Jim Crow 
decades, great depression and segregation. Even if Trump is only referring the 
past half century, he is still wrong by most metrics.

Data on employment, education and health show empirical evidence for the 
persistent reality 
<http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/>
 ofdiscrimination 
<http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/>
 against black Americans, but also show major gains in the last few decades. In 
2015, black people earned just 75% as much as whites in median hourly earnings, 
whether full- or part-time,according to a Pew Research 
<http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/>
 analysis. The black unemployment rate inAugust 2016 was 8.1% 
<http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm>, compared with 4.4% for white 
people, but still lower than formost of the last 40 years. 
<http://www.macrotrends.net/2524/black-unemployment-rate-history-chart> Black 
life expectancy has increased from the mid-30s around 1900 to the mid-70s in 
2016,according to the CDC 
<http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db244.htm>. Education rates have 
similarly increased in the last 40 years,according to the census 
<http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/historical/fig8.jpg>.
 
Who won? What was the headline? Trump saying he would keep the country in 
suspense as to whether he will accept the election result? What was that?
