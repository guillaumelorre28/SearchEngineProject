Ian McKellen <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ian-mckellen> says he turned 
down $1.5m (£1.14m) to officiate at Napster billionaire Sean Parker’s wedding 
dressed as Gandalf the wizard.

McKellen, who played the character in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings 
trilogy, didn’t know the source of the offer when he was asked to marry Parker 
and his wife, singer Alexandra Lenas. The request came via a mutual 
acquaintance of Parker and McKellen’s,according to the Mail on Sunday 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3750914/I-won-t-Lord-Wedding-rings-1million-Sir-Ian-Mckellen-tells-Facebook-billionaire.html>
. McKellen said he would have considered the offer if Parker hadn’t stipulated 
that he come in character.

“I don’t go dressing up, except in plays and things,” McKellen said 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3750914/I-won-t-Lord-Wedding-rings-1million-Sir-Ian-Mckellen-tells-Facebook-billionaire.html>
. “So I said, ‘I am sorry, Gandalf doesn’t do weddings.’”

Parker and Lenas’s Lord of the Rings-themed wedding went ahead in 2013 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2013/09/sean-parker-wedding-story> without 
McKellen. It was set in a fake ruined castle in Big Sur, California, where 
fur-covered tables were laden with whole roast pigs and guests were outfitted 
in clothes supplied by the film trilogy’s Oscar-winning costume designer, Ngila 
Dickson. The event, for which Parker negotiated exclusive use of an area of 
California redwood forest for months, cost $10m, while the company Parker had 
set up to run the wedding, Neraida, washit with $2.5m in penalties

Even though Gandalf didn’t marry Parker,the real McKellen may be available for 
weddings: the actor qualified as a celebrant in 2013, which allowed himto 
officiate the civil wedding
