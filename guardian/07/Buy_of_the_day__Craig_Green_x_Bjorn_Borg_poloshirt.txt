’s hole jumper – a simple cotton sweater with a hole in the centre – became 
something of a cult favourite of men in the front row. But, let’s be honest,

a bargain to them. To the rest of us, £85 is more friendly. That’s how much 
this long-sleeved polo shirt – a collaboration between Green and Swedish sports 
brand Björn Borg – costs. Now at Selfridges, it’s part of a collection that

status is only a matter of time.
