Pope Francis at the UN, 9/11 memorial, and a Madison Square Garden mass

Adam Brereton

Not a second of breathing room today for the pontiff, who marked his last day 
inNew York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> with the biggest day 
yet on what has been an action-packed tour:

 * Pope Francis demands UN respect rights of environment over the “thirst for 
power” in awide-ranging speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/25/pope-francis-asserts-right-environment-un>
 to the General Assembly in which he also called for a ban on nuclear weapons. 
 * At an inter-faith service at the 9/11 memorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/25/pope-francis-ground-zero-new-york-peace>
, the pope hoped that good would come from suffering and condemned “wrongful 
and senseless loss of innocent lives”. He embraced clerics and members from 
many faiths, including an Imam and a Rabbi.

 * Pope Francis visited an East Harlem school, where he spoke to children, 
parents and teachers, and received gifts made by immigrant workers. 
 * Thousands saw the pope parade through Central Park, with scalpers doing a 
fine trade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/25/pope-francis-new-york-central-park-ticket-scalpers>
 in tickets to enter. Many missed the 3.30pm deadline to enter the park and 
were turned away. 
 * At a mass for 20,000 people at New York’s iconic Madison Square Garden, the 
pope prayed that New Yorkers would reach out to those who have “no right” to be 
in the city – the homeless, elderly and immigrants – so they are no longer 
merely part of the urban landscape. 
Tomorrow the pope will depart for Philadelphia, where he’ll deliver yet 
another mass at the Cathedral of St Peter and Paul.

Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi says that yes, the pope hasn’t enjoyed the 
security at these huge events:

I think it is very clear that the pope personally does not like a lot of 
security around him. This is very clear. But he has accepted and he was aware 
that coming to the US there was also this aspect he would take into account. 
That the security is very strong and that he had to pay a price for coming here.

 And on the pope’s health:

Yes we can see that he is a little tired maybe, in working eh? And in doing 
steps [Lombardi here made a little walking motion with his hand] ... he has 
regular physiotherapy for this, and this can not happen during the visit.

Maybe he feels a little… the weight of these days. It’s not a particular 
problem. He has still energy for the last two days.

A journalist asks Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi whether the pope knew 
Speaker John Boehner would be resigning. His reply: no.

To be honest I have not spoken with the pope about this, and in this sense I 
can not say something very particular. Obviously he is informed about this, and 
he was impressed how the speaker was emotionally moved yesterday during the 
meeting with him ... The pope has said to me that he was impressed by the 
profound participation and emotion of the speaker yesterday.

Archbishop Joseph Kurtz adds that all those present had no foreknowledge of 
Boehner’s resignation, adding “he was very emotional and he spoke about how 
important it was for him that our holy father came and that it was agreed he 
would address Congress”.

Vatican spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi is giving a press briefing. He reminds 
reporters that when Pope Francis mentioned “lodging, labor and land” during his 
UN address this morning, he was repeating the slogan of the popular movements. 
Francis attended their meeting in July this year, when he visited Bolivia. 
Here’s anexcerpt from the speech 
<http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/07/10/pope_francis_speech_at_world_meeting_of_popular_movements/1157291>
 he gave:

What can I do, as collector of paper, old clothes or used metal, a recycler, 
about all these problems if I barely make enough money to put food on the table?

What can I do as a craftsman, a street vendor, a trucker, a downtrodden 
worker, if I don’t even enjoy workers’ rights?

What can I do, a farmwife, a native woman, a fisher who can hardly fight the 
domination of the big corporations?

What can I do from my little home, my shanty, my hamlet, my settlement, when I 
daily meet with discrimination and marginalization?

What can be done by those students, those young people, those activists, those 
missionaries who come to my neighborhood with their hearts full of hopes and 
dreams, but without any real solution for my problems?

A lot! They can do a lot. You, the lowly, the exploited, the poor and 
underprivileged, can do, and are doing, a lot.

I would even say that the future of humanity is in great measure in your own 
hands, through your ability to organize and carry out creative alternatives, 
through your daily efforts to ensure the three “L’s” (labor, lodging, land) and 
through your proactive participation in the great processes of change on the 
national, regional and global levels. Don’t lose heart!

It’s evening here in New York, it’s Friday night, and who knows, maybe you’re 
thinking of going out. Maybe you need some music to get you in the mood for a 
responsible evening out on the tiles? Why not letPope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> lead the way:
 The first song from Pope Francis’s rock album: Wake Up! Go! Go! Go! Forward! 
It’s a bit too prog for my tastes, but I’m sure the pontiff has his reasons 
for resurrecting this ancient style of music in his forthcoming album, Wake 
Up!, which you canread more

 John Boehner (R) and Pope Francis. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP 
In case you missed it, Chris Lehmann wrote earlier today for Comment is Free, 
on Speaker John Boehner’s resignation. If the speaker was in tears during the 
pope’s address, it may have been because “over the past five years, Boehner 
himself has presided over a far less decorous and infinitely more fractious 
show of ardent faith” – the Tea Party gospel.

The only problem with this particular religion, of course, is that it leaves 
anyone still clinging to a residual impulse to do the actual work of governing 
– the people’s business, as the DC leadership class used to quaintly call it

If you’re into papal intrigue, which I am, the traditionalist blog Rorate 
Caeli has translated an article by Marco Tosatti, an Italian journalist at La 
Stampa, whichalleges 
<http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2015/09/tosatti-election-of-jorge-bergoglio-by.html>
 Pope Francis (at the time Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio) was part of a so-called 
mafia club of cardinals and bishops who opposed Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.

The reports come after the publication of a biography of Belgian Cardinal 
Godfried Danneels, who was part of the group.


Danneels, according to the authors, had worked for years in preparation for 
the election ofPope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis>, 
which happened in 2013. He himself, however, in a video recorded during the 
presentation of the book, admits that he had taken part in a secret club of 
cardinals that were in opposition to Joseph Ratzinger.

While laughing he calls it “a Mafia club whose name was St. Gall” … The group 
wanted a drastic reform of the church, much more modern and up to date, with 
Jorge Bergoglio as Pope Francis at the head. And this is just as things turned 
out.

If you’ve suddenly got a rush of Da Vinci Code-style conspiracy vibes, let New 
York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> Times columnist Ross 
Douthat calm you down:
Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) 
There's buyer's remorse from some. But conservative RCs who think only a small 
cabal wanted (some of) these shifts are kidding themselves.

Before we wind up the blog for tonight, here’s some new information about 
Sophie, the 5-year-old girl who handed the pope a letter on immigration. It 
turns out, she iswell-organised 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/48e13a4f1ddc41aa83db5f44ff9e78a4/la-immigration-group-center-girls-encounter-pope>
 too:

For nearly a year [an immigration] group had been preparing the young girl 
from suburban Los Angeles to make a dash for the popemobile to deliver a 
message about the plight of immigrant parents living in the country illegally.

“We planned to do this from the moment we learned he was coming to the 
States,” Juan Jose Gutierrez of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition told 
the Associated Press.

“We have been working for a while now trying to sensitize the American public 
that dealing with immigration is not just dealing with the people who came in 
without proper documents but that we also have ... countless children whose 
parents are undocumented.”

Cardinal Timothy Dolan’s booming New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> accent rings out across Madison 
Square Garden: “At every single mass, every single day, we pray for and with 
Francis our pope … and now, here you are!”

The crowd leaps to their feet in a rapturous standing ovation. 

“It is clear how much you welcome you, how much we love you, how much we need 
you, how much we thank you for your visit. You have seen our cathedral …”

Dolan mentions “our priests, our seminarians, our deacons, our charitable 
works” and so on.

The pope seems a bit uncomfortable. As he told Catholic News Service, “I know 
that I am a sinner, so I speak with Jesus and tell him, ‘People are so good to 
think this of me.’ But the good that is in me, I owe to him. It is a gift from 
God.”

A few other short observations about language while the communion rite is 
completed and the hymns are sung (do tune in to the live stream at the top of 
the blog, the music is sublime).

As it says in the Epistle of James, language matters:

[L]ook at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive 
them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot 
directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits.

And you get the feeling the pope agrees. He’s told his bishops to avoid “harsh 
language” and reproaches, squabbling over doctrine and the like on this trip. 
And many traditionalist Catholics have rebuked the pope for not speaking more 
strongly on this issue or that, or omitting certain words from his homilies and 
prayers.

But I think you can understand where the pope is coming from with this quote 
from his namesake, St Francis: “Preach the Gospel at all times and when 
necessary use words.”

And now Gregorian chant for communion. Francis is bringing a lot of things 
into unity during this mass: modern and ancient languages; modern and ancient 
music (remember Jennifer Hudson provided the pre-show entertainment); the 
person in their dignity and the city in its anonymity.

There is a lot here to please both traditionally-minded Catholics and those 
interested in reform. As has been the case in so many other areas of his 
pontificate,Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> is 
trying to mend the tears in the “seamless garment” of the church.

And the Lord’s Prayer is also in Latin. Some of the congregation are mumbling 
a little.

For many Catholics, Latin is a kind of distasteful old relic that only 
conservative priests like. For the reformingPope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> to have used it so extensively 
during this service will be a talking point.

I'm actually quite happy the Pope is saying Mass in latin right now. 
Unthinkable for a prelate to do so 15 years ago.

Perhaps I spoke too soon: Pope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> has switched to Latin for the 
communion rite. Punditry never stays right for long, does it?

This mass will be closely scrutinized and emulated. Is it the new “best 
practice” mass then? Keeping the first section – the Liturgy of the Word, with 
its readings and prayers – for the people; then switching to a more clerical, 
universal expression of the liturgy for the Eucharistic Rite?

Now to the communion rite. And a reminder that the communion hosts don’t bake 
themselves.

Prayers of petition are made in a variety of languages – Gaelic, Mandarin, 
English, French and Italian – followed by “we pray to the Lord” in English.

What Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> has done 
with language on this tour is remarkable and I’d like to make a short 
observation:

One of the fruits of the reforming Second Vatican Council of the 1960s was the 
revision of the liturgy: rather than clerical Latin, the mass was said in the 
vernacular language of the people.

But what do you do in a multilingual immigrant society? Here, some priests 
secretly long for the return of the Latin mass as a sign of unity. But Francis 
says: Go! Move forward! Just let people offer their languages as a gift.

It’s an inversion of the old cleric-congregation relationship. In the past 
many Catholics would snooze or say the rosary while the priest spoke in Latin. 
Now it’s the priests who have to keep up with their parishioners’ languages.

Francis finishes his homily with some simple reflections on God in the city:

He moves us from the fray of competition and self-absorption and opens before 
us a path of peace. That peace which is born of accepting others; that peace 
which fills our hearts whenever we look upon those in need as our brothers and 
sisters.

God is living in our cities. The church is living in our cities. And God and 
the church who live in our cities want to be leaven in the dough, and relate to 
everyone, to stand at everyone’s side while they proclaim the wonders of the 
mighty counsellor … the prince of peace.

The people who walked in the darkness have seen a great light, and we 
Christians, are witnesses of that light.

Not a second of breathing room today for the pontiff, who marked his last day 
inNew York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> with the biggest day 
yet on what has been an action-packed tour:

 * Pope Francis demands UN respect rights of environment over the “thirst for 
power” in awide-ranging speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/25/pope-francis-asserts-right-environment-un>
 to the General Assembly in which he also called for a ban on nuclear weapons. 
 * At an inter-faith service at the 9/11 memorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/25/pope-francis-ground-zero-new-york-peace>
, the pope hoped that good would come from suffering and condemned “wrongful 
and senseless loss of innocent lives”. He embraced clerics and members from 
many faiths, including an Imam and a Rabbi.

 * Pope Francis visited an East Harlem school, where he spoke to children, 
parents and teachers, and received gifts made by immigrant workers. 
 * Thousands saw the pope parade through Central Park, with scalpers doing a 
fine trade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/25/pope-francis-new-york-central-park-ticket-scalpers>
 in tickets to enter. Many missed the 3.30pm deadline to enter the park and 
were turned away. 
 * At a mass for 20,000 people at New York’s iconic Madison Square Garden, the 
pope prayed that New Yorkers would reach out to those who have “no right” to be 
in the city – the homeless, elderly and immigrants – so they are no longer 
merely part of the urban landscape. 
Tomorrow the pope will depart for Philadelphia, where he’ll deliver yet 
another mass at the Cathedral of St Peter and Paul.
 
Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi says that yes, the pope hasn’t enjoyed the 
security at these huge events:

I think it is very clear that the pope personally does not like a lot of 
security around him. This is very clear. But he has accepted and he was aware 
that coming to the US there was also this aspect he would take into account. 
That the security is very strong and that he had to pay a price for coming here.

 And on the pope’s health:

Yes we can see that he is a little tired maybe, in working eh? And in doing 
steps [Lombardi here made a little walking motion with his hand] ... he has 
regular physiotherapy for this, and this can not happen during the visit.

Maybe he feels a little… the weight of these days. It’s not a particular 
problem. He has still energy for the last two days.

A journalist asks Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi whether the pope knew 
Speaker John Boehner would be resigning. His reply: no.

To be honest I have not spoken with the pope about this, and in this sense I 
can not say something very particular. Obviously he is informed about this, and 
he was impressed how the speaker was emotionally moved yesterday during the 
meeting with him ... The pope has said to me that he was impressed by the 
profound participation and emotion of the speaker yesterday.

Archbishop Joseph Kurtz adds that all those present had no foreknowledge of 
Boehner’s resignation, adding “he was very emotional and he spoke about how 
important it was for him that our holy father came and that it was agreed he 
would address Congress”.

Vatican spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi is giving a press briefing. He reminds 
reporters that when Pope Francis mentioned “lodging, labor and land” during his 
UN address this morning, he was repeating the slogan of the popular movements. 
Francis attended their meeting in July this year, when he visited Bolivia. 
Here’s anexcerpt from the speech 
<http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/07/10/pope_francis_speech_at_world_meeting_of_popular_movements/1157291>
 he gave:

What can I do, as collector of paper, old clothes or used metal, a recycler, 
about all these problems if I barely make enough money to put food on the table?

What can I do as a craftsman, a street vendor, a trucker, a downtrodden 
worker, if I don’t even enjoy workers’ rights?

What can I do, a farmwife, a native woman, a fisher who can hardly fight the 
domination of the big corporations?

What can I do from my little home, my shanty, my hamlet, my settlement, when I 
daily meet with discrimination and marginalization?

What can be done by those students, those young people, those activists, those 
missionaries who come to my neighborhood with their hearts full of hopes and 
dreams, but without any real solution for my problems?

A lot! They can do a lot. You, the lowly, the exploited, the poor and 
underprivileged, can do, and are doing, a lot.

I would even say that the future of humanity is in great measure in your own 
hands, through your ability to organize and carry out creative alternatives, 
through your daily efforts to ensure the three “L’s” (labor, lodging, land) and 
through your proactive participation in the great processes of change on the 
national, regional and global levels. Don’t lose heart!

In case you missed it, Chris Lehmann wrote earlier today for Comment is Free, 
on Speaker John Boehner’s resignation. If the speaker was in tears during the 
pope’s address, it may have been because “over the past five years, Boehner 
himself has presided over a far less decorous and infinitely more fractious 
show of ardent faith” – the Tea Party gospel.

The only problem with this particular religion, of course, is that it leaves 
anyone still clinging to a residual impulse to do the actual work of governing 
– the people’s business, as the DC leadership class used to quaintly call it

If you’re into papal intrigue, which I am, the traditionalist blog Rorate 
Caeli has translated an article by Marco Tosatti, an Italian journalist at La 
Stampa, whichalleges 
<http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2015/09/tosatti-election-of-jorge-bergoglio-by.html>
 Pope Francis (at the time Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio) was part of a so-called 
mafia club of cardinals and bishops who opposed Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.

The reports come after the publication of a biography of Belgian Cardinal 
Godfried Danneels, who was part of the group.


Danneels, according to the authors, had worked for years in preparation for 
the election ofPope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis>, 
which happened in 2013. He himself, however, in a video recorded during the 
presentation of the book, admits that he had taken part in a secret club of 
cardinals that were in opposition to Joseph Ratzinger.

While laughing he calls it “a Mafia club whose name was St. Gall” … The group 
wanted a drastic reform of the church, much more modern and up to date, with 
Jorge Bergoglio as Pope Francis at the head. And this is just as things turned 
out.

York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> Times columnist Ross

Before we wind up the blog for tonight, here’s some new information about 
Sophie, the 5-year-old girl who handed the pope a letter on immigration. It 
turns out, she iswell-organised 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/48e13a4f1ddc41aa83db5f44ff9e78a4/la-immigration-group-center-girls-encounter-pope>
 too:

For nearly a year [an immigration] group had been preparing the young girl 
from suburban Los Angeles to make a dash for the popemobile to deliver a 
message about the plight of immigrant parents living in the country illegally.

“We planned to do this from the moment we learned he was coming to the 
States,” Juan Jose Gutierrez of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition told 
the Associated Press.

“We have been working for a while now trying to sensitize the American public 
that dealing with immigration is not just dealing with the people who came in 
without proper documents but that we also have ... countless children whose 
parents are undocumented.”
 
The mass has ended. The crowd are cheering for the pope. “Please, I ask you, 
don’t forget to pray for me,” he says in English.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan’s booming New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> accent rings out across Madison 
Square Garden: “At every single mass, every single day, we pray for and with 
Francis our pope … and now, here you are!”

The crowd leaps to their feet in a rapturous standing ovation. 

“It is clear how much you welcome you, how much we love you, how much we need 
you, how much we thank you for your visit. You have seen our cathedral …”

Dolan mentions “our priests, our seminarians, our deacons, our charitable 
works” and so on.

The pope seems a bit uncomfortable. As he told Catholic News Service, “I know 
that I am a sinner, so I speak with Jesus and tell him, ‘People are so good to 
think this of me.’ But the good that is in me, I owe to him. It is a gift from 
God.”

A few other short observations about language while the communion rite is 
completed and the hymns are sung (do tune in to the live stream at the top of 
the blog, the music is sublime).

As it says in the Epistle of James, language matters:

[L]ook at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive 
them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot 
directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits.

And you get the feeling the pope agrees. He’s told his bishops to avoid “harsh 
language” and reproaches, squabbling over doctrine and the like on this trip. 
And many traditionalist Catholics have rebuked the pope for not speaking more 
strongly on this issue or that, or omitting certain words from his homilies and 
prayers.

But I think you can understand where the pope is coming from with this quote 
from his namesake, St Francis: “Preach the Gospel at all times and when 
necessary use words.”
 
And now Gregorian chant for communion. Francis is bringing a lot of things 
into unity during this mass: modern and ancient languages; modern and ancient 
music (remember Jennifer Hudson provided the pre-show entertainment); the 
person in their dignity and the city in its anonymity.

There is a lot here to please both traditionally-minded Catholics and those 
interested in reform. As has been the case in so many other areas of his 
pontificate,Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> is 
trying to mend the tears in the “seamless garment” of the church.

And the Lord’s Prayer is also in Latin. Some of the congregation are mumbling 
a little.

For many Catholics, Latin is a kind of distasteful old relic that only 
conservative priests like. For the reformingPope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> to have used it so extensively 
during this service will be a talking point.

I'm actually quite happy the Pope is saying Mass in latin right now. 
Unthinkable for a prelate to do so 15 years ago.

Perhaps I spoke too soon: Pope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> has switched to Latin for the 
communion rite. Punditry never stays right for long, does it?

This mass will be closely scrutinized and emulated. Is it the new “best 
practice” mass then? Keeping the first section – the Liturgy of the Word, with 
its readings and prayers – for the people; then switching to a more clerical, 
universal expression of the liturgy for the Eucharistic Rite?

Now to the communion rite. And a reminder that the communion hosts don’t bake 
themselves.

Prayers of petition are made in a variety of languages – Gaelic, Mandarin, 
English, French and Italian – followed by “we pray to the Lord” in English.

What Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> has done 
with language on this tour is remarkable and I’d like to make a short 
observation:

One of the fruits of the reforming Second Vatican Council of the 1960s was the 
revision of the liturgy: rather than clerical Latin, the mass was said in the 
vernacular language of the people.

But what do you do in a multilingual immigrant society? Here, some priests 
secretly long for the return of the Latin mass as a sign of unity. But Francis 
says: Go! Move forward! Just let people offer their languages as a gift.

It’s an inversion of the old cleric-congregation relationship. In the past 
many Catholics would snooze or say the rosary while the priest spoke in Latin. 
Now it’s the priests who have to keep up with their parishioners’ languages.

Francis finishes his homily with some simple reflections on God in the city:

He moves us from the fray of competition and self-absorption and opens before 
us a path of peace. That peace which is born of accepting others; that peace 
which fills our hearts whenever we look upon those in need as our brothers and 
sisters.

God is living in our cities. The church is living in our cities. And God and 
the church who live in our cities want to be leaven in the dough, and relate to 
everyone, to stand at everyone’s side while they proclaim the wonders of the 
mighty counsellor … the prince of peace.

The people who walked in the darkness have seen a great light, and we 
Christians, are witnesses of that light.
