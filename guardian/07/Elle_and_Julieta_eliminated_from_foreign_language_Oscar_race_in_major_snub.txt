, have already beenknocked out of the race 
<http://deadline.com/2016/12/oscars-foreign-language-film-2017-shortlist-1201872039/>
 for the best foreign language film Oscar, despite being two of the most 
high-profile and critically acclaimed international films of the year.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its nine-strong 
shortlist, slimmed down from the 85 entries for the category put forward by 
individual national award committees. Six films on the shortlist are drawn from 
a vote by an LA-based panel consisting of several hundred Academy members, plus 
three additional picks from the foreign language film award executive 
committee. This system, introduced in 2006, is designed to prevent past 
embarrassments when acclaimed films failed to gain a nomination.

Elle trailer: Isabelle Huppert stars in Paul Verhoeven’s noir thriller – 
exclusive video

However, with the omission of Elle and Julieta, along with such celebrated 
films as Berlin Golden Bear winner Fire at Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/fire-at-sea-review-masterly-and-moving-look-at-the-migrant-crisis>
 andNeruda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/neruda-review-unconventional-drama-constructs-rather-than-retells-chilean-poets-life>
, by the Chilean director Pablo Larraín, the Academy appears to have been 
unable to fully address the problem. Elle, directed by Paul Verhoeven and 
representing France, has already featured strongly on the US awards circuit, 
with lead actor Isabelle Huppert picking up multiple gongs after receiving high 
praise on its debut at Cannes. Likewise, the snub to Julieta, the latest film 
from Spanish auteur Almodóvar, was unexpected, although it has not benefited 
from quite the same level of critical adulation as Elle.

Two festival circuit favourites, Germany’s Toni Erdmann 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/13/toni-erdmann-review-long-german-comedy-is-slight-biting-little-miracle>
 (directed by Maren Ade), andThe Salesman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/the-salesman-review-asghar-farhadi-cannes>
, from Iranian Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi, have made the shortlist, along with
It’s Only the End of the World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/its-only-the-end-of-the-world-review-xavier-dolans-nightmarish-homecoming-is-a-dream>
 from Canadian director Xavier Dolan – which has drawn a decidedly mixed 
response compared to his previous film, Mommy – and Paradise, from veteran 
Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky, which has received middling reviews.

The nine films will then be voted on by invited panels of members based in Los 
Angeles, New York and London, to create the final five-film nomination list, 
which will be announced on 24 January. The final winner, voted on by the full 
eligible membership of the Academy, will be announced at theOscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars> ceremony on 26 February.
