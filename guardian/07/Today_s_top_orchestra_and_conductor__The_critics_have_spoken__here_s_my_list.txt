Who doesn’t love a list? Above all, one that is subjective, speculative, and 
ripe for discussion and probable violent disagreement? That’s whatBachtrack.com 
<https://bachtrack.com/worlds-best-orchestra-best-conductor-critics-choice-september-2015>
 has just compiled, asking an international panel of critics - including our own
 Tim Ashley <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timashley> - to name the 
world’s best orchestra, and the best conductor.

To no-one’s surprise, the North Lofoten Chamber Players and their chief 
conductor, Tine Thøresen, took both gongs for their transformative work 
developing classical music culture north of the Arctic Circle, convening 
concerts for the gigantic colloquies of sea-birds that gird theLofoten Island’s

 sea-stacks.

Yes, that’s of course a not-very-good joke, since the honours decided by the 
15 wise men and just one wise woman of the chosen panel (a much poorer ratio of 
gender equality, incidentally, than nearly all of the orchestras they 
nominated) went to theBerlin Philharmonic, and Riccardo Chailly 
<https://bachtrack.com/worlds-best-orchestra-best-conductor-critics-choice-september-2015>
.

From the US, only the Chicago and Boston Symphonies made it in the top 10, in 
5th and 9th place respectively, perhaps reflecting the fact that no North 
American critics took part: Bachtrack says they “abstained … on the basis they 
felt they had not seen enough of the world’s top orchestras recently enough to 
cast their votes”.

Only the London Symphony Orchestra  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jKeYuPvjM>represents the UK, coming in 6th; 
Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4788Tmz9Zo> is 2nd, 
and there are six orchestras from Germany and Austria: the Berliners, Wieners, 
Leipzigers, the Staatskapelles of both Dresden and Berlin, and the Bavarian 
Radio Symphony.

What about an alternative orchestral canon? In terms of artistic adventure, 
ambition, imagination and quality, I think you have to look outside the 
conventional symphony orchestras for the most consistently brilliant 
music-making. My top 10? In no particular order, theChamber Orchestra of Europe

And an alternative roster of conductors? Incredibly, Bernard Haitink 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf1M8CT7WQc> didn’t make the Bachtrack top 10. 
He has to be on my list, alongsideNikolaus Harnoncourt

What about your choices? You too can indulge your listomania (not to be 
confused withLisztomania

) and tell us who should, or shouldn’t, be there.
