<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/colombia-plane-crash-brazil-declares-three-days-of-mourning-chapecoense>
 after a plane carrying the Chapecoense football team crashed in Colombia,
killing 75 people on board. 
 * At least six people, including three players – Alan Ruschel, Jakson Follman 
and Zampier Neto – survived the crash. The goalkeeper Danilo was initially 
reported to have survived but died from his injuries, according to reports. 
 *  Two crew members – Ximena Suárez and Erwin Tumiri – and the journalist 
Rafael Valmorbida also survived, according to Colombia’s civil aviation 
authorities.

 * Those killed on the flight included 21 journalists travelling with the team 
for Chapecoense’s Copa Sudamerica finals match against Atléticao in Colombia’s 
second city, Medellín. The plane was en route from Bolivia to Medellín.

went down. There has been unconfirmed speculation that there may have been an 
electrical fault or that it ran out of fuel. 
 * As the plane was made in Britain, a team from the UK’s Air Accidents 
Investigation Branch issending inspectors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/british-investigators-fly-to-colombia-to-help-examine-plane-crash>
 to the crash site. Questions have been raised about why a team request to fly 
direct from Brazil, instead of from Bolivia, was rejected by Brazil’s civial 
aviation authority.

 * Bad weather hampered rescue efforts, which had to be briefly suspended due 
to heavy rain.Daylight images from the site showed rescue workers carrying away 
shrouded bodies of those killed in the crash. 
 * Football teams across the world have been expressing their condolences 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/29/chapecoense-fans-gather-stadium-brazil-chapeco-plane-crash-colombia>
. 
 * The mayor of Medellín said the crash was “a tragedy of huge proportions”. 
Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, offered support and sympathy to the families 
of those killed.

Hundreds of fans have gathered at Chapecoense’s stadium, the Condá Arena in 
the city of Chapecó, according to the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.

According to its reporter, the crowds have come wearing the team’s colours and 
carrying flags and flowers to leave in homage the victims. At one point the 
fans began to recite the Lord’s Prayer together.

Igor Damo, a local priest, told the newspaper: “There isn’t much to say right 
now. We have be praying lots and hugging each other. It is a time for hugs.”

An injury that sidelined Chapecoense player Alejandro Martinuccio from the 
trip to Medellín ended up probably saving his life, AP reports.

Speaking to Argentina’s La Red radio, the winger said: “I was saved because I 
got injured.” But he said: “I feel profound sadness … The only thing I can ask 
is prayers for the companions who were on the flight.”

 The 28-year-old has played for Spain’s Villarreal, Penarol of Uruguay and 
Brazilian clubs Coritiba, Ponte Preta, Cruzeiro and Fluminense.

Here’s a summary of what we know so far:

 * Brazil’s president Michel Tamer has declared three days of national mourning
 after a plane carrying the Chapecoense football team crashed in Colombia
killing 76 people on board. 
 * At least five people – including the players Alan Ruschel and Jakson 
Follman – survived the crash. The team’s goalkeeper Danilo survived the crash 
but died from his injuries, according to reports. There are unconfirmed reports 
that the defender Zampier Neto may also have survived the crash. Two crew 
members also survived. 
 * Those killed on the flight included 21 journalists travelling with the team 
for Chapecoense’s Copa Sudamerica finals match against Atléticao in Colombia’s 
second city, Medellín. The plane was en route from Bolivia to Medellín. 
 * The plane, a British Aerospace 146 was given priority to land but did not 
reach the airport, according to Alfredo Bocanegra, the head of Colombia’s civil 
aviation authority. It lost contact with ground controllers at around midnight.

 * As the plane was made in Britain, a team from the UK’s Air Accidents 
Investigation Branch is sending inspectors to the crash site. Questions have 
been raised about why a team request to fly direct from Brazil, instead of from 
Bolivia, was rejected by Brazil’s civial aviation authority.

 * Bad weather hampered rescue efforts, which had to be briefly suspended due 
to heavy rain.Daylight images from the site showed rescue workers carrying away 
shrouded bodies of those killed in the crash. 
 * Football teams across the world have been expressing their condolences. 
 * The mayor of Medellín said the crash was “a tragedy of huge proportions”. 
Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, offered support and sympathy to the families 
of those killed.

A Reuters photographer at the scene said dozens of bodies were laid out and 
covered with sheets around the wreckage as some 30 rescuers, police and 
military personnel searched the crash site of the plane that had had 81 people 
aboard.

 He said the BAe 146 charter aircraft had split in two with only the nose and 
wings recognisable and the tail end completely destroyed in the crash on Monday 
night.

The head of Chapecoense’s board has given a tearful interview on Brazilian 
breakfast news show Bom Dia Brasil, writes Tom Phillips.

Plínio David de Nês Filho, the president of Chapecoense’s board, said those 
close to the club were devastated by what had happened.

De Nês Filho was supposed to take the same flight but in the end made other 
plans.

He said: “There were lifelong friends on this flight ... and we think it will 
have been very hard for them to have survived this accident.

“This wasn’t just a group of people who respected each other professionally. 
It was a family, a group of friends.

“Everybody laughed so much, even in defeat... There was a great atmosphere, 
great joy. Yesterday morning, when I said goodbye to them, they said that they 
were going off to make our dreams come true. We shared this dream with all our 
emotion. And in the early hours of this morning, that dream came to an end.”

Questions are already being asked in Brazil about why the Chapecoense team 
were on the flight from Bolivia toColombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia> in the first place. 


The UOL Esporte website is reporting that Chapecoense 
<http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/651060_chapecoense-teve-voo-fretado-negado-pela-anac>
 officials had sought to charter a direct flight to Medellín from Brazil but 
that the club had its request rejected by Brazil’s civil aviation authority, 
Anac.

Raimundo Colombo, the governor of Santa Catarina, where the Chapecoense team 
is based, has issued astatement 
<http://dc.clicrbs.com.br/sc/esportes/noticia/2016/11/governo-de-sc-lamenta-acidente-com-aviao-da-chapecoense-estava-fazendo-historia-8538666.html>
 expressing his profound regret.

Colombo noted that Chapecoense were not only representing the city of Chapecó 
and the state of Santa Catarina, but were also making history as the first club 
from the region to reach the final of an international competition.


He said he was in “state of shock” and expressed his solidarity with the 
families of the players, club officials and journalists who formed the 
delegation “at what is a time of great pain for the sporting community in Santa 
Catarina and in Brazil”.

Nivaldo, a Brazilian goalkeeper who has been at the club since 2006 but did 
not travel to Colombia, told the UOL Esporte website that he was woken at 5am 
this morning by a phonecall from a worried friend whowanted to know if he was 
on the flight 
<http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2016/11/29/estou-me-preparando-para-o-pior-diz-atleta-da-chapecoense-que-nao-viajou.htm>
.

Nivaldo said he had tried to call his teammates and other club staff who were 
on the plane but that nobody picked up the phone.

The wife of one Brazilian survivor has used Instagram to express her relief. 
Amanda Ruschel, who is married to Alan Ruschel, the first player to be taken to 
hospital, posted an image of the player alongside the message:

“Thank God Alan is in the hospital, stable. We are praying for all of those 
who were not yet rescued and offer our support to all their relatives. This is 
a complicated, difficult situation. Only God himself can give us strength. 🏻 
Thank you God.”

Graças a Deus o Alan está no hospital, estado estável. Estamos orando por 
todos que ainda não foram socorridos, e força para todos os familiares. 
Situação complicado, difícil. Só Deus para dar força mesmo. 🙏🏻 obrigada Deus

The plane was given priority to land but did not reach the airport, according 
to Alfredo Bocanegra, the head of Colombia’s civil aviation authority. Speaking 
to Blu Radio, he said: “The plane reported an emergency on approach. It was 
given priority to land but then contact was lost.”

It is unclear why the plane failed to make the runway. One unconfirmed report 
said it ran out of fuel; another said there was an electrical fault.

Some truly heartbreaking stories are now emerging from Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil> about the lives of the victims, Tom 
Phillips reports.

Globo Esporte, a Brazilian sports website, is reporting that one of the dead 
players, Thiaguinho, found out he was to be a father for the first time just 
one week before the crash.

The family of the 22-year-old striker has released the following tribute video 
in which he can be seen celebrating the news with his teammates:
 
Colombia’s Red Cross has distanced itself from reports that the goalkeeper 
Danilo survived the initial impact of the crash. It confirmed that he died from 
his injuries. It pointed out that an initial list of survivors that included 
Danilo and that it tweeted, was based on a list issued by Colombia’s civil 
aviation authority.

An injury that sidelined Chapecoense player Alejandro Martinuccio from the 
trip to Medellín ended up probably saving his life, AP reports.

Speaking to Argentina’s La Red radio, the winger said: “I was saved because I 
got injured.” But he said: “I feel profound sadness … The only thing I can ask 
is prayers for the companions who were on the flight.”

 The 28-year-old has played for Spain’s Villarreal, Penarol of Uruguay and 
Brazilian clubs Coritiba, Ponte Preta, Cruzeiro and Fluminense.
 
Colombia’s civil aviation authority confirms the names of five people who 
survived the crash. Its updated list does not include Danilo the goalkeeper, 
who is reported to died from his injuries. It does include defender Zampier.

The plane that crashed was a British Aerospace 146, so UK experts are flying 
out to the crash site as part of the investigation.

A spokesman for the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch said: “As the 
State of Manufacture of the aircraft, the AAIB is sending a team of inspectors 
toColombia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia> to assist with the 
investigation of the aircraft accident at Medellin.”


He pointed out this is in line international protocols. 
 
The head of Chapecoense’s board has given a tearful interview on Brazilian 
breakfast news show Bom Dia Brasil, writes Tom Phillips.

Plínio David de Nês Filho, the president of Chapecoense’s board, said those 
close to the club were devastated by what had happened.

De Nês Filho was supposed to take the same flight but in the end made other 
plans.

He said: “There were lifelong friends on this flight ... and we think it will 
have been very hard for them to have survived this accident.

“This wasn’t just a group of people who respected each other professionally. 
It was a family, a group of friends.

“Everybody laughed so much, even in defeat... There was a great atmosphere, 
great joy. Yesterday morning, when I said goodbye to them, they said that they 
were going off to make our dreams come true. We shared this dream with all our 
emotion. And in the early hours of this morning, that dream came to an end.”

Questions are already being asked in Brazil about why the Chapecoense team 
were on the flight from Bolivia toColombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia> in the first place. 


The UOL Esporte website is reporting that Chapecoense 
<http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/651060_chapecoense-teve-voo-fretado-negado-pela-anac>
 officials had sought to charter a direct flight to Medellín from Brazil but 
that the club had its request rejected by Brazil’s civil aviation authority, 
Anac.

 
Three Chapecoense players who did not travel to Colombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia> have been pictured in a state of 
shock in the club’s changing room.

have been affected by tragedy,” he tweeted. “We are offering every form of help

Raimundo Colombo, the governor of Santa Catarina, where the Chapecoense team 
is based, has issued astatement 
<http://dc.clicrbs.com.br/sc/esportes/noticia/2016/11/governo-de-sc-lamenta-acidente-com-aviao-da-chapecoense-estava-fazendo-historia-8538666.html>
 expressing his profound regret.

Colombo noted that Chapecoense were not only representing the city of Chapecó 
and the state of Santa Catarina, but were also making history as the first club 
from the region to reach the final of an international competition.


He said he was in “state of shock” and expressed his solidarity with the 
families of the players, club officials and journalists who formed the 
delegation “at what is a time of great pain for the sporting community in Santa 
Catarina and in Brazil”.

Nivaldo, a Brazilian goalkeeper who has been at the club since 2006 but did 
not travel to Colombia, told the UOL Esporte website that he was woken at 5am 
this morning by a phonecall from a worried friend whowanted to know if he was 
on the flight 
<http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2016/11/29/estou-me-preparando-para-o-pior-diz-atleta-da-chapecoense-que-nao-viajou.htm>
.

Nivaldo said he had tried to call his teammates and other club staff who were 
on the plane but that nobody picked up the phone.

The wife of one Brazilian survivor has used Instagram to express her relief. 
Amanda Ruschel, who is married to Alan Ruschel, the first player to be taken to 
hospital, posted an image of the player alongside the message:

“Thank God Alan is in the hospital, stable. We are praying for all of those 
who were not yet rescued and offer our support to all their relatives. This is 
a complicated, difficult situation. Only God himself can give us strength. 🏻 
Thank you God.”

Graças a Deus o Alan está no hospital, estado estável. Estamos orando por 
todos que ainda não foram socorridos, e força para todos os familiares. 
Situação complicado, difícil. Só Deus para dar força mesmo. 🙏🏻 obrigada Deus

Reuters has more: 

Rescue operations at the site of a plane crash in central Colombia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia> were suspended in the early hours 
of Tuesday morning amid heavy rain, Medellín airport said.

Authorities were looking for survivors after an aircraft with 81 people 
aboard, including players from Brazil’s Chapecoense football team, crashed late 
on Monday.

“Search and rescue of the crashed Chapecoense plane is suspended because of 
heavy rain in the accident area,” Medellín airport, where the plane had been 
set to land, said on Twitter.
 
The plane was given priority to land but did not reach the airport, according 
to Alfredo Bocanegra, the head of Colombia’s civil aviation authority. Speaking 
to Blu Radio, he said: “The plane reported an emergency on approach. It was 
given priority to land but then contact was lost.”

It is unclear why the plane failed to make the runway. One unconfirmed report 
said it ran out of fuel; another said there was an electrical fault.
 
Agence France-Presse is reporting that five people survived the crash. Citing 
an official, it also says 25 bodies have been recovered from the crashed plane.
