Cleaners working at HMRC <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/hmrc> offices 
in Merseyside are going on strike on Monday in a fight to be paid the “national 
living wage”.

Thirty workers employed by ISS to clean the buildings via a complex 
subcontracting chain are arguing that they are no better off despite the rise 
in mandatory hourly rate, which from April guaranteed workers £7.20 an hour, 
because their employer offset the increase by cutting workers’ hours. HMRC is 
the government department responsible for enforcing the NLW.

Most of HMRC’s cleaners are on “poverty wages”

, according to the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and several 
qualify for benefits in the form of working tax credits. Two work for HMRC 
directly but top up their wages with second jobs as cleaners in the offices in 
the evenings after work.

The PCS group secretary, Martin Kelsey, said ISS had made “cynical 
mathematical calculations to avoid allowing some of their lowest paid workers 
the meagre benefit arising from the new NLW”.

 “They are a multinational corporate making hundreds of millions of profit a 
year refusing to pay a few people on absolute poverty wages a few pence an hour 
more. HMRC should not be in business with them directly or indirectly,” Kelsey 
added.

The union maintains that the cut in hours has left workers under pressure to 
do more for less and unable to deliver a proper service.

The dispute highlights the difficulty governments face in tackling low pay 
when a large proportion of employment is outsourced and chains of 
responsibility are opaque. George Osborne, the former chancellor, introduced 
the NLW of £7.20 an hour for those over 25 in April, saying people in the UK 
needed a pay rise, and that he wanted to reduce taxpayers’ bill for welfare 
payments to those in work but on pay low enough to qualify for working tax 
credits.


HMRC said the pay of cleaners in its offices was not its responsibility. 

“HMRC greatly appreciates the work cleaning staff do in our buildings. As 
cleaning staff are employed by an external contractor who set the terms and 
conditions of their employment, HMRC has no involvement in this process over 
their pay,” a spokesperson said.

The origins of the arrangement for HMRC buildings date back to 2001 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2263208.stm> when the department sold off 
its estate of more than 600 buildings to Mapeley, a Bermuda-based offshore 
company, as part of a private finance initiative. Thedeal was later condemned 
by MPs 
<http://http//www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmpubacc/312/31208.htm>
 as bad value and as undermining HMRC’s position as a tax collector.

HMRC leases back buildings from a subsidiary of Mapeley, and a further 
subsidiary, Salisbury FM 
<http://www.fm-world.co.uk/news/business-news/mapeley-launches-stand-alone-fm-business/>
, is contracted by Mapeley to manage the day-to-day running of the offices. 
Salisbury in turn subcontracts thecleaning to ISS, whose headquarters are in 
Denmark <http://www.issworld.com/>.

Although little known, ISS is one of the world’s largest outsourcing 
companies, employing over 500,000 people in 77 countries. It doubled its 
profits last year to £250m and increased its dividend by 51% earlier this year.

But the company declined to discuss whether its contract to clean HMRC offices 
allowed for increases in pay mandated by government. “Our contract with 
Salisbury is commercially sensitive and details are not made public. We do 
however have the necessary checks in place with our client to ensure the 
cleaning provision targets are reached and maintained,” it said in a statement.

A spokesperson for Salisbury FM declined to comment on questions about 
provisions in its contract with ISS for an increase in costs as a result of the 
NLW, saying that workers’ terms were a private matter between them and ISS and 
that Salisbury’s contract with ISS was also private and confidential.

Mapeley did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The HMRC cleaning dispute 
<http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Manufacturing/Fish-firm-in-National-Living-Wage-union-row>
 is one of several in which workers are fighting cuts to their terms and 
conditions imposed to offset the introduction of the NLW.

A spokesperson for ISS denied that the cleaning service had been affected and 
said that it still met the specification in its contract with HMRC: “We are of 
course very disappointed that following several rounds of discussion, our 
cleaning people at HMRC decided upon this course of action.

“We remain committed to seeking resolution to the various concerns raised by 
all of the relevant suppliers and stakeholders involved in this contract.”
