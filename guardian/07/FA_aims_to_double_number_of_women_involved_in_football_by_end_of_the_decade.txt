The Football Association has vowed to double the number of women playing and 
watching the game by the end of the decade, investing heavily to fuel an 
ambitious growth plan.

Martin Glenn <https://www.theguardian.com/football/martin-glenn>, the FA’s 
chief executive, said the governing body had made the women’s game its “prime 
candidate” for investment at a time when the FA would have more money than ever 
to put back into football. This week it will announce an international FA Cup 
TV deal worth more than £800m over six years that Glenn describes as 
“transformational”.

The FA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa> hopes moving the Women’s 
Super League, launched in 2011, from summer to winter from the autumn of 2017 
will help increase gates and investing at lower age levels will boost the 
numbers playing the game.

“Only four in 10 girls play at primary school, so the job for the next four 
years is to capture more of the talent who are playing and develop them more 
quickly,” Glenn told the Observer. “It’s expensive, but I maintain any pound 
spent on the women’s game has a far higher rate of return than just about 
anything else I can spend.”

He said the budget for women’s football would rise to £17.7m in 2016, an 
increase of around 16%.

Glenn pointed to the large crowds for some recent internationals and FA Cup 
finals at Wembley, plus the momentum generated by last year’sthird place at the 
Women’s World Cup

, as evidence of the impact investment could have.

“Unusually for an England team, we overperformed at a tournament. The money 
and effort we put into team identity and psychological resilience for the 
women’s team really paid off,” he said. “But the pool [manager] Mark Sampson 
has to pick from is about half the size of his French or German counterparts 
and given the importance of the national team in driving awareness, we have to 
ensure the England team continues to punch above its weight.”

In January, the former UK Sport chair Sue Campbell was made the head of 
women’s football and Glenn said one key task was to change the way the sport 
was perceived by some girls and parents.

“The research we’ve done on the barriers to women’s football is really clear. 
Girls feel they’re going to be judged, that people will think they’re a certain 
type of girl and that’s not the image they want. The other is a lack of support 
from parents,” Glenn said. “The two are probably linked. So a lot of the work 
we’ve got to do is to tackle those things. In 10 years’ time it won’t be an 
issue. It’s a societal thing that I think is very fixable.”

He also urged more clubs to invest in the women’s game. Manchester United 
still do not have a women’s side. “Women’s football clubs are still an 
investment, they don’t make money yet. We own that league and have to make sure 
the right incentives are in place to continue that investment,” Glenn said.

“I would guess that as the game grows, United will find it harder not to have 
a women’s team because the fanbase expects it, the community expects it. But if 
they choose not to there is one other very good team in Manchester that is 
hoovering up the talent.”

Glenn welcomed the global FA Cup deal. “We went in with a big ambition, saying 
4.5 billion people watch the Premier League around the world and theFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> is typically, by the later 
stages, Premier League clubs playing each other in a pretty intense format. We 
should be pretty ambitious for it,” he said. “We’re excited by the numbers 
we’re seeing on that. That is a transformational amount of money.”
