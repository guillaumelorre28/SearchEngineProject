Huge congratulations to Davis Love III and his United States of America team! 
A hugely deserved victory. Patrick Reed was their superstar, Ryan Moore the 
modest hero who sealed the deal. Brooks Koepka and Brandt Snedeker deserve 
plenty of the plaudits too, for the no-nonsense manner in which they set about 
gathering points. Every member of their side contributed, and they’ll be 
delighted to have won theRyder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> 
back after eight years. A fitting tribute to Arnold Palmer, who will hopefully 
be looking down on Hazeltine from the great clubhouse in the sky.

Europe meanwhile will scuttle off and lick their wounds. Darren Clarke’s side 
were soundly beaten, but they can be proud ofRory McIlroy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy>, who came of age as a senior 
figure in the team, and have blooded a real gem in Thomas Pieters. They’ll go 
again at Le Golf National in Paris in 2018. Jordan Spieth’s already been on TV 
saying the US team have victory in their sights; it’s going to be another 
wonderful brouhaha! Until then, thanks for reading!

USA 17-11 Europe

Just the one match out on the course. Martin Kaymer has found some hot form on 
the back nine today, coming back from three down. It’s sadly too late for 
Europe, but he’s got two putts to win the match. He uses them up, and the half 
brings him a one-hole victory over Matt Kuchar, who is smiling broadly anyway.

Here’s Darren Clarke, who is doing his best to smile through his misery. 
“There was a lot of blue early, and it looked as though our lads would put up a 
massive fight. Which they did, but the American guys holed their putts and 
showed their class. The bottom line is, the better team won! Some of the 
scoring has just been off the charts. It’s huge that our rookies blended in so 
well. They’ll take over the mantle in Paris in two years time. At the end of 
the day, congratulations to Davis, and we’ll try to win it back!”

But what about hero of the moment Ryan Moore?! He was simply sensational over 
the closing holes! Two down with three to play, he made a stunning eagle at 16, 
hit a gorgeous tee shot at 17 to set up birdie, and closed things out on 18 in 
the calm fashion. Has there been a more spectacular manner in which the Ryder 
Cup has been secured? He was a force of nature in last week’s Tour Championship 
play-off againstRory McIlroy <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy>, 
coming so close to a fine play-off victory; not only did that clinch his place, 
the fight clearly stood him in good stead this week. Along with Patrick Reed, 
he’s the USA’s man of the week! “I haven’t had a moment to even digest what 
just happened! I just tried my hardest not to let my team down. I love my 
team-mates, I love my captains, we had such a great time this week!”

USA 16-10 Europe

Some matches still out on the course, of course. Wood has a putt on 17 for the 
win, but the celebratory cheer on 18 sees his shoulders slump, and he yips it. 
They’ll head up the last with Dustin dormie. Meanwhile on 15, Zach Johnson 
closes his match out against young Matthew Fitzpatrick. All players mature at 
different rates, and thisRyder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> 
may have come a little early for Fitzpatrick. But he’ll be back for sure, and 
the experience will stand him in good stead.

Ladies and gentlemen, the winning captain, Davis Love III! He’s understandably 
emotional, having just been released from a bear hug by a sobbing Bubba Watson. 
“We lost Arnold Palmer on Sunday. It was a blow to our team. It’s not about one 
guy, but Bubba showed what heart we have. Everyone who played, and who didn’t 
play. I’m humbled that I’m in this position. These 12 players and the six 
captains. I’ll always remember Medinah, it was a lot of fun, and an experience, 
but this is different. I’m just super proud. We all pulled together. We’ve been 
kicked around for so long, so we did something different. And we’re going on 
with a better attitude from here on forward!” I think he’s in blissful shock. 
You’d need a heart of stone not to feel happy for him after the pain of four 
years ago. A class act!

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WIN THE 2016 RYDER CUP!!! USA 15-10 Europe

Ryan Moore cracks a magnificent second into 18, ten feet short of the flag. 
With Westwood in the bunker, it’s surely over. Westwood can’t get up and down. 
Moore cradles it up, Westwood offers his hand, Moore wins by one hole, and the 
USA are the worthy winners of the 2016 Ryder Cup! They have been absolutely 
magnificent! Ryan Moore didn’t even know he was playing this time last week!

Wood makes birdie on 16. Dustin has a six footer for a birdie and a half. If 
it goes in, it guarantees the half point that earns USA victory - he’d be 
dormie two - but points aren’t counted until matches are actually over. So it 
wouldn’t be his moment. Not technically. Ah, he’s missed it anyway. Wood wins 
the hole, and Dustin is only one up! It looks like the moment might be Ryan 
Moore’s, in any case.

USA 14-10 Europe

It’s so close now! Snedeker knocks his tee shot at 17 to six feet. Sullivan 
can only send his into the fringe near the water. Then he thins a chip ten feet 
past the hole. When he misses the par putt, he offers Snedeker a warm handshake 
and a smile. Snedeker wins 3&1. Now, then, who’s going to seal the deal?

The USA are moving ever closer. It’s just a question of when, how and who, not 
if. Martin Kaymer knocks in a birdie putt from Medinah distance on 14 to level 
his match with Matt Kuchar, but Ryan Moore knocks a pearler close at 17 to set 
up a birdie that hauls Lee Westwood back to parity. And on 16, Brandt Snedeker 
knocks in a missable one for a half that ensures he’s dormie two over Andy 
Sullivan. Who’s going to seal the deal?!

USA 13-10 Europe

Mickelson and Garcia both find the 18th in regulation. Mickelson curls in a 
15-footer from the back for his birdie; Sergio replies with one across the 
green from 12 feet. It would have been cruel had either man lost that match; it 
was a brilliant battle between two of the most entertaining players in the 
game! The first halved match of the afternoon, too.

One of the shots of the week by Ryan Moore! He’s in the middle of the par-five 
16th, and creams a fairway wood into the heart of the green, the banking on the 
right bringing his ball round and to a stop eight feet from the hole! Magical! 
The shot deserves to win the hole, and it does. Eagle, and he trails Lee 
Westwood by just one hole now. Fitzpatrick meanwhile ships another hole to Zach 
Johnson, this time at 12. AndDustin Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dustin-johnson> rolls one in from 12 feet at 
15 to turn the screw on Wood.

This battle between Sergio and Phil is something else! Sergio smacks his tee 
shot at 17 to eight feet. Phil replies by sending his to ten, then knocks in 
the birdie putt. Time for Sergio to buckle? Nope! He slots his away too, and 
these geniuses are heading down the last all square! Andy Sullivan meanwhile 
needs something to happen quickly, two down on 15. He’s got a 12-footer for the 
win, but lets it die on the right! Brandt Snedeker remains two up. And finally 
Matt Kuchar misses a five-footer on 13; Martin Kaymer is only one behind now. 
This isn’t overquite yet. Nearly, but not quite.

USA 11½-9½ Europe

Rose sends his second into 18 to 15 feet. It gives him the chance of a half, 
and he fails to hit it. A terribly lame effort, and one that sums up his week. 
He’s played well, but putted abysmally. Fowler wasn’t on top of his game 
either, but he was sharper when he needed to be, and his one-hole win nudges 
the USA closer to their holy grail! Just the three points required to end eight 
years of hurt!

Mickelson drives into the rough down 16 and is forced to lay up. His wedge 
into the green isn’t great, and Sergio’s on in two. Advantage Europe. Mickelson 
to putt first, and he races his effort miles past. Sergio has two putts for the 
hole, and he cradles up close enough for Mickelson to wave them towards the 
17th tee all square. Westwood meanwhile knocks his second into 15 to 12 feet, 
and strokes in the birdie putt. That’s back-to-back birdies from Westwood, and 
he’s taken control of his match at a crucial time. But it’s not good news for 
Danny Willett, who has rather sadly crumbled under the pressure his 
unimaginative brother put him under this week. He’s lost four of the last five 
holes, two of them having bogeyed, and Brooks Koepka is dormie five.

USA 10½-9½ Europe

Wood misses a four-footer on 13 that would have won the hole; Dustin Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dustin-johnson> remains two up. Fowler and 
Rose share the par-three 17th in regulation; Fowler goes up the last dormie. 
And Jimmy Walker tries to lay up at the par-five 16th and finds the water 
anyway. That’s surely going to be that. He chips through the green from the 
drop zone, and ends up with a bogey. Rafa Cabrera Bello wins 3&2, another 
rookie who really has delivered the goods this week. But while it looks good 
for Europe in the long term, and while there’s currently only one point in it 
overall, you don’t have to read too far down this list to see that the USA are 
getting very close to their first victory in eight years!

Mickleson makes his eighth birdie of the day at 15! It cancels out the one 
Sergio’s made, and he remains one up with three holes to go. Zach Johnson 
rattles in a 40-footer on 10 to turn the screw on Matthew Fitzpatrick in the 
final match. Bogey on 14 by Ryan Moore gives Lee Westwood two putts from short 
range after the European hits his second to ten feet; Westwood goes one up as 
the holes run out. And on 10, some strange scenes as Matt Kuchar hits a putt 
which has surely dropped into the hole. He’d go three up, but it hovers over 
the edge, seemingly defying all gravity. After a frustrating wait, as he 
realises the gods are against him, he taps in. Kaymer is still two adrift, but 
that might give him succour.

Justin Rose should have won his match with Rickie Fowler by now, but his 
putter has been stone cold all day. All week, really. He misses a 15-footer for 
birdie on 16; Fowler makes his, though, and suddenly the US star takes charge 
at a crucial moment.

There’s been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing while those matches were being 
decided.Not least Sergio and Phil peppering the flag at 14, the former missing 
a five-footer for birdie and giving the latter a read. Lefty doesn’t look those 
sort of gift horses in the mouth. Here’s the easiest way to catch up. It 
doesn’t make particularly good reading for Darren Clarke’s side. Davis Love III 
could be just a couple of hours away from post-Medinah salvation!

USA 10½-8½ Europe

JB Holmes has zig-zagged down the par-five 16th. He can only make par. Thomas 
Pieters is safely on the green in two, and he birdies to seal a 3&2 win. Four 
points out of five for the rookie, which is Europe’s best return and one of the 
greatest -the greatest - Ryder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup>

USA 10½-7½ Europe

McIlroy knocks his putt in. But Patrick Reed, unquestionably the player of the 
week, curls his shorter effort home, and seals a stunning one-hole victory over 
Europe’s main man! McIlroy delivered today, like he has all week, and yet his 
efforts weren’t enough against this brilliant young US star. He’s going to 
start winning majors soon enough, too. What a match that was!

McIlroy batters a huge drive down 18. Reed opens his shoulders and follows him 
down there. Reed to hit his approach first - and he creams a delicious one to 
six feet! That’s probably enough to secure the win, and he celebrates with a 
fist pump or two, but Rory knocks his second to eight feet. If he can rattle 
that birdie putt in, it’ll at least ask a question.

USA 9½-7½ Europe

Shades of Jean van de Velde - and of farce - as Spieth takes his shoes off and 
contemplates playing his wet ball on 16. A referee sticks his neb in, and 
suggests Spieth has moved the ball by sticking his toe in the water to check 
out if he has a stance. Spieth argues that he’s not sure he’s even going to 
play it, so it’s not worth checking videotape. He pulls his ball out of the 
drink, and concedes! Stenson was on the green in two anyway, and he’s won 3&2!
 Spieth attempts a stance over his ball on the 17th, but concedes the hole.

Rory to putt before Reed takes his chip. And he hits a rather timid one, 
leaving himself a tricky three feet still to travel downhill. Reed chips dead 
for his bogey - but Rory knocks his par putt in! Nerves of steel there. They go 
up 18. Can Rory somehow claw half a point off Reed? Meanwhile Holmes has a 
12-footer on 15 to claw a hole back off Pieters, but he leaves it high on the 
left and it horseshoes out. And on 16, Spieth’s second finds water; the end 
might not be long in that match.

McIlroy is in the last-chance saloon, with a pint and a chaser, and a fag on. 
Reed’s tee shot at 17 finds the rough surrounding the green. So does Rory’s, 
though it takes a fortunate bounce out onto the putting surface. He’ll take 
that. He’ll take anything right now. And Reed thins his chip straight through 
the green! A chance for Rory, who’ll be putting downhill from 25 feet? 
Meanwhile Mickelson rolls in a 30-footer on 12 to level things up against 
Sergio again. No idea how that one is going to finish. Willett misses a short

Jimmy Walker, having won two of the last three holes, clips his tee shot at 
the par-three 13th to six feet. Brilliant. Problem is, Rafa Cabrera Bello 
follows up by nearly holing in one. It’s conceded for birdie, and then Walker 
fails to convert his own chance. From surely thinking he was going to haul this 
match level, Walker is two down again. Meanwhile Stenson and Spieth trade 
birdie putts on 15. What a half!

McIlroy drives into the cabbage down the left of 16, and has to lay up at the 
par-five.Reed finds the bunker at the back of the green in two. McIlroy 
prepares to hit his wedge, and is heckled by a dullard. To be fair to the 
gallery, there are loud and prolonged boos, and one chap shouts “Get that guy 
outta here!” McIlroy takes aim again, and doesn’t hit his wedge particularly 
close at all. Reed, facing a tricky downhill bunker shot, splashes out to 18 
inches. It’s conceded, so McIlroy will have to sink a long one to avoid Reed 
going dormie two. He can’t make his 30 footer. Reed can’t lose. In better news 
for Europe, Pieters rolls in a birdie putt from 25 feet on 14; Holmes, eight 
feet behind the hole, is spooked and misses his chance. Pieters is two holes up.

Mickelson yips from two feet at 11 to gift the lead in match six to Garcia. In 
better news for the USA, Jimmy Walker rolls in a 25-footer across 12 to claim 
another hole back from Rafa Cabrera Bello. The Spanish rookie might start 
feeling a few nerves now. And Fowler rakes in a big par saver from the fringe 
at 13 to scramble a half. His match is still all square;Justin Rose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/justin-rose> should really be out of sight, 
but he’s not putted well, and Fowler is one hell of a scrapper.

A lovely moment of sportsmanship on 15. McIlroy and Reed both have looks at 
medium-range putts for the win; they both leave themselves tricky three footers 
for par. They spend a while looking at each other, then concede the putts. Reed 
in particular very generous there, McIlroy’s looked tougher. Altogether now: “I 
don’t think you would have missed it, but I wasn’t going to give you the 
chance!” Meanwhile Rose misses a tiddler to win on 12; a half with Fowler in 
bogey five. Stenson and Spieth pepper the flag at 14. Spieth misses first, 
giving Stenson the chance to move three up with holes running out; but he 
doesn’t hit the eight-footer he’s got for the win. Spieth off the hook there. 
But the young superstar isn’t at the top of his game this week; if he manages 
to turn this around, it’ll be not much short of sensational!

A sweet wedge into 11 by Cabrera Bello, landing 15 feet past the flag and very 
nearly spinning back into the cup.That was his third, though, and Walker’s on 
the front in two. A couple of putts by the PGA champ, and that’s a birdie. The 
Spaniard taps in to complete an up-and-down from 120 yards. A half. Sullivan 
birdies 9 to snatch a hole back off Snedeker.

So we were misinformed: Wood didn’t win 7 in bogey at all, he earned a half. 
And now his opponent Dustin Johnson’s birdied 8, the US Open champ is one up. 
Fitzpatrick claws a hole back from Zach Johnson at 5; the erstwhile Masters and 
Open winner is just one up now. Spieth gives up the ghost on 13 rather lamely: 
he takes his drop from the water, then duffs his chip into the sand. Stenson is 
two clear again.

Stenson gifts a hole back to Spieth by missing a four-footer for par on 12. 
But Spieth looks like returning the favour, having pulled his tee shot into 
water on the left of the par-three 13th. Stenson turns the screw by creaming 
his iron to six feet. Wood wins 7 with bogey, both he and Dustin in trouble off 
the tee. Westwood levels up his game against Moore with a 25-footer for birdie 
at 9. Garcia rolls in a 20-footer on 10 to haul Mickelson back to all-square. 
And Reed has a chance to snatch the 14th hole off McIlroy from ten feet, but 
there’s a big left-to-right curl on it, and he overcompensates. He remains one 
up in the first match and flagship battle, though.

Brandt Snedeker was two down after three holes; now he’s two up after eight! 
He snakes in a 25-footer across the 7th green for his third birdie in four 
holes, then it’s four from five after sending his tee shot at 8 to ten feet. 
Andy Sullivan hasn’t done much wrong! Koepka levels things up against Willett 
on 6. Walker grabs a hole back against Cabrera Bello with a 35-footer across 
10. And Zach Johnson moves further ahead of a struggling Matthew Fitzpatrick in 
the final match at 4; the European is two down, both holes lost to par. A 
brilliant birdie for Pieters on 11 to retake the lead against Holmes is the 
only scrap of good news for Europe, who are on the end of a thrashing if things 
stay the same.

United States team celebrates Ryder Cup win over Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/03/united-states-team-celebrates-ryder-cup-win-over-europe-video>
.  
Huge congratulations to Davis Love III and his United States of America team! 
A hugely deserved victory. Patrick Reed was their superstar, Ryan Moore the 
modest hero who sealed the deal. Brooks Koepka and Brandt Snedeker deserve 
plenty of the plaudits too, for the no-nonsense manner in which they set about 
gathering points. Every member of their side contributed, and they’ll be 
delighted to have won theRyder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> 
back after eight years. A fitting tribute to Arnold Palmer, who will hopefully 
be looking down on Hazeltine from the great clubhouse in the sky.

Europe meanwhile will scuttle off and lick their wounds. Darren Clarke’s side 
were soundly beaten, but they can be proud ofRory McIlroy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy>, who came of age as a senior 
figure in the team, and have blooded a real gem in Thomas Pieters. They’ll go 
again at Le Golf National in Paris in 2018. Jordan Spieth’s already been on TV 
saying the US team have victory in their sights; it’s going to be another 
wonderful brouhaha! Until then, thanks for reading!

Just the one match out on the course. Martin Kaymer has found some hot form on 
the back nine today, coming back from three down. It’s sadly too late for 
Europe, but he’s got two putts to win the match. He uses them up, and the half 
brings him a one-hole victory over Matt Kuchar, who is smiling broadly anyway.

Kuchar v Kaymer 1UP (F)
 
Here’s Darren Clarke, who is doing his best to smile through his misery. 
“There was a lot of blue early, and it looked as though our lads would put up a 
massive fight. Which they did, but the American guys holed their putts and 
showed their class. The bottom line is, the better team won! Some of the 
scoring has just been off the charts. It’s huge that our rookies blended in so 
well. They’ll take over the mantle in Paris in two years time. At the end of 
the day, congratulations to Davis, and we’ll try to win it back!”
 
Pars for Dustin and Chris Wood down the last. A one-hole victory, and another 
point on the board for the victorious hosts!

But what about hero of the moment Ryan Moore?! He was simply sensational over 
the closing holes! Two down with three to play, he made a stunning eagle at 16, 
hit a gorgeous tee shot at 17 to set up birdie, and closed things out on 18 in 
the calm fashion. Has there been a more spectacular manner in which the Ryder 
Cup has been secured? He was a force of nature in last week’s Tour Championship 
play-off againstRory McIlroy <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy>, 
coming so close to a fine play-off victory; not only did that clinch his place, 
the fight clearly stood him in good stead this week. Along with Patrick Reed, 
he’s the USA’s man of the week! “I haven’t had a moment to even digest what 
just happened! I just tried my hardest not to let my team down. I love my 
team-mates, I love my captains, we had such a great time this week!”
 
Some matches still out on the course, of course. Wood has a putt on 17 for the 
win, but the celebratory cheer on 18 sees his shoulders slump, and he yips it. 
They’ll head up the last with Dustin dormie. Meanwhile on 15, Zach Johnson 
closes his match out against young Matthew Fitzpatrick. All players mature at 
different rates, and thisRyder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> 
may have come a little early for Fitzpatrick. But he’ll be back for sure, and 
the experience will stand him in good stead.

Ladies and gentlemen, the winning captain, Davis Love III! He’s understandably 
emotional, having just been released from a bear hug by a sobbing Bubba Watson. 
“We lost Arnold Palmer on Sunday. It was a blow to our team. It’s not about one 
guy, but Bubba showed what heart we have. Everyone who played, and who didn’t 
play. I’m humbled that I’m in this position. These 12 players and the six 
captains. I’ll always remember Medinah, it was a lot of fun, and an experience, 
but this is different. I’m just super proud. We all pulled together. We’ve been 
kicked around for so long, so we did something different. And we’re going on 
with a better attitude from here on forward!” I think he’s in blissful shock. 
You’d need a heart of stone not to feel happy for him after the pain of four 
years ago. A class act!
 
Ryan Moore cracks a magnificent second into 18, ten feet short of the flag. 
With Westwood in the bunker, it’s surely over. Westwood can’t get up and down. 
Moore cradles it up, Westwood offers his hand, Moore wins by one hole, and the 
USA are the worthy winners of the 2016 Ryder Cup! They have been absolutely 
magnificent! Ryan Moore didn’t even know he was playing this time last week!

Wood makes birdie on 16. Dustin has a six footer for a birdie and a half. If 
it goes in, it guarantees the half point that earns USA victory - he’d be 
dormie two - but points aren’t counted until matches are actually over. So it 
wouldn’t be his moment. Not technically. Ah, he’s missed it anyway. Wood wins 
the hole, and Dustin is only one up! It looks like the moment might be Ryan 
Moore’s, in any case.

It’s so close now! Snedeker knocks his tee shot at 17 to six feet. Sullivan 
can only send his into the fringe near the water. Then he thins a chip ten feet 
past the hole. When he misses the par putt, he offers Snedeker a warm handshake 
and a smile. Snedeker wins 3&1. Now, then, who’s going to seal the deal?
 
The USA are moving ever closer. It’s just a question of when, how and who, not 
if. Martin Kaymer knocks in a birdie putt from Medinah distance on 14 to level 
his match with Matt Kuchar, but Ryan Moore knocks a pearler close at 17 to set 
up a birdie that hauls Lee Westwood back to parity. And on 16, Brandt Snedeker 
knocks in a missable one for a half that ensures he’s dormie two over Andy 
Sullivan. Who’s going to seal the deal?!

Mickelson and Garcia both find the 18th in regulation. Mickelson curls in a 
15-footer from the back for his birdie; Sergio replies with one across the 
green from 12 feet. It would have been cruel had either man lost that match; it 
was a brilliant battle between two of the most entertaining players in the 
game! The first halved match of the afternoon, too.
 
One of the shots of the week by Ryan Moore! He’s in the middle of the par-five 
16th, and creams a fairway wood into the heart of the green, the banking on the 
right bringing his ball round and to a stop eight feet from the hole! Magical! 
The shot deserves to win the hole, and it does. Eagle, and he trails Lee 
Westwood by just one hole now. Fitzpatrick meanwhile ships another hole to Zach 
Johnson, this time at 12. AndDustin Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dustin-johnson> rolls one in from 12 feet at 
15 to turn the screw on Wood.

Brooks Koepka puts an end to Danny Willett’s miserable week. The pair share 
the 14th in par, and that seals a 5&4 victory for the US debutant! Danny can 
now go home and give his brother Peter some beneficial advice on the subjects 
of manners and righteousness.
 
This battle between Sergio and Phil is something else! Sergio smacks his tee 
shot at 17 to eight feet. Phil replies by sending his to ten, then knocks in 
the birdie putt. Time for Sergio to buckle? Nope! He slots his away too, and 
these geniuses are heading down the last all square! Andy Sullivan meanwhile 
needs something to happen quickly, two down on 15. He’s got a 12-footer for the 
win, but lets it die on the right! Brandt Snedeker remains two up. And finally 
Matt Kuchar misses a five-footer on 13; Martin Kaymer is only one behind now. 
This isn’t overquite yet. Nearly, but not quite.

Rose sends his second into 18 to 15 feet. It gives him the chance of a half, 
and he fails to hit it. A terribly lame effort, and one that sums up his week. 
He’s played well, but putted abysmally. Fowler wasn’t on top of his game 
either, but he was sharper when he needed to be, and his one-hole win nudges 
the USA closer to their holy grail! Just the three points required to end eight 
years of hurt!

Mickelson drives into the rough down 16 and is forced to lay up. His wedge 
into the green isn’t great, and Sergio’s on in two. Advantage Europe. Mickelson 
to putt first, and he races his effort miles past. Sergio has two putts for the 
hole, and he cradles up close enough for Mickelson to wave them towards the 
17th tee all square. Westwood meanwhile knocks his second into 15 to 12 feet, 
and strokes in the birdie putt. That’s back-to-back birdies from Westwood, and 
he’s taken control of his match at a crucial time. But it’s not good news for 
Danny Willett, who has rather sadly crumbled under the pressure his 
unimaginative brother put him under this week. He’s lost four of the last five 
holes, two of them having bogeyed, and Brooks Koepka is dormie five.

Wood misses a four-footer on 13 that would have won the hole; Dustin Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dustin-johnson> remains two up. Fowler and 
Rose share the par-three 17th in regulation; Fowler goes up the last dormie. 
And Jimmy Walker tries to lay up at the par-five 16th and finds the water 
anyway. That’s surely going to be that. He chips through the green from the 
drop zone, and ends up with a bogey. Rafa Cabrera Bello wins 3&2, another 
rookie who really has delivered the goods this week. But while it looks good 
for Europe in the long term, and while there’s currently only one point in it 
overall, you don’t have to read too far down this list to see that the USA are 
getting very close to their first victory in eight years!

Mickleson makes his eighth birdie of the day at 15! It cancels out the one 
Sergio’s made, and he remains one up with three holes to go. Zach Johnson 
rattles in a 40-footer on 10 to turn the screw on Matthew Fitzpatrick in the 
final match. Bogey on 14 by Ryan Moore gives Lee Westwood two putts from short 
range after the European hits his second to ten feet; Westwood goes one up as 
the holes run out. And on 10, some strange scenes as Matt Kuchar hits a putt 
which has surely dropped into the hole. He’d go three up, but it hovers over 
the edge, seemingly defying all gravity. After a frustrating wait, as he 
realises the gods are against him, he taps in. Kaymer is still two adrift, but 
that might give him succour.

Justin Rose should have won his match with Rickie Fowler by now, but his 
putter has been stone cold all day. All week, really. He misses a 15-footer for 
birdie on 16; Fowler makes his, though, and suddenly the US star takes charge 
at a crucial moment.
 
There’s been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing while those matches were being 
decided.Not least Sergio and Phil peppering the flag at 14, the former missing 
a five-footer for birdie and giving the latter a read. Lefty doesn’t look those 
sort of gift horses in the mouth. Here’s the easiest way to catch up. It 
doesn’t make particularly good reading for Darren Clarke’s side. Davis Love III 
could be just a couple of hours away from post-Medinah salvation!

JB Holmes has zig-zagged down the par-five 16th. He can only make par. Thomas 
Pieters is safely on the green in two, and he birdies to seal a 3&2 win. Four 
points out of five for the rookie, which is Europe’s best return and one of the 
greatest -the greatest - Ryder Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> 
debuts of all time?

McIlroy knocks his putt in. But Patrick Reed, unquestionably the player of the 
week, curls his shorter effort home, and seals a stunning one-hole victory over 
Europe’s main man! McIlroy delivered today, like he has all week, and yet his 
efforts weren’t enough against this brilliant young US star. He’s going to 
start winning majors soon enough, too. What a match that was!

McIlroy batters a huge drive down 18. Reed opens his shoulders and follows him 
down there. Reed to hit his approach first - and he creams a delicious one to 
six feet! That’s probably enough to secure the win, and he celebrates with a 
fist pump or two, but Rory knocks his second to eight feet. If he can rattle 
that birdie putt in, it’ll at least ask a question.
 
Shades of Jean van de Velde - and of farce - as Spieth takes his shoes off and 
contemplates playing his wet ball on 16. A referee sticks his neb in, and 
suggests Spieth has moved the ball by sticking his toe in the water to check 
out if he has a stance. Spieth argues that he’s not sure he’s even going to 
play it, so it’s not worth checking videotape. He pulls his ball out of the 
drink, and concedes! Stenson was on the green in two anyway, and he’s won 3&2!

Rory to putt before Reed takes his chip. And he hits a rather timid one, 
leaving himself a tricky three feet still to travel downhill. Reed chips dead 
for his bogey - but Rory knocks his par putt in! Nerves of steel there. They go 
up 18. Can Rory somehow claw half a point off Reed? Meanwhile Holmes has a 
12-footer on 15 to claw a hole back off Pieters, but he leaves it high on the 
left and it horseshoes out. And on 16, Spieth’s second finds water; the end 
might not be long in that match.

McIlroy is in the last-chance saloon, with a pint and a chaser, and a fag on. 
Reed’s tee shot at 17 finds the rough surrounding the green. So does Rory’s, 
though it takes a fortunate bounce out onto the putting surface. He’ll take 
that. He’ll take anything right now. And Reed thins his chip straight through 
the green! A chance for Rory, who’ll be putting downhill from 25 feet? 
Meanwhile Mickelson rolls in a 30-footer on 12 to level things up against 
Sergio again. No idea how that one is going to finish. Willett misses a short 
one on 9 to fall further behind Koepka; Dustin birdies 10 to move further ahead 
of Wood.

Jimmy Walker, having won two of the last three holes, clips his tee shot at 
the par-three 13th to six feet. Brilliant. Problem is, Rafa Cabrera Bello 
follows up by nearly holing in one. It’s conceded for birdie, and then Walker 
fails to convert his own chance. From surely thinking he was going to haul this 
match level, Walker is two down again. Meanwhile Stenson and Spieth trade 
birdie putts on 15. What a half!

McIlroy drives into the cabbage down the left of 16, and has to lay up at the 
par-five.Reed finds the bunker at the back of the green in two. McIlroy 
prepares to hit his wedge, and is heckled by a dullard. To be fair to the 
gallery, there are loud and prolonged boos, and one chap shouts “Get that guy 
outta here!” McIlroy takes aim again, and doesn’t hit his wedge particularly 
close at all. Reed, facing a tricky downhill bunker shot, splashes out to 18 
inches. It’s conceded, so McIlroy will have to sink a long one to avoid Reed 
going dormie two. He can’t make his 30 footer. Reed can’t lose. In better news 
for Europe, Pieters rolls in a birdie putt from 25 feet on 14; Holmes, eight 
feet behind the hole, is spooked and misses his chance. Pieters is two holes up.

Mickelson yips from two feet at 11 to gift the lead in match six to Garcia. In 
better news for the USA, Jimmy Walker rolls in a 25-footer across 12 to claim 
another hole back from Rafa Cabrera Bello. The Spanish rookie might start 
feeling a few nerves now. And Fowler rakes in a big par saver from the fringe 
at 13 to scramble a half. His match is still all square;Justin Rose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/justin-rose> should really be out of sight, 
but he’s not putted well, and Fowler is one hell of a scrapper.

A lovely moment of sportsmanship on 15. McIlroy and Reed both have looks at 
medium-range putts for the win; they both leave themselves tricky three footers 
for par. They spend a while looking at each other, then concede the putts. Reed 
in particular very generous there, McIlroy’s looked tougher. Altogether now: “I 
don’t think you would have missed it, but I wasn’t going to give you the 
chance!” Meanwhile Rose misses a tiddler to win on 12; a half with Fowler in 
bogey five. Stenson and Spieth pepper the flag at 14. Spieth misses first, 
giving Stenson the chance to move three up with holes running out; but he 
doesn’t hit the eight-footer he’s got for the win. Spieth off the hook there. 
But the young superstar isn’t at the top of his game this week; if he manages 
to turn this around, it’ll be not much short of sensational!

A sweet wedge into 11 by Cabrera Bello, landing 15 feet past the flag and very 
nearly spinning back into the cup.That was his third, though, and Walker’s on 
the front in two. A couple of putts by the PGA champ, and that’s a birdie. The 
Spaniard taps in to complete an up-and-down from 120 yards. A half. Sullivan 
birdies 9 to snatch a hole back off Snedeker.

So we were misinformed: Wood didn’t win 7 in bogey at all, he earned a half. 
And now his opponent Dustin Johnson’s birdied 8, the US Open champ is one up. 
Fitzpatrick claws a hole back from Zach Johnson at 5; the erstwhile Masters and 
Open winner is just one up now. Spieth gives up the ghost on 13 rather lamely: 
he takes his drop from the water, then duffs his chip into the sand. Stenson is 
two clear again.

Stenson gifts a hole back to Spieth by missing a four-footer for par on 12. 
But Spieth looks like returning the favour, having pulled his tee shot into 
water on the left of the par-three 13th. Stenson turns the screw by creaming 
his iron to six feet. Wood wins 7 with bogey, both he and Dustin in trouble off 
the tee. Westwood levels up his game against Moore with a 25-footer for birdie 
at 9. Garcia rolls in a 20-footer on 10 to haul Mickelson back to all-square. 
And Reed has a chance to snatch the 14th hole off McIlroy from ten feet, but 
there’s a big left-to-right curl on it, and he overcompensates. He remains one 
up in the first match and flagship battle, though.

Brandt Snedeker was two down after three holes; now he’s two up after eight! 
He snakes in a 25-footer across the 7th green for his third birdie in four 
holes, then it’s four from five after sending his tee shot at 8 to ten feet. 
Andy Sullivan hasn’t done much wrong! Koepka levels things up against Willett 
on 6. Walker grabs a hole back against Cabrera Bello with a 35-footer across 
10. And Zach Johnson moves further ahead of a struggling Matthew Fitzpatrick in 
the final match at 4; the European is two down, both holes lost to par. A 
brilliant birdie for Pieters on 11 to retake the lead against Holmes is the 
only scrap of good news for Europe, who are on the end of a thrashing if things 
stay the same.
