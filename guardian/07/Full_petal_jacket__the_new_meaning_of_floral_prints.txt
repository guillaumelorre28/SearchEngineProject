‘Florals for spring? Groundbreaking.” Time was when the idea of flowers having 
any kudos in the world of proper fashion was so risible that it became a 
crushing one-liner in The Devil Wears Prada. But fast-forward a decade and 
Miranda Priestly’s put-down to her editorial staff is seriously dated, because 
in 2016 flowers pack a real punch in fashion. Not such much in that it’s cool 
to go to theChelsea flower show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2016/may/23/chelsea-flower-show-preview-in-pictures>
 or because bouquet-bragging is one of the more nauseating aspects of 
Instagram, but because flower prints have lost their intentionally inoffensive 
it’s-just-a-pretty-pattern vibes and have started to actually signify 
something. They have become a reasonably sophisticated way of semaphoring your 
wardrobe message: you really can say it with flowers (sorry). Everyone has 
succumbed to the floral trend in recent months – from Harry Styles on the red 
carpet, toAdele in the video for Send My Love 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4BbF7B29w> to Hillary Clinton on some 
campaign downtime.

So how did this happen? As is the way with so much in fashion right now, we 
can lay the blame squarely at the door of Gucci and Vetements – the two labels 
that are unequivocably leading the style conversation. In one floral corner you 
have designer Alessandro Michele, who has taken the Gucci brand’s historical 
penchant for flora and fauna out of the archives and reinstated flowers at the 
heart of his visually ecelectic collection. He has given a high-fashion boost 
to the kind of upholstered floral prints that have spent the past decade unsold 
in a vintage shop.

Meanwhile, collective Vetements, aside from escalating the fashion status of 
DHL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/dhl-t-shirt-vetements-fashion-paris-catwalk>
, has also succeeded in making wonky, ditsy, floral-print ruffled dresses, last 
seen on the catwalks at the height of grunge, the stuff of £2,000 dreams. 
Subtext: ditsy floral dresses can be toughened up into designer streetwear with 
the right kind of boots.

The danger with indulging in such a – on the face of it – democratic trend, is 
that it is not democractic at all. The floral message could easily be mixed; 
context is all. Ditsy floral prints on a man’s shirt can be a bit “three pints 
at a christening”, while upholstery flowers work better with gig-sweaty hair 
than a shampoo and set. The horticultural fashion axis could be pretty tricky 
to navigate without our helpful guide. Imogen Fox

For male celebrities on the display shelf that is the red carpet, tradition 
has been ousted by more outre, flamboyant looks straight out of theMSQRD app 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/08/love-faceswapping-apps-memes-trend-kanye>
 (think face swaps and bunny ears). Take three very different red-carpet events 
and there’s a unifying trend edging towards the peacock: Will.i.am wearing a 
Gucci black satin tuxedo with white flower detail on the sleeves at the Met 
Ball; Swizz “Mr Alicia Keys” Beatz wearing a monochrome Tom Ford tuxedo with a 
white floral pattern (at the Brooklyn Museum Artists Ball); Labrinth in a blue 
and pink orchid suit; and Olly Alexander from Years and Years in a relaxed 
autumnal coloured floral suit (both at the Brits). A feminisation of the 
traditional suit and also a sartorial battle to show how “woke” they are.Priya

There’s something terribly hip about succulents, isn’t there? Picture this: a 
living/dining room, knocked through. A whitewashed wall. And a line of 
succulents on a shelf. So the transition from interiors to fashion was always 
going to happen (see House of Hackney and Topshop, which have both used green 
foliage for their summer prints). Their success is twofold. Not only is green 
an especially wearable and on-trend colour, according to the catwalks 
(especially when compared with the multicoloured florals on this page), but the 
size of the leaves are both absurd and eccentric. Because, yeah, fashion can be 
hilarious.Morwenna Ferrier

Cartoon-style flower designs are once again in full bloom. But the thing about 
pop-art aesthetics is that you want to only use the correct amount of it to 
avoid looking like the type of person who owns a lot of adult colouring books. 
Finding a balance between Looney Tunes and Alois Auer is always tricky, but 
both Finery (Keith Haring-esque designs) and Marni (Lego-coloured prints) have 
it finely tuned.PE

The much derided ditsy floral (small, dainty, the baby voice of the floral 
print) has had quite the journey to being on-trend in 2016. At first glance, 
it’s a throwback to the 1990s – to Kookai or, at a push, 6am at a field rave. 
But fashion proper has subverted its history – and its “girly” connotations – 
by using it in new and innovative ways: patched together in Versace shirts, and 
mixed and matched in Mary Katrantzou’s Russian peasant-ish collection. 
Vetements, obviously, nailed it this season, whipping up wonky floral frocks 
with too-long sleeves and wrinkled floral boots that are as grungy as they are 
pretty. Even the wipe-down aprons in pretty florals carried enough irony to put 
two fingers up to the patriarchy.MF

An opaque term that, historically, reeks of charity shops, moths and, 
ultimately, a death in the family. Not so this summer, because this print has 
been reborn thanks to pop music and Gucci. The formula of this floral print is 
precise: two parts grandma’s curtain to one part new Gucci. See Adele in her 
Dolce & Gabbana dress for Send My Love, the oversized ethereal print lending a 
numinous quality to the song’s sentiment, or current-season Gucci (via the 
eccentric, dainty florals in textured green lace). Or, most relevant now, 
Beyoncé in her yellow creased silk Gucci suit in Lemonade. Time to rethink the 
curtains.MF

As everyone knows, Friday night’s shame spiral begins with your choice of 
clothes. We all have that one bold-print shirt that, at best, says “edgy cool” 
and, at worst, “the most humane thing would be to release it back into the 
wild”. In the 90s it was the Hawaiian shirt, then it was colourful, angular 
designs and now it’s about dark florals (an abundance of which are available in 
Topman and River Island). So instead of looking as if you are two drinks away 
from “wacky”, you can mute the loudness of your shirt with the blacks, whites 
and a subtle gothy floral print. The key word here, is “subtle”.PE
