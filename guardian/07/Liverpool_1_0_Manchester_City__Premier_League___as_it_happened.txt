Full-time: Liverpool 1-0 Manchester City

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over and Liverpool take the points after a 
much-hyped game that was a seriously damp squib on a night renowned for 
fireworks. That injury time smoke bomb aside, this was anything but incendiary, 
butLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> won’t mind - Geo 
Wijnaldum’s early goal has moved them back to within six points of Chelsea and 
further damaged City’s chances of winning the title. That’s all from me in 2016 
- have a very happy new year ... or at the very least try to have a less 
miserable one than the horror-show that was 2016.

Georginio Wijnaldum gives Liverpool deserved win against Manchester City

90+5 min: Liverpool win a corner and try to keep the ball in the corner and 
eventually get a goal-kick. At the far end of the pitch, somebody from the City 
end throws a smoke cannister on the pitch and a steward waits for it to go out 
before removing it from the field.

90+2 min: Good defending from Georginio Wijnaldum, who’s bullet header after 
eight minutes remains the only goal of the game. He denies Kevin De Bruyne as 
the City midfielder, who’s had a terrible game, tries to go a rampaging through 
theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area.

85 min: Liverpool try to Arsenal their way through the City defensive ranks 
with a series of tippy-tappy passes, before Emre Can decides instead to try and

minutes.

82 min: Plenty of huff and puff from both teams in the middle third, but 
neither is able to find the killer pass that might help carve out an opening.

Milner is no rush to take.

79 min: Manchester City win another corner after good work around the edge of 
the area from Sterling, Silva and De Bruyne. The Belgian sends the ball high 
into the area, where Firmino heads the ball back towards his own goal before 
it’s whacked down the park.

75 min: Craig Pawson books Emre Can for a foul on Raheem Sterling as both 
teams continue to give the ball away repeatedly. Divock Origi just blew a great 
chance to put Sadio Mane through on goal with a woeful “through”-ball that went 
straight to the feet of a defender. This may have been billed as a potential 
classic, but it certainly hasn’t been one.

67 min: Raheem Sterling cuts inside from the right flank, jinking past Lallana 
before failing to get past James Milner.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> certainly seem to think 
Sterling failed to keep the ball in play and let it be known in the strongest 
possible terms that their side should have had a throw-in.

59 min: Somebody seems to have flicked a switch for City, who have improved 
immeasurably in the past few minutes. They win a corner, which is sent towards 
Kolarov on the edge of the penalty area. He leathers it on the fly with his 
left foot, but his shot takes a deflection and Mignolet gathers comfortably.

57 min: Yaya Toure picks out Raheem Sterling with a wonderful pass from deep. 
Darting down the inside right channel, the winger stretches every sinew in a 
bid to hook the ball across the penalty area, but his diminutive stature means 
he finds the side-netting from a very tight angle.

56 min: More signs of life from City, as David Silva picks up the ball, cuts 
in from the right and tries to curl a shot inside the far upright. It fizzes 
narrowly wide, but not by much. Good effort.

54 min: Sergio Aguero finally gets a shot on goal, but his effort from

52 min: City are struggling badly to get the ball out of their own half, while 
Kevin De Bruyne is loitering way behind the play waiting forLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> to lose possession so he can 
be in a decent position when City attack on the break. It ain’t happening for 
him at the moment, so he might be advised to get nearer the action and seek out 
the ball.

Lallana, with the former appearing very agitated indeed over some perceived 
slight. The ref has a word with both and peace resumes.

Second half: Liverpool 1-0 Man City

46 min: Liverpool get the ball rolling, playing into the Kop in the second 
half of their final game of 2016. It’s gone well for them so far against a 
strangely subduedManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, who will need to up 
their game considerably if they’re to turn things around.

Half-time: Liverpool 1-0 Man City

45+1 min: Referee Craig Pawson signals for the break after one minute of added 
time and Liverpool go in a Georginio Wijnaldum goal to the good. It’s been 
anything but a classic, butManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have themselves to blame 
for that. Since conceding an early goal, they’ve been contained easily by 
Liverpool and have failed to register a single shot on target. Sterling, De 
Bruyne, Silva and Aguero have all ben starved off possession in a first half 
dominated throughout by the hosts.

and Adam Lallana break towards the City goal. Firmino releases Lallana into 
space with only Bravo to beat, but theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> man is flagged for offside. 
Firmino needed to be a little quicker there.

39 min: Sterling and Silva finally exchange passes around the edge of the 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area and the 
Spaniard tees up Kolarov for a shot. He doesn’t make proper contact and sends 
his effort wide.

38 min: Sterling receives the ball on the edge of the final third but is 
immediately harried and prods the ball out of play for aLiverpool

Pep Guardiola is going to do here, but he needs to start thinking about a spot

35 min: Raheem Sterling gets on the ball near the halfway line, but is forced 
back and once again the ball finds its way back to Bravo. He plays it short to 
Otamendi, who is immediately put under pressure and wellies the ball long and 
out of play. City are really poor this evening, but only their hod-carriers and 
water-carriers are getting any time to settle on the ball and they keep giving 
it away.

33 min: Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> 
win a free-kick on the halfway line and three passes later, the ball finds its 
way back to Claudio Bravo. Impressive pressing by Liverpool, who are resolute 
in their efforts to ensure City’s better players don’t get a sniff of the ball. 
City, it should be noted, are doing themselves few favours as they continue to 
lose possession.

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over and Liverpool take the points after a 
much-hyped game that was a seriously damp squib on a night renowned for 
fireworks. That injury time smoke bomb aside, this was anything but incendiary, 
butLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> won’t mind - Geo 
Wijnaldum’s early goal has moved them back to within six points of Chelsea and 
further damaged City’s chances of winning the title. That’s all from me in 2016 
- have a very happy new year ... or at the very least try to have a less 
miserable one than the horror-show that was 2016.

Georginio Wijnaldum gives Liverpool deserved win against Manchester City

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/31/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report> 
90+5 min: Liverpool win a corner and try to keep the ball in the corner and 
eventually get a goal-kick. At the far end of the pitch, somebody from the City 
end throws a smoke cannister on the pitch and a steward waits for it to go out 
before removing it from the field.
 
90+4 min: Nicolas Otamendi gets booked for handball while tussling for the 
ball with Origi.
 
90+2 min: Good defending from Georginio Wijnaldum, who’s bullet header after 
eight minutes remains the only goal of the game. He denies Kevin De Bruyne as 
the City midfielder, who’s had a terrible game, tries to go a rampaging through 
theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area.
 
90 min: Four minutes of added time is the shout from the fourth official, who 
hoists his board and prompts plenty of jeering around Anfield.
 
88 min: David Silva is barged on the edge of the Liverpool penbalty area, but 
no free-kick is forthcoming.Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> substitution: Kelechi 
Iheanacho on for Yaya Toure. Liverpool substitution: Lucas on for Sadio Mane. 
Rumours linking Lucas with a January move to Inter mean this could be the 
Brazilian’s final appearance for Liverpool.
 
87 min: Can loses the ball and Navas replaces Firmino, with his head almost 
certainly bursting with the many orders he was given before coming on. He and 
Sterling are playing as wing-backs in Zabaleta’s absence.
 
85 min: Liverpool try to Arsenal their way through the City defensive ranks 
with a series of tippy-tappy passes, before Emre Can decides instead to try and 
hold the ball up in the corner. He’ll do well to keep it there for five or six 
minutes.
 
84 min: Having received five or six minutes’ worth of instruction from Pep 
Guardiola on the touchline, Jesus Navas is finally ready to come on for Pablo 
Zabaleta. City are just waiting for a break in play.
 
83 min: Milner’s flat delivery is flicked on by Mane, towards Dejan Lovren. 
City clear before he can control the ball or bring it down.
 
82 min: Plenty of huff and puff from both teams in the middle third, but 
neither is able to find the killer pass that might help carve out an opening.
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win a corner, which 
Milner is no rush to take.
 
79 min: Manchester City win another corner after good work around the edge of 
the area from Sterling, Silva and De Bruyne. The Belgian sends the ball high 
into the area, where Firmino heads the ball back towards his own goal before 
it’s whacked down the park.
 
78 min: Can mis-kicks a clearance, prompting Lallana to hoof the ball up the 
pitch.
 
77 min: Raheem Sterling sends a cross into the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area from the left, 
but Ragnar Klavan hacks clear.
 
75 min: Craig Pawson books Emre Can for a foul on Raheem Sterling as both 
teams continue to give the ball away repeatedly. Divock Origi just blew a great 
chance to put Sadio Mane through on goal with a woeful “through”-ball that went 
straight to the feet of a defender. This may have been billed as a potential 
classic, but it certainly hasn’t been one.
 
73 min: Firmino tries to play James Milner in on the overlap, but Yaya Toure 
puts a stop to his gallop.
 
72 min: Claudio Bravo clears for City under pressure from Sadio Mane.
 
71 min: Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> 
win a corner and Milner hacks the inswinger clear at the second time of asking.
 
70 min: Origi wins a corner for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> off John Stones. James Milner 
sends the ball into the penalty area, where Fernandinho - or was it John 
Stones? - clears. It’s difficult to tell as the pair look so alike.
 
67 min: Raheem Sterling cuts inside from the right flank, jinking past Lallana 
before failing to get past James Milner.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> certainly seem to think 
Sterling failed to keep the ball in play and let it be known in the strongest 
possible terms that their side should have had a throw-in.
 
66 min: With Henderson gone, Adam Lallana has dropped back into Liverpool’s 
midfield three, with Origi having taken up position on the right side of the 
front three.
 
65 min: Manchester City win a free-kick outside the Liverpool penalty area, 
well right of centre. It’s played short, they lose the ball andLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> set off on the counter-attack 
that breaks down when Sadio Mane plays a poor pass to Firmino.
 
63 min: In his technical area, Pep Guardiola is giving a masterclass in 
largely incomprehensible gesticulation that suggests he might have a future on 
Strictly Come Dancing if the football doesn’t work out for him. In the other 
technical area, Jurgen Klopp attempts to whip up some enthusiasm from the home 
crowd.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> substitution: 
Jordan Henderson off with some sort of knock, Divock Origi on.
 
62 min: Poor play from both teams as they repeatedly give the ball away top 
opposition players as if it’s a live grenade. 
 
59 min: Somebody seems to have flicked a switch for City, who have improved 
immeasurably in the past few minutes. They win a corner, which is sent towards 
Kolarov on the edge of the penalty area. He leathers it on the fly with his 
left foot, but his shot takes a deflection and Mignolet gathers comfortably.
 
57 min: Yaya Toure picks out Raheem Sterling with a wonderful pass from deep. 
Darting down the inside right channel, the winger stretches every sinew in a 
bid to hook the ball across the penalty area, but his diminutive stature means 
he finds the side-netting from a very tight angle.
 
56 min: More signs of life from City, as David Silva picks up the ball, cuts 
in from the right and tries to curl a shot inside the far upright. It fizzes 
narrowly wide, but not by much. Good effort.
 
55 min: City get the ball forward again and the boos reveal Raheem Sterling to 
be in possession on the right flank. James Milner gets across to relieve him of 
possession.
 
54 min: Sergio Aguero finally gets a shot on goal, but his effort from 
distance doesn’t trouble Simon Mignolet. That’s City’s first shot on target.
 
52 min: City are struggling badly to get the ball out of their own half, while 
Kevin De Bruyne is loitering way behind the play waiting forLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> to lose possession so he can 
be in a decent position when City attack on the break. It ain’t happening for 
him at the moment, so he might be advised to get nearer the action and seek out 
the ball.
 
51 min: Liverpool continue to dominate possession, but aren’t doing a great 
deal with it. They win another throw-in deep in City territory, but nothing 
comes of it.
 
49 min: Liverpool win a throw-in deep in City territory after Toure puts the 
ball out while intercepting a Wijnaldum pass to Lallana. No sign of any 
improvement from City in these early stages of the second half.
 
48 min: There’s a little bit of handbags between Pablo Zabaleta and Adam 
Lallana, with the former appearing very agitated indeed over some perceived 
slight. The ref has a word with both and peace resumes.
 
47 min: Unmarked in the City penalty area, Nathaniel Clyne is unable to 
control a dropping ball properly and fails to get a shot off in a wonderful 
position. He was left completely unattended by Kevin De Bruyne.
 
46 min: No changes in personnel on either side, but Kevin De Bruyne and David 
Silva have swapped positions in the City ranks. Silva is in behind Aguero, with 
De Bruyne moving out to the left.
 
46 min: Liverpool get the ball rolling, playing into the Kop in the second 
half of their final game of 2016. It’s gone well for them so far against a 
strangely subduedManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, who will need to up 
their game considerably if they’re to turn things around.
 
45+1 min: Referee Craig Pawson signals for the break after one minute of added 
time and Liverpool go in a Georginio Wijnaldum goal to the good. It’s been 
anything but a classic, butManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have themselves to blame 
for that. Since conceding an early goal, they’ve been contained easily by 
Liverpool and have failed to register a single shot on target. Sterling, De 
Bruyne, Silva and Aguero have all ben starved off possession in a first half 
dominated throughout by the hosts.
 
45 min: Kevin De Bruyne pounces on a sloppy pass and has a shot deflected wide 
for a corner. Nothing comes of it.
 
44 min: Yaya Toure loses possession in the centre-circle and Roberto Firmino 
and Adam Lallana break towards the City goal. Firmino releases Lallana into 
space with only Bravo to beat, but theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> man is flagged for offside. 
Firmino needed to be a little quicker there.
 
42 min: Kevin De Bruyne gets on the ball and charges forward making ground 
before unleashing a shot from the edge of the box. His effort is scuffed but 
takes a deflection and almost falls into the path of Sergio Aguero before 
rolling out for a corner.
 
40 min: Nicolas Otamendi plays the ball forward to Silva in a pocket of space 
in theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> right-back 
area. He’s immediately harried by Nathaniel Clyne and passes the ball out of 
play.
 
39 min: Sterling and Silva finally exchange passes around the edge of the 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area and the 
Spaniard tees up Kolarov for a shot. He doesn’t make proper contact and sends 
his effort wide.
 
38 min: Sterling receives the ball on the edge of the final third but is 
immediately harried and prods the ball out of play for aLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> throw-in. I’m not sure what 
Pep Guardiola is going to do here, but he needs to start thinking about a spot 
of tinkering.
 
37 min: Sterling plays the ball into the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> penalty area for Fernandinho 
to chase, but Ragnar Klavan is on hand to tussle for the ball.
 
35 min: Raheem Sterling gets on the ball near the halfway line, but is forced 
back and once again the ball finds its way back to Bravo. He plays it short to 
Otamendi, who is immediately put under pressure and wellies the ball long and 
out of play. City are really poor this evening, but only their hod-carriers and 
water-carriers are getting any time to settle on the ball and they keep giving 
it away.
 
33 min: Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> 
win a free-kick on the halfway line and three passes later, the ball finds its 
way back to Claudio Bravo. Impressive pressing by Liverpool, who are resolute 
in their efforts to ensure City’s better players don’t get a sniff of the ball. 
City, it should be noted, are doing themselves few favours as they continue to 
lose possession.
