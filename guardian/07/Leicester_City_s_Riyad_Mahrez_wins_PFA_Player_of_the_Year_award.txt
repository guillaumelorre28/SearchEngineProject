The Tottenham Hotspur <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> 
midfielder Dele Alli, a highly impressive performer in his first top-flight 
season, took the Young Player of the Year award. Manchester City’s Izzy 
Christiansen was named Women’s Player of the Year while Beth Mead, of 
Sunderland Ladies, won the Women’s Young Player of the Year award. Ryan Giggs, 
who won both of the major men’s gongs during his playing career, completed a 
rare hat-trick with the PFA Merit Award.

Mahrez has had a stunning campaign with the Foxes, scoring 17 goals and 
providing 11 assists. The Algerian international’s most recent contribution 
came with the opening goalin the 4-0 win over Swansea City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/24/leicester-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report>
 hours before the awards event, which Leicester’s contingent attended in London 
via helicopter.

Mahrez said his Leicester team-mates deserved to take the plaudits for his 
success. “All the credit is for them, seriously,” he said. “And my manager and 
the staff. Without them I wouldn’t receive this award and I wouldn’t score. 
It’s the team spirit. I want to dedicate it to them.

“I’m very grateful to receive this award, it’s a pleasure. It’s extra special 
because, if the players vote for me, it’s because they’ve seen I’ve been great 
this year so I’m happy.”

After signing from the French second-tier side Le Havre in January 2014 Mahrez 
made a steady rather than spectacular start to life in England but featured 
prominently in Leicester’s escape from relegation last season and began 2015-16 
with two goalsin the 4-2 victory against Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/08/leicester-city-sunderland-premier-league-match-report>
. Neither player nor club has looked back since, with Leicester now five points 
from an historic title and Mahrez having shone throughout.

Ossie Ardiles, the former Tottenham midfielder, collected Alli’s award on 
behalf of the 20-year-old – who did not attend the ceremony at Grosvenor House 
Hotel due to the proximity of Monday night’s home match against West Bromwich 
Albion.

“Thank you Ossie, the Tottenham legend, for receiving this award for me,” Alli 
said in a video message. “I feel honoured to win such a prestigious award and 
thank you to my friends, family and all the staff at Tottenham.”

Alli’s award came with some mild embarrassment for Tottenham, who had 
dedicated an article in Monday’s matchday programme to his achievement. The 
piece appeared to have been leaked online earlier on Sunday, which was hardly 
the ideal scenario, given that news of the winners is strictly embargoed.

Christiansen, the 24-year-old forward, won her first senior England cap last 
September, scoring on her debut against Estonia. She has been in superb form 
for her club and the same is true of the prodigious striker Mead, who was the 
top scorer in Women’s Super League One last season with 12 goals from 14 games.

Giggs became the latest Manchester United stalwart to be given the merit 
award, following in the footsteps of Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Matt Busby and Sir 
Bobby Charlton. The honour is given for “meritorious service to English 
football” and Giggs, who was named player of the year in 2009 and young player 
of the year in 1992 and 1993, expressed his delight at completing the clean 
sweep.

“I’m chuffed to have won all three awards. The young player was a long time 
ago and then the player award was a big surprise,” Giggs said.

“This is the culmination of around 25 years since my debut, so it’s a credit 
to myself, my team-mates, staff, family and friends. When you win each award 
you look down the trophy and you see the players who have won it before and you 
realise what a great accolade it is.

“This is the same. I’ve been here on the nights when people have won it and 
it’s legends of the game. I’m fortunate to win it and I’ll enjoy it.”

Now assistant manager to Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, Giggs said that 
enjoyment was the key to a playing career that brought up a club record 963 
appearances and 64 caps for Wales.

“What Sir Alex always used to say was enjoy it. It was the last thing he said 
when you went out and played,” Giggs said.

“Everything that comes with that obviously – improve every day, practise, 
listen, dedicate yourself – but most of all enjoy your football. That went for 
playing when I was 17 until when I was 40. It was a privilege to play at Old 
Trafford and I tried to enjoy it.”
