Rory Carroll in Washington DC has a wrap of today’s meet and greet between 
Barack Obama and Pope Francis <>:

In a rare departure from protocol, the president, vice-president and their 
families turned up to greet the pontiff, underlining the huge expectations for 
a historic visit which will include talks at the White House and addresses to 
Congress, the United Nations and vast crowds in Washington, New York and 
Philadelphia.

The US and Vatican flags fluttered from the cockpit as the papal plane taxied 
to a halt where an honour guard, dignitaries, clerics and schoolchildren 
waited. A high school band had set the mood earlier with a rendition of 
Pharrell Williams’ Happy.

The 78-year-old Catholic leader smiled broadly as he touched US soil for the 
first time – and promptly received his first taste of US informality in the 
form of chants of “Francisco” and “Hey hey, ho ho, welcome to the USA!”

After a busy day of travel from the US to Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba>, Pope Francis’s schedule is clear for 
the rest of the evening as he prepares for five more days in the US. We’re 
wrapping up day four of our nine-day live blog coverage of the pontiff’s trip, 
but here are some highlights from Tuesday:

 * At a press conference in Washington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601dbcde4b0ae9eeb188146>
, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Francis will definitely address 
migration and the environment in speeches beforean occasionally climate-denying 
US Congress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/us-congress-climate-change-denial-republicans-pope-francis-address>
 and the United Nations because they are both “fundamental issues”. 
 * Upon landing in DC, reporters onboard the papal flight shared several key 
updates: Franciswas asked specifically about claims that he is a communist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601b320e4b0da121189d914>
. “Maybe I have given an impression of being a little bit to the left,” the 
pope said. “But if they want me to recite the Creed, I can!” 
 * Francis denied having any knowledge about Cuban dissidents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601b66ae4b0da121189d91f>
 who were arrested ahead of his visit to the country and said he wished he 
could have entered the USthrough Tijuana, Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601bd0de4b0da121189d937>
.

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/fiat-pope-francis-car-washington>
. 
 * In Cuba, Francis blessed Santiago de Cuba before heading to the airport for 
his flight to Washington DC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-56016b65e4b0da121189d808>
. He told the audience thathe feels at home in Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-56017353e4b0ae9eeb188009>
 and encouraged Cubans to care for their grandparents. 
 * The pontiff’s day began in Santiago, where he delivered a homily at the 
village of El Cobre’s Our Lady of Charity church 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-560145f7e4b0da121189d765>
. Francis quoted from a letter, written to Benedict XV (Giacomo della Chiesa) 
by the Cuban people prior his 1916 decision to make the Virgin of Cobre the 
country’s patroness, which said “neither disgrace nor poverty were ever able to 
crush the faith”.

Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that in speaking to Congress (on 
Thursday) and at the UN (on Friday), there remain many issues that Francis will 
obviously address, including the environment and migration.

“This is clear: they are such fundamental questions of the day, that it is not 
possible that the Pope comes and does not speak about them,” Lombardi said.

The Vatican spokespeople claim they still don’t know exactly what Francis will 
say in the halls of power.

Lombardi said he also did not know what the pope said to Barack Obama as they 
walked from the papal plane to their individual motorcades.The Pope rode in a 
Fiat. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/fiat-pope-francis-car-washington>

“Pope Francis has a charisma in the personal encounter with other persons and 
also big political leaders,” Lombardi said at the press conference. “He 
approach the other as a concrete person, not so much as a political leader who 
has a particular ideology.”

“This is something wonderful and very often this is another way to approach 
the big question and solve something,” he said.

Again, Lombardi spoke of the importance of the pope’s encounters with people 
and how he connects with them, not just the content of their interaction. “I 
think this is maybe more important than our agenda of points would indicate,” 
Lombardi said.

The press conference has now ended.

Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi spoke about the decision to have the pope 
travel around Washington DC in a fiat. “It is very easy to recognize where the 
Pope is because he is in the littlest car in the motorcade,” Lombardi said.

The Guardian’s Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner has more on the Fiat:
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/fiat-pope-francis-car-washington>


To see such an important foreign dignitary driving off in a Fiat was so 
unusual that CNN anchor Jake Tapper speculated on live television that there 
“must be” some “bells and whistles” of which the public was not aware. As if the
Fiat <https://www.theguardian.com/business/fiat> had just been passed on to the 
pope from James Bond.

The choice of vehicle may also have reflected Pope Francis’s commitment to 
environmental stewardship. His encyclical on climate change,which will be a 
major focus of his five-day trip to the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/us-congress-climate-change-denial-republicans-pope-francis-address>
 and his speech before the United Nations, is focused on the need to care for 
both the environment and the poor. The politically savvy Vatican would surely 
have wanted to avoid the pope being seen in a gas guzzler.

Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said that the pope’s trips around the 
world are expanding his experience as a “universal pastor”.

“The speech for Congress and UN are interesting because they are from a person 
who has reached great moral authority and is able to interpret the question 
that come from the global mankind and try to give orientation and answers to 
the people of the entire world,” Lombardi said.

Environmental activist Bill McKibben writes for the Guardian about two major 
figures getting involved in the climate change debate:Pope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> and presidential hopeful 
Hillary Clinton.

Today, Clinton announced that she opposes the controversial Keystone XL 
pipeline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton-opposes-keystone-xl-pipeline>
 and Pope Francis has spoke repeatedly about the need to address climate change.

It’s not really divine intervention that moved the former Secretary of State 
(who had originally gamed the State Department review process to approve the 
project). It was hard hard organizing – thousands went to jail, hundreds of 
thousands marched, millions wrote public comments. And that work has gone far 
beyond this one pipeline: its helped turn almost every fossil fuel 
infrastructure project on the planet into a full-on battle.

Bernie Sanders played his part too. He’s made no direct criticism of Hillary, 
but he has pointed out regularly how odd it is she has no position on this key 
issue. As he rose in the polls, her determination to dodge the issue clearly 
wavered.

But the pope did help too: his powerful encyclical last summer is a reminder 
to every politician of exactly which way the wind is now blowing. That wind is 
in the sails of the climate movement now, and so there will be more days like 
this to come. Whether they come in time to slow the planet’s careening new 
physics is an open question, but at last the political and financial climate 
has begun to change almost as fast as the physical one.

From Washington DC, the Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne 
Goldenberg and DC bureau chief Dan Roberts report on how Democrats hope the 
Pope’s visit can tone down climate change deniers in Congress. Republicans, 
meanwhile, are hoping that Francis steers clear of the issue.

Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island, said he believed 
the call to action from a popular pope made it increasingly difficult for 
Republicans to continue to dismiss the science on climate change. “I think this 
whole edifice of climate denial is crumbling,” Whitehouse told the Guardian.

As Pope Francis was taking his first steps on American soil, Hillary Clinton 
broke her lengthy silence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton-opposes-keystone-xl-pipeline>
 on the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, saying she opposed the 
project and did not believe it was in the interests of “what we need to do to 
combat climate change”.

Even before the pope’s indictment of capitalism and climate change 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/popes-climate-change-encyclical-calls-on-rich-nations-to-pay-social-debt>
 in his encyclical in June, Republicans in Congress had been slowly edging away 
from outright climate denial.

Why are some American Catholics a bit cagey (to put things lightly) about Pope 
Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis>? I’d suggest that one 
reason is the enduring popularity of the barnstorming mid-century Catholic 
televangelist, Bishop Fulton Sheen. His televised sermons against communism and 
his books and epigrams on the spiritual life and both still very popular in the 
US and abroad. Here’s a short example:


“Free these people. That’s the first thing that we have to solve in the world 
... no other problem will be solved until we liberate them.”

“Our weakness, really, is that we’re not sure in America that there is any 
truth ... [but] the choice before the world is either brotherhood in Christ, or 
comradeship in antichrist. They have chosen that particular comradeship!”

Throughout the pope’s visit to the US, Sister Simone Campbell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simone-campbell>, executive director of 
national Catholic social justice lobby NETWORK, will be joining our 
minute-by-minute coverage here on the Guardian US live blog.

You might know Sister Simone better as the leader of the so-called “Nuns on 
the Bus” tour that has disrupted American politics with a modern vision of 
Catholicism. Here’s her first dispatch, looking ahead to Francis in Washington, 
where the bus ended a 13-day, 2,000-mile tour:

As we head to DC on the last leg of our two-week bus trip, our excitement is 
mounting. We carry with usthe stories of all of the people we have met 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMdladgsOe-dUizCYWO-Zse-w5ZbiPlGr> 
along our 2000 mileNuns on the Bus <http://www.nunsonthebus.org/> journey. In 
the process, we learned that Pope Francis is correct when he says the realities 
of our people are more important than any theory we can imagine.

We learned of the anguish of racism and the worry of black mothers for the 
safety of their children. Amy told us in St Louis that she quizzes her 10th 
grade and eighth-grade sons about what to do “when” the police stop them. She 
tells them to keep their hands out of their pockets and to do what the police 
tell them.

Her eighth-grader asked her recently, “Mommy, how long will this go on?” She 
had tears in her eyes as she told us she had to tell him: “For the rest of your 
life!” Her testimony broke my heart. Our political leaders must respond to the 
unique challenges confronting communities of color, including white racism 
within our police forces that has led to so much fear and divisions.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> challenges us to 
know that we are all connected and need to act as brothers and sisters to each 
other.

 I carry with me 15-year-old Katherine and her five siblings struggling here 
in the U.S. after their parents were deported when they went to pay a traffic 
ticket. Our broken immigration system is tearing families apart.

In fact, it is so bad that Katherine’s 12-year-old sister Stephanie attempted 
suicide in the aftermath of her pain. She seemed to think that it would be 
better if there were one less to worry about. I come back from this trip with a 
renewed commitment to changing our broken immigration system.

In the United States we exploit undocumented immigrant labor and then act 
sanctimonious about how “they broke the law!”

Pope Francis calls us to welcome the stranger and care for our families. He 
says that there are no borders on God’s love.

I also carry with me the joyful news that innovative work is being done in 
every city we visited. I celebrate the interfaith organizing that is happening 
in Evansville, Indiana. Nashville, Tennessee is the home of the first Magdalen 
House and Thistle Farms where formerly incarcerated and addicted women are 
finding new life in recovery. They are running a for-profit business that is 
healing our planet and healing the community.

In Little Rock, Arkansas, the low-income blighted neighborhood is banding 
together to plant flowers and vegetables to beautify their community and grow 
hope.

In Wheeling, West Virginia, Grow Ohio Valley was started by energetic folks 
who want to bridge the divide between their neighbors and fresh food. Their 
“framers market truck” takes fresh food into all sorts of communities.

At every turn on our tour we embraced heartbreak and hope. I realize that this 
is the message of Pope Francis. Know the struggle of our neighbors. Let our 
hearts be broken open. Then we have room for everyone in our lives and the new 
will burst forth. This is the essence of joy and our experience on the bus. We 
Nuns on the Bus celebrate our pilgrimage and the arrival of Pope Francis. May 
these few days of his visit help our nation renew our founding principles so 
that “We the People” will once again come together to work for the common good.

Rory Carroll

The Guardian’s Rory Carroll <https://twitter.com/rorycarroll72> filed this 
dispatch from Washington DC:

Bishop Christopher Coyne, the incoming director of the communications 
committee of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, told me that liberals and 
conservatives who expect Francis to promote their agendas will likely end up 
frustrated.

“There will be disappointment. He’s not a politician. He’s a leader of a faith 
and will say things that are challenging to people across all sectors of life.”

Some of that expectation, said Coyne, stemmed from over-eager extrapolation of 
Francis’s famous “who am I to judge?” comment, which was a response to a narrow 
question about an allegedly gay staffer in the Vatican.

The bishop reckoned Francis will avoid explicit forays into hotbutton 
political topics. “I’d be very surprised if he were to insert himself into the 
more particular issues of our country. But you never know. He’s a man of strong 
opinions who often surprises us with them.”

Coyne was speaking from the papal media filing room in the bowels of the 
Marriott Marquis hotel in Washington.


Francis, he added, would stick mainly to Spanish because of limited English. 
“He took three months of English in Dublin in 1980.” Asked if that meant a pope 
with an Irish accent, he smiled. “We’ll see.”


Fr Manuel Dorantes, another clerical media point man, said he had been 
swotting up on Argentine Spanish, a version very different from his own Mexican 
Spanish. “The accent and expressions are really something.”

More from my colleague Angela Bruno: 

Telemundo have tweeted a report from correspondent Rogelio Mora-Tagle, who 
traveled fromCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> with Francisco.

According to the Spanish language network, the pope wanted to enter the United 
States via Tijuana, Mexico – as do many undocumented immigrants.

The Pope has been a vocal advocate for migrant rights, and many of the 
activist groups that have traveled to Washington DC for his visit are there to 
draw attention to the cause of immigration reform.


In this Guardian piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/us-progressives-hope-pope-francis-can-bring-moral-force-to-key-issues>
 on the progressive groups hoping to use Pope Francis’ visit as a platform to 
raise awareness, Ed Pilkington writes:

“Pro-immigration groups see the pope’s arrival as a possible balm for the 
wounds of America’s Hispanic communities amid the increasingly shrill
anti-immigration rhetoric 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-saying-illegal-immigrants-have-to-go-targets-obama-orders-1439738967>
 coming from Republican presidential candidates.

As Maribel Hastings of America’s Voice put it 
<http://americasvoice.org/aves_politics/el-obispo-de-roma-en-espera-de-un-milagro/>
, writing in Spanish: “Millions of undocumented people see in the pope a 
defender and intermediary who can change hearts.”

(Mora-Tagle also took advantage of his time on the papal plane to give his 
Emmy to the pope <https://twitter.com/lcvelez/status/645911070029291520>. What 
the pontiff made of that gift has not been reported.)

Rory Carroll in Washington DC has a wrap of today’s meet and greet between 
Barack Obama and Pope Francis <>:

In a rare departure from protocol, the president, vice-president and their 
families turned up to greet the pontiff, underlining the huge expectations for 
a historic visit which will include talks at the White House and addresses to 
Congress, the United Nations and vast crowds in Washington, New York and 
Philadelphia.

The US and Vatican flags fluttered from the cockpit as the papal plane taxied 
to a halt where an honour guard, dignitaries, clerics and schoolchildren 
waited. A high school band had set the mood earlier with a rendition of 
Pharrell Williams’ Happy.

The 78-year-old Catholic leader smiled broadly as he touched US soil for the 
first time – and promptly received his first taste of US informality in the 
form of chants of “Francisco” and “Hey hey, ho ho, welcome to the USA!”

After a busy day of travel from the US to Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba>, Pope Francis’s schedule is clear for 
the rest of the evening as he prepares for five more days in the US. We’re 
wrapping up day four of our nine-day live blog coverage of the pontiff’s trip, 
but here are some highlights from Tuesday:

 * At a press conference in Washington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601dbcde4b0ae9eeb188146>
, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Francis will definitely address 
migration and the environment in speeches beforean occasionally climate-denying 
US Congress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/us-congress-climate-change-denial-republicans-pope-francis-address>
 and the United Nations because they are both “fundamental issues”. 
 * Upon landing in DC, reporters onboard the papal flight shared several key 
updates: Franciswas asked specifically about claims that he is a communist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601b320e4b0da121189d914>
. “Maybe I have given an impression of being a little bit to the left,” the 
pope said. “But if they want me to recite the Creed, I can!” 
 * Francis denied having any knowledge about Cuban dissidents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601b66ae4b0da121189d91f>
 who were arrested ahead of his visit to the country and said he wished he 
could have entered the USthrough Tijuana, Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601bd0de4b0da121189d937>
. 
 * The pope was greeted by Barack Obama and his family at Andrews Air Force 
Base outside of Washington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601a3bee4b0da121189d8df>
. After shaking hands withMichelle, Sasha and Malia Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-5601b54ce4b0ae9eeb1880f8>
, Francis spoke with Obama, thentook off in a Fiat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/fiat-pope-francis-car-washington>
. 
 * In Cuba, Francis blessed Santiago de Cuba before heading to the airport for 
his flight to Washington DC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-56016b65e4b0da121189d808>
. He told the audience thathe feels at home in Cuba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-56017353e4b0ae9eeb188009>
 and encouraged Cubans to care for their grandparents. 
 * The pontiff’s day began in Santiago, where he delivered a homily at the 
village of El Cobre’s Our Lady of Charity church 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-journeys-to-washington-dc-to-begin-historic-us-visit-live-updates#block-560145f7e4b0da121189d765>
. Francis quoted from a letter, written to Benedict XV (Giacomo della Chiesa) 
by the Cuban people prior his 1916 decision to make the Virgin of Cobre the 
country’s patroness, which said “neither disgrace nor poverty were ever able to 
crush the faith”. 
And ahead of a busy Wednesday in Washington, from the White House to the 
national mall to a controversial canonisation, here are10 things to watch 
during Pope Francis’s trip to the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/pope-francis-10-things-to-look-out-for>
.
 
Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that in speaking to Congress (on 
Thursday) and at the UN (on Friday), there remain many issues that Francis will 
obviously address, including the environment and migration.

“This is clear: they are such fundamental questions of the day, that it is not 
possible that the Pope comes and does not speak about them,” Lombardi said.

The Vatican spokespeople claim they still don’t know exactly what Francis will 
say in the halls of power.

Lombardi said he also did not know what the pope said to Barack Obama as they 
walked from the papal plane to their individual motorcades.The Pope rode in a 
Fiat. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/fiat-pope-francis-car-washington>

“Pope Francis has a charisma in the personal encounter with other persons and 
also big political leaders,” Lombardi said at the press conference. “He 
approach the other as a concrete person, not so much as a political leader who 
has a particular ideology.”

“This is something wonderful and very often this is another way to approach 
the big question and solve something,” he said.

Again, Lombardi spoke of the importance of the pope’s encounters with people 
and how he connects with them, not just the content of their interaction. “I 
think this is maybe more important than our agenda of points would indicate,” 
Lombardi said.

The press conference has now ended. 
 
There are no plans for Pope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> on the official schedule for 
tonight, but tomorrow, he will visit the White House, pray with bishops at St 
Matthew’s Cathedral and canonize Junipero Serra.

Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi spoke about the decision to have the pope 
travel around Washington DC in a fiat. “It is very easy to recognize where the 
Pope is because he is in the littlest car in the motorcade,” Lombardi said.

The Guardian’s Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner has more on the Fiat:
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/fiat-pope-francis-car-washington>


To see such an important foreign dignitary driving off in a Fiat was so 
unusual that CNN anchor Jake Tapper speculated on live television that there 
“must be” some “bells and whistles” of which the public was not aware. As if the
Fiat <https://www.theguardian.com/business/fiat> had just been passed on to the 
pope from James Bond.

The choice of vehicle may also have reflected Pope Francis’s commitment to 
environmental stewardship. His encyclical on climate change,which will be a 
major focus of his five-day trip to the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/us-congress-climate-change-denial-republicans-pope-francis-address>
 and his speech before the United Nations, is focused on the need to care for 
both the environment and the poor. The politically savvy Vatican would surely 
have wanted to avoid the pope being seen in a gas guzzler.

Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said that the pope’s trips around the 
world are expanding his experience as a “universal pastor”.

“The speech for Congress and UN are interesting because they are from a person 
who has reached great moral authority and is able to interpret the question 
that come from the global mankind and try to give orientation and answers to 
the people of the entire world,” Lombardi said.

Environmental activist Bill McKibben writes for the Guardian about two major 
figures getting involved in the climate change debate:Pope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> and presidential hopeful 
Hillary Clinton.

Today, Clinton announced that she opposes the controversial Keystone XL 
pipeline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton-opposes-keystone-xl-pipeline>
 and Pope Francis has spoke repeatedly about the need to address climate change.

It’s not really divine intervention that moved the former Secretary of State 
(who had originally gamed the State Department review process to approve the 
project). It was hard hard organizing – thousands went to jail, hundreds of 
thousands marched, millions wrote public comments. And that work has gone far 
beyond this one pipeline: its helped turn almost every fossil fuel 
infrastructure project on the planet into a full-on battle.

Bernie Sanders played his part too. He’s made no direct criticism of Hillary, 
but he has pointed out regularly how odd it is she has no position on this key 
issue. As he rose in the polls, her determination to dodge the issue clearly 
wavered.

But the pope did help too: his powerful encyclical last summer is a reminder 
to every politician of exactly which way the wind is now blowing. That wind is 
in the sails of the climate movement now, and so there will be more days like 
this to come. Whether they come in time to slow the planet’s careening new 
physics is an open question, but at last the political and financial climate 
has begun to change almost as fast as the physical one.
 
From Washington DC, the Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne 
Goldenberg and DC bureau chief Dan Roberts report on how Democrats hope the 
Pope’s visit can tone down climate change deniers in Congress. Republicans, 
meanwhile, are hoping that Francis steers clear of the issue.

Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island, said he believed 
the call to action from a popular pope made it increasingly difficult for 
Republicans to continue to dismiss the science on climate change. “I think this 
whole edifice of climate denial is crumbling,” Whitehouse told the Guardian.

As Pope Francis was taking his first steps on American soil, Hillary Clinton 
broke her lengthy silence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton-opposes-keystone-xl-pipeline>
 on the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, saying she opposed the 
project and did not believe it was in the interests of “what we need to do to 
combat climate change”.

Even before the pope’s indictment of capitalism and climate change 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/popes-climate-change-encyclical-calls-on-rich-nations-to-pay-social-debt>
 in his encyclical in June, Republicans in Congress had been slowly edging away 
from outright climate denial.

Why are some American Catholics a bit cagey (to put things lightly) about Pope 
Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis>? I’d suggest that one 
reason is the enduring popularity of the barnstorming mid-century Catholic 
televangelist, Bishop Fulton Sheen. His televised sermons against communism and 
his books and epigrams on the spiritual life and both still very popular in the 
US and abroad. Here’s a short example:


“Free these people. That’s the first thing that we have to solve in the world 
... no other problem will be solved until we liberate them.”

“Our weakness, really, is that we’re not sure in America that there is any 
truth ... [but] the choice before the world is either brotherhood in Christ, or 
comradeship in antichrist. They have chosen that particular comradeship!”

Throughout the pope’s visit to the US, Sister Simone Campbell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simone-campbell>, executive director of 
national Catholic social justice lobby NETWORK, will be joining our 
minute-by-minute coverage here on the Guardian US live blog.

You might know Sister Simone better as the leader of the so-called “Nuns on 
the Bus” tour that has disrupted American politics with a modern vision of 
Catholicism. Here’s her first dispatch, looking ahead to Francis in Washington, 
where the bus ended a 13-day, 2,000-mile tour:

As we head to DC on the last leg of our two-week bus trip, our excitement is 
mounting. We carry with usthe stories of all of the people we have met 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMdladgsOe-dUizCYWO-Zse-w5ZbiPlGr> 
along our 2000 mileNuns on the Bus <http://www.nunsonthebus.org/> journey. In 
the process, we learned that Pope Francis is correct when he says the realities 
of our people are more important than any theory we can imagine.

We learned of the anguish of racism and the worry of black mothers for the 
safety of their children. Amy told us in St Louis that she quizzes her 10th 
grade and eighth-grade sons about what to do “when” the police stop them. She 
tells them to keep their hands out of their pockets and to do what the police 
tell them.

Her eighth-grader asked her recently, “Mommy, how long will this go on?” She 
had tears in her eyes as she told us she had to tell him: “For the rest of your 
life!” Her testimony broke my heart. Our political leaders must respond to the 
unique challenges confronting communities of color, including white racism 
within our police forces that has led to so much fear and divisions.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> challenges us to 
know that we are all connected and need to act as brothers and sisters to each 
other.

 I carry with me 15-year-old Katherine and her five siblings struggling here 
in the U.S. after their parents were deported when they went to pay a traffic 
ticket. Our broken immigration system is tearing families apart.

In fact, it is so bad that Katherine’s 12-year-old sister Stephanie attempted 
suicide in the aftermath of her pain. She seemed to think that it would be 
better if there were one less to worry about. I come back from this trip with a 
renewed commitment to changing our broken immigration system.

In the United States we exploit undocumented immigrant labor and then act 
sanctimonious about how “they broke the law!”

Pope Francis calls us to welcome the stranger and care for our families. He 
says that there are no borders on God’s love.

I also carry with me the joyful news that innovative work is being done in 
every city we visited. I celebrate the interfaith organizing that is happening 
in Evansville, Indiana. Nashville, Tennessee is the home of the first Magdalen 
House and Thistle Farms where formerly incarcerated and addicted women are 
finding new life in recovery. They are running a for-profit business that is 
healing our planet and healing the community.

In Little Rock, Arkansas, the low-income blighted neighborhood is banding 
together to plant flowers and vegetables to beautify their community and grow 
hope.

In Wheeling, West Virginia, Grow Ohio Valley was started by energetic folks 
who want to bridge the divide between their neighbors and fresh food. Their 
“framers market truck” takes fresh food into all sorts of communities.

At every turn on our tour we embraced heartbreak and hope. I realize that this 
is the message of Pope Francis. Know the struggle of our neighbors. Let our 
hearts be broken open. Then we have room for everyone in our lives and the new 
will burst forth. This is the essence of joy and our experience on the bus. We 
Nuns on the Bus celebrate our pilgrimage and the arrival of Pope Francis. May 
these few days of his visit help our nation renew our founding principles so 
that “We the People” will once again come together to work for the common good.
 
The Guardian’s Rory Carroll <https://twitter.com/rorycarroll72> filed this 
dispatch from Washington DC:

Bishop Christopher Coyne, the incoming director of the communications 
committee of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, told me that liberals and 
conservatives who expect Francis to promote their agendas will likely end up 
frustrated.

“There will be disappointment. He’s not a politician. He’s a leader of a faith 
and will say things that are challenging to people across all sectors of life.”

Some of that expectation, said Coyne, stemmed from over-eager extrapolation of 
Francis’s famous “who am I to judge?” comment, which was a response to a narrow 
question about an allegedly gay staffer in the Vatican.

The bishop reckoned Francis will avoid explicit forays into hotbutton 
political topics. “I’d be very surprised if he were to insert himself into the 
more particular issues of our country. But you never know. He’s a man of strong 
opinions who often surprises us with them.”

Coyne was speaking from the papal media filing room in the bowels of the 
Marriott Marquis hotel in Washington.


Francis, he added, would stick mainly to Spanish because of limited English. 
“He took three months of English in Dublin in 1980.” Asked if that meant a pope 
with an Irish accent, he smiled. “We’ll see.”


Fr Manuel Dorantes, another clerical media point man, said he had been 
swotting up on Argentine Spanish, a version very different from his own Mexican 
Spanish. “The accent and expressions are really something.”
 
More from my colleague Angela Bruno: 

Telemundo have tweeted a report from correspondent Rogelio Mora-Tagle, who 
traveled fromCuba <https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba> with Francisco.

According to the Spanish language network, the pope wanted to enter the United 
States via Tijuana, Mexico – as do many undocumented immigrants.

The Pope has been a vocal advocate for migrant rights, and many of the 
activist groups that have traveled to Washington DC for his visit are there to 
draw attention to the cause of immigration reform.


In this Guardian piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/us-progressives-hope-pope-francis-can-bring-moral-force-to-key-issues>
 on the progressive groups hoping to use Pope Francis’ visit as a platform to 
raise awareness, Ed Pilkington writes:

“Pro-immigration groups see the pope’s arrival as a possible balm for the 
wounds of America’s Hispanic communities amid the increasingly shrill
anti-immigration rhetoric 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-saying-illegal-immigrants-have-to-go-targets-obama-orders-1439738967>
 coming from Republican presidential candidates.

As Maribel Hastings of America’s Voice put it 
<http://americasvoice.org/aves_politics/el-obispo-de-roma-en-espera-de-un-milagro/>
, writing in Spanish: “Millions of undocumented people see in the pope a 
defender and intermediary who can change hearts.”

(Mora-Tagle also took advantage of his time on the papal plane to give his 
Emmy to the pope <https://twitter.com/lcvelez/status/645911070029291520>. What 
the pontiff made of that gift has not been reported.)
