Some late news from Zurich, where the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) 
has been suspended immediately byFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> due to government interference in 
the country’s national league. Indonesia will now not be eligible to compete in 
the next round of qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup and 2019 Asian Cup, 
starting in less than two weeks’ time.

This decision resulted from the effective ‘takeover’ of the activities of PSSI 
by the Indonesian authorities. However, and as an exceptional measure, the 
national team would be allowed to continue their current participation in the 
2015 Southeast Asian Games.

Ah yes, the inevitable bookmaker’s press release on Blatter’s standing and 
whether he’ll see out the next four years as president. I wouldn’t wager 
against it, let’s put it that way. Anyway, William Hill offer the following:

Will Sepp Blatter <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sepp-blatter> see out 
his current term:2-5 yes; 7-4 no.

Will Blatter leave as president of Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> before the end of the year: 5-1 
yes; 1-9 no.

Blatter to win the next election: 5-2 yes; 2-7 no.

Which Fifa sponsor will withdraw their sponsorship first: Evs Visa; 3-1 Coca 
Cola; 4-1 Adidas; 6-1 McDonald’s; 9-1 Budweiser; 10-1 Hyundai; 16-1 Gazprom.

Jana Kasperkevic writes why businesses still need Fifa. One word: money 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/why-businesses-still-need-fifa-sponsorship>
.

High profile World Cup sponsors including Coca Cola have called for action, 
Visa even hinted it might terminate its sponsorship if the rot is not stopped. 
Yet according to the former head of communication for Visa’s Global 
sponsorships Andrew Woodward, the company should not do it.

“To those contemplating dumping the sponsorship, I ask: ARE YOU MAD? The Fifa 
World Cup is the most popular sporting event in the world. People love it. They 
don’t care about the corruption,”Woodward wrote in a blog post 
<http://mumbrella.com.au/fifa-is-in-crisis-but-youd-be-mad-to-give-up-a-sponsorship-296610>
.

Sepp Blatter re-elected as Fifa president after Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein 
concedes defeat <>Sepp Blatter gained 133 votes to Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein’s 
73 in the first round of voting, not enough to secure a two-thirds majority, 
but the challenger conceded defeatRead more

So far, the sponsors have hedged their bets stating that they are monitoring 
the situation. Visa has gone as far as to say that ifFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> doesn’t change, it would “reassess 
our sponsorship”. The reason Visa is pushing harded this time around is that it 
is an American, conservative financial company and its partner is being accused 
of corruption, Woodward told the Guardian. Still, he said, its unlikely that 
the company will terminate its sponsorship, considering that since 2008 it has 
probably invested close to a $1bn in sponsorship and licensing fees.

“The sponsors aren’t supporting Fifa. The sponsors are supporting the Fifa 
World Cup as a means by which to reach consumers,” he said, adding that 
investing in World Cup “is not a vote of confidence in Fifa, that’s a means by 
which to reach this sort of a consumer in a certain way.” The sponsors might 
need Fifa more than Fifa needs them.

From our US office, DJ Gallo writes – to a USA! USA! USA! soundtrack – about 
this week’s battles between Team America and Fifa, and wonders:did the US 
accidentally make itself popular 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/30/team-america-v-fifa-did-the-us-accidentally-make-itself-popular>
?

While the rest of the world has been busy enjoying the beautiful game, mostly 
ignoring the ugly corruption in the sport’s governing body as long as there was 
good soccer to watch, US authorities were unraveling a 24-year scheme of bribes 
and self-enrichment. Fifa’s grafters probably thought the US was too dumb to 
take them down. I mean, just three years after the corruption allegedly began,
US Soccer willingly wore denim uniforms in public 
<http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_spot/2014/05/19/u_s_soccer_denim_kit_the_horrifying_true_story_of_the_ugliest_jerseys_in.html>
. That seems pretty dumb. But just add that to Fifa’s list of humiliations: 
they’ve been done in by blue jeans-wearing cowboys who think a “football” is an 
oblong ball best carried or thrown through the air.

America’s return to international awesomeness didn’t stop with spiking the 
football on Fifa. As an extra favor to the world, we also pissed off Vladimir 
Putin. The President of Russia and King of Shirtless Horse Riding said, via the
Kremlin’s website <http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/49546>: “These 
officers are not United States’ citizens, and if anything did happen, it did 
not happen on the territory of the United States and the USA have nothing to do 
with it. This is yet another obvious attempt to spread their jurisdiction to 
other states.”

Getting Putin of all people to whine about international overreach? That’s 
icing on America’s delicious, high fructose corn syrup-infused cake. Russian 
state media followed Putin’s lead by creating TV graphics suggesting crazed 
American bald eagles are hell-bent on destroying soccer– and possibly the world.

To summarise, then

No surprises from that Blatter display, with the usual mixture of 
self-promotion, sniping and straight batting in the face of his interrogation, 
primarily from the western media. Some of the key points re: Blatter:

 * The Fifa president reiterates that he is the best person to lead Fifa, 
saying: “It is very easy, you have seen the results of the Congress and they 
think that I am still the man to solve these problems.” 
 * Denies any knowledge of a $10m bribe to Jack Warner detailed in FBI 
indictment. 
 * Asked if he fears the ongoing investigation from US authorities: “I have no 
concerns. I especially have no concerns about my person.” 
 * Claims that Fifa, under his stewardship, has taken a tough stance on 
corrupt individuals: “If you go backwards, you will see how many members have 
left Fifa, either by themselves or they have been investigated by our 
committees.” 
 * And declares that he will pay a personal visit to sponsors and reassure 
them in the wake of the past week’s events.  Blatter pauses during the press 
conference. Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters

Final question, then, and Blatter is interrogated as to why he has failed to 
take action against a number of corrupt officials. He launches into a 
pre-planned speech, discussing Uefa, his transparent innocence and even a barb 
at David Gill:
Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
He's back onto another familiar riff - blaming Uefa for reform agenda being 
watered down.

We're in Ministry of Truth territory - loads of our people have been caught 
for dodgy behavior, therefore we're not corrupt.

Ends with a pop at Gill: "You can't take responsibility when you are elected 
and don't come to the first meeting."

We will be more communicative in future, and we will give more information.

Jérôme Valcke says we’re down to the last two questions. First up, Blatter 
asked if he worries about sponsors:

We have already had contact with the sponsors after the revelations … we have 
exchanged letters … and the contact with our partners, I am sure I will bring 
them all back with a personal visit to them.

Owen Gibson then asks Blatter directly about the culture of Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> and his tenure being mired by 
corruption, and whether he has fostered this:

Definitely not. We try, always, and in my tenure of office during these years 
to eliminate all these elements. If you go backwards, you will see how many 
members have left Fifa, either by themselves or they have been investigated by 
our committees.

Trademark.

Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Blatter refuses to accept that he is responsible for Fifa's culture of 
corruption. Says its committees have banned lots of individuals.

It’s as one-sided a press conference as you would imagine, but Blatter remains 
calm in the face of questioning. Now, when asked about the US authorities’ 
suggestion that there is far more to come, in terms of their investigation, he 
replies:

The Americans are making investigations … they have right to do so. I have no 
concerns, I especially have no concerns about my person.

On the charge sheet facing him on his watch, Blatter is asked why he has not

Blatter is asked what impact the past week’s events will have to US chances of 
a bid for the 2026 World Cup.

I am the president of everybody and those associations that have been against 
me, so they will have no impact, in my view. When it comes to personal attacks, 
I say yes, I was affected.

matter.” And Blatter’s talk about Israel and Palestine suggests likewise:

Maybe football can be the precursor to the solution everyone wants.

More stuff about boats and calmer waters from Sepp. Now onto his attempts to 
position himself as a peacemaker between Israel and Palestine.

Blatter opens up:

I’ll take responsibility with the storm but I will share it with the executive 
committee because it’s the government that has to take responsiblity.

And then back to the boating references …

We will take our boat back into calmer water and take the Fifa

The latest delay gives me an opportunity to flag up Barney Ronay’s colour 
piece from Zurich on Friday evening 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/29/fifa-the-mire-of-corruption-a-football-leader-emerges-its-blatter>
:

Even by Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> standards this was a 
bizarre and indeed rather disorientating day. Not only is Blatter back, 
re-elected by a concession on the second round of voting. He is apparently back 
as a reform candidate, here to root out the corruption, wire fraud and 
racketeering that afflicted the world’s most lucratively beleaguered sport 
during the reign of his long-term predecessor, who also happens to have been 
Sepp Blatter. “We cannot let this go on!” – Blatter announced at one point 
during his gorgeously, almost sensuously deluded stump speech. And yet, here it 
is all the same. Still very much going on.

Even in the late-breaking tension of the second vote there was a sense of 
something massaged, as the gatheredFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> wonks pondered their piles of blue 
card, muttering behind their hands, brooding over clipboards, and almost 
apologetically signing off on a ballot that brought Blatter to 133 votes, seven 
short of a first round knockout.

While we wait, a recommendation for you to check out Marina Hyde’s take on the 
week’s events 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/29/corruption-fifa-blatter>
. By way of an excerpt:

For those of us who’ve been mired in Fifa-watching for years, the most clear 
and present danger this week was of succumbing toStendhal syndrome 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stendhal_syndrome>, and passing out at the 
majesty of it all. It was difficult not to feel a few ecstatic flutters watching
footage of Fifa bigwigs being publicly escorted into police cars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/may/27/fifa-arrests-man-escorted-from-hotel-behind-sheet-video>
 with hotel staff apparently shielding them with their dirty linen. Or hearing 
that a certain US-headquartered sportswear company was soon to face some 
awkward questions. There are just so many tantalising angles yet to be 
explored. There has barely even been time to begin properly reminding people 
that Uefa boss and clean-up-man-come-lately Michel Platinivoted for Qatar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/05/michel-platini-conspirators-2022-world-cup-bid-uefa>
, and was accused of having been given aPicasso by Vladimir Putin 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/12/01/vladimir-putin-allegedly-gave-uefa-president-michel-platini-a-picasso-in-exchange-for-a-fifa-world-cup-vote/>
. Denied, of course, with lawyers involved, but we look forward to hearing more 
about him in the weeks and months ahead.

The only thing I’d have done differently would have been to take Diana Ross 
along on the dawn raid in Zurich. I very much doubt she’s ever got over that
calamitous penalty miss during the 1994 World Cup opening ceremony 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXjCKwBtG0I>, and it would have been great for 
the erstwhile Supreme to have just stood in the lobby of the Baur au Lac hotel 
and let out a primal scream likeStuart Pearce exorcising his 1990 World Cup 
penalty miss in Euro 96 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0OCRrvMBpA>, in the 
victory over Spain that put England through to the semis. But Diana aside, the 
FBI have played a blinder.

Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has been quick to congratulate Sepp 
Blatter <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sepp-blatter> on his re-election, 
sending a telegram with his best wishes. Reuters report a Kremlin statement as 
saying:

The head of the Russian state expressed confidence that experience,

Our chief sports correspondent, Owen Gibson, is still pounding the streets of 
Zurich today and he’ll be at Blatter’s upcoming press conference. His take on
those comments that have emerged overnight

Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Blatter basically suggests British media and US authorities bitter over losing 
2018 and 2022 World Cups so driving campaign to get him out.

Blatter questions why arrests weren't made at ex co in March when fewer media

As he had said he would should Blatter be re-elected, the FA vice-chairman 
David Gill has rejected his place on Fifa’s executive committee. In a statement 
to the Press Association, Gill said:

This action is not something I take lightly but the terribly damaging events 
of the last three days have convinced me it is not appropriate to be a member 
of theFifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> executive committee 
under the current leadership.

I do recognise that Mr Blatter has been democratically elected and wish Fifa 
every success in tackling the many troubling issues it faces. However, my 
professional reputation is critical to me and I simply do not see how there 
will be change for the good of world football while Mr Blatter remains in post.

I will continue to focus on my positions within the FA and Uefa, which I take 
seriously and am privileged to hold.

Opening summary

Welcome to Saturday’s Fifa liveblog, as newly re-elected president Sepp 
Blatter prepares to face the media in Zurich. The press conference is due to 
take place at 10.30am BST, 11.30am local time. He’s been busy already, mind,
having spoken to Swiss television channel RTS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/warning-of-more-fifa-corruption-charges-as-sepp-blatter-retains-presidency>
 to decry the conduct of US authorities and bemoan a European campaign of 
‘hate’. Some of the key elements:

 * Commenting on the fact that the arrests came only two days before his 
election, he said: “I am not certain but it doesn’t smell good.” 
 * Condemning comments made by US officials including the attorney general, 
Loretta Lynch, who said corruption in football was “rampant, systemic and 
deep-rooted, both abroad and here in the United States”, Blatter said: “Of 
course I am shocked. I would never as Fifa president make comments about 
another organisation without being certain of what has happened.” 
 * Blatter also hit out at the Uefa president, Michel Platini, who had called 
for his resignation over the corruption scandals. “It is a hate that comes not 
just from a person at Uefa,” he said, “it comes from the Uefa organisation that 
cannot understand that in 1998 I became president.” Asked whether he would 
forgive Platini for the resignation calls, Blatter said: “I forgive everyone 
but I do not forget.”  Sepp Blatter is re-elected as Fifa president for a fifth 
term.

Anyway, that’s more than enough. Owen Gibson’s report on the day’s events will 
be here shortly,in this here direction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-vows-steady-fifa-ship-criticises-us-arrests>

Here’s a video of Sepp Blatter’s meeting with the media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-i-have-no-concerns-about-us-investigation-video>
 earlier on Saturday.
 The Fifa president is interrogated at a press conference in Zurich.  
It’s not Fifa-related, but news is just coming through of Rio Ferdinand’s 
retirement. We’ll have a story up on the site shortly.

Some late news from Zurich, where the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) 
has been suspended immediately byFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> due to government interference in 
the country’s national league. Indonesia will now not be eligible to compete in 
the next round of qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup and 2019 Asian Cup, 
starting in less than two weeks’ time.

This decision resulted from the effective ‘takeover’ of the activities of PSSI 
by the Indonesian authorities. However, and as an exceptional measure, the 
national team would be allowed to continue their current participation in the 
2015 Southeast Asian Games.
 
Ah yes, the inevitable bookmaker’s press release on Blatter’s standing and 
whether he’ll see out the next four years as president. I wouldn’t wager 
against it, let’s put it that way. Anyway, William Hill offer the following:

Will Sepp Blatter <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sepp-blatter> see out 
his current term:2-5 yes; 7-4 no.

Will Blatter leave as president of Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> before the end of the year: 5-1 
yes; 1-9 no.

Blatter to win the next election: 5-2 yes; 2-7 no.

Which Fifa sponsor will withdraw their sponsorship first: Evs Visa; 3-1 Coca 
Cola; 4-1 Adidas; 6-1 McDonald’s; 9-1 Budweiser; 10-1 Hyundai; 16-1 Gazprom.
 
Jana Kasperkevic writes why businesses still need Fifa. One word: money 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/why-businesses-still-need-fifa-sponsorship>
.

High profile World Cup sponsors including Coca Cola have called for action, 
Visa even hinted it might terminate its sponsorship if the rot is not stopped. 
Yet according to the former head of communication for Visa’s Global 
sponsorships Andrew Woodward, the company should not do it.

“To those contemplating dumping the sponsorship, I ask: ARE YOU MAD? The Fifa 
World Cup is the most popular sporting event in the world. People love it. They 
don’t care about the corruption,”Woodward wrote in a blog post

but the challenger conceded defeatRead more

So far, the sponsors have hedged their bets stating that they are monitoring 
the situation. Visa has gone as far as to say that ifFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> doesn’t change, it would “reassess 
our sponsorship”. The reason Visa is pushing harded this time around is that it 
is an American, conservative financial company and its partner is being accused 
of corruption, Woodward told the Guardian. Still, he said, its unlikely that 
the company will terminate its sponsorship, considering that since 2008 it has 
probably invested close to a $1bn in sponsorship and licensing fees.

“The sponsors aren’t supporting Fifa. The sponsors are supporting the Fifa 
World Cup as a means by which to reach consumers,” he said, adding that 
investing in World Cup “is not a vote of confidence in Fifa, that’s a means by 
which to reach this sort of a consumer in a certain way.” The sponsors might 
need Fifa more than Fifa needs them.

From our US office, DJ Gallo writes – to a USA! USA! USA! soundtrack – about 
this week’s battles between Team America and Fifa, and wonders:did the US 
accidentally make itself popular 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/30/team-america-v-fifa-did-the-us-accidentally-make-itself-popular>
?

While the rest of the world has been busy enjoying the beautiful game, mostly 
ignoring the ugly corruption in the sport’s governing body as long as there was 
good soccer to watch, US authorities were unraveling a 24-year scheme of bribes 
and self-enrichment. Fifa’s grafters probably thought the US was too dumb to 
take them down. I mean, just three years after the corruption allegedly began,
US Soccer willingly wore denim uniforms in public 
<http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_spot/2014/05/19/u_s_soccer_denim_kit_the_horrifying_true_story_of_the_ugliest_jerseys_in.html>
. That seems pretty dumb. But just add that to Fifa’s list of humiliations: 
they’ve been done in by blue jeans-wearing cowboys who think a “football” is an 
oblong ball best carried or thrown through the air.

America’s return to international awesomeness didn’t stop with spiking the 
football on Fifa. As an extra favor to the world, we also pissed off Vladimir 
Putin. The President of Russia and King of Shirtless Horse Riding said, via the
Kremlin’s website <http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/49546>: “These 
officers are not United States’ citizens, and if anything did happen, it did 
not happen on the territory of the United States and the USA have nothing to do 
with it. This is yet another obvious attempt to spread their jurisdiction to 
other states.”

Getting Putin of all people to whine about international overreach? That’s 
icing on America’s delicious, high fructose corn syrup-infused cake. Russian 
state media followed Putin’s lead by creating TV graphics suggesting crazed 
American bald eagles are hell-bent on destroying soccer– and possibly the world.
 
Some reaction from the members of the media in attendance:

No surprises from that Blatter display, with the usual mixture of 
self-promotion, sniping and straight batting in the face of his interrogation, 
primarily from the western media. Some of the key points re: Blatter:

 * The Fifa president reiterates that he is the best person to lead Fifa, 
saying: “It is very easy, you have seen the results of the Congress and they 
think that I am still the man to solve these problems.” 
 * Denies any knowledge of a $10m bribe to Jack Warner detailed in FBI 
indictment. 
 * Asked if he fears the ongoing investigation from US authorities: “I have no 
concerns. I especially have no concerns about my person.” 
 * Claims that Fifa, under his stewardship, has taken a tough stance on 
corrupt individuals: “If you go backwards, you will see how many members have 
left Fifa, either by themselves or they have been investigated by our 
committees.” 
 * And declares that he will pay a personal visit to sponsors and reassure 
them in the wake of the past week’s events.  Blatter pauses during the press 
conference. Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters  
Final question, then, and Blatter is interrogated as to why he has failed to 
take action against a number of corrupt officials. He launches into a 
pre-planned speech, discussing Uefa, his transparent innocence and even a barb 
at David Gill:
Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
He's back onto another familiar riff - blaming Uefa for reform agenda being 
watered down.

<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604597750626316288> Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Ends with a pop at Gill: "You can't take responsibility when you are elected 
and don't come to the first meeting."
 <https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604597848856854528> May 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604597848856854528> 
And it ends with a promise:

We will be more communicative in future, and we will give more information.
 
Jérôme Valcke says we’re down to the last two questions. First up, Blatter 
asked if he worries about sponsors:

We have already had contact with the sponsors after the revelations … we have 
exchanged letters … and the contact with our partners, I am sure I will bring 
them all back with a personal visit to them.
Martyn Ziegler (@martynziegler) 
Blatter reveals will make personal visit to sponsors after their criticism: 
clearly their concerns have shaken him
 <https://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/604596993890107393> May 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/604596993890107393>  
Owen Gibson then asks Blatter directly about the culture of Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> and his tenure being mired by 
corruption, and whether he has fostered this:

Definitely not. We try, always, and in my tenure of office during these years 
to eliminate all these elements. If you go backwards, you will see how many 
members have left Fifa, either by themselves or they have been investigated by 
our committees.

Trademark.

Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Blatter refuses to accept that he is responsible for Fifa's culture of 
corruption. Says its committees have banned lots of individuals.
 <https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604596245823225856> May 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604596245823225856>  
The question comes in: “Are you worried you’ll be arrested?” Blatter: 
“Arrested for what.”
 
It’s as one-sided a press conference as you would imagine, but Blatter remains 
calm in the face of questioning. Now, when asked about the US authorities’ 
suggestion that there is far more to come, in terms of their investigation, he 
replies:

The Americans are making investigations … they have right to do so. I have no 
concerns, I especially have no concerns about my person.
 The man himself. Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters  
On we go.
Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Blatter asked about $10m bribe: "If such a thing is somewhere in 
investigations, let the investigation go. Definitely, that's not me."
 <https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604594498593648640> May 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604594498593648640>  
This is a textbook Blatter display thus far, as everyone would have expected.
 
Asked about David Gill’s decision not to serve under him, he deadbats it again:

I don’t know exactly what the projects of David Gill are, he has written no 
excuse for his absence from the executive committee.
 
On the charge sheet facing him on his watch, Blatter is asked why he has not 
resigned:

It is very easy, you have seen the results of the Congress and they think that 
I am still the man to solve these problems.
 
Blatter is asked what impact the past week’s events will have to US chances of 
a bid for the 2026 World Cup.

I am the president of everybody and those associations that have been against 
me, so they will have no impact, in my view. When it comes to personal attacks, 
I say yes, I was affected.
 
I am here as president of Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa>, I 
will continue my work, I will continue to fight for good things and, as I said, 
it is now my duty to live up to a lot of responsibilities. But I am not alone. 
The executive committee has said it is with me.

And now the questions are thrown to the floor.
 
Blatter confirms what Owen Gibson reported earlier regarding the allocation of 
World Cup places remaining the same. On the ExCo’s reaction to the news:

Some were more grumpy than others.
 
Now Blatter re-visits his criticism of the US authorities after their raids 
earlier in the week:

All these events culminating in the police storming a hotel and, curiously 
there were already three American journalists at the location …
Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> corruption will be a thing of 
the past, says Blatter. Rattles off a list of committees that will allow them 
to "avoid surprises".
 <https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604592391773814784> May 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604592391773814784>  
The Times’ Oliver Kay has long argued that Blatter’s ultimate dream is the 
Nobel Prize, previously saying: “His priorities these days seem to be 
self-interest, self-preservation and self-aggrandisement. His one remaining 
ambition is to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Seriously, it is. This is no laughing 
matter.” And Blatter’s talk about Israel and Palestine suggests likewise:

Maybe football can be the precursor to the solution everyone wants.

And then:
Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Now Blatter is talking about how Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> helped stop the spread of ebola.
 <https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604591483665137665> May 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604591483665137665>  Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
More stuff about boats and calmer waters from Sepp. Now onto his attempts to 
position himself as a peacemaker between Israel and Palestine.
 <https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604590705353195520> May 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/604590705353195520>  
Blatter opens up:

I’ll take responsibility with the storm but I will share it with the executive 
committee because it’s the government that has to take responsiblity.

And then back to the boating references …

We will take our boat back into calmer water and take the Fifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> ship into tranquility and happiness.
 
Here we go, then.
 
The latest delay gives me an opportunity to flag up Barney Ronay’s colour 
piece from Zurich on Friday evening 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/29/fifa-the-mire-of-corruption-a-football-leader-emerges-its-blatter>
:

Even by Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> standards this was a 
bizarre and indeed rather disorientating day. Not only is Blatter back, 
re-elected by a concession on the second round of voting. He is apparently back 
as a reform candidate, here to root out the corruption, wire fraud and 
racketeering that afflicted the world’s most lucratively beleaguered sport 
during the reign of his long-term predecessor, who also happens to have been 
Sepp Blatter. “We cannot let this go on!” – Blatter announced at one point 
during his gorgeously, almost sensuously deluded stump speech. And yet, here it 
is all the same. Still very much going on.

Even in the late-breaking tension of the second vote there was a sense of 
something massaged, as the gatheredFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> wonks pondered their piles of blue 
card, muttering behind their hands, brooding over clipboards, and almost 
apologetically signing off on a ballot that brought Blatter to 133 votes, seven 
short of a first round knockout.
 
It sounds like we are just about ready to get this thing started. Again, if 
you want to watch, the livestream from Zurich is embedded at the top of this 
article. Oh, there’s another short delay, due to sound bother.

Owen Gibson reports that Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> 
looks set to maintain its allocation of places for the next two World Cups, 
with Europe getting 14 in 2018 and 13 in 2022.

All World Cup slots maintained as they are until 2018/22 according to exco 
member Juan Napout. That means 14 for Europe in 18 and 13 in 22.

While we wait, a recommendation for you to check out Marina Hyde’s take on the 
week’s events 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/29/corruption-fifa-blatter>
. By way of an excerpt:

For those of us who’ve been mired in Fifa-watching for years, the most clear 
and present danger this week was of succumbing toStendhal syndrome 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stendhal_syndrome>, and passing out at the 
majesty of it all. It was difficult not to feel a few ecstatic flutters watching
footage of Fifa bigwigs being publicly escorted into police cars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/may/27/fifa-arrests-man-escorted-from-hotel-behind-sheet-video>
 with hotel staff apparently shielding them with their dirty linen. Or hearing 
that a certain US-headquartered sportswear company was soon to face some 
awkward questions. There are just so many tantalising angles yet to be 
explored. There has barely even been time to begin properly reminding people 
that Uefa boss and clean-up-man-come-lately Michel Platinivoted for Qatar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/05/michel-platini-conspirators-2022-world-cup-bid-uefa>
, and was accused of having been given aPicasso by Vladimir Putin 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/12/01/vladimir-putin-allegedly-gave-uefa-president-michel-platini-a-picasso-in-exchange-for-a-fifa-world-cup-vote/>
. Denied, of course, with lawyers involved, but we look forward to hearing more 
about him in the weeks and months ahead.

The only thing I’d have done differently would have been to take Diana Ross 
along on the dawn raid in Zurich. I very much doubt she’s ever got over that
calamitous penalty miss during the 1994 World Cup opening ceremony 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXjCKwBtG0I>, and it would have been great for 
the erstwhile Supreme to have just stood in the lobby of the Baur au Lac hotel 
and let out a primal scream likeStuart Pearce exorcising his 1990 World Cup 
penalty miss in Euro 96 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0OCRrvMBpA>, in the 
victory over Spain that put England through to the semis. But Diana aside, the 
FBI have played a blinder.
 
We’re still waiting for the press conference to begin. You’re not missing

Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has been quick to congratulate Sepp 
Blatter <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sepp-blatter> on his re-election, 
sending a telegram with his best wishes. Reuters report a Kremlin statement as 
saying:

The head of the Russian state expressed confidence that experience, 
professionalism and high authority will help Blatter in future encourage the 
spread in the geography and popularity of football in the whole world.

A reminder that the press conference, which is sure to be essential viewing, 
begins at 10.30am BST. And you can watch it right here:

Zurich today and he’ll be at Blatter’s upcoming press conference. His take on

Blatter basically suggests British media and US authorities bitter over losing 
2018 and 2022 World Cups so driving campaign to get him out.

Blatter questions why arrests weren't made at ex co in March when fewer media 
in Zurich: “The journalists made a deal: Blatter out.”

As he had said he would should Blatter be re-elected, the FA vice-chairman 
David Gill has rejected his place on Fifa’s executive committee. In a statement 
to the Press Association, Gill said:

This action is not something I take lightly but the terribly damaging events 
of the last three days have convinced me it is not appropriate to be a member 
of theFifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> executive committee 
under the current leadership.

I do recognise that Mr Blatter has been democratically elected and wish Fifa 
every success in tackling the many troubling issues it faces. However, my 
professional reputation is critical to me and I simply do not see how there 
will be change for the good of world football while Mr Blatter remains in post.

I will continue to focus on my positions within the FA and Uefa, which I take 
seriously and am privileged to hold.
 
Welcome to Saturday’s Fifa liveblog, as newly re-elected president Sepp 
Blatter prepares to face the media in Zurich. The press conference is due to 
take place at 10.30am BST, 11.30am local time. He’s been busy already, mind,
having spoken to Swiss television channel RTS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/warning-of-more-fifa-corruption-charges-as-sepp-blatter-retains-presidency>
 to decry the conduct of US authorities and bemoan a European campaign of 
‘hate’. Some of the key elements:

 * Commenting on the fact that the arrests came only two days before his 
election, he said: “I am not certain but it doesn’t smell good.” 
 * Condemning comments made by US officials including the attorney general, 
Loretta Lynch, who said corruption in football was “rampant, systemic and 
deep-rooted, both abroad and here in the United States”, Blatter said: “Of 
course I am shocked. I would never as Fifa president make comments about 
another organisation without being certain of what has happened.” 
 * Blatter also hit out at the Uefa president, Michel Platini, who had called 
for his resignation over the corruption scandals. “It is a hate that comes not 
just from a person at Uefa,” he said, “it comes from the Uefa organisation that 
cannot understand that in 1998 I became president.” Asked whether he would 
forgive Platini for the resignation calls, Blatter said: “I forgive everyone 
but I do not forget.”  Sepp Blatter is re-elected as Fifa president for a fifth 
term.
