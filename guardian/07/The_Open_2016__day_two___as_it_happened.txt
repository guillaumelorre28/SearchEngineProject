And so today’s live hole-by-hole report comes to a close. A round of two 
halves, all right, with the lads out in the morning enjoying decent conditions, 
the folk out later suffering in extreme rain and wind. But that’s part of the 
weird attraction of links golf.Phil Mickelson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson> and Henrik Stenson will have 
spent the afternoon with their feet on the desk, sucking down big cigars. The 
smart money is on the cut saving everyone at +4, which will be good news for 
Bubba, Jordan, Monty and Danny Willett. Enjoy what’s left of your Friday, and 
please join me tomorrow for Moving Day!

Hideki Matsuyama ends a dismal round by thinning a chip out of a bunker 
straight across the green. Two putts from off the other side, and that’s a 
bogey; he signs for a 78. At +8, he’ll not be here this weekend. Bubba almost 
certainly will, though! He knocks in his birdie putt, and though he’s signing 
for a 76, he should scrape under the cut at +4. Rory takes a two-putt par, and 
he signs for 71. It’s decent in the circumstances - he’s -2 overall, and not 
out of this - but how he’ll rue those two missed short putts at 9 and 10. His 
situation would look so much brighter had those tiddlers gone in.

McIlroy doesn’t make true contact with his driver up 18, but it lands in prime 
position on the right-hand side of the fairway nonetheless. Bubba sends his 
ball into similar territory, then arrows a delightful approach straight at the 
flag. He’ll have a six-footer to save himself! Rory fires his at the pin too, 
but appears to have taken one club too many.. He’s at the back of the big 
green, facing a long two putts for his par.

What a putt by Willett on the last! Having chipped out of the fairway bunker, 
he sends his third pin high to 15 feet, then knocks in a gentle left-to-right 
slider for a par that keeps him at +4 - and ensures his participation this 
weekend! Not everyone will be cursing the weather: it’s been swings and 
roundabouts for the Masters champ. A par meanwhile for Jason Day, and his 
one-under 70 means he reaches the halfway mark at +1. And finally there’s 
Rickie Fowler, who makes it three pars out of three, and his scrapping 72 puts 
him at -1, nine shots shy of Phil Mickelson’s leading mark.

Bubba lags it up. But lagging it up isn’t good enough. That’s a bogey, 
dropping him back to +5. Rory very nearly drains his birdie effort, but it 
stays out on the right. So close. He taps in and remains at -2. He looks a lot 
happier now. Despite it all, he’s still in with a chance of winning this 
tournament, even if he has a lot to do now. Hideki Matsuyama has had a dreadful 
day, incidentally: a birdie at 5 followed by bogeys at 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16 and 
now 17. He’s +7 and definitely going home.

Steve Stricker pars 18. It’s his 17th par of the round. The other hole: that 
quadruple bogey at 15. Has there ever been a card like it in major championship 
history? What a 75. He’s level par overall, and more than anyone out there has 
cause to curse the storm. Meanwhile Bubba hooks a godawful tee shot into 17, 
the ball disappearing behind the grandstand to the back right of the green. He 
lobs back into the heart of the putting surface, but he’ll have a 30-foot 
tester if he wants to stay at cut-bodyswerving +4.

Rory has relocated his gameface. A long iron into the heart of the tricky 
par-three 17th, and he’ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet. Meanwhile up on 
18, Danny Willett needs a par to make sure of his participation this weekend. 
So he doesn’t want to be sending it into the bunker on the left of the fairway. 
He’ll have to take his medicine and chip out, then hope to get up and down from 
distance.

A birdie! A birdie! Rory curls in a 20-footer from the back of the 16th, and 
he moves back to -2. Bubba knocks in a par saver of similar distance. It might 
be no coincidence that the wind has totally dropped. Some ecosystem around 
Troon. Up on 17, it’s pars for Willett (+4), Day (+1) and Fowler (-1).

A dropped shot for Jason Day at 16, his par putt sliding by the right of the 
hole. He’s +1. A birdie for Danny Willett, though, and he moves back up to +4. 
That could be a very important putt for the Masters champion, because the 
projected cut line has moved out, saving everyone at +4. Granted a reprieve (as 
things stand): Graeme McDowell, Colin Montgomerie, Jim Furyk, Paul Lawrie, 
Brandt Snedeker and Jordan Spieth. Also at +4 and saved, providing they don’t 
drop any more strokes: Willett and Bubba.

Justin Rose has had a very strange round. He’s four over through 17, but all 
the damage was done before the poor weather: he was out in 40. Since then, pars 
all the way. But having battled so hard for so long, it’s going wrong at the 
last. He buries his head in his hands as his drive is swallowed up by a fairway 
bunker. He’s forced to chip out, and then sends his third into the deep, wet 
bunker front left of the green. This is a miserable end. He bounces his ball 
out to eight feet, a fine, fighting response. But he doesn’t hit his bogey 
putt, which dies off to the left. A 77, and he’s +3. Spieth meanwhile finishes 
with a solid par. His 75 has him at +4. He’s almost certainly going to make the 
cut, though he probably won’t have realised that yet.

Fowler can’t make his putt at 15. He drops back to -1. His partner Jason Day 
meanwhile is demonstrating his street-fighting skills: just the one bogey since 
the weather turned, at 12, the rest of the back nine pars. He stays at level 
par. And the weather seems to be easing off a tad. It’s still windy and rainy, 
but hey, it’s all relative.

We haven’t had a leaderboard for a while. Well, there’s a reason for that. But 
here’s what it looks like now. It’s what it’s going to look like at the end of 
the day, too.

-10: Mickelson (F)
-9: Stenson (F)
-7: Kjeldsen (F), Bradley (F)
-5: Z Johnson (F)
-4: Finau (F), Haas (F), Schwartzel (F), Johnston (F), Garcia (F)
-3: Na (F), Kuchar (F), Kaymer (F), Cabrera-Bello (F)

The highest-placed player out on the course right now is Rickie Fowler at -2. 
And if he doesn’t rake home a long putt from the front of 15, he’ll be sharing 
that status with Rory McIlroy and Richard Sterne at -1. It’s fair to say those 
out late yesterday and early today got the best of the draw. Hey, it’s part of 
the Open Championship’s unique charm.

Spieth finds the heart of 16 in regulation. His long birdie putt stays wide 
left, and he very nearly misses the four-footer he leaves himself, but the left 
lip swallows it up. He’s still at +4, and even if he can only par home, he 
might survive if enough players out there drop shots. A scenario which, in this 
weather, is far from a pipe dream. Meanwhile Stricker ends up with a 
quadruple-bogey 8 on 15 after all those pars. Somewhere, Paul Azinger is 
wondering why something like that couldn’t have happened to Nick Faldo at 
Muirfield in 1987.

A brilliant tee shot into the par-three 14th from Bubba, a draw helped to six 
feet by the wind. He knocks it in for a birdie that takes him back to +4 and 
keeps his hopes of weekend participation alive. If he harbours those hopes, of 
course. I’m assuming nothing. McIlroy finds the front of the green, meanwhile, 
and takes two putts for a rare par. He’s still -1.

Steve Stricker isn’t going to par his way home, Nick Faldo style. He carded 14 
in a row, but sent his tee shot, then a provisional, then another provisional 
into the thick rough down the right of the long par-four 15th. After a long 
search, he eventually found his second ball, so was chipping back out on to the 
fairway for four. More as we have it.

Another dropped shot for McIlroy, his fourth bogey in five holes. He’s in the 
thick of the weather, just as he was when shooting 80 on the second day of the 
2010 Open. He might have drawn the short straw a year later at Sandwich, too, 
if memory serves. This time he hits a heavy chip into 13, expecting strong wind 
to hold it up, only for that very wind to drop. He’s -1, and looks to have 
mentally checked out. In some ways, you can’t blame him: the conditions put the 
rating X into extreme. On the other hand, Rickie Fowler is battling hard in the 
face of adversity: pars at 13 and 14 since his dropped shot at 12, and he stays 
at -2.

A clumsy pitch into 15 has cost Jordan Spieth another shot. He’s back to +4, 
just the wrong side of the projected cut. The weather is utterly filthy, 
though, so with plenty of players still out there, providing he doesn’t suffer 
too much himself, he might survive. That’s a big if, though. He hoicks his tee 
shot at 16 into the thick rough down the left. He had been expecting help from 
a crosswind, but he got nothing. “Aw come on! If I hit that shot on the last 
hole, it’d have ended up on the road!” He grins at the absurdity of it all, 
taking it in good spirits. The wind is ludicrous, to be fair, oscillating 
between 20mph and 30mph at the drop of a hat. Can you hear that warm crackle? 
That’sPhil Mickelson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson> and 
Henrik Stenson, drawing on their cigars.

Rory in a greenside bunker at 12. He can only just get his ball out of the wet 
sand, leaving himself too much to do with the par putt. He’s back to -2, and 
the wheels of his challenge are beginning to clank off. He was within five 
strokes of Mickelson less than an hour ago. The weather is awful, but that 
wasn’t a factor for his first two bogeys of the day.

Steve Stricker is on a run. Of pars. He’s now made it 14 in a row by tickling 
one in from ten feet. He stays at -4. On the other end of the scale, here’s 
Louis Oosthuizen. He started the day at level par. He’s now +12. What’s mainly 
happened there is a nine at the Railway hole. Yesterday’s hole in one seems an 
awfully long time ago now. Meanwhile an interview on Sky with the extremely 
modest and likeable Zach Johnson. They’ve just pointed out that the only other 
men who have won the Masters and an Open at St Andrews are Tiger Woods, Nick 
Faldo, Seve, Jack Nicklaus and Sam Snead. That’s pretty astonishing company to 
be keeping, and Johnson’s voice cracked as he admitted: “I’m speechless. How 
can you not be in awe?”

Spieth starts his comeback quest in magnificent fashion, sending his tee shot 
at 14 to six feet. In goes the birdie putt, and he’s +3. The old (ahem) Jordan 
Spieth is back! Rory, from the centre of 11, sends a marvellous second into the 
middle of the green. He’ll have a look at repairing some of the damage of 9 and 
10 from 18 feet. But it slides by to the right and he’ll have to settle for 
par. But he’s steadied the ship a little, if nothing else. But it’s a double 
bogey for Bubba, who drops to +4. Meanwhile Patrick Reed responded to bogeys at 
8, 10, 11, 15 and 16 with a big rake for birdie across 17. He’s very close to 
curling in a 30-footer on 18, too, but he’ll settle for par. A 74 today, and 
he’s -2 at the halfway mark.

Spieth very nearly holes a 25-footer across 13 for a much-needed birdie. But 
it stays on the high side. Holes are running out if he wants to save himself. A 
couple of birdies should do it. One, possibly, if the weather that’s coming in 
- higher winds and rain - has any sort of effect.

Rory is unravelling. He plays 10 straight down the middle. Pin high, 25 feet 
away, he races his birdie effort three feet past. And he pushes the par putt 
wide right. That’s two super-short ones missed in a row, and it’s back-to-back 
bogeys. He stomps off the green moaning quite a lot. He’s back to -3, and needs 
to calm down. He’s jittery and fuming, which is not a good combo. Mind you, 
there’s problems, and there are problems. Bubba had missed a short one at 10 
too, and at +2 he’s skirting with the cut. (That’s moved out to +3, by the 
way.) And now the big-driving lefty has hoicked his drive at 11 onto the 
railway track. He’s in trouble now. Rory splits the fairway.

Spieth is extremely fortunate not to lose his drive in a gorse bush down the 
left of 12.He’s flaying the ball off the tee box like Seve. It’s a heavy lie, 
though, and he shouts in response to a stab of pain in his wrist as he punches 
back onto the fairway. He punches his third in low, hoping to send it 
scampering towards the hole. But it stops 30 feet short, and his attempt to 
salvage the situation with his putter is always dying left. Another bogey, and 
the 2015 Masters and US Open champion is in serious trouble now at +4.

Fowler sends a wild one towards the 10th green, up a bank to the left, and 
can’t get up and down. He’s back to -3. Day pars to stay at -1. Byeong Hun An 
is a dimple away from knocking in a short eagle putt on 16, but a birdie seems 
scant reward for knocking his second at the par-five to six feet. Meanwhile 
arguably the shot of the day from the 2011 champion Darren Clarke, who is wide 
of the 18th fairway, and sends his second from 150 yards bouncing straight 
towards the hole, stopping six inches short. The birdie brings him to +1, and 
ensures he’ll be here for the weekend!

Rory reaches the middle of the big 9th green in two. He lags up to a couple of 
feet, then inexcusably misses the par putt. That’s another costly loss of 
concentration. He wanders off with black plumes of steam coming out of both 
lugs: with 10 and 11 coming up, the last thing you want is to be shedding silly 
shots. He’s back to -4. He skelps a 3-wood down the track at 10, a fine, if 
rather frustrated, response.

Spieth finds the centre of 11 with his second, but his mid-range birdie putt 
dies to the left. It’s not a bad miss, but he reacts as though he’s just missed 
a tiddler. Nothing wrong with having high standards, for sure, but he’ll give 
himself high blood pressure at this rate. He stays at +3. Meanwhile Byeong Hun 
An is going well: par through the front nine, but birdies at 11 and 14. He’s -3 
overall. Scott Hend’s charge has slowed a tad, incidentally: a bogey at 8 was 
followed by a double at 10, and though he’s just picked one up again at 12, 
he’s down the leaderboard a bit now at -2.

Par for Day on 9, and he’s reached the turn in 33. He’s -1, and walking with a 
spring in his step. He knows he’s not out of this yet. Rickie Fowler follows 
him in, and he turns in 34, at -4. He’s very much in position. But Patrick Reed 
continues to move in the wrong direction. Another bogey, this time at 15, and 
he’s three over for his round, -2 overall. His compatriot Billy Horschel has 
doubled 7 to drop to -2. But Steve Stricker has reached the turn in a 
Faldoesque 36, nine pars, and the veteran grinder is hanging on in there at -4.

Spieth’s struggles continue. He’s all over the place, a strange mix of 
nonsense and brilliance. He drives into the thick rubbish down the right of 10, 
and sends his second down the huge bank to the right of the green. But from a 
tight lie, he chips up close, and for a second hole in a row, scrambles an 
unlikely par. “He’s not totally switched on,” says the Sky pundit Nick Faldo. 
But he’s not giving up, either, despite being the wrong side of the cut line at 
+3. He sends his drive at 11 whistling worryingly to the right, but it takes a 
kind bounce in the semi-rough and makes its way onto the fairway. Could that 
little break send his round in a different direction too?

So Rory, having reached the upper echelons of the leaderboard, plops his ball 
in the Coffin bunker at the Postage Stamp.Danger ahoy! But he clips the ball so 
gently off the wet sand, landing it on the edge of the green and letting the 
down slope do the work. The ball rolls to three feet, and that’s a great par 
save. Not quite as spectacular as Bubba’s scramble: he’s in the Spieth Bunker 
on the other side, and instead of taking a couple to get out, he swishes 
serenely under the ball, sending it smoothly bouncing towards the hole and 
pinging off the flagstick. It should drop in for birdie, but he’ll not complain 
about the par.

Forgot to mention that Danny Willett also birdied 7 while Day and Fowler were 
about their business. Not that it matters too much, because he plugged his ball 
in the bunker to the right of the Postage Stamp, and after taking a couple to 
find the green, two-putted for a double bogey. The Masters champion is +3 now, 
and in all sorts of cut-related bother. 2016’s not going to be his year for 
Open glory, but he’ll always have that verdant sports jacket. Meanwhile it’s 
back-to-back birdies for McIlroy! He chips up from the edge of 7 to six feet. 
Not ideal, as he leaves himself a snaky slider, but he thinks long and hard 
before knocking it in. Look at this leaderboard now!

-10: Mickelson (F)
-9: Stenson (F)
-7: Kjeldsen (F), Bradley (F)
-5: Z Johnson (F), McIlroy (7)

This is heating up again nicely, after a bit of a lull. Rory and Bubba nearly 
drive the green at the par-four 7th. On the putting surface, Jason Day and 
Rickie Fowler drain birdie putts while smiling quite a lot. They’re enjoying 
themselves, and no wonder: that’s three birdies in a row for Day, who is -1 
overall, and it’s the second birdie of the round for the links student Fowler, 
who is as high as -4 now.

Jordan Spieth might be struggling a little this week, but he wasn’t a two-time 
major winner at the age of 21 for nothing.He’s just wanged a hilariously poor 
second shot towards the 9th green. Or more specifically up a bank to the left. 
But from the tightest of spots, he’s bumped a pitch down to a couple of feet, 
and he’ll escape with a much-needed ship-steadying par. A class act, even if 
Troon’s not been his best pal this week. He’s out in 39, +3 overall. Bogey for 
Rose, though, and he’s reached the turn in 40. He’s +1, and it’s been a painful 
couple of hours for Hampshire’s finest. Meanwhile back on 6, McIlroy makes a 
very steady bogey. Drive up the middle, fairway wood up the middle, chip into 
the heart of the green, 15 footer into the cup. Easy as that. He’s suddenly in 
a competitive position at -4!

Jason Day might be struggling a little this week, but he isn’t world number 
one for nothing. The PGA champion is on the front fringe of the par-five 6th in 
three, facing a long snaking putt up the green. It’s always going in, from the 
second it left his putter. A magic moment, and one that might kick-start a move 
up the leaderboard. He’s level par now, and that’s his third birdie in the last 
four holes. Meanwhile the man who started this whole thing off - Colin 
Montgomerie - has just bogeyed the last hole and will sign for a 75. He ends 
his tournament at +4, and will spend the weekend in the commentary box. His 
loss is our gain; he’s a great pundit. And that’s because of, rather than 
despite, his eccentricities. Good old Monty.

Disaster for Spieth on the Postage Stamp. He splashes out of the sand on the 
right, over the high face, but can only land his ball on the slope that gathers 
the ball back towards the same grainy trouble. He’s got more space to escape 
with his second attempt, firing the ball towards the Coffin on the other side, 
but using the slope in front of that trap to guide the ball back towards the 
target. He’s still got a ten-footer for bogey, mind. Even if he gets this, he’s 
below the projected cut line. Well, he can’t make it. It’s his first double 
bogey of the week, and he’s in a bit of bother now at +3.

Rory bumps a chip up to six feet from the front of 5, and once again scrambles 
his par. His partners? Matsuyama, having found the green front left, rolls in 
for a much-needed birdie: he’s level par again. But Bubba can only slash out 
from the bunker into the middle of the green. He can’t roll the 15-foot par 
saver, and after birdie at 4, he’s back to +1 again. Meanwhile Spieth’s bump up 
to 7 isn’t all that, but he rattles in a staunch par putt. He stays at +1, 
though for how long? On the Postage Stamp, he sends his tee shot to the right 
and into the deep bunker. He’s found an awful lot of sand today.

On 7, there’s more trouble for Spieth, who drives into filth down the right. 
He can only hack it back out to the fairway, short of the green. He’ll need a 
crisp chip and putt to save his par. Meanwhile on the par-three 5th, Bubba 
sends his tee shot into a bunker to the left, and starts effin’ and jeffin’ in 
the grand style. More in resignation than exasperation, mind you. He’s giving 
off the air of a man who can’t be bothered any more. Maybe he can’t be bothered 
any more. Then Rory steps up, and lands his tee shot 30 yards short of the 
green! Some of the biggest names in world golf are all over the shop right now.

McIlroy narrows his eyes and chips up to four feet. That’s going to save his 
skin on this hole. A par, and he remains at -3. Rickie Fowler has followed up 
his opening birdie with four pars; he stays at -3 too. Jason Day picks up 
another stroke with a birdie two at 5; he’s now got his head above the 
projected cut line at +1. Meanwhile the Masters champion Danny Willett 
completes a trio of pars in that marquee group, though having bogeyed 1 and 4, 
he’s struggling at +2.

A lot of addled heads right now. Rory is standing in the middle of the 4th 
fairway, in prime position. He’s irritated by having to wait for a marshal to 
rake a bunker. Rattled, he slices a fairway wood into thick filth down the 
right. That’ll be a test of mettle. If they can find the ball. Ah yes, they 
can. But he can only punch back out on to the fairway. He’ll need to get up and 
down from 50 yards if he’s to save par. Meanwhile up on 6, Spieth splashes out 
from the bunker to five feet, not a bad result at all, but he’s shaking his 
head in irritation. Clearly he’s not trusting himself to tidy up. And he’d be 
right: a meek prod to the right of the hole, and he’s back to +1 again. Patrick 
Reed has dropped another one, this time at 10, to slip back into the big pack 
at -4. He’s joined there by the altogether happier Scott Hend, for the 
42-year-old Australian journeyman is heading in the other direction, and at 
some speed: birdies at 1, 3, 4 and now 6. What a run!

Bubba isn’t in the best of moods, a legacy of that dreadful tiddler he missed 
on the opening hole no doubt. He’s dropped another shot, this time at 3, so 
he’s +1 and in danger of missing the cut if he’s not careful. Sky Sports just 
tracked the flight of his drive on 4, and the wind is playing havoc with his 
big boomers. Imagine the top of a treble clef. Well, that. Jordan Spieth is 
also out of sorts: hitting what looks like a simple wedge into the par-five 
6th, he chunks it in a bunker well short of the green. He turns to give his 
caddy an incredulous look: this sort of thing just doesn’t happen to him. He 
seemed happy enough with his long game yesterday, blaming his relatively poor 
score on his putter. Well, it’s been a mixed bag at best today.

Rory split the fairway at 3. He should have gone close with his wedge in, but 
could only find the back of the green, a careless mistake. He still wasn’t too 
far away from draining the long putt coming back, but the birdie effort didn’t 
drop. He stays at -3. Patrick Reed has reached the turn in a fairly uneventful 
36 strokes: one birdie, one bogey. A marked contrast to yesterday’s 31, but 
then feel that wind tickling your collar. There hasn’t been much movement at 
the top of the leaderboard, then. But let’s remind ourselves where we are:

-10: Mickelson (F)
-9: Stenson (F)
-7: Kjeldsen (F), Bradley (F)
-5: Z Johnson (F), Reed (9)

It’s been a disastrous start for Justin Rose. He missed a short par putt on 
the opening hole, and now a double at the 4th - another short one prodded past 
the hole with great uncertainty - has him more worried about the cut than the 
lead. Already three over for his round, he’s clanked back down to level par. 
Louis Oosthuizen has bogeyed 6 to drop to +1. The world number one Jason Day 
bogeyed the opening hole, but he’s bounced back with birdie at 3, though at +2 
he needs a couple more if he’s to be here at the weekend for sure. And Jordan 
Spieth pulls an appalling tee shot into one of the bunkers front left of the 
par-three 5th. A lot of big names with furrowed brows right now.

McIlroy will have annoyed himself by missing that good birdie chance on 1, but 
he doesn’t need to force things. At 2, and with the wind up, he opts to find 
the centre of the green instead of going for the flag, and let his putter do 
the work. Wise move: he rolls a straight 25-footer into the cup, one of those 
that was always going in from the moment it left the face of the club. He’s -3. 
Jordan Spieth will be back to level par after a cute chip over bunkers that 
screeched to a halt a couple of feet by the flag at the par-five 4th. But 
Patrick Reed found the bunker to the right of the Postage Stamp, and that’s a 
bogey that brings him back down to -5.

Thanks Niall. So while Bubba’s astonishing twitchy miss on the opening hole 
was somehow predictable - he didn’t look comfortable over it, and was up and 
out of the stroke almost before he made contact - Jordan Spieth’s miss on 3 is 
a little more shocking.From the centre of the fairway, he’d clipped his second 
to five feet, and a birdie seemed on the cards. But it lipped out. Can you 
remember him missing anything from within, I dunno, 15 feet during 2015? No, me 
neither. But this is happening quite regularly at the moment. He doesn’t quite 
have the same certainty. I guess that’s what blowing up at Augusta does to a 
man. He stays at +1, which is only a shot above the projected cut, so he’ll 
need to watch himself here. Other pre-tournament favourites currently flirting 
with danger: Danny Willett, Hideki Matsuyama and Branden Grace. This will be a 
very interesting afternoon.

The wind picking up all over the course now, which will be of particular 
concern to the thoroughbreds heading along the coast-hugging front nine. 
Patrick Reed has been Mr Consistent so far – five pars and one birdie in his 
opening six. Fowler birdies the first after an excellent approach shot, and 
McIlroy, playing into the wind, follows suit. He lands his second shot on the 
front edge of the green, within range of the pin. It’s a presentable chance 
that McIlroy ends up pushing wide. He’ll settle for par, while Watson drops a 
shot with a stinker of a short par putt.

-10: Mickelson (F)
-9: Stenson (F)
-7: Kjeldsen (F), Bradley (F)
-6: Reed (6)

Time to hand back to your very own Scott Murray...

With the wind whistling across the 18th, García and Bradley finish off their 
rounds. Sergio undercooks his putt, apparently not taking the wind into account 
at all – and gets himself in an awful mess, three-putting to pick up a bogey, 
and drop back to four under par. Oh, Sergio... Meanwhile, Bradley pars to 
finish three under for the day, seven under for the week, and very much in 
contention.

Fowler, Day and Masters champ Danny Willett are teeing off at the 1st. Fowler 
begins two under, Willett even par, and Day two over, close to the projected 
cut. Plenty of time though. At the second, Spieth again misjudges his approach 
to the green, picking out a tricky bunker – but rescues the situation with an 
expert chip out of trouble. Lowry lands back-to-back birdies in his bid to make 
the cut – the Irishman is up to five over par.

And so today’s live hole-by-hole report comes to a close. A round of two 
halves, all right, with the lads out in the morning enjoying decent conditions, 
the folk out later suffering in extreme rain and wind. But that’s part of the 
weird attraction of links golf.Phil Mickelson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson> and Henrik Stenson will have 
spent the afternoon with their feet on the desk, sucking down big cigars. The 
smart money is on the cut saving everyone at +4, which will be good news for 
Bubba, Jordan, Monty and Danny Willett. Enjoy what’s left of your Friday, and 
please join me tomorrow for Moving Day!

Hideki Matsuyama ends a dismal round by thinning a chip out of a bunker 
straight across the green. Two putts from off the other side, and that’s a 
bogey; he signs for a 78. At +8, he’ll not be here this weekend. Bubba almost 
certainly will, though! He knocks in his birdie putt, and though he’s signing 
for a 76, he should scrape under the cut at +4. Rory takes a two-putt par, and 
he signs for 71. It’s decent in the circumstances - he’s -2 overall, and not 
out of this - but how he’ll rue those two missed short putts at 9 and 10. His 
situation would look so much brighter had those tiddlers gone in.
 
McIlroy doesn’t make true contact with his driver up 18, but it lands in prime 
position on the right-hand side of the fairway nonetheless. Bubba sends his 
ball into similar territory, then arrows a delightful approach straight at the 
flag. He’ll have a six-footer to save himself! Rory fires his at the pin too, 
but appears to have taken one club too many.. He’s at the back of the big 
green, facing a long two putts for his par.
 
What a putt by Willett on the last! Having chipped out of the fairway bunker, 
he sends his third pin high to 15 feet, then knocks in a gentle left-to-right 
slider for a par that keeps him at +4 - and ensures his participation this 
weekend! Not everyone will be cursing the weather: it’s been swings and 
roundabouts for the Masters champ. A par meanwhile for Jason Day, and his 
one-under 70 means he reaches the halfway mark at +1. And finally there’s 
Rickie Fowler, who makes it three pars out of three, and his scrapping 72 puts 
him at -1, nine shots shy of Phil Mickelson’s leading mark.

Bubba lags it up. But lagging it up isn’t good enough. That’s a bogey, 
dropping him back to +5. Rory very nearly drains his birdie effort, but it 
stays out on the right. So close. He taps in and remains at -2. He looks a lot 
happier now. Despite it all, he’s still in with a chance of winning this 
tournament, even if he has a lot to do now. Hideki Matsuyama has had a dreadful 
day, incidentally: a birdie at 5 followed by bogeys at 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16 and 
now 17. He’s +7 and definitely going home.
 
Steve Stricker pars 18. It’s his 17th par of the round. The other hole: that 
quadruple bogey at 15. Has there ever been a card like it in major championship 
history? What a 75. He’s level par overall, and more than anyone out there has 
cause to curse the storm. Meanwhile Bubba hooks a godawful tee shot into 17, 
the ball disappearing behind the grandstand to the back right of the green. He 
lobs back into the heart of the putting surface, but he’ll have a 30-foot 
tester if he wants to stay at cut-bodyswerving +4.
 
Rory has relocated his gameface. A long iron into the heart of the tricky 
par-three 17th, and he’ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet. Meanwhile up on 
18, Danny Willett needs a par to make sure of his participation this weekend. 
So he doesn’t want to be sending it into the bunker on the left of the fairway. 
He’ll have to take his medicine and chip out, then hope to get up and down from 
distance.
 
A birdie! A birdie! Rory curls in a 20-footer from the back of the 16th, and 
he moves back to -2. Bubba knocks in a par saver of similar distance. It might 
be no coincidence that the wind has totally dropped. Some ecosystem around 
Troon. Up on 17, it’s pars for Willett (+4), Day (+1) and Fowler (-1).
 
A dropped shot for Jason Day at 16, his par putt sliding by the right of the 
hole. He’s +1. A birdie for Danny Willett, though, and he moves back up to +4. 
That could be a very important putt for the Masters champion, because the 
projected cut line has moved out, saving everyone at +4. Granted a reprieve (as 
things stand): Graeme McDowell, Colin Montgomerie, Jim Furyk, Paul Lawrie, 
Brandt Snedeker and Jordan Spieth. Also at +4 and saved, providing they don’t 
drop any more strokes: Willett and Bubba.
 
Justin Rose has had a very strange round. He’s four over through 17, but all 
the damage was done before the poor weather: he was out in 40. Since then, pars 
all the way. But having battled so hard for so long, it’s going wrong at the 
last. He buries his head in his hands as his drive is swallowed up by a fairway 
bunker. He’s forced to chip out, and then sends his third into the deep, wet 
bunker front left of the green. This is a miserable end. He bounces his ball 
out to eight feet, a fine, fighting response. But he doesn’t hit his bogey 
putt, which dies off to the left. A 77, and he’s +3. Spieth meanwhile finishes 
with a solid par. His 75 has him at +4. He’s almost certainly going to make the 
cut, though he probably won’t have realised that yet.

Fowler can’t make his putt at 15. He drops back to -1. His partner Jason Day 
meanwhile is demonstrating his street-fighting skills: just the one bogey since 
the weather turned, at 12, the rest of the back nine pars. He stays at level 
par. And the weather seems to be easing off a tad. It’s still windy and rainy, 
but hey, it’s all relative.
 
We haven’t had a leaderboard for a while. Well, there’s a reason for that. But 
here’s what it looks like now. It’s what it’s going to look like at the end of 
the day, too.

-10: Mickelson (F)
-9: Stenson (F)
-7: Kjeldsen (F), Bradley (F)
-5: Z Johnson (F)
-4: Finau (F), Haas (F), Schwartzel (F), Johnston (F), Garcia (F)
-3: Na (F), Kuchar (F), Kaymer (F), Cabrera-Bello (F)

The highest-placed player out on the course right now is Rickie Fowler at -2. 
And if he doesn’t rake home a long putt from the front of 15, he’ll be sharing 
that status with Rory McIlroy and Richard Sterne at -1. It’s fair to say those 
out late yesterday and early today got the best of the draw. Hey, it’s part of 
the Open Championship’s unique charm.
 
Spieth finds the heart of 16 in regulation. His long birdie putt stays wide 
left, and he very nearly misses the four-footer he leaves himself, but the left 
lip swallows it up. He’s still at +4, and even if he can only par home, he 
might survive if enough players out there drop shots. A scenario which, in this 
weather, is far from a pipe dream. Meanwhile Stricker ends up with a 
quadruple-bogey 8 on 15 after all those pars. Somewhere, Paul Azinger is 
wondering why something like that couldn’t have happened to Nick Faldo at 
Muirfield in 1987.
 
A brilliant tee shot into the par-three 14th from Bubba, a draw helped to six 
feet by the wind. He knocks it in for a birdie that takes him back to +4 and 
keeps his hopes of weekend participation alive. If he harbours those hopes, of 
course. I’m assuming nothing. McIlroy finds the front of the green, meanwhile, 
and takes two putts for a rare par. He’s still -1.
 
Steve Stricker isn’t going to par his way home, Nick Faldo style. He carded 14 
in a row, but sent his tee shot, then a provisional, then another provisional 
into the thick rough down the right of the long par-four 15th. After a long 
search, he eventually found his second ball, so was chipping back out on to the 
fairway for four. More as we have it.
 
Another dropped shot for McIlroy, his fourth bogey in five holes. He’s in the 
thick of the weather, just as he was when shooting 80 on the second day of the 
2010 Open. He might have drawn the short straw a year later at Sandwich, too, 
if memory serves. This time he hits a heavy chip into 13, expecting strong wind 
to hold it up, only for that very wind to drop. He’s -1, and looks to have 
mentally checked out. In some ways, you can’t blame him: the conditions put the 
rating X into extreme. On the other hand, Rickie Fowler is battling hard in the 
face of adversity: pars at 13 and 14 since his dropped shot at 12, and he stays 
at -2.
 
A clumsy pitch into 15 has cost Jordan Spieth another shot. He’s back to +4, 
just the wrong side of the projected cut. The weather is utterly filthy, 
though, so with plenty of players still out there, providing he doesn’t suffer 
too much himself, he might survive. That’s a big if, though. He hoicks his tee 
shot at 16 into the thick rough down the left. He had been expecting help from 
a crosswind, but he got nothing. “Aw come on! If I hit that shot on the last 
hole, it’d have ended up on the road!” He grins at the absurdity of it all, 
taking it in good spirits. The wind is ludicrous, to be fair, oscillating 
between 20mph and 30mph at the drop of a hat. Can you hear that warm crackle? 
That’sPhil Mickelson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/phil-mickelson> and 
Henrik Stenson, drawing on their cigars.
 
Rory in a greenside bunker at 12. He can only just get his ball out of the wet 
sand, leaving himself too much to do with the par putt. He’s back to -2, and 
the wheels of his challenge are beginning to clank off. He was within five 
strokes of Mickelson less than an hour ago. The weather is awful, but that 
wasn’t a factor for his first two bogeys of the day.
 
Steve Stricker is on a run. Of pars. He’s now made it 14 in a row by tickling 
one in from ten feet. He stays at -4. On the other end of the scale, here’s 
Louis Oosthuizen. He started the day at level par. He’s now +12. What’s mainly 
happened there is a nine at the Railway hole. Yesterday’s hole in one seems an 
awfully long time ago now. Meanwhile an interview on Sky with the extremely 
modest and likeable Zach Johnson. They’ve just pointed out that the only other 
men who have won the Masters and an Open at St Andrews are Tiger Woods, Nick 
Faldo, Seve, Jack Nicklaus and Sam Snead. That’s pretty astonishing company to 
be keeping, and Johnson’s voice cracked as he admitted: “I’m speechless. How 
can you not be in awe?”

The weather’s getting up, and it’s pretty dark at the moment. The Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/theopen>. Summer in Scotland. Right here. 
Day and Fowler are both unable to scramble pars after missing 12 in regulation. 
They’re back to level par and -2 respectively.
 
Spieth starts his comeback quest in magnificent fashion, sending his tee shot 
at 14 to six feet. In goes the birdie putt, and he’s +3. The old (ahem) Jordan 
Spieth is back! Rory, from the centre of 11, sends a marvellous second into the 
middle of the green. He’ll have a look at repairing some of the damage of 9 and 
10 from 18 feet. But it slides by to the right and he’ll have to settle for 
par. But he’s steadied the ship a little, if nothing else. But it’s a double 
bogey for Bubba, who drops to +4. Meanwhile Patrick Reed responded to bogeys at 
8, 10, 11, 15 and 16 with a big rake for birdie across 17. He’s very close to 
curling in a 30-footer on 18, too, but he’ll settle for par. A 74 today, and 
he’s -2 at the halfway mark.

Redington/Getty Images  
Spieth very nearly holes a 25-footer across 13 for a much-needed birdie. But 
it stays on the high side. Holes are running out if he wants to save himself. A 
couple of birdies should do it. One, possibly, if the weather that’s coming in 
- higher winds and rain - has any sort of effect.
 
Rory is unravelling. He plays 10 straight down the middle. Pin high, 25 feet 
away, he races his birdie effort three feet past. And he pushes the par putt 
wide right. That’s two super-short ones missed in a row, and it’s back-to-back 
bogeys. He stomps off the green moaning quite a lot. He’s back to -3, and needs 
to calm down. He’s jittery and fuming, which is not a good combo. Mind you, 
there’s problems, and there are problems. Bubba had missed a short one at 10 
too, and at +2 he’s skirting with the cut. (That’s moved out to +3, by the 
way.) And now the big-driving lefty has hoicked his drive at 11 onto the 
railway track. He’s in trouble now. Rory splits the fairway.
 
Spieth is extremely fortunate not to lose his drive in a gorse bush down the 
left of 12.He’s flaying the ball off the tee box like Seve. It’s a heavy lie, 
though, and he shouts in response to a stab of pain in his wrist as he punches 
back onto the fairway. He punches his third in low, hoping to send it 
scampering towards the hole. But it stops 30 feet short, and his attempt to 
salvage the situation with his putter is always dying left. Another bogey, and 
the 2015 Masters and US Open champion is in serious trouble now at +4.
 
Fowler sends a wild one towards the 10th green, up a bank to the left, and 
can’t get up and down. He’s back to -3. Day pars to stay at -1. Byeong Hun An 
is a dimple away from knocking in a short eagle putt on 16, but a birdie seems 
scant reward for knocking his second at the par-five to six feet. Meanwhile 
arguably the shot of the day from the 2011 champion Darren Clarke, who is wide 
of the 18th fairway, and sends his second from 150 yards bouncing straight 
towards the hole, stopping six inches short. The birdie brings him to +1, and 
ensures he’ll be here for the weekend!

 
Rory reaches the middle of the big 9th green in two. He lags up to a couple of 
feet, then inexcusably misses the par putt. That’s another costly loss of 
concentration. He wanders off with black plumes of steam coming out of both 
lugs: with 10 and 11 coming up, the last thing you want is to be shedding silly 
shots. He’s back to -4. He skelps a 3-wood down the track at 10, a fine, if 
rather frustrated, response.
 
Spieth finds the centre of 11 with his second, but his mid-range birdie putt 
dies to the left. It’s not a bad miss, but he reacts as though he’s just missed 
a tiddler. Nothing wrong with having high standards, for sure, but he’ll give 
himself high blood pressure at this rate. He stays at +3. Meanwhile Byeong Hun 
An is going well: par through the front nine, but birdies at 11 and 14. He’s -3 
overall. Scott Hend’s charge has slowed a tad, incidentally: a bogey at 8 was 
followed by a double at 10, and though he’s just picked one up again at 12, 
he’s down the leaderboard a bit now at -2.
 
Par for Day on 9, and he’s reached the turn in 33. He’s -1, and walking with a 
spring in his step. He knows he’s not out of this yet. Rickie Fowler follows 
him in, and he turns in 34, at -4. He’s very much in position. But Patrick Reed 
continues to move in the wrong direction. Another bogey, this time at 15, and 
he’s three over for his round, -2 overall. His compatriot Billy Horschel has 
doubled 7 to drop to -2. But Steve Stricker has reached the turn in a 
Faldoesque 36, nine pars, and the veteran grinder is hanging on in there at -4.
 
Spieth’s struggles continue. He’s all over the place, a strange mix of 
nonsense and brilliance. He drives into the thick rubbish down the right of 10, 
and sends his second down the huge bank to the right of the green. But from a 
tight lie, he chips up close, and for a second hole in a row, scrambles an 
unlikely par. “He’s not totally switched on,” says the Sky pundit Nick Faldo. 
But he’s not giving up, either, despite being the wrong side of the cut line at 
+3. He sends his drive at 11 whistling worryingly to the right, but it takes a 
kind bounce in the semi-rough and makes its way onto the fairway. Could that 
little break send his round in a different direction too?
 
So Rory, having reached the upper echelons of the leaderboard, plops his ball 
in the Coffin bunker at the Postage Stamp.Danger ahoy! But he clips the ball so 
gently off the wet sand, landing it on the edge of the green and letting the 
down slope do the work. The ball rolls to three feet, and that’s a great par 
save. Not quite as spectacular as Bubba’s scramble: he’s in the Spieth Bunker 
on the other side, and instead of taking a couple to get out, he swishes 
serenely under the ball, sending it smoothly bouncing towards the hole and 
pinging off the flagstick. It should drop in for birdie, but he’ll not complain 
about the par.

Forgot to mention that Danny Willett also birdied 7 while Day and Fowler were 
about their business. Not that it matters too much, because he plugged his ball 
in the bunker to the right of the Postage Stamp, and after taking a couple to 
find the green, two-putted for a double bogey. The Masters champion is +3 now, 
and in all sorts of cut-related bother. 2016’s not going to be his year for 
Open glory, but he’ll always have that verdant sports jacket. Meanwhile it’s 
back-to-back birdies for McIlroy! He chips up from the edge of 7 to six feet. 
Not ideal, as he leaves himself a snaky slider, but he thinks long and hard 
before knocking it in. Look at this leaderboard now!

-10: Mickelson (F)
-9: Stenson (F)
-7: Kjeldsen (F), Bradley (F)
-5: Z Johnson (F), McIlroy (7)
 
This is heating up again nicely, after a bit of a lull. Rory and Bubba nearly 
drive the green at the par-four 7th. On the putting surface, Jason Day and 
Rickie Fowler drain birdie putts while smiling quite a lot. They’re enjoying 
themselves, and no wonder: that’s three birdies in a row for Day, who is -1 
overall, and it’s the second birdie of the round for the links student Fowler, 
who is as high as -4 now.
 
Jordan Spieth might be struggling a little this week, but he wasn’t a two-time 
major winner at the age of 21 for nothing.He’s just wanged a hilariously poor 
second shot towards the 9th green. Or more specifically up a bank to the left. 
But from the tightest of spots, he’s bumped a pitch down to a couple of feet, 
and he’ll escape with a much-needed ship-steadying par. A class act, even if 
Troon’s not been his best pal this week. He’s out in 39, +3 overall. Bogey for 
Rose, though, and he’s reached the turn in 40. He’s +1, and it’s been a painful 
couple of hours for Hampshire’s finest. Meanwhile back on 6, McIlroy makes a 
very steady bogey. Drive up the middle, fairway wood up the middle, chip into 
the heart of the green, 15 footer into the cup. Easy as that. He’s suddenly in 
a competitive position at -4!
 
Jason Day might be struggling a little this week, but he isn’t world number 
one for nothing. The PGA champion is on the front fringe of the par-five 6th in 
three, facing a long snaking putt up the green. It’s always going in, from the 
second it left his putter. A magic moment, and one that might kick-start a move 
up the leaderboard. He’s level par now, and that’s his third birdie in the last 
four holes. Meanwhile the man who started this whole thing off - Colin 
Montgomerie - has just bogeyed the last hole and will sign for a 75. He ends 
his tournament at +4, and will spend the weekend in the commentary box. His 
loss is our gain; he’s a great pundit. And that’s because of, rather than 
despite, his eccentricities. Good old Monty.
 
Disaster for Spieth on the Postage Stamp. He splashes out of the sand on the 
right, over the high face, but can only land his ball on the slope that gathers 
the ball back towards the same grainy trouble. He’s got more space to escape 
with his second attempt, firing the ball towards the Coffin on the other side, 
but using the slope in front of that trap to guide the ball back towards the 
target. He’s still got a ten-footer for bogey, mind. Even if he gets this, he’s 
below the projected cut line. Well, he can’t make it. It’s his first double 
bogey of the week, and he’s in a bit of bother now at +3.

Rory bumps a chip up to six feet from the front of 5, and once again scrambles 
his par. His partners? Matsuyama, having found the green front left, rolls in 
for a much-needed birdie: he’s level par again. But Bubba can only slash out 
from the bunker into the middle of the green. He can’t roll the 15-foot par 
saver, and after birdie at 4, he’s back to +1 again. Meanwhile Spieth’s bump up 
to 7 isn’t all that, but he rattles in a staunch par putt. He stays at +1, 
though for how long? On the Postage Stamp, he sends his tee shot to the right 
and into the deep bunker. He’s found an awful lot of sand today.
 
On 7, there’s more trouble for Spieth, who drives into filth down the right. 
He can only hack it back out to the fairway, short of the green. He’ll need a 
crisp chip and putt to save his par. Meanwhile on the par-three 5th, Bubba 
sends his tee shot into a bunker to the left, and starts effin’ and jeffin’ in 
the grand style. More in resignation than exasperation, mind you. He’s giving 
off the air of a man who can’t be bothered any more. Maybe he can’t be bothered 
any more. Then Rory steps up, and lands his tee shot 30 yards short of the 
green! Some of the biggest names in world golf are all over the shop right now.
 
McIlroy narrows his eyes and chips up to four feet. That’s going to save his 
skin on this hole. A par, and he remains at -3. Rickie Fowler has followed up 
his opening birdie with four pars; he stays at -3 too. Jason Day picks up 
another stroke with a birdie two at 5; he’s now got his head above the 
projected cut line at +1. Meanwhile the Masters champion Danny Willett 
completes a trio of pars in that marquee group, though having bogeyed 1 and 4, 
he’s struggling at +2.
 
A lot of addled heads right now. Rory is standing in the middle of the 4th 
fairway, in prime position. He’s irritated by having to wait for a marshal to 
rake a bunker. Rattled, he slices a fairway wood into thick filth down the 
right. That’ll be a test of mettle. If they can find the ball. Ah yes, they 
can. But he can only punch back out on to the fairway. He’ll need to get up and 
down from 50 yards if he’s to save par. Meanwhile up on 6, Spieth splashes out 
from the bunker to five feet, not a bad result at all, but he’s shaking his 
head in irritation. Clearly he’s not trusting himself to tidy up. And he’d be 
right: a meek prod to the right of the hole, and he’s back to +1 again. Patrick 
Reed has dropped another one, this time at 10, to slip back into the big pack 
at -4. He’s joined there by the altogether happier Scott Hend, for the 
42-year-old Australian journeyman is heading in the other direction, and at 
some speed: birdies at 1, 3, 4 and now 6. What a run!
 
Bubba isn’t in the best of moods, a legacy of that dreadful tiddler he missed 
on the opening hole no doubt. He’s dropped another shot, this time at 3, so 
he’s +1 and in danger of missing the cut if he’s not careful. Sky Sports just 
tracked the flight of his drive on 4, and the wind is playing havoc with his 
big boomers. Imagine the top of a treble clef. Well, that. Jordan Spieth is 
also out of sorts: hitting what looks like a simple wedge into the par-five 
6th, he chunks it in a bunker well short of the green. He turns to give his 
caddy an incredulous look: this sort of thing just doesn’t happen to him. He 
seemed happy enough with his long game yesterday, blaming his relatively poor 
score on his putter. Well, it’s been a mixed bag at best today.

Rory split the fairway at 3. He should have gone close with his wedge in, but 
could only find the back of the green, a careless mistake. He still wasn’t too 
far away from draining the long putt coming back, but the birdie effort didn’t 
drop. He stays at -3. Patrick Reed has reached the turn in a fairly uneventful 
36 strokes: one birdie, one bogey. A marked contrast to yesterday’s 31, but 
then feel that wind tickling your collar. There hasn’t been much movement at 
the top of the leaderboard, then. But let’s remind ourselves where we are:

-10: Mickelson (F)
-9: Stenson (F)
-7: Kjeldsen (F), Bradley (F)
-5: Z Johnson (F), Reed (9)

It’s been a disastrous start for Justin Rose. He missed a short par putt on 
the opening hole, and now a double at the 4th - another short one prodded past 
the hole with great uncertainty - has him more worried about the cut than the 
lead. Already three over for his round, he’s clanked back down to level par. 
Louis Oosthuizen has bogeyed 6 to drop to +1. The world number one Jason Day 
bogeyed the opening hole, but he’s bounced back with birdie at 3, though at +2 
he needs a couple more if he’s to be here at the weekend for sure. And Jordan 
Spieth pulls an appalling tee shot into one of the bunkers front left of the 
par-three 5th. A lot of big names with furrowed brows right now.
 
McIlroy will have annoyed himself by missing that good birdie chance on 1, but 
he doesn’t need to force things. At 2, and with the wind up, he opts to find 
the centre of the green instead of going for the flag, and let his putter do 
the work. Wise move: he rolls a straight 25-footer into the cup, one of those 
that was always going in from the moment it left the face of the club. He’s -3. 
Jordan Spieth will be back to level par after a cute chip over bunkers that 
screeched to a halt a couple of feet by the flag at the par-five 4th. But 
Patrick Reed found the bunker to the right of the Postage Stamp, and that’s a 
bogey that brings him back down to -5.
 
Thanks Niall. So while Bubba’s astonishing twitchy miss on the opening hole 
was somehow predictable - he didn’t look comfortable over it, and was up and 
out of the stroke almost before he made contact - Jordan Spieth’s miss on 3 is 
a little more shocking.From the centre of the fairway, he’d clipped his second 
to five feet, and a birdie seemed on the cards. But it lipped out. Can you 
remember him missing anything from within, I dunno, 15 feet during 2015? No, me 
neither. But this is happening quite regularly at the moment. He doesn’t quite 
have the same certainty. I guess that’s what blowing up at Augusta does to a 
man. He stays at +1, which is only a shot above the projected cut, so he’ll 
need to watch himself here. Other pre-tournament favourites currently flirting 
with danger: Danny Willett, Hideki Matsuyama and Branden Grace. This will be a 
very interesting afternoon.

The wind picking up all over the course now, which will be of particular 
concern to the thoroughbreds heading along the coast-hugging front nine. 
Patrick Reed has been Mr Consistent so far – five pars and one birdie in his 
opening six. Fowler birdies the first after an excellent approach shot, and 
McIlroy, playing into the wind, follows suit. He lands his second shot on the 
front edge of the green, within range of the pin. It’s a presentable chance 
that McIlroy ends up pushing wide. He’ll settle for par, while Watson drops a 
shot with a stinker of a short par putt.

Time to hand back to your very own Scott Murray...
 
With the wind whistling across the 18th, García and Bradley finish off their 
rounds. Sergio undercooks his putt, apparently not taking the wind into account 
at all – and gets himself in an awful mess, three-putting to pick up a bogey, 
and drop back to four under par. Oh, Sergio... Meanwhile, Bradley pars to 
finish three under for the day, seven under for the week, and very much in 
contention.
 
Fowler, Day and Masters champ Danny Willett are teeing off at the 1st. Fowler 
begins two under, Willett even par, and Day two over, close to the projected 
cut. Plenty of time though. At the second, Spieth again misjudges his approach 
to the green, picking out a tricky bunker – but rescues the situation with an 
expert chip out of trouble. Lowry lands back-to-back birdies in his bid to make 
the cut – the Irishman is up to five over par.
