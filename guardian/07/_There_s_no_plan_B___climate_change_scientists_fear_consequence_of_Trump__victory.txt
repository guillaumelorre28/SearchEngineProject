As news of Donald Trump’s victory reached Marrakech on Wednesday, the many 
thousands of diplomats, activists, youth and business groups gathered in the 
city for theUN’s annual climate conference 
<http://unfccc.int/meetings/marrakech_nov_2016/meeting/9567.php> were left in 
shock and disbelief that the US could elect a climate-change denier as 
president.

Some of the younger activists were in tears. “My heart is absolutely broken at 
the election of Trump,” said Becky Chung, a delegate for youth advocacy group
SustainUS <http://sustainus.org/> from California.

“We will see a rising-up of people’s movements committed to mass civil 
disobedience to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The next four years will be 
critical. We have to get to zero emissions by 2050,” she said.

The delegates from nearly 200 countries, many of whom had spent 20 years 
negotiating the complex Paris agreement that aims to limit global warming to a 
1.5°C rise, were tightlipped but clearly nervous. The US delegation went into a 
huddle, meetings were cancelled and talk centred on whether Trump would fulfil
his often-repeated threat to withdraw the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/09/us-election-result-throws-paris-climate-deal-into-uncertainty>
 from theUN’s Paris agreement 
<http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climatechange/> – blitzing decades of 
fraught but ultimately successful global negotiations.

“No one thought this could happen. Everyone here is in shock,” said 
Bangladeshi scientist and diplomatSaleemul Huq 
<http://www.iied.org/users/saleemul-huq>. “No one had anticipated this result 
and, hence, there was no plan B. We will have to think about what happens next.”

Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs, Salaheddine Mezouar, the meeting’s 
president, put on a brave face. “We are convinced that all parties will respect 
their commitments and stay the course in this collective effort,” he said.

But few people agreed with him because Trump has consistently denied 40 years 
of climate science – and he claims that manmade global warming is a Chinese 
hoax. Ditching the Paris treaty, he has said, is his number one environmental 
priority.

Withdrawal from the treaty, which was crafted over years by US diplomats, 
often against developing countries’ wills, would take four years to complete 
and would outrage world opinion. Many delegates in Marrakech privately think it 
more likely that a new US administration would choose to ignore it. Because the 
Paris treaty is voluntary, the US would face global opprobrium, but no 
sanctions or fines.

Instead of reducing US emissions by a quarter to 28% below 2005 levels by 
2025, as the US has pledged, Trump would support US coal, gas and fracking and 
halt payments aimed to help developing countries adapt to rising sea levels and 
temperatures. The result would be to increase US emissions, set back attempts 
to hold temperatures to a 2°C rise by years and, say businesses and activists, 
put a brake on the world’s renewable energy industries and consign poor 
countries to deeper poverty.

The UN, privately rattled but publicly calm in Marrakech, fervently hopes that 
the reality of power, diplomatic pressure and business self-interest will keep 
Trump in the fold. At stake, say officials, is not just the treaty but the 
whole UN system, which is based on consensus between countries.

Erik Solheim, head of the UN environment programme, told the Observer that 
Trump’s pragmatism and business sense was likely to score over ideology. “It’s 
clear there is uncertainty because of some of the statements made before the 
election. But I am certain we have crossed the Rubicon. There is no way back on 
climate change,” he said.

Should the US leave the treaty, Solheim says that some of the biggest losers 
would be America’s working people. “They would lose out on all the new green 
jobs. It would be a huge lost opportunity for the US people. The thinking that 
climate is a cost is wrong. It is a business opportunity,” he said.

Other diplomats and politicians claim that the US would lose important allies 
if it chose to become the world’s only climate rogue nation. “Trump has to 
acknowledge the reality of climate change. He has a responsibility as 
president-elect now,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy at the Union of 
Concerned Scientists.

The deep fear in Marrakech is that US opposition to the Paris agreement would 
signal to other countries that they need not meet their voluntary pledges, with 
the result that global emissions would soar and climate change could become 
unstoppable.

Withdrawal would also undermine relations with China. “Climate co-operation 
between the US and China will need a new strategy with new priorities and 
highlights,” said Zou Ji, deputy director general of China’s national centre 
for climate change strategy.

Developing countries were particularly nervous last week because Trump has 
also vowed to stop contributions to theGreen Climate Fund 
<https://www.greenclimate.fund/home>, set up by the UN to distribute an 
eventual $100bn a year to help them reduce emissions and adapt their 
infrastructure to climate change. The US, which is expected to be the biggest 
contributor to the fund, has pledged $4bn over four years.

Greenpeace international co-directors Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid 
said: “We will not give up. We will work even harder and invite people to join 
this powerful movement. The stakes for current and future generations are too 
high and time is too short.”

As the Marrakech meeting prepared to enter its second week, with the arrival 
of ministers from 200 countries, Jean Su of the US Center for Biological 
Diversity sought to quell fears: “I do believe that climate progress will not 
crash and burn because of one single man who was elected yesterday …. One 
single man cannot ruin a whole 20 years of progress on climate change.”

Michael Brune, director of the Sierra Club, the US’s largest environment 
group, was adamant. “It would be very difficult for Trump to remove the US from 
the Paris agreement. If he tries to ... he will run headlong into an organised 
mass of people who will fight him in the courts, in the marketplace, and in the 
streets.”
