When it comes to great British sports, barbecuing in the rain is right up 
there with aggressive queueing and passive-aggressive apologising as something 
we are born to do. Battling the elements, we tell each other as we tog up, is 
all part of the fun – but this summer is testing even my fondness for grilling 
in Gore-Tex.

However bad the weather gets, don’t bring your barbecue into the garage or 
even the kitchen; carbon monoxide poisoning is much, much worse than wet feet. 
If you don’t happen to have an overhanging roof to keep things dry but well 
ventilated, invest in a large umbrella that will cover both you and the grill – 
a sturdy parasol will do the job, and free up your hands to turn the food and 
drink the beer. Where there’s rain there’s often wind, too, so make sure it’s 
well weighted down, or you could get a lot wetter once the fire brigade turns 
up. In really gusty conditions, position your barbecue at 90 degrees to the 
prevailing gale.

If you’re in the market for a new model, a kettle barbecue with a 
tight-fitting lid is a wise investment to keep the heat in and the water out. 
Bear in mind that whichever sort you have, rain will bring the temperature 
down, so it’s wise to add a little more charcoal than you usually would. Food 
will take longer to cook, and I find it’s also easier to burn things – mostly 
because I’m so reluctant to open the lid to check on them.

If the weather looks uncertain, it’s better to have something that can either 
be cooked in advance and finished on the barbecue, as in the ribs recipe below, 
or that doesn’t require searing heat, such as the peppers. Save the steak and 
seafood for another day, and concentrate instead on stuff that can be cooked 
low and slow without too much interference from the chef; this is the time to 
break out the brisket, and make the most of side dishes that can be prepared in 
the kitchen.

Sometimes, however, even the stoutest Brit has to admit defeat and head 
indoors. Happily, these recipes have been designed to be just as good whether 
you’re inside or out.

Inspired by the smoky, sweet-and-sour flavours of the Syrian muhammara dip, 
the ingredients for this warm, chargrilled pepper salad work equally well as a 
warming soup should the weather turn on you. It is vegan-friendly, but also 
good with feta to make a more substantial meal.

(Serves 4 as a starter or light meal, 2 as a main)
8 large pointed red peppers
4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to grease
100g walnut pieces
4 pitta, cut into triangles
2 (salad)/4 (soup) smallish garlic cloves, crushed
1 tbsp dried Aleppo chilli flakes, or 1 tsp hotter chilli flakes
1 (salad)/2 (soup) tsp ground cumin
1l vegetable stock (soup only)
2 tbsp pomegranate molasses
1 tbsp lemon juice
Small bunch of coriander, roughly chopped (or you can pick the leaves and 
leave them whole if you prefer, to make the salad look prettier)

To make the soup, heat the oven to maximum, and put the peppers on a lightly 
greased tray. Pierce in a couple of places, then roast until blackened in parts 
and beginning to collapse. Take out of the oven and replace with the walnuts 
and pitta triangles. Bake for about five minutes until toasted, then set aside. 
Seed and roughly chop the peppers.

Heat the remaining oil in a large pan over a medium-low heat and fry the 
garlic for a minute or so, then stir in the spices and cook for 30 seconds. Add 
the peppers, cook briefly, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, then turn 
down the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, roughly chop the 
nuts.

Add the walnuts to the pan, then liquidise the soup until smoothish (you can 
pass it through a sieve if you’re very particular). Stir in the pomegranate 
molasses and lemon juice and season to taste, adding more of either if required.

Serve garnished with coriander, with the pitta triangles on the side.

To make the salad, put the peppers on a hot barbecue and cook, turning, until 
blackened all over. At the same time, put a pan on the grill and toast the 
walnuts until slightly browned, and the pitta until crunchy.

Whisk together the garlic, spices, molasses, lemon juice and olive oil, and 
season to make a tangy dressing; taste and adjust quantities if necessary.

Seed the peppers and cut into thick strips. Scatter over a platter and pour 
over the dressing, then top with the walnuts, pitta and coriander.

These are great with potato salad if the weather is kind, or buttery mash if 
it’s not. Short ribs can be found in many supermarkets these days, but a 
butcher will always be able to get you some.

(Serves 4)
1l hoppy, crisp beer (I used an IPA)
6-8 thick beef short ribs, depending on appetite, with a good amount of meat 
on them
2 tbsp oil
2 onions, sliced
6 tbsp wholegrain mustard
2 tbsp ketchup

Pour the beer into a wide pan, bring to the boil, then simmer rapidly for 
about 15 minutes until reduced by half. Meanwhile, pat the ribs dry with 
kitchen towel and season. Heat the oil over a medium-high heat in a wide, 
heavy-based pan with a lid, and brown the ribs in batches. Set aside, turn down 
the heat a little and cook the onions until soft and golden. Scoop out of the 
pan and set aside.

Add the reduced beer and mustard to the pan and stir to dislodge any bits of 
meat from the bottom, then put in the ribs, meaty-side downwards (you may need 
to separate them to fit). Cover tightly and simmer over a low heat for 90 
minutes, then add the onions and simmer for another hour, or until the meat on 
the ribs is tender.

Scoop out the ribs and onion with a slotted spoon. At this point, if you’re 
making the dish in advance, you can refrigerate the sauce to make it easier to 
lift off the fat. If not, then spoon off as much as possible. (You’ll also need 
to reheat the ribs if you’re cooking in advance and not barbecuing; this is 
best done tightly covered with foil in a medium oven.)

If you’re planning to barbecue the ribs, reduce the sauce until thick, then 
stir in the ketchup. Put the ribs on a medium-hot barbecue until charred all 
over, then slather with the sauce and cook for another few minutes, until it 
has formed a sticky crust. Warm up the remainder of the sauce with the onions 
and spoon on top.

If you’re cooking indoors, reduce the sauce until thick and glossy, and stir 
in the ketchup and the onions. Cut the meat into chunks, discarding the bones, 
or shred if you prefer, then serve with the sauce.
