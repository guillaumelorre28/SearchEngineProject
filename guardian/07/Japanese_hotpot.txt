Fiendishly easy to make, these simple flavours form a fresh, nutritious hotpot 
– nothing like the heavier Lancashire version.

Serves 6

400g sticky or jasmine rice
2 tsp red chilli, chopped 
3 garlic cloves, sliced thinly
A thumb of ginger, trimmed and chopped
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
300g bok choy, quartered through the root
400g tofu, cut into 3cm cubes
150g shitake mushrooms, sliced
A head of broccoli, cut into florettes, which are then halved
⅓ daikon radish (AKA mouli), peeled and sliced into matchsticks
3 spring onions, sliced long and thin
2 tbsp miso paste
2 tsp light soy sauce
Juice of 2-3 limes
Handful of coriander, roughly chopped

1 First, get your rice going, then put the kettle on again with around a litre 
of water in it (for the miso).2 In a little bowl, mix the chopped chilli, 
garlic, ginger and sesame seeds.3 Choose a saucepan large enough to hold all of 
the ingredients with a little room to spare, then make layers of the bok choy, 
tofu, mushrooms, broccoli and daikon, sprinkling a little of the 
chilli-ginger-garlic-sesame mix in between each layer.4 Dissolve the miso in a 
litre of nearly boiling water from the kettle.5 Add the spring onions to the 
pan, then pour in the miso and cover with a lid.6 Turn the heat up to high. 
When it comes to the boil give it a two-minute simmer before turning it off.7 
Pour in the soy sauce and lime juice to season, and scatter with chopped 
coriander.8 Serve immediately, using a slotted spoon to share out the contents 
of the hotpot into bowls. Finish by ladling over some of the liquid. Serve the 
rice on the side.
