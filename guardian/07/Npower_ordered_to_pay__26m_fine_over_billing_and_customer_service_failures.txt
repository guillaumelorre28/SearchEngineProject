Energy supplier npower <https://www.theguardian.com/business/rwe-npower> has 
been fined £26m for sending out late and often inaccurate bills and failing to 
handle customer complaints effectively.

Watchdog Ofgem <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ofgem> said more than 
500,000 customers had been affected, with many suffering “significant distress 
and worry”, and has ordered the group to pay the fine as a consumer redress 
package.


The settlement is the largest agreed between Ofgem and a big six energy 
supplier.

 The money will be divided between some of the worst-affected customers and 
charity.

Ofgem’s action was welcomed by consumer groups. Richard Lloyd, executive 
director of Which? said: “Ofgem is right to dish out a hefty fine as npower has 
clearly failed its customers. Time and again we’ve found the biggest suppliers 
aren’t getting the basics right on customer service.”

Tom Lyon, from price comparison website uSwitch.com, said the scale of the 
record settlement “serves as a shot across the bows of the industry that 
consumers must be treated fairly.”

Ofgem said many of npower’s problems surfaced after the company, which is 
owned by the German group RWE, introduced a new IT system in 2011. Between 
September 2013 and December 2014, it issued over 500,000 lateenergy bills

inaccurate bills with little or no detail as to how these had been calculated.

During this period npower customers made over 2m complaints, with the majority 
about late or inaccurate bills. Ofgem said the company often failed to resolve 
these issues promptly, pursued debts that were in dispute and failed to keep 
its commitments to customers on billing.

It also failed to deal with complaints effectively because of failures with 
its IT system. Unresolved complaints were logged as resolved and multiple 
records created for one issue, creating follow-up problems for customers.

The supplier did not refer all customers to its complaint handling procedures 
and, in some cases, it failed to advise them that they could take their 
complaint to the Energy Ombudsman if unresolved after eight weeks.

Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: “Npower failed its customers. Not 
only have its billing and complaint handling procedures been chaotic, it 
treated many of its customers poorly, which is completely unacceptable.”

He added: “The payment of £26m sends a strong message to the industry that we 
expect them to act quickly and effectively to ensure a good customer 
experience.”

Npower apologised to customers and said it had agreed targets for improvement 
with the industry regulator

.

Simon Stacey, npower’s head of domestic markets, said: “We are very sorry 
about what has happened and that is why we have agreed this significant package 
of customer redress.”


He said the group had cut customer complaints by nearly 70% since the 
beginning of this year and, as part of the package of measures with Ofgem, had 
agreed targets for customer service improvement.

Npower said customers who were affected did not need to take any action as 
they would be contacted by the company.
