Market end day flat in Thanksgiving torpor

Thank goodness that’s over.

The day after a UK budget or autumn statement is often quiet in the market, as 
political reaction tends to dominate. Today’s been extra slow, thanks to our US 
cousins’ turkey-related activities.

So European stock markets have sloped lazily to the close of play.

The FTSE 100 finished 0.17% higher at 6829, with mining stocks among the 
risers but National Grid and easyJet both losing 2.3%.


The smaller FSTE 250 shed 0.18% -- dragged down by Countywide, which shed 
12.5% after today’s profits warning.

But Dominos Pizza had a good day, finishing 3% higher after hiking its 
long-store expansion total to 1,600, from 1,200. Britain’s love affair with 
takeaway pizza clearly isn’t over.

Elsewhere, Italy was the worst-performing major index -- worries over the 
constitutional referendum, and its banking sector, linger.

Conner Campbell of SpreadEx points out that today’s flurry of German data 
didn’t move the markets much:


The Eurozone indices were pretty drab this Thursday, the DAX and CAC managing 
a meagre 0.1% increase as the day went on. The impact of Germany’s measly 0.2% 
growth in Q3 seems to have been mitigated by a decent pair of business and 
consumer climate readings from the country; while they failed to improve 
month-on-month, the figures from the Ifo and Gfk at least suggestGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> wasn’t too bothered by the US 
election result.

The good news, though, is that Friday should be more exciting; we get the 
second estimate of UK growth in Q3, plus Black Friday retail action.GW

Fitch: Autumn statement shows negative impact of Brexit vote

Rating agency Fitch has just declared that Philip Hammond’s autumn statement 
shows that Britain’s economy will suffer from the vote to leave the EU.

In its first official reaction, Fitch says that the forecasts and spending 
plans outlined yesterday show that the task of bringing Britain’s debts under 
control has become even harder.

It also warned that Britain will suffer slower growth and weaker productivity 
if Brexit leads to new curbs on migrations (a point the OBR also made 
yesterday).


Fitch says:

The Chancellor’s Autumn Statement underlines the challenges for the UK 
government to stabilise the public debt trajectory in the context of heightened 
economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote, Fitch Ratings says.

Official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) point to a 
substantially lower path for economic growth compared to the pre-referendum 
projections underpinning the March budget. The OBR expects GDP growth to be 
cumulatively 1.4pp lower over its forecast period to 2021. Consumer price 
inflation will be higher due to a weaker exchange rate. The OBR also believes 
potential growth in the UK economy will be lower due to a combination of lower 
assumed productivity and falling net migration.

The official forecasts appear consistent with our view that the vote to leave 
the European Union in the referendum on 23 June will have a negative impact on 
the UK economy and public finances, as lower growth translates to lower 
expected tax receipts and higher spending on transfers.

Fitch says this justifies its decision to downgrade Britain’s credit rating to 
AA, the second highest rating, after the referendum.

The agency also welcomes Hammond’s decision to ditch the budget surplus target 
this parliament, and only try to get the deficit down to 2% of GDP.

We think this increases medium-term fiscal flexibility, and the OBR’s latest 
projections indicate that these new objectives will be met, and that the public 
sector debt ratio will peak in FY18. However, even if the public debt ratio 
peaks in the near term, any subsequent decline is likely to be slow, and the UK 
will still have one of the highest debt ratios among highly rated (AAA and AA) 
sovereigns.

IFS warns of biggest squeeze on pay for 70 years

Katie Allen

Here we go...

Workers in Britain face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a 
Brexit blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes inflation

That’s the official verdict from the Institute for Fiscal Studies’s analysis 
of the UK’s government’s latest tax and spending plans.

Having picked over Philip Hammond’s autumn statement, the IFS said real wages 
in the UK - pay adjusted for inflation - will still be below their 2008 level 
in 2021.

Paul Johnson, the thinktank’s director, says its the worst squeeze since the 
1930s:

“One cannot stress how dreadful that is - more than a decade without real 
earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the 
last 70 years.”

This is the second dire warning of the day -- this morning, the Resolution 
Foundation warned that the living standards squeeze will actually worsen over 
the next five years.

Shares in Countrywide Holdings have fallen to a record low after the estate 
agent hit investors with a profits warning.

It admitted that sales in London have slumped by 29% in the last quarter, 
blaming the Brexit effect and the recent hike in stamp duty.

This sent Countrywide shares sliding; they’re currently down 12.5% at 169p, 
following yesterday’s 6% slide (due to the government’s new clampdown on 
letting fees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/23/estate-agency-shares-letting-fees-foxtons-autumn-statement>
)

Anyone who took part in Countrywide’s stock market flotation in April 2013, at 
350p per share, must be fuming.

Countrywide itself fears that market conditions will stay tough; especially 
given the uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the EU.

Finance chief Jim Clarks says:

“No one can really show them what the future is. There’s a real lack of 
clarity on what post-Brexit Britain looks like.”

Consumer confidence in Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> has 
inched up this month, according to the latest healthcheck from GfK.

GfK reports that Germans are “more optimistic about overall economic 
prospects”, and a little more willing to spend.

That broadly matches the calm mood among business leaders this month (see 
earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/24/euro-low-german-slowdown-pound-italian-referendum-business-live?page=with:block-5836af08e4b0cc60d3476868#block-5836af08e4b0cc60d3476868>
).

But there’s a proviso.... the data was mainly collected before the US 
Presidential Election, so we can’t see if Trump’s victory has caused any 
worries.

Europe’s stock markets are showing all the verve and vigour of a Thanksgiving 
turkey today.

Britain’s FTSE 100 has dipped by 24 points to 6793; it’s been bobbing around 
these levels for a couple of weeks now.

Trading across the channel is just as languid - maybe traders are resentful 
that their US counterparts get the day off.
 Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Chris Beauchamp of IG blames American festivities for the lull:

The usual Thanksgiving calm has descended across markets, as European 
investors reconcile themselves to a day of low volumes and quiet trading.

With the US out of the picture currencies such as sterling and the euro have 
managed to recover and move higher, and while stock markets have recovered from 
yesterday’s lows there is still a sensation that there is not much more than 
hope to support valuations at current levels.

Turkey raises interest rates to 8%

Newsflash from Ankara: Turkey’s central bank has hiked its benchmark interest 
rate to 8%, from 7.5%.

The overnight lending rate has also been raised, to 8.5% from 8.25%.

This looks like an attempt to prop up the Turkish lira, which has fallen to 
record lows against the US dollar recently.

If so, it has done the trick - the lira has jumped by almost 1%.

Thank goodness that’s over.

The day after a UK budget or autumn statement is often quiet in the market, as 
political reaction tends to dominate. Today’s been extra slow, thanks to our US 
cousins’ turkey-related activities.

So European stock markets have sloped lazily to the close of play.

The FTSE 100 finished 0.17% higher at 6829, with mining stocks among the 
risers but National Grid and easyJet both losing 2.3%.


The smaller FSTE 250 shed 0.18% -- dragged down by Countywide, which shed 
12.5% after today’s profits warning.

But Dominos Pizza had a good day, finishing 3% higher after hiking its 
long-store expansion total to 1,600, from 1,200. Britain’s love affair with 
takeaway pizza clearly isn’t over.

Elsewhere, Italy was the worst-performing major index -- worries over the 
constitutional referendum, and its banking sector, linger.

Conner Campbell of SpreadEx points out that today’s flurry of German data 
didn’t move the markets much:


The Eurozone indices were pretty drab this Thursday, the DAX and CAC managing 
a meagre 0.1% increase as the day went on. The impact of Germany’s measly 0.2% 
growth in Q3 seems to have been mitigated by a decent pair of business and 
consumer climate readings from the country; while they failed to improve 
month-on-month, the figures from the Ifo and Gfk at least suggestGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> wasn’t too bothered by the US 
election result.

The good news, though, is that Friday should be more exciting; we get the 
second estimate of UK growth in Q3, plus Black Friday retail action.GW
 
Rating agency Fitch has just declared that Philip Hammond’s autumn statement 
shows that Britain’s economy will suffer from the vote to leave the EU.

In its first official reaction, Fitch says that the forecasts and spending 
plans outlined yesterday show that the task of bringing Britain’s debts under 
control has become even harder.

It also warned that Britain will suffer slower growth and weaker productivity 
if Brexit leads to new curbs on migrations (a point the OBR also made 
yesterday).


Fitch says:

The Chancellor’s Autumn Statement underlines the challenges for the UK 
government to stabilise the public debt trajectory in the context of heightened 
economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote, Fitch Ratings says.

Official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) point to a 
substantially lower path for economic growth compared to the pre-referendum 
projections underpinning the March budget. The OBR expects GDP growth to be 
cumulatively 1.4pp lower over its forecast period to 2021. Consumer price 
inflation will be higher due to a weaker exchange rate. The OBR also believes 
potential growth in the UK economy will be lower due to a combination of lower 
assumed productivity and falling net migration.

The official forecasts appear consistent with our view that the vote to leave 
the European Union in the referendum on 23 June will have a negative impact on 
the UK economy and public finances, as lower growth translates to lower 
expected tax receipts and higher spending on transfers.

Fitch says this justifies its decision to downgrade Britain’s credit rating to 
AA, the second highest rating, after the referendum.

The agency also welcomes Hammond’s decision to ditch the budget surplus target 
this parliament, and only try to get the deficit down to 2% of GDP.

We think this increases medium-term fiscal flexibility, and the OBR’s latest 
projections indicate that these new objectives will be met, and that the public 
sector debt ratio will peak in FY18. However, even if the public debt ratio 
peaks in the near term, any subsequent decline is likely to be slow, and the UK 
will still have one of the highest debt ratios among highly rated (AAA and AA) 
sovereigns.

Workers in Britain face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a 
Brexit blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes inflation

That’s the official verdict from the Institute for Fiscal Studies’s analysis 
of the UK’s government’s latest tax and spending plans.

Having picked over Philip Hammond’s autumn statement, the IFS said real wages 
in the UK - pay adjusted for inflation - will still be below their 2008 level 
in 2021.

Paul Johnson, the thinktank’s director, says its the worst squeeze since the 
1930s:

“One cannot stress how dreadful that is - more than a decade without real 
earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the 
last 70 years.”

This is the second dire warning of the day -- this morning, the Resolution 
Foundation warned that the living standards squeeze will actually worsen over 
the next five years.

Shares in Countrywide Holdings have fallen to a record low after the estate 
agent hit investors with a profits warning.

It admitted that sales in London have slumped by 29% in the last quarter, 
blaming the Brexit effect and the recent hike in stamp duty.

This sent Countrywide shares sliding; they’re currently down 12.5% at 169p, 
following yesterday’s 6% slide (due to the government’s new clampdown on 
letting fees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/23/estate-agency-shares-letting-fees-foxtons-autumn-statement>
)

Anyone who took part in Countrywide’s stock market flotation in April 2013, at 
350p per share, must be fuming.

Countrywide itself fears that market conditions will stay tough; especially 
given the uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the EU.

Finance chief Jim Clarks says:

“No one can really show them what the future is. There’s a real lack of 
clarity on what post-Brexit Britain looks like.”

Consumer confidence in Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> has 
inched up this month, according to the latest healthcheck from GfK.

GfK reports that Germans are “more optimistic about overall economic

That broadly matches the calm mood among business leaders this month (see 
earlier

But there’s a proviso.... the data was mainly collected before the US 
Presidential Election, so we can’t see if Trump’s victory has caused any 
worries.

Europe’s stock markets are showing all the verve and vigour of a Thanksgiving 
turkey today.

Britain’s FTSE 100 has dipped by 24 points to 6793; it’s been bobbing around 
these levels for a couple of weeks now.

Trading across the channel is just as languid - maybe traders are resentful 
that their US counterparts get the day off.

Chris Beauchamp of IG blames American festivities for the lull:

The usual Thanksgiving calm has descended across markets, as European 
investors reconcile themselves to a day of low volumes and quiet trading.

With the US out of the picture currencies such as sterling and the euro have 
managed to recover and move higher, and while stock markets have recovered from 
yesterday’s lows there is still a sensation that there is not much more than 
hope to support valuations at current levels.
 
This chart shows how German bosses have taken the triple-whammy of Brexit, 
Trump and lower growth in their stride this month.
