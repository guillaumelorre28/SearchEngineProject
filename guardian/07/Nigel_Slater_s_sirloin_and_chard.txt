The recipe

Put a large pan of water on to boil. Trim the stalks of 350g of rainbow chard 
and tear any large leaves into manageable pieces. Dunk the leaves into the 
boiling water and boil for 2 minutes until the colour is bright and the leaves 
have softened. Remove the leaves from the water and dip them into a bowl of 
ice-cold water.

Fry a couple of steaks, about 300g each in weight, in a shallow pan in a 
little olive oil until brown and crusty on the outside and pink within. Remove 
them from the pan, place them on warm plates, cover with foil and leave to rest.

Finely slice 2 large cloves of garlic. Melt 30g of butter in the steak pan and 
fry the garlic until it is pale gold and fragrant, then remove and add it to 
the steaks.

Add 2 tbsp of vincotto and 1 tbsp of white-wine vinegar to the pan, squeeze 
the chard leaves dry and add them to the pan as well, turning the leaves over 
in the dressing. Return the steaks to the pan and toss all the ingredients 
together before serving. Enough for 2.

The trick

Vincotto is a mellow, sweet sharp liquor made by reducing grape must over 
several hours. The flavour is not unlike balsamic vinegar, though the texture 
is thicker. Use it to deglaze the steak juices from the pan, but work quickly 
as it burns easily. As soon as it starts to bubble, add the squeezed, blanched 
chard leaves. This will remove much of their coarse and earthy bitterness. The 
steak will rest happily while you warm the chard, add it just before serving.

The twist

Use balsamic vinegar instead of the vincotto. Try a lamb steak instead of the 
sirloin. Spinach leaves – the large arrow-leaved variety rather than young, 
rounded salad leaves – will work in place of the chard.
