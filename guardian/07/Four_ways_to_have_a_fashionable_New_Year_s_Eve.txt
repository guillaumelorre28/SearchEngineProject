wherever you’ll be raising that glass.

A dinner party

You know the drill here – you arrive with the kind of raised-the-game look 
that is demanded of a special occasion and you finish up searching for your 
left shoe after a carpet disco, lipstick long faded on your mouth, as your Uber 
idles outside. The best rule of thumb is to be honest with yourself, and go 
with something that feels both dressed up and comfortable, that has 
over-the-table appeal (you will be sitting down most of the evening, remember) 
and is not really susceptible to spills as someone reaches over you for the 
wine bottle. Something likethis Finery dress 
<https://www.finerylondon.com/uk/products/myrtle-asymmetric-neck-jersey-dress?taxon_id=6>
 – being wine-coloured already – is perfect. Also, what with food involved in a 
dinner party, think eyeliner flicks rather than lipstick. It’s just kinder when 
the host is running late with dinner and you’re stuffing your face with Kettle 
Chips.

Staying in

Staying in on New Year’s isn’t sad – it’s the height of luxury. Or that’s what 
you’re telling people, anyway. The way to zhuzh up the same experience you have 
on every other occasion where you sit on your sofa and watch telly is to dress 
up. Honestly. The amount of time you feel daft for sitting in your living room 
in a party dress will be far outweighed by the fact that any FOMO will be 
significantly reduced, especially with the addition of a regularly filled glass 
of prosecco. Thisvelvet slip dress

 in duck-egg blue from Topshop is just the thing. Add heels and turn the 
heating up a tad. Now sit back, relax and watch the bells ring in 2017.

Going to a club

Congratulations! You’re going out out! Time for a proper look, right? Wrong. 
Everyone knows the coolest girl in the club is the one that doesn’t look as if 
she tried. Therefore anything on the athleisure/streetwear spectrum is your 
friend. And who knows this best? Rihanna. So, her Fenty range is well worth a 
look here –a long skirt 
<http://www.asos.com/puma/fenty-x-puma-by-rihanna-ribbed-maxi-skirt/prd/6767095?iid=6767095&clr=Blackwhite&SearchQuery=fenty%20x%20puma%20by>
 worn with a crop top, a sweatshirt with super-long sleeves, an XXXXL T-shirt, 
all accessorised (à la Riri, herself)with a glass of wine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/01/pour-it-up-rihannas-wine-chic> 
and trainers. Good for the queue, the dancefloor and – if the buses are full 
when you emerge at 3am – that long walk home.

A house party

Ah, the house party – such a unpredictable one. What’s behind the door? Bright 
lights, bowls of peanuts and small talk with the neighbours? Or banging tunes, 
flowing cocktails and ever more pathetic attempts at the mannequin challenge? 
The way to dress for this is the kind of outfit that covers all bases. Here, 
the little black dress is your friend – it’s a no-brainer but one you’ll be 
glad of if it’s more option one, and happy in whatevs if it’s two. Of course, 
if the colour is standard, there’s no need for the style to be – that would 
make you as boring as the aforementioned small talk. Head to Whistles for “I’m 
interesting, honest” takes on LBDs – from the shimmy-fringed flapper ones and 
crochet velvet shifts.This Dakota dress 
<http://www.whistles.com/women/clothing/dresses/dakota-velvet-dress-23737.html?dwvar_dakota-velvet-dress-23737_color=Black#prefn1=color&prefv1=Black&start=1>
, with spaghetti straps, is dressed up but won’t scare the horses (it’s also in
the sale <http://www.johnlewis.com/whistles-dakota-velvet-dress-black/p3059199> 
– bonus). Or if it’s the first scenario, the guy in the corner balancing a 
glass of chardonnay on his edge of his V-neck jumper.
