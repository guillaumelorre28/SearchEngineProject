Graeme Storm pipped Rory McIlroy in a play-off to win the South African Open, 
83 days after losing hisEuropean Tour

Storm was given a reprieve when Patrick Reed failed to play enough events to 
join the Tour and he made the most of his second coming in Johannesburg.

Starting the day three shots clear of the world No2, he almost buckled under 
the heat as McIlroy made five birdies in a final-round 68. But the Northern 
Irishman’s bogey on the par-three 17th teed up a play-off which the Hartlepool 
man took.

Storm held his nerve to sink a close-range putt after McIlroy had finished the 
first time they went back up the 18th hole but, when the Northern Irishman 
drove wildly the second time, he had a chance.

His first shot was not ideal either, though, following McIlroy into the rough, 
and back they went again.

The third time out, McIlroy’s second shot on the par-four was a poor one, 
falling short of the green, and a 45-foot putt from Storm that skipped just 
past allowed him to take a par.

When McIlroy failed from seven feet, the title was Storm’s – his second 
European Tour title and first since he won the French Open in 2007.
