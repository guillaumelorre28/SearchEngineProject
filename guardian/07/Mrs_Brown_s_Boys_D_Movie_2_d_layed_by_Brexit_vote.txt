Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Movie 2 has been delayed due to Brexit, according to the 
show’s creator, Brendan O’Carroll.

O’Carroll, who writes and stars as Agnes “Mammy” Brown, told the Sun 
<http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/mrs-browns-boys/42679/mrs-brown-s-boys-d-movie-2-in-doubt-after-brexit>
 that the sequel’s funding has become insecure thanks to the volatile 
post-Brexit market. “We were planning to do it this year, but the numbers 
weren’t right,” said O’Carroll. “The Brexit drop in sterling makes it a lot 
more expensive for the studio than it would have been previously.”

O’Carroll plans to make the film once the pound stabilises. “The plot and 
outline are there and ready to go,” he said. “We know what’s going to happen 
and how we’re going to do it.”

It is thought the vote to leave the European Union will have a wide-ranging 
impact on the British film industry, with co-productions between the UK and 
European partners complicated and funding –including a €130m (£105m) cash 
injection from the EU’s media programme

The first Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Movie film was a hit at the British box office, 
with the adaptation of the hit BBC1 sitcom pulling in £4.3m in its opening 
weekend, defying analyst’s expectations. It went on to take £28m.

O’Carroll had previously suggested the film would be the first of a trilogy

, one of which would put the focus on a new character, Mr Wang. Wang, a white 
man who thinks he’s Chinese, is also played by O’Carroll. The part was 
originally written for Burt Kwouk, who died earlier this year.

Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Movie received damning reviews from critics and has a 7% 
score from reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes. The Guardian’s Mike McCahill called 
the film“a flatly indifferent cash-in”
