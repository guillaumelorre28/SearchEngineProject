Australia win the Boxing Day Test and the series two-nil

Adam Collins

So that’s the lot from the MCG. A day where expectations were managed then 
exceeded as Australia plundered the runs required to declare before lunch and 
took the wickets required for an unlikely victory. In turn, they reclaim the 
trophy ceded to the Pakistanis in the UAE back in October 2014.

For the victors, captain Steve Smith comes away with an unbeaten and crucial 
century. It looked at times it would be for nothing, but he showed the control 
yesterday to keep the game moving along at a decent clip, then the extra gear 
this morning to set up all that came next.

Mitchell Starc’s four second-innings wickets followed his own enterprising 
hand of 84 with the bat, including seven sixes - a new MCG record. Not a bad 
effort considering they’ve played 108 Tests on the ground since 1877.

Australia’s talisman was especially potent in his final spell, returning to 
rip through Pakistan’s lower order with a masterclass of swing both 
conventional and reverse, just when it appeared the visitors had the reserves 
to save this game.

Nathan Lyon woke to reports of his imminent demise, but bowled with 
considerable drift, turn and flight in the middle session to gut the middle 
order, three wickets making the case for his retention.

All the while, Josh Hazlewood was superb, with a breakthrough to start both 
the second and third session. His 100th career wicket came earlier this match, 
and every performance highlights his prowess and seniority in this side.

Jackson Bird’s one wicket won’t look crucial on paper this afternoon, but it 
was a huge breakthrough in the context of the innings, looking the man most 
likely from the moment he was thrown the ball at the Members’ End. For the 
third Test in a row he’s justified selectors’ faith him him.

Speaking to the ABC, Steve Smith noted that “everything changed” in the squad 
after the Hobart debacle. Energy and enthusiasm, he cites for this. Whilst both 
hard to measure, it is equally hard to doubt the veracity. To win on a day like 
today requires supreme belief and everything to go right. Tick and tick.

So to Sydney we move, where a decent stint of selection speculation awaits. It 
is quite possible that the squad for the SCG Test starting on 3 January will be 
named in the next half hour or so when the Australian team front the media. 
With the series now in the bag, the temptation to use the fixture as a trial 
for India will surely be high. It’ll make for fascinating viewing.

And that’s just about enough from me. Be sure to read Russell Jackson’s report 
on the fifth day in the below link, I’m sure it’s a good’un. On behalf of 
Guardian’s over-by-over team from Melbourne, thanks very much for your company. 
Can’t wait to do it all again in Sydney. Goodnight.

The post-game, part two. 

Josh Hazlewood is on the radio as well before the formal proceedings, saying 
that he expects to play in Sydney. He says his body is fine and he doesn’t need 
a rest. To be fair, that’s what you say after winning a match like that.

Chris Rogers thinks they will go the “cautious approach” to ensure that they 
are right to go in India, especially Starc. “We can’t afford to see him go down 
before that tour.”

Misbah is first up on the mic at the presentation. “In Test cricket you have 
to win sessions. You need to bat and bowl well in both innings, and we are not 
managing to do that at the moment.” That sums it up.

Man of the Match is next. It has gone to Steve Smith for his unbeaten 165. “We 
thought if we could get the ball to reverse soon enough it would be hard work 
for them.” He says that started to become the case when Pakistan were five-down.

“We have still got a long way to go, we are still a new team, but it has been 
a great transition,” he adds. On his own game: “I love batting here at the 
MCG.” He sure does.

Team talk? “It’ll depend on the conditions.” He says that it has taken to spin 
at Sydney this year, so that’s the best hint we’ve got as far as two spinners 
are concerned. And that’s our fill from ground level. Back in a tic to wrap up.

The post-game, part one.

Chris Rogers says that Michell Starc should be Man of the Man, and Simon 
Katich agrees on the radio. A brisk 84 runs and four crucial wickets when 
Australia looked just about spent.

Starc is on the TV now, saying that the “belief was there” when they went out 
to bowl this afternoon. “If we took those chances, we knew we’d get ten chances 
today and it is a fantastic way to finish a Boxing Day Test.” It’s easy to 
forget that it was his first, come to think of it. A brilliant day at the 
office.

Starc goes on with ABC: “We are all a bit knackered, but it is all worth it.” 
He goes on to explain that the captain Smith wanted a lead of 140-180 before 
having another bowl. And that’s exactly what happened.

Nathan Lyon is on the telly now. He isn’t saying a lot, the usual “credit to 
all the boys.” He notes that it wasn’t taking lot of spin and he doesn’t mind 
who got the wickets. Line and length - understandable in the circumstances.

The ABC radio team have Lyon now. Did he feel under pressure? “To be honest, 
no, I think I’ve been bowling well all summer.” He points out that it has been 
hard graft for all spinners in Australia this summer.

Presentation coming up next.

WICKET! AUSTRALIA WIN BY AN INNINGS AND 18 RUNS! Yasir c Bird b Starc 0 
(Pakistan 163)

The last man Yasir gets a big, high leading edge and Jack Bird does the rest 
at mid-off. That’s a mighty win for the hosts, knocking over Pakistan inside 54 
overs and winning by an innings. Awful from the visitors. More on that later as 
we move into the post game. Stick with us.

53rd over: Pakistan 163-9 (Sohail 10, Yasir 0). Sohail drives Hazlewood down 
the ground to the rope with real panache. Good on him. The deficit is 18. 
Hazlewood follows up the only way appropriate by bouncing him. A nice defensive 
stroke ends the over as Umpire Gould calls out the drinks van. Enough time for 
one final plot twist? Hope so. Grab a glass of cordial.

52nd over: Pakistan 159-9 (Sohail 6, Yasir 0). A wicket-maiden from the very 
top draw, finishing with a full and straight delivery to the new man Yasir who 
does enough to defend it back to Starc. Australia are going to win by an 
innings here after Pakistan made 443-9 declared in their first dig.

WICKET! Wahab b Starc 0 (Pakistan 159-9)

It was bound to happen just like that. After twice beating Wahab with superb 
reverse-swing from around the wicket, he brought one back with the angle and 
crashed into his off-stump. Class fast bowling from the Aussie spearhead. To 
generate that movement away from a right-hander at pace around the wicket to 
set him up, then to execute the killer blow the other way. Yep. Class. One to 
get.

51st over: Pakistan 159-8 (Sohail 6, Wahab 0). Sohail has really no choice but 
to attack the scoreboard with runs from here. Survival surely isn’t his jive, 
and certainly isn’t Wahab’s. That’s helped by four runs to start Hazlewood’s 
new spell from the Members’ End, it’s via an edge but that’s all of secondary 
importance. Another two through the same region comes next. The remainder of 
the over requires the huge hulk of a man to defend and duck twice each.

Remember when everyone was telling Pakistan to play a little quicker so they 
could declare earlier?

WICKET! Sarfraz b Starc 43 (Pakistan 153-8)

Starc is back on and with the last ball of his eventful over bends back the 
off-stump of Sarfraz from around the wicket! Brilliant fast bowling. An edge 
that didn’t go to hand followed by a play and miss may have discouraged a 
lesser competitor, but not Starc didn’t lose his bundle and did what he does 
best: hit the pegs at pace. 28 runs up Australia’s sleeve with two wickets to 
get and 17 overs to do it in.

49th over: Pakistan 149-7 (Sarfraz 39, Sohail 0). Well, some may say it would 
be appropriate if Pakistan lost their way to a run out next. It nearly happened 
in that Bird over, Sarfraz driving to cover and looking for a third, but 
probably forgot that Sohail is the slowest man in world cricket. Two will do. 
As it does again the next ball when the same batsman grabs another pair behind 
point. Then one to square leg. The deficit only 32 now. Sohail has two balls to 
look at, defending the first with sound technique and then doing it again to 
end the over. Solid. For now.
Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport) 
Best scenario: Pakistan bowled out 18 runs ahead with three overs to play. 
Lose two for change of innings. Test cricket Super Over.#AusvPak

48th over: Pakistan 144-7 (Sarfraz 34, Sohail 0). One of those 90-second overs 
from Lyon. Only a single from Sarfraz coming from it, but it can be a bit 
addictive running through the overs at the expense of building pressure. And 
will Sarfraz start milking a bit of strike?

47th over: Pakistan 143-7 (Sarfraz 33, Sohail 0). Just the one delivery for 
Sohail to see off, defending Bird. Pakistan 38 behind, will Sohail take a 
similar approach to the first innings where he made a brisk half-century in 
order to get rid of the deficit as quickly as possible? Couldn’t rule it out.

WICKET! Amir b Bird 11 (Pakistan 143-7)

Outstanding bowling from the man most likely since the tea break. To begin his 
over from around the wicket Amir left and it nearly collected his off-stump, 
after the DRS survival he hung the bat out to a similar delivery. But on this 
occasion there was an inside edge, ricocheting back onto the stumps. Superbly 
done.

NOT OUT! It’s extremely close to the inside edge, but there’s nothing there. 
Amir to stay put. Australia’s challenge burned. They have one left, meanwhile 
Pakistan are all out of love.

46th over: Pakistan 142-6 (Sarfraz 32, Amir 11). There’s still plenty of ‘Nice 
Garry’ from behind the stumps, but the dots are far less penetrative with the 
game slipping away. There’s six of them to Amir, it’s a good over, but of no 
real assistance to Smith’s side.
Matt Nicholls (@mattnicholls29) 
Give Handscomb the gloves and throw Matthew Wade the ball for some mediums. 
Wade can't bat or keep and he does have a Test over to his name.

45th over: Pakistan 142-6 (Sarfraz 32, Amir 11). Sarfraz takes his 
now-customary three to the second ball of Bird’s over, driven wide of mid-off. 
It’s very clear his intention is to knock off the deficit as soon as possible 
to buy a couple more overs for the changeover if Australia do bowl them out. 
Amir is in no trouble anyway, grabbing two of his own runs behind point. He is 
beaten with the penultimate ball; that’s a delight from around the wicket. 
Reverse swing away from the left-hander after angling in. Superb. But no 
reward. To the last ball, Amir takes the strike himself for the next over via a 
single to square leg. This stand is now worth 40, and Australia’s time could 
well be running out if they can’t halt it very soon.

More to bowling changes than "it's reversing" or "quicks usually do a job". 
Psychology must be weighed up, for spinners especially#AUSvPAK

44th over: Pakistan 136-6 (Sarfraz 29, Amir 8). Lyon spins the ball past the 
outside edge of Amir. Beautiful bowling. Slower in pace as well, which his 
former captain Clarke enjoys on the TV. A bit shorter, Amir doesn’t hesitate 
whacking through cover for a couple. That’s his area. Amir savvy enough to 
leave the last ball well alone, to give the strike back to his senior colleague 
Sarfraz. They’re doing it well, these two. 6189 at the MCG today. 142,188 for 
the Test.

43rd over: Pakistan 134-6 (Sarfraz 29, Amir 6). Sarfraz might want to knock 
off these runs the way he is looking, steering Bird behind point for a 
boundary, the lead now under 50. Another positive punch between mid-off and 
point nets a couple more. Considerably different situation for Lyon to operate 
in now, where runs increasingly a premium. Bird finishes with a bouncer, so 
it’ll be Lyon versus the left-hander Amir to start the new set. He’ll fancy 
that, at least.

42nd over: Pakistan 128-6 (Sarfraz 23, Amir 6). Praise whatever you praise, 
it’s Nathan “Nathan” Lyon into the attack at last! Replacing Starc from the 
Great Southern Stand end. He overpitches initially, clobbered through cover by 
Sarfraz. He has a 3-6 field in operation here; slip, backward point and mid-off 
the only men stationed on the push side. No silly point. Grrr. Naturally, his 
line is straight, Sarfraz sweeps beautifully beyond the sweeper at deep 
backward square leg for a second boundary. He pushes through the penultimate 
ball at 99kph, a single taken. Only two men around the bat - slip and bat pad - 
to the left hander Amir. He defends the single delivery he has to face. Not the 
ideal start. As Warne reiterates: who knows what that bizarre, protracted stint 
out of the attack has done to his earlier confidence? Time will tell. 25 overs, 
four wickets needed, 53 runs in the black for the Australians.

41st over: Pakistan 119-6 (Sarfraz 14, Amir 6). Evidently it’s Bird that’s the 
word, not Lyon. Animals, the both of them. Sarfraz gets off strike first ball, 
which probably isn’t advisable. But Amir has looked confident so far, so why 
not. Warne is filthy with Smith here. “It’s probably the best he has bowled all 
summer today.” He makes a good point about confidence as well; always 
significant with Lyon. He was sky high before Tea. But now? He’d be aware as 
anyone that faith hasn’t been shown in him here after the interval. So, the 
pressure back onto him when he does get the ball. Amir, meanwhile, is beaten on 
the inside edge - a little nibble there on the way through - then on the 
outside, a beautiful delivery from around the wicket.

40th over: Pakistan 114-6 (Sarfraz 13, Amir 2). Starc again. This is getting 
quite odd now. Sarfraz takes five of the six deliveries without a huge amount 
going on, a single into the legside. Amir defends confidently to finish the 
set. 27 overs left.

39th over: Pakistan 113-6 (Sarfraz 12, Amir 2). Pattern continues, Sarfraz 
taking three half way through the over - well driven down the ground. Good 
batting from Amir, leaving then defending. “I’d love to see Nathan Lyon back,” 
says Taylor. Warne agrees. “It’s like Steve Smith doesn’t want him to take 
wickets.” He adds: “A left-hander is back in. Hello?”Shots fired.

38th over: Pakistan 110-6 (Sarfraz 9, Amir 2). Starc again. Hmmm. He wins the 
edge of Sarfraz but it doesn’t carry to Handscomb. Fantastic save. He gets 
through through cover when the quick overpitches. Amir is good enough to keep 
out a couple of full balls to finish the over; aka Starc’s party trick. Good 
cricket. Warne chipped Steve Waugh on the Nine commentary before. I don’t get 
it, it reduces him every time he does it. He says his former captain “used 
spinners as an afterthought.”

37th over: Pakistan 107-6 (Sarfraz 6, Amir 2). Hazlewood continues from the 
Members’ End. Jim Maxwell on twitter raises the point that if Australia win 
maybe he should be Man of the Match given the batsman-friendly conditions? 
Usually a good idea to listen to Jim. He has four slips in place when Amir gets 
down the business end, Sarfraz’s push to cover leaving him half an over. He 
handles it well, leaving outside the off-stump.

35th over: Pakistan 103-6 (Sarfraz 2, Amir 2). Hazlewood’s successful over 
concludes as Amir gets off the mark, a couple to third man through the cordon. 
Simon Katich on the radio suggests that Lyon is “absolutely giving it” to the 
new batsman from point.

A lot of people streaming into the MCG now. Not quite Border and Thommo 
numbers, but still.

WICKET! Azhar lbw Hazlewood 43 (Pakistan 101-6)

It’s adjacent, it’s hitting middle and leg, it’s out! Josh Hazlewood has 
dismissed Azhar Ali for the first time in this match. A crucial moment, maybethe
 crucial moment. Australia could be on the cusp of a memorable Melbourne 
victory. So here come the Pakistan bowlers. Only the bold predict with any 
certainty what they will do with the bat. Amir is first up.

34th over: Pakistan 98-5 (Azhar 41, Sarfraz 1). Another Starc over. Bill Lawry 
is into it too. “Where is the spinner?”. Surely not far away. The press box 
equally as confused. For mine, I have some sympathy with Smith wanting to give 
his talisman a quick frolic before letting Lyon bed down the end till the 
death. Only some, though. Starc’s set begins by provoking a play and miss from 
Azhar. Not ideal from the Pakistan mainstay, who has faced more balls than 
anyone in this series, so says CricViz. He’s more convincing later in the over 
with a couple to cover.

Not using Lyon now really does defy all logic, unless the logic is to drop him

33rd over: Pakistan 96-5 (Azhar 39, Sarfraz 1). Shout for caught behind, so 
decent that Bill Lawry called it as gooooone... but it was thigh pad, Safraz 
surviving Hazlewood’s initial post-Tea foray. Not his most accurate over of the 
summer, Azhar flicking him for a boundary earlier in the over as well.

Michael Clarke having his say on Smith’s post-Tea attack too.

32nd over: Pakistan 91-5 (Azhar 34, Sarfraz 1). It’s Mitchell Starc given the 
first crack from the Great Southern Stand end rather than Lyon in the first 
instance, who he has replaced. Ian Chappell says he’s surprised by that. 
Anyway, a short, sharp spell the likely story there. Not many people in there 
today, but thegates are now open so if you are following on in Melbourne, do 
get yourself to theCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Ground. 
It looks a treat as well, soaked in sun. Sarfraz is leaving then defending in 
sequence to begin the session.

Adam Collins

I’ll be honest with you.

I’m not going to be objective about Nathan Lyon. When he first sprung onto TV 
as a South Australian T20 bowler it was exciting enough, given the last time I 
saw him was as our club captain at Western Districts University of Canberra CC 
the summer before.

When he was picked for Australia, and took five wickets on debut  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2B2pcGKBB8>- with a handy bloke called 
Sangakarra first ball - I jumped around on my hotel bed like a madman; such was 
my pure joy for this lovely bloke. When he was dropped without justification - 
not once but twice - I seethed with anger.

By the time he’d really made it - going on to become the most prolific 
Australian off-spinner ever - I was on the tour myself and covered him with 
professionalism. If anything, I probably overcompensated at times.

But now, with his career reportedly on the line, I’m back to riding every 
ball. And I’m glad I’ll be riding it with you here on the OBO as this Test 
moves towards a potentially thrilling conclusion.

It’s all set for a thrilling final session in Melbourne

There are days when you’re happy to flee from the OBOing chair, but I 
genuinely envy Adam Collins today, because he’ll be bringing you either a 
sensational Australian victory or a classic rearguard from Pakistan. Either way 
I sense it will be gripping. Standing in Australia’s way is Azhar Ali, whom 
they haven’t dismissed all Test, but he’ll need some support. Can Nathan Lyon 
bowl Australia to victory and silence his critics? We shall soon see.

Tea on day five - Pakistan are in trouble

31st over: Pakistan 91-5 (Azhar 34, Shafiq 16)

And that is tea on day five. Josh Hazlewood had the last over before the break 
and had the new man Sarfraz in his sights, but he survives another accurate 
over of fast bowling from the big New South Welshman, getting off strike with a 
leg bye that drew a full-blooded appeal from the Australians. Azhar had the 
worst of it, wearing a short one to the fingers as he leapt back to defend. His 
side is well and truly on the rack here. Australia are pressing for the win.

30th over: Pakistan 90-5 (Azhar 34, Sarfraz 1)

Pakistan are deep in the mire now, and Azhar has to rouse something from his 
new partner Sarfraz. Going in the tourists’ favour is the fact that they batb 
deep, but this will test them. Sarfraz is off the mark driving uppishly to 
mid-wicket. Tension. Drama. I’m sorry we’ll have to stop this in five minutes 
when tea is called.

WICKET! Shafiq c Handscomb b Lyon 16 (Pakistan 89-5)

Lyon gets Shafiq! Oh my word that’s a big breakthrough. The Pakistani No6 
charges the spinner and flicks towards leg but Peter Handscomb pulls off a 
truly sensational catch, anticipating the movement and juggling the ball 
successfully after it slaps into his left hand. What a snare! On the topic of 
Scorsese, if they drop Lyon after this he has every right to go full Travis 
Bickle.

29th over: Pakistan 87-4 (Azhar 33, Shafiq 15)

Jimmy Henrix had Purple Haze, Australia have White Haze in the form of Josh 
Hazlewood, who replaces Starc now at the member’s end. His cover and mid-wicket 
are both short, and the staggered cordon remains, with the gap at third. Shafiq 
has a good look and is comfortable with what he sees.

Before anyone asks: yes I understand that Fredo is not a Goodfellas character, 
he just worked better in my analogy. Which Scorsese character would Nathan Lyon 
be?

28th over: Pakistan 84-4 (Azhar 31, Shafiq 14)

Amid all of the carnage of the Pakistan innings it is worth pointing out again 
that Azhar remains undisturbed in this Test; 205 not out in the first innings 
has been followed by a calm 31 here. We didn’t pick him in our Guardian Test XI 
of the year, which is starting to look like a judgment to rival with the 
snubbing of Goodfellas in favour of Dances with Wolves at the Academy Awards. 
Sorry Marty. Sorry Azhar. Lyon bowls a maiden. Let’s hope he’s not taken out 
onto the lake like Fredo at the end of this Test.

27th over: Pakistan 84-4 (Azhar 31, Shafiq 14)

Solid but unspectacular from Starc, who concedes a single to each batsman as 
this session settles into a pattern of relative normality. Azhar makes the best 
of the situation here, driving handsomely through mid-wicket to pick up three 
and send a cluster of Australian players into meaningful conference with their 
skipper Steve Smith.

26th over: Pakistan 79-4 (Azhar 27, Shafiq 13)

Lyon continues to heap pressure on Shafiq, though I would imagine a silly 
point could apply even more still. Extra cover will do for now. The off-spinner 
drops short and gets cut through the vacant point region for three. A 
mini-consolidation is being wrought by Azhar and his partner, though I said 
that before, didn’t I?

25th over: Pakistan 74-4 (Azhar 25, Shafiq 10)

With half an hour to go until tea, Mitchell Starc comes around the wicket to 
Shafiq and he’s got three slips (a fourth but no third), a short leg and a 
short cover. A bit like Lyon before him, Starc drops off in quality just a 
little and gets cracked for three through point by Shafiq. The big paceman is 
approaching from very wide on the crease but stump-to-stump could be the order 
of the day here, given the heightened stakes.

24th over: Pakistan 70-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 7)

Shafiq starts the over with a single and it’s not Lyon’s best, to be honest, 
but every ball is met with anticipation by his team-mates. They can sniff 
victory now and continue to press the tourists.

Stat requests from Ed Cowan. Love it.
Ed Cowan (@eddiecowan) 
@RicFinlay <https://twitter.com/RicFinlay> what is Lyon's average on Aust with 
the ball please vs all finger spinners who have played more than 5 tests here?

23rd over: Pakistan 69-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 6)

Foot to the floor now by Steve Smith, who brings Mitchell Starc back into the 
fray from the member’s end. His first is right on the button, shaping away from 
Shafiq and drawing him forward. The penultimate delivery draws a low edge from 
Shafiq but it’s no danger of being caught and flies past the cordon for a 
boundary.

Without being harsh on his team-mates, Asad Shafiq is actually the man you 
want out there for a crisis like this. He stands at the other end as Bird bowls 
a maiden, an over in which my laptop crashes. Hopefully that’s not an omen for 
Pakistan.

20th over: Pakistan 63-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 0)

Lyon’s superlative over continues to provide drama. His first ball to Shafiq 
draws a massive appeal for lbw, whicb is turned down by Umpire Ravi. Then, 
somehow, there is a near run-out of the striker when he belts one into 
Handscomb at short leg and the ball gets pinged back in at the stumps. This

WICKET! Misbah c Maddinson b Lyon 0 (Pakistan 63-4)

Misbah goes too! Chaos at the MCG as Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq sweeps 
Nathan Lyon straight into the hands of Nic Maddinson around the corner on the 
45. What was going through his mind? He played a similar stroke to his first 
ball and drew gasps, now he holes out to leave his side in a state of disarray. 
Two overs ago the tourists look good to kill this game off. Now they look like 
losing before tea. Nathan Lyon is on fire! Stick that up your jumper, armchair 
critics.

Mitchell Starc leads Australia to dramatic Melbourne Test win over Pakistan

So that’s the lot from the MCG. A day where expectations were managed then 
exceeded as Australia plundered the runs required to declare before lunch and 
took the wickets required for an unlikely victory. In turn, they reclaim the 
trophy ceded to the Pakistanis in the UAE back in October 2014.

For the victors, captain Steve Smith comes away with an unbeaten and crucial 
century. It looked at times it would be for nothing, but he showed the control 
yesterday to keep the game moving along at a decent clip, then the extra gear 
this morning to set up all that came next.

Mitchell Starc’s four second-innings wickets followed his own enterprising 
hand of 84 with the bat, including seven sixes - a new MCG record. Not a bad 
effort considering they’ve played 108 Tests on the ground since 1877.

Australia’s talisman was especially potent in his final spell, returning to 
rip through Pakistan’s lower order with a masterclass of swing both 
conventional and reverse, just when it appeared the visitors had the reserves 
to save this game.

Nathan Lyon woke to reports of his imminent demise, but bowled with 
considerable drift, turn and flight in the middle session to gut the middle 
order, three wickets making the case for his retention.

All the while, Josh Hazlewood was superb, with a breakthrough to start both 
the second and third session. His 100th career wicket came earlier this match, 
and every performance highlights his prowess and seniority in this side.

Jackson Bird’s one wicket won’t look crucial on paper this afternoon, but it 
was a huge breakthrough in the context of the innings, looking the man most 
likely from the moment he was thrown the ball at the Members’ End. For the 
third Test in a row he’s justified selectors’ faith him him.

Speaking to the ABC, Steve Smith noted that “everything changed” in the squad 
after the Hobart debacle. Energy and enthusiasm, he cites for this. Whilst both 
hard to measure, it is equally hard to doubt the veracity. To win on a day like 
today requires supreme belief and everything to go right. Tick and tick.

So to Sydney we move, where a decent stint of selection speculation awaits. It 
is quite possible that the squad for the SCG Test starting on 3 January will be 
named in the next half hour or so when the Australian team front the media. 
With the series now in the bag, the temptation to use the fixture as a trial 
for India will surely be high. It’ll make for fascinating viewing.

And that’s just about enough from me. Be sure to read Russell Jackson’s report 
on the fifth day in the below link, I’m sure it’s a good’un. On behalf of 
Guardian’s over-by-over team from Melbourne, thanks very much for your company. 
Can’t wait to do it all again in Sydney. Goodnight.

The post-game, part two. 

Josh Hazlewood is on the radio as well before the formal proceedings, saying 
that he expects to play in Sydney. He says his body is fine and he doesn’t need 
a rest. To be fair, that’s what you say after winning a match like that.

Chris Rogers thinks they will go the “cautious approach” to ensure that they 
are right to go in India, especially Starc. “We can’t afford to see him go down 
before that tour.”

Misbah is first up on the mic at the presentation. “In Test cricket you have 
to win sessions. You need to bat and bowl well in both innings, and we are not 
managing to do that at the moment.” That sums it up.

Man of the Match is next. It has gone to Steve Smith for his unbeaten 165. “We 
thought if we could get the ball to reverse soon enough it would be hard work 
for them.” He says that started to become the case when Pakistan were five-down.

“We have still got a long way to go, we are still a new team, but it has been 
a great transition,” he adds. On his own game: “I love batting here at the 
MCG.” He sure does.

Team talk? “It’ll depend on the conditions.” He says that it has taken to spin 
at Sydney this year, so that’s the best hint we’ve got as far as two spinners 
are concerned. And that’s our fill from ground level. Back in a tic to wrap up.
 
The post-game, part one.

Chris Rogers says that Michell Starc should be Man of the Man, and Simon 
Katich agrees on the radio. A brisk 84 runs and four crucial wickets when 
Australia looked just about spent.

Starc is on the TV now, saying that the “belief was there” when they went out 
to bowl this afternoon. “If we took those chances, we knew we’d get ten chances 
today and it is a fantastic way to finish a Boxing Day Test.” It’s easy to 
forget that it was his first, come to think of it. A brilliant day at the 
office.

Starc goes on with ABC: “We are all a bit knackered, but it is all worth it.” 
He goes on to explain that the captain Smith wanted a lead of 140-180 before 
having another bowl. And that’s exactly what happened.

Nathan Lyon is on the telly now. He isn’t saying a lot, the usual “credit to 
all the boys.” He notes that it wasn’t taking lot of spin and he doesn’t mind 
who got the wickets. Line and length - understandable in the circumstances.

The ABC radio team have Lyon now. Did he feel under pressure? “To be honest, 
no, I think I’ve been bowling well all summer.” He points out that it has been 
hard graft for all spinners in Australia this summer.

Presentation coming up next. 
 
The last man Yasir gets a big, high leading edge and Jack Bird does the rest 
at mid-off. That’s a mighty win for the hosts, knocking over Pakistan inside 54 
overs and winning by an innings. Awful from the visitors. More on that later as 
we move into the post game. Stick with us.
 
53rd over: Pakistan 163-9 (Sohail 10, Yasir 0). Sohail drives Hazlewood down 
the ground to the rope with real panache. Good on him. The deficit is 18. 
Hazlewood follows up the only way appropriate by bouncing him. A nice defensive 
stroke ends the over as Umpire Gould calls out the drinks van. Enough time for 
one final plot twist? Hope so. Grab a glass of cordial.

2016 <https://twitter.com/mattnicholls29/status/814716740034625536>  
52nd over: Pakistan 159-9 (Sohail 6, Yasir 0). A wicket-maiden from the very 
top draw, finishing with a full and straight delivery to the new man Yasir who 
does enough to defend it back to Starc. Australia are going to win by an 
innings here after Pakistan made 443-9 declared in their first dig.
 
It was bound to happen just like that. After twice beating Wahab with superb 
reverse-swing from around the wicket, he brought one back with the angle and 
crashed into his off-stump. Class fast bowling from the Aussie spearhead. To 
generate that movement away from a right-hander at pace around the wicket to 
set him up, then to execute the killer blow the other way. Yep. Class. One to 
get.
 
51st over: Pakistan 159-8 (Sohail 6, Wahab 0). Sohail has really no choice but 
to attack the scoreboard with runs from here. Survival surely isn’t his jive, 
and certainly isn’t Wahab’s. That’s helped by four runs to start Hazlewood’s 
new spell from the Members’ End, it’s via an edge but that’s all of secondary 
importance. Another two through the same region comes next. The remainder of 
the over requires the huge hulk of a man to defend and duck twice each.
Hassan Cheema (@mediagag) 
Remember when everyone was telling Pakistan to play a little quicker so they 
could declare earlier?

Starc is back on and with the last ball of his eventful over bends back the 
off-stump of Sarfraz from around the wicket! Brilliant fast bowling. An edge 
that didn’t go to hand followed by a play and miss may have discouraged a 
lesser competitor, but not Starc didn’t lose his bundle and did what he does 
best: hit the pegs at pace. 28 runs up Australia’s sleeve with two wickets to 
get and 17 overs to do it in.
 
49th over: Pakistan 149-7 (Sarfraz 39, Sohail 0). Well, some may say it would 
be appropriate if Pakistan lost their way to a run out next. It nearly happened 
in that Bird over, Sarfraz driving to cover and looking for a third, but 
probably forgot that Sohail is the slowest man in world cricket. Two will do. 
As it does again the next ball when the same batsman grabs another pair behind 
point. Then one to square leg. The deficit only 32 now. Sohail has two balls to 
look at, defending the first with sound technique and then doing it again to 
end the over. Solid. For now.

48th over: Pakistan 144-7 (Sarfraz 34, Sohail 0). One of those 90-second overs 
from Lyon. Only a single from Sarfraz coming from it, but it can be a bit 
addictive running through the overs at the expense of building pressure. And 
will Sarfraz start milking a bit of strike?
 
47th over: Pakistan 143-7 (Sarfraz 33, Sohail 0). Just the one delivery for 
Sohail to see off, defending Bird. Pakistan 38 behind, will Sohail take a 
similar approach to the first innings where he made a brisk half-century in 
order to get rid of the deficit as quickly as possible? Couldn’t rule it out.

Outstanding bowling from the man most likely since the tea break. To begin his 
over from around the wicket Amir left and it nearly collected his off-stump, 
after the DRS survival he hung the bat out to a similar delivery. But on this 
occasion there was an inside edge, ricocheting back onto the stumps. Superbly 
done.
 
NOT OUT! It’s extremely close to the inside edge, but there’s nothing there. 
Amir to stay put. Australia’s challenge burned. They have one left, meanwhile 
Pakistan are all out of love.
 
Not out! Review! Did Bird hit Amir’s inside edge? We’re going to find out in 
just a moment. Stand by!
 
46th over: Pakistan 142-6 (Sarfraz 32, Amir 11). There’s still plenty of ‘Nice 
Garry’ from behind the stumps, but the dots are far less penetrative with the 
game slipping away. There’s six of them to Amir, it’s a good over, but of no 
real assistance to Smith’s side.
Matt Nicholls (@mattnicholls29) 
Give Handscomb the gloves and throw Matthew Wade the ball for some mediums. 
Wade can't bat or keep and he does have a Test over to his name.

45th over: Pakistan 142-6 (Sarfraz 32, Amir 11). Sarfraz takes his 
now-customary three to the second ball of Bird’s over, driven wide of mid-off. 
It’s very clear his intention is to knock off the deficit as soon as possible 
to buy a couple more overs for the changeover if Australia do bowl them out. 
Amir is in no trouble anyway, grabbing two of his own runs behind point. He is 
beaten with the penultimate ball; that’s a delight from around the wicket. 
Reverse swing away from the left-hander after angling in. Superb. But no 
reward. To the last ball, Amir takes the strike himself for the next over via a 
single to square leg. This stand is now worth 40, and Australia’s time could 
well be running out if they can’t halt it very soon.

<https://twitter.com/danbrettig/status/814706668189585408>  
44th over: Pakistan 136-6 (Sarfraz 29, Amir 8). Lyon spins the ball past the 
outside edge of Amir. Beautiful bowling. Slower in pace as well, which his 
former captain Clarke enjoys on the TV. A bit shorter, Amir doesn’t hesitate 
whacking through cover for a couple. That’s his area. Amir savvy enough to 
leave the last ball well alone, to give the strike back to his senior colleague 
Sarfraz. They’re doing it well, these two. 6189 at the MCG today. 142,188 for 
the Test.
 
43rd over: Pakistan 134-6 (Sarfraz 29, Amir 6). Sarfraz might want to knock 
off these runs the way he is looking, steering Bird behind point for a 
boundary, the lead now under 50. Another positive punch between mid-off and 
point nets a couple more. Considerably different situation for Lyon to operate 
in now, where runs increasingly a premium. Bird finishes with a bouncer, so 
it’ll be Lyon versus the left-hander Amir to start the new set. He’ll fancy 
that, at least.
 
42nd over: Pakistan 128-6 (Sarfraz 23, Amir 6). Praise whatever you praise, 
it’s Nathan “Nathan” Lyon into the attack at last! Replacing Starc from the 
Great Southern Stand end. He overpitches initially, clobbered through cover by 
Sarfraz. He has a 3-6 field in operation here; slip, backward point and mid-off 
the only men stationed on the push side. No silly point. Grrr. Naturally, his 
line is straight, Sarfraz sweeps beautifully beyond the sweeper at deep 
backward square leg for a second boundary. He pushes through the penultimate 
ball at 99kph, a single taken. Only two men around the bat - slip and bat pad - 
to the left hander Amir. He defends the single delivery he has to face. Not the 
ideal start. As Warne reiterates: who knows what that bizarre, protracted stint 
out of the attack has done to his earlier confidence? Time will tell. 25 overs, 
four wickets needed, 53 runs in the black for the Australians.
 
41st over: Pakistan 119-6 (Sarfraz 14, Amir 6). Evidently it’s Bird that’s the 
word, not Lyon. Animals, the both of them. Sarfraz gets off strike first ball, 
which probably isn’t advisable. But Amir has looked confident so far, so why 
not. Warne is filthy with Smith here. “It’s probably the best he has bowled all 
summer today.” He makes a good point about confidence as well; always 
significant with Lyon. He was sky high before Tea. But now? He’d be aware as 
anyone that faith hasn’t been shown in him here after the interval. So, the 
pressure back onto him when he does get the ball. Amir, meanwhile, is beaten on 
the inside edge - a little nibble there on the way through - then on the 
outside, a beautiful delivery from around the wicket.

40th over: Pakistan 114-6 (Sarfraz 13, Amir 2). Starc again. This is getting 
quite odd now. Sarfraz takes five of the six deliveries without a huge amount 
going on, a single into the legside. Amir defends confidently to finish the 
set. 27 overs left.

39th over: Pakistan 113-6 (Sarfraz 12, Amir 2). Pattern continues, Sarfraz 
taking three half way through the over - well driven down the ground. Good 
batting from Amir, leaving then defending. “I’d love to see Nathan Lyon back,” 
says Taylor. Warne agrees. “It’s like Steve Smith doesn’t want him to take 
wickets.” He adds: “A left-hander is back in. Hello?”Shots fired.
 
38th over: Pakistan 110-6 (Sarfraz 9, Amir 2). Starc again. Hmmm. He wins the 
edge of Sarfraz but it doesn’t carry to Handscomb. Fantastic save. He gets 
through through cover when the quick overpitches. Amir is good enough to keep 
out a couple of full balls to finish the over; aka Starc’s party trick. Good 
cricket. Warne chipped Steve Waugh on the Nine commentary before. I don’t get 
it, it reduces him every time he does it. He says his former captain “used 
spinners as an afterthought.”

37th over: Pakistan 107-6 (Sarfraz 6, Amir 2). Hazlewood continues from the 
Members’ End. Jim Maxwell on twitter raises the point that if Australia win 
maybe he should be Man of the Match given the batsman-friendly conditions? 
Usually a good idea to listen to Jim. He has four slips in place when Amir gets 
down the business end, Sarfraz’s push to cover leaving him half an over. He 
handles it well, leaving outside the off-stump.
 
36th over: Pakistan 106-6 (Sarfraz 5, Amir 2). Starc’s third over of the 
session. Sarfraz takes a couple then a single, exposing Amir to a couple of 
deliveries. The first of whichnearly carries to Lyon point. About three feet 
short in the old money. He survives. 
 
35th over: Pakistan 103-6 (Sarfraz 2, Amir 2). Hazlewood’s successful over 
concludes as Amir gets off the mark, a couple to third man through the cordon. 
Simon Katich on the radio suggests that Lyon is “absolutely giving it” to the 
new batsman from point.

A lot of people streaming into the MCG now. Not quite Border and Thommo 
numbers, but still.

It’s adjacent, it’s hitting middle and leg, it’s out! Josh Hazlewood has 
dismissed Azhar Ali for the first time in this match. A crucial moment, maybethe
 crucial moment. Australia could be on the cusp of a memorable Melbourne 
victory. So here come the Pakistan bowlers. Only the bold predict with any 
certainty what they will do with the bat. Amir is first up.
 
Azhar given lbw! Review! Stand by!
 
34th over: Pakistan 98-5 (Azhar 41, Sarfraz 1). Another Starc over. Bill Lawry 
is into it too. “Where is the spinner?”. Surely not far away. The press box 
equally as confused. For mine, I have some sympathy with Smith wanting to give 
his talisman a quick frolic before letting Lyon bed down the end till the 
death. Only some, though. Starc’s set begins by provoking a play and miss from 
Azhar. Not ideal from the Pakistan mainstay, who has faced more balls than 
anyone in this series, so says CricViz. He’s more convincing later in the over 
with a couple to cover.

Not using Lyon now really does defy all logic, unless the logic is to drop him

33rd over: Pakistan 96-5 (Azhar 39, Sarfraz 1). Shout for caught behind, so 
decent that Bill Lawry called it as gooooone... but it was thigh pad, Safraz 
surviving Hazlewood’s initial post-Tea foray. Not his most accurate over of the 
summer, Azhar flicking him for a boundary earlier in the over as well.

Michael Clarke having his say on Smith’s post-Tea attack too.

32nd over: Pakistan 91-5 (Azhar 34, Sarfraz 1). It’s Mitchell Starc given the 
first crack from the Great Southern Stand end rather than Lyon in the first 
instance, who he has replaced. Ian Chappell says he’s surprised by that. 
Anyway, a short, sharp spell the likely story there. Not many people in there 
today, but thegates are now open so if you are following on in Melbourne, do 
get yourself to theCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Ground. 
It looks a treat as well, soaked in sun. Sarfraz is leaving then defending in 
sequence to begin the session.
 
I’ll be honest with you.

I’m not going to be objective about Nathan Lyon. When he first sprung onto TV 
as a South Australian T20 bowler it was exciting enough, given the last time I 
saw him was as our club captain at Western Districts University of Canberra CC 
the summer before.

When he was picked for Australia, and took five wickets on debut  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2B2pcGKBB8>- with a handy bloke called 
Sangakarra first ball - I jumped around on my hotel bed like a madman; such was 
my pure joy for this lovely bloke. When he was dropped without justification - 
not once but twice - I seethed with anger.

By the time he’d really made it - going on to become the most prolific 
Australian off-spinner ever - I was on the tour myself and covered him with 
professionalism. If anything, I probably overcompensated at times.

But now, with his career reportedly on the line, I’m back to riding every 
ball. And I’m glad I’ll be riding it with you here on the OBO as this Test 
moves towards a potentially thrilling conclusion.

Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com> for the corro, @collinsadam  
<http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam>for the hot takes. Carn, Nath. 
 
It’s all set for a thrilling final session in Melbourne

There are days when you’re happy to flee from the OBOing chair, but I 
genuinely envy Adam Collins today, because he’ll be bringing you either a 
sensational Australian victory or a classic rearguard from Pakistan. Either way 
I sense it will be gripping. Standing in Australia’s way is Azhar Ali, whom 
they haven’t dismissed all Test, but he’ll need some support. Can Nathan Lyon 
bowl Australia to victory and silence his critics? We shall soon see.
 
31st over: Pakistan 91-5 (Azhar 34, Shafiq 16)

And that is tea on day five. Josh Hazlewood had the last over before the break 
and had the new man Sarfraz in his sights, but he survives another accurate 
over of fast bowling from the big New South Welshman, getting off strike with a 
leg bye that drew a full-blooded appeal from the Australians. Azhar had the 
worst of it, wearing a short one to the fingers as he leapt back to defend. His 
side is well and truly on the rack here. Australia are pressing for the win.
 
30th over: Pakistan 90-5 (Azhar 34, Sarfraz 1)

Pakistan are deep in the mire now, and Azhar has to rouse something from his 
new partner Sarfraz. Going in the tourists’ favour is the fact that they batb 
deep, but this will test them. Sarfraz is off the mark driving uppishly to 
mid-wicket. Tension. Drama. I’m sorry we’ll have to stop this in five minutes 
when tea is called.
 
Lyon gets Shafiq! Oh my word that’s a big breakthrough. The Pakistani No6 
charges the spinner and flicks towards leg but Peter Handscomb pulls off a 
truly sensational catch, anticipating the movement and juggling the ball 
successfully after it slaps into his left hand. What a snare! On the topic of 
Scorsese, if they drop Lyon after this he has every right to go full Travis 
Bickle.

29th over: Pakistan 87-4 (Azhar 33, Shafiq 15)

Jimmy Henrix had Purple Haze, Australia have White Haze in the form of Josh 
Hazlewood, who replaces Starc now at the member’s end. His cover and mid-wicket 
are both short, and the staggered cordon remains, with the gap at third. Shafiq 
has a good look and is comfortable with what he sees.

Before anyone asks: yes I understand that Fredo is not a Goodfellas character, 
he just worked better in my analogy. Which Scorsese character would Nathan Lyon 
be?
 
28th over: Pakistan 84-4 (Azhar 31, Shafiq 14)

Amid all of the carnage of the Pakistan innings it is worth pointing out again 
that Azhar remains undisturbed in this Test; 205 not out in the first innings 
has been followed by a calm 31 here. We didn’t pick him in our Guardian Test XI 
of the year, which is starting to look like a judgment to rival with the 
snubbing of Goodfellas in favour of Dances with Wolves at the Academy Awards. 
Sorry Marty. Sorry Azhar. Lyon bowls a maiden. Let’s hope he’s not taken out 
onto the lake like Fredo at the end of this Test.
 
27th over: Pakistan 84-4 (Azhar 31, Shafiq 14)

Solid but unspectacular from Starc, who concedes a single to each batsman as 
this session settles into a pattern of relative normality. Azhar makes the best 
of the situation here, driving handsomely through mid-wicket to pick up three 
and send a cluster of Australian players into meaningful conference with their 
skipper Steve Smith.
 
26th over: Pakistan 79-4 (Azhar 27, Shafiq 13)

Lyon continues to heap pressure on Shafiq, though I would imagine a silly 
point could apply even more still. Extra cover will do for now. The off-spinner 
drops short and gets cut through the vacant point region for three. A 
mini-consolidation is being wrought by Azhar and his partner, though I said 
that before, didn’t I?
 
25th over: Pakistan 74-4 (Azhar 25, Shafiq 10)

With half an hour to go until tea, Mitchell Starc comes around the wicket to 
Shafiq and he’s got three slips (a fourth but no third), a short leg and a 
short cover. A bit like Lyon before him, Starc drops off in quality just a 
little and gets cracked for three through point by Shafiq. The big paceman is 
approaching from very wide on the crease but stump-to-stump could be the order 
of the day here, given the heightened stakes.
 
24th over: Pakistan 70-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 7)

Shafiq starts the over with a single and it’s not Lyon’s best, to be honest, 
but every ball is met with anticipation by his team-mates. They can sniff 
victory now and continue to press the tourists.

Stat requests from Ed Cowan. Love it.

@RicFinlay <https://twitter.com/RicFinlay> what is Lyon's average on Aust with 
the ball please vs all finger spinners who have played more than 5 tests here?

23rd over: Pakistan 69-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 6)

Foot to the floor now by Steve Smith, who brings Mitchell Starc back into the 
fray from the member’s end. His first is right on the button, shaping away from 
Shafiq and drawing him forward. The penultimate delivery draws a low edge from 
Shafiq but it’s no danger of being caught and flies past the cordon for a 
boundary.
 
22nd over: Pakistan 64-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 1)

Shafiq is off the mark with a single but Lyon has planted the seed of doubt 
now and finishes the over with a spirited lbw shout against Azhar Ali. Not out 
is the call from Umpire Ravi. It was close.
 
21st over: Pakistan 63-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 0)

Without being harsh on his team-mates, Asad Shafiq is actually the man you 
want out there for a crisis like this. He stands at the other end as Bird bowls 
a maiden, an over in which my laptop crashes. Hopefully that’s not an omen for 
Pakistan.
 
20th over: Pakistan 63-4 (Azhar 24, Shafiq 0)

Lyon’s superlative over continues to provide drama. His first ball to Shafiq 
draws a massive appeal for lbw, whicb is turned down by Umpire Ravi. Then, 
somehow, there is a near run-out of the striker when he belts one into 
Handscomb at short leg and the ball gets pinged back in at the stumps. This 
game has gone mad.
 
Misbah goes too! Chaos at the MCG as Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq sweeps 
Nathan Lyon straight into the hands of Nic Maddinson around the corner on the 
45. What was going through his mind? He played a similar stroke to his first 
ball and drew gasps, now he holes out to leave his side in a state of disarray. 
Two overs ago the tourists look good to kill this game off. Now they look like 
losing before tea. Nathan Lyon is on fire! Stick that up your jumper, armchair 
critics.
