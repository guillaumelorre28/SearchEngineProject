There was a time in the not-so-distant past when Matthew Fitzpatrick’s career 
choices were questioned. How the 22-year-old from Sheffield, who has now 
returned three European Tour wins inside only 13 months, has enjoyed the last 
laugh.

Henrik Stenson’s ‘best year of my career’ after second Race to Dubai win

Fitzpatrick’s refusal to follow convention was illustrated in 2013, when he 
left the US college system after just one term. Eyebrows were raised, criticism 
was forthcoming; yetFitzpatrick has been proven entirely correct in pursuing 
his dreams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/21/the-open-sliver-medal-matt-fitzpatrick>
 by turning professional immediately after the 2014 US Open, which he contested 
as an amateur.

In Dubai on Sunday, he further endorsed his blossoming status. His success at 
the DP World Tour Championship, achieved with a wonderful up-and-down from a 
greenside bunker at the 72nd hole, means he became the youngest Englishman to 
claim three European Tour titles. The man from whom he has taken that record is 
hardly an unknown: Nick Faldo. Fitzpatrick will now move inside the top-30 
ranked players in the world. The best thing about him? An unaltered, grounded 
character which renders him so appealing.

“It’s actually two years to the day that I got my Tour card,” said 
Fitzpatrick, who closed with a 67 to win by one at 17-under par. “When I think 
about that, it is crazy. Obviously I’ve won the final event of the year and two 
years ago, I was just getting on the Tour and I happy to keep my card.

“This gives me confidence to push even further and further. Everything has 
just happened so fast. The 18th green was the most nervous I’ve been over a 
four-foot putt, ever, in my career. You need to pull it off and fortunately, so 
far so good. It won’t always work out that way.”

Before winning the British Masters last October, Fitzpatrick was driving a 
Ford Mondeo and relying on sponsors’ invites for tournament places. Even now, 
he still lives with his parents; as referenced as he revisited that topic of 
vehicles.

“After the British Masters, I traded the Mondeo for a BMW X4,” Fitzpatrick 
explained. “Then the dealership gave me a brand new X5, which I drove from 
Warrington to home. My insurance people said, ‚ÄòYeah, they are very high 
targets for being stolen.’ Mum and dad weren’t too keen on having that on their 
drive so we sent that one back.”

Fitzpatrick was not the only one afforded to celebrations. Henrik Stenson 
closed his season in style with a 65 which alsoconfirmed his status 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/20/golf-henrik-stenson-wins-race-to-dubai-golf>
 as the European Tour’s order of merit winner. That carries a £986,000 bonus. 
“It has been a great year, the best of my career,” the Open champion said. “I 
always thought it was going to be hard to top 2013 but I feel like I’ve done 
that. It feels lovely to finish this way.”

Henrik Stenson hails 2016 as his best year yet after Race to Dubai win

Given Stenson and Fitzpatrick have a coach in common, the former is well 
placed to comment on the Yorkshireman’s brilliance. “I’m glad to see my Ryder 
Cup foursomes partner come up with the goods here,” Stenson said. “The last 15 
months or so has been phenomenal for him. He’s got big potential.

“He’s not playing the power game but he’s hitting a lot of fairways, a lot of 
greens and putting well. He has got a solid short game. So he’s going to be 
around for a while, that’s for sure.”

There was, however, a loser. Tyrrell Hatton was odds-on to prevail when 
holding a one-shot lead on the 18th tee. What followed was uncharacteristic for 
another exciting English talent; Hatton drove into a water hazard and made a 
bogey six. The carelessness of that was compounded for Hatton 10 minutes later 
as Fitzpatrick converted for his four.

“Obviously it’s a bitter pill to swallow but it’s been a great week and for me 
it’s been the best year of my life,” Hatton said. “So I can’t get too downbeat. 
I’ll take my next chance.”

Rory McIlroy <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy>, who had Stenson 
for playing company on Sunday, matched the Swede’s score and is therefore also 
departing the Earth Course in fine spirits. But for an opening round of 75, 
McIlroy could have been a key part of this event’s narrative. “If I had even 
just shot around level par on Thursday, I would have been right in the 
tournament,” he said. “But these things happen; I played well for the remaining 
three days and at least I redeemed myself a little bit.”

This was Fitzpatrick’s day. All evidence suggests that he will enjoy plenty 
more of them.
