Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> 
has been warned to expect backbench hostility if the government attempts to 
adopt carbon trading, even if a new scheme is restricted only to the 
electricity sector.


The Liberal MP Craig Kelly, who chairs the backbench committee on environment 
and energy, told Guardian Australia on Monday carbon trading was “contrary to 
Coalition policy” and argued it was “highly unlikely that theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> would adopt carbon 
trading at any stage”.

The comments were backed up on Monday evening by the South Australian Liberal 
Senator Cory Bernardi, who told Sky News contemplating carbon pricing would 
reopen old divisions in Coalition ranks, and was one of the “dumbest” things 
he’d heard in politics for some time.

Kelly’s comments follow the release on Monday of terms of reference for a 
review of the government’s Direct Action policy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/05/direct-action-review-coalition-leaves-carbon-trading-option-open>
, which leave open the option of reinstating a form of carbon trading in the 
electricity sector.

Climate countdown: is Australia on track to avoid catastrophe?

Some stakeholders believe the Finkel review into energy security and 
Australia’s climate commitments may also float the desirability of an emissions 
intensity scheme for the electricity sector when it presents its preliminary 
fundings to Friday’s meeting of the prime minister and the premiers.

The Direct Action review will require consideration of policy mechanisms to 
reduce emissions on a “sector-by-sector basis” – which is code for considering 
the adoption of a trading scheme in the electricity sector to manage the 
transition to low-emissions power sources.

In media interviews on Monday morning, the environment and energy minister, 
Josh Frydenberg <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg>, 
said explicitly the review would canvas the desirability of a trading scheme 
for the electricity sector.

Frydenberg also appeared to lay the ground not to extend the current federal 
renewable energy target of 23.5% by 2020, arguing the government was interested 
in lowest cost abatement.

“When you look at the effectiveness, both in terms of cost as well as reducing 
emissions, of the various mechanisms that we have, the RET is not at the top of 
the list,” he said.

Last week, the prime minister telegraphed the review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/01/direct-action-review-could-bring-changes-to-renewable-targets-says-pm>
 could lead to changes to the federal RET.

Kelly said on Monday it was a good time to review Direct Action and he said 
Frydenberg’s decision not to rule various policy changes in or out was 
reasonable.

But he said there was no way Frydenberg would be able to persuade colleagues 
on the merits of carbon trading. “It wouldn’t have the support of the Coalition 
party room,” Kelly said.

Kelly also poured cold water on the idea of looking at sectoral responses to 
reducing emissions, warning that could create “distortions if you tinker with 
one sector but leave another”.

On extending the federal RET beyond 2020, Kelly said the current scheme was 
not causing problems for industry “but as soon as you start ramping it up 
beyond where we have it now it starts to bite in terms of costs and 
competitiveness”.

He contended Australia could meet its commitments under the Paris 
international climate agreement without raising the RET by using other 
mechanisms such as energy efficiency.

The government’s problems won’t be restricted to internal opposition if it 
ultimately goes down the carbon trading path.

Kelly’s opposition to carbon trading was echoed on Monday by the One Nation 
senatorMalcolm Roberts

accept that climate change is occurring, or that humans are contributing to it.

But business, energy and climate groups argue that Direct Action will not 
deliver the emissions reductions required to ensure Australia meets its 
international commitments.

Business and climate groups have also been dismayed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/energy-groups-and-businesses-plead-for-strategic-response-before-ministers-meet>
 by a rerun of Australia’s toxic climate politics, triggered when the prime 
ministerlinked a statewide blackout in South Australia in September explicitly 
to the state’s use of renewable energy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/jay-weatherill-accuses-barnaby-joyce-of-pushing-anti-windfarm-agenda-over-blackouts>
 – which led to brawling between Canberra and the states on renewable energy 
targets.

Both business and environmental groups want policy certainty, given hundreds 
of millions of dollars of new investment in low emissions technologies are on 
the line.

The Climate Institute said on Monday the Direct Action review presented an 
opportunity to get serious about the challenges before Australia.

“This 2017 review and consideration of post 2030 targets will make clear the 
choices that Australia’s political, business and community leaders make,” said 
the institute’s chief executive, John Connor.

“We will stick with the chaos and point-scoring of the last decade, or move 
forward to manage the risks and grab the opportunities of the climate and clean 
energy challenge.

“The review offers the chance for a real national conversation about how 
Australia can join other nations working towards net zero emissions by 
mid-century and modernising and decarbonising their energy systems.

“As part of the review, next year Australia can choose to continue with costly 
and disruptive policy chaos and political point-scoring that is impacting on 
investment, electricity prices and energy security. Or we can choose to join 
the real world of responsible risk management and recognition of the economic 
opportunities in a world turning to clean energy.”
