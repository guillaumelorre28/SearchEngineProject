And that brings our live coverage of the pope’s tour to a close for today. And 
what a day it was:

 * Pope Francis, in a bold address to Congress

 andabortion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2015/sep/24/for-the-red-pope-being-pro-life-is-more-about-social-justice-than-abortion>
. He received several standing ovations (andtears 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/24/republicans-democrats-pope-francis-speech-reaction>
). 
 * Endorsements came in from Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Kim Kardashian
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/kim-kardashian-pope-tweet-argentina-dope>
, among others. The pope’s statements on immigration were welcomed by Latino 
representatives, in particular. 
 * Republicans were more mixed in their response: Ben Carson seemed to like 
the address,Ted Cruz was less happy (except for on religious liberty, abortion 
and marriage) andDonald Trump dismissed the whole thing more or less out of hand
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/sep/24/pope-francis-donald-trump-immigration-america>
.‘Catholics for Jeb!’ politely distanced themselves from the pontiff. 
 * The pontiff dined with the homeless in Washington before departing for New 
York, where he paraded through the city. 
 * At a Vespers service at St Patrick’s Cathedral, Pope Francis prayed for 
those who died in the Hajj stampede at Mecca, and said priests must “bear the 
shame” of their brothers who abused children. 
 * He especially thanked the religious women – nuns and other sisters – of the 
US for their service. 
Please join us again Friday on the Guardian PopeBlog for day seven of our live 
coverage. It’sanother jam-packed day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/sep/19/pope-francis-cuba-america-visit-itinerary>
: the pope will address the United Nations, visit the 9/11 memorial, lead a 
procession through Central Park and say mass at Madison Square Garden. Join 
Guardian US tomorrow for more pontifical action on this historic tour.

After that homily, the words of the Magnificat (The Canticle of Mary) will 
have extra resonance for the hierarchs of the US church:

He has shown the strength of his arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.

He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty.

Pope Francis thanks the religious women of the US

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> pays a special 
compliment to the religious sisters of the US:

In a special way I would like to express my gratitude to the religious women 
of the US. What would the church be without you? Women of strength. Fighters 
with that spirit of courage which puts you in the front lines, in the 
proclamation of the gospel. To you religious women, sisters and mothers of this 
people, I wish to say thank you. A big thank you. And to tell you that I love 
you very much.

Francis thanks them again and asks them to be patient in their struggles in a 
changing pastoral environment. The (Spanish-speaking) nuns leap to their feet 
in applause.

More insights from papal biographer Austen Ivereigh.
Austen Ivereigh (@austeni) 
Poe at Vespers is powerfully challenging US Church's temptation of cult of 
success, efficiency, etc. "which govern the business world".

Becomes clear in this Vespers that Evangelii Gaudium pages on spiritual 
worldliness had US Church (among others) in mind.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> speaks to 
priests about the privilege of serving God:

Yet if we are honest, we know how easy this spirit of generous self-sacrifice 
can be dampened. There are a couple of ways that this can happen. Both are 
examples of that spiritual worldliness that weakens our commitment to serve and 
diminishes the wonder of our first encounter with Christ.

We can get caught up mentioning the value of our apostolic works by the 
standards of efficiency, good management and outward success which govern the 
business world.Not that these things are unimportant - we have been entrusted 
with a great responsibility and God’s people rightly expect accountability from 
us.

But the true worth of our apostolate is measured by the value it has in God’s 
eyes. To see and evaluate things from God’s perspection calls for constant 
conversation … and need I say, great humility.

Pope Francis speaks of priests who 'harmed and scandalized' the church

This evening my brothers and sisters I have come to join you in prayer. That 
our vocations will continue to build up the great edifice of God’s Kingdom in 
this country. I know that as a presbyterate [priesthood] in the midst of God’s 
people you suffered greatly in the not-distant past by having to bear the shame 
of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the church in the most 
vulnerable of her members.

I know well that you have come forth from the great tribulation. I accompany 
you at this time of pain and difficulty and I thank God for the faithful 
service to his people in the hope of helping you to persevere on the path of 
fidelity to Jesus Christ.

. He received several standing ovations (andtears

). 
 * Endorsements came in from Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Kim Kardashian
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/kim-kardashian-pope-tweet-argentina-dope>
, among others. The pope’s statements on immigration were welcomed by Latino 
representatives, in particular. 
 * Republicans were more mixed in their response: Ben Carson seemed to like 
the address,Ted Cruz was less happy (except for on religious liberty, abortion 
and marriage) andDonald Trump dismissed the whole thing more or less out of hand
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/sep/24/pope-francis-donald-trump-immigration-america>
.‘Catholics for Jeb!’ politely distanced themselves from the pontiff. 
 * The pontiff dined with the homeless in Washington before departing for New 
York, where he paraded through the city. 
 * At a Vespers service at St Patrick’s Cathedral, Pope Francis prayed for 
those who died in the Hajj stampede at Mecca, and said priests must “bear the 
shame” of their brothers who abused children. 
 * He especially thanked the religious women – nuns and other sisters – of the 
US for their service. 
Please join us again Friday on the Guardian PopeBlog for day seven of our live 
coverage. It’sanother jam-packed day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/sep/19/pope-francis-cuba-america-visit-itinerary>
: the pope will address the United Nations, visit the 9/11 memorial, lead a 
procession through Central Park and say mass at Madison Square Garden. Join

After that homily, the words of the Magnificat (The Canticle of Mary) will 
have extra resonance for the hierarchs of the US church:

He has shown the strength of his arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.

He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> pays a special 
compliment to the religious sisters of the US:

In a special way I would like to express my gratitude to the religious women 
of the US. What would the church be without you? Women of strength. Fighters 
with that spirit of courage which puts you in the front lines, in the 
proclamation of the gospel. To you religious women, sisters and mothers of this 
people, I wish to say thank you. A big thank you. And to tell you that I love 
you very much.

Francis thanks them again and asks them to be patient in their struggles in a 
changing pastoral environment. The (Spanish-speaking) nuns leap to their feet 
in applause.

Poe at Vespers is powerfully challenging US Church's temptation of cult of 
success, efficiency, etc. "which govern the business world".

Becomes clear in this Vespers that Evangelii Gaudium pages on spiritual 
worldliness had US Church (among others) in mind.

Pope Francis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> speaks to 
priests about the privilege of serving God:

Yet if we are honest, we know how easy this spirit of generous self-sacrifice 
can be dampened. There are a couple of ways that this can happen. Both are 
examples of that spiritual worldliness that weakens our commitment to serve and 
diminishes the wonder of our first encounter with Christ.

We can get caught up mentioning the value of our apostolic works by the 
standards of efficiency, good management and outward success which govern the 
business world.Not that these things are unimportant - we have been entrusted 
with a great responsibility and God’s people rightly expect accountability from 
us.

But the true worth of our apostolate is measured by the value it has in God’s 
eyes. To see and evaluate things from God’s perspection calls for constant 
conversation … and need I say, great humility.

This evening my brothers and sisters I have come to join you in prayer. That 
our vocations will continue to build up the great edifice of God’s Kingdom in 
this country. I know that as a presbyterate [priesthood] in the midst of God’s 
people you suffered greatly in the not-distant past by having to bear the shame 
of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the church in the most 
vulnerable of her members.

I know well that you have come forth from the great tribulation. I accompany 
you at this time of pain and difficulty and I thank God for the faithful 
service to his people in the hope of helping you to persevere on the path of 
fidelity to Jesus Christ.
