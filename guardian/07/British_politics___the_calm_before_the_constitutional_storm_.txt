The demonstrators outside Chatham House were not, it turned out, making the 
point thatNicola Sturgeon <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon>
 was jaundiced. I checked. The yellow masks of Scotland’s first minister were a 
rotten print job. The six quiet souls with a small budget and obvious placards 
– “Dance to my Tune Ed” – were there to save the union.

Shouldn’t St James’s Square have been packed with demonstrators, with tulips 
trampled and police horses holding back the crowds? Where were the banners and 
loud speakers? Something big is happening here. A kingdom is at stake.

But to this visitor’s eye, these mute demonstrators seem to catch the mood of 
the 2015 campaign. I’m not talking about Scotland. Pride and enthusiasm are on 
the march up there. But politics isn’t swamping newspapers and television down 
south. It’s so quiet, so tidy. Much of the time, an election seems hardly to be 
happening at all.

What a relief it was to see on the road to Ramsgate a fence draped with cheap 
tinsel and placards forNigel Farage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>. Finally, here was evidence 
of an election.

Farage is nothing if not an old timer. But all I’ve seen in London are a few 
shy posters and placards. Where is the chaotic mess of a general election?

Politics in this country has become indoor work. This week David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> was campaigning in a creche 
in Surbiton and a factory in Bedford that supplies log cabins to the British. 
And today, in the basement of Chatham House, Ed Miliband was giving – in 
remarkably general terms – an account of Labour’s foreign policy.

His jaw works hard. He jokes and mugs. There is an eagerness to the man which 
may, in office, prove especially tedious. He is not least prime ministerial in 
his skill at sidestepping questions, especially those he first declares to be 
“incredibly serious”. Once commended, they are barely addressed.

Both Miliband and Cameron are doing their best to project the keynote calm of 
England. At Bedford on Tuesday, rattling off tax and pension figures, the prime 
minister seemed not to have a care in the world. He could hardly have thought 
his maths lesson was winning the hearts of the assembled workers. But by God he 
was projecting calm.

Not so, half an hour later on the platform at Bedford station, chewing his lip 
and looking distracted. The facade had slipped. Even with both hands deep in 
his pockets Eton-style, he seemed deeply uneasy. No wonder: the best outcome 
public polls are offering him at this point is stalemate followed by 
constitutional confusion.

You might think this looming mess would excite the electorate. But the people 
of Britain appear to be embracing it willingly. It’s not changing their minds. 
They’re not doing anything about it. For weeks the polls have barely budged. 
Voters seem not even to have changed their minds whether to vote at all.

The Scots, we are told, will turn out to a man and woman. Not so the English.

Sometime in the 1990s came a great slump in voting. Nothing about this 
campaign is encouraging the English to turn out in greater numbers on 7 May.

The prediction is that less than 70% of voters will bother to go to a ballot 
box. And the young, who might resolve the coming logjam, will barely vote at 
all.

With no sign of a last-minute surge coming to the government’s rescue, 
Conservative tacticians have begun to talk of tiny shifts yet saving Cameron: 
shifts of as little as 1% in the right seats. The tacticians are keeping hope 
alive, and getting stuck into the Scottish National party.

How curious that, having run out of other races to attack, they are turning 
once again on the Scots. The tacticians swear Cameron is taking care to 
distinguish between Nicola Sturgeon’s party and the people north of the Tweed. 
But it’s a delicate business when her party will carry nearly ever seat in 
Scotland.

But even this appeal to ancient hatreds – “They’re coming, they’re coming and 
their faces are blue” – seems not to have excited the electorate much. Calm 
still reigns, calm and a strange willingness in the electorate to leave to 
politicians and constitutional lawyers the task of solving the problems of 8 
May.

Calm is so British. We admire it. We buy posters extolling its virtues. But 
this isn’t the war. This is the calm that descends in the moments before a 
terrible accident, when time stands still, things work in slow motion and 
nothing, it seems, can be done to stop the truck hitting the cliff.

What about a march, a rally, politicians rousing their troops in town hall 
meetings? What about a hundred demonstrators in yellow Sturgeon masks 
embarrassing Miliband in St James’s Square? What about a strategy that engages 
the national imagination to fix the coming confusion before it happens?

The polls can shift in a fortnight but at this point Britain is plodding to 
the end when an old woman will tot up the figures that tell her who gets the 
first chance to govern Britain. We trust she’s calm. The nation is going to 
have to be, too. It could be a long and trying business.
