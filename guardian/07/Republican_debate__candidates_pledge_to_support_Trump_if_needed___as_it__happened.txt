The 11th Republican presidential debate has concluded. Here’s a breakdown of 
what happened:

 * Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took up where they left off in the last 
debate, throwing roundhouse punches at Donald Trump, the frontrunner. Notable 
attacks were leveled at Trump University, which stands accused of fraud, and at 
Trump’s seriousness as an immigration hawk. 
 * Did it work? The billionaire businessman seemed frustrated at moments, 
growing red and seeming annoyed, repeating himself and not always succeeding at 
finding on-point defenses. But he didn’t explode onstage or anything. 
 * One of the most potentially damaging moments for Trump, however, came at 
the hands ofFox News host Megyn Kelly, who brandished court documents to bring 
alive the class-action suit againstTrump University, which former students 
accuse of delivering next to nothing in return for thousands of tuition dollars.

 * Trump was driven to repeatedly saying “let’s see what happens at the end of 
three years,” in reference to the anticipated resolution of the lawsuit, which 
he downplayed as a “minor civil case”. 
 * Florida senator Rubio said that Trump was trying to put the same fraud over 
on American voters as he put over on Trump Universitystudents, in both cases 
selling a bill of goods. 
 * Texas senator Cruz repeatedly called on Trump to “release the tapes” of an 
off-the-record conversation Trump had with New York Times editors, in which 
Trump supposedly expressed secret flexibility in his immigration stance. 
 * Trump said he would not call for the release of the audio recordings, 
because his respect for the journalism ground rules for off-the-record 
conversations was simply too great. 
 * Trump also admitted he was moderating his earlier opposition to more visas 
for highly skilled immigrant workers. Might his seeming moderation on 
immigration hurt him with his base? Mark Krikorian (@MarkSKrikorian) 
Trump: 'I'm softening' my policy on high-skilled foreign workers

rise based on immigration

<https://twitter.com/MarkSKrikorian/status/705605552802496513> 
 * Ohio governor John Kasich won repeated applause for bringing the 
conversation back to the details of policy and describing how to revive public 
schools, how to balance the budget and how to downsize government. Kasich said 
that people tell him he is the only adult onstage in these debates. 
 * Trump was questioned about how the military could follow his potentially 
extra-legal orders to, for example, kill the family of a suspected terrorist. 
“They’ll do as I tell them,” Trump said. 
 * Rubio accused Trump of being unable to speak in depth about policy in any 
area, and of instead resorting to personal attacks. 
 * Trump at one point replied by calling Rubio “little Marco”. Rubio smirked 
and said: “let’s hear it big Donald.” 
 * Speaking of light moments, Cruz fell to mocking Trump at one point by 
telling him to “breathe, breathe, breathe.” Rubio made a crack about yoga. Cruz 
quipped he hoped there would be no yoga onstage. Rubio delivered the punch 
line, gesturing to Trump: “He’s flexible enough.”

 * Trump early on appeared to boast about the size of his penis. He noted that 
Rubio had accused him of having small hands and seemed to imply that his, 
Trump’s, penis was similarly small. “I guarantee you there’s no problem,” Trump 
reassured the audience.

well said - Clinton, weak as she is and she must know it, has got to be

As an observer to this theatrical nonsense from the Republican Party, the only 
things that seem to appeal to crowd is, who is the biggest celebrity, who will 
give you the biggest gun, and who prays to God more than the other. America you 
really are in deep trouble.

That’s it. There is some generally milling on the stage and oh look there’s 
Bill O’Reilly again.

He’s interviewing Trump. Trump says the debate was “tough but fair.” Eric 
Trump and Melania Trump appear silently and straight-faced behind Trump like... 
props?

Trump calls Romney jealous. He says he did not have the “guts to run” for 
president and he’s a joke artist.

More on Romney. Why do you fill them with loathing?

“I’m loved,” Trump says.

Closing statements

Kasich: Progress in Ohio. Rehabilitated minority community. I’ll fix

wow. Our children. Freedom. Prosperity. MarcoRubio.com

does not believe in you. That will end. And to the cops and firemen: I got your 
back.

very very proud of this country in just a few years.”

Concluding question

Last question of the night: Will you support the GOP nominee even if it’s 
Trump?

Rubio: I’ll support the Republican nominee, even Trump, because the Democrats 
have two people left in the race. A socialist and a person who lies to the 
families of the victims of Benghazi.

Cruz: Yes, because I gave my word that I would. I keep my word.

Kasich: Yeah, I kinda think before it’s all said and done, I’ll be the 
nominee. Look, when you’re in the arena, you enter a special circle. If he ends 
up as the nominee. Sometimes he makes it a little bit hard but you know I’m 
going to support whoever is the nominee.

Trump is asked would he support the nominee even if it’s not him.

Trump: Even if it’s not me? Millions of millions of people have come to the 
Republican party... and Democrats are losing people. I’m very proud. The answer 
is yes I will.

John Stoehr

Maybe there has been a gentlemen’s agreement in place during this GOP debate. 
Tonight, Cruz and Rubio have attacked Trump, sometime very successfully. Trump 
has been on the defensive most of the night.

Meanwhile, Kasich has presented himself very well. His foreign policy answer 
was superlative. Could it be that Cruz and Rubio are trying to put Kasich out 
front? I can’t imagine a selfless Cruz, but maybe.

Kasich takes a question about a commercial his campaign ran tying Trump to 
Putin. Do you think Trump is naive about Putin?

“I’m not biting,” Kasich says. “Let me just take you around the world,” he 
says. He’s cheered and applauded.
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Biggest applause line of the night may have just been John Kasich

He goes around the world:

Russia: attack on Eastern European Nato member states is attack on us. 

China: stop hacking us and pipe down in south China sea.

Egypt: they are on last legs.

Jordan, Saudi, Gulf states: our allies who need support. Annnd...

“We need good human intelligence.” Ding ding ding.

“Let’s call it a semi-trip around the world,” Kasich says. He has run out of 
time.

Someone like Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, who is 
constitutionally incapable of exhibiting any emotions other than affected 
unctuousness or smug paternalism, should probably avoid coming across like a 
father on stage.

I mean, leave aside all the creeping discomfort of Ted Cruz reminding you of 
someone’s daddy; it’s just unbearably smug.Telling Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/mar/03/republican-presidential-debate-trump-rubio-cruz-fox-news-detroit-live?page=with:block-56d903bae4b0a02aed205f0b#block-56d903bae4b0a02aed205f0b>
 to breathe and count to 10 and behave like an adult is just such a weasel 
reaction.

For one, Cruz has been just as much of a petulant child as anyone else not 
named Bush, Carson or Kasich over the course of the debates. For another, it’s 
like trying to sneak a burn in through the backdoor of the discourse. Ted Cruz 
loses when he tries to attack Trump head on, so he’s going to passively attack 
him by portraying him as a child and showing how much wiser he is for refusing 
to engage. But Cruzis engaging, while trying to seem above the same inane 
slapfight he regularly engages.

Once you get past the superficial shaming, he’s either a hypocrite or a wuss 
or, more realistically, both.
Paul Owen (@PaulTOwen) 
Is this patronising "breathe, breathe" from Cruz really going to win over any 
Trump supporters to his side?#gopdebate

Trump on military, again: 'they'll do as I tell them'

Rubio’s invited to say why he thinks Trump’s not qualified to be president.

Rubio says Trump hasn’t shown seriousness about foreign policy. Rubio cites 
Trump’s earlier answer about the military doing whatever he says even if it’s 
extra-legal. “That’s just not true,” Rubio says.

Trump has not shown “the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning 
about these complicated issues,” Rubio says.

Trump’s reply: “I’ve gotten to know Marco. Believe me, he is not a leader.”

“Frankly, when I say they’ll do as I tell them, they’ll do as I tell them.”

Rubio says Trump once again was pressed on a policy issue and could only 
attack someone by name. Then he lists pressure from North Korea, China, Russia, 
Iran and radical jihadists.

“You have yet to answer a serious question about any of this,” Rubio says.

“Putin said very nice things about me,” Trump says. Then he says he had said, 
“Wouldn’t it be nice if we got along with the world and maybe Russia could help 
us?”

As the candidates discussed gun control, they began to get more detail focused.
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has said that he 
does not support the ban on assault weapons.

In December, we investigated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/14/the-role-of-gun-control-in-2015-worst-mass-shootings>
 the 20 shootings with the most fatalities in 2015 and found that most gunmen 
obtain their weapons legally. More specifically, we found that in three of 
those shootings, assault weapons had been used.
 In the chart above, green indicates ‘yes’ and red ‘no’. Gray boxes indicate 
no information is available to answer the question. Numbers refer to the 
shootings ranked by number of fatalities, with 1 being the deadliest.

The 11th Republican presidential debate has concluded. Here’s a breakdown of 
what happened:

 * Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took up where they left off in the last 
debate, throwing roundhouse punches at Donald Trump, the frontrunner. Notable 
attacks were leveled at Trump University, which stands accused of fraud, and at 
Trump’s seriousness as an immigration hawk. 
 * Did it work? The billionaire businessman seemed frustrated at moments, 
growing red and seeming annoyed, repeating himself and not always succeeding at 
finding on-point defenses. But he didn’t explode onstage or anything. 
 * One of the most potentially damaging moments for Trump, however, came at 
the hands ofFox News host Megyn Kelly, who brandished court documents to bring 
alive the class-action suit againstTrump University, which former students 
accuse of delivering next to nothing in return for thousands of tuition dollars.

 * Trump was driven to repeatedly saying “let’s see what happens at the end of 
three years,” in reference to the anticipated resolution of the lawsuit, which 
he downplayed as a “minor civil case”. 
 * Florida senator Rubio said that Trump was trying to put the same fraud over 
on American voters as he put over on Trump Universitystudents, in both cases 
selling a bill of goods. 
 * Texas senator Cruz repeatedly called on Trump to “release the tapes” of an 
off-the-record conversation Trump had with New York Times editors, in which 
Trump supposedly expressed secret flexibility in his immigration stance. 
 * Trump said he would not call for the release of the audio recordings, 
because his respect for the journalism ground rules for off-the-record 
conversations was simply too great. 
 * Trump also admitted he was moderating his earlier opposition to more visas 
for highly skilled immigrant workers. Might his seeming moderation on 
immigration hurt him with his base? Mark Krikorian (@MarkSKrikorian) 
Trump: 'I'm softening' my policy on high-skilled foreign workers

rise based on immigration

<https://twitter.com/MarkSKrikorian/status/705605552802496513> 
 * Ohio governor John Kasich won repeated applause for bringing the 
conversation back to the details of policy and describing how to revive public 
schools, how to balance the budget and how to downsize government. Kasich said 
that people tell him he is the only adult onstage in these debates. 
 * Trump was questioned about how the military could follow his potentially 
extra-legal orders to, for example, kill the family of a suspected terrorist. 
“They’ll do as I tell them,” Trump said. 
 * Rubio accused Trump of being unable to speak in depth about policy in any 
area, and of instead resorting to personal attacks. 
 * Trump at one point replied by calling Rubio “little Marco”. Rubio smirked 
and said: “let’s hear it big Donald.” 
 * Speaking of light moments, Cruz fell to mocking Trump at one point by 
telling him to “breathe, breathe, breathe.” Rubio made a crack about yoga. Cruz 
quipped he hoped there would be no yoga onstage. Rubio delivered the punch 
line, gesturing to Trump: “He’s flexible enough.”

 * Trump early on appeared to boast about the size of his penis. He noted that 
Rubio had accused him of having small hands and seemed to imply that his, 
Trump’s, penis was similarly small. “I guarantee you there’s no problem,” Trump 
reassured the audience.  
Here are the top-tweeted #GOPDebate moments, via the metrics folks at Twitter:

1. Trump defends his businesses 
<https://amp.twimg.com/v/d20fb2f3-dbcf-4381-bbf0-4b3ffa2820ee>, including Trump 
University.

2. Cruz tells Trump to relax <http://pic.twitter.com/DNnXIorKi0>, Rubio 
follows up with a yoga joke.

3. Trump calls Rubio “little Marco” <http://pic.twitter.com/dSq1nAMiiU>; Chris 
Wallace live fact-checks Trump.

Trump is the GOP nominee. Frankenstein didn't like his monster very much 
either - too bad.

well said - Clinton, weak as she is and she must know it, has got to be 
thrilled with how this is working out; Kasich could actually have beaten her in 
the general election had the party not eaten itself

As an observer to this theatrical nonsense from the Republican Party, the only 
things that seem to appeal to crowd is, who is the biggest celebrity, who will 
give you the biggest gun, and who prays to God more than the other. America you 
really are in deep trouble.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is getting 
fu**ed up tonight
 
It’s proper to fist bump after a debate, everybody knows that.

the nominee.

That’s it. There is some generally milling on the stage and oh look there’s 
Bill O’Reilly again.

He’s interviewing Trump. Trump says the debate was “tough but fair.” Eric 
Trump and Melania Trump appear silently and straight-faced behind Trump like... 
props?

Trump calls Romney jealous. He says he did not have the “guts to run” for 
president and he’s a joke artist.

More on Romney. Why do you fill them with loathing?

“I’m loved,” Trump says. 
 
Kasich: Progress in Ohio. Rehabilitated minority community. I’ll fix 
Washington. I’ll send you power to fix your communities. Restore America.

Rubio: Unusual election cycle huh. This is about opportunities. 21st century 
wow. Our children. Freedom. Prosperity. MarcoRubio.com

Cruz: I want to talk to soldier, sailor, airmen, marine, and families. Obama 
does not believe in you. That will end. And to the cops and firemen: I got your 
back.

Trump: I’ll bring jobs back. Fix military. Care for vets. “You’re going to be 
very very proud of this country in just a few years.”
 
Last question of the night: Will you support the GOP nominee even if it’s 
Trump?

Rubio: I’ll support the Republican nominee, even Trump, because the Democrats 
have two people left in the race. A socialist and a person who lies to the 
families of the victims of Benghazi.

Cruz: Yes, because I gave my word that I would. I keep my word.

Kasich: Yeah, I kinda think before it’s all said and done, I’ll be the 
nominee. Look, when you’re in the arena, you enter a special circle. If he ends 
up as the nominee. Sometimes he makes it a little bit hard but you know I’m 
going to support whoever is the nominee.

Trump is asked would he support the nominee even if it’s not him.

Trump: Even if it’s not me? Millions of millions of people have come to the 
Republican party... and Democrats are losing people. I’m very proud. The answer 
is yes I will.
 
Maybe there has been a gentlemen’s agreement in place during this GOP debate. 
Tonight, Cruz and Rubio have attacked Trump, sometime very successfully. Trump 
has been on the defensive most of the night.

Meanwhile, Kasich has presented himself very well. His foreign policy answer 
was superlative. Could it be that Cruz and Rubio are trying to put Kasich out 
front? I can’t imagine a selfless Cruz, but maybe.
 
Last commercial break! Let’s hear it – who’s winning and who’s losing?

Donald Trump (paraphrasing): "I don't get sued often."

Kasich takes a question about a commercial his campaign ran tying Trump to 
Putin. Do you think Trump is naive about Putin?

“I’m not biting,” Kasich says. “Let me just take you around the world,” he 
says. He’s cheered and applauded.
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Biggest applause line of the night may have just been John Kasich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> saying "I'm not biting"

He goes around the world:

Russia: attack on Eastern European Nato member states is attack on us. 

China: stop hacking us and pipe down in south China sea.

Egypt: they are on last legs.

Jordan, Saudi, Gulf states: our allies who need support. Annnd...

“We need good human intelligence.” Ding ding ding.

“Let’s call it a semi-trip around the world,” Kasich says. He has run out of 
time.
 
Someone like Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, who is 
constitutionally incapable of exhibiting any emotions other than affected 
unctuousness or smug paternalism, should probably avoid coming across like a 
father on stage.

I mean, leave aside all the creeping discomfort of Ted Cruz reminding you of 
someone’s daddy; it’s just unbearably smug.Telling Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/mar/03/republican-presidential-debate-trump-rubio-cruz-fox-news-detroit-live?page=with:block-56d903bae4b0a02aed205f0b#block-56d903bae4b0a02aed205f0b>
 to breathe and count to 10 and behave like an adult is just such a weasel 
reaction.

For one, Cruz has been just as much of a petulant child as anyone else not 
named Bush, Carson or Kasich over the course of the debates. For another, it’s 
like trying to sneak a burn in through the backdoor of the discourse. Ted Cruz 
loses when he tries to attack Trump head on, so he’s going to passively attack 
him by portraying him as a child and showing how much wiser he is for refusing 
to engage. But Cruzis engaging, while trying to seem above the same inane 
slapfight he regularly engages.

Once you get past the superficial shaming, he’s either a hypocrite or a wuss 
or, more realistically, both.

Is this patronising "breathe, breathe" from Cruz really going to win over any

Rubio’s invited to say why he thinks Trump’s not qualified to be president.

Rubio says Trump hasn’t shown seriousness about foreign policy. Rubio cites 
Trump’s earlier answer about the military doing whatever he says even if it’s 
extra-legal. “That’s just not true,” Rubio says.

Trump has not shown “the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning 
about these complicated issues,” Rubio says.

Trump’s reply: “I’ve gotten to know Marco. Believe me, he is not a leader.”

“Frankly, when I say they’ll do as I tell them, they’ll do as I tell them.”

Rubio says Trump once again was pressed on a policy issue and could only 
attack someone by name. Then he lists pressure from North Korea, China, Russia, 
Iran and radical jihadists.

“You have yet to answer a serious question about any of this,” Rubio says.

“Putin said very nice things about me,” Trump says. Then he says he had said, 
“Wouldn’t it be nice if we got along with the world and maybe Russia could help 
us?”
 
Here is Trump on targetting terrorists’ families:

And here’s the second 15 minutes of the debate:
 
As the candidates discussed gun control, they began to get more detail focused.
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has said that he 
does not support the ban on assault weapons.

In December, we investigated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/14/the-role-of-gun-control-in-2015-worst-mass-shootings>
 the 20 shootings with the most fatalities in 2015 and found that most gunmen 
obtain their weapons legally. More specifically, we found that in three of 
those shootings, assault weapons had been used.
 In the chart above, green indicates ‘yes’ and red ‘no’. Gray boxes indicate 
no information is available to answer the question. Numbers refer to the 
shootings ranked by number of fatalities, with 1 being the deadliest.
