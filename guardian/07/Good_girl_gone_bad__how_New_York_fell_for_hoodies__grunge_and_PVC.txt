The Park Avenue Princess with a fur coat and a caramel blow dry has been one 
of the lead characters in the New York fashion soap opera since, well, forever. 
But – so far, this fashion week – she seems to have taken leave of Manhattan 
completely. Instead,New York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> 
fashion has a new muse for AW16: a much feistier one, who wears hoodie dresses 
and stomps around in PVC boots. Glossy chic is out, and haute snarl is in.

It was Rihanna who, perhaps predictably, opened up New York’s bad-gal wardrobe 
account. She, likeKanye West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/11/will-kanye-west-triumph-are-the-four-fashion-capitals-over-new-york-fashion-week-is-asking-questions>
, has started moonlighting at New York fashion week. In her role as creative 
director of Puma (insert eye roll if you feel the need), Rihanna held a catwalk 
show to present herFenty collection 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/13/five-things-we-learned-from-rihannas-fenty-x-puma-show-at-new-york-fashion-week>
. The first look out was a pair of white thigh-high boxing boots worn with a 
hoodie dress. There followed a parade of subversive streetwear – furry giant 
bum bags, brothel creepers, ultra-long sleeves, black lipstick, chokers and 
MA-1 rucksack hybrids. It was athleisure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/15/work-out-leggings-fashion-trophy-fitness-wear-it-item-not-at-gym>
 for the Addams family; the uniform of kids who like to hang out in the shadows.

Meanwhile, Alexander Wang, who has based his aesthetic on a souped-up version 
of streetwear, pushed a rebellious mood. His collection was shown in St 
Bartholomew’s church, and he worked hard to make the show look as profane as 
possible. Models with chopped, dyed hair wore sheer tights, stompy boots, and
Supreme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/15/morrissey-photoshoot-dispute-supreme-white-castle>
-like slogan mohair jumpers with the words “Strict” or “Tender” written across 
them. In case the bad-girl vibes weren’t obvious enough, he sent out a skirt 
printed with marijuana leaves, a jacket with the word “county” on the back (as 
in prison, geddit) and jumbo pink cords featuring a tiny embroidered motif of a 
pole dancer on them.

The designer said he had been inspired by a 1990s image of the shop front of 
Hot Topic <http://www.hottopic.com/> – a chain that sells alternative teenage 
merchandise – music T-shirts, fake tattoos, hair dye … you get the picture. 
Weed skirts, jail references and strip clubs: these were clothes for those who 
want to look like they shop in a goth mall, rather than on Madison Avenue, 
although naturally (and without irony) the price tags won’t be any different.

This isn’t technically a trend from New York fashion week at all. Arguably, 
the trend for rebellious dressing comes from the Paris catwalk, where a cult 
label calledVetements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/03/the-fashion-12-things-autumn-winter-2015>
 has shaken up the fashion order. The label is designed by a collective 
including Demna Gvasalia, who hails from Georgia and isnow heading up the 
powerhouse Balenciaga brand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/07/balenciaga-demna-gvasalia-new-creative-director>
. Last season, Vetements eschewed showing their catwalk in a fancy 19th-century 
French chateau (standard practice in Paris fashion), opting, instead, for a 
Chinese restaurant in Belleville (considerably less standard). They sent out 
off-kilter tailoring, slogan hooded tops, acid brights, printed PVC aprons, 
thigh boots, and awkward, trailing floral dresses. The Russian designerGosha 
Rubchinskiy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/24/paris-menswear-six-talking-points-from-the-catwalks>
 and stylistLotta Volkova Adam <http://lottavolkova.com>, both friends of 
Gvasalia, walked in the show wearing a DHL T-shirt and thigh boots 
respectively. The resulting look can be summed up as deliberately wrong. 
Although it is reminiscent of 1990s grunge, it feels authentic. So authentic 
that the label has spawned its very own cult trend. A self-referential 
trend, known to insiders simply as being “a bit Vetements”.

Back in New York, a strong collection from Rag & Bone featured split tracksuit 
pants, fishtail parkas, panelled jeans and oversized knits. Even at the Lacoste 
show, where the cited inspiration was the outfits created for the French ski 
team in the late 1960s, there were details that felt like a dog whistle to 
those whose Vetements antenna was switched on. In a particularly strong and 
upbeat collection from designer Felipe Oliveira Baptista, hoodie, logoed 
dresses were again in evidence. PVC ponchos, tracksuit pants, baggy boots and 
intentionally too-long sleeves earned the complimentary, reductive, muttered 
review “that was a bit Vetements” from the front row. That’s not repetition. 
This was the phrase of the week.

The snarly mood – in wardrobe terms at least – is reverberating off 
the catwalk too. The Vetements effect has taken hold of the front row and 
the street-style peacocks alike. A pair of Vetements jeans – panelled, 
distressed and sculpted loose against the leg, which retail for upwards of 
£800, were cooed over, while, outside the shows, beanie hats and the brand’s 
logoed storm coat looked right in the city’s sub-zero freezing weather.

In terms of trends from the catwalks, this is very early days; the shows are 
continuing in New York for the rest of the week, and London, Milan and Paris 
have all yet to reveal their hand. But in the first week of catwalk season, the 
Vetements vibe is strong. Fashion’s mood is changing. It’s time to toughen up, 
put on your hoodie and get your snarl on.
