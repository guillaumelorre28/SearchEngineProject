Key moments from tonight’s Democratic town hall forum

Hampshire. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images 
Answering questions from Anderson Cooper and the audience on topics ranging 
fromWall Street regulation and Supreme Court nominations to rural heroin 
epidemics and climate change, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Bernie Sanders 
highlighted some key differences between their candidacies - and some 
surprising similarities.

 * Sanders told Cooper that his faith is a matter of community and inclusion, 
saying that “he wouldn’t be here” running for president unless he had a strong 
religious backbone that “guides my life.” “Everyone practices religion in his 
own way,” Sanders said.“My spirituality is that we are all in this together.” 
 * Clinton said that Sanders’ bashing of her progressive credentials is 
unnecessarily exclusionary: “Under the definition that was flying around on 
Twitter and statements by the [Sanders] campaign, President Obama would not be 
a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not 
be a progressive, even the late, great Paul Wellstone would not be a 
progressive.I’m not gonna let that bother me – I know where I stand, I know who 
stands with me.”

 * Sanders said of Clinton’s progressive bona fides that “I do not know any 
progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15m from Wall Street. That’s just 
not progressive.” 
 * Clinton declares that not only does she have a litmus test for judicial 
appointments,“I have a bunch of litmus tests,” Clinton said. “I’m looking for 
people who understand how the real world works, who don’t have a knee-jerk 
reaction to support business, to support the idea that money is speech.” 
 * Sanders slammed Donald Trump’s statements on immigrants and climate change 
in one fell swoop:“Trump is, as you know, a well-known scientist. Brilliant 
scientist. And he has concluded after years of studying the issue that climate 
change is a hoax brought to us by the Chinese. I would’ve thought that he’d say 
that it was a hoax brought to us by the Mexicans.”  Bernie Sanders at the

Hillary Clinton responds to Bernie Sanders’ statement after the Iowa caucuses 
stating that his the only Democratic campaign that doesn’t have a super PAC:

“That’s just not the case” that she’s in the pocket of Wall Street, Clinton 
said. During her time in the US senate, “There was no doubt that I took on a 
lot of what was going out on Wall Street including calling them out on the 
mortgage issues... and calling for changes in CEO pay.”

“But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody 
that I know who looks at what’s happening in this campaign sees the same thing: 
the Wall Street interests, the corporate interests are spending a lot of money 
trying to defeat me! I find it a strange argument.”

Jeb Lund

Hillary Clinton just deflected a tough question with an old cliché, says Jeb 
Lund, and the reasons for doing so are clear:


A man who has a form of colon cancer and is potentially terminal, asks Clinton 
about the options for people to die with dignity.

Clinton gives a long answer. She begins it with: “We need to have a 
conversation in this country”.

Can we put this to bed forever, please? It’s very easy to have an opinion on 
this, andHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
surely has one. It’s just probably not an opinion that wins with enough 
demographics to make it worth expressing.

Clinton ends with: “I don’t have an easy or glib answer for you”. But this is 
an easy and glib answer. “Let’s have a conversation” is glib to the point of 
cliché.

She says that she would want to immerse herself in the scientific and medical 
and religious writing on the subject before answering, but nobody needs to. 
Either you believe that people with no hope or no remission from suffering have 
the right to die, or you don’t.

Hillary Clinton, for one of the first times during the 2016 presidential 
campaign, touches on the history of her marriage and its difficulties during 
the late nineties:

“I’ve had to be in public dealing with some very personal issues,” Clinton 
said, her voice growing slightly quieter. “I read a treatment of the ‘prodigal 
son’ parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen... and there was a line in there that 
became a lifeline for me: ‘Practice the discipline of gratitude.”

#RealTalk: Hillary Clinton got more animated talking about the “vast 
right-wing conspiracy” than she has on any other policy question during the 
first half-hour of the town hall forum.

Granted, the former first lady has a quarter-century-old axe to grind with the 
Republican establishment, but for voters - particularly the young voters whose 
votes she said she would “work hard for” earlier in the night - who aren’t as 
personally invested in Clinton’s battles with the right wing, the answer might 
have been off-putting.

Donald Trump’s jet makes emergency landing in Tennessee

Billionaire Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s private plane 
made an emergency landing in Nashville, Tennessee, on Wednesday because of 
“engine trouble,” according to Reuters. Trump’s Boeing 757 - nicknamed “Trump 
Force One” - was flying to Little Rock, Arkansas, from New York when it landed 
at Nashville International Airport. Trump traveled the rest of the way in a 
small charter aircraft, a campaign spokeswoman said.

The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.

Clinton hit back hard on Sanders’ comments on her lack of of progressivism 
<https://storify.com/dmartind/some-days> notes Jeb Lund:


Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> said: 
“It’s interesting that Senator Sanders is setting himself up to be the 
gatekeeper on who is and isn’t progressive ... By those definitions, president 
Obama isn’t a progressive, vice-president Biden isn’t progressive”. She’s 
right, they weren’t!

Of course, that’s not the point that Clinton is making. If you like Bernie 
Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>, this exchange 
probably made you see red, because it’s very cynical. If you support Hillary 
Clinton, this was just about the best answer she could give.


It plays to the identity-politics pitch she’s making to women voters, while 
signaling to African-American voters in South Carolina that she understands 
their desire to be heard and validated.


It suggests that Bernie Sanders is another man telling Hillary Clinton what 
she can’t do, while he’s telling African-American voters that America’s one 
black president is bad.

That’s it from us for tonight. We’ll be back tomorrow for the lead-up to the 
final Democratic presidential debate before theNew Hampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire> primaries!

Check out Adam Gabbatt’s dispatch from Derry, New Hampshire, to see where 
things stand at the end of the night:

New Hampshire town hall: Clinton and Sanders spar over progressive record

Answering questions from Anderson Cooper and the audience on topics ranging 
fromWall Street regulation and Supreme Court nominations to rural heroin 
epidemics and climate change, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Bernie Sanders 
highlighted some key differences between their candidacies - and some 
surprising similarities.

 * Sanders told Cooper that his faith is a matter of community and inclusion, 
saying that “he wouldn’t be here” running for president unless he had a strong 
religious backbone that “guides my life.” “Everyone practices religion in his 
own way,” Sanders said.“My spirituality is that we are all in this together.” 
 * Clinton said that Sanders’ bashing of her progressive credentials is 
unnecessarily exclusionary: “Under the definition that was flying around on 
Twitter and statements by the [Sanders] campaign, President Obama would not be 
a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not 
be a progressive, even the late, great Paul Wellstone would not be a 
progressive.I’m not gonna let that bother me – I know where I stand, I know who 
stands with me.”

 * Sanders said of Clinton’s progressive bona fides that “I do not know any 
progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15m from Wall Street. That’s just 
not progressive.” 
 * Clinton declares that not only does she have a litmus test for judicial 
appointments,“I have a bunch of litmus tests,” Clinton said. “I’m looking for 
people who understand how the real world works, who don’t have a knee-jerk 
reaction to support business, to support the idea that money is speech.” 
 * Sanders slammed Donald Trump’s statements on immigrants and climate change 
in one fell swoop:“Trump is, as you know, a well-known scientist. Brilliant 
scientist. And he has concluded after years of studying the issue that climate 
change is a hoax brought to us by the Chinese. I would’ve thought that he’d say 
that it was a hoax brought to us by the Mexicans.”  Bernie Sanders at the

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, pressed 
on why she accepted so much money from Goldman Sachs for three speeches given 
for the investment behemoth:

That’s what they offered.
 
Hillary Clinton responds to Bernie Sanders’ statement after the Iowa caucuses 
stating that his the only Democratic campaign that doesn’t have a super PAC:

“That’s just not the case” that she’s in the pocket of Wall Street, Clinton 
said. During her time in the US senate, “There was no doubt that I took on a 
lot of what was going out on Wall Street including calling them out on the 
mortgage issues... and calling for changes in CEO pay.”

“But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody 
that I know who looks at what’s happening in this campaign sees the same thing: 
the Wall Street interests, the corporate interests are spending a lot of money 
trying to defeat me! I find it a strange argument.”
 
Hillary Clinton just deflected a tough question with an old cliché, says Jeb 
Lund, and the reasons for doing so are clear:


A man who has a form of colon cancer and is potentially terminal, asks Clinton 
about the options for people to die with dignity.

Clinton gives a long answer. She begins it with: “We need to have a 
conversation in this country”.

Can we put this to bed forever, please? It’s very easy to have an opinion on 
this, andHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
surely has one. It’s just probably not an opinion that wins with enough 
demographics to make it worth expressing.

Clinton ends with: “I don’t have an easy or glib answer for you”. But this is 
an easy and glib answer. “Let’s have a conversation” is glib to the point of 
cliché.

She says that she would want to immerse herself in the scientific and medical 
and religious writing on the subject before answering, but nobody needs to. 
Either you believe that people with no hope or no remission from suffering have 
the right to die, or you don’t.
 
Hillary Clinton, for one of the first times during the 2016 presidential 
campaign, touches on the history of her marriage and its difficulties during 
the late nineties:

“I’ve had to be in public dealing with some very personal issues,” Clinton 
said, her voice growing slightly quieter. “I read a treatment of the ‘prodigal 
son’ parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen... and there was a line in there that 
became a lifeline for me: ‘Practice the discipline of gratitude.”
 
#RealTalk: Hillary Clinton got more animated talking about the “vast 
right-wing conspiracy” than she has on any other policy question during the 
first half-hour of the town hall forum.

Granted, the former first lady has a quarter-century-old axe to grind with the 
Republican establishment, but for voters - particularly the young voters whose 
votes she said she would “work hard for” earlier in the night - who aren’t as 
personally invested in Clinton’s battles with the right wing, the answer might 
have been off-putting.
 
Anderson Cooper: Do you still believe in the ‘vast right-wing conspiracy’? 

Hillary Clinton: Don’t you?
 
I view that as perversely flattering.”

Donald Trump’s jet makes emergency landing in Tennessee

Billionaire Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s private plane 
made an emergency landing in Nashville, Tennessee, on Wednesday because of 
“engine trouble,” according to Reuters. Trump’s Boeing 757 - nicknamed “Trump 
Force One” - was flying to Little Rock, Arkansas, from New York when it landed 
at Nashville International Airport. Trump traveled the rest of the way in a 
small charter aircraft, a campaign spokeswoman said.

The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.
 
Anderson Cooper asks Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> if she would support 
making women sign up for the Selective Service, as men over the age of eighteen 
are currently required to do.

“From my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not 
do anything that undermines, it because it has provided a solid core of people 
who are willing to serve our country. The idea of having everybody register 
concerns me unless we have a better idea of where that’s going to come out.”
 
Clinton hit back hard on Sanders’ comments on her lack of of progressivism 
<https://storify.com/dmartind/some-days> notes Jeb Lund:


Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> said: 
“It’s interesting that Senator Sanders is setting himself up to be the 
gatekeeper on who is and isn’t progressive ... By those definitions, president 
Obama isn’t a progressive, vice-president Biden isn’t progressive”. She’s 
right, they weren’t!

Of course, that’s not the point that Clinton is making. If you like Bernie 
Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>, this exchange 
probably made you see red, because it’s very cynical. If you support Hillary 
Clinton, this was just about the best answer she could give.


It plays to the identity-politics pitch she’s making to women voters, while 
signaling to African-American voters in South Carolina that she understands 
their desire to be heard and validated.


It suggests that Bernie Sanders is another man telling Hillary Clinton what 
she can’t do, while he’s telling African-American voters that America’s one 
black president is bad.


Well done.
