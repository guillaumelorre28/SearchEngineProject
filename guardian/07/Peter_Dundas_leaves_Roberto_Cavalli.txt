Peter Dundas, creative director of Roberto Cavalli, has left the the label 
after only 19 months with the Florence-based label.

The Norwegian designer had previously been the artistic director of Emilio 
Pucci, which he joined in 2008, but had worked with founder Roberto Cavalli as 
head designer from 2002 to 2005 and his return was seen as something of a 
homecoming. Dundas’ mix of 1970s, rock-inspired styles and adeptness for print 
was thought to have been well-suited to Cavalli’s well-known feminine 
silhouettes, body-hugging fabrics and animal prints.

However, his debut show in 2015 received mixed reviews as he attempted to 
rejuvenate the brand with a younger, edgier feel. In subsequent collections, a 
return to his trademark bohemian look was better received.

Following Justin O’Shea’s departure from Brioni

 last week after seven months at the Italian suit brand, it marks the latest in 
a long-running saga of fashion musical chairs, with new creative directors 
taking over at Dior, Saint Laurent, Lanvin, Calvin Klein and Oscar de la Renta 
in the past year.

“I want to thank Roberto Cavalli and the Group for this valuable experience 
and I wish them the best in their future endeavours,” said Dundas. “I am 
especially grateful to the ateliers and the teams who participated in this 
adventure.”

Gian Giacomo Ferraris, CEO of Cavalli, said: “On behalf of Roberto Cavalli and 
our shareholders, we thank Peter Dundas for his contribution to the brand, and 
we wish him well for his future ... as Roberto Cavalli goes through a period of 
transformation, the design team will carry on and the appointment of a new 
creative director will be made in due course.”


Dundas’ last collection was for spring/summer 2017, shown in September in 
Milan. Cavalli have yet to name a successor.
