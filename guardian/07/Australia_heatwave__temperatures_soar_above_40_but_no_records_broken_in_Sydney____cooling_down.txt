...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Eggs

Weather: it happened.

 * Sydney attained its forecast high of 41C, but fell short of the 
hottest-ever temperature recorded in November 
 * The high for Sydney’s Observatory Hill – the official temperature for the 
city – was 40.9C, recorded just after 3pm 
 * The hottest temperature in metropolitan Sydney was recorded at 42.8C, again 
shortly after 3pm 
 * Around 2pm, many cities’ temperatures reached their Friday high: Canberra 
reached its high of 36C... 
 * ...Darwin reached 34.5C 
 * ...Brisbane reached nearly 30.9C 
 * ...and Perth attained its high of 28.6C 
 * Tasmania and Adelaide both reached a high of 22.7C – at 1.27pm and 3.51pm 
respectively 
 * Melbourne peaked (‘peaked’) at 19.1C at noon – there was even a little rain 
 * The unseasonally warm weather in New South Wales won’t last for the 
weekend, with a cold front due to sweep in later this evening 
 * You can’t cook an egg on the pavement – at least not in Surry Hills, 
Sydney. At least we can say we fried. 
Thanks for humouring us – see you on Monday, when we’ll do it all again. (Only 
joking! ...Maybe.)

Stay cool, everyone.

The Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster has confirmed that no records were 
broken at long-standing stations in Sydney today – which seems like a good 
incentive to start wrapping this blog up. We’ll have a summary soon.

Firefighters appear to be gaining the upper hand with a major blaze in Western 
Australia’s south, AAP reports.

The lightning-sparked fire at Grass Patch, Salmon Gums and surrounding areas 
north of Esperance was an emergency earlier this week, when it killed four 
people.

The victims were later named as local farmer Kym “Freddy” Curnow, 45, 
Norwegian national Anna Winther, 29, British man Tom Butcher, 31, and German 
woman Julia Kohrs-Lichte, 19.

The Department of Fire and Emergency Services said mid-morning on Friday that 
the alert level for the fire had been downgraded to an advice and the 
Coolgardie-Esperance Highway had been reopened.

The fire is stationary and contained, but not under control.

East of Esperance at the Cape Arid National Park, however, a possible threat 
to lives and homes remains.

Three separate bushfires in the park have torn through 85,000 hectares, with a 
Department of Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman saying it was looking worrying.

“We’re going to end up with a very large fire scar at the end of the day,” she 
told AAP.

It is not contained and burning near private properties.

Closest to Esperance, the third major fire in the shire at Stockyard Creek and 
Mullet Lakes also remains subject to a watch and act alert.

Earlier on Friday, DFES confirmed property losses in Grass Patch, Salmon Gums 
and Scaddan, saying two homes and 12 sheds had been destroyed.

DFES said 10 structures including Scaddan Town Hall, homes, farm machinery, 
sheds and out buildings had also been damaged.

Miraculously, Scaddan Primary School was unscathed although everything around 
it was all but destroyed.

State of play: 5pm, AEDT

Sydney 39.8C (“cloudy” – it certainly doesn’t look it from the Guardian 
Australia offices, but BoM knows best)


Canberra 34.6C (“partly cloudy”)


Darwin 33.4C (“possible early storm”)

Brisbane 28.9C (“hot and sunny”)

Perth 27.5C (“mostly sunny. Windy morning”)


Adelaide 21.6C (“cloud clearing”)

Hobart 16.7C (“morning shower or two”)

Melbourne 16.3C (“morning shower or two”)

Bondi beach shows no sign of clearing out soon, judging by this snap from my 
colleague Nikki Marshall.

The symptoms of heat exhaustion:

 * Confusion

 * Dark-colored urine

 * Dizziness

 * Fainting 
 * Fatigue 
 * Headache 
 * Muscle or abdominal cramps

 * Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
 * Pale skin 
 * Profuse sweating

 * Rapid heartbeat

I think I have at least three of them.

I’m hearing murmurings from the news desk that suggest that I might, at some 
point in the not-too-distant future, be asked to stop live-blogging the weather.

In readiness, here are some of the contributions submitted to our 
GuardianWitness assignment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/19/feeling-the-heat-in-australia-share-your-experiences>
 (which remains open for another week).

Hot as 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/564d44dae4b0a51fe2018cd4/1808392>

I tell you what, it is hot. Not even going to lie. It's a scorcher and i'm 
feelin' it. Hotter than hot on a day like this. A stinker and a half. Will be 
going out there later to give that yellow bastard in the sky a gobful.

Hoo boy, what a boiler.

Exam Time  
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/564d44dae4b0a51fe2018cd4/1808327>

Is it illegal to make university students sit 1:30 exams on days when it is 
over 35 degrees? It should be. The mere act of dragging myself into university 
is causing me to lose the will to live.

Another drought in The Wimmera 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/564d44dae4b0a51fe2018cd4/1807552>

To all the "Aircon Gen's" as I now call many who live in their climate 
controlled bubbles, get out and see what is really happening with our climate. 
Get out of your concrete jungles and see how CC and unseasonal hot weather is 
affecting not just our environment, but our capability to grow food.

The repercussions are huge.

I suggest you live a day without your climate controlled home, 
office/workplace, car or PT. Go on give it a go!

I personally have no need at home as I've retrofitted, but the impact of 
wildlife now coming looking for food and water, is whilst pleasant to see, is 
devastating on my veggie garden and water supplies.

Ketan Joshi, who works in the renewable energy industry, has tweeted graphs 
<https://twitter.com/KetanJ0> showing electricity consumption in New South 
Wales this week and this month. Just after 3pm, it was 12,282 MW (12282000000 
watts; 12 gigawatts) and climbing, he says – you can see the “obvious impact” 
of air conditioner use.

Joshi told me that, if the figures were “a little baffling”, it was because 
New South Wales has “a slightly odd energy market”.

“As with most days of significant or extreme heat in NSW, there’s been an 
increase in the state’s electrical demand – in this case, we’ve gone from 
around 8 gigawatts on Monday and Tuesday all the way up to 12 gigawatts (and 
climbing!) yesterday and today – obviously, today being much higher due to the 
utterly insane heat.

“Probably the most interesting thing to me about this is how high demand is [
which you can watch live here <http:// http://pv-map.apvi.org.au/live>] during 
the day, when solar output is at its peak, and how much demand has decreased 
over the past few years, highlighting the role rooftop solar plays in all these 
market dynamics.”

Dig into his data below.

This is a fun map 
<http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/overlay=temp/patterson=135.87,0.20,305>
 to play around with until pub o’clock. (It must be soon, right?Right?)

The Earth Null School visualisation of global weather conditions, forecast by 
supercomputers and updated every three hours. The ocean surface current 
estimates are updated every five days, while the ocean surface temperature is 
updated daily.

The current mode linked to above shows temperature, but by clicking on ‘Earth’ 
in the bottom left-hand corner you can add other features and overlays.

Meanwhile, the seven elephants at Dubbo’s Western Plain Zoo have headed to the 
zoo’s “pool” during the hottest part of the day.
“The boys particularly love the water. They get in the pools in their exhibit 
and try to dunk each other much like teenage boys would,” elephant keeper Joel 
Kerr told AAP.

it’s been in November since 1982, when it reached 43.4C, but still somewhat shy 
of that record.

A duty forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology said that temperatures across 
much of Sydney had been holding steady at around 40-41C for the last 90 minutes.

Sydney Airport was the hottest place in the metropolitan area, and close to 
the hottest place in New South Wales, with Wilcannia in the far west of the 
state reaching 44.3C just before 4pm. White Cliffs hit 44.1C at 3.08pm.

The duty forecaster said it was hard to know whether the Observatory Hill 
reading would exceed the November record of 41.8C, taken in 1982; it currently 
shows 40.6C. “It’s a matter of waiting and seeing.”

He said the Sydney area would begin to cool with a southerly change, forecast 
for later this evening. “That will be bringing quite a strong southerly wind 
and there will be quite a drop in temperature with that.”

It was expected to hit Sydney around 8pm or 9pm.

“It will reach the southern suburbs first ... Places like Cronulla will get 
the change first and places like Richmond will have to wait a little bit 
longer.”

Wind warnings had been issued 
<http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/warnings/marinewind.shtml> just after 4pm for 
several parts of New South Wales.

Weather: it happened.

 * Sydney attained its forecast high of 41C, but fell short of the 
hottest-ever temperature recorded in November 
 * The high for Sydney’s Observatory Hill – the official temperature for the 
city – was 40.9C, recorded just after 3pm 
 * The hottest temperature in metropolitan Sydney was recorded at 42.8C, again 
shortly after 3pm 
 * Around 2pm, many cities’ temperatures reached their Friday high: Canberra 
reached its high of 36C... 
 * ...Darwin reached 34.5C 
 * ...Brisbane reached nearly 30.9C 
 * ...and Perth attained its high of 28.6C 
 * Tasmania and Adelaide both reached a high of 22.7C – at 1.27pm and 3.51pm 
respectively 
 * Melbourne peaked (‘peaked’) at 19.1C at noon – there was even a little rain 
 * The unseasonally warm weather in New South Wales won’t last for the 
weekend, with a cold front due to sweep in later this evening 
 * You can’t cook an egg on the pavement – at least not in Surry Hills, 
Sydney. At least we can say we fried. 
Thanks for humouring us – see you on Monday, when we’ll do it all again. (Only 
joking! ...Maybe.)

Stay cool, everyone.
 
The Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster has confirmed that no records were 
broken at long-standing stations in Sydney today – which seems like a good 
incentive to start wrapping this blog up. We’ll have a summary soon.
 
Firefighters appear to be gaining the upper hand with a major blaze in Western 
Australia’s south, AAP reports.

The lightning-sparked fire at Grass Patch, Salmon Gums and surrounding areas 
north of Esperance was an emergency earlier this week, when it killed four 
people.

The victims were later named as local farmer Kym “Freddy” Curnow, 45, 
Norwegian national Anna Winther, 29, British man Tom Butcher, 31, and German 
woman Julia Kohrs-Lichte, 19.

The Department of Fire and Emergency Services said mid-morning on Friday that 
the alert level for the fire had been downgraded to an advice and the 
Coolgardie-Esperance Highway had been reopened.

The fire is stationary and contained, but not under control.

East of Esperance at the Cape Arid National Park, however, a possible threat 
to lives and homes remains.

Three separate bushfires in the park have torn through 85,000 hectares, with a 
Department of Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman saying it was looking worrying.

“We’re going to end up with a very large fire scar at the end of the day,” she 
told AAP.

It is not contained and burning near private properties.

Closest to Esperance, the third major fire in the shire at Stockyard Creek and 
Mullet Lakes also remains subject to a watch and act alert.

Earlier on Friday, DFES confirmed property losses in Grass Patch, Salmon Gums 
and Scaddan, saying two homes and 12 sheds had been destroyed.

DFES said 10 structures including Scaddan Town Hall, homes, farm machinery, 
sheds and out buildings had also been damaged.

Miraculously, Scaddan Primary School was unscathed although everything around 
it was all but destroyed.
 
Sydney 39.8C (“cloudy” – it certainly doesn’t look it from the Guardian 
Australia offices, but BoM knows best)


Canberra 34.6C (“partly cloudy”)


Darwin 33.4C (“possible early storm”)

Brisbane 28.9C (“hot and sunny”)

Perth 27.5C (“mostly sunny. Windy morning”)


Adelaide 21.6C (“cloud clearing”)

Hobart 16.7C (“morning shower or two”)

Melbourne 16.3C (“morning shower or two”)

Bondi beach shows no sign of clearing out soon, judging by this snap from my 
colleague Nikki Marshall.

The symptoms of heat exhaustion:

 * Confusion

 * Dark-colored urine

 * Dizziness

 * Fainting 
 * Fatigue 
 * Headache 
 * Muscle or abdominal cramps

 * Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
 * Pale skin 
 * Profuse sweating

 * Rapid heartbeat

I think I have at least three of them.

Hot as

I tell you what, it is hot. Not even going to lie. It's a scorcher and i'm 
feelin' it. Hotter than hot on a day like this. A stinker and a half. Will be 
going out there later to give that yellow bastard in the sky a gobful.

Hoo boy, what a boiler.

Exam Time

Is it illegal to make university students sit 1:30 exams on days when it is 
over 35 degrees? It should be. The mere act of dragging myself into university 
is causing me to lose the will to live.

Another drought in The Wimmera 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/564d44dae4b0a51fe2018cd4/1807552>

To all the "Aircon Gen's" as I now call many who live in their climate 
controlled bubbles, get out and see what is really happening with our climate. 
Get out of your concrete jungles and see how CC and unseasonal hot weather is 
affecting not just our environment, but our capability to grow food.

The repercussions are huge.

I suggest you live a day without your climate controlled home, 
office/workplace, car or PT. Go on give it a go!

I personally have no need at home as I've retrofitted, but the impact of 
wildlife now coming looking for food and water, is whilst pleasant to see, is 
devastating on my veggie garden and water supplies.

The "Aircon Gen" is living in fantasy land.

Ketan Joshi, who works in the renewable energy industry, has tweeted graphs 
<https://twitter.com/KetanJ0> showing electricity consumption in New South 
Wales this week and this month. Just after 3pm, it was 12,282 MW (12282000000 
watts; 12 gigawatts) and climbing, he says – you can see the “obvious impact” 
of air conditioner use.

Joshi told me that, if the figures were “a little baffling”, it was because 
New South Wales has “a slightly odd energy market”.

“As with most days of significant or extreme heat in NSW, there’s been an 
increase in the state’s electrical demand – in this case, we’ve gone from 
around 8 gigawatts on Monday and Tuesday all the way up to 12 gigawatts (and 
climbing!) yesterday and today – obviously, today being much higher due to the 
utterly insane heat.

“Probably the most interesting thing to me about this is how high demand is [
which you can watch live here <http:// http://pv-map.apvi.org.au/live>] during 
the day, when solar output is at its peak, and how much demand has decreased 
over the past few years, highlighting the role rooftop solar plays in all these 
market dynamics.”

Dig into his data below.

Meanwhile, the seven elephants at Dubbo’s Western Plain Zoo have headed to the 
zoo’s “pool” during the hottest part of the day.
“The boys particularly love the water. They get in the pools in their exhibit

Kerr told AAP.
