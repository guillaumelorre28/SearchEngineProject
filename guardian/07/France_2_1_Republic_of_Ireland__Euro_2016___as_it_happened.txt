Right, that’s it from me. Thank you for all the emails and tweets. Stick 
around on site for all the reports and reaction from Lyon, and join Daniel 
Harris for the next last-16 tie. But from me, cheerio!

Well, France march on to the last eight (with a very handy week off until then 
– funny that, eh?) and a meeting with either Iceland or England. TheRepublic of 
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland> must lick 
their wounds and set their sights on World Cup qualification in 2018 – after 
their last two performances in this tournament, they should be very optimistic 
about getting there.

81 min: Superb save from Randolph. Matuidi thumps a shot in from the angle and 
the West Ham keeper acrobatically turns it away. Ireland can’t clear though, 
and eventually Griezmann is an inch away from getting on the end of a cross.

GOAL! France 2-1 Republic of Ireland (Griezmann 61)

In the first half the possession stats were 55-45 in France’s favour, now 
they’re 76-24 and the Republic just can’t cope with the pressure. A long ball 
forward finds Giroud, who drags two defenders out of the way, and his nod down 
is perfectly played to Griezmann. He thumps his shot past Randolph from 10 
yards.

Well, France march on to the last eight (with a very handy week off until then 
– funny that, eh?) and a meeting with either Iceland or England. TheRepublic of 
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland> must lick 
their wounds and set their sights on World Cup qualification in 2018 – after 
their last two performances in this tournament, they should be very optimistic 
about getting there.
 
Peep! PEEP!! PEEEEEEEEEP!!! It’s all over. A fine, brave effort from Ireland. 
A very impressive comeback fromFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> in the second half.
 
90+4 min: Rami gets his head on the end of one last Randolph launch forward 
and that’s that.

90+2 min: We’re already deep into three minutes of added time.
 
90+1 min: Long goes down in the box, looking for a penalty. Didn’t look like 
much of a shout to me.
 
90 min: … hammered away by Rami.
 
89 min: Randolph’s clearance bounces through – Ireland throw in level with the 
edge of theFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> box …
 
87 min: Gignac scuffs another shot wide from the edge of the box.

86 min: Walters spanks a shot a couple of yards wide from the edge of the box.
 
85 min: Gignac misses a sitter eight yards out after Matuidi’s low cross into 
the box.
 
84 min: Walters tumbles on the edge of the box as Ireland tentatively look to 
build an attack but Rizzoli isn’t interested.

Herman/Reuters  
82 min: France <https://www.theguardian.com/football/france> have been much 
better in midfield since Kanté went off – and the Leicester man won’t be in the 
side for the quarter-finals thanks to his second booking.
 
81 min: Superb save from Randolph. Matuidi thumps a shot in from the angle and 
the West Ham keeper acrobatically turns it away. Ireland can’t clear though, 
and eventually Griezmann is an inch away from getting on the end of a cross.
 
79 min: France force a series of corners but the Ireland defence stands strong.
 
77 min: Much better from Gignac – this time he cuts inside and curls a 
wonderful effort against the crossbar.
 
76 min: A brilliant Coman pass splits the Irish defence and puts Gignac 
through. He should probably cut back to Griezmann but instead he cracks a poor 
effort straight at Randolph.

74 min: Coman forces a corner. Only one side look like adding to the score at 
the moment, and it’s not Ireland.
 
71 min: Just before the sending-off, Walters replaced Murphy. And just 
afterwards John O’Shea came on for McClean. And just now Hoolahan came on for 
McCarthy and Gignac replaced Giroud.
 
70 min: “It seems to me that Giroud, for all his lumbering Giroudness, is 
responsible for both of Griezmann goals,” writes Kari Tulinius, not unfairly. 
“The second with a great knockdown, the first because three Irish defenders 
rushed to cover him, leaving pint sized Griezmann with a free header.”
 
68 min: Poor old Shane Duffy. Still, he’s been through worse and come through 
it.

67 min: After some rather needless messing about in the wall – Giroud threw 
himself to the ground at one point – Griezmann slams the free-kick off the 
Arsenal man and away for a goal-kick.

through on goal again. Duffy slides in desperately and brings him down just

65 min: McClean gets in behind Rami but his pull-back is not really directed 
at a team-mate (and there were two available). Koscielny clears.
 
63 min: A new test for Ireland, then, but they should take heart from the 
knowledge that they’ve troubled their hosts on a number of occasions. One more
