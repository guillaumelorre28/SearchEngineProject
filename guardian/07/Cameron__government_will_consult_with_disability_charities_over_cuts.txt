David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has said the 
government will consult with disability charities over controversial plans to 
cut benefits “to make sure we get this right”.

George Osborne has been under pressure over the £1.3bn cut to disability 
benefits which was announced in Wednesday’s budget.

The plan has infuriated some Tory backbenchers and Labour with critics 
claiming it is unfair to press ahead with the move at the same time as reducing 
taxes for the wealthy and businesses.

Despite Cameron’s statement, Downing Street indicated the government was 
committed to pushing ahead with the cut. Osborne has insisted the government 
would “protect the most vulnerable”.

Answering questions at the conclusion of a European council summit in 
Brussels, Cameron said welfare payments to disabled people had increased by 
£4bn in real terms during his time in office.

He said: “We will always protect the most vulnerable people in our country and 
make sure they get the help they need. We are going to discuss what we’ve put 
forward with the disability charities and others, as the chancellor said today, 
and make sure that we get this right. It’s important.

“It is important that this increase in money goes to the people who need it 
most, that we make sure that the system is working properly. That’s what this 
is all about.”


Earlier, Cameron’s official spokeswoman said the task of explaining the 
changes was ongoing and the government would engage with MPs and disability 
groups to ensure the money for disability benefits was “targeted at those who 
need it most”.

Nicky Morgan <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicky-morgan>, the 
education secretary, had on Thursday evening fuelled speculation that the 
government would make a swift climbdown on its proposal in the face of Tory 
backbench revolt, saying the cuts of up to £3,500 a year per claimant were only 
a “suggestion”.

But Cameron’s spokeswoman said it was a firm policy proposal and the 
government’s position had not changed on implementing it. “We will be taking 
the opportunity to engage with colleagues who have concerns about the way it 
will be working,” she said, adding that Morgan had been reflecting the 
government’s position that the reforms were still in the consultation phase.

The suggestion that the government just needed to explain the cuts better was 
immediately rebuffed by critics.

Andrew Percy, the Conservative MP who has been leading the revolt, said: 
“Those of us who are concerned about these cuts – we understand them, we don’t 
need them explained to us. We believe they are not acceptable.” The situation 
may also be inflamed by a source close to Iain Duncan Smith, the work and 
pensions secretary, telling the BBC that Morgan “did not seem to understand” 
the changes.

The ministerial source criticising Morgan shows that the disability cuts are 
already causing cabinet tensions, although Downing Street has weighed in behind 
the education secretary, giving her full support.

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would force a vote on the 
issue in the Commons, aiming to defeat the cuts with the help of Tory rebels.

But Cameron’s spokeswoman said there was no imminent plan for an official 
government vote on the measures because legislation had not been drawn and 
would be worked on over the coming months.


Corbyn said 200,000 of the 640,000 people affected by the proposals would lose 
out as a result of the government’s plan to “arbitrarily” make the cuts. He 
told BBC Radio 5 Live the government was planning to take more than £4bn out of 
the benefit over the course of the parliament, at the same time as Osborne’s 
budget was “giving tax relief to the biggest companies in cutting corporation 
tax”.

“It is utterly appalling what they are proposing,” he said. “We will be 
forcing a vote in parliament on this. I hope and believe all opposition parties 
will join with us in that. I believe a number of Conservative MPs are so upset 
about this they too will vote against the government.”

The Liberal Democrats said that even if the measures got through the House of 
Commons, they would be looking at ways to disrupt the plans in the Lords in a 
similar way to the vote on tax credits cuts.

Morgan made her remarks on the BBC’s Question Time as she sought to defend the 
chancellor’s savings fromchanges to personal independence payments (PIP) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/15/disability-cuts-cutbacks-destroy-independent-living-budget>
 – a benefit to help people pay for the costs of living with a disability. The 
cuts of thousands of pounds a year will affect payments for aids and appliances 
for those who struggle to dress or go to the toilet.

Conservative backbenchers, led by Percy, have threatened to revolt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/17/tory-rebels-osborne-disability-benefit-cuts-just-not-acceptable>
 over the changes, which were announced in the same budget as tax cuts for 
companies and investors.

The rebels may have been emboldened by their successful challenge to George 
Osborne over tax credits 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-u-turn-scrap-tax-credit-cuts-autumn-statement>
, which he scrapped because he lacked Tory backbench support.

Morgan said the government had yet to finish consulting MPs and disability 
groups about the cuts. “It is something that has been put forward, there has 
been a review, there has been a suggestion, we are not ready to bring the 
legislation forward.”Morgan, who has said she might want to run for 
Conservative leader one day, may also have been signalling she was herself not 
entirely convinced of the need for the cuts.

Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “Nicky Morgan was 
either too ashamed to admit cuts to disability benefits are Tory policy, or she 
was signalling the start of a sharp U-turn. Either way, she and the rest of the 
Tories are quickly realising there’s no justification for these cruel cuts.

“They should now do the fair, sensible thing. Scrap these cuts completely and 
spare hundreds of thousands of disabled people who’ve already suffered enough 
under the Tories.”

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the cuts would hit 370,000 people, with 
an average loss of £3,500 a year.

Percy accused the chancellor of hitting “exactly the wrong people”. “This is 
about need, it is not about welfare reform. These people have these needs. 
These needs are not going away and therefore the payments should not go away,” 
the MP for Brigg and Goole said.

“The difference on this to tax credits is, although difficult to sell and 
wrongheaded, people who lost out from them would eventually be compensated 
through the system. Whereas that is not the case [with PIP payments]. They will 
be permanently dis-benefited. That is where it is much harder for a lot of 
[Conservative] colleagues to swallow than the tax credit changes.”

Writing for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/disability-benefits-need-reform-cuts-pip-wrong>
, David Burrowes, a Tory backbencher, said he supported welfare reforms that 
had the interests of the vulnerable at heart but remained unconvinced by the 
cuts to PIP.

“When families containing a disabled individual are vastly more likely to 
endure poverty than other families we need to handle with great care cuts to 
disability benefits. Recent costs and court cases suggest that PIP is clearly 
in need of reform and review. If there are to be cuts to PIP they need to be 
fully justified on the basis of reform, rather than just a cost-cutting 
measure. The government should press on with its commitment to reform 
disability benefits but in the meantime it should press pause on these cuts to 
PIP.”

Meawhile, Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the health committee, 
joined those expressing disquiet about the changes. She tweeted:
