Chris Mitchell’s dearly beloved gathered at New South Wales parliament on 
Friday to farewell his relevance.

His book, Making Headlines, was launched by Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> in what was 
likely one of the last times the former Australian editor-in-chief, Courier 
Mail editor and News Corp Australia journeyman would be able to command such a 
luminous crowd of past and present heavyweights.

The editors of the Australian and the Daily Telegraph, Paul “Boris” Whittaker 
and Chris Dore, dutifully came to pay their respects. Whittaker even allowed 
himself a self-satisfied grimace as he enjoyed an intimate conversation with 
the prime minister in front of about five flashing cameras.

Taking the floor, Mitchell revealed Turnbull had read the book weeks before it 
was published and given feedback, the specifics of which were not divulged. The 
book has delivered on the ordinary title and indeedmade headlines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/13/rupert-murdoch-hurt-by-closeness-of-wendi-deng-and-tony-blair-editor-reveals>
, mainly about what Mitchell has chosen to divulge fromprivate, off-the-record 
conversations with successive prime ministers

.

Mitchell said he had no concerns about whether he had fractured the 
relationship between journalists and politicians.


“Noooooo, of course not,” he said.

Why no worries?

“Well they’re lame stories aren’t they? They’re funny. It’s not like people 
briefing me about news stories – it’s social events.”

The book details Kevin Rudd’s leaking, including to undermine the mining tax 
andWayne Swan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/wayne-swan>, and revealed Rudd 
let Mitchell listen to the conversation he had with US president George W Bush 
in which Bush allegedly asked, “What’s G20?”

Mitchell said in his speech he “did not kick down, or kiss up”.

There were no other prime ministers in sight, but what the launch lacked in 
political star power it made up for in the sheer number of past and present 
employees of the Australian newspaper.

The roll call included Paul Kelly, Hedley Thomas, Sharri Markson, Judith 
Sloan, Clive Mathieson, Justine Ferrari, Niki Savva and Piers Akerman.

 The atmosphere was one of affection combined with mild curiosity. Mitchell 
was once a very powerful man, but not any more.

Businessman Dick Smith and ABC chairman James Spigelman were among the guests, 
and the eclectic mix made for interesting hushed conversations.

“Lachlan Murdoch is furious about this book.”

“John Howard apparently doesn’t care that much.”

Turnbull regaled everyone with the thrilling story of using the New South 
Wales parliament library to study for his law degree before some carefully 
selected words on the book.

It was a “plain English account” that showed Mitchell’s passion for 
newspapers. The Australian was a “great newspaper ... led with great insight, 
with great intellectual ability, but also a great love and great passion for 
the industry”.

“I am deeply touched by the passion you’ve shown in this ... You’re a tough 
guy but you’ve always had a very big heart,” Turnbull finished triumphantly 
before wishing Mitchell “good luck” with sales.

“I hope your book does very well and does not disappoint the publisher [Louise 
Adler of Melbourne University Press] because she makes her authors feel very 
guilty if you don’t recover the advance.”

Mitchell, it turned out, had refused to accept an advance as he wasn’t sure he 
wanted to write a book. He ended up writing Making Headlines in 10 weeks, 
working on it two hours a day, five days a week.

He must have found the experience rewarding, as he has signed up to write a 
second. He would not confirm the topic, only that it was not a sequel to Making 
Headlines, and not a fantasy novel.
