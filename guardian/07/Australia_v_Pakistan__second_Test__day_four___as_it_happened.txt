Australia end day four 465-6 - a lead of 22

Jonathan Howcroft

Australia have done their best to make a game of this, rattling along at 4.08 
rpo but the weather has surely denied them the opportunity of sealing the 
series with just one day remaining.

Centuries to David Warner and Steve Smith further enhance their already 
fearsome reputations, while Usman Khawaja’s 97 and Peter Handscomb’s 54 
indicate a solid batting order is finally taking shape after the disastrous 
start to the summer. However, failures at the crease by Nic Maddinson and 
Matthew Wade means selectors still have plenty to ponder ahead of the New Year 
Test in Sydney.

Play will get underway at 10am tomorrow - and the forecast is for it to be 
dry. We’ll be here again to see if Australia can pull a rabbit out of a soggy 
hat.

Play abandoned for the day

The umpires have called a halt to day four of a frustrating Boxing Day Test 
that now seems destined to end in a draw.

The good news is after that band of stringy orange storm passes from west to 
east, there should be a break in the rain, possibly long enough to dry the 
playing surface and, you know, play cricket.

Update 3.25:

Ian Healy’s delivered an update from the MCG outfield from under a big golf 
umbrella. It’s still raining, dark, and puddles are forming on the edge of the 
square. There’s no chance of play any time soon and if I was a gambling man I’d 
suggest the day was on its way to being washed out.

In the background of Healy’s cross was this little trooper. Braving the 
downpour in nothing but his replica creams with only a patriotic banner for 
cover.

Based on the experience of Watermelon Boy (TM) last summer, expect this tacker 
to be hosting his own breakfast show on mainstream TV this time next week.

Azhar Ali update:

Good news for Pakistan with Azhar Ali reportedly fine after the sickening blow 
to his helmet fielding at short-leg. He’s passed a concussion test and will bat 
in the second innings.

3.11pm Update:

Play should now be underway after that early tea interval. It isn’t. It’s 
raining, it’s dark and the square is covered.

Consequently overs will now be lost, and who knows, the rest of the day could 
be washed out. 42.1 overs are still scheduled to be bowled.

Thanks Russell, outstanding service this Test match. My arrival, of course, 
means it’s raining. I am a good luck charm for gardeners and waterfowl 
throughout Australia.

This is a different weather occurrence to recent days. There’s a hefty storm 
cell passing through the state and we’re in for a series a heavy thundery 
showers. The question is how many, and how much damage will they cause? I’ll 
keep you updated.

That’s it from me, but JP Howcroft will be joining you now and has the 
unenviable task in the first place of finding different ways to describe rain. 
Make him feel at home by sending rain-based YouTube clips and bad puns.

Yep, it’s bucketing down at the MCG

Not good. The full covers are on and again the MCG ground staff are put to 
work. Poor blokes. They’ve had an absolute ‘mare all four days of this game.

Tea on day four - Australia 465-6

Bad light stopped play

It’s 2:52pm local time and the covers are coming onto the pitch, so you’d say 
that rain is imminent at the MCG.

Steve Smith reaches his century!

114th over: Australia 465-6 (Smith 100, Starc 7)

Umpires Ravi and Gould conference for a good minute or so before the start of 
this Sohail Khan over but decide against departing for bad light, though 
they’re signalling with various hand gestures to the ground staff, so we can’t 
be far away from a downpour.

Steve Smith takes strike, with three to get for his hundred, and cracks a 
square drive straight at point and the safe stopping hands of Yasir. Three 
balls left. Another umpire conference. We’re not here to see you guys! They 
decide against departure. Cheers around the ground! Then... Smith cracks one 
through cover and sets off for the three runs that’ll do the job. He gets 
there! It’s another super hundred from the Aussie skipper, who salutes the 
crowd after reaching his milestone from 168 deliveries across 287 minutes of 
almost flawless Test batting. That’s 17 Test hundred now. He’s a batting 
machine.

AND THEN THEY DO GO OFF! That’ll be it for now. Five balls into the Sohail 
Khan over we’ll have delay. Early tea? I guess so.

113th over: Australia 461-6 (Smith 97, Starc 6)

Smith gets a single and moves to Khawaja’s mark from earlier, and will 
probably hope he can do the business before the rain comes. The MCG ground 
staff are now hovering by the edge of the boundary with their covers and Starc 
actually picks them out with a huge six over cow from the bowling of Yasir. Do 
they get overtime for fielding as well? It was a fair old way to get off the 
mark by Starc.

112th over: Australia 454-6 (Smith 96, Starc 0)

Sohail continues to the new man Starc and perhaps casting his mind back to his 
own innings, he sends down a bouncer first up and then almost takes an outside 
edge. He’s a man transformed with that Wade wicket.

Meanwhile, this is kind of asking for trouble, and the word “stellar” has 
apparently taken on a new meaning I’m unaware of.

WICKET! Wade c Shafiq b Sohail 9 (Australia 454-6)

Wade slashes at a loose one and departs! Eek, that was pretty ugly cricket. 
It’s a ‘hit me’ ball from Sohail outside off stump but Wade’s ungainly slash 
takes a thick edge through to Asad Shafiq at second slip, and he’s on his way 
for another low score. Australia again seem to be squandering their late 
innings.

111th over: Australia 454-5 (Smith 96, Wade 9)

There’s a single for each batsman in this Yasir over and as it progresses, the 
Melbourne sky darkens more than a little. Hmm, this could be the thunderstorm 
forecast earlier.

110th over: Australia 451-5 (Smith 95, Wade 8)

A lot of bowlers have an unfortunate weakness for bowling ‘boundary balls’ 
with the final delivery of the over. Sohail, on the other hand, continues to 
bowl them first up and this over is no different. Smith is the beneficiary 
here, and he’s in to the nervous 90s now and cuts a single to finish the over 
and maintain the strike.

Reader Tilo Forbes arrives now. “I’m wondering why this game is strongly 
marching to an obvious draw, despite the hopes of Channel Nine. It wasn’t 
really the weather or the over rate, even though they clearly didn’t help. On 
your excellent match report, the majority lamented the age old “it’s the 
drop-in wickets”, which is as helpful as “bigger bats” or “T20 destroying Test 
cricket”.”


“The MCG drop-in has created a result in all three shield games this year (all 
Vic Victories, so Vics do it better yada yada). So the curator certainly can 
make wickets that help bring balance between bat and ball. Is there a clear 
direction by cricket Australia (and channel 9??) to get the full 5 days? The 
shorter pink ball tests show that people don’t mind less days (ratings and 
spectators in ground), while I would say this is doing a but of damage to the 
game? Or will I look like a complete and utter fool once Pakistan collapse to a 
defeat in two sessions tonight and tomorrow chasing 150?”

“Also, who gets in for Maddinson? Lynn due to his amazing T20 skills? Maxi to 
stop the stars from winning the big bash? So many questions.”

I’d love to see Maxwell come in but let’s just say that ain’t happening for 
now. Lynn? Love him. He’s a cleaner ball-striker than nearly anyone in 
Australia right now, Warner included. Flat sixes. Scary stuff. Umpires must be 
bricking it standing down the other end when he’s in full flow.

109th over: Australia 447-5 (Smith 90, Wade 8)

And we’re back at it, with Azhar off the ground being treated and Yasir 
sending down the final delivery of the over to Wade. He sees it off and we’re 
now 45 minutes from tea on day four. Needlessly, Australia have lost wickets 
today and face the prospect of a long day in the field tomorrow unless Wade and 
the underperforming tail can come good.

A horrible injury to Azhar Ali

109th overs Australia 447-5 (Smith 90, Wade 8)

This is terrible. Matthew Wade has played a full-blooded pull shot off Yasir 
and it’s cannoned into the helmet of a ducking Azhar at short leg. Let’s hope 
he’s OK. He’s standing up now and conscious but it’s a frightening moment. He’s 
being treated by medical staff from both sides, Dr Peter Brukner included, and 
walks off the ground unaided, which is a good sign.
cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) 
Oh no. Wade has smashed a pull shot and it has hit Azhar in close. Let's hope 
he's ok...#AUSvPAK <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvPAK?src=hash>

108th overs Australia 445-5 (Smith 89, Wade 7)

Sohail Khan appears for a new spell and as ever, gets flogged for a boundary 
off his first delivery when Smith deposits a half-tracker between fine leg and 
deep square leg. I wish I had a dollar for every time that has happened with 
Sohail. I’d have about five dollars. He has a wicket form earlier in the form

106th and 107th overs: Australia 439-5 (Smith 84, Wade 6)

Apologies for the delays in this update folks but I’m having more technical 
difficulties than Wahab Riaz, who is driven for three by Wade before Yasir 
concedes two in his over. Apparently there are 6,600 in the MCG at present. I’d 
like perform an audit on that figure, though I guess there are a few out the 
back of the member’s sinking beers.

105th over: Australia 434-5 (Smith 84, Wade 1)

Yasir will bowl far better spells than this one in his career but the 
Maddinson wicket was reward for perseverance in the face of some very unhelpful 
conditions. He’s bowling now to Wade, who sweeps around the corner to get off 
the mark.

WICKET! Maddinson b Yasir 22 (Australia 433-5)

Maddinson goes! Hmm, that wasn’t great. The No6 dances down the pitch to a 
full one from Yasir and has a fresh air shot with his drive, so gets bowled. If 
it’d missed he would have been stumped regardless. That’s that then. He’s gone 
for 22 from 55 deliveries. Will they stick with him for Sydney? I’m not 
entirely sure they should.

104th over: Australia 433-4 (Smith 84, Maddinson 22)

The crowd finally comes alive as Smith scythes a square drive through point 
and hits the rope off Wahab. Bang! That one flew of the middle. Not for the 
first time the batsmen received unscheduled drinks and new gloves at the end of 
the over but you can’t exactly blame them. Even the press box is swelteringly 
hot today. We have Cornetto’s, Steve Smith has batting gloves.

102nd over: Australia 424-4 (Smith 77, Maddinson 20)

As Wahab continues an announcement arrives via the MCC, which will be of 
interest to those planning to attend the New Year’s Day Big Bash match.

“Cricket fans attending the New Year’s Day Big Bash League Melbourne derby 
between the Stars and Renegades at the MCG on Sunday are strongly advised to 
pre-purchase tickets and arrive early, with a crowd of more than 80,000 
expected,” it says.

“The action will commence with a Women’s BBL match at 1.45pm, ahead of the 
men’s game at 6.10pm. All gates will open at 12.45pm, and one ticket gains 
entry to both matches.Be prepared and arrive early. The corresponding match at 
the MCG last summer (January 2 this year) attracted 80,883 fans - a record for 
Australian domestic cricket - and with similar numbers predicted on Sunday, 
fans are urged to plan ahead to ensure they don’t miss a minute of the action.”

“The bag checks and wanding processes which have occurred throughout 2016 will 
again take place at the stadium gates, and patrons should allow plenty of time 
to get into the stadium. In addition, attendees are advised to pre-purchase 
their tickets online to avoid delays at ticket windows on Sunday.”

You have been warned.

101st over: Australia 422-4 (Smith 76, Maddinson 19)

Maddinson gets after Yasir now, cutting him hard through gully to pick up 
three. Two to Smith is the only other damage, though I did just destroy a 
Cornetto.

100th over: Australia 417-4 (Smith 74, Maddinson 16)

He’s bowled 100 no balls in his last 16 Tests and now Wahab returns for the 
100th over of this Australian innings, switching to the member’s end and 
replacing Amir. Maddinson drops one to leg and scampers through for a single, 
and is beginning to look like he’s set for some consolation runs here. How much 
do we read into a 70-odd here, if he gets it? Probably not much.
The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) 
Smith has scored at better than a run-a-ball in his 3 innings facing Wahab and 
has only been dismissed by him once#AUSvPAK

99th over: Australia 415-4 (Smith 73, Maddinson 15)

This is basically centre wicket practice for the Australian pair now, and the 
only man on the ground showing any great enthusiasm for the game is Yasir, who 
continues to bound in like Abdul Qadir’s hyperactive nephew. His over costs 
only a single to Smith, who is sleep walking his way towards three figures.
 Australian skipper Steve Smith is having an easy time of it at the MCG.

98th over: Australia 414-4 (Smith 72, Maddinson 15)

Steve Smith picks up a couple of twos and the second of them results in a blow 
to the shin for Azhar as he takes the stumps. Not Sure how because under his 
whites he’s wearing shin guards the size of Syed Kirmani’s keeping pads.

A maiden for Yasir as Maddinson plays the role of deferential rookie against 
the left-hander. And on that note, here’s to wicketkeepers who wore batting 
pads.

96th over: Australia 409-4 (Smith 67, Maddinson 15)

Maddinson’s had a decent period of time out in the middle now and looks 
increasingly comfortable, waiting until the penultimate delivery of this Amir 
over to swivel onto his back foot and caress a single around the corner to fine 
leg. That’s the only damage for the over.

95th over: Australia 408-4 (Smith 67, Maddinson 14)

Yasir has bowled from both ends today, though sadly not at the same time. 
There are singles galore in this over; four of ‘em but nothing too loose. In 
other news, Jason Gillespie has been named assistant coach of Australia’s T20I 
side. I trust you’ll all ‘ride the pony’ around the room to celebrate.

94th over: Australia 404-4 (Smith 65, Maddinson 12)

Amir glides in for his 25th over of the innings and Maddinson is both lucky 
and unlucky, having a crisp on-drive cut off ad mid-on but reaping four from a 
streaky slash through gully and thus he reaches double figures for the first 
time in Tests. The final ball of the over beats him all ends up and he’s left 
groping at thin air as Amir snakes one past his outside edge.

93rd over: Australia 399-4 (Smith 64, Maddinson 8)

Yasir gets us under way after lunch and after a single to Maddinson he’s cut 
hard between gully and point by Smith to concede a further three runs. Mohammad 
Amir will pair with the spinner from the member’s end.

A reader suggestion

...from Rowan Sweeney: “To reward the patience of the paying customer (if 
nothing else), how about settling the match with a winner-takes-all 50 over 
match tomorrow?” Or...draft Wasim and Waqar in to have a bowl?

Lunch on day four - Australia 395-4

92nd over: Australia 395-4 (Smith 61, Maddinson 7)

Wahab has the last roll of the dice for Pakistan before lunch and it’s far 
from inspired stuff. Maddinson moves to his highest Test score but that’s about 
it. Australia have had the upper hand again but lost Khawaja for 97 and 
Handscomb for 54. We’re heading for a draw at the MCG, but at least it’s not 
raining.

91st over: Australia 391-4 (Smith 59, Maddinson 5)

Yasir comes on at the southern end now and Smith tucks him to square leg for 
one, leaving Maddinson with three deliveries to have a good look. He’s 
respectful in his defence, getting a decent stride in to a trio of leg breaks 
and smothering them.

90th over: Australia 390-4 (Smith 58, Maddinson 5)

We’re into the last ten minutes of play before lunch and the only remaining 
item of interest is whether Nic Maddinson can establish a new highest Test 
score against Sohail, but he’s happy to see off the rest of the over after a 
two and a single to his skipper. Looks like we’re going to finish off with some 
Yasir. Fun.

89th over: Australia 387-4 (Smith 55, Maddinson 5)

That’s a nice moment for Nic Maddinson. He leans onto his front foot and 
neatly glances around the corner off Amir to pick up four and equal his best 
Test score so far. Misbah maintains three slips and a gully but the young New 
South Welshman is looking comfortable.

A half-century for Steve Smith

88th over: Australia 383-4 (Smith 55, Maddinson 1)

Maddinson gets off the mark with a single, allowing Smith to take centre 
stage. He works two to bring up yet another half-century, then crunches Sohail 
through mid-wicket to gather four. Not a great game for the bowlers.

87th over: Australia 376-4 (Smith 49, Maddinson 0)

Amir draws an edge from Smith in this over but it falls short of Misbah at 
third slip, and Smith re-establishes himself by cracking a pull shot down to 
fine leg. It’s two after an athletic dive from Sohail, who looks like he’d 
prefer to be resting in the shade and sipping on some iced tea. Smith has a 
huge swish at the final ball but it passes the outside edge.

against a tiring attack. He’s got two balls to face from Sohail and watches 
both of them pass outside off stump.

WICKET! Handscomb c Sami b Sohail 54 (Australia 374-4)

Handscomb holes out! Well that was a truly odd dismissal. It’s a slot ball 
outside off stump by Sohail and the Victorian thumps a square drive straight 
into the hands of Sami Aslam at point. He’ll be livid with himself for that. 
There are runs everywhere out there and a rash shot has ended Handscomb’s 
promising knock at 54.

We’re 30 minutes from lunch now on day four and there’s no evidence that the 
Australians are planning on doing anything in what remains of this Test other 
than keeping Pakistan in the field.

84th over: Australia 371-3 (Smith 46, Handscomb 52)

I was being panned for my crowd estimates before but how bad was my weather 
prediction? The sun is beating down on the MCG now and the clouds are white and 
fluffy, rather than dark and ominous. Sohail Khan might be wishing it was 
pelting down but delivers a far better over here and it’s a maiden.

Steve Smith shines as Australia and Pakistan head towards soggy draw
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/29/steve-smith-shines-as-australia-and-pakistan-head-towards-soggy-draw> 
Australia have done their best to make a game of this, rattling along at 4.08 
rpo but the weather has surely denied them the opportunity of sealing the 
series with just one day remaining.

Centuries to David Warner and Steve Smith further enhance their already 
fearsome reputations, while Usman Khawaja’s 97 and Peter Handscomb’s 54 
indicate a solid batting order is finally taking shape after the disastrous 
start to the summer. However, failures at the crease by Nic Maddinson and 
Matthew Wade means selectors still have plenty to ponder ahead of the New Year 
Test in Sydney.

Play will get underway at 10am tomorrow - and the forecast is for it to be 
dry. We’ll be here again to see if Australia can pull a rabbit out of a soggy 
hat.
 
The umpires have called a halt to day four of a frustrating Boxing Day Test 
that now seems destined to end in a draw.

4.30pm update:

yet to be announced.

In case you missed the update on Mark Nicholas from earlier in the day.

playing surface and, you know, play cricket.

Update 3.25:

Ian Healy’s delivered an update from the MCG outfield from under a big golf 
umbrella. It’s still raining, dark, and puddles are forming on the edge of the 
square. There’s no chance of play any time soon and if I was a gambling man I’d 
suggest the day was on its way to being washed out.

In the background of Healy’s cross was this little trooper. Braving the 
downpour in nothing but his replica creams with only a patriotic banner for 
cover.

Based on the experience of Watermelon Boy (TM) last summer, expect this tacker 
to be hosting his own breakfast show on mainstream TV this time next week.

 
Azhar Ali update:

Good news for Pakistan with Azhar Ali reportedly fine after the sickening blow 
to his helmet fielding at short-leg. He’s passed a concussion test and will bat 
in the second innings.

3.11pm Update:

Play should now be underway after that early tea interval. It isn’t. It’s 
raining, it’s dark and the square is covered.

Consequently overs will now be lost, and who knows, the rest of the day could 
be washed out. 42.1 overs are still scheduled to be bowled.

Thanks Russell, outstanding service this Test match. My arrival, of course, 
means it’s raining. I am a good luck charm for gardeners and waterfowl 
throughout Australia.

This is a different weather occurrence to recent days. There’s a hefty storm 
cell passing through the state and we’re in for a series a heavy thundery 
showers. The question is how many, and how much damage will they cause? I’ll 
keep you updated.

That’s it from me, but JP Howcroft will be joining you now and has the 
unenviable task in the first place of finding different ways to describe rain. 
Make him feel at home by sending rain-based YouTube clips and bad puns.
 
Yep, it’s bucketing down at the MCG

Not good. The full covers are on and again the MCG ground staff are put to 
work. Poor blokes. They’ve had an absolute ‘mare all four days of this game.
 
Bad light stopped play

It’s 2:52pm local time and the covers are coming onto the pitch, so you’d say 
that rain is imminent at the MCG.
 
114th over: Australia 465-6 (Smith 100, Starc 7)

Umpires Ravi and Gould conference for a good minute or so before the start of 
this Sohail Khan over but decide against departing for bad light, though 
they’re signalling with various hand gestures to the ground staff, so we can’t 
be far away from a downpour.

Steve Smith takes strike, with three to get for his hundred, and cracks a 
square drive straight at point and the safe stopping hands of Yasir. Three 
balls left. Another umpire conference. We’re not here to see you guys! They 
decide against departure. Cheers around the ground! Then... Smith cracks one 
through cover and sets off for the three runs that’ll do the job. He gets 
there! It’s another super hundred from the Aussie skipper, who salutes the 
crowd after reaching his milestone from 168 deliveries across 287 minutes of 
almost flawless Test batting. That’s 17 Test hundred now. He’s a batting 
machine.

AND THEN THEY DO GO OFF! That’ll be it for now. Five balls into the Sohail 
Khan over we’ll have delay. Early tea? I guess so.

113th over: Australia 461-6 (Smith 97, Starc 6)

Smith gets a single and moves to Khawaja’s mark from earlier, and will 
probably hope he can do the business before the rain comes. The MCG ground 
staff are now hovering by the edge of the boundary with their covers and Starc 
actually picks them out with a huge six over cow from the bowling of Yasir. Do 
they get overtime for fielding as well? It was a fair old way to get off the 
mark by Starc.

112th over: Australia 454-6 (Smith 96, Starc 0)

Sohail continues to the new man Starc and perhaps casting his mind back to his 
own innings, he sends down a bouncer first up and then almost takes an outside 
edge. He’s a man transformed with that Wade wicket.

Meanwhile, this is kind of asking for trouble, and the word “stellar” has 
apparently taken on a new meaning I’m unaware of.

Wade slashes at a loose one and departs! Eek, that was pretty ugly cricket. 
It’s a ‘hit me’ ball from Sohail outside off stump but Wade’s ungainly slash 
takes a thick edge through to Asad Shafiq at second slip, and he’s on his way 
for another low score. Australia again seem to be squandering their late 
innings.
 
111th over: Australia 454-5 (Smith 96, Wade 9)

There’s a single for each batsman in this Yasir over and as it progresses, the 
Melbourne sky darkens more than a little. Hmm, this could be the thunderstorm 
forecast earlier.

110th over: Australia 451-5 (Smith 95, Wade 8)

A lot of bowlers have an unfortunate weakness for bowling ‘boundary balls’ 
with the final delivery of the over. Sohail, on the other hand, continues to 
bowl them first up and this over is no different. Smith is the beneficiary 
here, and he’s in to the nervous 90s now and cuts a single to finish the over 
and maintain the strike.

Reader Tilo Forbes arrives now. “I’m wondering why this game is strongly 
marching to an obvious draw, despite the hopes of Channel Nine. It wasn’t 
really the weather or the over rate, even though they clearly didn’t help. On 
your excellent match report, the majority lamented the age old “it’s the 
drop-in wickets”, which is as helpful as “bigger bats” or “T20 destroying Test 
cricket”.”


“The MCG drop-in has created a result in all three shield games this year (all 
Vic Victories, so Vics do it better yada yada). So the curator certainly can 
make wickets that help bring balance between bat and ball. Is there a clear 
direction by cricket Australia (and channel 9??) to get the full 5 days? The 
shorter pink ball tests show that people don’t mind less days (ratings and 
spectators in ground), while I would say this is doing a but of damage to the 
game? Or will I look like a complete and utter fool once Pakistan collapse to a 
defeat in two sessions tonight and tomorrow chasing 150?”

“Also, who gets in for Maddinson? Lynn due to his amazing T20 skills? Maxi to 
stop the stars from winning the big bash? So many questions.”

I’d love to see Maxwell come in but let’s just say that ain’t happening for 
now. Lynn? Love him. He’s a cleaner ball-striker than nearly anyone in 
Australia right now, Warner included. Flat sixes. Scary stuff. Umpires must be 
bricking it standing down the other end when he’s in full flow.
 
109th over: Australia 447-5 (Smith 90, Wade 8)

And we’re back at it, with Azhar off the ground being treated and Yasir 
sending down the final delivery of the over to Wade. He sees it off and we’re 
now 45 minutes from tea on day four. Needlessly, Australia have lost wickets 
today and face the prospect of a long day in the field tomorrow unless Wade and 
the underperforming tail can come good.
 
109th overs Australia 447-5 (Smith 90, Wade 8)

This is terrible. Matthew Wade has played a full-blooded pull shot off Yasir 
and it’s cannoned into the helmet of a ducking Azhar at short leg. Let’s hope 
he’s OK. He’s standing up now and conscious but it’s a frightening moment. He’s 
being treated by medical staff from both sides, Dr Peter Brukner included, and 
walks off the ground unaided, which is a good sign.

Oh no. Wade has smashed a pull shot and it has hit Azhar in close. Let's hope

108th overs Australia 445-5 (Smith 89, Wade 7)

Sohail Khan appears for a new spell and as ever, gets flogged for a boundary 
off his first delivery when Smith deposits a half-tracker between fine leg and 
deep square leg. I wish I had a dollar for every time that has happened with 
Sohail. I’d have about five dollars. He has a wicket form earlier in the form 
of Peter Handscomb, but he’s bowled right-arm runs most of the time.
 
106th and 107th overs: Australia 439-5 (Smith 84, Wade 6)

Apologies for the delays in this update folks but I’m having more technical 
difficulties than Wahab Riaz, who is driven for three by Wade before Yasir 
concedes two in his over. Apparently there are 6,600 in the MCG at present. I’d 
like perform an audit on that figure, though I guess there are a few out the 
back of the member’s sinking beers.
 
105th over: Australia 434-5 (Smith 84, Wade 1)

Yasir will bowl far better spells than this one in his career but the 
Maddinson wicket was reward for perseverance in the face of some very unhelpful 
conditions. He’s bowling now to Wade, who sweeps around the corner to get off 
the mark.
 
Maddinson goes! Hmm, that wasn’t great. The No6 dances down the pitch to a 
full one from Yasir and has a fresh air shot with his drive, so gets bowled. If 
it’d missed he would have been stumped regardless. That’s that then. He’s gone 
for 22 from 55 deliveries. Will they stick with him for Sydney? I’m not 
entirely sure they should.
 
104th over: Australia 433-4 (Smith 84, Maddinson 22)

The crowd finally comes alive as Smith scythes a square drive through point 
and hits the rope off Wahab. Bang! That one flew of the middle. Not for the 
first time the batsmen received unscheduled drinks and new gloves at the end of 
the over but you can’t exactly blame them. Even the press box is swelteringly 
hot today. We have Cornetto’s, Steve Smith has batting gloves.
 
103rd over: Australia 425-4 (Smith 78, Maddinson 21)

A single for each batsman off Yasir, whos enthusiasm is not exactly rubbing 
off on the rest of us. He should be sponsored Energiser.

102nd over: Australia 424-4 (Smith 77, Maddinson 20)

As Wahab continues an announcement arrives via the MCC, which will be of 
interest to those planning to attend the New Year’s Day Big Bash match.

“Cricket fans attending the New Year’s Day Big Bash League Melbourne derby 
between the Stars and Renegades at the MCG on Sunday are strongly advised to 
pre-purchase tickets and arrive early, with a crowd of more than 80,000 
expected,” it says.

“The action will commence with a Women’s BBL match at 1.45pm, ahead of the 
men’s game at 6.10pm. All gates will open at 12.45pm, and one ticket gains 
entry to both matches.Be prepared and arrive early. The corresponding match at 
the MCG last summer (January 2 this year) attracted 80,883 fans - a record for 
Australian domestic cricket - and with similar numbers predicted on Sunday, 
fans are urged to plan ahead to ensure they don’t miss a minute of the action.”

“The bag checks and wanding processes which have occurred throughout 2016 will 
again take place at the stadium gates, and patrons should allow plenty of time 
to get into the stadium. In addition, attendees are advised to pre-purchase 
their tickets online to avoid delays at ticket windows on Sunday.”

You have been warned.
 
101st over: Australia 422-4 (Smith 76, Maddinson 19)

Maddinson gets after Yasir now, cutting him hard through gully to pick up 
three. Two to Smith is the only other damage, though I did just destroy a 
Cornetto.
 
100th over: Australia 417-4 (Smith 74, Maddinson 16)

He’s bowled 100 no balls in his last 16 Tests and now Wahab returns for the 
100th over of this Australian innings, switching to the member’s end and 
replacing Amir. Maddinson drops one to leg and scampers through for a single, 
and is beginning to look like he’s set for some consolation runs here. How much 
do we read into a 70-odd here, if he gets it? Probably not much.

99th over: Australia 415-4 (Smith 73, Maddinson 15)

This is basically centre wicket practice for the Australian pair now, and the 
only man on the ground showing any great enthusiasm for the game is Yasir, who 
continues to bound in like Abdul Qadir’s hyperactive nephew. His over costs 
only a single to Smith, who is sleep walking his way towards three figures.

98th over: Australia 414-4 (Smith 72, Maddinson 15)

Steve Smith picks up a couple of twos and the second of them results in a blow 
to the shin for Azhar as he takes the stumps. Not Sure how because under his 
whites he’s wearing shin guards the size of Syed Kirmani’s keeping pads.
 
97th over: Australia 409-4 (Smith 67, Maddinson 15)

A maiden for Yasir as Maddinson plays the role of deferential rookie against 
the left-hander. And on that note, here’s to wicketkeepers who wore batting 
pads.

96th over: Australia 409-4 (Smith 67, Maddinson 15)

Maddinson’s had a decent period of time out in the middle now and looks 
increasingly comfortable, waiting until the penultimate delivery of this Amir 
over to swivel onto his back foot and caress a single around the corner to fine 
leg. That’s the only damage for the over.

95th over: Australia 408-4 (Smith 67, Maddinson 14)

Yasir has bowled from both ends today, though sadly not at the same time. 
There are singles galore in this over; four of ‘em but nothing too loose. In 
other news, Jason Gillespie has been named assistant coach of Australia’s T20I 
side. I trust you’ll all ‘ride the pony’ around the room to celebrate.
 
94th over: Australia 404-4 (Smith 65, Maddinson 12)

Amir glides in for his 25th over of the innings and Maddinson is both lucky 
and unlucky, having a crisp on-drive cut off ad mid-on but reaping four from a 
streaky slash through gully and thus he reaches double figures for the first 
time in Tests. The final ball of the over beats him all ends up and he’s left 
groping at thin air as Amir snakes one past his outside edge.

Yasir gets us under way after lunch and after a single to Maddinson he’s cut 
hard between gully and point by Smith to concede a further three runs. Mohammad 
Amir will pair with the spinner from the member’s end.

92nd over: Australia 395-4 (Smith 61, Maddinson 7)

Wahab has the last roll of the dice for Pakistan before lunch and it’s far 
from inspired stuff. Maddinson moves to his highest Test score but that’s about 
it. Australia have had the upper hand again but lost Khawaja for 97 and 
Handscomb for 54. We’re heading for a draw at the MCG, but at least it’s not 
raining.
 
91st over: Australia 391-4 (Smith 59, Maddinson 5)

Yasir comes on at the southern end now and Smith tucks him to square leg for 
one, leaving Maddinson with three deliveries to have a good look. He’s 
respectful in his defence, getting a decent stride in to a trio of leg breaks 
and smothering them.

90th over: Australia 390-4 (Smith 58, Maddinson 5)

We’re into the last ten minutes of play before lunch and the only remaining 
item of interest is whether Nic Maddinson can establish a new highest Test 
score against Sohail, but he’s happy to see off the rest of the over after a 
two and a single to his skipper. Looks like we’re going to finish off with some 
Yasir. Fun.
 
89th over: Australia 387-4 (Smith 55, Maddinson 5)

That’s a nice moment for Nic Maddinson. He leans onto his front foot and 
neatly glances around the corner off Amir to pick up four and equal his best 
Test score so far. Misbah maintains three slips and a gully but the young New 
South Welshman is looking comfortable.
 
88th over: Australia 383-4 (Smith 55, Maddinson 1)

Maddinson gets off the mark with a single, allowing Smith to take centre 
stage. He works two to bring up yet another half-century, then crunches Sohail 
through mid-wicket to gather four. Not a great game for the bowlers.

87th over: Australia 376-4 (Smith 49, Maddinson 0)

Amir draws an edge from Smith in this over but it falls short of Misbah at 
third slip, and Smith re-establishes himself by cracking a pull shot down to 
fine leg. It’s two after an athletic dive from Sohail, who looks like he’d 
prefer to be resting in the shade and sipping on some iced tea. Smith has a 
huge swish at the final ball but it passes the outside edge.
 
86th over: Australia 374-4 (Smith 47, Maddinson 0)

If ever Nic Maddinson is going to make Test runs, surely it’s on this road, 
against a tiring attack. He’s got two balls to face from Sohail and watches 
both of them pass outside off stump.
 
Handscomb holes out! Well that was a truly odd dismissal. It’s a slot ball 
outside off stump by Sohail and the Victorian thumps a square drive straight 
into the hands of Sami Aslam at point. He’ll be livid with himself for that. 
There are runs everywhere out there and a rash shot has ended Handscomb’s 
promising knock at 54.
 
85th over: Australia 374-3 (Smith 47, Handscomb 54)

We’re 30 minutes from lunch now on day four and there’s no evidence that the 
Australians are planning on doing anything in what remains of this Test other 
than keeping Pakistan in the field.

84th over: Australia 371-3 (Smith 46, Handscomb 52)

I was being panned for my crowd estimates before but how bad was my weather 
prediction? The sun is beating down on the MCG now and the clouds are white and 
fluffy, rather than dark and ominous. Sohail Khan might be wishing it was 
pelting down but delivers a far better over here and it’s a maiden.
