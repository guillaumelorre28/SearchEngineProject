The trend for musicians gatecrashing fashion week is not going away

First came the Kanye Yeezy extravaganza 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/11/kanye-west-new-album-the-life-of-pablo-launch>
 earlier this week, and now Rihanna, in her role as creative director for Puma, 
has taken a bow on the catwalk for the first time. All the fashion show 
elements were in place, including Anna Wintour and Naomi Campbell on the front 
row and Gigi Hadid on the runway. The overly dramatic dry ice, the mirrored 
catwalk and the monochrome “forest” constructed on the runway suggested that 
Rihanna was a tad more used to showmanship than your average fashion graduate 
from Parsons.

Rihanna has done her fashion homework

Somebody at Fenty HQ clearly had cult Paris label Vetements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/03/the-fashion-12-things-autumn-winter-2015>
 on the moodboard. How else to explain the opening look of lace-up white thigh 
boots and stompy hoodie minidress? To be fair to Rihanna, the oversized sporty 
top/no knickers/swagger boots vibe is something she is already very familiar 
with.

Handbags are for wimps

No self-respecting member of the Fenty squad would carry anything as 
pedestrian as a handbag. Instead giant grey furry bumbags and rucksacks 
constructed from bomber jackets are the place to keep your house keys. Let’s 
call these accessories usefully challenging.

Fenty menswear is not easy to pull off

For most men sporting deconstructed sweatpants worn with suspenders and a 
logo-ed garter is a tricky sartorial move. But Puma isn’t stupid, and the fuzzy 
hoodies had a cuddly tough-guy look that could hit the retail bullseye.

Goth black lipstick is a Thing

As are chokers, crosses, rosary beards, brothel creepers, crystal garters and 
gothic lacing. Relax grown-ups, this look will have a naturally self-policing 
upper age limit. On another beauty note, the white hair was the singer’s own 
idea. She apparently wanted an “arctic urban forest” look. And who doesn’t?
