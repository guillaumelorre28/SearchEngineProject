At the annual general meeting of Dreamworld’s parent company, Ardent Leisure, 
in Sydney on Thursday, the retiring company chairman, Neil Balnaves, said the 
company planned to “reopen the theme park as normal on Saturday” but that the 
river ride would remain closed for as long as the coronial inquest into the 
accident remained open. He offered no timeframe for its reopening.

Ardent Leisure’s chief executive, Deborah Thomas, told the meeting: “It is 
under extremely sad circumstances that we gather here. On behalf of all staff 
and management, I would like to express our deepest and heartfelt condolences 
to the family and friends of those killed.”

She said the company’s immediate concerns lay with the family and friends of 
the victims, and with guests and staff. She said the company was “deeply 
shocked and saddened” by the events.

“I understand the intense interest in this catastrophic event, but I ask for 
your patience … as we seek to establish the facts.”
