Argentina

A rich seam of attacking players but not so hot at the back. Sound familiar? 
The most successful nation in Fifa’s World Youth Championship having won the 
competition a record six times, Argentina usually lead the way in development 
and the future looks pretty rosy with Mauro Icardi and Paulo Dybala waiting to 
step into the shoes of Lionel Messi and co. In particular, hopes are high that 
Dybala – who joined Juventus from Palermo this month for €32m after managing 13 
goals and 10 assists in Serie A – could prove to be the man to take over from 
Messi when time finally catches up with him. Icardi is no slouch either having 
scored 22 goals in 36 Serie A appearances for a struggling Internazionale side, 
with rumours that he is a target for Real Madrid. Add in promising Valencia 
winger Rodrigo de Paul and playmaker Joaquín Correa and there is plenty of 
reason for optimism, even if the rest of the players available to senior coach 
Gerardo Martino do not inspire such confidence. The entire defence and 
goalkeeper are still based in Argentina, although Boca Juniors’ defender 
Lisandro Magallán is tipped for big things when he finally returns from a long 
injury layoff and the goalkeeper Augusto Batalla is rumoured to be on Real 
Madrid’s wish list.Diego ‘Chavo’ Fuchs  <https://twitter.com/chavofuchs> and

 Argentina 
Brazil

The Brazil Under-23 team have changed direction recently, with Dunga, who is 
looking after the senior team as well, taking over from Alexandre Gallo. This 
means that Dunga will lead the team in the Olympic Games next year, obviously 
an important tournament for the hosts. A lot of the players in that team – and 
in our selection – play in Europe and have made their debuts for the senior 
team. Players such as Fabinho, Marquinhos, Geferson and Fred will play in the 
Copa América this month. There is a good mix in this team, from Marquinhos, who 
has just completed his second season at PSG after a campaign at Roma, to the 
attack-minded Fred, Rafinha and Felipe Anderson, with the latter having had a 
wonderful season at Lazio. Neymar is just too old for this selection, having 
turned 23 in February. The Olympics will be an important stepping stone for 
these players but if they can cope with the pressure they will be under there, 
then the future looks bright for Brazil.Dassler Marques

 Brazil 
England

The last time we talked of a Golden Generation with England it turned out iron 
pyrite would have been a better description. So let’s not over-hype the current 
group of players who are coming through. Even a more established player such as 
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has plenty to do before he proves he is capable of 
excelling at the highest level. The defence has both potential and 
vulnerability. The goalkeeper, Jack Butland, has not progressed quite the way 
it was once hoped and Ross Barkley appears to have regressed slightly at 
Everton. On a more positive note, Barkley is worth persisting with and a front 
three of Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane and Patrick Bamford offers a good mix of 
attacking qualities.Daniel Taylor  <https://twitter.com/dtguardian>

 England 
France

France are renowned for the quality of their formation and the clubs’ youth 
academies. Two summers ago, the Under-20 team, led by Paul Pogba, were crowned 
world champions in Turkey and the core of that golden generation is surely 
destined for greater things with the senior team. Pogba, who turned 22 in 
March, is obviously the standout name. The midfielder is already one of the 
best players in the world. The defence is impressive with Kurt Zouma, Raphaël 
Varane, Aymeric Laporte or Layvin Kurzawa, while further up the field Nabil 
Fekir has been the revelation in Ligue 1 this season. The 21-year-old scored 
his first goal for France last Sunday against Belgium, in his third cap. 
Anthony Martial is only 19 but is an incredible talent, which he showed 
throughout his breakthrough season with Monaco in 2014-15, scoring 12 goals and 
impressing in Ligue 1 and in the Champions League. Among this team, seven have 
already been called up by Didier Deschamps (Zouma, Varane, Kurzawa, Pogba, 
Kondogbia, Fekir and Paul-Georges Ntep) and the others are Under-21 
internationals, with Martial and Laporte very close to a call-up to the senior 
squad. Let’s not forget as well that France became Under-17 European champions 
in Bulgaria last month after outplaying pretty much everybody and the Under-20s 
won the prestigious Tournoi de Toulon. Despite not being part of the Under-21 
Euros this month, the future of French football looks very bright indeed.Julien

 France 
Germany

One reliable indicator of German football’s new-found ability to produce 
plenty of talent is the low level of hype and noise that surrounds the next 
generation of professionals coming through. Fifteen years into the turbocharged 
revolution in youth development at club and national level, 18-year-olds who 
are regulars in the top flight – such as Stuttgart’s winger Timo Werner (64 
Bundesliga matches) – are greeted with little more than an appreciative nod. 
Although progress has been uneven for some of the youngsters, not least because 
of frequent managerial changes in their clubs, others, such as the defenders 
Antonio Rüdiger and Matthias Ginter and midfielder Julian Draxler, have already 
made it to the senior international team and have a great chance to start at 
the Euros in France. Keep an eye out for the attacking midfielder Julian Brandt 
and tall, elegant striker Davie Selke, too. With Germany qualifying for all 
five youth tournaments in 2015 – they’re the only nation to have done so – 
future national coaches will remain spoilt for choice for years to come.Raphael

 Germany 
Italy

The future of Italian goalkeeping appears to be in good hands, Mattia Perin 
having already established himself as one of the best at his position in Serie 
A. He won his first cap for Italy’s senior team last November, and is viewed 
already as the likely heir to Gigi Buffon. Alessio Romagnoli and Daniele Rugani 
may one day anchor the defence that protects him for the national team. The 
former has been compared to a young Alessandro Nesta after starring on loan 
this season for Sampdoria, and the latter started all 38 games for a newly 
promoted Empoli side who defied expectations to stay afloat with ease. The 
midfield is a little more untested, but certainly not short of promise. Up 
front, Domenico Berardi – co-owned by Juventus – has scored 31 Serie A goals in 
two seasons. Stephan El Shaarawy has endured persistent injury setbacks over 
the past two years but has time on his side.Paolo Bandini

 Italy 
Japan

Not so long ago, everything seemed rosy for Japan – a best-ever showing at the 
2010 World Cup was followed by fourth place at London 2012, and Shinji Kagawa’s 
exploits at Borussia Dortmund paved the way for a host of promising J. Leaguers 
to find opportunities overseas. But then the Kagawa generation froze in Brazil, 
Olympians stagnated on Bundesliga or Belgian benches, and the next wave is 
struggling. The U16, U19, and U23 national teams failed to make it beyond the 
last eight of their respective Asian championships last year and hence there is 
no Japanese representation at the U17 or U20 World Cups. It has thus been 
mooted that Japan might pin their hopes on the Brazilian starlet Caio, who 
attended high school in Chiba and has expressed interest in naturalisation. 
However, ambitious young players are at least now building their European 
careers at sides where they have a chance of playing – including Yoshinori 
Muto, who rejected Chelsea for Mainz. And the Samurai Blue have recently been 
buoyed by the rise of two men born in May 1992 and thus a few weeks too old for 
this list: the midfielder Gaku Shibasaki of Kashima Antlers and forward Takashi 
Usami of Gamba Osaka.Ben Mabley <https://twitter.com/benmabley>

 Japan 
Spain

Spain’s failure to qualify for this summer’s European Under-21 tournament 
denied them the chance to defend the title they had won in 2011 and 2013 and 
further undermined confidence in the national team following the senior side’s 
failure in Brazil. But despite some calls for a revolution, there is a still a 
belief in the Spanish model and a commitment to a particular way of playing 
which, while modified, remains reasonably firm. The generation of players aged 
under 23 is talented too, and many of them have already got first-team 
experience at the highest level, although there are more doubts at centre-back 
and in goal. The list is impressive, including footballers such as Javier 
Manquillo, Juan Bernat, Óliver Torres, Saúl, Denis Suárez, Marco Asensio, Samu 
Castillejo and Paco Alcácer – and some of those havenot made it into this XI.

 Spain 
Ghana

Ghana’s Under-20 setup has been vaunted ever since the team won gold at the 
2009 World Youth Championships in Egypt. Under their coach, Sellas Tetteh, 
Ghana have been able to have a conveyor belt for the Olympic and senior teams. 
The best legacy so far has been the progression of the André Ayew-led 2009 team 
which is now the core of Ghana’s senior squad. Although these Under-20s have 
just exited the World Cup in New Zealand, there is a lot of hope for the 
future, especially for Godfred Donsah, Clifford Aboagye and Yaw Yeboah.Gary
