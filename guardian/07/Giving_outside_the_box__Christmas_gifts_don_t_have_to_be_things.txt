The world is full of stuff and things, so why add to the haul with unnecessary 
Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> presents? We’re 
not saying don’t give a gift at all, but in a world of high consumption and 
hoarding why not give one that isn’t a thing.

Flight vouchers

Calla Wahlquist: For the past decade at least one member of my family has 
lived 4,000km away, so I get flight vouchers pretty regularly. It started when 
I moved to Bunbury, Western Australia, and couldn’t afford to fly back to 
Victoria to visit my parents on a $500-a-week cadet journalist salary. This 
year my sister and her partner bought me a voucher for flights to Port Hedland, 
because they are having a baby and I want to meet it.

Ensure your far-flung loved one has no excuse not to visit, or shuffle your 
favourite homebody off on an enforced adventure. Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar 
sell flight vouchers, as do booking companies such as Webjet.

Lessons

Did your friend grow up loving horses despite being raised in an inner-city 
apartment? Does your cousin never stop talking about how he could have been a 
guitar god before his corporate career took over? Is your dad’s cooking so bad 
it’s a cliché?

It’s never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks (as long as that old 
dog isn’t hoping to become a career athlete). Cooking classes, in particular, 
seem increasingly popular, and many top chefs offer one-off sessions with small 
groups. Bonus – a delicious meal at the end, as long as you don’t burn it.

Ethical gifts: think of others when you think of others this Christmas

Tickets

Elle Hunt: I was given tickets to Taylor Swift’s Sydney concert by my then 
boyfriend, the idea being he’d fly over from New Zealand to join me. Because 
they were in such high demand, it was nearly a year away, and we broke up in 
the interim. When the time came, I had to check that he did not still intend to 
come. Then I sold them both to a friend, at mate’s rates but nonetheless at a 
profit – and gotbetter seats as review tickets for free. Nailed it, really.

3D movie showings, where you sit in a big armchair and someone brings a 
champagne or whatever, are ridiculously indulgent these days but totally guilt 
free if they’re a gift. Film festivals and open-air cinemas are also excellent 
presents for movie buffs. For a gift that keeps on giving, annual subscriptions 
to theatre and ballet companies ensure you are appreciated year round.

 For those more into music, tickets to the hottest touring act go down a treat.

For those more into music, tickets to the hottest touring act go down a treat, 
but you have to buy at least two so they aren’t on their own. Some booking 
agencies also offer vouchers.

Passes and membership

Zoos, museums, galleries, golf clubs, sporting teams, gyms – there are still 
dozens of social interaction activities that don’t involve the internet. Set 
someone up for a year of cultural or artistic enjoyment, or a solid season of 
shouting at a game in real life, surrounded by lots of other people shouting at 
the game.

Experiences

One year my mother-in-law gave everyone Red Balloon vouchers for various 
experiences she thought we’d like, and because she’s pretty cluey we did 
actually like them all. (This isn’t a humorous mother-in-law anecdote – hi 
Jenny!).

Skydiving, hot-air ballooning, swimming with sharks – these are all things you 
are unlikely to do on a whim, but if someone sends you along it’s a different 
story.

Vouchers often expire, so don’t drop a bundle on a skydiving package for 
someone if they are going to wuss out or procrastinate about using it. And 
don’t toy with people too much – if someone has vertigo it’s not going to be 
funny to send them on the Sydney harbour bridge climb.

Favours

Sometimes the things people really want just can’t be bought. Personalised 
vouchers to babysit young siblings or nieces and nephews, clean your parents’ 
house or mow the lawn, are practical and appreciated. For your significant 
other, a voucher (booklet – let’s not be stingy) to massage your partner’s 
shoulders, or do something else to your partner’s something else, can really 
score brownie points as long as it doesn’t look like you just mocked them up 
that morning when you remembered what day it was.

Actual poo (and other acts of charity)

Anonymous: A friend gave her brother a trailer full of poo one year, which 
went to a developing community to help them with agriculture/fertiliser. She 
literally gave him shit for Christmas, but he couldn’t complain as it was for a 
good cause. Passive aggressive and charitably effective.

There are plenty of charities and aid organisations which let you buy 
something for someone who really truly needs it, on behalf of your friend or 
relative who doesn’t.

Oxfam 
<https://unwrapped.oxfam.org.au/choose-a-gift?gclid=CICXoPPa5dACFRVvvAodwr0LLA>
, for example, offers a range of altruistic donations-as-gifts, including 
valuable animals such as a goat or chicken, a water well, a bag of seed or, 
yes, a heap of manure.The Alternative Technology Association 
<https://www.ata.org.au/> is a non-profit organisation which installs 
solar-powered lighting in East Timorese villages.

There’s a solid chance the recipient will be mildly disappointed by this gift, 
but it’s equally unlikely they’ll show it.

Animals

It goes without saying that a pet is not just for Christmas, so please don’t 
impulse-buy someone a dog. Instead, why not help out a shelter which will end 
up looking after all those animals when too many people forget the golden rule. 
Donate to keep struggling shelters running or help a friend become a foster 
parent. This is another gift of charity on behalf of someone else but many 
shelters, such asGreyhound Rescue NSW 
<https://www.facebook.com/GreyhoundRescueNSW/>, have also gotten on to the 
merchandise game.

Further afield, a non-domesticated animal gift can be bestowed by sponsoring 
an orangutan. Several organisations facilitate this, includingthe Orangutan 
Project <https://www.orangutan.org.au/?gclid=CMLTnt3a5dACFYSYvAodoicCxA> which 
lets you “adopt” one for as little as $12 a month. One-off purchases include a 
bag of feed, puzzles, medical care, or a year at jungle school for five orphans.

Personalised entertainment

There’s no reason why you shouldn’t be directly involved in your loved one 
having all the fun. Put your creative talents to use – if you’re a writer why 
not pen a personalised story? Musicians, write someone a song. If your talents 
lie mainly in just having a really good time, stage an excellent day out for a 
friend. It could be anything from a trip to the zoo and a nice dinner somewhere 
or a completely bespoke adventure around your home town.

Stars

What is essentially buying a ball of gas which probably ceased to exist 
several millennia ago has become the ultimate in trite romantic gestures. But 
it doesn’t just have to be for Valentines Day.

There are a bunch of unofficial commercial companies that let you name a star 
in return for money, for the astronomy-mad sister or the rich uncle who already 
owns everything on the planet. Note, however, the only place that star name 
will be registered is on the company’s database.
