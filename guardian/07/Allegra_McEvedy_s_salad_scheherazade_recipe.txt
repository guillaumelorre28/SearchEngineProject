I ate a salad like this in Tangier after a particularly stormy crossing from 
Spain (I was trying to put some distance between me and a rather tumultuous 
affair). I'll always remember the soothing effect it had on both my churning 
stomach and my battered heart.

Serves 6

10 clementines
150g pistachio halva 
1 pomegranate, seeded
1 tbsp orange blossom water (or orange juice)
2 tbsp runny honey

This is a pretty pudding, so choose a plate that will contrast with the 
glistening orange clementines, the ruby jewels of pomegranate and the 
pistachio-speckled halva.

Using a very sharp knife, top and tail the whole clementines so they can sit 
flat. With a serrated or really sharp paring knife, carefully cut away the skin 
and pith, top to bottom in sections. Roll them on their sides, slice into 4 or 
5 rounds and place them on the serving plate in whatever fashion grabs you.

Cut the halva into 2cm x 1cm rhomboids or diamonds, or just crumble it over 
the clementines.

Next, sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds and drizzle with orange blossom 
water. Just before you serve, give the salad a final drizzle of honey. I know 
my sister Floss would like a bowl of yogurt with this, but I don't think it 
needs it.
