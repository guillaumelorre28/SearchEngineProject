The royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the 
Northern Territory

Keith Hamburger, the former head of Queensland Correction Services Commission 
andauthor of a highly critical report on the NT corrections system.

to have parts of Hamburger’s official statement excluded from the 
commissioner’s examination.

Hamburger, a consultant for the corrections and immigration detention sectors, 
volunteered his services to the government after reading about the government’s 
plans for a “root and branch review” of the juvenile detention system.

He said he had no dealings with the former chief minister Adam Giles, former 
attorney general John Elferink or corrections and police commissioners before 
he made his offer.

Following a now infamous disturbance at the original Don Dale centre, in which 
six youths were teargassed by staff, juvenile detainees were moved to the 
former adult prison at Berrimah, which thecorrections commissioner had labelled 
only fit for a bulldozer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/16/nt-government-defends-transfer-of-juvenile-detainees-to-former-adult-jail>
, but which underwent refurbishments and was renamed.

the ABC’s Four Corners in Julysparked the royal commission

Hamburger and his review staff visited the new Don Dale centre more than once, 
he told the commission, and his response was “disappointment, frustration that 
such a facility in this day and age exists for young people”.

Hamburger said the current Don Dale was run like a “human storage facility” 
and there was no way it could be turned into what was required for a modern 
therapeutic youth correctional centre.

“It’s ambience was very poor, it’s basically a prison, young people are kept 
in concrete cells,” Hamburger said of the refurbished centre.

“There’s evidence of lack of privacy for young people. I got the feeling it 
was a guarding environment, not therapeutic environment.”

Hamburger said he also saw evidence of previous disturbances, including holes 
gouged over a long period of time into concrete walls inside the isolated 
behavioural management units.

“What that means is the staff aren’t really in attendance and supervising 
young people,” he said.

“It also seemed to be a culture where the supervisor sat in the control room 
and watched things through CCTV cameras rather than going to interact with 
young people.”

He said his review found refurbishments of the recreation areas were “quite 
good for what it was”, but concluded in his report that “accommodating youth 
offenders in a facility that was condemned when it housed adult prisoners is 
unacceptable, and nothing will make the oldDarwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/darwin> correctional centre 
suitable for youth offenders”.

Hamburger’s report, which was required by 31 July this year, has repeatedly 
been at the centre of controversy.

Giles reneged on repeated pledges to release it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/adam-giles-juvenile-detention-report-northern-territory-royal-commission>
 before the election in August, at which the Country Liberal partysuffered a 
landslide defeat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/27/its-a-thumping-labor-wins-northern-territory-election>
.

The new Labor government then released only the executive summary and 
recommendations, citing security and privacy concerns. Aftera copy of the full 
report was leaked to media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/24/justice-minister-rejects-finding-darwin-prison-not-fit-for-purpose>
 the government released a version containing some redactions.

The report was highly critical of a former Labor government’s decision to 
commission a new 1,000-bed adult prison at a reported cost of about $1.8bn.

On Monday the commissioners refused an application by the solicitor general’s 
legal team, acting for the NT government, to have some parts of Hamburger’s 
statement excluded from consideration by the commission.

The paragraphs related to Hamburger’s investigation into construction of the 
adult prison, including that he was denied access to its “business case”. It 
also drew attention to part of his report looking at the NT’s “unacceptable 
imprisonment rate coupled with 85% of the prison population being Indigenous 
people”.


Given endemic social dysfunction and disadvantage related to both adults and 
juveniles it was “curious” that “decision-makers were prepared to invest a huge 
amount of money into a high security prison for adult prisoners but apparently 
gave no thought to the needs of juveniles caught up in the system”, he said.

The NT government lawyer also sought to have excluded Hamburger’s 
recommendations for better alternative approaches to a new prison, and his 
opinion that it was a lost opportunity to have an impact on Indigenous 
incarceration.

The NT attorney general, Natasha Fyles, told Guardian Australia she understood 
the objections were on “technical issues” and the solicitor general had been 
given “broad instructions” to cooperate with the royal commission.

Hamburger’s evidence was expected to run for more than a day. The 
commissioners, Mick Gooda and Margaret White, were set to visit various Darwin 
custodial facilities on Wednesday. Two juveniles who were at the centre of many 
of the mistreatment allegations were also expected to appear.

The commission has previously heard evidence of repeated government inaction 
on multiple reports and investigations into the state of the NT justice system, 
as well ascontributing factors to incarceration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/13/royal-commission-told-foetal-alcohol-disorder-and-hearing-loss-contributing-to-incarceration>
 such as foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

Allegations of mistreatment of juvenile detainees have continued to be aired 
in community meetings with the NT’s remote Indigenous population, including that
an officer told a young boy to drink his urine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/juvenile-detention-officer-urinated-toilet-told-boy-drink-it-royal-commission-northern-territory>
 after the boy requested a glass of water.
