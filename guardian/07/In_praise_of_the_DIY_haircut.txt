. Rafael Nadal, meanwhile, tugs on his shorts at 15-second intervals. The 
rituals of sportspeople vary wildly – one man’s melon is another man’s ticket 
to victory – so what should we make of Svetlana Kuznetsova’s decision tohack 
off her own ponytail

However, this was less a ritual and more an act of desperation (and one that 
ranks with Gary Lineker’sincident during the World Cup in 1990

 in terms of both viral potential and ghoulish voyeurism) – the Russian tennis 
player claimed her ponytail was hitting her in the eye. “Every time I would hit 
a good shot, it would hit my eye every time and I had [to] struggle,” said 
Kuznetsova, who requested a break and a pair of scissors. “I thought, “OK, 
what’s more important now, my hair, which I can let grow, or the match?”

Impromptu haircuts can go either way, as those of us who have Bic’d 
<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bic&defid=524261> their own 
hair know only too well. For famous people, it tends to go well, mainly because 
it makes a goodstory

 provided you’re not the one doing it, adding a bespoke, punkish quality to 
both the tale and the celebrity. In the 1990s, Linda Evangelista cried after 
cutting her hair off at Peter Lindbergh’s request, but it elevated her career 
immeasurably. We all watched in awe and fascination as Millie Bobbi Brown got 
her hair shaved off for her role as Eleven in Stranger Things helped, of course,
by the fact it was filmed 
<https://twitter.com/milliebbrown/status/767428947655155712>. Incidentally, 
Kuznetsova won the matchand ended up with a dismantled bob not dissimilar to 
Patti Smith’s which, incidentally, popped up in Raf Simon’s collection. Double 
win, then.
