Shares in Thomas Cook <https://www.theguardian.com/business/thomascookgroup> 
bounced 17% higher to 24.125p this morning as the troubled tour operator 
confirmed it is close to clinching a Â£1.2bn refinancing deal.

Close to collapse before Christmas, Britain's oldest holidays company now 
looks to have a two-year breather during which it will attempt to turn the 
business round.

The company said it was in "advanced discussions" with its banking group about 
extending its financing arrangements.

"These discussions are part of the result of the strategic review the group 
has undertaken since agreeing terms of a new facility in November 2011. The 
group expects to report in more detail on the results of that review by the 
time of the interim results.

"In addition to the revised financing arrangements, the previously announced 
asset disposal programme and the sale of Thomas Cook India, the group is 
exploring a possible sale and leaseback of certain aircraft."

A consortium of 17 banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays is 
expected to approve an extension of loans until 2015. Without the backing of 
the banks the 170-year old group, which has 30,000 employees, would have had to 
repay the bulk of its debt by April 2013.

Last November, Thomas Cook shares crashed by more than 75% to just 9.3p

 when the group warned it was running low on cash and had begun talking to its 
banks.

Nick Batram at Peel Hunt welcomed news of the refinancing deal that he said 
would reduce pressure on the company for a fire sale. But the turnaround task 
facing Thomas Cook would be "challenging", he warned.

"Potential CEO candidates appear to have been frightened off by this challenge 
and we would follow their lead and avoid the shares."
