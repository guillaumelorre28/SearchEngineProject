Sophie Mirabella has been appointed to a senior position in Gina Rinehart’s 
resources company, Hancock Prospecting.

The former Liberal MP was announced at the first general manager of government 
and media relations for the firm on Friday afternoon.

Rinehart praised Mirabella’s work ethic in a statement released by the company 
but did not go into the specifics of her new role.

“Sophie is not shy of hard work, and we are pleased that she has accepted this 
new challenging role with our hardworking executive team, and I look forward to 
her contribution towards the HPPL group,” Rinehart said.

She cited the growth in the Hancock business, specifically the establishment 
of the three major Hope Downs iron ore mines, the Roy Hill mega project and the 
expansion into beef and dairy, as the impetus for the creation of Mirabella’s 
role.
