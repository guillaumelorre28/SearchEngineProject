Summary

Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> gave his 
presidential farewell speech in Chicago tonight, declaring “yes we did” and 
calling on citizens to become politically engaged and uphold the values the 
country was founded on, as his eight years as president comes to an end. Here’s 
a round-up of his address:

 * The president called on citizens to maintain faith in democracy by 
participating in it, such as having an open dialogue with those that disagree 
and running for office. “Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you will win, 
sometimes you will lose,” he said. 
 * He warned against divisiveness between Americans of different backgrounds, 
including people of color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, Muslims and also white 
Americans who’ve struggled with economic changes. He quoted Attitcus Finch from 
Harper Lee’s classic To Kill a Mockingbird, who said “You never really 
understand a person until you consider things from his point of view…until you 
climb into his skin and walk around in it.” 
 * The country’s first black president also called the idea of a post-racial 
America, due to his election, “never realistic. “For race remains a potent and 
often divisive force in our society,”he said. 
 * Obama spoke about the crucial issue of climate change, saying that “to 
simply deny the problem”betrays everyone. 
 * He noted the achievements of his administration: no foreign terrorist 
attack on US soil, more Americans with health insurance, the legislation of 
same-sex marriage, the killing Osama bin Laden. 
 * Obama only mentioned president-elect Trump by name once, when saying he 
would ensure a smooth transition of power. 
 * He thanked wife Michelle, “girl from the south side”, tearing up when 
paying tribute to the first lady. He thanked his daughters and called being 
their dad the“role he’s most proud of. 
 * The speech finished with a reference to Obama’s 2008 campaign slogan: “Yes 
we can. Yes we did. Yes we can.” Facebook

Obama: 'yes we did'

Obama calls on citizens to have faith in the country.

“I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change – but in 
yours,” he says.

I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding 
documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by 
immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed 
reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface 
of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet 
written:

Yes We Can

Yes We Did

Yes We Can.

Obama thanks the crowd and is greeted by his family and the Bidens.

And now it’s final farewell time.

“My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won’t 
stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days 
that remain.”

Now Obama pays tribute to his veep Joe Biden.

“The scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware’s favorite son: you were 
the first choice I made as a nominee, and the best,” says Obama, while the 
crowd gives Biden a standing ovation. He calls Biden a “brother” and “like

Now Obama turns to the daughters (Malia is in the audience, Sasha is not).

“You have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more 
importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion. You wore the burden of 
years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I’ve done in my life, I’m most 
proud to be your dad,” says Obama.

Now Obama is getting onto the personal thank yous. He simply says the word 
“Michelle”, and the crowd erupts and gives the first lady a standing ovation.

“Girl of the South Side,” he says, as Michelle raises her fist.

“For the past twenty-five years, you’ve been not only my wife and mother of my 
children, but my best friend. You took on a role you didn’t ask for and made it 
your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,” says Obama, getting out 
a white handkerchief and wiping away tears.

Obama: 'run for office yourself'

Obama talks about being an active citizen and being political as part of your 
every day life, particularly if you’re frustrated by politics right now.

“If you’re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try to talking 
with one of them in real life,” says Obama. “If something needs fixing, then 
lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you’re disappointed by your 
elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office 
yourself.”

“Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you will win, sometimes you will 
lose.”

In what he calls his “final point”, to cheers of “no!” from the audience, 
Obama speaks about the precarious nature of democracy.

“All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of 
rebuilding our democratic institutions,” says Obama.

“Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But it’s really just a 
piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power – 
with our participation, and the choices we make.”

As Senate hearings continue into Russia’s hacking of the DNC emails during the 
election campaign - and Trump applauds leader Vladimir Putin - Obama 
specifically calls Russia a “rival”.

So let’s be vigilant, but not afraid ISIL will try to kill innocent people. 
But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our 
principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence 
around the world – unless we give up what we stand for, and turn ourselves into 
just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.

“No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an 
attack on our homeland these past eight years,” says Obama, although he notes 
the issue of home-grown terrorists such as the Boston marathon bombing and San 
Bernandino massacre.

“To all who serve, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your 
Commander-in-Chief,” he says, resulting in a standing ovation.

Obama on climate change

The president talks about climate change and the steps his administration has 
taken in the last eight years: reducing dependence on foreign oil, increasing 
renewable energies, signing the Paris Accord.

He calls on the nation to not ignore science.

“But without bolder action, our children won’t have time to debate the 
existence of climate change; they’ll be busy dealing with its effects: 
environmental disasters, economic disruptions, and waves of climate refugees 
seeking sanctuary,” says Obama.

“Now, we can and should argue about the best approach to the problem. But to 
simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations; it betrays the 
essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our 
founders.”

“Politics is a battle of ideas. That’s how democracy was designed,” says Obama.

“But without some common baseline of facts. Without a willingness to admit new 
information and that your opponent might be making a fair point and that 
science and reason matter, then we’re doing to keep talking past each other. 
And it will make common ground and compromise impossible,” he says.

Obama continues to talk about race and the divisions in American, getting huge 
cheers from the thousands in the audience.

He quotes Attitcus Finch from Harper Lee’s classic To Kill a Mockingbird, who 
said “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his 
point of view…until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”

Obama continues, specifically identifying groups that were often topics of 
political discussions during the 2016 election:


For blacks and other minorities, it means tying our own struggles for justice 
to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face – the refugee, the 
immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender American, and also the middle-aged 
white man who from the outside may seem like he’s got all the advantages, but 
who’s seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change.

Obama: post-racial America was 'never realistic'

Obama, the country’s first black president and son of a Kenyan immigrant, 
discusses race and immigration.

“After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, 
however well-intended, was never realistic.For race remains a potent and often 
divisive force in our society. I’ve lived long enough to know that race 
relations are better than they were ten, or twenty, or thirty years ago – you 
can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young 
Americans across the political spectrum,” he says.

“But we’re not where we need to be.

“All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed 
as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving 
minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while 
the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to 
invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don’t look like us, we 
diminish the prospects of our own children – because those brown kids will 
represent a larger share of America’s workforce.”

He spoke about hiring practices and discrimination in housing .

Obama on Obamacare

In a week where the GOP is actively trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act - 
and president-elect Trump calls on it to happen as quickly as possible - Obama 
talks about healthcare. He notes that the uninsured rate is lower and health 
care costs rising tat the slowest rate in 50 years.

“If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the 
improvements we’ve made to our health care system – that covers as many people 
at less cost – I will publicly support it,” he says

Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> gave his 
presidential farewell speech in Chicago tonight, declaring “yes we did” and 
calling on citizens to become politically engaged and uphold the values the 
country was founded on, as his eight years as president comes to an end. Here’s 
a round-up of his address:

 * The president called on citizens to maintain faith in democracy by 
participating in it, such as having an open dialogue with those that disagree 
and running for office. “Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you will win, 
sometimes you will lose,” he said. 
 * He warned against divisiveness between Americans of different backgrounds, 
including people of color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, Muslims and also white 
Americans who’ve struggled with economic changes. He quoted Attitcus Finch from 
Harper Lee’s classic To Kill a Mockingbird, who said “You never really 
understand a person until you consider things from his point of view…until you 
climb into his skin and walk around in it.” 
 * The country’s first black president also called the idea of a post-racial 
America, due to his election, “never realistic. “For race remains a potent and 
often divisive force in our society,”he said. 
 * Obama spoke about the crucial issue of climate change, saying that “to 
simply deny the problem”betrays everyone. 
 * He noted the achievements of his administration: no foreign terrorist 
attack on US soil, more Americans with health insurance, the legislation of 
same-sex marriage, the killing Osama bin Laden. 
 * Obama only mentioned president-elect Trump by name once, when saying he 
would ensure a smooth transition of power. 
 * He thanked wife Michelle, “girl from the south side”, tearing up when 
paying tribute to the first lady. He thanked his daughters and called being 
their dad the“role he’s most proud of. 
 * The speech finished with a reference to Obama’s 2008 campaign slogan: “Yes 
we can. Yes we did. Yes we can.”  
Obama calls on citizens to have faith in the country.

“I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change – but in 
yours,” he says.

I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding 
documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by 
immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed 
reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface 
of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet 
written:

Yes We Can

Yes We Did

Yes We Can.

Obama thanks the crowd and is greeted by his family and the Bidens.
 
And now it’s final farewell time.

“My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won’t 
stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days 
that remain.”
 
“You changed the world,” says Obama, as he pays tribute to his staff. He 
thanks them, many are wiping away tears.

“I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when 
we started,” he adds.
 
Now Obama pays tribute to his veep Joe Biden.

“The scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware’s favorite son: you were 
the first choice I made as a nominee, and the best,” says Obama, while the 
crowd gives Biden a standing ovation. He calls Biden a “brother” and “like 
family”.
 
Now Obama turns to the daughters (Malia is in the audience, Sasha is not).

“You have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more 
importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion. You wore the burden of 
years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I’ve done in my life, I’m most 
proud to be your dad,” says Obama.
 
Now Obama is getting onto the personal thank yous. He simply says the word 
“Michelle”, and the crowd erupts and gives the first lady a standing ovation.

“Girl of the South Side,” he says, as Michelle raises her fist.

“For the past twenty-five years, you’ve been not only my wife and mother of my 
children, but my best friend. You took on a role you didn’t ask for and made it 
your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,” says Obama, getting out 
a white handkerchief and wiping away tears.
 
Obama talks about being an active citizen and being political as part of your 
every day life, particularly if you’re frustrated by politics right now.

“If you’re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try to talking 
with one of them in real life,” says Obama. “If something needs fixing, then 
lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you’re disappointed by your 
elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office 
yourself.”

“Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you will win, sometimes you will 
lose.”
 
In what he calls his “final point”, to cheers of “no!” from the audience, 
Obama speaks about the precarious nature of democracy.

“All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of 
rebuilding our democratic institutions,” says Obama.

“Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But it’s really just a 
piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power – 
with our participation, and the choices we make.”
 
As Senate hearings continue into Russia’s hacking of the DNC emails during the 
election campaign - and Trump applauds leader Vladimir Putin - Obama 
specifically calls Russia a “rival”.

So let’s be vigilant, but not afraid ISIL will try to kill innocent people. 
But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our 
principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence 
around the world – unless we give up what we stand for, and turn ourselves into 
just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.
 
“I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans,” says Obama, to thunderous 
applause and cheers.
 
“No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an 
attack on our homeland these past eight years,” says Obama, although he notes 
the issue of home-grown terrorists such as the Boston marathon bombing and San 
Bernandino massacre.

“To all who serve, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your 
Commander-in-Chief,” he says, resulting in a standing ovation.
 
The president talks about climate change and the steps his administration has 
taken in the last eight years: reducing dependence on foreign oil, increasing 
renewable energies, signing the Paris Accord.

He calls on the nation to not ignore science.

“But without bolder action, our children won’t have time to debate the 
existence of climate change; they’ll be busy dealing with its effects: 
environmental disasters, economic disruptions, and waves of climate refugees 
seeking sanctuary,” says Obama.

“Now, we can and should argue about the best approach to the problem. But to 
simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations; it betrays the 
essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our 
founders.”

“Politics is a battle of ideas. That’s how democracy was designed,” says Obama.

“But without some common baseline of facts. Without a willingness to admit new 
information and that your opponent might be making a fair point and that 
science and reason matter, then we’re doing to keep talking past each other. 
And it will make common ground and compromise impossible,” he says.
 
Obama continues to talk about race and the divisions in American, getting huge 
cheers from the thousands in the audience.

He quotes Attitcus Finch from Harper Lee’s classic To Kill a Mockingbird, who 
said “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his 
point of view…until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”

Obama continues, specifically identifying groups that were often topics of 
political discussions during the 2016 election:


For blacks and other minorities, it means tying our own struggles for justice 
to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face – the refugee, the 
immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender American, and also the middle-aged 
white man who from the outside may seem like he’s got all the advantages, but 
who’s seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change.
 
Obama, the country’s first black president and son of a Kenyan immigrant, 
discusses race and immigration.

“After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, 
however well-intended, was never realistic.For race remains a potent and often 
divisive force in our society. I’ve lived long enough to know that race 
relations are better than they were ten, or twenty, or thirty years ago – you 
can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young 
Americans across the political spectrum,” he says.

“But we’re not where we need to be.

“All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed 
as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving 
minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while 
the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to 
invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don’t look like us, we 
diminish the prospects of our own children – because those brown kids will 
represent a larger share of America’s workforce.”

He spoke about hiring practices and discrimination in housing .
 
In a week where the GOP is actively trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act - 
and president-elect Trump calls on it to happen as quickly as possible - Obama 
talks about healthcare. He notes that the uninsured rate is lower and health 
care costs rising tat the slowest rate in 50 years.

“If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the 
improvements we’ve made to our health care system – that covers as many people 
at less cost – I will publicly support it,” he says
