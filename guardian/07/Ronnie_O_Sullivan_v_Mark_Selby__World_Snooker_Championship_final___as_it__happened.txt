So there we are; Mark Selby is the man. 

Night, and thanks all for your company. Any ideas what we're all meant to do 
tomorrow?

Updated at 10.52pm BST

10.25pm BST 

Also: Selby is clearly a boss. 

10.25pm BST 

It's really not easy to quantify the magnitude of Selby's achievement. 
O'Sullivan beat Higgins to 14 in his first final, in 2001, then walloped 
whoever had the misfortune to encounter him at that stage subsequently. Over 
the longer form, the idea anyone could grind him out of the match seems 
ridiculous. And here we are.

Updated at 10.30pm BST

10.23pm BST 

The referee receives a pair of "solid gold cufflinks". What if he thinks 
cufflinks are for ponces?

10.22pm BST 

Unlike John Higgins, Selby doesn't need prompting from Hazel to become 
emotional about a family loss. He then says that, after a hard season, he found 
something just before the championships. Yes he did.

Updated at 10.22pm BST

10.21pm BST 

Selby looks a state, and so he should. I quiver, shudder and celebrate at the 
thought of how he'll progress over the next few hours.

Updated at 10.31pm BST

10.20pm BST 

How many times will Mark Selby say "obviously"? 

10.20pm BST 

Ronnie is tugging at his ears - what would Steve Peters say? Not been a good 
night for him.

10.18pm BST 

Selby 18-14 O'Sullivan

What a performance. This was incredible - Selby somehow hung in there 
yesterday, taking frames when apparently outclassed, and then when he needed to 
turn it up today, he did - 13-4 turned it up. "I went numb", says Ronnie.

Updated at 10.45pm BST

10.17pm BST 

HE'S DONE IT! MARK SELBY IS THE WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPION! 

10.16pm BST 

Perfection! A long pink, from the right middle pocket, into the bottom left 
corner! Now the black...

Updated at 10.45pm BST

10.16pm BST 

In it goes! This is incredible! Down goes the brown, and now a blue with the 
rest into the yellow pocket...

10.15pm BST 

The yellow wobbles in the green jaws, but it's there! And he flicks the blue, 
giving him an angle on the green, from the bottom cushion and into the bottom 
left corner.

10.15pm BST 

And Selby rattles home the red! And the black! Clear the colours, and he's 
world champion!

10.14pm BST 

Selby takes on a nails red to the green pocket, jawses it,twice! - and somehow 
O'Sullivan misses it. Nerves are jangling like a newsagent's door.

10.12pm BST 

But Selby nails a red, and is in prime position to lay a tricky snooker. Or 
does he play the pot - it's a blue - and try and disturb the red. He opts for 
the snooker, but nervously pushes it, and there's a one cushion escape 
available. Ronnie plays it perfectly, just rolling up.

10.10pm BST 

Both reds are now out of commission - the score is 56-26 in O'Sullivan's 
favour, and you'd reckon he needs to pot just one more ball to skank the frame.

10.09pm BST 

But O'Sullivan comes to the table, plays a careless safety, and pockets the 
cue ball. "You can cut the atmosphere with a knife", apparently - and not the 
atmosphere cutter that you'd expect to be used in such circumstances.

10.08pm BST 

Down goes the black, leaving a difficult red - the other is still stuck to the 
green. And Selby misses the pot!

10.07pm BST 

Oh my. Selby has a black, and an angle to develop reds and green...

10.07pm BST 

Selby rolls a red along the top rail and home, but with two reds on the bottom 
cushion, two clustered by the pink, and the black on the green spot, the lead 
looks good. But I say! Selby plays a wonderful blue, jumping the cue ball and 
racing it up and down the table, cannoning the reds by the pink.

10.05pm BST 

But with the frame almost secure, he loses concentration and has to play a 
safety - it's a goodun, forcing Selby to clunk the red on the side cushion. 
It's gone well, but O'Sullivan manufactures a potting angle - which he raps 
against the jaws.

10.03pm BST 

Ok, here we are. A blue, and a cannon. Does he play it? He plays it! It's 
perfect! 49 ahead, 75 remaining.

10.02pm BST 

O'Sullivan cuts a blue into the green pocket, but a cannon again denies him 
position, but he brilliantly cuts another red, then a blue, and gently bends 
round for another red. This is wonderful play and testicles, and now caught up 
with position, a chance to claw back a frame.

10.00pm BST 

He's not - there's a red in the road - so he wallops home a green, dispatches 
the offending red, and somehow rolls out of position for the black. Too much 
check side (says not me, obviously).

9.59pm BST 

Selby leaves a red over the jaws, and though O'Sullivan's path to it is 
blocked, it's no problem for him to roll another into it. But is he on the 
black?

9.58pm BST 

O'Sullivan opens with a crunching red, but again, a bit of rushing and a bit 
of bad contact takes him out of position. Then, his safety leaves Selby a 
difficult chance - he plays it as a shot to nothing, and misses, undercutting a 
red to the bottom left corner.

9.54pm BST 

Frame 33 Here we go. 

9.53pm BST 

Selby 17-14 O'Sullivan

Selby misses the chance for backIIback tons, lamping a red into the jaws and 
off the table, but he'll not be donating a faecal matter.

9.51pm BST 

Meanwhile, Selby is trotting around - two more balls, and Selby is three up 
with four to play. And unlike some, rather than be squashed by the might of his 
impending fulfilment, he is buzzing with buzz.

9.49pm BST 

"I've written a new verse for the 80s classic Snooker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker> Loopy. It helps if you know the 
tune. Or maybe if you don't."

Don't know whether to be insulted at the suggestion of ignorance, or flattered 
by my Dorian Gray by-line photo.
"Now Mark Selby, it's plain to see
Is a proper snooker star
He's got the lot, nothing he can't pot
And he's going to go far.
Red and black, a big comeback
As he seeks the world title
He can win, without any flair
Cos I'm a brilliant matchplayer."

9.47pm BST 

Ronnie is feeling this, knowing that one false move and he's almost done. He 
misses a tricky red, and a nervous Selby approaches the table, almost botching 
a red but recovering well.

9.46pm BST 

" feel you have Selby all wrong", chides Sean Burke. "He looks half asleep, 
but you can see the smoulder of sudden violence in him, perfected by Al Pacino 
in The Godfather."

9.44pm BST 

Frame 31 Selby misses with a thump and O'Sullivan punishes him, a bazzing pot 
into the bottom right followed by blue, red, green and a split pack. It's not 
gone as well as it might - he's on nothing.

9.41pm BST 

Tonight, there are actual people watching When James Corden Met Gary Barlow. 
This country.

Updated at 9.41pm BST

9.40pm BST 

Selby 16-14 O'Sullivan

A break of 127, and Selby must be swimming, shaking and tripping. His life is 
two frames away.

9.39pm BST 

And there's the ton. Meanwhile, Greig Aitken is letting nothing lie. "If Cliff 
Thorburn was in his stultifying pomp now, would he still be known as 'The 
Grinder', or as 'The Matchplayer'?"

And would his mustache be ironical? 

9.37pm BST 

Email with Paul Tucker: "Selby had the bloodless complexion and sunken eyes of 
somebody feeling the nausea from quite early on in that frame. The stomach must 
need some respite from the cold shock of missing relatively straightforward 
opportunities. Neither O'Sullivan or Selby have managed it this evening. I think
I'mbeginning to feel the nausea!"


It's Selby's default position - perhaps he suffers a rare kind of motion 
sickness, brought on by motion.

9.36pm BST 

Selby is feeling this, the run now 74 - incredibly, he's taken 15 frames off 
O'Sullivan, and not made a century. This should be it, but.

9.34pm BST 

"It's a broad canvas, I know", says James Crane, "but the obsession with 
camera shots of family members/ gurning supporters is surely one of the very 
worst things about modern sports coverage, just show us the bloody game!"


Ronnie has a son, Littleronnie - did you know? 

9.32pm BST 

Selby is in here - being translucent has its advantages, as it's impossible to 
tell when he looks nervous. His run is 32 so far.

9.30pm BST 

30th frame O'Sullivan hits the white too thick, lands it in the yellow pocket, 
and Selby downs a testing red, bringing him back nicely for the green.

9.28pm BST 

Selby 15-14 O'Sullivan

Another shift in momentum - that yellow was remarkable, and Selby, to 
break,will be beginning to feel the nausea.

9.27pm BST 

Down goes the blue, the pink is cut home, and that's that. What a bizarre, 
wonderful, tingler of a frame that was.

9.26pm BST 

But Selby plays a poor safety, and Ronnie cuts home a red - then flicks the 
blue, slowing down the white and facilitating a green. Off the next red, he 
cannons the broon, and doesn't get a great angle, but pots the red anyway, then 
a further colour - I missed which. The yellow is along the right rail, and he 
rams it home to the bottom right - that is great.

9.23pm BST 

My computer crashed, so missed some small activity - it's 47-23 to Selby, and 
then O'Sullivan crashes home a red. The blue follows, but he misses a deeply 
taxing red along the top rail - one he had to play hard - but doesn't leave 
anything. This is another fascinating frame.

9.18pm BST 

On 15, Ronnie tries too hard to get on the next red potting a yellow, gets a 
minor kick, and given the reduced margin for error, jawses it. It might be a 
frame loser.

Updated at 9.19pm BST

9.17pm BST 

Oh, what's this? Selby, on a buzz, plays a pot to the bottom left harder than 
necessary, and the extra distance to it leads to a miss. The lead is 29, but 
it's worth more given that the majority of reds are up in baulk. He pots 
immediately, and gets to work.

9.13pm BST 

Again, O'Sullivan can't match Selby's safety, leaving the cue ball behind but 
not tight to the black and a red on to the yellow pocket. After due 
consideration, Selby raps it home, sends a pink after it, and wades in.

9.11pm BST 

A safety exchange sends a number of reds up towards baulk, before Selby leaves 
a tight one to the middle. O'Sullivan misses, clumping the near knuckle, and 
Selby contemplates an even tighter one for a good minute and a half, deciding 
against it.

9.08pm BST 

"Yes, let's remove all phrases used as shorthand to communicate shared ideas 
in sporting events," hrrrumphs Ewan Benson.

"Selby steps up and plays snooker.

O'Sullivan plays snooker.

Selby plays more snooker.

Snooker played there by O'Sullivan"

I'd enjoy that, but we're discussing nonsense phrases, rather than the art 
describing events with words.

9.06pm BST 

"High value colours are the new blue, pink and black", says Greig Aitken.

They go with everything. 

And why is the middle of the pocket known as its heart, given its lack of 
centrality as per the body?

9.05pm BST 

"In snooker there is a form of strokeplay – that’s you against the table. 
Matchplay is when you have to battle with your opponent and if it gets into 
that some are better (or worse!) than their strokeplay would suggest."


So says Derek Duffy - is that when you're on your lonesome ownsome? And is 
that the distinction the commentators think they're making? I'm not sure...

9.04pm BST 

Frame 29 O'Sullivan's break again sends a red close to the black - playing 
into Selby's hands.

9.03pm BST 

Selby 15-13 O'Sullivan

Here's the thing: O'Sullivan can, will, win these frames. The question is what 
happens when things become messy - thus far this evening, Selby wins them.

9.00pm BST 

What a shot! O'Sullivan pings home a red to the middle, and with the black 
available, this is a good chance. But he proceeds with blues to begin with, 
before progressing to the maximum, and it seems inconceivable that he won't 
clinch the frame at this visit.

8.58pm BST 

Up to 23, O'Sullivan plays a pink off its spot, his last chance to open the 
pack, and it's far from perfect. But, though the white is surrounded, he's on 
one, and bridging awkwardly, sends it home. Having covered the black, he cuts a 
blue to the centre, misses, almost pots it on its way down, and returns to his 
seat having left a very tricky one to the middle. Selby misses it by a distance.

8.55pm BST 

Frame 28 Selby breaks, and takes the cue ball up behind the yellow. A phone 
goes off, and there is no ripple of applause following refereeing ire - things 
must be tense. And O'Sullivan pastes in a red to the bottom right, and then a 
blue and another red.

8.53pm BST 

"I'm surprised 'table management' hasn't bled across from golf's 'course 
management'", volunteers Gary Naylor. Or "playing golf", and "playing snooker", 
as plebs describe it.


8.49pm BST 

Stephen Fry has ligged his way into the commentary box. Riveting. 

8.37pm BST 

Anyway, that's the midsession. If Selby wins the next, it's hard to see how he 
loses.

8.37pm BST 

Selby 15-12 O'Sullivan

This is three holes in the ground territory. Selby is controlling this now, 
and O'Sullivan does not look like he knows how to stop the flow. If he gets in, 
fine, but otherwise, it's hard to see him reversing the pattern of the safety 
exchanges. Has anyone ever knocked O'Sullivan around after this fashion?

Updated at 10.59pm BST

8.35pm BST 

"He's got Ronnie O'Sullivan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronnie-o-sullivan> playing his way at the 
moment, and that's the art of a very good matchplayer."

Still don't see how that's distinct from "player", mind. 

Here's Paul Bryant:

"Definitely disagree re: the concept of matchplay. It's distinct from playing 
with the absolute priority of winning the frame in question. Snooker 
(especially this tournament) involves such long periods of concentration that 
you cannot be at full intensity at all moments. Think of it being like good 
tennis where you don't necessary play with the particular point in mind - you 
put each point in its context and raise your game for the more important ones. 
Or in cricket when you do not always play to make runs - towards the end of the 
session your priority might change to keeping your wicket."

That's good play, no? There is no other. 

8.33pm BST 

"I always thought that 'great matchplay' meant a player who could grind it out 
over long matches, good at defending a lead or clawing back a deficit", says 
Greg Phillips. "My entry in the cliche cannon: 'That's not what he would have 
wanted'."

The phrase is definitely used during shorter contests, too - but matchplay 
still means winning matches, and "play" or "win".

8.30pm BST 

Ronnie misses another red, off the bottom cushion, aiming to cut into the 
opposite corner. He leaves nothing, but badly needs a Selby error, because he's 
losing the safety exchanges and looking frustrated. And,unsurprisingly, he 
makes an error. Selby has a red available - the cue ball's on the side cushion, 
below the object ball - and it's there! This should be a three frame lead...

Updated at 8.59pm BST

8.27pm BST 

Selby is now up to 34, before expired position forces a safety. He leaves 
Ronnie right on the top cushion, and the escape is excellent - but no one, not 
even him, can maintain perfection under this kind of attack.

8.25pm BST 

"Let's start with the 'shot to nothing'", emails Greig Aitken. "Just think of 
every word of that phrase. Slowly. They really mean to say: 'he's taking on a 
pot or baulk imponderable here'. I imagine Gary Neville would be able to get 
away with this if he was doing the snooker, such is his stock (pre-inevitable 
backlash next season) right now.


Also, what is all this talk favoured by the modern day snooker commentariat of 
'great matchplay', or 'it's not high quality snooker on display, but definitely 
fantastic matchplay.' Is there a 'stroke-play' form of snooker?"

Agreed absolutely on that last one - I think they mean "he's keen to win".

8.24pm BST 

Selby's cannon fails to bring anything into play, so, only 24 ahead, he's 
forced into a safety. That oughtn't to trouble him unduly, though - his play in 
that department has been exemplary all day. And, shonuf, Ronnie leaves him a 
red over the corner, the pressure of precision beginning to wear.

8.21pm BST 

 "...forcing Selby into a roll-up". The spirit of The Embassy lives on..." 
says Gary Naylor.


And here's me trying to avoid parlaying that into a Ronnie gag. 

8.20pm BST 

A touching ball gives Selby a chance, he takes it, and Selby is in amongst 
them. O'Sullivan is in some serious shtuck here.

8.19pm BST 

Selby sends a red up the table towards baulk, it returns and knocks in the 
aforementioned corner-coverer. Ronnie then finds himself tight behind the 
green, but escapes well, and they begin tapping at the cluster.

8.17pm BST 

A Selby safety shot flicks the green, the cue ball now close to its spot, and 
leaving Ronnie a long tempter to the bottom right. He misses it, but covers a 
red he carelessly sent over the opposite corner, which means a testing safety 
shot.

8.14pm BST 

Frame 27 Good break from O'Sullivan, ball close behind the green and forcing 
Selby into a roll-up.

8.12pm BST 

Selby 14-12 O'Sullivan

Finally, Selby sticks the pink away, and leads by two.

8.10pm BST 

Ronnie pots the blue, and they spend time chasing the pink - Selby trying to 
leave it over the pocket, Ronnie seeking a snooker.

8.08pm BST 

But he runs out of position, leaving Ronnie 33 behind and just the colours 
remaining. He rolls in a lovely yellow, but catches the green too thick trying 
to get in behind the pink - in baulk, close to the right cushion. Selby then 
misses the green, and Ronnie pots, bringing the blue into play.

8.07pm BST 

O'Sullivan misses a long pot, cannons the pink, and Selby is in, taking red, 
black, red, black. He should be clinching this at this visit, and the stench of 
dreams will be stinging his eyes and billowing his nostrils.

8.04pm BST 

A Selby safety leaves Ronnie behind brown and green, forcing Ronnie into a 
roll-up. He leaves a red straight to the right corner, taken and followed by 
the easy black, and just when this looks like a framewinner, a kick - still 
unexplained by science - means end of break.

8.01pm BST 

A variety of shots of varying quality has clustered the six remaining reds 
along the bottom cushion, five of them middle left, the pocked covered by the 
black. We could be here some time.

7.59pm BST 

What this match really needs is some analysis from Alan Shearer and James 
Redknapp.

7.57pm BST 

Selby pots a good red, but can't control the white, and sticks Ronnie (who has 
a son, Littleronnie) behind the brown. This is going to be another scrappy one.

7.56pm BST 

O'Sullivan, though, is never quite in position during this break - he plays 
some lovely shots, but on 25, his issues catch up with him, and he misses a 
black.

7.54pm BST 

With 15 on the board, Selby hammers in a black, aiming to break the pack, but 
is too heavy with his topspin - and relieved when a loose red bumps the cushion 
to become available into the middle. But the following red leaves a tricky 
brown, which is missed, and the cue ball cannons the pack. Ronnie is left with 
a straightish red to the green pocket which he can play without fear of leaving 
anything. He hits it perfectly, and this is now a chance.

7.50pm BST 

Frame 26 Selby leaves one over the bottom right, but a nasty centimetre or so 
from the cushion, and with the cue ball a long way up the table. Selby knucks 
it home beautifully, cueing dead straight.

Updated at 8.14pm BST

7.48pm BST 

Selby 13-12 O'Sullivan

Off we go again. 

7.47pm BST 

And, eventually, Ronnie leaves a red, sent into the bottom left, and this 
should be the frame. Selby snookers him behind yellow and brown, and he stays 
in his seat.

7.46pm BST 

Selby takes a while over this shot, so we see the ligging Stephen Fry, and 
friend of Ronnie, Damien Hirst. And the drummer from Iron Maiden - "there are a 
lot of dignitaries here", apparently.

7.45pm BST 

"Where's the white ball goingggg?" says William Boud, "has he got an angle", 
says Steve Barron.

My favourite: "the knowledgeable Crucible audience" (who're being told what to 
think via the telly commentary to which they're listening).

Updated at 7.48pm BST

7.42pm BST 

"Seems Ronnie has remembered that he's called The Rocket and not The Nugget. 
That's no joke for The Jester", reckons Gary Naylor.

If I knew how to use Photoshop, I'd be sticking Steve Davis' face on one of 
these.

7.39pm BST 

There are two reds left - one tight on the top cushion, and the other being 
pursued. The word "cushion" is something or a misnomer - can't imagine a 
pregnant lady thanking you if you presented one as a sleeping aid.

7.38pm BST 

I f Mark Selby loses this, it'll be his potting that's to blame, and he misses 
frame ball - a testing, but barely difficult pink to the middle, from around 
the black spot. O'Sullivan is 42 behind with 43 remaining.

7.35pm BST 

Selby, though, is uncowed, and knocks in a brilliant red, played slowly and 
cut "right in the heart" of the bottom left. He then stutters a snooker behind 
the yellow, and pounces when the escape leaves him a chance.

7.34pm BST 

But what's this! A loose positional shot, and Selby is back at the table, 
missing a red to the bottom left, hit dead weight. He's lucky, but - there's 
nothing on, so he'll have to negotiate a cue ball tight against the top 
cushion, rather than another lost frame.

7.32pm BST 

46 points behind, O'Sullivan comes to the table, an immediately downs a 
wonderful red, potted hard to the bottom left from high up in baulk. This is 
looking ominous.

7.30pm BST 

Furthermore, your favourite snooker cliches please. 

7.30pm BST 

Selby just hasn't been able to build breaks in the usual manner, and screwing 
up and down the table, runs out of position.

As such, a question: does the phrase "run out of position" refer to its 
expiration, or an undesired path taken by the ball?

7.28pm BST 

This is terrific from Selby, chasing position around the table before a red 
with the rest opens the pack and brings the pink into play. Excellent - but 
then, in dispatching it into the middle, he cannons the green, prompting a 
further superb red.

7.25pm BST 

And it goes! Selby did very well to ease that in, and he's on the brown, then 
back down the business end - a phrase guaranteed to donate the willies to 
anyone who's attended a birth.

7.24pm BST 

A brief safety exchange, ball back to baulk each time, before O'Sullivan plays 
a roll-up - possibly leaving a plant to the middle.

7.21pm BST 

But, after intimating a thin prod, Selby takes the ball back up into baulk, 
and all's back to normal.

7.20pm BST 

Selby leaves Ronnie behind the black, and two efforts off the side cushion - 
aimed at the top of the cluster of reds - hit the pink. The third effort is 
much better, and this is already sweating hint of re-rack.

Updated at 7.20pm BST

7.18pm BST 

Frame 25 Good break from Ronnie, cue ball tight on the top cushion behind the 
green.

7.17pm BST 

Did you know: Ronnie O'Sullivan has a son, Littleronnie. 

7.17pm BST 

Mark Selby 12-12 Ronnie O'Sullivan

O'Sullivan gets to 100 and misses, but he cued better than at any time this 
afternoon.

7.16pm BST 

The Rocket is flowing - well, he would be, if rockets flowed, which they do 
not. That's 73, frame clinched quicksmart, and that pink just a bad memory,a 
Steven Gerrard slip <>, if you will. 

7.14pm BST 

"The photo you chose make Ronnie look like an undead Groucho Marx", reckons 
Elliot Wilson.

Selby, on the other hand, makes a good case for the above table lighting to be 
ultraviolet.

7.12pm BST 

Frame 24 Selby breaks and O'Sullivan, spikes combed down, rattles in an 
opening red, quickly racing to 20 - before he's forced to open the pack. And 
it's worked beautifully, black and pink both available. He chooses the former, 
and this is now a chance.

The BBC are really waving their appendages around here. Hushed voices, moody 
tones, waving cues. And it's not even annoying.

PLAY THE MUSIC

6.54pm BST 

δρᾶμα. Apparently, some people refer to it as drama, but we're purists here, 
and so we should be, for we are about to experience the highest iteration of 
the most intense kind. Few sporting examinations compare to the lonely and 
constant pressure of professional snooker, let alone World Championship final 
at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield snooker. The capacity for error, to 
succumb to nerves, to look silly, to crumble and burn, is greater than in any 
other context; consider the minute margins, stupefying silence and indefinite 
duration.

Balls and baize, yes, but also human beings, human souls, and an easy way to 
determine which are worth your time. This is going to be special.

5.38pm BST 

Right, I'll be back at seven. If you're not panting with excitement, you have 
no part of this world and no place in the world to come.

Updated at 5.40pm BST

5.31pm BST 

"Compelling, yes, but surely the lowest quality session there's been in a 
World final for decades? Barry Hearn's got a job to do if this is the best 
there's ever been versus the world number one."


Agreed, some miserable stuff there - but disagree that the standard must 
necessarily be high. Generally it is, and in the final, you want drama most of 
all. This is some.

Mark Selby 12-11 Ronnie O'Sullivan

My days. 

5.28pm BST 

And it's there! O'Sullivan spanks home the brown, then slides the blue into 
the green pocket - and what's this! With only pink required, he wallops it to 
the middle to get position on the black, it do-si-does the top of the jaw, and 
Selby clear up! What on earth was that! I don't know! Do you? No! Oh! Neither 
do I!

5.26pm BST 

But the brown is unpottable, so Selby attempts a snooker, white behind black. 
It's not quite there, and Ronnie responds by blocking brown with pink, forcing 
an error from Selby - punished with neither snooker nor pot.

5.24pm BST 

Oh this is nice from Selby, feathering green into brown close to the bottom 
cushion, and taking the cue ball all the way to the top. And O'Sullivan, keen 
for the brown to remain out of commission, tickles the green and leaves a cut 
into the middle, which Selby takes.

Updated at 5.33pm BST

5.22pm BST 

Selby rattles the yellow into the bottom left, and there's a long green 
awaiting him. He plays it hard, but wavers in the delivery, and misses - Ronnie 
can now cut it into the left middle, past the pink. But in trying to avoid the 
kiss on the black that would make the brown tricky, he too misses.

5.20pm BST 

Another poor safety from Selby - he's left the yellow on, then covered it with 
the green. O'Sullivan then clips the blue with the cue ball, leaves the yellow 
to the same pocket, Selby misses - and again spawns a snooker. And again, 
Ronnie deals with it. What a frame this is. What a championship this has been. 
What are we all going to do tomorrow.

5.18pm BST 

There exist human beings who don't like snooker. Just contemplate that for a 
moment.

5.17pm BST 

This will be the final frame of the afternoon. 

5.16pm BST 

O'Sullivan hits it this time, but leaves a tempter to the green pocket - which 
Selby eschews. He plays another poor safety, and again is lucky, covering 
yellow with blue - twice,noch 
<http://yiddishwordoftheweek.tumblr.com/post/239993776/noch>!

5.14pm BST 

Selby is lucky a second time, fluking a snooker - the cue ball's on the bottom 
cushion, the yellow just above its spot, and the pink in between. Ronnie 
misses, and is put back. We're now enjoying the longest frame of the match.

5.13pm BST 

"Come on, the alternative universe name for snooker would obviously be 
'Potty-Stick'", emails Chris Buchanan.


5.11pm BST 

Ronnie might have taken on the yellow, chose not to, and found himself in a 
disadvantageous position when Selby hit it next go. The subsequent safety left 
the pot on - but there's plenty difference between cue and object ball, and 
it's not that close.

5.09pm BST 

Ronnie clear up the reds, but position expires, and so he drops in behind the 
black. Selby can't hit the yellow, so foul and amiss is called, and then again 
- this time he gets much closer. Ronnie puts him back again, and he misses 
again...

5.07pm BST 

Here's Rob Marriott with a lesson for  us all  me. "As I understand it, the 
word snooker predates the sport - it was 19th century officer slang for an 
incompetent novice. Snooker billiards was a kind of billiards in which you 
tried to make your opponent look like a snooker, by forcing him into a mistake.
So, if what I've been told was true, forcing your opponent into a snooker has 
always been what the game's about, and what differentiates it from other types 
of billiards."


You calling me a snooker?

5.06pm BST 

Selby mixes the two. playing a hit-and-hope pot, missing, leaving, and this 
frame may now be over. If Ronnie takes blacks, he won't need the pink that's up 
near the yellow spot - but there's also a stray red from earlier, up near the 
green pocket.

5.04pm BST 

But on his way down the table, Ronnie pots a blue too thin, failing to land on 
a red. He's vex-up, but responds with a good safety. Selby has a problem, here 
- there's no route back to baulk, and nothing into which he can roll. It's 
looking like an iffy pot, or a two cushion escape.

Updated at 5.11pm BST

5.02pm BST 

Selby misses! The ball rattles the jaw, ends up over the green pocket, ends up 
in the green pocket, and Ronnie is in.

5.00pm BST 

With the pink blocking the safest red, on the left cushion, Selby plays off 
that cushion and drops the white into the bottom left. But there's nothing on, 
so he plays a poor safety instead, leaving a red over the aforementioned corner.

Updated at 5.01pm BST

4.58pm BST 

A safety exchange - dictated by O'Sullivan. This is now a huge frame for Selby 
- lose it, when it should've been his, and momentum passes. Win it, and the 
previous one was just a blip.

4.57pm BST 

"Re: Dave's moaning. The clue to the nature of the game is in its very name" 
reckons Ewan Benson.

I wonder - isn't it more likely that "a snooker" took it's name from the game, 
and were the game called floccinaucinihilipilification, the circumstance would 
be too?

4.55pm BST 

And Selby then bashes a brown into the yellow pocket, too hard to get himself 
on a red - end of break. But Ronnie misjudges his safety, and the white ends up 
where the yellow didn't. Sport can be so compelling when played sketchily.

4.52pm BST 

The players have potted 337 balls each, "an amazing stat". Selby then 
dispatches another, and we are all bereft.

Updated at 4.52pm BST

4.51pm BST 

A loose O'Sullivan safety shot gives Selby a shot at a red and he sinks it - a 
yellow and second red brings him down the business end. But the constellation 
of reds around the black makes this a tricky chance, forcing him to screw back 
up for a second yellow.

4.49pm BST 

O'Sullivan's safety has picked up, and he forces an error from Selby - this 
gives him the chance of a pot, a cut into the bottom right. Wary of leaving a 
chance, he plays it harder than necessary, wobbling the ball in the jaws, but 
getting the white safe.

4.47pm BST 

Really, Mark Selby should be playing in this.

4.46pm BST 

Oh! Selby plays a cannon off the blue, aiming to scatter the reds, and instead 
catches the black - which slides into the bottom right pocket. There's nothing 
on, but Ronnie plays a handy snooker, and after Selby rolls into the pack, a 
left-hander take takes the cue ball back into baulk, and wrests control of the 
exchange.

4.44pm BST 

O'Sullivan's safety has not be up to much today, and he leaves a red that 
Selby snaffles, followed by a green and red, almost screwing back the cue ball 
into the left middle. But it stays out, and blue-red-black follow - though with 
the black on the pink spot, there's plenty to do before this is a frame winning 
chance.

4.41pm BST 

Ronnie taps the table in appreciation, after Selby plays a handy safety. "Nice 
to see, even in the heat of battle", intones John Virgo as though he's said it 
seventy-three billion times before.

4.40pm BST 

Frame 23. O'Sullivan breaks, and takes the cue ball to behind the green - 
leaving a tempter just below the blue, to the bottom left pocket. Selby plays 
it as a shot to nothing, the red catches the near knuckle, and there follows a 
safety exchange.

4.37pm BST 

Ronnie O'Sullivan 11-11 Mark Selby

Ronnie clears up to pink, puts the cue on the table, and jogs off for a lag. 
I'm not surprised. That's his first frame of the day, and stops a run of six in 
a row for Selby.11-11.

4.36pm BST 

Selby takes a risky green, misses, and leaves it for Ronnie - a difficult one, 
to the top left, with both cue and object ball near enough the bottom right. 
And it's there!

4.34pm BST 

This is incredible! Shame on anyone enjoying the sunshine.

Updated at 4.34pm BST

4.33pm BST 

But Selby can't quite get the angle he's after, so plays a poor safety - 
saving both the ignominy of attempting any immediate pots.

4.32pm BST 

Ronnie slams home the black, but it's straight, so no angle for the yellow - 
which he subsequently undercuts, and a kiss off the green leaves it on. Selby 
tries to force matters, as the green is level with the pink spot, but misses. 
And then Ronnie misses too, cutting a long pot too thick to the green pocked. 
What a crucial frame this has become. And Selby rattles the back of the jaw! 
And Ronnie misses a sitter, down the right cushion! Looking like 12-10 Selby 
now! And Selby only just pots it! And misses the green! And so does Ronnie!

Updated at 4.35pm BST

4.28pm BST 

More exchanges - this is looking like the decisive ball of the frame. With the 
red now up in baulk, Selby tries a half-arsed cut as a shot to nothing, leaving 
it touching the yellow, but cuttable. And it's there!

4.27pm BST 

Selby plays the safety, taking the cue ball to behind the brown, and leaving 
the red close to the right cushion. Ronnie's response isn't great, but serves a 
purpose.

4.25pm BST 

And it's jawed, off the near knuckle! Not quite over the pocket, but it might 
just cut...

4.25pm BST 

O'Sullivan eases a black into the bottom right corner, and with three reds 
remaining, needs, most likely to green. And here comes the key shot - a black, 
stunned to get behind the red on the left rail.

4.23pm BST 

Selby misses a red to the corner and O'Sullivan - no doubt I'll slip into 
Ronnie soon enough - fairly leaps out of his seat. This is a chance, because 
there are are no seriously difficult balls preventing a clear-up.

4.21pm BST 

"Dave Stainton is absolutely right." says Hugh Brechin. "Mark Selby should 
open the reds up, take Ronnie on and lose in watchable fashion like a 
gentleman. (Also, I've now got the bits about jesters from Don McLean's 
American Pie stuck in my head, so cheers for that, Mark.)"


 When the jester sang for the king and queen, in a coat he borrowed from James 
Dean, and a voice that came from you and meeeeee.

In pre-internet days, when you had to wait for your walkman batteries to run 
down to deduce the lyrics to a song, that was one the captures chunks of my

Selby called Willie Thorne last night, delighted to have won the final two 
frames last night, and he's playing like a man reprieved. Pink and black are 
"out of commission", but, like in Quadrophenia, blues are are doing the trick.

Frame 22 Selby breaks, and takes the cue ball back to baulk, not quite tight 
on the cushion, but nicely behind the yellow. With nothing on, O'Sullivan plays 
off two cushions into the pack - but he's left one to the corner! Selby forces 
it home, and then cuts a pink to get in amongst it.

4.14pm BST 

And here they come! Boys/baize interface reached. Slouch in and eyes down - 
this is going to be a thriller.

4.13pm BST 

"The first few shots of every frame are imperative for Ronnie." So says 
Stephen Hendry, but with no translation forthcoming.

4.11pm BST 

Ronnie O'Sullivan is spending the entirety of the interval talking to Brendan 
Rodgers' disciple, Steve Peters. Ah, no - he's now in the practice room, 
knocking in the balls from which he's been separated for most of the last 
mini-session.

4.04pm BST 

It's bank holiday. It's sunny. The streets and parks are full of humans, 
humans enjoying themselves. Revolting.

But help is at hand. There is no excuse - you have no option - but to draw 
your curtains, lower the lights, don tracksuit or pants, eat biscuits, and 
gorge on glorious, delightful, magical, wonderful, compelling, absorbing world 
championship snooker final.

Updated at 4.08pm BST

3.59pm BST 

Anyway, I'm handing over to Daniel Harris, who looks like he could be here for 
the long run for the rest of this match. Thanks for your emails, including this 
one from Dave Stainton. "I take it Mark Selby's nickname is meant to be 
ironic?" he emails. "His way of grinding Ronnie down has me drifting in and out 
of consciousness. If I was King and he was my jester he'd be off to the 
gibbet." Thoughts? Cheers, James.

Ronnie O'Sullivan 10-11 Mark Selby (29-89)

And off to the mid-session interval we go. All four frames this afternoon to 
Selby, and six in a row to Selby. O'Sullivan looks cold at the table, and in 
deep trouble.

Updated at 3.55pm BST

3.50pm BST 

There are 35 points left on the table, with Selby 34 ahead, but he's astutely 
tucked the black tight(ish)ly to the bottom cushion.

this session. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images 
3.48pm BST 

But it's not the frame ball, as a tricky red to the right middle which would 
have left O'Sullivan needing snookers is missed. It's 62-28 to Selby. 
O'Sullivan takes a gamble with an aggressive red to the top left, but it's wild 
and lucky to run to safety. Selby drops a delicious snooker by way of response 
but watches his opponent get straight up and escape brilliantly. It still looks 
like six in a row for Selby, though.

3.44pm BST 

O'Sullivan's escape is majestic and he's soon into a safety exchange that 
could decide this frame. But after opening up the last reds, he's clumsy again 
and leaves a red to the top left which Selby snaffles up. That could be frame 
ball.

3.41pm BST 

More trouble for O'Sullivan here, the right face on him in his seat as another 
loose shot puts Selby back on the table – keeping the Rocket off the baize has 
been key in this session so far. Before long, Selby has compiled 28 to lead 
51-24, with three reds left. He over-runs a pink and opts for the snooker.

Updated at 3.43pm BST

3.34pm BST 

Selby is quickly back in with another chance, O'Sullivan clumsy with his 
safety. But after leaving himself an awkward shot with the rest, Selby misses 
again. The Crucible crowd exhale, a number of coughs stifled until miss on this 
occasion. 24-15 in the frame to O'Sullivan.

3.32pm BST 

"I used to wonder why snooker didn't go for a frames and sets format (as they 
do in the darts for example), but I don't any more," writes Gary Naylor. "So 
much about Crucible snooker is about momentum, about not giving in to the voice 
that tells you that it's OK to ease up on the concentration when you're five 
frames ahead, about switching on and off at exactly the right moments. The long 
crawl to 18 at the end of 17 days' play is one of sport's cruellest delights." 
A cruel delight and then some. Selby is expectedly curtailed, trailing 20-9 in 
the frame when he misses a relatively simple red to the bottom right. He 
recoils immediately, eyeing up a member of the Crucible crowd who coughed just 
before the shot. You've got to love sport when ailments of the audience can 
potentially cause bother.

3.29pm BST 

Early bother for Selby. Two fouls in succession end with him going in-off with 
the white. O'Sullivan has half a chance and he gets to work with a couple of 
marvellous pots. But the table's not in his favour, and after struggling to 
force an angle off the blue, he's forced into safety. It's not good enough, 
mind, much as it hasn't through this third session, and Selby is back on a 
break. Though it'll be hard to build from here.

3.23pm BST 

Frame 21: Off we go again and with the pack of reds tightly grouped and the 
red almost buried in among it, there's a whiff of an imminent re-rack. A safety 
to the baulk ends the threat and we're into a longer-range safety exchange.

Ronnie O'Sullivan 10-10 Mark Selby (7-84)

Five frames in a row for Selby! A break of 74 is curtailed by a missed yellow 
to the left middle, but this is a splendid recovery.

Updated at 3.35pm BST

3.16pm BST 

Brilliance from Selby, who looks fresher than he understandably did yesterday 
off the back of that semi with Robertson. He's disrupted O'Sullivan's rhythm, 
and looks in control. Taking the break to 55, he leaves O'Sullivan needing 
snookers.

3.13pm BST 

Selby is again on the front foot, his safety game superior at present and 
O'Sullivan growing increasingly frustrated. After opening the pack of reds, 
he's soon on to a 22-7 frame advantage. It's no easy clearance, but this is 
looking like a strong frame-winning opportunity. Just then, the BBC flash up a 
brilliant stat: both players are on 6,339 points for the match.

3.06pm BST 

Frame 20: Selby has the first sniff here and O'Sullivan is still yet to get 
any kind of clear run at the table. After reaching nine the break drys up, 
before tempting O'Sullivan into an aggressive safety – indicative of his 
frustration at the game not being open enough at present. O'Sullivan escapes, 
but things look like they're soon about to open up.

Excellent break-building from Selby and he's soon closing in on a 
frame-winning advantage. As his break reaches 52, O'Sullivan looks set to need 
snookers. This looks like a fourth frame on the spin for Selby. But … but … he 
misses. O'Sullivan can tie with three reds and blacks, and a subsequent 
clearance.

2.49pm BST 

It causes O'Sullivan some bother, all right. He fails to escape on two 
occasions, but from the latter he leaves Selby an opening – and he jumps on it. 
In among the balls, Selby has a real chance to pull back within a single frame. 
Selby is 34-22 up and counting.

2.45pm BST 

Fourteen minutes in to this frame and it's still filed under 'tactical'. But 
then Selby spots a plant to nothing and tidily pulls it off. There's not much 
on, mind, and he drops a snooker on O'Sullivan with the white in behind the 
green, which is sat high up on the right cushion.

2.40pm BST 

 After a safety exchange, O'Sullivan eventually leaves Selby an opening. He 
fails to capitalise on to colour, before soon being left another chance; a long 
red with the rest into the top-left corner gets him away, before settling for 
safety after reaching 11. It's 22-12 to O'Sullivan.

2.33pm BST 

Effort No5 ends up kissing the pink, giving O'Sullivan 22 in total fouls, 
before No6 finally ends the pain. And then we're back into a safety game, Selby 
still being asked the questions, mind.

Frame 19: Momentum with Selby, then. But for how long? O'Sullivan breaks 
left-handed and brings the white on a string around the table and right in 
tight behind the green. Selby's escape goes off three cushions but is foiled by 
the left-middle jaws … and then again with his next attempt. The third effort 
is equally unsuccessful, before No4 ends in the left middle pocket.

Ronnie O'Sullivan 10-8 Mark Selby (35-81)

O'Sullivan drills in a spectacular green, but then leaves the brown open after 
his next long-range effort. Selby then clears, ending with a ridiculous double, 
playing the white off the left cushion and on to the black, knocking it 
politely into the bottom right pocket. Three in a row for Selby. Oh. Any emails?

2.26pm BST 

But after a careful check of the scoreboard and even more careful break 
management, Selby builds a break of 55 and leads by 27 with 25 on the table. A 
safety off the green means O'Sullivan will be back, needing just a snooker, but 
he's obviously the heavy favourite to reduce his arrears to 10-8.

2.22pm BST 

Selby's break reaches 36 as he clears both top corner pockets, but then knocks 
the green to safety off a red; he may still need that if the break goes that 
far.

2.19pm BST 

With only three reds, pink and black below the blue, this frame is shaping up 
to be a mess. But then O'Sullivan plays down table and clumsily watches his top 
spin take the cueball in off and into the bottom left corner pocket. Selby 
quickly sets about tidying up the table.

2.15pm BST 

… but O'Sullivan's stun shot fails to break the pack cleanly. He's left with a 
double to nothing, which misses. No real danger, although Selby is almost right 
back in it with his next shot, sending the yellow precariously over the top 
left pocket. If that's not dangerous enough, his next defensive shot sends the 
green into the top-right jaws. Soon there are five reds hanging around baulk 
and this is set for a scrappy opening epic.

2.10pm BST 

Frame 18 of 35 – O'Sullivan leads 10-7: Selby breaks but immediately it's 
O'Sullivan in the ascendancy. A red gets him started before a wild yellow to 
the middle, cueballscrambling like a memory from your childhood 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEOLz_z6MQI>. The reds are tightly packed as 
O'Sullivan reaches 25, with an angle off the black …

2.06pm BST 

"The Crucible awaits and, so to, does MC Rob Walker." Ten words to strike fear 
into the hearts of an sane individual. The BBC's coverage is up and running 
and, as the grating MC persona trills, the boys are being called to the baize. 
Frame 18 will begin shortly.

2.04pm BST 

But. But … as O'Sullivan himself notes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/03/neil-robertson-mark-selby-world-snooker-championship>
, "Mark's the toughest competitor on tour", and anyone who was fortunate enough 
to catch Selby's staggeringly good semi-final with Neil Robertson will probably 
be able to vouch for that. It's seven years sincehis early-morning defeat to 
John Higgins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/08/snooker.worldsnookerchampionship2007>
, a final in which he rallied and rallied, and then rallied some more, since 
when he's won the UK Championship and three Masters titles, as well asthe 
honour of a Small Talk interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/apr/18/sportinterviews.worldsnookerchampionship>
 (I know). And it's not as if he hasn't beaten O'Sullivan before, winning seven 
of their previous 21 meetingsaccording to these head-to-head stats

Of the five world finals which have involved O'Sullivan, he has won the lot, 
never having been taken deeper than 32 frames. His record reads: 18-14 v John 
Higgins (2001), 18-8 v Graeme Dott (2004), 18-8 v Ali Carter (2008), 18-11 v 
Carter (2012) and 18-12 v Barry Hawkins (2013); a total of 100-60 if you 
include the current final. The bookies' price of 5-1 on Selby in this two-horse 
race tells its own tale.

Preamble

Good afternoon, and welcome to our frame-by-frame coverage of the 2014 World 
Snooker Championship final, with Ronnie O'Sullivan leading Mark Selby 10-7 
after an intriguing first two sessions at the Crucible yesterday. The, ahem,
Jester from Leicester 
<http://static.wixstatic.com/media/702a5b_4a47c0d8450abb1a6b0ce85015f8a4f1.jpg_srz_302_404_85_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz>
 (it's no Sheriff of Pottingham) did pretty well to get out oflast night's 
second session 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/05/ronnie-osullivan-mark-selby-world-snooker-championship-final>
 with a three-frame deficit and keep himself well in this match, but O'Sullivan 
is looking pretty close to his brilliant best. You get the sense it will take 
something spectacular from Selby if he's to avoid a second final defeat in his 
second world final, but of the few players in world snooker capable of pulling 
it off, he could just be one to do it. Anyway, it's the first to 18 andthe 
third session begins at around 2pm BST. In the meantime, here's some Drag Racer 
from the Doug Wood Group <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0biAKtk2us> to get 
you in the mood.
