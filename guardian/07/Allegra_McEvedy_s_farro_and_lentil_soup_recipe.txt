I first encountered this soup in the medieval walled city of Lucca in Tuscany. 
It was a total revelation; the creamiest lentil soup I'd ever tasted. Farro is 
an ancient grain from the same family as spelt.
Serves 6

90g smoked back bacon
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving
250g red onions, diced small
2 sticks of celery, preferably with leaves
2 to 3 sprigs of rosemary, leaves picked and chopped
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
A pinch of dried chilli flakes
175g small brown lentils, or puy lentils (not bigger brown ones)
100g farro or pearl barley
1 litre chicken stock
Salt and pepper

Cut the rind off the bacon and keep it. Chop the rashers into 1cm dice.

Heat the oil in a wide saucepan, then add the onions, bacon and rind. Put the 
lid on and cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile cut the 
celery sticks lengthways into 1cm pieces and rough-chop the celery leaves. Stir 
all the celery into the pan, along with the rosemary, garlic, chilli and a 
couple of pinches of salt.

Give the lentils a quick rinse, then add them to the pan along with the farro. 
After a couple of minutes, pour on the chicken stock, stir and put the lid 
on askew.

Keeping the heat on medium, bring up to a steady simmer. Cook for 20–30 
minutes until al dente. Fish out the bacon rind and throw it away before 
ladling half the soup into the blender. Whiz for a minute, then tip it back 
into the pan.

Season, then give it a 5-minute rest, with the lid on. Drizzle with extra 
virgin olive oil before serving.

folk will love this". To clarify: farro is a form of wheat and is high in 
gluten. It should therefore not be eaten by people with coeliac disease.
