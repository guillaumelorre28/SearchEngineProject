last month he planned to play four events before the end of the year, starting 
with the Tiger Woods Invitational on the Monterey Peninsula, California, on 10 
October.

The 40-year-old will then head north to Napa for the Safeway Open from 13-16 
October and, if all goes to plan, Woods will play on the European Tour in the 
Turkish Airlines Open in November and the Hero World Challenge, which is hosted 
by his own foundation, in the Bahamas.

Woods has had three back operations in the space of 19 months and has not won 
on the PGA Tour since the Bridgestone Invitational in 2013.

 to Davis Love as the United States won the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine last week 
and will perform the same role for Steve Stricker at the 2017 Presidents Cup, 
if he fails to make the team.

His participation in the Safeway Open was announced in a statement from the 
PGA Tour, several hours ahead of the deadline for entries.
