Malek, currently starring in the second season of the Amazon Prime series 
about a renegade computer whizz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mr-robot>, will play the role 
originated by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman’s character, Louis Dega, is a veteran 
criminal who teams up with Henri Charrière (McQueen) to escape theinfamous 
Devil’s Island <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Island> jail in French 
Guiana. Charrière will be played by Charlie Hunnam in the remake.

The 1973 film was based on the memoirs of Charrière, who was nicknamed 
“Papillon” (French for “butterfly”) because of the tattoo on his chest. 
Convicted of the murder of a pimp in 1931 (a crime he denied committing), he 
was sent to Devil’s Island, and escaped in 1941 by using a bag of coconuts as a 
raft.

Charrière’s book <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/papillon.html>, also called 
Papillon, was a bestseller in 1970. It was said by the author to be “75% true”, 
although it is thought today that many of the stories in the book were supplied 
by other inmates, rather than Charrière himself.

The 1973 film was at $12m an expensive prospect that doubled its money at the 
box office. Directed by Franklin J Schaffner, it was co-scripted by the 
once-blacklisted screenwriterDalton Trumbo
