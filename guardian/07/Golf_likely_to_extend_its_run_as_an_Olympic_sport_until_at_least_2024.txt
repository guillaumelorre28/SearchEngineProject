Confirmation that the sport will remain part of the Games until 2024 at least 
should come early in the new year.

Several leading players refused to play in Rio for a variety of reasons

 and it was feared golf may survive, as had been guaranteed, only for 2016 and 
2020.

A source at the International Olympic Committee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/international-olympic-committee> said it 
would be “very surprising” if golf is not afforded an extended run. The IOC 
meets early next year for a standard review and to announce what sports will 
feature in the 2024 Games .

Olympic golf was boosted by a thrilling gold-medal chase between Justin Rose

The IGF is especially keen to highlight golf’s growth in the south-east Asia, 
with the 2020 Games to take place in Tokyo.

After Rose and Inbee Park won gold in Rio, the IGF’s Peter Dawson said. 
“Golf’s success has been endorsed by strong viewing figures throughout the 
world and genuine interest from enthusiastic crowds in Rio. To see medallists 
crowned from six different nations is hugely gratifying.

“It is very important that we continue to be a supportive, contributing member 
of the Olympic family. We believe the values of our sport complement those of 
the Olympic movement and I am both hopeful and confident that we will continue 
to play our part beyond 2020.”
