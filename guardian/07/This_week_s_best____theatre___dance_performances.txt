Five of the best… theatre shows this week
1 Matilda The Musical

It takes years to develop a good musical but the RSC got it spot on with Tim 
Minchin and Dennis Kelly’s glorious version of the Roald Dahl story. Add to 
that a seriously smart production by Matthew Warchus that puts the children 
centre stage in their fight against the appalling head teacher Miss Trunchbull, 
and you have an evening of real musical vim and vigour.
Cambridge Theatre, WC2, to 15 Oct <http://uk.matildathemusical.com/>

2 World Without Us

This week is your last chance to see Ontroerend Goed’s haunting monologue, an 
elegy for a dying Earth that refuses to let the audience off the hook, as it 
takes us by the metaphorical hand and leads us through a scenario where every 
human being has vanished from the face of the planet. As the Earth reverts over 
centuries to a natural state, it becomes clear we will not be missed. It’s a 
timely reminder that we are now running out of last chances.
Theatre Royal: The Drum, Plymouth, to 26 Nov

3 One Night In Miami…

Activist Malcolm X, singer Sam Cooke and American football star Jim Brown are 
in a hotel room in 1964 with new world champion boxer Cassius Clay (soon to be 
Muhammad Ali) in Kemp Powers’s play. This kind of speculative drama about what 
might have happened between celebrities behind closed doors is now a dramatic 
staple, but Powers gives it new life by honing in on a moment when the US civil 
rights movement was gathering momentum.
Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 3 Dec

4 Harry Potter And The Cursed Child Parts I & II

With 60,000 new tickets going on sale this Tuesday, it’s worth remembering 
that JK Rowling’s continuation of the Harry Potter story, starting 19 years 
after the final novel left off, is the real deal: a pleasure for fully paid-up 
Potterheads and theatre enthusiasts alike. Playwright Jack Thorne and director 
John Tiffany honour the original but also create a genuinely magical evening 
full of wonder and unexpected depths.
Palace Theatre, WC2, to Feb 2018 <https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/>

5 King Lear

It’s been a terrific couple of years for gender parity on stage, with Maxine 
Peake playing Hamlet, Harriet Walter currently tackling Prospero and Glenda 
Jackson scaling the heights of King Lear. After 25 years away from the stage, 
some wondered whether Jackson might have lost the muscle that acting requires 
but she is quite extraordinary in Deborah Warner’s starry, modern-dress 
production. There is fine support, too, from Celia Imrie and Jane Horrocks as 
her she-wolf daughters.
Old Vic, SE1, to 3 Dec <http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2016/king-lear/>
