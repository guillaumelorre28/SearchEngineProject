As the Obama administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration> confirms that 
premiums for some health plans under the Affordable Care Act will increase by 
an average of 25% next year, families like the Marshes are just grateful to 
have health insurance.

Jerry Marsh, 62, is covered by Medicare because of a disability, but his wife, 
Kerri, was uninsured until the Affordable Care Act – Barack Obama’s signature 
healthcare legislation, which has drastically reduced the number of uninsured 
in the US, stopped insurers denying coverage for pre-existing medical 
conditions, and allowed children to remain on their parents’ policies until age 
26, but has faced criticism for the cost of premiums and deductibles – went 
into effect. She is a homeschool teacher for their 11-year-old grandson, who 
has learning difficulties.

Marsh, a health insurance navigator, said Kerri’s current coverage would cost 
$18 more a month next year because of the premium increases. “We can live with 
that, that’s a $20 bill; if people went out having beers or something, you’d 
spend that real quick,” Marsh said.

The family’s experience challenges the narrative pushed by Obamacare opponents 
this week after the Obama administration confirmed on Monday that marketplace 
health insurance premiums would increase, on average, 22% this year.

“It’s over for Obamacare,” said Donald Trump at a rally in Tampa, Florida, on 
Monday.

The Republican presidential nominee has made premium increases a central piece 
of his campaign this week. “It’s killing our businesses. It’s killing our small 
businesses. And it’s killing individuals,”he said on Tuesday in Tallahassee

.

But that conclusion overlooks subsidies and tax credits available to people 
who buy insurance on the Obamacare marketplace.

In Phoenix, for instance, the premium increase is so steep that a 40-year-old 
non-smoker could go from paying $207 to $507 a month for the most common health 
exchange plan,according to the Kaiser Family Foundation 
<http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/?utm_campaign=KFF-2016-Health-Reform&utm_content=41600902&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter>
 (KFF).

But when financial assistance is accounted for, that same 40-year-old’s 
premium rate increase could be 0%.

With subsidies and tax credits, 72% of people who buy insurance on the 
marketplace would be able to find plans with a premium of less than $75 a 
month, according to aDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) report 
<http://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2016/10/24/more-70-percent-consumers-can-find-marketplace-plans-less-75-month.html>
 released this week. And up to 2.5 million people may be eligible for a subsidy 
but don’t know it, according to HHS.

Rebecka Brayton, an insurance navigator for Wyoming Health Council, said her 
clients were not concerned about the premium increase, which is about 9% in her 
state, according to KFF. “So far, I have not had negative feedback on the 
increase; I am very sure that is because it’s so small in our state and the 
offset of the tax credits,” Brayton said in an email.

She said that while the state has some of the most expensive insurance in the 
country, it receives money that helps reduce consumer costs.

For instance, one man who lost his job came to her concerned about the price 
of his Cobra coverage, a health insurance option that lets people who have lost 
their jobs continue to use the same coverage that their employer offered. But 
Brayton ended up finding him a marketplace plan that cost less than half as 
much as the one he had while employed, with a lower deductible and prescription 
drug costs.

But not everyone qualifies for financial assistance that can bring the premium 
rate down. “A concern is that some of the people who are higher income, but are 
not high income, will be hit hardest by this increase,” said Cynthia Cox, 
associate director at KFF.

Shela Bryan, a 63-year-old maintenance supervisor in Georgia, makes just over 
the $47,520 limit to qualify for a subsidy. Bryantold CNN Money 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/15/news/economy/obamacare-premiums/> that the 
cheapest policies she could find amount to more than a quarter of her yearly 
income, or double her mortgage. “I don’t know how they think anyone can afford 
that,” she said.

That is why some people are choosing instead to pay the tax penalty handed 
down to people who choose to be uninsured.

For the first year that people were required to have coverage, 8.1m tax 
returns included penalties for not having coverage in 2014,according to the New 
York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/us/obamacare-affordable-care-act-tax-penalties.html>
. A preliminary report for 2015 said that 5.6m returns included penalties.

At the same time, people like Kerri Marsh who use the marketplaces are getting 
health insurance they would not have without Obamacare.

Nearly half of adults in marketplace plans were uninsured before getting the 
new insurance, according toan April 2016 survey from the Commonwealth Fund 
<http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2016/may/ACA-tracking-survey-access-to-care-and-satisfaction>
. And aNew York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/health/immigrants-the-poor-and-minorities-gain-sharply-under-health-act.html>
 analysis showed that Obamacare brought “historic” increases in coverage for 
people who have been traditionally left behind by the health care system.

“All you’ve seen in the last couple days, is that they [the premiums] are 
going up 30%, 40%, 50%,” Jerry Marsh said. “That type of thinking is what will 
hurt some people.”
