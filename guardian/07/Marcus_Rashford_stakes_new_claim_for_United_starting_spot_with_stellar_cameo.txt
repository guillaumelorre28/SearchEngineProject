‘One lie, repeated many times.” That was José Mourinho’s mantra before his 
Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> team 
had even kicked a ball in the Premier League, when responding to questions 
about the lack of academy players he had trusted over the years. Surely now he 
has a golden opportunity to end such talk – one of the main concerns before he 
was appointed – that his approach to management is at odds with a club where 
youth promotion and success have lived symbiotically for many years?

José Mourinho has revived Manchester United’s winning mentality, says Wayne 
Rooney

Marcus Rashford, the precocious talent who few had heard of this time last 
year, has given him that opportunity. Another game, another fearless display 
from the 18-year-old, this time at Hull City, on an evening where he not only 
scored the winning goal but also provided the kind of zest and attacking 
vivacity that the game, and United’s play, desperately needed.

It was not the first time either. Rashford has continually done so since 
making his surprise debut in the Europa League last season, coming in at short 
notice when Anthony Martial pulled up in the pre‑match warm-up to score twice 
against Midtjylland.

He did so again in the Manchester derby. He did so against West Ham United in 
the FA Cup. He did so on hisEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> debut against Australia and he 
did so in Lens at the European Championship, when Roy Hodgson’s side were 
struggling to break down Wales.

In many ways it is remarkable that United’s fans had to wait 251 minutes of 
the league season before seeing him in action. They were not to be disappointed 
when they did, Rashford producing a cameo performance that increased the 
pressure on a tiring Hull before providing the decisive impact in injury time.

Mourinho calls him “the kid”, a moniker that once befell a certain Spanish 
striker before his move to Liverpool, and Rashford became the first teenager to 
score under the Portuguese coach in the Premier League. The next youngest was 
Arjen Robben during their Chelsea days, who was only a few months shy of his 
21st birthday.

It is becoming difficult to make an argument for Rashford’s exclusion from the 
starting XI against Manchester City after the international break, should all 
Mourinho’s players return to Carrington fully fit. From thereon in, he has to 
be an integral part of United’s plans rather than a bit-part player handed 
20-minute bursts here and there.

Manchester United vs Hull City: Mourinho pleased with team, Phelan disappointed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/28/manchester-united-vs-hull-city-mourinho-pleased-with-team-phelan-disappointed-video>
Rashford’s displays have been too consistent to suggest that he is riding the 
crest of a wave. Every time he plays, he makes an impact. Before he scored the 
winner at Hull he had already forced an excellent save from Eldin Jakupovic and 
delivered an inviting ball across goal that only just evaded Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

He has the deadly combination of pace, skill and composure and, although 
Hull’s caretaker manager Mike Phelan said afterwards that his appearance off 
the bench reminded him of one of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s great cameos with 
United, such a role seems unlikely in the long-term.

Asked if Rashford was better utilised as a late substitute rather than a 
starter, Mourinho said: “I think top players are better on the pitch than on 
the bench. But coming against a tired team that was trying to hold off 
high-intensity waves of attacking football, for sure he comes fresh and comes 
sharp and he causes them problems. But I think top players have to have more 
time on the pitch than on the bench. I just want to say that he’s a very good 
player and a very good boy. He has the perfect head for an 18-year-old: very 
stable, not in the moon, so I think he has everything. He’s going to play a lot 
of matches.”

Rashford will soon join the England Under-21 squad – which Mourinho believes 
will benefit the player more than a senior call-up – and the dilemma the United 
manager could have is how the youngster slots into his starting team. 
Ibrahimovic’s place is a given, meaning Rooney, an out-of-form Martial and Juan 
Mata come under scrutiny.

Phelan, a man who has seen many United players progress from youth to first 
team, described Rashford as an “exceptional talent”, while Rooney said the 
teenager is “one of the brightest talents in Europe”.

He is arguably the most positive thing to emerge from the Louis van Gaal era 
at Old Trafford and, for Mourinho, represents a ready-made opportunity to place 
his faith in youth. Unlike with previous players at former clubs, there is 
little risk in playing Rashford. No transition period from under-age football 
to the highest level is required.

Mourinho can forget colour-coded lists and youngsters who played 10 minutes 
for him once upon a time. Rashford is ready to make more of an impression than 
any of those before him.
