Let us fold this magic tent

That’s enough I think, enough of this Politics Live great goodness. Lets all 
have an evening before regrouping in tight battle formation at 8am tomorrow.

But first, let’s recap Monday.

 * Newspoll showed the major parties in a dead heat, but one poll does not a 
trend make. Or more elegant words to that effect.

 * The government decided today was the day when Senate voting reform would 
burst out of the cupboard into public consciousness. The Greens say yes,Nick 
Xenophon says yes, Labor says more than likely no, and various cross benchers 
say this will spell the end of the micro-parties, which is, from their 
perspective, Not On.

 * Malcolm Turnbull pretty much ruled out doing anything much on capital gains 
tax (with some footnotes) and waggled a disapproving finger at Labor for being 
stupid about business and investment strategies and inherently opposed to 
luring kids back from Silicon Valley.

 * The prime minister also appeared to walk back half a centimetre on double 
dissolutions but only half a centimetre. I still wouldn’t book a holiday in 
July, myself.

 * Sydney broadcaster Ray Hadley sulked because the treasurer Scott Morrison 
declined to make himself available on his program, in accordance with their 
settled Monday tradition. Hadley told his listeners he had intended to rebuke 
the treasurer for having nothing to say. You know it makes sense.

 * Immigration minister Peter Dutton suggested during question time asylum 
seekers (unnamed) were self harming as some kind of method of getting 
Australian citizenship via a short hospital stay. GreenAdam Bandt and 
independentAndrew Wilkie were unhappy with this sledge and attempted to censure 
the minister for his remarks.

There was more, but there’s your main points.


Thanks for your company. See you in the morning.

Continuing to take stock of other matters, both the Coalition and Labor have 
signalled today that they are examining options for changing the laws around 
cross hormone therapy for transgender children.

At the moment, transgender minors and their parents must get permission from 
the Family Court before doctors can administer oestrogen or testosterone. 
Australia is the only country in the world to mandate judicial oversight in 
this area.

But both major parties have indicated that they will look at options to change 
that, a move welcomed by advocates. “We’ve been through the courts three times, 
and it’s a horrible, horrible process and we need to make sure that this 
doesn’t happen to any other family,” transgender teen, Georgie Stone, told 
Guardian Australia during a visit to parliament today. “There were changes 
happening to my body that I didn’t want and we had to apply to these people who 
didn’t even know us to make decisions about my body, which is just wrong. And I 
think it’s discriminatory and it has to change.”

Parents and their transgender children attended an event in Parliament House 
aimed at pressuring the government to change what they say is an “increasingly 
large barrier” to transitioning - the requirement that the Family Court must 
sign off on cross hormone therapy.

Turning to the other key matter of the day, Senate voting reform, Labor is 
still sounding less than convinced on this proposal.

A spokesman for Bill Shorten says the proposal will go through the usual 
shadow cabinet and caucus process, but (you felt that but coming, didn’t you) ..

Labor is concerned this looks very much like Malcolm Turnbull’s Greens party 
preference deal. It is not in the nation’s interest or our economic future to 
give the Greens party the balance of power in the Senate.

Reading each statement in context, this is what I think. I think Andrew Wilkie 
was perfectly entitled to call Dutton out on his self-harm/blackmail remark, 
which was quite something (as I noted covering it in real time.)

Dutton has a habit of making general declarations about such things without 
feeling much obligation to peg himself to facts: actual examples, actual cases, 
that would support such a serious allegation. It’s always inference, political 
word painting with a clear object of presenting behaviour as undesirable, and 
being called periodically on your sledge is an essential part of a healthy 
democracy. If he gets called more often, perhaps the minister will be more 
careful in his characterisations.

But in terms of the Marles rationale – the analysis that said Wilkie hasn’t 
represented precisely what Dutton said, therefore we can’t support this censure 
motion – it is actually possible to read Dutton’s comment this afternoon as one 
of his many general statements that I’ll categorise as “what these (dreadful) 
people” do – rather than a specific reflection on this particular case 
involving the baby in Brisbane.

There’s a small fig leaf there. I don’t regard the fig leaf as particularly 
compelling, but it is there. Convenient for Marles that the tiny fig leaf is 
there, because here is the actual truth: Labor really doesn’t want the current 
debate about the treatment of this child and other children in immigration 
detention. It would really like this debate to go the hell away.

Labor is caught, as the party always is, between “traditional” Labor voters 
who absolutely support policies like Operation Sovereign Borders and 
progressive Labor voters who are completely disgusted by the policy. This 
asylum debate for Labor is like a scab that won’t heal. Which is, of course, a 
fact not lost on the Greens, who want progressive voters to defect and stay.

One more thing should be noted about the circumstances of the baby. Because 
the government tells us nothing about its own behaviour concerning asylum 
seekers, and about their practical circumstances far out of sight and out of 
mind, we don’t know specifics about this case. We really don’t know key facts 
that would be useful to know in order to make a judgment about this specific 
case. And rather than pursuing a policy of disclosure and transparency, the 
government simply blames reporters for getting detail wrong, and characterises 
advocates for the asylum seekers as pursuing a strategy of boosting their own 
media profiles (as if this is something a person of conscience would actually 
contemplate doing).

Those immutable facts, and the inevitable overlay of politics, tend render 
these discussions incredibly suboptimal. We journalists can’t keep the public 
properly informed because the government won’t allow us to do that, and the 
government then blames us for failing to be accurate. It’s a disgrace, and the 
absurdity of fictions, the absurdity of the policy contortions, the deeply 
irritating false binaries and false equivalences in this debate, are obviously 
unsustainable to anyone who looks at this area for more than five minutes.

Thus ends my analysis.

Rightio, several readers have been in touch wondering how it is that Richard 
Marles can say Labor doesn’t support the Wilkie motion (censuring Peter Dutton) 
on the basis the wording was over egged. The only way to get to the bottom of 
this is backtrack to the motion, which I missed, because it was brought on on 
the fly.

Thanks to Andrew Wilkie’s office, here is the motion put this afternoon.

That the minister for immigration and border protection be censured for 
implying that the baby Asha was deliberately harmed as a means of facilitating 
asylum seeker access to Australia.

So let’s work through this carefully.

In question time, Dutton said the following.

I’m not going to conduct a situation, not going to preside over a situation 
where we have people self harming to come to hospitals in this country because 
they believe that is the route out into the Australian community for Australian 
citizenship.

This remark was in response to a question from Adam Bandt. Here was his 
question, which went to Turnbull before it was redirected to Dutton.

Adam Bandt:

Q: Doctors have said that returning baby Asha to detention would harm her. 
Your immigration minister has decided not to send her to Nauru for the time 
being but said it will happen later. Prime minister, do you agree with the 
doctors that detention harms children or are you waiting until after the 
election to deport babies and children to Nauru?

This was Dutton’s full answer. To make a fair judgment I think we need the 
full answer.

Peter Dutton:

Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for his question. Last 
year when the shadow immigration minister addressed the Labor party conference 
and he said that Labor regretted the decisions they made which resulted in 
children drowning at sea, I thought his words were profound and I thought they 
were genuine, I thought they were sincere and it’s why the Labor party decided 
to move away from the policy which had seen 50,000 people arrive on 800 boats 
and 1,200 people drowned at sea.

Since Operation Sovereign Borders has been implemented we have been able to 
stare down the threat from people smugglers. Not one death at sea has been 
reported over that period. We have the ability to turn back boats where it’s 
safe to do so and it’s the policy of both government and opposition in this 
country to continue regional processing because we know that it works in 
stopping the boats. Now we are working with third countries to try and provide 
alternative arrangements but we have been very clear and I repeat this today, 
because the people smugglers listen to every word spoken in this place, spoken 
by premiers and other leaders around the country, let me be very clear to these 
people.

We will not be held to ransom, we will not be blackmailed into changing this 
policy because this policy has resulted in lives being saved. And we are not 
going to retreat on what has been a successful policy because I’m not going to 
preside over an arrangement which the Greens presided over when they were in 
coalition with the Rudd and Gillard governments which saw children drown at 
sea. I’m not going to allow that to return.

We have said we will look at each case compassionately, on its merit, and we 
will decide in relation to those cases what is in the best interests of those 
children or of those families.

I’m not going to conduct a situation, not going to preside over a situation 
where we have people self harming to come to hospitals in this country because 
they believe that is the route out into the Australian community for Australian 
citizenship.

Now we know that we will provide medical assistance, including to this baby, 
and including to other people we have brought to this country and when the 
medical assistance has been provided, Mr Speaker, to that family or to that 
individual, the policy of this government, the policy of the opposition is that 
that person will return to Nauru. We will provide support and assistance to 
return people back to their country of origin if they have found to be not 
under protection and that is the policy we will continue because we are not 
going to allow the people smugglers to get back into business.

I’ll let you think on that, before I come back in the next post and share my 
thoughts.

Labor’s immigration spokesman Richard Marles says he won’t support the censure 
motion because it over eggs what Dutton said in the parliament during question 
time today. Marles says in this debate, it is very important to sift facts from 
spin. Marles says this debate has to be conducted on the basis of accurately 
representing what people say, not distorting what they say.

The government is driving this through now.

Peter Dutton is back in the house. Dutton says in relation to baby Asha, I 
pass no judgment and make no comment in relation to (the circumstances of the 
baby’s injuries). He says he wants children out of detention and he’s not going 
to copsanctimonious lectures from the Greens who presided over people drowning 
at sea.

Peter Dutton:

This cooked up situation in parliament today needs to be seen for what it is. 
We are not going to tolerate these lectures from the Greens. That’s why the 
censure motion should be rejected.

No time to take stock. The Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie is attempting 
to censure the immigration ministerPeter Dutton, for his remarks in question 
time about blackmail and self harm.

Wilkie says the suggestion from Dutton today that self harm was being deployed 
as a route to citizenship wasone of the ugliest things I have heard in this 
place in my time serving here.

The government clearly isn’t expecting this, and no initial effort is made to 
shut Wilkie down. Ah yes, they’ve cottoned on now. The gag has been moved.

That’s enough I think, enough of this Politics Live great goodness. Lets all 
have an evening before regrouping in tight battle formation at 8am tomorrow.

But first, let’s recap Monday.

 * Newspoll showed the major parties in a dead heat, but one poll does not a 
trend make. Or more elegant words to that effect.

 * The government decided today was the day when Senate voting reform would 
burst out of the cupboard into public consciousness. The Greens say yes,Nick 
Xenophon says yes, Labor says more than likely no, and various cross benchers 
say this will spell the end of the micro-parties, which is, from their 
perspective, Not On.

 * Malcolm Turnbull pretty much ruled out doing anything much on capital gains 
tax (with some footnotes) and waggled a disapproving finger at Labor for being 
stupid about business and investment strategies and inherently opposed to 
luring kids back from Silicon Valley.

 * The prime minister also appeared to walk back half a centimetre on double 
dissolutions but only half a centimetre. I still wouldn’t book a holiday in 
July, myself.

 * Sydney broadcaster Ray Hadley sulked because the treasurer Scott Morrison 
declined to make himself available on his program, in accordance with their 
settled Monday tradition. Hadley told his listeners he had intended to rebuke 
the treasurer for having nothing to say. You know it makes sense.

 * Immigration minister Peter Dutton suggested during question time asylum 
seekers (unnamed) were self harming as some kind of method of getting 
Australian citizenship via a short hospital stay. GreenAdam Bandt and 
independentAndrew Wilkie were unhappy with this sledge and attempted to censure 
the minister for his remarks.

There was more, but there’s your main points.


Thanks for your company. See you in the morning. 

 
Senator Jacqui Lambie, on the ABC just now, on the intrinsic merits of the 
Senate cross bench.

We’ve done a lot of great goodness up here.
 
Catching up with a little Mikearoo magic.

 the prime minister has invited all the senate crossbenchers round for a bite 
of tea on Thursday night. Peace, love and harmony. And Awks.
 
Here’s a picture of the visitors today at the Parliamentary Friendship Group 
for LGBTI Australians – referenced in Shalailah’s post.

Friendship group for LGBTI Australians in Parliament House in Canberra this

Continuing to take stock of other matters, both the Coalition and Labor have 
signalled today that they are examining options for changing the laws around 
cross hormone therapy for transgender children.

At the moment, transgender minors and their parents must get permission from 
the Family Court before doctors can administer oestrogen or testosterone. 
Australia is the only country in the world to mandate judicial oversight in 
this area.

But both major parties have indicated that they will look at options to change 
that, a move welcomed by advocates. “We’ve been through the courts three times, 
and it’s a horrible, horrible process and we need to make sure that this 
doesn’t happen to any other family,” transgender teen, Georgie Stone, told 
Guardian Australia during a visit to parliament today. “There were changes 
happening to my body that I didn’t want and we had to apply to these people who 
didn’t even know us to make decisions about my body, which is just wrong. And I 
think it’s discriminatory and it has to change.”

Parents and their transgender children attended an event in Parliament House 
aimed at pressuring the government to change what they say is an “increasingly 
large barrier” to transitioning - the requirement that the Family Court must 
sign off on cross hormone therapy.
 
Turning to the other key matter of the day, Senate voting reform, Labor is 
still sounding less than convinced on this proposal.

A spokesman for Bill Shorten says the proposal will go through the usual 
shadow cabinet and caucus process, but (you felt that but coming, didn’t you) ..

Labor is concerned this looks very much like Malcolm Turnbull’s Greens party 
preference deal. It is not in the nation’s interest or our economic future to 
give the Greens party the balance of power in the Senate.
 
Reading each statement in context, this is what I think. I think Andrew Wilkie 
was perfectly entitled to call Dutton out on his self-harm/blackmail remark, 
which was quite something (as I noted covering it in real time.)

Dutton has a habit of making general declarations about such things without 
feeling much obligation to peg himself to facts: actual examples, actual cases, 
that would support such a serious allegation. It’s always inference, political 
word painting with a clear object of presenting behaviour as undesirable, and 
being called periodically on your sledge is an essential part of a healthy 
democracy. If he gets called more often, perhaps the minister will be more 
careful in his characterisations.

But in terms of the Marles rationale – the analysis that said Wilkie hasn’t 
represented precisely what Dutton said, therefore we can’t support this censure 
motion – it is actually possible to read Dutton’s comment this afternoon as one 
of his many general statements that I’ll categorise as “what these (dreadful) 
people” do – rather than a specific reflection on this particular case 
involving the baby in Brisbane.

There’s a small fig leaf there. I don’t regard the fig leaf as particularly 
compelling, but it is there. Convenient for Marles that the tiny fig leaf is 
there, because here is the actual truth: Labor really doesn’t want the current 
debate about the treatment of this child and other children in immigration 
detention. It would really like this debate to go the hell away.

Labor is caught, as the party always is, between “traditional” Labor voters 
who absolutely support policies like Operation Sovereign Borders and 
progressive Labor voters who are completely disgusted by the policy. This 
asylum debate for Labor is like a scab that won’t heal. Which is, of course, a 
fact not lost on the Greens, who want progressive voters to defect and stay.

One more thing should be noted about the circumstances of the baby. Because 
the government tells us nothing about its own behaviour concerning asylum 
seekers, and about their practical circumstances far out of sight and out of 
mind, we don’t know specifics about this case. We really don’t know key facts 
that would be useful to know in order to make a judgment about this specific 
case. And rather than pursuing a policy of disclosure and transparency, the 
government simply blames reporters for getting detail wrong, and characterises 
advocates for the asylum seekers as pursuing a strategy of boosting their own 
media profiles (as if this is something a person of conscience would actually 
contemplate doing).

Those immutable facts, and the inevitable overlay of politics, tend render 
these discussions incredibly suboptimal. We journalists can’t keep the public 
properly informed because the government won’t allow us to do that, and the 
government then blames us for failing to be accurate. It’s a disgrace, and the 
absurdity of fictions, the absurdity of the policy contortions, the deeply 
irritating false binaries and false equivalences in this debate, are obviously 
unsustainable to anyone who looks at this area for more than five minutes.

Thus ends my analysis.
 
Rightio, several readers have been in touch wondering how it is that Richard 
Marles can say Labor doesn’t support the Wilkie motion (censuring Peter Dutton) 
on the basis the wording was over egged. The only way to get to the bottom of 
this is backtrack to the motion, which I missed, because it was brought on on 
the fly.

Thanks to Andrew Wilkie’s office, here is the motion put this afternoon.

That the minister for immigration and border protection be censured for 
implying that the baby Asha was deliberately harmed as a means of facilitating 
asylum seeker access to Australia.

So let’s work through this carefully.

In question time, Dutton said the following.

I’m not going to conduct a situation, not going to preside over a situation 
where we have people self harming to come to hospitals in this country because 
they believe that is the route out into the Australian community for Australian 
citizenship.

This remark was in response to a question from Adam Bandt. Here was his 
question, which went to Turnbull before it was redirected to Dutton.

Adam Bandt:

Q: Doctors have said that returning baby Asha to detention would harm her. 
Your immigration minister has decided not to send her to Nauru for the time 
being but said it will happen later. Prime minister, do you agree with the 
doctors that detention harms children or are you waiting until after the 
election to deport babies and children to Nauru?

This was Dutton’s full answer. To make a fair judgment I think we need the 
full answer.

Peter Dutton:

Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for his question. Last 
year when the shadow immigration minister addressed the Labor party conference 
and he said that Labor regretted the decisions they made which resulted in 
children drowning at sea, I thought his words were profound and I thought they 
were genuine, I thought they were sincere and it’s why the Labor party decided 
to move away from the policy which had seen 50,000 people arrive on 800 boats 
and 1,200 people drowned at sea.

Since Operation Sovereign Borders has been implemented we have been able to 
stare down the threat from people smugglers. Not one death at sea has been 
reported over that period. We have the ability to turn back boats where it’s 
safe to do so and it’s the policy of both government and opposition in this 
country to continue regional processing because we know that it works in 
stopping the boats. Now we are working with third countries to try and provide 
alternative arrangements but we have been very clear and I repeat this today, 
because the people smugglers listen to every word spoken in this place, spoken 
by premiers and other leaders around the country, let me be very clear to these 
people.

We will not be held to ransom, we will not be blackmailed into changing this 
policy because this policy has resulted in lives being saved. And we are not 
going to retreat on what has been a successful policy because I’m not going to 
preside over an arrangement which the Greens presided over when they were in 
coalition with the Rudd and Gillard governments which saw children drown at 
sea. I’m not going to allow that to return.

We have said we will look at each case compassionately, on its merit, and we 
will decide in relation to those cases what is in the best interests of those 
children or of those families.

I’m not going to conduct a situation, not going to preside over a situation 
where we have people self harming to come to hospitals in this country because 
they believe that is the route out into the Australian community for Australian 
citizenship.

Now we know that we will provide medical assistance, including to this baby, 
and including to other people we have brought to this country and when the 
medical assistance has been provided, Mr Speaker, to that family or to that 
individual, the policy of this government, the policy of the opposition is that 
that person will return to Nauru. We will provide support and assistance to 
return people back to their country of origin if they have found to be not 
under protection and that is the policy we will continue because we are not 
going to allow the people smugglers to get back into business.

I’ll let you think on that, before I come back in the next post and share my 
thoughts.
 
I’ll try and track down the precise wording of that Wilkie motion.

In the meantime, here was that vote.

Labor’s immigration spokesman Richard Marles says he won’t support the censure 
motion because it over eggs what Dutton said in the parliament during question 
time today. Marles says in this debate, it is very important to sift facts from 
spin. Marles says this debate has to be conducted on the basis of accurately 
representing what people say, not distorting what they say.

The government is driving this through now.
 
Peter Dutton is back in the house. Dutton says in relation to baby Asha, I 
pass no judgment and make no comment in relation to (the circumstances of the 
baby’s injuries). He says he wants children out of detention and he’s not going 
to copsanctimonious lectures from the Greens who presided over people drowning 
at sea.

Peter Dutton:

This cooked up situation in parliament today needs to be seen for what it is. 
We are not going to tolerate these lectures from the Greens. That’s why the 
censure motion should be rejected.
 
The Wilkie motion is being seconded by Green Adam Bandt. He says there’s a 
certain inevitability inAustralian politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics>, when the 
polls go down, the ugly goes up. Dutton’s remark he characterises asa 
disgusting and vile statement.

No time to take stock. The Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie is attempting 
to censure the immigration ministerPeter Dutton, for his remarks in question 
time about blackmail and self harm.

Wilkie says the suggestion from Dutton today that self harm was being deployed 
as a route to citizenship wasone of the ugliest things I have heard in this 
place in my time serving here.

The government clearly isn’t expecting this, and no initial effort is made to 
shut Wilkie down. Ah yes, they’ve cottoned on now. The gag has been moved.
