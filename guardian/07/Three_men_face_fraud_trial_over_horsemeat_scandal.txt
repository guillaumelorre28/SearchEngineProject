Three men have appeared in court charged with fraud relating to the horsemeat 
scandal of 2012.

Andronicas Sideras, 54, from Southgate, north London; Ulrik Nielsen, 57, from 
Gentofte in Denmark; and Alex Ostler-Beech, 43, from Hull, are accused of 
conspiring together and with others to defraud customers by mixing horsemeat 
with beef to be sold dishonestly as beef that ended up in products such as 
burgers.

The three appeared at City of London magistrates court on Tuesday. They were 
jointly charged after an international investigation led by the City of London 
police specialist fraud division for the Food Standards Agency.

They were arrested and interviewed under caution in the summer of 2013; a 
fourth man interviewed at the same time has not been charged.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it was bringing the charges, which relate 
to the period between January and October 2012, after careful examination of 
evidence from the UK and overseas.

The three men were released on bail and ordered to reappear at Inner London 
crown court on 25 October.
